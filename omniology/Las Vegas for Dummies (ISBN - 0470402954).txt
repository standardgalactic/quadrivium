Introduction
W
elcome to Las Vegas, a truly original city, where the greatest land-
marks are all reproductions and the name of the game is gam-
bling. This neon jungle is, at turns, classy, tacky, cheesy, and sleazy, but
it’s always entertaining. If there’s one sure bet in this town, it’s that
you’ll never be bored — even if you don’t pull a single slot handle.
But navigating your way through the sensory overload that is Sin City
without exhausting yourself should be a priority; you are, after all, on
vacation. All you need to ensure an enjoyable trip to Las Vegas is some
patience, some advance planning, and a little luck (hitting it big can do
wonders for one’s mood).
About This Book
Pay full price? Read the fine print? Do it their way?
Excuse me. There’s no need for any of that.
You picked this book because you know the For Dummies brand and you
want to go to Las Vegas. You also probably know how much you want to
spend, the pace you want to keep, and the amount of planning you can
stomach. You may not want to tend to every little detail, yet you don’t
trust just anyone to make your plans for you.
In this book, we give you the lowdown on Las Vegas, which challenges
Orlando as the number-one tourist destination in the United States.
Rising from its modest beginning as a small, old-time gambling town, the
city has more hotel rooms than any other. And for sheer spectacle, it’s
hard to beat this town. Here you can watch a volcano explode, see a
pirate ship sink, stroll by the Eiffel Tower, and cross the Brooklyn Bridge.
And did we mention that you can gamble?
To say that taking it all in can be overwhelming, and exhausting, would
be a massive understatement. No need to worry. As Vegas veterans with
years of experience, we’ve scoured the city from the Strip to downtown
to find the best deals around. In this book, we guide you through Las
Vegas in a clear, easy-to-understand way, allowing you to find the best
hotels, restaurants, and attractions without having to read the book like
a novel — cover to cover (although you can read this book cover to
cover if you so choose). With this book, you can find the best and most
essential ingredients for a winning vacation.

Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this is especially true of prices. We therefore suggest that
you write or call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans.
The authors, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the
experiences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us,
however, so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your sur-
roundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite
targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book we’ve included lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions.
As we describe each, we often include abbreviations for commonly
accepted credit cards. Take a look at the following list for an explanation
of each:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
We’ve divided the hotels into two categories — our personal favorites
and those that don’t quite make our preferred list but still get our hearty
seal of approval (see “No Room at the Inn?” in Chapter 9). Don’t be shy
about considering these “runner-up” hotels if you’re unable to get a
room at one of our favorites or if your preferences differ from ours —
the amenities that the runners up offer and the services that each pro-
vides make all these accommodations good choices to consider as you
determine where to rest your head at night.
We also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. We’ve
used a system of dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night 
in a hotel (the price refers to a double-occupancy room) or a meal at a
restaurant (included in the cost of each meal is soup or salad, an entree,

Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and what
your needs may be as a traveler. Here’s what we assumed about you:
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Las Vegas and wants expert advice when you finally do get
a chance to enjoy that particular locale.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Las Vegas and how to plan 
for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Las Vegas or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses
on the places that will give you the best or most unique experience
in Las Vegas.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Las Vegas For Dummies, 5th Edition
gives you the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
Las Vegas For Dummies, 5th Edition, is divided into six parts. The chapters
in each part lay out the specifics within each part’s topic. Likewise, each
chapter is written so that you don’t have to read what came before or
after, though we sometimes refer you to other areas for more information.
Part I: Introducing Las Vegas
Think of this part as the hors d’oeuvres. In this part, we tempt you with
the best experiences, hotels, restaurants, and attractions in Las Vegas.
We also cover the city’s history highlights, and throw in a weather fore-
cast and a look at special events to help you decide when to visit.
Introduction 3

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas
How much money should you budget? Should you use a travel agent?
How about buying a package tour? Where can you find the best airfare?
We answer those questions and then talk about booking tips and online
sources. We also talk about travel insurance and renting a car, and pro-
vide special tips and resources for families, seniors, travelers with dis-
abilities and gay and lesbian travelers.
Part III: Settling Into Las Vegas
We introduce you to the neighborhoods and explore some of the modus
transporto (buses, taxis, and so on). We also give you a menu of area
hotels and motels, and review local restaurants and buffets.
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas
Jackpot! In this part, we take you on a stroll through Sin City, enabling
you to do your best at adding to the coffers of the casino. We take a
thorough look at the attractions, entertainment (and yes, some people
consider getting married at a drive-thru window entertaining!), shop-
ping, and recreational opportunities in the city. Oh, and if you’ve man-
aged to miss this until now, there’s a lot of gambling. Because you
probably want to press your luck at least once, we’ve included every-
thing you need to know to play the most popular games and find the
best casinos. We even provide a few helpful itineraries to help you
cruise Vegas’s hot spots in the most efficient manner, and give you a
couple day-trip options for those wanting to get away from all the glitz.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Las Vegas Nightlife
An adult playground, Las Vegas really heats up after the sun sets, offer-
ing numerous opportunities to party all night long. In this part, we
explore the city’s life after dark, from big, splashy production shows,
such as Cirque du Soleil, to some of the hottest dance clubs in town.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book offers the delightful Parts of Tens. Finding this
part is as certain as the casino coming out ahead at the gambling tables.
In this part, we serve up a bunch of cool facts about Las Vegas and
salute some of the city’s past greats.
Quick Concierge
In back of this book we’ve included an appendix — your Quick
Concierge — containing lots of handy information you may need when
traveling in Las Vegas, like phone numbers and addresses of emergency
personnel or area hospitals and pharmacies, lists of local newspapers
and magazines, protocol for sending mail or finding taxis, and more.
Check out this appendix when searching for answers to lots of little
Las Vegas For Dummies, 5th Edition

questions that may come up as you travel. You can find Quick Concierge
easily because it’s printed on yellow paper.
Icons Used in This Book
You can find several icons scattered throughout the margins of this
guide. Consider them your road map for finding the information you
need.
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
Best of the Best icon highlights the best Vegas has to offer in all categories —
hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary rip-
offs, and other things to beware.
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids. Keep in mind that Las Vegas is not that receptive to small
fries, so it’s not the ideal spot for a family vacation, regardless of what 
it once claimed.
Because you’re likely to press your luck at some point during your stay
in Las Vegas, look to the Gambling Tips icon for a little guidance on max-
imizing you chances and minimizing your losses.
Where to Go from Here
We’ve briefed you on what to expect from this book, so roll the dice and
start reading. You have lots to do before you arrive, from arranging a
place to snatch a few hours’ sleep between poker sessions to finding the
best places to spend your winnings. Like the Boy Scouts’ creed, the suc-
cessful Vegas traveler needs to “be prepared”; follow the advice in this
book, and the odds that you’ll have a great vacation will be hard to beat.
And, last but not least, have fun — the city is designed to entertain you
so open your mind and enjoy it!

T
o get the most enjoyment out of a vacation with the least
amount of hassles, it helps to know what’s awaiting you
in your chosen paradise before the landing gear lowers. If you
want your Las Vegas vacation to pay off in spades, you need
to plan it as far in advance as possible. In this part, we high-
light the joys of a trip to Sin City and help you sort out the
logistics of planning your trip, from choosing the best times
to go to planning your vacation budget. But before we get into
the nitty-gritty details, we take a look at some of the best
things Las Vegas has to offer.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of Las Vegas
In This Chapter
 Enjoying the best Las Vegas experiences
 Finding the best places to stay and dine
 Seeing the best shows
“I
t’s Vegas, baby!” is the catchphrase from the independent movie
hit Swingers — and that’s all you need to know.
Okay, maybe you need to know a little more. But if a city exists that has
its heart — and all sorts of other body parts — right on its sleeve, and
all its goods in the shop window (which is, by the way, subtly outlined in
blazing bright neon), it’s Las Vegas. This isn’t a coy metropolis or an
unassuming city. Vegas is a gaudy monstrosity of delight: a city designed
solely to take your money and break your heart while making you love it
and beg for more. And people do keep coming — Las Vegas is the fifth
most-popular destination in the world. Don’t come here looking for cul-
ture and self-improvement, but do come here looking for a whale of a
good time. You’re sure to have it.
The following are our picks for the best of Las Vegas.
Best Vegas Experiences
From hitting the big jackpot to hanging out with dolphins, here are some
of the best experiences Vegas has to offer:
 Best most-Vegas moment: Seeing the Strip at night, when every-
thing is coated in lights. Everything gleams, shimmers, shimmies,
and beckons. It’s sinful and delicious. Even a cynic’s jaw drops and
even the purest of the pure get a little bit giddy. It’s a testament to
the philosophy that anything is possible, and in that there is both
hope and horror.

 Best hoped-for Vegas moment: Hitting that million-dollar jackpot,
with one pull of a handle. Good luck to you.
 Best free show: The Bellagio Water Fountains. Sounds silly, 
until you see those giant spouts of water dance and leap to every-
thing from opera arias to Sinatra. Try to not grin at least once. We
dare you.
 Best non-Vegas moment: Hanging out with the coolest water mam-
mals around in the Mirage’s Dolphin Habitat. The trainers, who
have the best job in the city, make them jump periodically (all natu-
ral movements they would do for fun anyway). The dolphins love it.
You will, too.
 Best cheapskate Vegas fun: Playing penny slots. C’mon, live a little.
 Best Vegas attraction: There is nothing quite like the Liberace
Museum. Bless his sequin-and-rhinestone-bedecked heart.
Best Vegas Hotels
See Chapter 9 for complete reviews of the following hotels:
 Best drop-dead hotel: THEhotel, an annex to Mandalay Bay, is a
sophisticated, mature, stylish endeavor, a Manhattan boutique
hotel on human growth hormones. The only hotel where all accom-
modations are true suites, and the only Strip hotel we really want
to stay in right now.
 Best hotel for the well-heeled: The Four Seasons, naturally. They
have a reputation for a reason. All is comfort, all is class. And hon-
estly, they probably aren’t any more expensive than some of the
other high-end hotels on the Strip.
 Best resort hotel: The Ritz-Carlton Lake Las Vegas is actually 30
minutes, and a lifetime, away from the Strip, and it’s worth it, except
for the problem that once you come here, you never want to leave.
 Best totally Vegas hotel: It’s not really as it once was, but although
Caesar’s Palace has stripped away some of its cheese, it still ranks
as the archetype for all Vegas hotels. There’s the theme, typified by
the Roman soldiers strolling the property and the talking Roman
statues in the Rome-theme shopping mall. There’s the sense of
luxury. There’s Bette, Cher and Elton. And there’s the size. Some
think it romantic, some think it a hoot. Just like Vegas itself.
 Best theme hotel: New York-New York, where the entire NYC sky-
line is built into the hotel’s structure and every major Manhattan
landmark is a part of the hotel’s public spaces.
 Best swimming pool: Mandalay Bay’s water area, with a wave
pool, beach, lazy river, several other basic pools, and even an 
outdoor casino, is so fabulous they have to check room keys to

keep non-guests away. We also like the tropical wonderland around
the Mirage’s amorphous pool, and there is something to be said for
Bellagio’s sophisticated classical pool layout.
 Best bathrooms: THEhotel has a sunken tub so deep the water
comes up to our chin, plus a flat screen TV. The rest of it is marble
and big. We were tempted to write this entire book from there.
 Best downtown hotel: It’s a tie between the Golden Nugget, the
overall sharpest and most together hotel, with rooms comparable
to the Mirage, and the cheaper, and oddly sweet, Main Street
Station.
Best Vegas Restaurants
See Chapter 10 for complete reviews of the following restaurants:
 Best celebrity chef restaurants: Actually, few celebrity chefs are in
the kitchen in Vegas — they just have outposts of their name brand
restaurants. If that matters to you — and if money is no object —
then you have to eat at Joel Robuchon at the Mansion (in the MGM
Grand), where the master chef continues his sterling reputation.
(Truth be told, Robuchon won’t be in the kitchen all the time either,
but many of his employees from his famous establishments are in
charge, and execute their duty flawlessly.) Considerably less dear is
Picasso (in the Bellagio) where Julian Serrano, late of San Francisco’s
Masa, actually holds court most nights. Otherwise, you can proba-
bly rely on the fact that someone is paying careful attention to
Emeril’s Table 10 (in the Palazzo), Thomas Keller’s Bouchon (in 
the Venetian) and Charlie Palmer’s Aureole. If these chefs them-
selves aren’t wielding the utensils, they’ve made darn sure some-
one reliable — and maybe even on their way to their own celebrity
chef fame — is.
 Best noncelebrity chef restaurants: Rosemary’s is run by two
chefs who cut their teeth on noted restaurants in New Orleans
before coming to Vegas to help open up Emeril’s Seafood at the
MGM Grand. Alize (in the Palms) is another venture from Andre (of
Andre’s in Downtown and the Monte Carlo, both also highly recom-
mended). We’ve had some of our best meals in Vegas at both
restaurants. The chefs may not be household names, but they
ought to be.
 Best new restaurant: Don’t rule out Emeril just because he’s an
empire. His Table 10 at the new Palazzo hit the ground running.
 Best budget meal: The submarine sandwiches at Capriotti’s are so
big, not to mention so delicious, that three people could probably
feel well fed off one large sandwich — which costs around $9.
 Best buffet: The days of cheap Vegas buffets are over — if you want
food that’s more than just fuel, at least. If you don’t mind spending
Part I: Introducing Las Vegas 
12

a bit (but still probably less overall than you might at any moder-
ately priced restaurant), spend it on the range of French regional-
inspired dishes at Paris, Le Village Buffet (in the Paris hotel) or
the less thematically oriented, but still terrific Wynn Las Vegas
Buffet. Otherwise, of the more moderately priced (but still not 
all that pricey) buffets, Main Street Station has the freshest and
nicest one.
 Best red meat: We love the prime rib at Lawry’s, but if you want
other cuts of cow, split a monster 44-ouncer (unless you think you
don’t need to, you greedy goose) at Charlie Palmer Steak. The
latter a little too pricey? Locals love what they do to meat at
Austin’s Steakhouse.
Best Vegas Entertainment
See Chapters 16 and 17 for reviews of these and other nightlife options:
 Best production shows: We have tears in our eyes when we watch
Cirque de Soleil’s O, as they perform feats of skill and beauty in,
over, across, above, and around a tank of water like no other. And
for sheer audacity of mechanics, plus an actual plot, Cirque may
have topped itself with KA. And we have nothing but admiration for
the silliness, which actually hides a message about innocence and
wonder, of Blue Man Group. You’ll never look at marshmallows,
paint, and PVC pipes the same way again.
 Best magic show: You can’t throw a rock without hitting a magic
act in Vegas, but the close-up work Lance Burton does in the first
15 minutes of his show is some of the best done by anyone in the
world. The rest of the show, featuring the finest support act in
town, comic-juggler Michael Goudeau, is pretty great, too.
 Best smart guys: Penn & Teller ostensibly do magic, but it’s 
basically an excuse for hip, intelligent, social commentary. Vegas
doesn’t deserve them. Probably no one does. Go and show your
appreciation.
 Best classic Vegas revue: The nipple-tastic, topless Jubilee! is
everything you could want in a Vegas revue: pointless sketches
about Samson and Delilah and the sinking of the Titanic, lip-
syncing, topless show girls, and giant Bob Mackie headdresses. 
It’s absurd and the best of an endangered species.

egas is simple; gamble and gawk. Repeat as needed. Okay, so there
might be a little more to the town than that — or, rather, perhaps
there is more detail to those two activities than that.
History 101: The Main Events
There has rarely been a time in Vegas’s post-Bugsy history when the 
city wasn’t booming, but it seems on a particular roll right now. A new
megaresort seems to go up every other week, and each brings some-
thing new to the party, sometimes things hitherto never invited: great
works of art, five-star world-renowned chefs, rock clubs and arenas that
attract significant and still-current acts — you get the idea. In other
words, everything old is new again, and Vegas glamour is back.
The 1930s: The Eighth Wonder of the World
For many years after its creation, Las Vegas was a mere whistle-stop
town, a desert hellhole. That all changed in 1928 when Congress author-
ized the building of nearby Boulder Dam (later renamed Hoover Dam),
bringing thousands of workers to the area. It’s probably just a coinci-
dence that in 1931, after the city was flooded with all kinds of bored,
tired men with disposable income, gambling once again became legal in
Nevada. Upon the dam’s completion, the workers left, and the Las Vegas
Chamber of Commerce worked hard to lure the hordes of tourists who
came to see the engineering marvel (it was called “the Eighth Wonder of
the World”) to its casinos. But it wasn’t until the early years of World

War II that visionary entrepreneurs figured out how to put the glitter on
Vegas and its future.
The 1940s: Las Vegas goes south
Contrary to popular lore, developer Bugsy “my first name is Benjamin,
dammit!” Siegel didn’t actually stake a claim in the middle of nowhere —
he just built a few blocks south of already-existing properties.
In 1941, El Rancho Vegas, ultra-luxurious for its time, was built on a
remote stretch of highway (across the street from where the Sahara now
stands). Scores of Hollywood celebrities were invited to the grand open-
ing, and El Rancho Vegas soon became the hotel of choice for visiting
film stars.
Other properties followed, with each new property trying to outdo 
existing hotels in luxurious amenities and thematic splendor — a trend
that continues today. Las Vegas was on its way to becoming the enter-
tainment capital of the world. Throughout the decade, the city was
Hollywood’s celebrity playground. The Hollywood connection gave the
town glamour in the public’s mind. So did the mob connection (some-
thing Las Vegas has spent decades trying to live down), which became
clear when in 1946, notorious underworld gangster Bugsy Siegel began
construction on the fabulous Flamingo, a tropical paradise and “a real
class joint.”
A steady stream of name entertainers came to Las Vegas. In 1947, Jimmy
Durante opened the showroom at The Flamingo. Other headliners of the
1940s included Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, tap-dancing legend Bill
“Bojangles” Robinson, the Mills Brothers, skater Sonja Henie, and
Frankie Laine. Future Las Vegas legend Sammy Davis Jr. debuted at El
Rancho Vegas in 1945.
While the Strip was expanding, Downtown kept pace with new hotels
such as the El Cortez and the Golden Nugget. By the end of the decade,
Fremont Street was known as “Glitter Gulch,” its profusion of neon signs
proclaiming round-the-clock gaming and entertainment.
The 1950s: Building booms and A-bombs
Las Vegas entered the new decade as a city (no longer a frontier town)
with a population of about 50,000. Hotel growth was phenomenal, and
that laid the groundwork for the Vegas of today (who says this town has
no tradition?). The Desert Inn, which opened in 1950 with headliners
Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, brought country-club elegance
(including an 18-hole golf course and tennis courts) to the Strip.
In 1951, the Eldorado Club Downtown became Benny Binion’s Horseshoe
Club, which would gain fame as the home of the annual World Series of
Poker. In 1954, the Showboat sailed into a new area east of Downtown.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Las Vegas 15

The Showboat not only introduced buffet meals, but it also offered
round-the-clock bingo and a bowling alley (106 lanes to date).
In 1955 the Côte d’Azur–themed Riviera became the ninth big hotel to
open on the Strip. Breaking the ranch-style mode, it was, at nine stories,
the Strip’s first high-rise. Liberace, one of the hottest names in show
business, was paid the unprecedented sum of $50,000 a week to dazzle
audiences in The Riviera’s posh Clover Room.
Elvis appeared at the New Frontier in 1956 but wasn’t a huge success;
his fans were too young to fit the Las Vegas tourist mold. In 1958, the
$10-million, 1,065-room Stardust upped the spectacular stakes by
importing the famed Lido de Paris spectacle from the French capital. It
became one of the longest-running shows ever to play Las Vegas.
Throughout the 1950s, most of the Vegas hotels competed for perform-
ers whose followers spent freely in the casinos. The advent of big-name
Strip entertainment tolled a death knell for glamorous nightclubs in
America; owners simply could not compete with the astronomical
salaries paid to Las Vegas headliners. Two performers whose names
have been linked to Las Vegas ever since — Frank Sinatra and Wayne
Newton — made their debuts there. Mae West not only performed in Las
Vegas, but also cleverly bought up a 1⁄2 mile of desolate Strip frontage
between the Dunes and the Tropicana.
Competition for the tourist dollar also brought nationally televised
sporting events such as the PGA’s Tournament of Champions. In the
1950s, the wedding industry helped make Las Vegas one of the nation’s
most popular venues for “goin’ to the chapel.” Celebrity weddings of 
the 1950s that sparked the trend included singer Dick Haymes and 
Rita Hayworth, Joan Crawford and Pepsi chairman Alfred Steele, Carol
Channing and TV exec Charles Lowe, and Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward.
On a grimmer note, the ’50s also heralded the atomic age in Nevada,
with nuclear testing taking place just 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
A chilling 1951 photograph shows a mushroom-shaped cloud from an
atomic bomb test visible over the Fremont Street horizon. Throughout
the decade, about one bomb a month was detonated in the nearby
desert (an event, interestingly enough, that often attracted loads of
tourists).
The 1960s: The Rat Pack and a pack rat
The very first month of the new decade made entertainment history
when the Sands hosted a three-week “Summit Meeting” in the Copa
Room that was presided over by “Chairman of the Board” Frank Sinatra
with Rat Pack cronies Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and
Joey Bishop (all of whom happened to be in town filming the original
Ocean’s Eleven).
Part I: Introducing Las Vegas 
16

The building boom of the ’50s took a brief respite. Most of the Strip’s
first property, the El Rancho Vegas, burned down in 1960. And the first
new hotel of the decade, the first to be built in nine years, was the exotic
Aladdin in 1966.
During the ’60s, negative attention focused on mob influence in Las
Vegas. Of the 11 major casino hotels that had opened in the previous
decade, 10 were believed to have been financed with mob money. Then,
like a knight in shining armor, Howard Hughes rode into town and
embarked on a $300-million hotel- and property-buying spree, which
included the Desert Inn (in 1967). Hughes was as “bugsy” as Benjamin
Siegel any day, but his pristine reputation helped bring respectability to
the desert city and lessen its gangland stigma.
Las Vegas became a family destination in 1968, when Circus Circus burst
onto the scene with the world’s largest permanent circus and a “junior
casino” featuring dozens of carnival midway games on its mezzanine
level. In 1969, Elvis made a triumphant return to Las Vegas at the
International’s showroom and went on to become one of the city’s all-
time legendary performers. His fans had come of age.
Hoping to establish Las Vegas as “the Broadway of the West,” the
Thunderbird Hotel presented Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Flower Drum
Song. It was a smash hit. Soon The Riviera picked up Bye, Bye, Birdie,
and, as the decade progressed, Mame and The Odd Couple played at
Caesars Palace. While Broadway played the Strip, production shows
such as the Dunes’s Casino de Paris became ever more lavish, expensive,
and technically innovative.
The 1970s: Merv and magic
In 1971, the 500-room Union Plaza opened at the head of Fremont Street
on the site of the old Union Pacific Station. It had what was, at the time,
the world’s largest casino, and its showroom specialized in Broadway
productions. The same year, talk-show host Merv Griffin began taping at
Caesars Palace, taking advantage of a ready supply of local headliner
guests. He helped popularize Las Vegas even more by bringing it into
America’s living rooms every afternoon.
The year 1973 was eventful: Over at the Tropicana, illusionists extraordi-
naire Siegfried & Roy began turning women into tigers and themselves
into legends in the Folies Bergère.
Two major disasters hit Las Vegas in the 1970s. First, a flash flood devas-
tated the Strip, causing more than $1 million in damage. Second, gam-
bling was legalized in Atlantic City. Las Vegas’s hotel business slumped
as fickle tourists decided to check out the new East Coast gambling
mecca.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Las Vegas 17

As the decade drew to a close, an international arrivals building opened
at McCarran International Airport, and dollar slot machines caused a
sensation in the casinos.
The 1980s: The city erupts
As the ’80s began, Las Vegas was booming once again. McCarran Airport
began a 20-year, $785-million expansion program.
Siegfried & Roy were no longer just the star segment of various stage
spectaculars. Their own show, Beyond Belief, ran for six years at the
Frontier, playing a record-breaking 3,538 performances to sellout audi-
ences every night. It became the most successful attraction in the city’s
history.
In 1989, Steve Wynn made Las Vegas sit up and take notice. His gleaming
white-and-gold hotel The Mirage was fronted by five-story waterfalls,
lagoons, and lush tropical foliage — not to mention a 50-foot volcano
that dramatically erupted regularly! Wynn gave world-renowned illusion-
ists Siegfried & Roy carte blanche (and more than $30 million) to create
the most spellbinding show Las Vegas had ever seen.
The 1990s through today: King Arthur, 
King Tut, King Suite
The 1990s began with a blare of trumpets heralding the rise of a turreted
medieval castle fronted by a moated drawbridge and staffed by jousting
knights and fair damsels. Excalibur reflected the ’90s marketing trend to
promote Las Vegas as a family-vacation destination.
More sensational megahotels followed on the Strip, including the new
MGM Grand hotel, backed by a full theme park (it ended Excalibur’s
brief reign as the world’s largest resort), Luxor Las Vegas, and Steve
Wynn’s Treasure Island. And from this point to the present, hotels would
open, close, and implode and be rebuilt to dizzying new heights, over
and over, in a constant cycle of death and rebirth — Vegas-style.
In 1993, a unique pink-domed 5-acre indoor amusement park, Grand
Slam Canyon, became part of the Circus Circus hotel. In 1995, the
Fremont Street Experience was completed, revitalizing downtown Las
Vegas. Closer to the Strip, rock restaurant magnate Peter Morton opened
the Hard Rock Hotel, billed as “the world’s first rock ’n’ roll hotel and
casino.” The year 1996 saw the advent of the French Riviera–themed
Monte Carlo and the Stratosphere Casino Hotel & Tower, its 1,149-foot
tower the highest building west of the Mississippi. The unbelievable
New York-New York arrived in 1997.
But it all paled compared to what was to come in 1998–99. As Vegas
hastily repositioned itself from “family destination” to “luxury resort,”
several new hotels, once again eclipsing anything that had come before,
opened. Bellagio was the latest from Vegas visionary Steve Wynn, an
Part I: Introducing Las Vegas

attempt to bring grand European style to the desert, while at the far
southern end of the Strip, Mandalay Bay charmed. As if this weren’t
enough, The Venetian’s ambitious detailed re-creation of everyone’s
favorite Italian city came along in May 1999, and was followed in short
order by the opening of Paris Las Vegas in the fall of 1999.
The 21st century opened up with a bang as the Aladdin blew itself up
and gave itself a from-the-ground-up makeover — and then yet another
makeover into Planet Hollywood in 2006 — while Steve Wynn blew up
the Desert Inn to make room for a new showstopper, Wynn Las Vegas,
which opened in 2005. Everyone has expanded, with first the Luxor, then
Caesars, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, and Bellagio all adding new towers and
hundreds more rooms each. Both Wynn and the Venetian added enor-
mous expansions called Encore and Palazzo, respectively. If they aren’t
doing that, they are redoing rooms that just got makeovers a couple
years ago. Moguls keep bragging: Their hotel will be the biggest, most
expensive, most amazing ever seen. 
The catchphrase these days is “luxury resort.” Not content to simply
reverse the ill-considered “family destination” branding, the casino
hotels have, as much as possible, systematically stripped themselves of
their cartoonish themes. Public spaces and rooms have gradually turned
sleek and modern; handsome for sure, but also increasingly generic.
Each tries to out-do their neighbor with high end shopping, luxurious
spas, fancy beds and gourmet, celebrity-chef driven restaurants. 
Clearly, no one can rest on their laurels in Vegas, for this is not only a
city that never sleeps, but one in which the wheels of progress never
stop turning, even for a heartbeat. 
Building Blocks: Local Architecture
You don’t exactly get architecture in Vegas — more like set design. If
you’re a Frank Lloyd Wright aficionado, you may be appalled, but for the
rest of us, Vegas has a number of buildings that make your eyes bug out.
Las Vegas may well be the only city in the world where the skyline is
made up entirely of other cities, and even countries. New York, Egypt,
Paris, Venice — all are represented in the facades of extraordinary hotel-
resort complexes, behemoths of more than 3,000 rooms. And their
themes span the globe and the ages. Visit the Sphinx at Luxor, watch
sexy pirates battle at TI (formerly Treasure Island), ride a gondola
through The Venetian, take in a joust at Excalibur, ride a Coney Island
roller coaster at New York-New York, or climb the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Las Vegas. In other cities, the hotels are built near the tourist attrac-
tions. In Vegas, they are the tourist attractions. Makes things simple,
doesn’t it? And as awesome as the scene is in the daytime, it’s even more
spectacular at night, when the eye-popping lights assault your senses
and seem to turn night into day. We discuss hotels in more detail in
Chapter 9.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Las Vegas 19

Hail to the Chef
Vegas used to have a terrible reputation, which was richly deserved, for
really crappy food. No one minded that much, however, because the
prices were so cheap. The good news is, the quality has skyrocketed; the
bad news is, so have many of the prices. Vegas now has a restaurant
from many (if not most) of the celebrity chefs and name-brand eateries
in America, and it can stand proudly alongside more traditionally lauded
culinary cities. When the New York and Los Angeles Times food critics
fall all over themselves to salute a Vegas restaurant (specifically, multi-
ple Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon’s ventures at the MGM Grand), you
know something serious is up. Meanwhile, Thomas Keller, of French
Laundry (Napa Valley) and Per Se (New York City) fame, has a branch 
of his French bistro Bouchon, while Alain Ducasse opened up shop in
town, too. Too high-falutin’? How about that Emeril guy from the Food
Network? Bam! He has two restaurants in Vegas. You figure it’s too hard
to get into Spago in Los Angeles? Vegas has one of its own. Feast on
innovative Italian cuisine at Mario Batali’s B&B Ristorante, dine under
the works of the master at Picasso, or down vodka and caviar with aban-
don at Red Square. But if all you care about is stuffing yourself — and
hey, we’re right there with you — the famous Vegas buffets are still in
action, presenting each and every diner with enough food to feed a small
country, or at least several very hungry football teams. And if you crave
a Big Mac in the middle of the night, you can find it, and about a billion
(okay, maybe we’re exaggerating a little — but not by much) other fast-
food joints, spread all over town. Check out Chapter 10 for more infor-
mation on finding good eats, whatever your budget.
Oh, Craps!
You may have heard a vague rumor stating that there is gambling in
Vegas. Boy, is there ever. Get off the plane, and you see slot machines
right there in the airport, just waiting for you to lay your eager hands on
them. But don’t; the gambling odds at the airports are notoriously bad.
Try to control yourself; if we make one absolute promise to you in this
book, it’s that you will have ample time and opportunity to lose your
money. Casinos beckon with numerous games of chance, from blackjack
to poker to roulette.
Don’t kid yourself. Vegas has presented itself as many things over the
years (from adult playground to family destination and back again), and
it will come up with still more personas in years to come. But this desert
oasis was built for one purpose and one purpose only: to part you from
your money. Luckily, spending a little money can be a very enjoyable
thing, if you, er, play your cards right. (And with some luck and a peek at
Chapter 11 for gambling tips, we hope that you do.)

Ditching the Glitz
Las Vegas is designed to make visitors forget about the outside world
and such mundane matters as their bank balances. And it does its
designers proud. Nevertheless, you may find yourself yearning for some-
thing a little less artificial after a few days of sensory overload. And
ditching town for a bit probably won’t hurt that bank balance either.
None of Las Vegas’s monumental hotels would exist without the modern
marvel that is Hoover Dam. Just 30 miles outside the city, this feat 
of engineering provides the juice that keeps Las Vegas’s cash cows 
running.
For those who want to keep their bodies up and running, numerous
recreational opportunities — from swimming to hiking — await visitors
at Lake Mead. And for sheer natural beauty, you can’t beat the almost
otherworldly terrain of Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire State Park.
A day trip out of town doesn’t mean that you run out of spectacles to
see, but natural wonders tend to be more restful than blinking lights and
feathered showgirls (for most people anyway). If you want to schedule
your hiatus from the hype right away, head over to Chapter 15.
Crooners, Giggles, and Jiggles
Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack buddies made Vegas the hot destination.
By the time Elvis established himself as a regular performer, Vegas
shows were legendary. While those glamour days are somewhat in the
past, top performers still consider Vegas a must-stop. At any given time,
you can see a number of big-production shows, ranging from the exqui-
site artistry of the Cirque du Soleil to the high-kicking showgirls of
Jubilee! and a host of other options — renowned magicians, comedians,
and free lounge singers and bands. And yes, the topless revues, while no
longer the main attraction, still have their place. If you want to dig right
in and find out what shows are waiting for you, jump to Chapter 16.
And if sweating it out on the dance floor is more to your taste, Las
Vegas’s club scene will more than satisfy your appetite. Sashay your way
into the city’s appropriately snooty rendition of the legendary Studio 54,
down almost any kind of rum concoction you can imagine as you dance
the night away at rumjungle, rub elbows with the beautiful and the size
zeroes at ghostbar, oogle burlesque gals at Tangerine and Forty Deuce.
Or see if any of the “ultra-lounges” (featuring such tantalizing names like
Tabu) really are all that sinfully fun. If we can offer one sure bet when it
comes to Sin City’s after-dark action, it’s that you find at least one club
that caters to your demographic. If you want to delve further into the
club and bar scene, check out Chapter 17.

Sin City Celebrated: Recommended 
Books and Movies
Vegas is used as the backdrop, and even supporting player, in many a
movie. The most famous is that Rat Pack platform, Ocean’s 11, and
while lacking that same zing, the quite successful remake with Brad 
Pitt and George Clooney (with 2007’s Ocean’s 13 sequel returning to
Vegas). But who could forget Robert Redford’s various, surely not civic-
supported, shenanigans as he tries to win Demi Moore in Indecent
Proposal, and steal a horse in The Electric Horseman? Vegas movies
rarely provide good role models, from the bad craziness in Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas, to the mobster activity in Bugsy and Casino,
and to Nicholas Cage’s attempts to drink himself to death in the com-
pany of a hooker in Leaving Las Vegas. But nothing beats the sheer
misery and delight of that bomb of bombshells, Showgirls. Let’s
counter all that with some Vegas good times, like the Flying Elvii of
Honeymoon in Vegas, the Griswold family antics in Vegas Vacation,
and the mystical beauty of the entirely soundstage-built Vegas of
Coppola’s One From the Heart.
With Vegas in literature, it used to be that you needn’t go any further
than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (Random House), in which
Hunter S. Thompson and his lawyer go gonzo and take on the town. 
(The town didn’t stand a chance.) But recently, there have been a spate
of excellent non-fiction books about the town. Veteran reporter Marc
Cooper examines Las Vegas and his own fascination with it in The Last
Honest Place in America (Nation Books). In Bringing Down the House
(Free Press), author Ben Mezrich gives a riveting account of how six MIT
students figured out how to beat blackjack — and made off with millions
before they got caught. In Positively Fifth Street (Farrar, Straus, and
Giroux), author James McManus came to report on the World Series of
Poker, and stayed to play. And nearly won. Author Andres Martinez
didn’t, but that wasn’t his goal. He wanted to spend his entire $50,000
book advance gambling, and he did, and wrote about it in 24/7: Living It
Up and Doubling Down (Villard Books).
But even though you couldn’t really make something like Vegas up, it’s
too much of a town of myth and fantasy to stick to hard facts. In addition
to Thompson’s book (oh, come on; it’s not entirely fact-based), try John
O’Brien’s Leaving Las Vegas (Grove Press) — though remember, it’s not
a happy story, to say the least. Recent Vegas short stories are collected
in In the Shadow of the Strip (University of Nevada Press), edited by
Richard Logsdon. Follow the saga of written Vegas via the carefully
chosen and endlessly revealing excerpts in Literary Las Vegas (Henry
Holt & Company), edited by Mike Tronnes.

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Considering the pros and cons of each season
 Checking out a calendar of special events
B
y most standards, Las Vegas remains a busy town throughout the
year, but certain seasons hold advantages over others. Deciding
when to take your trip may affect how much you pay, what you’re able
to see, and how crowded the gambling tables will be. In this chapter, we
analyze the advantages and disadvantages of visiting during various
times of the year so that you can decide on the time of year that works
best for you. You can also turn to Chapter 9 to find some handy
resources to help you discover what’s going on and when.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Las Vegas is a year-round city. While the weather can be tricky and
strange, you aren’t going to get blizzards or tons of rain or other fun-
dampening problems. Sure, it can get hot — oh, man, can it! — but that’s
why they invented swimming pools and air conditioning, both of which
are found in Vegas in abundance (see Table 3-1 for average temperatures
in Las Vegas). But, because it’s a year-round city, you may find that when
it’s off season for other popular tourist destinations, Vegas’s hotel rooms
may be full thanks to conventions, a highly publicized boxing match, or
some other crowd-drawing event.
Do remember that weekdays here are considerably less crowded than
weekends, which means that you’re likely to find the best hotel rates on
weekdays.
Flip to the section “Vegas Calendar of Events,” at the end of this chapter,
to find out how you can plan for — or around — all the festivities
throughout the year.
Spending springtime in Vegas
Spring is a popular vacation time for most travelers, and Vegas is no dif-
ferent. Some of the best reasons to go to Vegas in the springtime follow:

 It’s not hot yet!
 Kids are still in school, so adults have the run of this most adult of
destinations.
 It’s a good time to go hiking in Red Rock Canyon, where the wild-
flowers will be blooming. (If you want to find out more about out-of-
town excursions, go to Chapter 15.)
But keep in mind the following springtime pitfalls:
 Just because it’s not hot doesn’t mean that the weather is necessar-
ily nice. Strong winds can blow, making lying by the pool a nasty
adventure and producing cold nights. And it can rain. (One year, a
heavy downpour put so much water on the Strip, that people were
using rowboats!)
 Some production shows take time off during the spring to rest up.
See Chapter 16 for more information on finding schedules for these
events.
Heating up with the summer scene
Another popular travel time is summer. Ahhh, summer. The lazy days
and quiet nights. . . . Well, not in Vegas! Vegas is a bustling metropolis at
all times of the year, and summer is no different. Here are some points to
consider:
 It may be hot, but at least it’s not humid. Yes, dry heat really does
feel less stifling!
 June and July are traditionally among the slowest times of the year,
meaning smaller crowds and often much better hotel rates.
 All those wonderful hotel pools are fully open and operational, as is
the city’s water park.
But, again, keep in mind the following:
 It gets really stinkin’ hot in the summer. Like 118°F hot (see Table 3-1
for average temperatures in Las Vegas).
 Between conventions, family vacations, and savvy travelers, it’s
rapidly becoming as popular a time to go as any other.
 Did we mention that it gets really hot in the summer?
 Because of the heat, everyone is at the pool (even though it’s prob-
ably too hot to stay outside for long), making the pool areas less
peaceful and more party-hearty.
 School is out, and the Strip is swarming with kids who don’t have
that much to keep them occupied.

Enjoying fall in the desert
In our opinion, fall is a beautiful time of year — no matter where you are.
Here are some autumn bonuses for the Las Vegas scene:
 You get the best weather in the fall; still warm enough to swim, but
not so hot that you want to shrivel up and die.
 The kids are back in school, and adults have the city to themselves
again.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 25
Wild weather
Las Vegas rests in the middle of a desert, so how wacky can the weather possibly get?
A lot crazier than you think. Although Las Vegas’s location results in broiling-hot tem-
peratures in the summer, many people tend to forget that deserts get cold and rained on.
Winter temperatures in Las Vegas have been known to dip below 30°F, and when you
toss in 40 mph winds, that adds up to a very chilly stroll on the Strip. And snow is not
an unheard-of occurrence. Most years see a flurry or two falling on Las Vegas, and
since 1949, a total of 11 “storms” have resulted in accumulations of 2 inches or greater,
with the largest storm pouring 9 inches onto the Strip in January 1949. In December
of 2003, parts of Las Vegas got 6 inches of the white stuff and although it didn’t stick
around too long on The Strip, the sight of the famous “Welcome to Fabulous Las
Vegas” sign in the middle of a driving blizzard was quite a spectacle. There was a light
dusting as recently as early 2007. Locals usually find the snow a charming addition to
the city (and the stuff melts completely in a day or two, if not in minutes, so they don’t
have to shovel it — lucky them).
But although snow is a novel quirk that many Vegas residents and visitors welcome,
rain isn’t always as well received. The soil in Las Vegas is parched most of the year,
making it difficult for the land to absorb large amounts of water coming down in a short
time. Between June and August, when most of the area’s rainfall takes place, there is
a good possibility of flash flooding.
At times, the skies open up and don’t shut down, resulting in flooding that wreaks
havoc on Sin City. On July 9, 1999, Mother Nature unleashed more than 3 inches of
rain in just a few hours on a city that averages about 4 inches of rain a year. The deluge
killed two people, swamped hundreds of cars, and destroyed millions of dollars in prop-
erty. As the Strip turned into a raging river, tourists took refuge in the hotels, but at
least one resort — Caesars Palace — had to close its casino and shopping arcade
because of flooding.
Las Vegas also suffered devastating floods in 1975 and 1984 The city continues to work
on putting in a multi-billion-dollar flood-control system to prevent further large-scale
disasters, but it will be several years before it’s fully operational. In the meantime, vis-
itors can console themselves with the knowledge that, historically, a really bad flood
only comes along every 10 to 15 years. Of course, that means another such flood is
due from 2009 onwards. Oops. 

Some things to look out for, however:
 Several major trade shows and events bring out the convention
types, so watch out for scarce room availability and high rates.
 Beware of unpredictable September or October Indian-summer
heat waves (don’t forget the summer duds and sunscreen — just in
case!).
Wintering in the West
Winter brings visions of softly falling snowflakes (and slick roads and
salt trucks) to most travelers. But that’s not often the case in Las Vegas.
You should consider the following when planning a winter vacation in
Vegas:
 Next to June and July, the week before Christmas and the week
after New Year’s are the two slowest times of the year. In fact,
December generally isn’t a bad month for crowds.
 Hotel prices sink during the slowest weeks of the winter, making it
much easier to get a good room at a great rate.
Winter does have its downside, however. Consider the following:
 Tourists are quickly catching on to the fact that winter travel is
slower in Vegas, so eventually those cold months may become as
crowded as any other.
 Desert winters can get surprisingly cold — some years, you may
even see snowfall! (As they did as recently as early 2007. Ah, the
snowfall on the Eiffel Tower.)
 Because the weather is nippy, hotels (assuming fewer people want
to swim) may close part or all their pool areas for maintenance 
purposes.
 It’s the other time of year (along with springtime) when shows can
close for a week; hey, performers need vacations, too.
 New Year’s Eve crowds in Vegas are starting to rival those in New
York’s Times Square, and Valentine’s Day brings waves of people to
town looking for a romantic quickie wedding.
 The biggest convention to hit town, the Consumer Electronics
Show, is held during this season.
 And don’t forget the Super Bowl, the NCAA’s March Madness, and
the NASCAR Nextel Championship, all of which bring out the
sports-book gamblers (see the section “Checking Out the Las Vegas
Calendar of Events,” later in this chapter, for more details).

Managing Your Money

 Protecting yourself against thievery
O
nce upon a time — last week, it seems to us — Las Vegas had a rep-
utation for being a cheap vacation. The theory held that if rooms
and food were cheap (if not free) and shows were bargains, then patrons
would feel more comfortable spending lots of money gambling. Even if
they lost their shirts, the reasoning went, they would think, “Well, but
my room was free, and I ate myself into a coma at the buffet for $2, so
really, the trip was a bargain!” Buoyed by such feelings of good will, a
repeat visit was thus ensured.
If that is the picture you have of Vegas, wipe it from your mind. This
town has massive casino hotel resorts to pay for. See those chandeliers
up there? Enjoy them — you’re gonna pay for them. Here we show you
the best inexpensive and high-end options in all the important travel cat-
egories so that you can decide where you want to spend your money —
and it’s just fine with us if that place is the craps table.
Planning Your Budget
Budgeting your trip shouldn’t be difficult — as long as you remember
that Las Vegas was designed to lighten your wallet and does an excellent
job of it.
Lodging
This is a tricky thing in Vegas. The same hotel room can go for $49
(because, say, it’s a summer weekday) on one night, and then, on the
very next day, go for $350 (because a huge convention just started, or
it’s Super Bowl weekend). Consequently, giving you an “average” rate
can be difficult, although you can figure on spending around $150 per
night based on double occupancy. (Though again, if you plan your trip
right and aren’t too picky about where you stay, you can spend as little

as half that, even on the Strip.) You can spend significantly more or less,
depending on what you’re looking for. The higher profile a hotel is, the
more it’s going to cost. So for the fancy theme resorts, figure at least
$200 for a double. If you can get into the Mirage, for example, for less
(and, surprisingly, you often can), that’s a good deal. See Chapter 9 for a
listing of great hotels.
Transportation
We suggest that you rent a car in Vegas (see Chapter 8 for more informa-
tion). Although the traffic is terrible, which can make driving a chore, it’s
still better than paying ridiculous taxi rates or relying on the limited
public transportation. You can walk — everywhere is flat, and just about
everything is in a straight line — but it’s not the most pleasant activity,
particularly on a hot summer day. Parking is free and ample, and nearly
every hotel has free valet parking (tip the nice folks $1; they will often
have your air-conditioning already going when you get in). Plan on
spending about $40 a day for a rental car. Having said all that, the new
monorail (occasional breakdowns and those sometimes inconveniently
placed stops notwithstanding) should be a fun alternative to that long
hot walk on the Strip, even if it’s not bargain-priced.
Dining
The good news is that Vegas has had a boom in world-class restaurants.
The bad news is this boom has happened only in the high-end restau-
rants. Most of the places we feel most comfortable recommending, in
terms of quality, are costly — upwards of $100 per person, and that’s
before alcohol. You can certainly dine more cheaply; there are still a few
inexpensive (under $15) all-you-can-eat buffets and “meal deals” ($7.99
complete steak dinners), but those don’t make for particularly memorable
dining experiences. We suggest trying a little of both; have one great
expensive meal, and then seek out the cheaper options. Plan on spending
anywhere from $50 to $70 a day per person for food. The truly frugal and
those with humble tastes can do just fine on about $35 per day.
Attractions
Wonderfully, this town has a number of free attractions. The hotels them-
selves, of course, are the main sights of interest, and several of them (The
Mirage, TI, MGM Grand, Rio, Bellagio, WynnLasVegas) have free shows
and attractions. And it costs nothing to watch the curiously entertaining
spectacle of other people risking their cash inside the casinos.
Unfortunately, most of the other attractions in town, while not expensive
in terms of actual cost, are overpriced for what they are. (For example,
the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art consists of just one or two rooms but
costs more than the entrance fee to the bigger-than-big Louvre museum!)
And only a handful of these overpriced attractions are oughta-do’s (see
Chapter 12) — good places to scratch that “I need some relief from 
gambling/I need to distract the kids” itch.

Shopping
This is one area where you can save oodles on your vacation bill.
Although Vegas has lots of shopping opportunities, it’s mostly of the
same variety you can find anywhere. Some of the major stores here are
attractions in their own right — the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace and
Grand Canal Shoppes, to name a couple — so they’re perfect places to
stroll if you’d rather browse than buy. If you’re the type who can’t come
back from a vacation without having made a major purchase, you can
find some cool places to spend your money, as well as some outlet cen-
ters that offer bargain-basement merchandise. See Chapter 13 for shop-
ping suggestions.
Entertainment
Here is another place where you can stretch your budget. You need
never spend any money on nightlife, yet you can still have nightlife. Most
casinos offer free drinks to gamblers, even if they aren’t spending much
of anything; and every hotel has at least one lounge with free live music
nightly.
We think that you ought to see any of the astounding Cirque du Soleil
shows, because they are so memorable; but tickets cost from $69 to $150.
You can, however, find cheaper shows ranging from about $15 to $75.
Superstars of the music world put Vegas on their tour schedules regu-
larly, with everyone from Madonna to The Rolling Stones rolling into
town at venues both huge (the 15,000 seat MGM Grand Garden Arena)
and intimate (a few hundred at Boulder Station’s Railhead). Tickets for
the big name acts, unsurprisingly, will set you back hundreds of dollars,
but you can often catch nostalgia (otherwise known as “has beens”) acts
at smaller halls around town for under $50.
If you want to see comedy headliners, such as Rita Rudner, tickets will
average $35 to $65. If you don’t care where you get your laughs, a ticket
to one of Las Vegas’s many comedy clubs will set you back approxi-
mately $20 (and that may even include a few drinks).
Cover charges for the city’s dance clubs range from free (Cleopatra’s
Barge Nightclub at Caesars) to the ridiculously priced (Bank at the
Bellagio). Half of you will be happy to know, however, that sexism (of a
sort) still reigns in Sin City; women — even at the high-priced clubs —
invariably pay a cheaper cover than men (and sometimes, no cover at
all). Don’t forget to tack on the price of the alcohol that you may con-
sume while partying the night away; the possible damage too many
drinks can do to your wallet (especially at expensive, hot-spot-of-the-
moment clubs) should be enough to spur you to limit your alcohol
intake. 
Lastly, if you plan to sample the city’s famous (or infamous) strip clubs,
you’ll have to cough up a cover charge of at least $10. And if you want to
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 35

get up-close-and-personal service, keep in mind that lap dances start at
$20 and escalate from there. A few too many of those, and you’ll strip-
mine your wallet in no time.
Gambling
And then there is gambling. How much should you budget for gambling?
Figure out how much you can afford to lose. That’s right — assume that
you are going to lose every penny; and if you don’t, count yourself lucky.
If you come back with the same amount you brought, you are very lucky.
And if you come back with more, well, break out the champagne and
enjoy it, because it probably won’t happen again.
When gambling, it’s best to make your goal not so much to win, but to
make your money last as long as possible. If you blow it all in the first
hour, that’s no fun at all. If you plop your last quarter in a slot at the air-
port on your way home, you can pat yourself on the back. Remember
that gambling is entertainment, not a way to raise funds.

Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
You can conserve your cash in more than just a couple of ways when
you vacation in Las Vegas. Use these tips to keep your vacation costs
manageable:
 Go during the off season. If you can travel at nonpeak times
(notably summer), you’ll find that hotel prices are significantly
reduced from prices in peak months.
 Travel on off-days of the week. Airfares vary depending on the day
of the week and the time of day. If you can travel on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your des-
tination. When you inquire about airfares, ask if you can get a
cheaper rate by flying on a different day or at a different time of
day. Also, keep in mind that hotel rates in Las Vegas tend to be
cheaper on weekdays than on weekends.
 Try a package tour. You can book flights, hotels, ground trans-
portation, and even some sightseeing just by making one call to a
travel agent or packager, and it may cost a lot less than if you try to
put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 5 for specific compa-
nies to call.)
 Surf the Web. Airlines and hotels often have special Internet-only
rates that are appreciably cheaper than rates quoted over the
phone. Also, you can find good comprehensive packages online.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for dis-
counted rates on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even
meals. Ask about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask if your kids can stay in your room with you. A room with two
double beds usually costs the same as a room with a queen-size
bed. Some hotels, though their numbers are shrinking, don’t charge
you the additional-person rate if the additional person is pint-size
and related to you. Even if you have to pay $20 or $35 for the extra
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 37

person charge and/or a rollaway bed, you save hundreds by not
taking two rooms (and you can keep a closer eye on your little
scamps).
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. If you want
to try a top restaurant (see Chapter 10 for some of the best), con-
sider having lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs are usually much
cheaper, and the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories should
be the best mementos of your trip. If you’re worried about money,
you can do without the T-shirts, key chains, Elvis salt-and-pepper
shakers, fuzzy dice for your dashboard, and other trinkets.
 Grab every free tourist magazine that you can get your hands on.
You can find these little gems in all Las Vegas hotel rooms and in
hotel lobbies. They often contain valuable coupons for restaurant
and attraction savings. (Feel free to skip the X-rated ones that solic-
itors try to push off on you in the streets!)
 Dine out. Try to eat outside your hotel whenever possible. The
giant hotel complexes figure that you are a captive audience; even
when they do provide more moderately priced food, you’ll usually
have to wait in long lines. The usual chain suspects (fast-food joints
and so on) are all over town; and although the food’s not terribly
interesting, it’s certainly more budget-minded. Many of the lower-
profile hotels also offer late-night meal deals (steak dinners for $6,
full breakfasts for $3, prime rib meals for $9.99, and so forth). 
They may mean eating at strange hours, but they are worth taking
advantage of.
 Don’t gamble your life savings away. Really, the biggest budget
pitfall for the Vegas visitor is the gambling. If you get that gleam in
your eye when you’re near a blackjack table and have a hard time
exercising self-restraint, try leaving your ATM card at home or in
your hotel room and carrying only as much cash as you’re willing
to lose.
Using Paper, Plastic, or Pocket Change
You can choose from a number of options to pay for your vacation
(including meals, souvenirs, and so on). In this section, we explore the
available options to help you determine the one that’s right for you.
Relying on ATMs
One thing you can count on in Las Vegas is the ability to get ready cash.
Each and every casino owner wants you to have easy access to your
money so that you can fork it over to them. After all, if you run out of
cash and can’t use your ATM card at 3 a.m., you can’t drop any more
quarters in that Double Diamond slot machine that you’re just sure is
going to pay off big at any moment. 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas 
38

There are cash machines every 5 feet in Las Vegas, which is mighty con-
venient. However, they clip you $2 or more for each transaction. Also
keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is used
at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for international
transactions (up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones (where they’re
average $1.50 but can be $2 or more). On top of this, the bank from
which you withdraw cash may charge its own fee. To compare banks’
ATM fees within the U.S., use www.bankrate.com. For international with-
drawal fees, ask your bank. Try to anticipate your cash needs to cut
down on the number of trips you’ll make to the ATM; it will leave you
with more cash to hand over to those other one-armed bandits.
Cirrus (% 800-424-7787) and Plus (% 800-843-7587) are the two most
popular ATM networks; check the back of your ATM card to find out
what network your bank is affiliated with. (The toll-free numbers also
provide ATM locations where you can withdraw money.) It’s always a
good idea to find out what your per-day withdrawal limit is before you
leave home.
Some of you may be in the habit of carrying cash when you’re on vaca-
tion. We really can’t recommend carting more than 1 to 2 days’ worth of
money around with you in Las Vegas. Although security in the casinos is
tight, pickpocketing on the Strip is the crime of choice. When you con-
sider how easy it is to access an ATM, there’s no reason to tote a wad of
cash. (Just be sure to factor in the additional charges at the machines.)
If you do choose to carry cash, make certain that you never flash it
around; you may attract the wrong kind of attention.
Charging up a storm
Traveling with credit cards is a safe alternative to carrying cash. Credit
cards also provide you with a record of your vacation expenses after you
return home. Plus, foreign travelers get a better exchange rate. You can
also get cash advances with your credit cards at any bank (although you
start paying interest on the advance the moment you receive the cash,
and you don’t receive frequent-flier miles on an airline credit card). At
most banks, you don’t even need to go to a teller; you can get a cash
advance at the ATM if you know your PIN (personal identification
number). If you forgot your PIN or didn’t even know you had one, call
the phone number on the back of your credit card and ask the bank to
send it to you. It usually takes five to seven business days, although
some banks will do it over the phone if you tell them your mother’s
maiden name or give them some other security clearance.
Most casinos make it easy to get a cash advance with your credit card.
Isn’t that nice of them? The problem is that they charge outrageous pro-
cessing fees — usually 7 to 10 percent of the amount you are advancing
($200 costs you an additional $16, on top of what your card will charge
you in interest). Don’t do it!
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 39

Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you will likely be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own. If you’re withdrawing money
every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — provided that
you don’t mind showing identification every time you want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 to 4 percent You can
also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling
% 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use this
number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 and 2 per-
cent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000.
Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain Visa
checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-3378.
MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for a
location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Keeping Your Money Safe (And 
What to Do If It’s Stolen)
Vast amounts of money are always on display in Vegas, and crooks find
lots of easy marks. Don’t be one of them. Here are some tips to help you
avoid this agonizing situation (or at least ease the pain if it happens
anyway):
 Don’t depend on hotel security to look out for your property. At
gaming tables and slot machines, men should keep their wallets
well-concealed and out of the reach of pickpockets (the front pants
pocket is a good place), and women should keep their purses in
view (preferably on their laps) at all times. A thief can easily swipe a
purse that is sitting at your feet, whether you are at a bar or a slot
machine. Thieves are just waiting for you to become so entranced
with your game that you let your guard down, so don’t let it happen.
 Men and women should both be careful about how and where they
carry their cash. Whether inside the casinos or strolling the Strip,
women should always keep their purses slung diagonally across
their chests, preferably under a jacket. The best kind of purse to
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas 
40

take is one that folds over rather than one that just has a zipper on
top. Do not sling your purse or camera over your chair when you’re
in a restaurant. Ideally, men should use a money belt or a fanny
pack to store cash, credit cards, and traveler’s checks.
 If your hotel has an in-room safe, use it. Stash excess cash, trav-
eler’s checks, and any other valuables that you don’t need for
immediate use. If your hotel room doesn’t have a safe, put your
valuables and cash inside the hotel’s safety deposit box. In general,
the best policy is to use an ATM and only withdraw the amount 
of money you’ll need to cover your expenses for about two days 
at a time.
 If you do win a big jackpot in the casinos, ask the pit boss or slot
person to cut you a check rather than give you your winnings in
cash. The cash may look cool, but flashing it around sends the
wrong signals to the wrong kind of people.
 Almost every credit card company has a toll-free emergency
number that you can call if your cards are lost or stolen. The credit
card company may be able to wire you a cash advance off your
credit card immediately, and it can often get you an emergency
credit card within a day or two.
The issuing bank’s toll-free number is usually printed on the back
of the credit card. Make note of this number before you leave on
your trip and stash it somewhere other than your wallet. If you
forget to write down the number, you can call % 800-555-1212 —
that’s 800 directory assistance — to get the number. Citicorp
Visa’s U.S. emergency number is % 800-847-2911. American
Express cardholders should call % 800-441-0519, and traveler’s-
check carriers need to call % 800-221-7282 for all money emergen-
cies. MasterCard holders must call % 800-MC-ASSIST.
 If you opt to carry traveler’s checks, make sure that you keep a
record of their serial numbers in a safe location so that you can
handle an emergency. Traveler’s checks can be somewhat cumber-
some; considering the number of ATMs in Vegas, they’re probably
unnecessary. Nevertheless, they are the safest way to carry large
amounts of cash (although we don’t recommend that). After you
buy them, record the checks’ serial numbers and keep that list in a
separate location from the checks. It’s also a good idea to leave the
serial numbers with a relative back home. Should your checks be
stolen, call the issuer, give the serial numbers, and ask for instruc-
tions on getting your checks replaced.
 If your wallet disappears despite your best efforts, you’re not likely
to recover it. The police, while having the best of intentions, proba-
bly can’t help either. But when you realize that your wallet is 
gone and cancel your credit cards, you should still call the police.
You may need their report number for credit card or insurance 
purposes.

most isolated metropolis in the United States.
Because there is no train service to Las Vegas, you either have to fly or
drive to reach the city. Without further ado, read this chapter to find out
your traveling options — somewhere out there is a roulette table with
your name on it!
Flying to Las Vegas
As we will discuss later, a package tour can be just dandy for some folks.
But others wouldn’t dream of letting anyone else plan their trip. If you’re
a do-it-yourselfer, the following information can help you plot the perfect
trip all on your own.
Finding an airline
The following airlines have regularly scheduled flights into Las Vegas
(some of these are regional carriers, so they all may not fly from your
point of origin): AeroMexico (% 800-237-6639; www.aeromexico.com);
Air Canada (% 800-776-3000; www.aircanada.ca); Alaska Airlines
(% 800-426-0333; www.alaskaair.com); Allegiant Air (% 877-202-6444;
www.allegiant-air.com); America West (% 800-235-9292; www.
americawest.com),); American-American Eagle (% 800-433-7300;
www.aa.com); Continental (% 800-525-0280; www.continental.com);
Delta-Skywest (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com); Frontier Airlines 
(% 800-432-1359; www.flyfrontier.com); Hawaiian Airlines (% 800-
367-5320; www.hawaiianair.com); Japan Airlines (% 800-525-3663;
www.jal.co.jp/en); JetBlue (% 800-538-2583; www.jetblue.com);
Mexicana Airlines (% 800-531-7921; www.mexicana.com); Midwest
Airlines (% 800-452-2022; www.midwestairlines.com); Northwest

(% 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com); Southwest (% 800-435-9792;
www.southwest.com); Spirit Airlines (% 800-772-7117; www.spirit
air.com); United (% 800-241-6522; www.united.com); US Airways
(% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com); and Virgin Atlantic Airways
(% 800-862-8621; www.virgin-atlantic.com).
Getting the best airfare
These days, with a little know-how and advance planning, the independ-
ent traveler should have no trouble snagging a deal on airline tickets.
Through the Internet alone, consumers have more options than ever
before in locating the best airfares, whether from airline Web sites or
online travel and booking sites such as Travelocity (see the next section,
“Booking your ticket online”). Here are some tips on how to get the best
prices on airline tickets.
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. A coach seat is virtually the same from one carrier to another
(you know: small, cramped, and basically uncomfortable), yet the differ-
ence in price may run as high as $1,000. If you’re a business traveler and
need the flexibility to purchase your tickets at the last minute or change
your itinerary at a moment’s notice, or want to get home before the
weekend, you wind up paying the premium rate (known as the full fare).
If you don’t require this level of flexibility, you can probably get a better
deal. Consider the following:
 Plan ahead. On most flights, even the shortest hops, the full fare is
close to $1,000 or more, but a 7-day or 14-day advance-purchase
ticket is closer to $200 to $300. Keep an eye on Southwest: Two
months or so in advance, they often offer one-way tickets to Vegas
from Los Angeles for as little as $49 or $59.
 Be flexible about the dates you travel. You can often get a bargain-
basement deal (usually a fraction of the full fare) if you can book
your ticket long in advance, don’t mind staying over Saturday night,
are willing to travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, or are
willing to travel during less-trafficked hours.
 Check out consolidators. Also known as bucket shops, consolida-
tors are a good place to check for the lowest fares. Their prices are
much better than the fares you can get yourself and are often even
lower than what your travel agent can get you. You see their ads in
the small boxes at the bottom of the page in your Sunday newspa-
per’s travel section.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the
Net. STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the
world’s leader in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all
ages. FlyCheap (% 800-FLY-CHEAP; www.1800flycheap.com) is
owned by package-holiday megalith MyTravel and so has especially
good access to fares for sunny destinations. Air Tickets Direct
(% 888-858-8884; www.airticketsdirect.com) is based in
Chapter 5: Getting to Las Vegas 43

Montreal and leverages the currently weak Canadian dollar for 
low fares.
 Look for sales. Don’t forget that the airlines periodically lower the
prices on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-
purchase requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you
can’t beat the price: usually no more than $400 for a cross-country
flight. To take advantage of these airline sales, watch for ads in
your local newspaper and on TV and radio, and call the airlines or
check out their Web sites.
These fare sales tend to take place during seasons of low travel
volume. You rarely see a sale around Thanksgiving or Christmas,
when people are more willing to pay a premium.
Booking your ticket online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an E-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available 
to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a
browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality
only beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
While not as widely available as they once were, great last-minute deals
are available through free weekly E-mail services provided directly by
the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on Tuesday or Wednesday
and must be purchased online. Most are only valid for travel that week-
end, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be booked weeks or months in
advance. Sign up for weekly E-mail alerts at airline Web sites or check
mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials,
such as Smarter Living (smarterliving.com). For last-minute trips,
www.site59.com in the U.S. and www.lastminute.com in Europe often
have better deals than the major-label sites. 
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia
to Chicago via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or
11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to
play their “name our price” game. Note: In 2004, Priceline added
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas 
44

nonopaque service to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact
flights, times, and airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque
fares as before.
Hit the Road, Jack!
Getting there is often half the fun. If you’re one of those folks who wants
to put the pedal to the metal and the rubber to the road (even if it means
having a longer journey), you may enjoy driving to Vegas.
If you plan on hitting the highway, keep in mind that AAA (% 800-222-
4357; www.aaa.com) and some other automobile clubs offer free 
maps and optimum driving directions to their members. On the Internet,
MapQuest (www.mapquest.com) provides free driving directions, and 
it even gives step-by-step maps to help those of us with no sense of
direction.
Watching the weather
Be sure to check out the weather forecast before setting out on your
journey: A snowstorm approaching through the Rockies or a heat wave
across the Southwest may cause you to reconsider your travel route. If
your local TV station or newspaper doesn’t give you enough informa-
tion, check out the Weather Channel on cable, or on the Web at www.
weather.com. The channel also offers a 24-hour weather hotline 
(% 1-900-WEATHER), which costs 95¢ per minute.
Planning your route
Las Vegas is located on the southern tip of Nevada right along Interstate
15, the major north-south route from Los Angeles to the Canadian border.
I-15 actually runs through the city, past downtown, and less than a mile
from the famed Vegas Strip.
You should check with a reliable source before actually planning your
route (unless you’re in no hurry and just want to ramble along), but the
following are some good choices from some of the major U.S. regions:
 California: If you’re coming from Northern or Central California,
consider taking Highway 99 from Sacramento to Highway 58 in
Bakersfield, which will take you to I-15 in Barstow. Portions of that
route are still a two-lane, undivided highway, but most of the trip is
freeway-style driving. From Southern California, take I-15 all the
way. And remember, everyone comes back from a weekend in Vegas
on Sunday afternoon/early evening, something you should avoid
doing, if at all possible. Otherwise, pack snacks; your five-hour
drive could turn into nine. (This problem may be increased during
highway construction that will turn the two lanes of I-15 into three,
but when those are in place, travel should move faster than ever.)

Highway Access to Las Vegas
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas 
46

 Upper Midwest: If you’re coming from the upper Midwest, your
best bet is probably I-80, which stretches from Pennsylvania all the
way to San Francisco. It may not be an extremely scenic drive, but
it’s the safest and fastest route to the point where it intersects with
I-15 in Utah. Another option is I-70, which runs from Missouri to I-15
in Utah.
 The Great Northwest: The best way to travel from the Northwest is
probably I-84 running from Oregon to I-15 in Utah.
 The Scenic Route: If you’re coming from anywhere east of Las
Vegas, you may get your kicks by taking historic Route 66. Parts of
this route have been replaced by interstates, but for the most part,
it still meanders from Chicago to Los Angeles, offering more than
2,000 miles of beautiful Americana. You can take it all the way to
Kingman, Arizona, where you hook up with Highway 93. This road
takes you past the famous Hoover Dam (see Chapter 15 for more
information on the Hoover Dam and other side trips) and then right
into Las Vegas. You can’t beat it if you have the time or a sense of
wanderlust!
Choosing a Package Tour
Package tours, put simply, are a way of buying your airfare, accommoda-
tions, and the other elements of your trip (such as car rentals, airport
transfers, and sometimes even activities) in one fell swoop, and often at
discounted prices. It’s probably a good bet for a popular destination
such as Las Vegas. In many cases, you pay less for a package that
includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to and from the airport than
you pay for the hotel alone if you book it yourself. The reasoning is
simple: Packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, who resell them to
the public.
It’s kind of like buying your vacation at Sam’s Club — except the tour
operator is the one who buys the 1,000-count box of garbage bags and
resells them at a cost that undercuts what you’d pay at your average
neighborhood supermarket.
Package tours can vary by leaps and bounds, however. Some offer a
better class of hotels than others. Some offer the same hotels for lower
prices. Some offer flights on scheduled airlines, while others book char-
ters. Some even limit your choice of accommodations and travel days.
The upshot here is you can make sure that you get what you want at a
price you are comfortable with.
A great starting point when looking for a package deal is the travel sec-
tion of your local Sunday newspaper. Also check the ads in the back of
national travel magazines, such as Travel & Leisure, National Geographic
Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler. Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584;
www.libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the
Chapter 5: Getting to Las Vegas 47

Northeast, and it usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
American Express Vacations (% 800-346-3607; www.americanexpress.
com/travel) is another option.
Don’t forget another good resource: the airlines themselves! They often
package their flights together with accommodations. When choosing the
airline, pick the one that has frequent service to your hometown and
lets you accumulate frequent-flier miles. Southwest Vacations (% 800-
243-8372; www.swavacations.com) recently offered a Las Vegas pack-
age out of Los Angeles that included airfare, accommodations at the
Stratosphere, hotel taxes, and a discount coupon book for $375 for a 
one night stay. A package offered by Delta Vacations (% 800-654-6559;
www.deltavacations.com) out of New York City included airfare,
accommodations at the Flamingo and associated fees for $935 for a
couple to stay one night. Other airline packagers include the following:
 American Airlines Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aa
vacations.com)
 Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.cool
vacations.com)
 US Airways Vacations (% 800-422-3861; www.usairways
vacations.com)
Some of the biggest hotels also offer packages. If you have your heart 
set on staying at a particular hotel, call them and ask if they can offer
land/air packages. We include a list of the major resorts and their con-
tact information in Chapter 9.

W
orried that your kids are too young for Sin City or that you’re too
old to enjoy a Las Vegas show? Afraid that you may experience
barriers blocking your access or lifestyle? In this chapter, we dispense a
little advice for travelers with specific needs.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Once upon a time, the Vegas masterminds decided to try to go after the
family market. Family-oriented attractions, such as amusement parks,
roller coasters, and arcades, sprang up to try to get parents to bring
their kids along with them to the Las Vegas wonderland (instead of, say,
Walt Disney World). The resorts included such family perks as hotel
childcare centers. In fact, many of the hotels were initially designed with
kids in mind. MGM Grand, for example, had a mammoth Wizard of Oz
theme as soon as you entered the hotel, and the Stratosphere and
Excalibur hotels had similar kiddie themes.
Let’s just say that the plan didn’t work too well.
The kid-friendly hotels have pretty much ditched all their child-appealing
elements. Now there just isn’t a lot for the wee ones to do. And, of
course, there’s that whole “What Happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas” city
motto. The sort of things that one may prefer not discussing any further
are usually of an adult nature.
Regardless of the extravagant facades, the main lure of Vegas is, of
course, gambling. You have to be at least 21 to even enter a casino

(although most hotels allow your kids to walk through the casino en
route to somewhere else — after all, you usually can’t get anywhere in a
hotel without walking through the casino!). In other words, your little
good-luck charms can’t stand next to you at the craps table to blow on
your dice. The upshot: If you intend to spend much time gambling (or
indulging in any of the other “adult” pastimes), you have to find a safe
and fun spot to leave the kids while you hit the tables. And, quite frankly,
you probably wind up spending more money taking care of the kids than
you win gambling. What’s more, many hotels (such as the Bellagio) have
signs up forbidding anyone under 18, unless they are staying at the
hotel, from being on the property at night. Other hotels, when contacted
about kid-friendly possibilities, stated they did not want to be consid-
ered in any such discussion. This is clearly a 180-degree spin from the
“family-friendly” marketing campaign.
Don’t get us wrong; with a little bit of creativity and a few extra bucks,
you can bring your entire family, and everybody will have a good time.
But if you have the choice, it’s probably best to leave the kids at home.
The first thing to do to ensure that your family vacation doesn’t end up
like a National Lampoon nightmare is to go through this book and look
for hotels, restaurants, and attractions with the Kid Friendly icon.
If you’re considering bringing your independent-minded older kids or
teenagers with you on your trip, keep in mind that Las Vegas has a
curfew law in effect. Local ordinances forbid anyone under 18 from 
being on the Strip without a parent after 9 p.m. Elsewhere in the county,
minors can’t be out without parents after 10 p.m. on school nights and
midnight on the weekends.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
People over the age of 60 are traveling more than ever before, and
they’re coming to Vegas in droves. Unless your idea of a good time is
rubbing elbows with the “youngsters” at Studio 54 (and maybe it is!),
you will find that the tourists in Vegas come from all walks of life.
In Las Vegas, people over the age of 62 can get discount fares on the
local bus system by obtaining a Reduced Fare Identification Card from
the Downtown Transportation Center (300 N. Casino Center Blvd.; 
% 702-676-1822). You need to apply for the card in person, and you
must provide proof of age.
Some theaters, museums, and other attractions offer discounts to 
seniors — the Liberace Museum for one — so ask about discounts when
you pay your admission fee. As always, you need to show identification
with proof of age.
Another perk for having so much life experience is that most of the
major domestic airlines — including American, United, Continental,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas 
50

and US Airways — offer discount programs for senior travelers. Just be
sure to ask about them when you book a flight.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 800-454-5768; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs for those age 55 and over (and a spouse or companion of any
age) in the United States and in more than 80 countries around the
world. Most courses last five to seven days in the United States (two to
four weeks abroad), and many include airfare, accommodations in uni-
versity dormitories or modest inns, meals, and tuition. ElderTreks 
(% 800-741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers small-group tours to
off-the-beaten-path or adventure-travel locations, restricted to travelers
50 and older. 
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); 101 Tips for Mature Travelers,
available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-959-0405 or 617-350-7500;
www.gct.com); The 50+ Traveler’s Guidebook (St. Martin’s Press); and
Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You Absolutely
Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50 (McGraw-Hill), by Joann Rattner
Heilman.
Accessing Las Vegas: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Las Vegas is truly for everyone, and a disability shouldn’t stop you from
visiting and having a great time. Vegas really has gone to great lengths to
accommodate individuals with special needs. All the major hotels come
equipped with the basics, such as ramps and elevators, and most have
rooms outfitted with the latest technology designed for accessibility.
In order to get the most out of your visit, be sure to inform your reserva-
tions agent of your requirements.
Having said that, keep in mind the vastness of the massive hotel resorts.
It can be a long haul from the front entrance to your room, to the pool,
or to anywhere at all. Some casinos don’t have a lot of aisle space,
making them hard to maneuver. And you can count on encountering a
whole lot of people and a whole lot of stuff between you and your ulti-
mate destination.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 51

Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 877-451-3006 or 507-451-
5005; www.flyingwheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises
that emphasize sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-
Able Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers
extensive access information and advice for traveling around the world
with disabilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339;
www.accessiblejourneys.com) offers wheelchair travelers and their
families and friends resources for travel.
Avis Rent a Car has an “Avis Access” program that offers such services
as a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers
with special travel needs; special car features such as swivel seats, spin-
ner knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.
Organizations that offer assistance to travelers with disabilities include
MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a library of
accessible-travel resources online; SATH (Society for Accessible Travel
and Hospitality; % 212-447-7284; www.sath.org; annual membership
fees: $45 adults, $30 seniors and students), which offers a wealth of
travel resources for all types of disabilities and informed recommenda-
tions on destinations, access guides, travel agents, tour operators, vehi-
cle rentals, and companion services; and the American Foundation for
the Blind (AFB; % 800-232-5463; www.afb.org), a referral resource for
the blind or visually impaired that includes information on traveling with
Seeing Eye dogs.
For more information specifically targeted to travelers with disabilities,
check out the quarterly magazine Emerging Horizons ($16.95 per year,
$21.95 outside the U.S.; www.emerginghorizons.com); and Twin Peaks
Press (% 360-694-2462).
Traveling Tips for Gays and Lesbians
The hotels and casinos in Las Vegas want your money — regardless of
your lifestyle. Many of the mega-resorts actively advertise in gay and les-
bian papers with the hopes of luring some of those disposable-income
dollars away from you.
As of this writing there is only one exclusively gay hotel in Las Vegas, 
the Blue Moon Resort (2651 Westwood Dr.; % 866-798-9194; www.blue
moonlv.com). The plain box motel exterior and the vaguely industrial
neighborhood mask a really rather nice interior, with aesthetically pleas-
ing and comfortable rooms, a small but luxuriously landscaped pool and
grotto area, a steam room, and more.
We list a few of the best gay bars in Chapter 17. For your traveling 
pleasure, you can also check out the following list of some other great
resources:

efore you leave for your vacation, you probably feel that you need
to do a thousand things: make reservations, put the dog in the
kennel, pack your bags, and so on. Trust us: If you organize everything
ahead of time, you will save precious hours. In this chapter, we tell you
how to take care of some of the pesky details like renting a car and
buying travel insurance.
Renting a Car in Vegas
Do you need to rent a car in Las Vegas? Need? No. But we really think
you should consider it. Technically, everything on the Strip is within
walking distance — it’s roughly 3 miles from Circus Circus to Mandalay
Bay — but who wants to walk that in 100-degree heat (or, in winter, in
near gale-force winds)? Without a car, you may be less inclined to get off
the Strip and go downtown or to the Liberace Museum (and we just
can’t have that). Sure, you can hail a taxi, but you could easily spend
more on taxi fare than on car rental.
If you’re the type of person who needs hard, cold facts, consider this: If
you take a taxi from the airport to the Riviera Hotel & Casino, for exam-
ple, you wind up paying around $20, plus tip. (At least.) And then if you
want to see the pyramid-shaped Luxor hotel (a solid 3 miles away), that’s
another $20 to $25 round-trip. Suppose that, later the same evening, you
want to go see the Fremont Street Experience downtown and then finish
off the evening with a cocktail at the top of the Stratosphere Tower:
You’ve just racked up at least another $30 — more if traffic is heavy. If

you add everything up, you’ve spent $70 on taxis; for that amount, you
could be cruising the Strip in your own convertible for all to see.
And the preceding scenario doesn’t take into account the time you
waste standing in line for a taxi (up to an hour on weekend nights is not
unheard of). With car rentals often available for as low as $25 a day
(maybe a bit more for a convertible, but who’s counting?), your best bet
is obvious.
When you consider the freedom that having your own set of wheels
gives you, and the fact that every hotel in town offers free parking to
guests and nonguests, the obvious answer is, “You betcha you should
rent a car.”
And rent your car before you get into town, especially if you’re arriving
during a peak tourist period. You have more time to search for a good
rate, and you won’t have to spend precious vacation time scouring the
Strip for a rental you can afford.
If, however, you decide not to rent a car, you can hop on an airport shut-
tle service to get to your hotel. You don’t have to arrange any of this in
advance (flip to Chapter 8 for more details). After you’re settled in,
though, you’re either going to have to hail a cab or hoof it. Okay, we sup-
pose we should mention that Vegas has a regular city bus service, but it
gets mixed reviews for timeliness and convenience. We only recommend
it for brave souls. On the other hand, the Las Vegas Monorail provides a
reasonable alternative to a car. It travels along most of the Strip, stop-
ping at various intervals, with a jog over to the Hilton and the Convention
Center. Unfortunately, the Liberace Museum still won’t be on the route,
darn it. Though it’s going to cost at least twice as much as the bus, it is
much faster, to say nothing of more stylish.
Finding the best rate
Car rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can make
comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can check rates at
most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the major travel sites —
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.
com), for example — have search engines that can dig up discounted car-
rental rates. Just enter the car size you want, the pickup and return
dates, and location, and the server returns a price. You can even make
the reservation through any of these sites.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 55

Whether you reserve online, in person, or by phone, getting answers to
the following key questions may save you beaucoup bucks:
 Are weekend rates lower than weekday rates? If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask if the rate is the same for pickup Friday morning as it
is Thursday night.
 Are there drop-off charges? Some companies may assess a drop-
off charge if you don’t return the car to the same rental location;
others, notably National, don’t.
 Are rates cheaper in town? Some rental companies will give you a
lower rate if you’re willing to pick up and drop off the car at a loca-
tion in town rather than at the airport.
 Are there any age restrictions? Many car-rental companies add on
a fee for drivers under 25, and some don’t rent to them at all.
 Is that the best rate? If you see an advertised price in your local
newspaper, be sure to ask for that specific rate; otherwise you may
be charged the standard (higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention
membership in AAA, AARP, and trade unions. These memberships
usually entitle you to discounts ranging from 5 to 30 percent.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas 
56
The walking wounded
The biggest game of chance on the Strip may not be inside the casinos, but outside on
the street. Because blocks on the Strip tend to be longer than long, pedestrians often
ignore crosswalks and dash across the Strip regardless of their location. When Lady
Luck is with these jaywalkers, all they have to face are angry drivers swerving — while
swearing — to avoid them. But, like all other gambling in Vegas, the odds for this game
do not favor the player.
When traffic conditions are favorable — and sometimes even when they aren’t —
drivers in Las Vegas have no compunction about flooring it. And the Strip isn’t very
pedestrian friendly — stop signals at the crosswalks can be so short that an Olympic
sprinter would have trouble getting across the street in time. When you combine these
two factors, the end result is that traffic accidents are a fact of life on the Strip. In
order to safeguard pedestrians, the city is increasing the number of above-ground
sidewalks (notably in all four directions at the corner of Tropicana and the Strip, at the
corner of Flamingo and the Strip, and Spring Mountain and the Strip).
It may take you a little longer to get where you’re going, but our advice is to cross at
traffic lights or use the above-ground sidewalks. Otherwise, you should ask yourself,
“Are you feeling lucky today?” Those of you who have seen a Dirty Harry movie know
that you won’t like the answer.

 Do you offer any frequent-flier bonuses? Check your frequent-flier
accounts. Not only are your favorite (or at least most-used) airlines
likely to have sent you discount coupons, but most car rentals add
at least 500 miles to your account.
Adding up the cost of renting a car
On top of the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals. The Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires
you to pay for damage to the car in a collision, is charged on rentals in
most states but is covered by many credit-card companies. Check with
your credit-card company before you go so that you can avoid paying
this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day). Face it: An extra $20 in your pocket
can mean a few extra pulls on a slot machine!
Car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you harm
others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm yourself
or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your luggage is
stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home proba-
bly covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if your own
insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have auto insur-
ance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car rental
agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the Hope dia-
mond, and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk anyway, you
can probably skip the personal effects insurance, but driving around
without liability or personal accident coverage is never a good idea.
Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and liability
claims can be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, which means that you
pay for an entire tank of gas up front. The price is usually fairly competi-
tive with local gas prices, but you don’t get credit for any gas remaining
in the tank when you drop off the vehicle. If you decide not to go with
this option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return it
with a full tank or face high charges for any shortfall. If you’re worried
that a stop at a gas station on the way to the airport may cause you to
miss your plane, or, especially, if the rates at the rental car place are
lower than prices at the gas station (it does happen), by all means, take
advantage of the fuel-purchase option. 
Note: Some rental car companies are now charging a “luxury fee” for
renting a car from the airport location. Be sure you have paperwork
guaranteeing your rate.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation 
insurance, medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 57

travel insurance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your
trip, your age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect
to pay between 5 and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is our advice
on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in Oct 2001 because they were wary of flying.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies 
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
insured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance
with a credit card — by law, consumers can get their money back
on goods and services not received if they report the loss within 60
days after the charge is listed on their credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one, how-
ever: Some experts suggest you avoid buying insurance from the
tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s better to
buy from a “third-party” insurer than to put all your money in one
place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip doesn’t
make sense for most travelers. Most existing health policies cover
you if you get sick away from home — but check before you go,
particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see if
your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy, get bag-
gage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance
package, or buy Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insur-
ance at the airport — it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any
valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage,
as many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas 
58

arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.

Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so we strongly advise against it (of
course, last time we checked, the bugs weren’t listening to us any more
than they probably listen to you).
Obviously, Vegas is not the jungle, so it’s not like you are going to have to
worry about malaria. But there are a few health pitfalls awaiting any visi-
tor, and we don’t just mean hangovers. Many guests forget about how
strong that desert sun can be, even in the winter. You will know their folly
by their lobster-red skin. Be sure to wear sunscreen if you are going to be
outdoors for more than five minutes. If you are going to do much walking,
or even sitting by the pool in the heart of summer, drink plenty of fluids
(water especially, and remember that beer dehydrates, rather than the
opposite). It’s all about keeping cool, and not just at the poker table.
Anyone with breathing problems or smoke sensitivity should know that
while anti-smoking laws have cleared the air in parts of Vegas (restau-
rants and the like), it’s still legal to smoke in casinos. Consequently, you
will still have to pass through clouds of smoke in most hotels to get to
wherever you are headed. It can be a huge shock to walk into a casino if
you’ve forgotten what a smoky environment is like. If you have real prob-
lems, don’t forget to request a nonsmoking room (and rental car).
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 59
Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis, or as it’s know in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome,” is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and
stretch your legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventa-
tive measures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water,
and avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis,
heart disease, or other condition that puts you at high risk, some experts recommend
wearing compression stockings or taking anticoagulants when you fly; always ask
your physician about the best course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis
include leg pain or swelling, or even shortness of breath.

Other health tips:
 If you have health insurance, carry your identification card in your
wallet. Likewise, if you don’t think your existing policy is sufficient,
purchase medical insurance for more comprehensive coverage.
 Bring all your medications with you, as well as a prescription for
more if you think you may run out. If possible, bring a couple of
extra days’ worth, plus another day or so for the ones you drop
down the sink.
 Bring an extra pair of contact lenses or glasses in case you lose
your primary pair.
 Don’t forget to bring over-the-counter medicines for common trav-
elers’ ailments, such as diarrhea or stomach acid. Gift shops carry
these items, but you pay a premium (and you won’t find a gift shop
on the airplane!).
 If you suffer from a chronic illness, talk to your doctor before taking
your trip. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or a heart con-
dition, wear a Medic Alert identification tag to immediately alert
any doctor about your condition and give him or her access to
your medical records through Medic Alert’s 24-hour hotline.
Participation in the Medic Alert program costs $35, with a $20
renewal fee. Contact the Medic Alert Foundation (2323 Colorado
Ave., Turlock, CA 95382; % 888-633-4298; Internet: www.medic
alert.org).
If you do get sick, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend a local
doctor. This is probably a better recommendation than what you may
get from a doctor’s referral number. If you can’t get a doctor to help you
right away, try the emergency room at the local hospital. For a list of
hospitals that service the Las Vegas area, see the Quick Concierge
appendix at the back of the book.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
You shouldn’t have too much trouble staying connected in Vegas.
Cellphone reception in Vegas is better than in rural areas but it can still
be a little iffy. We personally get terrible reception on our cellphones in
most Vegas hotels, unless we’re right by a window. That may just be our
lousy service provider, though. Cellphones are allowed in casinos — but
good luck hearing whoever’s on the other end. As always, you should be
respectful of others when using cells in restaurants, and naturally turn
them off for shows and other theatrical events.
Most Vegas hotels offer Wi-Fi access, for an additional fee, and many
have pricey business centers with computers.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas 
60

Using a cellphone across the U.S.
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it works else-
where in the country (thanks to our nation’s fragmented cellphone
system). It’s a good bet that your phone will work in major cities. But
take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map on its Web site
before heading out — T-Mobile, Sprint, and Nextel are particularly weak
in rural areas. If you need to stay in touch at a destination where you
know your phone won’t work, rent a phone that does from InTouch USA
(% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or a rental car location,
but beware that you pay $1 a minute or more for airtime.
If you’re venturing deep into national parks, you may want to consider
renting a satellite phone (“satphone”), which is different from cell-
phones in that it connects to satellites rather than ground-based towers.
A satphone is more costly than a cellphone but works where there’s no
cellular signal and no towers. Unfortunately, you pay at least $2 per
minute to use the phone, and it only works where you can see the hori-
zon (that is, usually not indoors). In North America, you can rent Iridium
satellite phones from RoadPost (www.roadpost.com; % 888-290-1616
or 905-272-5665). InTouch USA offers a wider range of satphones but at
higher rates. As of this writing, satphones are very expensive to buy.
If you’re not from the U.S., you may be appalled at the poor reach of our
GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which is used by
much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work in most
major U.S. cities; it definitely won’t work in many rural areas. And you
may or may not be able to send SMS (text messaging) home. Assume
nothing — call your wireless provider and get the full scoop. In a worst-
case scenario, you can always rent a phone; InTouch USA delivers to
hotels.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their E-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA
(personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, 
you can still access your E-mail and even your office computer from
cybercafes.
Vegas does not have a lot of cybercafes readily accessible to the average
visitor, plus those independent businesses do not reliably stay in busi-
ness. See what is currently open at www.cybercaptive.com and www.
cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer you can get to the Internet on. And most public
libraries across the world offer Internet access free or for a small charge.
Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbitant
rates.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 61

Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you also see in shopping malls, hotel
lobbies, and tourist information offices around the world, give you basic
Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe
prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high prices mean they should be
avoided whenever possible.
To retrieve your E-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it
has a Web-based interface tied to your existing E-mail account. If your
ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web serv-
ice (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home E-mail. For
more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based E-mail account
with Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.)
Google’s gmail has become a very popular Web-based E-mail service.
Your home ISP may be able to forward your E-mail to the Web-based
account automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from 
anywhere — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and 
has an always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner
cable). The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried
about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer 
to access the GoToMyPC system.
If you are bringing your own computer, Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) is the
way to go. More and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as
wireless “hotspots” from where you can get high-speed connection with-
out cable wires, networking hardware, or a phone line. You can get Wi-Fi
connection one of several ways. Many laptops have built-in Wi-Fi capa-
bility (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners have their
own networking technology, Apple AirPort. For those with older comput-
ers, an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) can be plugged into your laptop.
You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone serv-
ice, through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies that
have made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and
coffee shops, primarily in the U.S. (followed by the U.K. and Japan). 
T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up wireless
connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops nationwide.
Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set
up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. IPass providers
also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby setups. Best
of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s
network; just set yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby. The compa-
nies’ pricing policies can be Byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-
connection, and per-minute plans, but in general you pay around $30 a
month for limited access — and as more and more companies jump on
the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more competitive.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Las Vegas 
62

Most Vegas hotels offer Wi-Fi, but for a daily fee that can be pretty costly.
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hotspots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems or high speed
access for a fee. You can bring your own cables, but many hotels rent
them too. Call your hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major Internet Service Providers (ISP) have local access
numbers around the world, allowing you to go online by simply placing
a local call. (Local calls in Vegas usually cost about $1 for the first 30
minutes, but then go way up for each additional minute thereafter.)
Check your ISP’s Web site or call its toll-free number and ask how you
can use your current account away from home, and how much it will
cost. If you’re traveling outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network
has dial-up numbers in most of the world’s countries. You have to sign
up with an iPass provider, who will then tell you how to set up your com-
puter for your destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.
ipass.com and click on “Individual Purchase.” One solid provider is
i2roam (www.i2roam.com; % 866-811-6209 or 920-235-0475).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
Security procedures in the U.S. post-9/11 have often caused jams in the
security check in lines. Allow yourself plenty of time to go through.
Generally, you are fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a
domestic flight and two hours before an international flight.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with 
E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-
in involves logging on to your airlines’ Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even
offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier
card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 63

the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re check-
ing bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you will be able to do so
using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the
kiosk system, but always call your airline to make sure these alternatives
are available. Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines,
although a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines can often be long. If you have trouble standing
for long periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide
a wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as
big belt buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your
doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind
that only ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks
escorting disabled passengers or children.
Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal
item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. As this was written,
there are strict guidelines about what can be carried on board, particu-
larly with regard to liquids. The Transportation Security Administration
(TSA) provides a list of what you can carry on and what you can’t. For
a current list of restricted items visit the TSA Web site at www.tsa.gov.
Meanwhile, many airlines are now charging for a second item of checked
luggage, or in some cases, even the first bag. Check your airline’s Web
site for their current policies.

L
as Vegas is truly a city that never sleeps, and it can seem
quite overwhelming at ﬁrst. Navigating your way amid
the haze of neon lights, mega-resorts, and the Strip’s ever-
present trafﬁc can seem intimidating at ﬁrst glance. Don’t
worry — it’s not as complicated as it looks. In this part, we
walk you through the city’s neighborhoods, tell you where
and how to catch local transportation, show you where to get
more information whenever you need it, and explore with you

o matter how you get here, you’ll probably be dazzled at first, par-
ticularly if you’ve never been to Las Vegas. It’s so . . . bright. Neon.
Weird. You’ll want to come back just to see if you dreamed it. Even if
you’ve been here before, you may be shocked at how little you recog-
nize. Vegas is rarely idle; constant tear-downs and build-back-ups mean
that every decade or so, the landscape looks totally new. It’s a mind-
blowing sight, so take it in and enjoy it.
If you’re driving, just remember to take your eyes off the buildings and
put them back on the road every so often. (We know — it’s very distract-
ing to drive past pyramids and lions and pirate ships!)
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
For general tips on making your way around town, you can refer to
“Getting Around Las Vegas,” later in this chapter; but here we give you
some sound advice for getting into town and to your hotel.
Arriving by plane
McCarran International Airport is located at the southern end of the
city, at 5757 Wayne Newton Blvd. (% 702-261-5211; www.mccarran.com).
You’re really not too far from the action — unlike in some big cities,
where you have to cover many miles to get to your hotel from the air-
port, you only have to go about a mile to get from McCarran to the Strip.
Of course, at rush hour, it may take hours to cover that mile!

Not only is the location super-convenient, but so is the airport itself. It’s
busy, no doubt (it’s the fifth-busiest airport in the world, with more than
40 million people passing through annually); but it’s surprisingly simple
to navigate. Big, modern, and well planned, it has three concourses and
more than 60 gates. And if you come back sometime around the year
2010, you’re likely to see 70 additional gates (yep, every aspect of Las
Vegas is growing by leaps and bounds).
Hitting the road
Assuming that you took our advice and rented a car (see Chapter 7),
head outside past the baggage claim area to the shuttle bus stops and
look for the Rental Cars buses. These will transport you to an off-site
rental car facility where you find all the usual suspects: Alamo, Avis,
Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, National, and Thrifty, among others. After
you finish all the paperwork at the counter, follow the signs to your car
in the big structures and you’re off.
When you leave the facility, take a right on Warm Springs Road and then
a quick right on Las Vegas Boulevard. That’s the Strip, and it’s just a
couple of miles to the heart of the action.
Catching a cab
Just outside the doors from the baggage claim area is the taxi stand. If a
couple of flights have arrived at roughly the same time, the line for a cab
can be daunting, with waiting times of up to 20 minutes. Basic taxi fare is
$3.30 for the first mile plus an additional $1.20 for getting picked up at
the airport, $2.20 for each additional mile, plus gas surcharge, airport
levies, and time penalties if you get stuck in traffic. The state governs
these fares, so they should be the same for every company. An adequate
tip for the cab driver is 10 to 15 percent; but if you’re sharing a fare, you
should do 10 percent per person or per small group.
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
68
Ready, set, gamble!
As soon as you get off the plane, you learn the first rule of Las Vegas: Gambling is
everywhere. Even in the airport. There are more than 1,300 slot machines and video-
poker games right here at McCarran. These banks of machines (known as carousels)
are in all the satellite terminals, the main terminal, and the baggage-claim area.
Most people advise that you avoid these machines like the plague — supposedly, they
offer lower winnings (known as paybacks) than hotel machines. Then again, we know
people who have hit it big on those very machines. So we won’t blame you if you drop
a few coins. After all, who can resist such a quintessential Las Vegas experience as
shaking hands with a one-armed bandit while waiting for your luggage?

All taxis can carry up to five passengers. While you’re stuck waiting in
line at the taxi stand, strike up a conversation with the other people
around you to see if anyone is headed in your direction and is willing to
split the fare with you. Hey, cheaper is better!
Cabs are usually lined up and waiting outside the airport and major
hotels at all times. For this reason, you really should never have to
phone for a cab. For more information on getting around Vegas by cab
and a list of the major cab companies in town, see “By taxi” under
“Getting Around Las Vegas,” later in this chapter.
Table 8-1 shows you a few examples of what you can expect to pay for a
cab from McCarran to various parts of the city. Keep in mind that these
are just estimates, so your actual fare may vary a bit depending on traf-
fic and different routes taken.

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 69
Going in style
If you want to try a fun alternative to cabbing it through town, why not avoid the taxi
lines and consider taking a limo? You can call ahead to your hotel (most of the big ones
have a limo service) and arrange to have a driver pick you up at the airport. Just give
the hotel staff your flight information, and the limo driver will even be waiting at your
gate, holding a little sign with your name on it — how ritzy!
Not only is it fun to pretend to be among the rich and famous, but you don’t have to
actually be rich to enjoy this perk: The rates can be reasonable for limos if you’re trav-
eling with a large group. As a matter of fact, it’s sometimes less expensive than taking
a cab, considering that you can fit more people into a limo. And the drivers are much
more accommodating. Sit back and enjoy the sights (or watch the on-board TV) in
style. And don’t forget to tip the kind driver for his efforts.

Jumping on a shuttle
If you want to take a shuttle, go to the same place in the airport where
you pick up a taxi or board the rental car buses. There you find shuttle
buses that run regularly to and from the Strip and downtown. These
buses are big and comfy, and can be a bargain if you’re by yourself or
with one other person. Shuttle buses charge about $5 per person for a
trip to the Strip or Paradise Road areas and $7 per person to go down-
town. And they take you right to your hotel.
If you have more than two people in your group, however, you can prob-
ably take a cab for less.
Taking a shuttle is not always a piece of cake: If the people on your bus
aren’t going to the same hotel as you (or one close by), you end up
riding and waiting through a lot of extra stops. (If you share our luck,
your hotel will be the last stop on the trip.) The shuttles have luggage
racks, though, which make these a better bet than a city bus.
Although several companies operate shuttle services, Bell Trans
(% 702-739-7990) is the biggest and most reliable. You can usually 
spot these large shuttle vans, with rates posted on the sides, cruising
the airport.
Getting on the bus
We’re going to be blunt here: For reasons we discuss later in this chapter
(see “Getting Around Las Vegas”), the bus should be your last resort.
Citizen’s Area Transit, or CAT (% 702-CAT-RIDE), runs regular service
to and from the airport. The fare is $1.25 per person and 60¢ for seniors
and children. Take CAT only if you have no other option. If you’re lugging
a heavy load, remember that even if the bus stops right in front of your
hotel (which it probably won’t), you may have a long walk from the bus
stop to the door (distances in Vegas can be deceiving).
If you decide to take the bus (despite our advice to the contrary),
remember that schedules and routes vary, so call for information. In gen-
eral, though, you can catch the no. 108 bus at the airport and take it to
the Stratosphere, where you can transfer to the no. 301, which stops
close to most Strip — and Convention Center — area hotels.
The no. 109 bus goes from the airport to the Downtown Transportation
Center at Casino Center Boulevard and Stewart Avenue.
Arriving by car
If you’re driving into town (regardless of whether you’re coming from
the airport), you’ll probably be coming in on Interstate 15, the major
north-south freeway that runs right through the city. The following rec-
ommendations help you determine which exit to take, depending on
where you’re staying:
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
70

 If you’re staying on the South Strip (for example, Mandalay Bay,
MGM Grand): Traveling north on I-15, exit at Tropicana Avenue,
and turn right at the stoplight. The Strip is less than a 1⁄2 mile to the
east — trust us, you can’t miss it. Southbound travelers should
take the same exit but follow the signs for Tropicana Avenue East.
 If you’re staying on the Center Strip (for example, Bellagio,
Harrah’s): North- or southbound drivers should take either the
Eastbound Flamingo Road or Spring Mountain Road exit. The
former puts you at the intersection populated by Caesars Palace,
Bellagio, Paris, Wynn Las Vegas, and more, while the latter drops
you off near Treasure Island, The Mirage, and The Venetian.
 If you’re staying on the North Strip (for example, the Stratosphere
or Circus Circus): Coming from the north or south, exit at Sahara
and head east. The Strip is about 3⁄4 of a mile away.
 If you’re staying in the Paradise Road area (for example, Las
Vegas Hilton, Hard Rock Hotel): Take the Flamingo Road exit and
head east. When you cross the Strip, go about another mile to
Paradise Road. At this intersection, you’ll be right around the 4000
block, with higher numbers to the south (turn right) and lower
numbers to the north (turn left).
 If you’re staying downtown (for example, The Golden Nugget,
Main Street Station): From I-15, the quickest route is to take the
freeway offshoot that runs past downtown. The interchange is a bit
tricky (locals call it the Spaghetti Bowl), with the freeway carrying
three different numbers: 515, 95, and 93. Whatever you want to call
it, take it south and exit at Casino Center Boulevard. This dumps
you right into the heart of downtown, with Fremont Street crossing
two blocks ahead and Las Vegas Boulevard (which eventually
becomes the Strip) three blocks to the left.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Even though Las Vegas is a very spread-out city, the area you’ll most
likely be staying in is very centralized and easy to navigate.
Vegas boasts three main neighborhoods. There’s the Strip, where all the
big hotels and resorts are located; downtown, where you find Glitter
Gulch and the Fremont Street Experience; and the Paradise Road area,
which is home to the Las Vegas Convention Center and some smaller,
noncasino hotels. We will explain why we are including it down below, as
we also give you the pros and cons of basing yourself in each one. We
also include a few other neighborhoods in this section that may be of
some interest to you if you’re staying for more than a few days or are
planning future trips.
The best analogy to help you envision the layout of Las Vegas is this: Las
Vegas is shaped sort of like a crooked Santa Claus cap. The Strip is one

side of the cap, Paradise Road is the other, and downtown is the fuzzy
ball on top. Chew on that one for a moment.
The Strip
The Strip (also known as Las Vegas Boulevard South) is the heart of
Vegas. It acts as the center of town, so addresses are all measured from
there (100 West is a block west of the Strip, 100 East is a block east, and
so on). The southern and center parts of the Strip are the most action-
packed. That’s where first-time visitors generally spend most of their
time, and with good reason — this 4-mile stretch or road is home to the
biggest, splashiest, and (in some cases) gaudiest hotels and casinos on
earth. All the major players you’ve heard about are here: Bellagio, the
Venetian, New York-New York, MGM Grand, Caesars Palace, Wynn Las
Vegas, and The Mirage, just to name a few.
The Strip is very spread out. If it’s a nice day and you’re feeling frisky
(and wearing sensible shoes), you can try walking from one end to the
other. Just be sure to bring cab fare with you in case your legs give out.
To make things a bit more manageable, we’ve divided the Strip into
three sections for the purposes of this book:
 The South Strip runs roughly from Harmon Avenue south and
includes the MGM Grand, New York-New York, City Center and the
Luxor.
 The North Strip is everything north of Spring Mountain/Sands up
to the Stratosphere Tower; Circus Circus, the Sahara, and the
Wynn Las Vegas, to name a few.
 The Center Strip is everything in between and includes Bellagio,
the Venetian, Palazzo, the Flamingo, Caesars Palace, The Mirage,
and Treasure Island.
If you’re a first-time visitor to Vegas and want to be close to all the glitzy
sites, the Strip is your best bet. Consider the pros and cons, however:
 Pros: All the mega-resorts are here — many within walking distance
of one another (and trust us, you want to spend time gawking at
these hotels).
The Strip offers a wide variety of choices, from super-luxurious
casino resorts to standard motels. And don’t forget: This is really
why you’re coming to Vegas!
 Cons: This is why everyone comes to Vegas, so this is where the
crowds are. Don’t overlook the fact that most places are on the
expensive side, and the few cheap hotels are cheap in every sense
of the word. Finally, with so much to do on the Strip, it’s easy to
miss out on the rest of the city.
Note also that the extreme end of the North Strip (near the Stratosphere
in particular, but even as you get closer down toward the Sahara) is not
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 73

nearly as bustling as it once was; in fact, it’s kind of desolate and creepy
in spots. The closer you get to the center, the better. The South Strip,
with the MGM Grand, Excalibur, New York-New York, and Tropicana
on four corners, is pretty happening. 
The Las Vegas Strip is one of the most popular destinations in the coun-
try, and, as such, tourist traps are everywhere. Be aware that anything
you buy on the Strip — a meal, film, a souvenir, or a can of shaving
cream — costs more than anywhere else in town. Be careful to pack
enough film and an adequate supply of all your toiletries so that you
don’t run out and get price-gouged. And, by all means, try to resist
buying souvenirs until you’re in another part of town. (For more infor-
mation on shopping in Vegas, see Chapter 13.)
Downtown
Downtown is the oldest section of the city. It’s located just southeast of
where I-15 and the 515/95/93 freeways come together. Las Vegas
Boulevard runs right into Fremont Street (now a pedestrian walkway
with no auto traffic allowed), where most of the area’s big hotels are
located.
This is where the Las Vegas phenomenon began. Hotels and casinos
sprang up here long before the Strip was anything more than a gleam in
Bugsy Siegel’s eye. The area is informally known as Glitter Gulch (nar-
rower streets make the neon seem brighter here).
The bulk of the action is concentrated on and around Fremont Street
between Main and 9th (about a five-minute drive from the north end of
the Strip), putting any number of casinos within a block or two of one
another. In the not-so-distant past, downtown had fallen victim to the
high-profile aura surrounding the Strip. Revitalized by the Fremont Street
Experience (see Chapter 12), downtown has been transformed from a
seedy, unsafe row of low-rent hotels and strip joints to a more pleasant,
friendly row of medium-rent hotels (with only the occasional strip joint).
And it’s all tied together by a pedestrian mall topped with a canopy that
features a very fancy light show set to music. In parts, it’s more like a
small town than “Vegas”; but then again, it’s more manageable. 
Bordering neighborhoods are questionable in terms of safety, so stick to
the well-traveled, brightly lit parts.
Following are the pros and cons of downtown:
 Pros: Downtown is less crowded and overwhelming than the Strip.
You often get better bargains on hotels and entertainment. And if
you don’t want to rent a car, you save on transportation, because
everything in the downtown area is within walking distance or a
short (read: cheap) cab ride away.
 Cons: You find fewer choices of hotels and places to play than 
on the Strip. Again, it’s more like a small town in some ways than
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
74

big-wow Vegas. It’s also somewhat isolated from all the really
famous, big-ticket venues in town. If you’re bringing kids, keep in
mind that downtown is still seedy in spots and doesn’t cater much
to families.
Paradise Road
This area is so named because it refers to — surprise! — Paradise Road
and the area surrounding it. The actual road is a major north-south
artery that runs from McCarran to its intersection with the Strip (which
parallels Paradise Road, for the most part, about 1⁄2 mile to the west) at
the Stratosphere Tower.
You can find a few large hotels and attractions here, but mostly it’s made
up of smaller non-casino hotels and a lot of restaurants. The Las Vegas
Convention Center is located in this area, so it’s a good area to base
yourself in if you’re attending a convention. The road runs parallel to
Las Vegas Boulevard about a mile away, and most hotels and casinos are
located between Harmon and Sahara avenues. (When you read the hotel
reviews in Chapter 9, keep in mind that a “Paradise Road” designation
does not necessarily mean that the hotel is right on Paradise Road but
rather in the vicinity.)
Hotels here are mostly of the generic chain, variety, which can take a big
chunk of fun out of your Vegas experience. Many boast that they are an
easy walk to the Strip, but that depends on your definition of “easy.”
Following are the pros and cons of Paradise Road:
 Pros: This area offers more noncasino hotels as a quiet alternative
to the busy Strip and downtown. And it’s within close proximity to
all the action without being right in the middle of it. Thanks to the
monorail, access to the Strip is easier than ever.
 Cons: Paradise Road has fewer hotel, entertainment, and recreation
choices than either the Strip or downtown. And it isn’t within true
walking distance of the fun stuff. Finally, if there’s a convention in
town, forget it!
Between the Strip and downtown
If you take Las Vegas Boulevard north, you end up downtown. Most of
the city’s wedding chapels are located between the Strip and downtown
(see Chapter 12 for more about the nuptial scene). Unless you’re actu-
ally getting married, this area is really only good for its high silliness and
kitsch factor (“Joan Collins was married here!”). Hey, it may be fun for
something a little different.
East Las Vegas
The East Las Vegas area is where locals go to gamble. It’s less crowded
and glitzy (locals don’t really need the wow factor). The odds are better,
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 75

too — you can actually find a 9/6 video poker machine (see Chapter 11
for more on this) and single-deck blackjack! The table limits tend to be
lower, everything is a little cheaper, and those hotels tend to go out of
their way to cultivate a local — and loyal — clientele.
Several big hotel/casinos are located along Boulder Highway near
Flamingo Road, including Sam’s Town Hotel and Gambling Hall (5111
Boulder Hwy.; % 800-634-6371). We don’t recommend getting a hotel in
this neighborhood, simply because most of the other places you may
want to see are too far away — it’s about 7 or 8 miles to the Strip. The
upside is that prices are often much lower than what you’d pay on the
Strip. So if you’re feeling particularly adventuresome — or tight in the
wallet — it may be worth your while to check it out. Take Flamingo
Road east from the Strip to get here.
West Las Vegas
Another predominantly suburban area is dotted with a few resorts of
note, including Red Rock Resort, the JW Marriott, and the locals’
favorite Suncoast. These hotel/casinos are even further away than the
East Las Vegas locations mentioned earlier (10 or 11 miles in usually
heavy traffic), but they can be surprisingly upscale, luxurious places
where you can often stay for less than what similar accommodations on
the Strip cost. Take Charleston Avenue west from the Strip to get to the
general vicinity.
Henderson
If you’re looking for something a bit off the beaten path, and you want to
see some fun, family-oriented attractions, check out Henderson. It’s a
small town just southeast of Las Vegas — a 20-minute car ride from the
Strip, if traffic is good. Two of our favorite hotels in Vegas are here, the
Green Valley Ranch resort, and, the farther away but oh-so-worth-it Ritz
Carlton Lake Las Vegas (both are reviewed in Chapter 9). To get to
Henderson from the Strip, take Las Vegas Boulevard south to Sunset
Road and head east. Most of what you may want to see is around the
intersection of Sunset Road and the 95 freeway.
Maryland Parkway
The Maryland Parkway is another major north-south artery about 2
miles west of the Strip and 1 mile west of Paradise Road. If you’re look-
ing for retailers or food chains, you can find just about every major (and
minor) one on this road: Sears, JCPenney, Toys “R” Us, and all the big
pharmacy/drugstores, just to mention a few.
If you need to pick up something such as shaving cream or a spiffy new
bathing suit, and you don’t feel like paying the exorbitant prices charged
in hotel stores, this area is a good bet.

Finding Information after You Arrive
No matter how well you prepare for your trip, you may still find yourself
in need of pertinent information after you arrive in Las Vegas. Check out
the following resources to get the latest news and current happenings:
 Every major hotel has tourist information at its reception, show,
sightseeing desk, or concierge desk. The friendly folks who work at
these desks can tell you about special events, concerts, or shows in
town that you may have missed during your research. Don’t be shy
about making show reservations at the big hotel’s show desks.
They can make reservations for you at any show in town — not just
the ones in that particular hotel. (The only caveat here is that the
concierge is probably prejudiced toward his personal or profes-
sional favorites, so you may not be getting an unbiased opinion.)
 Go to Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (3150 Paradise
Rd., Las Vegas, NV 89109; % 800-VISITLV or 702-892-7575;
www.visitlasvegas.com) to pick up packets of free information.
 Visit the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce (3720 Howard Hughes
Pkwy., #100, Las Vegas, NV 89109; % 702-735-1616) and ask for
their Visitor’s Guide, which contains extensive listings for accommo-
dations, attractions, excursions, children’s activities, and more.
The people who work there can also answer many of your other
questions (including those about quickie weddings and divorces).
 Check listings in the local newspapers and magazines. Las Vegas
has two major newspapers on sale in the city: the Las Vegas
Review-Journal and the Las Vegas Sun; both have regular enter-
tainment listings. You can also find free local magazine publica-
tions, such as What’s On-The Las Vegas Guide (www.whats-on.
com) and Las Vegas Magazine (www.lvshowbiz.com), in hotels
and restaurants throughout the city.
 For hip and unbiased opinions regarding local sites and attractions,
pick up the Las Vegas Weekly (www.lasvegasweekly.com), a free
alternative arts, culture, and lifestyle journal that can be found all
over town (particularly in bookstores or record shops).
Getting Around Las Vegas
For a city of its stature, Las Vegas does not have a phenomenal public
transportation network. That’s not a surprise, considering that the casi-
nos want you to stay put. There are city buses but no subways or rail
lines. You’re likely to get around in one of four ways: driving, taking a
cab, taking a bus, or hoofing it. In this section, we give you the pros and
cons of each of these alternatives, plus some tips that may save you
time and money.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 77

By car
Driving is a good option for getting around in Vegas. When you consider
practicality and convenience, nothing beats your own set of wheels.
Although you can walk to a lot of nearby attractions, you can get the
most out of the city when you’re mobile and not relying on taxis, buses,
or your feet to get somewhere. Of course, as practical as having a car is,
there are also some drawbacks to consider. Don’t worry. We give you the
lowdown on both in this section.
Considering the pros
Renting a car provides you with added mobility and freedom that you
don’t get from other means of transportation. Unless you’re a marathon
walker, the Strip is too sprawling to walk its entire length. Anywhere else
is too far away for a cheap cab ride, and bus service is ineffective at
best. Cars are cheaper than taking cabs everywhere, especially if you
want to get out and explore.
Parking is not much of a concern in Vegas, because you can find lots of
inexpensive (or free) garages throughout the city. As we mentioned ear-
lier, all the major hotels have free self-parking, and most have free valet
service — though be sure to tip the person delivering your car.
Dealing with the cons
Of course, driving yourself through this wonderland of a city does have
its drawbacks. Las Vegas traffic is notoriously congested, and it’s espe-
cially so on and around the Strip. The stoplights alone can take forever
to maneuver. We once took a drive from the one of the southernmost
Strip hotels, the Luxor, to the northernmost, the Stratosphere. It took
almost 30 minutes to cover the 4-mile drive. That’s an average of about 8
miles an hour.
Vegas is not immune to the construction problems that you find in most
major cities. In fact, you may find that Vegas is even more prone to these
“improvements” because of its continual state of transition. Just be
aware that the roads here are always ripped up for some project or
another, and this only adds to traffic problems.
You can find lots of gas stations at the Tropicana Avenue exit just west of
the freeway, but you should probably steer clear of them: Their prices
are way higher than those at other places in town.
Although it may sound like fun to cruise around Las Vegas in a cool
Porsche or convertible, you’re better off sticking to something small and
cheap. After all, it’s just going to be sitting in a parking garage most of
the time, and the parking attendants don’t really care what you drive.
Steering clear of traffic jams
As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, driving in Las Vegas can be a
nightmare when it comes to traffic. Because the Strip is nightmarishly
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
78

crowded at all times, day or night, avoid it at all costs. Over the course
of our oh-so-frequent visits (we like to call it research!), however, we
have found a few alternative routes that are easier on your schedule and
your blood pressure.
If you don’t want to get stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Strip,
here are some alternate routes for traveling north-south:
 I-15: This major interstate runs parallel to the Strip and is easily
accessible from Tropicana, Flamingo, Spring Mountain, and
Sahara avenues. If you need to get from one end of the Strip to the
other, or especially if you are going downtown, this route is your
best bet. The only exception is during morning and evening rush
hours, when you can finish reading War and Peace in the time it
takes to get from one place to another.
 Dean Martin Drive/Industrial Road: This quick-and-dirty route for
getting from one Strip location to another is also a good alternative.
It’s located just west of the Strip, and it runs the entire length of it
and beyond, with access from the northbound lanes of Interstate
15. The smooth, four-lane mini-highway has a lot less traffic and
fewer stoplights and even though it has two names (Dean Martin
south of Twain Avenue, Industrial from that spot north), it’s just
one road that can save you some time.
 Koval Lane: Koval runs parallel to the Strip on the east side
between Las Vegas Boulevard and Paradise Road. It only runs
from Tropicana to Sands, so it isn’t good for end-to-end Strip runs;
but short trips are a lot faster. Just be sure to avoid this on Friday
and Saturday nights; gridlocked traffic on the Strip often spills over
here.
 Frank Sinatra Drive: More or less constructed as a way for hotel
employees to get to and from home and work, Frank Sinatra Drive
is a relatively unexplored option. It runs behind Mandalay Bay,
Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, and Bellagio,
with back entrances to each, and eventually connects to Industrial.
It can get a little confusing back there. Still, if you do it right, you
can get from Monte Carlo to Mandalay Bay in under five minutes.
The major east-west arteries, such as Flamingo and Tropicana, can get
congested, too, so here are some alternatives that generally move faster:
 Spring Mountain/Sands/Twain: It’s one street with three different
names, depending on where you are. It crosses the Strip next to
Treasure Island and Paradise Road near the Fairfield Inn. There
are fewer stoplights and less traffic here than you find on such
other major east-west routes as Flamingo Road or Tropicana
Avenue.
 Desert Inn Road: This is another terrific project engineered by the
city. This street has been changed into a six-lane divided freeway
(with no traffic lights) that begins at Paradise Road on the east and

ends at Valley View just west of I-15. It provides limited access to
and from the Strip, so it’s best used for getting from one side to the
other without the hassle of Las Vegas Boulevard, I-15, or cross-
walks filled with tourists.
Following the rules of the road
If you’re counting on Vegas having loose speed limits and traffic laws,
don’t. Despite rumors about western states being lax, Las Vegas police
and the Nevada Highway Patrol go strictly by the book. Here are a few
general rules:
 You find that the speed limits in Vegas are comparable to those in
the rest of the United States, with 35 to 45 mph common on many
major streets, 25 to 35 mph on side streets, and 55 to 70 mph on
the freeways. Be sure to scope out the specific speed limits on the
road you’re traveling.
 Turning right on red lights is permitted in Las Vegas. If you don’t
follow this convention, you’re likely to hear about it from the guy
behind you in the Caddy with the steer-horn hood ornament.
 Most of the time, you need to wait for the green arrow if you want
to make a left turn at a major intersection. Up to three lanes of traf-
fic can turn at the same time.
 U-turns are allowed at intersections where there is no sign strictly
forbidding them.
By taxi
If you plan on spending all or most of your time in one general area,
using the city’s taxi service is a viable option. If you plan to go very far,
however, be prepared to open your wallet — wide.
You can see taxis everywhere in Vegas, so finding one is usually not a
problem. You find a line of them outside most major hotels and the air-
port, even at 4 a.m. Although we can’t vouch for every driver, car, and
company, the taxis we’ve taken have all been clean and the drivers pro-
fessional and courteous. In case you happen to wander into less-traveled
territory and need to call a taxi, here’s a list of some of the major cab
companies in town:
 ABC % 702-736-8444
 Checker % 702-873-2000
 Desert % 702-386-9102
 Henderson % 702-384-2322
 Yellow % 702-873-2000
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

Our main issue with using taxis is that they’re so darned expensive.
Once, we were too tired to walk back from the southern end of the Strip
to our hotel in the center section, so we hailed a cab. You guessed it: We
immediately got stuck in nighttime traffic — and that meter kept on tick-
ing even though we weren’t moving. To go about 2 miles cost almost $15
with tip. Now, a good cabbie does his best to avoid such nonsense (even
if it means making less money); but if you do take a cab, be prepared to
boss them into the swiftest route.
Taxi fares are regulated by the state of Nevada and should be the same
for all companies: $3.30 for the first mile and $2.20 for each additional
mile, plus time penalties (for those times when you’re stuck in traffic).
Be sure that the rates are prominently displayed in the cab before letting
the driver start the meter.
On foot
After you get into a centralized neighborhood (Center Strip, downtown,
and so on), you won’t have a problem walking from one hotel to the
next. It’s certainly easier than retrieving a car every time. If, however,
you want to get out of one area and into another neighborhood, walking
becomes a bigger deal.
Obviously, the biggest plus to walking is that it’s free and it’s a good way
to walk off your steak and shrimp dinner. All it’s going to cost you is the
price of a pair of comfortable shoes. If you’re okay with staying in one
basic area, why not make the hike?
A major negative is the weather, which can be brutally hot during the
day and exceptionally chilly at night. This is something to consider
when you’re looking down the street and saying, “Oh, it’s not that far!”
(Remember that distances are deceiving in Las Vegas, where everything
is larger than life and therefore seems closer than it is.) Another thing to
keep in mind is that the pedestrian traffic is often as congested and frus-
trating as the street traffic. This is especially true during peak holidays
or convention times.

Getting your bearings
The Stratosphere hotel has revolutionized driving for tourists in Las Vegas. At 110 sto-
ries, this larger-than-large structure is the tallest building west of the Mississippi River.
It can be seen from just about every place in town (and from many places outside of
town!). It’s more than twice as tall as any other building in Las Vegas. If you get lost
while driving, take a minute to scan the horizon and find the Stratosphere Tower. Head
toward it, and you eventually arrive at the northern end of the Strip and Paradise Road,
only 5 minutes from downtown.

If you have the kids with you, keep this in mind: Sex is a big industry in
Las Vegas. To promote their enterprises, many strip clubs and escort serv-
ices place people on the sidewalks to hand out flyers and magazines that
you may not want your children to see (they’re pretty graphic). (That’s to
say nothing of those multi-story high, nearly-bare bottoms adorning vari-
ous casino-hotels in the name of promoting some in-house show or other.)
Of course, you can just say “no,” but remember that many people take the
brochures and then discard them on the ground where anyone, including
your little angel, can get an eye-popping peek at them.
If you do decide on hoofin’ it, remember the following:
 For comfort’s sake, be sure to bring some good walking shoes to
Las Vegas — even if you have a rental car, you’ll be doing a lot of
walking. If you opt for sandals, don’t forget to put sunscreen on
your feet, and watch out for sidewalks cluttered with trash, broken
glass, or the equivalent.
 When walking long distances in Vegas, carry plenty of water (the
casinos allow you to bring it in). Buy yours at a convenience store;
it’s cheaper than the bottles sold in casinos.
 If you get a bit tired, several of the casino hotels have free monorail
systems or moving sidewalks to help you rest your sore feet (and
to guide you, lemming-like, to their casinos). See the following sec-
tion for details on these transportation options.
By monorail, trams, and moving sidewalks
When you’re dead tired, and you don’t feel like you can move another
inch, take heart. Vegas is full of monorails, trams, and moving sidewalks
to help you get from one spot to another without moving a muscle.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83
Is that The Mirage or just a mirage?
Maybe it’s the desert that makes distances here so deceiving, or the fact that the build-
ings are so darned big that it makes them seem closer than they really are. Either way,
getting from point A to point B always seems to take much longer in Las Vegas than
you think it will. We can’t count the number of times we’ve said, “Here we are at The
Mirage/Treasure Island/Bellagio and we have dinner/business/show tickets for next
door at Caesars/The Mirage/the Monte Carlo. We can leave about 15 minutes before
we need to be there.” Thirty-five minutes later, after negotiating the casino crowds at
our hotel, trekking through to the exit, using the moving sidewalk or tram or our feet
to get to the entrance next door, finding the entrance, negotiating the crowds there
and getting lost . . . we finally arrive. Barely. The moral of the story is to always give
yourself extra time, even if you’re just going next door.

Naturally, these conveniences are there to lure you into the hotels that
operate them, but one tends to overlook that sort of thing when the
alternative means adding a few blisters to already sore feet.
 The Las Vegas Monorail: This monorail (% 702-699-8200; www.
lvmonorail.com) is the biggest, grandest people-mover in Vegas
yet, despite several delays in the opening (and post-opening) of the
system that made us want to compare it to a certain Simpsons
episode. The $650-million system whisks you from the MGM Grand
at the south end of the Strip to the Sahara at the north end in about
15 minutes, with stops at Bally’s and Paris, The Flamingo and
Caesar’s Palace, Harrah’s, the Convention Center, and the Las Vegas
Hilton along the way. The cost is $5 per person per one-way trip, or
you can get multi-ride or multiday passes if you plan on using it a
lot. Be advised that sometimes the stops themselves aren’t right at
the hotel in question, and there may be an additional block or two
of walking before you truly arrive. There is still talk of extending
the line to Downtown or the airport, but so far that’s all it is: talk.
 Treasure Island to The Mirage tram: Even though these two hotels
are right next to each other, you won’t find a quicker way to get
from one to the other. Pick up the tram at the back of Treasure
Island between the hotel and its parking deck, and it will deliver
you practically to the front door of The Mirage — or vice versa.
Convenient, huh?
 Mandalay Bay/Luxor/Excalibur monorail/people-movers: A high-
capacity monorail takes you from the corner of Tropicana and the
Strip south to Mandalay Bay. The northbound trip features stops at
Luxor and Excalibur. An air-conditioned moving sidewalk covers
the same journey between Luxor and Excalibur, and a new indoor
mall bridges the gap between Luxor and Mandalay Bay.
Even more of these people-movers are in the works, with proposed
monorails for the new Project CityCenter development; a line for the
west side of the Strip including Caesars Palace, The Mirage, and Circus
Circus; and a spur that will link the airport to the Strip.
By bus
Citizen’s Area Transit, or CAT (% 702-CAT-RIDE) is the city bus serv-
ice, and it gets really mixed reviews. You shouldn’t rely on it as your
major source of transportation, because the service is unreliable — like
most bus services, schedules are an abstract concept — and the routes
don’t always make sense. Suppose that you want to get from the airport
to the MGM Grand, which is less than 2 miles away. You have to take the
no. 108 bus all the way up Paradise Road to the Stratosphere Tower,
transfer to the no. 301, and ride that all the way back down the Strip.
The bus makes you travel more than 8 miles; if you get there in less than
two hours, consider it a miracle. Of course, many people rely on the bus
services, and the bus can be so jam-packed that you have to stand
through much of your endless journey.
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
84

Nevertheless, the city bus service is cheap. At $1.25 for adults and 60¢
for kids and seniors, it is a pretty good bargain. The no. 301 runs right
down the Strip, so if it’s not a busy time of day — remember, buses get
stuck in traffic just like cars and taxis — it’s an economical and simple
way of scooting down the Strip.
The reviews have been a bit better for the service run by CAT called The
Deuce. These double-decker buses troll the Strip and Downtown for the
remarkable fee of only $5 for the entire day (get on and off as much as
you like). They suffer from the same kind of overcrowding as the regular
buses and they get stuck in the same traffic, but at least the views are a
little better while you’re sitting in gridlock.

H
ave you ever dreamed of seeing the pyramids of Egypt? Wanted to
swan about the banks of the canals of Venice? Is hanging out in
Times Square your kind of fun? What about going to a circus, complete
with acrobats and trapeze artists? You can do all this and more in Las
Vegas. 
It’s natural to think of a hotel stay in terms of amenities and ambience.
But you need to readjust your thinking before you arrive in Vegas. In
most other cities, hotels are built near the attractions. In Vegas, the
hotels are the attractions, going way beyond mere room service and a
swimming pool. We’re talking roller coasters, wildlife, castles, clowns,
and slot machines out the wazoo. It’s not exactly your everyday choice
between a Marriott and a Motel 6, although there are some of those, too.
You don’t need to feel overwhelmed by the Vegas scene, because in this
chapter we tell you what you need to know to make the choices that are
right for you. Trust us; you’ll walk into this glittering city with a firm
grasp on where you want to go.
Getting to Know Your Options
Once you know what kind of price range you can afford (see Chapter 4)
and what neighborhood you’d like to stay in (see “Figuring Out the
Neighborhoods,” in Chapter 8), you still need to consider a few things.

Stay where you play — or not
This is a big decision. Don’t kid yourself: Gambling is a major Vegas
activity, so you won’t lack for casino action. If you’re itching to spin the
roulette wheel, it may be nice to have immediate access to one 24 hours
a day. If you don’t consider it a high priority, you may feel differently.
Regardless of your preference, here’s what you need to know:
 Casino hotels: If you opt for a casino hotel, you’re in for ’round-the-
clock entertainment, dining, and action. Casino hotels are often
loud, crowded, enormous places that actively discourage relaxing
(it hinders your gambling, don’t you know). They can be confusing
and difficult to navigate. On the other hand, you can gamble or
have a steak dinner at 3:30 a.m.
 Noncasino hotels: Most noncasino hotels provide you with a room,
a pool (maybe), a parking space, and not a lot more. But they can
also offer a quiet getaway from the hustle and bustle of this hap-
pening town. On the other hand, if they have extras (like a workout
room), unlike the casino hotels, you probably won’t have to pay 
for them.
In the end, only you can decide whether you’d rather stay in the middle
of the fray or slip away for a little peace and quiet at the end of the day.
One popular misconception is that noncasino hotels offer cheaper
rooms. That’s not necessarily true. You may find a good deal occasion-
ally, but most noncasino hotels have to make up for a lack of gaming rev-
enue by charging higher room rates.
The big and the small of it
There really is no such thing as a small hotel in Las Vegas. So your
options are not really big versus small — they’re gargantuan versus big.
(For the sake of this argument, however, we call it big versus small.)
 Small fries: On one hand, you have the small hotels, which often
give more personalized service. These are the places where you
don’t need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your room, 
and you don’t get stuck for an eternity in a line at the front desk.
However, the smaller hotels usually offer less in the way of ameni-
ties such as pools, health clubs, and restaurants.
 Big cheeses: These cities unto themselves have spared no expense
in keeping you entertained and pampered (and they’re full of gam-
bling action and boutiques). In the biggest hotels, you are given a
map when you check in (no kidding). Consider a 15-minute walk
from your room to the spa or pool — in your workout clothes or
bathing suit — right through the middle of a crowded casino. Scary
thought.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Las Vegas’s Best Hotels 87

We give you the rundown on the relative size of each hotel. This size
comparison has to do with more than just the number of rooms and how
many people can fit into the main dining room; it’s about the sprawl, or
how far you have to walk from the elevator to the front door, and how
easily you can negotiate the place. When you make your final decision,
you should weigh the tradeoff between convenience and personal serv-
ice versus having every conceivable amenity and amusement available
without ever having to smell the desert air.
To theme or not to theme
What’s the deal? Everyone knows Vegas is all about the wacky theme —
look at that castle! Or at that pyramid! And yet the powers that be have
decided that you, their desired guest, are no longer lured by pharaoh
heads on your bedspread or other kitschy details. To this end, hotels
have been systematically removing much of the silliness in favor of a
more generic “luxury resort” look. But they can’t change the outsides —
well, they can, but most don’t go that radical route — and so you still
have the option of staying in a place that smacks of Venice or Paris, in a
big giant castle, or a cartoon version of the New York skyline. Just know
that many of the theme hotels fall into the “gargantuan” category. 
Into everybody’s life a little chain must fall
Every high profile chain has a spot in Vegas: Marriott, Holiday Inn,
Westin, and so on. Now, normally we like to tout Mom and Pop over Big
Business, but Vegas has few of the former, hotel-wise. Sure, hard-core
travelers may snort at your lack of adventure, but there’s nothing wrong
with choosing the reliability and the certain quality assurance of a chain.
Truth be told, rooms in the major Strip places often aren’t much differ-
ent from the dull standard hotel comforts found in a generic chain,
though the accommodations are often larger. So don’t fret if the Strip
hotels are booked.
After all, these days even the big hotels have more than a whiff of chain
about them. Harrah’s is a famous casino-hotel line all by itself, and
that’s before you add Las Vegas stalwarts like Bally’s, Caesars Palace,
The Flamingo, and Paris to their portfolio. Bellagio, The Mirage,
Treasure Island, MGM Grand, New York-New York, Monte Carlo,
Circus Circus, Luxor, Excalibur, CityCenter, and Mandalay Bay are all
owned by one giant corporation that controls roughly 75 percent of the
rooms on the Strip.
Family fun or adult action
When we say “adult hotels,” we don’t mean sleazy décor and mirrors
everywhere. We simply mean that some places aim for the grown-up
market by deliberately leaving out the things that appeal to children,
such as video arcades and water rides. Others simply have a more adult,
sophisticated ambience, which may even include such grown ups only
touches as “European-style” pools (topless). In some cases, they even
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
88

actively discourage guests from bringing children. Bellagio actually bars
kids who aren’t staying at the hotel from entering after 6 p.m. — and yes,
the staff does check room keys. Some hotels even actively ask publica-
tions that write about Vegas for families not to include them in any rele-
vant articles or books. That says a lot. 
If you have kids who will be joining you on your vacation, look for the
Kid Friendly icon when you read the hotel reviews. These icons highlight
the (increasingly few) places that cater to families.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
Pricing a hotel is a tricky thing in Vegas; the same room that you can
have for $49 on one night can be as much as $350 the following night.
Maybe that’s an exaggeration, but not by much. (We just checked a big-
name hotel: $309 one night, $159 two nights later.) In theory, the more
you pay, the plusher the furnishings and the linens, the faster the serv-
ice, and the posher the place. But again, come to Vegas on a busy week-
end, and you probably will pay $200 or more for a very basic hotel room.
Unfortunately, the days of the super-cheap room at a famous, big-name
hotel are over. At the risk of giving away our, um, years of experience, we
remember staying at the Dunes Hotel (before it was blown up in 1993, of
course) for $19 — and that was a deluxe tower room facing the Strip!
Now you just can’t find a clean, safe room on the Strip for less than $50.
And even that is a rarity.
The other problem is that Vegas has remade itself as a “luxury resort”
adult vacation destination, one not conducive to budget travel. Most of
the higher-profile hotels — Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, the Venetian, Four
Seasons — and the deliberately styled “luxury resort” hotels — THEhotel
at Mandalay Bay, the Venezia, Wynn Las Vegas, Palazzo — have prices
that generally start high and go higher. The high demand ensures they
don’t have to reverse this policy.
Finding the best room and getting the best rate seems like a tall order —
unless you are armed with some great tips and general guidelines. Allow
us to make the task a little less stressful for you.
Uncovering the truth about rack rates
The rack rate is the maximum rate that a hotel charges for a room. It’s
the rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the
night. You sometimes see the rate printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your hotel-room door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you don’t have to pay
it. Hardly anybody does. The best way to avoid paying the rack rate is
surprisingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may
be pleasantly surprised.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Las Vegas’s Best Hotels 89

A rack rate is kind of like a full-fare ticket on an airplane. The only people
who end up paying full price are the ones who didn’t plan in advance,
don’t care what they’re paying, or have inflexible travel dates.
Although Las Vegas hotels average an annual occupancy rate of over 90
percent, that still leaves a lot of rooms to fill. Hotels make no money on
empty rooms, so they compete with each other to fill up vacancies.
When occupancy rates drop even more during off-season lulls, the big
resorts aggressively court travelers with discounted room rates.
Vegas room rates weirdness 
While we have done our best to give you the most accurate hotel rates,
the fact is that most Vegas hotels are just making them up. Neither a low
end of $69 nor $450 may accurately reflect the price that you may be
offered when you try to book. Some of the cheap prices below could well
be available only midweek during a blue moon in Leap Year, while the
ones with outrageously high prices routinely offer room specials for half
that. Not surprisingly for Vegas, it’s a crapshoot. The following tips
should help you make, if not some sense of the whole mess, then at least
the best deal you can at any given time. 
Snagging a great room rate
For those who don’t have an unlimited vacation budget (face it: very few
of us do) here are some hints for navigating the labyrinth of Vegas hotel
rates. All are invaluable ways to cut room costs, but your best bet may
be to book directly on the Internet; see “Surfing the Web for hotel deals,”
later in this chapter. If you decide to book directly with the hotel, try
these tips:
 Travel with a group. If you’re traveling with your family or a group
of friends who are willing to share a room, you can save big bucks.
Be sure to ask the reservations agent at each hotel about the policy
on occupancy. Most room rates are based on double occupancy
(two people), and charges for extra guests vary wildly. Some hotels
let small children stay for free in their parent’s room but charge
anybody else up to $35 a night extra; other hotels allow up to four
people to a room at no extra charge.
 Use both the local and toll-free numbers. Reserving a room
through the hotel’s toll-free number may result in a lower rate than
if you call the hotel directly. On the other hand, the central reserva-
tions number may not know about discount rates at specific loca-
tions. (Local franchises may offer a special group rate for a
wedding or a family reunion, for example, but may neglect to tell
the central booking line.) So your best bet is to call both the local
number and the toll-free number to see which one gives you a
better deal.
 Call around — twice. Every hotel listed in this book has a toll-free
phone number. Call around and see who is offering the best prices.
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
90

When you’re finished, wait a day and call again. You often get differ-
ent prices; they may be higher, but you may find an even better
deal.
 Time your reservation and be flexible with your dates. Unless
your boss is dictating your vacation schedule, try to think in year-
round terms. Room rates change with the season and as occupancy
rates rise and fall. As you would probably expect, you can get the
best bargains during off-peak times (Sun–Thurs, the slower summer
months, and the weeks in Dec leading up to Christmas are good
times). If a hotel is close to full, it will be less likely to extend dis-
count rates; if it’s close to empty, it may be willing to negotiate.
Resorts are most crowded on weekends, so they usually offer dis-
counted rates for midweek stays.
 The reverse is true for business and convention hotels, most of
which are crowded during the week. See Chapter 3 for a list of
dates for the biggest Vegas conventions and special events; try to
avoid these expensive dates if you can.
 Check the Internet. Many hotels offer Internet-only specials. You
may have to book on-line through their Web site or mention it when
you call their reservation line. Either way, get thee to a computer! 
 Put your membership to use. Be sure to mention your membership
in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, and any other corporate
rewards program when you make your reservation. You never know
when it may be worth a few dollars (sometimes more) off your
room rate.
 Go low-key. The boom in “luxury resort hotels” has meant a corre-
sponding boom in hotel prices. But here’s a promising side effect:
The older hotels, finding it hard to compete with their newer,
flashier brethren on the “gee whiz” level, are making up for it by low-
ering their prices. They do this in an attempt to lure the savvy —
that’s you, of course! — over to their side. Sure, you may have to
give up a spiffier room and service; but if you save as much as $100
a night, it’s worth it!
 The hotels in Las Vegas are the tourist attractions, so you don’t
have to actually stay in the biggest and brightest to experience
most of what it has to offer. Unless you’ve got your heart set on a
spa or you plan to do a lot of relaxing at a fabulous pool at your
own hotel, it doesn’t matter where you sleep, right? Consider
checking in to a cheaper, more out-of-the-way hotel. You can drop
your luggage off and then explore.
 Try a package tour. Package tours combine airfare and accommo-
dations in one purchase. Because package tour companies buy in
bulk, they can pass major savings along to you. Just be sure that
you understand their restrictions and can live with the terms. For
more information on package tours to Las Vegas, see Chapter 5.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Las Vegas’s Best Hotels 91

We talk a lot in this chapter about landing great deals, but be careful
when shopping for a bargain; make sure that you aren’t getting stuck in
an older section of the hotel that isn’t as nice as the rest. Ask hotel
reservation agents for details on amenities and conditions (is this a
recently renovated/redecorated room, for example) and tell them that
you are writing it down. If your room doesn’t match the description
when you get there, don’t be afraid to speak up.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Although the major travel booking sites (Travelocity, Expedia, Yahoo!
Travel, and Cheap Tickets; see Chapter 5 for details) offer hotel booking
if you use a site devoted primarily to lodging, you may find properties
that aren’t listed on the more general online travel agencies. Some lodg-
ing sites specialize in particular types of accommodations, such as bed
and breakfasts, which you won’t find on the more mainstream booking
services. Others, such as TravelWeb (see the following list), offer week-
end deals on major chain properties that cater to business travelers and
have more empty rooms on weekends. Check out the following
resources when trying to book online:
 All Hotels on the Web (www.all-hotels.com): Although the name
is something of a misnomer, the site does have tens of thousands of
listings from throughout the world. Bear in mind, however, that
each hotel has paid a small fee to be listed, so it’s less an objective
list and more a book of online brochures.
 Places to Stay (www.placestostay.com): This site lists one-of-a-
kind places in the United States that you may not find in other
directories, with a focus on resort accommodations. Again, the list-
ing is selective — this isn’t a comprehensive directory, but it can
give you a sense of what’s available at different destinations.
 TravelWeb (www.travelweb.com): This site lists more than 26,000
hotels in 170 countries, focusing on chains such as Hyatt and Hilton.
You can book almost 90 percent of them online. TravelWeb’s Click-It
Weekends, updated each Monday, offers weekend deals at many
leading hotel chains.
 Other sites: A number of other good Vegas-specific reservations
sites reside on the Web. These include the following: www.las
vegashotel.com; www.lasvegasreservations.com; and www.las
vegasrooms.com. All these sites offer discounted rooms at the
major hotels and at some cheaper properties.
Reserving the best room
Here are some of our strategies for getting a great room:
 Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
closer to the elevator. They often have more windows and light
than standard rooms, and they don’t always cost more.
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
92

 Steer clear of construction zones. Be sure to ask if the hotel is ren-
ovating; if it is, request a room away from the renovation work. The
noise and activity may be a bit more than you want to deal with on
your vacation.
 Request your smoking preference. Be sure to ask for either a
smoking or nonsmoking room if you have a preference. Otherwise,
you’re likely to get stuck with a room that doesn’t meet your needs.
 If you are booking your room through a travel agent, ask the agent
to note your room preferences on your reservation. When you
check in at your hotel, your preferences pop up when the reception
desk pulls your reservation. Special requests can’t be guaranteed,
but making them in advance can’t hurt.
 Inquire about the location of the restaurants, bars, and discos. If
you have a disability that prevents you from venturing too far, you
might have a problem in Vegas, where the rooms can be the equiva-
lent of a city block away from the hotel’s entertainment and dining
options. Ask about handicap facilities and hotel layout. You may
have to seriously consider which hotel you stay at. (See Chapter 6
for more information about getting around town if you have a 
disability.) 
 Ask for a room with a view. Ask for a room that overlooks the
Strip if you’re staying in a hotel situated in that part of town; other-
wise, the only view you may get is of the parking garage. Rooms
with Strip views usually don’t cost more, although some hotels do
charge for the privilege of soaking in the Las Vegas skyline from the
privacy of your room. For example, the Paris resort charges more
for a room with a view of the Bellagio’s fountain show across the
street.
Remember, if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to
the front desk. If they have another room, they should be happy to
accommodate you, within reason.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Las Vegas’s Best Hotels 93
A word about smoking
All Las Vegas hotels have at least some nonsmoking rooms; most have entire floors set
aside for those who eschew the habit. As far as the rest of the hotel is concerned, it
depends. Smoking is not allowed in restaurants and certain bars, but it is allowed on
casino floors. Since the casino floor dominates pretty much every part of a casino
hotel, you may have a problem if you are sensitive to smoke. If you’re a nonsmoker,
it’s important to request a smoke-free room when you make your reservations. Keep
in mind that at most hotels, special requests can’t be absolutely guaranteed, espe-
cially during ultra-busy times. (If you’re allergic to smoke, definitely let the reserva-
tions agent know; you may have more luck getting them to guarantee a nonsmoking
room for you.)

Arriving Without a Reservation
Okay, so you’re standing in the bookstore in the Las Vegas airport,
having just arrived in town on a last-minute whim. Now you realize that
you don’t have hotel reservations, and the prospect of sleeping at the
bus station looms large. What do you do? Well, whip out your cellphone
(or find a payphone if you don’t have one).
Most of the hotels in this book have local numbers listed in addition to
their toll-free numbers (which usually don’t work in Las Vegas). This
may sound obvious at first, but stick with us: Start by calling a few and
seeing if they have any vacancies. If they do, you can relax and take your
time in selecting a hotel that fits your needs and budget. If you get noth-
ing but “Sorry, sold out,” read on.
You can go through the phone book and call numbers at random, but
you risk getting stuck in a bad neighborhood or overpriced dump.
Instead, try a hotel reservations service that can find and book a room
for you — without charging a service fee — like the one offered by The
Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (% 877-VISITLV or
702-892-7575) is open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. But keep in mind that
these services are usually tied to specific businesses, so they try to
steer you toward a place where they collect a commission instead of
help you find another option that may suit you better. We’d recommend
using reservations services only if you are having no luck finding a
vacancy.
If you still have no luck finding a room, you’re going to have to do some
real work: Go get a rental car (you can’t do what we have in mind on foot
or by taxi) and start driving. (For information on renting a car, see
Chapter 8.) Begin with the many little hotels near the airport. If you
strike out there, head to the Strip — that’s where most of the rooms in
Las Vegas are located. Even if you got a “sold out” on the phone, try the
front desk anyway, in case there has been a last-minute cancellation.
Your next hunting ground should be Paradise Road and the streets
crossing it, such as Flamingo, Convention Center, and Harmon. This
area has a lot of nice but generic chain hotels. These hotels may not be a
top pick in this book or be included in the reservations systems, but
they are fine in a pinch.
Also, don’t forget that many of the hotels are owned by the same compa-
nies (such as Luxor, Excalibur, and Circus Circus). Throw yourself on
the mercy of the front-desk clerk and ask if any “sister” hotels have
vacancies.
Finally, go downtown, but be careful — some areas are not very safe.

Avoiding hidden costs
Vegas hotels are full of unexpected little budget-busters. The most obvious are
gym/spa fees. Most of the major hotels have a health club with machines, a steam
room, and the like. While you may expect to pay extra for a massage and other spa
services, you may not expect to pay to use the treadmill. But just about all Strip hotels
charge anywhere from $15 to $30 a day for you to do so. The Four Seasons is a lone
exception on the Strip. Most of the chains don’t charge spa fees, though their work-
out rooms are, by and large, inferior to the ones at the costly Strip lodgings. (The
Henderson-based Ritz-Carlton Lake Las Vegas and Green Valley Ranch resort also do
not charge.)
Savvy travelers generally know not to use the phone in the room, where local calls
cost anywhere from $1 to $1.50 each. Long distance is even worse; nearly all the hotels
use some outrageous long distance carrier, and the results can be $30 for a 15-minute
call. Another telephonic pitfall is dial-up Internet access; many hotels begin to charge
even local calls after 30 minutes. At as much as 30¢ a minute, it adds up fast. Even
high-speed Internet access can come with a hefty fee.
Lately some enterprising hotels have started charging what they call a “resort” or
“facilities” fee that will tack anywhere from $5 to $20 a day on top of your bill. What
this covers depends on where you stay, but it may include items like gym and spa
usage, parking, shuttles, telephones, and assorted miscellanea (daily shoe shine?).
Be sure to ask when making your reservations if the hotel you’re investigating has
such a fee.
The moral of this story? If money is a concern, unless you know for sure that something
is free, ask.

We base the ratings on what you can expect to pay, on average, for a
standard room with single or double occupancy. The ratings don’t nec-
essarily correspond with the rack rates that are printed with the listing,
simply because you can normally get a much better deal. Trust us on
this one.
To give you a slightly better idea of what you get for your money in Vegas,
here’s a more detailed description of our price categories. Don’t forget,
though, that thanks to ricocheting prices, there can be a lot of overlap
between categories. Check normally higher priced hotels just in case they
have a special going on, and don’t be too disappointed if even a normally
lower priced hotel ends up going for much more than predicted. 
 $ ($75 and under): Don’t expect to readily find a good room in this
category unless you stay at a so-called “locals” hotel, which can be
as much as 20 minutes off the Strip, or in an older, no-frills down-
town location. Even then your stay pretty much has to be mid-week
or otherwise off peak. (Having said that, some higher profile Strip
and downtown hotels can offer special deals that drop their rooms
into this category, so it’s worth checking just in case.) The good
news is that even at the low end, those “locals” hotels can offer not
just very basic, motel-like rooms, but also all kinds of entertain-
ment options such as movie theaters and bowling alleys.
 $$ ($75–$100): The rooms in this category are split; some can be
pretty plain; but others, especially in the higher end “locals” hotels,
can be rather stylish. You can count on a TV (possibly even a flat
screen) and probably a moderately (if not inexpensively) priced
buffet. 
 $$$ ($100–$150): Figure on more and nicer amenities (hair dryers,
robes, better bathroom supplies), health clubs, bigger TVs, larger
rooms and bathrooms. There will likely be Wi-Fi, but you will have
to pay for it. Room service may or may not be standard. The
second-tier mega-resorts on the Strip and some of the noncasino
hotels fall into this category.
 $$$$ ($150–$200): Besides a large, well-decorated room, you can
count on a larger-than-a-closet bathroom with ample towels. In
casino hotels, you can expect to find several restaurants, a health
club, a show or two, and several thousand rooms. Noncasino hotels
usually have a business center.
 $$$$$ ($200 and up): You’re paying for the prestigious name, loca-
tion, and/or service. Expect round-the-clock concierge service,
sumptuous lobbies, elegant décor, and beautiful room furnishings.
You find a full range of amenities, multiple phones (some people
like this; we travel to get away from phones), probably multiple
TVs, fancy beds and linens. Rooms may actually be junior suites.
There will be one or more restaurants for fine dining, a bar and/or
lobby cocktail lounge, nightclubs, and an excellent and expensive
spa/health club.

The Best Hotels in Las Vegas
In the listings below, note that we deliberately didn’t include every
single hotel in town. That would defeat the purpose of giving you some
helpful advice, now wouldn’t it? Because price is such a big factor for
most travelers, we note rack rates in the listings and precede each with
dollar signs to make them easy to reference. Remember, however, that
the prices listed here are the “official” rack rates; they’re rarely what
you’re going to wind up paying. If one of these hotels sounds good to
you but appears to be out of your price range, don’t give up too quickly.
It may be having a special promotion or a slow week that will get you in
for a lower rate than normal. You may as well call to find out.
Note: By late 2009 or early 2010, the massive CityCenter will be open,
adding a 4,000-room mega-resort and two 400-room boutique hotels to
your lodging options. www.citycenter.com. 
Almost all of the hotels listed have free parking for guests (usually self
and valet), unless otherwise noted.
Bally’s Las Vegas
$$$
Center Strip 
Poor Bally’s. Here it is, the very epitome of a Las Vegas hotel, all glitzy glam-
our and neon (not to mention home to the best topless show in town), but
more and more, it just gets overlooked. It’s too upscale to have a theme, so
it lacks that cartoon appeal; but it isn’t upscale enough to compete with the
new luxe wonders on the Strip. It’s even upstaged by its very own Paris Las
Vegas right next door. If only Bally’s had been built in the shape of a pyramid
or put a pirate ship out front. But its loss may be your gain, because prices
can come down quite low. When that’s the case, Bally’s is quite the deal. 
The hotel is centrally located, and you enter from the Strip via moving side-
walks that pass through muted neon-light pillars, waterfalls, and lush land-
scaping. Bright and cheerful marble, wood, and crystal are the rule
throughout. The oversized rooms contain a sofa — a rarity in Las Vegas. The
hotel is not huge in comparison with other Vegas hotels, but it does have
more than 2,800 rooms, an airy casino, a noteworthy spa and fitness center,
tennis and basketball, a handsome Olympic-size swimming pool, and a
whole range of restaurants. It’s connected to Paris via a nice walkway, a
funny transition from gaudy older Vegas to “classy” faux theme Vegas.

small, with only 200 rooms, you forego niceties like a pool, a health club,

Bellagio
$$$$$
Center Strip
A billion dollars will buy you a lot of hotel. Bellagio is determined to show
you what a grown-up experience Las Vegas can be; so much so, that they
don’t want nonguests under 18 to even enter the property, at least at night.
The result is this enormous, gorgeous, and slightly intimidating property.
Bellagio has everything the other hotels have, and then some, just more
sophisticated. It has an art gallery (in Vegas, no less!); some of the best
restaurants in town (including one with Picassos hanging casually on the

walls); a conservatory full of fresh flowers and plants that’s changed
almost monthly to reflect the seasons (one of the little-known gems of
Vegas); a 12-acre lake out front that hosts a water fountain ballet (the
coolest and least-cheesy free show in town); a neoclassical pool area right
out of an Italian villa; plush rooms full of nifty amenities; and big, gleaming
bathrooms.
Oh, it’s grand. Grand, we tell you! (Though at 4,000 rooms, it is honestly
just a little too big to provide the kind of intimate service you gets at most
hotels in the same class and price range. Not that they don’t try hard.)
What it isn’t, is cheap. After all, Bellagios wants to lure the sort of well-
heeled folk who are used to dining with Picassos looking over their shoul-
ders. But just because your own walls may not be graced by Pablo, nothing
prevents you from living the Bellagio life for a couple of days, particularly
because you can sometimes catch the hotel’s normally sky-high rates in
an affordable mood.

Best Western Mardi Gras Inn
$$
Paradise Road
If you’ve ever stayed at any other Best Western motor inn (a very reliable
chain) in the United States, you find more of the same here in terms of
quality and cleanliness. Some exceptions are this one’s larger-than-normal
rooms, manicured lawns, and small casino in the lobby. Single king rooms
have small sitting areas with convertible sofas, and all units have kitch-
enettes. As a bonus, you get a large pool area, two sundecks, and a gazebo-
covered picnic area.

Caesars Palace
$$$$$
Center Strip
This is the archetypical sprawling Vegas hotel, where high class meets high
kitsch. When in Rome, after all. Over the last decade or so Caesers has
thrown more than $2 billion into the place, expanding and remodeling and
then remodeling some more. It’s more Vegas than ever — at least, in the
modern sense of Vegas, which has redefined “elegant” since the days of
kitsch glory. But have no fear: The campy Roman theme lives on, with
marble columns, copies of famous statues, and toga-wearing employees.
True glamour has replaced most of the tacky stuff (kind of sad for those of
us who love all things kitschy), but the hotel still has that great Vegas feel.
Our only problem with Caesers is that this is one of the most confusingly
laid out hotels in the entire city. Despite that one negative, we’ve nearly
been reduced to tears when it’s time to leave.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Las Vegas’s Best Hotels 101

The newer rooms in the towers are generic-beautiful and huge — some
with his and her baths. And even the older rooms have character; some
have sunken tubs in the sleeping areas. For every fabulous new touch —
a stunning swimming pool area and health club/spa, each with a classical
Roman theme — there remains some of the Vegas cheese we love so well,
such as the talking, stiffly moving statues in the shopping area. That shop-
ping area is also a Vegas wonder: a reproduction of an Italian street, down
to the sky overhead, full of famous-name stores — plus a replica of the
Colosseum in Rome, a state of the art showroom currently hosting Bette
Midler, Cher, and Elton John on different nights. Add to this quite a few ter-
rific restaurants (including Spago and the Palm) and one of the best casi-
nos in town, and Caesars remains the place to go for all facets of Vegas life.

Clarion Emerald Springs
$$$
Paradise Road
If you’ve stayed in a typical Clarion, picture one a bit nicer. This one’s an
exceptionally clean and well-tended place offering a low-key, noncasino
alternative to the overwhelming Strip — if you want to hit the town, it’s
only three (big) blocks away. The emphasis is on providing friendly, family-
style service. Standard rooms are large, with sofas, desks, and wet bars with
a fridge. Larger suites with kitchenettes are available, but you pay more.

Circus Circus
$
North Strip
If you have the kids in tow, consider staying at this massive 3,700-room hotel,
unless you are “clownphobic.” (Don’t laugh. Many people are.) It’s the origi-
nal (and now pretty much the only) hotel that specifically caters to children.
The theme is, well, circus, complete with a chaotic carnival and arcade
games on the midway. Don’t miss the circus acts (trapeze, high wire, jug-
glers, and so on) that run most of the day and are visible from the midway
and much of the casino. The kiddies will be properly entertained by the
myriad amusements: an aerial tramway, an arcade, the Adventuredome
indoor theme park, several swimming pools, and even an attached RV park,
run by KOA. While it does come off a bit worn-at-the-edges, Circus Circus is
almost always a great deal for travelers on a budget; and don’t underesti-
mate the value of its family-friendly attitude. Try to avoid the Manor rooms,
which are in glorified motel buildings that have seen better days.

Excalibur
$$
South Strip
This gigantic medieval castle comes complete with moat and drawbridge —
don’t you just love a theme run wild? This used to be a good and reason-
ably priced choice for families, but it’s not nearly as kid-friendly as it used
to be (witness the male strip show in one of the theaters). Worse, step by
step, the theme is getting toned down. Kids will still be pleased with the
attractive swimming pools with waterfalls and waterslides, and love the
sheer enormity and spectacle of it all. Adults often quickly tire of the place
for the same reasons. Budget travelers also love its well-priced rooms,

which got a recent redo and look quite spiffy — good deals happen here
more often than at most other hotels.
The vast size of the hotel — more than 4,000 rooms, five restaurants, 
and a food court, a casino, and medieval-themed video and shopping
arcades — means that it’s mostly hectic and noisy (Camelot was a “shin-
ing spot” not a “quiet spot”). Still, it’s perfectly located at the bustling
south end of the Strip. A handy monorail connects Excalibur to its south-
ern neighbors, Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

Fairfield Inn by Marriott
$$$
Paradise Road
This hotel lies within walking distance of several major restaurants, but
not much else. Consider staying here if you don’t want the full-blown Vegas
experience. It doesn’t even have a casino (in Vegas? Now that’s different!).
Friendly, personal service is the main draw of this small hotel. It offers a
continental breakfast, a living room-style lobby, and a “guest of the day”
who gets a basket of goodies. Rooms are basic motel-style, but they’re
clean and comfortable; and they offer sleeper sofas (great for families).

Fitzgeralds Casino & Hotel
$$
Downtown
Here’s a solid, middle-of-the-road choice for affordable downtown accom-
modations. Once it was an understated ode to the luck o’ the Irish, but a new
owner (the first African-American casino owner in Vegas) has eliminated vir-
tually all such references. Along the way, the place got a subtle but solid
makeover to brighten up the public areas and add a pool, a rare thing for
downtown Vegas. Rooms are pretty standard, but comfortable (slightly
larger Jacuzzi units are available for a few bucks more).The tall tower offers
great views of the mountains or the Strip. Fitzgeralds still has a couple
decent restaurants as well. Be sure to stop by the outdoor balcony off the
casino to get a cool view of the Fremont Street Experience (see Chapter 12).

Flamingo
$$$
Center Strip
Infamous gangster Bugsy Siegel would no longer recognize his baby, which
he opened in 1946 on what would eventually become the Strip. After more
than 60 years and several renovations, nothing is left from Bugsy’s day but

a rumor of escape tunnels under the grounds. Flamingo currently sports
a vaguely Art Deco/tropical theme (no wonder Jimmy Buffett, put one of
his Margaritaville cafe/nightclubs here) and is every bit as neon as you
would like. Most of the rooms have gotten a makeover to turn them ring-
a-ding fabulous — we’re suckers for judicious use of hot pink. The gor-
geous, lush pool and spa area (the former with a couple excellent water
slides) is a major draw. It also has a bustling casino, excellent tennis facil-
ities, a wedding chapel, and some indifferent bars and restaurants. It’s all
too far removed from its past self for nostalgia, but the Central Strip loca-
tion and those new rooms make Flamingo viable.

Four Queens
$$$
Downtown
This is one of the last remnants of the Rat Pack glory days of old Las Vegas.
Except for the brightly colored recently made-over rooms, it can come
across as dated, especially when compared with the new mega-resorts on
the Strip. But the old-time elegance still lingers, and the price is right. The
clientele is older, and these folks are definitely here to gamble, not sight-
see. You get clean, comfortable, quiet rooms and a handful of restaurants
on-site but no pool. Nostalgia buffs and budget travelers will be very
pleased.

Four Seasons
$$$$$
South Strip
If you have money to burn, you can’t go wrong by joining the other fat cats
at Vegas’s one true luxury resort. Not only does the Four Seasons have a
degree in pampering, but with just 400 rooms, it can give far more personal
attention than any other high-profile hotel. Its unusual location within
Mandalay Bay was a bit of an experiment for Vegas. The Four Seasons is
accessible through its own entrance on the other side of the Mandalay Bay
building and has its own lobby, high-speed elevators, pool, and health
club/spa. You don’t, however, have to miss any Vegas fun. On the Four
Seasons side, all is calm and serene. But open a door and presto! — you’re
back in the hustle and bustle of Vegas, heading right into Mandalay Bay’s
casino. It’s the best of both worlds. Still, after you’ve experienced the Four
Seasons kind of serenity, you may find it hard to return to the typical
adrenaline rush. (And as an experiment, it must have worked. Mandalay
Bay has since added their very own version of this kind of set-up,
THEhotel, reviewed later.)
At first glance, rooms don’t appear all that special; but when you sink into
the many comforts (down comforters, fancy amenities, VCRs, bathrobes),

you don’t mind. The staff members are brilliant at fulfilling and even antici-
pating needs, and they love to pamper your children even more than you.
Health club privileges are included here; other hotels often charge extra
for these delights. As a result, the high rack rates aren’t all that out of line
with other high-end, but less accommodating choices; and you can get
good deals here nearly all the time. The Four Seasons also boasts the
excellent (but pricey) Charlie Palmer Steak restaurant.

Golden Nugget
$$$
Downtown
Indisputably the nicest downtown hotel, the golden Nugget is all the better
thanks to a recent makeover that has given it a much fresher feeling. The
larger-than-average, updated rooms are comfortable and pretty, size-wise
on a par with those found at the Mirage. The large pool (rare for down-
town) features an incredibly cool glass tunnel that passes through a shark
tank. Other highlights include a particularly good health club and spa and
several different restaurants. Like any place in downtown, it can be a little
cramped; but at least you won’t feel as if you’re stuck in a time warp.
Despite its superior status, the Nugget can be a surprisingly good deal; if
you catch the prices even close to the lower end, it’s hard to justify spend-
ing the big bucks at a mega-Strip resort.

Green Valley Ranch Resort
$$$
Henderson
We won’t kid you; it’s a drive from here to the Strip. But we picked this fabu-
lous resort because it combines all the things we like best in a hotel — 
the grown-up style and comfort of places like the Ritz and the playful kick-
iness of a W or the Palms. The latter is particularly evident in the pool area,
with its geometric beach pool and mattresses tossed here and there for
supreme and slightly suggestive lounging comfort. Evenings bring even
more sybaritic fun when Whiskey Bar (another of those super-stylish
club/bars designed by Randy Gerber) kicks into gear. The workout room
is small, but the spa is hip. The nicely old-school casino and a number of
affordable restaurants are located in a complex a longish stroll away
(through indoor corridors) that includes a multi-screen movie theater.
This is a good choice for families (especially because Green Valley Ranch
is away from all the obvious sinning of Vegas), as well as for couples seek-
ing a little romantic privacy.

The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino
$$$$
Paradise Road
Gen Xers and baby boomers should run to the Hard Rock: Your people
await! This is one fun hotel. Rock music blares in the wildly and playfully
decorated casino, the center of the circular public area while rock ’n’ roll
memorabilia litters the space and covers the walls. Rock references pop up
everywhere, even in the elevator. While this hotel is not for someone look-
ing for a quiet getaway (it’s loud, loud, loud), it’s definitely the epicenter
of happening Las Vegas. And sometimes, we can’t help but think that if we
Chapter 9: Checking In at Las Vegas’s Best Hotels 107

were Pamela or Britney, or just looked like Pamela or Britney, we’d get
better treatment. Notice that the in-house nightclub is super-exclusive in
a town full of transient visitors. So you know who it caters to: not the aver-
age tourist, that’s for sure.
The pool is mostly too shallow for swimming, but it is perfect for seeing
and being seen — guests can make like Frankie and Annette and do the
Beach Blanket Bingo in the sand by the stage or play swim-up blackjack.
The hotel’s health club/spa is terrific, and several fine restaurants are on-
site. Rooms here are a letdown, however; they’re a bit sterile. But the fur-
nishings are comfy, the thread counts high, the TVs are flat panel, the
stereos Bose, and the French windows actually open (a rarity for Vegas).
Still, who wants to spend time in the room when there is so much fun to
be had downstairs?
Music buffs should check out the memorabilia in the Hard Rock Hotel &
Casino. Some of it’s a little lame, but there’s some cool stuff, too, such as
a smashed guitar from Pete Townsend, James Brown’s “King of Soul” cape
and crown, menus signed by Elvis and Jimi Hendrix, and Greg Allman’s
favorite biker jacket. The Hard Rock now has a permanent, if sad and
unwelcome, bit of rock memorabilia for its collection; John Entwistle, leg-
endary bassist for The Who, died in one of its rooms on the eve of the start
of the band’s 2002 tour. 
New owners are bringing some changes, including a complete reinvention
of the hotel’s signature club, the Joint. Note that there is an extra person
charge of $50 — the highest in town.

Harrah’s Las Vegas
$$$
Center Strip
Harrah’s is one of the friendliest places in town, with its location smack in
the center of the Strip and price making it a solid pick. Still, it does look
dated and as if it’s trying too hard — and not in the good, over-the-top
theme way — next to the splashier places right around it. Don’t come here
thinking you are getting more than just a good deal on a hotel room. The
carnival atmosphere is not overwhelming, and the rooms are large and
comfortably furnished. The carnival-themed casino is certainly festive, and
you can spend some quality time relaxing in the pool, dining at one of the
several restaurants, browsing the shopping and live entertainment plaza
(where our favorite lounge singer, Cook E. Jarr, has a recurring gig), and
sweating at an outstanding gym.

La Quinta Inn
$$$
Paradise Road
This clean and quiet hotel is another good choice if you want to avoid the
hectic Vegas atmosphere. The décor and facilities are comfortable and
even rather attractive, in that cookie-cutter chain manner (which also
brings, let’s note, that chain quality assurance). Rooms range from stan-
dard hotel rooms to two-bedroom suites that feel like apartments; some
have kitchens, and all have whirlpool tubs. You can easily walk to lots of
great restaurants from this locale. Also of note are the heated pool and
friendly staff, plus the free 24-hour shuttle to and from the airport.

Las Vegas Hilton
$$$$$
Paradise Road
Elvis spent the bulk (sorry) of his Fat Years performing at this hotel, but it
caters primarily to business travelers because it’s adjacent to the Las Vegas
Convention Center. The rooms here are large and comfortable, if not all
that striking. Recently upgraded here and there, this hotel has a little bit of
everything one looks for in Vegas. The casino is smaller than most and
tucked to the side of the lobby; it’s handy, but you don’t have to pass
through it every time you leave your room. The atmosphere is more ele-
gant and expensive than not. The Las Vegas Hilton has an extensive selec-
tion of restaurants, a superior recreation deck with a swimming pool and
tennis courts, and a terrific health club/spa where you really feel pampered.

Luxor
$$
South Strip
It’s hard to miss the Luxor; it’s the 30-story pyramid with the Sphinx in
front. And no, the Great Pyramid of Giza is not similarly covered in glass,
nor does it have a 315,000-watt light beam shooting from the top. This used
to be the epitome of a tacky theme park, but a huge renovation has
stripped it of all the ridiculous silliness, to the point that the generic inte-
rior no longer matches the thematic promise of its exterior. It’s a darn
shame. Rooms will have had a total makeover by the time you read this,
stripping them of all that Egypt detailing, but at least the ones in the pyra-
mid will still have cool sloped walls (the baths in those rooms have show-
ers only). And let’s not forget those “inclinator,” the elevators that go at
an angle! It’s the best free ride in town! The hotel houses five big pools, a
large and airy casino, some hot nightclubs and bars, interesting shows,
and an attractions level featuring artifacts from the Titanic and the grue-
somely fascinating preserved bodies science exhibit called Bodyworks. A
mini-monorail connects you with Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.

Downtown
This surprisingly sweet hotel — hard to believe in Vegas, but true — is one
of the nicest downtown choices and a really great bargain, to boot. It does
a good job of evoking turn-of-the-century San Francisco with charming décor
that includes gas lanterns, stained-glass windows, and lazy ceiling fans in
the casino, plus plantation shutters and comfy furniture in the average-size
rooms. Although it is not located right on Fremont Street like most other
downtown hotels, it’s less than a 5-minute walk away. And the in-house
dining and entertainment options are better than those at many of the other
downtown hotels, including one of the two best buffets found downtown
(and maybe in all of Vegas), a particularly handsome steakhouse, a micro-
brewery that is great for snacking, and bar-type nighttime hangouts. The
only drawbacks are potential freeway noise and the lack of a health club and
pool, although you can use the one at The California across the street.

Mandalay Bay
$$$$$
South Strip
In case you were wondering, it’s named after a Kipling poem. (Who says
Vegas can’t be educational?) A Kipling-themed hotel? No such luck. There
aren’t any mini-Mowglis or Baloos running around singing about the bear
necessities. Perhaps that’s just as well. Immediate access to the guest ele-
vators off the aquarium and bird-studded lobby avoids the usual tiring slog
through casino mayhem such as that found at so many of its peers and the
superb unimpeded views of the entire Strip includes with the planes land-
ing at the airport. The hotel has particularly large, handsome rooms (king
rooms come off better than doubles) with large bathrooms (some of the
biggest and nicest around; you may never get out of that sunken tub). The
pool area is hands down the best in Vegas — with a wave pool, a lazy
“river,” an open-air casino, and some basic pools, there is something here
for every water taste. And the giant aquarium — oops, we mean Shark
Reef Exhibit — is a blood pressure–lowering pleasure (if a tad expensive).
Mandalay Bay is also home to the House of Blues, where many of the best
bands in rock and blues play when they’re in town; it’s a better venue over-
all than its rival the Hard Rock. All the restaurants here, many of which are
quite good, have extraordinarily striking décor. “But I don’t want to be so
far south on the Strip,” you say. No need to worry. A free monorail takes
you to Excalibur (also stopping at Luxor); then catty-corner across the
street is the official Strip monorail, which will take you all the way to the
Convention Center, if you want. Although the emphasis here is on adult
Chapter 9: Checking In at Las Vegas’s Best Hotels 111

pleasures, Mandalay Bay isn’t a bad option for parents traveling with off-
spring: It offers variety, and you don’t have to negotiate through R-rated
territory to get Junior to his fun. Note that Mandalay Bay has a sort of
annex, THEhotel, reviewed later.

MGM Grand
$$$$
South Strip
This is not the biggest hotel in the world. It’s only the second-biggest hotel
in the world. Rhode Island could comfortably fit inside its casino, which is
also one of the biggest in the world. Clearly, this is not a cozy, intimate
locale. The theme, such as it is, is classic MGM movies; some of the rooms,
in addition to having stand-out minimalist 1930s glamour-evoking furni-
ture, also feature black-and-white movie-star photos. Other rooms are a
bit more hotel pedestrian, while still others in the so-called West Wing are
tiny but stylish, with the kind of sleek “W” appointments that are all the
rage these days. The staff somehow manages to be attentive despite the
overwhelming hugeness.
The pool area is fabulous, with big bodies of water, a lazy river, and many
acres to play and splash around in, but note that during the “off-season”
(most nonsummer months), much of it can be closed. The Asian-Zen spa
is luxurious and grown-up. The MGM Grand has a fine lineup of restau-
rants: Joel Robucohn at the Mansion and Robucohn’s L’Atelier, The
Wolfgang Puck Cafe, Emeril Legasse’s New Orleans Fish House, the
Rainforest Cafe, and Tom Colicchio’s Craftsteak, to name just a few. 
The whole thing is overseen outside by a four-story-tall gleaming gold lion.
He’s photo-op ready, but you may want to save your film for the Lion
Experience, which allows you to visit and even have your photo taken
with real-life Simbas.

We just dig this hotel. While there may be others doing it somewhat better,
all they are doing is building on what the Mirage began.

vanilla-scented air, soothe jangled nerves by staring at the 200,000-gallon
aquarium behind the reception desk, stroll through the indoor rain forest,
loll by the tropical pool with much foliage, waterfalls, and water slides, go
play with some dolphins, have a fab meal (the buffet is a particularly good),
rejuvenate at the luxe spa and health club, or gamble in the jolly casino. And
when your clock winds down, you can sleep it off in one of the nicest rooms
in town for the price; see if you can get one that overlooks the volcano’s

Monte Carlo Resort & Casino
$$$$
South Strip
In case you didn’t know, Monte Carlo is the capital of Monaco (where Grace
Kelly became Princess Grace, and where her children still challenge the
Windsors for gossip-page headlines) and the Vegas of Europe — at least, in
the sense that they’ve also got a lot of casinos. But in Monaco, they go in
for classy gambling; think James Bond in his tux, playing baccarat, with a
beautiful girl (or ten) on his arm, and you will get an idea of what the inten-
tion is here, ambience-wise. This immense hotel reproduces the opulence of
its namesake with colonnades, arches, fountains, and enormous statues that
are nearly in good taste. A recent headline-grabbing fire didn’t cause major
damage, but did spur a long overdue room redecoration which should be
done by the time you read this. Of course, you find the usual array of restau-
rants and bars, plus a showroom and casino. The hotel’s pool area has
pleased many a guest, but we think looks dingy compared to Mandalay Bay.
(Kids generally like this area a lot, but they will probably be bored by the
rest.) Grown-ups love the fabulous spa, which offers all the equipment and
treatments you could want. The highly recommended restaurant Andre’s
has a branch here, and the Lance Burton show is one of the best in town.

New York-New York
$$$$
South Strip
Now this is more like it. None of that namby-pamby “luxury resort” good-
taste crap. No, this is Vegas at its finest, following the honored tradition of
taking a theme and beating it into the ground. And good golly, is it fun. It’s
almost impossible to do this place justice in just a few sentences, but here
goes. The exterior is an actual reproduction of the New York skyline, with
one-third-scale replicas of the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building,
the Statue of Liberty, and the Brooklyn Bridge. Inside, you stroll through
versions of Greenwich Village, Times Square, and Central Park. The arcade
is tricked up like Coney Island, there are cobblestone streets in the Village,
and there’s even (not naughty) graffiti. Hey, and just for flavor, a roller
coaster runs through the whole thing.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Las Vegas’s Best Hotels 113

The rooms can be smallish (just like New York!), and vary wildly in size.
Sadly, the theme ends there; rooms are getting a makeover that will proba-
bly bland them down in same manner of their peers. Note that it can be a
very long, confusing, tortuous walk to just about anywhere in the hotel, even
from the elevator to your room. Guests with disabilities should make this
clear when reserving, or perhaps skip this hotel altogether. The spa and pool
aren’t as great as those at other hotels. The hotel is nearly always crowded,
and there’s definitely a sensory overload factor, especially in the casino. But
boy, is it a hoot. If you don’t stay here, you have to at least stop by to see it.

Orleans
$$
South Strip
This is one terrific value. As the name implies, this is the Las Vegas inter-
pretation of New Orleans, complete with French Quarter influences, Mardi
Gras beads given away just for stopping in, and Cajun and zydeco music
playing in the casino. It’s actually located about a mile west of the Strip. We
recommend this place primarily for the rooms; they are among the biggest
in town, with comfortable Victorian parlor-style furnishings, although as
in a true Victorian parlor, the clutter can make matters cramped. You can
often get terrific prices here — so what’s a little distance? This is a
medium-size hotel with the usual array of bars and restaurants (including
a New Orleans-themed nightclub and a very good Mexican restaurant that
makes its own tortillas), plus two medium-size swimming pools, movie thea-
ters, a large childcare center, and a 70-lane bowling alley open nearly round
the clock, a sports arena, and much more.

Palace Station 
$$
West of the Strip 
Located a few minutes off the Strip, this is one of the so-called “locals
hotels.” What do they know that a tourist doesn’t? That though parts of
this hotel are old-fashioned (dark, crowded), the nicely decorated Tower
rooms are as streamlined up-to-date as anything on the Strip, with comforts
like big flat screen TVs, coffeemakers and free Wi-Fi, for a lot less money.
(You want the Tower rooms as opposed to the still spiffy, but more motel-y
Courtyard rooms, though the latter are even cheaper.) It has all the ele-
ments you want in a Vegas hotel — airport shuttle, good cheap buffet, other
affordable restaurants, lounges, a comedy club, a newly refurbished pool
and a well-stocked casino — but for a lot less money. It even has a shuttle
to the Strip, where you can go spend a lot of money, if you insist.

Palms Resort & Casino
$$$
West of Strip 
Staying at the Palms (across from the Rio, a few blocks off the Strip) is
pretty much a toss-up, and your decision to stay here should be based on
your priorities. Want the one of the hottest hotels in town, one that tries
to straddle the line between posh and friendly? Want a place that actively
caters to the hip and the happening, with trendy nightclubs (Rain) and
bars (ghostbar)? Want some of the most comfortable beds in town? Want
movie theaters and a really good, inexpensive buffet? Want to stay where
Britney spent her first ill-fated honeymoon night? Then stay here. Want
something with thematic punch? Want to be right on the Strip? Want to
not pay near-Strip prices for an off-Strip room, even a nice room with big
TVs and bathrooms? Want to avoid having to deal with a lot of zero-
percent-body-fat riffraff? Then go elsewhere. We love the beds, the collec-
tion of better-than-average chain restaurants in the food court, and the
restaurant Alize; but man, do we hate the crowds at night. But maybe that’s
because we can’t fit into size 2 Seven jeans.

Paris Las Vegas Casino Resort
$$$$$
Center Strip
Ooh la la. If the French get snippy over foreigners mangling their language,
what on earth must they think of this place: a hotel, fashioned by vulgar
Americans, no less, that re-creates all their most cherished monuments
(the Eiffel Tower, looming nearly as large as the original, the Louvre, and
the Arc de Triomphe)? You find signs in somewhat dubious French (“Le
Car Rental”) and employees who sprinkle all transactions with various
phrases (“Bonjour et merci, Madame!”). Who cares? We do. That’s the kind
of devotion to theme we can really get behind. Rooms here are perfectly
nice and perfectly forgettable. The health club has pretensions of posh,
and the pool area is cold and sterile. A number of restaurants will appeal,
in varying degrees, to the Francophile; we particularly like Mon Ami Gabi.
You can ride up to the near-top of the half-size Eiffel Tower, if you have a
mind, and kiss your amour. Put it that way, and pourquoi pas (why not)?

Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino
$$$$
South Strip
As sentimentalists, we were sorry to see the old Aladdin go — it’s where
Elvis married ’Scilla, don’t you know. As chroniclers of modern Vegas, we
shake our heads with wonder over the transformation of the new Aladdin
into the even newer Planet Hollywood. It’s not that the new Aladdin was that
spectacular, but its brief existence dramatically demonstrates how fast
Vegas changes these days. So Planet Hollywood it is now (for the time being,
anyway) and that means another wacky theme bites the dust. In its place
are admittedly striking acres of gleaming wood and dazzling glass, plus an
eye-catching shiny new exterior. We really do like the rooms, each of which
contains a central piece of memorabilia — from Judy Garland’s dress 
from The Good Old Summer Time or the sword from Wesley Snipes-starring
Blade — with more souvenirs contained in a glass-topped table. It’s a good
gimmick in a town that is strangely moving away from gimmicks, and it does
give the quite comfortable rooms some zingy personality. Note that self-
parking here means leaving your car at the other side of the adjoining shop-
ping mall, the Miracle Mall, which you have to then shlep bags through to
reach the registration desk. Guests with mobility issues must be sure to use
the casino valet parking, which is located right outside check-in.

This billion-dollar resort was created by the same people behind the splen-

the setting, perched overlooking the incredible formations that make up the
Red Rock National Conservancy area. If what you are looking for is a true
luxury resort retreat getaway, this place has it all: lush, colorful rooms (42-
inch plasma TVs!); fancy swimming area; excellent restaurants; and even a
terrific-looking casino. It’s a resort of choice for tabloid favorites looking for
a lower profile vacation, and no wonder. For the rest of us mortals, we hope
that the habit of sneaking in extra charges (a “resort fee”? Are they kidding?),
to say nothing of a high ticket price (recall this is still 11 miles from the Strip,
thanks, and this is a Vegas vacation), all gets ironed out, because we really,
really want to stay here. In the mean time, drop by on your way to and from
Red Rock to try out the branch of Austin’s favorite Salt Lick barbeque.

Rio Hotel & Casino
$$$$
West of Strip
Although it’s not at the top of our list, lots of people love this hotel for its
carnival ambience, tropical theme, and oversized rooms. The rooms are
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
116

big, all right, featuring sectional sofas, small refrigerators, and very nifty
floor-to-ceiling windows offering fab views; but they’re not quite the
“suites” the hotel touts. Downsides here include location (a solid 20-
minute walk from the Strip) and a sometimes unfriendly staff. If you’re
easily overwhelmed, you may not enjoy the hectic, party-all-the-time
atmosphere; and it’s not a good choice for families with kids.
The hotel includes a 41-story tower and a “European” village of shops and
restaurants that is worth strolling through. A live-action show with a car-
nival theme (sort of a mock Mardi Gras parade that moves about on tracks
overhead), called Masquerade in the Sky, runs periodically throughout
the day. The Rio is justly proud of its array of restaurants and bars, which
includes a popular buffet, the restaurant RUB, a wine bar where you can
indulge in tastings, and the Voodoo Lounge. The swimming pools are a bit
of a bust compared with some others in town, and the older parts of the
casino can be too confining; head to the section housed in the newer
expansion. Finally, the Penn & Teller show, surely the smartest show in
Vegas, is in residency here.

Ritz-Carlton Lake Las Vegas

Henderson
Now, this is really far away, a good half hour’s drive from Vegas. But we
have no compunction directing you here, to perhaps the only true luxury
resort in Vegas and the vicinity. The Ritz does everything right, from its
classy public areas to its softly colored rooms (so comfortable that on
more then one occasion, we had to be dragged out of them), all of which
overlook either breathtaking mountains or Lake Las Vegas itself. One arm
of the hotel even extends right over the lake. Wave to the fish passing
below and to the celebs who own houses up the shore. For an extra $100
a night, you can stay in one of the “Club Level” rooms, where guests have
access to a special lounge featuring free and delicious snacks all day long,
plus free drinks. Do the math: It’s worth it if you are traveling with kids.
And check the Internet to see about the frequent special deals on the start-
ing rate for rooms and spa packages. We just saw one for $249 a night,
including a breakfast for two adults and two children! It’s chock-full of
activities unlike any other hotel in Vegas (hiking, fly-fishing, boating, star-
gazing, even free yoga classes). The gym is one of the best stocked, and
unlike most of the other luxury hotels in town, it’s free. Nearby is the
Monte Lago Italian-themed village, complete with a casino and a number
of shops and restaurants.

Riviera Hotel & Casino

North Strip
This 50-something-year-old Vegas institution is showing its age, sadly; we
include it here as an option only if you can get a good deal and you simply
must stay on the Strip. Its once-elegant décor now seems more than a
touch seedy, an impression that’s reinforced by the topless revues that are
heavily featured (and even enshrined; the Riviera displays a bronze statue
commemorating the remarkable derrières featured in its show Crazy Girls
in full view of the street). The Riviera is definitely not a good choice for
families; but the rooms are adequate, and you can choose from tons of
shows and snacking places to keep you entertained. Amenities here
include a vast casino, an Olympic-size pool and sundeck, a large video
arcade, a health club, two tennis courts, and a wedding chapel.

North Strip
This Vegas institution, a major player since 1952, is looking forward to
some major renovations thanks to a relatively new owner. We hope it will
give the old girl a new place in her town. Meanwhile, she’s an old hotel
with spots of wear. Chandeliers and marble vie with the onion domes and
mosaic tile they’ve thrown in for the Arabian Nights theme. We’re not really
sure how the roller coaster fits in. These public areas aren’t bad at all; but
the guest rooms are on the smallish side and despite cosmetic upgrades,
they can never compare to the grander palaces down the street. Still, the
rates can be cheap. The hotel is located in an out-of-the-way spot on the
North Strip, which is a plus or a minus, depending on how you look at it.
A very attractive Olympic-size pool has Moroccan tiles and a sundeck, plus
a large casino and several restaurants and bars.

Northern Las Vegas 
We must be honest with you; this hotel, located on the far north side of
Vegas, is a long way from anywhere. So why are we including it? Because
of the cost; rooms start at $40 a night, and with promotions that some-
times fall even lower, while the high end doesn’t top $99. That’s a strong
lure for the budget traveler who wants a proper Vegas hotel experience, as
opposed to a noncasino chain hotel. Said rooms are nothing spectacular.
They are motel rooms, but really nice motel rooms, complete with pillow
top mattresses and wireless Internet. The property itself has a little piz-
zazz, and includes plenty of amenities such as various food options
(including a branch of the excellent Salt Lick BBQ), a large bowling alley,

movie theaters, and an excellent child care facility. Assuming traffic is in

South Point

South Strip
Given how vast the distance can be from one major hotel to another on
the Strip (blocks and blocks, sometimes), you don’t need to actually stay
on it, especially if you took our advice and rented a car. Much of the time,
you’re going to be driving or cabbing it from one location to another
anyway. Given that, do your wallet a favor and stay here. Just 6 miles down
Las Vegas Boulevard South from Mandalay Bay, this “locals hotel” offers
genuinely attractive rooms (500 sq. ft., flat screen TVs, handsome linens)
for a fraction of the price of, say, a Wynn or a Bellagio. Add to that a
number of affordable dining options, movie theaters, a bowling alley, and
more, and those staying farther north begin to look like real suckers.
Meanwhile, you take the money you’ve saved each night, hop in your
rental car, and go spend it on a good show or a fancy meal. Now who’s the

Stratosphere Las Vegas
$$$
North Strip
A 106-story observation tower makes this the tallest building west of the
Mississippi. Aside from really stunning views (the lights, the desert, the
mountains — day or night, Vegas looks mighty fine from way above
ground), the tower has the world’s highest thrill rides, including a free-fall
contraption, a whirly-gig style device that spins you around in mid-air, and
a giant teeter-totter style thing that sends you flying off the side of the
building. A wedding chapel completes the aforementioned views. Cool!
And the staff is incredibly nice. But it does have drawbacks: It’s quite a
trek to anything else on the Strip, and this end of the Strip isn’t very attrac-
tive. The rooms aren’t in the tower itself, so don’t expect those tremen-
dous views from your own windows; plus they really can’t be described
more generously than “really nice for a motel.” Other extras include a
casino, a huge pool, and a shopping arcade with a World’s Fair theme.
We’ve heard from some of the locals that the Stratosphere offers the
best gambling odds on the Strip. We’re not sure if it’s true, but it’s quite
possible in light of its need to attract customers to the farthest reaches
of the Strip. Hey, it may be worth a shot.

THEhotel at Mandalay Bay
$$$$
South Strip
If we had to pick one place to stay on the Strip, and assuming price were not
a major issue, we would not hesitate in choosing THEhotel. Heck, even if
price were an issue, we would still pick it, we are so in love with it right now.
For all intents and purposes an entire separate hotel entity within Mandalay
Bay, this is as sophisticated and mature as any happening hotel in
Manhattan, swanky and stylish enough so that one seasoned traveler we
know declared it perhaps the nicest she’d ever experienced. Because it has
an entirely different entrance, you are in a different world than Mandalay
Bay, one that makes that oh-so-Vegas hotel suddenly seem rather crass. A
sleek and modern black and tan palette follows you from the lobby to the
rooms, which are all genuine one bedroom suites, complete with extra half
bath, wet bar, three plasma TVs, and the most heavenly bathrooms in Vegas.
The soaking tub is so deep that the water came to our chin. And the beds!
Divine! Sure, it’s another of these wannabe boutique hotels that are blown
up so large they can’t possibly deliver the service of a real such place. At
the same time, the design concept and resulting comfort are so successful,
it’s hard to care much. Best of all, all the frolicking noisy fun of Mandalay
Bay is but a stroll down a hallway. Guests have access to the famous
Mandalay Bay pool, plus their own pool area, a couple handsome if ordinary
cafes and bars, and one grand, gorgeous, and overpriced spa/gym complex.

Once upon a time, this was a silly, pirate themed hotel, one that epitomized
the “family-friendly” Vegas vacation experiment. That it has since been
stripped of nearly all pirate references, and even renamed to remove the

120

Stevenson-related title, demonstrates how much, and we cannot stress this
enough, Vegas is not for families anymore.
And although the goal to turn the resort into a hipster or posh adult hang-
out wasn’t reached, it’s still a fine place to stay. Truth be told, its rooms are
currently better than those of its older sibling, The Mirage. Expect a decent
amount of space, particularly nice bathrooms, and handsome rooms with
good beds, done in a brown palette. Not a single doubloon in sight. The
pirates are still present in one form, in the free, Strip-side Sirens of TI pirate
battle, where they now, sadly, battle sexy scantily clad showgirls in one of
the worst pieces of trash ever to hit Vegas, and that’s saying a lot. Poor
pirates. The pool is minimally interesting, but the spa and health club are
quite good. There are a few ordinary restaurants and bars, and the few
kids who still come here, if they are more sophisticated than much of the
short-attention-span generation, will enjoy Cirque du Soleil’s Mystère,

Tropicana Resort & Casino
$$$$
South Strip
For some time, the Trop’s future has been in doubt, with the consequence
that while every one of its peers has had at least one, and in some cases,
multiple makeovers recently, this property has not been touched in ages.
The result is the opposite of fresh. Anything could happen, so matters
could change by the time you read this. In the mean time, what the Trop
has going for it: location (on the busiest corner in Vegas, across from MGM
Grand, New York-New York, and Excalibur), lower than average prices,
and a heck of a pool area. As a matter of fact, it has three pools — one
Olympic-size — and a few whirlpools set in a beautifully landscaped
garden with waterfalls and lagoons. One of the pools even has a swim-up
blackjack table in the summer so that you can gamble and work on your
tan at the same time. What the Trop has going against it: just about every-
thing else. Its Island Tower rooms are tacky, and the Garden Court rooms
are best not discussed at all. The interior is confusing and increasingly
icky looking, both on its own and in comparison with newer properties.
Even the birds that used to be everywhere are gone, so the place is look-
ing less distinctive (if less messy with guano) every minute. Pedestrian
walkways link the hotel with the Luxor, the MGM Grand, and Excalibur.

Center Strip
What a cool place this is. Normally, we get all smug and patronizing about
Vegas re-creations of famous locales and feel the need to gently remind
Chapter 9: Checking In at Las Vegas’s Best Hotels 121

you, “now, this isn’t really like seeing the actual place, you know.” But when
we walk around the outside of the Venetian, through some re-creations of
famous portions of Venice, Italy (itself a tourist destination for 400 years),
which now sit grandly on the Strip, noting the meticulous attention to
detail, we think, “Well, actually, this is a great deal like the original.” Except
it’s less smelly and decayed, and not nearly as organic and authentically
beautiful. But then, you knew that much. Your jaw will drop upon seeing
the grand, sweeping, heavily marbled galleria, its ceiling covered in hand-
made re-creations of noted Venetian paintings, and the ambitious and
amazing shopping area, where Venetian buildings line an actual canal, com-
plete with singing gondoliers. You can take a ride with them while listen-
ing to costumed strolling minstrels burst into Italian arias, or you can flirt
with Casanova and other famous Venetians in a small-scale clone of St.
Mark’s Square.
And then there are the rooms, each a junior suite measuring 700 square
feet (the largest and probably most handsome in Vegas), with grand bath-
rooms and steps leading down to a sunken living room. Do not expect
rooms like these in the real Venice. A 2004 addition, the Venezia, offers the
same rooms, only even frillier, plus separate check-in and public areas
entirely apart from the main hotel’s. This means not only no head-achy
casino contact, but also a stylish environment rather like a Ritz-Carlton (if
one on steroids; it’s still absurdly big). This option is perfect for adults
wanting to have their Vegas cake and eat it too. And the restaurants rival
those at Bellagio for high-quality food (and prices to match) made by
celebrity chefs, including the superlative bistro Bouchon, by famed chef
Thomas Keller. The swimming-pool area is a disappointment, lacking the
lush greenery and style of similar hotels. The spa area is provided cour-
tesy of the highly touted Canyon Ranch Spa; there is nothing else like it
(alas, including the cost) in Vegas.
Note: The Venetian has a sister property, the Palazzo (% 877-883-6423 or
702-607-7777), which, while lacking the exterior Venice theme, in terms of
grand interior, gourmet restaurants, high-end shopping, and stunning “all-
suite” rooms, is virtually identical. For some reason, it’s also a bit more
costly. But it sure is nice.

Westin Casuarina Las Vegas Hotel & Spa
$$$$
Center Strip
We were excited when the old seedy Maxim was stripped to its iron girder
bones in order to get entirely made over as a Westin. Vegas needs a true
boutique hotel, and while this isn’t the hippest choice, it’s still a good
brand name. The results, however, are mixed: The casino may be new, but
it sure looks old, even more so when stacked next to the streamlined new
lobby, all business-class posh. Rooms are comfortable (though the much-
touted, admittedly cloudlike Heavenly Beds use too much polyester for
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
122

our persnickety selves) and in good taste, but even our love of sage green
is not enough for us to ignore the fact that compared to the dazzling won-
ders at, say, THEhotel, this hotel is rather plain. What it comes down to is
this: Who wants business traveler good taste in Vegas? Still, the gym is
decent; there is a pool and a cafe; and if you’re sensitive to smoke, the
entire place (with the exception of the small casino) is a nonsmoking zone.
Overall, the size is so refreshingly manageable that it may be just what you
need, if what you need is a smart and sharp hotel with no Vegas person-
ality at all, and just enough removed from Vegas distractions so that you
can get some work done, but close enough so that you can get distracted
when your work is done.

Wynn Las Vegas
$$$$$
North Strip
Steve Wynn is directly responsible for the look of modern Las Vegas, and
the opening of any of his hotels is an event. Since Wynn Las Vegas bore his
name, not to mention a nearly $3-billion price tag and his declaration that
it would be like no other hotel anyone had ever seen, expectations were
high (to put it mildly). So what did it turn out to be? Big, expensive, and
remarkably like Bellagio — Wynn’s last Vegas venture — in far too many
spots. Oh, it’s gorgeous, for sure; the rooms are large and snazzy with
Warhol silk screens, flat screen TV’s, deep soaking tubs, and oomphy beds.
The collection of restaurants is terrific. 
But the hotel is structured old-school style; you have to wiggle through
the mazelike casino to get anywhere. The check-in area is too cramped for
a facility this large. The fabled 150-foot manmade mountain can only be
glimpsed in bits from inside the hotel, and the high-tech free show dis-
played there is only visible from a viewing platform that fits about a dozen
people or from an expensive restaurant or bar. And everything seems to
cost a lot. Finally, at no time do you think, “Wow. This is something else,
again!” There is no particular theme apart from “posh resort” (unless you
count the floral motif, which Bellagio did first). We want glitz, but we want
it silly, too. And if we go to a resort, we want a certain level of personal
service that is hard to pull off on a nearly 4000-room scale. Don’t get us
wrong; we’d stay here in an instant. But in the end, it’s still just another
big fancy Vegas hotel, with a big fancy nightly price to match. By the time
you read this, an annex, Encore, will be open, bringing with it even more
rooms, restaurants, and shops.

Chapter 10
Dining — Las Vegas Style
In This Chapter
 Exploring the Las Vegas dining scene
 Figuring out dress codes
 Cutting food costs
 Snacking on the go
 Making reservations
L
as Vegas is not only about gambling and having fun. Although you
may be tempted to spend all your time in front of a slot machine,
you’ve gotta keep that blood sugar up, you know. Las Vegas has a real
dining scene; in fact, in some of the larger hotels, you can hang out for a
week and never eat in the same place twice. But there’s more to Las
Vegas dining than what you find adjacent to a casino.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
It used to be that food snobs/foodies/chowhounds/gourmands/or simply
anyone with well-developed taste buds never put the words “good,”
“food,” and “Vegas” in the same sentence. But in the last few years, that
has changed dramatically. All kinds of celebrity chefs — you know, the
ones who have very famous (and expensive) restaurants that are often
written about in glossy magazines, or their own line of frozen foods, or
their own show on the Food Network — have opened restaurants in
Vegas. You can thank the owners of those fancy luxury resort hotels.
Apparently, they figured that budget travelers will eat anything put before
them, but if they wanted the well-heeled to come to Vegas, they had to
feed them in the manner to which they were accustomed. It’s rather
snobby, but no matter — we are just mighty glad. You should be, too.
Meals for high rollers
If you really want to eat well in Vegas, and you don’t have a trust fund,
hit that jackpot and feel free to start in at the top. Alas, that’s probably
the only way to afford it all. If it’s some consolation, you wouldn’t have
time to eat at all the amazing places now open. 

Ease your wallet’s strain a little by having just one or two blow-out 
meals — that is, if you can narrow your decision down to just one or
two. We certainly can’t. Just look at this partial (and mouth-watering)
list: Aside from Wolfgang Puck’s half-dozen or so places (including
Spago, the famous Beverly Hills restaurant haunted by celebrities), 
and those of Emeril Lagasse, Vegas has branches of such New York City
favorites as Mesa Grill and Aureole; branches of such Los Angeles
favorites as Pinot, Nobu, and Border Grill; a branch of the San
Francisco favorite Michael Mina (aka Aqua); and restaurants by famed
chefs such as Thomas Keller, Mario Batali, Julian Serrano, Paul Bartolotta,
Daniel Boulard, Jean-Georges, Alex Stratta, and Todd English, not to men-
tion now local, by way of New Orleans, chef Michael Jordan. Most signifi-
cantly, multi-Michelin-starred chef Joel Robuchon opened up two
eponymous restaurants in the MGM Grand, to universal shouts of
hosanna. (Not to mention cries “$350 a person — are you out of your
mind?”) Whew! By the time you get through all that, you may well be a
foodie yourself. You certainly will have been exposed to some dining
that is every bit as significant and special as that found in more tradi-
tional culinary capitals.
Not all the good news is strictly at the top end of the scale, just most of
it. “But I thought Vegas was supposed to have such cheap food!” Well,
Vegas is not such a budget vacation any longer. You can try the more
affordable dining options, but a slide down in price generally brings a
drop in quality as well.
Eat to the beat
Before bringing out the name-brand chefs, Vegas first jumped on the
theme restaurant bandwagon. Name just about any hobby or passion —
rock music, motorcycles, sports — and there’s a restaurant for you. The
Hard Rock Cafe, Planet Hollywood, and ESPN Zone are just a few of the
names here.
Belly up to the buffet
Buffets used to be the way to eat in Vegas. They’ve been an institution in
Vegas since the 1940s, when the El Rancho Hotel offered an all-you-can-
eat spread for a buck! Unlimited prime rib and shrimp — $1! Wa-hoo!
Heck, nothing says “vacation” like that.
But along with everything else in Vegas, buffets have gone upscale. You
still find them everywhere; every major hotel (and most minor ones) has
one. Unfortunately, they aren’t really such bargains anymore, particu-
larly the good ones where it’s hard to eat $20 (or more) worth of food in
one sitting (though, heaven knows, you feel compelled to try). You can
find a few relatively inexpensive ones in town, but the quality of those . . .
well, sometimes it just doesn’t bear thinking about. Still, a Las Vegas
vacation isn’t really complete without at least one visit to a buffet. We
review some of the best bets in this chapter.
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
128

Dressing to dine, Las Vegas style
For the most part, Las Vegas is a very informal town. You see people in
jeans at even the best restaurants. A few places require jackets and
forbid all-American denim, so bring at least one nice outfit. A general
rule is if you have to call to make a reservation, ask about a dress code
while you’re on the phone. If you don’t have to make reservations, don’t
worry about what you’re wearing.
Reserving a table: The only sure bet in Vegas
If you plan on going to any of the high-profile fancy-schmancy places,
make your reservations as far in advance as possible. Unless you’re a
high roller, it’s unlikely that you get a table at the best hotel restaurants
without making a reservation beforehand. If you didn’t reserve ahead,
try to go on off-hours — 6 p.m. or 10 p.m. — when the restaurant is less
likely to be full.
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
You can easily feed a family of four for under $40 (though not in a nutri-
tionally sound way) in Las Vegas; on the other hand, you can quickly blow
$200 on dinner for two. We discuss the latter earlier in this chapter; the
former can be achieved through careful application of those famous Vegas
meal specials, as well as by seeking out your favorite chain restaurants.
If you want to try all the mouth-watering, foodie-heaven, critically
acclaimed restaurants but your budget doesn’t allow for it, note which
ones are open for lunch. You often find similar menu offerings at much
more affordable prices.
Also keep in mind that the farther away from tourist areas you are, the
better the food bargains. You aren’t going to find those famous cheap
Vegas food specials at many of the name-brand hotels, but check the
hotels downtown, on the northern end of the Strip, and just off the Strip
Just follow the locals.
Chapter 10: Dining — Las Vegas Style 129
Smoking etiquette: Lighting up
Smokers can still enjoy cigarettes in Vegas in the way they can’t in many major
American cities. It’s legal to smoke in casinos, which, of course, counts for a large
area of indoor public places. But it’s illegal to smoke in enclosed areas in restaurants
(and bars that serve food), stores, malls, or in any restaurant that adjoins said casino
areas. Confused? Figure you can freely light up in the casino and your basic bars, but
not anywhere else. 

Where the locals meet to eat
If you don’t have a trust fund, your best bet is to dine with the locals.
Many a local has sworn to us that they don’t bother cooking because
eating out in Vegas is so cheap. With all the great meal deals offered by
the hotels, it can be more affordable to eat out. Obviously, this doesn’t
hold true at those celebrity-chef, name-brand places — though you will
find locals there, to be sure, on special occasions.
Keep in mind that when it comes to dining bargains, “great” refers to
price, not quality. Oh, don’t worry; that $1.99 shrimp cocktail is safe
enough. People chow down on these bargain meals all the time, happy
to save a few bucks that may have been spent at the blackjack table; and
they all seem to live to tell about it. Actually, we know someone who
loves the meal deals simply because they are often offered in the middle
of the night. When he can’t sleep, he just tromps downstairs and
munches on a steak. 
It’s almost impossible to list specifics, because they change weekly, but
here are a few places that offer bargain-basement food prices. Please
remember that these are just a random recent sampling. These more
than likely will not be available when you are town, as these sorts of
deals can change weekly. Don’t worry, though; something else will have
taken their place:
 Cannery Casino’s Victory Café (2121 E. Craig Rd., North Las Vegas;
% 702-507-5700). The low cost of $1.99 gets you a big breakfast
with two eggs, home fries, and bacon or sausage from midnight to 7
a.m. on weekdays; Friday and Saturday the special starts at 2 a.m.
 The California Aloha Specialties (12 E. Ogden, Downtown; 
% 702-385-1222). The magic number here is $3.00 for your choice
of a chicken rice bowl, a teri-burger, or an old-fashioned hamburger,
all with choice of sides.
 Ellis Island (4178 Koval Lane, near Flamingo; % 702-733-8901).
Legendary for their meal deal specials, Ellis Island offers a 10-ounce
steak, potato, bread, and green beans for $6.99.
 Bill’s Victorian Room (3595 Las Vegas Blvd. S., center strip; 
% 702-737-7111). Got $15? It buys you a 10-ounce prime rib dinner
with salad, onion rings, and a baked potato right here on the Strip.
 Gold Coast Sports Book (4000 W. Flamingo Rd., just west of the
Strip; % 702-367-7111). What goes better with the big game than a
hot dog, served from an authentic vendor’s cart for just $1.25!
 Terrible’s Bougainvillea Café (4100 Paradise Rd., at Flamingo; 
% 702-733-7000). The 24-hour cafe has several daily specials that
aren’t listed on the menu, including a $6.99 New York steak or $9.99
for a T-bone steak or prime rib. Just ask the server for the hidden
deals.
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
130

The best way to find other bargains is to read the signs in front of the
various casinos and check for coupons inside the many free magazines
that are available inside Vegas hotel rooms and on the Strip. They
always advertise current meal deals.
Chow down on the chain gang
You can also find a slew of national chain restaurants in Las Vegas —
Denny’s, Tony Roma’s, Olive Garden, and so on — but they aren’t the
great bargains that they are in other cities. Obviously, the amount of
money you spend on food depends on whether you can be satisfied with
eating on the chain gang or the hotel’s spiritual equivalent. If you avoid
the celeb joints, food generally sets you back around $30 to $50 per
person, per day. You can do it for less if you want to pinch pennies (fill up
at one buffet — even cram your pockets and purse with transportable
leftovers, though you didn’t hear that from us — and the rest of the day
can be handled with light snacking).
Las Vegas’s Best Restaurants
For help picking a place that suits your particular tastes, consult the
indexes at the end of this chapter. Restaurants are indexed by price, so
that you can budget yourself; by location, so that you can find a good
place to eat in the area that’s most convenient for you; and by cuisine,
so that you can satisfy your cravings.
But first are our picks for the most noteworthy restaurants in town. Each
restaurant is followed by its price range, the part of town where it’s situ-
ated, and the type of cuisine you find there. You may notice that the
picks are a bit heavy on the expensive food; that’s because there just
aren’t as many recommendable places at more reasonable prices. The
good news is that you can often enjoy a more affordable meal at expen-
sive restaurants, and we let you know if this is an option. (All you have
to do is eat there at lunch, when the menu is cheaper.) You should, how-
ever, let your hotel know that it needs to work on better budget options.
After all, if you don’t complain, who will?
The price categories used in this chapter are based on the average cost
of a dinner entree (à la carte). Table 10-1 gives you the rundown.
The dollar signs give you a general idea of how much a place costs.
Don’t rely solely on the price symbols, as some restaurants offer prix-fixe
(set-price) meals or other deals that will affect the price rankings.

To help you figure out what to expect for your money, here’s the low-
down on the restaurants in a given price category:
 $ (Dirt Cheap): These are the popular places that have been around
for a while. You can expect plain food in simple surroundings.
 $$ (Inexpensive): Some buffets and decent, if not stellar, restau-
rants fall into this category. They’re cheaper than you may expect,
because they’re located a little out of the way or the food empha-
sizes quantity over quality.
 $$$ (Medium): Think theme restaurants and smaller hotel joints.
These are good bets for a decent dinner that won’t blow your
budget out of the water. Expect a unique décor, good service, and
better-than-average food.
 $$$$ (Expensive): These are among the top Vegas restaurants: tops
for food, chefs, service, décor, and ambience. You usually get what
you pay for in this life, so be prepared to fork over a bundle.
 $$$$$ (Very Expensive): We’re talking foodie nirvana here. These
restaurants deserve respect. Here’s where the well-heeled come for
dinner. The food is above reproach, and the décor may include
priceless artworks. One thing’s for certain: People come here
because the restaurant is well known, usually for its chef, atmos-
phere, or high-rolling clientele.

views of all of Vegas. (Note: The right hand side of the restaurant now looks
at the newish Palms tower, so it’s probably the least desirable spot to sit.)
We’ve had any number of courses at this restaurant, and not been disap-
pointed by a one, though we do tend to prefer meat courses over fish. The
menu changes often, but you could be trying a marinated jumbo lump
crabmeat and avocado salad with heirloom tomato consommé, or a fabu-
lous New York steak with summer truffle jus and potato herb pancakes, or
meltingly tender lamb chops with shredded lamb shank wrapped in a
crispy fried crepe. Desserts are often quite silly (either in theme or con-
struction), which is appropriate given how much we giggle with delight
through meals here.

FRENCH
A downtown staple for many years, Andre’s was once the place to go for
gourmet dining. Now, with all the big boys hogging the gourmet limelight
on the Strip, it runs the risk of being overlooked. It shouldn’t. In addition
to receiving pampering, but not snooty, service, you may well be rubbing
shoulders in with such celebs as Steven Spielberg or Tom Hanks (at least,
they were here one night for a bachelor party). Presentation of the French
cuisine in this pretty, converted house is exquisite, with a taste to match.
Let the waiters guide you through the menu, and enjoy. There’s an excel-
lent wine list. And there is a branch in the Monte Carlo every bit as good
as the original. Try a local chef for a change, why don’t you?

NOUVELLE AMERICAN
Many recognize this restaurant because of its namesake establishment in
New York City, home to famed chef Charlie Palmer. Or they think of it only
because of its signature, four-story wine tower, where cat-suited lovelies
are hauled up by wires to fetch bottles from the uppermost heights. Lost
in this is some of the best, most interesting cooking in Vegas. They do
beautiful things with the prix-fixe three-course menu (though they do tend
to coddle favored guests by sending out curious little extra courses), that
may include tender roasted lamb, or a rack of venison accompanied by
sweet potato puree and chestnut crisp. But don’t forget the wine tower,
made even more playful with the help of a handheld computer wine list,
which will even make suggestions for pairings based on what you ordered
that evening.

STEAKHOUSE
You find lots and lots of places to eat steak in Vegas, that’s for sure. While
we’re busy recommending some really pricey places, we ought to recom-
mend one that is a bit less so. Not that it’s cheap, but as we say over and
over, split an entree. Your heart and stomach (room for dessert!) will thank
you. This Texas Station restaurant is a favorite among locals, who swear
by the 24-ounce rib-eye, rubbed with peppercorns and pan-seared in garlic,
butter, and cilantro. Mmmm. Garlic. Hey, and speaking of butter; there’s
the shrimp sautéed in garlic butter then dipped in cheese and wrapped in
bacon. So wrong, it has to be right. Just like Vegas.

Bartolotta
$$$$$
North Strip
ITALIAN/SEAFOOD
Steve Wynn went to a lot of trouble to make his hotel the swell-est ever, and
while debates rage about the success of some of his efforts, none are
directed towards the restaurants. Wynn not only wanted top name chefs,
he wanted those chefs to be physically in their kitchens. This is the dirty
little secret about all those celebrity chef outposts in town; many, if not most
chefs, not only don’t do their own cooking but are physically elsewhere. Not
only is James Beard Foundation Award winning Paul Bartolotta in his
kitchen, so is his fish — that is, the fish he insists must be flown fresh from
the Mediterranean every day. Everything is deceptively simple (easy little
sauces over charbroiled fish, for example), but it all depends on the right
ingredients — the best olive oil, the ripest tomatoes, the most perfect pasta,
and the best fish. The result got itself nominated for Best New Restaurant for
the 2006 Beard awards and is one of our favorite places to eat in Vegas.

You may think that you love Mexican food, but unless you’ve been to

real home cooking of Mexico, and it bursts with flavor (all of the chicken

reasonable lunch prices stay in play even at dinner.

BISTRO
Given that there are those (and we don’t argue with them) who think
Thomas Keller is the best chef in America, we were mighty happy when
he opened up a Vegas outlet. We were less so when we heard it was going
to be a branch of his Napa Valley bistro, Bouchon, because that latter has
never impressed us as we had hoped (unlike Keller’s French Laundry,
which is everything and more). So we were back to mighty happy when
we ate our way through the Vegas Bouchon menu and had not a single mis-
step. Don’t be deceived by the simplicity of what’s on offer; even humble
“peasant” food is lifted into glory when thoughtfully prepared with fine
ingredients. The sweet oysters, the impossibly rich, days-in-the-preparing
pate (which could probably serve four); the bacon and poached egg frisee
salad; the garlic-intensive lamb; the perfect beef bourguignon — oh, so
good, we’re growing a bit faint writing about it.

Sheesh, Vegas and its need for gimmicks. You can’t just have a burger

Add foie gras, and watch your budget meal suddenly cost $60 a person.

It’s true that Germany is no France when it comes to food, but the hearty

get food to go from the deli. Come for the very reasonably priced lunch,
and plan on sharing the huge portions . . . or live to regret it. Try some
schnitzel or liebchen; or learn the difference between bratwurst and
knockwurst, courtesy of their sausage sampler. Wash it all down with
imported beer.

SANDWICHES/AMERICAN
Actually, this place is barely a block off the north part of the Strip, so it’s an
easy swing — one you owe to yourself to make. Some of the best sandwiches
we’ve ever had came from Capriotti’s. Possibly it’s because they roast their
own beef and turkey on the premises, and certainly because they then stuff
those contents (or Italian cold cuts, meatballs, sausages, and even some
entirely veggie options) into monster-sized submarine sandwiches. Even the
“small” is too big; two people can share it, which makes this place easier on
the wallet. The most popular is the Bobby; with turkey, stuffing, and cran-
berry sauce combined on a French roll, it’s a complete Thanksgiving dinner
in handy packaging, any time of year. We prefer the Slaw B. Joe: roast beef,
provolone, cole slaw, and Russian dressing. Grab a couple sandwiches if you
want to pack a lunch for a day’s sightseeing out of the city, or do like us and
pick up a few for your plane flight/car ride out of town.

cheaper than others. Some are better than others. This one isn’t cheap,
but it does head the list of “better than.” But don’t fret too much about the
price. The portions (22 oz. to 44 oz. each, no kidding) are so large, you not
only can share, you really, really should. We prefer the tender rib-eye to
the more authoritatively flavored Kansas City. If you also share some (gen-
erously portioned) sides like truffled potato puree and citrus-braised
asparagus, you will still have room for a stylish dessert.

This is the less-expensive side project of Le Cirque, with the focus on

Think lighter, olive oil-based sauces rather than hearty tomato-based

salads and the pasta with rock shrimp) made by people who know what
they are doing. And, as a bonus, the restaurant overlooks the Bellagio

probably skip the hot entrees in favor of Asian or Mexican choices. Sunday

You think all we care about is truffles and foie gras and chi-chi food and
servile wait staff. Good heavens, no. We like that stuff a lot, don’t get us
wrong. But we also like a good, rowdy spot with hearty food that needs
lots of napkins. Maybe the gimmick at this place — where the waiters are
good-natured surly and abusive — is a bit much. But so are the portions,
and we mean that in a good way. Buckets (literally!) of fried goodies, such
as ribs or honey-glazed chicken, overly generous portions of chicken-fried
steak, and one heck of a massive burger — it’s definitely the food you get
while watching the Big Game or when you want to fill up one of those bot-
tomless pit teenagers (though the atmosphere is a little bit closer to R than
PG-13). And what’s wrong with that? Nothing, we say.

At some point, you may wonder why we don’t seem to recommend many
hotel restaurants, or at least affordable ones. It’s because, by and large, low-
and mid-priced hotel options are interchangeable, none of them all that
great or all that bad. Here, however, is an exception. It’s one of the better
Chinese restaurants in town, featuring not just the tried-and-true items that
appeal to tourists, but slightly more adventurous choices that would please
an Asian clientele. The freshly prepared food is served family style. Be
brave, and let your waiter do the choosing; tell your waiter if you are timid
or ready to try something new. (We like the crispy Peking pork, by the way.)

more than just sandwiches — including wraps (a sandwich by any other
name), salads, and smoothies — but with options like three cheese grilled
cheese with bacon, and roast beef with horseradish cream and cheddar
cheese, it may be hard to get to that part of the menu. The sandwiches aren’t
the monsters you find at Capriotti’s, but at these prices, you can always get

MEXICAN
We want you to go here simply because it’s the kind of mom-and-pop joint
that is fast disappearing in Vegas. What’s more, it’s been around since 1950,
which, for Vegas, makes it practically prehistoric. You want to go here if
you like real Mexican food (well, what Americans perceive as real Mexican
food). It’s not in the nicest part of town, but you find the inside to be quite
a bit friendlier than its neighborhood. Portions (such as the large enchi-

Emeril’s New Orleans Fish House
$$$$$
South Strip
AMERICAN/SEAFOOD/CAJUN
New Orleans-based celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse may be spreading him-
self a bit thin, between all his restaurants and all his shows on the Food
Network. At least, it seemed that way to us after we ate here not many days
after eating at his original (and still terrific) New Orleans restaurant, an
experience that only highlighted the somewhat more pallid meal here.
Again, this may be the fish-house-in-Vegas syndrome. How else to explain
why the spiced rib-eye here was better than the foie gras–topped ahi tuna?
You may be best off trying some appetizers, because you haven’t lived
until you’ve tried Lagasse’s savory lobster cheesecake, or the BBQ shrimp,
drenched in a garlicky Worcestershire-butter sauce and served with a rose-
mary biscuit. The banana cream pie is the star of a sinful dessert menu.

Fellini’s
$$
North Strip
ITALIAN
Okay, so we love Bartolotta’s authentic — and expensive — Italian food.
Love it. But seriously? Italian red sauce is the comfort food of our child-
hood. And when it’s done well, there is nothing we love more. Fellini’s has
it all — the garlicky cheesy bread, the Amatriciana with generous helpings
of pancetta, basic pizza, even tenderloin tips in a Gorgonzola and shallot
cream sauce. Pretty much everyone in your party will find something they
secretly love here, unless they are deeply picky eaters or even deeper
snobs. A Vegas institution, it’s just the antidote to all the pricier event
dining going on elsewhere on the Strip.

Fleur de Lys
$$$$$
South Strip
FRENCH
Of the many sophisticated restaurants to choose from in Vegas these days,
we single this one out for its combination of mature sexy food and atmos-
phere. The chef made his name at his highly regarded San Francisco estab-
lishment, and his reputation continues unsullied here. The two-story room,
half hidden by billowing drapes, reminds you to dress up to dine while
playing footsie with your dining companion. The three to five course tast-
ing menus don’t come cheap (though they are practically bargains com-
pared to similar high-end restaurants in town), but they are so playful and
clever that it feels like a treat, not a mugging. Options are seasonal, but
always beautifully composed; plus there is a thoughtful vegetarian menu
available. So ooh la la.

BUFFET
Bummed that the glory days of Vegas buffets — and by that we don’t mean
quality of food-wise, we mean ratio of quantity-to-cost-wise — seem to be
behind it? Us, too. That’s why we are sending you off the Strip and over
here. Cheaper than anything on the Strip, but not that far away, they have
as much of a range as any buffet ought, they keep the warm food warm,
and also, they have an all you-can-eat-steak night. Ah, nostalgia.

BUFFET
This is the fanciest of the downtown buffets by far, and one of the only two
downtown where we can guarantee quality. The salad bar is loaded with
extra goodies, former owner Steve Wynn’s mom’s bread pudding is still
featured among the desserts, there’s fresh seafood every night, and the
Sunday brunches are what that meal should be — even more decadent
and indulgent. It’s all set in a very plush space.

Hard Rock Cafe
$$
Paradise Road
AMERICAN
The music is the message at this theme restaurant, a shrine to all things
rock ’n’ roll. Here you can check out all sorts of memorabilia featuring
rock’s greatest legends — Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, and Kurt Cobain, to name a
few — including guitars, gold records, and costumes galore. It’s not much
different from any of the other Hard Rocks around the world; so if you’ve
seen one, this one won’t come as much of a surprise. Expensive but
respectable burgers rule here, but a few tasty salads lighten the fare. Kids
can’t get enough of this place.

AMERICAN
Another theme restaurant enterprise, this one is dedicated to all things
Harley. It features motorcycle memorabilia, gift items, and an all-American
menu with everything from burgers, sandwiches, and hot dogs to barbe-
cue and pasta. It does have a few unique items, and the desserts are all-out
decadent (chocolate-chip Toll House-cookie pie). The prices are on the
high side for what you get, and the music’s blaring; but that’s no different
from what you find at any of the other theme restaurants in town.

Ice House Lounge
$$
Downtown
DINER/CAFE
One of two good budget/family options in Downtown (the other is Jillian’s),
the Ice House is in a so-far undeveloped, but apparently, soon to be up and
coming part of Vegas. Don’t let that throw you. The facility booms at night
(it’s a popular club and bar) while they serve food until the wee hours:
large multi-deck sandwiches, huge pizzas, and the like. None of it is exotic,
which is why it’s good for kids; and the adults will be pleased by both the
prices and that they copied Red Square’s iced bar.

Isla

MEXICAN
Isla is a good choice for a party, given how the “modern Mexican cuisine”
menu — not to mention largest collection of tequila in Vegas — lends itself
to sharing and silliness. Consider guacamole made on demand (including

variations made with lobster and passion fruit) and sharable starters like
empanadas with dried cherries and a chipotle tomato sauce, not to men-
tion a roast pork with a pumpkin-seed sauce, along with typical tacos and
burritos there for those who would rather stick with the familiar. Caramel
cupcakes come with a chocolate cactus stick into them, a kind of playful-
ness we are total suckers for. Somewhat late nights make this a good place
for a drop in during a night of fun.

wings, spinach and artichoke dip), plus oozing juicy multi-component
burgers, steak and seafood combos, and even jambalaya and crawfish. Go
figure. Portions are enormous; this is a good family or thin wallet choice,
because sharing is almost mandatory.

Paradise Road
STEAKHOUSE
Sure, you can get prime rib anywhere in town for under $6. But it’s not
going to taste like this. Lawry’s didn’t invent prime rib, but they may as
well have. Dare we say that no one does it better? Sure we do. The elabo-
rate meal presentation includes 50 years’ worth of traditional touches,
such as the spinning salad bowl (a production you have to see to appre-
ciate) and the metal carving carts piled high with meat for you to select
from. You can find other things on the menu these days (fresh fish, for
example), but why bother? Come here for a seriously satisfying carnivo-
rous experience.

People who care about such things know that chef Robuchon has won all
sorts of fancy culinary awards, from coveted Michelin stars for his earlier
establishments in Europe to the James Beard award for Best New
Restaurant 2007 for this very spot. They get all giddy over that sort of
thing. So do food critics, who have given his other restaurant, Joel
Robuchon at the Mansion, their highest accolades. We were hard pressed
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
146

to choose between the two, but decided that the counter seating set up
here, where you can interact with waitstaff and chefs alike, makes for a
more fun foodie experience. Also, as expensive as this is, it’s not heart-
stoppingly gasping expensive like the Mansion. Portions come in both
small plate tasting and main course sizes, and the menu changes season-
ally. Look for playful — yes, fun — dishes such as La Pied de Cochon (pâté
made of pig feet topped with shaved truffle and parmesan on toast) or
quail with foie gras stuffed under the skin, with curious desserts such as
sheep’s milk yogurt panna cotta with Bergamot tea infusion. Under the cir-
cumstances, the tasting menu is the way to go, even if it doesn’t allow you
the freedom of random grazing.

Nouvelle French
Le Cirque originated in New York and was practically legendary there. This
branch varies between user-friendly and just a touch frightening. We’ve
had both excellent meals and ones that made us wonder what all the fuss
was about. The menu changes regularly but some things we loved: any-
thing with truffles (especially the sweet and tender lobster salad topped
with truffle dressing), foie gras pâté also topped with the truffle dressing,
and the roasted honey-glazed duck with figs. Desserts are all playful, pretty
creations that are almost too good-looking to eat. Almost.

Off the Beaten Path
THAI
Yeah, it’s out in the middle of nowhere in one god-awful ugly strip mall, but
this nothing of a place has been called no less than the best Thai restau-
rant in North America. That claim now exhausts us — how can we prove it?
At least you know it’s not going to stink, no matter what. They make all your
usual Thai favorites very well, but be sure to ask for the special north
Thailand menu, because that’s where they shine and where their reputa-
tion comes from. Skip the lunch buffet, even though it’s a bargain price, and
try some sour pork Issan sausage, or the same ground up with lime, green
onion, fresh chile and ginger served with crispy rice (nam kao tod). We love
sua rong hai (“weeping tiger”) — soft marinated, grilled beef. Have some
sticky rice, just like it is off a cart in Bangkok, for dessert. And then con-
gratulate yourself for eating perhaps the most authentic food in all of Vegas.

Celebrity chef Bobby Flay is well-known from his shows on the Food

opportunity to find out. (Remember that Bobby is busy with restaurants
in New York and the aforementioned TV career, so while he created the
menu, you won’t likely find him in the kitchen here.) Like so many

SEAFOOD
We are always somewhat dubious about seafood restaurants in the 
desert — yes, we know about jet planes and refrigeration and other
modern conveniences — and although our initial experience here (a
branch of a terrific place in San Francisco) soothed our concerns, more
recent visits have made us skeptical again. It’s not the fish itself, but all
the preparations seemed just a bit blah. Miso-glazed sea bass, a noted
dish, came out like really fancy sukiyaki (a traditional one-pot soup), and
the signature lobster pot pie was too soupy and overpriced. Service can
be kind but absent-minded. Get silly with the homemade root beer float,
complete with chocolate straws and homemade cookies.

Ooh, la-la! This cute-as-a-button place is one of our favorite dining spots in

can run up a hefty tab here, note that just eating that same hearty soup or
those clever sandwiches will keep the prices down while filling you up most
satisfactorily. And although it’s absolutely a Vegas version of a bistro, even
cynics have to admit that they got the décor just right. Seat your amour on
the patio right on the Strip and gaze into each other’s eyes, but don’t get so
swept up in each other that you forget to order desserts; they are huge here.

microbrewery pub, with 40-plus TVs and a sound system blaring rock
music. It’s not overly stimulating; it’s just lively and friendly. Food is hearty
and familiar — ribs, burgers, pizzas, salads — nothing frilly. Earning raves
are the barbecued short ribs, the chicken fingers, the garlic pizza, the avo-
cado and shrimp salads, and the chocolate suicide brownie dessert. Only
pizza and appetizers are served after 9 p.m.

amusing “archaeological dig,” it has all the buffet standards (salads, fresh
fruit, a carving station with turkey and ham), plus some interesting twists,
such as Mexican, Chinese stir-fry, and Italian pastas. You may feel like lying
down in King Tut’s tomb after negotiating the long lines at peak dining
times; try to come during off-hours after the rush has died down.

Olives
$$$$
Center Strip
ITALIAN/MEDITERRANEAN
Todd English, the man behind this restaurant, is considered to be a major
American chef; so you know you are in for something good. Although the
prices here can be budget busting, you can actually eat here for moderate
cost. First of all, come when the cheaper lunch menu is in play (11 a.m.–
3 p.m.), and stick to pastas and the flatbread pizzas. The latter are a
cracker-thin-crust creation topped with such unusual items as Moroccan
lamb and feta cheese, and prosciutto and figs. They are really quite good
(we wish this place was in our neighborhood so that we could eat these
regularly). One pizza can feed two people, though you may want to add a
fresh, pretty salad, a large sandwich (note the pressed Cuban), or a bowl
of pasta, such as the spaggetini with roasted garlic and tomatoes (won-
derful, with just the right amount of richness).

ITALIAN
This is the expensive version — seems like there always has to be one of
those, doesn’t it? — of Olives, the restaurant listed earlier. It’s a pretty, casual
but chic place that has quite a good vibe for an expensive restaurant; it’s a
nice place to be during the later dining hours. Vegetables are flown in espe-
cially for Onda, so this is a good place to get your daily nutritionally required
servings all at once. Try the antipasti loaded with roasted veggies, the sweet
baby spring pea soup, or the veggie foil packet full of mushrooms. Continue
to feel virtuous with a light dessert, such as a sorbet sampler.

BUFFET
You may wonder why we would suggest coming to such a comparatively
expensive buffet when there are much cheaper options. Mainly it’s
because the more expensive restaurants that we are so cheerfully telling
you to eat at are still more costly than the most expensive buffets; and do
they give you the same amount of food? No, they do not. Not only is this
one rather pretty, but the food stations represent the different regions of
France, offering choices indigenous to the region (Alsace, Provence,
Burgundy) in question. You enjoy a more imaginative (to say nothing of
larger) meal than those found at the usual buffet suspects.

Paymon’s Mediterranean Café & Market

Paradise Road
GREEK/MIDDLE EASTERN
This authentic, family-owned Middle Eastern restaurant offers solid food
with no glitz and neon in sight. In fact, the semi-outdoors courtyard area
is one of the few nonhotel dining choices that succeeds at a non-mini-mall
identity. The gyros (lamb and beef in a pita) are probably your best choice.
The menu also features other favorites, such as phyllo pie served with a
side of hummus, and chicken and vegetable kabobs. Eat here and then get
some at the adjoining market to take home. There’s also a “hookah lounge”
attached to the restaurant where you have a few drinks, get a bite to eat,
and, yes, smoke a hookah pipe.

Picasso

NOUVELLE FRENCH
Former Bellagio owner Steve Wynn spent nearly a year wooing superstar
chef Julian Serrano — a man who works a kitchen the way Springsteen
works a concert — away from his highly praised San Francisco restaurant.
Wynn succeeded, and it’s your gain. Yep, the prices are what you may
expect from a place with more than $30 million worth of genuine Picassos
hanging on the wall, but Serrano’s cooking produces really good food the
way Picasso’s painting produced really good art. The menu changes
nightly (though lately it seems to rotate among a number of regular
dishes), giving you a choice of two multi-course tasting menus (portions
are small so that you can finish everything without feeling as if you are
going to explode). We fell hard for the corn flan (like eating solid sunshine)
with chunks of lobster, and the perfectly tender lamb crusted with black
truffles. For dessert, we got silly over the molten chocolate soufflé cake
with homemade chocolate ice cream — then dreamt about it all night long.

The folk art-bedecked interior and the deliberately ever-so-slightly-

you’d expect from any eatery in the Hard Rock Hotel, the epicenter of
Vegas hip. But the prices are low and the portions are large. It’s what you
want when you want Mexican food, and it’s even a bit better than that, so
all of that makes us put up with the rest of it.

BISTRO
Here’s a perfect choice if you want a really nice meal but don’t want food
that is too, how shall we say, frou-frou. Here’s a secret about French food:
An actual French person’s favorite thing to eat is a small steak, a handful
of french fries, and some wine. Voilá. Sound scary? Of course not. And so
while this charming bistro (we love the clubby, intimate interior here)
serves “French” fare, it’s going to be things that you can easily recognize
and immediately love. Favorites include the roast chicken accompanied
by a heap of garlic fries, a lovely onion soup, even more lovely and crunchy
salads (sometimes with toasted slices of bread topped with things like
herbed goat cheese), and a sublime homemade chocolate ice cream.
Simple. Delicious. Perfect. They also offer some more complicated — but
not outrageously so — items, if you feel inclined. Consider also coming at
lunch, when prices fall into the moderate category.

CALIFORNIA
We may have spent too much time on the Jungle Cruise ride at Disneyland
during our impressionable youth, and that’s probably why we rather enjoy
this place (our feelings toward theme restaurants notwithstanding). The
fake foliage, animatronic animals, and real fish give everyone, especially
kids, plenty to look at while dining on some needlessly busy but better
than average (for a theme restaurant) food. In theory, your child (or you)
can also learn about environmental issues, which to our way of thinking is
a better use of everyone’s time than gawking at used football jerseys.

No one parties like the Red Party, and this restaurant sets out to prove it.
No, no, no — no Communist propaganda here; quite the opposite, as sym-
bols and artifacts from the days of the Iron Curtain are defaced or other-
wise turned into capitalist décor. Heck, when folks protested the giant
statue of Lenin (like the one found in the real Red Square), the restaurant
promptly decapitated it and covered it with fake pigeon poop. Enjoy the
toppings of sacred cows as you dine on real cow — the Chef’s Special is a
terrific filet mignon topped with Roquefort — or caviar (pricey ounces
allow you to taste several varieties), or other Russia-meets-the-rest-of-the-
world fare. Be sure to have a drink at the bar, which is partially constructed
out of a block of ice, the better to keep that vodka glass nicely chilled.

AMERICAN/SOUTHERN
Now we like those fancy Strip restaurants such as Picasso and Fleur de

Vegas?” we may just have to answer “Rosemary’s.” Then we’d go on to
explain that it’s about a 20-minute drive from the Strip — one reason why
we tell people to rent cars when they come here — and the chef-owners
used to cook in New Orleans (they opened Emeril’s Seafood here, and in
Part III: Settling into Las Vegas 
154

fact, this is the most reliable place in town to eat fish). And now they’ve got
their own place where they create twists on classic Southern fare (Try that
bleu cheese slaw! Or the jalapeño hush puppies!). We’d go on to explain
that we have tried both the humble (crispy bass) and the fancy (foie gras
with peach coulis or a pan-seared honey-glazed salmon), and both were
wonderful, and in addition to wine-pairing suggestions, they offer you pair-
ings for beer (which we’ve never seen before). But enough explaining,
already: We’re losing valuable time that is better spent eating here.

Downtown really isn’t keeping up with the big changes on the Strip, either
in terms of lodging or culinary options. Sure, you still have the classic
Vegas cheap meal deals here, but for swankier occasions, options are still
either old-fashioned chop houses (nothing wrong with that, by the way) or
well-intentioned muddles like this place. Which is still likeable, and cer-
tainly more affordable than comparable places uptown. Stick to the grill
dishes and have some fun with Hunan pork and beef lettuce wrap appe-
tizers. Steamed fish in a bamboo pot is reliable (and lower fat!) as well,
while portions remain generous, a relief in these days of wee servings.

prosciutto, not to mention the burgers? Still, it’s much healthier than those
other places, if that’s important to you — especially when you try the

miso-glazed sea bass and sashimi, all cleverly displaced in a traditional
Japanese lunch box. Probably too costly to consider for dinner, but worth

fabulous as it should be. You are better off at Rosemary’s, Alize, or
Bouchon; but if you want to try a legend, try the cafe. The salads, sand-
wiches and pastas, are all competently if not strikingly prepared and cost
less than dinner. Plus, as a European-style sidewalk cafe out it has a more
relaxed atmosphere than the dining room.

There does seem to be an awful lot of Emeril in town, and you have to

Possibly the most successful of his local establishments, it’s also a relative
bargain compared to other high-end dining in town. (It’s even more afford-
able at lunch.) Figure on the menu changing regularly; also figure on dishes
that pay attention both to Emeril’s contemporary Creole cooking, like
oyster fritters with a Rockefeller dipping sauce and pasta jambalaya, as well
as hearty fun such as lamb sliders made roasted leg of lamb. Top it all off

On the Lighter Side: Munchies 
and Meals to Go
If you’re not in the mood for a major meal or are just looking for some-
thing to nibble on before you head off to a show, you have a number of
options to choose from. A lot of the big hotels have food courts that are
similar to what you find in your local mall, although prices are slightly
higher than what you’re used to paying for similar fare at home. And
there are also some alternatives to the brand-name generic sameness
these places mostly offer.
Food courts
The best of the hotel food courts is Cypress Street Marketplace, in
Caesars Palace (3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-731-7110), with a selec-
tion of various venders (pulled pork sandwiches at the BBQ stand, pot
stickers and bowls of noodles at the Asian stand, wrap sandwiches, very
fine pizza slices, large salads, even hamburgers; there’s enough here to
please every palate in even the most diet-divided family). Prices are low,
but the choices and quality are such that you may get a bit carried away.
Hours may vary at each place, but, collectively, the food court is open
Chapter 10: Dining — Las Vegas Style 157

from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday to Thursday, and from 7 a.m. to midnight
on Fridays and Saturdays. It’s opposite the entrance to the Forum Shops
at the northern end of the casino.
On the South Strip, the Monte Carlo Resort & Casino (3770 Las Vegas
Blvd. S.; % 702-730-7777) has a food court featuring Haagen-Dazs,
McDonald’s, Nathan’s Hot Dogs, Sbarro, and the Golden Bagel (a first-
class bagel bakery). It’s open (varying from stand to stand) from 6 a.m.
to 3 a.m. Look for it between the lobby (which is at the back of the
hotel’s first floor) and casino (at the front).
New York-New York (3790 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-740-6969) has the
nicest food court, thanks to its Greenwich Village-style setting. There,
and up near Coney Island, are New York–theme eateries — Schrafft’s Ice
Cream (yippee!), a good pizza place, and another good hamburger joint,
plus Jodi Maroni’s Sausage Kingdom (reviewed later in the Doggonit
sidebar) to name a few.
If you’re casino-hopping at the northern end of the Strip, your best bet is
to check out the Mardi Gras Food Court at the Riviera (2901 Las Vegas
Blvd. S.; % 702-734-5110). It’s adjacent to the main casino entrance. You
find an A&W/KFC Express, Pizza Hut Express, Quizno’s Subs, and
other stands that sell everything from Mexican to Chinese food. Hours at
each outlet vary but generally fall between 8 a.m. and 2 a.m.
For the sweet tooth
Let’s see; home to the world’s largest chocolate fountain and a World
Pastry Champion. Oh, you need more reason to come to Jean-Philippe
Patisserie (in Bellagio, 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S., % 702-369-5000)? How
about perfect gourmet chocolates, brioche stuffed with dolce de leche,
pastries that are works of art, and thick ice cream? Decadence run amok.

DIY burgers
Belly up to the Burger Bar, where it won’t be as cheap as going to, well, just about
anywhere else for a burger, especially if you get the Kobe beef burger topped with
foie gras. Huh? The Burger Bar lets you build your burger any way you want, even if
you are some crazy nut who wants lobster on your burger. All kinds of options, from
the traditional (all sorts of cheese, onion, lettuce, tomato) to the not-so (prosciutto,
scallions, anchovies) are offered, which means the total can add up quickly if you
aren’t careful. Still, they start with mighty fine beef (skip that $50 Kobe option; it’s too
soft to make a good burger anyway), and it is a fun project, putting together one’s
Dream Burger. Speaking of which, for dessert, they have a Sweet Burger, made out of
chocolate pâté and a bunlike donut. Don’t miss it. 3930 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the
Mandalay Place shopping center), % 702-632-9364.

Harrah’s (3475 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-369-5000) has a Ghirardelli
Chocolate Shop and Soda Fountain in the outdoor Carnival Court. You
can’t watch the chocolate being mixed in vats (darn!) like at their flag-
ship store in San Francisco, but this is where we like to spend time on a
hot Vegas day.
You can find some heavenly baked goods served up by Freed’s Bakery
(4780 S. Eastern Ave.; % 702-456-7762; www.freedsbakery.com), where
it smells just like grandma’s kitchen.
Chocolate Swan (Mandalay Place Shopping center, 3930 Las Vegas Blvd.
S., Suite 201B, % 702-632-9366; www.chocolateswan.com) is the place
to satisfy a high-class chocolate craving. We say that because prices here
are higher than we may like, but that undoubtedly reflects the nearly
impossibly high standards of the owners, who use the finest quality
ingredients and have been known to throw out entire batches of their
candy and cakes because the desired level of perfection wasn’t reached.
Incredible goodies; do treat yourself. Open Sunday through Thursday
from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to midnight.
Yet another reason to stay at the Green Valley Resort — you are close to
The Cupcakery (9680 S. Eastern, in Henderson, % 702-207-2253)! Little
morsels of cake and frosting wonder, sometimes filled with even more
sweetness, like the Boston cream pie packed with custard cream. 
When the heat is on in Vegas, we think ice cream — or variations on that
theme — is as much a necessity as water. We head right to Luv-It Frozen
Custard, 505 E. Oakey, at the Strip (% 702-384-6452), open Monday to
Thursday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.,
Saturday from noon to 11 p.m., and Sunday from 1 to 10 p.m. It varies
slightly in taste — and caloric content, yay! — from regular ice cream,
and the batches here are made fresh every few hours.
Man cannot live by cake alone (we’ve tried), so vary your diet with
bagels from either Einstein Bros. Bagels (4624 S. Maryland Pkwy.; 
% 702-795-7800; www.einsteinbros.com.) or Bagelmania (855 Twain
Ave.; % 702-369-3322), both of which provide good alternatives to
expensive hotel breakfasts.

Jody Maroni’s Sausage Kingdom is the star of the funny little New York-New York food
court. This one-time (and still) Venice Beach sausage stand has grown from its humble
roots to a food empire, and deservedly so: In addition to some perfect examples of the
humble hot dog, they offer adventurous and interesting sausages like tequila chicken
with jalapeños, corn, and lime. Stuff one into a sesame seed bun, top it with peppers

Part IV
Exploring Las Vegas

In this part . . .
Yes, it’s true: You can do more in Las Vegas than drop
coins into a slot machine. Ultimately, this city is one big
amusement park, with a healthy dose of resort pampering
thrown in for good measure. Where else can you ride a roller
coaster, play a few hands of blackjack, watch a live pirate
battle, go bowling, take a simulator ride through ancient
Egypt, play with a dolphin, practice your golf swing, get a
massage, and get hitched? In this part, we give you tips on
how to gamble, see the top attractions, shop ’til you drop,
and get in as much fun as is humanly possible.

H
ey — did you know that they have gambling in Vegas?
Well of course you did. If you knew only one thing about Vegas before
you picked up this book, we’d bet dollars to donuts it was that. See how
quickly the gambling begins? In fact, what you may not realize, and may
not fully comprehend until you actually get there, is how much gambling
there is in Vegas. It starts at the airport, follows you to the gas station,
and then hits hyperdrive when you finally get to your hotel.
Clearly, it’s time to get serious.
Ante Up: Gambling Basics
If you want to try the gambling scene, but you’ve never done it before
and don’t know all the rules, don’t worry. We can get you started. It’s not
as fun to gamble if you aren’t savvy enough to know when to “double
down,” and the last thing you want to do in Vegas is lose your shirt. So,
in this section we give you the basics. (Although we can’t guarantee a
win — you have to rely on Lady Luck for that one!)
Entire books have been written about the nuances of casino gambling,
so if you’re looking for an in-depth analysis, we suggest that you go 
grab an additional reference. Casino Gambling For Dummies, by Kevin
Blackwood and Max Rubin (Wiley Publishing) seems like a good place to
start — symmetry, you know.

Before you even walk into a casino, you need to keep some basic rules in
mind:
 Age: You have to be at least 21 years old to even enter a casino area,
much less play the games. If you bring your kids to Vegas and plan
on spending significant time inside the casino, check into finding a
baby sitter or childcare center at your hotel (see the Appendix for
baby-sitting resources). If you happen to look younger than 21, be
sure to carry a valid driver’s license (or other piece of ID) with you.
Casino officials and cashiers can and do card patrons.
If you’re under 21 and somehow manage to make it to a table or
slot machine, don’t think that you’re home free: Just a few years
ago, a big slot winner had his jackpot taken away when the casino
found out he was only 17.
 Casino clubs: Most hotels offer free enrollment in their slot and
gaming clubs. After you fill out a form, you get a card (it looks kind
of like a credit card) that you insert into a special reader on slot
machines or turn in at gaming tables. Each time you place a bet or
pull the handle on a slot machine, you rack up points on your
account (just remember to take your card with you when you
leave!). You can later trade these points in for discounts on meals,
shopping, and accommodations. If you gamble enough, you may
even get a free room.
Getting a club card is one of the best deals in Vegas. Even if you
think that you aren’t going to gamble enough to make it worth-
while, sign up for as many of these as you can. After all, you never
know — vows to drop only small amounts of cash on the tables
often have the longevity of New Year’s resolutions, so you may as
well get something out of all this if you can. Signing up for the club
also puts you on the hotel’s mailing list, which can be a plus,
because hotels often offer special deals on room rates and pack-
ages to their club members. Check at the main cashier cage in any
casino to find out the details on their clubs.
 Booze galore: Almost all the casinos offer free drinks (alcoholic or
not) if you’re gambling. All you need to do is flag down one of the
many cocktail servers who roam the casino floor. (The servers
often pop up mere moments after you’ve seated yourself.) It may
be a while, however, before your drink arrives. Servers blame the
delay on the long trek they have to make to get from the kitchens to
the casino, but the suspicious among us suspect that they just
want you to keep pumping quarters into that slot machine while
you wait. And suddenly, that free beer costs you $20.
 Lighting up: Smokers, who must often take to the streets to light up
in other American cities, will be happy to know that the huff ’n’ puff
crowd rules in Las Vegas’s casinos. Some casinos even offer free
packs of cigarettes to gamblers. A few casinos have no-smoking
sections, but you still share the same air with the rest of the casino.
Nonsmokers should take solace in the Vegas legend that says that
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
168

casinos constantly pump in fresh oxygen to keep players from get-
ting tired.
 Cheaters really don’t prosper: Don’t even think about cheating. If
you don’t believe us, just look up at the ceiling when you walk into
any casino. Those innocuous little black domes or opaque glass
panels are actually cameras poised to watch your every move.
They are extremely high-tech and can cover every square inch of
the casino. And somebody is always watching. Floor staff and
undercover operators also roam the floors just trying to catch you
doing anything out of the ordinary. They’ve seen every trick in the
book, and many not in the books. They know more than you do,
and they will catch you. And while there may no longer be goons
named Guido ready to rearrange your face for your transgressions,
legal punishment is pretty humiliating. Save the cheating for your
Monday-night bridge club.
 Be prepared to lose: One thing you must understand before you
set out to play: Losers outnumber winners in any casino. They
don’t build these super-casinos on winners. After all, they have to
have some way to pay for those big chandeliers, and volcanoes,
and Elton John’s salary. And they do, and then some. Vegas casinos
rake in somewhere in the neighborhood of $8 to $9 billion annually.
Chew on that for a minute.
Don’t budget any more gambling money than you can afford to
lose. After you set aside your bankroll for the casinos, consider it
gone. If you leave the city with some jingle left in your pocket, con-
sider yourself very lucky.
 It’s just a game: You won’t find the key to successful gambling in
any strategy book or streak of good luck. It’s a state of mind.
Success means having fun without losing the farm. And so while it
must be very nice (not that we would know) to bet $10,000 and win
$30,000, remember that it must really hurt all the other times when
that $10,000 goes bye-bye. If you remember that this is just a game,
for your entertainment, you can have plenty of fun playing nickel
slots. Sure, you won’t get rich, but you won’t send your children to
the poorhouse, either. If you’re looking for an investment opportu-
nity, consider the stock market.
The Slot Machines: Bells and Sirens
Old-timers will tell you that slots were invented to give wives something
to do while their husbands gambled. Slots used to be stuck on the periph-
ery of the casinos and could be counted on one hand, maybe two. But
now they are the casino: The casinos make more from slots than from
craps, blackjack, and roulette combined. In fact, you can find more than
150,000 slot machines in Clark County.
A slot machine is actually a computer with a highly specialized program
that randomly decides how much and how often you will win on any
Chapter 11: Luck Be a Lady: Gambling Tips and Tricks 169

given play. Most of the time, the computer decides that you lose, but occa-
sionally it decides that you win, and then you hear the coins raining down
into the little bin below. The good news is that Las Vegas slot machines
are the loosest (the house keeps less money) in the country. The bad news
is that the house still holds a 3 to 25 percent advantage on the slot
machines (there’s a reason they’re nicknamed “one-armed bandits”).
How they work
You put the coins in the slot and pull the handle. What, you thought that
there was a trick to this? Well, maybe there is a bit more to tell. In order to
keep up with increasing competition, the plain old machine, where reels
just spin, has become nearly obsolete. Now, they are all computerized,
have fun graphics, and have added buttons to push so that you can avoid
developing carpal tunnel syndrome yanking the handle all night. (The han-
dles are still there on some of them so that you can feel more involved in
the play.) The idea is still simple: Get three (sometimes four) cherries
(Elvi, sevens, dinosaurs, whatever) in a row and you win something.
Increasingly popular are the video-based machines, which complicate
matters even further by offering multiple pay lines (that barely qualify as
a line they are so convoluted) and multiple ways to play.
Each machine has its own combination, so be sure to check the chart
(included on the front of every machine or in the help section on video
based slots) that tells you all the winning combinations. Some pay you
something with just one symbol showing; on most, the more combina-
tions there are, the more opportunities for loot. Some even pay a little if
you get three blanks.
Different slots for different pots
Slot machines (see Figure 11-1 for a sample slot machine) take paper
currency ($1–$100) inserted into a slot to get started and then pays you
out with a paper ticket that either can be inserted into other machines
or cashed in. Even though most don’t accept actual coins, they still refer
to them with their old monikers: Nickel machines are usually the lowest
limit (although penny slots are making a big comeback), followed by
dimes (fairly rare), quarters, half-dollars, dollars, and $5. The high-limit
machines, usually cordoned off in their own area, can cost you anywhere
from $10 to $500 or even more for a single pull of the handle. Each
machine shows you how much you have left to gamble on a credit meter.
After you decide how much you want to blow (er, bet), you have to
decide between progressive and so-called flat-top machines. Here’s the
lowdown on each of these machines:
 Flat-top machines have a fixed high-end limit of how much you can
win. For example, hit three gold bars and you win 1,000 coins — but
never any more or less.
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
170

Figure 11-1: A basic slot machine.
 Progressive machines offer unlimited high-end winnings as the jack-
pot grows, and the pot grows each time you put a coin in. If you play
on a progressive machine, those three gold bars can win you differ-
ent amounts, depending on how much money has accumulated in
the jackpot. Most progressive slots are located in carousels — groups
of machines that contribute to one central jackpot. The first person
to hit the big one wins the big jackpot. These carousels are easy to
find: Just look for the large electronic signs above them displaying

the jackpot amount. We recently saw noncarousel machines with
individual progressive jackpots. Play these, and you won’t have to
worry about the guy sitting next to you winning the big prize.
Most machines take 2 “credits” (the denomination of the machine —
penny, quarter, dollar and so on), 3 credits, or up to 45 credits at a time.
Many even have more than one set of reels (meaning that you can win
on more than one “line” horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Some
include bonus wheels that spin and award you extra dough. Don’t worry,
though, it’s not all that complicated: If you study a machine carefully for
just a few moments before you play it (or watch someone else who is
playing a similar machine), you get a good handle on all the rules and
your possible winnings.
What to do if you hit the jackpot
If you’re half asleep and mindlessly pumping credits into a machine,
don’t worry that you won’t recognize if you hit the big one. Bells and
sirens often blare, just in case you weren’t paying attention (and just in
case others in the casino need a little help deciding to play!). If this 
happens, but the credit meter doesn’t show your winnings, relax. Most
machines have payout limits; any jackpot that exceeds the limit is paid in
cash by an attendant (who will no doubt double-time it to your frantic
side).
Be aware that the casino automatically reports any jackpot of $1,200 or
more to the IRS. Yes, that big win is considered income and is taxable.
(You can also deduct losses, but only if you have winnings and you’ve
kept a record of your play.) So maybe instead of trying for that one big
jackpot, you should go after a bunch of smaller ones. And be sure to
check with your accountant if you’re unsure of how to report your win-
nings or losses.
Tips and tricks
There is no such thing as a slots expert (just someone who’s played
them a whole lot), but we still have a few hints for you to take with you
to the slot machines. These hints are not guaranteed to make you a
penny, but if you stick to them, you may do pretty well:
 Be prepared to walk away: If you sit down at a slot machine, and it
doesn’t pay out anything within the first ten or so pulls, move your
butt to the next one. Odds are that it isn’t going to get any better.
 For bigger pots, play bigger money: The lower the denomination
required to play a slot machine, the less likely you are to hit the
jackpot. In general, nickel machines pay off less frequently than
quarter machines, which pay off less frequently than dollars, and
so on. Quarter slots are the most frequently played machines (with
almost 75 percent of players using them).
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
172

 Play the max: This one is a tough call; if you play the maximum
number of credits, and you win, you win much more. Of course, if
you lose, you go through your money that much faster. Most
machines, progressive or not, offer higher payout odds on maxi-
mum bets. Bet .25, get three cherries, and you get .50 back, for
example. The payout is 2:1. However, put in .75, hit those same
three cherries, and you get $2.25 as a payoff. This makes the
payout 3:1. In addition, if you want to win the big jackpot, you must
put in the maximum number of credits. It’s a hook to make you
spend more money, but it’s a hook that’s hard to argue with. True
slot junkies always play the maximum.
On most slot machines, you find a button marked credit. If you push
this button, your winnings are credited and your spins debited
electronically. When you’re ready to leave, just press the “cash 
out” button on the machine. But don’t expect to hear that lovely
“chingchingchingchingCHANG” sound any more. Well, you will hear
it, but it will be recorded. Because there won’t be actual coins cas-
cading out when you press the button. As mentioned earlier, casi-
nos have switched all the gaming machines to credit slips only. All
pay outs are now done this way. It allegedly makes matters more
convenient and less costly for the casino. We hate it.
 Look for busy carousels: When you look for a machine to park
yourself in front of, take note of whether the machine is in a
carousel that is empty or teeming with players. There’s a method to
this madness — empty carousels likely have machines that aren’t
paying well. Take your time to find a carousel where lots of people
have lots of money listed on their credit readout. Again, we’re not
going to guarantee that you’ll do better here, but you may have
more luck.
 Investigate progressive payouts: If you’re thinking about playing 
at a bank of progressive slots, ask an attendant what the jackpot
starts at and when it usually hits. Most of the time, she will be
happy to give you this “insider” information. Here’s a good general
rule: If you discover that a progressive slot carousel jackpot starts
at $10,000, usually hits before it reaches $15,000, and is currently 
at $14,500, then sit down and start playing! If it’s only at $10,500
(meaning that somebody recently won), it probably won’t hit again
anytime soon.
 Ask the experts: Feel free to ask the floor attendants if they know
of a certain area that is doing well. It sure beats wandering around
from machine to machine looking for that special vibe. Technically,
the attendants aren’t supposed to tell you this, but many often 
do — especially those in the change areas above slot carousels.

Video Poker: Virtual-Reality Card Games
Pretty much as popular as slots, video poker works the same way as reg-
ular poker, except that you play on a machine. This is one of the few
games in Vegas where, if you play perfectly and on the right machine,
you can actually break even or, perhaps — gasp! — ahead of the house.
It would take a lot more space than we have in this book to expound on
perfect video poker strategy and the proper machines to play on —
although some books do just that — but we will give you the game’s
basics.
How they work
To play a round of video poker, put in your money, press the “DEAL”
button, and five virtual-reality cards pop up (out of a 52-card virtual
deck that the machines use for each deal). Select the cards you want to
keep with the “HOLD” buttons located under each card, and press
“DEAL” again to get replacement cards for the ones you didn’t hold. You
have only one chance to draw for a winning poker hand. The machine
doesn’t have a hand of its own, so you aren’t competing against it. You’re
just trying to get a hand that’s high enough to win something.
This is a bit more challenging and more active than slots because you
have some control (or at least illusion of control) over your fate, and 
it’s easier than playing actual poker with a table full of folks who proba-
bly take it very seriously. Even better, there are some video poker
machines — admittedly, they’re very hard to find — that actually offer
favorable odds if you play perfectly.
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
174
The ins and outs of slot etiquette
You won’t need to consult your Emily Post etiquette guide before tackling the slots in
Vegas, but you would be wise to keep a few unwritten rules in mind:
 Don’t assume that a slot machine isn’t in use because nobody is sitting at it. Slot
fanatics often play 2 or 3 machines at a time and can be extraordinarily territorial.
If people are playing machines adjacent to the one you’re thinking of using, ask
before you sit down.
 If the chair is tilted toward the machine so no one else can sit down, it’s a safe
bet that it is in use.
 Technically, if you’re alone, and you get up and walk away from a machine — even
if it’s to go to the bathroom — you’ve relinquished all rights to it, even if you tilt
the chair. In reality, unless the casino is mobbed, in which case all bets are off, eti-
quette holds that you don’t touch a machine that is being “held.” However, play-
ers can’t hold slot machines indefinitely. If the “owner” doesn’t show up after 10
to 15 minutes, sit down and start playing.

Pick your poison
When push comes to shove, your choice of video poker machine is
affected by three factors: denomination, payout schedules, and availabil-
ity. Unfortunately, you’re going to have to do some footwork if you want
a machine that meets your expectations for all three, because the poker
machines in Vegas are in a constant state of flux.
Just like slot machines, you can play video poker in many different
denominations, although quarter and dollar machines are the most
played (and most available). Progressive video poker is popping up
everywhere, but most are still flat, offering a fixed payout. You can also
find a huge range of add-ons that may include a wild card, a double-
down feature (where you double your money on a winning hand), or spe-
cial bonuses for certain hands.
If you’re a beginner, stick to the basic games that offer payouts starting
with jacks or better until you get used to the concept. Try to get a
machine that pays more than just a return of your money for two pairs.
If you can find it, the best machine to play on is called a 9/6 machine,
because, for a single credit bet, it pays out 9 credits for a full house and
6 coins for a flush. Most machines in Vegas are 8/5 machines, which pay
out less money. So before you play, check the pay schedule on a video
poker machine to determine what its payout percentage is.
A winning hand
Many video poker machines have a minimum of jacks or better to win.
This means that out of five cards, you must have at least two jacks of
any suit (the ace is always the highest card value, and the two is the
lowest) to win. Two matching cards that are higher than jacks is also a
winner. If you’ve never played poker, consult Figure 11-2 to find out more
about poker hands.
Just like slots, video poker machines have gone to a cashless, ticket-in/
ticket-out technology so don’t expect to hear the jingle-jangle of coins in
the metal tray if you hit it big.
 One pair: Out of your five cards, you have two that have the same
face value. Most video poker games require a pair of jacks as the
minimum before they pay.
 Two pair: Two pairs have matching card values — for example, two
5s and two 8s.
 Three of a kind: Three cards out of your five have matching values
(for example, three kings).
 Straight: All five of your cards are in sequential order. It doesn’t
matter what suit they are; they don’t have to match. The lowest
possible straight is 2-3-4-5-6, and the highest is 10-J-Q-K-A.

Figure 11-2: The hierarchy of video poker hands.
 Flush: Five cards of the same suit, regardless of value (for example,
five diamonds).
 Full house: A combination of one pair and three of a kind (two aces
and three 7s, for example).
 Four of a kind: Not hard to figure out, but also not easy to get. Four
of the five cards have the same face value (4-4-4-4-9, for example).
 Straight flush: Five cards in sequential order, all in the same suit,
such as the 5-6-7-8-9 of spades.
 Royal flush: This is the ultimate poker hand and the highest possi-
ble straight flush. If you wind up with the 10-J-Q-K-A of all spades,
clubs, diamonds, or hearts, you win big time.

Tips and tricks
Not enough information for you? Here are a couple of other handy tips
to remember when you play video poker:
 Keep the rules in mind: A pair of 3s, for example, isn’t going to win
you anything on a jacks-or-better machine. Drawing three cards to
try to get another 3 (for a winning three-of-a-kind) means that you
only have two chances to get it right (there are only two more 3s in
the deck). If you have an ace and jack with those two 3s, however,
you can keep the high cards and draw for a possible jacks-or-better
pair. By doing so, you increase your odds of winning (you now have
six chances of getting a winning hand — three more aces and three
more jacks).
 Don’t risk a sure thing: Unless you’re bent on hitting all or nothing,
consider keeping a winning hand, regardless of the potential of hit-
ting the mother lode. Say you are dealt the A-K-10 of spades, and
the jacks of hearts and diamonds. You may be tempted to go for the
royal flush by keeping the A-K-10, but the odds of you getting it are
around 1 in 40,000. Keep your sure-thing pair of jacks, and try to
build on that.
Blackjack: Hit Me!
Most casino gaming tables are devoted to the game of blackjack. It’s
very popular, probably because it’s very simple to know the basics and
develop a strategy. You should, however, be aware of a few quirks of
playing this game in a casino.
In short, you compete against the dealer — not the other players — to
get as close to 21 points per hand without going over (known as bust-
ing). Numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (J-Q-K) are
worth 10, and the ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (your choice).
The primary differences among blackjack games are the number of
decks used and the minimum bets allowed. Games range anywhere from
one to six decks per game, and table minimums from $1 to $500 per
hand, although $5 to $10 per hand is the most common. (It’s usually $10
on the Strip.) Most tables also have a maximum bet, so make sure that
you find out what the betting range is for a given table before you sit
down to play.
How to play the game
The first thing you need to do is place your bet on the table. After you
place your bet, the dealer gives you two cards, usually face up, and then
deals himself (or herself, as the case may be) two cards: one face up and
one face down. If your two cards equal 21 (a 10 or face card plus an ace),
the dealer calls blackjack and you win automatically.

John Caldwell’s poker room picks
Poker in Las Vegas has changed a lot over the past five years, with dozens of new
rooms opening in recent years, and the “old” classics getting a facelift to try to com-
pete. If you are staying in a casino/hotel, chances are your casino has a poker room,
and if you just want to play, that might be your best choice. The ten rooms we have
reviewed below are either clearly top shelf rooms, or they have something that makes
them special. Wherever you play, have fun and make the most out of the experience.
The Bellagio Poker Room (% 702-693-7291; www.bellagio.com): Although not as
far ahead as it once was, the Bellagio is still the epicenter of the Las Vegas Poker
scene. At least four major poker events are held here each year. The skill level varies
greatly at the lower levels, but at the top levels, this is as tough a room as there is out
there. Bring your “A” game if you are coming to the Bellagio to play. While the leg-
endary “Big Game” rarely comes together these days, fans of television poker can sit
in the adjacent bar, and see the top names in the game shuffle in and out of the most
notable poker room in town.
Binion’s Poker Room (% 702-366-7397; www.binions.com): Most of the great
moments in tournament poker history have occurred within these walls, as Binion’s
was the host casino of the World Series of Poker for the first 34 years of the event.
Pictures of each world champion from 1970 to 2005 are prominently placed. If these
walls could talk, poker fans would never stop listening. The current poker room hosts
many daily tournaments, and always has no limit games in play. Go and play poker
here, just so you can say you did.
Caesars Palace Poker Room (% 702-366-7397; www.caesars.com): One of the
biggest rooms in town, the Caesars Palace poker room could host 1,000 players if it
needed to. The atmosphere in the room is not great, as they basically converted an
old convention room into the new poker room. The room is off the casino floor, which
some players like, as there are very few external distractions. For fans of low-limit
buy-in tournaments, Caesars has some of the best blind structures of any casino in
town. Daily tournaments often last in excess of 8 hours, and give the better players
time to out-maneuver the competition.
MGM Grand Poker Room (% 702-891-7434; www.mgmgrand.com): The MGM Poker
room is very upscale and hosts daily tournaments which, in our opinion have some of
the weakest fields out there. Many tourists and recreational players play here, and
the vibe is decidedly relaxed and friendly. Few know about the private room upstairs,
where most of the monitors in the sports book can be watched while you play, and the
games are . . . less friendly.
The Mirage Poker Room (% 702-791-7291; www.mirage.com): Once the center of
the poker world, the Mirage is still a great place to play. Recent additions and upgrades
to the surrounding casino (like the Beatles Cirque Du Soleil show) make the Mirage
feel a lot “nicer” than it had in recent years. Big action can be had here, and the daily
tournaments are still somewhat of a draw. 
The Palms Poker Room (% 702-942-6961; www.palms.com): If your TV poker event
was not shot at Bellagio, it may have been shot at the Palms. Everything from “Celebrity

Chapter 11: Luck Be a Lady: Gambling Tips and Tricks 179
Poker Showdown” to the “US Versus the World” poker TV programs were shot here.
The room is small, but the “baby” buy-in no-limit games are some of the most action
filled of any in town. Bring your money, and your heart — chances are you will have
to put your money in play frequently at the Palms to have a profitable trip.
Red Rock Poker Room (% 702-797-7766; www.redrocklasvegas.com): The Red
Rock poker room has become very popular with locals. One of the more high tech room
in town, the dealers have a screen that shows the names of everyone who is playing
at the table. It’s a little odd at first to have the dealer call you by name, but it’s a nice
touch. Also, the room has card tracker and seat tracker technology so that an unfilled
seat does not stay unfilled for long, assuming there is a live body to take its place. The
room offers food service at the table, but only from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
The Rio (% 702-777-6777; www.worldseriesofpoker.com): The Rio is notable in
that it hosts poker’s finest in the World Series of Poker each year. The Poker room has
gotten a recent facelift and hosts daily tournaments that are quite popular. Check the
schedule, and if you want to play against poker’s best in the WSOP, the Rio is the place
to do it.
Venetian Poker Room (% 702-414-7657; www.venetian.com): One of the newer
kids in town is the poker room at the Venetian, and this kid is working hard. The room
offers a special parking area for players, has an aggressive comp program, and has
hosted the legendary “Big Game” in the past (the biggest game in town where the
elite of the elite get together to exchange hundreds of thousands of dollars over the
course of a night). The room has an experienced poker staff, mostly culled from other
poker rooms. The Venetian offers tableside food service, which is becoming more and
more rare at top rooms. The Venetian “Deep Stack” Series, held several times a year,
is one of the most popular mid buy in poker tournament series around.
Wynn Las Vegas Poker Room (% 702-770-3090; www.wynnlasvegas.com): Opened
to much fanfare, the Wynn room is very upscale, and a nice place to play. Most of the
action seems to be at the lower levels, but you will occasionally find some of the bigger
players in town plying their craft here. If you are staying in the hotel, you can put your-
self on a waiting list for a game while you relax in your room — and monitor your posi-
tion on the list from your room instead of sitting in the poker room chomping to get into
the game. The room hosts tournaments most days at noon, and the prize pools can get
fairly juicy at times ($300 or $500 buy in).
A note about games: At any given time, you will probably find at least one active low-
limit hold ’em game running at any given poker room. However, if you want to play
Stud, Omaha, or any other game, it is recommended that you call ahead and see if
your game of choice is being offered. Also, keep in mind if you and four or five friends
want to play draw just like you do at home — ask! It’s possible the room may provide
you a dealer (as long as you pay the time charge).
When you approach the poker room, you will see a podium or desk staffed by an atten-
dant who will put you right into the game of your choice or on the waiting list. (Know
which game(s) you want to be put on the list for in advance — many rooms have a
board on the wall describing the games in action at that time.)
(continued)

If the dealer has a 10 or an ace showing, he will check his hidden card. If
he has a blackjack, everyone sitting at the table loses.
If you don’t have 21, you’re allowed as many additional cards as you
want to try to reach 21. You lose (or bust) if you go over.
If you didn’t bust, and you’ve gone as high as you can (or want to), the
dealer reveals his hidden card and attempts to beat your score. If he

Very soon, you will find yourself with a stack of chips at a poker table with six to nine
other people. Here are some do’s and don’ts for first-timers:
 Do tip the dealer if you win the hand. Observe how others have tipped, and follow
suit. If you don’t know, it’s okay to ask! Tip the waitresses, too.
 Don’t hold up the game by taking more than 15 to 20 seconds to decide what to do.
If you need a little extra time, say “time” so everyone knows you are thinking and
not sleeping. Veteran players get very testy with people who take 3 minutes to
decide whether or not to call an $8 bet.
 Don’t act out of turn. Acting prematurely can give away the strength of your hand.
When you are just starting out, take an extra beat to make sure it’s your turn to act.
 Do place the chips far enough out in front of you so the dealer can easily reach
them when you are going to make or call a bet. DON’T throw the chips at the 
pot — this is called “Splashing the Pot” and will not only anger the other players,
it will identify you as the newbie.
 Do protect your hand. Place a chip or something on your cards to protect them
from being accidentally grabbed by the dealer (you’d be surprised how often this
happens). Also, carefully cover your cards with your hands when checking them.
You can’t believe how good a player the guy next to you is when he knows what
you have.
 Do say the word “raise” when you want to raise. If you put a larger chip in and
don’t say raise (or anything at all), it will be considered a call.
 Do feel free to engage in a bit of table talk. A little light chat is fine, but if you notice
you are the only one talking, either pipe down or find a friendlier game. Games
vary a lot in this way, and you will have to feel out the table’s “temperature” for
yourself.
 Don’t talk about a hand when it is still going on — it could influence the play.
 When you win, do wait until the chips are pushed to you before you give your
cards back to the dealer.

does, you lose; if he doesn’t, you win. If you tie, it’s called a push, and
neither of you wins or loses.
Know the finer points
Blackjack really isn’t all that complicated, but you should know a few
things before you sit down to play a hand. After you read the following
tips, watch a few hands when you enter the casino, and then sit down
and press your luck. And if you still have any questions, ask the dealer.
 Chips to play: Casino blackjack is played with chips, not cash. You
can buy chips in different denominations at the main cashier or at
the table itself. And after you’ve placed a bet on the table and the
dealer starts dealing, don’t touch your bet. If you do, you’re likely
to get a verbal slap on the wrist (often accompanied by a stern
look) from the dealer.
 Dealer minimum: Most casino blackjack games require the dealer
to draw to at least 17. In other words, the dealer can’t quit drawing
cards until her hand totals 17 or higher. Keep this in mind when
devising your own strategy.
 Multi-deck versus single-deck games: Most Vegas blackjack games
use six decks of cards all mixed together in a shoe, which is a spe-
cial card dispenser. The cards are dealt face up in front of you.
Don’t touch them! The dealer is the only one allowed to handle the
cards in these multi-deck games. (You are scolded if you touch
them.) You can occasionally find a single-deck game where the
dealer deals the cards by hand, face down in front of you. In this
case, you are allowed to touch the cards (they’re face down, so you
have to pick them up to look at them). It’s worth noting that most
single-deck games now only pay 6:5 on a natural blackjack instead
of the 3:2 at multi-deck tables.
No matter which type of blackjack game you play, you need to
know the hand signals for hitting (asking for another card) or
standing (telling the dealer that you don’t want another card). It’s
kind of like the secret handshake of blackjack players. (Luckily, no
decoder rings are involved.) You signal for an additional card by
making a light scratching motion toward yourself on the table with
your hand (or with your cards, if you’re holding them). This is sort
of a nonverbal way of saying gimme another one. If you don’t want
to draw, wave your hand once above your cards to signal no more
(or if you’re holding your cards, tuck them face down on the table
gently under your bet).
What’s your strategy?
You better your chances of winning at the blackjack table if you have a
basic strategy going into the game.
If your two cards total 17 or above, don’t draw. Your chances of getting a
higher hand are slim (and the dealer has a decent chance of busting
Chapter 11: Luck Be a Lady: Gambling Tips and Tricks 181

while trying to beat your hand). If you have a two-card total of 11 or less,
draw a card — it’s impossible to go over 21 with one additional card.
When you have 12 to 16 points, regardless of how many cards you have,
things start to get a bit tricky. This is when you should take a long, hard
look at the dealer’s single upturned card. If you fall into that 12- to 16-
point range, and the dealer has a 7 or higher showing, you should proba-
bly draw a card. Chances are that the dealer has a 10-point card hidden,
and you lose if you don’t draw a card. If the dealer has a 6 or lower card
showing, she’ll probably have to draw (to reach at least 17), and there’s
a good chance of her going over 21 and losing. Consider staying, even
with a hand as low as 12.
Insurance
When the dealer has an ace upturned, she asks if you want to take out
insurance. When taking out insurance, you’re allowed to place an addi-
tional bet of up to half your original wager (for example, if you bet $10,
you can wager up to $5 on an insurance bet). If the dealer has 21, you
lose your original bet but are paid 2:1 on your insurance bet. By doing
so, you come out even if your insurance bet was half your original bet
(you lose your $10 bet but gain an additional $5 on the insurance bet;
are you following us on this?). If the dealer does not have 21, you lose
your insurance bet, and the game proceeds as usual. Many gambling afi-
cionados, including our humble selves, consider this a sucker bet,
because the odds are that the dealer won’t have 21. We suggest that you
don’t bother with insurance.
Doubling down
If you want to do even more fancy stuff at the blackjack tables, you can
double down. You place this bet after you are dealt your first two cards
but before any additional cards are dealt. You must double the amount
you bet by placing additional chips on the table (for example, if you orig-
inally bet $10, you put out another $10 in chips). By doing this, you are
hoping that your next card will give you a high enough hand to win —
but you only get one additional card. The odds are that your one addi-
tional card will be worth 10 points (a 10 or a face card), so you should
go with this option when your first two cards total 10 or 11, and the
dealer has a low card showing. If you’re lucky, you wind up with 20 or 21
and will probably win the hand and double your entire bet. If you get a
low card, however, you don’t get another card to boost your point total,
and you’re likely to lose it all. Hey, that’s why they call it gambling!
Splitting
Splitting is another option you can try if you’re feeling adventurous.
Here’s the deal: You’re allowed to split when the first two cards you’re
dealt are of the same value (for example, two 7s). If you tell the dealer
that you want to split this hand, the two cards on the table will be sepa-
rated, and you then lay down additional chips equal to your original bet.
The dealer then treats each card as a separate hand, and you can draw
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
182

as many cards as you like to get as close to 21 as possible for each hand.
Whichever hand beats the dealer wins double that bet (and you may
even win with both hands). If either (or both) of your hands doesn’t beat
the dealer, you lose the bet.
When deciding whether to split your hand, consider this: Most people
agree that two aces or two 8s should always be split into separate
hands. This is generally a good bet because the odds are in your favor
that you wind up with two better hands than the one you would have
had otherwise.
Tips and tricks
Blackjack is an easy game to play and can be a lot of fun under the right
conditions:
 Find a fun dealer: Before you choose your table, watch the dealer to
see if she is one of the stone-faced, boring ones, or if she has some
kick. A fun dealer often chats, offers advice, and generally makes the
entire experience more enjoyable. On the other hand, if you’re in a
somber mood, you may want a no-nonsense dealer. Your choice.
 Look for fun tablemates: Same concept as in the preceding bullet,
only this one has to do with the other gamblers at the table. If every-
one is sitting around looking sour and concentrating mightily on his
cards, you may want to bypass the table. Scope out a table where
your tablemates are whooping it up, and you may have a better time.
 Keep a stash: Any financial planner will tell you that you should
always save. And it’s no different when gambling. Keep two piles of
chips — one for betting and one for saving. Every time you win a
hand, set aside part of your winnings (maybe half?) into the “don’t
touch” pile, and then, well, don’t touch it. If your luck takes a bad
turn, and you go through your betting pile, walk away. At least you
still have money left.
 Practice with video blackjack. Most of the better casinos have
nifty computerized video blackjack games that cost a quarter a try.
Because most blackjack tables on the Strip start at $10, this is an
economical way to at least get a feel for the game before you start
laying down real money. It’s not precisely the same as working with
a real dealer, and the odds aren’t the same, but the rules are, and
that’s what matters if you’re a beginner.
 Gamble downtown. Serious gamblers — and by that we mean
those who play to win, pure and simple — particularly blackjack
players, always gamble downtown. They don’t care about glitz, and
flash, and themes. They want single-deck play, because they believe
that the odds are better, and because they stand a better chance of
card counting (not that they do that, nosirree — that’s their story
and they’re sticking to it!). You may want to join them for these
same reasons, and also because the minimum stakes are lower —
as low as $5 a hand as opposed to $10 on the Strip.
Chapter 11: Luck Be a Lady: Gambling Tips and Tricks 183

While playing blackjack, be sure to ask the dealer or the pit boss (the
employee overseeing a group of tables) about restaurants, shows, and
attractions in that particular hotel. If you’ve been betting a decent
amount of money per hand (think $25 per hand for a few hours in the big
hotels) and have been playing a while, you may get a comp (complimen-
tary) meal, show ticket, or other discount. You have to ask for these,
however, because they are rarely offered.
Roulette: Take a Spin
Lots of people have seen roulette wheels, but few ever sit down to play.
The game is actually quite easy to learn and can be a lot of fun to play. It
does, however, have a huge house advantage, so keep that in mind.
Here are the basics of playing roulette: A ball is spun on a wheel with 38
numbers (0, 00, and 1 through 36). The 0 and 00 spaces are green, and
the other numbers are either red or black (divided evenly between the
two colors). You place your bets on the field, which is a grid layout on
the table showing all the numbers and a variety of different combina-
tions (see Figure 11-3). Inside bets are those placed on the 0 through 36
number part of the field. Outside bets are placed in the boxes surround-
ing the numbers and include red, black, even, odd, 1 through 18, 19
through 36, 1st 12, 2nd 12, 3rd 12, and the columns bets. The object is
for the ball to settle on one of the numbers (or other options) that
you’ve placed bets on.
Note that you can win on more than one bet on a single spin, depending
on the outcome. For example, if you place a bet on 8, even, and 1st 12, you
can potentially win all three bets if the ball lands on 8. Pretty cool, huh?
How to bet on roulette
After you choose your table, you can exchange some cash or chips for
special roulette chips. Each player at the table has a different color of
chips, so it’s easy to keep track of yours. Then you can start placing
your bets on the field (see Figure 11-3). You are allowed to bet even after
the ball begins spinning; but once the ball starts to fall toward the num-
bers, bets are cut off.
Inside bets are complicated, so we’re going to stick to the outside bets,
with one exception: single-number bets (see the upcoming description).
Outside bets don’t pay out as much, but beginners should probably
stick with them at first.
 Odd-Even: If you place a bet in the Odd field and an odd number
comes up on the wheel, you win double your bet placed on that
field. If it comes up as an even number, you lose that bet. It follows,
then, that if an even number comes up, you win for bets placed in
the Even field. If either 0 or 00 comes up, you lose bets placed in
either field.
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
184

Figure 11-3: A standard roulette table.
 Red-Black: This one is really simple. Place your chips on a color,
and you win if a number comes up in the color you bet. If you bet
red, and the ball lands on a red number, you double your bet (but
you lose if black comes up). If 0 or 00 comes up — you guessed 
it! — you lose.
 1-18, 19-36: If you place chips in either of these boxes, and the win-
ning number falls within the range listed, you double your money
for that bet. Suppose that you bet on 1-18, and the number 15
comes up on the wheel; you win. If the number 32 comes up, you
lose. If 0 or 00 comes up on the wheel, you lose these bets.
 1st 12, 2nd 12, 3rd 12: This is similar to the 1-18 and 19-36 bets,
only a little more specific. Bet on the 1st 12, and if any number
between 1 and 12 hits, you win triple your bet. If any other number
hits, you lose your bet. The same concept applies with bets on the
2nd 12 (numbers 13–24) and the 3rd 12 (numbers 25–36).
 Column bets: At the end of the Inside fields are three boxes that
are marked 2 to 1 (refer to Figure 11-3). If you place chips here,
you’re betting that the winning number on the wheel is going to be
one of the numbers in the column above that box. If it is, you triple
your bet. If it isn’t, you lose it all.
 Single-number bets: This is the one inside bet that you may want
to try. Place your chips on any single number on the field (17 or 34,
for example), and if that number comes up, you win 35 times your

bet. This is fun to play, and the winnings can be big, but the odds
are way against you.
Tips and tricks
Here’s some common-sense advice for first-timers:
 Look for single-zero roulette: As we mention earlier, most tables
and wheels have both 0 and 00. A few have only the 0. If you can
find one of these single-zero tables (the Monte Carlo has them),
play it, because your odds are slightly better with fewer possible
numbers (only 37 instead of 38) on the wheel.
 Stick with the outside bets: It’s tempting to place all your money
on your one single lucky number. Doing so can be exciting, but the
problem is that you’re much more likely to lose. The outside bets
may not seem as glamorous, and they certainly don’t pay out as
much, but your money goes farther, and the odds of winning are a
lot better.
Keno: The Lotto of the Casinos
The ancient Chinese played a game that was very similar to your local
lotto, and keno is based on the same concept. It may not be as adrena-
line-filled as craps, but it’s a good diversion while you’re sitting in a
hotel restaurant or lounge.
In the game of keno, a computer randomly draws 20 numbers from a
field of 1 through 80. You place various bets on which numbers will
come up, and if enough of your numbers do come up, you win.
Large keno boards (with the 80 numbers displayed) are scattered
throughout casinos — often in the coffee shops and lounges. You can get
a keno ticket from the restaurant tables or at the bar. The ticket shows
the 80 numbers (called spots) and has boxes for the amount of your bet
and the number of sequential games you want to play (see Figure 11-4).
You place a bet by filling out the ticket and giving it to the runner, who
then takes it to the keno lounge. You can find keno runners walking
around the casino floor and inside the hotel’s restaurants and bars.
Their uniforms usually identify them as keno runners, but they also
announce their presence as they drift around.
Casinos vary wildly regarding the possible bets you can make and the
payout odds for bets, but the most common bets are 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-
spot bets. If you play a 6-spot game, for example, you mark six numbers
on the ticket and hand it in. Just like with the lotto, if your six numbers
come up, you win. If five of your six numbers are selected, you also win,
but substantially less than you would have with all six numbers. Four
matching numbers will likely pay even money, and three or fewer match-
ing numbers loses.

Figure 11-4: A sample keno ticket.
Keep in mind that you have to cash in winning tickets before the start of
the next game, or you lose it all. If you can’t find a keno runner, take your
ticket to the keno cashier right away to get paid. Also, before you go
dreaming about hitting the big jackpot, know this: The house advantage
on keno is greater than in any other game in the casino.
In true Vegas style, you can change your betting strategy so that this fun-
damentally simple game takes a complex turn. For example, you can
make bets involving groupings and splits. However, this is much more
than you need to know if you’re just looking for something to do while
waiting for your drink. Just pick your lucky numbers and go. The best
advice we can offer is that betting on fewer spots means better odds of
winning. It’s a lot easier to get 6 out of 6 than it is to get 10 out of 10.
Plus, if you get five numbers on a 6-spot ticket, you win something,
whereas five numbers on a 10-spot will probably get you zippo. You
won’t win as much on a lower spot ticket, but you’re likely to win more
often.

Craps: Roll the Dice and Play the Odds
If you’ve ever heard that craps is really complicated — you’ve heard
right. Oh, we struggled with it. We read books. We had people explain.
Our eyes always glazed over. We considered and wondered if a quick
course in quantum physics . . .
Now, we think we’ve finally gotten it. Despite our initial handicap, many
people figure it out rather quickly (or else are faking it by randomly hurl-
ing money at the table — that works, too). Playing craps can be a little
intimidating, but it is possible to play a simple game. Basically, bets are
placed on what number will come up on a pair of dice thrown. You can
place bets even if you’re not the one throwing the dice. Table 11-1 shows
how the 36 combinations stack up.

The person who is rolling the dice is called the shooter. When the
shooter makes her first roll, it’s called coming out. The object is for the
shooter to get a 7 or 11 in any combination (2 and 5, 5 and 6, and so on)
on the first roll. That’s an automatic winner for anyone playing the pass
line (see upcoming section, “The pass-line bet”). If the shooter rolls a 2,
3, or 12, she craps out, and it is an automatic loser for anyone playing
the pass line. If any other number comes up on the come-out roll (4, 5, 6,
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
188

8, 9, or 10), this number becomes the point, and the object of the game
switches a little. After a point number has been established, the goal is
for the shooter to roll the point number again before rolling a 7. If a 7
comes up before the point, then the shooter has crapped out, and you
lose your pass-line bet. Any time the shooter craps out, the dice are
passed to the next shooter, and the game starts over.
The following sections describe how you place bets on various parts of
the gaming table (see also Figure 11-5).
There’s a lot more to this game than what we describe in this section. For
example, you can play the odds (make side bets that are placed on the
point number), buy bets, and lay bets. If you are a beginner, we suggest
that you stick with the pass line and come bets (see upcoming section,
“The come bet”) at first. These are the easiest to play, and they offer the
best odds. If you’re interested in knowing more about the intricacies of
craps, check out the upcoming section, “More Information on Gambling.”
Figure 11-5: A standard craps table.
The pass line bet
You should stick with the pass line bet if you’re a beginner. When playing
this type of bet, you place your initial bet on the “PASS LINE,” which means
that you are betting that the player will not crap out. A roll of 7 or 11, or
establishing a point number and rolling it before a 7, wins double your
bet. Here’s an example to help you out: Say that you place your bet on
the pass line. After you place it on the pass line, you can’t touch it until
you win or lose. The shooter rolls a 4. This is now the point. The next
roll is a 5 and then a 10. Finally, on the fourth throw, the shooter rolls a 4
and you win. If that fourth throw had turned up a 7, you would have lost.
The don’t pass bar bet
The don’t pass bar bet, placed on the “DON’T PASS BAR,” is exactly the
opposite of the pass bet. You’re betting that the shooter will crap out
before winning. If the shooter rolls a 7 or 11, or establishes and then
makes a point number, you lose a don’t pass bet. If the shooter rolls a 2,
3, or 12, or craps out before making his point, then you win double.

The come bet
You place a come bet after the shooter establishes a point number. For
example, say the shooter throws a 6 on his first throw. That is the point
number, and placing a bet in the “COME” field is now just like a pass-line
bet. You are wagering that the next throw of the dice will be 7 or 11. If it
is, you win double. If the next throw is a 2, 3, or 12, you lose. If it is any
other number, the bet is moved into the corresponding box (4, 5, 6, 8, 9,
or 10), where it remains until the shooter either rolls the number again
(you win) or rolls a 7 (you lose).
The don’t come bet
The don’t come bet, placed on the “DON’T COME BAR,” is the pessimists’
version of the come bet: You win double if the throw is 2, 3, or 12, and
lose if it is a 7 or 11. If any other number appears (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), you
win if a 7 is thrown before that number is repeated, but lose if it is not.
The place bet
To make a place bet, put your chips in the “PLACE BETS” field above any
number. You are betting that the number will be rolled before a 7 is
rolled. You can increase, decrease, or remove your bet entirely at any
time during play.
The Hard Way, Big 6/8, Field, and Proposition bets
The Hard Way, Big 6, Big 8, Field, and Proposition bets make up the
remainder of the gaming table. If you win on one of these bets, you can
win big; but these bets are, according to most people, not worth the
effort, because the odds are against you in every single case.
 The Hard Way bets wager that 4, 6, 8, or 10 will be rolled, with one
catch: The numbers must come up on the dice as double numbers
(two 2s, 3s, 4s, or 5s, depending on which box you choose), and the
combination has to appear before the number is thrown in any
other combination or before a 7 appears.
 The Big 6 and Big 8 bets say that the shooter will throw a 6 or 8
before a 7 appears — the same as a place bet but with lower pay-
back odds.
 A Field bet wagers that the next throw of the dice will be a 2, 3, 4,
9, 10, 11, or 12, which are the seven least likely numbers to appear.
This bet is based on one single roll of the dice; avoid it if you’re a
beginner.
 Proposition bets say that the next roll will be either 2, 3, 7, 11, or 12
(there’s a box for each), or any craps (2, 3, or 12). This bet is also
based on one single roll of the dice and, again, should be avoided if
you’re a beginner.

Tips and tricks
Okay, so we’re not seasoned craps players. But we do listen, and we’ve
managed to pick up some tips that we are happy to pass on to you.
 If you can find a table with any room, just stand and watch for a
while. Even if you think that you still don’t understand the game, it
will become a lot clearer when you see it in action. Maybe.
 It’s definitely exciting to be the shooter, but it’s a lot easier to bet
and watch your money if you let someone else roll the dice. Feel
free to pass when your turn as shooter comes around if you’re not
comfortable trying to roll and manage your bets. Alternatively, just
don’t bet when you’re shooting.
 Avoid the Hard Way and one-roll bets like the plague. You almost
always lose.
The Other Games in Town
The games that we mention earlier in this chapter are the most popular
games, but they certainly are not the only ones in town. In addition, you
can also find the following games:
 Standard poker: This game is pretty much the same as video
poker, only with real players and real cards. You don’t play against
the house (although the house does take a percentage of the pot),
so you have a better shot at winning here than in any other game.
 Three Card Poker: This is rapidly gaining in popularity and you
find at least one table in most of the major casinos. It’s actually
much more difficult to explain than it is to play — basically, you are
dealt three cards with no draw and you have to make the best
poker hand out of those three cards — so we recommend that you
watch a table for a bit before giving it a try.
 Baccarat: This is a complex card game that is similar to blackjack;
actually, the main thing that you need to know is that you bet on
either the bank or the player — the dealer does all the rest of the
work.
 Mini-baccarat: This is pretty much the same as baccarat, only a
little simpler.
 Pai-gow poker: This is a Chinese take on seven-card stud poker.
 Let-it-ride and Caribbean stud: These are two more poker-based
card games.
 Sports betting: Yep, you can bet on just about any game in the
world by stopping in at your hotel’s Sports Book — the area of a
casino where sports betting occurs — and placing a wager.

More Information on Gambling
The information we provide throughout this chapter gives you a good,
basic overview on the most popular games in the casinos. If you want to
know even more, check out the following valuable resources:
 Hotel gaming lessons: If you want some nitty-gritty details on the
table game of your choice, ask if your hotel offers gaming lessons:
Many do. These lessons are very helpful, and they are usually
taught in an easy-to-understand manner, right at the table, so that
you can see what’s going on. The lessons are also often free.
 Computer games: You can find tons of computer games for sale at
retail stores. These games simulate live play and enable you to
know the rules of casino gambling. If you’re hooked up to the
Internet or any of the subscriber services such as AOL, simply
search for “games” or “casino games” and you will likely find a
bunch of shareware programs that you can download free.
Where to Play
Trust us: In Las Vegas, you will not lack for opportunities to gamble. If
you’re in a gambling frame of mind, you can start with the slot machines
at the airport baggage carousel and keep going at restaurants, coffee
shops, bars, and so on. We won’t take up your time by listing every
single casino in town; suffice it to say that every hotel on the Strip has a
gigantic casino with all the games you could ever want to play. In many
ways, a casino is a casino is a casino. They all have machines and tables
and chances for joy or heartbreak. Some people may want a casino with
a theme because it’s fun and gambling is fun, while others may find the
themes distracting because gambling is serious business. Let’s face it:
Ultimately, your favorite casino is one you’ve won at. Here are some casi-
nos that we like (and some that we don’t — only because we’ve lost
there).
Casinos for the serious gambler
The Mirage (3400 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-791-7111) is our favorite
place to gamble — and not even because we’ve won all that much there.
Quite the opposite, in fact. This casino is large and surprisingly quiet,
allowing for minimal distractions from your desire to win. If you want to
play serious poker on the Strip, this is the place to go.
Going up the serious ladder is the Las Vegas Hilton (3000 Paradise Rd.;
% 702-732-7111). This one boasts a medium-size gambling area filled
with Austrian crystal chandeliers and marble galore (and don’t forget
the Spacequest Casino, discussed in the following section).
But if you really want to gamble in high-class style, you should go to
Mandalay Bay (3950 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-632-7777), the Monte
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
192

Carlo (3770 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-730-7777), or the Venetian (3355
Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-414-1000). All these casinos are variations on
a theme: classy, European-style casinos, full of towering ceilings, marble,
and glitzy lights. Tacky touches are kept at bay. Although these casinos
are attractive places, we think that the results are pretty interchange-
able; when you’ve seen one of them, you’ve seen them all. On the other
hand, they tend to be less noisy and chaotic than some of the others.
Outstripping even these casinos in the hoity-toity department is the
Bellagio (3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 888-987-6667). The Bellagio was
built with high rollers and lovers of class in mind, as were the casinos
mentioned earlier, but the Bellagio takes it up a notch or two on the
grand meter. Oh, does it feel serious. We’ve heard that the slot machines
have been constructed to make less of a crash-clang than usual, but this
may be a nuance too subtle for use to really notice. If you love the look
of Bellagio, you should also try out the newer Wynn Las Vegas (3131 Las
Vegas Blvd. S., % 702-770-7700), given that a common first impression
is “It looks like Bellagio!”
Casinos for the not-so-serious gambler
Harrah’s Las Vegas (3475 Las Vegas Blvd. S; % 702-369-5000) has a fes-
tive European carnival theme. This place may have the friendliest deal-
ers in town.
The casino at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (4455 Paradise Rd.; % 702-
693-5000) is a masterpiece of Vegas silliness. The craps tables are
shaped like grand pianos, some slot machines have guitar necks for han-
dles, and the gaming chips have faces of famous rock stars on them. The
decibel level is high — be prepared for blaring rock music — but it
makes for a much looser vibe. Try to bet to the beat. And if you’re stay-
ing there, don’t forget to visit the pool’s swim-up blackjack table. And
yes, we asked — they give you little waterproof pouches for holding your
money.
Caesars Palace (3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S; % 702-731-7110) offers serious
luxury for serious gamblers, but lovers of the absurd will have a great
time here, too. After all, the cocktail waitresses are wearing togas, and
faux marble Roman statues keep an eye on the proceedings. And that’s
not even counting regular appearances by Roman gladiators and sol-
diers, and Caesar and Cleopatra.
Hey, and speaking of silly, don’t overlook the fabulous New York-New
York casino (3790 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-740-6969). The machines
are grouped in an area called “The Pacific Slot Exchange,” and the 
backs of the chairs at the tables are dressed in tuxedos. All this is set in
areas designed to look like New York city landmarks — Central Park,
Greenwich Village, and so on.
In summer, Tropicana Resort & Casino (3801 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-
739-2222) offers swim-up blackjack in its beautiful tropical pool area.
Chapter 11: Luck Be a Lady: Gambling Tips and Tricks 193

And then there’s Circus Circus (2880 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-734-0410),
which hits new heights in distractions — literally — with frequent live
circus aerial acts over its casino. Is that trapeze artist going to miss and
land on your winning poker hand? And if he does, does that count as a
push?
And speaking of overhead distractions, the Rio (3700 W. Flamingo Rd.;
% 702-252-7777) interrupts play (or it would, if you find that you can’t
pull a slot handle while looking up at the ceiling) several times each
night with its “Masquerade in the Sky” Mardi Gras show. This show takes
place in the much more appealing part of the Rio’s casino, an extension
that has a very high ceiling (the better to accommodate said show).
Casinos for the budget gambler
If you’re gambling on a budget (and don’t want to break the bank), head
downtown to make your money last the longest. Or just rejoice that just
about every casino, even on the Strip, has added at least one bank of
penny slots. C’mon — even the tightest tightwad in Miserville can afford
to play those babies.
Binion’s (128 E. Fremont St.; % 702-382-1600) is a great example of Old
Las Vegas. Because of its reputation, those people claiming to be real
gamblers won’t play anywhere but Binion’s.
A few blocks down the street from Binion’s is the El Cortez Hotel &
Casino (600 E. Fremont St.; % 702-385-5200) offering roulette with mini-
mum bets as low as $1, and $3 craps. 
A casino for those who think bigger is better
The MGM Grand (3799 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-891-7777) has one of
the largest casinos in the world. And it is, needless to say, really, really
big. Four football fields would fit in here, with room left over for several
basketball courts. You can decide if that’s a good thing or a bad thing.
Slot-lore has it that the Majestic Lions slot machines here are always a
sure thing.
A cozy casino for your gambling pleasure
Or go in the completely opposite direction and head to one of our
favorites, the Main Street Station (200 N. Main; % 702-387-1896). This
is actually a sweet little place (pretty, even), with its turn-of-the-century
San Francisco style. We love it.
Many of the casinos in the downtown area are small and are not affili-
ated with any hotel. You often see employees standing out front trying to
lure you inside with the promise of free stuff. Avoid these places,
because, almost without exception, your free gift isn’t worth it.

W
hat truly separates Sin City from other destinations is, of course,
gambling — were you expecting cathedrals or something? But
you can’t sit at a slot machine forever. (Or maybe you can.) If there is
one sure bet in Las Vegas, it’s that you won’t lack for things to do,
regardless of your personal tastes or budget. However, Vegas being
Vegas, the attractions here are not quite the same as what you find in
other destinations. The city’s most notable must-sees are those mam-
moth theme hotels.
But glitzy, over-the-top hotels are not all there is to Vegas — although,
by the time you are through investigating all the jaw-dropping architec-
ture on the Strip, you may be too exhausted to learn otherwise. Sure,
Vegas has lavish shows and Elvis impersonators, but it also has off-the-
wall museums and free street-side extravaganzas. Rest assured that you
can find plenty of action-packed fun to fill your time in between poker
hands. Having said that, please note that there are fewer and fewer
family-appropriate activities, even for the locals. And as Vegas continues
to build and dazzle, newer resorts seem less likely to put up an amuse-
ment park or a shark exhibit, and more inclined to build saucy burlesque
nightclubs or another posh spa. In other words, a growing emphasis is
being placed on relaxation or night-time partying — neither of which is a
bad thing on its own, of course!

If you are spending a lot of time (or money) gambling in one casino,
check with the dealer or casino attendant to find out if you can get a dis-
counted (or free) admission to the hotel’s attractions. A simple “How
much is it to get into (fill in the blank)?” may get you a free pass if you’re
dumping money into their coffers via the casino.
On a strict budget? Lost all your money in the slots? No problem. You
can find lots of inexpensive diversions in town to keep you amused (and
away from the casinos). Many of the free publications in town, such as
LVM, include coupons for discount admissions to attractions. In addi-
tion, some hotels have people at the front door passing out coupons for
discounted admission to the hotel’s attractions. And don’t forget that
you can check out the free hotel shows, such as Bellagio’s exquisite
water fountains or The Mirage volcano.
What’s Your Priority?
Although we only include Vegas’s most entertaining or unusual sights in
the following listings, unless you’re planning on being here for a while,
you’re going to need to prioritize. For consistency’s sake, we’re sticking
with the South, North, and Central Strip neighborhoods, which parallel
those set up in the hotel and restaurant chapters. Remember that a
Paradise Road designation means that an attraction is located some-
where near Paradise Road and not necessarily on it. As in other chap-
ters, we use the Off the Beaten Path designation for places that are
located outside the defined neighborhoods but are worth the extra time
and mileage.
If your time in Las Vegas is limited, try to plan the attractions you want
to see by neighborhood, instead of running all over town. If you stick to
one area at a time, you maximize your sightseeing opportunities.
Unless we note otherwise, all the following attractions offer free valet or
do-it-yourself parking.
Las Vegas’s Top Sites from A to Z
Adventuredome
North Strip
Though showing its age, this miniature amusement park under a giant pink
dome may be a good place to head on a hot day. It has a double-loop roller
coaster, a water flume, laser tag, and a few other rides — plus a separate
video/carnival game arcade, food stands, and a couple of non-stomach
churning rides for the smaller kids. Kids and adults alike will have their fill
of this place after a couple hours.

Las Vegas Attractions Overview
Chapter 12: Discovering Las Vegas’s Best Attractions 197

for children 33–47 in. Per-ride prices: $4–$7. Open: Park hours vary season to season,
but generally Mon–Thurs 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–midnight, Sun 10 a.m.–9 p.m.
Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art
Center Strip
This isn’t black velvet paintings or motel art — but it is hotel art, in that it
was founded by then-Bellagio (and The Mirage and Treasure Island)
owner Steve Wynn, a most respected art collector. When MGM took over
his hotel empire, Wynn’s art collection was moved out. Now the gallery is
home to notable traveling exhibitions and other events, including a criti-
cally acclaimed exhibit of the collection of actor Steve Martin, plus shows
featuring Warhol, Monet, and Picasso ceramics. It’s not cheap, but surely
it’s worth spending a little money for some honest-to-goodness cultah. Be
sure to see what’s up when you’re in town.
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Bellagio). % 888-488-7111
or 702-693-7871 www.bellagio.com. Admission $17 adults; $14 seniors, Nevada
residents, $14 teachers and students with I.D. Sun-Thurs 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Fri–Sat 10
a.m.–9 p.m. Last admission half-hour prior to closing.
Bellagio Water Fountains
Center Strip
Okay, so you have probably seen water fountains that shoot geysers into
the air, cued to some musical number. Ho-hum. But if you trust us on any-
thing, trust us on this: This is far, far better than what you’ve experienced
before, and it is easily the coolest, classiest free show in Vegas. Yeah, it’s
water geysers shooting into the air, keyed to musical numbers; but this
water shoots into the air to an impossible height, and then flirts and dances,
moves like Baryshnikov, and is as witty as it is pretty. The music ranges from
opera to Sinatra, with some pop and show tunes thrown in. Make a point of
seeing at least one number; we bet you stick around for a second and third.
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (at the corner of Flamingo Rd. out-
side the Bellagio). Admission: Free. Performances take place every 30 min. from 3–8
p.m. weekdays and noon–8 p.m. weekends and every 15 min. nightly 8 p.m.–midnight.
Bodies: The Exhibition 
South Strip 
This exhibition of preserved human bodies and organs puts the “eewww”
back in “cool.” Cadavers, stripped to the muscle and sometimes beyond,
are displayed in athletic poses designed to vividly illustrate just how those
muscles work, while other body parts are dissected for similar demon-
strative purposes (cross sections of lungs showing the damage inflicted
by smoking, for example). It’s completely scientific rather than exploita-
tive, but we won’t kid you — if you think too much about the source of the
contents of the informative displays, it is a little icky. Some may find it too
intense, but many others will be so intrigued and fascinated you will want
to make a return visit. There certainly is nothing else like it in Vegas.

The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace Fountain Shows
Center Strip
Toga, toga! No, it’s not a tribute to Animal House, nor is it John Belushi
springing to life in the center of two giant marble fountains in this snazzy
shopping arcade. It’s really Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and debauch-
ery (and thus, if we may mix religious metaphors, the patron saint of

Vegas). Every hour on the hour, the faux-marble Bacchus and his buddies
creakily (and creepily) move and speak to the accompaniment of lasers,
water, and smoke. In the Roman Great Hall (at the end of the expansion),
the Atlantis fountain uses hydraulics, projection-screen TVs, and fire
effects to entertain the crowd.
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3500 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (at the Forum Shops at Caesars
Palace). % 702-893-4800. Admission: Free. Open: Shows hourly Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–
11 p.m., Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–midnight.

Fremont Street Experience
Downtown
This high-tech light-and-laser show is Lazerium, Vegas-style. The Fremont
Street Experience is a 5-block open-air pedestrian mall, a landscaped strip
of outdoor cafes, vendor carts, and colorful kiosks purveying food and
merchandise. Overhead is a 90-foot-high steel-mesh “celestial vault”; at
night, it’s the Viva Vision, a high-tech light-and-laser show enhanced by
a concert hall–quality sound system, which takes place several times
nightly. It got a major overhaul in 2005, which turned the display from a
basic animated LED thing to something more high-tech and clear, like the
full video display hotel marquees on the Strip. You’re more likely to hear
Ol’ Blue Eyes than Pink Floyd; it’s just slightly cheesy, but it’s still good
gawking fun. Shows rotate throughout the night and seasonally (the
Christmas show is a lot of fun). Aerialists and live bands perform between
shows on some nights. The crowd it attracts is more upscale than in years
past, and of course, downtown is a lot less crowded than the hectic Strip.
Fitzgeralds hotel has an upstairs balcony and a downstairs McDonald’s
that both offer good views of the show.
See map p. 197. On Fremont St., between Main St. and Las Vegas Blvd. % 702-678-
5777. www.vegasexperience.com. Admission: Free. Open: Nightly, with shows
every hour, on the hour, from dusk to midnight.
Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian
Center Strip
If you haven’t made it to Venice this year, you might try strolling through
the grand shopping arcade at the Venetian. Oh, it’s not really like being in
Venice, but between the nifty Venetian facades, the re-creation of St. Mark’s
Square and other Venetian landmarks, the actual canal complete with
singing gondoliers (who will give you a ride if you give them money), the
flower girls who sing arias, and the attentions of a flirty Casanova, it’s not
an unacceptable substitute. Costumed characters roam the area, bursting
into song or interacting with visitors, while glass blowers and other ven-
dors inhabit the square. As if this weren’t enjoyable enough, there are over
70 brand-name stores where you can drop all your gambling winnings.
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3355 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Venetian). % 702-414-1000.
Open: Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–11 p.m., Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–midnight.
Liberace Museum
Off the Beaten Path
Class. Subtlety. Taste. You won’t find any of that here! God love Liberace,
and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Whether you’re a fan of the outra-
geous performer or not, this “museum” (remodeled to even more gaudy
gloriousness) is a must for Vegas visitors. Costumes (bejeweled), many
cars (bejeweled), many pianos (bejeweled), and many jewels (also bejew-
eled) fill multiple buildings, all celebrating the camp silliness that was
Liberace (the patron saint of Veg — oh, no, wait, that was Bacchus). You
Chapter 12: Discovering Las Vegas’s Best Attractions 201

can also see his 50-pound, $50,000 rhinestone and a gift shop with count-
less knickknacks of increasing tackiness. It’s campy fun, so don’t take it
too seriously. Two hours (if you’re counting rhinestones) is plenty of time
to see it all.
But be careful: Flash photography may result in blindness around all those
stones!
See map p. 197. 1775 E. Tropicana Ave. (at Spencer St., about 3 miles west of the Strip
on the right). % 702-798-5595. www.liberace.org. Admission $15 adults, $10 sen-
iors over 64 and student with ID, free for children 10 and under.Open: Tues–Sat 
10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon–4 p.m.
Lied Discovery Children’s Museum
Off the Beaten Path
A hands-on science museum designed for curious kids, the bright, airy, two-
story Lied makes an ideal outing for toddlers and young children. Clever,
thoughtful exhibits are everywhere, allowing children to experience life
from all angles. Play a steel drum. Mine soft-sculpture “boulders.” See how
much sunscreen the giant stuffed mascot needs to keep from burning. Drop-
in art classes are offered on weekend afternoons. Teenagers will probably
find it to be a big yawn, but it’s a terrific diversion for younger kids as long
as you don’t tell them it’s educational, and adults will enjoy it, too.
See map p. 197. 833 Las Vegas Blvd. N. (about 11⁄2 miles north of Fremont). % 702-382-
3445. www.ldcm.org. Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors, military and children 1–17.
Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Madame Tussaud’s Celebrity Encounter
Center Strip
Forget any of the cheesy wax museums you may have previously visited —
they’re all amateurs compared with the genuine (though still a wee bit
hokey) art created by the legendary Madame Tussaud’s. (The original is
still the most popular tourist attraction in London.) Waxing nostalgic?
Every figure here represents a noted person in the entertainment or sports
world, and you’re free to get up close to take pictures with them. You also
find a section where you can see the incredible, painstaking effort that
goes into perfectly replicating a celebrity in wax. We miss the famously
ghoulish “Chamber of Horrors,” but at least this way you don’t have to
worry about scaring your kids. Frankly, we think the whole thing is way
too much money to look at big lifelike dolls, but what the hey; if nothing
else, look at how nicely air-conditioned this exhibit has to be!
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3355 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Venetian). % 702-862-7805.
$24 adults, $18 seniors, $15 students, $14 children 7–12, free for children 6 and under.
Open: Daily 10 a.m.–10 p.m., but hours vary seasonally, and museum may close early
for private events.

Manhattan Express Roller Coaster
South Strip
Apparently, the designers of New York-New York didn’t think that their
little Big Apple looked busy enough, so they threw in a roller coaster. It’s
designed to look like a New York City cab, and it plummets, loops, and rolls
in and around the hotel’s re-created New York skyline. A unique feature of
the ride is the barrel-roll drop, which turns you upside down and then
drops you straight toward the ground. (And you thought nothing was as
scary as a New York City cab ride.) Enter through the second-level arcade

and be prepared for a long line. You need to be at least 54 inches tall to
ride.
See maps p. 197 and 199. 3790 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the New York-New York). % 702-
740-6969. Admission: $14, multi-ride, all-day, and group packages also available.
Open: Sun–Thurs 11 a.m.–11 p.m., Fri–Sat 10:30 a.m.–midnight.
The Mirage Volcano
Center Strip
After dark, this active “volcano” erupts every 15 minutes, spewing fire 100
feet above the lagoons below. Formerly a bit of a fizzling dud, an extremely
expensive overhaul seeks to make the volcano as much of a must-see
attraction as the Bellagio fountains. Actual fireballs will be shot out in
rhythm to a percussion soundtrack by Grateful Dead drummer Mickey
Hart. Get there at least 10 minutes before the spewing starts for the best
vantage point near the main driveway entrance.
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3400 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in front of The Mirage). % 702-
791-7111. Admission: Free. Open: Dusk to midnight. Eruptions take place every 15 min.
The Secret Garden of Siegfried & Roy/The Mirage Dolphin Habitat
Center Strip
The Secret Garden is a small zoo where rare lions, tigers, leopards, and
the like from Siegfried and Roy’s show are exhibited while they aren’t at
home with S & R (yes, they really do live with the boys). Guests get ear-
phones so that they can listen to prerecorded facts and fun tidbits about
the animals. Obviously, the exhibit has had a bit of an unintentional sub-
text for some time, thanks to Roy’s stage accident. But don’t forget: He
himself loves these cats and critters, and this exhibit has always been
about respect for the animals. The Dolphin Habitat allows you to play
“catch” with and learn about our flippered friends. Playing ball with the
dolphins is a thrill; see if singing the theme song to Flipper makes them
toss it to you more often. Allow at least an hour, but you can stay as long
as you like. If you’re like me, it may be quite a while indeed.
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3400 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (behind The Mirage). % 702-791-
7111. Admission: $15 adults, $10 children 4–10, children under 4 free. Open: Daily,
from Memorial Day to Labor Day 10 a.m.–7 p.m.; Labor Day to Memorial Day 11
a.m.–5:30 p.m., Sat–Sun during the fall and winter, and 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Hours sub-
ject to change.
SPEED – The Ride; Las Vegas Cyber Speedway
North Strip
This wild, 8-minute motion-simulator ride puts you in replicas of NASCAR-
style racers (three-fourths the size of the real cars) and lets you careen
through the Las Vegas Motor Speedway or around (and even inside —
whoops, there went the Forum Shops) the hotels on the Strip and down-
town. The realistic details — down to the wind in your hair and the
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
204

required pit stops if you crash — are impressive. SPEED – The Ride is a
wild roller coaster that blasts you through loops and dips, and even the
marquee of the hotel, before you go up a tower and then do the whole
thing backwards.
2535 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Sahara Hotel & Casino). % 702-737-2111. Admission:
Cyber Speedway (simulator) $10; $6 per re-ride (you must be at least 54 in. tall to
ride,); SPEED – The Ride (roller coaster) $10 for single ride; $13 for all day pass on
SPEED only. Sun–Thurs 11 a.m.–midnight; Fri–Sat 11 a.m.–1 a.m.; hours may vary.

If you think that confronting your fears is the best way of dealing with them,
come test your vertigo here. You can get a spectacular view of Vegas and
the surrounding landscape from the indoor and outdoor observation decks
of this 110-story tower. Adrenaline junkies (or the certifiably insane) can
try the Big Shot, an open car that rockets up 160 feet to the tip of the tower
before dropping back down in a bungee effect. It’s only for the truly adven-
turous. Or, if that thrill isn’t quite thrilling enough, you have the X-Scream,
a giant teeter-totter style device that shoots you off the edge of the tower
in a floorless, sideless car at about 30 miles per hour. Yikes. Still not scared?
Try the aptly named Insanity: The Ride, a whirly-gig-style spinner that
sends you in circles as you look almost straight down. Insanity, indeed.
Note: The rides are shut down on windy days. Thank goodness.
See maps p. 197 and 203. 2000 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in Stratosphere Las Vegas). 
% 702-380-7777. Admission: $ 10 per ride plus $12 for adults, $8 for children to
ascend the Tower (if you dine in the buffet room or Top of the World, there’s no charge
to go up to the Tower). Multiride and all-day packages also available for varying costs.
Hours vary seasonally, but rides are usually open Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–midnight;
Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–1 a.m. Minimum height requirement for Big Shot is 48 in., minimum
height requirement for X-Scream and Insanity are 52 in.
Titanic: The Exhibition 
South Strip
The Titanic may be gone, but it’s hardly forgotten. Actually, given the
number of salvage operations that journey down to the wreck, it’s not even
all that gone. This exhibition neatly and cleverly educates visitors on the
significance of the movie-inspiring 1912 disaster via informative displays,
recreations of sample cabins from first through third class, and relics taken
from the wreck. A disaster that claimed the lives of over 1500 is not pre-
cisely the kind of cheery subject with which one looks to occupy one’s
mind while visiting a happy-go-lucky town, but then again it has been
enshrined in the cultural imagination as a blockbuster romance. 
3900 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Luxor). No prices or hours available at press time. 
Chapter 12: Discovering Las Vegas’s Best Attractions 205

Treasure Island Sirens of TI
Center Strip
Another victim of the “Vegas is for adults, and we mean it, dammit” wave
was the popular pirate stunt show. Oh, there are still pirates, and they still
do stunts, but now they “battle,” instead of the British, a bunch of scant-
ily clad damsels who try to — oh, why are we acting like “plot” is a vital
component of this attraction? It’s all about the lingere, and that tells you
everything you need to know. It’s junky and awful, but there are bosoms on
those bosoms, so there you go. And indeed, there you may go, but don’t
take those kids who loved “Pirates of the Caribbean” with you.
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3300 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in front of Treasure Island). % 702-
894-7111. Admission: Free. Open: Shows nightly at 7, 8:30, 10, and 11:30 p.m.
Finding Fun for the Younger Set
For a New York minute, Vegas tried to position itself as a suitable family
destination — this despite being a town built around gambling, drinking,
and sex. While these are all fine pursuits if you are over the magical age
of 21, for the underage crowd, the Strip is something of a drag. The great
“Vegas Is Really for Families” marketing campaign failed precisely
because gambling, drinking, and sex are more profitable than thrill-park
rides and kiddie shows. Nevertheless, the city recognizes that you may
have occasion to bring children to town, so we include some entertain-
ment options for the little rugrats, in addition to those marked with a
Kid Friendly icon earlier in this chapter.
Vegas for kids
Circus Circus Midway
North Strip
Another solid, time-tested bet. Back in the pre–”Vegas Is for Families” days,
this was about the only option for kids. Your kids will enjoy carnival games
(complete with prizes) and arcade games. While they are having fun, they
can catch circus acts — trapeze artists, stunt cyclists, jugglers, magicians,
and acrobats — that perform continuously under the big top Sunday
through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 11
a.m. to midnight.
See maps p. 197 and 203. 2880 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in Circus Circus). % 702-734-0410.
Admission: Free; game prices vary. Open: Daily, 24 hr.
Ethel M Chocolates/M&M’s World
South Strip
This is a shrine devoted to the four basic food groups: milk chocolate, dark
chocolate, white chocolate, and chocolate truffles. This four-story retail
and exhibit space, brought to you by the company that makes M&Ms,
Milky Way, and Snickers, is more gift shop than museum; but it’s still fun

to wander around — plus they give free samples! All those people holding
their stomachs as they exit? That’s a good sign. (Actually, the samples are
usually small. Meanies.) Check out the little film/show that runs every half-
hour; it’s quite cute and clever. The fastest way to get to Henderson for
the factory is to take the Strip south to Sunset Road, about a mile past the
last of the big hotels. Turn left, and it’s a straight shot across to Mountain
Vista. There you find the chocolate factory, which offers free tours and has
a surprisingly attractive 21⁄2-acre Botanical Cactus Garden featuring rare
and exotic succulents, providing a serene escape from the clang of slots.
See maps p. 197 and 199. In the Showcase Mall, 3875 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (just north of
the MGM Grand Hotel). % 702-736-7611. Open: Sun–Thurs 9 a.m.–11 a.m., Fri–Sat

Las Vegas Mini Grand Prix
Off the Beaten Path
Even though we insist that Vegas really isn’t for families, citing a lack of
affordable G-rated activities, we have to admit that this place is sure to
make kids happy. It’s got everything they need to work off all that nervous
energy, from go-kart tracks requiring different skill levels to a mini-roller-
coaster to a well-stocked arcade with decent quality prizes. The staff is
friendly, and the cafe serves pizzas bigger and cheaper than any in your
hotel. The one drawback: It’s far away from main Strip action; here’s where
you need that rental car, for sure. Note: Kids have to be at least 36 inches
tall to ride any of the attractions.
See map p. 197. 1401 N. Rainbow Rd., just off US 95 N. % 702-259-7000. www.lvmgp.

on all ride and at any time. Open: Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–10 p.m., Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–11 p.m.
Masquerade Village Show in the Sky
Center Strip
Spend enough time in a casino, and you may swear you see Mardi Gras
parades floating in the sky. Oh, wait, it’s the Rio’s free carnival-themed
extravaganza! Giant floats filled with “performers” travel on tracks in the
ceiling two stories above the floor. Parental warning; this is meant to
invoke blissful visions of the naughty Brazil Mardi Gras and so there are
some moments (including a sequence that takes place on a bed) that are
probably closer to PG-13 than one might feel comfortable. It’s meant to be
risque, is what we are saying, and if it’s more silly than anything else, well,
you still may not want to have to explain it to Junior. Luckily, the shows are
in the evening now, a more adult timeline. 
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3700 W. Flamingo Rd. (in the Rio Hotel & Casino, just west
of I-15). % 702-777-7777. Admission: Free to view, $9.95 to ride in a float. Open:

208
Michael Goudeau’s top ten favorite 
things to see or do in Vegas
Comedian/Juggler/Writer Michael Goudeau is the long time support act for magician
Lance Burton and is also an Emmy-nominated writer-producer for Penn & Teller’s
Showtime series Bullshit!
10: Eat. Our food is good. We FINALLY have some great restaurants. It was pretty bad
for a long time. In fact the local newspaper’s “Best of Vegas” poll put “7-11” as the
best coffee for seven years in a row. Ick. Those years are now behind us. Hallelujah.
9: Drive through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area and look at the amaz-
ing sandstone cliffs. Marvel at how great it is that people climb them. Open your
window and feel the 115-degree heat. Now close the window, drive to Powerhouse
Rock Gym, and “rock climb” indoors where its air conditioned.
8: Go see Penn and Teller at the Rio. They shoot bullets at each other and catch them
in their mouths. No kidding. You could be there the night they miss. Ask yourself this
question, “Do I want to hear that Penn and Teller shot each other or do I want to say
I was there?” That’s what I thought.
7: There’s nothing better than driving around in a convertible at midnight when its 95
degrees outside. Rent one and take your sweetie for a drive. As a bonus, if you drive
out into the desert you can usually see a few “falling stars” on a warm summer night.
If that doesn’t earn you a kiss, you should get a new sweetie.
6: Eight times per week you can see grown men stuff their faces with many more
marshmallows than you think possible. They also happen to be bald and blue. See Blue
Man Group at Venetian.
5: There are penny slot machines everywhere these days. You really can lose every last
cent. I’m still waiting for a slot machine that will take your shoes. When they make
one, it will be downtown.
4: Go to any boat dock on Lake Mead and throw in a handful of bread. A hundred huge
sucking carp will rise up from the murky depths writhing and wrestling to gulp down
your crumbs. Some people will be horrified, and this will haunt their dreams forever.
Most people will say “Ewwwww” and laugh and try to push their friends in. For added
fun smush up a bunch of white bread into the shape of some ex-partner and toss it to the
marauding hoard. Lean down and pat them on their fishy heads as they finish the deed.
Go wash your hands before you get back into the car. Ah, never mind, it’s a rental. For
the double-bonus fun points make sound effects for your voodoo bread doll as it’s eaten.
3: If you want to continue the fish theme, go see Mac King’s afternoon show at
Harrah’s. You see Mac do funny things with a goldfish. He’s also got a cloak of invisi-
bility. This show is darned inexpensive and darned funny. This is the only thing on the
list that I insist you do.
2: Our Wal-Marts are open 24/7. If you need a smiley face bean bag chair at 3 a.m.,
you can get one.

Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay
South Strip
Kids love fish. Kids love this big giant aquarium. We think it’s too small;
but it is prettily designed and educational, and sharks swim overhead in
glass tunnels. It’s so much better than letting kids watch TV.
See maps p. 197 and 199. In Mandalay Bay, 3950 Las Vegas Blvd. S. % 702-632-7000.
Admission: $16 adults, $11 children 5–12, free for children under 5. Open: Daily 10
a.m.–11 p.m.
Southern Nevada Zoological and Botanical Park
Off the Beaten Path
Although this zoo is on the smallish side, it boasts more than 150 species
from around the world, plus a petting zoo for younger kids. Do remember
that it can get quite hot in the desert; if the animals are sleeping in the
shade when you come by, that’s just because they are smart and don’t go
out in the noonday sun. Try to time a visit for early-morning or late-after-
noon hours (when it’s cooler) to see the most activity.
See map p. 197. 1775 N. Rancho Dr. % 702-647-4685. www.lasvegaszoo.org. To
get there, take Charleston west from the Strip to Rancho Drive and turn right. It’s up
about 21⁄2 miles on your left. Admission: $8 for adults and $6 for seniors and kids 2–12.
Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Vegas for teens
If Vegas is frustrating for kids, it’s even more frustrating for teens, who
can see the promised land in the form of slot machines glistening in the
distance (or, more accurately, at their elbow), tantalizing them, but
remaining untouchable for a few more years. If they even slow down (as
they pass through the casino to the outside world) to gawk when some-
one hits a jackpot, security guards show up to hustle them along. Plus,
Vegas has a curfew law: Local ordinances forbid anyone under 18 from
being on the Strip without a parent after 9 p.m. — for many teens (at
least the ones we know), a chilling prospect.
What to do? Well, outside the curfew hours, you can send them off on
the thrill rides listed earlier in this chapter, to the video arcades listed
above, or to your hotel pool. And there is always shopping (see Chap-
ter 13). Following is a place that caters to the teen scene.
Chapter 12: Discovering Las Vegas’s Best Attractions 209
1: You could go see the Lance Burton Show at the Monte Carlo Hotel. Yeah, there’s a
great magician in the show, but you really should see that juggler. So what if it’s me?
Cut me some slack; I wrote the list. If you got kisses for driving out in the desert in a
convertible you owe me. Come on, I’ll even do some tricks and stuff.

GameWorks
South Strip
This 47,000-square-foot facility boasts the latest interactive video games
(some of them designed by Steven Spielberg’s Dreamworks company),
motion-simulator rides, plus a giant rock-climbing wall, and such mundane
games as air hockey and pool. This is more adult arcade fun, often too
sophisticated for those under ten — or at least, without parents to hover
over and help, which takes precious time away from all the big fun said
parents could be having themselves. It’s also the perfect place for your
teens to get their ya-yas out.
See maps p. 197 and 199. 3785 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (located in the Showcase Mall just
north of the MGM Grand Hotel/Casino). % 702-432-GAME. www.gameworks.com.
Open: Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–midnight, Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–2 a.m. Hours may vary.
Going to the Chapel: Vegas Weddings
Birds do it, bees do it, and as we know, Brittany and What’s-His-Name-
The-First-Husband sure did it — got married in Vegas, that is. (Okay,
birds and bees don’t bother with ceremonies, but it worked as a line, all
right?) And you can, too, with tremendous ease, as the unfortunate
Spears/What’s-His-Name union demonstrated. We profoundly hope that
you put more thought into this step than they did, but regardless, this is
a most accommodating town for impulsive lovers. All you need is a
license, a couple of minutes, and someone to recite vows with you. More
than 100,000 weddings are performed in Las Vegas annually. The two
busiest days are Valentine’s Day (some chapels perform more than 80
services in one day) and New Year’s Eve.
Many of the major hotels have wedding chapels and services, but the
bulk of the independent places are located between the Strip and down-
town on Las Vegas Boulevard. In the following listings, we describe a few
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
210
Video arcades to keep the kids busy
Also of note are the video-game arcades in the New York-New York and Excalibur
hotels. All are large and feature lots of high- (and low-) tech diversions for the kids.
New York-New York’s arcade, in particular, is nicely done, modeled more or less on
Coney Island, with plenty of nonvideo arcade games.
Many of the video- and carnival-game arcades offer tickets to winners of certain
games. These tickets can be redeemed for merchandise. Now this may just be a ploy
to get the little tykes introduced to the idea of gambling at an early age. But one would
hope that your kids will learn pretty quickly that spending $10 on Skee-Ball just to win
a stuffed animal worth a buck doesn’t make much sense. (On the other hand, those
stuffed animals can be pretty cute.)

of our favorite wedding venues, but remember that you have many to
choose from. Just cruise the chapels and pick the one that appeals to you
the most. Note that fees vary depending on what kind of ceremony you
opt for, so call the chapel ahead of time for prices. Even if you’re not get-
ting married, you may be able to watch other couples tie the knot. Just
ask. You can decide for yourself whether a $100, 15-minute wedding is as
likely to last as that $50,000 ceremony with badly dressed bridesmaids.
If you want to find out more about getting hitched in Vegas, make a call
to Las Vegas Weddings and Rooms (% 800-488-MATE), or surf over to
the Wedding Dreams Web site at www.weddingdreams.com.
Clark County Marriage License Bureau
Downtown
Your first stop on your way to marital bliss has to be at the courthouse to
visit the Clark County Marriage License Bureau. All that’s required is for
both of you to be there and for one of you to have $55. That’s it — not even
a blood test.
See map p. 211. 201 Clark Ave. % 702-455-4415. Open: Daily including weekends and
holidays 8 a.m.–midnight.
Cupid’s Wedding Chapel
North Strip
This chapel offers a pretty simple and straightforward setting. It’s the staff
that sets this place apart; they provide genuine warmth and an infectious
sense of romance. (It’s probably not their fault that Axl Rose’s marriage,
which began here, lasted but a few turbulent months.)
See map p. 211. 827 Las Vegas Blvd. S. % 800-543-2933. www.cupidswedding.
com. Open: Weddings by appointment only, hours vary.
Little White Wedding Chapel
North Strip
Probably the most prominent of the chapels on the Strip, not least because
of that big sign proudly announcing that Michael Jordan and Joan Collins
were married here (though not to each other!). They probably like to
downplay the fact that Britney got married here as well — just goes to
show you how very very easy it is to get married in Vegas, and how ill-
advised that can be. It’s especially easy to get hitched here, between their
24/7 operating hours and their famous drive-through window. Certainly
the first choice if your idea of romance is heavy on the classic kitsch.

A Special Memory Wedding Chapel
Off the Beaten Path
Here you find a more traditional style, with somewhat less of a Vegas
approach to weddings. It’s a clean, modern new building, complete with a
churchlike steeple and a demi-shopping arcade for flowers, tuxes, and the
like. If you’re in a hurry, you can even use their drive-up window! (So much
for it not being too Vegas.)
See map p. 211. 800 S. Fourth St. at Gass Ave. % 800-9-MARRYU. www.aspecial

Fri–Sat 8 a.m.–midnight.
If You’re Sick of Neon
Just about everything in Las Vegas has some neon on it — even the 7-
Eleven and the airport parking garages. If it all gets to be a little much
for you, there are places you can go that don’t involve bright lights,
marble, and concrete.
The University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV)
Paradise Road
Yes, it has concrete, but it also has lots of beautifully landscaped paths
meandering through the campus. It’s basically an arboretum with a wide
array of plants, trees, and flowers, all of which are drought-resistant.
Strolling through here is a beautiful and relaxing distraction — although,
on hot days, it can be a sweaty one.
4505 Maryland Pkwy. % 800-334-UNLV. www.unlv.edu. Located between Paradise
Rd. and Maryland Pkwy., just east of the Strip and just north of Tropicana Ave.
Marjorie Barrick Museum (formerly Natural History Museum)
Paradise Road
This attractive, if simplistic, display of Native American craftwork and Las
Vegas history is conveniently located on the grounds of UNLV. It’s more of
a small-town than big-city museum, but it’s free. It has snakes in glass
cages and air-conditioning.
See map p. 197. At UNLV, located between Paradise Rd. and Maryland Pkwy., just
east of the Strip and just north of Tropicana Ave. % 702-895-3381. Admission: Free.
Open Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–4:45 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–2 p.m.
Lorenzi Park
Off the Beaten Path
If you want to ditch the glitz and enjoy a lake, playgrounds, jogging paths,
and acres of grassy lawns and lush gardens, Lorenzi Park is the place for
you. This, the largest park in Las Vegas, is located just west of Rancho
Drive, northwest of the Strip.
Chapter 12: Discovering Las Vegas’s Best Attractions 213

Washington St. Take Charleston Blvd. west from the Strip, turn right on Rancho Dr.,
and then travel about 2 miles to Washington St. and turn left. You see the park on
your left in a few short blocks.
Sunset Park
Off the Beaten Path
This is another enjoyable park, if you don’t mind a little airport noise (it’s
located just south of McCarran International Airport). It offers jogging
paths, a swimming pool, tennis and volleyball courts, playgrounds, a lake,
and lots of real plants to make up for the fake ones inside most casinos.
Corner of Eastern and Sunset Rd. Head south on the Strip to Sunset Rd., and then
turn left and go a couple of miles to Eastern. The park is on the southeast corner.
Clark County Heritage Museum
Off the Beaten Path
Here you can go through 12,000 years of local history, including exhibits
on Native American tribes, pioneer settlements, the gold-rush era, and the
dawn of gambling (with old slot machines and a life-size statue of Bugsy
Siegel). The 25-acre facility also has an authentic ghost town and several
houses from the early to mid-1900s that have been fully restored with
period furnishings.
See map p. 197. 1830 S. Boulder Hwy. Take Tropicana Ave. east to Boulder Hwy. and
turn right. It’s down about 8 miles on your left. % 702-455-7955. Admission: $1.50 for
adults and $1 for seniors and kids 3–15. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Las Vegas Art Museum
Off the Beaten Path
Hey, more art! Art that’s not in a hotel, but in a lovely facility built just for
art! The museum’s emphasis is on special shows and exhibitions rather
than a permanent collection. As we write this, the museum is showing an
exhibtion of privately held collections of contemporary art, including all-
stars such as Warhol, Hirst, Hockney, and Basquiat. Upcoming plans
include shows by Robert Smithson and Tom Schiff.
See map p. 197. 9600 W. Sahara, 5 miles west of the Strip on Sahara Ave. in a big
white building. % 702-360-8000. www.lasvegasartmuseum.org. Admission: $6
for adults, $5 for seniors, and $3 for students; children under 12 free. Open: Tues–Sat
10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m.
Las Vegas Natural History Museum
North Strip
Not to be confused with the snakes ’n’ stuff over at the UNLV Natural
History Museum, this museum has exhibits of (stuffed) bears, elk, and the
like, plus a few roaring dinosaurs. There’s also a hands-on activity room
that is great for kids, and a gift shop for you. In truth, the exhibits are a bit
moldy and creaky, but there’s not a speck of neon anywhere in sight.

See map p. 197. 900 Las Vegas Blvd. N. It’s a couple of miles north of downtown. 
% 702-384-3466. www.lvnhm.org. Admission: $8 for adults; $7 for seniors, stu-
dents, and military personnel; and $4 for children 3–11. Open: Daily, 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Springs Preserve
Off the Beaten Path
This is an absolute jewel of a facility, designed to educate visitors about
the environmental impact of Sin City (in summation: huge). Sure, you come
to Vegas for fantasy, not for a lecture on grim reality; but the attitude here
is anything but scolding. Plus, they put their money where their mouth is.
With the exception of the interpretative center, all the buildings were con-
structed with the least amount of environmental impact possible, using
green techniques. Exhibits range from a simulation of a flash flood to child-
geared instruction on the fun of recycling, including a compost tunnel to
crawl through. The gardens demonstrate environmentally friendly garden-
ing, with an emphasis on the possibilities for the elderly and physically dis-
abled. All of this is set amidst nature and hiking trails. Even the playground
is made of recycled materials. Plenty to do and even more to learn —
maybe it will make you think twice before asking for a daily sheet change
in your hotel room. 
See map p. 197. 3333 S. Valley View Blvd. % 702-822-8344. www.springspreserve.

If You Just Can’t Get Enough Neon
Face it, no matter how hard you try, it’s hard to avoid neon in Las Vegas.
The stuff is so much a part of the city that it should not come as a sur-
prise that Vegas authorities have moved to preserve some of the city’s
neon treasures.
The Neon Museum
Downtown
This terrific museum is helping to preserve a piece of Vegas history by res-
cuing classic neon signs, restoring them, and putting them on public dis-
play. Given how fast bits of Las Vegas get tossed into the wastebasket of
memory, this project is a most worthy one. After all, these signs are what
originally gave Vegas its unique look. They deserve better, and it’s nice to
know that some are getting it. At the end of the Fremont Street Experience
(described earlier in this chapter), you find the horse and rider from the
Hacienda Hotel, the genie’s lamp from the Aladdin Hotel, the Anderson
Dairy Milkman, and the Chief Motel Motorcourt sign, among others
prominently displayed. Plans are in the works to construct an indoor facil-
ity to house smaller signs that the museum has in its collection.
See map p. 197. Located at Fremont St. and Las Vegas Blvd. % 702-229-4872. www.
neonmuseum.org. Free admission.

If You Want to See Neon from 
a Great Vantage Point
Eiffel Tower Tour
Center Strip
We love Paris in the springtime, but we can’t always make it there, so it’s
nice — or really hokey — that Paris Las Vegas has provided us with a half-
scale replica of the City of Lights’ famous Eiffel Tower. The “tour” consists
of a few factoids about this tower and its more famous Parisian sister given
in the 90 seconds or so it takes for the elevator to zoom to the observation
platform. You can get a nice view from up there, though.
See maps p. 197 and 200. 3655 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (at Paris Las Vegas). % 702-946-7000.
Admission: Daily $10 for adults, $7 for seniors over 65. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–midnight.
Vegas for the Sports-Minded
For many years, recreation in Las Vegas meant lying by the pool, and
exercise came in the form of pulling handles on slot machines. But when
The Mirage opened in the late 1980s, it signaled a change in attitude that
would revolutionize the way visitors spent their time. This major resort
was the first in town to offer such an unprecedented array of sporting
and exercise alternatives. Sure, there were other hotels in town that had
golf courses and health clubs, but nobody did it quite the way The
Mirage did. Virtually every major hotel built since then has tried to imi-
tate The Mirage’s success. Odds are that your own hotel will have a huge
array of options and probably even a full-fledged spa.
Biking
Whether you’re a biking fanatic or just want to take a gentle cruise
through the city or outlying areas, Vegas has plenty to offer. Just be care-
ful of the traffic; many Vegas drivers are tourists who may be less famil-
iar with the roadways.
Las Vegas Cyclery
Escape the City Streets is a rental company that offers a variety of street
and mountain bikes for your riding pleasure. They even drop your bike off
for you at any downtown or Strip hotel or pick you up to take you on a
guided tour.
Consider taking a trip out to Red Rock Canyon using Charleston Boulevard.
There’s a nice wide bike lane starting at Rainbow Lane (in the western part
of town) that runs all the way to the canyon’s visitor center, about 11 chal-
lenging but not impossible miles in total. If you’re in really good shape,
you may consider a bike tour of the canyon. Contact the Red Rock Canyon
Visitors Center (% 702-363-1921), or ask the bike rental agent for other
options.
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas

8221 W. Charleston Blvd. % 702-838-6966. www.lasvegascyclery.com. Rates
vary, starting at $55 for the first day, $45 for a half day or the following whole con-
secutive days, and $225 for a week (major credit card required).
Bowling
Bowlers can find a few good spots to knock down some pins, if the
mood, um, strikes. Here’s a favorite recommendation:
Orleans
Off the Beaten Path
Orleans has a great 70-lane facility. It’s on the second floor of the hotel,
which you see on your right as you travel west from the Strip on Tropicana
Avenue.
4500 W. Tropicana Ave. % 702-365-7411. Fees: $2.90 per game ($1 from midnight–8
a.m.); $2.25 shoe rental. Open: Daily 24 hr.
Golfing
Las Vegas is a favorite destination for the PGA’s annual tour, so it makes
sense that the city has dozens of great golf courses for you to try.
If you’re an avid golfer and intend to play the links in Las Vegas, consider
bringing your own clubs. We know of more than one golfer who didn’t
want to haul his equipment halfway across the country but was horrified
at the outrageous rental fees at the local courses.
Angel Park Golf Club
Off the Beaten Path
One notable course is the Angel Park Golf Club, which has a 36-hole, par-
70/71 public course that was designed by Arnold Palmer. Pretty spiffy, in
our humble opinion.
100 S. Rampart Blvd. To get there, take the Strip to Charleston Blvd. and travel west
about 10 miles; then turn right on Rampart. % 888-629-3929. www.angelpark.com.
Greens fees: $75–$155. Open: Hours vary; call for times.
Las Vegas National Golf Club
Paradise Road
Another exceptional course is located at the Las Vegas National Golf Club,
which was formerly part of the Las Vegas Hilton Country Club (and before
that affiliated with The Stardust way back in the day). You can find their 18-
hole, par-71 public course just past Paradise Road on your left.
1911 Desert Inn Rd. % 702-794-1796. Greens fees: $60–$179. Open: Daily; hours vary.
Chapter 12: Discovering Las Vegas’s Best Attractions 217

Health Clubs
Just about every hotel in town has a health club/spa, so you can proba-
bly find a place to work out without a problem. We especially like the
outstanding facilities at The Mirage, Bellagio, the Golden Nugget, and
Caesars Palace, which features a rock-climbing wall and Zen meditation
garden.
Canyon Ranch Spa
Center Strip
This is an outpost of what is generally considered the finest spa in
America. But it’s so costly that we have trouble even typing in the num-
bers. For sheer physical beauty (and we’re not even talking about the clien-
tele) and the vast number of exotic services offered (like Subtle Energy
Therapies that use Reiki healing methods), this place has no equal in town.
However, the prices are virtually prohibitive. A day pass (which just covers
use of the fitness center, steam room, whirlpool, sauna, and locker rooms)
will set you back $35, and a 50-minute facial will run you $160.
3355 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Venetian). % 877-220-2688 (toll-free) or 702-414-3600.
www.canyonranch.com. Admission: Spa packages available. Hours: Daily 5:30
a.m.–10 p.m.
Harrah’s Las Vegas Health Club
Center Strip
If your hotel doesn’t offer what you want, you can check out the health
club at Harrah’s Las Vegas, which is one of the few hotel facilities that is
open to the general public. Don’t miss the virtual-reality cycles and stair
climbers that allow you to steer through various courses (island, snow-
scape, and more). They even simulate the wind blowing through your hair
and have soundtracks accompanying the on-screen action. They’re per-
fect distractions for people who hate to exercise, or at least need some-
thing to keep their minds off the pain.
3475 Las Vegas Blvd. S. % 702-369-5000. Fees: $20. Hours: Daily 6 a.m.–8 p.m.
Tennis
You can find places to play at only a couple of hotels:
Bally’s Las Vegas
Center Strip
The hotel has eight lighted hard courts that are available to both guests
and nonguests. The pro shop can help if you leave any equipment at home.
3645 Las Vegas Blvd. S. % 702-967-3380. Fees: $15 guests of all Bally’s hotels, $20
nonguests. Hours vary; call ahead. Reservations highly recommended.
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
218

Flamingo
Center Strip
The hotel has four outdoor hard courts (all are lit for night play) available
to the public. Lessons are available.
3555 Las Vegas Blvd. S. % 702-733-3444. Fees: $15 guests, $20 nonguests. Hours
vary; call ahead. Reservations required.
Vegas for the Sports Spectator
Las Vegas has no major-league sporting teams, so most of the local action
comes from the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV). The main campus
is located just off Paradise Road between Tropicana Avenue and Flamingo
Road. If you just have to get a football or basketball fix, there may be a
game playing at the Thomas and Mack Center (% 702-895-3900) on
campus. This 18,500-seat facility hosts the college teams and a variety of
boxing tournaments, NBA exhibition games, and rodeos.
Caesars Palace (% 888-702-3544) and the MGM Grand’s Garden
Events Arena (% 800-929-1111) host major sporting events year-round,
including gymnastics, figure skating, and boxing. Remember the bite that
Mike Tyson took out of Evander Holyfield’s ear in 1997? That happened
at the MGM — how proud they must be.
Las Vegas Motor Speedway
Off the Beaten Path
The Las Vegas Motor Speedway is a 176,000-seat, $200-million state-of-the-
art motor-sports entertainment complex. Its 1.5-mile oval hosts Indy and
NASCAR events, a road course, a drag strip, and a motocross course.
7000 Las Vegas Blvd. N. % 702-644-4443. www.lvms.com. Admission: Ticket prices
vary wildly, so call ahead to find out what’s happening and how much it costs. Open:
Hours vary. If you’re driving, take I-15 north to the Speedway exit (#54) and follow
the signs.
Las Vegas Invitational Golf Tournament
The Las Vegas Invitational, a major stop on the PGA tour, is held every
October on several local courses. For details, call % 702-242-3000.
National Finals Rodeo
Every December, Las Vegas hosts the National Finals Rodeo, considered
to be the “Super Bowl of rodeos.” Nearly 200,000 people attend the two-
week event, which is held at the Thomas and Mack Center on the UNLV
campus.
Tropicana Ave. and Swenson St. (located in the Thomas and Mack Center on the
UNLV campus). % 702-895-3900. www.nfrexperience.com. Everything sells out
quickly, so call as far in advance as possible.
Chapter 12: Discovering Las Vegas’s Best Attractions 219

Vegas by Sightseeing Tour
There are few organized sightseeing tours in Vegas, but those here are
very reasonably priced. Also, a good tour guide can fill you in on enter-
taining and historical tidbits that you won’t get wandering around by
yourself.
Gray Line Tours
The most reputable company around offers a variety of interesting tours,
including a 51⁄2-hour journey around town that includes the Strip, Fremont
Street, and a visit to The Clark County Heritage Museum.
795 E. Tropicana. % 702-735-4947. www.grayline.com. Admission: The all-inclusive
price is $35 for adults and children.
Char Cruze’s Creative Adventures
For something really special, get a personalized tour from Char Cruze and
her Creative Adventures tour company. Char is a fourth-generation Las
Vegas native (yeah, people really do raise families here); and if there’s a
story she hasn’t heard, it’s not worth repeating. She also does marvelous
tours of Red Rock Canyon, Hoover Dam, and other noncity sights. She
charges a flat fee that’s more than the others listed, but her tour is quite
a bit more personal; she can tailor any tour to your specifications and
interests. And the more people you have in your group, the more cost-
effective it is. It’s terrific for families and highly recommended in general.
Earthmark Studio of the Arts, P.O. Box 94043, Las Vegas, NV 89193. % 702-893-2051.
www.creativeadventuretours.net. Admission: Prices vary according to size
of group and method of transportation. Tours start at $150 per day, per family.

W
ay back in the good ol’ days, when hotel boutiques carried mer-
chandise that could charitably be described as taste-free, Vegas
was no shopping mecca. If you’re a penny pincher, it still isn’t. But as the
luxury hotels have risen (and gotten better at extracting your cash at
every opportunity), the shopping has escalated — in both price and
quality — to the level of that found in Beverly Hills and Manhattan.
Which isn’t to say that you won’t find plenty of dubious items still avail-
able for purchase; you will, in spades. From campy souvenir shops to
ritzy designer boutiques, die-hard shoppers can find plenty of places to
empty their wallets. This chapter takes a look at the basics, the bar-
gains, and the bizarre shopping options.
Shopping, Vegas Style
Naturally, this being Las Vegas and all, the show must go on; ordinary
malls aren’t enough to lure jaded shoppers. Theme malls proliferate —
you can window-shop on the Appian Way or sail past stores along the
Grand Canal — and many of these malls include shows and rides
designed to amuse people as they spend any cash the casinos may have
missed. You can find some smaller places where you can drop a few (or
considerably more) dollars; but for the most part, like the hotels here,
the megajoints rule.
Dedicated fashionistas will want to note that the best of the new
season’s offerings are found mid-September and mid-March, while the
best sales occur from mid-July to the end of August and mid-December
to the end of February. We’re talking 50 to 70 percent off the most lus-
cious of designer goods! Happy hunting!

Chapter 13: Shopping the Local Stores 223

If you do decide to splurge here, don’t forget to factor in a 7.5 percent
sales tax to the price of whatever you buy.
Do keep in mind that, just like pricing for hotels and restaurants, shop-
ping is more expensive on the Strip. If you’re more intent on serious bar-
gain hunting than fun browsing, head elsewhere.
The Malls: Tried and True
Just across the street from Treasure Island is the Fashion Show Mall
(3200 Las Vegas Blvd. S; % 702-369-0704; www.thefashionshow.com),
which has been remodeled to make it look, on the outside at least, like
an “attraction.” (How else to explain those giant LED video screens and
that enormous flying saucer-shaped thingie on the roof?) The Fashion
Show Mall boasts more than 250 shops, restaurants, and services,
including Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth
Avenue, Macy’s, Abercrombie & Fitch, and The Sharper Image, plus
your usual mall denizens, such as Gap, The Body Shop, and Victoria’s
Secret. If your Caddy is looking a little dull, you can even arrange to have
your car washed while you shop. Free self- and valet parking is available,
and the mall is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
For a more traditional shopping experience, head over to the Boulevard
Mall (3528 S. Maryland Parkway; % 702-732-8949; www.blvdmall.com).
It has 150-plus stores geared to the average traveler. Anchors here
include Sears, JCPenney, and Marshalls. Its wide variety of shops offers
moderately priced shoes and clothing for the entire family, books, gifts,
jewelry, and home furnishings, plus more than a dozen fast-food eater-
ies. To get there, take any of the major east-west streets (Flamingo,
Tropicana, or Sahara) to Maryland Parkway, which is about 2 miles
east of the Strip. The mall is located just south of Desert Inn Road and
north of Flamingo. Hours are Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to
9 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Outlet Malls: Bargain City
Americans’ love for factory-outlet malls has not gone unrequited in Las
Vegas. At many of these stores, you can get slightly (sometimes imper-
ceptibly) flawed or overstocked merchandise for up to 75 percent off
retail prices. Of course, by the time it gets to the outlet, the stuff is often
no longer first-run; but at these prices, who cares?
Before you buy something in a regular mall in Las Vegas, ask the sales
staff if the store has a local outlet. You can save big bucks by exploring
this alternative.
Las Vegas Premium Outlets (875 Grand Central Parkway; % 702-474-
7500; www.premiumoutlets.com) can be disappointing. It looks sharp
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
224

enough, but it’s a structure that is entirely outdoors. We don’t know
about you, but when it’s 110 degrees out, we’re simply not interested in
buying leather — or anything other than water and ice cream. The shops
are an adequate range (call to see who is there currently, but when we
last went in, Adidas, Nike, Coach, Calvin Klein, Armani, Perry Ellis,
and Kenneth Cole all had stores here) but too many had too much mer-
chandise at essentially full price. It’s open Monday through Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Having said that, the indoor Las Vegas Outlet Center (7400 Las Vegas
Blvd. S.; % 702-896-5599; www.premiumoutlets.com) is a bargain
hunter’s dream. Housed in a friendly and spacious mall-like setting are
130 outlets, including Tommy Hilfiger, Levi’s, Nike, Reebok, Zales
Diamonds, Bose, and Waterford Crystal. You can even find entertain-
ment for kids (or bored spouses) in the form of a giant indoor carousel.
It’s open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
You can get to this mall by heading south on the Strip. It is located a few
miles past the southernmost major hotel, Mandalay Bay.
The Hotel Shops: From Trinkets to Toys
Just about all the big hotels offer some shopping opportunities, ranging
from fancy clothing emporiums to gift shops. Avoid these latter places
like the plague if at all possible; the prices are astronomically higher
than in the outside world. The hotels get away with this kind of price
gouging because they assume that hotel guests or fervent gamblers
don’t want to leave the property to pick up a bottle of shampoo or a
pack of gum.
Most of the hotels have small gift shops (also known as logo shops) that
offer a variety of trinkets for you to bring home to friends and family.
While such souvenirs are usually overpriced junk, some of what is
offered in the better hotels is of good quality — but still overpriced. In
other words, expect to pay through the nose no matter what you buy at
a hotel shop. You can try an independent souvenir shop, which will still
charge too much, but it may be slightly less outrageous.
The big guns
No matter what your budget, a few shopping spots inside the major
hotels are attractions in their own right; put them at the top of your 
to-do list.
Mix equal amounts of Rodeo Drive and the Ancient Roman Empire, and
then add a dash of Disney, and you may get something close to the Forum
Shops at Caesars Palace (3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-731-7110). And
you thought that we were kidding about theme malls? No matter what
kind of shopper you are, make this marketplace your first stop. It’s
Chapter 13: Shopping the Local Stores 225

designed to look like a Roman street scene, complete with columns,
marble, and animatronic statues under a “sky” that somehow transforms
from day to night as time passes. You find mostly high-rent joints, such
as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Armani, and Versace, alongside fancy
restaurants such as Spago. (Even if you don’t like shopping, it’s worth
the stroll just to giggle.) A wing added to the arcade houses a large
aquarium, more animatronics, designer boutiques, and more. An even
newer addition added a grand three-story rotunda with a circular escala-
tor (one of only two in the world) and more high-end stores (including
Juicy Couture and Vosges Haut Chocolate) and restaurants. For a truly
Vegas (and somewhat bizarre) experience, take in one of the every-
hour-on-the-hour light-and-laser shows at the Festival Fountain or the
Atlantis Fountain. Still not enough? Store hours may vary but the bulk of
them are open Sunday through Thursday from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. and
Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to midnight.
Just up the street from the eye-popping Forum Shops is gotta-see-to-
believe stop #2 — the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian (3355 Las
Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-414-1000). If the Forum Shops are a street out of
Rome, this is a street out of Renaissance Venice, complete with a cloud-
studded sky overhead. You can judge for yourself the subtle nuances
that differentiate the two. One big difference is the canal running down
the middle of the Canal Shoppes, complete with singing gondoliers. (A
ride costs $15. It’s not inexpensive, but it’s still a heck of lot cheaper
than the real thing in Venice.) The “canal” ends at a reproduction of St.
Mark’s Square, a stalled market where glass blowers and flower-sellers
ply their trades. You can even find strolling musicians. The other big dif-
ference is that the entertainment is live at the Canal Shoppes; costumed
actors garbed as typical Venetians (flower girls, courtesans, and so on)
and famous historical ones (Casanova, Marco Polo) roam the area,
bursting into Italian arias or just flirting with passersby. Will all this
make you want to shop more? Who cares? But if it does, you find more
than 70 retail shops — Sephora, Kenneth Cole, and Jimmy Choo, to
name a few — to choose from. The Grand Canal Shoppes (accessible
from the outside world via its own, casino-bypassing entrance) is open
Sunday through Thursday from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday and
Saturday from 10 a.m. to midnight.
Right next door (and accessible from the interior) in the Venetian’s sister
hotel are the Shoppes at Palazzo. They lack thematic splendor, but more
than make up for it with fashion fabulousness. It’s anchored by the superb
department store Barneys of New York, which is as aesthetically pleasing
as it is crammed with lust-inducing labels. The Shoppes have many
another drool-worthy store, such as Christian Louboutin, Fendi, Chloe,
Bottega Veneta, and Diane von Furstenberg. Open Sunday through
Thursday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m and Friday to Saturday 10 a.m. to midnight. 
Speaking of aesthetics, we no longer adore the visuals at Miracle Mile at
Planet Hollywood (3667 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-866-0710) since its
transformation from the Middle Eastern-themed Desert Passage. Trying
for a sort of “Madison Avenue” glitz and glam it’s really now just a very

large, sprawling, bland (if sparkly), fancy-pants mall. That’s not a theme,
dang it. But while perhaps lacking the high-end heaven of the previous
hotel shopping, it does have more accessible venues. They have a
branch of cheap-chic nirvana H&M, Sephora, True Religion, Parallel,
Betsy Johnson, bebe, Gap, and much more. With something for just
about every taste or need, it’s our shopping mall of choice for practical
reasons, if nothing else. Open Sunday to Thursday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m
Friday to Saturday 10 a.m. to midnight. 
If you really want a more Rodeo Drive experience, head straight for the
Via Bellagio shops (in the Bellagio; 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-693-
7111; hours for stores vary). Not one place in this mall offers prices that
we can afford (we can’t even afford the oxygen — we make guidebook-
writer wages, you know), but we sure like to browse and fantasize. Gucci,
Prada, Armani, Tiffany — they’re all here. And the setup, topped in its
entirety by an overhead skylight that actually allows for — gasp! — natu-
ral lighting, is most attractive. Speaking of this sort of experience, the
slightly smaller, but essentially same idea Esplanade at Wynn Las Vegas
(Wynn, 3131 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-770-7100; hours for stores vary)
has the same kind of fantasy stores — Chanel, Cartier, Jean Paul
Gaultier, Manolo Blahnik — but seems maybe just a touch less intimi-
dating. Just a touch, mind you.
The rest of the pack
Two levels of shopping and dining surround a casino at Masquerade
Village (3700 W. Flamingo Rd.; % 702-777-7777), a 60,000-square-foot
addition to the Rio Hotel & Casino. It’s done up as a European village,
and it sports mostly clothing boutiques and small curio or jewelry
shops. Be sure to stop by the ’Nawlins store, which sells voodoo items,
Mardi Gras masks, and the like.
Shopping is definitely no afterthought at the Stratosphere Las Vegas
(2000 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-380-7777); you have to pass through its
Tower Shops promenade in order to get to the tower itself. More than 40
stores are set along different international streetscapes that attempt to
evoke Paris, Hong Kong, and New York City. One notable gift shop here
sells functioning and decorative slot machines.
Harrah’s Las Vegas (3475 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-369-5000) is
unusual in that it has an outdoor shopping promenade: the Carnavale
Court. Assuming that it’s not deathly hot, this is a small but sweet place
to wander, stocked with open air carts featuring floaty dresses, naughty
underwear, purses, and more. Among the store highlights is a branch of
San Francisco’s famous Ghirardelli Chocolate shop.
Most of the hotel shopping arcades are adjacent to or in the middle of
casinos. Perhaps they hope that you use your shopping money on a slot
machine instead? Avoid these machines if at all possible, because they
are rumored to offer lower winnings than machines in other areas of the
casinos.
Chapter 13: Shopping the Local Stores 227

Where to Find the Bare Necessities
Forgot to pack your shampoo and don’t want to waste your kid’s 
college tuition by buying it in the hotel gift shop? Consider driving 
down Maryland Parkway, which runs parallel to the Strip on the east
and has one of everything: Target, Toys “R” Us, several major depart-
ment stores, major drugstores, some alternative-culture stores (tattoo
parlors and hip clothing stores), and so forth. It goes on for blocks.
If you need to fill a medical prescription, you can do it at Walgreens
drug store at Spring Mountain (3765 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-739-9638),
or at Sav-On at Maryland Parkway (1360 E. Flamingo Rd.; % 702-731-
5373). Another, more retro option is White Cross Drugs, just north of
the Stratosphere Tower (1700 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-382-1733).
Road-trippers whose cars need an emergency tune-up can try Pep Boys,
just east of Paradise (637 E. Sahara Ave.; % 702-796-0600), which is part
of a major auto parts and service chain.
Angling for Antiques
If you’re an antiques hound, you may want to poke around East
Charleston Road, where more than 20 small, good-quality antiques
stores are located within a few blocks of each other. We know an interior
designer who got most of her best pieces here. Go north on the Strip to
Charleston Road and turn right — the stores begin at about the 1600
block. You can also stop at Silver Horse Antiques (1651 E. Charleston
Blvd.; % 702-385-2700) to pick up a map that highlights all the individ-
ual shops, complete with phone numbers and business hours.
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
228
Can’t go home without a tacky souvenir?
The Bonanza Gift and Souvenir Shop (2460 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-384-0005),
located at the northwest corner of Sahara, bills itself as the “largest souvenir shop in
the world.” We have no way of verifying this, but it does have an enormous selection
of souvenirs. Your best bet in the tacky department are the earrings made out of poker
chips or the bracelets made out of dice.
Or head over to the Arts Factory (101–107 E. Charleston Blvd.; % 702-382-3886), which
offers, in addition to several art galleries (where you can pick up a really expensive
souvenir, such as an original painting), a very fine gift shop that caters to all camp sen-
sibilities. Pink flamingos, fuzzy dice, and truly marvelous retro-Vegas items — they’re
all here, along with so much more.

Shopping for Cool Clothes and Accessories
If you want hip and cool outfits, take a drive over to the Buffalo Exchange
(4110 S. Maryland Parkway; % 702-791-3960). It’s one of a chain of used-
clothing stores filled with vintage and current discards. Comb the racks
and find something that will instantly upgrade your trendy image. It’s in
a small shopping strip at the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway and
Flamingo Road. The Attic (1018 S. Main St.; % 702-388-4088; www.the
atticlasvegas.com) is another vintage/used-clothing store, with a gen-
erally excellent selection. It was featured for several years in an eye-
catching, too-cool-for-words Visa ad. They also make their own poodle
skirts!
If you crave showgirl hair (and why not?), stop in at Serge’s Showgirl
Wigshop (953 E. Sahara Ave., #A-2; % 702-732-1015; www.showgirl
wigs.com), located in the Sahara Commercial Center just east of
Paradise. This place has been supplying the Strip for more than 20
years, and it has some 2,000 wigs ranging from $130 to $1,500. It has wigs
by Dolly Parton and Revlon, and men’s and women’s hairpieces. You can
customize your own special creation.
If the prices at Serge’s main shop are too steep for you, check out Serge’s
Wig Outlet, just across the shopping center at 953 E. Sahara Ave. The
store offers discontinued wigs that run around $60 to $70. For informa-
tion, call % 702-732-3844.
Buying Gambling Gear
If you’re not content blowing your money at the blackjack table, you can
blow it on gambling-related stuff downtown at the Gambler’s General
Store (800 S. Main St.; % 800-322-CHIP; www.gamblersgeneralstore.
com), located 8 blocks south of Fremont. Another “World’s Largest” (who
decides these things?), the store has actual gaming equipment (dice,
craps tables, old slot machines, and more) plus a selection of gambling
books.
If you want to read up on strategy, try the Gambler’s Book Shop (630 
S. 11th St.; % 800-522-1777; www.gamblersbook.com), located near
Charleston Road. The store’s motto is “Knowledge is Protection.” You
can browse more than 4,000 gambling-related titles here, all designed to
help you beat the odds. Don’t forget to check out Casino Gambling For
Dummies, by Kevin Blackwood and Max Rubin (Wiley Publishing, Inc.),
for clear, concise tips on gambling strategies.
The store’s knowledgeable clerks are happy to provide on-the-spot
expert advice on handicapping the ponies and other aspects of sports
betting.

Chapter 14
Doubling Your Odds: 
A Pair of Itineraries
In This Chapter
 Viewing Vegas in four days
 Checking out the Strip
A
rguably, there are really only two ways to spend your time in Las
Vegas — gambling and looking at hotels.
Okay, that’s not exactly true. But if that’s all you do, unlike in most cities,
you haven’t missed much. These two activities, after all, are exactly
what Las Vegas is all about.
But you can organize your time in Vegas to get the most out of what the
city has to offer.
Seeing Las Vegas in Four Days
Like we said, you can just plunk yourself down at a poker table, heave
yourself back off the chair four days later, and consider your time well
spent. But if you want to check out the sights beyond that cute dealer,
here are some suggestions.
Day one
Ignore those slot machines — come on, you can do it, and you can get
back to them eventually, we promise — and head right out to the Strip.
This is one of the great wonders of the artificial world; it is as important
a sight, for entirely different reasons, as the Grand Canyon. And you
must take it all in, because you don’t know what will be gone by your
next visit. If you haven’t been to Vegas in more than six years — heck, if
it’s been more than six weeks — the town will be nearly unrecognizable
to you. This is a city that sheds its skin about every ten years. Things
change that fast, and they are only changing faster. Each new construc-
tion is meant to top what has come before. So go ogle it all. A lot of
people spent many hours and a whole lot of money erecting these 

behemoths; you may as well admire their work, because, after all, you
are paying for it!
We give you a suggested itinerary for viewing the Strip’s hotels in the
upcoming section, “Seeing the World-Famous Las Vegas Strip,” but here’s
the gist: Be sure to see the Venetian (including the Grand Canal Shoppes),
Wynn Las Vegas, Bellagio, The Mirage (including the white tigers),
Paris, Caesars Palace (including the Forum Shops and the talking stat-
ues), New York-New York, the MGM Grand, and the exteriors of the
Luxor, and the Excalibur. Then, at night, take a drive (if you can) down
the Strip. When the street is lit up, it’s even more extraordinary than it is
during the day.
Turn to Chapter 9 for more on all the Strip’s hotels. Be sure to note the
free evening entertainment: Bellagio’s water fountains, which “perform”
to various musical genres; the pirate battle at TI (even though it kinda
stinks, thanks to a reworking to turn the focus to less-than-nautical
nekked ladies); and the volcano explosion next door at The Mirage (see
Chapter 12 for more on these attractions). Have at least one meal at the
quintessential Vegas dining experience, the buffet (details in Chapter
10), and have a drink at the top of the Stratosphere, the tallest building
west of the Mississippi, and, not surprisingly, the best view in town (see
Chapter 17).
Oh, all right, maybe you should go gamble a little now (see Chapter 11
for gambling tips).
This is your budget day — the buffet (depending on where you go) prob-
ably doesn’t cost much, and with unlimited portions, you should eat
your fill! Hotel gazing is free (but we’re not responsible for what you
spend gambling).
Day two
Unless you were really energetic (and the temperatures weren’t
extremely hot!), you probably didn’t cover the whole Strip on day one,
so pick up where you left off. Then go see some smaller sights, such as
the Liberace Museum or the significantly less bejeweled Dolphin
Habitat. (See Chapter 12 for more on these and other attractions.)
Because day one was your budget day, tonight it’s time to kick out the
jams, budget-wise. First, you must take in a show. We think Cirque du
Soleil’s O and KÀ and the Blue Man Group are the finest productions in
Vegas — they are shows that any city would be proud of — but see
Chapter 16 for many other choices that may have greater ticket availabil-
ity (not to mention cheaper prices, if you refuse to let us spend your
money for you). Having done the buffet thing, take advantage of the
celebrity-chef invasion and have at least one haute cuisine meal — it’s as
over the top as the buffets, but in a different way; and face it, mass-
prepared buffet food is, shall we say, not of the same quality. Bartolotta’s,
Rosemary’s, Picasso, Table 10, Alize, L’Atelier, and Bouchon are our
Chapter 14: Doubling Your Odds: A Pair of Itineraries 231

top choices, but you can’t go wrong with Fleur de Lis, Aureole, or Alex.
You’ll also enjoy any of the following: Austin’s Steakhouse, Olives,
Charlie Palmer’s Steakhouse, Isla, Sensi, or the Border Grill. All are
reviewed in Chapter 10.
Day three
Loving this decadent thing, are you? Went into the casino “just to play
for a few minutes,” only to find that two days have passed without your
noticing?
It’s time to get out into the fresh air. Get off that slot machine stool and
drive out to Red Rock Canyon. The panoramic 13-mile Scenic Loop
Drive is best seen early in the morning when traffic is light. If you have
the time and energy, get out of your car and take a hike. You can even
give your gambling budget a break by spending the whole day out. If so,
have lunch at nearby Bonnie Springs Ranch, and afterward take a
guided trail ride into the desert wilderness or enjoy the silliness at Old
Nevada. You can find out more about these side trips later in Chapter
15. Be sure to take along a submarine sandwich from Capriotti’s (see
Chapter 10) for your lunch — they are cheap, large, and delicious.
Tonight, continue to enjoy that fresh air — of a sort — and head
Downtown. This neighborhood is often neglected because it simply can’t
stand up to the over-the-top excess of the Strip, but it’s far more user
friendly. About a dozen hotels and casinos lie within a five-minute walk
of one another, all grouped around a pedestrian mall, which, at night,
lights up overhead with the colorful and musical Fremont Street
Experience light show (see Chapter 12). Stick your head out of the
casino to look at it and think, “Look, I’m outside! I am!”
Day four
This is Culture and History Day! (Alas, the Liberace Museum did not
qualify.) Go see the marvel of modern engineering that is the Hoover
Dam. Leave early in the morning, returning to Las Vegas after lunch via
Valley of Fire State Park, while stopping at the Lost City Museum in
Overton en route (see Chapter 15 for more information on all these
attractions). Or spend time with some incredible works of art courtesy
the Bellagio Gallery of Art (see Chapter 12). Nothing like real art to
remind you of the artificial reality that is Las Vegas. Plus, think how
smug you can feel after enjoying some honest-to-gosh culture.
Too exhausted to do that, are you? And it’s kinda hot, is it? Oh, all right.
Another option is to recharge your batteries by spending the day by the
hotel pool or going to the hotel spa for some detoxing and pampering.
All rested up? Then get out again and enjoy the city that never sleeps.
Hit the casinos some more — you can take them down; we know you
can! Catch another show — if you went with our Cirque suggestion that
means you haven’t seen a classic Vegas topless revue, so get thee over
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
232

to Jubilee! (at Bally’s) pronto. Or you can enjoy the wonderful (and rea-
sonably priced) magic of Lance Burton (at the Monte Carlo), or the
smartest show in town, Penn & Teller (at the Rio), or laugh yourself
silly at the Second City Improv (see Chapter 16 for reviews of all these
shows). Get back into the decadent swing of things with another buffet
orgy, or worship at the shrine of a second celebrity chef.
After all, you are on vacation.
Seeing the World-Famous Las Vegas Strip
One of the main activities in town is wandering around and gawking at
the gigantic, splashy, gimmick-filled hotels. This should be your first
order of business, and getting through them all (especially if you stop
for a hand or two of blackjack at each) can take most of your trip. We
describe the hotels in detail in Chapter 9, but for sheer spectacle, here’s
the best way to see our favorites.
Start south on the Strip at Mandalay Bay (3950 Las Vegas Blvd. S; 
% 702-632-7777) to get a gander at its South Seas theme. As far as
themes goes, this one is pretty subtle, but it’s still worth getting a look at.
Walk through the Mandalay Place shops to get to the Luxor (3900 Las
Vegas Blvd. S; % 702-262-4000), where you can experience the Vegas
version of ancient Egypt. The Sphinx (don’t worry, the real one is still in
Egypt) stands guard in front of a 30-story pyramid that’s big enough to
house nine jumbo jets. Be sure to visit the dizzying interior of the pyra-
mid. It’s been de-Egypt-ified for mystifying reasons, but it’s still neck-
craning interesting. 
Now hop on the moving sidewalk — and exit at Camelot. Oh, not really,
but it is a giant medieval castle — or at least, a cartoon version of one.
It’s the Excalibur (3850 Las Vegas Blvd. S; % 702-597-7777), one of the
largest hotels in the world.
Then mosey right across Tropicana Avenue (a pedestrian overhead walk-
way can get you there) to New York-New York (3790 Las Vegas Blvd. S;
% 702-740-6969). Don’t worry, you’ll find it — it’s that little place (hah!),
on the corner of Trop and the Strip, that looks like the New York City
skyline, complete with the Empire State Building and the Statue of
Liberty. Take time to really appreciate all the silly touches, such as the
graffiti-covered mailboxes and the manhole covers.
At this point, you can take the overhead pedestrian walkway to the
opposite side of the Strip (for perfect photo ops of portions of New York-
New York) so that you can get up close and personal with the highly
impersonal MGM Grand. It’s the second-largest hotel in the world, and
at night, it’s very, very green. Speaking of photo ops, that molten-gold,
four-stories-high lion out front is just begging for your camera to snap
away. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!
Chapter 14: Doubling Your Odds: A Pair of Itineraries 233

Now take the monorail to the Bally’s, and use their pedestrian overhead
walkway to cross back over the Strip to Bellagio. Outside is a 12-acre
lake that features a free water-fountain ballet every 15 to 30 minutes
from 6 p.m. to midnight; it’s the best free show in town (see Chapter 12
for a full description). Turn your back on the fountains (between num-
bers, that is) and gape at that very large replica of the Eiffel Tower back
across the street at the Paris hotel. It costs to go up to the top, so save
your dough and stay on the ground. (Though you may want to wander
over there to admire all the replicas of Parisian landmarks and get a
baguette to go!) You might pop inside the Bellagio to admire the
Conservatory, a riot of color thanks to fresh flowers and plants that are
re-landscaped every few weeks to reflect the changing seasons.
At this point, you can go back across the street to the Planet Hollywood
and wander through its Miracle Mile shopping mall. It’s Madison Avenue
theme is not quite as interesting as the former Middle East extravaganza
that was the Desert Passage back when the whole mess was called
Aladdin, but it’s still worth a look if you’re not too pooped and aren’t
ready to call it a day. It’s also one of our favorite places to shop. If you
still have energy and ambition (or skipped the Planet Hollywood step),
your next stop is Caesars Palace, where you can gawk at the silly
wonder that is a re-creation (well, kinda), of ancient Rome, and the
oldest theme hotel in Vegas. The Forum Shops (see Chapter 13) are tied
with the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes for thematic silliness, but over
here they have talking statues. Head next to The Mirage, where, after
dusk, the volcano out front explodes every ten minutes (see Chapter 12).
Inside, you find a simulated (well, partially, anyhow) rainforest. 
Now proceed right next door TI, if you want to see the sorta naughty
free pirate stunt show we endlessly mock elsewhere in this book (partic-
ularly in Chapter 12). Otherwise, cross the Strip via the overhead pedes-
trian walkway to the Venetian. It’s another one you won’t miss, thanks
to its sheer size. Unlike the appealing but off-limits exteriors of the other
theme hotels, you can actually wander through the outside of this
replica of Venice, that most charming of Italian cities. And with its 
(non-smelly) canal, tall streetlights, and promenades, it is supremely
charming — for Vegas, at least. Dash inside for a cup of gelato (stopping
to admire the heavily marbled and art-covered grand entrance galleria),
and bring it outside for a snack. Or head upstairs to the Grand Canal
Shoppes (see Chapter 13), and pay a gondolier to row you about.
Finally, take yet another pedestrian walkway to Wynn Las Vegas, and see
what $2.7 billion buys in a hotel these days. We know for sure it buys a
150-foot-tall manmade mountain outside, and apparently, a whole lot
more. Then either grab a cab, hoof it, or grab the monorail home.

Going Beyond Las Vegas:
Two Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Heading to Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, and the Valley of Fire
 Winging off to Red Rock Canyon and Bonnie Springs
L
as Vegas can be a bit overwhelming, so if you’ve already blown your
bankroll or you need to take a breather from the blackjack table, a
day trip may be just the thing to recharge your batteries.
Day Trip #1: Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, 
and Valley of Fire State Park
A couple thousand people visit Hoover Dam daily to pay homage to the
engineering marvel, without which, frankly, there would be no Las Vegas.
A visit to the dam does not fill an entire day, but two other magnificent
spots nearby — Lake Mead and Valley of Fire State Park — also
deserve your attention.
Getting there
To get to Lake Mead, go east on Flamingo or Tropicana to U.S. 515 south,
which automatically turns into 93 south and takes you right to the dam.
This involves a rather dramatic drive, as you go through Boulder City,
come over a rise, and suddenly behold Lake Mead spread out before
you. It’s a beautiful sight. At about this point in the drive, the road nar-
rows down to two lanes, and traffic can slow considerably. On busy
tourist days, the drive can take an hour or more.
To continue on to Hoover Dam, go past the turnoff to Lake Mead. As
you near the dam, you see a five-story parking structure tucked into the
canyon wall on your left. Park here ($5 charge) and take the elevators or
stairs to the walkway leading to the Visitor Center.

To get to the spooky, otherworldly landscape of the Valley of Fire from
Las Vegas, take I-15 north to exit 75 (Valley of Fire turnoff). For a more
scenic route, take I-15 north, travel Lake Mead Boulevard east to North
Shore Road (Nev. 167), and proceed north to the Valley of Fire exit. The
first route takes about an hour, the second 11⁄2 hours. From Lake Mead
Lodge, take Nev. 166 (Lakeshore Scenic Drive) north, make a right turn
on Nev. 167 (North Shore Scenic Drive), turn left on Nev. 169 (Moapa
Valley Boulevard) west — a spectacularly scenic drive — and follow the
signs. Valley of Fire is about 65 miles from Hoover Dam.
Taking a tour
If you didn’t rent a car, or if you would rather go on an organized tour,
contact Gray Line (% 800-634-6579 or 702-384-1234; www.grayline.
com). The company offers several packages inside and outside of Las
Vegas. The 41⁄2-hour Grand Hoover Dam Tour ($39) departs daily at 7:30
a.m. and 11:30 a.m. There’s also a Neon & Lights Evening Tour ($43) of
Las Vegas that includes a narrative tour past the mega-resorts and a visit
to the Fremont Street Experience. You can inquire at your hotel sight-
seeing desk about other bus tours.
Numerous sightseeing tours also go to Valley of Fire. Inquire at your
hotel tour desk. Char Cruze of Creative Adventures (% 702-893-2051;
www.creativeadventuretours.net) also does a fantastic tour.
When you’re in Las Vegas, look in the numerous free publications avail-
able at hotels for discount coupons that offer significant savings on
tours to Hoover Dam and Valley of Fire State Park.
Seeing the sights
You should start your day with Hoover Dam itself, or rather, the Hoover
Dam Visitor Center (% 702-494-2517). There you can check out exhibits
on the dam and buy tickets for the Discovery Tour, which replaces the
previous hard-hat and traditional tours. The Visitor Center is open daily
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Thanksgiving and Christmas. You can pur-
chase tickets until 5:15 p.m. Admission is $11 for adults, $9 for seniors,
$6 for children 7 to 17, and free for children under 6. There is a $5 park-
ing fee. Note: Due to heightened security, visitors are not allowed on top
of the dam after dark.
It takes about two hours, either on the tour or on your own, to see all
that Hoover Dam has to offer. Although it’s not compulsory, it’s not a
bad idea to call in advance for the tour (% 866-730-9097). Kids may be
bored by the dam, unless they are budding engineers or just love big
things; but your parents probably took you to things you didn’t want to
see for your own good when you were a kid — so why should your kids
get off the hook?
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
236

After touring the dam, you can have lunch in Boulder City (see the
upcoming section, “Dining locally”), or you can go to the Lake Mead
National Recreation Area. Start at the Alan Bible Visitor Center,
4 miles northeast of Boulder City on U.S. 93 at Lakeshore Scenic Drive 
(% 702-293-8990), which provides information on all area activities and
services. You can pick up trail maps and brochures here, view informa-
tive films, and find out about scenic drives, accommodations, ranger-
guided hikes, naturalist programs and lectures, bird-watching, canoeing,
camping, lakeside RV parks, and picnic facilities. The center also sells
books and videotapes about the area. It’s open daily from 8:30 a.m. to
4:30 p.m., except Thanksgiving and Christmas. For information on
accommodations, boat rentals, and fishing, call Seven Crown Resorts
(% 800-752-9669). You can have a bite at the nautically themed restau-
rant at the Lake Mead Lodge (% 702-293-2074) at the marina (approxi-
mately a 1⁄2 mile away).
If you don’t want to spend your post-dam time on outdoor activities, you
can always drive back to Vegas via the Valley of Fire State Park, or you
can spend a day just on the park alone. This is an awesome, foreboding
desert tundra, full of flaming red rocks. It looks like the setting of any
number of sci-fi movies — not surprisingly, considering that a number of
them have been filmed here.
Plan on spending a minimum of an hour in the park, though you can
spend a great deal more time here. It can get very hot; there is nothing
to offer relief from the sun beating down and reflecting off all that red.
No water is available, so be certain to bring a liter, if not two, with you in
the summer. Without a guide, you must stay on paved roads, but don’t
worry if they end; you can always turn around and come back to the
main road. You can soak up a lot of the park from the car, but try one of
the hiking trails if you feel up to it.
Chapter 15: Going Beyond Las Vegas: Two Day Trips 237
Hoover Dam fun facts
Surely this is one of the few examples of primo government efficiency. Construction
on Hoover Dam began in 1931. Some 5,200 workers labored around the clock to com-
plete the dam in 1936, two years ahead of schedule and $15 million under budget. The
dam stopped the annual floods and conserved water for irrigation, as well as indus-
trial and domestic use. Equally important, it became one of the world’s major electri-
cal generating plants, providing low-cost, pollution-free hydroelectric power to a score
of surrounding communities. The dam itself is a massive curved wall, measuring 660
feet thick at the bottom and tapering to 45 feet where the road crosses it at the top. It
towers 726 feet above bedrock (about the height of a 60-story skyscraper) and acts
as a plug between the canyon walls to hold back up to 9.2 trillion gallons of water in
Lake Mead — the reservoir created by its construction.

Pick up information on Valley of Fire at the Visitor Center on Nev. 169, 
6 miles west of North Shore Road (% 702-397-2088). It’s open daily from
8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and is worth a quick stop for information and a bit
of history before you enter the park.
Dining locally
After touring Hoover Dam, have lunch in Boulder City, 7 miles north-
west of the dam on U.S. 93. You may want to check out some of the
antiques and curio shops while you’re there. For lunch, you have your
choice of a number of family-style restaurants and burger and Mexican
joints, including Totos, a reasonably priced Mexican restaurant (806
Buchanan Blvd.; % 702-293-1744) in the Vons shopping center. There
are no food concessions or gas stations in Valley of Fire State Park;
however, you can grab meals or gas on Nev. 167 or in nearby Overton
(15 miles northwest on Nev. 169). We recommend eating at Inside Scoop
(395 S. Moapa Valley Blvd.; % 702-397-2055), open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. It’s an old-
fashioned ice-cream parlor run by extremely friendly people. In addition
to the much-needed ice cream, classic sandwiches, and the like, the
menu features some surprising choices — a vegetarian sandwich and a
fish salad with crab and shrimp, for example.
At the southern edge of Overton is the Lost City Museum (721 S. Moapa
Valley Blvd.; % 702-397-2193), a sweet little museum commemorating
an ancient Anasazi village that was discovered in the region in 1924.
Admission is $3, $2 for seniors, and free for children under 18. The
museum is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and is closed
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day.
Day Trip #2: Red Rock Canyon 
and Bonnie Springs Ranch
For those of you craving a temporary escape from Vegas but not wanting
such an ambitious trip as Day Trip #1, head over to Red Rock Canyon.
Like Valley of Fire, it’s a surreal and lovely landscape of outer-space-like
rock formations, perfect for hiking or even just driving through while
emitting cries of “Oooooo!!!” It’s a fine way to recharge your batteries —
and it’s only 19 miles west of Vegas.
Getting there
Just drive west on Charleston Boulevard, which becomes Nev. 159.
Virtually as soon as you leave the city, the red rocks begin to loom
around you. The Visitor Center will appear on your right.
You can also go by bike. Charleston Boulevard has a bike path that
starts at Rainbow Boulevard and continues for about 11 miles to the
Part IV: Exploring Las Vegas 
238

Visitor Center/scenic drive. The path is hilly, but it is not difficult if
you’re in reasonable shape.
You should only explore Red Rock Canyon by bike, however, if you’re an
exceptionally fit and experienced biker.
Taking a tour
You can also see the canyon on an organized tour. Gray Line (% 800-
634-6579 or 702-384-1234; www.grayline.com), among other compa-
nies, runs bus tours to the canyon. Inquire at your hotel tour desk.
Seeing the sights
Just off Nev. 159, you see the Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center (% 702-
363-1921), which marks the actual entrance to the park. There you can
pick up information on trails and view history exhibits on the canyon.
The center is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
The easiest thing to do is to drive the 13-mile scenic loop. It really is a
loop, and it only goes one way, so after you start, you are committed to
drive the whole thing. You can stop the car to admire any number of fab-
ulous views and sights along the way, have a picnic, or take a walk or
hike. In fact, we can’t stress enough that the way to really see the
canyon is by hiking, if you are up to it. Every trail is incredible, with
mini-caves and rock formations to scramble over.
You can begin from the Visitor Center or drive into the loop, park, and
start from points therein. Hiking trails range from a .7-mile-loop stroll to
a waterfall (its flow varying seasonally) at Lost Creek, to much longer
and more strenuous treks. Actually, all the hikes involve a certain
amount of effort, because you have to scramble over rocks on even the
shorter hikes. The unfit or the ungraceful should be cautious. Be sure to
wear good shoes (the rocks can be slippery) and bring a map. As you
hike, keep your eyes peeled for lizards, the occasional desert tortoise,
flocks of bighorn sheep, birds, and other critters.
On the way to or fro, if you feel the need for some munchies, stop at the
fancy Red Rock Resort (10973 W. Charleston Rd., % 866-767-7773). It’s
worth an ogle on its own (good star spotting, so early reports say), but
within its food court is an outlet of our beloved submarine sandwich
place, Capriotti’s (perfect for a bargain meal or even a picnic to take
with you while you go explore the canyon), and among its several
restaurants is a branch of Austin, Texas’ famous Salt Lick BBQ. It’s not
quite as superlative as the original; but then again, it’s a lot closer.
After Red Rock, you can keep going another 5 miles west to Bonnie
Springs Ranch and Old Nevada. The latter is a kind of Wild West theme
park (complete with shootouts and stunt shows) with accommodations
and a restaurant — probably the best place to get a meal in this area.
Okay, it’s cheesy and touristy, but it’s fun, honest. If you’re traveling with
Chapter 15: Going Beyond Las Vegas: Two Day Trips 239

children, we recommend a day trip to Bonnie Springs; but it is surpris-
ingly appealing for adults, too. It can even be a romantic getaway, offer-
ing horseback riding, gorgeous mountain vistas, proximity to Red Rock
Canyon, and temperatures 5 to 10 degrees cooler than on the Strip.
For additional information, call Bonnie Springs Ranch/Old Nevada at
% 702-875-4191 or online at www.bonniesprings.com. Admission to
Old Nevada, per car (up to six people), costs $20. Hours vary during
summer and winter, so call ahead, but it is generally open from 10:30
a.m. to 5 p.m.
Bonnie Springs Ranch (% 702-875-4191) is right next door to Old
Nevada, with additional activities, including a small and highly dated
zoo, and a less politically distressing aviary on the premises.
Riding stables offer guided trail rides into the mountain area on a contin-
uous basis throughout the day (from 9 a.m.–3:15 p.m. in winter, until 
5:45 p.m. in summer). Children must be at least 6 years old to ride. Cost
is $50 per hour.

L
as Vegas is a nonstop town, and when the sun goes
down, the city really lights up. Although Vegas has a
sophisticated side, it’s not exactly known for symphony or
ballet. Nightlife in Vegas means dropping some of your hard-
earned gambling dough on big, splashy production shows
and checking out the hippest clubs and bars. This part of the
book helps you plan your Vegas nights.

L
as Vegas has a lot more to offer these days than the magic shows and
showgirls that helped build its reputation. Thanks to Mirage Resorts’
importation of the wildly successful (and quite avant-garde) Canadian
circus troupe Cirque du Soleil, you now have a wide variety of similar
big-budget shows to tickle your fancy. (All too similar, frankly; by the 
time you read this, there will be a Cirque show or plans for one in every
MGM Grand resort.) These days, the trend in major production shows is
toward bigger, louder, brighter, and more expensive creations — just the
right speed for Vegas audiences.
But never fear, this is still the town of illusionists and showgirls (crea-
tures of illusion themselves). If you want to see big-time magic acts or
topless-dancer revues, you won’t go home disappointed. This chapter
walks you through your options.
What’s On and Getting Tickets
Unless you’re a pampered high roller, a reservation is a must if you want
to see a show. Some shows — especially those going on during peak 
periods — sell out weeks in advance. You can often get last-minute tick-
ets for a weekday performance, but Lady Luck will have to be on your
side to get them on weekends. You won’t have such luck for major con-
certs, boxing matches, and other big-ticket performances, so reserve
your tickets to these events as soon as possible. We tell you how far in
advance you can reserve a ticket for each of the major production shows
in the following listings. To order tickets by telephone, call Ticketmaster
at % 702-474-4000, or go online to www.ticketmaster.com.

Keep your itinerary in mind when making show reservations so that
you’re not racing through your meal to make your show of choice. If the
show you want to see is on the Strip, plan for the extra time en route.
You don’t want backed-up traffic to bring down your good time.
The best way to find out what is happening in town when you’re visiting
is to contact the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (% 877-
VISITLV) and ask them to send you their “Showguide” brochure. The
LVCVA’s Web site maintains a calendar of Las Vegas events at www.visit
lasvegas.com, where you can search for shows, sporting events, and
more by date.
Other recommended resources:
 Vegas4Visitors.com is a terrific online resource packed with un-
biased reviews of hotels, attractions, shows, dining, and more.
Throw in their weekly column on the latest happenings around
town, plus gaming tips, travel advice, a Q&A feature, and more, and
this is one well-rounded site. Visit the Web site at www.vegas4
visitors.com.
 What’s On magazine is a free weekly publication found every-
where around Las Vegas. It’s chock-full of all the latest information
on shows, attractions, hotels, and restaurants. One note of caution:
It’s not precisely unbiased journalism. It’s all paid advertising; but
at least it tells you, up to the minute, what’s happening where.
Browse this magazine to find lots of coupons and specials in the
advertisements. To get a copy before you arrive in Vegas, call 
% 800-494-2876 or check out the magazine’s Web site at www.
ilovevegas.com; you won’t find the coupons online, though.
 The Las Vegas Leisure Guide, at www.pcap.com, is another com-
prehensive and up-to-date Web site, with listings of concerts,
shows, attractions, and restaurants. The guide is a great resource
for finding out if your favorite boxer is going to be in town or for
checking out the latest gossip.
 Las Vegas Weekly and City Life are free weekly publications that
you can find at local newsstands and stores. They’re the place for
the hip to find tips on alternative culture and the like, but they’re
also more detailed than other publications when it comes to listing
who can be found at what club or lounge that week. Did we men-
tion that both are free? The Friday edition of the local newspaper,
The Las Vegas Review Journal (% 702-383-0211), is another
good resource.
 The Las Vegas Convention and Visitor’s Authority (% 877-VISITLV;
www.visitlasvegas.com) and the Las Vegas Chamber of Com-
merce (% 702-735-1616; www.lvchamber.com) will send you full
packets of information about what to do and where to go.
 Reservations agents at Las Vegas hotels can tell you what is going on
during your stay. They can fill you in on all the hotel’s restaurants
Chapter 16: It’s Showtime! 245

and give you details and times for any resident shows or upcoming
concerts. They may even be able to offer you a discount on reserva-
tions. Sure, they only tell you about their specific property, but they
know their stuff!
We include admission prices on every listing in the following section,
but use them only as guidelines. Recent show changes or special promo-
tions may result in slightly different prices than those listed here.
Tickets generally cost $40 to $150 per person. Be sure to check to see if
your hotel offers discounts on shows (especially shows staged on the
premises). If you’re gambling, ask about discounted admission or even
free comp passes to shows and nightspots.
Some shows may not necessarily be obscene, but they may include
adult themes or skimpy costumes. If the show information doesn’t list a
separate price for children’s admission, it’s a fair bet that the show is
geared toward adults. Double-check the content before taking the young
’uns to these shows.
The Inside Scoop on Las Vegas Showrooms
Most showrooms these days are nonsmoking and have pre-assigned
seating. And most shows take place in the large hotels, so you’ll find free
self- or valet parking unless otherwise noted.
If the show you’re going to see has maitre d’ seating, it’s likely that “Old
Vegas” rules apply; you may be able to haul out some extra cash to tip
for a better seat. If you decide to take this route, plan to part with $5 to
$20 per couple, depending on the original price of your ticket. One
method you can try is to tip the captain who shows you to your seat
rather than the maitre d’. This way, if you are led to a satisfactory seat,
you don’t have to tip anything. But if you want something better, dis-
creetly show the captain what you are prepared to tip. What can we say?
Money talks.
If the venue charges extra for drinks, and you plan to have a few while
you enjoy the show, you may want to reconsider. These shows usually
charge very high prices for even the most modest cocktails. You may opt
to have a couple of drinks beforehand and then a nightcap later at a
more reasonably priced bar.
Las Vegas Productions A to Z
Given the spectrum of nightlife in Las Vegas, ranging all the way from glitz
to sleaze, choosing what to do at night is a highly personal matter. The
shows listed here are the most noteworthy of the pack. You can find
other big shows in the major hotels, but we’ve seen them all so you don’t
have to. Why waste your time and money? That’s what we’re here for!
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Las Vegas Nightlife 
246

Most productions rearrange their showtimes every so often, and many
go dark for a week or two here or there throughout the year. Be sure to
call in advance to ensure a production is playing when you think it is. 
Wow, look at those prices! They are . . . well, excuse us while we go lie
down, as we feel a little faint. ($250 for Bette? Dearie me.) Thank good-
ness for Tickets2Nite (% 702-939-2222, 3785 Las Vegas Blvd. S. in the
giant Coke bottle at the Showcase Mall) and Tix4Tonight (877/849-4868;
www.tix4tonight.com). Each day at 2 p.m., these outlets put unsold
seats for that evening on sale for half-price. Are they going to have front
row seats for Miss Midler the night you are in town? Unlikely. But you
might get a shot at decent seats for Cirque and who knows? Maybe
there’s a pair in the back for the Divine One, too. Or just play a wild card
and see what comes up. Naturally, this service is popular, so you proba-
bly have to start standing in line a couple of hours before they open. 
Bette Midler
Center Strip
There is nothing like a dame, and the Divine Miss M proves it night after
night. This is old school Vegas entertainment, and we mean that in the best
of ways. A supremely, all-around talented performer (she sings! She dances!
She tells incredibly lewd jokes!) heads a cast of sparklingly clad lovelies
who assist her in all the above, along with a whip sharp band, and, of
course, mermaids in wheelchairs doing dance numbers. No special effects,
just pure show biz from a pro who makes it all look so easy. While this pro-
duction does function as a sort of greatest-hits revue, it doesn’t feel like an
exercise in nostalgia, nor do you need to be a prior Midler fan to enjoy the
contents. Having said that, the high-end prices are probably too much for
anyone other than fans, but sightlines are good no matter where you are in
the theater. So grab a “cheap” seat and let her entertain you. 
3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in Caesars Palace). % 877-BETTEM or through www.
ticketmaster.com. Admission: $95–$250. Showtimes: 100 shows a year, usually
in 4-week blocks, Tues, Wed, Fri–Sun at 8 p.m. 
Blue Man Group
Center Strip
Yes, there are men in this show, and yes, they are blue — not emotionally
but literally, having been dipped in azure paint. This is not a typical Vegas
show. It originated in New York City, where it’s a still-running, highly suc-
cessful performance-art show for the masses. Cheese is involved, as are
marshmallows, paint, and a whole lot of crepe paper, not to mention
printed and electronic non sequitors, and some exquisite and unusual per-
cussion music. So what’s it about? Nothing. Call it slapstick Dada. It’s every
bit as pointless as the many revues playing around Vegas, and it’s also
about 1,000 times smarter. You’ll laugh yourself silly. The show hasn’t
changed much since it moved to The Venetian in 2006. That’s incentive if
you haven’t seen it, but not enough of a reason to go back if you already
have.

3355 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in The Venetian). % 877-833-6423. Reservations accepted

Sun–Fri 7:30 p.m., Sat 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Showroom policy: Nonsmoking with
pre-assigned seating.
Cher
Center Strip
Is it possible that all of evolution, all the history of civilization has led 
to . . . Cher with her own show at Caesars Palace? Hey, don’t laugh! There
is something truly momentous about her rags-to-gaudy-riches tale, over-
coming adversity and reaching new heights in music, television, film 
and . . . oh, heck. She’s got Bob Mackie outdoing himself for her outfits
(which she changes more than frequently), she tells self-deprecating tales,
she swears like a sailor, she sings her forty-plus years of hits from “The
Beat Goes On” through “Believe” with fabulous choreography and visual
spectacle. Maybe she’ll even do “Half Breed”! 
3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (In Caesars Palace). % 866-510-2437. Admission: $95–$250
plus tax. Showtimes: Tues, Wed, Sat, Sun at 7:30 p.m., at intervals throughout the
year. Showroom policy: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating.
Cirque du Soleil’s KÀ
South Strip
“No, not another Cirque show!” we cried. But then we went to see this glo-
rious production, and “Yes, another Cirque show, please,” we said. First of
all, unlike most Cirque shows, it has a real plot: an epic saga of royal sib-
lings separated by betrayal, battling their way back to each other.
Secondly, it has an extraordinary stage, a hydraulic masterpiece that
moves and shifts in order to provide any number of different settings (a
ship, a mountainside, and much more) for the magical realism martial arts
action. Think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and similar movies as a stage
show, and you almost have the idea. It’s gorgeous, it’s touching, it’s smart,
it’s Cirque. Wow. Again. And some more, please.
3799 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the MGM Grand). % 877-880-0880. Reservations accepted
up to 90 days in advance. Admission: $69–$150 (drinks and tax extra). Showtimes:
Fri–Tues 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Showroom policies: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned
seating.
Cirque du Soleil’s Love
Center Strip
Having said the previous, it is possible one could make a case that this
particular Cirque production, conceived with the help of Fifth Beatle/pro-
ducer Sir George Martin and with the official stamp of the surviving mem-
bers and their families, is best enjoyed if you are a Beatles fan. Given their
record sales, of course, one could reasonably wonder if anyone isn’t, but
never mind. Still, so many mop top pop culture references spun through
the avant-garde Cirque machine might make those without that particular
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Las Vegas Nightlife 
248

knowledge feel a bit left out. Plus, there aren’t any big centerpiece num-
bers, with the emphasis instead on dance and scenic interpretations of
Beatles tunes. It’s still a delight, but there might be other Cirque produc-
tions you could choose first.
3400 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Mirage). % 800-963-9637. Reservations accepted up
to 90 days in advance. Admission: $94–$150 (drinks and tax extra). Showtimes: Nightly
7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Showroom policies: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating.
Cirque du Soleil’s Mystère
Center Strip
This was the show that really changed the long-stagnant Vegas entertain-
ment scene, an innovative spectacle and an experience like no other in Las
Vegas. Of course, now not only are there (as we write this) five Cirque
shows on the Strip, not to mention Cirque-influenced shows, so it’s hardly
unique. But it’s still a great lot of enigmatic and gorgeous fun. If you’re
expecting a traditional circus performance, forget it. There are no animals
in this entrancing show. Instead, a human troupe of acrobats, dancers,
gymnasts, and clowns perform highly choreographed, imaginative acro-
batics and hypnotic feats of human strength. It is surreal, engaging, whim-
sical, dreamlike, and, occasionally, bewildering. It may be a bit too
sophisticated and arty for smaller kids’ tastes, however. The show is pre-
sented in a huge customized showroom with state-of-the-art hydraulics,
and the performers use every inch of it. Arrive early, because the hijinks
usually start about 15 minutes before the actual show begins.
3300 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in Treasure Island). % 800-288-7206. Reservations accepted
up to 90 days in advance. Admission: $60–$95 (drinks and tax extra). Showtimes:
Wed–Sat 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m; Sun 4:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Showroom policies:
Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating.
Cirque du Soleil’s O
Center Strip
At some point, when writing something like this, you run out of adjectives
and superlatives, particularly when you have to describe your second
favorite Cirque du Soleil show (if not your favorite Cirque du Soleil show)
which was difficult to describe to begin with. (If we could describe it, it
wouldn’t be Cirque.) But this is the one high-priced ticket where we can
look you straight in the eye — and wallet — and earnestly say, “But it’s
worth it.”
How do we figure? Let’s say this: Read the preceding review for Mystère and
understand that everything said there applies here, except that this show
takes place in, on, above, and around a 1.5-million-gallon pool (“Eau” — 
pronounced O — is French for water), housed in an $80-million theater that
puts the Mystère one to shame. To say much more than that would be to
ruin many a visual surprise. Don’t expect a linear narrative, but do expect
to get whiplash as you suddenly realize something else marvelous has qui-
etly begun taking place on another part of the stage. And don’t be surprised
if the sheer beauty of this extraordinary production makes you weep a little.
Chapter 16: It’s Showtime! 249

3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Bellagio). % 888-488-7111 or 702-693-7722. Reservations
accepted up to 28 days in advance for general public, 90 days for guests of Mirage

Admission: $94–$150 (tax included). Showtimes: Wed–Sun 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
Showroom policies: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating. No tank tops, shorts, or

Cirque du Soleil’s Zumanity
South Strip
Into every life, a little rain must fall. And into every reviewer must fall the
task of describing a venture that, though by a company one previously has
thoroughly admired, one hates. And so, Zumanity. It’s the Cirque du Soleil
adults-only show. Oh, it sounds good — all those taut bodies writhing and
contorting — but in reality, it’s not only not erotic, it kind of has the oppo-
site effect. It’s like every other Cirque show, except with the contortions
and acrobatics done naked (or appearing naked). See . . . Vegas isn’t for
families anymore. Even the circus has gone NC-17. Oh, and it has even less
cohesion and plot. In its other shows, Cirque has succeeded by assuming
its audience is smart; here it fails by assuming the opposite. Be honest,
not to mention fiscally savvy; just go to a strip club, and tip the girls well.
3790 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in New York-New York). % 702-740-6969. Admission: $69–
$129 (tax included). Showtimes: Fri–Tues 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Showroom policies:
Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating.
Criss Angel: Believe
South Strip
The eclectic magician, illusionist, and escapologist has teamed up with the
ubiquitous Cirque du Soleil — man, you’ve read a lot about Cirque as these
listings have gone on, haven’t you? — for an inspired pairing. Angel’s 
visuals are as striking as his stunts, while Cirque is nothing if not eye-
catching. And if there is one thing Cirque’s on-going presence in Vegas
needs, it’s some kind of anchor, because there is only so much imagina-
tive surreal silliness and beauty you can take before it becomes as repeti-
tive and blank as a series of pretty postcards. So, Angel; he provides high
level magical illusions throughout a loose narrative (something about a
mysterious Victorian gentleman going on a fantasy journey — yeah, yeah,
whatever, just make something unlikely disappear, okay?) which help keep
the proceedings from mere (if stunning) acrobatics and freeform dance.
The right combination of razzle and dazzle. 
3900 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in New York New York). % 800-288-1000. Admission: $59–

pre-assigned seating.

Danny Gans: The Man of Many Voices
Center Strip
Impressionist extraordinaire Danny Gans consistently rates as the “best
in Las Vegas,” according to local polls. Gans, a former Broadway theater
star, does uncanny and hilarious impressions of great entertainers. The
emphasis is on musical impressions (everyone from Sinatra to Springsteen),
with some movie scenes (Hepburn and Fonda from On Golden Pond, Tom
Hanks in Forrest Gump) and weird, fun duets (Michael Bolton and Dr. Ruth)
thrown in. He performs a mind-boggling rendition of “The Twelve Days of
Christmas” in 12 different voices. During the course of the show, Gans daz-
zles his audience with almost 80 different personas. Gans’s vocal flexibil-
ity is impressive, although his impersonations can be hit or miss. Having
said all that, we’re not comfortable telling you that he’s worth his high
ticket cost — but he keeps selling out every night, so many folks must

accepted up to 30 days in advance. Admission: $100. Showtimes: Wed and Fri– Sun
at 8 p.m. Showroom policies: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating. Note: This show
will play at its current location until Nov 2008 before moving to the Wynn sometime in
2009. 
Folies Bergère
South Strip
This topless revue is a veritable Vegas institution and one of the few
remaining dinner shows in town. Although it’s not the Ultimate Topless
Revue (we reserve that honor for Jubilee!), history has to count for some-
thing. The show features beautiful showgirls dancing and singing while
bedecked in lavish costumes (the headdresses aren’t the largest in 
town — only the size of a two-seater). Scenes feature music from a variety
of eras and styles (Parisian, American oldies, and so on) and are punctu-
ated by acrobatic and comedy acts.
3801 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Tropicana Resort & Casino). % 800-829-9034.
Reservations accepted up to seven days in advance. Admission: $69–$76. Taxes and
gratuities extra. Showtimes: Mon, Wed, Thurs (covered), and Sat at 7:30 p.m. (top-
less) and 10 p.m. (topless); Tues and Fri at 8:30 p.m. (topless). Showroom policies:
Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating.
Jersey Boys 
Center Strip 
Given the track history for Broadway shows — as we write this, there is
only one other (Phantom) still playing in town — it’s hard to say whether
this slightly truncated production (no intermission) of the Tony-award win-
ning musical will still be running by the time you read this. (Yes, that’s pes-
simistic, but you should have seen how fast Hairspray closed.) Then again,
like Mamma Mia! (which ran for years) before it, Jersey Boys has the ben-
efit of being stuffed with recognizable, and in many cases much-beloved,
Chapter 16: It’s Showtime! 251

hit songs. The story of the rise to fame of Frankie Valli and the Four
Seasons, this is as much drama as it is musical, and thus more than just an
exercise in tribute bands. Still, the format means this is a solid combo of
concert and theater, and the quality means it’s far more than just a pleas-
ant diversion from gambling. The subject matter, apart from some Joisey-
style cussing, is suitable for families, though of course kids may not care
about a group whose heyday was four decades ago. But the lively nature
of the staging may draw them in anyway. 
3325 Las Vegas Blvd S. (in the Palazzo). % 866-641-SHOW. Admission: $65–$135.
Showtimes: Mon, Thurs, Fri, Sat at 7 p.m.; Tues and Sat at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. 
Jubilee!
Center Strip
This is what you envision when you think of a Las Vegas topless extrava-
ganza. The show includes lots of singing, dancing, fantastic costumes, elab-
orate sets, and variety acts. And, oh yeah, bare breasts. Lot’s of ’em. It’s a
huge show, with more than 100 dancers and over-the-top sets, and we
don’t even know how many bosoms. Wild production numbers abound,
including “Samson and Delilah” and a musical re-creation of the Titanic
sinking (which prompted at least one recent attendee to comment, “The
effects are better here than in the movie”). We’re not saying that it’s good
theater, but we are saying that it’s mighty good entertainment — in an
utterly camp way. If you want to see a classic out-there Vegas show, this is
the one. Heck, even if you never thought that you wanted to see such a
production, trust us, you’ll want to see this.
3645 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in Bally’s Las Vegas). % 800-237-7469. Reservations accepted
up to six weeks in advance. Admission: $68–$110, excluding tax. Drinks and gratuities
extra. Showtimes: Sat–Thurs at 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Showroom policies: Non-
smoking with pre-assigned seating.
Lance Burton: Master Magician
South Strip
Apart from Criss Angel’s hybrid show down the street, this is the most
prominent magic show in a city that used to burst with them. Burton cre-
ates his magic inside a lush, Victorian-style music hall. The laid-back
Kentucky native favors gorgeous and skillful close-up magic over grand
illusions. He also does a few big-set pieces, but Burton’s laconic style
makes even these routines come off as better than silly and overproduced
shtick. Even his support act, comic juggler Michael Goudeau, is superior
to corresponding acts in other shows. If he had his own show, we’d make
him a must-see (and not just because he wrote a sidebar for this book; see
“Michael Goudeau’s top ten favorite things to see or do in Vegas” in
Chapter 12). Those looking for over-the-top Vegas pomp may find the show
a bit modest; but given how much the Vegas entertainment landscape has
changed, this sort of show is now a refreshing change of pace. Plus did we
mention he’s really good?
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Las Vegas Nightlife 
252

3770 Las Vegas Blvd. S (in the Monte Carlo Resort & Casino). % 877-386-8224.
Reservations accepted up to 60 days in advance. Admission: $61–$73, excluding tax.
Drinks are extra. Showtimes: Tues and Sat at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m,. Wed–Fri 7 p.m. only.
Showroom policies: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating.
La Reve
North Strip
Truth be told — and we always tell you the truth — La Reve will always
suffer from Cirque comparisons. It’s hard not to make them, since this, like
O, is set in and around a large body of water and features gifted perform-
ers doing hypnotic dance moves and acrobatics. It helped that they
brought in Momix choreographer/resident genius Moses Pendleton to give
it an overhaul, but this is still second choice after all those Cirque produc-
tions listed previously. (Well, it’s a lot better than Zumanity!) Given that
there isn’t a bad seat in the house, this should be tops on your Tickets2Nite
half price list. 
3131 Las Vegas Blvd S. (in Wynn Las Vegas), % 888-320-7110. Admission: $99–$179.
Showtimes: Mon, Thurs, and Sun 7 and 9:30 p.m.; Sat 8 and 10 p.m. Showroom poli-
cies: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating. Ages 13 and over. 
Mac King 
Center Strip
Sure, this isn’t cheap like going to a movie matinee; but given the increas-
ingly high double (and frequently triple) digit prices of most Vegas shows
and the undeniable quality of the show, this ranks as a great value. A
favorite of local performers himself, King does clever, close up magic, in a
most hilarious and original way; and he’s an utter charmer. One of the rare
shows that’s suitable for the kids, it’s timed just right for an afternoon
break for anyone. 
There are often casino reps/showgirls outside Harrah’s in the Carnival
Court with discount coupons (under $10, two-for-one, or even free with
drink purchase) for Mac King. You can also try at the Harrah’s Reward
Center, where you may have to join the player’s club, but that’s free and
brings its own rewards.
3475 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in Harrah’s). % 702-369-5222. Showtimes: Tues–Sat 1 and
3 p.m. Admission: $25 (plus tax and service fees). Showroom policies: Nonsmoking
with maitre d’ seating. 
Penn & Teller
Center Strip
Magicians Penn & Teller wear boring grey suits; loudmouth Penn does all
the talking and yammering, while poor silent Teller slinks around like a
demented Seuss character, as they expose all the terrible, awful tricks
magicians play on audiences. Then they go ahead and play even more ter-
rible, awful tricks on their own audience — who love every minute of it.
Chapter 16: It’s Showtime! 253

This is by far the most intelligent show in Vegas. They are wicked genuises,
the two of them; and we don’t deserve them.
3700 W. Flamingo Rd. (in the Rio Suites Hotel). % 888-746-7784. Admission: $75–$85.
Showtimes: Wed–Mon at 9 p.m. Showroom policies: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned
seating.
Phantom: The Las Vegas Spectacular
Center Strip
Peculiar title notwithstanding, this is a 90-minute, intermission-free, heavy-
on-the-special-effects, costly staging of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ubiquitous
musical of “The Phantom of the Opera.” Those who know and love the
show may be delighted, despite the truncated length and additional pres-
ence of pyrotechnics; those who don’t may find themselves less moved
than befuddled. (Okay, so there’s this guy who lives under an opera house
and hides his face ’cause he’s ugly, and he loves a girl who may love him
back or may love another guy instead, and there’s singing. There you go.)
The “spectacular” part may be Vegas’s attempt at greater success with the
current Broadway-import experiment, which has already seen the prema-
ture demise of otherwise charming and worthy award winners such as
Avenue Q and Hairspray.
3355 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in The Venetian). % 888-641-7469. Admission: $80–$175
(drinks and tax extra). Showtimes: Thurs and Sun 7 p.m., Mon, Wed, Fri, and Sat 7
and 10 p.m. Showroom policies: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating.
Second City Improv
Center Strip
Remember when Saturday Night Live was consistently good because it had
people like John Belushi, Gilda Radner, and Martin Short? Well, that’s
because the show pulled much of its talent — including those very 
performers — from Chicago’s Second City, an improv-based comedy group
that showed no mercy; you either got really funny really fast, or you got
out and became a dentist. Although we can’t guarantee that you will see
any Star of Tomorrow here, we can say that the Second City standards
apply. Only the strong, fearless, and flat-out funny will be on stage taking
suggestions from the audience (please, suggest something apart from
vomit and sex, okay?) to spur along this collection of skits and songs. The
results range from merely funny to gasping-for-breath hilarious. It’s one of
the best shows, and values, in town.
3555 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in the Flamingo Las Vegas). % 800-732-2111. Admission:
$45 (excluding tax). Showtimes: Thurs, Sat, and Sun 8 and 10:30 p.m., Tues, Wed, and
Fri 8 p.m. only. Showroom policies: Nonsmoking with maitre’d seating.
Stomp Out Loud 
Center Strip
Let’s make some noise! No, wait, don’t bother — these performers will do
it for you. There is nothing they won’t turn into percussion instruments —
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Las Vegas Nightlife 
254

water jugs, boxes, trash cans, key rings — and boy, do you feel the beat.
It’s clever, if a bit redundant after a certain point; but it’s always infectious
and joyous. Bring the kids, but don’t blame us if they spend the rest of the
trip going tappity-tappity-tap-tap on every surface they can find. 
3663 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in Planet Hollywood). % 877-333-0474. Admission: $60–$100.
Showtimes: Mon 6 and 9 p.m.; Tues, Thurs, Fri, and Sun 7 p.m.; Sat 7 and 10 p.m.
Tournament of Kings
South Strip
Kings in various distant lands gather together to compete in a highly cho-
reographed tournament — and all the while, you eat dinner with your
hands. Sound like fun? Well, it kind of is — we even got some too-cool
teenagers to acknowledge that they had a good time, and you know how
hard that can be. The show is full-blown medieval tournament fare, with
audience participation encouraged to the point of overkill. There’s a whole
lot of hooting and hollering going on. Think of it as dinner theater mixed
with professional wrestling. If you’re into the WWE or Renaissance fairs, or
you’re just a child at heart (underneath your armor), you may find it enter-
taining. But actual children are the ones who most enjoy this show; their
parents usually look like they’d prefer to be at Jubilee!
3850 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (in Excalibur). % 800-933-1334. Admission: $55, including
dinner, beverage, tax, and gratuities. Showtimes: “Knightly” (their word, not mine) at
6 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Showroom policies: Nonsmoking with pre-assigned seating.
Headliner Showrooms
It used to be that Vegas’s nightlife was dominated by showroom 
headliners — heard of the Rat Pack? — but although they are no longer
the major players in town, headliner showrooms still offer great enter-
tainment (especially in the rock music genre).
Describing the venues is really a waste of time; you’re not going for the
décor. Policies, prices, and showtimes vary by performer and venue, so
call the showroom for information. We give a few examples of the per-
formers who have played in each place in order to give you a sense of
the type and caliber of performers that management tends to book.
Here’s a list of the best of the bunch:
 The main competition for the Joint (see next listing) is the House of
Blues in Mandalay Bay (3950 Las Vegas Blvd. S; % 877-632-7400).
Both target the same kind of rock acts — when Alanis Morrisette
played the Joint, her tour’s opening act, Garbage, played the House
of Blues. Other acts on the schedule at presstime include Rancid,
Peter Murphy, Natasha Bedingfield, Erykah Badu, and Ted Nugent.
If you sit downstairs, be careful not to get stuck behind a stage-
obscuring pillar, and note that upstairs has proper theater seating
and is perhaps the best place in town from which to watch a show.
Chapter 16: It’s Showtime! 255

During the summer, Mandalay Bay hosts outdoor “beach side” con-
certs with performers playing on a stage in the wave pool while the
audience relaxes on the sandy shore. Performers have included the
B52’s and the Go-Go’s.
 The Joint, in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (4455 Paradise Rd.; 
% 800-693-7625), is the place to see rock headliners, including
Melissa Etheridge, Marilyn Manson, Black Eyed Peas, Norah Jones,
and even Bob Dylan. (On the upcoming schedule as we went to
press; the Sex Pistols, the Black Crowes, Lit, My Morning Jacket,
and As I Lay Dying.) Note that sightlines here can be pretty tricky
because it’s often general admission, standing room only. That will
change because at some point the old venue will be closed to be
replaced by a more up to date, and slightly larger, one elsewhere on
the property. 
 At the Las Vegas Hilton (3000 Paradise Rd.; % 800-222-5361),
Barry Manilow has been thrilling his Fanilows with regular perform-
ances of his “Music and Passion” show, handily filling its 1,500
seats. When Barry’s not in residence, a variety of entertainers try
to fill his illustrious shoes, 
 The 15,225-seat MGM Grand Garden, in the MGM Grand Hotel/
Casino (3799 Las Vegas Blvd. S; % 800-929-1111), offers sporting
events and the biggest pop concerts: Paul McCartney, Sting, the
Rolling Stones, Janet Jackson, and U2. Tickets are available through
Ticketmaster (% 702-474-4000 or through your home-town
Ticketmaster number). The 650-seat MGM Grand Hollywood
Theatre is located in the same hotel. Here, you can see smaller
shows in a more intimate setting. It has hosted Wayne Newton,
Dennis Miller, Randy Travis, Tom Jones, and Las Vegas tapings of
The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
 The 450-seat Orleans Showroom, in the Orleans (4500 W. Tropicana
Ave.; % 800-ORLEANS), hosts acts like Trisha Yearwood, Clint
Black, Gladys Knight, and Michael Bolton. It also has a new 9,000-
seat Orleans Arena featuring sporting and concert events.
The three level, theater seating, state of the art Pearl at the Palms (4321
W. Flamingo Rd. % 702-942-7777) has 2,500 seats but because of its
layout feels more intimate. Recent acts include Stone Temple Pilots,
Judas Priest, Katt Williams, and Eddie Izzard.

L
as Vegas is a 24-hour town, and so it goes without saying that the
nighttime is the right time. This chapter explores some of your
nightlife alternatives. Whether you are a Swinger or a Ring-a-Ding-Dinger,
Vegas has something for you — and we try to list it (or a portion of it)
here. Pry yourself away from the slot machines or the roulette wheel, if
only to give your wallet (and wrists) a rest. It won’t even cost you any-
thing, if you choose; it’s fun just wandering around, checking out the
neon spectacle, and barhopping from hotel to hotel.
Insomniacs rejoice! This city is the answer to your prayers. If you find
yourself with a sudden burst of party energy late at night, you’re in luck
in Las Vegas. You can legally buy liquor 24 hours a day, and a lot of joints
take advantage of that fact by never closing. Because of the late-night
mentality that prevails in this city, you may find that most bars and
nightclubs don’t really start jumping until late.
A word to the wise: Nevada has extremely tough laws regarding drink-
ing and driving, public intoxication, and disorderly conduct. It’s fine to
go out and have a good time, but don’t think that absolutely anything
goes. There are boundaries (and they are enforced), despite the hedo-
nistic, party-zone atmosphere.
Laughing the Night Away: Comedy Clubs
A haven for stand-up comedians, Vegas has several hotel-based comedy
clubs; many prominent comics have paid their dues on the Vegas stage.

Las Vegas Nightlife
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Las Vegas Nightlife 
258

Up-and-coming comics frequently perform in the Vegas clubs, so the per-
former you see may be that next sitcom star. Show times and prices
vary, but we list the latest pricing information throughout this section.
Here’s something cool to consider: Some big-name comedians are known
to put in special unannounced appearances at Las Vegas comedy clubs
to test out new material. In fact, many of the jokes you hear from Jay
Leno on The Tonight Show were told to Vegas audiences beforehand. The
clubs don’t tell you in advance, so you can’t plan to see these “pre-
views”; but you may be in for a pleasant surprise.
 The Comedy Club, in the Riviera Hotel & Casino (2901 Las Vegas
Blvd. S.; % 800-634-6753 or 702-734-9301), features comics, hypno-
tists, and occasional theme shows (shock comics, X-rated, all gay,
and so on) at 8:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. nightly. The price is $25 and
includes one drink and tax. You can’t call ahead and charge over
the phone, so plan to buy your tickets at the box office. Oh, and it
even includes maitre d’ seating.
 The Comedy Stop, in the Tropicana Resort & Casino (3801 Las
Vegas Blvd. S.; % 800-829-9034 or 702-739-2411), has 8 p.m. and
10:30 p.m. shows nightly. The $22 cover includes one drink, tax,
and gratuities. You can charge tickets in advance, and there’s
maitre d’ seating. Note: This is the only comedy show in town that
permits smoking (late show only).
 An offshoot of the famous New York City club, The Improv, in
Harrah’s Las Vegas (3475 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 800-392-9002 or
702-369-5111) has a 400-seat showroom that often books the top
comics on the comedy-club circuit. You can catch shows every day,
except Monday, at 8:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. for $31 (tax and drinks
extra). Call ahead to charge tickets. Seating is pre-assigned.
Chapter 17: Bars, Stars, and Gee-tars: Las Vegas at Night 259
Looking for lounge lizards
If you’re looking for lounge acts, you don’t have to go far: Just about every hotel has a
lounge with some sort of live, nightly entertainment. There was a time when you could
find a flood of top-drawer acts in hotel lounges; but these days, expect stand-up comedy
or impersonator shows. Some are good, some are comedic, and many are just plain
campy. If you’re looking for the latter, keep your eyes peeled for the dreaded — and
delightful — Cook E. Jarr (www.cookejarr.com), a cult figure currently lauded as
the worst, yet most special, lounge act in Vegas. (At this writing, he was performing
at Harrah’s Carnival Court on Fri and Sat from 6–8 p.m.)

Finding Live Music without the Camp
If you want some more solid musical entertainment without the camp
value, here are a few places to check out:
 The free Vegas lounges aren’t the reliable spots for entertainment
that they used to be, but the Coral Reef at Mandalay Bay is a better-
than-average representative of the genre. Bands are good, the place
is always jumping, the crowd therein is a little more grown-up than
in other locales and it’s always free (3950 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-
632-7000).
 If you’re looking for something different still, check out the zydeco
and jazz bands that perform along with more traditional acts at
Orleans (4500 W. Tropicana Ave.; % 702-365-7111). Zydeco is
southern Louisiana music combining French dance melodies,
Caribbean music, and the blues. You can also hear other New
Orleans sounds in the lounge next to the front doors. It’s open
nightly (except Mon), 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.
Shaking Your Groove Thang: 
The Best Dance Clubs
You can find plenty of places to dance the night away. In contrast to Las
Vegas’s normally casual atmosphere, the hot clubs have dress codes —
some more strict than others. You also encounter a number of steep
cover charges and more than a little attitude. Call ahead to get the scoop
on the details (although you may not find out about the attitude factor
until it’s too late!).
If you don’t want to break the bank to have a good time at the local
nightclubs, go earlier in the evening, before cover charges go into effect.
Yes, you may get there before the hoards of partygoers arrive, but you
can also consider the lack of huge crowds on the dance floor to be a
bonus.
The scoop on Vegas’s hottest clubs
A note of warning to the ladies: These places are major meat markets; so
if you’re not obviously with a date, you may be hit on endlessly. But, hey,
you may be up for that sort of game! (If you want to avoid that and you’re
just into dancing, you may want to check out Gipsy, a predominantly gay
nightspot listed later in this chapter.) A piece of good news for the ladies:
You tend to pay considerably less in cover prices than the men, some-
times nothing at all. 
 Everything about The Bank (in Bellagio, 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; 
% 702-693-8300) is geared towards the high-end clubbing crowd —
the 500 bottles of Crystal that line the entrance, the gold crocodile
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Las Vegas Nightlife 
260

skin on the bar, the couture suits for the staff, and, of course, the
often hefty cover charges. And that’s before you realize that most
of the room is dedicated to ludicrously expensive “bottle tables.”
But the dance floor is hot, the snow machines cool, and it sure is
top of the line. Open Thursday through Sunday, 10:30 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Cover can vary, but should be $30 for men and women are free. 
 Looking for a decadent, slightly Gothic, nook-laiden place to crawl
at night? Try the Hard Rock’s Body English (4455 Paradise Rd.; 
% 702-693-5000), one of the most trendy of the many trendy clubs
in town. Expect long lines and likely being overlooked in favor of
someone with a more famous name and a lower body fat percent-
age if you try to get in. But it’s so glamorous, it’s worth the effort.
Opens Friday through Sun at 10 p.m., and cover varies.
 Want to dance on a boat but can’t help but notice that you are in
the desert? No fear; Caesars Palace has provided Cleopatra’s
Barge Nightclub (3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-731-7110). Yes,
the dance floor (a small one) is on an actual floating barge. No, you
won’t get seasick (although it can be an odd sensation if everyone
is groovin’ at once). It’s pretty nifty. No cover; two-drink minimum.
It’s open nightly from 10:30 p.m. to 4 a.m.
 Jet (in The Mirage, 3400 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-632-7600) is the
sibling of the Bank, even bigger (three dance floors! Four bars!
Multiple levels!), and if a titch less fabulous it’s also more accessi-
ble. Open Friday, Saturday, and Monday from 10:30 p.m. until late.
Cover varies, usually $20 and up.
 Speaking of big, nothing is as big as the 40,000 square foot Pure
(3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-731-7110). Caesars Palace took a
space that used to house a combination magic club and theater,
and turned it into the largest nightclub on the Strip. It’s all white —
get it? — and styled in such a way that, size notwithstanding, all the
action is sort of right in your face. Escape how big and loud it is by
heading to the rooftop club with amazing views of the city. Open
Friday through Tuesday 10:30 p.m. to dawn. Cover varies, though
we mean that literally.
 But you want to know what is the hottest club in town, right now.
We would tell you if we could. (It is our job, after all.) These things
change in an instant. Still, at this writing, it’s probably LAX at the
Luxor (3900 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 800-288-1000). Huge like sibling
club Pure (though still only about half the size of that behemoth),
it’s an explosive combo of red and dark, confined and spacious,
Gothic and electric. Also, Christina Aguilera is one of the investors.
If it’s good enough for her! Wednesday to Saturday, 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,
but figure it starts at $20 and goes up from there. 
 Tao (in the Venetian, 3355 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-388-8588) is
styled as a Buddhist temple — because nothing says serenity and
nirvana like a big loud noisy multi-level club with a really high
cover charge — and it’s where all the celebrity entourages are
Chapter 17: Bars, Stars, and Gee-tars: Las Vegas at Night 261

heading. Open Thursday through Saturday at 10 p.m. until dawn.
Cover varies.
 Unless, of course, they are still going to Rain in the Palms Hotel &
Casino (4321 W. Flamingo Rd.; % 702-942-7788), the former single
hottest club in Vegas. It’s the kind of place where Britney will do an
impromptu show — or, at least, the kind of place where rumors fly
that Britney did an impromptu show — and it has everything such
a club needs (smoke, light and fire effects, booming sound system,
go-go dancers in stripper boots, various floors and levels). It must
be working. People line up for hours for a chance to plead their
way in. It’s open Thusday from 11 p.m. and Friday and Saturday
from 10 p.m. and usually closes when the sun comes up. Cover
varies but it’s usually $20 and up (sometimes way up).
 But our choice of club is Prive and the Living Room in Planet
Hollywood (3667 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 492-3960). Doing away with
the various gilded barricades that keep the hoi polloi away from
the precious VIP’s, this club allows free access by anyone to any-
where, going so far to encourage attendees to dance on all the fur-
niture. Their dress code is virtually non-existent, ensuring a more
eclectic clientele. Toss in a two-story fireplace, movie screens with
Godzilla flicks and an amphitheatre style set up, and it’s a party we
don’t want to leave. Unless it’s to chill a bit in the couch-, rug- and
chandelier-bestrewn annex the Living Room. Monday, Friday,
Saturday 10 p.m.–4 a.m. Cover: $20 for women, $30 for men.
 A hot club in all sense of the words is rumjungle in Mandalay Bay
(3950 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-632-7408). If you build it, they will
come. In this case, “it” means a fire-wall entrance that gives way to a
wall of water; a bar holding hundreds of bottles of rum, each lit by a
laser; dancing go-go girls; dueling congo drummers; grilled Brazilian
food served on swordlike skewers; and live smoking world music. The
crowds here start at 10 p.m., and it stays packed until, well, we can’t
stay up that late anymore. The cover is $10 to $20 after 10:30 p.m.
 The first incarnation of Wynn Las Vegas’ own nightclub didn’t work
out, so here’s the second attempt. We quite like the name, but it
remains to be seen if Tryst (3131 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-770-
3375) will succeed where its predecessor did not. Look for a more
subtle crowd than at some of the other over-the-top venues listed
here — after all, this is called “Tryst,” not “Hook-up!” Open
Thursday through Sunday 10 p.m. to dawn. Cover varies.
 You’ve read the book and seen the movie, now come to the re-
creation of New York’s legendary Studio 54 in the MGM Grand
Hotel (3799 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-891-1111). Strangely, though
Las Vegas is known as Sin City, this is a downright tame, strictly-
for-tourists kind of place (but if you want to pretend, that’s all right
with us). Tennis shoes, baggy or ripped jeans, and hats (for men or
women) are not allowed. Cover ranges from free for women on cer-
tain nights to upwards of $20 or more depending on what’s happen-
ing. It’s open 10 p.m. to dawn Tuesday through Saturday.

Hanging Out: Las Vegas’s Best Bars
There’s no shortage of places to drink in Las Vegas, whether you’re look-
ing for a sophisticated cocktail or a pitcher of beer. Here are some of our
favorites.
Hip watering holes to hoist a few
If you want your bars to come with personality, you may have to leave
your hotel (in most cases) to search out spots that aren’t generic water-
ing holes. Your reward will be a glimpse of that rapidly vanishing true
Vegas vibe.
 You can start at Champagnes Cafe (3557 S. Maryland Pkwy.; 
% 702-737-1699). This is the sort of place that those hip guys who
made the movie Swingers just worship. It’s so outmoded that it’s
hip again — they just don’t know it (or, worse, think they never 
lost it) — and it serves ice cream shakes spiked with booze. You
don’t get this in a hotel bar.
 On the other hand, the Double Down Saloon (4640 Paradise Rd., at
Naples; % 702-791-5775) knows that it’s hip, but it’s too hip to let
on (if you follow). There’s no flashy décor (unless you count the
“you puke, you clean” sign and the arty graffiti on the walls). Instead,
they let their jukebox — from the Germs and Zappa to Dick Dale
and Reverend Horton Heat — do the talking. Except on Sunday
nights, when the Blue Man Group musicians, incognito, play strictly
instrumental sets. The clientele has included director Tim Burton,
and used to include the late Timothy Leary.
 Back to dated views of hip — at Peppermill’s Fireside Lounge,
inside the Peppermill Coffee Shop (2985 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; 
% 702-735-7635), romance is provided by a water and fire pit, a
piece of kitsch that you probably thought had gone the way of the
dodo bird. Those basketball-size drinks will put you into a stupor,
after which the plush, cozy booths support you in womblike com-
fort until you feel (if you ever do) like moving on. Many don’t —
this is one of the last places that feels like genuine Vegas, as
opposed to a prefab nightclub. 
 Our snippy comment about generic hotel bars notwithstanding,
there are a few hotel bars worth seeking out — heck, even the
locals do! Some are actually housed in restaurants, including a few
in the Mandalay Bay (3950 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 877-632-7000 or
702-632-7000). Aureole has a four-story glass wine tower, and bot-
tles are fetched by comely young ladies wearing “Peter Pan”–style
harnesses that whisk them up and down as they fetch the bottle of
a patron’s choosing. The bar in the front facing the wine tower has
become a nighttime hangout, with people ordering obscure wines
just to send the damsels as high up as they can. You can keep your
drink nicely chilled all night long on the ice bar, created by water
freshly poured and frozen daily at Red Square. Or join the locals
Chapter 17: Bars, Stars, and Gee-tars: Las Vegas at Night 263

who feel the blues late at night at the small, bottle-cap-bedecked
bar in the corner of the House of Blues restaurant.
 There’s also the Viva Las Vegas Lounge at the Hard Rock Hotel
(4455 Las Vegas Blvd. S.), which looks like a nothing little bar but is
usually jumping late with locals — and at any time when traveling
rock musicians are in town for a gig.
 Strip clubs have always been a staple of Vegas nightlife, so it’s sur-
prising that it’s taken the hotels this long to capitalize on it. No, no,
they aren’t opening up topless bars in place of the theme parks; but
several resorts have added nightspots that feature regular bur-
lesque shows, which is really just a high-class synonym for “strip
show.” The style may be considerably higher, but the amount of
skin not remarkably less. The cost? About the same, because the
point is to not let the nice gentlemen’s money go elsewhere. The
best show is probably found at the justly extremely popular 40
Deuce (in Mandalay Bay, 2950 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-632-7000;
www.fortydeuce.com) — don’t expect to get near the place on the
weekends or, once inside, get much of a look at the girlie action.
Nearly as good is the frisky and risqué display put on at the
Pussycat Dolls Lounge (in Caesars Palace, 3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S.;
% 702-731-8323; nightly shows starting at 8:30 p.m., cover varies),
which almost certainly will not feature members of the group. Less
fabulous, but still worth checking out, is Tangerine (open Tues–Sat
10 p.m.–4 a.m.; outside bar also open Sun–Mon 5 p.m.–midnight; in
TI at the Mirage, 3300 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-894-7111; cover
varies), as long as you aren’t afraid of the color of sorbet. Oh, right;
you probably won’t be looking at the décor. 
 After about 9 p.m., the Monte Carlo Pub & Brewery, in the Monte
Carlo Resort (3770 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-730-7777), gets loud
and hopping thanks to live entertainment of varying kinds and rock
videos blaring forth from 40 monitors, not to mention the micro-
brewery and a cigar bar. For similar action, check out Main Street
Station Triple 7 Brew Pub (100 Main St.; % 702-387-1896) inside
downtown’s Main Street Station. In addition to the microbrewery,
which has a good selection of ales, there’s a sushi bar, an oyster
bar, a grill, and two grand pianos where someone tickles the ivories
nightly. It looks kind of yuppie-like (San Francisco Postmodern
Warehouse), but it’s also a bit of a break from claustrophobic,
hemmed-in drinking joints.
 One of the other few good options for downtown nightlife, the
rowdy Hogs & Heifers (201 N. 3rd St. between Ogden and Stewart,
one block from the Fremont Street Experience; % 702-676-1457; no
cover) is a prefab version of the NYC bar that started the whole
dancing-waitresses-on-the-bar gimmick. Bikers and beer, though: a
reliable combination that explains why this place is often such a
fun scene.
 The terrifyingly chic ghostbar, in the Palms Resort & Casino (4321
W. Flamingo Rd., just west of the Strip; % 702-942-7778), attracts the
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Las Vegas Nightlife 
264

young and the beautiful, who gaze out at the less-blessed with cool
indifference. Witness it for yourself or read about their antics in the
next day’s gossip columns. Cover varies, usually $20 and up.
 So there’s this guy, Rande Gerber, who you may know if you read US
magazine, because he’s married to Cindy Crawford. Or you may
know him because he designs all the best bars in all the best cities,
like SkyBar in Los Angeles. He’s got one in Vegas — okay, actually
it’s out in Henderson. Whiskey Bar is so fabulous, and so are the
people who go (more famous characters tend to go there because
it’s out of the way) that they’ve provided mattress and giant pillows
to cushion your fall when you swoon from all the wonder and glory
of being there. You can find Whiskey Bar at the Green Valley Ranch
Resort in Henderson, Just off I-215 about 10 minutes from The Strip
(2300 Paseo Verde Pkwy.; % 702-221-6560). Open daily at 8 p.m.
until “late.” Cover varies but is usually $10 and up.
 And then there is the scene at Coyote Ugly in New York-New York
(3790 Las Vegas Blvd. S., at Tropicana; % 702-740-6969) — yes, a
branch of the bar made famous by the movie: the place where
nubile bartenders stuffed into tight-fitting garments strut their stuff
on bar tops, whipping the crowd into a hootin’, hollerin’ frenzy and
dousing them with liquids if they begin to have too much fun. We
really, really want to look down on this sort of behavior, but we’re
too busy whooping it up. Open daily from 6 p.m. until 4 a.m. Cover
varies, usually $10 and up on weekends.
 Tabu in the MGM Grand (3799 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-891-7183).
Possibly the coolest (despite the silly name) of the “ultra-lounges”
(just a way to make adults think they are getting more for their
money). It’s open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 p.m. until late.
Cover varies but usually $10 and up.
Cool clubs for the special-interest set
Not everyone wants to spend the night bumping and grinding to the
latest in hip-hop; and if you fall into that category, don’t worry. Some
Vegas clubs cater to specific groups, including college students, busi-
nessmen, blues aficionados, and those looking for a less frenetic atmos-
phere than the average club offers.
 If you’re hankering for the blues, you will find plenty of it at the
stripped-down Sand Dollar Blues Lounge (3355 Spring Mountain at
Polaris; % 702-871-6651). It’s funky and friendly, with a mix of
locals and tourists; and it’s completely free of any theme (aside
from blues bands), trend, or neon (unless you count beer signs).
Doesn’t that mean they should bulldoze it and put up a blues-
themed amusement park? Live blues (and sometimes zydeco)
bands play nightly. Cover is usually around $5 when a band is play-
ing. Open 24 hours.
 And Parrot Heads, you are not forgotten. Your avatar, Jimmy Buffett,
has opened up a branch of his Magaritaville (in The Flamingo, 3555
Chapter 17: Bars, Stars, and Gee-tars: Las Vegas at Night 265

Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-733-3302) bar and restaurant. Live music,
booze, and merchandise are the key components here. Open daily
11 a.m. until 2 a.m.; no cover except on special events.
 Looking for a bar that’s a bar? As in, a place with bartenders who
know how to pour a real cocktail? And by real cocktail you don’t
mean some liquor with a shot of Red Bull in it? The answer is
Petrossian (in Bellagio, 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-693-7111),
where the bartenders know that martinis are made with vermouth
and that grown ups are happy to drink them and have some grown-
up snacks (we’re talking Beluga caviar and the like) along with
them. And, it must be admitted, pay grown-up prices for the privi-
lege. No one said educated sophistication comes cheap. 
A view to kill for
Few cities have a skyline as unique and beautiful as Vegas’s, especially
when night falls. Paris may be called the City of Lights, but nowadays, it
has nothing on Vegas. For a perfect end to a day in Sin City, nothing
beats a nightcap at a lounge that provides a panoramic view of the city.
 Ready to test your vertigo? The most memorable view in town is
the nighttime vista from the Top of the World Lounge on the 107th
floor of the Stratosphere Tower (2000 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-
380-7711). It costs $9 to get up there, and drinks can be pricey; but
it’s an undeniable thrill to sip a martini while gazing down at the
sea of neon spread out before you. The lounge, like the restaurant
directly below, revolves slowly; so give yourself an hour to make a
360-degree trip around the city. Live entertainment plays nightly
and a DJ takes over at midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. It’s open
daily, 4 p.m. until the wee hours.
 If you want a drop in price and height, take the elevator in the Polo
Towers to the Sky Lounge (3745 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-261-
1000). Sure, it’s not the Stratosphere’s view, or even the one from
Paris’s Eiffel Tower. But it’s still pretty high up and pretty spectacu-
lar, especially at night; and all it costs you is a drink. Gaze and linger.
It’s open from 8:30 a.m. until they feel like kicking everyone out.
 If you want to look down on the rest of the world, like a true
Parisian, try the Eiffel Tower Bar in Paris Las Vegas (3655 Las
Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-948-6937). The bar is located in the restau-
rant on the 11th floor of the hotel’s half-size replica of the City of
Lights’ most famous landmark. It’s cool and sophisticated. Bar
hours are daily from 11 a.m. until 11:30 p.m. No cover or minimum.
 Voodoo Lounge, on the top of the Rio (3700 W. Flamingo Rd.; 
% 702-252-7777), offers a different view perspective, since it’s
located a short distance off the Strip. It also is a fun and funky
place, with touches of juju here and there, plus a grand, multi-level
outdoor patio for true view gazing. It’s open 5 p.m. until 3 a.m., and
the cover varies.

Root, root, root for the home team
The Sports Books at the major casinos are some of the best places to
watch the latest sports action, but you can also find some other great
places to catch a game. (If you think lap dancing is a sport, check out
“Showing Some Skin: Sin City’s Best Strip Joints,” later in this chapter.)
 A venture by music mogul Jay Z., the 40/40 Club in the Palazzo
(3325 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-638-4040) functions as a sports
book most of the time, but out-glams all others in town — after all,
it’s the only one that morphs into a hip-hop club on weekend nights.
During the week, you can sprawl in a gleaming space littered with
couches and gaze at dozens of flat screen TVs showing all manner of
sporting events while noshing on bar food. Open Monday to Friday
5 p.m. to 5 a.m. and Saturday to Sunday noon to 5 a.m. 
 ESPN Sports Zone in New York-New York (3790 Las Vegas Blvd. S.;
% 702-933-3776) isn’t exactly the place to go for a romantic rende-
vous. But if you and your honey — or just your buddies — want to
scream and shout at your home team, or anyone’s team, come to
here for a rowdy good time. A bank of monitors blare every sport
programmers can air, and screens at booths (there is a moderately
priced menu of delicious junk food) allow you to choose which
screen you watch, or even surf some Internet sets. It’s noisy and
strangely fun. It’s open weekdays from 11 a.m. and weekends from 
8 a.m. until “late.”
 Another cool sports spot is Winning Streaks in Harrah’s Las Vegas
(3475 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; % 702-369-5000). Although it is more
restaurant than bar, it’s open to the casino and has a parade of tele-
visions, yummy hamburgers, and some tasty specialty drinks. It’s
open 24 hours, 7 days a week.
Stepping Out: The Gay and Lesbian Scene
Boys will be boys and girls will be girls, especially at the following
places. Note: It doesn’t matter which you prefer, as most of the gay bars
in town are straight-friendly (some lesbians also frequent these bars due
to the lack of lesbian bars in town). For nongays who like to dance but
don’t want to get hassled by the opposite sex all night, these are good
spots for hanging out.
 The first gay bar on the Strip — can you believe it? — Krave does
pointedly style itself an “alternative” club, which brings in a slightly
more mixed crowd than you may find at the ones listed below. The
high rent address means a fancier interior, but with prices and
other problems to match. Still, it’s also considerably easier to get 
to than other boy bars, so it all works out. It’s open daily except
Monday from 8 p.m. until late; after hours until dawn Friday and
Saturday. At Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino, 3667 Las Vegas Blvd.
Chapter 17: Bars, Stars, and Gee-tars: Las Vegas at Night 267

S. (entrance on Harmon Ave.; % 702-836-0830; www.kravelas
vegas.com). Cover varies.
 Thanks to recent remodeling, longtime favorite Gipsy (4605
Paradise Rd.; % 702-731-1919) once again reigns supreme. It still
has everything that made it popular for so long, including dancing,
go-go boys, and shows. The interior sports plenty of glass and
marble, and the dance floor has an odd Indiana Jones look. Most
nights you pay a cover charge of at least $5. You can find it just
south of Harmon Road. The Gipsy usually opens around 10 p.m. and
closes whenever it feels like it — usually after the sun comes up.
 Right across the street is Free Zone (610 E. Naples St.; % 702-794-
2300), a neighborhood-style bar with videos and the like. The club
sports a dance floor with a really loud sound system and a game
room that features video poker and billiards. Weekly theme nights
include karaoke, drag shows, and male strippers. There’s no cover
or drink minimum.
 The leather-and-Levis crowd can go to The Buffalo (4640 Paradise
Rd.; % 702-733-8355), which is open 24 hours and often has beer
busts and leather events. There’s no cover, drinks are cheap, and
you can try your hand at billiards, darts, and the ever-present
video poker.
 If you’re looking for something a little more cozy, try Good Times
(1775 E. Tropicana Ave.; % 702-736-9494), a quiet neighborhood
bar with a small dance floor. The 24-hour spot has no cover charge.
It’s located in the same complex as the Liberace Museum, after
which you may need a stiff drink.
For more information on what’s going on in gay Las Vegas during your
visit, pick up a copy of the Las Vegas Bugle (% 702-369-6260), a free
gay-oriented newspaper that’s available at any of the places described in
the preceding list. For online information on the gay nightlife scene, surf

Showing Some Skin: Sin 
City’s Best Strip Joints
Welcome to Decadence Central. Sex is a major industry in Las Vegas — it
isn’t nicknamed Sin City for nothing — and on an evening’s stroll down
the Strip, you’re likely to have dozens of flyers advertising a strip of a dif-
ferent sort shoved at you. If you have even the slightest interest in view-
ing naked or semi-naked women dancing and prancing onstage, you hit
the jackpot. There are numerous topless or totally nude strip bars from
which to choose. Some are actually clean, respectable establishments —
if, of course, your idea of respectability includes half-naked women. The
most prominent ones are generally the safest and nicest of the bunch.
You can find seedier places in this town — but then you’re on your own.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Las Vegas Nightlife 
268

Keep in mind that in Las Vegas proper, topless bars can serve alcohol
but all-nude clubs can’t. Only the Palomino, an all-nude joint in North
Las Vegas, is allowed to serve stiff drinks (the exception due to a grand-
father clause in the Clark County ban). The rules and regulations vary
from club to club, so be sure to ask at the door if you want to stay out of
trouble. In general, note that touching the dancers in a strip club is usu-
ally forbidden. Some clubs, however, allow a restrained bit of physical
interaction between clients and dancers.
 Featured in that masterpiece of bad cinema, Showgirls, Cheetah’s
(2112 Western Ave.; % 702-384-0074) is a clean, jovial place where
many in the young party set hang out. Sure, it has a bit of a frat-
house atmosphere, but you’re likely to see some couples here
having a bit of fun. Feel free to order up a table or couch dance.
There’s a $20 cover charge after 8 p.m., and the club is open 24
hours. (Go to Western Avenue just east of I-15, and the club is
between Sahara and Charleston Avenues.)
 One of the best of the strip joints, Club Paradise (4416 Paradise Rd.,
just north of Flamingo Rd.; % 702-734-7990) is a glitzy spot that
attracts an upscale white-collar crowd, with bright lighting, a plush
interior, champagne, and cigars. Oh, and topless dancers. Can’t
forget that. The dancers, called “actual centerfolds,” are more likely
to be cosmetically enhanced than in the other establishments. Hours
are Monday through Friday from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. and Saturday and
Sunday from 6 p.m. until 8 a.m. There’s a $30 cover charge.
 A perfect place for the merely curious, Glitter Gulch (20 Fremont
St.; % 702-385-4774) is something of a downtown landmark located
smack dab in the heart of the Fremont Street Experience. The club
is open daily from 1 p.m. to 4 a.m. You don’t have to pay a cover
charge, but there is a two-drink minimum (drinks start at $7.75).
 The large, two-story Palomino (1848 Las Vegas Blvd. N.; % 702-642-
2984) boasts a bunch of stages, semi-private rooms, and total nudity.
Thanks to weekend male stripper performances, it’s gotten to be a
hangout for women. It’s a straight shot up Las Vegas Boulevard (the
Strip) past downtown, but it takes 15 to 25 minutes, depending on
traffic. It’s open daily from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m., and there’s a $15 to
$30 cover charge depending on when you go.
 Sapphires is the largest strip club in the world. Someone has to be.
How big? 70,000 square feet. Four stages. Hundreds of girls. (Not all
at once, of course!) It’s too big to be intimate, which probably elimi-
nates any hope of a serious thrill, but it’s also a safe and well
designed exposure to some naughty Vegas fun. (It looks suspi-
ciously like the interior of Rain, but this club is actually quieter.) It
must be seen to be believed — at least, that’s the excuse we’ll give
you. (3025 S. Industrial Rd.; % 702-796-0000). It’s open 24 hours,
and there’s a $20 cover after 6 p.m.

experience. This area of the book is where we feed you some
fun information, just to give you some interesting topics of

ﬁnd out about some of Las Vegas’s great claims to fame and
also discover some interesting facts about institutions that

to Fame

 Introducing Las Vegas’s biggest boasts
 Discovering that some things truly need to be seen to be believed
C
onsidering the city’s reputation for doing things bigger — if not 
necessarily better — than anywhere else, it should come as no sur-
prise that Vegas has secured a few spots in the Guinness Book of World
Records. If this city loves anything, it’s a challenge; right now, some new
project is probably in the works that will eventually end up on Vegas’s
roster of larger-than-life achievements.
Lighting Up the Sky
It used to be that the Great Wall of China was the only man-made struc-
ture that could be seen with the naked eye from outer space. Naturally, it
was only a matter of time before Vegas aspired to reach such stellar
heights (although one wonders how long it will be before they attempt
to “do” the Great Wall as a theme hotel), and it succeeded. From the top
of the pyramid of the Luxor shines the world’s brightest beam of light —
using it, you would be able to read a newspaper while you’re 10 miles in
space. What a beam of light has to do with a pyramid we don’t know, but
you can see it from the space shuttle, so that’s that. (Then again, it
seems a recent Chinese astronaut said he could not actually see the
Great Wall from space after all, and now China is going to delete that fun
fact from the schoolbooks.)
Wide-Open Spaces
As if having the world’s biggest light beam were not enough, the Luxor is
also home to the planet’s largest indoor atrium! Housed inside the
hotel’s 36-story pyramid, the atrium measures 29 million cubic feet. You
could fit nine jumbo jets inside the pyramid — if you wanted to, that is.

Larger Than Life
Following the bigger-is-better theory (a much cherished ideal in this
town), it’s only natural that Las Vegas is home to the second largest
hotel in the world — at least in terms of number of rooms. The holder of
this distinction is the appropriately named MGM Grand. It has 5,034
rooms, in case you’re counting. And to put this number in perspective,
think of this: It would take a person 13 years and 8 months to sleep one
night in each of the hotel’s rooms. If you stacked all the beds in those
rooms up, the resulting tower would be ten times higher than the Empire
State Building — the real one, not the one across the street.
No Room — Ha!
Okay, that may not be true — there have been numerous occasions
where the odds of hitting it big on the craps tables were better than get-
ting a room in Las Vegas, but that isn’t due to lack of space. The city has
more hotel rooms than any other — more than 150,000 at last count.
And by the end of 2010, you’ll be able to tack on more than 10,000 more
places to park yourself while resting up for the next round of blackjack.
Money Is No Object
You can’t accuse Vegas of cheapening out on the luxury hotel 
experience — okay, you can in some cases, but that’s a totally different
chapter — because it’s home to the most expensive hotel ever built.
Wynn Las Vegas cost an eye-popping $2.7 billion and that’s just for
phase one — another $2 billion went towards an encore, named Encore
that opened in 2008. And yet, that all pales compared to MGM-Mirage’s
CityCenter the most expensive privately funded construction project
ever and the largest single development in Las Vegas history. It’s a
hotel/residential/entertainment complex that sprawls over more than 60
acres (requiring its own people mover!) and will cost anywhere from $9
to $11 billion. That’s a lot of quarters!
Reach for the Sky
Move over, Seattle Space Needle. Las Vegas is home to the tallest build-
ing west of the Mississippi. The Stratosphere checks in at 1,149 feet,
which also makes it the tallest observation tower in the United States.
It’s also home to the world’s highest thrill rides. Hope you don’t have
vertigo.

Going to the Chapel
Paris may have a better reputation for romance, but no city in the world
hosts as many weddings as Las Vegas. Each year, more than 100,000 cou-
ples enter the bonds of holy matrimony here — and they call it Sin City!
It doesn’t get more romantic in Vegas than on Valentine’s Day, when
more people marry here than anywhere else on the planet.
Reeling in the Dough
Las Vegas makes really big bucks! More than 85 percent of all visitors to
the city spend at least some time courting Lady Luck. The amount of
money spent annually on gambling in Vegas totals more than the gross
national product of several small countries combined. In 2005, visitors
spent more than $40 billion in Vegas overall, $10 billion of it gambling —
yes, that’s billion.
Just Visiting
Those Super Bowl commercials may have you believing that everyone 
is heading for Walt Disney World (and we concede that they get more
kids), but Vegas, the city that has been called an “adult’s Disneyland,”
gets more visitors annually than all US theme parks combined! More
than 39 million souls made a pilgrimage here in 2007. And you wonder
why there’s no elbow room at the craps tables?
A Golden Moment
Forget about Fort Knox. Head to Las Vegas if you want to see the world’s
largest gold nugget on display. The “Hand of Faith” nugget was discov-
ered in Australia in 1980. The nugget currently resides at the Golden
Nugget (where else?) in downtown Vegas, weighing in at 61 pounds, 
11 ounces.
Chapter 18: Ten Las Vegas Claims to Fame 275

Chapter 19
Ten (Or So) Las Vegas
Institutions That 
Are No More
In This Chapter
 Disappearing hotels
 A legend lives on
I
t would be hard to imagine New York City ever razing the Plaza
(entirely redoing the inside, sure), or Paris tearing down the Ritz, but
Las Vegas has brought down many of its historic landmarks without so
much as a toodle-oo. Heck, by the 1990s, the city was promoting the
destruction as a tourist attraction — at least if they had to go, they went
out in style. Here’s a list of just a few of the oldies but goodies that got
lost during the Strip’s endless makeover.
El Rancho Vegas
Built in 1941, the El Rancho was the first hotel resort ever built on the
Strip — not Bugsy Siegel’s Flamingo, as many people mistakenly assume.
Its success launched a building boom on the Strip, a movement that is
still going strong today. Alas, the hotel was destroyed by a fire in 1960
and was never rebuilt; all that’s left of it is a big vacant lot at the corner
of Sahara and Las Vegas Boulevard South.
The Other El Rancho Hotel
Not to be confused with the El Rancho Vegas, this place actually started
out in the 1940s as the Thunderbird hotel before being renamed the El
Rancho in 1982 after a series of ownership changes. Standing right
across from Circus Circus, it closed in 1992 and remained empty and
decaying until 2000, when it was purchased by Turnberry Place, the new
$600-million condo development right behind it (just opposite the Las

Vegas Hilton). The company says that it will probably partner with a
casino developer and build something there, but for now, it just wants to
demolish the graffiti-covered buildings.
Dunes
A Strip fixture since the 1950s, the Dunes’ claim to fame is that it was
first to host that most Vegas of art forms, the topless showgirl review (in
1957). Purchased by former Mirage owner Steve Wynn in 1992, the
Dunes at least got a proper Vegas sendoff. In 1993, more than 200,000
spectators watched as the Dunes imploded and its famous neon sign
exploded amid a fireworks display that set Wynn back more than a mil-
lion dollars. Wynn then spent more than a billion dollars putting up the
Bellagio in its place.
Sands
This legendary spot made its debut on the Strip in 1952, but it is most
famous for hosting the “Summit Meeting” of the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra,
Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis, Jr.) in 1960. No show
ticket since has been as hard to come by. Renowned for its entertain-
ment, the Sands helped boost Las Vegas’s reputation as a happening
town. The hotel was reduced to a 30-foot-high pile of rubble in 1996 to
make way for the Venetian, which memorialized the Sands by naming its
convention center for it.
Hacienda
Another old-timer that went out with a bang, the Hacienda opened in
1956 and quickly became a Strip favorite. Known for its friendly service
and old-style character, it simply couldn’t compete with the mega-
resorts that sprang up along the Strip in the 1990s. Hundreds of thou-
sands came out to say goodbye to the hotel when it was blown up on
New Year’s Eve 1997 to make way for Mandalay Bay.
The Old Aladdin
Following the tradition of the Hacienda and the Sands, the Aladdin went
up (or down, if you want to be picky) in smoke in 1998. Built in 1963, the
Aladdin had major history behind it — Elvis married Priscilla here in
1967. Caught up in financial problems, management finally decided to
ditch the old resort and replace it with a new and improved — and 
more expensive — version. The new Aladdin opened on the site of the
old one in August 2000, promptly went bankrupt, and was redone as
Planet Hollywood.
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Las Vegas Institutions That Are No More 277

Vegas World
More notorious than famous, Vegas World sprang from the imagination
of the casino maverick Bob Stupak, a PR master determined to take
guests for every dollar he could — he was eventually fined by the casino
commission for false advertising. Calling the hotel a money pit would
have been kind. As a marketing ploy, Stupak started building a large
tower next to the hotel as a tourist attraction, but it went bankrupt and
was forced to sell out to Grand Casinos. Cutting its losses, the new
owner stuck with the tower — today’s Stratosphere hotel — and demol-
ished Vegas World.
Desert Inn
When Mirage Resorts was acquired by MGM Grand in the spring of
2000, Steve Wynn went looking for a new hotel to revamp. He settled on
the Desert Inn. The venerable Strip contender had been losing money
for a while, but, unlike many of its mega-resort competitors, it had class.
With more than 50 years on the Strip, the historic hotel was home to
Howard Hughes for most of the ’60s. It gained major fame as the main
setting for the ’70s television show Vega$. On October 23, 2001, the
hotel’s Augusta Tower was spectacularly imploded to make way for the
Wynn Las Vegas luxury resort, which cost an unprecedented $2.7 billion
to construct.
Elvis
Okay. He isn’t a hotel; but with all due respect to the King, he is a Las
Vegas institution that did blow up there toward the end. And, like the
Strip hotels that continue to re-create major landmarks and themes,
Vegas is awash in Elvis impersonators who copy the legend — and with
the same degrees of success. From his marriage to Priscilla in 1967 to his
sold-out stints at the Las Vegas Hilton, Elvis did as much to promote the
city as any hotel. Elvis may have left the building, but his presence is
very much alive in Sin City.

Top Ten Vegas Values

 Getting tips from a budget guru

 Enjoying entertainment on the cheap
W
ith literally hundreds of options to choose from, Las Vegas visi-
tors often find themselves struggling to distinguish between the
real deals and the come-ons. While many great values are available in
Bargain City, a few stand out above the others.
Anthony Curtis, publisher of the highly recommended Las Vegas Advisor
newsletter, has long been considered the leading consumer advocate for
Las Vegas visitors. Visit his Web site at www.LasVegasAdvisor.com to
find current information on Las Vegas shows, buffets, coupons, and good
deals. You will also want to check out the free Las Vegas “Question of the
Day” and the current Top Ten, updated monthly. 
Note: The deals that follow have all stood the test of time and have a
good chance of being there when you are. However, there’s never any
guarantee in Vegas — and that’s not just with gambling — so it’s possi-
ble that some of the following bargains will no longer be available by the
time you get to Sin City. Call first to avoid disappointment (and check
the Las Vegas Advisor Web site for alternatives). 
Steak Dinner, Ellis Island, $6.95
Carrying on the tradition of the legendary Las Vegas bargain steak din-
ners is the 10-ounce “filet-cut” sirloin at Ellis Island Casino & Brewery
(4178 Koval Lane; % 702-733-8901). This complete dinner comes with
choice of soup or salad, baked potato, vegetable, dinner rolls, and an
Ellis Island micro-brewed beer for just $6.95. Though it’s available 24
hours a day, seven days a week in the cafe, you won’t see this great
dinner listed on the menu; you have to ask for it.

Shrimp Cocktail, Golden Gate, 99¢–$1.99
The Golden Gate hotel and casino downtown (1 E. Freemont St.; % 702-
385-1906) has been home to the best shrimp cocktail in Las Vegas since
1959. Its price was 50¢ for more than 30 years, until it was raised to 99¢.
The price was recently raised again to $1.99, but the size of the shrimp
was also upgraded. And here’s the good news: You can get the 99¢ price
simply by joining the casino’s players club, which is free. The Golden
Gate serves nearly two tons of shrimp per week in an old-fashioned
sundae glass (not plastic).
No cost-reducing lettuce or celery fillers here; just shrimp (coldwater
Bay variety) and the golden Gate’s “secret” cocktail sauce. It’s available
seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. in the deli at the rear of the
casino.
Fremont Street Experience, Downtown, Free
It’s a close call for the town’s best free spectacle, and in a huge survey of
nearly 3,000 voters at LasVegasAdvisor.com, the Bellagio fountains
nudged out the Fremont Street Experience with 46 percent of the vote to
45 percent. But don’t think that means you should skip the downtown
light show. With 12.5 million light-emitting diodes supplying the over-
head images, the crooning-canopy show runs five times per night, begin-
ning when it gets dark.
Cravings Buffet, Mirage, $13.95–$24.95
The “gourmet buffet” has become the favorite with most smorgy afi-
cionados, and the best value in the gourmet group is found at the
Mirage. Priced well compared to the city’s other top-shelf buffets,
Cravings is distinguished by its great Asian station, featuring dim sum
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Lots of high-quality selections here,
including a loaded antipasto bar; carving, Middle Eastern, and barbecue
stations; specialty soups (bouillabaisse, egg drop, pho); and excellent
desserts. In the end, the Mirage remains the best-value gourmet super-
buffet, with the highest quality and lowest prices among Las Vegas’ best
spreads.
The Comedy Stop, Tropicana, $19.95
With Las Vegas shows going distinctly upscale, it’s getting tougher to
find a true bargain outside of the lounges and free shows. One exception
is “The Comedy Stop” at the Tropicana. Three comedians, 75 minutes of
entertainment, and one drink — all for $19.95 inclusive. Not only is it the
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
280

lowest-priced show in town, but you can get $5 off by presenting an
easy-to-locate coupon that runs in many of the freebie magazines.
Ham & Eggs, Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, $2.99
The giant ham and eggs breakfast comes with a cover-the-plate ham
steak, two eggs, hash browns, and toast. It’s served 24 hours a day, 7
days week, and has been for more than a decade. If you don’t feel like
standing in the usual long line, check the 20-seat counter, where seats
turn over quickly.
Hot Dog, South Point, 75¢
The best hot dog in Las Vegas is served from a cart near the Sports
Book at the South Point. This all-beef dog is a good one, but it’s the
extras that set it apart. Load your dog with mustard, onions, relish, and
sauerkraut, all for the base price of 75¢.
Funbook, Stratosphere, Free
The best funbook in town is available at the Stratosphere. It comes with
three strong gambling coupons that give players an expected win of just
above $20, plus other discounts throughout the resort. You can get one
per week with a valid ID, out-of-state or local.
Prime Rib, California, $7.25
The long-running prime-time special in the downtown California’s coffee
shop (12 Ogden Ave.; % 702-385-1222) is still just $7.25. The prime rib
comes with an all-you-can-eat salad bar, vegetable, rolls, and cherries
jubilee for dessert. If the lines are long, look for a seat at the big counter.
Hours sometimes change, but this one’s usually available from 4 to 
11 p.m. daily.
Fontana Bar, Bellagio, $6 cover
For a mere $6 (cost of a beer to satisfy the one-drink minimum), you’re
in the middle of the swankiest lounge in town, ready for an evening of
live music, plush surroundings, and the best view possible of the
Bellagio fountain show outside.
Chapter 20: Top Ten Vegas Values 281

Bonus Bargains
Excellent alternatives not quite making the Top Ten include the Mac
King Comedy Magic Show, which is priced well at $27.45, but also offers
entry with a coupon for $9.95; the $7.77 off-the-menu steak and shrimp
in Mr. Lucky’s at the Hard Rock; 24-hour $1.25 draft beer and $2 bottled
imports at Slots-A-Fun (2890 Las Vegas Blvd. S; % 800-354-1232 or
702-734-0410); the famous $3.50 ham & beans at Binion’s, and, of course,

Nevada’s Top Ten 
Desert Denizens
In This Chapter
 Discovering Nevada’s desert dwellers
 Getting to know the good, the bad, the ugly, and the creepy-crawly
T
he Great Basin and the Mojave deserts, which spread across Nevada,
are home to all kinds of creatures that love the dry climate or have
adapted over the years to live here. This chapter presents ten of the
more exotic critters you’re likely to encounter — although not necessar-
ily up close and personally and almost definitely not in your hotel room.
Want to know more? One of the best places to learn about local animal
life is Valley of Fire State Park (55 miles northeast of Las Vegas at exit 75
on Interstate 15), where you can view the desert — and if you’re lucky —
some of the creatures described here in their habitats.
Coyotes
The coyote — a type of wild dog roughly the size of a German shepherd —
is the speedster of the canid species: It can sprint up to 40 miles per hour
and cover several hundred miles in a single night. Coyotes are social,
often traveling in packs, and they’re domestic: They mate for life, and the
pups often hang out with their folks for more than a year. In addition, the
coyote is very intelligent and has a larger, more sophisticated vocabulary
than that of any other type of dog, communicating through growls,
whines, yips, barks, and howls, as well as such body language as tail wag-
ging, lip curling, and mock fighting. The most distinctive of the coyote’s
calls — a series of barks and yelps followed by a drawn-out howl and a
few short, sharp yaps — is used to gather group members together before
or after a hunt. Its verbal nature has earned the coyote the name “song
dog” in several Native American languages. 
These animals keep to themselves during the day, so you may not see
any, but you’re very likely to hear them at night. And, no, coyotes don’t
wear bandanas.

Hummingbirds
These adorable birds flit and hover, helicopter-like, around flowers —
but what they’re actually doing is pigging out. With the highest meta-
bolic rate of any warm-blooded vertebrate, hummingbirds eat all day
long to keep from starving.
Jackrabbits and Desert Cottontails
You’re most likely to see jackrabbits and their cousins, the desert cot-
tontails (the latter’s ears are smaller, and they have cute, fluffy tails),
hopping around at dawn or dusk. Both types are constant noshers; 
they nibble voraciously on a variety of plants, including cacti.
Desert Tortoise
At just 10 to 14 inches long, these guys are surprisingly hard-core. They
can live 80 to 100 years, all the while surviving temperatures ranging
from freezing to more than 140°F by digging burrows into the desert
floor. They can go more than a year without water, getting all of the
moisture they need from the plants they eat. Despite their long lives, it is
thought that they rarely venture more than 2 miles from where they
were born. It is illegal to touch, harm, or collect wild desert tortoises.
Lizards
Small, pinkish, and delicate geckos are notable for the round pads on
their fingers and toes — helpful in climbing the walls, literally. These
lizards are far more common — you may be relieved to hear — than the
two-feet-long, black-and-orange-striped Gila monster. The largest native
lizard in the United States, the Gila monster is the only venomous animal
protected by state law. Don’t be deceived by its placid, sluggish
demeanor; Gila monsters can bite with a vise-like grip. Pick one up, and
you may need to pry it off with a screwdriver, and then head for the
nearest emergency room. Gila monsters aren’t considered deadly to
humans, but you don’t really want to test that theory.
Quails
These chubby, plumed birds tend to cross the road together in family
groups called coveys. The mother quail shepherds her babies on out-
ings. These birds may also turn up on your dinner plate — but I won’t
discuss that here.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
284

Rattlesnakes
Public relations people throughout the Southwest like to point out that
rattlers are present in nearly every state in the United States. However,
said PR people aren’t likely to mention the fact that the Southwest has
more species of rattlesnakes than does any other single region in the
Americas. The good news: Rattlers don’t really want to tussle with you;
that rattling sound means “go away.” Nor do they want to waste venom
on you — you’re too large to kill and eat. If you do get bit, chances are
50/50 that the bite is dry (nonpoisonous). The bottom line: Watch
where you step in the wild, but don’t make yourself miserable with
worry. You’re 20 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to be
bit by a rattlesnake.
Roadrunners
Members of the cuckoo family, these two-foot-long crested birds live
throughout the Southwest. Although they prefer sprinting (at 15 miles an
hour) to flying, they will take flight to avoid fast predators, such as coy-
otes. Roadrunners eat insects, lizards and snakes. They will even devour
rattlesnakes whole.
Scorpions
These miniature lobsters like to hang out in dark, dry spots. All varieties
are nearly invisible in the dark (although they glow under ultraviolet
light). If your shoes have been under your bed all night, shake them out
before sticking your feet back into them. The scorpion’s bite is painful,
but not dangerous. Their sting is venomous, but they only sting humans
in self-defense, and most species’ stings just cause a painful swelling. 
Spiders
Big, hairy tarantulas are the most conspicuous of the desert spiders, but
they’re harmless — honest; some people even keep them as pets. The
spiders you really want to give a wide berth are the much smaller, but
far more poisonous black widows. A black widow spider’s bite can be
deadly, but, fortunately, they’re not aggressive; just don’t go poking your
fingers in their faces or into dark corners. You can recognize the ven-
omous females by the bright red, hourglass-shaped markings on their
chests.

Review-Journal and the Las Vegas Sun.
Both are available at almost every hotel
gift shop. In addition, a variety of free local
Appendix: Quick Concierge 287

magazine publications have information on
local happenings. The most prominent is
What’s On Las Vegas available in hotels
and restaurants throughout the city. For a
totally unbiased and more hip alternative
opinion, try the free weekly papers Las
Vegas Weekly and City Life, both of which
are available at various record and used
clothing stores and the like around town.
Pharmacies
CVS (1360 E. Flamingo Rd. at Maryland
Parkway; % 702-731-5373) is part of a
large national pharmacy chain and is open
24 hours. You can find a Walgreens at 3765
Las Vegas Blvd. S (just north of the MGM
Grand), % 702-739-9345. If you want to
patronize an independent store that is not
part of a chain, try White Cross Drugs
(1700 Las Vegas Blvd. S, just north of the
Stratosphere Tower; % 702-382-1733). The
latter makes deliveries to your hotel if you
so desire.
Police
For emergencies, dial % 911; for non-
emergencies, dial % 702-795-3111.
Post Office
The most convenient post office is near
Circus Circus (3100 Industrial Rd., between
Sahara Ave. and Spring Mountain Rd.; 
% 800-297-5543). It’s open Monday through
Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. You can also
mail letters and packages at your hotel, and
there’s a full-service U.S. Post Office in the
Forum Shops in Caesars Palace.
Restrooms
All the major hotels have public restroom
facilities. They are, for the most part, clean
and safe. Remember not to leave your chil-
dren unattended.
Safety
As long as you stick to well-lit tourist areas,
crime is usually not a major concern.
However, pickpockets who target people
coming out of casinos (or people in the
casinos who are entranced by gambling)
can be a problem. Men should keep wal-
lets well concealed, and women should
keep pocketbooks in sight and secure at
all times. Be warned — thieves tend to be
particularly bold during outdoor shows
such as the Volcano at The Mirage or the
Bellagio Fountain Show. Many hotel rooms
have safes for cash or valuables. If yours
does not, the front desk can offer you a
safety deposit box.
Smoking
This is one of the few places in the United
States where you aren’t exiled to a space
the size of a closet or thrown outside if you
want to light up. Nonsmokers beware:
Smoking is not only permitted inside the
casinos, it runs rampant.
Taxes
Clark County hotel room tax is 9 percent,
and sales tax is 7 percent.
Taxis
Basic fare is $3.30 at the meter drop and
$2.20 for each additional mile, with time
penalties for sitting still and additional
charges for airport runs. Major operators
include Ace (% 702-736-8383), Checker
(% 702-873-2000), Desert (% 702-386-
9102), Henderson (% 702-384-6111), Star
(% 702-873-2000), Western (% 702-736-
8000), Whittlesea (% 702-384-6111), and
Yellow (% 702-873-2000).
Time Zone
Las Vegas is in the Pacific time zone, three
hours earlier than the East Coast (New
York, Florida), two hours earlier than the
Midwest (Iowa, Texas), and one hour ear-
lier than the Mountain states (Colorado,
Wyoming).

Where to Get More Information
If you want more detailed information on attractions, accommodations,
or just about anything else in Las Vegas, you won’t find it difficult to
come by. Check out the following list for some excellent sources for
tourist information, maps, and brochures:
 The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (3150 Paradise
Rd., Las Vegas, NV 89109; % 877-VISITLV or 702-892-7575; www.
visitlasvegas.com) can answer any questions you have and also
send you a comprehensive packet of brochures, a map, a show
guide, an events calendar, and an attractions list. They can also
help you find a hotel that suits your needs and assist you in making
a reservation.
 The Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce (3720 Howard Hughes
Parkway, #100, Las Vegas, NV 89109; % 702-735-1616; www.lv
chamber.com), another great source of local information, offers 
the “Visitor’s Guide,” which contains extensive information about
accommodations, attractions, excursions, children’s activities, and
more. It will answer all your Las Vegas questions, including those
about weddings and divorces.
 The Las Vegas Review Journal (1111 W. Bonanza Rd., P.O. Box 70,
Las Vegas, NV 89125; % 702-383-0211) is the largest paper in town.
Its Neon section has numerous listings for entertainment, dining,
and nightlife. Web-savvy readers should head to its Internet site
(www.lvrj.com), where you will find a variety of pull-down menus
with detailed descriptions of places of interest, such as the best
romantic restaurant, best blackjack tables, best wedding chapel,
and best roller coaster. The Best of the Worst section features such

Las Vegas For Dummies, 5th Edition
292
notables as the slowest stoplight in town and the worst place to
take visitors.
 Another helpful paper, the Las Vegas Weekly, can be picked up in
local shops and restaurants around town. The Web site for this
alternative weekly (www.lasvegasweekly.com) offers reviews of
bars, cafes, nightclubs, restaurants, bookstores, amusement parks,
and shop listings. The dining listings are especially good if you’re
looking for an alternative to the touristy restaurants at the hotels.
 The Web site A2ZLasVegas.com lives up to its name. It’s chock-full
of information on everything from hotels and guided tours to
shows and getting married in Las Vegas. It even keeps tabs on the
status of progressive slot machine jackpots in Nevada. The hotel
and dining reviews feature objective comments and ratings by
fellow visitors.
 Finally, get more information on Las Vegas from these Frommer’s
guidebooks (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.): Frommer’s Las
Vegas, Frommer’s Portable Las Vegas, Frommer’s Irreverent Guide to
Las Vegas, The Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas, and Mini Las Vegas.
Finally, there’s Frommer’s Las Vegas with Kids and Frommer’s
Portable Las Vegas for Non-Gamblers.
