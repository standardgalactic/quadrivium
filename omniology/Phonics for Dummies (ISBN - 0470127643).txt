About the Author
Susan M. Greve has been a reading specialist for 23 years. She taught first
and second grade for four years and has been a publisher, editor, and a read-
ing and curriculum consultant for schools and home-schooling parents.
Susan’s methods of teaching phonics are based on those of Sister Monica
Foltzer, OSU (Order of Saint Ursula), who was a nationally known pioneer in
the field of phonics. Prior to her death in 2001, Sister Monica was a teacher,
guidance counselor, principal, and a reading and curriculum consultant.
Susan was a student of Sister Monica’s at the Institute in Intensive Phonics at
Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio.
In 1997, Susan acquired Sister Monica’s Professor Phonics Systems and 
has published and edited the Professor Phonics series ever since. Her day
job includes her book business and tutoring. Susan developed a reading
assessment test that has been very successful in analyzing reading problems
and helping numerous children and adults. Susan hosts a website, www.
professorphonics.com, and has done phonics workshops across the
country. She was the project manager of the Professor Phonics with Me and 
My Mouse CD-ROM.
Susan attended Mercy School of Nursing, which at the time was affiliated with
Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. She considers her nursing experience a
great aid in helping her assess children with learning weaknesses.
Susan lives in Cincinnati, Ohio, with her husband. She teaches her grand-
children to read and enjoys spending time traveling, sewing, reading, and 
gardening.

Introduction
W
hen the subject of phonics comes up at a PTA luncheon or a family
gathering, I see many parents scratching their heads. My reputation
as a phonics tutor ultimately brings them to approach me with comments
like these:
 “I can read okay, but my spelling is atrocious. Is this because of the way I
learned in grade school?”
 “I never learned from the phonics approach. Maybe that’s why I hate to
read so much.”
 “I was always labeled as one of the slow kids because I had so much
trouble reading. Do you think it was because we didn’t have phonics
training?”
Every one of these parents shares the same fear and desire. They want to
protect their children from the kind of problems they had to endure. And I
give every one of them the same answer: All the children I’ve helped could
master any subject after they caught on to reading.
Most phonics books are written for teachers. This book is for anyone. If you
want to know what phonics is, how to use it, and how important it is in learn-
ing to speak, read, write, and spell, you’ll benefit from this book.
After you understand the value of phonics, you realize how far your — or
your child’s — reading skills can advance. I destroy the myth that phonics
works only for some people and assert that phonics helps 100 percent of the
time. And reading well is the first step to unlocking all the opportunities avail-
able to everyone. Many people think phonics is much more complicated than
it actually is. To put it simply, phonics is merely about sliding sounds of let-
ters together to make words. It’s a science of application and is under the
umbrella of linguistics. Its popularity has grown due to the fact that educa-
tors now acknowledge that learning phonics is of the utmost necessity in
teaching children to read, write, spell, and speak.
The word phonics has become a household word (mostly due to a little voice
on the radio that says “Hooked on Phonics works for me!”). The phonics rev-
olution that began in the last ten years has made many products available,
such as LeapFrog educational games, Reader Rabbit, and Hooked on Phonics,
to name a few. Besides the games, companies develop plenty of TV programs,
CDs, videos, and DVDs for phonics. Even though technology has definitely

narrowed the gap between home and school, the requirements for a good
reader haven’t changed. A good reader is able to recognize words instantly,
has superb word attack skills, comprehends what she’s reading, and applies
her skills on a daily basis. The use of a good phonics program helps to
develop each of these skills to the highest degree.
Phonics For Dummies has attitude: I want to give to you my positive and confi-
dent attitude that you’re up to the task of teaching your child to read through
phonics. I show you that phonics is an essential tool that you can use to help
your child speak, read, write, and spell. And the best part is that you don’t
need a master’s degree to learn phonics or to teach it to someone else.
About This Book
Phonics For Dummies helps you discover that you’re competent to learn or
teach phonics. And better yet, you’re able to teach or learn reading, spelling,
writing, and language to the best of your ability. On first examination, this
book may seem complicated, but never fear: It’s a precise and thorough strat-
egy for becoming an expert in applying phonics to the language arts.
I focus on certain techniques that are the building blocks to a better under-
standing of the English language. These techniques help you or your child
conquer the difficulties in reading or writing. Say goodbye to
 Being a slave to a wild guessing game
 Reading with a lack of expression
 Poor word attack skills
 Slow-paced reading
 Weak comprehension
 Skipping words you can’t read
 Relying on the context to “read” unknown words
 Guessing at words by using pictures
With the help of this book, you can
 Improve reading and spelling skills by going back to square one
 Learn about pronunciation and accent
 Increase your fluency in decoding multisyllable words
 Discover related subject matter and valuable resources
 Polish your skills with practice and application exercises

Phonics For Dummies 

Whether you’re a parent, teacher, or curious adult, you can get as much or as
little out of this book as you want. You can start from the beginning and use
the step-by-step approach, or refer to the Table of Contents or Index to focus
on your own areas of interest. Or just use Phonics For Dummies as a handy
reference guide. Each chapter of the book is like a plug-in unit — you don’t
have to rely on other chapters to understand it.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book defines phonics, which makes it necessary to use some jargon.
Four-year-olds can dig the lingo, so I know that you can, too. It’s stuff like,
“Breve means short,” “Macron’s long,” “Define a consonant,” and, “Where
does the accent belong?” As you read through this book, you use words like
diphthong and umlaut as regularly as a linguistic professor. I believe that
vocabulary grows in people who use it wisely from birth on. The same goes
for using symbols, known as diacritical marks, when learning to read. You
and your child can find great delight when looking up a word in the dictio-
nary and exclaiming, “See the schwa! No accent on that syllable!” In the long
run, this know-how puts kids ahead and helps in future dictionary work.
The other conventions that look bizarre are sentences or headings that start
with lowercase letters. Some examples are: ing, er, ed, sh, nk, i, wh, u, and so
on. These odd letter combinations are italicized so that you can spot them
easily. Because they’re the heart of the book, you see them everywhere.
Because this book may be used by a parent or teacher with a student or by
someone improving his or her own reading skills, I use he, she, you, child,
learner, parent, and instructor to cover all the possibilities. The chapters con-
tain a mix of all these terms, wherever and whenever each noun or pronoun
fits. I also arrange a dedicated space for exercises to reinforce the lessons.
What You’re Not to Read
If you’re short on time and just want to get down to the nitty-gritty of phon-
ics, you can skip the stuff in the gray boxes, also known as sidebars. I include
this sidebar information for those of you who want to know the whys of
everything or who just want to dig deeper into the details of phonics.

Introduction

Foolish Assumptions
While organizing this book I made some assumptions about you:
 You’re interested in teaching someone to read.
 You have a curiosity about phonics and want a self-help book.
 You know that look/say reading doesn’t work for everyone.
 You need help in choosing phonics-associated reading materials.
 You want a ready reference book on phonics.
If you identify with my foolish assumptions, you’re ready to go! Take a little
more time to read the following sections to get a real feel for how this book
works.
How This Book Is Organized
Even though each lesson builds one on the other, you can still pick and
choose the chapters that you want to examine. The following is a rundown of
each part in Phonics For Dummies.
Part I: Getting Ready 
to Read with Phonics
I start with practical advice about teaching your child to read. You go over
the first steps of learning and find out how easy and inexpensive it really is to
teach someone. I show you instructional theory that’s straightforward and
understandable. In this Part, I explain phonics in general, the method I follow
in this book, and simple formulas for success. This part offers information
and quick tips that are kid and parent friendly.
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals 
of Phonics
In this Part, you learn to read, spell, and write quite well. Before embarking
on two-syllable words, you jump headfirst into blending consonants and
4
Phonics For Dummies 

vowels. You become familiar with the many faces of vowels; students of
phonics may refer to this part often, because it wraps up the 16 basic vowel
sounds.
Part III: Moving Beyond 
the Phonics Basics
Why do the British say li’ bree for li’ brer’ ee or gehr’ uj for guh rozh’? Why do
Aussies say, guh dye’ and Americans say good day’? This is the place where
you learn about accents and getting to the root of words. You also explore
unusual spellings and get to meet the softer side of c and g.
Part IV: Tackling the Trickier 
Side of Phonics
Did you know that most dictionaries use eight sounds of a and almost as
many for the other vowels? What about those words like cough, thought, sure,
and chiffon? This is the place where you find the quirks of phonics. The clas-
sification of these peculiarities is the crème de la crème of this part.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Most people love to hear the top ten songs of the year, the top ten recording
artists, movies, golf pros, and so on. (Did this fixation start with the Ten
Commandments?) This part gives you quick hits of information that enhance
your phonics practice — grouped in tens, of course. It also contains appen-
dixes with useful information, including what’s on the CD.
Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies signature icons are those little round pictures you see in the
margins of the book. I use them to laser your attention to key bits of informa-
tion. Here’s a list of the icons you find in this book and what they mean.

Introduction

I highlight shortcuts and helpful hints for applying guidelines of phonics with
this icon.
Some information bears repeating. I mark points that are worth going over
again and again with this icon.
Certain practices may set your practice back instead of moving it forward. I
use this icon to keep you on sure footing by alerting you to treacherous
ground.
Sometimes, I go into more detail than you need, and I let you know with this
icon that these passages are safe to skip. By all means read these sections if
you’re interested, but know that you can safely pass these paragraphs over
and still become a phonics champ.
You find sample tests, stories, and other activities to assess what you learned
in a chapter at paragraphs marked with this icon.
This icon tells you to listen to the accompanying CD for additional information.
Where to Go from Here
Now it’s time to get your head in the game. Peruse the chapters and look at
the lessons in them. If you want to begin at the beginning, dig right in at
Chapter 1 and move forward in an orderly fashion. But you don’t have to do it
that way. Each chapter is modular, meaning that a particular lesson is self-
contained. Use the Table of Contents to help you find your area of interest.
Need help teaching a child to blend? Jump straight into Chapter 3. If you’ve
already progressed in phonics and want to get to the more difficult levels,
you can start in Part III.

In this part . . .
I
n the chapters in Part I, I tell you what phonics is and
show you how to teach phonics concepts to your child.
You also get the tools you need to help your child use her
knowledge as she learns to read more difficult words and
sentences. I also provide fun ways to reinforce the lessons,
and explain how to tell when your child is ready to move
ahead with her reading skills. By the end of this part, your
child will be able to read her first words!

Chapter 1
Pondering the Power of Phonics
In This Chapter
 Understanding phonics and how phonics is taught
 Preparing your child to learn phonics
 Discovering how phonics concepts build on one another
You’ve already seen your child through walking, talking, eating with uten-
sils, potty training, and countless other processes. Reading is just
another part of growing and discovering. Reading is necessary for success in
life, and phonics can help. Phonics is a method of word recognition. It helps
children understand how to slide letter sounds together to form words. If
you’re curious and have some knowledge of phonics, you need to know from
the get-go that this book presents a specific phonics approach to reading and
spelling. This book, in itself, is very basic because I wrote it for a parent and a
child. But no matter what age you are, this book can help you.
Several years ago I taught phonics to two middle-aged men. Both had suf-
fered from look/say teaching in grade school, and had feeble decoding and
spelling skills. I taught the same lessons that applied to any beginner: the
sequential flashcards and the vowel chart. After they realized that they could
decode unknown words, they were on their way. Because they were both
intelligent and successful people, they applied their knowledge and greatly
improved their skills.
In this chapter, I give you a brief introduction to phonics and the way this
book approaches it to help you and your child master the art of reading. This
chapter also outlines the concepts you see throughout this book and how I
(as an experienced phonics tutor) approach the subject with children. With
equal doses of patience and perseverance, and help from this book, your
phonics routine will run as smoothly as a fine-tuned Cadillac.

Taking the First Steps toward 
Using Phonics
Getting your child reading at the earliest possible age and keeping him happy
at the same time makes the whole process of learning to read easier. Learning
to read isn’t supposed to consume every moment. As your child enters this
stage of discovery, he needs to be busy with other things — like playing 
outside, having a hobby or two, learning board games, experimenting with
art supplies, and so on.
The phonics approach to reading proves itself to be the best. It isn’t reading
in itself; it’s the best method for word recognition, far superior to the look/
say (see the word/say the word) approach. Phonics covers all the bases.
Sliding sounds together to make words gives way to instant recognition of the
words as you progress in your reading. Phonics training also makes for excel-
lent spellers.
Phonics, quite simply, is a method of learning to read in which you connect
sounds with letters or groups of letters. For example, c, k, and ck can all rep-
resent one sound: /k/.
The term phonic shouldn’t be confused with the word phonetic, which simply
describes the sound of human speech. I use phonetic occasionally in this
book when describing sounds of letters or words, but the term doesn’t apply
to the letters or words themselves.
Some words are purely phonetic in that they don’t have any sort of visual 
reference, such as the words and or but. Words that have a visual reference,
such as nouns like cat or rabbit, are often referred to as sight words or look/say
words throughout this book.
Whether you choose home-school or regular school for your child, your goal
is to educate him to his unique capacity. You want to help him develop his
inherent talents and abilities, which will serve him for his entire life. When
you teach him to read, you’re there with him at the beginning of his intellec-
tual achievement.
Phonics For Dummies contains a program that you can use to instruct your
child in how to read. There are many methods for teaching phonics, but the
one used in this book involves teaching a child to read starting with the 
following:
10
Part I: Getting Ready to Read with Phonics 

 The most frequently used words
 The most often used letters that make up the words
 The easiest-to-sound letters that make up a word
This means that you aren’t teaching the alphabet in alphabetical order, which
may be a new concept to you, but it’s a successful and tried-and-true method.
You can use this method to help your child pronounce the consonant and
vowel sounds of the alphabet, decode words, and read. Your child will learn
guidelines for interpreting different letter patterns. Along the way, he’ll dis-
cover how to read in a logical and methodical manner. The phonics program
breaks down learning into succinct, compact units so that your child can
learn one skill at a time without getting frustrated. Phonics becomes fun and
easy for your child.
There is a bit of a controversy regarding how to teach phonics. Educators dis-
agree about how large a role phonics should play in learning to read and how
often teachers should use phonics in teaching reading. But learning to read,
spell, and write is only part of phonics.
The phonics approach I present in this book enables your child to think logi-
cally in terms of reading and spelling words. He’ll develop techniques for pro-
cessing and using the information. You’ll see him progress quickly from
lesson to lesson.
11
Chapter 1: Pondering the Power of Phonics
A remarkable offshoot of phonics
When you take the phonics approach to teach-
ing your child to read, your child learns to use
his language skills in an organized way. The
method starts with the most basic elements of
language and then builds on them a little at a
time. Your child is accumulating layers of skill
and is able to hang on to them. (Saxon math
books take a similar approach to mathematics.)
You’ve probably heard someone say something
like, “My mind is like a sieve! I read or hear
something, and it goes right on through!”
Teaching your child with an organized method
keeps him from ever having to utter these
words. It’s akin to painting a great piece of art
by using the brush as a tool rather than splash-
ing paint and allowing it to stick where it may.
Learning to read with phonics (the brush) pro-
grams the brain to retain information. Children
enjoy unlocking new words, and when the
words are unlocked, the retention is easy. The
end result enables them to quickly grasp
unknown words, learn their definitions, bank the
knowledge, and then move on to the next level.

Getting Your Child (And You) 
into the Swing of Things
Before getting into the nitty-gritty of phonics, you first need to examine and
warm up to the idea of instructing your child. To learn how to read, the stu-
dent depends on an instructor. Who might that be? This book confers the
title upon you! No parent has to be a PhD to teach his or her child to read,
write, and spell. By following the instructions in this book, you can wear the
crown of Master Teacher. You can discover all the techniques you need to
teach your child how to read and spell.
Your self-confidence rubs off on your child. Realizing the importance of a posi-
tive attitude is half the battle. The rest is letting go of your doubts about suc-
cess and trusting the teaching method that I present in this book to do the job.
Atmosphere and timing
Children learn best in a quiet, stress-free atmosphere where they know what
to expect. Before diving into the first phonics lesson, accustom your child to
the idea of “school time” — a part of the day devoted to learning phonics. 
Let him know that this time is special, not a time for play or watching TV.
Eventually, your child will accept the guidelines and even begin to look for-
ward to your time together.
Watch your own stress level as you conduct the lessons. You may grow frus-
trated when your child isn’t grasping a lesson as quickly as you’d like, but
don’t let it show. Call the lesson short if you have to. Or go over a phonics
concept that your child is already familiar with to get back on track.
For most children, keeping a schedule is important. Children learn better if
their lessons come at a specific time each day because they know what to
expect and can mentally prepare themselves for learning.
Applying the skills consistently
When your child is ready for some application, he’ll start to apply his new-
found skills at the local restaurant by grabbing crayons and printing fever-
ishly on the kids’ placemat, quizzing you, following mazes, and asking to play
hangman. If that isn’t enough, he’ll be reading the road signs — or at least
picking out the letters. He’ll sound out words on the cereal box, sing along
12
Part I: Getting Ready to Read with Phonics 

with a phonics song Grandma gave him, or actually pick out words in a Dr.
Seuss book. Even better, he’ll be reading by repetition and phonics in Mac
and Tab. With your help, he can apply the skills he’s learning every day.
Provide age-appropriate material for your child to read. He’ll be reading quite
well by the time he masters the material through the end of Part III, but you
really don’t want him reading a front-page crime report in the local newspa-
per. Even though he’s able to decode multisyllable words, he won’t necessar-
ily comprehend them in an adult context. Early on, the challenge and need is
to provide lots of material that he can easily read so that the previously
acquired skills can be successfully practiced.
Helping you and your child look 
forward to your lessons
Most people remember kindergarten as a wonderful experience. They liked
kindergarten so much because it wasn’t a traditional class, but a class that
involved hands-on learning and experimentation with different kinds of mate-
rials, as well as a class that engaged all the senses — not just the eyes and
ears. The techniques I introduce in this book can help you turn “school time”
into something your child will look forward to and remember fondly, like
kindergarten.
Singing
You absolutely have to start with singing the ABC’s. As kids learn their ABC’s
and the sounds that go with them, their innate creativity and talent comes to
the fore and they groove on the fun of learning. Put anything to song — vowel
guidelines, syllabification guidelines — even if you have to invent a melody.
Children are natural learners when material is presented in song. They’ll
repeat your songs and remember the guidelines they refer to.
Playing games
This book is filled with activities that make learning fun. You don’t necessarily
have to follow the directions to a T. Mix it up a little. For example, instead of
telling your child to point out the short a in one of the reading lessons, give him
an ice cream cone and allow him to take a lick every time he sees a short a.
Glory and praise
Your child will beam with pride when he reads his first word, sentence, and
paragraph. He’ll brag to Grandma, the other kids, and anyone who will listen.
Lay the praise on thick and give him the attention he deserves for a job well
done.
13
Chapter 1: Pondering the Power of Phonics

Livening it up with flashcards 
and other teaching aids
Throughout this book, I give detailed explanations about how to use various
teaching aids. Here’s a short list of the teaching aids that you need in order
for your child to get the most out of his learning time:
 Flashcards and charts: These visual aids can help a great deal in reading
instruction, and they make the learning experience more lively and
cheerful.
 Craft and writing materials: You need paper, pencil, crayons, markers,
and a pair of scissors.
Sight words (those that kids learn to know on sight without decoding by
sound) make great flashcards. When you flash sight words to a bunch of kids,
you find out which ones are visual learners (those whose strength lies in
seeing the word as a whole better than another) and which little angels are
auditory learners, whose listening skills are stronger. Using the phonics
method to teach reading and spelling enhances all the learning processes.
You can write anything you want on a flashcard. It’s a great device for com-
bining work with fun. Your child can work through the flashcards by himself
or ask someone else to go through them with him. While you’re getting your
lesson ready for the day, hand the flashcards to your child and he can quietly
flip them himself until you’re ready. For more info on using flashcards, see
Chapter 2.
Getting an Overview of the 
Phonics Fundamentals
In teaching children to read with the phonics method in this book, each
lesson builds upon the next, and one skill leads to another. This way, as chil-
dren accumulate knowledge about phonics, they learn with confidence. The
following pages explain how different phonics concepts are introduced and
how they build on one another. You get a solid idea of what’s in this book by
reading these pages.
14
Part I: Getting Ready to Read with Phonics 

In every chapter in this book, I present a specific approach to phonics. The
chapter lessons go something like this:
1. Your child warms up by reading flashcards with sounds and words.
This activity engages speech, sound, and sight.
2. Your child listens attentively as you read a story, and then you ask
questions to assess your child’s listening comprehension skills.
3. You and your child read the phonics tables and assimilate the lesson.
You ask the child to spell words from the lesson, and he responds to the
spoken directions by spelling the words orally (thereby engaging yet
another sense).
4. You dictate words and sentences to your child for your child to write.
5. Your child reads aloud for his pleasure (and yours) so that you can
determine how well he’s progressing.
Starting with the basics
Starting in Part II of this book, your child discovers that letters make sounds,
sounds make words, and words make sentences. From there, you teach the
four most commonly used and easily understood letters — m, s, t, and a. By
using these letters, you can spell many words and even write simple sen-
tences. Spend as much time as you need on these letters. You want your 
child to feel confident using them before he gets into blending letters to 
make sounds. You also teach the child two sight words, a and the. As your
child progresses, you add more sight words to the list of words he should
memorize.
Be sure to distinguish between small words that can be sounded and true
sight words. For example, do and of and done are true sight words. However,
cat and dog and three aren’t sight words because they can be sounded.
In Chapter 3, I ask you to introduce the letters m, s, t, and a in your very first
phonics lesson. These letters are easy to print. When you introduce these let-
ters and sounds to your child, he sees, says, sounds, and blends them. In this
first lesson, he reads several words formed by combining those letters. You
also teach him the sight words and, the, and a. With these look/say words —
or sight words — your child can read short sentences from the first lesson.
He may also be able to print them as you dictate the sounds to him.
15
Chapter 1: Pondering the Power of Phonics

Blending basics
After your child knows the sounds of letters, you work on blending them
together to make words, as shown in Chapter 3. Blending may be the biggest
hurdle your child faces. Don’t lose patience. Some children pick up blending
right away; others need time and practice. Most children can fly through
their phonics lessons after they understand blending.
Vowel sounds and digraphs
Your child explores more consonants, and then he discovers the rest of the
vowels and their short sounds. About this time, your child will be able to
read simple sentences. Chapters 4 and 5 prepare your child for bigger words
and words that are harder to spell. He’s introduced to digraphs (two conso-
nant letters blended together to make a completely new sound, like ch) and
plural words.
Vowels and diphthongs
In Part II of this book, your child passes from the beginning to the intermedi-
ate stage as he learns how to read and decode words with various kinds of
long vowels. I also introduce the elusive y and w, the two consonants that can
also serve as vowels, and diphthongs (two letters joined to create a com-
pletely new sound).
Plunging into advanced phonics
Part III of this book deals with words with two or more syllables, their struc-
ture, and their pronunciation. By now, your child has a large vocabulary and
is reading smoothly. I explain what diacritical marks are (they’re the marks
and symbols that appear in dictionaries to tell you how to pronounce and
accent words), and I tell you how to read these marks to find out how to pro-
nounce words, as well as how to find out where to put the accent in a word.
Word endings and tenses
Next, your child moves ahead to the ed, ing, and er suffixes. Your child’s read-
ing level expands at this point, as he discovers the difference between the
16
Part I: Getting Ready to Read with Phonics 

present and past tense. He also learns to double the consonant and drop the
e when spelling words with the ed, ing, or er ending.
Some new sounds and unusual spellings
Your child explores the soft sounds of c and g, and although I introduce a few
guidelines to make it easier to handle these sounds, your child has to memo-
rize most of the c and g words for spelling purposes. Your child has now
reached the point where memorizing becomes more necessary, and he’s
introduced to words that need memorizing, such as eight, though, and cough.
Prefixes and suffixes
Your child will have reached the advanced phonics level by now. He tackles
suffixes and prefixes, explores roots, and begins to understand how prefixes
and suffixes can change the meaning of a root.
The minor players
Part IV of this book looks into exceptions to the guidelines of phonics. It
looks at the odds and ends of phonics, including these items:
 The schwa: The schwa sound takes the place of most vowels, and exists
as a concession to pronunciation. It makes the quick uh sound.
 New digraphs and sounds: In this new digraph, one of the letters makes
its normal sound, and the other is silent (as in knife and write). You also
look at words borrowed from foreign languages that don’t conform to
English guidelines.
 Vowel criminals: Some vowels follow absolutely no pattern (as in the
words carry and mirror). Your child looks at these vowels, as well as
some long vowels (as in old and find) and the letter pairs gh and ou.
 The letter x and the zh sound: The letter x makes three sounds — you
explore all three and look into the zh sound, which is in more words
than you probably realize.
At this point, your child is officially an expert. Compliment him, brag to 
your relatives, and show some pride. Your child has earned it. But most of all,
rest easy knowing that his academic career will be much easier because of
this phonics training. And give yourself a pat on the back for being a great
teacher.

Chapter 1: Pondering the Power of Phonics

Ramping Up to Exciting 
Books and Readers
After your child is reading, you can cultivate a love for reading! When you
and your child are well into Part II of Phonics For Dummies, you’ve passed the
point of no return. Sounds ominous, but I want to assure you that your child
is well on his way to being a fluent reader. After he knows how to blend sounds
to make words, there’s no end in sight to what he can read. You get to decide
what kind of books to choose. If you want to supplement his reading, this sec-
tion prepares you for making great choices in reading material. What your
child likes to read really matters!
Phonics storybooks
A typical phonics storybook is one that emphasizes word families; that is, the
book contains very few sight words in the stories but places heavy emphasis
on phonetic words. However, providing your child with the right books can
be a challenge. You can recognize appropriate books by their use of a lot of
repetitious and phonetic words. Most school libraries contain some, but
many local libraries don’t. Your best bet is to try the bookstore. If you’re will-
ing to pay a few bucks, you can find Bob books and maybe some Mac and Tab
books. Ask the salesperson to do a search for you; she may come up with
some goodies. Another possibility is a school supply store. Your last option is
surfing the Internet for used books.
Including look/say readers
A typical look/say reader not only uses sight words but also makes use of
repetition. Look/say readers are a lot easier to find than phonics readers.
Almost every old reader book dating back to the 1930s is a look/say book. If
you can find them, using them as supplements is fine as long as your main
method of teaching is phonics. I use the word supplement in a serious way.
Don’t let your child guess at a word. Telling him is better than letting him
guess. After all, he’s supposed to be reading for fun.
Because the sight words are so repetitious, your child is practically memoriz-
ing the stories. You can often find old look/say readers at book sales. You
may also find them in school libraries.
18
Part I: Getting Ready to Read with Phonics 

Keep in mind that most children’s books that you find in the library or book-
stores are look/say or whole language books. Whole language and look/say
books are similar because neither emphasizes phonics.
Fun with Dick and Jane
Kids often fly through the classic, adorable Dick and Jane Readers that you
can still purchase at your local retail outlets and toy stores. When your child
reads a book that has a lot of repetition (like the Dick and Jane books do), the
cadence may fool you into thinking that his reading skills are superb. But
keep in mind that he may not yet be a phonetic reader. These books are okay
to use, because they exercise the visual aspect of reading and are great prac-
tice for fluency and expression. Another fact is that many of the words are
phonetic, and through repetition, your child learns. Kids start to see entire
sentences instead of reading just one word at a time.
At the risk of sounding inconsistent, I want to tell you why I like Dick and
Jane for reading for pleasure:
 They use pictures that are heartwarming and inspire children to put
themselves into the story.
 They activate the Dolch list (see Chapter 2), which is 85 percent pho-
netic, and use the words in repetition.
 They enhance fluency, expression, and comprehension.
I hope I don’t offend my phonetics only buddies, but I believe these books can
have a limited role in teaching. I don’t advise using the teacher’s manuals, but
let the kids enjoy the stories.
Boosting Skills with Fun Activities
If kids are good at just one thing, it’s having fun. And the more fun they have
learning, the more fun you’ll have teaching them. Keep your teaching on the
lighter side and your reading sessions will never become a chore. Instead of
having your child hunker down with gobs of worksheets, give him a variety 
of activities that lighten the load of homework. Give him a small number of
activities and make each one count. Ask for only ten minutes of work five
times per week. These activities make good practice, and practice, you know,
makes perfect.
19
Chapter 1: Pondering the Power of Phonics

In this book you encounter a variety of activities. They’re designed for your
child to print either directly in the book or on a separate piece of paper. All
the activities that you find in the chapters are streamlined for the lesson at
hand. In fact, the activities in this book can be used as models to enable you
to create your own activities. Look for the Activity icon throughout this book
as a guide to fun activities for you and your child. Chapter 18 also includes a
list of activities to enjoy.
I advise you to make copies of the exercises, which allows you to preserve
your book if you so desire.

he saying “practice makes perfect” makes perfect sense. That is, if all that
practice is helping you get better! The hard, cold fact about practice is
that you have to do it, no matter what skill you’re seeking to gain or enhance.
Natural born talent is only the beginning. The rest is practicing with an eye
on improving. The same is true with phonics.
Athletes have drills that help them improve their skills, and so does phonics.
But phonics drills (or activities) can be lots of fun — almost like hosting your
own little game show. With a little creativity and some cutting and printing,
you’re on your way to phonics success!
In this chapter, I show you great teaching aids, techniques, tools, activities,
and more; all are aimed at helping your child get phonics in a flash. And
that’s aid number one!
Getting Phonics in a Flash 
with Flashcards
Because kids hunger for attention and activity, flashcards are a great way to
liven up lessons. Using flashcards is more than just showing the card quickly
and giving the answer. It’s also a way for you and your child to have fun
together. Most parents enjoy seeing their children light up with excitement
and animation during a flashcard exercise.

Okay, flashing a card isn’t the be-all and end-all of education. But if you play
your cards right by using flashcards and organizing them well, you have a
first-rate technique.
In the days of the bare-bones classroom, the teacher and student were often
at the chalkboard. Columns of phonetic and sight words were written,
pointed out, and drilled. Teachers sent flashcards home for math practice.
Perhaps for thrifty purposes, reading cards didn’t come home. Teachers did
allow the students to bring home their Dick and Jane readers to practice with
Mom and Dad. To this day, teachers send math flashcards home because it’s
an old custom that’s tried-and-true. I say that what’s good for the goose is
good for the gander, or in this case, what works for math works for phonics.
Gather your supplies and get ready to roll!
Starting off with the Dolch list
This book provides tons of words throughout the chapters in Parts II, III, and
IV, but a good starting point for picking words for your flashcards is the
Dolch word list. In the 1940s, Edward W. Dolch, PhD, surveyed many chil-
dren’s books. From this survey, he came up with a hand-tallied list of words,
including pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, verbs,
and nouns repeatedly found in children’s books of that time. In 1948, he for-
mulated these words as the most frequently encountered in reading. The
Dolch word list, which is still in use today, is made up of 315 words. Dolch
didn’t list his words by word difficulty, but rather by the frequency with
which these words appear in print.
Following are the first 100 words of the Dolch word list, which include about
half of all words in material written in the English language. Children who are
learning to read typically use these words in their speaking and listening
vocabularies:

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Teaching Aids and Techniques
Educators refer to Dolch words as sight words because these words need to
be recognized on sight. Even though the words on the Dolch list are consid-
ered sight words, the list breaks apart and overlaps with phonic words.
Making your own flashcards
Before you go out and spend money on materials for flashcard construction
(or premade flashcards), see whether you can find the basic items you need
at home. Despite best efforts, nearly every home has a junk drawer. And take a
look at the samples in Appendix C. Here are some tips for creating flashcards:
 Using the best markers: Sharpie markers don’t bleed through the paper
as easily as other markers. I like the chisel-tip Sharpies for clearly print-
ing the letters. No bleed-through means you can use both sides. Use blue
or black markers for visual ease.

 Selecting suitable paper: Make your own flashcards with 3-x-5-inch
index cards or oaktag (a thin but stiff card or cardboard that’s used to
make typical Manila folders). If you can’t find oaktag, you can cut Manila
folders into 2-x-3-inch cards (minimum size). Oaktag is the best, because
it holds up and works well with Sharpies.
 Finding the right cutting tools: A paper cutter comes in handy, but you
can use a ruler and scissors.
 Printing correctly and legibly: Always make sure that you print the 
letters correctly when making the flashcards. Copy the alphabet from
Figure 2-1. You can go to a school store and buy a printing tablet, which
shows you how to print the letters.
 Considering the computer: You can have a grand old time making flash-
cards on the computer. I recommend comic sans font for the exactness
of the printing letters.
 Creating multiple sets: You can make more than one set of flashcards.
For example, post one set of cards on the wall so that your child can
look at the cards daily. Another set may be personalized 2-x-3-inch cards
that your child can transport in her pocket or your purse.
Now you decide what to put on the flashcards. Your cards can be set up like
any of the following:
 Individual sound cards that have the individual letters on the front of
the card. Include uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, M m.
 Picture keywords that have the picture, the keyword, and the sound on
the front of the card.

24
Part I: Getting Ready to Read with Phonics 

 Phonics flashcards that have the beginning of a word on the front of the
card and the complete word on the back of the card. For example, you
can have ma on the front of the card and mat on the back.
 Sight word cards that have a word from the Dolch list, like the, on the
front of the card and nothing on the back of the card. (Check out the 
earlier pages of this chapter for more info on the Dolch list.)
 Segments of words for decoding on the front of the card and the whole
words on the back of the card. For example, sh© p, thr\ sh, and b±t ter are
on the front of the card, and shop, thrash, and butter are on the back.
 Vowel guidelines on the front of the card and the pattern on the back of
the card. For example:
• Front: When a word or syllable has only vowel and it comes
between two consonants, the vowel is usually short.
• Back: Cvc (consonant-vowel-consonant)
 Symbols (diacritical marks) on the front of the card and the definitions
on the back of the card. For example:
• Front: -‡
• Back: Quick uh sound, called a schwa
 Vocabulary words on the front of the card and the definitions on the
back of the card.
Keep your card materials and ideas handy throughout your phonics lessons.
As you progress through your lessons with your child, you can keep adding
more cards while discarding the ones your child already knows well.
Putting your flashcards to use
Start flipping the flashcards fairly slowly and then go faster and faster as the
exercise goes on (or as your child gets the hang of it). Flop the cards down
on the table with great drama, putting them in one stack for right and another
stack for wrong. Get buttons or pennies and plop them down on the winning
cards.
Your child may be flustered and lively at the same time. She may beg you to go
slower, but she’ll get in the game and join in the fun. (Back off just a little if she
gets too stressed.) Make her challenge herself to do better and go faster. As
you speed up, your voices get louder. You can make a progress chart, have
prizes each time you go through the flashcards, or give privileges as a reward.
Sit down to work on flashcards for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time, and you
and your child will be thrilled with the results.
25
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Teaching Aids and Techniques

Most of the Dolch words can indeed be sounded because they’re phonetically
regular words. Thus, when a child makes an error or can’t recall a word
quickly, she should be encouraged to sound out the word.
The biggest mistake you can make is to tackle too many cards at one sitting.
Try not to bite off more than you can chew. Knowing 5 words well is better
than trying to learn 20 words and forgetting most of them by tomorrow. If you
work with too many words, your child will forget them. Spread your flash-
cards sessions out over two to three days, and repeat them often. Some kids
are speed demons who pick up on words quickly, and others take longer.
If you play your cards right, you’ll make quizzing easy. In addition, your child
will receive, understand, and retain the information because of the following
reasons:
 You compacted the information.
 Looking at the card ensures that your child is seeing what she has
learned.
 Distributing the sessions over a few very brief intervals during the day
imbeds the information through repetition.
Carry the flashcards with you so that your child can look at them in the car,
in the doctor’s office, and so on. I’m not trying to make you obsessive, but I
am suggesting that you make the most of very small windows of time when
you can fit in two to three minutes of card flashing.
Posting the cards on the wall is another good way to use them. You can use a
yardstick or laser to point to the word as your child reads it.
26
Part I: Getting Ready to Read with Phonics 
The Leitner system
In the 1970s, German science popularizer
Sebastian Leitner proposed using flashcards 
to support memorization by way of spaced 
repetition. His method, known as the Leitner
system, sorts flashcards into groups according
to how well you know each card. To use this
method, you try to recall the solution written on
a flashcard. If you succeed, you send the card
to the next group. But if you fail, you send it back
to the first group. An obvious advantage of the
Leitner method is that you can focus on the
most difficult flashcards, because they remain
in the first group. The result is, ideally, a reduc-
tion in the amount of study time you need.

Managing your flashcards
Whether you’re a messy Bessie or a neat freak, keeping your cards straight is
a good idea. It helps keep your kid’s brain tidy and saves you time — if the
cards are in order, you don’t have to go through the old stuff she already
knows. In the first few weeks, you’re dealing with a small stack that you can
keep in a plastic, zippered sandwich bag. You can even spring for three sand-
wich bags: one for the cards your child already knows, one for the work-in-
progress cards, and one for the cards that are waiting to explode upon the
scene. While these bags are keeping your flashcards in order, you may
develop organizing solutions tailored to you and your child’s lifestyle. If
you’re not finding the time or desire to do this, check with the organization
geeks and explore some of their modes. This list gets you started:
 Use a small box and make four dividers for it — one for cards you review
every day, one for cards you bring out every three days, one for the
once-a-week cards, and one for the cards you break out only once a
month. New cards go in the front compartment because you want to
review them every day. When your child knows a card, you move it 
back gradually. If she gets one wrong, that card goes back to the first
compartment.
 If you’re really industrious, you may purchase a pocket chart to hold
your flashcards. The chart and its contents (flashcards) are for you and
your child to see at all times.
 Go to a box store and look for little boxes that fit the size of your 
flashcards.
Charting for Phonics Success
Charts allow you easy access to volumes of information. Your child gets an
overview of learning to read in mere seconds of viewing. All you have to do is
point and explain the material, or point and ask her to read it to you. Charts
are portable and time saving.
Teachers love charts. Nothing gives character to a schoolroom like colored
charts. When you walk into a first-grade room, the boards and walls are lined
with charts indicating the days of the week, the months of the year, sight
words, phonics charts, and so on. The colorful décor almost blinds your
senses.
27
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Teaching Aids and Techniques

The teacher who decorated that room has a purpose for every item there.
That doesn’t mean you should use charts like wallpaper for your kitchen or
family room. No one wants his house to look like the classroom in a public
school. Unless you have a special space for your child’s whatchamacallits,
the refrigerator is probably the limit. Finding a place for charts can be as
simple as putting them between the pages of this book.
Making charts
Every once in a while, you may feel emboldened to make charts to help you
with your instruction. After all, a parent teaching a child is all about personal-
ization, and charts tend to be very personalized.
You decide how to craft your charts, but your information must be golden.
Because you’re teaching one-on-one, you can:
 Copy your charts to whatever paper size is best for you and your
child. If you’re making a wall chart, for example, it should be fairly large
(poster size). Young children require large lettering, so make the chart’s
contents big enough to read.
 Determine the size of smaller charts by the print in children’s books.
Slip these charts between the pages of this book, stack them on the
kitchen counter, or lay them on the table.
 Place the vowel chart on a wall or fridge if you have space. You can
make a copy of the vowel chart in Figure 2-2. The vowel chart is the core
of the vowel system, so you want your child to know it well. If you have
any wall or fridge space, put the vowel chart there for the next few
months.
 Make copies of your charts, and give your child her own copy.
Lamination is a great way to keep your charts neat and readable — 
even if you end up spilling coffee on them.
 Move the charts close enough to the child so that she can read them. If
you need to, you can enlarge the charts with a copier.
Because you’re teaching a child, your charts should be plain and understand-
able. Lucky you — I bequeath to you my best charts. The work is done. The
pedagogy (instructional theory) is terrific. All you have to do is use them.
The charts in this chapter specifically target the information that your child
should know. The most generally accepted reasons for using charts are that
they:
 Summarize information
 Make great visual aids
28
Part I: Getting Ready to Read with Phonics 

 Make large chunks of information easier to understand
 Ease reviewing
 Make great reference sheets
Using charts
Your child comes out way ahead by using my charts. I designed them specifi-
cally to give the most information possible to beginning readers. You can add
to the charts as you go along. Try to keep the information as organized as
you can so that the child doesn’t feel chaotic as she absorbs the information.
Charts are meaningless unless you put them into operation. Here are some
tips on how to use them:
 Start the session with an overview of material on the chart.
 Explain the information by pointing to the chart.
 Point to the material on the chart and drill with your child.
 Refer often to the chart.

Beginning with the Roman alphabet
What better place to begin than to do as the Romans do? Make cards for
each letter of the alphabet, and include upper and lower cases of the 
alphabet.
After you and your child look at the alphabet, see whether she enjoys this
little ditty. See whether she can pick out the a’s and b’s, or give her a lesson
on the uppercase and lowercase a.

Keywords: Matching pictures and sounds
Keywords are tools to unlock the sounds. The word lists and tables in
Chapters 3 through 9 contain keywords. You can make copies of them 
or use them when you come to the lesson. This section presents the key-
words in their entirety. When you teach this with this tool, look at the 
keyword card, see the picture, say the name of the picture, and say the
sound. Memorize them well. Then think about the keyword and start the
sound, as shown in Figure 2-3. See Appendix C for keyword card examples
you can use.
Vowel chart
Figure 2-2, earlier in the chapter, shows the basic vowel sounds that come
from the five vowels, a, e, i, o and u (y is a special case and is treated mostly
as a consonant in this book). Reviewing this chart on a daily basis while
learning phonics is a good idea because, later on, when your child knows the
vowel chart well, she’ll be comfortable with using all the vowel sounds in her
phonics lessons. This chart can also become part of the progress log (see the
later section “Keeping a progress log” for more info).

Picking Up Phonics with Word Strips
You can turn word families into an awesome method for spelling and reading
by using word strips. Cutting oaktag paper into narrow strips that look like
bookmarks and printing rhyming word families on them is a dynamic phonics
tool. Word families are groups of words that have a common pattern. For
example, a cvc (consonant-vowel-consonant) pattern contains words like tan,
ran, pan, man, can, ban, fan, and so on.
Most people don’t know that average first graders are capable of spelling at
least 1,200 words by learning word families. You make that happen by using
the word strips in Chapters 3 through 9. Print them on paper and work the
strips with your child. Word strip practice enables her to spell and read
oodles of words in just a few short months.

Forget all the gizmos and fancy features of the school stores and catalogs. To
make word strips, you need only oaktag paper, scissors or a paper cutter, and
a marker.
In the beginning lessons, your bookmarker (also known as a word strip) 
doesn’t need to be more than 3 inches wide and 6 inches in length. At this
point, you don’t have very many rhyming words to print. Picking out words 
is a snap — you can grab them right from the word lists in Parts II and III. If
you happen to have a really great run like the -ay word family, you may want
to cut your strip a little longer. If it’s too long and hangs out of the bottom of
the book, it’s no big deal. 
Here’s an example of a typical word strip. Your child will read about 15 words
from this one alone: bay, say, cay, day, Fay, gay, hay, jay, lay, may, nay, pay,
way, and Ray. If she’s into the harder stuff, you can add stay, bray, flay, fray,
de-lay, cray-on, slay, gray, pray, stray, and so on. This family adds up to some
great learning!
Activity: Using Word Strips
Preparation: You need paper and a fine-tip marker. You can prepare the word
strips on the job. It takes only a minute or two if you follow the instructions
in the preceding section.
To play:
1. Hand the child a word strip, and ask her to place it on the table.
2. Place her finger under each word and ask her to read that word.
3. Articulating the words, she reads the list twice, hearing the rhymes.
4. Ask your child to spell each word on the strip out loud.
5. Ask your child to write each word on the strip.
After using any or all of these steps, you and your child can decorate the
strip on the flip side with dates and stars for work well done.
Engaging the Senses with Phonics
In this section, I provide techniques for learning to read. Novelties in teaching
methods are ongoing, but educators generally go back to the methods that
have been used for centuries — namely dictation, drill, and memorization.
When you put in a little time learning the methods and applying them, your
child’s skills may grow beyond your expectations. Any way you want to per-
sonalize your methods is great. Need some ideas? Read on.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Teaching Aids and Techniques

Spelling out loud
A spelling bee is a great exercise; the learner first hears the spelling word
from the instructor. The child then speaks the answer by saying the word and
spelling it out loud. Hear the word. Say the word. As she does this, she needs
to picture the spelling of the word in her brain. As you progress, you no
longer need to make pictures as often, because spelling becomes involuntary.
If you drive down the road often enough, you get to know the way like the
back of your hand.
You may want to introduce the finger spelling technique here. To do so, your
child says the word out loud and says each sound in the word, as she holds
up a finger for each sound. Then she says the letter(s) for each of the sounds.
Writing from listening
To discover whether your child understands a phonics lesson, from time to time
dictate one syllable (mat), short vowel words (back), and simple sentences
to her. In a typical lesson, she’s at a table with a pencil and a printing tablet.
At first, the words you dictate should be those that follow a regular phonetic
pattern — examples include dog, had, and sit, as opposed to do, was, and
one. And so begins her first writing lesson. Kids’ fine motor skills develop
at different rates, so be prepared for some primitive printing. Along with
learning how to print, your child learns about punctuation, capitals, and
so on.
My printing expert taught me a cardinal rule about printing: Start at the top
of the head and move down to the tummy. Here are some additional tips for
proper printing (see Figure 2-4):
 Always print from the top of the letter downward.
 Don’t stroke upwards.
 In general, work from left to right.
For children who need extra help making pathways to the brain, a tactile sur-
face may aid their printing. A rough surface like sandpaper creates more
stimulation for remembering the letters. I often use a rough surface in my
teaching, and I ask the learner to use her index finger to write. She can write
on a variety of surfaces that offer tactile stimulation, including air, a table, a
wall, a sofa, cement, a car seat, sand on a beach, a breadboard, or someone’s
back. As she writes, have fun guessing what she’s writing. All kids can profit
from this exercise.

Part I: Getting Ready to Read with Phonics 

Memorizing with mnemonics
“A rat in Tom’s house might eat Tom’s ice cream.” What in the world does
that have to do with phonics? It’s a mnemonic phrase that can help you
remember how to spell a-r-i-t-h-m-e-t-i-c! Get it? The first letter of each word 
in the sentence makes up the word arithmetic. It’s just like a secret code!
Most people learn by using mnemonics without ever hearing the word.
Mnemonics refers to a memory device. The device can be verbal, such as a
poem or a special word that jogs the memory, or it can be a word that you
write down to jog your memory. People often use mnemonics for making
lists. This remembering tool bases itself on the fact that your mind can
remember things better if you attach a mnemonic to information you think
you’ll forget.
For example, say you need to remember a license plate number: CNN10XP. You
can remember it mnemonically by assigning the following information to it:
 CNN is a cable news station.
 Ten is the age of a neighbor’s son.
 XP is the operating system of your computer.
Using mnemonics, you can come up with some pretty nutty stuff, but it works!
Managing Phonics Progress
Keeping a record of your child’s progress is very important — you want to
make sure you’re covering all the bases. Keeping a log helps you remember
where you’ve been and see where you’re headed. And you end up creating a
tangible piece of memory. You don’t need anything complicated. The upcom-
ing sections show you that simple is better.

Keeping a progress log
A progress log gives you and your child the tools you need to keep track of
her development. Think of this log as a report card that you and your child
view with great interest. This log contains reading, phonics, spelling, and
much more. Get started right away so that she can chart her course. 
Table 2-1 shows you a sample progress log.

Predicting outcomes
Is the child getting it?
How do you know whether your kids are getting it? First of all, most children
can learn to read, write, and spell. Every classroom in America has the chal-
lenged and the Einstein of the class. Some children learn faster than others,
but that isn’t the whole picture. Some of the brightest children can have
weaknesses in the language arts.
Have confidence that your child learns well. She may fly through the phonics
lessons, or she may plod through them at a slower pace. It doesn’t matter as
long as she moves forward.
She’s getting it if:
 She responds to the flashcards with relative ease.
 She reads the tables with relative ease.
 She spells one-syllable words by ear and on paper.
 She responds to comprehension questions.
 She understands the worksheets when you explain them.
Smoothing disruptions to the routine
From time to time, parents are unable to continue the daily routine. Sooner or
later, circumstances get in the way — it happens to everyone. So how do you
keep the ball rolling and maintain effectiveness? Here are tips for keeping
phonics skills sharp when the daily routine wanes:
 Do word strips in small increments when you can.
 While you’re planting your flower garden, doing routine work on the
computer, lying on the couch with a headache, and so on, ask your child
to sit near you and read from a very easy reader or a table from one of
the chapters.
37
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Teaching Aids and Techniques

 Keep the flashcards handy and whip out a few and flash for five minutes.
 If you and your child are in the car, think of some simple one-syllable
words and ask her to spell them.
 Hand her a very simple worksheet and a pencil and tell her to work the
exercise while you’re under the hairdryer at the salon.
 Go to Chapter 18, find some activities for independent work, and 
prepare ahead for those long trips in the car.
 Go to Chapter 19 and discover more awesome phonics resources for kids.
Rewarding successful learning
One sure way to unlock your child’s brilliance is through positive reinforce-
ment. All you have to do is say the word treat and your child’s face probably
creases into a wide smile. Treats vary from a small piece of candy to a Disney
World Cruise. I’m sure you can come up with something in between or what-
ever is most appropriate for your child. I want you to realize the value of
rewarding your child. Rewards are intrinsic to human nature; all people love
treats and look forward to them. Children are no exception. Your child works
harder if she can look forward to a treat. So put your thinking cap on and
come up with your own personalized choice of delights.

Part II
Exploring the
Fundamentals 
of Phonics

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you and your child move into the founda-
tions of phonics — those basics you must know to
begin reading. You start with consonants and explore
blending sounds. Then you move on to short-vowel
sounds and begin reading very short stories. You and
your child also discover things like the diphthong, where
you make new sounds out of old vowels, and contractions.
As the chapters move along, I pick up the learning pace,
and you and your child begin to enjoy reading even more!

Chapter 3
Starting with Simple Consonants
and a Vowel
In This Chapter
 Getting into blending
 Using scripts and other techniques
 Looking at consonants and keywords
 Examining the letter a
B
ecause m, s, t, and a are frequently used letters, they form a logical
starting place for phonics. This chapter explores these consonants first,
because they have only one sound each. Then I show you the short vowel a.
After discovering step-by-step techniques for blending and more, you meet
and blend the letters and the short sounds of all the consonants. It’s time to
dig in!
Knowing how to dig in makes less work for you and your child. If someone
asks you which letters in the English language are used the most, you may
say, “Definitely not the x or z.” A safe answer!
As I also mention in Chapter 1, a safe — and logical — answer to teaching a
child to read is to start with the following:
 The most frequently used words
 The most often used letters that make up the words
 The easiest-to-sound letters that make up a word
The method in Phonics For Dummies follows this directive. Remember that
you aren’t teaching the alphabet in alphabetical order. This chapter gives you
the simplified instructions that you need to apply in the rest of this book’s
chapters. If you can plow carefully through to the end of this chapter, the rest
of the journey presented in this book will be smooth sailing.

For the sake of unity, all the consonant keywords (such as mop, tent, apple,
and sun) are included in this chapter, although not all are basic consonant
sounds.
Digging Into Blending
This book uses blending tables (see Table 3-1) to present a template of tech-
niques for teaching blending. Keep in mind that the study of blending sounds
together to make words can be called decoding, word study, word analysis, or
word attack. Many experts use this lingo. These techniques include
 Scripts
 Blending tables
 Vowel sounding
The section wraps up with flashcard activities to perfect blending skills and
some fun games to boost blending skills. You’ll apply all the techniques and
tips in this section as you dig in further with consonants (see the later sec-
tion, “Going Deeper With Consonants and Keywords,” in this chapter).
Now is a good time to make flashcards of a, and, and the.
Using scripts
Going step by step calmly moves you and your child forward, which is why
some instructors write their lessons into scripts. Scripts are just like the
scripts you imagine for plays or movies, and they can be tough at first. They
help your child move from a single unit of thought to the broader picture. In
following the steps of a script, everything lines up neatly. If you end up
having to practice it a couple of times, that’s okay.
Here’s an example of how to set up a script: The instructor (that’s probably
you) prints the following sentence on a piece of paper or white board: Sam
went to sleep. Follow the script to introduce a sentence, which is a related
group of words that has a subject and a predicate, and expresses a complete
thought. In this exercise, you’re going from the sentence (the whole) to a
single word, and then to the sounds that make up the word. Follow scripts to
introduce the sentence and get your child started spelling and reading:
42
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

Instructor: “Today you’re going to start to read by learning all about the
letter m.”
Point to the letter m in the alphabet and then show the learner a flash-
card with a small m printed on it.
Instructor: “The name of this letter is ‘em’; the sound of this letter is 
m-m-m. What is its name? What is its sound?”
The learner answers these questions. Don’t stress the name of the letter.
Learning word recognition requires you to emphasize the sound. Point to
the picture of the mop, and say mop, slowly exaggerating the m sound.
Instructor: “This keyword helps you to remember the letter m. Every
time you see this letter, I want you to see the picture of a mop in your
mind, and I want you to hear the sound of the first letter. This picture will
unlock the sound of this letter just as a key unlocks the door.”
Let your child or learner draw a mop, use a mop, or pantomime the word.
Do anything you can to teach the keyword so dramatically that he can’t
forget it.
Your child now prints m in the air, on the white board, or on lined paper,
which already has an m on it to copy. While lettering, he needs to train
himself to sound the sound quietly each time he prints it.
Instructor: “Say its sound, not its name.”
Pass out a skill booster to reinforce the letters. He again quietly sounds
out the letters.
Continue the script method with s and with t. Soften the ending on t so that it
doesn’t sound like tuh (t with a short sound of u). The last t in tent gives you
an excellent sound.
If you’re unfamiliar with any sounds in this book, be sure to listen to the
appropriate tracks on the CD.
You can also condense the script down into a miniscript, if you like, similar to
the following:
Instructor (pointing to the sentence): “This is a sentence.”
Give the child a moment to look at the sentence.
Instructor: “What is it?”
Learner: “It is a sentence.”
43
Chapter 3: Starting with Simple Consonants and a Vowel

Instructor: “Fine, now this sentence has four words. (Point to them.) I will
erase three of these words. (Erase everything but Sam.) The word Sam
is left. The letters of the alphabet make up the word Sam. Here’s an 
S (pointing to it). Here’s an a, and here’s an m.”(Again pointing.)
The learner then sees how letters make up words.
Using blending tables
Climb into the driver’s seat — you’re ready to rev up for the first of many
blending tables. Blending is merely sliding sounds together to make words.
Knowing how to blend sounds to make words is a vital key to reading 
success.
You may be tempted to add uh to the beginning consonant sound, muh-ah-t.
No, no, no! Don’t do it! Listening to the tracks on the CD that accompanies
this book will clear that problem fast.
Table 3-1 shows you how to blend four of the most often used letters: m, s, t,
and a. To walk your child through a blending table, start at the top of the first
column and read down the column, blending the sounds of the letters. Do
this with each of the top set of columns in order. Then move to the bottom
set of columns and do the same thing.
After taking your child through both sets of columns, read the sentences and
do the keywords.

Have your child read the following short, simple sentences for practice. The
goal is for him to be able to read as he speaks, so you want him to read each
sentence to himself and then say the sentence out loud with expression, 
naturally speaking the words in the sentence.
44
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

Matt sat.
Sam sat.
Sam sat at a mat.
You can adapt keywords for your child’s flashcard collection. As your child
gets used to the cards and you’re flashing them, prompt him by asking
“Letter, sound, keyword?” You can mix up those directives, or just say
“Sound?”
Suggested keyword cards include the following:
Mm: mop
Ss: sun
Tt: tent
Aa: apple
For the corresponding sounds on the CD, please listen to Track 1 for m,
Track 2 for s, Track 3 for t, and Track 4 for short a.
Sounding all the vowel sounds
Learning the letter a is a harder procedure because the phonics method in
this book covers all three sounds of a in one lesson, instead of starting with
just the short a. Although teaching the three sounds together may seem con-
fusing, the technique works well. You can memorize three sounds almost as
easily as one. The benefit of the overall view proves itself in later lessons.
Take a look at the vowel chart in Chapter 2 for reference.
Here are some tips to help you uncover the three sounds of a:
 When introducing a, use the terminology “first, second, and third
sounds of a.” Later shift to saying “short, long, and third sound of a.”
The first way may be easier in the beginning, or you can use the terms
interchangeably if you want to. The reference words for the sound
become familiar and form a correct foundation for future dictionary
work.
 Even though you use only the short sound of a in Chapters 3 through 6,
knowing the other sounds is a tremendous help in unlocking words in
later chapters.
45
Chapter 3: Starting with Simple Consonants and a Vowel

 If your child encounters a word that has one of the other two sounds of
a in it, such as lake or saw, he can decode it just from using the overall
view presented in the vowel chart.
When you know all three sounds, you’re also able to experiment. Any a that
you meet in a word makes either the first, the second, or the third sound. Try
all three — in that order — and get the right word by using the context. It’s
tied up neatly in one package for you.
Phonics For Dummies is written so that you can teach either the short sound
alone or all three sounds of a. However, if you do the latter, refer to the vowel
chart in Chapter 2 for the keywords for these three sounds. Then try the 
following script:
Instructor: “The name of this letter is ‘ay,’ but I have a surprise for you! 
A has three sounds! Say apple after me slowly. (Exaggerate the a and say
the rest at a normal rate.) This is the first sound and the first keyword.
“Now say ate. (Exaggerate the a.) This is the second sound and the
second keyword.
“Now say all. (Exaggerate the a.) This is the third sound and the third
keyword. Always remember the sounds and the keywords in the same
order. At first, we’ll be working only on the first sound (the short one).”
You can easily retain keywords if you use a memory device called an associa-
tive sentence, which is a sentence designed to help you remember specific 
letters or sounds. You can make up your own, or use my cornball suggestion.
For example, for the three sounds of a, you can use “I ate all the apple.”
Association is a great aid in phonics.
When your child is learning the correct printing of a, review the three key-
words, the three sounds, and the associative sentence. When he prints the
letter a, have him sound it quietly each time. He can sound either the short a
or all three sounds of a, depending on how the letter is introduced. This 
practice is the standard procedure for all the vowels. The vowels e and i have
only two sounds. The vowels a, o, and u have three sounds each. See the
Cheat Sheet in the front of this book for the keywords. Don’t forget to look at
the Chapter 2 vowel chart.
Perfecting the blending
Even a powerful vowel like a does not a language make. Combining it with
other letters is a challenge you introduce with a few easy steps.
46
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

As you work through the following steps, repeat any or all of them until
you’re confident that your child gets the idea. Blending the initial consonant
and vowel is the most important step on your journey to reading smoothly.
You need patience and perseverance when you’re first working on blending.
Blend ma, and then sa, and then ta together — don’t sound the letters in 
isolation. By this I mean, don’t say m, pause and say a. Put these sounds
together in a nanosecond of time. Your homemade cards for these directives
are t, s, m, a, ma, sa, and ta. The first three cards are consonants that blend
with the fourth card, which is a vowel. The blending cards are ma, sa, and ta.
Although you’re using the ma, sa, and ta cards first, proceed to create the ma
t, sa t, and ta t cards also. You may want to have your picture keyword cards
in the mix or refer to them before you start the instruction.
Follow these steps to help your child become a master blender:
1. Hold up the flashcard with ma printed on it.
2. Read the word to your child.
As you say ma, make sure you slide both sounds together as you slide
your finger underneath the word.
3. Ask your child to say ma.
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 with sa.
5. Repeat steps 1 through 3 with ta.
This combination is a little harder because you can’t say these two 
letters slowly together. If you try, it sounds like tuh-ah. To clip off the
sound, imagine the end of the word tat. Do you hear the end t? That’s 
the clipped off t you need.
6. Show your child a flashcard with ma t printed on it with a definite
space between a and t.
7. Ask your child to say ma t.
8. Present the entire word mat with no breaks between any letters.
9. Ask your child to say mat.
When your child can say this word correctly and smoothly, he has
decoded his first word all by himself — a tremendous accomplishment.
The process in this section is the logical method for decoding all the words in
Table 3-1, and for any further independent word analysis. Good word analysis
(decoding) is just a matter of knowing sounds and blending them together.
47
Chapter 3: Starting with Simple Consonants and a Vowel

To recap: Your child has three sight words: a, the, and and in his flashcard
box. Along with those he has the m, s, t, a keyword cards, the m, s, t, a pho-
netic flashcards, and some ma, sa, ta phonetic blending cards. You can add a
few whole word blending cards such as mat, sass, and at.
Check out Figure 3-1 to see samples of your first pile of flashcards. In this chap-
ter, I give you more keywords that you can use for flashcards. Refer to Chapter 2
for details on handling your flashcards. Appendix C contains keyword card
examples you can photocopy and use for this chapter’s lessons.

Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 
Recipe for smooth reading
After reading the first sentences following Table
3-1 and learning super blending instructions
within this chapter, you and your child are ready
to learn a simple technique for smooth reading.
From the get-go, your child becomes a smooth
and fluent reader. If you do as I say, you prevent
him from becoming a word reader. I define this
as a slow, choppy, flat-toned reader. This habit
is hard to unlearn.
Here’s how to become the best reader in the
class:
 From the first moment the child begins to
read, tell him to read every word of the sen-
tence silently. (Remember that with proper
word study, he should know every word in
the sentence.)
 After the silent reading, tell him to say the
sentence as if he’s talking. Proceed to the
next sentences in the same manner.
 Illustrate the procedure first by reading sev-
eral sentences this way. Read the sen-
tences with accent and fluency, and ask the
child to repeat the sentence to you.
In a comparatively short time, the silent reading
step falls by the wayside and smoothness in oral
reading becomes automatic.
After your child gets the hang of sounding out
words, it becomes as engrossing as a puzzle.
The danger is that sounding out words will
become an end in itself. So, from the very first
sentence, you must make reading meaningful
by asking a few questions: “Who sat? What did
Matt do?” These questions bring the child back
to the ground and help him remember that the
words have meanings. He can easily answer the
questions in the short sentences after Table 3-1.
But as his reading skills advance, asking the
who, what, when, where, why, and how ques-
tions will help his comprehension advance as
well. Also, this practice assists him in learning
how to construct and diagram sentences.
For best results, learn a new phonics lesson
every day early in the morning when you and
your child are fresh. Make frequent use of flash-
cards to focus attention on new material and as
a means of rapid review. Even if your schedule
prevents you from this routine, you should
review the flashcards every day and then go on
to something new. No matter how short the
lesson, keep moving forward.

As you proceed in the lessons and when your child reads the tables, be ready
with keyword cards, homemade letter cards, and blending cards.

Chapter 3: Starting with Simple Consonants and a Vowel

Going Deeper with Consonants 
and Keywords
Grab the beginning instructions for scripts from the beginning of this chapter,
and the table and the tips, and apply them to the rest of the chapter. You may
wonder why I present this particular sequence of letters. When I first learned
the phonics method, I had no idea that you don’t teach the ABC’s in alphabet-
ical order. You have to trust me on this. Each grouping of letters is in its place
for a reason . . . the reason being that it works better!
Dam and gas
Phonics teaches the d and g next because of their ease in lettering. After the
child can print the letter a, he can easily learn to print d and g.
When sounding these letters, use the same care that you use in sounding the
t. Avoid the duh and guh sounds. In fact, don’t spend much time on the single
consonants. Concentrate on the keywords and blend with the vowels as
quickly as possible.
Add the da and ga flashcards to your collection. With the flashcards ma, sa,
ta, da, and ga, you can rapidly review the three sounds of a. If you choose to
teach all three sounds, first flash the short a sound, and then the second
sound of a, and then the third sound.
As your child adds new consonants and vowels to his knowledge, he contin-
ues to review every day. The main emphasis stays on the short sounds that 
I present up to and including Chapter 6. Table 3-2 shows how to blend some
consonants sounds with a. Follow each column from top to bottom to blend
the sounds and form the keyword.

After your child masters the words in Table 3-2, have him read the following
sentences for practice. The goal is for him to be able to read the way he
speaks.
Mag sat a dam.
Dad sat at a mat.
Sam sat at a dam.
Use the following keywords to help your child learn the d and g:
Dd: duck
Gg: gum
For the corresponding sounds on the CD, please listen to Track 6 for d and
Track 7 for hard g.
Fad and hat
Table 3-3 requires the same blending and reading that Table 3-1 requires. F’s
and h’s are easy to blend. Hey, you want to test your child’s hearing? Ask him
to close his eyes and hear you sound f. Ask him what he hears. He should say
f. Now ask him to close his eyes while you sound the th sound — as in thud.
He should repeat th. You’re testing his auditory discrimination, which is the
ability to hear similarities and differences in sounds. Be sure to do this exer-
cise frequently to make sure he hears the sounds correctly. Lots of times,
kids with chronic earaches don’t hear the sounds properly.
51
Chapter 3: Starting with Simple Consonants and a Vowel
Dam isn’t a bad word
Most of the time when I teach Table 3-2, 
the subject of dam and damn comes up. The
kids are reluctant to sound this word because
they think that they’re saying a bad word. I
always stop and draw a picture of a dam. We
discuss beavers that build dams, and the kids
are reassured that this word is okay. Obviously,
the curse word damn may have crossed their
paths at some time, but this gives you the oppor-
tunity to teach a little science lesson. You can
often include a science, history, or vocabulary
lesson along with the phonics lesson.

hag
After your child masters the words in Table 3-3, have him read the following
sentences for practice.
Matt had a ham.
Tad had a sad hat.
A hag had a fat ham.
Suggested keywords for this section include the following:
Hh: hat
Ff: fad
Start your lesson with a review of names, keywords, and sounds of previously
taught letters. It’s okay to overstress the new sounds in the words at the
beginning of the table. Make sure, however, that your child doesn’t read all
words stretched out like that. Try not to get involved in sloooow sounding of
the sounds in words.
For the corresponding sounds on the CD, please listen to Track 8 for f and
Track 9 for h.

Fish in hats: Grammar versus imagination
When your child is reading sentences, inject a
little grammar. Have you and your child ever
seen a fish wear a hat? Probably not, but you
can have a grammatically correct sentence
that’s total nonsense. Now is a good time to
explain this to your child, because he has not
only started to read sentences, but is also at the
age of discerning what’s real and unreal. When
you teach grammar you teach sentences and
composition.

Pad and rat
If you have a sharp sense of hearing, you may realize that some of the basic
consonant sounds are voiceless. Voiceless means that you can make the
sound with no vibration of the vocal chords. Earlier in this chapter, I spend
some time on the t so that you know not to add the dreaded uh to it. Be just
as careful with the puffy p. Say p-! (a popping noise) instead of saying puh.
In this section, I also introduce you to the r, an easy sound to pick up at the
beginning of a word, but a killer at the end of a word. Kids commonly can’t
say rrr. Adding a layer of confusion is the difference in pronunciation
throughout the United States and also in Great Britain and Australia. Have
you ever been to Puth — I mean Perth? The British dictionary solves your
problem if you can’t say rrr — the word doctor, for example, is pronounced
dok’ tuh. Instead of affecting a British accent, I encourage you and your child
to do your best with the American r sound.
Check out Table 3-4 to blend the letters p and r.

After your child masters the words in Table 3-4, have him read the following
sentences for practice. The goal is for him to be able to read as he speaks, so
you want him to read each sentence to himself and then say it out loud with
expression, naturally speaking the words in the sentence.
Pam had a map.
Dad had a fat ram.
A rat had a pad.
Use the following keywords to help your child learn the p and the r:
Pp: pad
Rr: rat
53
Chapter 3: Starting with Simple Consonants and a Vowel

For smooth reading, follow these steps:
1. Think the keyword: rat
2. Articulate just that sound needed: r
3. Blend the consonant with the vowel and continue to the next sound:
ra t
4. Read the sentences silently first and then orally as you would say
them in conversation.
For the corresponding sounds on the CD, please listen to Track 10 for p and
Track 11 for r.
Nap and bat
I want you to teach the b far after the d (see earlier in the chapter for more 
on teaching the d). Many kids have a hard time seeing the difference between
these two letters. This type of error really hurts when your child is saying the
wrong sound because he confuses b and d. When you’re ready for this phon-
ics lesson, you want to make a big deal only out of the structure of the b. In
other words, don’t say the d goes this way and the b goes the other way. Also,
don’t tell him about the problem before he actually makes the mistake . . .
you may just put ideas in his head. Some children don’t encounter this prob-
lem, so you may get lucky.
Here’s a technique to help your child keep b and d straight:
1. Draw a picture of a baseball bat and a baseball and say, “The bat
comes before the ball when it’s a b.”
2. Trace over the picture from left to right and say, “The bat comes
before the ball.”
3. Trace the b in the air and on the table, saying “b. b. b. b. b.”
The n sound and its keyword, nest, present very little trouble. Sometimes kids
with weak auditory skills may confuse the sound with m, but it’s not terribly
common. Have your child read the blending table for n and b (Table 3-5) by
using his freshly learned skill.

For the corresponding sounds on the CD, listen to Track 12 for n and Track 13

Van, jab, wag, and quack
These four letters (v, j, w, and q) have few practice words, because so few
one-syllable words that start with these letters have the short sound of a in
them. 
Q is a special case because it is always written in English followed by u. This
u isn’t sounded as a vowel. To show that the letters q and u belong together,
they’re underlined (qu). Be sure to teach the easy sound of w and make sure
your child is familiar with the sound of k before teaching q (qu), because its
sound is kw.
The letter j is easy, and so is v. Both are a snap for the kids. Table 3-6 helps
you blend the sounds.

ask him to read each sentence to himself and then say it out loud with
expression.
Jack had jam and ham.
Van can wag a rag.
Kat can quack at a pal.
Use the following keywords when you’re teaching these letters:
Jj: jab
Qq: quack
Vv: van
Ww: web
For corresponding sounds on the CD, listen to Track 14 for j, Track 15 for v,
Track 16 for k, and Track 17 for w.
Yakkety yak with tax and zap
X has three sounds, and the most common is ks, which is the one I’m sticking
to for now. Help your child master the k and s sounds first, and then master-
ing x should be easier. The letter y is a stinker. For some weird reason, most
kids have a rough time learning it, perhaps because unlike most (but not 
all) other consonants, when you say the name of the consonant, you’re not
saying its sound. That is, when you say the name of the letter b, you’re saying
its sound. However, when you say the name of the letter y, you’re saying the
/w/ sound. I sing the “Yakkety Yak Don’t Talk Back” ditty, which helps. Thanks
to words like zipper and zoo, kids usually get z! Table 3-7 helps you blend
these letters.

Max had a map and an ax.
A yak can ram Jack.

For the corresponding sounds on the CD, listen to Track 3 for s, Track 16 for

The secret of successful learning is to link as much as you can with other
subjects. When your child has the basic consonants and short vowel a down
pat, he’s reading lots of words, so you can zero in on some sentence structur-
ing with him. Soon, through this step-by-step process, he’ll be able to write
and read his own creative sentences. Try the following tips to give his begin-
ning attempts the greatest impact:
 Practice capital letters, periods, and the meaning of sentences by copy-
ing the practice sentences after each table in this chapter.
 After giving instruction on capitals and punctuation, and after lots of
copying practice, have your child apply these skills when writing simple
sentences from your dictation.
 Finally, ask your child to try it on his own by writing simple and correct
sentences.

Pulling it all together
This review gives your child great satisfaction as he realizes that he has the
power to unlock every one of the words in the following list, showcasing the
short sound of a as in apple. Play “up and down the ladder” by going up and
down the list, pointing to words as he reads them:

Have your child read these sentences for practice after he masters the words
in the previous list:
Dan can jab at a yak.
Jack had a cap.
A lad ran at a tan van.
Now you can begin a new phase of association: auditory awareness. That’s
just a fancy way of saying ordinary dictated spelling. If you arrange the words
into rhyming lists (word strips — check out Chapter 2), this task will be

easier for your child, and he’ll have almost instant success as long as the first
word is correct. Word strips are introduced here, because now you have all
these consonants to use with the short vowel. In this example, the word 
strip is used as a dictation tool for spelling on a printing tablet. Some 
examples are:
bad, cad, dad, fad, had, lad, mad, pad, sad, add, ad
bag, hag, gag, jag, lag, nag, rag, sag, tag, wag
back, hack, lack, jack, pack, quack, rack, sack, tack
Make sure that you stress the correct left-to-right initial blending in dictation,
such as ba d, ca d. Be careful not to teach the -ad family, because your child
will focus on the end of the word, which teaches regressive eye movement,
meaning that the child reads the end of the word first and then goes to the
beginning — a recipe for disaster. Can you imagine reading smoothly with
that maneuver?
When you dictate spelling words, say the word, use it in a sentence, and then
repeat the word. Because your child’s printing is in the early stage, don’t
burden him with too many words. I suggest five words at this point in time.
However, his reading prowess allows him to read tons of words.
At this point of your teaching, with the addition of a few common sight 
words — verbs (were, was), prepositions (of, to), pronouns (I, you), and 
the articles (a, the) — the possibilities for creative sentence writing widen
considerably. Here are some key strategies for making sentence writing a 
success:
 Don’t use too many sentences at any one time.
 Don’t introduce too many new words at one time.
 In general, use about five words, maximum, in one sentence.
 The idea is to do just a few, but do them correctly, demanding sentences
with the correct punctuation. Unlearning bad habits is difficult. Of
course, you also don’t want to be so strict that you hurt your child’s
feelings. Sometimes, you need to give a little. If he’s writing a letter to
Daddy, ease off.
 Use some nonphonetic words like of, to, and was. Your child needs to
know that not all English words are phonetic. He must cope with words
that don’t sound like they’re spelled or don’t follow the guidelines of
phonics.
59
Chapter 3: Starting with Simple Consonants and a Vowel

As nonphonetic words like of begin to show up, find a box and call it jail. Put
of in the box, because it doesn’t follow the guidelines. I get dramatic here,
and the kids learn of by sight, because it’s a bad guy! Your child will love
throwing a word in jail and letting it out when you need to flash the word 
to him.
When teaching the and a, don’t allow the kids to say thee and ay. These are
correct pronunciations only when employing emphasis. Most of the time,
both of these words have a short-short uh sound.
Learning punctuation, declarative, interrogative, and exclamatory sentences
comes naturally as you progress. Keep it simple and your child can learn by
reading sentences and little stories. Some examples are:
Dan and Jim were at the dam.
Were Dan and Jim at the dam?
Mom, Dan, and Jim were at the dam!
Next Stop: c, k, ck, and l
You’re clicking along with click and clack — an exciting time to be adding the
ck. The k sound shows itself as c, k, and ck. It makes it easy to sound but hard
to spell.
The l, on the other hand, has a sound all its own. Say the l sound and notice
your tongue’s position. Different, eh? With a keyword, lamp, it’s not a prob-
lem for sounding and blending, but at times the kids get it visually confused
with the number 1, or they say “I”.
The quantity of your word bank is growing by leaps and bounds. On some
oaktag paper, print the letters m, s, t, a, d, g, f, h, p, r, n, b, c, k, l, and ck — all
in lowercase. Cut them apart so that each letter is on its own card, and place
them in a box. Throw lots of a’s in the mix. Your child can scatter them out
on the table and make words from them. You can guide him toward making
up sentences, also. Bear in mind that he’s just a beginner. If he makes five
words with the letters, that’s awesome. This practice reinforces correct 
reading and spelling.
Reinforce this lesson by asking your child to copy the letters and words in
Table 3-8 on a printing tablet. As you go along, your child can do so many
60
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

little things to advance his skills. He should sound quietly to himself every
time he’s doing these miniactivities.

A man had a pan and a rack.
A lad ran back at a cab.
Keywords that help you teach the letters in this section include the following:
Kk: kid
ck: clock
Cc: cat
Ll: lamp
Although I show you four keywords, Table 3-8 presents just two sounds. Hard
c has the sound of k, and it’s the only sound of c that you teach your child for
some time. The consonant digraph ck also has the sound of k. It’s used at the
end of most short-vowel words for which the k sound immediately follows a
short-vowel sound. A consonant digraph comes about when two letters join
together to make a new sound.
The ck is easy to sound, but spelling it can be tricky. Don’t expect your child
to use ck correctly for a little while. This is where the visual sense sets in, and
he begins to see these two letters together. Try not to get involved with the
soft c (as in ice) for a long time. If you read a word like nice, tell him it’s a soft
c, but teach it as a sight word for now. The sound will undoubtedly come up
before you get to the lesson in Chapter 13.
61
Chapter 3: Starting with Simple Consonants and a Vowel

Here are two recommended sight words to add to your flashcards: were and
was. By this time, your child is getting the hang of look/say words along with
oodles of phonetic words. Ask him to count the words in the tables he’s read
so far, and find out many words he knows.
For the corresponding sounds on the CD, listen to Track 16 for the hard k
sound, and Track 20 for l.

Chapter 4
Finishing Short Vowels 
and Seeing Patterns
In This Chapter
 Learning the rest of the short-vowel sounds (i, u, o, and e)
 Recognizing consonant-vowel-consonant (cvc) patterns in words
 Discovering the sandwich pattern
I
n this chapter, you switch gears and go from exploring the sound of 
short a to exploring the short sounds of these four vowels: i, u, o, and e.
Learning how to read words with these four vowels (and the letter a) is the
first step in reading. It amazes me how well most kids handle it. Early in the
study of phonics, sound patterns begin to emerge, and it always delights me
to see children beginning to recognize these patterns as they discover how 
to read.
Becoming acquainted with vowels and consonants is the beginning of reading
success. Besides explaining four new vowels, this chapter explains how to
introduce the structural pattern of consonants and vowels. Being able to read
and spell a lot of words is within your child’s grasp when she masters the
concepts in this chapter. I include lots of short-vowel ministories for practice.
Exploring the Short i Sound
Here’s an effective way to teach your child the short i sound: Show her a
short i flashcard — make one for “India,” for example — and say, “®, India.
Repeat after me: i (letter name), /i/ (letter sound), India (keyword).” India
makes a very a precise, short-vowel letter i sound.

64
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 
Moving from short i to short a may startle your child, and explaining the dif-
ference between vowels and consonants may be difficult. I ease into it by
trying to talk without vowels and showing how speech sounds without
vowels. I introduce myself to the children by using only the consonants in my
name, Ssn Grv. Then I talk without vowel sounds, asking them to do it as well.
After a few minutes of this, everyone is laughing. By explaining to children
how vowels give the language cadence and flow, you’re really on your way.
Consider the correct blending of the consonants with short i as your child
recites the words in the following list. The list illustrates how different conso-
nants blend with the short i sound. Although the blending is relatively easy,
remember that your child is just learning a different vowel sound, so take it
slowly. Read down from the top, savoring the way these i words sound. You
can copy the words from this and any of other lists or tables in this book.

Follow the list with a reading lesson using the following sentences, making
sure that your child reads these silently first, and then says them out loud.
This will be the constant procedure for the vowels as you move along:
Dick and Sis will mix jam.
Jim can sit and hit a tin lid.
Bill and Rick did a quick jig.

If your child has trouble understanding what sound the short i makes, tell her
to say the word it. Tell her to notice the position of her mouth and tongue as
she says the word it. Tell her that the i sound in it is the short i sound.
Activity: Short Stories
To play: Here are some short stories that your child can read to reinforce the
short i sound:
 The Big Bib: Liz had a big bib. The big bib was for Nick. Sis will fix the
big bib for Nick. Did the big bib fit him?
 A Quick Jig: Tim and Sis were at the rim of the hill. Sis ran to Rick. Sis
did a quick jig for Rick and said, “It is a quick jig.”
 The Big Wig: Jill had a wig. The wig was big for Jim. The big wig was for
Sam. Jim and Jill will miss the big wig.
Activity: Word Strips: Short i
Preparation: You need paper and pencil.
To play: Sit next to your child, and read the following word strip (Chapter 2
explains how to teach with and create word strips):
big, rig, wig, dig, fig, pig, gig, jig
bit, fit, hit, lit, kit, mitt, pit, quit, sit, wit, zit
dip, hip, jip, lip, nip, pip, quip, rip, sip, tip, zip
For the corresponding sound on the CD, listen to Track 21 for the short i.
Understanding the Difference 
between a and i
I introduce vowel sounds in Chapter 3, where your child discovers the
sounds made by the letter a. At this point, as you introduce the letter i,
you want your child to understand the differences between a and i. She
needs to clearly understand that different vowels make different sounds.
65
Chapter 4: Finishing Short Vowels and Seeing Patterns

One way to teach her the difference between the vowels is by reciting the
words in the following list to review the sounds of a and i with your child;
then have your child read the words. As your child reads them together,
she’ll get used to differentiating the two sounds:

For practice, after your child recites the words in the list, have her read the
following sentences. Have her read them silently first, and then say them out
loud.
Jill had a big fat pig.
A man did fill a vat.
Rick had him pick a kit and a wig.
Making the Acquaintance of Short u
The short u sound is fun and easy to teach. Many people automatically want
to add the uh sound when making the sound of most consonants. For exam-
ple, to pronounce the word bite, you say buh-ite. Words that make the short u
sound include cub, gut, and tug. Have your child practice reading the short u
words in the following list:
buck
bud
buff
bug
bum
bus

Gus will run and hug Sis.
Liz had a bug, a duck, and a pup.
Tim can fix a jug and a cup.
Activity: Jokes
Preparation: You need paper and pencil.
To play: Rewrite this joke on a piece of paper. Then read the joke out loud to
your child. Tell her to listen carefully for words that have the short u sound.
After she identifies them, write them on a printing tablet for her to copy.
Slugs in a Huff
Q. What did the unlucky slug say to the other slug, who had cuffed him
and run off?
A. You bum! I’ll get you the next slime!

Answer Key: slug, cuff, run, bum
Activity: Stories
To play: Here are some very short stories that your child can read to 
reinforce the short u sound.
A Big Bug
Bud had a big bug. The big bug was a tick. The bug will buzz at the pug.
The Tan Rug
Gus had a cup of fuzz. The fuzz was from a tan rug. Gus will lug the rug to
the sun.
Fun in the Mud
Bud had a mutt. The mutt was a pug. The bug and the pug dug the mud
and hid a bug.
As your child progresses in reading, you can refer to the Dolch list in Chap-
ter 2 and add a few sight words to her flashcard collection. The word knowl-
edge enables your child to advance in sentence reading a bit faster. Sight
words here include from, I, and you.
Here are some suggested word strips for short U:
cut, but, gut, hut, jut, mutt, nut, put, rut, tut
rug, bug, dug, hug, lug, jug, mug, pug, tug
bum, gum, hum, mum, sum, yum
For the corresponding sound on the CD, listen to Track 22 for the short u
sound.
Summing Up Short a, i, and u
Quite soon, your child will progress to the short o sound, but first, she
should clearly understand which sounds the short u, i, and a make. Make
sure your child can read these three short-vowel sounds before proceeding
to the next letter. If your child makes an error while reading these words,
gently correct her. Remind her that with a short-vowel sound, the vowel
doesn’t say its letter’s name. For example, short a says aahhh (what doctors
ask you to say when they look at your throat), not A (like the letter grade).

Bud and Jill had mud in a tub.
Russ will sit and hug his tin bus.
Activity: Stories
To play: Here are some very short stories to reinforce short-vowel sounds.
Ask your child to read the stories smoothly and with expression.
Fun for Rick
Rick dug the mud. The mud and the muck was fun for Rick to dig. Sam
said Rick was a nut to dig at the mud.
Sam and Jill
Sam and Jill sat at the mud hut. Jill had a sub for Sam. Sam had a nut for
Jill. The sub and the nut were big.

Fun at the Tub
Dick and the duck had fun at the tub. The duck hid the tub and a cup at
the mud hut. Dick will look for the tub and the cup.
Getting Acquainted with Short o
I’m inclined to burst into song when I teach the short o sound. I like to sing, “I
am an ©pera singer! I sing ©!” Then I sing the scales. The bolder children usu-
ally sing along with me, and if the children don’t get the message of what the
short o sounds like, I get out the tongue depressor and tell the kids to open
their mouths and say, “‰.” My keyword card for the short o has an ostrich on
it. This word has a great short o sound and gives you the opportunity to
teach your child about the ostrich burying its head in the sand.
The short sound of o is the most difficult vowel sound to say exactly the
same way in all words that have the sound. When you make the short o
sound, the throat muscles tend to constrict, so encourage your child to relax
her throat when making the o sound. The best way to get a child to make the
short o sound properly is to have her practice saying the word ostrich.
The short sound of o is the most difficult vowel sound to say exactly the
same in all words. When you sound it alone, your throat is in a very relaxed
position. As soon as a consonant precedes the o or follows it, the throat mus-
cles slightly tense and modify the sound. The best advice to give is to get as
close as you can to the ostrich keyword and let it go at that. Now it’s time to
recite the short o within words. Check out the following list:

Chapter 4: Finishing Short Vowels and Seeing Patterns
For practice, have your child read the following sentences. Have her read
them silently first and then say them out loud.
Mom and Rob had pop.
Bob got a rock in a sock.
Don and Tom will hop on a box.
Activity: Joke
To play: Have your child shout the short o sound “©” when she hears the
short o vowel sounds in the following joke.
Tom Popp’s Alphabet
Little Tom Popp’s first grade teacher, Mrs. Hopkins, is quizzing the kids
on the alphabet.
“Tom,” she says, “what comes after o?”
Tom ponders the question and says, “Yeah!”
Answer Key: Tom, Popp, Hopkins, on, ponders
Activity: Stories
To play: Here are some short stories your child can read to reinforce the
short o sound.
Bob and the Hot Dog
Sal was a fat cat. Bob was a lad. Bob had a hot dog in his van. Sal hid in
the back of the van. Bob ran and ran. Sal got the hot dog.

The Job
The boss had a job for Tom but the lad was six. Tom ran to his dad. Rob
did the job for Tom. The boss was not mad at Tom.
The Box for Dad
Jim and Jack had a box at the top of the hill. The box was not for Dad.
Mom said Dad was mad at Jim and Jack. Jim and Jack got a box for Dad.
Activity: Word Strips: Short o
Preparation: You need paper and pencil.
To play: Sit next to your child and read the following word strips (Chapter 2
explains how to teach with and create word strips):
bob, cob, fob, gob, job, lob, mob, rob, sob
cot, dot, got, hot, jot, lot, mot, pot, rot, sot
bop, fop, hop, lop, mop, pop, sop, top
For the corresponding sound on the CD, listen to Track 23 for the short o.
Introducing Short e
Here I introduce your child to the short e as heard in the word elephant. This
sound can be tricky, because it’s spoken differently depending on which
region you live in. Do you say pinny or penny? Do you say cint or cent? Listen
carefully as your child says the first syllable, eh, in elephant. If she has a hard
time pronouncing the short e sound or making the distinction between e and
i, have her say the word echo or etch.
The e and i have something in common: Neither has a third sound, which is
good news because that’s two fewer sounds for your child to know. For addi-
tional reference, please review the vowel chart in Chapter 2.
Have your child read the short e words in the following list:

After your child recites the words in the list, have her practice by reading the
following sentences, first silently and then out loud.
Bess met Ben and hid him.
Peg will wed Jim yet.
Nell will get less gum.
Activity: Joke
Preparation: You need paper and pencil.
To play: Have your child identify the words that make the short e sound in
this joke. Then have your child print the words with one syllable as you 
dictate them. Also, ask her whether she understands the joke.
Ben’s Elephant
Ben: Hey Rex! My elephant has no trunk!
Rex: What a mess! How does it smell?
Ben: Terrible!
Answer Key (short e words): Ben, Rex, mess, smell, terrible

Activity: Stories
To play: Here are some very short stories that your child can read to 
reinforce her understanding of the short e sound.
A Wet Pet
Bess met a wet pet. The pet was a red rock. The rock fell and hit a 
net web.
A Keg to Sell
Ben had a jug of jam. Can Ben sell Ted a pot of jam? Ted did not have a
keg for his jam. Bill will sell a keg to Ted.
A Red Bell for Rex
Rex led ten men to the van. The van had less gas. Rex let Ned have a red
bell for his van.
Jen and the Pig
Jen had a pet pig. The pet pig had a big pen. The pigpen had mud in it.
The pig did not sit in the pen. The pig did not run in the pen. The pig is a
pal and a pet.
Activity: Can You Hear Me?
To play: Can You Hear Me? is a game that can be played with one to ten
people. This game helps teach the short e sound and gives practice in audi-
tory perception.
1. Assign your child a name that starts with a short e.
Some names to choose from: Edward, Emmett, Eldon, Ezra, Elmer, Elliot,
Edgar, Eric, Emily, Esther, Effie, Ellen, Eleanor, Etta, Esmeralda, or Emma.
2. Have her hide and instruct her not to come out until she hears her
name being called.
3. Call out all the e names I list in Step 1.
4. When you call her name, have her come out and say her name.
You can keep playing the game, giving her a different name each time.
The parent can switch roles with the child. The idea is to hammer home
the sound made by the short e.

Recognizing Consonant-Vowel-Consonant
(CVC) Patterns
After you and your child finish with the short vowels, as covered earlier in
this chapter and in Chapter 3, your child may begin to notice that when a
vowel appears in a word, it often appears between two consonants. Has she
asked you for help in figuring out this pattern? Most one-syllable, short-vowel
words (such as hop and dig) present a consonant-vowel-consonant (cvc) pat-
tern. Because 62 percent of words in English have short vowels, your child
would do well to recognize the cvc pattern. This way, she can quickly decode
many different words.
I like to wait to introduce the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern until the
short vowels have been covered, because I’d rather have children find it on
their own. If you give your child some hints, she may find the cvc pattern 
in words such as cat and dog. When kids find patterns on their own, they usu-
ally don’t tell you. It merely becomes an unconscious part of their reading
progress.
Learning vowel patterns is phonics in action. Decoding words is like solving a
puzzle. When first presented with pieces to a picture puzzle, your child works
hard to fit them together and derives great satisfaction upon completing the
puzzle.
At first, simply say, “When an a comes between two consonants, it’s usually a
short a.” Use the same approach with all the short-vowel sounds. The idea is
to let her notice the pattern before trying to explain what a vowel is. Then
she’s able to accept the definition of the word called vowel.
75
Chapter 4: Finishing Short Vowels and Seeing Patterns

Teaching patterns
In order for your child to read well she needs to be able to recognize vowel
patterns, such as cvc. In the previous chapters, she read four-letter, one-
syllable words. The cvc blueprint presents itself in all the phonics words she
has learned thus far. But now I introduce it as a pattern that she’ll see, not
only as a whole word, but also in parts of words.
Vowel patterns are the building blocks for word constructions. Each time
your child figures out how the pieces go together, the words that follow that
pattern get easier and easier to read. At some point, she finishes that one and
wants a new puzzle to solve.
Eventually, reading’s no longer a puzzle, and becomes something she does
automatically. Kids stop getting satisfaction from decoding, and begin reading
for enjoyment. Some kids get to this stage very quickly; others take longer.
But the benefits of recognizing vowel patterns help all kids get to that stage.
Discovering the cvc guidelines
Usually, when a word or syllable has only one vowel and the vowel comes
between two consonants, the vowel is short. This cvc (consonant-vowel-
consonant) guideline is also sometimes called the sandwich pattern. Think of
the cvc pattern looking something like a sandwich, with the consonants form-
ing the bread slices and the vowel serving as the peanut butter.
Your child needs to memorize this guideline. Sorry, there’s no getting around
it. I prefer to call memorization a “repeat after me” experience. Add a flash-
card covering this guideline to her collection so that she can hold it in her
memory bank. Even if a child forgets the guideline, she can see the pattern
and apply it.
Have your child point out the consonant-vowel-consonant patterns in the
words in the following list:

Joining Consonants Together 
to Make More Sounds
In This Chapter
 Understanding consonant digraphs
 Discovering consonant blends
 Seeing beginning and end blends
 Sounding out vowels at the start of words
 Looking at some quirky blends
T
his chapter plunges into discovering letters that join together to make
totally new sounds from what I cover in the earlier chapters, as well as
blocks of letters that keep their own sounds when they join together. For
beginning readers, sounds such as those made by wh, th, and ng can be diffi-
cult. This chapter offers many fun techniques to help a child explore these
and other sounds in reading. Your child can discover how to blend conso-
nants at the start and end of words (beginning and ending consonant
blends), how to pronounce vowels at the beginning of words, and how to
sound out the tch sound, among other things.
To keep your child on the straight and narrow as he learns to read, this chapter
describes concepts, but at the same time provides hands-on learning tech-
niques. I add a few more sight words and some fun stuff with tongue twisters,
ditties, and other skill boosters. Everything has been bumped up a notch in
this chapter. Therefore, your child may need to slow down a bit in order to
absorb all the material in this chapter.

80
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 
Delving into Digraphs (Two Letters, 
One Sound)
A consonant digraph is a two-letter combination that produces a single
speech sound in which the sound isn’t represented by either letter alone 
(ch, sh, th, and wh, for example). Ch is a common consonant digraph; examples
include inch and chill. It makes its own sound — a sound that has nothing in
common with the sound made by c or the sound made by h. Sh is another
common consonant digraph; examples include ship and cash. Again, sh makes
a sound completely different from the sound made by s or h. If you have 
trouble remembering what a digraph is, consider the etymology of the word:
In Greek, di means “two” and graph means “letter.”
Your child can learn to sound consonant digraphs easily by isolating them in
the keywords, and making keyword cards. Keyword cards are incredibly
useful for learning digraphs because they allow your child to make an instant
connection to different sounds. Make sure your child makes use of the follow-
ing keywords before reading Table 5-1: inch, chip, ship, whip, this, thumb, 
ring, and bank. These words contain all the consonant digraphs that are 
introduced in this chapter. Accordingly, make flashcards of these individual
digraphs: ch, sh, wh, th, th, ng, nk (the th is for the sound in the and then).
Teach and review them until your child understands that these particular
combinations of letters are “two-in-one” jobs.
Discovering consonant digraphs
Now that you’ve been introduced to digraphs, you can make the leap to actu-
ally sounding out some of the words. For this lesson, look at the consonant
digraphs that are embedded in the short-vowel words found in Table 5-1.
Work through the table as usual. Ask your child to go from the top down in
the columns.
Because this lesson involves a different and more difficult concept of blend-
ing, it should be undertaken at a slow, even pace. At this point, your child 
has the short vowels down; now he can concentrate on learning consonant
digraphs.

Which shell did his dad mash with a ring?
For the corresponding sounds on the CD, listen to Track 25 for sh, Track 26
for ch, Track 27 for wh, Track 28 for th, and Track 29 for th.
Sounding seven digraphs
I call the seven consonant digraphs the basic ones. I’m hinting that more may
come, but in this chapter I concentrate on the basics. Observe in the follow-
ing instructions on sounding these digraphs that letters your child already
knows as individual sounds change into new sounds when joined.
Chugging along with ch and sh
The ch and sh sounds are the easiest of the bunch. With ch, you can take
advantage of the ruler and use it to show your child what an inch is and how
to mark off an inch. You can also try the “chug-a-chug-choo-choo” method of
reinforcing what a digraph is. Take your hands and rotate them like turning
wheels, saying, ch, ch, ch as you make the train sound. You can even sing
the “Little Red Caboose” song.
Older children may know some exceptions to the basic ch sound that I present
here and point them out to you. “What about chute, ache, and Christmas?” they
may ask. These words contain the letters ch, but they don’t follow the basic ch
sound. Explain that the English language is complicated, and point out to the
children how smart they are for noticing the different ways that ch is used.
81
Chapter 5: Joining Consonants Together to Make More Sounds

The sh sound is also simple. Beside the keyword ship, you can put your finger
on your lips and say shhh!
Whipping through wh
The diagraph wh is correctly said in a “blowy” manner. Don’t be confused by
the fact that the wh digraph comes off as a hw sound. Tell your child to make
the sound for the consonant digraph wh as if he were blowing on a pinwheel.
You can also tear off a piece of tissue and tell him to put it on the top of his
hand and blow it off to make the hw sound. Say, “That’s the sound for wh” as
the tissue falls to the floor. (Some common wh words are nonphonetic. These
words include who, whom, and whose, which have a silent w. I get to those
miscreants later.)
Twice the fun with th and th
Th has two distinct basic sounds — voiced and voiceless. To make both
sounds, you start by placing the lips and tongue in the same position.
However, the sounds originate in different places:
 Voiced th sound: The voiced th sound originates in the throat. You can
hear it in that and there. If your child says these words correctly, he can
feel their vibration by placing his fingers lightly on his throat. Show your
child the line through the th in the flashcard that indicates a voiced th
sound and tell your child to think of this line as his tongue. When he
makes the th sound, say, “Tickle your tongue.” This is a kinesthetic tool
to distinguish between the two sounds of th. A ask him to do the exer-
cise because it actually does tickle his tongue.
82
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 
A word about line markers
In the phonological process of sounding out
words, a child can get offline, lose his place,
and have to double back. This can break his
concentration and tear his fluency to shreds. If
the child’s finger isn’t helping him locate words
on the page, I recommend temporarily using a
line marker such as a ruler or strip of cardboard.
A line marker can really help him to stay on
track and concentrate on developing smooth
reading skills. It also discourages young read-
ers from looking around the page for contextual
clues such as pictures — a very bad habit that
can slow down advances in reading skill. I sug-
gest using a line marker that has no designs on
it, that covers the width of the page, and is a
pleasant color. You can make one or buy one. In
time, as your child learns to read, you can dis-
card the line marker.

 Voiceless th sound: The voiceless th sound originates in the tongue and
teeth, as in the words thud and think. If your child is typical and has lazy
throat muscles and lazy lips, he may need to practice the voiced th until
he feels a very slight vibration. Children accustomed to speaking English
say these sounds by ear and seldom have difficulty. However, people
who are new to speaking English may have trouble making the voiceless
th sound.
Reinforcing consonant digraph sounds
Are you ready for a round of skill-boosting activities? Your first encounter is
with word strips. If you need to learn what they are and how to organize
them, you can refer to Chapter 2. Is your child up to unscrambling words,
marking with the breve, and filling in the blanks? Make way for the tongue
twister and poetry readings. Skills are seriously sharpened with these rein-
forcement tools.
Activity: Markings with the Breve
Preparation: You need paper, pencil, and the following word list. You may
copy these words or rewrite the exercise for your child.
To play: Have your child place the breve (˘) over the short vowels in the fol-
lowing words. Write the marked vowel on the line next to the word.
Example: th®s ®
1. chill _______________
2. rich _______________
3. with _______________
4. thin _______________
5. song _______________
Answer Key: 1. ch®ll ® 2. r®ch ® 3. w®th ® 4. th®n \ 5. s©ng ©
Activity: Tongue Twisters Poems, and Ditties

Chapter 5: Joining Consonants Together to Make More Sounds

To play: Following are some ditties to help your child master the consonant
sounds he has just learned. Ask your child to read these and point out the
consonant digraphs.
Blue
One blue shoe
One blue hat.
I like blue,
But not on a cat.
Answer Key: blue
When you ask your child to read the previous poem, please note that the
word blue is a common word in books for beginning readers. He needs to
know it as a sight word at this juncture.
Sing Sing
Sing, Sing, what shall I sing?
Cat’s run away with the pudding-string!
Do, do, what shall I do?
The cat has bitten it quite in two.
Answer Key: shall
Blending Endings
An end blend is a blend of two consonants at the end of a word. Last, band,
and task are examples of end blends. In an end blend, the basic sounds of the
consonants involved don’t change. Even though the consonants are placed
together, the sound made by each consonant can be distinctly heard. For
example, in the word last, you can hear both the s and the t sounds. Your
child merely blends the familiar consonant sounds as one, and slides them
together with the vowel. Reading end blends seems easy, but it still requires
practice.
84
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

Understanding the difference between 
end blends and digraphs
As I explain earlier in this chapter (see “Delving into Digraphs”), two conso-
nants joined together to make one sound is called a digraph. Examples of
digraphs include ch, sh, th, and wh. A consonant digraph makes a completely
new sound from two consonants. An end blend, by contrast, doesn’t create a
single new sound because the letters maintain their individual sounds.
A word alert is in order here: The end blends fact, bulk, and jinx are difficult
words for many children to pronounce. Pay close attention to how your child
pronounces his words, especially if he has articulation weaknesses. Those
weaknesses need to be corrected.
Lots of words are often difficult to pronounce. Take, for example, the word
ask. Some kids will say ax rather than ask. It’s also common to hear people
say sall or sor for saw.
Discovering end blends
So many words, so little time! Do you know how many short-vowel consonant-
blend words there are? Hundreds and hundreds! And your child will be able
to spell and read all of them after completing these blending lessons.
To start, have your child practice the consonant blends by reading the words
from the following list:

For practice, have your child read these sentences silently first and then say
them out loud:
Will a man send him a desk and a lamp?
Don left and kept his red belt.
Bess sent him a gift at camp.
Practicing what you’ve learned is always a good idea. The more you apply
your newly found knowledge, the more adept you become. Making bookmark-
style word strips pays off when your child reads columns of rhyming words
fluently.
Activity: Finding the End Blend
Preparation: You need paper, pencil, and the following exercise. You may
copy these sentences or rewrite the exercise for your child.
To play: Read each of the following sentences. Choose the two end blends in
the sentence, and write the words on the lines.
Example: Brant began to look for his mask. Brant and mask
1. Jim went to check on his plot of land. _______________ 
and _______________
2. The lad did his best on his task. _______________ and _______________

3. Kent was at the helm when the ship sunk. _______________ 
and _______________
4. I can’t see past the bus. _______________ and _______________
5. An ant is such a pest at a picnic. _______________ and _______________
Answer Key: 1. went, land 2. best, task 3. Kent, helm 4. can’t, past 5. ant, pest
Activity: Word Strips: End Blends
Preparation: Write the following words on strips of precut cardstock paper
(they may be used for bookmarks). Each set of words in this activity gets its
own strip. Remember that you can cut your word strips to any length you
want. Chapter 2 explains how to teach with and create word strips.
To play: Sit next to your child and read the following word strips. Some of the
word strips may contain words that haven’t been introduced yet. That’s okay
because word strips are rhyming adventures.
dust, crust, bust, just, lust, must, rust, gust
bent, dent, vent, lent, Kent, tent, sent, went, rent
band, sand, hand, land
Beginning Blendings
After a child catches on to the end blends, he can look to the beginning of
words for initial blends. Most children find initial blends more difficult than
end blends. The r blends are particularly hard because you have to sound
them smoothly as well as rapidly.
Here are a couple of techniques for introducing initial blends:
 Write dra, dre, dri, dro, and dru in a column on a whiteboard or piece of
paper. Using the short-vowel sounds, connect the sounds you wrote to
different letters and have your child follow along as you pronounce the
new sounds. For example, write the letters fra and have your child pro-
nounce these words as you alter the final letter: fre, fri, fro, and fru.
 Go from the known to the unknown. Write ra, and under it, dra. Write re,
and under it, dre. Write ri, and under it, dri. Write ro, and under it, dro.
And finally, write ru, and under it, dru. You pronounce the top combina-
tion and then the lower one as your child repeats what you say.
87
Chapter 5: Joining Consonants Together to Make More Sounds

 Use flashcards. Displaying the flashcards as rapidly as your child can
read the “words” makes for a great workout. Make a list of as many com-
binations as you can think of and put them on flashcards. Each card gets
an individual blend. For example, some good blends are scra, scri, scro,
scru; spla, splu, spli, splo, sple; and stra, stri, stro, stru, stre. These blends
are really challenging. Be careful not to make blends of nonexistent 
combinations.
Uncovering beginning blends
Have your child practice beginning blends by reading the words in the follow-
ing list. Make sure that he blends the consonant sounds smoothly:
88

pram
press
prick
prig
prim
prod
prop
scrap
scrub
scruff
sprig
stress
strip
struck
strut
track
trap
trim
trod
truck
Have your child read these sentences for practice:
Will mom trim and press a dress?
A truck struck a fat frog.
Will Rick grab it from its nest?
Most initial blends contain the letter r, l, or s, as in pra, fla, and sma. Coach
your child to say the blend and the vowel so smoothly that there’s no break
between the letters. For example, correct your child if he says buh-rim or buh-
red rather than brim or bred. After your child develops the correct technique,
he’ll slide the sounds together without any difficulty.

Mastering initial blends
Practicing the initial blends is a good idea because they’re harder to
read than the others. Finding them within several words enhances the 
development of composition skills. Word strips are excellent for rhyming
and reading.
Activity: Finding Initial Blends
Preparation: You need paper, pencil, and this exercise. You may copy these
sentences or rewrite the exercise for your child.
To play: Read the following sentences. Choose the correct initial blend word
from the three words on the right. Circle the word and then print it in the
line.
1. The _______________ sat on a pad in the pond. (fend, frog, log)
2. The little lass took a nap in the _______________. (cat, lull, crib)
3. Pam had a rip in her blue _______________. (dress, dog, red)
4. Do not _______________ the pop, Jack. (spin, spill, fix)
5. Pat had a big _______________ on his leg. (bump, gap, bond)
Answer Key: 1. frog 2. crib 3. dress 4. spill 5. bump
Activity: Word Strips: Initial Blends
Preparation: Turn the following lists into word strips. Chapter 2 explains
how to teach with and create word strips.
To play: Sit next to your child and read the following word strips:
drip, grip, jip, quip, lip, slip, trip, whip, snip, flip, blip, nip, pip, rip, tip,
yip, zip, dip
bog, fog, cog, dog, frog, grog, hog, jog, log, smog
scrap, trap, strap, flap, gap, yap, lap, slap, clap, wrap, pap
Using word strips puts rhyming words into action by injecting word families
into the context of exercises in spelling and reading. If a child has a weak-
ness in sliding sounds together to make words, it’s a wonderful means for
improvement.

Chapter 5: Joining Consonants Together to Make More Sounds

Activity: A Bag of Bran
To play: Read this story to practice beginning blends. See whether your child
can pick out all the words that have beginning blends.
Fred and Sam went to the bin to get some bran. The bag of bran had grit
on it. Sam was mad as it was for Mom and Dad. Fred was grim and had to
slap the grub and grit from the bag. Sam got a scrub rag and got the dust
off. The task did end and the lads felt well.
Answer Key: Fred, bran, grit, grim, slap, grub, from, scrub
Activity: Word Strips: All sorts of consonant blends
Preparation: Turn the following lists into word strips (Chapter 2 explains
how to teach with and create word strips).
To play: Sit next to your child and read the following word strips:

Examining Some Blending Quirks
As always, the English language has some quirks. I examine two in this 
section that warrant some special attention.
90
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

I first introduce the ck in Chapter 4, with the keyword clock. Its quirkiness
consists of the fact that the k sound has three different spellings — k, c, and
ck. The tch is another real curve ball, and you read all about it in this section.
Checking on the ck
The consonant digraph ck shows up at the end of most short-vowel words
ending in the k sound. Amid all this talk about consonant digraphs, I’ll let you
in on a little secret: Your child learned the ck digraph when he learned the
sound of hard c. I didn’t call the hard c a digraph at the time, but ck fits the
bill for a digraph; it comprises two letters that have one sound.
Decoding ck words is a cinch, but use the following list for practice anyway.
By now you will have determined how strong or weak your child’s decoding
ability is. The list presents a way to sharpen your child’s ears for hearing the
sounds in a word and writing those sounds on paper. After short vowels,
make sure that your child writes ck for the sound of k.

Activity: Filling in the Blanks
Preparation: You need paper, pencil, and the following activity. You may copy
these sentences or rewrite the exercise for your child.
To play: Read the following sentences. Choose words from the word bank to
correctly complete the sentences.
Word bank: back, clock, deck, rock, stack, truck

5. The yellow _______________ has a bed in the _______________.
Answer Key: 1. stack 2. deck 3. clock 4. rock 5. truck, back
Activity: Poems and Stories to Reinforce the ck Sound
To play: As you read the following, ask your child to shout when he hears 
a ck (k) sound at the end of a word. Be sure to let him try reading these
items, too!
Jack Be Nimble
Jack be nimble
Jack be quick
Jack jump over
The candlestick.
Answer Key: Jack, quick, candlestick
The Ant and the Frog
Once an ant fell into a pond.
“Help me! I am lost in the pond,” she said.
Next to the bank of the pond was a big branch that hung into the pond.
There was a frog on this branch and he wanted to help the ant.
92
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

“Hang in there,” he said. “I will send one of my pads that I sit on. Get on it
and it will help you.”
The black ant sat on the pad and she did land on the bank of the pond.
She said, “Thank you for this, my chum!”
After that the frog was by the pond. He wanted to be in the sun.
There was a man that wanted to nab the frog with his yellow net and get
him in a sack. But the ant was on a stick next to the pond and ran fast to
help the frog.
The ant bit the man in the leg, and he did yell, “You got me! You bit me!”
Then the frog took one look at the man and said, “Oh my! I must scram!”
He left fast and was glad that the man did not nab him.
The frog went back to thank the black ant for her help. She said, “This is
what a pal is for.”
Answer Key: black, sack, stick, back
To enhance the previous lesson, you can ask your child the following ques-
tions to find out how well he comprehended the story, “The Ant and the
Frog.” Comprehension always involves asking who, what, when, where, why,
and how.
1. Who are the three characters in the story?
2. Where does this story take place?
3. What time of day do you think it was?
4. What does a pond look like?
5. What color did you picture the pad?
6. How did the pad get from the frog to the ant?
7. Why did the ant need the pad?
8. Why did the frog want to bask in the sun?
9. Danger appeared in the form of . . . ?
10. Was there anyone to help the frog?
11. What did the black ant do?
12. A lesson from the story is . . . ?
Now is a good time to make flashcards of the following sight words: 
me, be, by, and after.
93
Chapter 5: Joining Consonants Together to Make More Sounds

Introducing tch
Another quirky tidbit in the exploration of blends and digraphs is this:
Immediately after short vowels, the ch digraph is spelled tch. Examples of
words following the tch pattern include batch, stretch, and hatch. The sound is
really a trigraph, not a digraph, because tch is three letters, not two. But
who’s counting?
Some words in the English language don’t follow the tch pattern. Those words
include much, such, rich, and which. In these words, the ch digraph follows a
short vowel, but the digraph is spelled ch, not tch.
Read the words in the following list to practice words ending in tch:

Activity: A Sad Lad
Preparation: You need paper and pencil.
To play: Read the following story and then copy or rewrite it onto another
piece of paper. Circle the words that contain a consonant digraph. Rewrite
those words below the story.
My pal, Scott, was the lad with the brown crutch. Did you see him at the
back of the class with some kids? He fell in a ditch last month and the
front of his leg has a twist to it. The Doc got a look, set it, and Scott is still
in shock. My mom said that if he has a good stretch he will get well fast.
Scott said to her that he wants to pitch his crutch and not be sick. He will
be sad until he can.

Answer Key: with, crutch, back, ditch, month, shock, stretch, pitch, crutch,
sick
Activity: Tongue Twister
To play: Read the following to your child and ask him to pick out the tch and
ch end sounds. Let him try to say the tongue twister, too.
Which watch did which witch wear and which witch wore which watch?
Answer Key: which, watch, witch
Dealing With Vowels at 
the Start of Words
Chapter 4 introduces the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern. When a word
or syllable has only one vowel, and that vowel comes at the beginning of the
word, the vowel is usually short. It’s the vowel-consonant pattern. Examples
of this guidelines include the words add, egg, and ill.
To boil down these two patterns as they apply to short-vowel words or 
syllables:
 The short sound of a, e, i, o, and u shows itself by coming between two
consonants in a syllable or a word.
 The short sound of a, e, i, o, and u shows itself by coming at the begin-
ning of a word.
Use the following list to practice making the sounds that vowels make when
they appear at the beginning of words:

Have your child read the following sentences silently first and then say them
out loud for practice:
If Al is ill, Mom will help.
Ed undid the thick string.
It is odd at the end.
Word associations trigger the memory and their usage comes in handy quite
often. Picturing an elf is a cute little gimmick for remembering a short-vowel
guideline, for example.
A word search is a clever tracking device. Tell your child that he’s a word
detective and he’s going after short-vowel words that are hiding.
Activity: A Story to Reinforce the Vowel-Consonant Pattern
To play: Ask your child to read the following story and find the words with
the vowel-consonant pattern.
Ann and Ed went into the shop to see Dad. He asked them to add up the
cans of ham.
He said, “In my shop you can look at the odds and ends of cans and tell
me if the ham in the cans is still fresh.”
The two of them will see if Dad’s stock is still fresh. They can do it as they
can add. Ed can look on the end of the can to see it. He will tell Ann and
she will get a pen and print it on the pad.
Ed said to Dad, “The cans are still fresh to sell, Dad.”
He said, “Thanks, kids, you are a help to me.”
It is fun to go to Dad’s shop.
Answer Key: Ann, Ed, into, asked, add, up, in, at, odds, and, ends, of, if, is, if,

Chapter 6
Pursuing Plurals and 
Compound Words
In This Chapter
 Examining how words are made into plurals
 Using s and es to make words plural
 Understanding multisyllable words
 Exploring compound words
I
n this chapter, you and your child embark on a very important adventure —
how to make one into many. This chapter covers plurals, and it shows how
you can form plural words by adding an s or es to short-vowel words. Because
adding es to a short-vowel word adds an additional syllable to a word, this
chapter also lightly touches on multisyllable words and the challenges that
children face when they read these longer words. Finally, this chapter exam-
ines a special kind of multisyllable word, the compound word.
Exploring Plurals in Speech and Spelling
The word plural means more than one. Plurals can range anywhere from two
cats to one million pennies. Of course, you already understand that plurals
can be a low number or a very high number, but you may need to explain this
idea to young children. By the time a child reaches age 5 or 6, she knows
what “more than one” means, and that adding an s or z sound to a word is
one way to make it plural.
How you pronounce the plural of a word depends on whether the word ends
in a voiced or voiceless consonant.

 Voiced consonants: The vocal cords vibrate when you sound out a con-
sonant at the end of the word, like rag, dog, ham, and can. You can deter-
mine this by placing your fingers on your throat as you speak the voiced
sound. When you make these words plural, the s sounds like a z. For
example, rags, dogs, hams, and cans.
 Voiceless consonants: The vocal cords are relaxed (they don’t vibrate)
when you sound out a consonant at the end of the word, like bat, top,
kick, and staff. The sound is made by the tongue and lips, and when you
make these words plural, the s sounds like an s. For example, bats, tops,
kicks, and staffs. Examples of voiceless consonants are t, p, k, and f.
You can figure out whether a consonant is voiced or not by making a word
plural with an s and listening to the sound that it makes. If you want to, you
can place your fingers on your throat to feel the absence or presence of a
vibration that indicates the sound.
Have your child practice saying the singular and plural words in the preced-
ing bullets out loud, listening for the voiced and voiceless consonants and
the difference in the s and z sounds.
After your child hears and understands the different sounds — s or z — that
indicate a plural, you can introduce her to the mechanics of spelling plurals.
You want your child to understand that the presence of the s or z sound indi-
cates a plural noun, of course, but for spelling purposes, you also want her to
know that she has to add s or es to a word to make it plural.
Pronouncing the z sound when necessary comes naturally, but you need to
make sure your child doesn’t spell plural words and singular, present-tense
verbs with a z. For example, some kids tend to replace the s with a z in plu-
rals when they’re spelling. For example, for a word such as dogs, they may
write dogz because that’s how it sounds. Your focus as a parent must stay on
the sounding factor as it relates to spelling and reading. Point out that some
plurals make the z sound when you speak them aloud, but that the z is never
used when spelling plurals.
98
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 
The singular s in action words
Besides adding an s to a noun to form a plural,
you also add an s to form a present-tense, third-
person singular verb. For example, in the sen-
tence “He wins,” the s is added to the word win.
Here’s some excellent news for placing the s at
the end of present-tense, third-person singular
verbs: Verbs follow the same phonics guidelines
as their noun buddies. For example, in forming
the simple present-tense, third-person form of
the verb jump, you have to add only an s. For the
purpose of keeping it simple for a beginning
reader, you can point out this guideline to 
your child: Add an s to form plurals and some
present-tense verbs.

The Letter s Counts for a Lot
The letter s is one of the top four commonly used letters of the alphabet.
That’s why your first decoding lesson includes the letter s. It’s such an easy
sound when you first learn it. The other part of s that you have to learn is
that it has another sound — the z sound.
Making plurals with s and z when you’re talking is inherent in the English lan-
guage. No dialectical nuances here! You always think about s as an s sound
when you write it, because you said s when you first learned to talk. This is
the chapter where you draw the distinction between the s and z sound of the
letter s. It comes early in the game of phonics, but you get just a taste and
deal with some short-vowel nouns and verbs that you’re going to turn into
plurals or present tense verbs. Chapter 17 refers to the z sound as well.
In the following list, every word has an s on the end. This list contains a mix-
ture of nouns and verbs that follow the voiced and voiceless guideline (see
the “Exploring Plurals in Speech and Spelling” section). Read the words in the
list and tell your child that, although some words sound like they end in z,
most words end in s when she starts spelling them:

Your child may need a hands-on demonstration in s and z before plunging
into the previous list. If so, walk around the house with a pencil and paper
and point to different objects, saying, for example: “five cans,” “three pencils,”
“two brooms,” “four rugs,” and so on. Write down the plurals, and show your
child how you added an s to each noun. Ask your child which plurals end
with the s sound and which end with the z sound.
After your child masters the words in the previous list, have her read the fol-
lowing sentences for practice. The goal is for her to be able to read the way
she speaks, so you want her to read each sentence to herself and then say it
out loud with expression, naturally speaking the words in the sentence.
Glenn crams scraps in his sacks.
Will dogs gulp at bugs?
Meg strips the tents of gifts.
No word should ever be read in a sentence unless your child has learned it
before. (That doesn’t refer to any tandem reading or pleasure reading that
you do with your child.) Even though this is a phonics lesson, some sight
words are added to get the child reading. These sight words definitely need
to be learned before meeting them in a sentence. Speaking from a phonics
viewpoint, the words your child meets in sentences are composed primarily
with words that your child can decode. Refer to Chapter 3 for more informa-
tion. Reading smoothly and correctly is the goal.
Activity: Plural Poem
Preparation: Make a copy of the following poem or write it on a piece of
paper. Your child also needs a pencil.
Sight words: come, they, their, little
To play: Help your child read the poem. Then have her circle the plural
words.
One green frog swims in the pond;
Two little frogs grab a pad to get on.
In the nest sit three little chicks;
Chicks and big dogs do not mix.
Four little lads look and then;
See five eggs with a big fat hen.

Activity: Making a Plural Word Strip
Preparation: You need a strip of paper at least 6 inches long and 3 inches
wide, a pencil, a list of words, and a sheet of paper.
To play:
1. Using the 6-x-3-inch strip of paper, create a word strip with one of the
following lists of words.
Chapter 2 explains how to create and teach with word strips.
2. Sit next to your child and listen to her read the word strip to you.
101
Chapter 6: Pursuing Plurals and Compound Words

3. After she’s comfortable reading the words, ask her to spell them out
loud.
4. Finally, ask her to write each word on a sheet of paper.
Word strips:
sits, hits, pits, flits, bits, grits, mitts, spits, fits, skits, slits, quits, sprits,
scripts, wits
rags, drags, snags, gags, hags, lags, brags, flags, nags, stags, tags, wags,
swags
Activity: Making Plural Words
Preparation: Copy or rewrite the following list of words. Your child also
needs a pencil.
To play: Have your child read the word aloud and print the s ending on the
line. Then ask her whether the word ends in the s sound or the z sound.
let__
nut__
fib__
top__
tan__
hen__
tat__
bum__
rat__
bet__
Answer Key: Ends in the s sound: lets, nuts, tops, tats, rats, bets; Ends in the
z sound: fibs, tans, hens, bums
Adding es Is an Easy Thing to Do
When you add es to make a word plural, you add another syllable to the
word. For example, inch is a one-syllable word, but the word is two syllables
102
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

long when it’s plural: inches. Similarly, when the letters es are added to a 
present-tense verb such as catch, the verb gets another syllable: catches.
Luckily, adding es to a noun or verb follows the same phonetic guideline:
Words (nouns and verbs) ending in s, x, z, ch, and sh form the plural or singu-
lar third-person present tense by adding es rather than s. When the es is
added, these words acquire another syllable.
Looking at plural words can be tricky when the singular word ends in e, and
you add an s to make it plural (home and homes, for example). Kids can be
confused by this (thinking es has been added) when they start reading. This
is addressed in Chapter 7, where I talk about the silent e.
In the following list, every word has an es on the end. This list contains a mix-
ture of nouns and verbs. Have your child read the table for practice. Tell your
child to notice that each of these words is two syllables long — the extra syl-
lable was added with the letters es:

Remind your child that words that end in s, x, z, ch, and sh use es on the end
to make them plural. Ask her to point out these letters in the previous list.
After your child has mastered the words in the previous list, have her
read the following sentences for practice. Ask her to read them silently to
herself first, and then read them out loud with expression to you, naturally
speaking the words in the sentence. The goal is for her to be able to read as
she speaks.

Fred tosses and smashes six eggs.
Pat clutches and munches a crab.
Jim splashes and drenches his lamps.
Activity: Little Tommy Tittle Mouse
To play: Read the poem together and ask your child to pick out the es words.
You can also show her what happens with mouse and house if you make these
words plural.

Activity: Joke
To play: Read the joke and discuss it with your child. Ask comprehension
questions (who, what, where, when, why, how) and ask her to predict a possi-
ble outcome. Then have her find the plural words formed by adding es.
The children line up for lunch at Sunday school. On the table is a basket
of apples. The pastor had made a note and put it in with the apples: 
“Take only one. God watches you.”
At the other end of the table were big bunches of chocolate chip cookies
on dishes. A child had written a note, “Take all you want. God is watching
the apples.”
Answer Key: watches, bunches, dishes
Decoding Multisyllable Words
The word syllable sounds kind of academic. Most adults know what a syllable
is but find it difficult to explain syllables to children. Tell your child that sylla-
bles are the building blocks of words. Just as different blocks make a building
when they are stacked together, different syllables make a word when they
are put together. If you want to get more precise, here are two ways to
describe a syllable:
105
Chapter 6: Pursuing Plurals and Compound Words

 A syllable is a word or part of a word pronounced with a single, uninter-
rupted sounding of the voice. For example, the word fantastic has three
syllables: fan-tas-tic.
 A syllable is a word or part of a word with one vowel sound. For exam-
ple, the word dig has one vowel sound, the i, so it’s a one-syllable word.
I can’t emphasize enough how earthshakingly important it is for your child to
understand what syllables are when it comes to decoding words. Being able
to understand syllables separates the top-notch readers and spellers from
the so-so readers and spellers. Following are some activities to help your
child decode multisyllable words.
Compiling Compound Words
I want to introduce you to some short-vowel compound words. It’s appropri-
ate to place them at this juncture, because it enables your child to take a
peek into a phonics lesson that seems hard, but in reality is quite simple.
Because syllables have had their merest introduction in this chapter, it’s easy
for her to see the two short-vowel words become one new word. The formal
definition is: A compound word is made when two words are joined to form a
new word.
For beginners, compound words can be problematic. When a child meets her
first compound word, she realizes right away that it’s longer. You can explain
to your child that two short words can become one long word so that she
better understands what compound words are.
Most first-grade students can learn simple, two-syllable compound words in
the first semester of reading. Their self-confidence gets a huge boost when
they can decode these “big” words. And kids love to tell everyone that they
know about compound words!
How did compound words such as cannot, hilltop, and cobweb originate? The
words began as single words said together, and over time, they were hyphen-
ated to form compound words. As these words came into common use, the
hyphen was dropped, and they became compound words. For example, the
two individual words zig and zag became the hyphenated zig-zag, and then
finally the single word zigzag.
Compound words are always being added to the English language. For exam-
ple, recent years have seen the addition of online, download, and upload.
106
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

Practicing with compound words
The following is a kid-friendly list of compound words. Notice all the short
vowels. Some of these words may be a little old fashioned, but no matter. The
idea is to get kids used to reading compound words.

you want her to read each sentence to herself and then say it out loud with
expression.
His desktop pad had a zigzag blotch on it.
Fred has the pigskin for the kickoff.
Will Nan padlock the dog within a box?
Introducing short-vowel compound words is the first incursion into two-
syllable single words. Some words are so compounded that it can blow you
away. An example is antidisestablishmentarianism. After you decode the
longest word in the English language word, write it in your notebook and 
quiz your friends with your newfound trivia.
Activity: The Donkey and the Grasshopper
Preparation: Make flashcards of the sight words and drill with them lightly
before your child reads the story. Have a tablet and pencil handy.
Sight words: could, some, beautiful, always, good

To play: Ask your child to read the story. After she’s finished, help her pick
out the compound words. Dictate the compound words to your child as she
spells them on a printing tablet. (You may need to break down the grasshop-
per word for her.) Because this is an adapted fable, the parent may want to
explain and discuss the moral of the story.
At sunset, the donkey could hear some grasshoppers chirp. He said,
“I want to make beautiful music like that.” He asked the grasshoppers
what kind of food they eat to give them their beautiful voices.
“We live only on the dew that falls on the grasslands,” the grasshoppers
said.
“I have always munched on hay,” the donkey said, “but I will go uphill and
try the dew.”
By the next sunset, the donkey said, “I must be a nitwit! My voice is noth-
ing next to the grasshoppers’. No matter how much dew I take, I am still
not good. What helps them to sing does not a thing for me. I will go back
to munch some bunches of hay.”
Answer Key: sunset, grasshoppers, grasslands, uphill, nitwit
Looking at advanced compound words
The compound words in the following list are especially challenging. None
are from previous lessons, and some may be out of your child’s vocabulary
range. But see whether she can read them, and be helpful when she gets
stuck. If your child succeeds in decoding these words, she deserves a reward!

Making Long-Vowel Sounds
In This Chapter
 Looking at making short vowels long
 Discovering the magic silent e
 Ending a one-syllable word with w or y
 Presenting a vowel at the end of a word
L
ong vowels play a major role in the words in the English language. This
chapter discusses long and short vowels and shows you words that
change from a short-vowel sound to a long-vowel sound with the simple addi-
tion of an e. Also, you see that when a word or syllable has more than one
vowel, some vowels remain silent. And further, while a, e, i, o, and u are
vowels, you discover that y and w can behave as vowels.
As always, this chapter has practical activities to help further develop your
child’s smooth reading and precise spelling skills.
Understanding the Long, 
the Short, and the Silent
In this chapter, I tell you about long-vowel sounds, which are the easiest to
teach by far, because the vowel letter (a, e, i, o, or u) says its name. In note,
for example, you can literally hear the letter o. In the word mate, you can
hear the sound of a long a. And again in the word site, you can hear the letter
say its name. This pattern repeats itself over and over again in the English
language.
Now, stop a minute and think about the three words I just gave to show exam-
ples of long vowels: note, mate, and site. Imagine those words with no e at the
end. Hey! It’s like that e is magic or something! Add that silent e to the end of
not, mat, and sit, and that one little letter changes both the sound and the
meaning of the words. How cool is that?

112
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 
Presenting the amazing magic e
You may not know it, but you’ve already seen plenty of “magic” e words in
this book. It’s also referred to as the silent e, and some even refer to it as 
Mrs. E (for reasons I don’t understand). I like to call it the magic e because,
well, it works like magic! Place the magic e at the end of a short-vowel word,
and abracadabra, you get a long-vowel word.
For example, by placing the magic e at the end of spit, you turn that word 
into spite. And that’s pretty powerful magic, too, because that one little letter
completely changes both the sound and meaning of the word it’s attached to.
When a word or syllable has only one vowel, in most instances you can
expect it to be a short sound; but if the word or syllable has two vowels, you
can usually count on the first vowel being long and the second one being
silent. And that makes the magic e the strong, silent type!
As always with the English language, this guideline has exceptions. For 
example, the words have, love, and give all end with a silent e, but the first
vowels are short.
Discovering the magic e at work
Now you get to see the magic e do its thing. In the following list, more words
are transformed in meaning and short vowels change to long vowels. Notice
the patterns in the words. Isn’t it amazing that adding an e can change so
much? Your vowel goes from short to long and the meaning changes.
Study the words in the following list with your child and see for yourselves
how the addition of the e changes the meaning and sound of the words. Have
your child practice by reading the words from the table.
bath, bathe
cloth, clothe
cub, cube
cut, cute
grim, grime
grip, gripe
mop, mope
quit, quite
scrap, scrape
sham, shame
shin, shine
sit, site
snip, snipe
thin, thine
tub, tube
twin, twine
us, use
whit, white

Have your child read these sentences silently first and then read them out
loud. Point out the pattern of the short-vowel word (cvc, ccvc) and the long-
vowel word (cvcv, vcv, ccvcv):
The twin will use the white twine for the gift.
Jane wants to shine her bike with the cloth.
Steve has a grim plan to bathe his dog.
Ask your child to recite the words in the following list. Make sure he sees and
hears the cvcv (consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel) pattern as well. Focus on
making sure that your child understands that the first vowel is long and the
second vowel silent so that he can apply this guideline later:

Using the macron to mark long vowels
Lexicographers (word experts who write dictionaries) use diacritical marks
(sometimes called accent marks) to distinguish between the long and short
sounds that vowels make. These marks are called the macron and the breve:
 A macron (¯) is a straight line. When it appears over a vowel, the vowel
makes a long sound.
 A breve (˘) is a segment of circle. When it appears over a vowel, the
vowel makes a short sound.
114
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

Some people sometimes call these accent marks the bar and the rocker. Many
newer dictionaries don’t use the breve to spell words phonetically on the
idea that any vowel without a mark over it always makes the short sound. In
all dictionaries, long vowels are marked with macrons.
After your child understands what the breve and macron are, he can mark
vowels appropriately as short or long. When he’s marking the second vowel
in a long vowel word, he can cross out the second vowel to indicate that it’s
silent (for example, h∂pe). Doing this is a good foundation for his later dictio-
nary work. He can pretend that he’s a secret agent using a secret code to
mark the vowels.
The breve is the mark for the short vowel (˘). The macron is the mark for the
long vowel (¯). (Refer to the pronunciation key in Chapter 10.) The patterns
for the vowels are generally cvc, vc, or cvcv.
Activity: Marking Vowels
Preparation: You need paper and pencil. Make a copy of the following exer-
cise or rewrite it on a piece of paper.
To play: Place a breve or macron over the vowels in each word and cross out
any silent vowels. Rewrite the word on the line next to it.

Answer Key: dine, pine, fine, tried, plates
Looking at Vowel Digraphs
A vowel digraph contains two vowels that make one sound. For example, the
ai in sail and the oa in loaf are vowel digraphs. Some people call them vowel
pairs. In these vowel digraphs, the first vowel is long and the second vowel is
silent. To help your child remember how to pronounce vowel digraphs, he
can remember this: When two vowels go a-walking, the first vowel does the
talking, and the second vowel is quiet.
With vowels, as with consonants, “di” means two and “graph” means letter.
Notice that in the following word list, the two vowels are always next to each
other. You end up with a vvc, cvvc, or a cvv situation as in aim, bail, or bee.
You don’t have the vcv of ate, like you do in the first word list in this chapter.
Use the following word list to explore vowel digraphs with your child. See
whether he can discover the “walking, talking” guideline for himself. Simply
correct him in the way he sounds the words, and wait for him to pick up the
guideline on his own:

Come again another day;
Little Johnny wants to play
Rain, rain, go away.
Answer Key: rain, Spain, again, away, day, play
Taking On More Challenging 
Vowel Digraphs
Using some of the vowel digraphs for auditory (ear) training can be confusing
because words containing vowel digraphs can sound the same but be spelled
differently. For example, meat and meet are spelled differently but sound the
same. Two words that sound the same but have different meanings are called
homonyms (see the second word list in this section for several examples).
Your child may need to memorize these vowel digraphs in order to spell
them correctly.
In r-controlled words such as care, exaggerate the long sounds of the vowels
when saying them for the first time. When your child repeats the words
rapidly, the long a in care sounds very close to the short sound of e. What
part of the country you live in influences the way you say certain words.
Ask your child to read the words in the following list, and ask him to apply
the correct sounds to the vowels whether they’re short or long. He should
have no trouble at all.

The next word list is for reading practice only. Don’t use it for a spelling
lesson. Being able to decode these words gives your child a sense of accom-
plishment and introduces him to the strange world of homonyms (words that
are spelled differently but pronounced the same):

Turning w and y into Vowels
Most people learn in school that the vowels are a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y
and w. Well, that’s not exactly accurate. To be more precise, the consonant y
can sometimes behave as a vowel. And, believe it or not, so can the conso-
nant w! But don’t try to use either of these consonants as vowels on Wheel of
Fortune! Their game show rules aren’t as flexible as language guidelines.
In words such as low and way, the w and y appear as silent vowels. The
strength of y and w lies in their silence. By their presence and their silence,
the first vowel becomes long.

To introduce you and your child to the w and y vowel, see the following word
list. Have your child read the words in the list, and then show him how the
presence of these letters creates a long vowel sound:

Have your child read these sentences for practice:
She set the tray on the low bench.
Mom, can I play with Steve?
Row the old boat with your oars.
Ending Words with Long Vowels
What happens when long vowels appear at the end of words? Here’s a little
gem for you to contemplate: When a word or syllable has only one vowel and
that vowel comes at the end, the vowel is usually long.
Have your child read the words with vowels at the end in the next word list.
Tell your child that the y at the end of these words is used as a vowel and rep-
resents the long sound of i, as in my. These words are fairly easy for kids to
read, but harder for them to spell.
Oh, I almost forgot: Exception alert! For the sake of simplicity, the y-ending
words in the following word list all make the long i sound at the end (not to
be confused with the Long Island Sound which is an estuary — where fresh
and saltwater mix — near Hoboken). You may want to mention to your child
that not all y-ending words end with the long i sound. Rascally exceptions
include the word lazy, where the y at the end sounds like a long e.

He got in the dry, brown hole.
Why does the dog like the bones?
The fire is low in the sky.
Why does he have tears on his cheeks?

Presenting Diverse Vowel Sounds
of a, o, and u
In This Chapter
 Getting acquainted with ä
 Discovering more sounds of o
 Taking a closer look at u
O
f the many sounds you explore in phonics, this chapter presents the
most diverse sounds. This chapter sounds a bit like a rain forest with
all the animals chirping or crowing or growling. Here I present the third sound
of the letters a, o, and u.
Third sounds can be spelled in many different ways. Words that contain third
sounds are often taught collectively as “nonphonetic.” This chapter helps
your child recognize when the third sounds of the letters a, o, or u appear in
words and how to pronounce them correctly.
Part of the fun of this chapter is recognizing sounds that are spelled oddly.
Words like shoe and zoom and bush and crook have the same vowel sound,
although you wouldn’t know it from looking at them. Being able to recognize
and pronounce these third vowel sounds will definitely raise your child’s
level of reading proficiency. Refer to the vowel chart in Chapter 2.
Saying ä before u, w, r, ll, and lt
When the letter a is followed by u, w, r, ll, or lt in the same syllable, it usually
has the third sound of a, or ä. This ä sound is heard in the words haul, raw,
car, call, salt, and squall. The third a makes the aw sound. The sound with its
particular consonants and vowel can be daunting, but when your child
sounds out the words, he hears the aw sound, and after you teach your child
the sound, you can apply it to the various groupings of words that have it.

124
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 
Some phonics experts agree that whenever you use the r with a vowel, the r
sound has a great influence over the vowel preceding it. Most experts say
that the American r is a very bossy letter! When it follows a vowel you really
can hear the r sound. However, people in Boston say, “Pahk the cah,” people
in Detroit say, “Parrk the carr,” and still other people say “Park the car.”
Accents and regional dialect dictate the sounds of many words. The standard
presented in this book uses the sound of är similar to saying the letter r.
The vowel guidelines, mentioned throughout this book, cover roughly 75 per-
cent of all vowel sounds. Appendix A outlines some basic guidelines, but to
spare you a trip to that appendix, here’s an overview of the guidelines:
 When a word or syllable has only one vowel, and the vowel comes
between two consonants, the vowel is usually short.
 When a word or syllable has only one vowel, and that vowel comes at
the beginning of the word, the vowel is usually short.
 When a word or syllable has only one vowel, and that vowel comes at
the end of the word, the vowel is usually long.
 When the letter a is followed by u, w, r, ll, or lt in the same syllable, it
usually has the third sound of a, or ä.
Teaching ä: The /aw/ sound
In order to teach the third sound of a, or ä, you have to distinguish between
it and the two other sounds for the letter a:
 The first sound of a is the short \, as heard in the word apple.
 The second sound of a is the long ≈, as heard in the word ate.
 The third sound of a makes the ä sound, as heard in the word father.
This sentence includes all three letter a sounds: His fäther ≈te the \pples.
(For more information about short a vowel sounds, see Chapter 4; for more
about long a vowel sounds, see Chapter 7.)
To help your child understand the third sound of a, be sure to distinguish
between the short o (as in ostrich) and the third sound of a (as in all). Facing
your child, urge him to watch your lips. Then exaggerating each sound, say,
“©, ostrich, ©” and “ä, all, ä.” Practice saying this phrase until your child can
distinguish between the short o and ä.
For the corresponding sound on the CD, listen to Track 35 for ä.

Examining the umlaut
The umlaut (¨), a diacritical mark, consists of a pair of dots placed over a
letter. An umlaut over an a (ä) makes the /aw/ sound in au, aw, all, alt — the
sound you hear in the word cause. The umlaut commonly appears in the
German language. Linguists borrowed it from German to indicate how to 
pronounce the /aw/ sound.
The third sound of ä is an umlauted vowel, as in bar. Some dictionaries still
use the umlaut over the ä to describe the /aw/ sound, as I do in this book. It
serves very well as a diacritical mark for phonics.
Putting ä to good use
Look at the vowel chart in Chapter 2 and notice the third sound header. See
a3 there? You can tell your child that it’s the third sound of a, and it’s the a
with an umlaut (ä).
You may notice that I describe and use the ä sound three different ways. I use
them interchangeably and they all refer to the /aw/ sound that presents itself
in the au, aw, ar, all, alt words in the following word list.
As you look at the following word list, ask your child to say the aw sound
before she starts. In general, children don’t have a problem with this sound.
You can also ask her to spell some of the patterns she sees in the list:

fun, it’s a great exercise for smooth reading and practicing the /aw/ sound.
Mr. See and His Saw
Sam Soar owned a seesaw. Now, Shawn See’s saw sawed Soar’s seesaw,
before Sam Soar saw Shawn See. That made Soar mad. Had Soar seen
See’s saw before See sawed Soar’s seesaw, See’s saw would not have
sawed Soar’s seesaw. So, See’s saw sawed Soar’s seesaw. But it was sad
to see Soar so mad just because See’s saw sawed Soar’s seesaw.
Activity: Poems
To play: Read the following poems to your child. After discussing how silly
the poems are, ask her which words sounded like the /aw/ sound. Ask her to
spell the words out loud.

Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 

Studying the Third Sounds of o and u
The letter ä isn’t the only letter that makes a third sound — the letters o and
u have a third sound, too. You can hear the third sound of the letter o in the
word move; you can hear the third sound of the letter u in the word bush.
What appears in this section is an organization of tons of words under the
banner of the third sound of o and u.
It’s a confusing bit of phonology. The words are mostly easy and common; it’s
the diacritical marks and the cross-descriptions of the o and u in words and
sounds that get you crazy with confusion. Here’s some background informa-
tion that you may find useful:
 The vowels a, o, and u have three sounds. They’re organized and sys-
tematized on the vowel chart in Chapter 2. Phonics expert Monica
Foltzer thought that because the English language has so many words
with the a (ä) sound as in all, the o (oo) sound as in too, and the u (u)
sound as in put, she would classify as many as she could and place them
into third a3, o3, and u3 sounds.
 Webster’s uses the long oo as in too and the short oo as in put for their
phonetic spelling. The Thorndike and similar dictionaries use the two
dot u (ü) for too, and one dot u (u) for put. School text glossaries use one
or the other, so teaching these sounds originally as the third sounds of o
and u gives you a practical bridge to link the two types of diacritical
marks.
Long o, as in too, can be written as ∂∂, ü, and o3.
The first column of Table 8-1 lists words that make the third sound of o; the
second and third column list words that make the third sound of u. The words
in column three follow no guideline and are partially nonphonetic words. Have
your child read these words, making sure that she pronounces the third sound
of o and u as necessary. Make flashcards for the most common words if they
cause difficulty for your child, but don’t worry about the uncommon words.
The letters in the table that are crossed out are “silent” letters, so they don’t
add any sounds to those words.

Delving into Diphthongs 
and Shortcuts
In This Chapter
 Finding out what diphthongs are
 Understanding diphthongs
 Murmuring about some diphthongs
 Handling shortcut contractions in your speech and reading
T
his chapter looks into the ow, oy, and er diphthongs in one- and two-
syllable words. You may have seen the word diphthong lurking around
in a dusty grammar or spelling book. Or maybe you remember your grade-
school buddies calling each other “dip-thongs.” It’s a funny word that
Webster’s uses to describe three common sounds that you use every day in
your speech and writing.
In this chapter you discover a section on shortcuts in your speech — like
putting two words together with an apostrophe. The apostrophe stands for
the missing letters and gives you a compacted version of the two words. For
example, you see words such as I am, you will, and I would squeezed together
to form I’m, you’ll, and I’d. Contraction usage comes early in reading, and dis-
covering it now can really come in handy.
Introducing Diphthongs: When Vowel
Sound Meets Vowel Sound
A diphthong is a blend of two vowel sounds in one syllable that’s pronounced
as one speech sound. Diphthongs are sometimes called gliding vowels.
Examples of diphthongs include the ou sound in house, the ow sound in cow,

140
Part II: Exploring the Fundamentals of Phonics 
the oi sound in join, and the oy sound in toy. The word diphthong comes from
the Greek di, which means two, and phthong, which means tone. Pronouncing
a diphthong involves making a quick, smooth movement from one vowel
sound to another; it requires assuming two different mouth positions.
The two types of diphthongs are
 Plain diphthongs: The plain diphthong is two vowels in one syllable
making a completely new sound. Examples of words with plain diph-
thongs include out, boy, down, and noise. (This would be a good time to
look at the vowel chart in Chapter 2 and give up a big hurrah, because
these are the last classified vowel sounds. See the next section in this
chapter for information about plain diphthongs.)
 Murmur diphthongs: A murmur diphthong is a vowel and the letter r
in one syllable, making the ur sound. In this case, the r is called a half-
vowel, because it controls the murmur diphthong in the word. For exam-
ple, say the word burn. You surely don’t hear the sound of u in any way,
but you can hear the modified r sound. Examples of these words include
perk, bird, and fur. (See “Exploring Murmur Diphthongs” later in this
chapter for information about murmur diphthongs.)
A diphthong has two different mouth movements, but not necessarily two 
different sounds. For example, in the diphthongs /oi/ or /oy/, the mouth has
two different movements, but you hear only one sound.
Teaching diphthongs by reading lips
Reading lips — that is, watching another’s lips
closely — is an excellent way to commit diph-
thong sounds into memory. As your child
watches your lips move, he can clearly see 
the mouth movements you use to form the 
diphthong.
Face your child face and tell him to watch your
lips as you read the following sentences.
Exaggerate the sounds of the diphthongs as you
read the sentences, and notice that your lips
move in different ways to make the sounds.
Wait for your child’s response before moving on
to the following numbered sentences.
1. Watch my lips as I say ow. Can you see my
lips?
2. Do you notice the two positions that my lips
form as I say this sound: ow?
3. Can you say this sound, ow, and feel your
lips move to two separate positions?
4. Say the ow sound fast! Do you notice that
this sound, ow, becomes one vowel sound?
5. Now say powder at a regular speed. Can
you hear that the ow sound is there, but
toned down by the consonant sounds of p
and d?
When you finish this exercise, substitute the
oi/oy sound for the ou/ow sound in the script.
This script is a fast, cute way for kids to learn
the two diphthongs.

Sounding Out ou/ow and oi/oy
Diphthongs that make the ou/ow sound and the oi/oy sound are kind of
tricky. Notice in these diphthongs that the y and w act as vowels. Consider
the following about plain diphthongs:
 Each diphthong contains two vowels with regard to its spelling, but
makes one new sound.
 The ou/ow diphthong makes one sound but can be spelled in two differ-
ent ways. For example, you pronounce the diphthongs in house and cow
the same way.
 The oi/oy diphthong also makes the one sound but can be spelled in two
different ways. For example, you pronounce the diphthongs in soil and
boy the same way.
 Your lips assume two different positions when you pronounce a diph-
thong. You notice this when you exaggerate the sound of a diphthong as
you pronounce it.
Getting to know the ou/ow diphthong
Table 9-1 gives your child sufficient practice with the ou/ow diphthong. Have
your child read the words carefully. Start with the first two columns (the ows)
before doing the last two columns (the ous).

Chapter 9: Delving into Diphthongs and Shortcuts

Have your child read these sentences silently and then say them aloud for
practice:
Mom, is our milk sour now?
Can Howard come to our house?
How did Kate count the brown cows?
For the corresponding sound on the CD, listen to Track 38 for ou.
Recognizing two ways to use ow
Besides being a diphthong (as in how), ow is also a digraph. For example, you
see it in the words flow and show. If you say the words how and flow one after
the other, you can hear that the ow makes a different sound in the words.
These words don’t rhyme even though they both have the ow ending. They
don’t rhyme because the ow in how is a diphthong and the ow in show is a
vowel digraph. See Chapter 5 for more information about digraphs.
How do you know when ow is a diphthong and when it’s a digraph? I wish 
I could give you a hard and fast rule, but only the context of the sentence 
can give you a clue as to the correct pronunciation.
Table 9-2 contains words with ow digraphs and diphthongs. Have your child
read these words aloud.

5. Dale began to mow the grass.
6. She put rose powder on her cheeks.
7. White Oak Creek had a strong flow.
8. The master stood at the prow of his ship.
Getting to know the oi/oy diphthong
The oi/oy diphthong can appear in the middle (royal) or at the end (toy) of a
word or syllable.
Table 9-3 presents words that contain the oi/oy diphthong. To make it easier
for your child to master this sound, I divide the table into three columns —
each group of words is successively harder to read. Your child may come
across the words in the third column in his reading.

thongs in the story.
The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse
A country mouse did ask a town mouse, who was a good chum, to pay
him a visit and eat of his country fare. They began to eat on the bare plow
lands. They ate wheat-stocks and roots from bushes. The town mouse
said to his friend, “You live the life of the ants out here, while my house in
town has the horn of plenty. I have everything that I need, and if you will
come with me, and I wish you would, you will have a great share of my
food stock.” With much joy Country Mouse joined his friend as they made
their way to South Brown County for a jolly good feast. When they got to
the large and rich-looking house, Town Mouse led the way to a sun-filled
kitchen through a small crack in the wall. There lay before them good
treats of all kinds. The country mouse sat down as Town Mouse set
before him bits of pork, sour grapes, sweet corn, dried figs, and best of all
a sweet hunk of cheese from a round tin. Country Mouse was glad to feel
such good cheer. He said thanks in warm terms, sad that his life was so
hard in the country.
They began to put some food in their mouths when the maid came in to
get a plate and saucer from the cupboard. She spoiled their feast! The two
mice ran and were more scared than they had ever been in their lives.
Country Mouse did still feel quite hungry, and in a bit of a pout, said to
his dear friend, “Although you set before for me a feast of great taste, I
must leave you to eat it by yourself. Your life has too many pitfalls to
please me. I just like to live my plain life in the country with my roots
from the bushes and wheat-stocks from the plow lands. I can be safe
there and not be in fear. Please come and visit sometime soon out in my
country. I vow to show you a smooth night and a safe day void of stress
and fear. Good-bye my dear friend.”

Exploring Murmur Diphthongs
Murmur diphthongs make the ur sound. As far as spelling goes, the murmur
diphthong can be rendered with the letters ur, ir, or er. No matter which
spelling you use, the diphthong makes the ur sound, as in the word urn.
These r-controlled diphthongs are simple to read, but harder to spell. Some
memorization of spelling applies here.
145
Chapter 9: Delving into Diphthongs and Shortcuts

Making sounds with r-controlled 
diphthongs
Table 9-4 lists words with murmur diphthongs. I sorted them into three
columns to make these diphthongs easier for your child to absorb. Make sure
your child understands that all three spellings (er, ir, and ur) represent the
same sound. Children can test their memorization skills to see whether they
can spell these words correctly. Later, your child will also learn that on occa-
sion, ar (dollar) and or (doctor) can also make the ur sound.

Grandma and the Cowboy
Did you hear about Grandma Turner, who tried to help her grandson,
Howie, dress for school? Howie needed Grandma to help him with his
brown and tan cowboy boots. He asked for help and she could see why.
Even with her pulling and him pushing, the little boots still didn’t want to
go on his feet.
147
Chapter 9: Delving into Diphthongs and Shortcuts

Finally, when she got the second boot on, she was tired. She almost cried
when the little boy said, “Grandma, they’re on the wrong feet.” She
looked and she said, “Yep! They are!” So, she pulled the boots off, which
wasn’t easy.
She kept her cool as they both worked to get the boots back on the
right feet. She said, “Now your boots are on the right feet!” The little
cowboy said, “These aren’t my boots, Grandma.” She was fit to be tied!
Once again she tried to help him pull the boots off his little feet. When
they got the boots off, Howie said, “They’re Ferd’s boots. He made me
wear them.” Now she didn’t know if she should laugh or cry. But, being a
grandma with staying power, she helped him into his coat and asked,
“Now, where are your mittens?” He answered, “I stuffed them in the toes
of my boots.”

Roy Rogers
Roy Rogers was a famous TV cowboy. Roy was born in Cincinnati, Ohio,
in 1911. His family was poor and wanted a good life on the farm. His dad
and Uncle Will took a houseboat upriver and floated to Portsmouth, Ohio.
Dad Slye (Roy’s real name was Leonard Slye) and the family lived on a
farm in Duck Run. The farm soil did not help the family much even
though Mr. Slye used a plow. The dad went to work full time to make
shoes for the family in Portsmouth. He purchased a horse for Roy. That is
how Roy became such a good rider.
The family returned to Cincinnati, and the father went to work on shoes
there. Roy joined his dad at the shoe factory, too.
The family left the city, and went to California to work as truck drivers.
That didn’t happen, because there were no jobs to be had. Roy and his
father became workers who went from farm to farm picking fruit and 
toiling in the soil.
After that, Mr. Slye went to Los Angeles to work at another shoemaker’s
job. Roy stayed on the farms. He sang and played his guitar at night
around the campfires. Seeing the joy that his guitar and singing gave to
the men, he wanted to become a singer.
He and his cousin Stan went to Los Angeles to start their music job.
They called their group Sons of the Pioneers and became famous.
Roy Rogers took his men to TV, and everyone knows Roy as the
TV cowboy of the 1950s. He had a horse, Trigger, and a dog, Bullet.
Children in the ’50s would not miss watching the TV show, which was
on every Sunday.
Roy and his wife, Dale, had children of their own and several adopted
children. They had a big ranch in Apple Valley, California. He and Dale
were well loved by many and he is in the Country Music Hall of Fame.

The Man in Our Town
There was a man in our town,
And he was wondrous wise,
He jumped into a bramble bush,
And scratched out both his eyes;
But when he saw his eyes were out,
With all his might and main,
He jumped into another bush,
And scratched ’em in again.

Discovering How Vowel Sounds 
Change in Contractions
I’m taking a small detour here to tell you about contractions. I’ve found that
kids start to notice contractions, such as the word don’t, very early in read-
ing. The contractions at the stage that I’ve reached in this portion of the book
are small, one-syllable words, mostly, and certainly aren’t advanced phonics.
A contraction is a word made from two words that have been joined together
and made shorter. Contractions are basically speech shortcuts. Three things
happen when we contract or squeeze words together: Letters disappear,
sounds disappear, and an apostrophe (’) appears in the place of the missing
letters and sounds to mark their absence. An apostrophe is a punctuation
mark that shows the omission of one or more letters.
Here are two examples or contractions:
 What’s: This is a contraction of “what is,” with the apostrophe taking the
place of the i.
 I’d: This is a contraction of “I would,” with the apostrophe taking the
place of the woul.
This discussion about contractions is mainly about reading and spelling —
not grammar.
Table 9-5 includes the most commonly used word contractions, with an 
example of each contraction in a sentence. Have your child read each set.

Protecting and preserving the apostrophe
John Richards started the Apostrophe Protection
Society in 2001 with the “specific aim of pre-
serving the correct use of the much abused
punctuation mark.” Here are the Society’s guide-
lines for the correct use of apostrophes:
 Use an apostrophe to denote a missing
letter or letters (it is, it’s).
 Use an apostrophe to denote possession by
a single person or thing (the dog’s bone or
the dog’s bones). In this case, the apostro-
phe comes before the s.
 Use an apostrophe to denote possession by
more than one person or thing (the dogs’
bone or the dogs’ bones). In this case, the
apostrophe comes after the s.

Stepping Through the
Pronunciation Process
In This Chapter
 Working through the process of pronunciation
 Uncovering the syllables
 Getting the emphasis right
 Seeing y in different ways
I
n this chapter you discover how to teach your child good pronunciation
by looking at the composition of multisyllable words and seeing how to
apply accents (stressed or emphasized syllables). You also look at root words
and the versatile letter y.
When your child is able to read multisyllable words, you need to understand
the how’s and why’s of pronunciation. Your work is mainly with two-syllable
words ending in y. This is a pretty big jump, so take your time.
Unlocking the Sounds of Words
To pronounce means to utter a word or sound in a particular way, especially
with a certain accent or according to an accepted standard. You’ve probably
heard this before, but didn’t you wonder why the people across the river, up
the road, or in another state talk differently than you?
American English words are spelled the same all over the United States, but
regional inflections (distinctive ways words are spoken) change the way
some words sound. The way words are spoken, which determines how they
sound, depends upon how they’re pronounced. And the way words are pro-
nounced is called pronunciation! Now isn’t that clever?

You may have heard people speak with a New England drawl or a Kentucky
twang or a Minnesota clip. Although regional differences of pronunciation
may cause words to sound different from place to place, the meanings remain
the same. And in most instances, what a person is saying is discernible with
careful listening, no matter where you’re from.
Proper pronunciation of English words follows basic guidelines, patterns, and
structures of language. You may say two-MAY-toes, and I may say toe-MA-toes,
but we both know we’re talking about tomatoes and not feet!
Although the exploration of regional dialects is interesting, it’s beyond the
scope of this book. However, wherever you live or were born in the United
States, good pronunciation is important for building good reading and
spelling skills. And that is what this book is about! Good pronunciation
encompasses recognizing long and short vowels, understanding the parts of
words called syllables, and knowing which part of a word is emphasized.
Finding the syllables to say
A syllable is a word or a part of a word that’s pronounced with a single unin-
terrupted sound of the voice. Some people say that syllables are broken parts
of words.
Some facts about syllables are:
 Syllables can be considered building blocks of multisyllable words.
 A syllable is a word or part of a word with one vowel sound.
 At least one vowel is present in a syllable.
After all that, sometimes it’s still easier to show a child examples to help her
catch on. Say some three-syllable words and slap your hand down, counting
each syllable. Children usually get the hang of it quickly, but remember that
they do need to understand what a syllable is. For example, say these words
and slap your hand on the table as you speak each syllable:
 Syllable (syl-la-ble)
 Tomato (to-ma-to)
 Strawberry (straw-ber-ry)
160
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 

Accenting syllables for proper emphasis
If you’re looking at words in a dictionary, you see definitions as well as visual
representations (which are letters and symbols) of how the spoken parts of
the sounds of a word (sounds) are pronounced. But wait, there’s more! Inter-
spersed among those letters are diacritical marks. No, diacritical isn’t a curse
that an actor places on a movie critic who panned his latest film! Diacritical
simply means to distinguish or show differences. You may also know about
phoneme and grapheme, but I don’t recommend teaching them to your kids
at this point. I choose not to use those words.
Hey, just for fun, why not get out your dictionary right now and look up some
of these new terms to see the syllables and the marks used with the sylla-
bles? Also check out the sidebar in this chapter, “Setting up a pronunciation
key,” for more on diacritical marks.
An important mark, and the one I’m most concerned with in this chapter, is
the accent mark (´). The accent indicates an emphasis or stress in a word or
syllable.
For example, look up the word diacritical (or diacritic, which is the root word)
in your dictionary. You will see that the syllables are di-a-crit-i-cal. Now,
where’s the accent mark? You may see two — one skinny and one fat. You’re
looking for the fat one because it shows which syllable gets the emphasis:
diaCRITical. If you already have your dictionary out, look up these words
161
Chapter 10: Stepping Through the Pronunciation Process
Setting up a pronunciation key
Accents and diacritical marks are characters or
signs that are added to a letter to indicate a spe-
cial pronunciation.
The following presentation of diacritical marks
and their definitions is a specifically drawn pro-
nunciation key for Phonics For Dummies:
 Short vowel: breve (˘) as in p|n
 Long vowel: macron (¯) as in n≈me
 Third sound of a: umlaut (¨) as in säw
 Third sound of o: ∂∂or umlaut (ü) as in move
or zoom
 Third sound of u: one dot u or ©© as in put or
wood
 Diphthong sound: slur ( ) as in out, boy,
ow/ou, oi/oy, pert, irk, er/ir/ur, and or as in
fork.
 Stressed vowel or syllable: accent mark (á)
as in ba´by
 Vowel sound: schwa (‡) as in lo’c‡l
 Line: hyphen (-) joins or separates syllables
as in mix-up

with your child and find the fat accent mark for each. Say the words together
out loud, putting extra oomph on the accented (stressed) syllable: express,
Halloween, lacing, medicine, and vitamin.
When you speak the words of the English language, the accented syllable is
often determined by where on the planet you live.
Even the people of different regions in the same country may speak with a
different accent.
Accenting syllables for proper meaning
The way you pronounce multisyllable words depends upon the way you say
the sounds of the letters and the stress (accent) that you place on a specific
syllable. The syllable that you stress in pronunciation is called the accented
syllable.
Now, here’s the twist! As you know, the wonderful English language has words
that sound the same but aren’t spelled the same. In addition, English has
those tricky words that look the same yet sound and mean something com-
pletely different. What’s the distinguishing factor? Yes! The accent mark!
These nefarious words even have their own name: heteronyms. (Go ahead,
feel free to look up nefarious and heteronym in the dictionary. I know you’re
dying to! Stopping to look up new words is a good habit for you and your
child to get into. And you’ll see that I’m exaggerating a bit by describing 
heteronyms as nefarious.)
So how do you know which way to pronounce a heteronym when you bump
into one in a sentence? In a word: context. Consider the word within the con-
text of the entire sentence or sometimes the whole paragraph. But for now,
focus on words, because if you don’t know the words, context (and all that
advanced stuff) won’t help you.
The accent can even change the definition of a word, such as ob’ ject and ob
jeçt. These words are spelled the same, but have different meanings, merely
because of the placement of the accent mark. Table 10-1 highlights a few 
heteronyms, or words that have the same spelling but different pronunciations
and meanings. You can read them to your child with a brief explanation. Read
these listings from left to right.

Discovering some accent strategies
Although it’s impossible to create nice and neat, hard and fast rules for 
reading accents, syllables, and vowel sounds, here are some helpful general
guidelines:
 Look for accents on the first syllable. (ba’ by, stud’ y)
 The accent is usually on the main root word when the word has a prefix
or suffix. (un did’, thank’ ful)
 If prefixes such as de-, re-, in-, pro-, or a- are the first syllables in a word,
the word usually isn’t accented. (de cide’, re group’, in sist’, pro pel’, 
a gain’)
 If you have two vowels together in the last syllable of the word, the 
combination often shows that the accent is on the last syllable. (de rail’,
com plain’)
 If you have two consonants that are the same letter, the syllable that
comes before the two consonants is usually accented. (fret’ ted, rot’ ted)
 If you have a word with three or more syllables, one of the first two sylla-
bles is usually accented. (ex ten’ sion, con di’ tion)
163
Chapter 10: Stepping Through the Pronunciation Process

Understanding y in Syllables
The letter y has many faces; in other words, it’s a really versatile letter. For
example, here are some of the variations a y exhibits in different words:
 It can be a consonant at the start of a word: yam
 It can be a silent vowel at the end of a word: play
 It can be a long vowel at the end of a word: dry, lady
 It can be a long vowel inside of a word: eye, embryo
In fact, the y can be called a chameleon letter because it makes different
sounds (or no sound) in different words. (For more on y, see Chapters 7 
and 13.)
Some examples of the y as a long i are: by, cry, thy, my, fry, try, dry, why, shy,
sty, sky, spy, fly, pry, ply, sly, spry, bye, aye, eye, rye, lye, and dye. Making word
strips here provides some reinforcement before the next table.
The letters x, u, y, and w are often called chameleon letters because, like the
chameleon lizard that can change its skin to many different colors, they have
different sounds.
Eek! It’s a y!
The letter y also works beautifully in multisyllable words and displays more
of its chameleon-like qualities. Look closely at the two-syllable words in the
next list. The words all end with a y that you pronounce like a long e (√)
164
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 
Exposing root words with suffixes and prefixes
A root is a word or word part to which you add
suffixes and prefixes to make new words. For
example: Faith is the root word of faithful.
A prefix is a syllable added to the beginning of a
word, or root, to change its meaning to form a
new word. For example: Re- is the prefix in the
word return.
A suffix is almost always a syllable or syllables
added to the end of a word to form another
word of different meaning or function. For
example: The suffix -er is at the end of the word
paint, changing it to painter. See Chapter 14 for
more on root words.

sound. When y comes at the end of a word with two or more syllables, and
the y syllable isn’t accented (meaning it isn’t the stressed syllable), then the y
has the sound of a long e (as in happy!). Make a note of this because lots of
kids tend to write what they hear. You may want to remind your child to go
from vowel sound to vowel sound in the words. That’s why these vowels
have been underlined. Although some of these words look a little difficult,
she’ll soon enjoy being able to sound out the three- and four-syllable words.
To help your child become familiar with the long e sound of y, have her read
through each of the words in the following list.

Have your child read these sentences for practice:
The funny baby has wavy hair.
Penny had a pony named Smoky.
A tidy lady likes to clean.
Aye, I see y!
In this section, you look at what happens when y is attached to an ending syl-
lable that’s stressed. For example, in the word multiply, the chameleon y
sounds like a long i. Why? Because the emphasis falls on the final y syllable
(mul-ti-ply´).

When y comes at the end of a word with two or more syllables, and the y syl-
lable is accented, y has the sound of long i (∫).
Here’s a great way to gain a tactile and audible sense of the syllables and the
emphasis (accent). Lay your hand flat on the table. Starting with the little
finger, tap one finger per syllable while saying the words in Table 10-3. Tap
with a heavier beat on the accented syllable. Show your child how to do this
as well and do it together if you want.
Here’s another way to feel stress: Put your hand, back side up, under your
chin. Pronounce the word naturally. The syllable that causes your chin to
drop the most is the stressed syllable. When “feeling for stress” you must
pronounce the word naturally.
If you see that your child is feeling stressed when you work through the table,
stop and circle each syllable in each word, and then have her go from vowel
sound to vowel sound.
Now you’re ready to apply this new insight. Have your child read through the
words in the following list. You want to hear the long i sound, as well as the
proper emphasis on the final syllable:
166

When the y flies and plays!
Now that you and your child have a somewhat solid grip on the slippery y,
here’s more information to round out your understanding. How do you make
a word ending in y plural? Here are a couple of guidelines:
 All names or nouns ending with y when preceded by a consonant form
their plurals by changing y to ies. Examples include changing cherry to
cherries and fly to flies. You may have heard this guideline stated as
“Change the y to i and ad -es.”
 If a, e, or o precedes the y, the plural is formed by adding only an s.
For example, day becomes days, ploy becomes ploys, and key
becomes keys.
Read the words in Table 10-4. Do you see what happens when you make a
plural out of the word? You drop the y, change it to i and add -es.

Accessing Opened and Closed Syllables
As your child advances in reading and writing skills, she needs to know
basic syllable division (also called syllabication). Syllable division can be
helpful for decoding multisyllable words. Syllable division looks at the posi-
tion of the vowels and consonants, and whether the vowel is long, short, or a
vowel pair.
A hyphen (-) is the punctuation mark used either to join words or to separate
syllables. This isn’t the whole story, but it’s good for starters. Right now,
you’re going to learn how it separates syllables. Just two for now: syllabication
division. You can check out Appendix A for a complete unit on syllabication
division. However, right now is a good time to learn two important things
about syllabication division:
 If a word has one consonant between two vowels, and the first vowel is
short, the word is usually divided after the consonant. This is called a
closed syllable. For example: rob-in, com-ics, grav-el, pol-ish.
 If a word has one consonant between two vowels, and the first vowel is
long, the word is usually divided after the first vowel. This is called an
open syllable. For example: mu-sic, la-bor, pa-per, Po-lish.
168
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 

If you’re wondering why these syllables are referred to as open or closed, I
offer a little more explanation:
 Closed syllables went into lockdown because of the consonants.
 Open syllables have a vowel left hanging.
 If you hear a short vowel in the first syllable, you close the syllable with
a consonant, as in the word rob-in.
 If you hear a long vowel in the first syllable, as in the word mo-tel, the
vowel is the last letter of the syllable, keeping the syllable open.
Although this generalization is less than perfect, it’s a good guideline.
With the exception of the word occupy, the words in Table 10-3 all contain 
at least one schwa sound (a quick ±h), that is, an unaccented syllable. The
schwa (‡) is also in the earlier sidebar “Setting up a pronunciation key.” If you
introduce the schwa now, your child will have an easier time understanding it
when you encounter it in Chapter 15.
Unaccented syllables (marked by the schwa in the dictionary) seldom have a
definite long- or short-vowel sound, and you really need to play by ear and
syllabicate accordingly. If you want to, you can introduce your child to the
dictionary at this juncture and hunt for some two-syllable words for practice.
After your child masters the words in Tables 10-2 and 10-3, she’s ready to
divide more difficult words (three and four syllables) as she meets them in
her reading.
Activity: Stories: y
Preparation: You need paper and pencil.
To play: Ask your child to read these stories out loud to find out how fluent
she is. You want your child to read with expression and, above all, be
smooth. When you get to the last story in this section, ask your child to write
all the two-syllable words that end in y on a separate piece of paper.
A Visit to the Park
One day, Sally, Bobby, and Danny asked Mommy and Daddy Hardy if they
could go to the park. There was a park five streets from their house. The
family lived in a two-story house on Purdy Drive. It was near the railroad
tracks. Mommy said they could go if they would be home for lunch. Sally
was very happy and thanked Mommy.
169
Chapter 10: Stepping Through the Pronunciation Process

The children left for the park with their wide-awake dog, Smoky, who was
barking at their feet. The first thing they saw was a lost puppy. Smoky
barked at the funny, wiggly puppy, and the scared little puppy ran away
from them.
When they got close to the main street, which led to the park, a neighbor
stopped to talk with them. Her name was Mrs. Ann Rally. She had a happy
little baby in her buggy. She told the children to be safe when they crossed
the busy street.
So far, they were having fun. Bobby and Danny began to run away from
Sally. She said that they should stay by her, because she was ten and they
were not as old as she.
When Sally ran after them, the boys were already on the swings. The
Hardy children had a good time that sunny day.
Fun on the Farm
The Duffy family lived on a big farm of fifty acres. They had four peppy
children named Jack, Jamie, Polly, and a rosy-cheeked baby whose name
was Lizzy. There was a puppy called Floppy and a kitty named Fluffy.
They could hear the pony, Tawny, whinny in the barn.
Sometimes little Lizzy was fussy, but most of the time, she had a sunny
way about her. Polly always had her dolly with her, and the boys told her
that she was silly.
One day they asked Mommy if they could have a party outside on the
grassy spot in the backyard. It was a shady yard, but it was hilly and
rocky. Jack said it was fine and they could still have plenty of fun.
Mommy gave the children a pretty cloth to lay on the ground. Jamie got
some jelly and ham. Polly got a bag of cookies, and Jack had plates and
napkins. The lunch was yummy even if their hands were sticky from the
messy jelly. Mommy gave them candy, too.
With her tummy filled, the baby got sleepy and took a nap in her buggy.
The boys ran off to play, and Polly and her dolly went to the swing and
sat down.
Daddy Duffy got back from town and sat on a grassy spot for lunch. All in
all the Duffy family was a jolly bunch.
A Lucky Pony
My name is Henry, and this is the story of Rocky, my pony, and how I
came to be his happy master.
One lucky day, a lost and muddy pony walked slowly down our lane. His
mane was shoddy and looked as if it had not been brushed for a long
170
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 

time. There was a navy blue rope tied around his neck. Rocky was smelly
and his hide was saggy. Did he run away or had some person turned him
loose? He was in a needy shape, and I was happy to take care of him.
Daddy felt it was his duty to ask many people around our homey little
town if they knew anything about Rocky. No one came forth, so from that
misty morning on, Rocky stayed.
Our family fed him a bounty and he drank from the pond for many years.
Rocky’s coat was always shiny and he was full of energy. He lived for
twenty years or more.
In those days, the best part of every day was when I swiftly jumped upon
his back and rode around the town. Rocky and I were best buddies until I
went into the army.

Finding Happy Endings 
with Suffixes
In This Chapter
 Getting up close and personal with the ed suffix
 Taking a quick look at ing and er suffixes
 Tackling suffix spelling challenges
 Wrapping up with root words
A
re you up for a little challenge? Great! In this chapter, you take on two-
and three-letter word endings (called suffixes) that present some twists.
A suffix is added on to the end of a word, and it can change the sound of the
word, its meaning, and even the number of syllables. In fact, a suffix can even
make a word travel through time from the present into the past!
This chapter looks at how you pronounce and spell words with the ed, ing,
and er suffixes. These suffixes can be attached to almost any verb. For exam-
ple, skate can become skated, skating, and skater. And rub can become rubbed,
rubbing, and rubber.
As an adult, you may tend to take these suffixes for granted, but if you look
closely at them, you notice that attaching a suffix to a word can change it in
subtle ways. Take skate, for example. Adding a suffix to this word gives it an
additional syllable, which isn’t necessarily true of all verbs with suffixes.
Dropped, for example, is still a one-syllable word after you add the ed suffix.
As for rub, notice how it gains an additional b when you attach a suffix to it.
This chapter helps you and your child explore suffixes, pronounce words
with suffixes, and learn how to spell these words. Don’t tense up! It’ll all work
out in the end.

Exploring the ed Suffix
The ed suffix offers challenges in meaning, tense, and sound. In grammar,
tense isn’t about being uptight, but rather refers to the form of a verb (an
action word) that shows when an action takes place. The verb’s tense tells
you whether an action happened in the past, present, or future. The simple
past tense describes actions that happened sometime in the past.
You form the simple past tense by adding the letters ed to the end of a verb.
For example, the past tense of the verb stop is stopped. (I tell you where that
extra p comes from in a minute.) Sometimes adding the ed suffix to a verb to
form the past tense adds another syllable to the word. For example, rented,
the past tense of the verb rent, is two syllables long.
The ed suffix also has three different sounds. Isn’t the English language glori-
ously complicated? These sounds are |d (as in listed), t (as in trapped), and d
(as in robbed).
Tables 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3 demonstrate the three phonics patterns that occur
when you add ed to a verb to form the past tense. These three phonics pat-
terns are:
 The |d ending: After verbs ending in t and d, the letters ed make the |d
sound (see Table 11-1). When you add the ed suffix to words ending in t
and d, the word gains an additional syllable.
`
 The t ending: After verbs ending in s, x, k, ck, sh, ch, p, and f, the ed
suffix makes the t sound (see Table 11-2). When you add the ed suffix to
words ending in these letters, you don’t add an additional syllable.
 The d ending: After verbs ending in all other letters of the alphabet, the
letters ed make the d sound (see to Table 11-3). These words also don’t
get an additional syllable when the ed suffix is added.
176
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 
The past-tense suffix here and now
To understand what past tense means, a child
must understand the difference between the
past and the present. Don’t take it for granted
that children understand the difference; the
concept of past and present tense can be hard
for a young child of 4 or 5 to understand.
Sometimes young kids can read like nobody’s
business, but concepts like the past tense are
too abstract for them to grasp initially.
Children on the young side can usually read the
words presented in this chapter, but they may
not fully grasp how the words are spelled or the
grammar associated with the past and present
tense. Don’t worry about it. As children progress
beyond the basics in phonics, they pick up new
concepts at their own pace. Eventually children
understand the past tense as long as they keep
practicing.

Having three sounds for one suffix can be confusing at first. For most chil-
dren, adding ed comes naturally as their speech progresses, beginning
around age 2. The confusion lies only in spelling past-tense verbs correctly
when they begin to read.
Working with the ed suffix
When teaching the past-tense ed words, pronounce the words as your child
looks at them on the printed page. This technique helps reinforce the sound
represented by the ed and also what the letters ed do to the end of a word.
Before your child reads the words in the tables in this chapter, choose a
handful of words from each table, write them down, and say the endings in 
an exaggerated fashion.
Exaggerating the pronunciation of past-tense verbs can help your child hear
the difference among the ed sounds. For example, if you say worked, make
sure your child hears the t sound; if you say stunned, make sure he hears the
d distinctly; if you say listed, he should clearly hear the ed.
Notice in all three tables (Tables 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3) that the vowel in the
first syllable in every word (the root word) makes the short sound. Beyond
that, the words in Table 11-1 are two-syllable words (for example, tinted,
planted, and ended), whereas the words in the other two tables are one sylla-
ble long. Watch out! The one-syllable words in Table 11-2 and Table 11-3 are
the confusing ones. Even though these words have the ed suffix, they contain
only one syllable. Mixed and scrubbed, for example, are only one syllable.
Ask your child to read the columns. Refer to the columns as column 1,
column 2, and so on. It enhances the child’s ability to follow directions. For
example, the parent instructs the child to the number of the column. This
preparation can take place even before the parent sits down. Maybe the
lesson is going to be brief, so the parent says, “Put your finger on the third
column; we’re only going to do this one now.”

After your child masters the words in Tables 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3, have him
read these sentences for practice. The goal is for him to be able to read as he
speaks, so you want him to read each sentence to himself and then say it out
loud with expression, naturally speaking the words in the sentence.
The boy wended his way on the rented pony.
We sifted and blended the mix.
I scrubbed and mopped the dirty floor.
Mastering the ed suffix
Adding ed isn’t a difficult process, so the exercises in this section are stimu-
lating but not difficult. These skill boosters enhance your child’s ability to
spell and read well.

Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 

Taking on Suffix Spelling Challenges
The difficulty with words having the suffixes ed, ing, and er lies not only in
the reading, but also in the spelling. Adding the ed suffix to a word sometimes
means adding an additional syllable, and that makes decoding and spelling
words even harder. This section looks at the challenges of spelling words that
end in ed, ing, and er.
Doubling consonants (or not) 
with suffixes
When the ed, ing, or er suffix is added to a one-syllable word and the last
three letters of the word follow the consonant-vowel-consonant (cvc) pat-
tern, you double the final consonant in the word. For example, the last three
letters in the word spot (pot) follow the cvc pattern, so the final consonant, t,
is doubled when a suffix is added to the word (spot, spotting, spotted). However,
if the last three letters of the word follow the vowel-consonant-consonant (vcc)
pattern, you don’t double the last consonant. For example, the last three let-
ters in the word pump (ump) follow the vcc pattern, so the final consonant, p,
isn’t doubled when a suffix is added to the word (pump, pumped, pumping).
Look at the pattern of the last three letters in the words in this list. Notice
what happens or doesn’t happen to the last consonant when a suffix is added
to these words:
plan: planned, planning, planner
drum: drummed, drumming, drummer
jest: jested, jesting, jester
scratch: scratched, scratching, scratcher
You can choose from two approaches when teaching your child how to spell
words with ing, ed, and er suffixes:
 Have your child look at the whole word (popping, for example), the root
word (pop), and the suffix (ing). Point to the root word, and either show
your child that the consonant after the vowel is doubled when the suffix
is added or show him that two consonants appear after the vowel.
 When the ed, ing, or er suffix is added to a word whose last syllable is a
short vowel, and the last three letters of the word follow the consonant-
vowel-consonant (cvc) pattern, the final consonant in the word is doubled.
181
Chapter 11: Finding Happy Endings with Suffixes

Reading short-vowel words with suffixes
In a word that ends with the suffix ing, ed, or er, the first vowel is usually
short if it comes before two consonants. For example, listen to the short
vowel in these words: dipping, rubbed, and sitter. This guideline can help your
child correctly pronounce words that end in ing, ed, or er. When reading
these words with your child, point out the short-vowel sound in the word’s
root. After some practice, your child will be able to decode these words by
applying the short-vowel sound before doubled consonants.
Read the following list with your child. Point out how the first vowel in a
word is short because it comes before two consonants.

Chapter 11: Finding Happy Endings with Suffixes

Adding suffixes to long-vowel words
Adding suffixes to words with long-vowel sounds involves a small disappear-
ing act. Words with long vowels typically end in e (see Chapter 7 for an expla-
nation of long vowels). The word joke, for example, makes the long o sound
and ends with the letter e. When you want to add the suffix ing, er, or ed to
one of these long-vowel words, the e has to disappear. 
Have your child read the following list. It demonstrates how to pronounce
long-vowel words that have the ing, ed, or er suffix. Tell your child to hear the
long vowels — a, e, i, o, and u — inside the words as he says the words.

his chapter is kind of sweet. Why? Well, think about parfait desserts for a
minute. You know, those desserts that have alternating layers of ice
cream and fruit, or two different flavors of puddings stacked in a tall glass
dish. You start eating and you taste strawberry. Then you hit the next layer
and you taste lime. Then strawberry again. Then lime again. Yum! Just like
the consonants s, c, and g. Each of them has two sounds, just like one parfait
dessert has two flavors!
This chapter starts by reviewing how the letter s makes the z sound. Then it
focuses on the sounds for the letter c. The letter c doesn’t have its own sound
(meaning it never says its name in a word), but instead sometimes sounds
like k and sometimes like s. You also discover the hard and soft g sounds,
such as the g sound in gum and the g sound in gem. These three consonants
have more challenging consonant sounds.
Throughout this chapter, your child may encounter words that she doesn’t
know yet. Even though the primary focus of this book is decoding words
through phonics, some words give you an excellent opportunity to teach
your child vocabulary and comprehension. When she reads an unfamiliar
word and asks what it means, explain the meaning of the word and use it in a
sentence or two.

Sounding s As z in Words
If you read the heading to this section, you discover the two sounds an s can
make. It can sound like an s (as in sounding) or a z (as in words).
Knowing when to pronounce s as a z is a little tougher to grasp, so that’s
what I focus on in this section.
“Z” clue to pronouncing the se ending
When words end in se, they almost always end with a z sound, like in the
word hose. An example of an exception is the word vise, where the s sounds
like s. However, put the prefix ad- in front of it, and vise becomes advise
where the s sounds like z. Then you have the quirky word grease; the s is 
pronounced by some people as a z, and by others as an s.
Despite these examples, when you see se at the end of the word, think z first
and you’ll usually be right. Some exceptions include course, horse, and Norse.
The following list has words that end with the letters se and make a z sound.
Have your child read the words for practice. You may also have her spell
each word aloud after she reads the words. Point out that although these
words end in the letters se, they make the z sound at the end.

Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 
Consonants with two sounds
As you and your child work through this book,
you get a good, solid look at the 26 consonants
and vowels that comprise the alphabet. At this
point, you know how different consonants and
vowels really are. But, do you know what dis-
tinguishes consonants from vowels? Here are a
few factoids:
 Pronouncing consonant sounds correctly
requires you to use your lips, tongue, and
teeth. They’re considered closed sounds.
 Pronouncing vowel sounds doesn’t require
using your lips or teeth, and you move only
the back of your tongue a little bit. Vowels
are called open sounds because they come
from the open mouth.
 Consonants are any letters in the alphabet
that aren’t vowels (a, e, i, o, and u). (Y and
w are consonants that sometimes behave
like vowels.)
 Voiced and voiceless refer to consonants;
open and closed refer to vowels.

Have your child read the following sentences for practice. Ask her to read
them silently to herself first, and then read them out loud with expression to
you, naturally speaking the words in the sentence. The goal is for her to be
able to read as she speaks.
Rose plays cards with me on Sunday.
If you grease the pan, the cake comes out well.
Please close the door, Roy.
“Z” clue of voiced consonants
Here’s a fun fact: Although all consonants make sounds, not all consonants
are voiced. What does that mean? Simply that to produce a voiced consonant,
you use your voice; to produce a voiceless consonant, you expel air to pro-
duce the sound. (See Chapter 5 for more on voiced and voiceless consonants.)
The voiceless consonants are t, p, k, and f. When a word ends with a voice-
less consonant followed by an s, the s sounds like s. For example, hats, naps,
picks, and doffs.
However, when a voiced consonant is followed by an s at the end of a word,
the s sounds like z. For example, digs is pronounced like digz because g is a
voiced consonant.
Voiced consonants like the ones in this list are easy to read, but your child
may have difficulty spelling them. Have your child notice in this table what
sound the letter s makes when it follows a voiced consonant.

Tuning into Nice c Sounds
The letter c can sound like k (as in cat) or like s (as in city). When the letter c
makes the sound of k, it is called a hard c; when the letter c makes the sound
of s, it is called a soft c.
How do you know when to pronounce the hard or soft c? The letter c makes
the hard k sound when it appears before the letters a, o, or u. For example,
listen to the sound of c in these words: card, cord, curd. When c appears
before the vowels e or i, or the consonant y, it makes a soft c sound: certain,
city, cycle. The following sections give you and your child more practice with
these sounds.
Hard c sound before a, o, and u
Make a flashcard with this statement:
Hard c says k before a, o, or u, as in cat, come, cup.
In this list, you see words that have the hard c sound before a, o, and u. Read
the words in the list with your child.

Soft c sound before e, i, and y
Make a flashcard with this statement:
Soft c says s before e, i, and y, as in cell, cite, cyst.
Even though the letter y is a consonant, it behaves like a vowel when it comes
after the letter c. In the word cycle, the y that follows the first c behaves like a
vowel, so c makes the s sound.
Have your child read the words in the following list. Have her observe the
position of the letter c in each word and the letter that follows c. You also see
the versatile letter y pop up as a vowel in a cvc (consonant-vowel-consonant)
pattern. Boy! That y really gets around!

Hard c sound before consonants
Make a flashcard with this statement:
When the letter c comes before a consonant, it makes the k sound, as in
crab, clue, crimp.
But when the letter c is followed by the consonant h, the two letters make the
ch sound, as in church. (Ch is a consonant digraph — a combination of two let-
ters that creates a new sound. I cover those in Chapter 5.)
This next list is full of words in which the letter c makes the k sound because
it precedes a consonant. Have your child read the words in the list.

After your child masters the words in this list, have her read these sentences

The clown danced over the crawling crab.
Will you cease creeping through the crowd?
Hard c at the end of words
Normally the letter c pairs with the letter k at the end of words to make the k
sound (as in back, crack, and sack, for example). But this is the English lan-
guage, so of course you have exceptions! Sometimes the letter c makes the k
sound by itself at the end of words.
Have your child read the following words, focusing on the k sound at the end
of the words. Even though the words are “big” words and have as many as
four syllables, your child shouldn’t have too much difficulty if she reads them
one piece at a time. She should also be able to spell them without any trou-
ble. All but three of the words contain short vowels.

Have your child read the following sentences out loud with expression. The
goal is for her to be able to read the way she speaks.
Is it cold in the Arctic circle?
The use of a noun was a topic for English class.
The dump was a toxic waste place.
Challenging hard and soft c lessons
Before saying good-bye to the letter c, here’s a bit of high-powered practice
with this letter. If your child can get through the following list smoothly, she
has a good grasp of how to pronounce the letter c in different kinds of words.
Have her read aloud the words in the list, correcting her pronunciation if 
necessary.

out all the soft c words. She can also print them on a separate piece of paper.
Magic in the Snow
It was late winter on the plains of Montana. Dad asked me to go out and
check the fence line in the north corner. The sky began to shower me
with white snow that had not been forecast. My horse, Prince, and I
moved in a slow pace with a wind so strong that I could not breathe. We
were covered with snow and became lost in the last hard snow of the
season.
I saw only an endless sea of white, and my face stung from the icy flakes
of snow. How long we were out in this storm, I did not know. My senses
began to dull as the snow kept coming in giant waves of white. The wind
was biting, and it excited my horse to try harder to get to a safe place. As
we plodded along, the horse and I became weaker and weaker. I tried to
smile, but my lips were frozen stiff. I was thinking of the fun we used to
have in the snow. I became very sleepy, but I was aware of Prince falling
to the snowy ground with me along with him. I sunk into the cold, soft
snow. My teeth no longer chattered as I slipped into a dream-like state. As
my senses further dulled, I lay there in a trance, dreaming of the scents of
home-fires, warm food, and a spicy mug of cider. I fell into an unconscious
state with my much-loved Prince beside me.
—From the Journal of Lucy Brice
Back at the Homestead
Lance Painter pulled the barn door closed behind him and faced the fury
of the storm coming in from the north. Pulling the collar of his duster up
around his neck, and pushing the brim of his hat down over his face, he
braced himself for the gusts of wind that almost forced him to the
ground.
Lance had only taken a few steps as he headed back to the ranch house
when he heard the loud barking of his dog, Clancy. He yelled, “Be quiet,
Clancy, come here!” The hound dog pranced toward him, his ears erect,
and his wiry coat covered with snow.
Since the time when Clancy was left on the plains and Lance had found
the lost puppy, the two began a certain kinship. Clancy kept up his con-
stant barking, and Lance’s patience snapped. He was cold, tired, and
hungry. He did not want this excited dog keeping him from the warmth of
his home. Lance struggled through the freezing drifts, but old Clancy kept
it up. The house was now only a short distance away.
196
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 

Finally, it seemed that the dog cried off and went away. As Lance braced
himself against the door of his home and pushed inward, Clancy came
beside him. The dog was chafing at the bit and seemed to be holding
some object between his teeth as he raced back and forth at Lance’s feet.
He jumped up on Lance, and at the same time, the dog shook a red and
yellow neck scarf in his teeth. Lance grabbed it, and as Clancy raced
around him, he understood.
Without waiting one more second, he followed Clancy into the great white
void. He stumbled across the wind-driven snow and stopped where
Clancy led him. On the ground was what appeared to be a human form.
He bent over and felt a pulse on a young girl’s wrist; she was still breath-
ing. He scooped her up into his arms. As he turned to head back to the
ranch, his trusty dog’s ears perked up once more. Clancy saw the girl’s
horse pawing at the snow. He then guided Prince back to the barn, as
Lance, carrying the girl, slowly but surely made it to the ranch house.
Kicking open the door and placing the girl on the rug, Lance pulled the
frozen coat off and discovered Lucy Brice, the daughter of a cowpoke
who worked on his ranch. Although Lucy was quiet and pale in color,
Lance knew that Clancy had saved the young girl’s life that day.

Gauging the Sounds of g
After dealing with the variations of the s and c sounds, you may be feeling like
a phonics genius — or maybe you feel a little gaga. Either way, that’s great
because it’s time for a genial discussion of the letter g!
Like the letter c, the letter g can make two different sounds: the hard g (as in
gum) and the soft g, which sounds like a j (as in age). Guidelines governing
the sound of g aren’t as rigid as those for c, as you discover in the upcoming
sections. But I give you some genuinely good clues to help you recognize
when to say the hard g and when to say the soft g.
Hard g sound before a, o, and u
Make a flashcard with this statement:
A hard g says g before the letters a, o, and u. For example, game, gong,
and gull.
The hard g is spoken because the letter g precedes the letter a, o, or u. Most
kids know the hard g in gum, got, game, gut — words that come early in their
reading experience. Some of the early words they learn, like give and get,
don’t follow this guideline. However, because it applies to so many g words,
the guideline helps.
198
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 

Sometimes g is hard before the letters i and e.
Have your child read this list of words. Emphasize to her that these words
start with the hard g sound and have her notice which vowels follow the
letter g in these words.

The sea gull swooped down to get the fish.
Listening for soft g at the 
beginning of a word
Make a flashcard with this statement:
At the beginning of a word, the letters ge, gi, and gy may make the soft g
sound or the hard g sound. Example include the words get and gem, and
gills and gin.
You see that very few words that begin with gy have a hard g. That means
that the letter g sounds like j in nearly all the gy words that you encounter.
Have your child read this list of words. It’s a sampling of words that have the
j sound at the beginning. Make sure that she pronounces the j sound rather
than the hard g. Point out to her that these words start with the letters ge, gi,
or gy.
gem
Gene
gent
germ
gibe
gin
gist

Have your child read each sentence to herself and then say it out loud with
expression, naturally speaking the words in the sentence:
Nancy and Gene went to the gym.
Gina sneezed and she said, “I must have a germ.”
George was a dapper gent with his hat and cane.
Saying j for ge at the end of a word
Make a flashcard with this statement:
The letters ge say the j sound when they appear at the end of a word, as
in huge.
Have your child read the next list of words. Observe the j sound at the end of
these one-syllable words. Make sure your child says the j sound and doesn’t
attempt to end these words with a hard g sound. The spelling is tricky here,
so have her practice the words not only for decoding but also for spelling.

Tapping into Unusual Spellings
In This Chapter
 Understanding vowel digraphs
 Examining the ie, ea, ou, ew, and ei sounds
 Taking another view of the long u
 Discovering the difficult y pronunciations
S
ome people like to say that English isn’t a phonetic language. More accu-
rately, English isn’t a completely phonetic language. Because about 85
percent of the language generally sounds the way it’s spelled, you can say
that the English language is about 85 percent phonetic.
This chapter delves into the 15 percent of the English language that isn’t pho-
netic. I look at vowel combinations to help your child become a better speller
and reader. This chapter takes you through the troublesome ie (as in field),
ea (as in great), ou (as in cough), ew (as in blew), and the ei (as in eight) vowel
digraphs. You discover how to pronounce these sounds and pick up a few
tricks to help you remember how to spell them.
Introducing Vowel Digraphs
A digraph is a two-letter combination that produces a single sound. Digraphs
can be two vowels walking (as in cried) or they can be exhibited as consonant
digraphs. For example, ch (as in chat), th (as in thud), and sh (as in ship) are
digraphs. Chapter 5 explores consonant digraphs, and in this chapter, I talk
about vowel digraphs.
A vowel digraph is a two-vowel combination that makes a single sound. For
example, vowel digraphs appear in the words eight, bread, tried, and cue.
Vowel digraphs are two vowels that represent one sound, be it a long sound,
as in pain, bean, pie, or cue, or a short sound, as in thread, or another sound,
as in book, oil, toy, or clown.

Third sounds and diphthongs are also digraphs. Look for instances through-
out the book where I discuss the sounds of au, aw, oo, oi, oy, ou, ow (as in
cow), and ew.
Exploring the Vowel Digraph ie
When the letters ie appear together, you can pronounce this digraph in a
couple different ways. Like other vowel digraphs, the vowel digraph ie has
two forms:
 Say the long sound of i, as in lie, died, and pie.
 Say the long sound of e, as in field, piece, and chief.
In this instance, the learner needs to memorize the spellings. The lists and
reading examples in the pages that follow will help your child do that.
The letters ie make the long e sound more than they make the long i sound.
Here are some words to help you remember the two sounds: piece of pie.
Looking at ie and the long sound of i
The following list shows the vowel digraph ie, which says the long sound of i.
This sound occurs in nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Have your child read the
words to give him a sense of what the digraph ie is.

This next list shows the vowel digraph ie, which says the long sound of e.
Have your child read the words in this list after he reads the digraph words in
the previous list. Make sure your child clearly understands the difference
between these ie digraphs. The only way to know the difference between the
digraphs is to memorize them.

When your child is ready to learn vowel digraphs, his reading is quite
advanced. He should be able to grasp these words easily. This spelling has to
be memorized.
To help your child master the ie vowel digraphs, construct sentences
using words from the first two lists in this chapter. Making a phrase 
or sentence with a word or words from both lists is easy. For example, 
a piece of pie contains both types of ie sounds. Encourage your child to
invent his own ie vowel digraph phrases or sentences by using words from
both lists.
Activity: An Unfortunate Miss
To play: Read this limerick and ask your child to point out where the vowel
digraph ie appears. After you read it, ask your child to read it as well.
There was a young lady who tried
A diet of apples and died.

The unfortunate miss
Really perished of this:
Too much cider inside her inside.

Activity: The Boy Who Cried Wolf
To play: Ask your child to read this story and pick out the words with the 
ie digraph and the long e sound. It contains many words with the ie digraphs,
so it’s excellent practice.
Once upon a time the chief of the clan had many sheep. He tried to take
care of them by himself, but it was too much for him. Therefore, he hired
a boy to shepherd them in a nearby field. “Watch the sheep carefully,” he
said to the boy. “Do not let the wolf get any of them.”
Some men were working not far from the field. They told the boy that if a
wolf did appear and try to catch the sheep he should call out loudly,
“Wolf! Wolf!” They said that they would come and help.
The boy watched the sheep every day and tried to shield them from
harm, but no wolf came to take them. It was a great relief for him.
One day, he was so bored that he wanted to play a trick. He cried, “Wolf!
Wolf!” The men came running. The boy laughed and said, “There is no
wolf. I was tricking you.”
“Good grief!” the men cried. They pointed their fingers at the boy and
said, “Do not do that again! You hear?”
After a few days, the boy did it again. Only two men came. “Where is the
wolf?” they said. The boy said again that he was just playing with the
men. The men shrieked, “You must yield to us and stop now!”
However, one day the wolf really came. He grabbed the little lambs in his
teeth and ran away as fast as he could. The boy was in shock, but he did
cry out. “Wolf! Wolf!” he shouted. No one came. Off went the wolf with
lamb dinner in his mouth. The boy never tried to play a joke on the men
after that.
Answer Key: chief, field, shield, relief, grief, shrieked, yield

Looking Farther Into the oo’s
In Chapter 8, you study the third sounds of o and u in two-syllable words. 
You discover that the third sound of o says ∂∂(as in move) and the third
sound of u says ©© (as in bush). These two sounds — ∂∂and ©© — are the
sounds that the oo digraph (also called the third sounds of o and u) make.
When oo appears in words, the letters make either the ∂∂sound, as in zoo,
or the ©© sound, as in book.
Ask your child to read the words in this list. Have him notice the third sound
of u, the ©© sound (as in book) in these words. Refer to the vowel chart on
the cheat sheet at the front of this book. As soon as you finish with this table,
move forward to the next one so that your child can contrast the two sounds
that the letters oo make in words.

Moving Up with Some Great ea Digraphs
It’s hard to believe that the digraph ea makes so many different sounds.
Consider these words that look somewhat alike (because they include the 
letters ea) but sound very different from each other: eat, steak, learn, and
heart.
A good way to remember the sounds of ea is to say, “Eat more bread than
steak.”
The ea pattern words aren’t hard to read or to comprehend. Most of the ea
words you encounter in this chapter are very familiar words — the kind you
read or hear every day. The problem is the spelling! Again, you usually just
have to memorize the spelling of these ea words. You can practice the
spellings in groups of words with like sounds.
Just a little tidbit before you tackle the ea vowel digraphs: Dreamt is the only
English word that ends in the letters mt.
The following list is full of ea digraphs that make the √a sound. As I mention
earlier in this chapter, this digraph follows the guideline that the first vowel,
e, is long and the second vowel, a, is silent. Ask your child to read the words
in the list, write down some of the words, and use some of the words in sen-
tences. Make sure he understands that the letters ea in these words make the
long e sound.

Activity: Story: ea
To play: Read this story to your child and ask him to pick out the ea sounds.
Let him try to read the story as well.
An earnest little lad was in a relative’s wedding.
As he was coming down the aisle, he would take two steps, stop, and turn
to the crowd.
While facing the crowd, he would put his hands up like claws and roar.
So it went, step, step, roar, step, step, roar, all the way down the aisle.
As you can imagine, the crowd was near tears from laughing so heartily
by the time he reached the pulpit.
When asked what he was doing, the child sniffed and said, “I was being
the Ring Bear.”
Answer Key: earnest, near, tears, heartily, Bear

Activity: Zephyr
To play: Read the poem and point to the words heifer and deafer. Ask your
child to read the poem after you for reinforcement of the spelling.
Zephyr
A farmer once called his cow Zephyr,
She seemed such a lovable heifer.
When the farmer drew near,
She kicked on his ear.
And now he is very much deafer.
Cueing You to another View of u
Continuing your adventures in unusual spellings, you now come to the long u
sound. This sound is heard in words with such different spellings as sue, feud,
few, suit, and fuse. Spelling the long u sound in words is the kind of thing that
drives English language students crazy. Never let anyone tell you that the
English language is easy to spell. But, that’s what makes phonics cool,
because it allows the child to be able to spell so many words!
The long u also comes into play in one-syllable words that end in e, such as
cube. In these words (I call them magic e words because the e at the end is
silent), the u makes the ∆sound (Chapter 7 looks in detail at making long
vowels in words with the silent, magic e).
And that’s still not the end of it. After the letters j (jute), r (rule), and l
(Lewis), and the initial blend ch (chew), the letter u makes the third sound 
of o (∂∂). These pages look into the whys and wherefores of decoding the
long sound of u.
Exploring the long sound of u
Table 13-2 lists words that have the long sound of u. As your child reads the
words in this table, make sure that he enunciates the long u sound clearly. If
you follow the guideline that, in a syllable with two vowels the first vowel is
212
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 

usually long and the second is usually silent, these words will be much easier
to pronounce. In ordinary speech, however, most people replace the long
sound of u with the third sound of o (∂∂). This is particularly true when the
letter u follows d (as in due), t (as in tube), or s (as in suit).
Ask your child to read the words in Table 13-2 and apply the long sound of u
to each word. Point out how the silent, magic e words make the same u sound
as the words with the ue, ui, ew, and eu vowel digraphs. After he masters the
words, dictate the words to him in an oral spelling quiz.

Exceptions to the long u
After the letters l, r, and j, and the initial blend ch, the letter u doesn’t make
the long u sound (∆); it makes the third sound of o (∂∂). Listen to the letter u
combinations in these words to see what I mean: blue, rude, Judy, and chew.
Learning how to handle the letter u when it comes after l, r, j, and ch can be
tiresome. The following list makes it a little easier by giving your child some
practice.
213
Chapter 13: Tapping into Unusual Spellings

Ask your child to read the words in this list. Then ask him to spell some of

Weighing In On ei
When it comes to spelling, the first thing that most people learn is “i before e
except after c.” And then they quickly learn that this has a number of excep-
tions. And then they get discouraged.

This little ditty shows just how complicated spelling ei and ie words can be:
It’s i before e, except after c,
Or when it sounds like ≈, as in neighbor and weigh,
Or when it sounds like √ar, as in the word weird,
Unless it sounds like √ek, as in desert sheik!
You can find ei digraphs in many familiar words, most of which have strange
and challenging spellings. This section discusses the vowel digraph ei.
The following list is filled with words containing the ei digraph. These words
are sometimes spelled incorrectly even by seasoned spellers. (By the way,
two of the words in this list, seizure and leisure, make the zh sound. This
sound is explored in Chapter 17.)
Read the words in the list with your child. You can use this list as a reference
when exploring grammar and composition.

Dealing with the Troublesome Letters ou
The hardest digraph of all to master is the ou combination, which is also a
diphthong. The ou combination is two vowels coming together to make a
completely new sound (as in out, pout, and shout). (Diphthongs, when two
vowels come together in one syllable and make one double vowel sound, are
explained in Chapter 9.) The letters ou represent no fewer than seven differ-
ent sounds:
 The /ou/ sound, as in out and about.
 The ∂sound, as in soul and though.
 The © sound, as in cough and ought.
 The ± sound, as in trouble and country.
 The third sound of o, as in soup and group.
 The third sound of u, as in could and your.
 The ur sound, as in courage and nourish.
This section looks into these troublesome ou words. Knowing the meanings
of these words and using a tape recorder to reinforce the sounds is of great
help with the ou words. Make a tape or CD of the words so your child can
hear the sounds for reinforcement.
By the way, young readers usually find these three ou words word the most
confusing: though, thought, and through.
Table 13-3 presents all six variations of the ou diphthong. Ask your child to
take crack at reading the words in this table. This table also makes a nice 
reference.

Looking at helpful vowel sound comparisons
The table in this sidebar is a reference table
designed to improve your child’s spelling and
decoding skills. Notice some spelling patterns
in this table:
 Columns 1 and 2 show a basic recap of the
vowel digraph ow (blow) as seen in Chapter
7, and the diphthong ow (now) as seen in
Chapter 9.
 In columns 3 and 4, when ge (cage) is pre-
ceded by a vowel, you hear the long vowel
sound; when the vowel is followed by dge
(ledge), you hear the short vowel sound.
 Columns 5 and 6 also follow a spelling pattern.
This is the sixth syllable type in the English
language, the consonant le syllable. When
there is one consonant before le (as in rifle),
the preceding vowel is long; when there are
two consonants preceding the letters le(as in
brittle), the vowel is short (the word triple is
one of very few exceptions to this guideline).
Give your child extra help with the table. Just
being able to read these words is sufficient. If
you care to, select some of the vowel patterns
in the table and develop them with your child.

vowel sound the letter y makes in words.
Read the words in Table 13-4 with your child, keeping in mind that the letter 
y creates all kinds of difficulties where reading is concerned. You can treat

Exploring Some Miscellaneous
Homophones
Because (if you’re reading the chapters in order) you’re exploring different
kinds of spellings and groupings of words, this is a good time to take a brief
detour and look at some words that sound the same, but are spelled differ-
ently. A homophone is a word that’s pronounced the same as another word
but has a different spelling and meaning. For example, carat, caret, and carrot
are homophones. Following is an assorted group of homophones that you
can ask your child to read and memorize, place in a sentence, and spell out.
These homophones underscore some of the vowel digraphs and diphthongs

Digging Deeper into Prefixes 
and Suffixes
In This Chapter
 Understanding prefixes, suffixes, and word roots
 Discovering prefixes and how they modify words’ meaning
 Exploring how suffixes change the meaning of words
T
his chapter explores the use of roots or root words as units of meaning.
You can call it a word root, a root word, or you can use the expression
base word. Prefixes and suffixes (or, collectively, affixes) are placed before
and after a root word to create a new word. Prefixes tend to change the mean-
ing of words. Suffixes tend to make a word a different part of speech, change
the meaning, and change the tense, among other things. A child who under-
stands what root words are and how they can be altered by prefixes and suf-
fixes can greatly improve her aptitude for reading and spelling. She can
increase her vocabulary by leaps and bounds. The goal of this chapter is 
for your child to instantly recognize root words, prefixes, and suffixes while
reading.
In this chapter, you jump headlong into prefixes and suffixes. The lessons
start simply with an exploration of simple prefixes and suffixes, and then you
go on to the advanced variety. Some of the words I present in this chapter
may be too advanced for your child. Not to worry! The idea here is for your
child to get a solid grasp of what prefixes and suffixes are. She can increase
her vocabulary and spelling skills mightily in this chapter by mastering pre-
fixes and suffixes.

Understanding Roots
To understand what prefixes and suffixes are, you need to know what a root
is. The root is the main part of the word that contains the basic meaning, and
you can add affixes to it to create related words. It’s also the form of the word
after removing any or all prefixes and suffixes from the word. Prefixes and suf-
fixes change the meaning of the root to which they’re attached. Generally
speaking, prefixes don’t usually change the spelling of the root word; how-
ever, the spelling of a root word can change when a suffix is added, as in the
word inspiration. Here are some simple definitions:
 A root word is a word to which you can add affixes to create related
words (such as hemi-sphere or co-author)
 A suffix is a word part that you can add to the end of a root word (such
as dark-ness)
 A prefix is a word part that you can add to the beginning of a root word
to create a new meaning (such as re-gain or in-complete)

Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 
A brief history of English
The English language has many fathers and
mothers, but its primary parents are German and
Latin. And because the Greek language is part of
Latin’s heritage, English has inherited many
Greek words and root words by way of Latin.
Although the Latin-speaking Romans con-
quered England in 55 B.C. under Julius Caesar
and remained in England for the next 450 years,
the native population didn’t adopt Latin. They
spoke a Celtic language similar to modern-day
Welsh. That changed in the fifth century, how-
ever, when Germanic tribes — the Angles,
Saxons, and Jutes — arrived in England. These
settlers brought German to the island and
established the German basis of the English lan-
guage. If you’ve ever wondered why some
words and expressions are similar in German
and English (guten morgen and good morning,
for example), look to the Angles, Saxons, and
Jutes for the answer. Over the centuries, the
German dialects they brought to England from
the European continent coalesced into a lan-
guage now called Old English.
In 1066, French-speaking Normans conquered
England, and for the next 300 years England had
two languages, French and Old English. The
ruling-class Normans spoke French and their
underlings spoke Old English, but over time the
languages merged to form the English lan-
guage. Because French draws heavily from
Latin, Latin roots found their way into this new
English language through its French heritage.
Over the centuries, English has been enriched
by words from many languages. Wherever the
English established colonies, they borrowed
words from native speakers. For example,
shampoo came from India, ketchup from China,
and moccasin from the Iroquois. Immigration to
the United States also added many words to
English, as the immigrants contributed their
words to the English language. For example,
Yiddish gave English-speakers chutzpah, Yoruba
gave goober, and Tagalog gave boondocks. The
foundation of English, however, is in German
and Latin.

The roots of many words in the English language originate in a parent lan-
guage of English, such as Greek, Latin, or German. You can find the Latin
word trudere, for example, in several English words. Trudere in Latin means
“to thrust.” From this word comes the English words intrude (to thrust in
without invitation), extrude (to thrust something out), and protrude (to stick
out). When you add the prefixes in, ex, and pro in front of the root trude, you
get different words with slightly different meanings.
Suffixes appear at the end of word roots; sometimes they change the spelling
as well as the meaning of the root. Take the word credible, for example. The
Latin root word of incredible is credo, and the base word creed is shortened

Discovering word roots can be easy, using some basic prefixes. Remember
that they come before the root words and, in this exercise, your child can
play with relative ease.

Profiling Prefixes and Suffixes
The spelling of prefixes and suffixes usually follows normal phonics patterns.
And if you and your child looked at the simple suffixes ing, ed, and er in
Chapter 11, you have some understanding of suffixes. Pronouncing words
with prefixes and suffixes is usually just a matter of recognizing the word root
and knowing which syllable to stress.
The following sections offer advice and exercises for exploring roots, pre-
fixes, and suffixes.
Changing roots by adding prefixes
The following list demonstrates how words can change meanings when you
add prefixes to them. This list presents simple, two-syllable words in which
224
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 

the first syllable is the prefix. Ask your child to read the words in the list. Ask
her the meaning of the word root and what she thinks each prefix means.
Later in this chapter, you encounter these simple prefixes again, along with
more advanced prefixes.

Have your child read the following sentences for practice. Ask her to read
them silently to herself first, and then read them out loud with expression to
you, naturally speaking the words in the sentence. The goal is for her to be
able to read the way she speaks.
It is a mistake to consult or invite him.
Perhaps he will admit the entire mistake.
They prefer to retrace their steps.

It’s absolutely amazing how prefixes change the meaning of words, especially
the prefixes re (back again), un (express the contrary), a (away from), and de
(out of). Table 14-1 shows you what several different prefixes mean and how
you can attach them to different roots. Most of the words in this table won’t
be familiar to your child. That’s okay, because they’ll give her excellent prac-
tice in decoding and spelling.

Changing roots by adding suffixes
A suffix is an addition to the end of a word root that modifies the word’s
meaning. A suffix can also serve a grammatical function. It can indicate what
228
Part III: Moving Beyond the Phonics Basics 

part of speech — a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb — a word belongs to.
This section looks into suffixes and helps your child understand what they
are and how they change words’ meanings.
This next list presents your child with words that contain simple, one-syllable
suffixes. By examining the words in the table, she can find out how adding a
few letters to the end of a word root changes the word’s meaning. Ask her to
read the list carefully and tell you the meaning of the word roots and the suf-
fixes. She may require some help from you. At this point, you want your child
to identify suffixes. Later in this chapter, you look more closely at advanced
suffixes.

Activity: The Grateful Swan
Preparation: Make a copy of the following story. Your child needs a pencil or
crayon.
To play: Ask your child to read the story and circle the suffix words.
One day a poor peddler was returning to his home after a hard day’s
work. He was very tired, and his pack was heavy.
Suddenly he heard something go flippety-flop. It sounded like a bird with
large wings. He looked up in the air, but could see nothing. He looked
north and south, east and west, but not a bird was in sight.
His pack seemed to grow heavier and heavier, and by the time he reached
his little home he was so tired that he could scarcely walk.
As his wife came to help him loosen the straps that held the pack on his
back, she cried, “Oh, John, where did you get this beautiful swan?”
231
Chapter 14: Digging Deeper into Prefixes and Suffixes

But the man answered, “What swan?”
“Why, sitting right on top of your pack is the loveliest swan I have ever
seen,” said the good woman.
“That is what I heard go flippety-flop,” said John, “and no wonder my
pack felt very heavy today.”
“Her wings are like lilies, and her beak is like a rose,” said the wife, “but
dear me, the poor thing has a broken leg.”
“I have some bandages in my pack,” said John. “I will get some of them,
and we will fix the leg in no time. But what shall we use for splints?”
“Oh, I know just the thing,” said the wife. And she ran to the shelf and got
her fan and broke it into splints.
The good man and his wife bound up the broken leg very carefully, and
then they gave the swan part of their supper.
The swan’s leg kept getting better, ’til before long it was as well and
strong as ever.
Still the swan stayed on with the peddler and his wife, and they were very
happy together all summer. But when the grass grew brown and the
leaves fell from the trees, John said, “Wife, the birds are all going south
for the winter. Before long our swan will leave us and we may never see
her again.”
And one day after this the swan lifted her snowy wings and sailed away
toward the south.
The peddler and his wife stood with tears in their eyes, and watched her
’til all they could see was a tiny speck.
The winter was long and they were very lonesome for the swan. Finally,
the snow was all gone, the leaves were coming out on the branches, and
the good wife started making her garden.
One day she saw in the distance a speck as white as snow. Nearer, and
nearer it came, right into her garden.
“Oh John,” she cried, “here is our swan. Far from the south she has come,
but what is that shining in her mouth?”
“A diamond, as sure as I live,” cried John.
The swan came nearer and walked up to the woman and dropped the
lovely sparkling diamond into her apron.
And ever after that the swan flew away with the other birds in the fall, but
each spring came back to spend the summer with the peddler and his
wife. And every time that she came back she brought the good woman
some wonderful gift from the south.

Activity: Poem: Two Little Kittens
Preparation: You need the following poem. Your child needs a pencil and
piece of paper.
To play: Ask your child to read the poem and write down the words with 
suffixes.
Two Little Kittens
Two little kittens, one stormy night,
Began to quarrel, and then to fight;
One had a mouse, the other had none,
And that’s the way the quarrel begun.
“I’ll have that mouse,” said the biggest cat;
“You’ll have that mouse? We’ll see about that!”
“I will have that mouse,” said the eldest son;
“You shan’t have the mouse,” said the little one.
I told you before ’twas a stormy night
When these two little kittens began to fight;
The old woman seized her sweeping broom,
And swept the two kittens right out of the room.
The ground was covered with frost and snow,
And the two little kittens had nowhere to go;
So they laid them down on the mat at the door,
While the old woman finished sweeping the floor.
Then they crept in, as quiet as mice,
All wet with the snow, and cold as ice,
For they found it was better, that stormy night,
To lie down and sleep than to quarrel and fight.

Some trivial trivia
Only four words in the English language end in
the suffix ous with a d preceding it. Those words
are tremendous, horrendous, stupendous,
and hazardous. In these words, the d sound had
to be added to the ous suffix for pronunciation
purposes.
Here’s another tidbit for you: Only two words in
the English language are spelled with all five
vowels in alphabetical order. Those words are
abstemious and facetious.

Tackling the
Trickier Side 
of Phonics

In this part . . .
I
n these chapters, I introduce you and your child to
some advanced phonics lessons. Here, you discover
the schwa — what it means and what it does to spelling
and pronunciation. You and your child also encounter
the silent elements in words like lamb, sign, or hymn.
Finally, I present the complexities of x and zh and their
many sounds. It’s tricky stuff, but well worth mastering for
sharp reading skills.

t’s there, even though it really isn’t meant to be. It’s lurking in multisyllable
words, bridging consonants, and making vowels disappear. What is this
mischievous critter? It’s called the schwa, and it makes a quick uh sound.
You hear the schwa in the first syllable of cadet and the second syllable of
bridal. Instead of making the short or long a sound, you say the a quickly so
that it sounds like uh, or the short u sound. If you pronounce each syllable in
a multisyllable word formally and distinctly, people may think you’re putting
on airs. Or they may think you’re a little wacky. The schwa, or uh sound, pre-
vents you from sliding sounds together too quickly.
Interestingly, Americans, the British, Canadians, and Aussies — English
speakers all — have all been known to place the accent schwa on a different
syllable in the same exact word.
This chapter introduces your child to the mischievous schwa sound. It
explores how to pronounce the schwa sound in different words, how to rec-
ognize where a schwa sound appears, and how to read the schwa symbol in a
dictionary. This chapter gives your child plenty of practice with the schwa
concept.

Introducing Your Child to the Schwa
You see the schwa symbol in dictionaries as an upside-down e, like this: ‡.
When you see the schwa symbol, you know not to use the short or long
vowel sound — you just say uh. The idea may sound crazy, but the schwa 
can take the place of every single vowel — a, e, i, o, and u. Just listen to the
schwas in these words: local, ago, sudden, robin, bottom, and circus. Although
the vowel is different, the sound is the same — a schwa.
The schwa symbol looks like an upside-down and backward e, which creates
a problem when you write the symbol on a piece of paper and you’re sitting
across the table from your child. Your child may think that you’re writing the
letter e rather than the schwa. To prevent this problem from occurring, make
sure you’re sitting next to your child instead of across from him when you
write the schwa.
Introduce your child to the schwa by following these steps:
1. Write the schwa symbol and say, “This is a schwa.”
2. Ask your child to say the word “schwa.”
3. Ask him to write the symbol on his own sheet of paper.
4. Ask your child to repeat a word with a schwa in it (like bottom).
5. Tell him to spell the word on paper, or write it down for him as he
says it.
6. Ask him to say cadet (or whatever schwa word you chose) slowly, and
catch him in the middle of the uh.
Explain to him why he’s making the schwa sound rather than the short
or long vowel sound. Tell him that the schwa keeps him from running
the sounds in the word together.
238
Part IV: Tackling the Trickier Side of Phonics 
The origin of the schwa
The word schwa is taken from the Hebrew word
sewa, meaning nought. It was used to indicate
the schwa vowel sound as well as the complete
absence of a vowel sound. The schwa basically
meant “there is no vowel sound.” It has evolved
to mean that the unstressed syllable has the
sound of a quick uh, or short u.

As you get into the more difficult words in this book, take these steps to help
your child remember his spellings:
 Exaggerate vowels the first time you say a word. For example, in the
word important, exaggerate the short sound of a in the third syllable the
first time you say it.
 The second time you say the word, use the correct unaccented a so that
your child hears the schwa.
Exploring the Schwa-Syllable Connection
Fortunately for you and your child, the English language has rigid guidelines
as to when a schwa shows up in a word. One-syllable words? Never. You find
the schwa only in multisyllable words.
Here are the facts about where the schwa shows up:
 Schwas appear only in multisyllable words.
 Schwas never appear on the accented syllable.
 Schwas rarely appear in place of a long vowel sound.
 Almost every multisyllable word contains at least one schwa.
 Whenever you can cross out a vowel without changing the pronuncia-
tion, that vowel is probably a schwa.
Try this exercise to help your child understand what a schwa is and how the
schwa symbol appears in dictionaries:
1. Flip open your dictionary, show your child where the schwa appears
in words, and ask him to look up a few one-syllable words in the 
dictionary.
239
Chapter 15: Schwinging with Schwa: Finding the Quick uh Sound
Schwa’s rise to phonetic fame
In the past, dictionaries typically assigned eight
different sounds to a, and almost as many to the
other vowels. To illustrate how complicated
these vowel assignments were, you may remem-
ber the movie My Fair Lady (if you haven’t seen it,
shame on you). In one scene, Professor Higgins
appears with hundreds of symbols surrounding
him that indicate the hundreds of sounds that the
five vowels make. Today, the schwa replaces a
lot of these sounds and symbols. Despite how it
shows up in the dictionary, the schwa sounds
slightly different everywhere you go, and in some
regions of the United States, words even get an
extra schwa. In the southern United States, for
example, power is pronounced powuh.

Point out that none of these words has a schwa. Tell him that the schwa
doesn’t appear because only words with two or more syllables have a
schwa.
2. Have him look up a few two-syllable words that use the schwa (check
out Table 15-1, later in this chapter, for a list of some of these words).
Point out that the schwa never appears in syllables that have the accent
mark on them. (In your travels through the dictionary, your child may
find more than one schwa in a single multisyllable word. Don’t worry
about it for now. By the time your child reaches the advanced reading
stage, he will understand what the schwa is and how it affects pronun-
ciation. I see no advantage in overstating the presence of schwas at
this time.)
Some children have a hard time understanding the difference between the
schwa sound and the short u. To make the distinction clear, write down the
word rumpus. Say the word slowly as you point to the letters, but put the
accent on both syllables and let your child hear you say the short u sound in
both syllables. Then say the word correctly, letting him hear the schwa at the
tail end of the word.
Getting Acquainted with Schwa Words
Table 15-1 lists some common words that include the schwa sound. Read the
words in the table with your child, sounding out the vowels and encouraging
him to read, recite, and remember. Your child can get a good start seeing and
hearing the schwa by reading the words in this table. Make sure your child
hears the quick uh sound in the words.

Have your child read these sentences for practice. The goal is for him to be
able to read as he would speak, so you want him to read each sentence to
himself and then say it out loud with expression, naturally speaking the
schwa sound where it appears.

He is alone in the bottom of the vessel.
They went away to the cabin near Boston.
Activity: Flipping and Flashing Schwa Cards
Preparation: Make a set of diacritical mark flashcards that include the schwa
symbol (upside-down and backward e) and the words in Table 15-1.
To play: Use the flashcards in the following script:
1. Say, “Here’s a flashcard with the schwa symbol.”
2. Show the learner the flashcard.
3. Say, “This upside-down e is a symbol for a schwa. The schwa means a
quick uh sound. It’s close to a short u, as in up. But the tone of this
sound is short and unstressed — a short-short u.”
4. Hold the schwa card, and ask your child to repeat: “Uh, the schwa
says uh.”
5. Show the flashcards with the words from Table 15-1 to the learner.
As you page through the flashcards, ask your child, “Which letter in this
word makes the schwa sound?”
To reinforce the schwa sound, add words like rumpus and circus to the dia-
critical mark cards. Make sure your child recognizes the schwa and how it
sounds in the words.

Activity: Seeking Schwas in Poetry
Preparation: You need this poem and a pencil.
To play: Have your child read the following poem and circle the schwa sylla-
bles. Or read the poem to him, and tell him to shout “schwa” at the appropri-
ate times.
My Snowball Pal
I made myself a snowball
As perfect as it could be.
I wanted to keep it as a pet
And allowed it to sleep with me.
I made it purple pajamas
And a cushion for its head.
Then last night it ran away
But first it wet the bed!

Delving into Some Harder Schwa Words
You’ve been warned: The words in Table 15-2 are more difficult than those in
Table 15-1. Remember that no matter which of the five vowels (a, e, i, o, or u)
is in a word, the schwa sound is always pronounced like the u in circus. Get
the feel of the accented syllable by tapping softly. If you want to, you can ask
your child to make up sentences with some of these words.

Mr. Schwing’s Schwa
Mr. Schwing lived in a village far, far away. Every day he would amuse
himself by reading the local paper. One day, he was sitting alone in his
kitchen reading the paper in his denim suit while eating a muffin when an
article caught his eye.
There was going to be a big contest at the carnival this year! The contest
was for all of the local artists in the village. All of the contestants would
have to paint a picture of a schwa. The winner would receive a one-night
stay at the mayor’s cabin and a golden parrot statue!
Mr. Schwing had been a pupil a few years ago at the Cadet Art School. He
thought this contest would be a fun challenge, so he got to work right
away on the picture of his inverted e.
He got out his easel, carbon pencils, and all of his paints. His paintbrush
caressed the canvas, and it wasn’t long before he had a masterpiece. The
schwa was so colorful it looked like it belonged in a floral shop.
On the day of the carnival, people were rushing here and there to get
their paintings ready to be judged in the big contest. When the judging
began, Mr. Schwing felt his body begin to stiffen. He was so nervous!
When the judges came to his painting, a sudden look of amazement came
over their faces. The judges huddled together, and then one of them
walked up to the podium and declared Mr. Schwing the winner of the
Schwa Painting Contest! Mr. Schwing got a sudden rush of excitement!
The judge asked him to come receive his prizes. Mr. Schwing walked
away that day the happiest man in the village.
Mr. Schwing hung his special schwa painting in his house where he could
look at it proudly every day. He never would have fathomed that he could
have made such a beautiful work of art.

Activity: Schwas for Two
To play: This activity is great for two kids together. Have one child read the
following story to the other child, who should clap every time he hears a
schwa. Have the kids take turns reading and clapping. Or you can read the
story to one child and have him clap at the schwas.
Abraham Lincoln in the Early Years
In a small, poor cabin in the wilds of Kentucky a little boy was born. He
was named after his grandfather, Abraham Lincoln. Abe knew very little
about his first home, because his father moved the family to a new farm
when he was five.
For a smart boy like Abe, the new place was the beginning of many great
adventures. The woods were full of birds and wild animals. Scenic ravines
with running water cut through the land. The water was so clear you
could see the pebbles at the bottom. The largest stream was called 
Knob Creek.
In those days when a boy was five, he was old enough to work and help
his mother and father. Young Abe hauled wood, picked berries, and
helped with the planting. Those were just a few of his many jobs.
Life on the farm was not all work though. There was some fun and adven-
ture. Abe and his sister, Sarah, had schoolmates that they visited when
school was not in session.
One Sunday, Abe and some friends were out looking for partridges. They
were walking along Knob Creek. It was spring and the water was very
high. Abe tried to walk a log and fell in the water. Abe’s playmate, Austin,
seized a stick, ran to Abe and extended it over the water. Abe grabbed the
stick and Austin saved his life. Neither had ever learned to swim.
Most of the education of a pioneer was to learn the lessons of nature.
They followed the tracks of animals, listened to birdcalls, and probably
ran from many real or imaginary bears. 
Even though Abe and his sister did not have a lot of formal schooling,
Tom and Nancy Lincoln wanted their children to know more than they
did. The parents would sit on the doorstep and tell the children all the
stories they knew. There would be stories from the Bible, of their own
lives, and of the lives of all their ancestors. The Lincolns had a simple life
of adventure and hardship, but a very interesting one.

Explaining English 
Exceptions
In This Chapter
 Looking at silent letters
 Examining unusual diphthongs and digraphs
 Chasing down suspect “outlaw” words
 Looking at unusual consonant digraphs
 Recognizing French and Greek ch sounds
A
ll rules have exceptions, which is why you’ve probably heard the
expression, “The exception that proves the rule.”
This exceptional chapter is about exceptions — it’s about spelling patterns
and letter combinations that defy the guidelines and patterns laid down in
the previous chapters of this book. Approximately 85 percent of English
words are phonetic; this chapter looks at the other 15 percent.
This chapter deals with silent consonants as in the word hymn and gnome.
You see and learn words that contain unusual pronunciations, such as marry
and very, and vowels appearing together that make their sounds separately
like trio and giant. I look at words that don’t follow the guidelines, such as bolt
and ton. And this chapter enlightens you about French and Greek words that
Americans use, which makes you feel like a scholar.
Many of these words are “outlaws” and need to be memorized. But don’t
despair — most of them are at least partially phonetic. And look at it this
way: The fact that these words don’t follow standard guidelines makes them

stick in your child’s mind, which makes them easier to remember. I also use
jokes, stories, and poetry that I hope will edify and hone your child’s love for
literature and laughter.
Dealing with Silent Letters
A silent letter is just what it sounds like: a letter that appears in a word even
though you can’t hear the sound of the letter when you say the word. When
you write the word, however, the silent letter calls for the correct spelling,
and that’s where learning how to decode and spell words with silent letters
gets dicey. Sorry folks, but no definite guidelines apply in regard to silent let-
ters. All you can do is remember how to recognize silent letter patterns and,
in some cases, memorize them. The following pages explain how to do that.
A different kind of consonant digraph
Two consonants joined together that make a single sound are called a 
consonant digraph, as you find out in Chapter 5. Consonant digraphs
include the letter combinations ch, th, ng, and nk.
When a silent letter appears as one of the letters in a consonant digraph, 
it’s still considered a consonant digraph. In this different kind of consonant
digraph, one of the letters is silent, and the other one makes its normal 
sound — the normal sound your child has already learned. Silent letter 
consonant digraphs are simple to read but a royal pain to spell.
The five most common silent consonant digraphs are:
 wr (as in write)
 kn (as in know)
 gn (as in gnaw)
 mb (as in dumb)
 mn (as in hymn)
250
Part IV: Tackling the Trickier Side of Phonics 

Table 16-1 lists some silent-letter consonant digraphs in these five groups.
Ask your child to read the words in the table. Point out to your child that
each digraph makes a sound that she already knows.

the story. After you discuss it with her, ask her to read the story.
Moms Aren’t Always Right
A little girl in first grade was doing very well, especially in spelling.
One day she came home with new words to study for an upcoming test
and she asked her mother to help.
They came to the word “knit” and her mother asked her to spell it. She
said, “n-i-t.” Her mother said, “No, try again.” She said, very slowly, “n-i-t.”
252
Part IV: Tackling the Trickier Side of Phonics 

Her mother said, “Now, honey, I know you know how to spell this word.
Try again.” Very aggravated and very slowly, as if her mother was just not
getting the whole picture, she spelled, “n-i-t!”
Finally, her mother told her that the correct spelling was k-n-i-t. The little
girl looked at her mother, put her hands on her hips and said, “Mom! The
k is silent!”
Activity: Poems: Silent Letter Consonant Digraphs
To play: Have your child read the following poems. Notice the silent letter in
the words autumn and lambs.
Autumn Fires
In the other gardens
And all up the vale,
From the autumn bonfires
See the smoke trail!
Pleasant summer over
And all the summer flowers,
The red fire blazes,
The gray smoke towers.
Sing a song of seasons!
Something bright in all!
Flowers in the summer,
Fires in the fall!

Window robins, winter rooks,
And the picture storybooks.
Water now is turned to stone
Nurse and I can walk upon;
Still we find the flowing brooks
In the picture storybooks.
All the pretty things put by,
Wait upon the children’s eye,
Lambs and shepherds, trees and crooks,
In the picture storybooks.
We may see how all things are
Seas and cities, near and far,
And the flying fairies’ looks,
In the picture storybooks.
How am I to sing your praise,
Happy chimney corner days,
Sitting safe in nursery nooks,
Reading picture storybooks?

Discovering Exceptions to Standard
Murmur Diphthongs
Chapter 9 explains that murmur diphthongs make the er sound and are typi-
cally spelled with these letter combinations: ur, ir, and er. These r-controlled
murmur diphthongs are simple to read but can be difficult to spell. Some
words look like murmur diphthongs, but it would be a great mistake to read
or pronounce them that way. The vowel-consonant combinations in the
words in the upcoming list may appear to be murmur diphthongs that make
256
Part IV: Tackling the Trickier Side of Phonics 

the er sound but, in fact, they don’t make that sound. These words are excep-
tions. In these diphthongs, you hear the vowel sound and the consonant
sound separately.
Almost all murmur diphthong exception words make a short-vowel sound. In
this list, for example, you can hear the short vowels in carry, berry, mirror,
and sorry. Only two exceptions occur: Florida and forest have both sounds
(the or diphthong and the short o), depending upon what part of the country
you live in. Also, the pronunciation of some of these exceptions have mutated
in the last century.
Ask your child to read the words in this list carefully. Point out the funny
spellings and caution your child against thinking that these words sound like
murmur diphthongs.

When Joined Vowels Aren’t Digraphs
Two vowels that appear one after the other don’t necessarily make a vowel
digraph. When vowels appear together in some words, they may actually
form two separate syllables. For example, the vowels in the words trial, doer,
and lion form the dividing point between one syllable and the next. The vowel
combinations in these words clearly aren’t digraphs because the vowels
don’t run together to form a continuous sound. In these words, each vowel
makes its own sound.
This next list is full of words in which two vowels that aren’t digraphs appear
in succession. Many of the words in this list are borrowed from other lan-
guages. The odd spelling was retained when the words came into common
use. Reading and decoding these words is harder for nonnative speakers than
it is for native English speakers.
Have your child read the words in this list, paying special attention to where
syllables break in these words.

Joey and Noah took their violins to the theater.
Maria placed her piano manual on the sofa.
Exceptions to Long-Vowel Guidelines
In Chapter 8, I tell you that if a word or syllable has only one vowel, expect it
to be a short sound. If a word or syllable has two vowels, count on the first
vowel being long and the second one being silent. Americans adopted this
approach from “olde” England. As you look at the word olde, you can see that
the magic e is silent — because it adheres to the long-vowel guideline.
Every word in Table 16-3 has a long-vowel sound. These words are exceptions
to the long-vowel guideline; no second vowel or magic e is present in these
words, yet they still make the long-vowel sound. Perhaps those “olde” ances-
tors took the silent e off these words.

Column by column, have your child read the words in Table 16-3. Make sure
she pronounces the long-vowel sounds in these words. After she’s finished,
have her spell the words. Because many of these words are in the same word
family, you can quiz her in a rhyming fashion after she writes the first word in
the pattern on a separate piece of paper. After she writes the words down,
she can read them back to you.

her to pick out the words that are exceptions to the long-vowel guideline.
One day, a sweet little child named Melanie, who was five years old, went
to visit her kind grandmother.
As they sat at the table having tea and rolls, Melanie asked Grandma how
old she was. Granny replied that she was so old that she didn’t remember
anymore.

Words in Which Every o Is a Short u
Take a close look at the words in the next list. In each word, the o makes the
short sound of u (examples include mother, won, and above). Mysterious, no?
Some of the words in the list are common words that your child learned a
long time ago. Some, however, like slovenly and covetous, are brand new. It
doesn’t hurt anyone to learn words that they won’t use often in everyday
speech. Ask your child to read the words and to be aware of the short u
sound in each word.

Arresting the Outlaw Words
The words in the next list follow no guidelines. I call them “outlaw words”
because they aren’t subject to strict phonics guidelines. At least half of the
words in the list will be familiar to your child from early reading, but you
have to introduce these words to your child as sight words. Most of the
words are partially phonetic, and yet some are real outlaw words with pretty
wild spelling. I think the i and y are interesting. You sound out the vowel i as
the consonant y in onion, and the consonant y as a vowel in bury.

Ask your child to read the words in the list and take a spelling quiz, which
you can dictate to her. For the quiz, start with the words that she reads well
to reinforce the lesson and what she already knows. Then slowly start push-

Activity: Story: Sacágawea
To play: Ask your child to read this time-honored story about a great 
Native American. After she finishes, have her pick out the words that are
exceptions — the “outlaw words” — and write them on a piece of paper.
Sacágawea
Sacágawea (sa-cá-ga-we-a), a child of the Shoshones, who lived west of
the Bitter Root Mountains in what is now Idaho, was born more than two
hundred years ago. She was a strong beautiful Indian girl, loved by all the
people of her tribe for her quick understanding and gentle, willing kind-
ness. She was the most fleet of foot among the children of the village who
raced along the shores of the rolling Snake River and none surpassed her
in courage and endurance on the long treks through the narrow mountain
gorges or trackless forests to the water. No one, not even the wise medi-
cine men, ever dreamed that this heroic daughter of the wild Shoshones
was to have a great part in giving to America a domain vast and rich
beyond the desires of covetous kings. She was carried off to the land of
the Dakotas by a warring band of Indians, sold as a slave, and later mar-
ried to a Frenchman who was part Indian. Although well treated by her
adopted tribe, she longed to see her people beyond the Bitter Root
Mountains.
In a period after 1804, the Lewis and Clark expedition, in sore need of a
guide and interpreter, reached the Minnetaree tribes and camped with
them for the winter. The leaders had undertaken the daring and haz-
ardous tasks of blazing a trail through an unexplored, mountainous
wilderness that was beset with hostile Indians. They sought a guide who
knew the way to the Bitter Root Mountains and the land beyond to the
Pacific. They sought one who would help them make friends with the 
various tribes, for their errand was a peaceful one.
Sacágawea, with her newborn child wrapped in a buffalo robe and strapped
to her back, accompanied the expedition safely. They went on a journey
covering many miles to the land of her own people and to the great empire
beyond.
This story has been written by many and continues to capture the ideals
and imagination of people of all ages. The grateful people of several states
remember Sacágawea’s great service. People named a lofty peak in the
mountains after her. It overlooks the home of her childhood. In Portland,
Oregon, there is a statue showing the young Indian woman with her baby
son on her back as she steps forward pointing the way west.

Activity: Joke: Poodle Snobbery
To play: Read this joke to your child, spelling out of the names of the dogs.
It’s probably beyond her knowledge, but she’ll laugh when you explain it.
Poodle Snobbery
Two well-groomed French poodles were prancing about their estate and
looked down the driveway to see a bedraggled little mutt standing there.
Having superb manners and being kind, they went to the gate. One said,
“Hi! My name is FiFi, F-i-F-i.” The other poodle said, “Hello! My name
is MiMi, M-i-M-i.” The sorry looking little dog of questionable lineage
answered in a well-bred accent, “Hello, my name is Phydeaux, 
P-h-y-d-e-a-u-x.”
Discovering Special Consonant Digraphs
A digraph is a pair of letters that represents a single speech sound. I discuss
digraphs in detail in Chapter 5, but this section deals with two special conso-
nant digraphs: ph and gh. Learning these digraphs requires study on your
child’s part. These digraphs are downright odd to anyone who isn’t accus-
tomed to seeing them in the course of reading. Check out this list for more
information:
 The consonant digraph ph is a basic consonant digraph in the strictest
sense of the word. The two letters make a new sound, f.
 The consonant digraph gh makes several different sounds, including the
following:
• When gh starts a word, it always makes the sound of a g (as in
ghost).
• When gh is followed by a t (as in thought), it’s always silent.
• The gh can also be silent when it isn’t followed by a t (as in though).
• The gh can make the sound of f (as in cough).
265
Chapter 16: Explaining English Exceptions

Table 16-4 lists common ph and gh words that are hard to spell. Memorizing
these words is the best way to learn how to spell them correctly. After your
child catches on to the look and sound of ph or gh within these words, spelling
them is a cinch. In order to make these words easier to apply in reading and
spelling, mark this page with a bookmark or sticky note, and use Table 16-4 as
a reference.
Teach your child about the sound of f for ph and the sound of g for gh. Explain
that ph and gh are consonant digraphs just like sh, ch, th, wh, ng, and nk (refer
to Chapter 5). Also, ask her to notice the difference between the different
sounds of gh. Then she’s ready to read the words in Table 16-4 and copy
some of the more recognizable words on a piece of paper.

To play: Ask your child to read this poem and choose four exceptional ph or
gh words from the lesson.
Daylight and Moonlight
In broad daylight, and at noon,
Yesterday I saw the moon
Sailing high, but faint and white,
As a schoolboy’s paper kite.
In broad daylight, yesterday,
I read a poet’s mystic lay;
And it seemed to me at most
As a phantom, or a ghost.
But at length the feverish day
Like a passion died away,
And the night, serene and still,
Fell on village, vale, and hill.
Then the moon, in all her pride,
Like a spirit glorified,
Filled and overflowed the night
With revelations of her light.
—Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

Exploring Words with the French 
and Greek ch Sounds
Just when you become accustomed to looking at the ch as a consonant
digraph with the sound ch (as in inch), along comes the French ch and Greek
ch sounds. Rather than making the ch sound you know and love, the French
ch is pronounced like sh. The French ch does make for some beautiful words.
Say these words and relish how good they sound: chalet, chagrin, chiffon,
and chemise. The Greek ch makes the k sound (as in echo). These pages 
introduce your child to the French ch and Greek ch sounds. They show her
268

how to pronounce these sounds when they appear in English words adopted
from French and Greek.
Table 16-5 lists words with the typical ch sound that you’re used to, as well
as the French ch and Greek ch sound. In the table, I arrange the words so that
you can see the patterns and sounds of these words. Ask your child to care-
fully read the columns, and ask her to study the likenesses and differences
between these sounds.

Chapter 16: Explaining English Exceptions
Recognizing French word origins
Many English words were acquired from the
French and the Greek — words such as
chamois and scheme. After the Norman inva-
sion of England, the English language acquired
about 10,000 French words, and around 75 per-
cent of them are still in use today. Many of those
words, in turn, originated from Greek.
English derives more than a third of its words
directly or indirectly from French. Lexicographers
estimate that English speakers who have never
studied French already know 15,000 French
words.

Ask your child to read each of the following sentences to herself and then say
them all aloud.
My stomach aches from eating the cheese.
The chauffeur drove the Chevrolet to Chicago.
The chemist gave the children the picture.
Examining Six sh-Sound 
Spelling Patterns
So many sh sounds, so many different letters. Table 16-6 is a desperate
attempt to classify words with sh sounds to make it easier for your child to
spell these words. By classifying sh-sounding words this way, I hope to enable
your child to recognize these words when she reads them. Many Americans
say these words incorrectly at times. For example, have you heard the word
chic or crochet said in different ways? Have your child carefully read the
words in Table 16-6. See whether she can pick up on the six sh-sound 
spelling patterns.

Activity: Story: Elephant
To play: Ask your child to read this story. Some words may be difficult, but
she can ask for help in sounding them out. Within this story are several non-
phonetic words for her to decode.
The Elephant
What creature gains the most attention at the circus? The central act that
people come to glimpse is — what? The elephants! I think people come
because they want to see how big these pachyderms are, and how they
can be so calm and gentle.
There are two main classes of elephants, Asian and African. The Africans
get taller, though not as fat as the Asians. Their height can be 11 feet for
the Africans. But the best place to examine is the elephant’s head. The
African’s head is round, like a dome, and it has big floppy ears. The Asian
elephant’s ears are much smaller, and it has two bumps on top of its
head. The African elephant’s tusks are longer. They can grow to be over
12 feet long.
All elephants have tusks, except some of the female Asians. Tusks are
actually their teeth. Tusks grow close to 2 inches each year all through
their lives. Sometimes the tusks will get broken off when they fight with
other elephants, or evil hunters will cut them off with a large knife. By
nature, a new one grows right back, though. Sometimes the owners of
tamed elephants will keep their tusks trimmed and spruced up, or have
them carved off to keep them safe.
Did you ever wonder why elephants seem to walk in silence? It is because
they sort of walk on tiptoe. Under the heel is a large pad, and it protects
the foot like a gym shoe. (Imagine that! Built-in gym shoes!)
The skin, or hide, of an elephant is both thick and rough. Even though it
is so thick, he can feel pain. He can even tell if a tiny insect lands on it.
Maybe that’s why they can be tamed and guided around the tent area. If
they are smacked, or poked, it probably hurts pretty badly.
271
Chapter 16: Explaining English Exceptions

On that whole huge body, the touchiest organ is the nose, better known
as the trunk. The Asian elephant has a finger on the end of its trunk for
grabbing things. The African elephant has two fingers. The trunk has sev-
eral functions. It can smell, of course. But it can also grab things and
make frightful noises. With its trunk, an elephant can chirp, squeal, whis-
tle, trumpet, thump on the ground, and rumble. It can rumble in so low a
voice that only other elephants can hear it. These rumbles can be used to
talk with other elephants that are far away.
You will often see an elephant using its trunk to carry or drag large cargo.
An elephant can use its trunk to lift food, water, or other things high into
its mouth. What it cannot do is use its trunk like a straw for drinking.
Remember, it is a nose.
If you give the elephant access to a water trough, he will drink 50 to 100
gallons of water a day. They crave fresh grass, and of course they con-
tinue to love peanuts. Could you even consider feeding them tobacco,
stale donuts, or even paper? Some people do and they eat it. Elephants
are the biggest creatures on earth and very interesting as well.

Activity: Joke: Phonograph Records
To play: Read the joke to your child. You’ll probably have to give her a little
herb and history lesson, but the punch line is worth it. After that, you can
have her pick out five words that she learned from the lessons in this 
chapter.
One day a friend and I got out the old phonograph records and were lis-
tening to one of my golden Simon and Garfunkel albums. We were having
a good time reminiscing and laughing over the good old days.
My grandchild came into the room and wondered what all the fun was
about. We motioned for her to sit down on the sofa and listen. When one
particular song was finished, she asked me, “Well, did he?” I said, “Did he
what?” She replied, “Did Parsley save Rosemary in time?”

Activity: Story: Fulton’s Fabulous Folly
Preparation: You need paper and pencil.
To play: Ask your child to read this story and pick out the words that
are exceptions. Ask her to write them down on a piece of paper.
Fulton’s Fabulous Folly
Robert Fulton was a pretty good artist. His self-portrait hangs in a
museum in Kansas City, Missouri. That’s rather chic, but I guess
you could just call it a sideline. His real passion was machines,
especially floating machines.

Fulton fashioned a fascinating submarine in 1800, before we even had
motorized ships. It was called the Nautilus, and he tried to sell it to the
French government, and then the British government. But neither of them
saw the potential of such a ship.
Next, Robert decided that the world needed to travel with more accelera-
tion over water, even when there wasn’t enough wind to push the sailing
ships along very fast. He had watched the steam engine being used for
such things as pumping water in mines and for running machines. In his
mind, he envisioned a steam engine as propulsion for a boat.
He used all of his powers of persuasion to convince our nation’s ambas-
sador to France, Robert Livingston, that it could be done. Livingston’s
contribution was money, and they became partners. Imagine Livingston’s
elation when Fulton fashioned a paddleboat with a steam engine called
the Clermont. Even though people initially called it “Fulton’s Folly,” their
attention was captured by this vessel when it went from New York City to
Albany, a trip of 150 miles, in just 32 hours. It took only 30 hours for the
return navigation.
Soon steamboats were a common way to travel and to ship products
from one part of the country to another. Eventually, steamships were
used for ocean navigation, also. Robert Fulton was surely a man of special
vision.

Chapter 17
Zeroing In on x and zh
In This Chapter
 Discovering the different sounds of x
 Taking a look at zh words
T
his chapter throws you a couple of oddballs: the x and zh sounds. Words
with these sounds have eccentric spellings. Unfortunately your child has
no recourse but to memorize words that make the x and zh sounds. Your
child has to learn these words by sight.
The beauty of it is that there aren’t a lot of x and zh words, so your child
doesn’t have to take on a bunch of new information. And your child will find
many fun activities in this chapter to help him master x and zh.
Differentiating the x Sounds
The letter x makes no sound of its own. The letter x, you could say, is like one
of those people who’s always borrowing items from the neighbors — in other
words, x borrows its sounds from other letters. Your child already knows that
x, with its keyword box, makes the ks sound when it appears at the end of a
word. The other two x sounds also borrow from other letters. The x can also
make the gz sound (as in exact) and the z sound (as in Xavier).
Until your child gets used to seeing x in its three conventions, he has to rely
on x words as sight words. This section of the chapter introduces your child
to the different sounds of x and gives him practice in recognizing which x
sound to make when he encounters x words in his reading.

Looking at some x guidelines
Guidelines for the sound of the letter x are as follows:
 At the end of a word, x makes the ks sound (as in fox).
 At the end of the syllable ex, the letter x may make the gz or ks sound
(as in exam and exile).
 At the beginning of a word, x makes the z sound (as in xylophone).
Of course, these guidelines have plenty of exceptions. For example, some
people say the ks sound in the word exit. This isn’t a regional preference as
much as it is a personal preference. The dictionary considers ks second on
the pronunciation preference.
Here’s the lone exception to the three x guidelines: the word x-ray. Smart chil-
dren will tell you that x also makes the sound x in the word x-ray. You can tell
these smart children that this x is the algebraic x, the “unknown” ray as it
was called when first discovered.
X at the beginning, middle, 
and end of words
Table 17-1 presents examples of the three sounds of x. Ask your child to read
each column from top to bottom and to be aware of how the x sound differs
in each column. The words in the third column are seldom used, so you may
need to help your child with these scientific words.

5. Listen to x in example.
Answer Key: 1. ks 2. gz 3. z 4. z 5. gz
zh: A Consonant Sound with 
No Distinct Spelling
The zh sound has so many spellings that the words have to be taught as sight
words. You may be surprised by how many words make the zh sound. You
can hear it in such unrelated words as fusion, usual, azure, and loge. The
young reader must be able to hear the difference between the voiced zh
sound and the consonant digraph, the voiceless sh. You can hear the differ-
ence between these sound in the words glazier and glacier.
This section helps your child get acquainted with the zh sound and the
new sight words that he must learn to master zh. Here you can find a
helpful, heaping portion of exercises to help your child master zh 
spellings.
Table 17-2 lists zh words and organizes them according to the different ways
in which the sound is spelled in words. Some of these words are difficult.
Take it slowly so that your child can learn these words without getting 
frustrated.

To play: Ask your child to read the story and find all the words that have the
x and zh sounds.
The Unlucky Ladder
It all started on a cool morning in late September. The air was just begin-
ning to feel crisp, and the Halloween exhibits were making their first
appearances on the front lawns of the suburban homes. Janet Lately was
on her way to school when she passed beneath a wooden stepladder.
Mr. Gregly was painting Halloween colors on his WELCOME sign that
hung above his candy-store window.
Just before she walked beneath it, Mr. Gregly called down, “Hey, Janet.
Unlucky to walk under a ladder you know. You might want to walk
around. Don’t want to get mixed up in anything. Don’t want to put a 
hex on you.”
But Janet ignored Mr. Gregly’s advice and zipped right through. Had she
known then what she knew now, she would have heeded that warning.
As she reached the next corner, she saw her best friend, John. John and
Janet were once next-door neighbors. John had to move, though, because
his father said that he was tired of looking at the Bracket’s unsightly lawn
281
Chapter 17: Zeroing In on x and zh

and unpainted garage. Janet waved to him excitedly. She wanted to tell
him all about the new family that had moved into his old house.
John gave her a queer, perplexed look and kept right on walking. “John!”
she yelled and chased after him. She caught up with him right outside the
local music store. She could hear one of the customers inside trying out
the xylophone that had been displayed in the window all summer. “Hey,”
she said panting as she clapped her hand on his shoulder, “Wait up.”
John gave her that same bewildered look again. “Who are you?” he asked,
as he continued to walk.
“What’s the matter with you?” Janet replied. She picked up her pace 
to stay with him as he walked. He totally ignored her for the rest of the
trip to school. He didn’t even say goodbye as they headed toward their
homerooms.
Janet arrived at her classroom just as the first bell rang. The other chil-
dren ran to their seats and sat quietly. The teacher blocked Janet’s way
as she tried to enter the room.
“Well hello, little girl. Can I help you with something?”
“Okay,” Janet explained, with tears in the corner of her eyes. “I’ve had
just about enough of this. You know darn well that my name is Janet
Lately, and that I’m a student in this class. My seat is right over there!”
Janet pointed to her usual corner of the room.
Her desk! It was gone. Janet fled from the room and ran to her locker. She
had left her student ID in her science book. Once she showed them an ID,
that would be proof enough. They would have to stop their silly games.
Janet dialed her combination and yanked on the handle. It stayed tightly
locked. She dialed it again and pulled. Nothing.
Janet didn’t know what to do. She started for the exit door of the school
when she caught sight of Mrs. Kelly from the third grade. If Mrs. Kelly
didn’t remember her, then no one would. Mrs. Kelly, between math and
spelling lessons, had tutored Janet to help her pass the exam on the
Constitution of the United States of America.
Mrs. Kelly saw the trouble in Janet’s eyes and promptly asked her,
“What’s wrong little girl. Are you lost?”
That was enough for Janet. She ran from the school building, ignoring the
hall monitor’s threat of suspension if she tried to leave without a pass.
As she headed home, a frightening thought occurred to her. What if her
own mom and dad didn’t recognize her? What if her identity had been
completely erased?
As she turned a corner, she spotted Mr. Gregly’s freshly painted orange
and black sign swaying in the gentle breeze. It suddenly struck her that
282
Part IV: Tackling the Trickier Side of Phonics 

Mr. Gregly was the last person who had spoken her name that morning . . .
right before she had gone under his ladder. She ran into his candy shop
and up to the counter.
“What can I do for you, Missy?”
Even Mr. Gregly didn’t remember her. Janet quickly devised a plan. “Um . . .
sir? I was playing with my toy airplane and it landed on your roof. I’m in a
fix. Do you think you could get it for me?” Mr. Gregly, whether he remem-
bered Janet or not, was the nicest man in the city. He would think nothing
of climbing up on a roof for one of the neighborhood children.
“No problem, Missy. I’ve already got the ladder out. I was just using it 
this morning to paint my sign up for Halloween.” He grabbed the large
wooden stepladder and headed for the exit.
As soon as he had set the ladder up and was stretching his head high
enough to see the rooftop, Janet walked backwards beneath the ladder.
“I don’t see anything up here,” she heard Mr. Gregly say. He looked down
and spotted her. “Oh, hello, Janet. Hey, watch out. You know, it’s bad luck
to walk under a ladder.”
“Yes sir.” Janet said, and quickly walked around the ladder.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
bet you love to hear about the top ten songs of the year,
the top ten movies, the top ten golf pros, or something
that’s the top ten in some way. How about the ten worst

Ten is the magic number for lists of all kinds, and the
chapters in this part are no exception. Here you find out
about additional resources to help you with phonics.
I also give you some fun yet challenging activities to help
you and your child further refine your phonics expertise.
And, yes, these things are in top ten lists of my own, pre-
sented here for your consideration and enjoyment. 
Also included here are four appendixes. Appendix A, B,
and C include important information that you can use
for reference. For those of you who want to perfect the
sounding of the letters, Appendix D completes this part

Ten Challenging Activities 
for Reinforcement
In This Chapter
 Playing games to increase reading skills
 Learning with kinesthetic activities
 Making books with your children
 Singing songs as an aid in learning
T
his chapter presents some activities that your child can do at home to
help her learn how to read with the phonics method. Most of the activi-
ties I present here are homemade — you can create these games on your own
with materials in your household; some of the games I suggest must be pur-
chased. All these games are meant to make learning fun and enjoyable.
When you’re too tired or busy for intensive one-on-one teaching, you can rely
on the games in this chapter. Children can do most these activities on their
own without your supervision. The activities in this chapter are presented
from the easiest to the most difficult.
Word Scramble
The Word Scramble gives a child experience in editing and proofing her work.
It also sharpens her phonics skills in spelling and reading. The Word Scramble
can be difficult for a beginning writer, but it’s as an excellent skill-boosting
activity.
Activity: Word Scramble

Preparation: To do this exercise, you need a piece of paper and a pencil, and
a drawing of an animal or clown with a tummy prominent enough that you
can print each vowel on it. Next to the drawing, write scrambled words such
as pna, tpa, tas, cta, and naf, and draw a circle around each scrambled word.
You can try scrambling these words: man, pan, cat, gap, bat, tap, pad, jab, can,
sat, and, hat, map, lap, fan, tax, yam, van, had, and ham.
To play: Have your child:
1. Decode each scrambled word, one by one.
2. Read the word to herself.
3. Write down each word on the piece of paper.
Draw a clown or animal for each vowel and its accompanying set of scram-
bled words. After your child masters the short vowels, you can draw clowns
or animals for long-vowel word families.
Froggy Phonics Learning Game
You can purchase the Froggy Phonics Learning Game at a school store.
Depending on what parts of the game you’re interested in, the game costs $35
or less. It’s great for building reading skills and can have one or more partici-
pants. As the children play the game, they discover that the same phonics
skills they learn in this book are presented in a game form. Players spin a
phonics skills spinner and try to be the first to find a matching word on their
lily pads. The first player to put down four froggies wins. The game board is
double-sided, with each side addressing different phonics levels. It covers
most of a basics phonics course. Go to www.highsmith.com and enter
Froggy Phonics in the search field. (The game is made by Edupress
Educational Products.)
“Sounds Great!” Phonics Song
The kids love “Sounds Great!” and it’s super for warming up the sounds of the
consonants, the short vowels, and the long-vowel sounds! At Saturday School,
I play the audiocassette song as the kids come into the room. They sit down
at the table and we sing the alphabet, making the consonant sounds and the
short sounds of the vowels; as time progresses we do the long sounds.
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

“Sounds Great!” is a unique, multisensory, letter-sound program for young
children (ages 3-7), designed by 15 educators from the Oak Hills School
District in Cincinnati, Ohio. The program consists of 34 characters and verses
set to music; the student book and tape represent the core program. Go to
www.soundsgreat.cc to get an overview of “Sounds Great!” online.
Take
Take is a sound-matching card game that teaches the essentials of sounding
out letters and words. Players don’t need to know loads of sounds to begin
playing the game. The game is excellent for reinforcing short-vowel sounds.
Activity: Take
Preparation: Start by making 2 sets of 52 playing cards, 1 with short-vowel
words and 1 with long-vowel words (see Chapters 4 and 7 for lists of short-
vowel and long-vowel words). You need 104 note tags or index cards that are
about the size of playing cards, scissors, and a fine-tipped pen. Using the pen,
draw a line dividing each card in two. 
To continue with the preparation, on each card, write the same short-vowel
(or long-vowel) word twice, once at each end of the card so that the word can
be read by players sitting on opposite sides of a table. For example, you can
write the word pig at one end of the card, pivot the card around, and write
the word pig on the other end. After you make 52 short-vowel playing cards
and 52 long-vowel playing cards, you’re ready to start the game.
To play: Have the players (two or four can play) sit opposite one another at a
table. You can play with one or both sets of playing cards. The object of the
game is for each player to gather as many pairs as she can. Follow these
instructions:
1. Shuffle the cards thoroughly.
2. Place the stack of cards facedown in the center of the table.
3. From the top of the deck, draw three cards and lay them face-up in
the center of the table.
4. In turn, have each player take one card from the top of the deck and
place it face-up in front of her.
5. The player reads the word on the card, says its vowel sound, and com-
pares it to the three face-up cards on the table:
289
Chapter 18: Ten Challenging Activities for Reinforcement

• If the word on the card has the same vowel sound as a face-up
card, the player has a match. The player says something like, “Pig
takes jig because of the i sound.” The player can then pick up the
matching face-up card in the middle of the table (jig), put it
together with the card she drew from the deck (pig), and set the
cards aside as a pair.
When one of the three face-up cards in the center is taken, the
player draws another card from the deck to replace it. This card is
placed face-up beside the other two cards in the middle of the
table so that there are always three face-up cards, and the next
player takes her turn.
• If the word on the card doesn’t match any vowel sound on the
three face-up cards in the middle of the table, there isn’t a match.
The player places the card she drew from the deck on the discard
pile and the next player takes her turn.
When all the cards in the deck have been turned up and matched or put into
the discard pile, the discard pile then becomes the new deck, and players
draw from it. Play continues as long as matching cards are available. Then
each player counts her tricks, and the player with the most tricks wins.
Mix and Match
Mix and Match is a homespun game that’s fun for your child to play. The pur-
pose of this game is to promote skill in decoding and reading words.
Activity: Mix and Match
Preparation: Find and cut out small pictures, 1 to 2 square inches, that illus-
trate simple one-syllable words. For example, cut out a picture of a box, ship,
girl, boy, hen, cow, dog, cat, car, ball, frog, and duck. You get the idea. Then
glue these pictures onto cardstock or index cards.
Next, cut longer pieces of cardstock — 2-x-8 inches. On each of these pieces
of cardstock, write down a word for one of the pictures you cut out, and then
write a short, simple sentence using the word. For example, if you cut out the
picture of a frog, write down the word frog along with a sentence that
includes the word frog.
To play:
1. Place the picture cards face-up in a pile and position the sentence
cards in rows and columns on a table.
290
Part V: The Part of Tens 

2. For each picture card, have your child try to find its matching sen-
tence card.
3. When your child finds a match, have her say the word, place the pic-
ture card over the sentence card, and read the sentence.
For example, when your child finds the frog card, she places the picture
of the frog on the card, says “frog,” and reads the sentence with the
word frog in it.
Packing My Suitcase
Packing My Suitcase is a phonics version of an old game. The purpose of the
game is to promote skill in memory and language use. The game also rein-
forces an understanding of alphabetical order. Two or more children (along
with adults) can play.
Activity: Packing My Suitcase
Preparation: Before you start playing, choose a category. For example, you
can choose girls’ or boys’ names, animals, flowers, or food. For this game,
you pretend that you’re going to pack items from the category for a long 
journey.
To play: The first player says, “I’m packing my suitcase, going to New York,
and I’m taking an aardvark (or some other a word from the category you
choose).” The second person says, “I’m packing my suitcase, going to New
York, and I’m taking an aardvark and a baboon.” The third person says,
“I’m packing my suitcase, going to New York, and I’m taking an aardvark, a
baboon, and a camel.” Each person in his turn has to name every item that
came before and add an additional item to the list. Keep going until you pack
items from a to z.
Here are a to z examples of animals in case you choose animals as the cate-
gory: aardvark, ant, alligator, ape; bat, baboon, butterfly, bird, bunny; cat,
camel, cow; deer, doe, dog; eagle, elephant, eel, emu; fish, fawn, ferret, finch,
fowl; giraffe, goat, gecko; hog, hippo, hare; iguana, impala, inch worm; joey,
jaguar, jellyfish, jackal; katydid, kangaroo, kinkajou, kiwi; llama, lion, lamb;
monkey, mouse, mockingbird, mongoose, moose; newt, nightingale; octopus,
ocelot, okapi, owl, orangutan; pig, panda, peacock; quetzal, quail; rat, rhino,
raccoon, reindeer; swan, salmon, starfish, seal; turkey, tern, tiger, tuna, turtle;
umbrella bird; vulture, vole; walrus, wallaby, woodpecker; xenops, xylotrechus;
yellow tail (fish), yak, yellow jacket; zebra, zorilla. (A zorilla, also known as a
striped polecat, is a carnivorous animal in Africa akin to a weasel or skunk.)
291
Chapter 18: Ten Challenging Activities for Reinforcement

Before you start playing this game, research the categories and have in mind
the brain stumpers that players are likely to get stuck on. In the animal cate-
gory, for example, xenops is a brain stumper. Of course, the brain stumpers
are the tiebreakers. This game is great for the car. For a greater challenge,
have the children spell the words and put them in sentences.
Journaling
One way to get your child to begin writing is to have her keep a journal. Your
child doesn’t have to display her emotions on paper, but a child who is 6 to 8
years old is capable of writing simple, descriptive sentences, and you want to
capitalize on that.
When I’m teaching a child who’s slow at writing, I tell her parents to get a
notebook, fancy it up with stickers, and tell her that it’s her journal. She can
write what she’s going to do on a given day or what she’s already done. She
can write about anything she wants — about sports, school, or her friends.
The idea is to encourage her to start writing.
Journaling works great in the summer when more time is available and more
interesting things are happening. Writing in a journal is a way to document
important events. It also gives parents the opportunity to see how well their
children write. Correct the grammar and spelling mistakes in your child’s
journal on a weekly basis. I recommend writing at least three sentences per
day. If your child dates her journals entries, she can get more enjoyment from
them later in life.
Kinesthetic Activities
Kinesthetic learning is a teaching and learning method in which the student
learns while engaging in physical activity, rather than listening to a lecture or
watching a demonstration. If you determine that kinesthetic activity helps
your child learn to read, here are some helpful kinesthetic learning tech-
niques. These techniques are naturally motivating and can be used in pairs,
in groups, or with adults.
 Clap or tap out letters, syllables, and words.
 Write words on a rough surface as you dictate them. This tactile exercise
helps develop a “lane to the brain.”
 Allow the child to talk to himself for motor feedback.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Introduce letters with stencils.
 Use large floor or wall puzzles and large maps.
 Dramatize and act out using songs, rhythm, and mnemonics.
 Write on a gel pad or engage in “air writing.”
 Crawl or do somersaults during breaks.
I created a pathway to my schoolroom from a long roll of wallpaper with foot-
prints on it named for letters of the alphabet. When the kids come in, they
walk on the footprints and call out the name of each letter. It’s good practice
for kids who thrive on learning by doing. You can create these wallpaper
pathways with short-vowel words, also.
Tried-and-True Games
Here’s a list of tried-and-true games that children have enjoyed from the old
days to present times. Some of these games can be made at home and some
must be purchased. Most of these games enhance decoding, reading, and
spelling. The Authors Game is neat because it gives the children a fantastic
listing of classic poems and books by famous authors, which really comes in
handy when they get to high school. At any rate, if you don’t know about
these games, look them up on the Internet. I arrange them here in order from
beginning games to advanced games:
Tic-tac-toe, LeapFrog and Fisher-Price Phonics Products, Go Fish, Old
Maid, Bingo With Letters, Concentration or Memory, Authors, Hangman,
Boxes Game, Scrabble Jr., Text Twist for Kids, Boggle, Pictionary, and
Guesstures
Book Making
As soon as your child can string sentences together, she can make her first
book. You can help her construct a book or purchase a blank one with lined
pages and room for making illustrations. Making a book is an excellent activ-
ity for children because it increases their language abilities and builds confi-
dence. Books should be made with standard-size paper that’s stapled or
threaded together on the left side. Have your child put her name on the book
and decorate its cover.
293
Chapter 18: Ten Challenging Activities for Reinforcement

Possibilities for personal books are:
 A dictated story: The parent takes down the child’s words as she tells
her story.
 A picture-story book: The child makes up a story to go along with pic-
tures she draws.
 A picture dictionary: The child describes what the pictures represent.
 A language experience book: The parent organizes a list of phrases
with participles, and the exercises center on the use of particular words.
For example: Growing vegetables, describing a feast, going to the aquar-
ium, riding in a spaceship, snorkeling at the Great Barrier Reef, galloping
on a horse, whale watching, or changing the oil in a car. The experiences
can be fictional or nonfictional.

Appendix A
Phonics Guidelines 
and Definitions
T
his appendix offers phonics guidelines and definitions that you can use
as a reference. You can find consonant guidelines, vowel guidelines, syl-
labication guidelines, and a mini-glossary.
Some people shy away from guidelines and definitions, but they often 
come in handy. Give it a chance and you may find this reference downright
indispensable.
Consonant Guidelines
Check out the following consonant guidelines for phonics:
 Guidelines for the sound of the letter c:
• Hard c: The letter c says k before a, o, and u (as in cap).
• Soft c: The letter c says s before e, i, and y (as in cent).
• Before a consonant: The letter c says k (as in crack).
 Guidelines for the sound of the letter g:
• Hard g: The letter g says g before a, o, and u (as in gum).
• Soft g: The letters ge say j at the end of a word (as in page).
• At the beginning of a word: The letters ge, gi, and gy may be a hard
or a soft g (as in get or gem); usually soft.
 Guidelines for the sound of the letter s:
• At the end of a word: The letters se often have the sound of z 
(as in hose).
• After voiced consonants: The letter s says z (as in dogs).

 Guidelines for the sound of the letter x:
• At the end of a word: The letter x says ks (as in fox).
• At the end of the syllable: The letters ex and x may say gz or ks (as
in exam or expel).
• At the beginning of a word: The letter x says z (as in xylophone).
Vowel Guidelines
Learning vowel guidelines helps children so much. If they learn them and
take them to heart, they can instantly recognize the words to which the dif-
ferent guidelines apply. Here are the vowel guidelines, divided into basic
vowel guidelines and vowel guidelines that apply to word endings.
Five basic vowel guidelines
These five basic vowel guidelines will never lead you astray:
1. When a word or syllable has only one vowel, and the vowel comes
between two consonants, the vowel is usually short. (Example: not)
2. When a word or syllable has only one vowel, and the vowel comes at the
beginning, the vowel is usually short. (Example: on)
3. When a word or syllable has two vowels, the first vowel is often long and
the second is silent. (Example: note and oak) Please note that there are a
lot of exceptions here, as in book, zoo, couch, toy, boil, fruit, and bread.
4. When a word or syllable has only one vowel, and the vowel comes at the
end, the vowel is usually long. (Example: no)
5. When a is followed by u, w, r, ll, or lt in the same syllable, it often has the
third sound of a. (Example: salt)
Additional vowel guidelines 
for word endings
These additional vowel guidelines pertain to word endings:
302
Phonics For Dummies 

1. When y comes at the end of a word that has two or more syllables, y has
the sound of a long e if the y syllable is unaccented. (Example: puppy)
2. When y comes at the end of a word that has two or more syllables, y has
the sound of a long i if the y syllable is accented. (Example: reply)
3. When words end with the suffix ing, ed, or er, the first vowel is usually
short if it comes before two consonants. (Example: getting)
4. When words end with the suffix ing, ed, or er, the first vowel is usually
long if it comes before a single consonant. (Example: riding)
Guidelines for Syllabication
Syllabication refers to how words are divided into syllables. After your child
is well on her way to mastering basic phonics, she can begin focusing on
simple syllables. And she can turn to these pages for a summary of syllabica-
tion guidelines.
 A word containing one vowel sound is never divided into syllables.
• fat, fact, fame, curl
 A compound word is divided between the two words that make the 
compound.
• up-set, in-to, sun-beam, bath-room
 If a word has a prefix, it’s divided between the prefix and the root.
• mis-take, un-loose, ex-cel, ad-mit
 If a word has a suffix, it’s divided between the root and the suffix.
• plant-ed, end-ed, sing-ing, high-ness
Exception: The suffix ed doesn’t add a syllable to a word if the word ends
in the consonant sound t or d.
• mixed, helped, smelled, lacked, cashed
 If one consonant is between two vowels, the word is usually divided
after the consonant if the first vowel sound is short. It’s called a closed
syllable.
• rob-in, com-ics, grav-el, pol-ish
 If one consonant is between two vowels, the word is usually divided
after the first vowel if the vowel sound is long. It’s called an open 
syllable.
• la-bor, mu-sic, pho-to, Po-lish
303
Appendix A: Phonics Guidelines and Definitions

 If two or more consonants come between two vowels, the word is usu-
ally divided between the first two consonants.
• let-ter, cof-fee, splen-did, hun-gry
Exceptions: Blends and strong digraphs aren’t separated. The strong con-
sonant digraphs are sh, ch, ck, wh, and th.
• se-cret, gath-er, punch-es, pro-gram
 If a vowel is sounded alone in a word, it makes a syllable by itself.
• a-go, o-bey, mon-u-ment, pi-a-no, vi-o-let
 If two vowels are together in a word but are sounded separately, the
word is divided between the two vowels.
• di-et, fu-el, ra-di-o, cre-ate
 If a word ends in le preceded by a consonant, the word is usually divided
before the consonant.
• tum-ble, twin-kle, tin-gle, ri-fle
Exception: The strong digraph ck is never divided.
• tack-le, trick-le, knuck-le
Phonics Terminology
Here’s a reference source for all things phonic! It classifies the different kinds
of consonants and vowels.
Consonants
Consonants fall into three categories: single consonants, consonant digraphs,
and blends.
 Single consonants: All the letters of the alphabet except a, e, i, o, and u.
 Consonant digraphs: A single consonant sound made by two letters:
• Basic digraphs: ch, sh, wh, th, th, ng, nk, zh
• Other digraphs: ck, ph, gh, wr, kn, gn, mn, mb
 Blends: br, cr, dr, fr, gr, pr, tr, scr, str, bl, cl, fl, gl, pl, sc, sk, sm, sn, sp, st,
sw, tw
304
Phonics For Dummies 

Vowels
Vowels fall into three categories: single vowels, vowel digraphs, and 
diphthongs.
 Single vowels: a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y and w (as in by and low)
 Vowel digraphs: A single vowel sound made by two vowels. Vowel
digraphs fall into these categories:
• Regular digraphs: The first vowel is always long, and the second
vowel is silent: ai, ay, ea, ee, ei, ie, ao, oe, oo, ou, ow, ue, ui 
(ui = ∂∂).
• Irregular digraphs: These digraphs have three categories:
The first vowel is heard but doesn’t make the long sound:
haul (a3), head (|), too (o3), lawn (a3), cough (©), soup (o3)
The second vowel is heard:
steak (≈), shield (√), rough (±), could (u3)
Neither vowel is heard:
veil (ä), true (o3), earn (ur), they (≈), flew (o3), took (u3)
 Diphthongs: A gliding vowel sound made by two vowels. Diphthongs fall
into these categories:
• Plain: ou, ow, oi, oy
• Murmur: ar, or, er, ir, ur
Take note of the following regarding diphthongs:
 The third sound of a is ä.
 The third sound of o is the same as Webster’s two o’s (∂∂) and
Thorndike’s two dot ü.
 The third sound of u is the same as Webster’s two o’s (©©) and
Thorndike’s one dot u.
A Mini-Glossary
Following is a mini-glossary of phonics terms. Memorize these terms and
you’re well on your way to becoming a master of phonics:
305
Appendix A: Phonics Guidelines and Definitions

Blend: Two or three consonants are spoken together, with each keeping
its own sound.
Consonant digraph: Two consonants that together make one consonant
sound.
Diphthong: Two vowels joined in one syllable that make a double sound.
There are plain and murmur diphthongs.
Irregular vowel digraph: Any of the basic vowel sounds other than the
long sound of the first vowel.
Phonics: The system of representing word sounds with letters.
Regular vowel digraph: The first vowel is long and the second is silent.
Schwa: The unstressed vowel sound that’s pronounced like short u.
Syllable: A word or part of a word that contains one vowel sound.
Vowel: The letters a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y and w.
Vowel digraph: Two vowels that together make one vowel sound.

Appendix B
Recommended Books for 
Your Kid’s Library
O
ne of my goals in writing this book is to set your child on a lifelong 
journey of reading enjoyment. To that end, this appendix presents the
names of carefully selected books, authors, and series that will not only help
develop your child’s reading skills, but also help nourish her love of reading.
Now that she can read on her own, you want to direct her to the kind of read-
ing that educates and elevates the mind.
One easy way to start building a book collection for your child is to begin
with authors. Wonderful authors can be found in most reading categories.
That stands to reason. These authors have passed the test of time. They have
talent that has lasted for more than one season:
 Louisa May Alcott
 Beverly Cleary
 Doreen Cronin
 Kevin Henkes
 George McDonald
 E. Nesbitt
 H.A. Rey
 Kate Seredy
 E.B. White
 Laura Ingalls Wilder
Following is an alphabetical list, by title, of books, series, and other written
works that I recommend for children. Naturally, any list of this kind is incom-
plete. These resources will keep your child reading for many exciting years.
You can find many of these books in multiple formats with several editions by

numerous publishers. I list the titles, authors, and publishers of the versions
that are easy to find, but if you have trouble finding exactly what I list, keep
looking. Check your local bookstore, or www.amazon.com, or www.abebooks.
com to find the latest and greatest information on these and other books.

n Chapters 2 and 3, I tell you about flashcards and keyword cards that you
and your child can use to help reinforce what you learn about letters,
sounds, and words. In this appendix, I provide you with examples of keyword
cards that you can photocopy and attach to index cards for your own use.
The cards represented here include consonant sounds and one vowel (a),
which I cover in detail in Chapter 3. But you can create your own cards, using
any keywords you want, by using these as a starting point. Be creative and
