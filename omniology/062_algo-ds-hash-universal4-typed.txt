of Algorithms I

Recall : one object per slot, hash function produces a 
probe sequence for each possible key x.

Fact : difficult to analyze rigorousely.
Heuristic assumption : (for a quick & dirty idealized 
analysis only) all n! probe sequences equally.

Observation : under heuristic assumption, expected 
Insertion time is ~

Heuristic Analysis
Tim Roughgarden
Proof : A random probe finds an empty slot with 
probability 
So : Insertion time ~ the number N of coin flips to get 
“heads”, where Pr[“heads”] =

Note : 
Solution :
1st coin flip
Probability of tails
Expected # of further 
coin flips needed

Note : heuristic assumption completely false.
Assume instead : initial probes uniform at random 
independent for different keys (“less false”)
Linear Probing

independent for different keys. ( less false )
Theorem : [Knuth 1962] under above assumption, 
expected Insertion time is
