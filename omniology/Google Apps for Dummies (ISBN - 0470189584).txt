Authors’ Acknowledgments
This book wouldn’t have happened without the inspiration and guidance of
Esther Wojcicki of Palo Alto High School and Jeremy Milo, the Google Apps
Product Marketing Manager at Google. Nor could we have accomplished so
much without the External Training Team at Google, of which we were so for-
tunate to be a part. Here’s to Lance Cotton, Erik Gottlieb, Lauren Frandsen,
Kristina Cutura, Charbel Semaan, Tyrona Heath, Mary Hekl, Brian Schreier,
and Jared Smith. You guys rock!
We’d also like to give special recognition to our outstanding team at Wiley
Publishing, including Greg Croy, executive editor; Jean Nelson, project editor;
Laura K. Miller, copy editor; James Kelly, technical editor; and the other
incredibly talented and amazing people who made working on this project a
real treat.
Along those lines, we’d also like to acknowledge our friends and colleagues at
the Rutgers Business School and the Utah County Academy of Science for
their support.
Finally, we acknowledge you, the reader, for trusting us to help you make the
most out of this amazing and incredibly useful technology.

Introduction
W
hen most people hear Google, they think of the powerful search tool
with its squeaky-clean search box, colorful logo, and reliable search
results. A few may know about its advertising tools, AdWords and AdSense,
which generate Google’s astounding profits quarter after quarter. Google
recently became even more indispensable to teams and useful to organiza-
tions when it released Google Apps, a suite of online applications that enables
you to create, share, and publish documents, spreadsheets, presentations,
and more from any computer with an Internet connection.
If you think it may be time for your team, business, school, or organization to
move out of costly, time-consuming information technology boondoggles and
start using these powerful online Google applications, then Google Apps For
Dummies is for you. If you’re on the fence, turn to Chapter 1, where we dis-
cuss all the advantages and disadvantages of complementing your work or
academic life with Google Apps. We hope that Google Apps has piqued your
interest, even if it’s only because you can save a lot of money and reduce
your computing hassles.
If you want to use Google Apps for just yourself (not as part of a business or
school), you can. Go to www.google.com and click the iGoogle link in the
upper-right corner of the screen. You are given a customizable Start Page that
will work like a springboard to the Internet and your Google Apps. From this
page, you can set up your gadgets and create a user experience similar to
what Google Apps users enjoy. Look for the tips throughout this book directed
to iGoogle users.
About This Book
We realize that before you can make any software solution effective within an
organization, you have to meet the needs of two audiences, so we address
each audience in specific parts of this book to keep your training neat and
tidy:
 General users: Chapters 3 through 13 show you how to use the parts of
Google Apps you’ll want to use the most: The Start Page, Gmail, Chat (or
Talk), Calendar, Docs, Spreadsheets, and Presentations. If you’re using
the apps with a normal Google account, the information in Chapters 3
through 13 will work for you, too.

 Information technology (IT) administrators: Chapter 2 shows you how
to set up Google Apps, and Part IV is your step-by-step guide to admin-
istering Google Apps. (Of course, you’re free to read the rest of the book
to make sure you can help users with any of the apps.)
This book is an enterprise-wide training solution for users at every level, but
it can also help small businesses, groups, families, and even individual users.
We guide the IT team while they set up Google Apps. We bring users up to
speed and show them tips and tricks to get the most out of Google Apps.
Why? Because we know how frustrating IT administrators can find setting up
a new software system and then having staffers or students fail to make good
use of the new tools.
How This Book Is Organized
We divided this book into parts and chapters, organizing the chapters into
five parts (which we describe in the following sections).
Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps
Part I is the obvious place to start if you’re brand new to Google Apps.
Chapter 1 provides a general overview; we kept it short because we realize
that if you have the great wisdom to pick up this book in the first place,
you’re probably anxious to get started. For Team Edition users and adminis-
trators, Chapter 2 runs through the process of setting up Google Apps for
your team, business, school, agency, or nonprofit organization. For general
users, Chapter 3 introduces your organization’s personalized Start Page and
shows you how easily you can access all your Google Apps from one place.
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on 
Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar
Chapters 4 through 6 take you through the Gmail and Contacts List so that
you can become proficient with Google’s communications tools. Chapter 7
takes you into Gmail Chat and Google Talk to satisfy your instant-messaging
needs. Chapters 8 and 9 show you how to set up and use your Google
Calendars personal calendar to keep track of your own activities and how 
to share that information with other people quickly.

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents,
Spreadsheets, and Presentations
Chapter 10 introduces you to the Google Docs Home and discusses how 
to create and organize your documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
Chapter 11 covers documents, and it has you creating and formatting docu-
ments by using Google Docs, as well as accessing documents in Google Docs
that you created by using a different word processor. Chapter 12 introduces
Google Spreadsheets and has you calculating, writing formulas, creating
imaginative charts, and sharing your spreadsheets in the blink of an eye.
Chapter 13 takes you through Google Presentations and helps you create 
professional Web presentations — you can even show off a bit by using
Google’s highly visual and shareable Presentations app.
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google 
Apps Administration
The chapters in this part are aimed at administrators. Chapter 14 delves into
the Dashboard and helps you set up users and adjust basic domain settings.
Chapter 15 walks you, step by step, through the process of setting up the
Start Page — customizing it to your business, school, or organization, com-
plete with your own logo, domain name, and look and feel. In Chapter 16, we
show you the Page Creator and go through the basics of creating a simple,
professional-looking Web page. Finally, Chapter 17 helps you tweak your apps
even more and add controls for your users.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part begins by giving you ten solutions to common problems in Chapter
18. Chapter 19 suggests more Google Apps and services that you may want to
explore. (This final chapter is one of our favorites.)
Conventions Used in This Book
To make using this book as easy and convenient as possible, we’ve set up a
few conventions:
 When we throw a new term at you, we place it in italics and define it.
 We place text that you actually type in bold.
3
Introduction

 Web site addresses and file names appear in a monospace font, like this:
www.dummies.com. When part of a file name or Web site address varies
(depending on what your own Web site address is), we use italics to indi-
cate a placeholder. For example, when you see http://start.your
domain.com, you type the address with your own domain name in place
of yourdomain.com.
 When you need to use a menu to select a command, we use the command
arrow (➪). For example, File➪Rename simply means that you should click
the File menu and then select the Rename command.
 When we show keyboard shortcuts, we place the plus sign (+) between
keys. For example, to use the Cut command, press Ctrl+X. This means 
to press the Ctrl key and the X key at the same time.
Icons Used in This Book
Everyone gets distracted, starts to daydream, gets a little hungry, and quits
paying attention to the lovely prose that they’re reading. In an attempt to
regain your attention from that long-overdue Snickers bar, we place icons
throughout this book. Each has its own sleep-preventative powers.
We mark paragraphs that we think you’ll find very useful with this icon. Tips
show you shortcuts, time-savers, or something that’s otherwise worth noting.
So, wake up and pay attention!
When you see this icon, beware. From experience, we know when you can
easily make a mistake that may cause irreparable harm or damage to the
Internet or national security. Well, maybe the Warning icon doesn’t point out
something that dire, but you should still pay attention or risk losing data, time,
and possibly hair (because you’re pulling it out in frustration).
Rather than repeat ourselves (because maybe you didn’t pay attention the
first time), we pop this icon in place. Commit the information to memory, 
and it can help you later.
Okay, we don’t use this icon unless we have to. When you see this icon, we’re
flagging some information that’s more technical and nerdy than the rest of the
text. You might find the information really cool and very interesting, despite
being technical, so read it at your discretion.
When you see this icon, we show you how to use Google’s powerful search fea-
tures to help you find e-mail messages, calendar events, and so on by using
the Search text box at the top of each Google Apps window.

Google Apps For Dummies 

Where to Go from Here
Hey, users! If you’re somewhat timid with software or your computer skills,
start with Chapter 3 and read through Chapter 13 to get up to speed with
each app. Don’t be afraid to challenge yourself and try some of the advanced
instructions, as well. Trust us — you’ll find any time spent in those chapters
well worth it.
We don’t want to insult your intelligence and go over basic computing skills,
such as highlighting text or using a drop-down list. Instead, we focus on
showing you how to use the apps to do your work.
Hey, administrators! Looking for the technical step-by-step details of setting
up and running Google Apps for your organization? A little concerned about
leaving your old tried-and-traditional software solutions and jumping into
Web 2.0? Start by looking over Part I, then immediately jump to the technical
stuff in Part IV. General users want to avoid this information like a self-
replicating malevolent32 virus. You, on the other hand, should find it as com-
fortable as a walk along the beach — which is where you can vacation by
using the bonus you receive because everyone’s so pleased with how well
Google Apps is working.
One final thought: All you IT administrators may want to scan quickly
through Parts II and III of this book. A quick skim can let you know exactly
where you can send staffers, employees, or students when they have ques-
tions that you may not have time to answer on the spot.

In this part . . .
T
ake a moment to get to know Google Apps, the perfect
complement to your business, group, family, or orga-
nization. In this part, we take you on a quick tour of the
Google Apps editions, and then we help you register a
new domain or point your existing one to Google’s awe-
some services.
If your group or organization is using Google Apps
already, or if you’re a casual Gmail user, we recommend
that you skip ahead and start with Chapter 3.

Chapter 1
Introducing Google Apps
In This Chapter
 Getting acquainted with Google Apps
 Choosing the version of Google Apps that’s right for you
 Discovering the pros and cons of using Google Apps
T
he Internet has evolved, and Google is leading the way. Google began as 
a small Internet search engine experiment, but when the folks at Google
found they had a hit on their hands, they didn’t stop there. Today, you can
keep track of everything, from e-mail to stock portfolios to photos, by using
free services created by the ingenious Googlers (the bright engineers at
Google who work behind the scenes to make the Internet cool and easy for
everyone). Google is pushing forward into new territory with the innovative
Google Apps and taking key functions, such as calendaring and word process-
ing, into the Internet realm.
This chapter gives you a better understanding of how Google Apps works
and helps you choose the version that’s best for your organization. You can
also find out more about Google Apps by visiting www.google.com/a. If
you’re interested in Google Apps for school or work teams, go to www.
google.com/apps instead.
Meeting the Google Apps
With little fanfare, the Mountain View, California, behemoth known as Google
has been building, buying, and beta-testing scores of online applications. And
Google has been releasing them in a flurry, one right after another, to an
unsuspecting world. The first 30 or 40 apps seemed random. It appeared that
any cool idea any Googler could think of was turned into an app and tossed
onto the Internet just for the fun of it. It was a blur. If you blinked, you missed
something. It didn’t seem to have a pattern or a purpose.

With the creation of the Google Apps initiative, the strategy behind the 
software releases came into sharp focus: Google is building a radically differ-
ent way of working that can shatter the primacy of the current methods and
reduce the need for all the tired, old office productivity software on your
hard drive. Oh, and Google provides most of the apps for free or at a fraction
of the cost of traditional software.
Google Apps is a powerful set of tools that Google has bundled together to
meet the needs of businesses, schools, government agencies, and other 
organizations of any size. You can use Google Apps as a powerful digital com-
munications infrastructure for your business or school that Google maintains
for you. (Very sweet.) The key Google Apps are
 Gmail: An e-mail app based on Google’s popular Gmail platform. 
This version lets you use your organization’s domain, such as user@
yourdomain.com.
 Calendar: A calendar and scheduling app that allows easy collaboration.
 Talk: Instant messaging, available directly from within Gmail or as a
standalone software application. Talk also allows voice calls, voice mail,
and file sharing.
 Docs: A simple, yet powerful, set of word processing, spreadsheet, and
presentation apps.
 The Start Page: An app that you can personalize by adding gadgets to
access any or all of the other Google Apps, as well as news, weather
reports, entertainment information, and more from one place.
In addition to the apps themselves, Google provides some powerful tools for
administrators in the Google Apps Dashboard. Features for administrators
include
 Web page creation tools
 Domain settings
 Advanced tools, including administrative support and migration tools
 Individual apps settings
 Custom Web addresses for your Google Apps
 Phone-based support tools
Welcome to the New Internet
Google believes that you want to spend more time doing things with your
organization, family, group, or school in an online environment.
10
Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps 

Called cloud computing, the premise is that users can create, edit, and store
massive amounts of information through the Internet (or “cloud”) with any
device that has a Web browser (such as a computer or cellphone) and
Internet access. The Web applications (or apps, for short), as well as the files
themselves, are stored securely on powerful servers in data centers through-
out the world, as illustrated in Figure 1-1.
Users can share their information with others, including friends and co-
workers, and collaborate in real time on important projects. Because the 
files are already online, a user simply sends a message to his or her friends
that contains a link to a file, and those friends can click the link to see and
contribute to the sender’s great work. Using Google Apps, you don’t need to
send attachments back and forth or keep track of different file versions.
Google Apps brings cloud computing to the masses. And it helps alleviate
some of the issues of traditional computing:
 Cost: Computer hardware and software is expensive. For schools and
businesses alike, buying PCs and servers, and all the software that goes
with them, is making less and less financial sense — especially when it
all becomes obsolete before anyone figures out how to use the new stuff.
These organizations want solutions that can provide a better return on
investment.
 Maintenance: Maintaining all those PCs and the network software is a
pain. Information technology costs even more money and uses a lot of
resources — especially when organizations grow and someone needs to
maintain all those new users.

Chapter 1: Introducing Google Apps

 Hassle: People are tired of installing new software, downloading and
installing updates, backing up files, scanning for viruses, maintaining
firewalls — it’s all a bit much. Most people just want to get their work
done, and most companies want to focus on their real business, not on
information technology. (Unless, of course, their business is information
technology. Those companies love all the hassle.)
So, why not go with Google and leave all the tedious technical stuff to the
people not savvy enough to jump on the Google bandwagon? If you keep your
information in their Internet cloud, you don’t need to buy any servers, load
any software, scan for any viruses, or back anything up. No more rebooting
the server or your PC when the system crashes, again. Everything just works
with a lot less cost, maintenance, and hassle because it’s coming to you
directly from Google.
To put it all into perspective, here’s an analogy for you: Would you rather hide
your life savings under your mattress and risk it being stolen or lost in a fire,
or store it in a bank where you have access to it anytime, anywhere, from an
ATM machine?
In this new, Web-enabled world, your Web browser becomes your ATM, and
Google becomes your bank. You can use your own domain name, company
logo, and all that branded identity stuff to personalize your Google Apps. You
can preserve your corporate, school, or organizational identity and slash
your costs in a dramatic way.
Choosing the Right Google Apps Edition
As we mention in the “Meeting the Google Apps” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, Google Apps consists of four main programs: Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and
Talk. Anyone can use these services without signing up for Google Apps, but
to help organizations replace or complement their existing systems, Google
has some powerful administrative and collaborative tools for those ready to
take the plunge.
You can choose from four Google Apps editions: Team, Standard, Premier,
and Education. Each edition has been customized to meet the needs of differ-
ent types of organizations, large and small:
 Team Edition: This is the easiest way to start using the collaborative
tools available with Google Apps with your school or work team. You
don’t have to change your e-mail address or worry about any adminis-
tration tools. Sign up for free with your existing e-mail address (see
Chapter 2 on how to do this) and you can start connecting with other
people in your domain right away. Gmail is not included in this edition.
12
Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps 

 Standard Edition: Use this edition if you’re a family, group, or small
business. Register or transfer your domain to access Gmail, Calendar,
Talk, Docs, and the Start Page. This version is free (meaning ad-
sponsored) and supported by online help. You can always upgrade 
to Premier Edition later, if you want to.
 Premier Edition: Medium to large organizations should generally use
this edition. At the time of this publication, it costs $50 per user per
year, but you likely currently spend more than that on maintenance of
your existing setup. Because this is a paid edition, you can choose to
turn Gmail ads off. This edition also has additional administration tools
and security settings. Your users receive significantly more storage
space than with the Standard Edition.
 Education Edition: Built for — you guessed it — schools, colleges, and
universities. Nonprofit organizations can also use this version. This ver-
sion is free (although not supported by ads), and it includes many of the
features from the Premier Edition (albeit a little less storage space). If
you’re interested in the Education Edition, Google requires you to pro-
vide proof of accredited not-for-profit status.
The best program is the one that best meets the needs of your organization.
See Chapter 2 to find out how to sign up.

What’s in It for My Organization?
As part of the Google Apps program, Google hosts your e-mail, documents,
spreadsheets, presentations, calendars, and more at little or no cost. A team,
business, school, or organization of any size can have Google Apps up and
running quickly. When you use Google Apps, your IT resources aren’t so
drained because Google takes care of the technical details. Oh, yeah — 
and they keep your information safe and secure.
Here are a few additional features of Google Apps that may grab the attention
of decision makers and your IT department:
 You don’t have to purchase or set up any hardware.
 Because Google Apps are Web-based applications, you don’t need to
download, install, update, or pay for software again when new versions
are released. (Except for a Web browser, of course, and at least you
don’t have to pay for that.)
 Your organization can use its own domain name for e-mail addresses and
Web pages when you use Google Apps.
 Google boasts a 99.9% reliability rate, which means that the service
rarely, if ever, goes down.
 Google takes care of all the data backup and support operations.
 Google provides online support resources for free and gives 24/7 sup-
port — including phone-based support — for Premier Edition and
Education Edition users.
14
Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps 

 You can set up users quickly by using the Dashboard.
 A single sign-on adds convenience for Premier Edition users. Users can
sign in once and access all their Google Apps in addition to other corpo-
rate intranet or school resources.
 Gmail can support an existing e-mail gateway.
 Administrators can access e-mail migration tools for Premier Edition and
Education Edition customers.
 Gmail protects users by constantly updating and running very effective
and efficient spam-blocking, virus-protection, and filtering software.
Don’t forget one of the biggest advantages of using Google Apps: Whether
you’re at the office, traveling, working from home, or sipping a latte in a café
that has a wireless hotspot, as long as you have a live Internet connection,
you can log into your Google Apps account. Also, you can check your e-mail
and do other tasks from your mobile device.
Can There Possibly Be a Downside?
If using Google Apps has any disadvantages, they mostly revolve around your
personal relationship with your Internet connection. Assuming you do have a
decent connection (something high-speed in nature is best), you’re good to
go. If you don’t have an Internet connection, we recommend you put this
book down, buy another book — we recommend Writing on Stone Tablets For
Dummies — and take up activities that don’t require the use of electricity.
You must be online to use Google Apps. Checking your e-mail, updating your
calendar, and collaborating on a document require online interactivity. Google
Apps doesn’t work without an Internet connection. Internet connection speed
is important, too: Google Apps does work over dial-up connections, but it’s
soooo slow. (Nevertheless, you can always connect with dial-up when you’re
away from your high-speed connection.)
When deciding whether to use Google Apps, remember that all these services
are in perpetual beta, meaning that unlike traditional software that gets a new,
big update every year or so, Google is constantly updating its services and
adding new features. Although the most common features are fully imple-
mented, you should check to make sure that the features your organization
needs are available. (Along those lines, you may occasionally notice a slight
difference between what you see on your screen and what you see in the fig-
ures in this book if Google made an update after this book was published.)
15
Chapter 1: Introducing Google Apps

The upside, of course, to the perpetual beta model is that by the time the fea-
tures of the new version have been rolled out, Google Apps users are already
familiar with the changes, so you have to deal with only a minimal learning
curve. When you and your fellow users get up to speed, you just need to keep
using the products to stay up to date. And keeping ahead of the curve is an
advantage, all by itself.

Signing Up for Google Apps
In This Chapter
 Getting online with Team Edition
 Starting with Standard Edition
 Upgrading to Premier Edition
 Using Education Edition for your school or nonprofit organization
 Proving that you own your domain
W
ouldn’t you know it, your good fortune has led you to the most excit-
ing chapter in the book! You’re either dipping in your big toe to test
the water, or you’re ready to make the cannonball that gets the pool party
started. Either way, we take you through the steps of setting up Google Apps
for your team or organization and show you how simple the setup process is.
(Okay, you can find a couple not-so-simple sets of steps at the end of this
chapter, but we guide you through those steps in a breeze, too.)
Because no two organizations are the same, this chapter helps you register
for the edition of Google Apps that best fits your organization’s needs. Each
edition has its own unique registration requirements that we discuss in each
edition’s section in this chapter.
Chapter 1 provides a detailed breakdown of features available in each edition
of Google Apps. Here’s our quick advice about choosing among the different
editions of Google Apps:
 Use Google Apps Team Edition to get your school team or work group
collaborating online in a snap, without having to register a domain
name. All you need to sign up is a school or work e-mail address. The
very next section of this chapter will take you through the setup.
 If you own a small business or plan to use Google Apps for your family
or group, you probably want to use Google Apps Standard Edition. 
You likely won’t need the advanced features and support (and cost) 
of Premier Edition. Also, if you don’t already have a domain name, 
sign up for Standard Edition first. You can then upgrade to Premier or
Education Edition later. Follow the instructions in the “Signing Up 
for Standard Edition,” later in this chapter.

 If you’re the IT administrator or decision maker for a medium to large
business or enterprise, we recommend that you skip ahead to the 
section “Signing Up for Premier Edition,” later in this chapter. Premier
Edition has the added migration and security tools, APIs, and support
that your larger organization needs. You will need to have an existing
domain name to register for Premier Edition.
 If you’re the techie for your school, school district, or nonprofit organi-
zation, you get most of the benefits of Premier Edition for free with the
Education Editions. You will need to have an existing EDUCAUSE or
other domain name to sign up for Education Edition. Otherwise, you
should start with Standard Edition. Flip to the “Signing Up for Education
Edition” section, near the end of this chapter. We wrote it for you.
Although everything in this chapter was accurate when this book went to
press, Google is constantly updating. By the time you register for your
chosen edition of Google Apps, you may notice slight differences between
what you see on your screen and the steps and figures in this chapter.
Signing Up for Team Edition
Are you ready to bring your team up to speed? Follow the steps in this sec-
tion to set up your own Google Apps account and then invite your fellow
team members to join in on the fun:
1. Open your Web browser and navigate to www.google.com/apps for
work teams or www.google.com/apps/edu for students.
You see a screen similar to Figure 2-1.
2. In the Email text box, enter your work or school e-mail address and
click the Get Started button.
A sign-up screen appears.
3. Fill in all the text boxes (they’re all required) and click the I Accept.
Continue to Google Apps button at the bottom of the screen.
The Email Verification screen appears, telling you to verify that you own
your e-mail account.
If you already have a Google account associated with your work or school
e-mail address, all new calendar and document invitations will go to
your Google Apps account. You’re given the option to migrate your 
existing calendar events and documents into your new account when
you log into these services for the first time.
4. Log into your work or school e-mail account and open the message
titled Google Apps: Sign-up Verification.
The e-mail message looks similar to Figure 2-2.
18

customizing your domain’s appearance in Chapter 14 for more details.
Table 2-1 has all the quick links you need to get back into your apps. Just
replace yourdomain.com with your actual work or school domain. If you
forget these, look for a Welcome e-mail message from Google that contains
these links.

Signing Up for Standard Edition
If you’re a small business owner or decision maker who’s taking the initiative,
this section is for you.
The easiest way to start using Google Apps is to start from scratch and register
a shiny new domain name. A domain is the address for your Web site or the part
of an e-mail address that follows the @ sign (such as www.yourdomain.com or
jdoe@yourdomain.net). If you want to register a new domain name for
your organization, head to the following section. If your organization already
has a Web address, skip ahead to the section “Signing up and migrating an
existing domain,” later in this chapter.
After you register your domain name with Google and create an administra-
tor account, you can begin using Google Apps. In Part IV of this book, we 
go more in depth into setting up users, creating your own Web pages, and
customizing your organization’s personalized Start Page.
Signing up and registering a new domain
So, you have a business or group but don’t have a Web address yet. You’re
not alone. Organizations may not have a Web site because setting one up and
maintaining it was very difficult in the past. First, you had to register a
domain and find a place to host it (which either cost a lot of money or forced
you to display annoying banner advertisements). After that, you had to use
complicated software to create your site, and you could only hope that your
software would connect with your host. And that’s not even getting into set-
ting up other programs for features such as e-mail and calendars.
Google Apps changes all that. With Google, you can register a new domain in
three steps: choose a domain, sign up for Google Apps, and create an admin-
istrator account.
You pay ten dollars per year to register a domain name with one of Google’s
domain registration partners. You need a credit card to sign up for Google Apps
with a new domain.
21
Chapter 2: Signing Up for Google Apps

The toughest part of signing up for Google Apps is finding the right domain
name. A lot of other people have already registered many of the more
common names, so don’t be surprised if someone has already taken the first
name that you think of. You might have to be a little creative if someone has
already taken your first choice for a domain name.
Follow these steps to register a new domain name and sign up for Google
Apps Standard Edition:
1. Go to www.google.com/a and click the Businesses and Employees
button or the Organizations and Members button on the right side of
the page. Then, on the next screen, click the blue Compare Editions
and Sign Up button in the top-right corner.
2. In the Standard Edition column, click the blue Sign Up button.
The Google Apps Sign Up screen appears. You can enter an existing
domain name (if you already have one) by clicking the I Want to Use an
Existing Domain Name tab or register for a new domain name by clicking
the I Want to Buy a Domain Name tab, as shown in Figure 2-4.
3. Click the I Want to Buy a Domain Name tab (on the right side of the
screen), enter the domain name that you want in the text box, and
select a top-level domain (for example, .com or .net) from the 
drop-down list.
Figure 2-4:

Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps 

A top-level domain (TLD) is the last part of a domain name. The most
common TLD, .com, is primarily used for commercial businesses. Many
businesses are also using .biz now. Depending on what your organiza-
tion does, you can choose other TLDs, also. Use .net or .info for an
information-only site, such as a blog or group site. The TLD .org is gen-
erally used by nonprofit organizations.
4. Click the Check Availability button.
If someone has already taken the domain name that you want, Google
suggests other related names that are available, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4, trying different words or names until you find an
available one that works for you.
5. When you find an available domain name that works for you, click the
Continue to Registration button.
Have your personal information and credit card ready.
6. In the form, click in the text boxes and enter your personal 
information.
Make sure you select the Automatically Renew My Registration Every
Year check box to ensure that your domain name doesn’t expire and
leave you without your e-mail and other services. Google automatically
bills your credit card on the same day that you originally registered your
domain name. You can always cancel the service later.

Google Account to Complete This Purchase and enter the appropriate
information, and then click the Agree and Continue button at the
bottom of the screen.
Google Checkout allows you to store your credit card information in one
place. If you haven’t used Google Checkout with your Google account
before, Google gives you the option to save your billing information for
future Internet purchases. You can find out more about Google Checkout
at http://google.com/checkout.
9. Review your order, then click Place Your Order Now — $10.00.
Google sends you a receipt by e-mail, along with instructions to access
your account.
10. On the next screen click the Click Here to Retrieve Your Purchase
link. You can also log into your e-mail account later and click the link
in the message from Google to access the Dashboard.
The last thing that you need to do to register for Google Apps is to
create an administrator account. You need an administrator account to
access the Google Apps Dashboard and create additional users.

registered your domain name through Google, your Gmail and Calendar
should be ready for you to use in a few moments, although it may take up 
to 24 hours for all the services to activate.
Signing up and migrating 
an existing domain
Like so many other organizations out there, you have a Web site, and you’re
ready to trade your old set of e-mail and Web services for the power and ease
of Google Apps. Just follow these three steps to register your domain with
Google Apps: Enter your existing domain name, sign up and create an admin-
istrator account (both of which we cover in this section), and verify your
domain ownership (described in the “Verifying Domain Ownership” section,
later in this chapter). Have your original domain registration information
(either your Web site’s FTP address and login, or your domain registrar’s
address and login) handy for that third part.
Follow these steps to sign up for Google Apps Standard Edition by using your
existing domain name:
1. Go to www.google.com/a and click the Businesses and Employees
button or the Organizations and Members button on the right side of
the page. Then, on the next screen, click the blue Compare Editions

Signing Up for Education Edition
We’re so glad that your school or nonprofit organization is making the move
to Google Apps. Google Apps can make life easier for teachers, students, and
volunteers alike with its powerful tools.
You need to follow only two steps to register your domain for Education
Edition: Sign up for Google Apps and set up an administrator account. Google
contacts you by e-mail to verify your eligibility. In the meantime, you can
verify that you own your domain name by following the instructions in the
“Verifying Your Domain” section, later in this chapter.
Make sure that you’re an administrator for your school or organization. If you
can’t access your domain information to verify ownership, you (or your
administrator) will find signing up for Google Apps impossible.
Signing up for Education Edition is a breeze! Just follow these steps:
1. Go to www.google.com/a and click the Schools and Students button
on the right side of the page. Then, on the next screen, click the blue
Compare Editions and Sign Up button in the top-right corner.
2. In the Education Edition column, click the blue Sign Up button. On the
next screen, select the Administrators: I Own or Control This Domain
radio button, enter your domain name in the text box below, and then
click the Get Started button.
A screen similar to Figure 2-10 appears, asking you to fill out your organi-
zation information.
29
Chapter 2: Signing Up for Google Apps

3. Click in the text boxes and enter your school’s information, then click
the Continue button.
You need to create an administrator account to access the Google Apps
Dashboard and Google’s migration tools to help you transition your
existing users.
4. Enter a username and password for yourself (if you’re going to be the
administrator) or for the person whom you want to administer your
account.
5. Click the I Accept. Continue with Set Up button to open your
Dashboard.
Piece of cake! Now, grab your domain registration information and continue
to the following section.
Verifying Domain Ownership
To prevent abuse, Google requires you to verify that you actually own the
domain you register within 30 days of signing up for Google Apps. You can’t
use any of the services until you verify ownership, so we recommend that
you do it immediately after you register for your chosen edition of Google
Apps.
Figure 2-10:
Fill in your
school or
nonprofit
organization
information.
30
Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps 

If you don’t verify domain ownership within 30 days, Google removes your
domain from its system and you will have to sign up for Google Apps all over
again.
You have two ways to verify your domain ownership:
 The easy way: Verify your domain ownership by uploading an HTML file
to your existing Web server. You need the FTP (file transfer protocol)
address for your Web server, as well as your login name and password. 
If you don’t have access to your Web server, use the next method.
 The not-so-easy way: Verify your domain ownership by making changes
to your DNS (domain name server) entries using your current registrar.
You need your domain registrar’s address (such as www.godaddy.com
or www.networksolutions.com), your login name, and your password.
If you don’t have access to this information, you need to find the person who
does. Otherwise, you may want to rummage through your desk drawers or
e-mail folders to locate your account information. If changing these settings
makes you nervous, you may want to bring in your IT administrator or com-
puter guru.
You need to change your DNS settings when you set up your Gmail service
later (we cover this in Chapter 17). If you lost your registrar login informa-
tion, contact your registrar’s support center. You can find your domain’s 
registrar by going to www.who.is and searching for your domain name.
Uploading an HTML file
You can easily verify your domain by uploading an HTML file. Google gives
you a special key, and if you can upload it to your server as a specific HTML
file, Google can see that you’re really the owner of the domain. Be sure to
have your FTP login information handy and follow these steps:
1. Sign into your Google Apps Dashboard, if you aren’t there already.
If you just registered, you should be at the Dashboard. If you’re coming
back to it, go to http://google.com/a/yourdomain.com (replace
yourdomain.com with your actual domain name), click in the Username
and Password text boxes on the left side of the screen and enter your
username and password, respectively, then click the Sign In button. Your
screen should look like Figure 2-11.
2. Click the Verify Domain Ownership link at the top of the screen.
3. Select Upload an HTML File from the drop-down list in the Verify Your
Domain Ownership section.
Your screen should look like Figure 2-12.
31
Chapter 2: Signing Up for Google Apps

4. Highlight the text located in the page’s Step 1, right-click, and select
Copy from the contextual menu that appears.
5. Open Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) and paste the code into a
new, blank document.
6. Choose File➪Save.
Figure 2-12:
Copy this
code and
then paste 
it into an

32
Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps 

7. In the Save As dialog box that appears, click in the File Name text box
and type googlehostedservice.html, navigate to your desktop (or some
other easy-to-find location on your computer), and click the Save
button.
Make sure the HTML file is named googlehostedservice.html.
Otherwise, Google can’t verify it.
8. Log into your Web server by using your FTP address and open your
Web folder as follows:
• In Windows Explorer, type the address in the address bar, like this:
ftp://username@ftp.yourdomain.com (replacing the italic words
with your username and domain name). Press Enter. A login window
appears. Enter your username and password in the corresponding
text boxes and click the Log On button.
• On a Mac, open an FTP client, such as Fetch (www.fetchsoft
works.com). Click the New Connection button, and then enter
your hostname (ftp://ftp.yourdomain.com), your username,
and your password in the corresponding text boxes. Click the
Connect button.
It is important that you upload your .html file to the Web folder,
otherwise verification won’t work. The Web folder usually contains
an index.htm or default.html file, as shown in Figure 2-13. If
you don’t see either of these files in the Web server when you log
on, look for the Web folder. It is sometimes called www, pub, or
public_html.
9. Find the googlehostedservice.html file on your computer and
drag it to your Web server, as shown in Figure 2-13.
Figure 2-13:
Drag your
HTML file 
to your FTP
server.
33
Chapter 2: Signing Up for Google Apps

10. Go back to your Web browser and click the www.yourdomain.
com/googlehostedservice.html link in the Verify Your Domain
Ownership page’s Step 2 (refer to Figure 2-12).
The code that you copy in Step 4 of this list should appear in the top-left
corner of the screen. If you don’t see it, repeat Steps 3 through 9 and
make sure you name the googlehostedservice.html file correctly
and place it in the correct Web folder.
11. If the text you copy in Step 4 appears on the page, return to the Verify
Your Domain Ownership page and click the Verify button.
Hooray! You’ve successfully completed your domain verification and you
should return to your Dashboard. Now, you just need to wait for Google to
verify your domain. (Google usually verifies your domain in a few minutes,
but it can take up to 48 hours.) After Google verifies your domain, a message
appears along the top of your Dashboard, and you can then activate all your
apps.
Take a quick coffee break — you deserve it! When you come back, flip to
Chapter 14, where we help you find your way around the Dashboard and
show you how to create additional users. You don’t really want to keep this
goodness all to yourself, do you?
Changing your CNAME record
Well, you’re a brave soul. This process takes you through connecting your
domain to Google Apps using your registrar’s control panel. On the bright
side, you can use this opportunity to adjust all your other domain settings 
if you like. While you’re on your registrar’s site, you might want to complete
the steps in the section about creating custom apps addresses in Chapter 17.
Ready? Here we go:
1. Sign into your Google Apps Dashboard, if you haven’t already.
If you just registered, you should be at the Dashboard. If you’re coming
back to it, go to http://google.com/a/yourdomain.com (replace
yourdomain.com with your actual domain name), click in the Username
and Password text boxes and enter your username and password,
respectively, and then click the Sign In button. The Dashboard opens.
(Refer to Figure 2-11.)
2. Click the Verify Domain Ownership link at the top of the screen.
3. Select Change Your CNAME Record from the drop-down list in the
Verify Your Domain Ownership section.
Your screen should look like Figure 2-14.
34
Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps 

4. Highlight the unique string located in the Verify Your Domain
Ownership page’s Step 2, right-click, and select Copy from the contex-
tual menu that appears.
5. In a new browser tab or window, log into your domain registrar’s Web
site and look for a page that is titled either DNS Management or DNS
Control Panel.
This page displays a list of your CNAME entries, like the page shown in
Figure 2-15.
If you have trouble finding the DNS management page, contact your reg-
istrar’s support center. They can tell you exactly where you need to go.
6. In either the CNAME or Alias section (whichever appears on your DNS
page), click the link or button to add or create a new CNAME (the
name of the link or button varies, depending on your registrar).
7. In the Alias Name text box, paste the unique string that you copied in
Step 4. Remember: Remove any extra spaces that may be in the
unique string.
8. Click in either the Host Name or Points To text box and type
google.com.
9. If there is a text box or drop-down list for TTL, enter the default value
(usually 1 Hour) and click OK.
Figure 2-14:

35
Chapter 2: Signing Up for Google Apps

10. Return to the Google Apps Dashboard and click the first link in the
Verify Your Domain Ownership page’s Step 4.
If you configured the correct CNAME record with your registrar, the link
loads Google’s main search page. If the Google search page doesn’t
appear, your CNAME record isn’t correct. Try repeating Steps 3 
through 10.
11. If clicking the link correctly loads www.google.com, click the Verify
button.
That’s it! You’ve successfully registered for Google Apps and completed your
domain verification. Google may take up to 48 hours to verify your domain. A
message appears along the top of your Dashboard after Google has officially
verified you, and you can then activate all your apps.

The Start Page
In This Chapter
 Getting to know your Start Page
 Logging in for the first time
 Adding gadgets
 Dealing with Start Page problems
You can find a lot of information out there on the Internet. Wouldn’t it be
nice to bring your e-mail, news headlines, and games all together in one
place? Well, you can with one of the most important Google Apps — the Start
Page.
The Start Page is based on the popular iGoogle personalized page (www.
google.com/ig) offered to normal Google users. If you’ve used iGoogle
before, you’ll be right at home with the Start Page. In fact, a lot of what we
cover in this chapter can be helpful to anyone who wants to make the most
of iGoogle, as well.
With the Start Page, you can display all the information that’s useful to you in
a single location. Little Web programs called gadgets make this setup possible.
Gadgets are essentially mini Web pages created to show specific information,
such as news or weather. The Start Page is fully customizable, so you can
choose which gadgets you see and interact with. You don’t have a limit to the
number of gadgets you can add to your Start Page.
To help you out, Google maintains a whole directory of gadgets that let you
see and interact with your e-mail, calendar, documents, chat contacts, weather,
sports, news headlines, snippets from your favorite Web sites, mini-games,
comic strips, YouTube videos, and a plethora of other useful or fun stuff.
After you add gadgets to your page, you can move them around to create 
the perfect launch pad for all your Google Apps and beyond.
In this chapter, we show you how to access your Start Page, help you authen-
ticate your Google Apps account when you log in for the first time, add and
remove gadgets to your Start Page, and help you resolve some basic Start
Page issues.

If you are an administrator and want to customize the Start Page template for
your group or organization, check out Chapter 15.
Meeting the Start Page
When your organization makes the switch to Google Apps, you should receive
your username and password from your administrator. Sometimes, this infor-
mation comes in an e-mail message to your old e-mail account, or you may
receive a printout directly from your administrator in the mail. The instruc-
tions include your username, a temporary password, your e-mail address,
and the Start Page address for any new Google Apps account, as shown in
Figure 3-1.
You can always check with your administrator if you haven’t received your
login information or have forgotten your password.
If you haven’t received your login information, you can still follow along with
the setup process outlined in this chapter, but you have to make all your
changes again after you log in.
Open your Web browser and navigate to your organization’s Start Page. The
default address will look something like http://start.yourdomain.com.
You can also access your page at http://partnerpage.google.com/
yourdomain.com (replace yourdomain.com with your organization’s
domain name).
Your administrator has likely already set up a custom Start Page template 
for your organization. A typical Start Page has a search box and three cus-
tomizable columns, as shown in Figure 3-2. Your administrator has the option
to lock the left column (for example, if that column contains links to company
Figure 3-1:
Your system
administrat-
or gives you
a username
and
temporary
password.
38
Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps 

procedures or announcements) so that you can’t edit it. If the gadgets in the
left column are a different color than the rest of the gadgets or they won’t
move when you try to change them, that column is locked. You can’t close
gadgets in a locked column either because they don’t have an X button.
Take a moment to familiarize yourself with your Start Page. When you’re
ready to start customizing it, click the Sign In link in the top-right corner. On
the next screen, enter your username and password in the Username and
Password text boxes, respectively, and click the Sign In button.
Authenticating Your Account
Before you begin using any of the Google Apps for the first time, you may
need to authenticate your account. Authentication tells the system that
you’re a real user. It also lets your administrator know that you’re able to log
into your Google Apps account. If you’ve successfully logged in before, feel
free to jump ahead to the following section.
To authenticate your account, follow these steps:
1. Open your Web browser and navigate to your organization’s Start
Page (for example, http://start.ardsleybooks.com).
2. Click the Sign In link in the top-right corner.
Figure 3-2:
The Start
Page has
three
columns.
39
Chapter 3: The Start Page

3. Enter your username and temporary password in the Username and
Password text boxes, respectively, and then click the Sign In button.
The authentication screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.
4. Enter a new password in the Choose a Password text box and then
enter it again in the Re-enter Password text box.
Choose a password that people can’t easily guess or figure out. Because
you need at least six characters, we recommend you use a mix of upper-
and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to make your password
harder to guess or crack. The password strength bar on the authentica-
tion screen helps you see how strong and secure your password is.
Green is good!
5. Select your language from the Language drop-down list.
6. Click in the text box below the jumbled letters and enter the letters
that you see.
If you have difficulty interpreting the letters, don’t worry — they confuse
a lot of other people too. You may have to try it once or twice before you
get it just right. The wheelchair icon to the right of the text box will help
users with visual impairment by playing an audio version of the jumbled
letters.
7. Scroll down to the bottom of the screen, read the Terms of Use policy
(it’s the fine print inside the box), and click the I Accept. Create My
Account button.
If authentication works correctly, you’re taken back to your own, shiny new
Start Page. If the authentication doesn’t work, try repeating the steps in the
preceding list a few times, correcting the fields that are highlighted in red.
Figure 3-3:

password
and

account.
40
Part I: Up and Going with Google Apps 

After you’ve been thoroughly frustrated by those pesky jumbled letters, ask
your administrator for help if authentication still doesn’t work. Be sure to 
let your administrator know which step is giving you issues.
Adding Google Gadgets
Adding Google Gadgets is a snap. Google maintains a directory of hundreds
of gadgets that companies and users have created. Those gadgets put the
information that’s useful to you at your fingertips. In the following sections,
we introduce you to the Google gadget directory, help you customize your
Start Page, and show you how to use the gadgets for key Google Apps.
Before you start playing around with your Start Page gadgets, be sure that
you’re logged in. If you aren’t, you have to make the changes all over again
the next time you come to the Start Page.
You can easily set your Start Page as your home page. In Firefox, load your
Start Page and then choose Tools➪Options; in the Options dialog box that
appears, select the Main tab, click the Use Current Page button, and click OK.
In Internet Explorer, load your Start Page and then choose Tools➪Internet
Options; in the Internet Options dialog box that appears, select the General
tab, click the Use Current button, and click OK.

Chapter 3: The Start Page
Gadgets demystified
Google Gadgets are made up of little pieces of
code (such as HTML, JavaScript, Flash, and
XML) and are designed to accomplish specific
tasks, such as display a clock, calculator, or
game. The idea behind gadgets isn’t new. The
original Macs had little computer applications
called desk accessories, such as Calculator,
Note Pad, and Puzzle. PDAs, such as the Palm
Treo, also use these mini apps. As computers
have become more interactive and Internet-
enabled, computer operating systems and
mobile devices have incorporated gadgets.
Macs now use Dashboard widgets. Windows
Vista has gadgets. Yahoo! Widgets and Google
Desktop both allow users to add gadgets to their
computers. Even your iPhone uses gadgets.
With iGoogle and the Google Start Page, anyone
can choose the gadgets they want and access
them from any Web browser. What do you want
to make your gadgets do?

Checking out the gadget directory
To access the gadget directory, click the Add Stuff link near the top of the
Start Page. The directory looks similar to Figure 3-4 (the items that appear
vary because Google adds new gadgets all the time). When you find a gadget
you like, click the Add It Now button just below the gadget to place it on your
Start Page (you can always remove it later).
The main gadget categories, which you can access by clicking a category
name in the left column, are as follows:
 Custom Sections: If your administrator has added custom gadgets, such
as organization links, company calendars, and so on, you can find them
here.
 Google Apps: Add gadgets for Gmail, Google Docs, Google Talk, and
Google Calendar to give yourself one-click access from your Start Page.
(Later in this section, we show you how to use and customize these 
gadgets.)
 Popular: Find gadgets that other people use a lot, such as weather and
photo albums.
 News: Keep track of the latest headlines from your favorite news service,
such as CNN or BBC News.
 Tools: Need to find information? Here, you can add dictionaries,
Wikipedia, to-do lists, and more.

more than you thought you would — click the Back to Homepage link at the
top of the page to return to your Start Page.
Back on the Start Page, you can use the small buttons on the gadget title bar
to customize your gadgets, as shown in Figure 3-5. Here’s what the buttons do:
 Down-arrow: Click the down-arrow in the title bar of the gadget to show
a list of options. Click Edit Settings from the list to make basic gadget
adjustments, if they’re available. After you make your changes, click
Save. You can also use this list to find similar gadgets or find out more
about the gadget’s creator.
 Hide/Show: Clicking the minus button minimizes your gadget and shows
only the title bar. Click the plus button to make your gadget reappear.
Sorry, you can’t minimize gadgets that show up in the locked column.
 Close: Click the X button to remove the gadget from your Start Page. Go
back to the gadget directory if you want to add that gadget again later.
When you click this button, a yellow bar appears below the main search
box that lets you undo the removal if you clicked the button by accident.

Creating your perfect layout
After you add the gadgets that will (hopefully) help you be more productive
(see the preceding section for how to add gadgets), you can practice your
organizational skills and move the gadgets where you want them.
To move a gadget, simply click and drag the gadget’s title bar to the location
you want, as shown in Figure 3-6. When you move the gadget, a dashed box
will follow your gadget around the page and move the other gadgets out of
your way so you know exactly what your new arrangement will look like. 
Find the location that you want and release the mouse button. That’s it!

pretty simply. Try each of the following troubleshooting options to restore
your Start Page to a peaceful state:
 Restart your Web browser. Close all your browser windows, wait a
moment, and then open your browser again. Return to your Start Page.
 Remove the troublesome gadget and add it again from the gadget
directory. Gadgets are updated from time to time, so if you find a bug,
replacing the gadget usually fixes it.
 Clear your browser’s cache. Sometimes, the files in your browser cache
become corrupted. In Firefox, choose Tools➪Clear Private Data; in the
Clear Private Data dialog box that appears, select the Cache check box,
and then click the Clear Private Data Now button. Restart Firefox. In
Internet Explorer, choose Tools➪Internet Options; on the General tab in
the Internet Options dialog box that appears, click the Delete button 
in the Browsing History section. In the Delete Browsing History dialog
box that appears, click the Delete Files button. Restart Internet Explorer.

H
ave you ever felt besieged by e-mail as you go through the daily ritual
of purging your Inbox? Messages appear unrelentingly. Many are trivial,
others are inane, and then you have spam — unsolicited ads for products too
bizarre to mention. You have to deal with the time-consuming tasks of sifting
through your Inbox for important messages and filing away old messages so
you can find them later. You also have to decide what messages to delete so
you don’t exceed your mailbox size limit.
Responding to e-mail can eat into your day, taking valuable time away from
more important tasks, such as enjoying a leisurely lunch. For businesses,
schools, and agencies, e-mail has become a necessary evil. It’s costly to main-
tain, and the service level, software quality, and reliability often suffer from a
potential lack of resources.
Gmail is Google’s answer to the daily e-mail onslaught. It’s Google’s interpre-
tation of how e-mail should work. Gmail can help you battle back and get con-
trol of your Inbox, eliminating many of the frustrations associated with the
spam-clogged, virus-ridden e-mail systems of the past.
In this chapter, we get you up and running quickly with Gmail. We start by
explaining some of the innovations that make Gmail unique, and then we 
run you through the basics. In Chapter 5, you can find out about Gmail’s
advanced searching, sorting, archiving, and filtering solutions. Chapters 6
and 7 build your expertise with Gmail’s Contacts list, built-in chat tool, and
the related Google Talk App.
Sorry, Team Edition users, you’re stuck with your old e-mail system — for
now. If you like Gmail, talk to the decision makers at your school or work-
place about how cool it would be if everyone used Gmail, and maybe they’ll
make the switch to Google Apps!

Setting Up E-mail
An e-mail is a message sent electronically over the Internet. Messages can go
from one person to another or from one person to a group. Electronic mail
finds its way through the Internet by following an address. Every e-mail
address has three parts, as shown in Figure 4-1:
 The username, nickname, buddy name, or handle of the account owner.
 The characteristic @ sign (pronounced “at”).
 The name of the domain or Web site that hosts the e-mail service.
If your organization has Google Apps running, you probably already have
your username and password, which means you can start using Gmail imme-
diately. (Check with your administrator if you don’t have this information.)
Even though Google’s servers save all your incoming and outgoing messages,
your e-mail address probably carries the name of your company, school, or
organization. Normally, your username serves as the prefix for your e-mail
address, followed by @ and your organization’s domain name, as shown in
Figure 4-1. If your system is set up differently, talk to your system administra-
tor to find out the specifics about your Google Apps implementation.

Gmail: Safe and sound
Every business and organization in every corner
of the globe needs reliable e-mail. Google
servers are running 99.99 percent of the time —
which is great by any standard. Gmail is not
stored on someone’s computer or on a local
server, so if your computer gets lost with your
luggage at Denver International Airport or the
battery blows up and torches your laptop, no
worries! You just need any computer with an
Internet connection, and you’re right back in
business.
To keep the mail safe and working trouble-free,
Google stores and maintains Gmail in its
immense data centers. Even if your local servers
crash, again, no worries! Google redundantly
backs up all Gmail as a precaution on other
Google servers dotted around the world, so it’s
highly unlikely that Gmail will ever lose your
e-mail.

Before you begin using Gmail for the first time, you may need to authenticate
your account. Flip back to Chapter 3 to discover how to do this authentication.
Starting Gmail
You can get to your Gmail account in a couple of ways. The most convenient
method is to use the Email gadget on your organization’s Start Page (we
describe the Email gadget in Chapter 3). With the Email gadget, you can view
recent messages and access some common Gmail tools directly from your
Start Page. You can also load Gmail by clicking the Inbox link or the Email
gadget title. If you don’t want to use your Start Page, you can load your 
organization’s Gmail address directly in your browser, as described in the
“Starting Gmail directly” section.
Opening Gmail from a Start Page gadget
Open your browser and navigate to your Start Page. After you come to your
Start Page, look for the Email gadget, shown in Figure 4-2. As we describe in
Chapter 3, you may find this gadget very useful. It allows you to monitor
incoming e-mail messages without actually having to open Gmail itself. If you

Chapter 4: Connecting with Gmail
Blame Ray!
If you want to blame someone for your daily
deluge of Inbox-clogging e-mail, Ray Tomlinson
is as good a candidate as anyone. He single-
handedly created e-mail long before the World
Wide Web was even a glimmer in Tim Berners-
Lee’s eye. In fact, e-mail is one of the oldest
Internet applications still in widespread use.
Back in 1971, Ray Tomlinson successfully tested
the first use of e-mail while working on the
Department of Defense’s ARPANET project. The
early supercomputers used a program called
SNDMSG (short for SeND MeSsaGe). Techni-
cians, such as Tomlinson, used that program to
leave messages for their colleagues working on
the same supercomputer. Thompson figured out
a way to make SNDMSG work between super-
computers over the supercomputing network.
Tomlinson calculated that a network username
could serve as a prefix, such as calredwood,
and the network domain name counted as a
suffix, such as ardsleybooks.com. He sep-
arated the two names by an @, creating the very
effective user e-mail addressing system that 
we use today; for example, calredwood@
ardsleybooks.com.
Tomlinson’s colleagues liked his idea and
started using the innovation, thus piloting one of
the most revolutionary technologies in history.
Tomlinson, however, remained low-key about
his impact on history, probably because he
didn’t want to get blamed for all the spam that
soon followed. For the record, Tomlinson didn’t
invent spam. But we know who did.

see a message that you want to reply to quickly, just click it, and you can
send an instant reply. However, if you decide you need to do more than send
a few quick replies, click the Inbox link, and the fully featured version of
Gmail opens.
If you want to view your personal (as in, nonwork) Google Apps and gadgets
in a personalized Start Page with your own Gmail address, you can set one up
by taking advantage of iGoogle (www.google.com/ig). Check out Chapter 3
to find out more about setting up a Start Page for your own personal Google
Apps.
Starting Gmail directly
If, for some reason, you don’t want to use your organization’s Start Page, you
can access your e-mail directly by typing mail and the domain name of your
organization in the address bar and pressing Enter; for example, an employee
of Ardsley Books types the address mail.ardsleybooks.com. This address
takes you to your Gmail login page, as shown in Figure 4-3. On this page, you
can log into your e-mail account directly.
You need to log in with your username and password every time you begin a
new session of Gmail unless you select the Remember Me on This Computer
check box.

Getting to Know the Inbox
When you open Gmail, you go directly to your Inbox. Any message coming to
you first arrives in your Inbox. From your Inbox, you can access any feature
within Gmail by using the navigation panel on the left side of the screen 
and the other links all around the page. Here are the key parts, as shown in
Figure 4-4:
 Links to other Google Apps: Quickly jump to your Start Page, Calendar,
Documents, and more by clicking the links at the top-left corner of the
screen.
 Your e-mail address: In case you forget, Gmail gives you a friendly
reminder up at the top.
If you have more than one Gmail account, you can always tell which
account you’re currently using by looking at your e-mail address at the
top of the Gmail window.
 Search Mail and Search the Web: Enter a term in the text box and click
the Search Mail button to search your messages for the term; click the
Search the Web button to do a normal Google search.
 Compose Mail: Click this link to open a message window in which to
write a new e-mail message.
 Inbox, Starred, Chats, Sent Mail, Drafts, All Mail, Spam, Trash: These
links take you to the standard folders that hold your messages.
Figure 4-3:
Go directly
to your
e-mail’s
login page.
55
Chapter 4: Connecting with Gmail

 Incoming messages: Your messages appear in the center of the screen,
and any new messages appear in bold. Messages that you’ve already
read have a shaded background.
 Labels: The equivalent of folders for Sent Mail, Drafts, Trash, and so on.
If you have created your own folders to organize your e-mail, these fold-
ers appear under the Labels heading.
The basic parts of the Inbox, described in the preceding list, are pretty stan-
dard fare for e-mail applications. What makes Gmail different (and better)
than other e-mail applications is that it gives more than 6GB (gigabytes) of
storage to all Standard and Education Edition users, and 25GB of storage for
Premier Edition participants. Having such large personal storage capacity,
and applying the power of the Google search engine to your e-mail, allows for
a few changes in how you handle your e-mail:
 Don’t trash your messages. Gmail encourages users to archive old mes-
sages, not trash them. With so much storage available, you don’t need to
delete messages that may have any possible importance later.
 Start a conversation. Gmail organizes e-mail into conversations by keep-
ing track of whom you send e-mail to, what they say in response, and
what you say to their replies. Gmail’s conversation tracking is so unique
that we dedicate the section “Following the Conversation” to it, later in
this chapter.
Figure 4-4:

everything

56
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

 Search instead of playing hide and seek. With so many messages piling
up day after day, you may have trouble finding a specific message in
your incessantly swelling Inbox. No longer. Gmail takes advantage of
Google’s search technologies. If Google can find exactly what you need
from the billions of pages on the Internet, imagine what it can do when
searching a relatively tiny Inbox.
Composing Mail
When you’re ready to send an e-mail, click the Compose Mail link in the left
column of your Inbox. One of the oldest, time-tested forms of online commu-
nication still in existence appears. Very little has changed in the way an
e-mail form looks and works since its earliest days. E-mail stole its original
format from the interoffice memo. The memo’s classic organization gave 
us a few terms that don’t actually apply to electronic messages, such as Cc
(carbon copy).
E-mail forms are organized into fields. A few fields are required; others are
optional. We discuss each of these fields in detail in the following sections. As
you can see in Figure 4-5, here are the main parts of the mail form:
 Header: In the header section, you indicate key message information,
such as whom the message is going to and what it’s about. The header
section includes the To, Cc, Bcc, and Subject text boxes. (See the follow-
ing sections for everything you need to know about these text boxes.) It
also includes the Attach a File link, as well as the Send, Save Now, and
Discard buttons. (See the “Attaching files” and “Sending, saving, or dis-
carding” sections, later in this chapter, for details.)
Figure 4-5:

57
Chapter 4: Connecting with Gmail

 Body: The meat of the message goes in the body section. This section
also includes the Formatting toolbar and Spell Check tools. (Check out
the “Composing your message” section, later in this chapter, for more
information.)
To send an e-mail message, follow these basic steps:
1. Click in the To text box and enter the addresses to which you want to
send the message.
Optionally, click the Add Cc button to see the Cc and Bcc text boxes.
You can then enter more addresses in the Cc and Bcc text boxes.
2. Click in the Subject text box and enter a subject.
3. Click in the message field and type what you want to say.
4. Click the Send button.
In the following sections, we talk more in depth about each of the steps in the
preceding list.
Entering addresses
Before you can send a message, you first need to address it to a recipient (or
several recipients). To add a recipient for your message, follow these steps:
1. If you’re not already at the Compose Message screen, click the
Compose Mail link in the left column of your Gmail screen.
2. Click in the To text box and type the e-mail address of the person to
whom you want to send the message.
For example, in Figure 4-6, we typed cal@ardsleybooks.com for the first
e-mail address.
You place the e-mail address of the primary recipient or recipients in the
To text box. This is a required field. If you don’t put at least one e-mail
address in this text box, you get a plea from Gmail saying, “Please spec-
ify at least one recipient.”
3. (Optional) Type a comma and then enter another e-mail address.
You can add as many e-mail addresses as you want.
4. (Optional) If you have a long list of people to whom you’re sending
the message, click the Add Cc link, click in the Cc text box that
appears, and type more addresses.
58
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

5. (Optional) If you want to send the same message to several people, but
you don’t want them all knowing to whom the message went, click the
Add Bcc link, click in the Bcc text box that appears, and enter their
addresses in the Bcc text box.
Gmail automatically adds the e-mail address of anyone whom you e-mail, or
who e-mails you, to your Contacts list. When you begin entering a few letters
in the To or Cc text box, Gmail anticipates the address you’re typing and dis-
plays recipient names containing those letters, as shown in Figure 4-6. Arrow
down to the correct e-mail address. When it appears highlighted, press Enter
or just choose it from the list. (You can find out much more about your
Contacts list in Chapter 6.)
Gmail automatically enters the open (<) and close (>) angle brackets that
appear before and after e-mail addresses. You don’t need to enter them.
Getting to the subject
In the Subject text box, you enter a few descriptive words to let your reader
know what the e-mail message is about.
Many readers make a snap decision about the contents of the message just
by reading the subject line, so get into the habit of writing snappy, interesting
descriptions of your messages in the Subject text box. For business corre-
spondence, keep your subject lines short and to the point.
Composing your message
You compose all your great one-liners, tell your jokes, speak your mind, and
set things straight in the message (or body) field. Simply click in the body
text box and start typing away.

Chapter 4: Connecting with Gmail

You can use the formatting buttons just above the body text box to apply
bold, italics, colors, highlighting, and other formatting to your text, just like
you do with a document in Google Docs or any rich-text editor. To apply text
formatting, simply highlight the text that you want to format and click the
appropriate formatting button.
Attaching files
Quite often, you want to send a file along with an e-mail message. You can
attach any file to an e-mail: a word processing document, a spreadsheet, a
picture of your dog Charlie, or that video of your recent fishing trip. To attach
a file to your message, follow these steps:
1. Click the Attach a File link that appears below the Subject text box.
2. Browse to the particular file that you need, select it, and then click
the Open button.
See Figure 4-7 for an example.
The name of the attached file appears just below the subject line in your
e-mail form. If you want to add another file, click the Attach Another File link
that appears below the name of the file you already attached, as shown in
Figure 4-8. You can attach files as large as 20MB (megabytes) to a Gmail mes-
sage, which should be plenty unless you’re planning to attach the collected
works of Shakespeare or the 20 years’ worth of family videos you converted
to Quicktime files.

Sending, saving, or discarding
After you finish composing your message and adding any attachments you
want (which we talk about in the preceding sections), you have three options:
 Send: Simply click the Send button, and your message whisks across the
Internet at the speed of light, touching all the recipients anywhere in the
world.
 Save Now: If you’re having second thoughts about sending a particular
e-mail message, or if you simply haven’t finished it yet, you can save it
and work on it later. To save your message, simply click the Save Now
button.
 Discard: Many messages simply shouldn’t be sent at all. Okay, you
vented — or you exaggerated, or you suddenly realized that you don’t
know what the heck you’re talking about. No harm done. Just click the
Discard button and forget the whole thing.
Any e-mail message that you send can be forwarded to anyone else or sub-
poenaed by a court. Publicly traded companies must keep a record of all
their e-mail. An e-mail message can come back to haunt you. And, it can 
exist forever in a recipient’s private Inbox, where you can’t delete it. Want to
run for political office? You may want to think twice about sending that mes-
sage flip-flopping on major issues or wildly exaggerating your role in single-
handedly deterring global warming. Don’t believe for a second that any e-mail
conversation is private. E-mail has a habit of returning at the most inoppor-
tune moment.
Following the Conversation
Gmail has a unique way of tracking your messages and all the related replies.
In Google parlance, this tracking of related messages is called a conversation.
Figure 4-8:

61
Chapter 4: Connecting with Gmail

Think of a conversation among people. One person starts talking, a second
person replies, another person chimes in, and so on. Gmail keeps track of the
messages, just like the back-and-forth of a conversation, to maintain context
and relevancy.
Stack it up!
Gmail groups conversations by subject, making each group of messages into
a conversation stack. Gmail stacks replies, one on top of another, in the order
they’re sent. The most recent replies appear at the top of the stack.
Think of a stack as a pile of cards, each containing the next part of a conver-
sation. You can tell how many reply cards are in the stack by the number that
appears in parentheses after the senders’ names, as shown in Figure 4-9.
Conversations are automatically brought to the top of your Inbox when some-
one replies to one of your messages. This list also displays each message’s
subject line, followed by a snippet of the message. These bits of information
give you clues as to what the conversation is about. (Writing a clear subject
line really helps you figure out a conversation’s topic.) You can also see the
date a message was sent at the end of the snippet. To view any conversation
in the stack, pick it from the list by either clicking on the sender’s name, sub-
ject line, or date. Click in any of these places and you can open that portion
of the conversation. The conversation appears as a stack of messages, as
shown in Figure 4-10.
Not only does the conversational approach remind you of the context of a
new message, but you can also reply to any single part of a conversation. For
example, say you have a conversation going with two recipients, and one
recipient replies directly to you and not to the other person. Replying just to
the sender doesn’t impact the rest of the recipients in the stack.
Figure 4-9:
You can
view
conver-
sations in
your Inbox.

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

Stack headers give you a lot of information. First of all, you can tell exactly
when the reply was sent by looking at the extra information provided in the
top-right corner of the message in the stack. Also, you can send out related
e-mails from each stack in the conversation:
 Reply: Reply only to the sender. You can find a Reply link at both the top
and the bottom of the message.
 Reply to All: Click Reply to All to send a reply to everyone involved in
the conversation. (Find Reply to All by clicking the down arrow next to
the Reply button or jump to the bottom of the message window.)
 Forward: Send a copy of the e-mail message to anyone you want: the
news media, your boss, the Federal Trade Commission, Homeland
Security. . . . (Find Forward by clicking the down arrow next to the Reply
button or jump to the bottom of the message window.)
Very few people enjoy sifting through replies that don’t apply to them. The
Reply to All command has annoyed millions of unhappy cubicle inhabitants
in offices all over the world, so click it thoughtfully. If you’re sending a reply
intended for a single recipient, don’t send it to everyone listed in the header.
You really need to remember this bit of e-mail etiquette if you’re replying to a
message that was sent to the entire company.
Collapsing and expanding 
conversation stacks
After you open a conversation stack, it appears in a collapsed view with the
most recent reply open at the bottom. (Refer to Figure 4-10.) To expand the
Figure 4-10:
Reply
quickly to a
conver-
sation.
63
Chapter 4: Connecting with Gmail

stack so that you can view all the conversations, click the Expand All link (it’s
to the right of the conversation stack). To collapse the conversations, click
the Collapse All link. (See Figure 4-11.) To read just one reply or part of the
conversation, click the snippet or header at the top of the particular message.
In the Collapse All mode, Gmail displays a snippet of the conversation at the
top of each message.
Marking important messages
Gmail gives you a simple way to highlight important messages. Whether
you’re in the Inbox or viewing a conversation, simply click the Star icon on
the left side of the message header, and a bright, shiny star appears in the
icon’s place. (See Figure 4-12.) You can remove a star by clicking the Star icon
again.
Figure 4-11:

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

If you receive a lot of e-mail messages, you may end up with some of the
important starred conversations pushed way to the bottom of your Inbox.
You may have trouble finding some of your starred messages. To view all 
the messages that you’ve starred, click the Starred link in the left column.

Chapter 4: Connecting with Gmail
Google Apps Gmail vs. public, ad-supported Gmail
Anyone can go online and get a Gmail account
free from Google. If your organization isn’t part
of a Google Apps program, or if you want the
convenience of Gmail at home, you can use
Gmail by setting up your own personal account.
Just go to http://mail.google.com
and follow the setup instructions. Nearly every-
thing we talk about in this book applies to public
and Google Apps versions of Gmail.
Google Apps provides some extra features for
businesses and organizations, allowing them to
customize Gmail to fit their own specific busi-
ness or organizational needs. An organization
can customize the Google Apps version of Gmail
with that organization’s logo and domain
address. Even though Google hosts the service,
it stays out of sight. Google slips into the back-
ground and provides ways for an organization
to promote its own brand and organizational
identity. (The rest of this book provides a more
comprehensive overview of how Google Apps
integrates with the IT infrastructure of a busi-
ness, school, or organization.)
Google pays for the free, public Gmail system
with the ad revenue from the AdWords ads
shown in the right panel of your e-mail mes-
sages. The ads themselves stay out of the way.
Allowing AdWords advertising can bring certain
advantages. Say you receive an e-mail from a
friend telling you about the latest Toshiba lap-
tops or Apple iPhone gadgets — you see ads
relevant to the conversation. The ads give you
a chance to look up information about a prod-
uct that you’re genuinely interested in.
However, businesses and schools can prohibit
ads. Google provides alternatives by allowing
businesses to pay a small fee for the service,
eliminating the need for an ad-supported system.

Clicking this link hides your normal messages and shows only messages that
have a yellow star on the left side of their headers. (Clicking the Inbox link
shows you all your current messages.)
In the Inbox, the check boxes to the left of the stars (or Star icons) allow you
to select many messages at the same time. After you select the check boxes
to the left of messages, you can perform the following actions to all the
selected messages (on a single viewable page of the Inbox):
 Archive: Archiving conversations places selected messages in storage
and removes them from your Inbox. You may want to archive messages
that you’ve already read. Archiving is a great way to save your mes-
sages, but get them out of your Inbox so you don’t have to deal with 
the clutter.
 Report Spam: If you receive spam, select that message’s check box and
let Gmail know about it by clicking the Report Spam button. Reporting
spam helps Gmail do a better job of stopping it in the future.
 Delete: Clicking the Delete button removes conversations from your
Gmail account. Because you have so much storage capacity, you don’t
need to delete messages very often. Deleting a message only places the
message in the Trash label. To get rid of the message permanently, you
must go into the Trash label and delete it again from that screen.
When you archive or delete conversations, all the messages in that conversa-
tion move, not just the selected messages. If you archive a conversation, you
can always search for it later. After you delete a conversation and empty the
Trash label, you can’t retrieve your message again.
Searching Your Messages
You can use the same powerful tools that allow you to find exactly what you
need on the Internet to find any lost e-mail messages in your Inbox. The
search features can also search your archived messages.
To search your e-mail account for a particular message, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Search text box that appears at the top of every Gmail
account page and enter a search term.
For example, say you remember only a snippet of an e-mail sent to 
you, such as Uncle Jake is having a birthday. Enter the keywords jake
birthday. You can search for e-mail addresses, subjects, or even text
66
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

within a message. And the same rules that apply to a Google search on
the Internet apply to your e-mail searches, as well:
• Statistics point out that a phrase of two to five words is better than
a single keyword in narrowing down a search.
• If you put words in quotation marks (“ ”), Google searches for that
exact phrase.
• You don’t need to use capitalization.
2. Click the Search Mail button.
As shown in Figure 4-13, Gmail returns a list of messages that contain the
term(s) you enter in the Search text box in Step 1.

sations by

I
n Chapter 4, we introduce you to the world of Gmail and give you a chance
to dig in and get dirty with the basics. However, if you suffer from infoma-
nia (the tendency to get distracted by information overload from incoming
e-mail) or have more than a healthy portion of bacn (mailing lists and
newsletters that you subscribe to but may not want to read right away), 
we have some solutions for you in this chapter.
Besides helping you slim down your Inbox, this chapter helps you do other
nifty stuff, such as enable vacation reminders, add signatures, and access
your e-mail from Outlook or a cellphone. But first, we show you how well
Gmail plays with file attachments.
Opening Attachments
E-mail attachments are an important part of everyday life, and Google under-
stands that. Every time you receive documents, spreadsheets, or presenta-
tions as attachments, you have three ways you can open them directly from
Gmail: View as HTML, Open as a Google Document or Spreadsheet or View as
Slideshow, or Download, as shown in Figure 5-1.

View as HTML
The first option is to view the attachment as a Web page right in your
browser, as shown in Figure 5-2. You don’t need any special plug-ins or soft-
ware to view an attachment as HTML because Google uses special tools to
extract the text and graphics so that you can preview the document right
away. This method is also the fastest way to get to your important proposal
or budget report. It works for PDF attachments, too.
Figure 5-2:
View an
attachment
as HTML.
Figure 5-1:
Select an
option to
view your
attach-
ments.
70
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

Although the HTML option does its best to show you the information quickly,
documents that contain a lot of page layout and advanced formatting may
not appear completely accurately.
Open as a Google document
Rather than save the document to your computer, you can simply choose to
open the attachment as a Google document or spreadsheet, or view a presen-
tation as a slideshow, directly in your browser.
When you open an attachment in Google Docs, you can view and edit the
document right away. In fact, Gmail copies the document into your Docs
Home, and you can access that document any time you log into Google Docs.
For more information on using Google Docs, check out Part III.
Download
For documents that have advanced formatting, or don’t open easily as HTML
or a Google document, you still have the traditional download file method.
Click the Download link to the right of the attachment, and the File Download
dialog box appears, asking whether you want to open or save the file. If you
would like to find the file on your computer later, we recommend that you
click the Save button to save the file. The Save As dialog box will appear,
giving you the option to navigate to the folder on your computer where you
want to save the file. Finally, click the Save button to save the file.
Mail messages that contain multiple attachments also give you the option 
to download all your files at the same time in a Zipped archive. Click the
Download All Attachments link to start saving yourself a lot of time by down-
loading one smaller file. After you click the Download All Attachments link,
the File Download dialog box appears. To make it easy for you to locate your
files later, we recommend that you click the Save button to save the Zip file to
your computer. The Save As dialog box appears, which will let you navigate
to the folder where you want to save the file on your computer. Click the Save
button to save the Zip file.
Don’t forget, Google automatically scans your attachments for viruses. To
keep you extra safe, Gmail never accepts attachments that contain exe-
cutable files (files that end in .exe) or archives that contain executables. If
you need to send or receive those types of files, you’ll have to resort to
another method of transporting the files, such as using FTP or a file transfer
site (such as www.yousendit.com), burning them to a CD, or copying them
to a flash thumb drive.

Chapter 5: Discovering Advanced Gmail Tools

Creating Signatures and 
Vacation Responses
Your communication reflects a lot about who you are and what you repre-
sent. If you’re in touch with a lot of important people, we think it’s a good
idea to let them know how they can contact you in a way other than an e-mail
address. You can most easily give this information by adding a signature that
contains your contact information. You can set Gmail to automatically add a
signature to new messages, which can save you more than a few keystrokes.
Additionally, vacation responses help people know when you’re decidedly
unavailable. Whether you’re on a trip to Hawaii or spending a quiet weekend
at home, we can think of a ton of situations in which you may find Gmail’s
vacation responder handy.
In the following sections, we show you how to use both the Gmail signature
and vacation responder — they’re both incredibly simple to use.
Adding a signature
To add a signature, log into your Gmail Inbox and click the Settings link in the
top-right corner. Halfway down the Settings page, look for the Signature box,
as shown in Figure 5-3.
You can type whatever you want in the Signature box, but most people
include their name, a phone number, perhaps a Web site URL, and a random
quote (such as a Buddhist saying that only makes sense to another Buddhist).
Make sure that the radio button to the left of the signature box is selected
and click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the Settings page to make
your signature active.
After you activate your signature, whenever you compose a new e-mail mes-
sage, your signature appears in the message body automatically, as Figure 5-4
illustrates. Cool, huh?
Figure 5-3:
Add a
signature on
the Settings
page.
72
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

Turning the vacation responder on and off
When you’re ready for your break from the everyday onslaught of e-mail, flip
the switch to turn on your vacation responder. A vacation responder lets
people who send you e-mails know that you’re on vacation, out of the office,
or otherwise can’t get back to them right away. When someone e-mails you,
Gmail will automatically send a message of your choosing informing the
sender that you are unavailable at the moment. To turn your vacation respon-
der on, follow these steps:
1. Log into Gmail.
2. Click the Settings link in the top-right corner of the screen.
Near the bottom of the page, you can see the Vacation Responder sec-
tion, as Figure 5-5 shows.
3. Select the Vacation Responder On radio button.
4. Click in the Subject and Message text boxes and enter a subject and
message that let people who e-mail you know that you’re on vacation
(or otherwise unavailable).

73
Chapter 5: Discovering Advanced Gmail Tools

If you use your Gmail for business, give contact information for someone
who can cover for you while you’re unavailable.
5. (Optional) If you don’t want everyone to know that you’ve snuck off
on a weekend getaway to Rome, select the Only Send a Response to
People in My Contacts check box.
When you select this check box, only people you know can receive the
message from your vacation responder.
6. Click the Save Changes button.
Now, Gmail notifies people who e-mail you that you’ve headed off to Fiji.
Vacation responders send only one e-mail per address every four days, and
you can have only one vacation responder active at a time. Hopefully, your
friends and associates catch the drift the first time.
When you activate your vacation responder, a peach bar appears along the
top of your Gmail page, as shown in Figure 5-6. To turn off your responder,
click the End Now link on the right side of the bar (or select the Vacation
Responder Off radio button in Step 3). If you want to make changes or update
your e-mail response, click the Vacation Settings link to the right of the End
Now link.
Using Labels and Filters to 
Take Control of Your Inbox
You can whip your Inbox into shape by using labels and filters. Labels are like
folders, only better — they sort and organize your messages so that you can
easily find a particular message later. Filters are sets of rules that every new
e-mail message is checked against; if the message matches a rule, then Gmail
performs an action with the message, such as starring or deleting it.
Figure 5-6:

link on the

74
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

How can labels and filters help you? Imagine sending all your incoming work-
related messages to one folder and your travel plans to another. Filters let
you tell Gmail exactly where the messages should go, and labels help you
organize messages that you’ve already received.
Labeling your messages
Labels are one of the best ways to organize your messages. If you’ve used
other e-mail programs before, you’re probably used to creating folders and
storing your messages in them. The problem with folders is that, many times,
your messages fit in more than one folder, which means you have to remem-
ber in which folder you put those messages, often causing a lot of confusion
and frustration when you need to find those messages later. Labels alleviate
this problem by allowing you to tag messages and view all your similarly
tagged messages in a list, much like a folder. Unlike folders, however, you
don’t have to move any messages around, and you can easily tag a message
with multiple labels.
Think of it this way: You can find all the mail messages you’ve sent and
received by clicking the All Mail link (it’s in the list on the left, below the
Drafts link). New messages are tagged with the Inbox label, so they appear in
the Inbox. When you archive a message, the Inbox label is removed, and the
message no longer appears in the Inbox list.
You can create your own set of labels and tag your messages so that similar
messages appear together in a list without any folder confusion. Even though
a message has a label, you can still find it by clicking the All Mail link or by
using Gmail Search.
Click the Edit Labels link in the green labels box in the bottom-left corner of
any Gmail screen. You can also click the Settings link at the top of the screen
and then click the Labels tab, as shown in Figure 5-7. In the Labels tab, you
can do the following:
Figure 5-7:
Click the
Edit Labels
link to add,
rename, and
remove
labels on
the Settings
screen.
75
Chapter 5: Discovering Advanced Gmail Tools

 Add a new label: Click in the Create a New Label text box and enter the
new label’s name, then click the Create button.
 Rename a label: Click the Rename link to the right of the label that you
want to change. A blue box appears, allowing you to change the label
name or enter a new label name. Click OK when you’re done to return to
the Labels Settings screen.
 Delete a label: Click the Remove link to the right of the label name. A
dialog box appears, asking whether you really want to remove the label.
Click OK, and the label disappears. When you delete a label, messages
with that label stay in the Inbox (or the All Mail label if you have archived
it previously).
When you’re ready to tag a message or two, return to the Inbox. Select the
check box for the message(s) that you want to tag, and then choose a label
from the More Actions list at the top of the screen. The label that you choose
now appears to the left of your message’s subject, and your message appears
when you click the corresponding label link on the left side of the screen. If
the label you want doesn’t exist, choose New Label from the More Actions list
and then enter a name for your new label in the dialog box that appears.
You can also customize your labels by adding colors. Click the color square
to the right of a label in the Labels list and choose the color that you want, as
shown in Figure 5-8. Dark and bold colors can really make more important
messages stand out.
Creating new filters
Filters help keep your Inbox free of clutter by automatically performing an
action on a message as soon as it’s received, such as deleting any message
from a certain e-mail address. You can create as many filters as you want; you
can best keep your Inbox clutter-free by creating a good number of filters.
Creating effective filters involves two steps. First, choose the type of mes-
sages that you want to filter; second, choose an action that you want Gmail to
perform on those messages. The following sections describe these steps in
detail.
Figure 5-8:
Labels work
just like
folders, only
cooler!
76
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

To create a new filter, follow these steps:
1. Log into your Google Apps Gmail (if you haven’t already).
2. Click the Settings link at the top of the screen.
3. Click the Filters tab.
A screen that looks like Figure 5-9 appears.
4. Click the Create a New Filter link.
Your screen will show you some search boxes and look similar to the
upcoming Figure 5-10.
5. Describe what messages you want the filter to catch by filling in the
text boxes in the Choose Search Criteria screen.
See the following section for details on choosing your filter criteria.
6. Click the Next Step button, and then select the appropriate check
boxes in the Choose Action screen that appears.
See the “Choose an action” section, later in this chapter, for details.
7. Click the Create Filter button to create your filter.
Choose your search criteria
To create an effective filter, you need to identify the types of messages that
you want to filter. You can specify what messages you want to filter in the
Choose Search Criteria screen, shown in Figure 5-10 (refer to the step list in
the preceding section to find out how to get to this screen). You have six dif-
ferent ways to filter the messages, described below, and you can use any
combination to help you narrow your list of filtered messages further.
Figure 5-10:
Choose your
filter’s
search
criteria.
Figure 5-9:
Create a
new filter on

77
Chapter 5: Discovering Advanced Gmail Tools

The following list describes what to enter in the Choose Search Criteria
screen:
 From: Enter an e-mail address or the name of a person or company that
you want to filter, such as cal@ardsleybooks.com or Cal.
 To: Use this text box to find messages that were sent to another person,
in addition to you. You can use this option to find messages that were
sent to a mailing list.
 Subject: Enter keywords that appear in the message’s subject line.
 Has the Words: Enter keywords that may appear anywhere in the mes-
sage, including the subject and address fields.
 Doesn’t Have: Enter keywords in this text box to show messages that
don’t contain a specific word or e-mail address.
The keywords in all the fields work together to limit your search results.
For example, enter wall in the Has the Words text box and enter face-
book in the Doesn’t Have text box to find messages from the Wall Street
Journal, but not messages notifying you that someone wrote on your
Facebook Wall.
 Has Attachment: Select this check box to filter messages that contain
attachments. This setting is also useful in conjunction with keywords in
other fields.
The filter looks for messages that have something from all the fields into
which you enter text. If you want to use the same action for messages that
have many different fields, type OR or a comma between the keywords, such
as delta OR united OR american airlines OR continental for travel-related
messages and facebook, myspace, linkedin for messages from social net-
working sites.
After you enter the keywords that you like, click the Test Search button to
see how well the filter works on your existing messages. A list will appear just
below your filter box, showing you all the messages that match your search
criteria.
As an example, if you enter Cal Redwood in the From text box, enter meeting
in the Has the Words text box, and select the Has Attachment check box, the
filter finds only messages that include any kind of file attachments that Cal
sent about a meeting.
When you narrow the messages as far as you want, click the Next Step
button. The following section gives you details on the Choose Action screen
that appears.
78
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

Choose an action
In the Choose Action screen, you need to decide what to do with your newly
filtered messages. You can choose from six different options, and you can
select more than one action to perform, as shown in Figure 5-11.
You can choose one or more of the following actions:
 Skip the Inbox (Archive It): Select this option to have the message auto-
matically sent to the All Mail label.
 Mark as Read: Choose this action, and filtered messages no longer
appear bold and therefore don’t show up as new messages.
 Star It: Check this option to highlight important messages and have
them appear in the Starred label.
 Apply the Label: Select this check box, and then choose a label from the
drop-down list to send your messages to that label.
If you select both the Apply the Label check box and the Skip the Inbox
option, new messages appear in the selected label, but you don’t have to
deal with them in the Inbox.
 Forward It To: Select this check box, click in the text box to the right of
Forward It To, and enter the address to which you want the message for-
warded. A copy of the filtered messages goes to the other mailbox or
person that you specify.
 Delete It: Select this check box to create your own spam filter — you
never even have to see the message.
You can return to the previous screen by clicking the Back button. When
you’re ready to activate your filter, click the Create Filter button, and you’re
done. Be sure to check the Also Apply Filter to Conversations Below check
box if you want to filter your old messages, not just messages you receive
going forward.
Figure 5-11:

Chapter 5: Discovering Advanced Gmail Tools

Adjusting filters later
After you set up a filter, you may find that it doesn’t run quite the way you
want it to. Maybe the filter’s catching too many messages, or maybe you
decide that you want to have the filtered messages sent to another label.
To adjust a filter that you’ve already created, follow these steps:
1. Log into Gmail (if you haven’t already).
2. Click the Settings link at the top of the screen.
3. In the Settings screen that appears, click the Filters tab.
The Filters tab lists all the filters that you’ve already created.
4. Click the Edit link to the right of the filter that you want to change.
The Choose Search Criteria screen appears, showing what you had pre-
viously entered for the filter.
5. Change the options in the Choose Search Criteria screen as desired
(refer to the “Choose your search criteria” section, earlier in this
chapter, for details), and then click the Next Step button.
The Choose Action screen appears, showing the options that you
selected when you first created the filter.
80
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 
Do you smell bacn?
Bacn is a fairly new term. It refers to the mes-
sages that you subscribe to from various Web
sites, whether news, social networking, or
travel. Unlike spam, these messages are useful
and somewhat important, otherwise you would-
n’t have subscribed to them. But sometimes you
get so many of them that they interfere with
your really important e-mail conversations and
can make your e-mail seem overwhelming.
Nobody deserves that.
Rather than let bacn accumulate and ruin an oth-
erwise pleasant day, use filters in Gmail to shuf-
fle them away so that you can give them
attention when you really have time. Here’s what
we do: For promotional e-mails from various 
airlines, such as Delta and American Airlines, we
create a filter, entering the words Delta, Ameri-
can Airlines, United, Travel, Flight, or Fare in the
Has the Words text box. Then we select the Skip
the Inbox check box, select the Apply the Label
check box, and select the Travel label from the
Apply the Label drop-down list. By using this
filter, these messages never clutter the Inbox, but
the Travel label on the left of the screen tells us
right away how many new travel messages,
whether offers or reservations, we have. When
we have time at the end of the day, we can click
the Travel label and begin planning where we
want to take our next vacation.

6. Change the options in the Choose Action screen as desired (refer to
the preceding section for details), and then click the Update Filter
button.
If you don’t like the filter after all, click the Delete link to the right of the filter,
and that filter disappears forever.
Alternative Access: Forwarding,
POP/IMAP, and Mobile
Just because Gmail is one of the most simple, intuitive, and powerful Web-
mail services available, that doesn’t mean you have to stick with the same
Web site day after day. You can access your important messages in many
ways, such as downloading them to your computer or getting them on your
mobile phone. Fortunately, no matter where you check your mail, you can
still always return to the friendly Gmail Web page from any computer with an
Internet connection.
In the following sections, we go over how to enable forwarding so that you
can send your e-mail somewhere other than your Gmail Inbox (if your admin-
istrator allows you to), how to sync Outlook with your Gmail mailbox using
POP or IMAP, and even how to check your messages when you’re on the go
from your Web-enabled mobile phone.
Turning forwarding on and off
E-mail forwarding is one of the best ways to consolidate e-mail from multiple
addresses. If your Google Apps Gmail account isn’t your primary account,
you can turn forwarding on in two clicks and pass your Gmail messages on to
your primary account.
If you have a personal Gmail account, you can also use this option to forward
your personal e-mail to your Google Apps account. Then you have to look in
only one place for all your messages.
To set up forwarding for your Google Apps e-mail, log into Gmail and click the
Settings link in the top-right corner of the screen. Click the Forwarding and
POP/IMAP tab, as shown in Figure 5-12.
81
Chapter 5: Discovering Advanced Gmail Tools

Here’s a brief description of what you can do in the Forwarding and POP/
IMAP tab:
 Disable Forwarding: Select this radio button if you don’t want your
messages going anywhere.
 Forward a Copy of Incoming Mail: Select this radio button to send a
copy of all incoming messages to another address. Enter the address
that you want your messages to go to in the text box, and then select
one of the following options from the Forward a Copy of Incoming Mail
drop-down list:
• Keep Gmail’s Copy in the Inbox: Everything happens invisibly. Your
messages get forwarded, and Gmail never knows.
• Archive Gmail’s Copy: New messages don’t appear in the Inbox, but
you still can read them from your Gmail account by clicking the All
Mail link.
• Delete Gmail’s Copy: Gmail deletes forwarded messages from your
Gmail account.
If you want to forward only certain messages, create a filter (flip back to the
section “Creating new filters,” earlier in this chapter) and check the Forward
It To check box in the Choose Action screen. Enter an address in the Forward
It To text box, and Gmail passes on only those select messages to the address
you specify.
Sending mail as someone else
It’s always fun to pretend to be somebody else. Gmail gives you that option —
as long as that someone else is also you. When you have several e-mail
addresses to manage, such as your personal one, one for work, and one for
your soccer league, Gmail makes it easy to send and receive all your mes-
sages in one place, from up to five different accounts.

To add an account, follow these steps:
1. Click the Settings link in the top-right corner of the Gmail main page.
The Gmail Settings screen will appear with tabs along the top.
2. In the Settings screen, click the Accounts tab, which you can see in
Figure 5-13.
3. In the Send Mail As section, click the Add Another Email Address link.
A new window opens, asking you for the name and address that you
want to add.
4. Fill in the information and click the Next Step button.
The screen that appears asks you to verify that you are, in fact, the
owner of the address you enter in this step.
5. Click the Send Verification button.
The next screen asks you to enter a verification code. When you clicked
the Send Verification button, the Gmail team sent a message to your
other e-mail account. Because the message contains a link that will auto-
matically verify your account, you can skip entering the verification
code at this time and simply close the verification window. This takes
you back to your Gmail screen.
6. In a new browser window, log into the e-mail account that you enter
in Step 4 and look for the new message from the Gmail team.
7. Open the message and click the very long, cryptic-looking link to
verify your address.
If you leave the window open in Step 5, you can alternatively copy and
paste the verification code from the message into that window and click
the Verify button.

Congratulations! Now your other e-mail address is verified. The next time 
you compose a new message in Gmail, the From field will change into a drop-
down list from which you can select your Google Apps e-mail address or your
other e-mail account, as shown in Figure 5-14.
If your other e-mail account allows POP access, find out what those POP set-
tings are (you may have to call your service provider) and then return to the
Gmail Accounts tab (click the Settings link at the top of the screen, and then
click the Accounts tab). Click the Add Another Mail Account link near the
bottom of the page and follow the instructions that appear on the screen.
Unless you choose otherwise, new messages are automatically labeled with
your other address when they arrive so that you can tell which messages
came to which e-mail address.
Activating POP or IMAP
POP (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
both provide you access to your Gmail messages from other e-mail programs,
such as Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail, and Mozilla Thunderbird. We think
that IMAP is by far the best way to access your messages because it automat-
ically syncs your Gmail every time you make changes to your messages. For
example, if you’re using IMAP and read a message in Outlook, the next time
you visit Gmail, the message is already marked as read.
POP, on the other hand, allows you to download a copy of your messages to
your computer, but it doesn’t sync back up with Gmail. You may find this lack
of syncing a bit problematic if you’re using more than one computer to down-
load your messages because new messages download only to the last com-
puter that asked. IMAP syncs each of your devices with Gmail so each one
has the same messages making it the obvious better choice.
These services aren’t turned on by default, so you have to make changes to
your Gmail settings. To activate POP or IMAP, follow these steps:
Figure 5-14:

address
with which
you want to
send your
message.

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

1. Log into Gmail and click the Settings link at the top of the Gmail page.
2. Click the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab.
Your screen should now look similar to Figure 5-15.
3. To turn IMAP on, select the Enable IMAP radio button.
4. (Optional) To turn on POP, select the Enable POP for All Mail radio
button or the Enable POP for Mail That Arrives from Now On radio
button.
Unless you’re really passionate about POP or you’re using a very old
e-mail program, you should ignore the POP Download section altogether.
However, if you really, really want to use POP for your Gmail account,
here is a description of the two choices in the POP Download section:
• You can select the Enable POP for All Mail radio button, which
downloads to your computer every message that you’ve ever
received since you began using your Gmail account.
• You can select the Enable POP for Mail That Arrives from Now 
On radio button, which downloads only new messages that you
receive. You can then choose in Step 2 of the POP Download sec-
tion whether you want Gmail to keep messages in the Inbox,
archive them, or delete your accessed messages.
5. Click the Save Changes button.
You will be taken back to your Inbox. Continue to the following section
to find instructions for how to set up Outlook.
Configuring Outlook to work with Gmail
Many users are already familiar with Microsoft Outlook, so we put together
some step-by-step instructions to get your Gmail account up and running in
Outlook using IMAP.
Figure 5-15:

The Internet is always changing and so is the software. That’s why you should
download the latest updates for Outlook so that you don’t run into any prob-
lems. You can download them at http://update.microsoft.com.
Accessing Gmail from your mobile device
We’re not sure whether you’re the type of person who sits on the edge of
your seat waiting for your next e-mail to arrive and responding to those mes-
sages as fast as they come, or whether you’re the casual type who checks
your e-mail once in a while and is content with just that. No matter what your
level of e-mail anxiety, Gmail makes it easy to check your messages, even
when you’re away from a computer.
If you’re a BlackBerry debutant, open your mobile browser and go to http://
m.google.com/a to download a special Gmail client. This application gives
you many of the same features as the normal Gmail interface. Simply log 
in, using your Google Apps account username and password, and you’re
good to go.
iPhone fanatics can use the iPhone’s built-in Mail client to access Gmail, as
well. Be sure to set up a custom IMAP account (see the section “Activating
POP or IMAP,” earlier in this chapter, to find out how to set up an IMAP
account) if you want your messages to sync back to the main program. You
can find detailed instructions for setting up Gmail on your iPhone by logging
into Gmail, clicking the Settings link at the top of the screen, clicking the
Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab on the Settings page, and finally, clicking the
Configuration Instructions link.
If you have a simple Web-enabled phone, open your phone’s Web browser
application and navigate to http://mail.yourdomain.com. Enter your
Google Apps account username and password in the login page that appears,
then press the Sign In button. Links to your messages and your labels appear
in a very simple, easy-to-use format.
Beyond everything we cover in this chapter, you can find more Gmail tips and
new features back on your computer. From the Gmail Inbox screen in your
browser, look for the tips banner along the bottom of your screen or click the
New Features link at the top of the screen.

Chapter 6
Keeping in Touch with 
the Contacts List
In This Chapter
 Getting to know your Contacts list
 Sorting and changing your Quick Contacts list
 Creating, editing, and using groups
You need to keep track of the people that you communicate with, and
Google helps you with that task by giving you the Contacts list (a data-
base of contact information). This chapter is all about creating, adding to,
and using your Contacts list with Gmail. Chapter 7 covers using your
Contacts list with Gmail Chat and Google Talk. Your Contacts list also fuels
your Google Calendar app (which we talk about in Chapters 8 and 9). You can
even migrate Contacts lists to your smart phone. Without contacts, digital
communication grinds to a screeching halt.
Everything in this chapter applies to anyone who uses Gmail, Gmail Chat, and
Google Talk, whether or not they use Google Apps. iGoogle users, rejoice!
Creating a Contacts List
Gmail automatically adds a contact to your address database when you reply
to a message from someone who isn’t already in your Contacts list. The
Contacts list also accumulates addresses and information when you’re using
the Google Chat and Talk apps.

You can use your Contacts list a little or a lot, depending on your needs. For
instance
 In Google Talk and Chat, your contacts are monitored to see who’s
online and who’s available.
 In Gmail, the Contacts list allows you to enter just part of a name and
have the most likely choices appear so you don’t have to type the entire
e-mail address in the To text box.
 In Google Calendar, you can use your Contacts list to facilitate the
scheduling of attendees, rooms, and resources for meetings and events.
If all you need from the Contacts list is a little help addressing your e-mail,
that’s valuable enough. But if you want to get the most out of this potent tool,
take a few minutes and browse through the following sections. We go under
the hood and look at all the Contacts list’s powerful features.
Viewing your contacts
Want to find your Contacts list? Okay, pay attention. If you blink, you may
miss this. Just follow these steps:
1. Open Gmail.
2. Click the Contacts link in the left-hand panel.
If your Google Apps administrator has set everything up according to Hoyle,
you should see a list of the people in your organization — that is, all the col-
leagues in your domain listing. For example, all the employees at Ardsley
Books were automatically added into the Contacts list shown in Figure 6-1.
Groups that the organization created are also included in the Contacts list.
We discuss groups in more detail in the “Sorting Contacts into Groups” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
Figure 6-1:
View your
Contacts list
by clicking
the
Contacts
link.
90
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

And it doesn’t stop there. Gmail keeps track of anyone you’ve e-mailed, replied
to, or showed the slightest interest in and adds them to the Contacts list.
Gmail automatically groups your contacts, as shown in Figure 6-1, by these
three categories:
 Frequently Mailed: An abbreviated list of the most frequently used con-
tacts in your Contacts list.
 All Contacts: A list of everybody in your Contacts list. (Think of the
proverbial kitchen sink.)
 Groups: A list of groups that either you or your organization creates.
Groups facilitate e-mailing large numbers of people. Instead of entering
multiple e-mail addresses individually, a group will e-mail dozens, even
hundreds, of people with a single common e-mail address. We show you
how that works in the later section, “Sorting Contacts into Groups.”
Rolling through your Contacts list
Take a second to roll your mouse cursor slowly over the list of e-mail
addresses that appear in your Contacts list. Pop, pop, pop, up come little
contact cards with descriptions of each individual contact, as shown in
Figure 6-2. Unless either your contacts or you add more robust information,
these listings appear rather plain. However, you can add more pertinent
information, including pictures, which will help you remember what some of
these people actually look like. (See the “Adding or Updating Contacts” sec-
tion for details.)
Figure 6-2:
Pop-ups

information

list.
91
Chapter 6: Keeping in Touch with the Contacts List

With any luck, your friends and colleagues will update their own contact infor-
mation. If they do, all the new information automatically appears in your
Contacts list, so you don’t need to worry about it. If they don’t, you need to
enter their details by hand. But remember, even if a contact entry is incom-
plete, you can still find just a name and an e-mail address valuable. In fact, you
don’t need to complete all the information for every contact in your list, unless
you have a lot of time on your hands. Just enter the information that you think
you’ll need for each contact and keep it at that. If you find, over time, that you
need more complete information, you can add to the record later.
Using Quick Contacts in Gmail
The Quick Contacts list, just as the name implies, is designed to save you
time and add convenience to your Gmail and Chat applications. You can also
view your Contacts list by clicking the triangle beside a contact name, as
shown in Figure 6-3. Clicking this triangle opens an abbreviated list called the
Quick Contacts list.
Knowing when your contacts are online
A green dot appears to the left of Cal Redwood’s name in Figure 6-4. (Okay, in
this black-and-white book, the dot looks gray — but trust us, it’s green on-
screen.) A green dot means that person is online — a useful bit of information
if you want to have a real-time conversation with that person by using Gmail
Chat or Google Talk. This can be a very handy productivity tool, as you can
find out in Chapter 7.
If you don’t want someone to see your green dot, you can block certain con-
tacts so they don’t interrupt you while you’re working, playing, or attending a
meeting. To block visitors, set your status by clicking the down arrow next to
the words Set Status Here. See the following section for details.
Click to open the
Quick Contacts list.

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

Prioritizing Quick Contacts
The Quick Contacts list displays your most frequently contacted people
based on your past e-mail and chatting habits. The automatically generated
list may not always reflect your wishes, so you can make changes and priori-
tize your contacts to your liking. By adjusting your list, you can tell at a glance
whether your contact is online and available for a quick chat. Also, those con-
tacts that you e-mail most often appear on the list, so you can simply click a
name to launch a new Gmail message preaddressed to that person.
You may have other contacts that you need to banish to the background 
so they don’t take up valuable space in the visible portion of your Quick
Contacts list. Not that you consider them second-class contacts; you simply
don’t need to contact them frequently or in any great haste.
To customize your Quick Contacts list, display all your contacts by clicking
the Show All link at the bottom of the Quick Contacts list (refer to Figure 6-4).
After you display all your contacts, decide which contacts you want to show
up in your Quick Contacts list by selecting an option in the Show in Quick
Contacts column (see Figure 6-5). Place only those contacts that you must
contact frequently or need to reach immediately in your Quick Contacts list.
You have four options:
 Always: Selecting Always shows this contact in your Quick Contacts list,
well, always.
 Auto: Selecting Auto means that Gmail decides whether a contact is high
frequency and should appear in your Quick Contacts list.
 Never: Selecting Never keeps this contact out of your Quick Contacts
list.
 Block: Selecting Block prevents this person from contacting you via
Chat. (However, this person can still e-mail you.)
Figure 6-4:
A green dot

Chapter 6: Keeping in Touch with the Contacts List

Unearthing lost contacts
Even if you select Never or Block for a contact (see the preceding section for
more on the Quick Contacts list options), you can still get to that person’s
contact information whenever you need it by using the search tool in the
Quick Contacts list. As Figure 6-6 shows, after you enter only a few letters in
the search text box, a list of contact names appears in a list.
After you find the contact that you’re looking for, the Quick Contacts search
box displays several options for that contact. Click the option that you need:
 Mail: E-mail that contact.
 Invite to Chat: Invite the contact to a quick chat, plan lunch, share
gossip, and maybe even get some work done.

 Show in Quick Contacts: Restore this person to your Quick Contacts list
if you have deleted them for some reason.
 View Recent Conversations: Look up what you and your contact said
while chatting.
 <Name>’s Profile: Open the contact’s profile. You can view his or her
statistics, or add your own data to his or her contact information. (Your
changes only appear in your copy of another’s profile.)
Adding or Updating Contacts
In the detailed edit contact window, you can change your contacts’ informa-
tion. You can add info, alter details, or even change someone’s picture. You
can also add e-mail, phone, and address information at any time, so you can
reach out to anyone and remind them to pick you up for that preposterous
office party in the offing. You have three ways to begin updating or altering
the information for any existing contact:
 Roll over any contact in your Quick Contacts list. When the contact card
appears, click the “More” down arrow at the top of the contact card fol-
lowed by the Contact Details. Then, click the Edit Contact Information
link.
 Display all your contacts by choosing Contacts in the left panel, and
then roll over any contact in your Contacts list and click Contact Details.
Then, click the Edit Contact Information link.
 Search for a contact in the search box in the Quick Contacts list. When
you find it, select <Name>’s Profile, click Contact Information, and finally,
click the Edit Contact Information link from the card that appears.
To add a new contact from scratch, follow these steps:
1. Open your Contacts list by clicking the Contacts or Show All link.
2. Click the Create Contact link.
Entering basic contact information
When you create a new contact, the following basic fields appear in the Add
Contact window (shown in Figure 6-7):
 Name: Enter the contact’s first name followed by last name in this 
text box.
 Email: Enter your contact’s primary e-mail address in this text box.
95
Chapter 6: Keeping in Touch with the Contacts List

 Notes: Place any pertinent notes that you want to remember about this
contact in this text box.
 Picture: Choose whether you want to use your own picture (select the
My Pick radio button) or use a picture that the contact added (select 
the Their Pick radio button). If you select the My Pick radio button, click
the Upload Picture link below the My Pick picture box to use your own
picture.
 More Information: Click this link if you want to add more fields of 
information.
 Save: Click the Save button after you finish entering all the necessary
data.
Adding more information about a contact
You may need to add more fields than the basic ones provided in the Add
Contact window, particularly if you’re entering information for business 
contacts. You can easily add additional information by clicking the More
Information link (refer to Figure 6-7). Two new sections appear, a Personal
and a Work section. In these sections, you can add additional e-mail
addresses and phone numbers, as well as complete address information.
Simply click inside a text box and enter the appropriate information. You 
can select the type of information that you want to enter by clicking the
arrow to the right of the field name and selecting from the list that appears
(see Figure 6-8).
Figure 6-7:
Add contact
information
in the Add
Contact
window.
96
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

You may not always have the data fields that you need for a unique contact,
such as fields for a second mobile phone or for a pager. Gmail lets you add
fields by clicking the Add Another Field link, which appears in each section
on the right side of the window (see Figure 6-8). From there, you choose
among the standard types of fields: E-mail, IM, Phone, Mobile, Pager, Fax,
Company, Title, or Other. And, if you want to change the name or purpose of
a field, click in the field box and type whatever name you want.
Adding a picture
You can add your picture into your personal contact information, and that
picture is automatically shared with others throughout your network of con-
tacts. So make sure you add a flattering photo.
You can use any image stored on your computer as your contact image. The
only limitation is that the image must be in one of the following commonly-
used file formats:
 JPG or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): A popular online
graphics format using compression to reduce the size of images.
 BMP (bitmap): A graphics file format proprietary to Microsoft
Corporation.
 GIF (Graphic Interchange Format): This highly compact, low-resolution
format was originally designed by CompuServe for online use.
 PNG (Portable Network Graphics): This compressed image format is
similar to JPEG in many ways, approved by the World Wide Web
Consortium as a high-resolution alternative to the GIF format.
After you identify the picture that you want to use, click the name of your
target contact. Remember: You can add your personal picture, as well, by
choosing your name from the Contacts list.
Figure 6-8:

Chapter 6: Keeping in Touch with the Contacts List

Follow these steps to add a picture to a contact:
1. Click Contacts from the side panel.
2. Scroll over the contact that you want to change and choose Edit
Contact Information as explained in the previous section.
3. Select the My Pick radio button to the right of Picture.
4. Click the Upload Picture link.
The Upload a Picture window appears, as shown in Figure 6-9.
5. Click the Browse button.
The Choose File dialog box appears.
6. In the Choose File dialog box, browse to the picture file that you want
to insert and click Open.
The dialog box closes.
7. Click the Upload Picture button in the Upload a Picture window.
8. (Optional) Crop the image.
To keep anyone from getting a big head, Gmail asks you to crop the
image down to size. It displays the image in the Crop This Picture dialog
box. To crop your image, follow these steps:
a. Drag the selection box into a flattering position.
b. Drag the corners of the selection box to expand or reduce the selec-
tion box, as needed.
c. When you’re satisfied, click the Apply Changes button, as shown in
Figure 6-10.
Figure 6-9:
Browse to
your file and
click the

button.
98
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

The Edit Contact window reappears, and the picture you just uploaded
and cropped now appears in the My Pick picture box. After a little
adjustment, you can have nearly anyone, even your cross-eyed accoun-
tant friend down the hall, looking like a million bucks. The cropping
doesn’t change the original file, so if you make a mistake cropping the
image, you can always go back and try, try again.
9. In the Edit Contact window, click Save.
After you save a picture for a contact, the Suggest This Picture to
<Name> dialog box appears, enabling you to share the picture that you
choose with that contact.
10. (Optional) If you have a flattering picture that you want to send to your
boss or another colleague, enter a short note in the text box to the
right of the picture in the Suggest This Picture to <Name> dialog box,
and then click the Yes, Suggest This Picture button. (See Figure 6-11.)

Chapter 6: Keeping in Touch with the Contacts List

If you click the No, Keep This Picture to Myself button instead, Gmail
doesn’t send the contact the picture that you use for him or her in your
personal Contacts list. (We suggest you resist the temptation to add a
picture of a donkey to your boss’s contact information, however, in case
she happens to look over your shoulder one day.)
Sorting Contacts into Groups
Groups make it a snap to contact large numbers of people at the same time.
But you must invest the time to create your groups in order to save time
later. Gmail assigns a single e-mail address (the group’s address) that con-
tains multiple e-mail addresses including each member of the group. When
you enter a group name in the To field, Gmail enters all the e-mail addresses
for the entire group’s membership in a flash.
If you belong to a heads-up organization, an administrator may have already
created some of the key groups within your organization for you. Your com-
pany might create groups consisting of all employees, employees in a specific
department, all senior managers, and so on. Gmail allows you to create an
unlimited number of your own groups, too. Groups aren’t limited to business,
of course — you can create a group of your friends, your immediate family
members, or people who share your hobbies.
Creating groupies
The best way to figure out how groups work is to create a group of your own.
To create a group, follow these steps:
1. Open your Contacts list and click the Groups tab.
If you haven’t yet added a group, you see the screen shown in Figure 6-12.
2. Click the New Group icon.
3. In the Create Group window that appears, click in the Group Name
text box and enter a name that describes the group.
4. In the Add Contacts text box, enter however many e-mail addresses
you want in the group. (See Figure 6-13.)
Fortunately, you can easily add addresses that are already in your
Contacts list because Gmail automatically starts listing known addresses
when you begin entering just a few letters in the Add Contacts text box.
5. Click the Create Group button to save the group information.

Viewing and editing an existing group
If you have a contact that you want to add or remove from a group, you can
always edit the contacts in the group. You can also rename the group. To
view or edit an existing group, follow these steps:
1. Click Contacts and then click the Groups tab.
2. Double-click on any group that you’ve created from the list.

3. Make any changes that you want, including the following:
• Rename: Click the Rename link to change the name of your group.
• Add Contact to: Type e-mail addresses into the Add Contacts text
box, then click the Add Contacts button to add members to the
group (see Figure 6-14).
• Delete a Group: Place a check mark next to the group’s name and
click the Delete Group button.
E-mailing a group
First, e-mail your groups and let them know what you’re up to. Groups
become part of your e-mail list database. You just have to start entering the
first few letters in the To text box, and your group’s name appears (as shown
in Figure 6-15). Select the name of the group from the list of contacts that
appears, and all the members’ e-mail addresses suddenly appear in the To
text box.

f e-mail has a downside, it’s that sometimes it just isn’t instantaneous
enough. Sure, it travels over the Internet at lightning speed, but you still
have to wait for the other person to open his or her e-mail and read your
very important message.
That’s why instant messaging and short messaging service (SMS; text mes-
saging to you mobile phone users) were invented — you want the recipient to
get the message and reply to it a second after you press the Send button.
Google takes care of your instant-messaging and SMS needs with Gmail Chat
and Google Talk.
In this chapter, we cover how to use Gmail Chat and Google Talk to have a
real-time conversation with one or more of your contacts. We also cover how
you can use Google Talk to have a voice conversation.
Team Edition users, the first part of this chapter talks about Gmail Chat,
which you won’t have access to, so skip ahead to the “Upgrading to Google
Talk” section, later in this chapter.
Understanding Gmail Chat 
and Google Talk
Often, e-mail simply isn’t fast enough when you need to have a conversation.
Google has two options to help you out when you need to make contact right
now:

 Gmail Chat: A basic instant-messaging program that’s built right into
Gmail.
Use Gmail Chat if you’re already in Gmail and need to have just a simple
instant-message conversation.
 Google Talk: A more robust instant-messaging program that you can use
as a gadget on your Start Page or download and use as a standalone pro-
gram. With Google Talk, you can type messages to a contact so you can
chat in real time, just like in Chat. You can also use a microphone and
speakers (or a headset) to have a voice conversation with a contact or
to leave a voice message.
Use Google Talk when you want to use the telephony services to have a
voice conversation.
Using Gmail Chat
When you’re ready to start chatting, you first need to figure out who’s online
and available. You can see who’s ready to chat pretty simply; sign into Gmail
(if you haven’t already) and look for a green dot to the left of a contact’s
name in your Chat list. If you see the green dot, the contact’s online and
ready to chat.
Inviting someone to chat in Gmail Chat
After you identify whether the person you want to instant message is online,
starting up a chat in Gmail Chat is simple. Follow these steps:
1. Sign into Gmail (if you haven’t already).
2. In the Chat list on the left side of the screen, roll over the contact that
you want to chat with and click the Chat button on the contact card
that appears. (See Figure 7-1.)
If you want to chat with someone who isn’t in your Chat list, click in the
Chat search box, start to type the contact’s name, select his or her name
from the list of contacts that appears, and then select Invite to Chat from
the options list that appears, as shown in Figure 7-2. This will let your
contact know you want to talk. (At this point, you can also add the person
to your Chat list by selecting Show in Chat List from the options list.)
The Chat Invitations window appears.
3. In the Chat Invitations window, enter the e-mail address(es) of the
contact(s) with whom you want to chat, and then click the Send
Invites button, as shown in Figure 7-3. Others that you can chat with
will also appear so you can make a group invitation.
104
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

After you send an invitation, a message appears in your invitee’s Gmail
window, asking if he or she wants to chat with you. (See Figure 7-4.)
Don’t be offended if he or she declines. Your contact may just be busy.
Also, if others want to chat with you, you receive similar invitations to
the one shown in Figure 7-4. You need to accept their invitations if you
also want to chat.

Chapter 7: Chatting with Gmail Chat and Google Talk

Chatting away in Gmail Chat
After you set up everything for your chat and your contact has responded,
start chatting! (See Figure 7-5.) Click in the text box at the bottom of the chat
window, type a message, and press Enter to send the message.
You can use speech recognition software while chatting instead of typing. 
If you’re using speech recognition software, say “Press Enter” to send the
message.
Clicking the Pop-Out option separates your entry window from your conver-
sation, which allows you to see more of your conversation. Also, to help you
know what your partner in chat is doing, a message indicating that the
person is typing will appear.
You can hold multiple chats at the same time. You can open several contacts
in separate chat windows and talk to each of them independently. You can
also have a chat with multiple participants in the same window (if you invite
more than one person to a chat or are invited to a chat with multiple partici-
pants). You can have a lot of fun in a chat with multiple participants, but it
can prove hectic. If the chat gets a little busy, or if someone is chatting way
off topic, click the arrow to the right of Options and select Block <Name> to
block someone from your chat, as shown in Figure 7-6. Ah, the power you feel
blocking people right and left!

Chapter 7: Chatting with Gmail Chat and Google Talk
Keeping track of chats
If you need to keep a record of a chat you had in
Gmail Chat or Google Talk for any reason, Gmail
makes it easy by sending you an e-mail mes-
sage containing the entire chat text, as shown
in the following figure. And, because you can
store and archive all your e-mail, you can
always get to the chat record any time you
want.
You can search for old chats as easily as you
can search all your mail messages (which we
explain how to do in Chapter 4). Simply enter
any part of the chat that you can remember in
the search window (a few key words will do),
and options start appearing. You can also
search for chats by contact name or by date.
Changing your status for Chat
If you’re signed into Gmail, you normally show up as online and available to
chat to other people. To change your status (say, if you’re busy and don’t
want your status to appear as online), follow these steps:
1. To customize your personal chat settings, in the Chat section, click the
down arrow to the right of Set Status Here and choose one of the fol-
lowing options from the list that appears:
• Available: Let people know you’re available and willing to chat.
• Custom Message (for availability): Write a customized message that
people see when they check your availability.
• Busy: Let people know you’re busy and can’t chat right now.
• Custom Message (for busyness): Write a customized message that
everyone sees when you’re busy.
• Sign Out of Chat: Close chat down temporarily.
2. (Optional) To create a custom message, select the Custom Message
option (shown in Figure 7-7), click in the empty text box that appears,
and type a short message to your chat buddies. Clear this message
later by clicking Set Status and selecting the custom message.

Your custom message appears in your list of options, as shown in 
Figure 7-8. You can create several custom messages and apply them
whenever you wish.
Upgrading to Google Talk
If you need a more powerful instant-message application than Gmail Chat,
Google Talk is your answer. Google Talk is a gadget that you can add to your
Start Page, as shown in Figure 7-9. (See Chapter 3 if you need help adding this
gadget.)
If you’re running Windows, you can add functionality to your Google Talk
gadget, such as voice calls and file transfers, by downloading the Google Talk
client. Go to www.google.com/talk and click the Download Google Talk
button. Run the setup program and then log in, using your full e-mail address
and password.
Inviting a contact to chat in Google Talk
After you have Google Talk working, either from a gadget or from the client
itself, you need to sign in. (Albeit, if you are already signed into Gmail or
Google Apps, you will be recognized.) Your existing Gmail contacts
automatically appear. To begin chatting, select users just like you do in Gmail
Figure 7-8:

messages.

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

Chat (see the earlier section, “Inviting someone to chat in Gmail Chat.”) It’s a
snap to invite new friends or accept invitations.
To invite a contact to chat, follow these unbelievably easy steps:
1. Click on their name in the list.
2. Start typing or click Call to have a phone call.
Honestly, isn’t a simple call more personal than a bunch of text?
Use the search box (you know, the box with the spy glass in it) to find people
to talk with by entering in part of their names or e-mail addresses. After you
locate chat buddies, you can add them to your friends list and invite them 
to chat.
Chatting with a contact in Google Talk
Google Talk works a lot like the Chat application in Gmail, described earlier 
in this chapter. In fact, it’s almost 100 percent the same when it comes to
chatting.
Just like in Chat, you simply click in the text box at the bottom of the screen
(shown in Figure 7-10), type your message, and press Enter to send the mes-
sage. Your message appears in the window above the text box, and so do
replies from your contact.
Figure 7-9:
Add Google
Talk as a
gadget to

Page.
109
Chapter 7: Chatting with Gmail Chat and Google Talk

You can insert an emoticon into your message by typing any of the common
symbols, such as ;), which Google Talk replaces with a winking smiley in your
message when you press Enter. You can also click the smiley to the right of
the text box and select a face from the menu that appears.
While you’re using Google Talk, click the Email button in the upper-left corner
to quickly switch to Gmail. Also, if you don’t want to chat from within your
gadget, you can click the Pop Out button in the top-right corner, which opens
a separate window that you can use to talk. You may find the Pop Out feature
very helpful if you’re using other applications and don’t want to leave your
Start Page in the foreground of your desktop.
You can keep chats private by not creating an e-mail record of the messages
in your Gmail. (See the sidebar “Keeping track of chats,” in this chapter, for
more information about storing and searching chats.) Have a chat on the sly
by clicking the down arrow in the upper-right corner of the chat window and
selecting Go Off the Record from the list that appears (shown in Figure 7-11).
Don’t get the idea that someone can really block anything totally — 
appropriateness online matters. If you (or the person you’re chatting with)
feel the need to record an inappropriate message, you (or your contact) still
can, even if one or the other person selected Go Off the Record. For example,
as a last resort, you can snag a screen capture by pressing the Print Screen
(Prt Scn) key, opening up a graphics program, and pasting the screen cap-
ture. Private isn’t ever truly private in the online world.

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

Chatting with a group
After you establish your list of contacts, you can chat with any or all of them
as a group. Whether you are using Google Talk or Gmail Chat, setting up
groups is a breeze. Group chat is a great way to get input from other people
because you only have to respond once to a group rather than replying to
many different people individually in several different windows. Remember
how conference calling made meeting over the phone a whole lot easier?
Group chat is kind of like that.
After you have started a basic chat with a contact, click the Group Chat
button in Google Talk (see Figure 7-12) or select Group Chat from the Options
menu in Gmail Chat to add additional people to your conversation. In the text
box that appears at the top of the chat window, enter the e-mail addresses of
other users and press the Enter key. Right away, they will be able to begin
chatting along with you (assuming they’re online, of course).
To talk to someone privately outside of the group chat, click on that user’s
name in the Chat list and a separate tab (Talk) or chat window (Gmail Chat)
will appear.
Making a call
If you and a contact are both online, you can use Google Talk to make
voice calls.
Figure 7-11:
Block a
participant
or go off the
record.
111
Chapter 7: Chatting with Gmail Chat and Google Talk

Both you and your contact must have the Google Talk client installed on your
computers for this function to work. For best results, use a high-quality head-
set microphone and double-check to make sure the sound levels are set prop-
erly before you begin.
To start a call, pick the name of the person you want to call. When their card
appears, click the Call button or phone icon to the right of your contact’s
name, shown in Figure 7-13. You can then start a talkin’ . . . it’s that easy.

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

When you’re having a voice conversation in Google Talk, the talk window fea-
tures the following options and indicators:
 End Call: Clicking this button terminates the current voice call.
 Send Files: Click this button to locate a document or photo on your
computer that you want to send to your contact. (See Figure 7-14.) You
can also drag a file from your computer desktop into your chat window
to send it immediately.
 Send Voicemail: Click the down arrow to the right of the Send Files
button and select Send Voicemail from the list that appears when you
want to send someone a voice mail. If a contact doesn’t answer when
you try to call, you have the opportunity to leave a voice mail then, too.
Check out Figure 7-15.
Voice mail options are the same as the options you have for regular
voice calls. You can send voice mail to any of your contacts, even if they
don’t use Google Talk or Gmail. Voice mail messages appear alongside
regular messages in Gmail, and you can either play them directly from
Gmail or download them as MP3 files, as you can see in Figure 7-16.
 Mute: Click this button to turn your microphone off temporarily.
 Sound indicators: Shows with a volume indicator whether your Talk
software is receiving input from a microphone.

If you want to adjust your audio settings, click the Settings link in the
upper-right corner of the Google Talk client window, then choose Audio
from the options on the left. You may also have to adjust your volume
settings in your operating system’s control panel.
 Internet connection strength: Like bars on your mobile phone, these
bars indicate your Internet connection’s speed. The more bars, the
better.

f you’re like us, you never seem to have enough time. In spite of all the
technological advances in the last few decades (or even just the last few
years), every time you become more efficient, you quickly find something
else to throw in that slot of saved time. Google Calendar can help you keep
on time for all your daily events, whether you have to go watch a Little
League game, hit a proposal out of the park at an important meeting, or
pencil in some time for a power nap.
Google Calendar is an extremely useful calendar because it’s online. (See
Figure 8-1.) Instead of having to restrict it to a desktop computer or PDA, you
can access Calendar from virtually any device with an Internet connection,
just like the other Google Apps. With a few taps or clicks, you can view your
agenda on your iPhone, schedule a meeting on your PC, and share a calendar
with a colleague from an Internet café in Mumbai. In addition to having
Google Calendar readily available from any Web-enabled computer, you can
also easily use and share it.
This chapter takes you through logging into your Google Calendar, adding
and changing events, setting event reminders, searching for events, and
working with multiple calendars. (Chapter 9 covers how to share your 
calendar, access your appointments from a mobile phone, and sync up your
events with Outlook and other calendaring software.)

Do you love shortcuts? Google Calendar uses some handy keyboard short-
cuts that let you move around your calendar even faster. In this chapter, 
we let you know the keyboard shortcuts to save you time — for example, 
the Create Event shortcut is C. In this example, pressing the C key on your
keyboard allows you to create a new event and saves you a mouse click. You
can also find more keyboard shortcuts for all the Google Apps on the Cheat
Sheet at the beginning of this book.
Starting Calendar
Like with the other Google Apps that we describe in this book, you can set up
Calendar for the first time in a snap. You should already have a username and
password. Check with your administrator if you don’t.
Before you begin using Google Calendar for the first time, you may need 
to authenticate your Google Apps account, if you haven’t already. Flip to
Chapter 3 to review how to authenticate your account.

Calendar to

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

The first time you log into Google Calendar, you’re asked to set a time zone.
Establishing what time zone you’re in can help if you need to coordinate
schedules with colleagues in different time zones. (You can change the time
zone later by clicking the Settings link at the top of your calendar screen.)
You can access Google Calendar in two ways:
 Open Google Calendar from the Start Page: Open your browser and
navigate to your Start Page. On your Start Page, look for the Calendar
gadget, shown in Figure 8-2. (You can use this gadget to quickly view
your upcoming appointments.) Click the Google Calendar link in the 
title bar of the gadget to open your calendar.
 Go directly to Google Calendar: If you want to log into your Google
Calendar directly, you can access it by typing calendar and the 
domain name of your organization in the address bar of your Web
browser; for example, http://calendar.ardsleybooks.com. 
(Team Edition users should go to http://calendar.google.com/a/
yourdomain.com.) This address takes you to your Google Calendar
login page, as shown in Figure 8-3. Enter your username and password in 
the appropriate text boxes, then click the Sign In button to open 
your calendar.
You need to log in with your username and password every time you begin a
new session of Calendar.

Chapter 8: Filling Your Calendar

Creating and Changing Events
The most important Google Calendar procedure to know is how to add and
change events. A blank calendar, after all, isn’t very useful. Because users
routinely need to add and change events, Google makes it incredibly simple
to make those adjustments.
The following sections get you up and running in no time so that you can add
and change events to your heart’s delight. First, we show you five different
ways to add events, then we go over how to change and delete them.
Five ways to create events
You have multiple ways to add events easily to your calendar:
 Quick Add: Click the Quick Add link or press Q, and then simply click in
the text box that appears and type your event details, as shown in the
top of Figure 8-4. For example, you can enter something like Brunch
with Cal 11am Wednesday. Google Calendar can figure out what you’re
saying, and it adds an event based on what you type into the Quick Add
text box. It even creates recurring events if you enter an event like
Carpool with John 6:30am every Tuesday and Thursday.
 Highlight a time: Using your mouse, click and drag to highlight a block
of time. A white speech bubble will appear, similar to the one shown in
Figure 8-4. Click in the What text box and type your event, then click the
Create Event button.
Figure 8-3:

zation’s

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

If you want to add more event details, such as notes, locations, recurring
options, or to add guests, click the Edit Event Details link rather than the
Create Event button. This will take you to the Event Details screen,
shown in Figure 8-5.
 Create Event: Click the Create Event link or press C to specify additional
event details. On the Event Details screen that appears, you can specify
What, When, Where, a Description, as shown in Figure 8-5.

119
Chapter 8: Filling Your Calendar

Here are some hints for entering event details:
• What: Enter a brief description of the event in the What text box. Is
it a meeting? A softball game? A trip to the stylist?
• When: Click in the When or To text box to make a pop-up calendar
appear. This calendar helps you pinpoint the day on which an
event begins or ends. When you click in the time text boxes, a
drop-down list that features the time of day in half-hour increments
appears. Select the day from the calendar and the time from the
drop-down list, or type them in the appropriate text boxes.
Selecting the All Day check box makes the event appear at the top
of that particular day on your daily or weekly calendar.
• Repeats: Choose from this drop-down list whether you want your
event to repeat daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and more. Depending
on what option you select, more options appear so that you can
choose for how long you want the event to repeat. For example, if
you choose Weekly from the Repeats drop-down list, the options to
choose whether the event repeats every week and for how many
weeks the event will repeat appears.
• Where: Enter a description of where the event takes place. If you
enter a street address, the next time you look at your event, a Map
link appears in the event speech bubble or in the Event Details
screen. Clicking that link loads the address in Google Maps, which
appears in a new window.
• Calendar: By default, events that you enter go to your main 
calendar (the one that is titled with your name). When you add
multiple calendars, a Calendar drop-down list will appear and you
can choose to add the event to a different calendar by choosing
that calendar from the list.
• Description: Add details, such as directions or what you need to
bring, or write a reminder to yourself.
When you finish entering the event’s details, click the Save button to
save the event and place it in your calendar.
 Receive an invitation: We discuss invitations in detail in Chapter 9, 
but here’s a heads-up: If another Google Calendar user invites you to 
a meeting, that meeting appears automatically on your calendar with a
question mark in the corner. Click the event to see the event bubble, as
shown in Figure 8-6. You can tell the event host whether you can attend
or not by clicking the Yes, No, or Maybe links. The event host receives
your response automatically when you click one of these links. Declined
events appear faded out in your calendar.
120
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

 Add an event in Gmail: You don’t have to be in Calendar to add events.
If someone sends you an e-mail with some dates and times, Gmail asks
you whether you want to add the events discussed in the e-mail to your
calendar, as shown in Figure 8-7. To add the events to your calendar
from Gmail, click the Add to Calendar link that appears to the right of
your e-mail message. A new Event Details window appears. Check the
event details to see if they are correct and make any changes you want,
and click Save Changes.
Moving your events around
An old saying goes that the only constant in life is change. Fortunately,
making changes is easy in Google Calendar. When your meeting gets resched-
uled and you need to move that event to a different time, you can change the
event in your calendar in these ways:
 To change the time of an event: Simply click the shaded area of the
event and drag it to the new time slot.
 To extend or shorten an event: Click and drag the double white lines
along the bottom edge down to extend the event or up to shorten it.

Chapter 8: Filling Your Calendar

 To make more specific changes to an event: Simply click the event 
and click the Edit Event Details link in the speech bubble that appears.
Check out the previous section for additional info about the Event
Details screen that appears.
If you change an event that you didn’t create (such as a lunch your supervi-
sor invited you to), the event doesn’t change in the host’s calendar. Make
sure you call or e-mail your host so he or she can change the event in his or
her calendar, too.
Deleting events
To delete an event, simply click an event, then click the Delete link in the
speech bubble that appears. Also, if you double-click an event, the Event
Details screen appears, and you can click the Delete button at the top of 
that screen to delete that appointment.
Setting Up Calendar Notifications
When you have events in your calendar, you can set Google Calendar to send
you a reminder before an event. After all, what’s the use of having an online
calendar if you have to keep looking at it to see what’s coming up in your
day? Depending on how you set notifications, Google Calendar either shows
you a pop-up reminder, sends a text message to your mobile phone, or sends
you a friendly e-mail.
In the following sections, we cover how to set up universal event reminders
for all your calendar events, then show you how to create custom reminders
for only specific, very important events.
To see pop-up reminders, you must have a browser window open and Google
Calendar loaded. To receive text messages, you must register your mobile
phone (which we tell you how to do in the “Registering your mobile phone to
receive notifications” section, later in this chapter).
Creating universal event reminders
By default, your primary calendar displays a pop-up window ten minutes
prior to every event you create. You may like this feature, or you may not.
Whatever your preference, changing this setting is as easy as pie. Just 
follow these steps:
122
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

1. To change your notifications, click the arrow to the right of a calendar
from the list on the left side of the screen (your main calendar appears
with your name as the title), and then select Notifications from the
drop-down list that appears, as shown at the top of Figure 8-8.
The Notifications tab appears, as shown at the bottom of Figure 8-8.
2. In the Event Reminders section of the Notifications tab, select Pop-Up,
Email, or SMS (text message) from the By Default, Remind Me Via
drop-down list; then select how soon before each event you want to
receive the reminder from the Before Each Event drop-down list.
If SMS doesn’t appear in the By Default, Remind Me Via drop-down list
and you want to receive reminders on your mobile phone, follow the
steps in the following section to register your mobile phone with Google
Calendar, then return to these steps.
3. Click the Add Another Reminder link to add up to five total 
notifications.
Figure 8-8:

Chapter 8: Filling Your Calendar

4. In the Choose How You Would Like to Be Notified section, select 
the check boxes in the Email or SMS column (depending on which
method you prefer).
For example, select the check box in the Email column to the right of
New Invitations to receive an e-mail notification when someone sends
you an invitation to an event.
5. To disable a notification, click the Remove link to the right of the
reminder.
6. When you’re happy with your settings, click the Save button to 
return to your calendar.
Registering your mobile phone 
to receive notifications
Before your mobile phone can receive notifications from and communicate
with your calendar, you must first register your phone with Google Calendar
by following these steps:
1. From the Notifications screen, click the Set Up Your Mobile Phone to
Receive Notifications link.
Alternatively, from your main calendar, click the Settings link at the top
of the page, and then click the Mobile Setup tab. The Mobile Setup tab
appears, as shown in Figure 8-9.
2. Choose your country from the Country drop-down list.
3. Click in the Phone Number text box and enter your mobile

4. Select your carrier from the Carrier drop-down list.
If your carrier doesn’t appear in the Carrier drop-down list, click the
What Carriers Are Supported? link. If you are trying to connect from 
outside of the United States and the Carrier drop-down list doesn’t
appear, click the See Help Center for Supported Providers link. A list
appears in a new window with all the supported carriers worldwide. 
If your provider appears on the Help Center page and is supported,
return to your calendar notification settings, leave the Carrier field
blank, and continue to Step 5.
5. Click the Send Verification Code button.
A text message appears on your phone within a few minutes.
6. Click in the Verification Code text box and type the code that you
received in your phone’s text message, and then click the Finish 
Setup button.
Although SMS notifications are free from Google, your mobile carrier may
charge you for each text message that you send or receive. Be sure to 
check your phone’s plan before you use SMS reminders extensively.
Adding reminders to individual events
You can easily set reminders for individual events. Follow these steps to
make sure you don’t miss that important meeting or softball game:
1. Click an event that you want to add a reminder to, and then click the
Edit Event Details or More Details link at the bottom of the speech
bubble that appears.
You’re taken to the Event Details screen.
2. In the Options pane on the right of the Event Details screen, click 
the Add a Reminder link to add up to five different notifications, as
shown in Figure 8-10.
3. Use the drop-down lists to select what type of notification you want
and when.
For example, to receive an e-mail reminder an hour before the event,
select Email from the left drop-down list and 1 Hour from the right 
drop-down list.
4. Click the Remove link to disable a notification.
The event reminder disappears right away, and you’ll have to rely on
your own memory.
5. Click the Save button to save your changes and return to your 
calendar.

Changing Your Calendar Views
Google Calendar lets you change the way you view your schedule — just 
click the blue tabs in the top-right corner of your screen. Here are the basic
calendar views:
 Day: Click the Day tab or press D to view your appointments for a given
day, starting with the first upcoming event.
 Week: Click the Week tab or press W to see a full week’s worth of events.
All-day events appear along the top of the calendar.
You can customize your week view to start on a day other than Sunday
or to hide weekends. Click the Settings link in the top-left corner of the
screen, then click the arrows to the right of Week Starts On and Show
Weekends, and select the options that you want from the drop-down
lists that appear. Then scroll to the bottom of the Settings screen and
click Save to return to your calendar.
 Month: Click the Month tab or press M to see your month at a glance.
 Next 4 Days: Click the Next 4 Days tab or press X to see this custom
view. To change the time period, click the Settings link at the top 
of the screen and locate the Custom View section (it’s halfway down 
the Settings screen). Select your favorite custom time frame from the
drop-down list in the Custom View section, such as Next 2 Days to 
Next 4 Weeks.
 Agenda: Click the Agenda tab or press A to see your agenda. The 
agenda is handy because it lists all the Calendar items in a condensed,
easy-to-read format. When you click any event, it expands to show you
the details.
You don’t have to be limited to the options in the preceding list. You can 
view any number of days, from one day to seven weeks, by highlighting the
days on the mini-calendar on the left of any of the calendar screens.
Figure 8-10:
Add a
reminder in
the Options
pane.
126
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

After you find a view that you like, use the arrows at the top left to move 
forward and backward in increments of that time period. You can also press
N to move forward and P to move backward. To return to the current day,
click the Today button or press T.
Printing Your Calendar
You can use Google Calendar’s powerful print feature to print a copy of any
calendar view or save your calendar to a PDF that you can send to others.
Simply select your preferred calendar view (see the preceding section for
details), and then click the Print link to the left of the tabs. The Calendar
Print Preview window appears, as shown in Figure 8-11.
In the Calendar Print Preview window, you can adjust the size of the font 
by selecting from the Font Size drop-down list, choose which direction you
want it to print by selecting from the Orientation drop-down list, and print
the calendar in black and white (which is best for laser printers) by selecting
the Black & White check box. (To print in color, make sure the Black & White
check box is deselected.) Click the Print button to complete printing. Click
the Save As button to download a PDF version to your desktop.

Chapter 8: Filling Your Calendar

To print a blank calendar, return to your calendar screen and deselect the
check box beside each of your calendars in the Calendars list on the left 
of the screen, and then click the Print link. When you finish, select the 
calendars’ check boxes again to make your events reappear.
Using Multiple Calendars
In the sections earlier in this chapter, we cover how to create events, how 
to add notifications, how to change your calendar view, and how to print
your calendar. All these tools are pretty exciting, but in case you were 
worried, you have even more that you can explore in Google Calendar.
In the following sections, we show you how to create multiple calendars 
(for example, one for work, one for your bowling league, and one for your
weekend adventures). We also cover how you can add public calendars, 
such as sports schedules, daily closing stock prices, and holidays. Put all
your cares on Google Calendar so you can spend less time remembering
appointments and more time doing the stuff you love.
Adding calendars
First things first — check out the Add menu in the Calendars list to the left 
of your main calendar by clicking the arrow to the right of Add. You can see 
it in action in Figure 8-12. Using the options in this menu, you can create 
calendars, add public calendars, and more. Here’s what each option in the
Add menu does:
 Create a New Calendar: Select this option to create a separate calendar
for your bowling league, child’s soccer schedule, or other events that
you don’t want to appear on your main calendar.
Figure 8-12:
Use the Add
menu to
create and
show
additional
calendars.
128
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

 Add a Public Calendar: Select this option to explore calendars that
others have made, including holidays, your alma mater’s football game
schedule, or stock quotes, and have them appear in your calendar next
to your other events. When you select this option, you will see a screen
that lets you browse the most popular public calendars. You can also
use the Search text box at the top of the Calendar gallery screen to
search for any of hundreds of others. To add a public calendar, simply
click the Add to Calendar button. (The Calendar gallery is similar to the
gadget directory that we discuss in Chapter 3.)
To follow stocks, enter the ticker symbol of your favorite company in the
Search text box at the top of the Calendar gallery screen and click the
Search Public Calendars button. Look for the Google Finance calendar
for the company you want and click the Add to Calendar button. Each
day’s closing price appears at the top of each day on your calendar.
 Add a Friend’s Calendar: Co-workers who use Google Calendar have
shared calendars by default. To show a friend’s or colleague’s calendar
alongside your calendar, first select this option and then enter your 
contact’s e-mail address in the text box on the screen that appears.
Finally, click the Add button to the right of the text box and your con-
tact’s shared calendar appears automatically so you can see what that
contact is up to. If he or she doesn’t have Google Calendar, you can
invite him or her to create a calendar.
However, not all calendars may be available. We discuss how to make
your calendar private in Chapter 9.
 Add by URL: When you come across a Web site that has a calendar feed
that you want to add to your Google Calendar, copy the URL, and then
return to your calendar. Click the Add menu in the Calendars list on the
left-hand side of the screen, select Add by URL, and in the screen that
appears, paste the URL into the Public Calendar Address text box. Don’t
forget to click the Add button when you’re done.
 Import Calendar: Use this tool to add events from another calendar 
program, such as Outlook or iCal. See Chapter 9 for instructions on how
to import and export events.
Changing colors and settings
Whether you have only a few or a whole plethora of calendars, you can 
easily manage them from the Calendars list. To hide calendar events tied to 
a specific calendar, deselect the check box beside each calendar name. Select
the check box again when you want to show that calendar. You may find
hiding calendars particularly handy if your calendar is bursting with events.
129
Chapter 8: Filling Your Calendar

In addition to selecting or deselecting the calendars’ check boxes, clicking
the down arrow to the right of a calendar gives you some more options,
including specifying colors for that calendar (refer to the top of Figure 8-8):
 Display Only This Calendar: Instead of checking and unchecking boxes
every time you want to see the events related to a specific calendar,
select this option to see only the events on that calendar on your main
calendar screen. Other calendars and events disappear from your 
main calendar screen until you select the calendars’ check boxes again.
 Hide This Calendar from the List: Selecting this option makes the 
calendar disappear from the list. Click the Manage Calendars link at the
bottom of the Calendars list for options to reveal, hide, and delete your
calendars.
 Calendar Settings: Select this option to open the Calendar Details
screen. You can change the calendar name and description, and see the
calendar address. In the Calendar Details tab, you can also access the
tool that you can use to embed your calendar on a Web page, which we
cover in Chapter 9.
 Create Event on This Calendar: Selecting this option does the same
thing as clicking the Create Event link at the top of the main Calendar
screen, except it automatically assigns the event to the specific calendar.
(When you have multiple calendars and click the Create Event link, 
you can specify on which calendar you want to create your event by
choosing from the Calendar drop-down list on the Create Event screen.)
 Share This Calendar: Select this option to show the Calendar Details
screen, where you can choose how much information you want to share
for each calendar. We cover calendar sharing in depth in Chapter 9.
 Notifications: New calendars don’t have notifications by default, but 
you can change those settings by selecting Notifications and choosing
your options on the Calendar Details screen. (See the section “Setting 
Up Calendar Notifications,” earlier in this chapter, for details.)
 Color: Clicking a color box changes all the events associated with that
calendar to the selected color. In addition to being visually appealing,
choosing different colors for different calendars can help you tell at 
a glance what’s going on when and if you have any schedule conflicts.
Feel free to adjust these settings until you find a calendar that makes you
smile. For more control over these settings, click the Manage Calendars 
link at the bottom of the Calendars list.
Be careful not to click the trash can icon in the Calendars screen (click the
Manage Calendars link to go to the Calendars screen) unless you’re certain
that you want to delete a calendar. (See Figure 8-13.) You can add public 
calendars again, but if you delete one of your main calendars without sharing
it with someone first, you have no way to get it back.

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

Searching Your Calendar
Search is one of our favorite features of Google Calendar. Sometimes, you
may forget an event. You may even forget on which calendar the event is
located. No problem. Just click in the Search text box at the top of your
Calendar screen or press / (the backslash key); type a few words about the
event, such as lunch; and click the Search My Calendars button. A list of all
the lunches you have on your calendars appears, as shown in Figure 8-14.
Type in even more information, and you can find more specific events. Click
the Search My Calendars button to see results across all your calendars.
Your search results appear in a new tab along the top, so you can switch
between your normal calendar views and compare results. In your search
results, click the date to the left of an event to see that day’s agenda. Click
the event time or name to see and edit the event’s details.

Chapter 8: Filling Your Calendar

You can also use the Search text box to find public calendars at any time, as
discussed in the section “Adding calendars,” earlier in this chapter.
You can usually use the Search text box at the top of your Calendar screen to
find the event that you can’t remember. Suppose, however, that you want to
see only meetings with your colleague Janice in a certain time period, and
you can’t remember any of the meeting specifics. Google has the answer. The
Show Search Options link appears (in tiny type) to the right of the Search text
box. Click that link to reveal more specific search text boxes, as shown in
Figure 8-15. You can add details, such as a date range, that narrow the search
results. Click the Search button, and your results appear.
When you finish with the advanced search, click the Cancel button or the
Hide Search Options link in the top-right corner to hide the search options
and return to the basic calendar screen.

In This Chapter
 Inviting guests to events
 Changing calendar sharing settings
 Scheduling events
 Putting your calendar on a Web site
 Migrating from Outlook to Google Calendar
 Accessing Calendar on your mobile device
A
lthough it can’t add an extra hour to every day, Google Calendar 
can be a huge time-saver for organizations, schools, businesses, and
families. You can send out meeting and event invitations, and track people’s
responses, even if they use other calendaring programs. You can also share
your calendar with people you know simply by sending them an e-mail, 
and you can create a public calendar to which anyone can subscribe. So, 
if your organization is going to have a fundraiser, you can easily publicize 
it by displaying it on your internal or external Web site.
An online calendar does you no good if you can’t coordinate schedules or
take your valuable information with you on the go. So, those brilliant Google
engineers pulled together all the powerful collaborating tools to make your
calendar work for you and your colleagues and play well with the other
Google Apps.
Now, families can keep track of those family reunions, and parents can 
coordinate their kids’ schedules from home or work. Salespeople can track
leads and follow up with their customers. Schools can let teachers book 
time in the library, share a mobile computer lab, or work with parents to 
help their students. And don’t forget about college students — they can
follow a class schedule and book time with their study group by using the
campus-wide Google Calendar.
This chapter shows you how to invite people to events, coordinate team
meetings when everyone has a different schedule, reserve a conference room
or equipment, publish your calendar to a Web site, and then take all your
information with you — either on your laptop (with Outlook or iCal) or your
Internet-enabled mobile device.

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 
Working with Invitations
How about a picnic or a party? You can easily send out invitations to any 
kind of event, whether it’s a business meeting or poker night. Anyone can
receive your invitations, even if they don’t use Google Calendar or don’t 
have a Google account.
Creating invitations
Sending event invitations is a breeze; just follow these steps:
1. To invite guests to a new event, click the Create Event link on the
main Calendar screen; to invite guests to an event that already exists
on your calendar, click the event to reveal its speech bubble and then
click the Edit Event Details link.
On the Event Details screen, look for the pane titled Guests, as shown on
the left side of Figure 9-1.
2. In the text box in the Guests pane, enter the e-mail addresses of
people that you want to invite to your event. Separate each address
with a comma.
You can also click the Choose from Contacts link to select guests from
your Contacts list, as shown on the right side of Figure 9-1.
3. Select the check boxes in the Guests Can section if you want to allow
guests to invite others and see the guest list.
Figure 9-1:
Enter other
users’
e-mail
addresses
to add them
to an event
as guests.

4. When you finish adding your guests, click the Save button at the top
of the Event Details screen.
The Send Update dialog box appears, giving you the option to send an
e-mail to invite your guests.
5. Click the Send button to send the invitation or the Don’t Send button
to save your event without notifying your guests.
Each of your guests promptly receives an e-mail message that asks 
him or her whether he or she plans to attend. Those guests who use
Google Calendar see the event appear automatically on their calendars
with a question mark in the event’s top-right corner. Guests who use
Outlook can respond directly from the e-mail, and the event appears
automatically on their Outlook calendar, as well.
Responding to invitations
You (or your guests) can respond to invitations in one of two ways. First, you
can click a link in the e-mail that you receive, as shown in Figure 9-2. Simply
click the Yes, No, or Maybe link, and the host’s event is updated to indicate
your response.
Figure 9-2:
Click a

know
whether
you’re
coming.
135
Chapter 9: Sharing Your Calendar with Others

Alternatively, you can respond directly from Google Calendar by clicking 
an event that shows a question mark in the top-right corner, and then in the
event bubble that appears, clicking Yes, No, or Maybe, as shown in Figure 9-3.
If you click Yes, the question mark disappears. If you click No, the event
becomes faded out and the question mark disappears. If you click Maybe, 
the question mark remains, but your host will know that you’re considering
attending. You can always change your response later by clicking the 
event again.
Checking guest status 
and e-mailing guests
When your event draws near, you may want to see how many people are
planning to attend. You can check the status of your guests’ responses by
double-clicking the event, as shown in Figure 9-4.
Figure 9-4:

Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

If you decide to change event details later in the Event Details screen, click
Save and a dialog box appears, asking if you want to notify the guests about
the change. To get in touch with your guests at any time, click the Email
Guests link in the Guests pane to send a quick message. An e-mail window
appears, similar to Figure 9-5. Don’t forget to select the Send a Copy 
to Myself check box if you want to receive a copy of the message, as well.
Sending invitations directly from Gmail
Gmail likes to help you play the part of super awesome scheduler, too. Click
the Add Event Info link, just below the subject line in the Compose Message
window, to expand the event info area, allowing you to enter details for an
event, as shown in Figure 9-6.

Chapter 9: Sharing Your Calendar with Others

Enter your event details (see Chapter 8 for more on how to get the event
details right), type your message, and click the Send button. The event is
automatically added to your calendar, as well as your guests’ calendars.
Everyone can respond in the customary fashion. (See the “Responding 
to invitations” section, earlier in this chapter.)
Making Your Calendar 
Available to Others
You can share your calendar with your friends, your soccer team, your family,
and your colleagues. When you share with others, you can see each other’s
calendars side by side. By default, your main calendar can be accessed by
other Google Apps users in your organization (or Internet domain), but no
one outside of it. In the following sections, we go over how to adjust your
sharing settings and make your calendar private, if you want.
Sharing options
For each calendar that you manage, you can select how you want to share
your events with others. To change these settings, click the down arrow
beside a calendar in the Calendars list and select Share This Calendar from
the drop-down list that appears. The Events Details screen appears with 
the Share This Calendar tab active, similar to Figure 9-7.
Depending on what your administrator chooses, you may or may not be able
to share details from your main calendar with people outside your organiza-
tion. Be sure to click the Save button after you make any changes.
Figure 9-7:
Choose 
how much
information
you want to
share.
138
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

The Share This Calendar tab has the following areas:
 Share with Everyone: Choose how much event information you want 
to make publicly available. If you choose any option except the Do Not
Share with Everyone radio button, anyone can search your publicly
available calendar.
 Share with My Domain: Choose how much information you want your
co-workers or colleagues to see.
 Share with Specific People: Allow individuals to view and/or manage
events on your calendar. We cover these options in depth in the 
following section.
For the first two sections in the preceding list, you have the following
options, which you can change at any time:
 Do Not Share with Everyone: If you select this radio button, no one
other than individuals to whom you specifically give permission can
access your calendar. This is the most private setting.
 Share All My Information on This Calendar with Everyone: Select 
this radio button if you want your co-workers or anyone, in general, to
see your event details. Although we don’t recommend using this setting
to share your main calendar outside of your domain, you must select
this radio button for calendars that you want to post on a Web site.
 Share Only My Free/Busy Information (Hide Details): Select this 
radio button to allow others to see when you have openings in your
schedule but not allow them to see event specifics. They see only 
blocks labeled Busy in time periods in which you have scheduled
events, as Figure 9-8 shows.
Figure 9-8:
Share your
time without
giving away
any details.
139
Chapter 9: Sharing Your Calendar with Others

Sharing with specific people
Not only can you let others see your calendar events, but you can give your
friends and co-workers permission to make changes and add events, as well
as invite others to join in.
Follow these steps to give a specific person permission to make changes on
your calendar:
1. In the Calendars list, select Share This Calendar from the appropriate
calendar’s drop-down list.
The Share This Calendar tab appears (refer to Figure 9-7).
2. In the Add a New Person text box, enter the e-mail address of the
person with whom you want to share your calendar.
If the e-mail address that you’re adding is one of your contacts, the name
appears automatically below the text box while you type.
3. From the drop-down list in the Add a New Person section, choose
what permissions you want to give that person. You can choose one of
the following options:
• Make Changes AND Manage Sharing: Your friend or colleague can
add, delete, and change events and also allow or deny other
people access to make changes to your calendar.
• Make Changes to Events: Your friend or co-worker can add and
delete events or make changes to event details on your calendar.
• See All Event Details: Other users can see all your event details on
your calendar, but can’t make any changes.
• See Free/Busy Information (No Details): Other people can see when
your events are scheduled, but can’t view event details. Events will
only say Busy (refer to Figure 9-8).
4. Click the Add Person button.
Google Calendar sends an e-mail to that user to let him or her know that
you’ve shared a calendar, and it also automatically adds your calendar
to his or her Google Calendar.
5. Repeat these steps for any other people with whom you want to share
your calendar.
Scheduling Resources
The Google Apps Calendar lets you easily find the best time and place for
everyone to meet. When you share calendars across your organization, you
140
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

can view other people’s schedules and immediately find the time slot that
works well for everyone. Coordinating schedules has never been so simple. If
you’re using Premier Edition or Education Edition, you can schedule rooms,
equipment, and other resources so the end-of-year party can go off without a
hitch. (Sorry, non-Google Apps Google Calendar users, you don’t get to work
with other people’s schedules, so go ahead and skip over this section.)
Coordinating other people’s schedules
When you need to schedule a meeting and you’re not sure what time is opti-
mal for everyone, follow these steps:
1. Click the Create Event link.
You see the Event Details screen, where you can add the specifics of
your meeting or party.
2. Click the Check Guest and Resource Availability link.
The Find a Time window, similar to Figure 9-9, appears.
3. Add a person to the list of attendees by clicking in the text box below
the timeline, entering the name or e-mail address of the person that
you want to attend, and then clicking the Add button.
Every time you click the Add button, each person’s schedule appears in
the timeline, showing blocks of time in which they already have events.
If your organization is using Google Apps Premier Edition or Education
Edition, you also see a Room Finder section below the timeline. The 
following section explains more about using the Room Finder.
Now you can find a time that’s free for everyone; to move forward or
backward a time period, click the blue arrow bars to the right or left of
the timeline, or click and drag the gray bar along the top of the timeline
left or right.
4. Highlight a block of time on the timeline that works best for every-
one, and then click the OK button in the lower-right corner of the
Find a Time window.
Figure 9-9:
Find the
time that

141
Chapter 9: Sharing Your Calendar with Others

Your event details are updated to include the attendees that you create
in Step 3 and the time that you select in Step 4.
The thin bar directly below the hours in the schedule shows how heav-
ily people are scheduled. Each busy person at a particular time makes
the bar darker. If you can’t find a free time slot (which appears white in
the bar), look for light gray striped areas, which have only one or two
busy people at that time. Hover your mouse cursor over a busy guest’s
scheduled block to see the details of that particular event, if they’re
being shared. Then check with that person about the possibility of
changing a conflicting appointment.
5. Back on the Event Details screen, enter your additional event details,
such as a description and reminders, and click Save.
Just like when you add guests (see the “Creating invitations” section,
earlier in this chapter), a dialog box appears that asks whether you want
to send invitations to your attendees.
6. Click the Send button to send the invitations or the Don’t Send button
to leave your attendees in the dark (the event will still appear on 
their calendar).
Using the Room Finder (Premier Edition
and Education Edition only)
With Google Apps Premier Edition and Education Edition, you can schedule
rooms and equipment, such as lecture halls, projectors, or company vehicles,
in addition to coordinating schedules and times (see the previous section).
When you click the Check Guest and Resource Availability link in the Event
Details screen, the Find a Time window opens, and the Room Finder section
appears below the timeline, as shown in Figure 9-10. Use the Filter Room list
box to quickly find the room or object that you’re looking for. If it’s available
during the time that you select (we explain how to set an event’s time in the
preceding section), a green box appears to the left of the room name. If it’s
not available, a red X appears to the left of it, instead. Just like when you add
attendees, select a room from the list and click the Add Room button to show
the room’s schedule. Locate a room or object that works well for you and
your guests, as well as a time during which the room or object is available,
and then click OK. When you save your event, the time that you specify for
the event is blocked out on the room’s or object’s calendar so that others
can’t double-book it.

Embedding Calendar on 
Your Web Site or Blog
While we’ve been surfing the Internet over the years, we’ve come across
many organizations (particularly schools) that attempt to share calendars 
on their Web sites. Often, the tools that they use are so complicated (and
frustrating) that the calendars falls into disrepair, and no one ever updates 
or visits them again. Is there something Google Calendar can do about it?
Absolutely!
Google Calendar is easy to use and share in general. You can place your 
calendar on a Web site just as simply. And the best part is that after you put
your calendar on a Web site, Google automatically updates it every time you
add a new event, so you don’t have to think twice about whether it’ll work.
These steps show how to place your code by using Google Page Creator
(check out http://pages.google.com or if you’re a Google Apps adminis-
trator, see Chapter 15), but the steps work for just about any HTML editor:
1. Create a new calendar by clicking the Add button in the Calendars 
list and selecting Create a New Calendar.
You see the Calendar Details screen.
You probably don’t want to share your personal calendar (and your
administrator may restrict sharing outside of your domain), so creating
a new calendar will be useful. If you already have an additional calendar
you want to share, select Share This Calendar from that calendar’s 
drop-down list to go to the Calendar Details screen.
2. Enter a name for your calendar, and then select the Share All
Information on This Calendar with Everyone radio button in the
Share with Everyone section.

Chapter 9: Sharing Your Calendar with Others

As soon as you select the radio button, a dialog box appears, asking
whether you’re sure that you want to share your calendar with every-
one. If you click Yes, the events on your specific calendar will be avail-
able to the public and anyone will be able to search for your events.
3. To make your calendar available to publish on the Web, click the Yes
button in the Are Your Sure? dialog box, and then click the Save
button at the bottom of the screen.
You may see another dialog box asking you once again if you are really,
really sure that you want your calendar shared with everyone on the
Internet. Click the Yes button once again if this box appears.
4. Configure your Web page calendar by clicking the arrow to the 
right of your calendar’s name in the Calendars list and clicking the
Calendar Settings link in the drop-down list that appears.
Scroll down to the Embed This Calendar tool, as shown in Figure 9-11. If
you want a simple, full-screen monthly calendar, just select the HTML
code that appears in the text box and copy it, then skip to Step 6.
5. (Optional) Customize your calendar by clicking the Customize the
Color, Size, and Other Options link.
Okay, now’s the time to let your creative juices flow. A new window like
the one in Figure 9-12 opens. The calendar on the right in the figure is a
preview of the calendar as it will appear on your site. Select any of the
options on the left and then click the Update HTML button to see your
changes. When you’re satisfied with a calendar and are ready to show it
on your site, select the final HTML code that appears in the text box at
the top of the window and copy it.
6. Open your HTML editor and paste the HTML code you copied in Step
4 or Step 5. To use Google Page Creator to paste the code into your
Web site and publish the page, follow these steps:
a. In Google Page Creator, open the page on which you want to place
the calendar by clicking the page title on the Site Manager screen.
Figure 9-11:

b. Click inside the section of the page where you want to place your cal-
endar, and then click the Edit HTML link in the bottom-right corner of
the screen.
A window appears on your screen, similar to Figure 9-13, that
enables you to paste your code.
c. Paste the code into the large text box and click the Update button to
return to your page and continue editing.
While you’re editing the HTML, you can click the Preview tab in the
top-right corner of the screen to make sure your calendar appears
how you want it.

d. Make sure the calendar appears on your page how you want it, and
then click the Publish button.
Your changes will be saved, and now anyone who visits your page
will see your amazing calendar and be able to keep up with your
public events.
e. Click the View Live or Preview link to the right of the Publish button
to open your site in a new browser window and marvel at the beauty
that you created.

Importing and Exporting Events
The following sections guide you through moving your calendar from Outlook
to Google Calendar (and back . . . kind of).
We know that you might be using one of a bunch of other calendar programs,
too, but we can’t cover them all. If you want more specific instructions for
importing or exporting to Google Calendar from another type of calendar 
program, click the Help link in the top-right corner of your Google Calendar
window, then click the Import & Export topic link to see several help articles
with the directions you need.

Migrating events from Outlook 
to Google Calendar
Moving your events from Outlook to Google is a little tricky because you have
to click through several options when exporting from Outlook, but if you
follow the steps in the following sections, you shouldn’t have any problems.
To make things easier, we’ve broken the process into two parts. In the follow-
ing section, you export your events from Outlook; in the section “Importing
your events into Google Calendar,” later in this chapter, you upload them to
Google Calendar.
Exporting your events from Outlook
Before you export your appointments, decide which ones are important. Do
you want to include events from the past? How far in the future do you want
to go? If you have more than a year’s worth of events, Google recommends
breaking your calendar into multiple, one-year segments to avoid technical
errors in Outlook.
Outlook’s export function doesn’t export recurring events. Instead, it creates
individual items for each of your recurring events that falls within the time
frame you choose.
To export appointments from your Outlook calendar, follow these steps:
1. Start Outlook and choose File➪Import and Export.
The Import and Export Wizard window appears, as shown in Figure 9-15.
2. Select Export to a File from the list, and then click Next.
3. Click Comma Separated Values (Windows), and then click Next.
You see a list of all your Outlook folders, including e-mail, notes, to-do
lists, and calendars.
Figure 9-15:
Export your
Outlook
calendar to
a file.
147
Chapter 9: Sharing Your Calendar with Others

4. Select the calendar that you want to export from the list, and then
click Next.
If you only have one calendar, click the Calendar folder. You’re asked
where you want to save your exported calendar.
5. Click the Browse button and select where on your computer you want
to save the exported file, and enter a name for the file in the File
Name text box.
Select a place on your computer that you can easily find later (such as
the desktop) and enter a name that you can remember for later, too.
6. Click OK in the Browse window to return to the wizard, and then
click Next.
The next screen in the wizard lets you select the appointments you want.
There is usually only one option in the list and it is already checked.
7. Click Finish.
A new window appears, asking you to specify a date range for 
appointments to be exported.
8. In the Set Date Range window, type in the starting and ending dates
for the range of events that you want to export, and then click OK.
Outlook takes a moment and exports all your events, and you return to
the main Outlook screen.
9. Repeat these steps for each year that you want to export.
Importing your events into Google Calendar
Now for the easy part. Time to get those events online!
To import your Outlook calendar into Google Calendar, follow these steps:
1. Open Google Calendar.
If you want to import your events to a new calendar rather than any of
your existing ones, use the Add menu in the Calendars list to create a
new calendar.
2. From the Add menu in the Calendars list, select Import Calendar.
A screen that looks like Figure 9-16 appears.
3. Click the Browse button and locate the file you just exported 
(see the preceding section), and then click Open.
4. From the Choose Calendar drop-down list, select the calendar to
which you want to import events, and then click the Import button.
5. Click OK to return to your calendar.
Your imported events now appear alongside any events you create
online (see Chapter 8 for more about adding events).
148
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

6. Repeat these steps for any other calendar files that you exported 
from Outlook.
Subscribing to Google Calendar in Outlook
Google Calendar is an amazingly powerful online calendar. But, sometimes,
you may want to have your events available when you’re not connected to
the Internet. In this section, we show you a little trick to take your calendar
with you in Outlook 2007 or later (or iCal or Thunderbird, for that matter).
Subscribing to an online calendar is more convenient than simply download-
ing and importing your events. When you subscribe to Google Calendar, it
automatically updates and syncs your calendar whenever you change or add
events online, so you have to worry about updating it in only one place.
Even if you subscribe to Google Calendar in Outlook, you must still add and
change events directly in Google Calendar. Any events that you add in
Outlook don’t appear on your online calendar.
Okay, so the method we give you in this section isn’t the most intuitive, but it
works very well. Keep sharp in Steps 2 and 3. Follow these steps for a quick
and easy way to subscribe to your Google Calendar in Outlook 2007 or later:
1. In Google Calendar, go to your Calendars list and select Calendar
Settings from the appropriate calendar’s drop-down list.
2. Scroll down to the Private Address section and click the green ICAL
button, shown in Figure 9-17.
A gray box with a long Web address appears.
Don’t click the address!
Figure 9-16:
Import a
calendar
into Google
Calendar.
149
Chapter 9: Sharing Your Calendar with Others

If you don’t see the Private Address section, your administrator may
have restricted the sharing settings for your domain. These restrictions
only affect your primary calendar, however. Because you can’t subscribe
to your primary calendar in this case, you may want to try this method
with one of your other calendars.
If your calendar’s private address is ever compromised (for example, if
you share the address with your significant other and your relationship
sadly fizzles out), click the Reset Private URLs link to create a new 
subscription address. Subscriptions to the old address in Outlook will
no longer update with your new events, which means you’ll have to 
re-subscribe to your calendar in Outlook if this does happen.
3. Right-click the private address link and select Copy Link Location or
Copy Shortcut from the contextual menu that appears.
4. Click in your browser’s address bar and paste the address by pressing
Ctrl+V or by right-clicking in the address bar and selecting Paste from
the menu that appears.
5. Highlight the letters https at the beginning of the address and type
webcal, as shown in Figure 9-18.
This changes the link from a normal Web address to a calendar 
subscription address that Outlook will recognize when you open it.
6. Press Enter or click Go.
A security box may appear, asking whether you want to use Outlook.
Depending on your browser, click the Allow button or the Launch
Application button to open your calendar link in Outlook.

150
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

Outlook opens, and a dialog box appears, asking whether you want to
add the calendar and subscribe to updates, as shown in Figure 9-19.
7. Click the Yes button to add the calendar.
You can now see events in Outlook that you created in Google Calendar,
even when you’re not connected to the Internet. When you create new
events in Google Calendar, they will automatically appear in Outlook
when you connect to the Internet again.
8. Repeat these steps for any other Google Calendars to which you want
to subscribe in Outlook.
Exporting your events to a file
For that rare occasion when you want to save your events to your computer
or use events with another program, Google Calendar lets you export your
events into XML, iCal, or HTML files.
To export events in one of these file formats, follow these steps:
1. In the Calendars list, click the down arrow to the right of the calendar
you want to export and select Calendar Settings.
The Calendar Details screen appears.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and click the brightly colored
box for the format you want to export to:
• XML: Select this format if you want to access your calendar from a
feed reader, such as Google Reader (http://reader.google.
com) or FeedBurner (http://www.feedburner.com). Copy the
link and paste it into your reader to begin seeing event updates.
You can also save the XML file to your computer for use in other
more technical programs.
• ICAL: This is the best format to use for a simple export because it
can be opened easily in other calendar programs. Copy this link to
subscribe to your calendar in Outlook (see the previous section for
instructions).
Figure 9-19:
Click the Yes
button to

151
Chapter 9: Sharing Your Calendar with Others

• HTML: Copy this link to open a read-only version of your calendar.
Add it to your bookmarks when you want to quickly view your
events without having to log into Google Calendar. Click the
Configuration Tool link to customize your calendar (see the
“Embedding Calendar on Your Web Site or Blog” section, earlier in
this chapter).
3. To save the file to your computer, right-click the private address link
and choose Save File As from the contextual menu that appears.
4. In the dialog box that appears, browse to a folder on your computer,
such as the desktop, and click the Save button.
5. When you’re finished exporting your calendar, click OK to return to
your Calendar Details screen, and then click Cancel to return to your
calendar.
Using Calendar on Your Mobile Device
If you don’t have a cellphone, go to your nearest cellphone store and buy
one. They really are cool. Plus, once you have one you can access Google
Calendar events from it or virtually any mobile device. Woohoo!
The following list describes the two ways that you can access your calendar
on a mobile device (we cover both in more detail in the following sections):
 Google Calendar for Mobile: This method allows you to access a fea-
ture-rich version of your calendar on an iPhone, BlackBerry, or other
XHTML-capable phone.
 Short Messaging Service (SMS): That’s a fancy name for text messaging.
Send a text message to Google, and it messages you back with your
schedule details. This method is perfect for when you’re on the run and
need to know where you’re heading next.
As always, text messaging and mobile phone data plans generally aren’t free.
Please check with your mobile provider first to see whether you have access
and can afford it. Don’t blame us if your next cellphone bill rivals your rent or
mortgage payment.
Using Google Calendar for Mobile
To access Google Calendar for Mobile, open your mobile Web browser 
and enter your direct calendar address (it’s probably similar to the address
you use to access your normal Google Calendar; for example, http://
calendar.ardleybooks.com). A login screen may appear, asking you to
152
Part II: Keeping in Touch and on Time: Gmail, Talk, and Calendar 

enter your username and password. After your calendar loads, a simplified
version of it appears in Agenda mode, similar to the image on the right of
Figure 9-20.
To navigate your calendar, select any of the links on the screen. Clicking an
event reveals its details. Click in the Quick Add text box and enter event
information, then click Add Now to add a new event.
You can enter Quick Add events as a phrase, such as Tennis lessons every
Thursday at 9am.
Scheduling with SMS
Text messaging is a quick, easy way to find out what’s coming up on your
schedule — especially when you’re away from your computer. You need to
register your phone with your calendar first, though. Flip back to Chapter 8,
which explains how to set up calendar notifications on your mobile phone.
After you set up your phone with Google Calendar, you can simply send a 
text message by using one of the commands in the following bullet list to
GVENT (48368), and you receive a text message giving you the event 
information you request.
Although you can use the GVENT service for free, your mobile carrier may
charge for each text message that you send and receive. Check your plan
before using GVENT extensively.
Figure 9-20:
Access your
calendar
from your
smart phone
(left) or
other mobile
device
(right).
153
Chapter 9: Sharing Your Calendar with Others

Send any one of these commands in a text message to GVENT and wait for 
a response:
 NEXT: Receive the upcoming event for the day.
 DAY: Receive an agenda of today’s events.
 NDAY: Receive an agenda of tomorrow’s events.
 “Meeting tomorrow at 2pm”: Send event details to create a new event
on your calendar via Quick Add.
 HELP: Receive a list of these commands.
 STOP: Remove your phone number from Google Calendar to stop 
notifications and other calendar messages. You have to re-register your
phone to use GVENT again.

Documents,

In this part . . .
E
ver heard of singledocumindedness? We didn’t think
so. It’s a word that we made up to describe how
Google Docs changes the way you think about collabora-
tion and document storage. Beyond explaining how you
can take advantage of this new concept, this part takes
you through the Google Docs Home and shows you how
to create and share amazing documents, spreadsheets,
and presentations. Old-fashioned desktop software is
optional.

Chapter 10
Finding Your Way around 
the Google Docs Home
In This Chapter
 Looking at the pluses of Google Docs
 Getting started with Google Docs
 Putting the Docs Home to work
T
his part of the book gives you a good start with Google’s online word 
processing, spreadsheet, and presentation apps, collectively called
Google Docs. This chapter shows you how Google Docs are organized inside
the Google Docs Home. The Docs Home provides a trouble-free way to 
organize your word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation files.
Advantages of Google Docs 
and the Docs Home
Google Docs is an online office productivity software suite that includes three
powerful tools:
 Documents: An online word processing software app, similar to
Microsoft Word or WordPerfect. It’s called Documents, or Docs for short.
(Word processing documents are explored in detail in Chapter 11.)
 Spreadsheets: An online spreadsheet app, similar to Microsoft Excel,
Quattro Pro, or Lotus. (Spreadsheets are explained in detail in 
Chapter 12.)
 Presentations: A presentations app, similar to Microsoft PowerPoint.
(Presentations are discussed in detail in Chapter 13.)

The starting point for all your Google productivity apps is called the Docs
Home. This is document central, a powerful management tool that keeps
everything you create organized and at the ready. You can manage all your
documents, spreadsheets, and presentations from a single Docs Home, as
shown in Figure 10-1.
An obvious advantage of Google Docs is that you have access to your 
documents online anytime you need them from any computer in the world,
as long as it’s connected to the Web.
If you’ve ever lost a document before, you’ll quickly come to appreciate
another advantage of Google Docs — Google’s famous search abilities. 
The old, offline way of handling documents is to save them in folders. The
problem is, you can very easily forget what folder you saved a document in
when you need that document three months later.
The Docs Home deploys Google’s sophisticated search tools to find any 
document on any topic in your personal Docs library quickly, no matter how
many documents or folders you’ve generated or how fuzzy your memory of
where you placed that document.
The fact that multiple users can also have access to the same documents
simultaneously makes sharing and collaboration much easier than anyone
ever thought possible before Google Docs. Google Docs also has at least 
five additional advantages:

 Never misplaces a document
 Singledocumindedness for sharing, collaboration, and version control
 Multifolder support for the singledocuminded
 Platform independence
 Singledocumindedness in mail and IM attachments
Singledocumindedness for sharing, 
collaboration, and version control
Okay, we made up the word singledocumindedness, but we couldn’t think of 
a real word that seemed to fit. The point is, you don’t need to keep multiple
versions of any document ever again — not for yourself, not for your collabo-
rators, not for anyone else in the world with whom you want to share your
document. This new single-document approach enhances collaboration 
and sharing.
When it comes to sharing, you need only one copy, regardless of the number
of collaborators, because your Docs Home catalogs and maintains changes
within a single master document. Google Docs allows you to peek back in
time to see what changes have been made at any point during the creation 
of that document — from start to finish.
You can always revert your document to a time before certain changes 
were made or determine who among your contributors made what changes.
With the click of a button, you can compare versions of a document or turn
the clock back to a time before certain changes found their way into your
precious prose. (See Figure 10-2.) Thanks to Google Docs, version control 
has never been so simple. We go into more detail on this powerful reviewing
feature for each individual Google App in Chapters 11 through 13.
Figure 10-2:
Sharing and
version
control are
easy with a
single-
document
approach.
159
Chapter 10: Finding Your Way around the Google Docs Home

Multifolder support for single documents
You can label a single file so that it appears in any number of folders without
generating digital replicas — you don’t save copies of the same document in
multiple folders or on multiple drives. Instead, you can attach any number of
folder names to a file as labels, so the document appears, like magic, in any
folder you assign. See Figure 10-3 — the Practice 1, Practice 2, and Practice 3
documents appear in both the Practice Docs and the Urgent Docs folders.
(It’s a little bit like Dumbledore appearing on Harry and Ron’s Chocolate 
Frog playing cards whenever they want to see him.)
Do you even need to make backups anymore? Yes, of course. But backing 
up isn’t the headache or major concern it used to be. When you save your
Google documents online in Google Data Center, Google says that it creates
backups just about as fast as you make changes to your document. However,
it’s still just a bunch of computers out there, so back up the critical docu-
ments on your hard drive at a minimum; you know, all the legal stuff or 
that report you can’t do without, but don’t lose any sleep over the rest of
your files.
Platform independence
The Docs Home and all its apps don’t care whether you’re a Mac user, a Linux
user, a Windows XP user, a Windows Vista user, or any other kind of user. You
just need a Web browser, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari, running
on any platform.
Regardless of the platform, the concept of singledocumindedness applies. 
A Mac user can edit a document alongside a Windows Vista user in real time
without conflicts, catcalls, or crashes. Oh, that the rest of the computing
world could be so compatible.
Figure 10-3:
Assign a
single file to
any number
of folders
you want.
160
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

One of the big advantages of Google Docs is that they run from any reason-
ably updated (within the last year or so) Web browser. But you may need 
to activate open source scripts on your browser from time to time. Some
well-known browsers balk at the idea of running scripts. To enable scripts,
follow the instructions that appear in the notification area of your browser,
which is usually just below the address bar. You may need to change your
browser’s security settings for scripts to run properly. If you get tired of all
the annoying reminders, you may want to try updating or even switching
browsers. Taking a few minutes to download a free, updated Web browser
may be worth the effort.
Singledocumindedness for 
mail or IM attachments
Using and sharing single copies of documents in Google Docs also applies 
to e-mail and IM attachments. In the past, attaching a document to a message
generated another copy of the document. Under the singledocumindedness
theory, Google sends a Web address that links to a single original document,
as shown in Figure 10-4, allowing others to view and collaborate on the same
version of a shared online document from their personal Docs Homes.
Of course, if you want to rename a file and maintain a separate copy indepen-
dently, Doc guidelines do allow that. (We think the official statement on this
issue reads something like, “Sure, why not.”)
The only downside to Google Docs is that you must be able to get online to
access your documents. If you know ahead of time that you’ll need to work
offline, you can export your document from the Docs Home to your hard
drive in a file format that your desktop software can understand. We show
you how to overcome the online obstacle in Chapters 11 through 13.

161
Chapter 10: Finding Your Way around the Google Docs Home

Launching Your Docs Home
You can launch your Docs Home in two ways:
 Using a Start Page gadget
 Entering a Web address
Adding a Google Docs gadget
You can run Google Docs conveniently from a gadget on your Start Page. 
(See Chapter 3 for directions on adding a gadget to your Start Page.)
After you add your gadget, you can access all three kinds of apps directly
from the Google Docs link, which takes you to Docs Home. (See Figure 10-5.)
You don’t need to add separate gadgets for documents, spreadsheets, and
presentations because your Docs Home launches and manages all three.
You can set up the Google Docs gadget in the same way in your iGoogle inter-
face, even if your organization doesn’t have Google Apps.
Launching Docs from a Web address
You can start your Google Docs directly from the Web by simply clicking 
in the address bar and entering docs followed by your partnered domain
name for Google Apps, as in http://docs.yourdomain.com. For example,
http://docs.ardsleybooks.com. Team Edition users, go to http://
docs.google.com/a/yourdomain.com.
You can go to your personal Google Docs Home by going to http://docs.
google.com.
Like always, you need to sign in so that the system knows it’s really you. You
can typically gain access to your files by using the same e-mail address and
password that you use for your Gmail account.

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Working and Collaborating 
in Google Docs
The Google Docs Home is the hub where you can access all your documents,
spreadsheets, and presentations with ease. You can create new documents;
display, hide, sort, or delete documents; import and export documents; orga-
nize your documents by folders or labels; and so on. The following sections
describe how to do these tasks and more.
Creating and naming new documents
When you first come to your lonely, blank, empty Docs Home, a heartfelt 
little message appears that gives you three tempting options:
 Create a new document from scratch.
 Upload an existing document.
 Learn more!
In this section, we focus on the first one — creating a document from scratch.
To create a new word processing doc, follow these steps:
1. In the Google Docs Home, click the New button and select Document
from the drop-down list that appears, as shown in Figure 10-6.
2. Click in the word processing window and start typing!
Whatever you type in the first line of your document becomes your default
file name. Docs will name the file automatically within a few seconds. The
title appears in the header at the top of the document, as shown in Figure
10-7. (If you don’t enter anything, the document will be named Untitled 
by default.)
Figure 10-6:
Create 
a new
document.
163
Chapter 10: Finding Your Way around the Google Docs Home

The word Saving appears in a red box in the top-right corner of the Document
window as Docs automatically saves the file. If you can’t wait for the auto-
matic saving to kick in, click one of the following buttons in the upper-right
corner of the screen:
 Save: Click the Save button to quickly save your doc.
 Save & Close: Click the Save & Close button to save your doc and return
to your Docs Home.
 Discard Changes: Click the Discard Changes button to quit the document
without saving any changes that you made.
If you decide you don’t like the default file name, you can always change it
later. (We walk you through renaming in Chapter 11.)
Viewing, sorting, hiding, or 
trashing your documents
When you create documents, they show up in the document list, with the
most recent documents appearing at the top. If you want to sort the docu-
ments in another way, click the appropriate option (Name, Folders/Sharing,
Date) on the column heading above the document list (refer to Figure 10-3):
 Name: Click Name to sort the files alphabetically (A–Z). Click Name
again to reverse the order (Z–A).
 Folders /Sharing: After you start creating folders and sharing with 
collaborators, you can sort alphabetically by folder names by clicking
this column heading.
 Date: Click Date to sort from the oldest to the newest document. Click
Date again to sort from the newest to the oldest doc.

Uncovering the Docs Home organization pane
The organization pane on the left side of your Docs Home holds a long list 
of valuable display options. Perhaps the list is too long for your liking. To 
roll up the options, click the minus sign (–) to the left of each major heading:
All Items, All Folders, Items by Type, and Shared With (shown on the left in
Figure10-8). To roll them out again, click the plus sign (+) to the left of each
heading to reveal the options (shown on the right in Figure10-8).
Star struck
One of the most popular ways to sort files is with a star. (Yes, it’s a gold 
star. Go to the head of the class.) To mark a document with a star, click the
Star icon to the left of the document name, as shown in Figure 10-9.
You can star documents for any reason. They may be important, you may
need to give them urgent attention, or you may want to jog your memory that
you need to work on a particular doc. To display starred documents, click the
Starred item in the Docs organization pane, as shown in Figure 10-9.

Hide stuff
The Docs Home allows users to hide documents from view. You may want to
hide a document, for example, when it’s in a very rough state and you’re not
yet ready for others to see and edit it.
To hide a doc, place a check mark to the left of each file name and click the
Hide button. The documents are hidden, as shown in Figure 10-10. Choose
the Hidden item in the Docs organization pane to display all the hidden 
documents again.
Show your stuff
If you look through Chapters 11, 12, and 13, you can find out much more
about collaborating and sharing documents. If you actively share files with
others, and others start sharing with you, document names proliferate
throughout your Docs Home list. If you want to see only your own stuff and
exclude documents created by others, click the aptly named Created by Me
item in the organization pane.
Click All Items in the Docs organization pane if you’ve displayed just your
own documents, starred documents, or hidden documents and now need to
see your complete list.
Empty the trash, or not
If you need to delete a document, select the document’s check box and click
the Delete button. Clicking this button sends the document to the Trash; but
the document isn’t lost forever, it still exists. Click the Trash icon in the Docs
organization pane, select the item’s check box, and delete it permanently by
clicking Empty Trash. (You can also trash multiple documents at a time by
selecting a group of them before clicking the Empty Trash button.)
If you change your mind and want to restore a file, go to the Trash, select the
check box for the document that you want to recover, and click the Undelete
button, shown in Figure 10-11. You really don’t need to delete any items from
the Trash — or, for that matter, to trash any documents in the first place —
because Google gives you plenty of space in which to save your documents.
However, if you find it helps to clear out a few documents now and again, no
one will try to stop you!

Uploading or importing your 
existing documents
You can upload word processing documents, presentations, and spreadsheets
that you’ve already created with many different programs to Google Docs.
Follow these steps to upload a document to the Docs Home:
1. Sign into the Docs Home.
Refer to the section “Launching Your Docs Home,” earlier in this chapter,
for details.
2. Click the Upload button.
The Upload a File screen appears, as shown in Figure 10-12.
You can upload the following file types (see the left side of the Upload 
a File screen):
• Text and word processing documents: .doc, .docx, .rtf, 
.txt, .sxw
• Presentations: .ppt, .pptx
• Spreadsheets: .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .ods

Chapter 10: Finding Your Way around the Google Docs Home

3. Click the Browse button; in the Choose File dialog box that appears,
select the file that you want to upload to Google Docs and click the
Open button.
Alternatively, you can enter the file path to the file (if you know it) in 
the Browse Your Computer to Select a File to Upload text box, or you
can enter a Web address in the Or Enter the URL of a File on the Web
text box.
4. (Optional) Enter a new name for the file in the What Do You Want to
Call It text box.
If you don’t name the file, it retains its current file name.
5. Click the Upload File button.
The file that you upload opens as a Google doc. For example, in Figure
10-13, we uploaded a Word document. You can view and make any
changes to your document in Google Docs.
6. If you make any changes to your file, click the Save & Close button;
otherwise, click the Docs Home link to return to the Docs Home.
The documents show up in your Docs Home, where you can keep them
safe, sound, readable, and ready for editing.
You can also copy and paste from an existing document to a new Google docu-
ment, instead of uploading a file. If you want to remove all the formatting
from an existing document first, copy and paste the text into Notepad or
another text editor, and then copy and past the text from the text editor into
a Google doc.

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Organizing your files by folders or labels
Folders provide a way to organize your files by many categories. In the 
single-document approach, you don’t physically move or copy a file into a
new folder — rather, you attach a folder name or a label to the document
itself. You can attach as many labels to a file as you want.
This approach works like the files on an iPod or other digital media player.
For example, the love song “Michelle,” by the Beatles, has multiple labels,
such as Beatles, 1960s, Love Songs, M, and My Playlist. Looking for any one 
of these different labels, you can quickly find and play the one copy of the
file. (Singledocumindedness in action yet again.)
To create folders and/or labels while assigning documents to those folders,
sign into Google Docs and then follow these steps:
1. Click New and select Folder from the menu that appears.
2. Click in the New Folder text box and type a name for the folder. 
Press Enter.
3. Click All Items, and then select the check box of any documents that
you want to label with your selected folder name.
4. Click Move To, select the folder name from the menu that appears,
and click the Move to Folder button. (Click Cancel if you change 
your mind.)
5. To display only the files assigned to a folder:
• Click the folder name in the organization pane. (You may need 
to expand the All Folders item to see your folders.)
• Click All Items in the organization pane and look under the
Folders/Sharing column heading to see the folder(s) assigned 
to a document.
Searching your documents
Google makes searching your document library ridiculously easy. You can
search for any of your documents by entering either a name or typing 
keywords based on document content. Simply enter a few keywords in the
text box and click the Search Docs button. Google Search tries to help you as
much as it can. For example, in Figure 10-14, just entering the first few letters
of a word in the Search text box found several files containing that word.
Search results appear in a special list, as shown in Figure 10-14. Remember,
this list searches for documents only in your Docs Home.
169
Chapter 10: Finding Your Way around the Google Docs Home

Converting and exporting files 
into other file formats
Google Docs may not give you all the options and settings that a high-end
word processing, desktop publishing, spreadsheet, or presentation program
can. You may need to download and convert a lot of documents, representing
a lot of work on your part, into a file format that such a high-end application
can handle.
You can make these conversions directly from Docs Home. Start by selecting
the document you want to convert, and then clicking the More Actions
button. From the menu that appears, select the file format that you need.
(See Figure 10-15.)
A dialog box appears, asking whether you want to open or save the file. Click
the Save button. In the Save As dialog box that appears, browse to where you
want to save the file and click the Save button.

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Changing your language settings
Some users may need to change the language settings for Google Docs. You
can change the language settings by clicking the Settings link and making the
necessary changes in the Settings window. (See Figure 10-16.) For example,
select a different language from the Language drop-down list. Click the Save
button at the bottom of the screen to save your changes.
To change settings back to their original defaults, click the Settings link again.
If you set the language to something other than English, you need to know
the words for the options in that language. For example, Settings in Spanish is
Configuración.
Using Help and signing out of Google Docs
If you don’t understand something (we can’t describe every obscure detail 
in this book), click the Help link to find out more.
When you’re done for the day, click the Sign Out link and take the rest of 
the day off.
You’re probably wondering, “Do I really need to sign out?” Not really, but it’s
still a good idea. Just closing your browser may close your document before
the automatic backup has kicked in. You may lose some last-second changes
to a document if you don’t click the Save & Close button or sign out first.
Even if you do exit quickly without signing out, though, you shouldn’t lose
much work because Google makes frequent automatic saves for you.

Word Processing with 
Google Docs
In This Chapter
 Using the Google Docs screen
 Editing documents in Google Docs
 Printing, publishing, and converting documents in Google Docs
 Sharing and collaborating with Google Docs
T
his chapter tells you all about Docs, Google’s online word-processing
application. If you’re thinking, “This app looks easy,” you’re absolutely
correct — you can’t find anything easier to use than the Docs part of 
Google Docs.
In this chapter, we show you the easy-to-use editing and formatting features
of Docs. And finally, we show you how to print and publish the documents
that you create in Docs. We save the best for last when we delve into the true
power of Docs — its sharing and collaboration features. When it comes to
real-time collaboration, Google has raised the bar. You can finally team up on
a document in real time with ease.
Getting Familiar with the Docs Screen
When you’re ready to start writing and creating a new word-processing 
document in Docs, you start from the Google Docs Home. (See Chapter 10 
for the skinny on Docs Home.) Log into Google Docs (go to http://docs.
yourdomain.com or http://docs.google.com; Team Edition users 
go to http://docs.google.com/a/yourdomain.com). From the Docs
Home, you can easily create a new word-processing document by clicking 
the New button and then selecting Document from the menu that appears.
The word-processing interface opens to a new, blank document, as shown 
in Figure 11-1.

174
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 
The Docs interface has the following parts:
 The header section: The header section is the upper section of the Docs
interface (refer to Figure 11-1). Think of the header section as a control
center for your document. You go to the header to save, print, edit,
format, share, and publish your documents.
 The File menu: The Google Docs File menu enables you to create, save,
print, rename, copy, delete, and close your document; export the docu-
ment into various formats; get a word count; find and replace words or
phrases in the document; and change settings.
 Name of the document: Documents are named automatically, based 
on whatever you enter in the first line of your text. This automatic
naming feature can leave you with a file name that you don’t want.
Additionally, if you don’t enter any text for a bit of time, you may get
stuck with Untitled as the document’s name. (Refer to Figure 11-1.) 
To rename a document, choose File➪Rename and enter the name of
your choice.
Docs header

Input area
Figure 11-1:

interface.

Depending on your browser settings, the first time you try to rename a
document, your browser may prompt you to allow scripts. Follow the
onscreen instructions and then try renaming the document again. You
should be able to rename the document after allowing scripts.
 Tabs and toolbar: Each tab opens a different toolbar that displays 
different word-processing features and options. The tabs include
• Edit: Write and format your text.
• Insert: Insert tables, pictures, and Internet links.
• Revisions: Go back to a previous version of any document and
track changes.
• Share: Share and collaborate on a document with other collabora-
tors. All that’s needed is an e-mail address for each collaborator.
• Publish: Publish your document online.
 Input area: You can find the input area below the tabs and toolbar. In
this area, you type text, insert pictures, and so on.
 Check Spelling: The Check Spelling link appears at the bottom-right
corner of the Google Docs interface. To check your spelling, simply 
click the Check Spelling link. All possible spelling errors are highlighted.
Ignore any words or acronyms that you know are spelled correctly and
just click any suspect words, such as the word understandible in Figure
11-2. When you click a highlighted word, a list of alternative spellings
appears, and you can select the correct spelling from that list.
If Docs highlights a word as a spelling error that you know is spelled
correctly (names often show up as spelling errors because they’re not in
the Docs spelling dictionary), you can add that word to the dictionary.
Click the highlighted word and, from the list that appears, select Add to
Dictionary. You can also use the option to recheck a document, just in
case you feel you missed something. When you finish spell checking,
click Done. (The Done link replaces the Check Spelling link after the spell
check has been completed.)

Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

Editing a Document in Docs
If you’ve used any word-processing program before, you should find Docs
extremely familiar and easy to use. The following sections take you through
the basics of editing a document using Docs. (See Chapter 10 for details 
on creating a new document or loading an existing document.)
Formatting and editing text in the Edit tab
When you’re working on a document, you type the text in the input area. 
You probably need to apply some formatting to your text at some point, such
as italics, bold, a bulleted list, and so on.
You can apply formatting when you’re creating a document in one of the 
following ways:
 Select the text that you want to format, and then click the appropriate
button on the Edit toolbar.
 Click the appropriate button on the Edit toolbar, and then type the text.
The new text you type has the formatting applied.
You can also press a keyboard shortcut, instead of clicking a button on the
Edit toolbar. See Tables 11-1 and 11-2 for common keyboard shortcuts.
Google certainly hopes that most of the buttons on the Edit tab look very
familiar to you. Table 11-1 describes editing commands and shortcuts. You
can access many of the commands from the Edit toolbar, as well as by using
keyboard shortcuts.
176
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 
Don’t print or save a Doc from the browser menu
When you create a new document or open up
an existing document in Google Docs, all the
customary browser buttons and tools appear
above the Docs interface. Ignore all that.
Especially ignore the browser’s Print button and
File menu (or the Page and Tools menus,
depending on your browser). They won’t do you
any good for word processing. Focus on the
Docs tools (refer to Figure 11-1). Instead of
using the browser’s commands to print or save
a document, use the links and buttons in the
Docs header. Click the Save button on the Edit
toolbar to save your work; to print your work,
click the Print button on the Edit toolbar or the
Print link just above the toolbar.

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Cutting, copying, and pasting
When you need to move text (or an image, table, and so on), just cut or 
copy it, and then paste it where it needs to go. Select the items that you want
to cut or copy (you can select almost anything — text, images, tables, and 
so on), and then click the Cut or Copy button (or press Ctrl+X or Ctrl+C,
respectively).
To paste a cut or copied item, place your cursor where you want the item to
appear and click the Paste button (or press Ctrl+V).
With some operating systems, when you cut, copy, and paste, you need to
allow access to the system Clipboard. (The Clipboard is a holding place that
saves your cut or copied text and graphics in memory until you’re ready to
paste them.) If you see a dialog box like the one shown in Figure 11-3 when
you’re attempting to cut (or copy) and paste, just click the Allow Access
button and paste away.
Changing the font type, size, text color, or highlight color
To change the font, click the Font drop-down list and select a different 
font. (See Figure 11-4.)
To change the font size, click the Size drop-down list and select a different
font size.
A typical Google document starts out with a Verdana 10pt font as its default.
Verdana is an easy-to-read font, and 10pt is large enough for most readers;
but you may not like these defaults. Change fonts and their sizes any time
you want. You can
 Choose your new font and size before you start entering text.
 Select the text that you want to change in your document, and then
apply your font and size choices.
Figure 11-3:

179
Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

To change the color of the text, click the Text Color button. Select a color
from the color palette that appears, as shown in Figure 11-5.
To add or change the highlight color, click the Highlight Color button and
select the color that you want from the palette that appears.
If you plan to print a document in color, or you know it will be viewed 
on-screen, you can use colored text and highlighting to grab attention or to
accent your message. Just be sure that the text color contrasts with the back-
ground color (the color of the paper, highlight, or screen) so that it’s easy 
to read — you can easily read dark blue, deep red, or even burnt orange text
on a light background or when it is printed on white paper. If your text is red,
don’t use the same red for your highlight color. (How well can you decipher
invisible secret codes?)
Adding a link
Because the documents you create with Google Docs are online, you can
easily link documents together or add a link to a Web page.
To create a hyperlink in a document, follow these steps:
1. Select the text that you want to turn into a link and click the Insert tab
followed by the Link button.
The Change Link window appears, as shown in Figure 11-6.

2. Select a radio button to choose what you want to link to; when you
select a radio button, the text box below the radio buttons changes 
so that you can type or select the appropriate item.
• URL: Link to a Web page. Enter the URL in the text box that
appears.
In the example in Figure 11-6, the Web address (URL) www.
ardsleybooks.com has been entered. (Google Docs 
automatically adds the http:// for you.)
• Document: Link to another document that you created in Docs.
Select the document from the drop-down list that appears.
• Bookmark: Link to a bookmark that you made inside your docu-
ment. (See the section “Sticking a bookmark in your document,”
later in this chapter, for the steps to create a bookmark.) Select 
a bookmark from the drop-down list that appears.
• E-mail Address: Link to an e-mail address. Type an e-mail address 
in the text box that appears.
3. (Optional) Enter or change the text that’s hyperlinked in the Text 
text box.
4. (Optional) In the Flyover text box, enter any text that you want to pop
up when someone hovers the mouse cursor over the link.
5. (Optional) Select the Open Link in New Window check box if you want
a new Web browser window to open when the user clicks the link.
If you don’t select this check box, when a user clicks the link, the linked
page replaces your existing document. Many users choose to pop open a
separate window so that they can quickly flip back and forth between
the original document and the linked page.

Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

Applying styles
Styles allow you to apply consistent and professional-looking formats. To
apply a style, select a style from the Style drop-down list. You can apply the
following styles:
 Normal Paragraph: Use this style for regular, run-of-the-mill paragraphs.
You can also apply the Normal Paragraph style to remove formatting if,
for example, you make a mistake or change your mind about how you
want your text to look.
 Header 1 (Huge): Use this style for a title or section heading.
 Header 2 (Big): Apply this style to side headings and subheadings.
 Header 3 (Standard): Apply this style to side headings and subheadings.
 Justify Text: Use this style to align text equally to the left and right 
margins.
 Strikeout: Apply this style to put a line through (or strike out) words.
 Superscript: Apply this style to raise text above the line. This style is
often used for footnote references and for exponents in mathematics,
such as 23 = 8.
 Subscript: Use this style to lower the text below the line. This style is
used for chemical notations, such as H2O.
Using more keyboard shortcuts
Earlier in this chapter, Table 11-1 shows keyboard shortcuts for the common
editing and formatting commands found on the Edit toolbar. But those key-
board shortcuts aren’t the only ones you may want to use when you’re edit-
ing a document. If you’re hooked on keyboard shortcuts, Google Docs doesn’t
disappoint. Table 11-2 lists additional keyboard shortcuts that you can use
when creating and editing a document in Google Docs.

Inserting objects by using the Insert tab
When you click the Insert tab, all the fun stuff that allows you to insert
images, links, comments, tables, bookmarks, separators, and special charac-
ters appears. We hit most of these useful objects in the following sections.
Inserting an image
Adding images couldn’t be easier. Just remember that you must upload
images before you can insert and view them as explained in these steps.
1. Position your cursor where you want an image to appear in the docu-
ment.
2. Click the Insert tab, and then click the Image button.
The Insert Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-7.
3. Select either the From This Computer radio button or the From the
Web (URL) radio button.
4. Depending on which radio button you select in Step 3, the steps
change a bit:
a. If you select the From This Computer radio button, click the Browse
button. In the File Upload dialog box that appears, browse to your
file, select it, and click the Open button which will place the path
to the file in the browse box. Back in the Insert Image dialog box,
click the Insert Image button.
183
Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

b. If you select the From the Web (URL) radio button, type or paste the
URL into the Enter Image Web Address text box. A preview of the
image appears in the dialog box. Click the Insert Image button.
Giving shady comments
Comments are a valuable tool for tracking edits or discussing issues in 
a document, especially when you’re working in a team to craft document 
content. To add a comment, follow these steps:
1. Place your cursor where you want a comment to appear, and then
click the Comment link in the Insert tab.
A box with your name, the date, and the time appears.
2. Start typing in the comment box.
3. When you’re done typing the comment, simply click elsewhere in the
document.
Your comment appears as shaded text, as shown in Figure 11-8. All 
comments are marked with the name of the contributor/author, along
with the date and time that he or she inserted the comment into the 
document.
4. To edit your comment or change the color, click your comment.
A menu appears, giving you the options Close This Menu, Delete
Comment, or Insert Comment Text into Document. You can select a
color to change the color box around your comment — you can choose
from Yellow, Orange, Pink, Green, Blue, and Purple.
To edit your comment, simply ignore the menu and start typing.

Building a table
Tables are extremely valuable organizing tools for word-processing docu-
ments. Due to the popularity of tables, Google had to make sure that this 
feature works properly online — and it works pretty well.
Follow these steps to create a table:
1. Click the Table button on the Insert tab.
The Insert Table dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-9.
2. Enter how many cells you want in your table in the Rows and
Columns text boxes.
Tables are calculated into columns and rows. In Figure 11-9, a 3 x 6 table
(with three rows and six columns, for a total of 18 cells) is being created.
3. Select the options that you want from the Width and Height 
drop-down lists.
Width refers to the size of cells horizontally. Height refers to the size 
of cells vertically. You can choose from four possible options for each
variable, which appear in their respective drop-down lists:
• Full Width/Full Height: Use all the width and height available
between the margins of a page.
• Size to Content: Adjust the width and height of a table’s cells to the
size of the words or graphics within each cell.
Figure 11-9:

185
Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

• Pixels: Define the width and height of the cell to a specific number
of pixels.
• Percent: Adjust cell width and height based on a percentage of the
available space found between margins.
4. (Optional) If you want to create a table with columns that are all the
same width, select the Columns of Equal Width check box.
5. Adjust the padding and the spacing around the text inside cells by
entering the number of pixels in the Padding and Spacing text boxes.
Increasing the spacing adds space between cells. Increasing the padding
puts extra space around words inside the cells.
6. From the Align drop-down list, select a cell alignment (Left, Center,
Right, or leave it at None); if you add a value into the Spacing text
box, you can select Left, Right, or None from the Float drop-down list,
which creates spacing around your text.
7. To add a border, enter a number in the Size text box — the larger the
number, the wider the border. To change the color of the border, click
the Color box and select a color from the palette that appears.
8. To change the background color in the cells, click the Color box
below Background and select a color from the palette that appears.
9. After you make your selections, click the Insert Table button.
Your table appears in your document.
After you create your table, you can still make changes using the Edit tab. For
example, in Figure 11-10, columns 2 through 6 are centered. Color has been
added in row 2, and graphics were inserted into row 3. Titles are bold, and
the font has been changed from the default Verdana font.
You can really appreciate the power of tables only if you take the time to
experiment with all the options available, so play around with each of the
options that we explain in this section.

Sticking a bookmark in your document
Bookmarks allow you to create links from one part of a document to 
another. You may find bookmarks especially useful in long documents, so 
you can avoid paging down endlessly until you find the passage that you’re
looking for.
To create a bookmark, follow these steps:
1. Click the location where you want the bookmark to go.
This is the destination point, the spot where someone will land after he
or she clicks your bookmark.
2. Click the Insert tab, and then click the Bookmark button.
The Insert Bookmark dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-11.
3. Click in the New Bookmark text box and type a name for your 
bookmark, and then click the Insert Bookmark button.
You’re only half done. The second half of the process requires you to
create a link to your bookmark that readers can click to go to the book-
mark. For example, you can create a table of contents at the top of a 
document that links to bookmarks for each chapter or section within 
the document. We describe how to create a link in the section “Adding 
a link,” earlier in this chapter.
Dividing paragraphs with a separator
Separators place lines that separate paragraphs of text. In Figure 11-12, 
a horizontal line has been inserted below a title.
Figure 11-11:
Create your
bookmark in
the Insert
Bookmark
dialog box.
187
Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

To insert a separator, click where you want the separator to appear. Then
click Separator on the Insert tab and choose Horizontal Line from the menu
that appears. (See Figure 11-12.)
You use the other option in the Separator menu, Page Break, to break text
onto separate pages for printing. Use this option to control the amount of
text on a single page, pushing the remaining text to the following page.
Entering special characters
Now and again, you may need a character that doesn’t appear on your key-
board. These characters can include anything from a copyright symbol (©),
to a registered trademark (®), to an umlaut over an Albanian schwa (ë).
To insert a special character, click where you want to insert the character.
Then, click the Special Character button on the Insert tab. The Insert Special
Character dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-13, giving you hundreds
of choices. If you don’t see the character that you need, select the Asian
Characters, Wingdings, or Advanced option.
The Advanced option enables you to pick a Unicode value for nearly any
character in the world in every major language. If you need help with
Unicode values, click the Help question mark in the Advanced dialog box,
search for your language (even Bengali and Syriac), and find the numerical
code for any special character that you may need.

Viewing or reverting to earlier document
versions in the Revisions tab
The revision system in Docs is so efficient that it eliminates the need to keep
various versions of the same document. In Chapter 10, we refer to this as sin-
gledocumindedness — the idea that you only need one copy of a document
as long as changes are tracked. Because of this feature, you don’t need to
save and keep track of multiple versions of any document ever again — not
for yourself, not for your collaborators, not for anyone with whom you need
to share a document.
On the Revisions tab, Google Docs catalogs and maintains changes within a
single master document, as shown in Figure 11-14. You can peek back to 
see what changes users have made at any point during the creation of that
document — from start to finish. You can also choose to go back in time 
and pick any previous version that you may need. To view any version of the
document, just click a Revision # link in the far-right column.
You can view a version before certain changes were made to determine who
among your contributors made changes. You can also compare the changes
made between different versions. To compare versions, select the check
boxes to the left of the versions that you want to compare and click the
Compare Checked button.
If you decide to revert back to an earlier version of a document, click the
Revision # link in the far-right column to view that version. Then, click 
the Revert to This One button on the toolbar. A dialog box appears, asking
Figure 11-14:

more easily

control

versions
with a
single-
document
approach.
189
Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

whether you’re sure that you want to revert to that version. If you click 
OK, your document reverts to that version, and you lose any changes made
after that point.
Printing, Publishing, and Converting 
to Other Formats
In the following sections, we explore printing, publishing, and converting doc-
uments into other file formats so that you can use them with other software
applications that you may have on your computer.
Previewing and printing
Printing a document in Google Docs is much like printing any other docu-
ment from your computer. You have two ways to get to the Print Settings
dialog box:
 Click the File button and select Print from the menu.
 Click the Print button on the Edit toolbar.
 Click the Print link in the header.
If you want to preview before you print, click the Preview link (it’s to the left
of the Print link). The window changes to show you a general idea of what 
the document will look like when you print it, as shown in Figure 11-15.
Figure 11-15:

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Publishing
The publishing feature allows you to post an online HTML version of your
document or upload a copy to your company or personal blog. Click the
Publish tab to explore the options (see Figure 11-16). When you are ready to
publish, click the Publish button.
Creating a link to a published document
Your document is actually already published online. The Web address
appears as soon as you hit the Publish button. You can select and copy the
link, and then share it with anyone you want.
Google automatically e-mails the Web link to anyone that you list as a viewer
on the Share tab. Copy and paste the link and IM or e-mail it to anyone you
want. If you want others to be able to view the document, you can use the
URL on the Publish tab to add a link in a Web page (your company’s Web
page or a personal Web page, for example) to the document. But, if you don’t
want to allow complete access to anyone, you can restrict access to just
those users within your Google Apps domain area. And you can limit their
access further by selecting the Viewers Must Sign In check box.
Posting a document to a blog
To publish a document to a specific blog location, follow these steps:
1. On the Publish tab, click the Post to Blog button.
The Blog Site Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-17.
Figure 11-16:
Publish your
document
for online
viewing.
191
Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

2. Select the Hosted Provider radio button if your blog is on a major
blogging service, and then select the name of the service from the
Provider drop-down list. If you host your own blog, select the My 
Own Server/Custom radio button.
If you select the My Own Server/Custom radio button, you can enter all
the data necessary to upload directly to your personal, corporate, or
organization Web site or the blog associated with it. Be sure to complete
each field in the detailed sign-in options, as shown in Figure 11-18. If you
don’t know the information, ask your system administrator for advice.
3. Enter your username and password in the User Name and Password
text boxes to sync with the site.
4. (Optional) Enter the name of your blog in the Blog ID/Title text box.
Figure 11-18:
Enter your
custom Web
server 
or blog
address.
Figure 11-17:

192
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

5. Click OK when you’re ready to post the document to your blog.
You can publish to a Web site or blog directly by clicking the Set Your Blog
Site Settings link at the bottom of the Publish tab. After you enter the 
settings, as described in the preceding steps, you can simply click the Post 
to Blog button to post a document to your blog.
This feature works extremely well with Blogger, Google’s free blogging soft-
ware (check out www.blogger.com). You can also publish directly to a Start
Page gadget, which you may find extremely valuable for team or company
announcements. Of course, you need to know the various passwords and
login names for whatever online site to which you’re publishing.
Editing a document’s underlying HTML
If you’re HTML-wise and an online publishing perfectionist, you can go 
right to the HTML code underlying your document before you publish and
make any changes you want directly into the tags themselves, as shown in
Figure 11-19. You can get to the code by clicking the Edit HTML link.
Most of us should forget we ever saw Figure 11-19 — so full of HTML tags —
and go back to the relative safety of the normal Edit tab. By using that 
tab, you can live a life of HTML ignorance and word-processing simplicity 
and bliss.

If you’re a
tech wizard,

option.
193
Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

Exporting and converting documents 
into a variety of formats
The Google Docs File menu allows you to export documents into other file
formats, such as Word, PDF, zipped HTML, RTF, OpenOffice, simple text, or a
presentation. To convert your file from the Docs standard, select the format
that you want from the File menu. Depending on which option you choose,
the dialog box that appears provides you with different options. Pick a 
folder on your hard drive in which to dump the converted file and click the
Save button.
Sharing and Collaboration
This is a classic case of saving the very best feature for last.
The most amazing feature of Google Docs is the ability for people from 
anywhere in the world to work simultaneously on a document with very 
little fuss and bother. The only things users need to collaborate are an e-mail
address, an Internet connection, and the knowledge that everyone can be
writing at the same time on the same document without losing any changes
or messing each other up.
Collaborating on a document
If you haven’t tried collaborating, you’re in for a treat. Two or more people
can be working from different computers in the same room or halfway 
around the world with equal ease. Multiple collaborators can enter data 
into the same document at the same time, or at different times of the day —
when doesn’t matter because Google Docs tracks all changes to maintain
quality control.
Google Docs keeps track of the changes and shares an updated document
every few seconds with everyone on the collaborating team — a good 
example of singledocumindedness in action. Your team is not working on 
separate documents that you reconcile later, but on the exact same 
document at exactly the same time. (See Figure 11-20.)
Don’t worry if someone messes things up by adding something silly or delet-
ing your perfect prose. You can always revert back to a previous version that
Google saved several minutes, hours, days, or even months ago. (See the 
section “Viewing or reverting to earlier document versions in the Revisions
tab,” earlier in this chapter, for how to revert to a previous version.)
194
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

When you open a document window, who’s actively collaborating on that
document at any one time appears at the bottom of the screen. And, even if
two or more collaborators are typing in the same paragraph at the same time,
their changes appear and are refreshed every few seconds. Also, Google
tracks changes that others make not just by name, but also by color, so you
can quickly see who’s been adding text, what he or she added, and where he
or she added it.
Setting up for sharing and 
inviting collaborators
By getting the sharing and collaboration feature to work efficiently, Google
Docs made collaboration much more hassle free.
To start sharing, follow these steps:
1. Click the Share tab in the upper-right corner of the Docs screen, as
shown in Figure 11-21.
2. Select the As Collaborators radio button to allow the people that you
invite to make changes to the document. Select the As Viewers radio
button to restrict the people you invite so that they can read the 
Doc itself but can’t make changes.

195
Chapter 11: Word Processing with Google Docs

3. Enter the e-mail addresses of the people with whom you want to share
the document in the text box in the Invite People section.
This feature makes use of your Contacts list, so you can as easily invite
collaborators as you can enter e-mail addresses into Gmail.
4. (Optional) Select any or all of the check boxes in the Advanced
Permissions section.
If you’re feeling secretive, you may want to use some of the Advanced
Permissions features. Give or deny your collaborators the right to invite
other collaborators or viewers by selecting (to grant) or deselecting 
(to deny) the Collaborators May Invite Others check box. You can 
also allow or disallow collaborators the right to broadcast the page to
mailing lists by selecting (to allow) or deselecting (to disallow) the
Invitations May Be Used by Anyone check box. Normally, users select
these first two default options; however, if you want to keep everything
private, simply remove the check marks from these two options.
Finally, you can choose to allow only users from within a company 
or organization to view the document by requiring them to log in.
Technically, this is a publishing feature, but you can conveniently 
control the setting from the Share tab and from the Publish tab.
5. Click the Invite Collaborators button.
An invitation screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-22. Treat this 
screen exactly like an e-mail message. Your collaborators and viewers
automatically appear in the To box.
Figure 11-21:
Click the
Share tab

196
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

6. Click in the Subject text box and type a subject, and click in the
Message text box and type a message to your collaborators.
7. (Optional) Paste a copy of the document into the e-mail message 
by selecting the Paste the Document Itself into the Email Message
check box.
You don’t have to include the document with the message, but some
viewers may find the easy access to the document convenient. However,
if you have a long document, you probably shouldn’t paste it into the
message because it will be harder to read in a Gmail window. Just let the
users click the link in the message, which takes them to the document.
8. Click the Send button to send the invitation.
If you click the Share tab after you share a document, a list of your collabora-
tors and viewers appears in the right pane of the Share tab, as shown in
Figure 11-23. If you need to send additional e-mail messages or updates 
of your document to a team, click the Email Collaborators link and a new 
e-mail form appears. Fill it out and send it. If you need to add or delete 
collaborators, click the check box next to their name.
The documents that you share appear in the Docs Home page for all your 
collaborators to open, view, and edit. They can then organize the documents
in any way that suits them — by assigning labels or folders — just like they
can for documents of their own creation. They can work with the document
as if they had actually started it themselves, and they can access the list of all
those collaborating on the document. (See Chapter 10 for more information
on how to manage documents.)

In This Chapter
 Starting Spreadsheets and covering the basics
 Creating charts, graphs, and diagrams
 Applying formulas and functions
 Sharing and collaborating with spreadsheets
 Converting spreadsheets to other formats
 Publishing and printing spreadsheets
S
preadsheets perform calculations and organize data. Sounds boring, but
the more you know about them, the more valuable they become. And
regardless of whether your needs are lightweight or heavy duty, Google
Spreadsheets can help you make an impression and get the job done. For
instance, Google Spreadsheets can help you if you need to
 Add a bundle of numbers or create a family budget
 “Number crunch” mountains of data with colleagues
 Create a few clever charts and graphs for an upcoming business proposal
 Create a spreadsheet with fiendishly complex formulas
 Make a spreadsheet available online to impress a client with your digital
acumen
Google Spreadsheets is easy to use yet has heady capabilities. Most home or
even business users don’t need all the capabilities that are built into Google
Spreadsheets. In this chapter, we start simple and give you what you need to
use Google Spreadsheets. We cover entering, editing, and formatting basics,
and then we go on to talk about creating charts and graphs, and using formulas
and functions to crunch numbers. We show you how to share and collaborate
on spreadsheets. And finally, we describe how to preview, print, and publish
your spreadsheets.

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 
Starting Up a Spreadsheet
If you read Chapter 11, you’re way ahead on the learning curve when it comes
to using Google Spreadsheets. When you’re ready to create a new spread-
sheet, log into Google Docs Home (go to http://docs.yourdomain.com or
http://docs.google.com). (See Chapter 10 for details about Docs Home.)
You can easily create a new spreadsheet by clicking New from Docs Home and
then selecting Spreadsheet from the menu that appears. Google Spreadsheets
opens to a new, blank spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 12-1.
Header
Edit toolbar
Figure 12-1:
A new,
unsaved
spreadsheet.
Cells, rows, and columns
Like all spreadsheets, Google’s online version is
a grid. Each rectangle in the grid is called a cell.
The cells are organized horizontally in rows and
vertically in columns:
 Rows: Numbered 1, 2, 3, and so on.
 Columns: Lettered A, B, C, and so on. When
the spreadsheet runs out of letters in the
alphabet, it doubles up the letters and starts
using AA, AB, AC, and so on; then BA, BB,
BC, and so on.
 Cells: Identified by the intersection of a row
and column. This is called the cell address.
For instance, cell D8 is located at the inter-
section of column D and row 8.
Google Spreadsheets provides a huge number
of cells, rows, and columns — so many that
you’re unlikely to need them all.

Start autosaving immediately
In contrast to other Google Apps, Google Spreadsheets wants to start
autosaving immediately so that you don’t lose any important data. A pop-up
message appears in the lower-right corner of the screen just a few moments
after you create a new spreadsheet. Click the Start Autosaving link (refer to
Figure 12-1); a dialog box appears in which you can name your spreadsheet,
as shown in Figure 12-2. If you decide later that you need to rename a file, you
can do that from the Docs File menu.
Note: The sample spreadsheet that you see in the figures in this chapter orga-
nizes statistics about five former British Colonies and the order in which they
received independence. Incidentally, we want to visit all these places — no
offense to the Falkland Islands or the 50 other members of the Commonwealth.
Getting familiar with the Google
Spreadsheets header and Edit tab
The header for Google’s spreadsheet and its Edit tab are nearly identical to the
Docs word-processing interface explained in Chapter 11. (Refer to Figure 12-1.)
Atop the spreadsheet, the familiar Docs Home, Help, and Sign Out links appear,
as well as the Save and Save & Close buttons. Like with Docs, your login name,
the file’s name, and the date that the spreadsheet was last updated appear in
the header. You can also find the familiar Print and Print Preview links in the
header as well.
The big differences between the spreadsheet and word-processing interfaces
appear in the tabs. Google Spreadsheets includes the Discuss and Formulas
tabs, which don’t appear in Docs. Even on the Edit tab, several buttons on
the Edit toolbar differ from Docs. Note: The buttons for Bold, Italic, changing
font size and color, and so on work similarly to those found on the Edit tool-
bar in Docs, so we won’t bore you and repeat that information here — see
Chapter 11 for details.
Figure 12-2:
Name your
spreadsheet
immediately.
201
Chapter 12: Crunching Numbers with Google Spreadsheets

In the following list, we describe the buttons on the Edit toolbar that are specific
to Google Spreadsheets (we also show you a few clever tricks in the process):
 Format button: Formats numbers by adding commas, currency symbols,
and other possible number formats.
 Align button: Aligns values to the left, right, or center of the cell,
column, or row.
 Insert button: Adds new rows or columns anywhere you need them in
an existing spreadsheet.
 Delete command: Deletes columns, rows, or specific cells, along with
the text and numerical values contained in those areas.
 Wrap Text check box: Wraps text within a cell when checked; keeps text
on one line when unchecked.
 Charting feature: Creates charts and graphs.
 Merge Across: Merges cells together to accommodate larger titles or to
improve the appearance of a spreadsheet.
Ignore all your Web browser buttons and menus, such as its File, Save, and
Print options, when you want to save or print your spreadsheet. Save, export,
and print your spreadsheet by using the buttons or links in the header sec-
tion of Google Spreadsheets.
Entering, Editing, and Other 
Spreadsheet Basics
After you create a new spreadsheet and name it, you’re ready to start enter-
ing data and making it look good. The following sections go over these basic
spreadsheet chores.
Entering values
Any data entered into a cell is called a value. The most common values are
 Numbers or numerical values: Used for calculations. Numerical values
include both numbers and a few symbols, such as +, –, the comma as a
separator, and the percent sign (%).
 Text values: Letters or words.
 Labels: Text values that act like a heading to identify columns or rows of
values.
202
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

You can only enter values into an active cell. Make a cell active by clicking it
or by using the keyboard, as described in Table 12-1. Active cells are high-
lighted. In Figure 12-3, cell A2 is active. After you make a cell active, you can
enter values directly into that slightly expanded cell.
After you enter a value into the cell, you must activate another cell for the
values to update in the spreadsheet. (You need to take this step in all spread-
sheets.) For example, in Figure 12-3, we added six text labels and made cell A2
active. You can update values in a cell in several ways. Start by clicking in a cell
and typing in the values, and then
 Press Enter, Tab, or any of the arrow keys.
 Click a different cell.

sheet, allowing you to move from cell to cell.

Selecting multiple cells
You can select a single cell by clicking it or moving to it using the navigation
keys described in Table 12-1. To select a range of cells, either
 Use the mouse: Click a cell and drag to highlight all the cells you want to
select.
 Use the keyboard: Navigate to a cell, then hold down Shift as you use
the arrow keys to highlight the cells you want to select.
You can select an entire row by clicking the row header, or select an entire
column by clicking the column header. Alternatively, press Ctrl+Shift+right
arrow to select a row or Ctrl+Shift+down arrow to select a column.
Formatting multiple cells
You can put information in a spreadsheet as simply as clicking a cell and typing.
Generally, text values are short — most often, just a few words in any given
cell. Spreadsheets aren’t the place for longwinded ramblings — save that for
Google Docs or Blogger.
204
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

In Figure 12-4, we started a spreadsheet that compares a few former British
Colonies in the order of their independence. To start the worksheet, we
entered the words Number, Year (for the year of independence), Nation,
Population, Area (for land area), and Density (for population density) into the
first six columns in the first row.
You can format the six text values at the same time by selecting the six cells
(or selecting the entire row by clicking the 1 at the beginning of the row).
Then, start clicking the formatting buttons: Bold, Italic, Font style, and so on.
In Figure 12-4, we selected cells A1 to F1 as a group. We made the labels bold
and shaded, applied a different color, and increased the labels to an 18-point
font size.
See Chapter 11 if you need some additional info on the Edit toolbar’s basic
formatting features. Also, the keyboard shortcuts for formatting that we give
in Chapter 11 for Google Docs also work in Google Spreadsheets.
Changing the column width or row height
In Figure 12-4, the label Number is too long for the width of the column. The
word is simply too big, so you can’t see all of it. You can resolve this issue
quickly — just adjust the width of the column. Hover your mouse pointer
directly over the line between the column headers. A thick blue line with a
double-sided arrow pointer appears over it — this line is called the Column
Width slider. Click and drag the line to the left or right to resize the entire
column, as needed. (Look at Figure 12-5 to see how the resized column A looks.)
The same technique works for resizing rows, too — hover the mouse pointer
over the line between row headers, and then click and drag up or down to
resize the height of a row.

Entering sequences quickly 
with the Fill Handle
One of the important features in any spreadsheet is its ability to anticipate
any patterns that you’re creating and to increment the values automatically.
For example, in Figure 12-5, we need to create a list of numbers from 1 to 5.
When we enter 1 in Cell A2 and 2 in Cell A3, Spreadsheets recognizes a pattern
and can fill in the rest of the numbers in the sequence.
To use the Fill Handle to quickly complete a sequence, follow these steps:
1. Enter the first few values in the sequence in their own cells.
For example, enter 5 in one cell and 10 in another cell if you want to
make Spreadsheets count by fives. (Note: The cells must be touching —
either in the same row or the same column, such as cells B1 and B2, or
cells A6 and B6.)
2. Select the cells as described in the “Selecting multiple cells” section.
In the bottom-right corner of the selected cells (cell A3 in Figure 12-5), a
little dark square appears. This square is the Fill Handle.
3. Click the Fill Handle and drag it down (to fill in a sequence within a
column) or right (to fill in a sequence within a row).
Google Spreadsheets fills in the pattern to all selected cells. For example,
in Figure 12-5, it fills each selected cell with the numbers 1 through 5.
The same technique works for almost any sequence or pattern, such as
 Days of the week
 Months of the year
 Multiple years

Changing values and undoing mistakes
To change or edit an existing value in any cell, double-click the offending cell
to make it active. Delete the error and make the desired change. Press Enter
or move to a different cell to make Spreadsheets accept the new value.
If you make a mistake (and we all make mistakes), click the Undo button on
the Edit toolbar or press Ctrl+Z. If you make a mistake with your undo, click the
Redo button or press Ctrl+Y to undo the undo you just undid (phew!).
Inserting new rows or columns
You need to plan out spreadsheets in advance; but you can’t anticipate
everything. Fortunately, you can insert rows and columns anywhere you need
them. In the sample spreadsheet that we created, for example, we didn’t plan
a row for a title.
To add a row or column, follow these steps:
1. To add a row, highlight the entire row by clicking the number at the
beginning of the row; to add a column, highlight the entire column by
clicking the letter at the top of the column.
2. Click the Insert button on the Edit toolbar and select the appropriate
command from the menu.
• If you select a row in Step 1, select either Row Above or Row Below
from the menu.
• If you select a column in Step 1, select either Column Left or
Column Right from the menu.
Merging and aligning cells
When you enter text that’s too long to appear in its entirety in a cell, you can
adjust the column width. But, sometimes, you don’t want a column to be that
wide — for example, if you have a long title for a spreadsheet. In that case, use
the Merge Across button to merge two or more cells together. (See Figure 12-6.)
207
Chapter 12: Crunching Numbers with Google Spreadsheets

To merge cells, follow these steps:
1. Click in a cell and enter text.
2. Select the cells that you want to merge together.
3. Click the Merge Across button on the Edit tab.
Google Spreadsheets merges the cells together, and any text that you
enter in the cell in Step 1 now spreads across the newly merged cell.
If you want to break a merged cell back into separate cells, select the merged
cell and click the Break Apart button on the Edit toolbar.
You probably want to center align the text in a merged cell. To align text (or
numbers), select the cell(s), row(s), or column(s) that you want to align, and
then click the Align button on the Edit toolbar. Click the alignment that you
want from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 12-6.
For example, in Figure 12-6, we centered the numbers in column A, aligned
Column B’s text values to the right, and aligned the values in column C to the left.
Deleting rows and columns
You delete rows and columns much like you insert rows and columns — if you
have an extra column or row that you don’t want, simply select the entire row or
column by clicking its number or letter, respectively, and then click the Delete
button. From the menu that appears, select Delete Row or Delete Column.

entire rows
or columns,

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Formatting numbers
Number values can take a lot of different forms. You can change these forms,
called number formats, by using the Format button. For example, Google Spread
sheets can represent numbers as digits, in percents, in currency values, with
decimals, and with or without commas. Even dates and times have their own
unique formats. You can use the 24-hour clock or the 12-hour clock, or you
can use the American month/day/year date format or the day/month/year
date format used in most other countries. In our sample spreadsheet (of British
Colonies), we need to change the number format in column F to round the
decimal place so that the decimals don’t run on forever. We also need to add
comma separators to columns D and E so that users can more easily read the
numbers. (Refer to Figure 12-6.)
To apply a number format, follow these steps:
1. Select the columns, rows, or any cells that you want to change.
2. Click the Format button and select the number format that you need
from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 12-7.
Freezing rows and columns
Sometimes, you may need to freeze certain cells at the top and left of 
the spreadsheet. Freezing locks cells in position so that when you scroll the
spreadsheet, those rows remain at the top of the screen and those columns
remain at the left, no matter how long or wide the spreadsheet gets. For exam-
ple, if we expanded our sample spreadsheet to include 50 new rows for the cur-
rent members of the British Commonwealth, we would need to freeze the top
two rows. By freezing the labels in the topmost rows, you can scroll down to
row 20, row 50, or row 5,000 and still read the labels at the top of each column.
Figure 12-7:
Select
multiple
columns
and apply

formats.
209
Chapter 12: Crunching Numbers with Google Spreadsheets

You can freeze rows and columns in two ways:
 Click the Sort tab and click the Freeze Header Rows or Freeze Columns
button. From the menu that appears, select how many rows or columns
you want to freeze. In Figure 12-8, we selected Freeze 2 Rows from the menu.
 Click and drag the Freeze/Sort bar (seen above or below Row 1) down a
couple of rows or left a few columns, as indicated in Figure 12-8.
To unfreeze rows or columns, click the Sort tab, click the Frozen Rows or
Frozen Columns button, and select No Frozen Headers or No Frozen Columns,
respectively, from the menu that appears. You can also drag the Freeze/Sort
bar to the top or left of the spreadsheet.
Sorting from A to Z and Z to A
Sorting text and numbers is one of the essential power-user features of
Google Spreadsheets. You can sort in two ways:
 A→Z: Sort alphabetically from A to Z or numerically from one to infinity.
 Z→A: Sort alphabetically from Z to A or numerically from infinity to one.
Google Spreadsheets gives you two sorting options. You can sort by any
column that you want by using either the Freeze/Sort bar or the Sort tab. For
example, to sort data, you can
Select from the menu…
…or click here and drag to freeze rows.
Figure 12-8:
Freeze the
labels at the
top of the
spreadsheet.
210
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

 Click the Freeze/Sort bar at the column you want to sort, and select A→Z.
 Highlight the column that you want to sort by, click the Sort tab, and
click the A→Z button.
Either way you choose to do it, Spreadsheets sorts all the data in the adjacent
rows to reflect your sort. (In Figure 12-9, the country with the lowest population
density would move to the top of the list.)
If you want to reverse the sort order (for example, place the country with the
greatest population density at the top), repeat the sort process, but this time,
click Z→A.
Using Charts, Graphs, and Diagrams
Many people are graphically impaired. Fortunately, you can easily create
charts and graphs with Google Spreadsheets. To create a chart, simply select
labels and the related numbers (called a range), and then click the Add Chart
button on the Edit tab.
Google Spreadsheets lets you display information by using many different
charting and graphing styles, including
 Column charts
 Bar charts
 Line graphs
 Pie charts
 Scatter diagrams

data from
the
Freeze/Sort
bar or from

211
Chapter 12: Crunching Numbers with Google Spreadsheets

Defining a range of data for your chart
Before you create a chart or graph, you must define your data range. When
you’re creating a chart, you need to select labels (either at the top of columns
or the beginning of rows) and then choose data that corresponds with your labels.
For example, in Figure 12-10, we chose three former British Colonies, their popu-
lations, and their land areas by selecting a range of cells from C5 to E7.
You define a range by clicking a beginning cell in the upper-left corner of the
data set and extending down to the lower-right cell in the data set.
Spreadsheets typically separate a range with a colon (:). For example, C5:E7
means “look at cells C5, E7, and everything in between.”
Creating a chart
After you decide what range you want, follow these steps to create a chart:
1. Select the range by clicking and dragging over the desired cells.
2. Click the Add Chart button on the Edit tab. (It looks like a pie chart.)
The Create Chart dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-11.
3. Select the charting options according to how you want your chart to look.
You can select different options in the following areas:
• What Type: Click one of the icons in the What Type section —
Columns, Bars, Lines, Pie, or Scatter. You can then refine your
choice by clicking one of the Sub Type icons, which include varia-
tions on that chart type.
You need to decide which type of chart can represent your data in
the best possible way. For instance, you could compare the popula-
tion of the United States with that of Australia and Kenya (see the
data range in Figure 12-10) in a visually appealing pie chart. However,
the selection of cells in Figure 12-10 includes Population and Area,
so a pie chart may not represent the data properly; you might find
a column or bar chart to be a better choice.
Figure 12-10:
Select your
data range.
212
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

• What Data: The cell range that you select in Step 1 appears in the
What Data text box. You can also choose how to group the data by
selecting the Rows or Columns radio button. Select one of the
check boxes (Use Row X as Labels or Use Column X as Labels) to
tell Google Spreadsheets where to find the labels for the chart.
• Labels: Click in the Chart Title, Horizontal Axis, and Vertical Axis
text boxes, and enter labels for those parts of the chart. Select
where you want the legend to appear on your chart from the
Legend drop-down list — you can choose No Legend, On Right, On
Left, On Top, or On Bottom.
If you set your spreadsheet up by adding either column or row
labels to a range of numerical data, the labels automatically appear
as a legend in the chart. (See Figure 12-11.)
Depending on the chart type, you can add a title and place subti-
tles on the horizontal and vertical axes. You may find labeling the
horizontal and vertical axes especially helpful when you create a
column, bar, or line chart.
• Preview: Look at the Preview window to see how your changes
affect the chart.
4. Click the Save Chart button in the bottom-right corner of the Create
Chart dialog box.
Your chart appears on top of your spreadsheet.

Chapter 12: Crunching Numbers with Google Spreadsheets

Managing charts
After you have a chart in your spreadsheet, you’re not finished! You can do
more. Just click the chart to activate it, and then click the down arrow at the
top of the chart window. (See Figure 12-12.) From the Chart menu that
appears, you have the following options:
 Edit Chart: Change the look or data range of your chart.
 Delete Chart: Get rid of the chart and start over.
 Save Image: Save your chart as a graphic file to use in other documents.
 Publish Chart: Publish your chart online for others to view easily. (For
more on publishing, see the “Printing and Publishing Spreadsheets” section,
later in this chapter.)
Formula Fixin’
Formulas are mathematical expressions that solve numeric problems. Don’t
let this technical definition deter you from using formulas — Google has
made them easy to use and understand. Formulas can use familiar operators,
such as those seen in Table 12-2.
Figure 12-12:
Manage
your charts.

You can write formulas that use these operators directly into any cell to per-
form simple mathematical calculations. To enter a formula into a cell, follow
these steps:
1. Select the cell and press =.
A formula starts with an = (equal) sign. The = sign is a trigger that tells
the spreadsheet to start calculating.
2. Type the formula.
You can use rather simple formulas, involving a single operator, or much
more complicated formulas, involving multiple operators, multiple cell
references, and the order of operations. (See the sidebar “The order of
operations,” in this chapter, for information on how operations must be
sequenced and grouped.)
3. Press Enter to enter the formula in the cell.
After you enter a formula, that formula disappears, and you can see only
the answer to that formula.
To view or change the formula itself, you must double-click the cell again to
make the formula reappear. You can now change the formula the same way
you change any value.
Take a peek at some sample formulas in Table 12-3.

Using cell references and 
selecting a range
Writing formulas with numerical values inside single cells is too manual and
inflexible, and it doesn’t take advantage of the power of spreadsheet functions
and formulas. Spreadsheets are really good at performing calculations on
numerical values in multiple cells at the same time. When performing this
magical spreadsheet wizardry, use cell references (you remember the cell
address like A1 or E5).
You can reference any cell that contains a value. In fact, any formula can ref-
erence any value in any cell. If the numerical values change, the formulas
remain intact and automatically update their calculations.
When you have a bunch of numbers in a row or column, you can perform
calculations on all of them by defining a cell range inside a formula. (See the
section “Defining a range of data for your chart,” earlier in this chapter, for an
explanation of cell ranges. For example, C5:D7 means that all the numbers
from cell C5 down to cell D7 are included as part of the range.) When you use
a cell range in a formula, the beginning and ending cells are separated with a
colon and are enclosed in parentheses (A1:F15).
To preselect a range, simply click the top-left cell and drag to the bottom-
right cell. Using this method, you can add the entire range automatically to
your formula.
216
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Built-in functions
Functions define the type of operation that a spreadsheet will perform.
Functions are built into Google Spreadsheets. You, as the spreadsheet user,
can choose from hundreds of functions. A few of the more commonly used
functions appear right on the Formulas tab, providing you one-click access.
We explain these functions in Table 12-4.

217
Chapter 12: Crunching Numbers with Google Spreadsheets
The order of operations
Calculations in spreadsheets are performed
from left to right. All formulas are subject to the
order of operations. The order of operations pri-
oritizes which actions are performed first.
Here’s how the order of operations works:
1. Calculate anything inside parentheses.
For instance, you convert (3*5)+(15/5) to
(15)+(3) before adding the numbers
together.
2. Calculate any exponents.
For example, in 5*2^2, you first calculate
2^2 before multiplying.
3. Multiply and divide.
In the example 3*4+6/3, first multiply and
divide, and then add.
4. Add and subtract.
Using the preceding example, add the
results of the multiplication and division:
12+2.
You may remember the mnemonic phrase
Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally from math
class to help you recall the order of operations:
Parentheses, Exponents, Multiply, Divide, Add,
Subtract.

You can best see how these functions work inside formulas by looking at a few
examples. We applied the Sum, Min, Max, Count, and Average functions in our
sample colonial spreadsheet, shown in Figure 12-13. We used each function in a
formula that has a range, and we applied them in the Population column. Each
formula and each function uses the same range, (D3:D7); for example, =Sum
(D3:D7) and =Average(D3:D7). In Figure 12-13, we added a label in column C for
each function in column D to show how the functions calculate.
Follow these steps to use a function in a formula:
1. Click the Formulas tab.
2. Click the cell in which you want the formula and function to reside.
3. Click the function link that you need in the upper-right corner of the
Formulas tab and enter an open parenthesis.
We clicked the Average link in Figure 12-13.
4. Click and drag over the range of numbers that you want to calculate.
5. Press Enter.
If you press Enter, you don’t need to type a close parenthesis.
Filling formulas
To apply the same functions and formulas from one column to another
column (or columns), select the cells containing the formulas, drag the Fill
Handle that appears in the corner of the cell across the columns you want to
include, and release the mouse button. See Figure 12-14.
Figure 12-13:
You can
apply basic
functions to
a range of
data.
218
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Presto! You’ve created multiple formulas. Also, the spreadsheet applies the
incremental concept, explained in the “Entering sequences quickly with the
Fill Handle” section, earlier in this chapter, to the range of cells listed in the
formula. For example, instead of again applying the formulas to the same data
range (D2:D7 in Figure 12-14), the cell references have been incremented when
they move across the columns. For example, in Figure 12-14, the cell references
were incremented to include (E2:E7) and (F2:F7). How’s that for convenience?
If you don’t want cells to automatically increment when you use the Fill
Handle, add $ to cell references to fix their positions in your formulas. For
example, using the cell reference ($D$2:$D$7) prevents the data from cells D2
to D7 from incrementing when they’re copied.
Advanced and creative online functions
If you need to apply more advanced functions, click the More link in the top-
right corner of the Formulas tab. The Insert a Function dialog box appears.
This dialog box stores every possible function you should ever need; at least,
Google hopes they’ve accounted for everything you might want to do! (See
Figure 12-15.) The dialog box divides the functions into nine separate cate-
gories to make them easier to scour through: Math, Financial, Logical, Date,
Lookup, Statistical, Text, Info, and Google. (In Figure 12-15, you can see the
Math category on the left side and the Google category on the right side.)
Google has supplied some creative, beyond-the-normal spreadsheet function-
ality that allows you to integrate and update data directly from the Internet
into a spreadsheet. For example, you can insert stock quotes into a spreadsheet
(see the sidebar “Inserting a stock quote,” in this chapter, for the steps).

Chapter 12: Crunching Numbers with Google Spreadsheets

Creating multiple sheets
Google Spreadsheets allows you to create multiple sheets in the same spread-
sheet. (Microsoft Excel calls these sheets worksheets.) You may find using
multiple sheets extremely helpful. Say you’re working on the company
budget; you can create a separate sheet for each department or each team.
You can use numbers from one sheet in formulas on another sheet, which
means the sheets can interact with each other. For example, if you’re calcu-
lating multiple expenses from three separate departments, the total expenses
for multiple departments can appear on a summary balance sheet for each
and every sheet in the spreadsheet.
To create a new sheet, simply click the Add Sheet button at the bottom of the
Google Spreadsheets screen, as shown in Figure 12-16. To make sheets easier
to find, you can give each sheet a unique name. You can even rearrange the
order of the sheets, if you want.

Sharing and Collaboration
We explain sharing and collaboration in Google Docs in Chapter 11. We won’t
repeat the information that we present in that chapter — we just provide you
with the nuances of how collaboration and sharing differ between apps. If
you want a more in-depth understanding of sharing and collaboration than
this chapter provides, check out Chapter 11.
When you share a spreadsheet, colleagues from anywhere can collaborate on
that spreadsheet simultaneously. The concept of singledocumindedness
applies to spreadsheets. Like with Docs, Spreadsheets tracks all spreadsheet
changes to maintain quality and version control. Spreadsheets updates changes
made by any number of collaborators every few seconds. Keeping a single ver-
sion of a spreadsheet, while maintaining a record of all the changes made to it,
is much more efficient than keeping multiple versions of the same sheet, espe-
cially when collaborating with a group of people on the same spreadsheet. And
Google Spreadsheets always lets you know who’s currently contributing to the
spreadsheet by listing the names of collaborators at the bottom of the screen.
221
Chapter 12: Crunching Numbers with Google Spreadsheets
Inserting a stock quote
If you want the current, updated price of a stock
displayed in a spreadsheet, click the More link
on the Formulas tab, click the Google category
in the Insert a Function dialog box that appears,
and select the GoogleFinance stock ticker func-
tion (refer to the right side of Figure 12-15). After
your spreadsheet inserts the formula, the stock
price updates from GoogleFinance every few
seconds. You have a lot of options to explore
under the More link. By clicking it and exploring
the Insert a Function dialog box, you can find out
more about the variables and attributes that you
need to make the function work properly.
The GoogleFinance function requires both a
ticker symbol and an attribute. For example: =
GoogleFinance(“GOOG”; “price”). Quotation
marks appear around the ticker symbol and the
attribute, and a semicolon is placed between
them. All these symbols and words, and the way
they’re organized, are called the syntax of the
formula. You can easily find ticker symbols on
the http://finance.google.com Web
site. Here are a few examples:
 GOOG for Google
 MSFT for Microsoft
 APPL for Apple
Attributes include commonly required stock
info, such as volume and price. Click the More
link to the right of the function description at the
bottom of the Insert a Function dialog box to
view a Web page that describes all the attrib-
utes that function uses.

To share a spreadsheet, click the Share tab. Invite collaborators and viewers
by entering their e-mail addresses in the Invite People text box, as shown in
Figure 12-17. (While you type, Google displays matching names from your
Contacts list. Click a name to select it from the list. It will be inserted 
automatically.)
You need to decide whether you want the people you invite to be collabora-
tors or simply viewers. Collaborators can make changes; viewers can only
read the spreadsheet.
Set permissions that can lock the spreadsheet down from the Advanced
Options area of the Share tab. We explain these options in more detail in
Chapter 11. Essentially, if you want to keep things private, add or remove
check marks from any options that concern you.
When you’re done choosing your security settings, click the Invite Collaborators
button. An Invitation screen appears, showing the e-mail message that goes out
to all your collaborators and viewers. This e-mail includes a Web link that the
recipients can click to access the spreadsheet. (See Figure 12-18.)
Shared spreadsheets appear in the Docs Home page list, along with other
documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. You can organize them all by
folders and labels, as explained in Chapter 10. If you need to send additional
e-mail updates concerning your spreadsheet to viewers and collaborators, click
the Share tab and click the Email Collaborators link. (Refer to Figure 12-17.) If
you need to add or delete collaborators, you can do that from the Share tab at
any time.

Discuss while you go
The Discuss tab offers another great feature for spreadsheet collaborators. If
you’re working with others, you can chat about the spreadsheet while you
work on it, as shown in Figure 12-19. In fact, you can chat about almost any-
thing you want. We bet that, after a few minutes, chatting about the spread-
sheet becomes a low priority.

Version controls
To view changes to a spreadsheet or to revert back to an earlier spreadsheet,
click the Revisions tab, then click the Older or Newer button to view the vari-
ous versions. (See Figure 12-20.) If you decide that you want to revert back to
an earlier version, click the Revert to This One button. A dialog box appears,
asking you to verify your decision.
Converting and Exporting 
to Other File Formats
You may need to convert a Google spreadsheet to a file format that desktop
spreadsheet applications, such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice, use. You
can make these conversions by clicking the File button and selecting Export
from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 12-21. Then choose the spread-
sheet format that you need from the submenu. (We explain these formats in
Table 12-5.) When you select any option, a dialog box appears that allows you
to set options and parameters for exporting your spreadsheet. If you’re even
remotely familiar with these formats, the screens should be self-explanatory.

Printing and Publishing Spreadsheets
Like with Docs, you have two ways to print your spreadsheet:
 Click the File button and select Print from the menu that appears (refer
to Figure 12-21).
 Click the Print link in the header.
If you want to preview before you print, click the Preview link. A document
appears that gives you a general idea of what the spreadsheet will look like
when you print it.
The publishing feature posts an online HTML version of your spreadsheet
and uploads a copy to your Web site or blog. You may find this a nice advan-

N
eed a quality presentation in a hurry and don’t have the time (or the
patience) for a complicated, ultra-sophisticated, über-difficult desktop
presentation program? Then you’ll like Google Presentations.
You may take advantage of the portability of Google Presentations more than
Docs or Spreadsheets. You can access and run your presentations by logging
into your Google Apps account from any computer (as long as it has an Internet
connection) — which means you don’t need to store gigabytes of presentations
on your laptop or jump drive. You don’t even need to bring your laptop or other
devices to your next presentation. If you’re traveling, you can slide through air-
port security unencumbered by a laptop (okay, you may take your iPod or
Zune), and you can be confident that your presentation is safe on a Google
server, ready for you to access anytime or anyplace you need it.
In this chapter, we cover all the basics that you need to know to create a pre-
sentation — adding and formatting text, inserting images and shapes, and so
on. We then cover how to present your work, as well as how to share and col-
laborate. Finally, we cover publishing your presentation.

Starting Up Presentations
Google Presentations is the third jewel in the crown of Google Docs, the
online productivity suite. To create a new presentation, you start from Google
Docs Home. (See Chapter 10 for details about Docs Home.) Log into Google
Docs (go to http://docs.yourdomain.com or http://docs.google.
com; Team Edition users, go to http://docs.google.com/a/yourdomain.
com). Click New and select Presentation from the menu that appears. A new,
blank presentation opens, as shown in Figure 13-1.
Similarities in the header
Many features between the three Google Docs apps (Docs, Spreadsheets, and
Presentations) are integrated or very similar. The header section contains
links and tools similar to those in Docs and Spreadsheets (as we describe in
Chapters 11 and 12): Docs Home, Help, and Sign Out links; the Save, Save &
Close, and the Discard Changes buttons; your e-mail address; and the file name.
When you create your presentations, the File menu is essential. This menu
allows you to do many tasks, such as importing, renaming, deleting, saving a
presentation as an HTML file, starting your presentation, and saving. (We
cover these tasks in the “Using the File Menu” section, later in this chapter.)

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Big differences below the header
Below the header in Presentations, the layout departs from the other apps. A
Start Presentation link replaces the Preview link that appears in the other two
apps. You use the Start Presentation link to view a presentation after you
create it. The formatting tools are in a slightly different place than in the
other apps, just above the slide design area on the right side of the screen —
which makes them more accessible when you’re working on a slide. The
space where the Edit toolbar sits in Docs and Spreadsheets is filled with a few
unique options:
 New Slide: Add a new slide to your presentation and choose from a variety
of slide layouts for each new slide.
 Duplicate Slide: Select a slide and use this link to make an exact duplicate
of the existing slide.
 Delete Slide: Remove a slide completely.
 Insert Image: Upload and insert an image into your presentation.
 Insert Text: Create separate text boxes.
 Insert Shape: Add a shape, such as a square, circle, speech bubble, star-
burst, or arrow, to your presentation.
 Change Theme: Choose a colorful theme to provide background style,
design, color, and texture to your presentations.
Don’t use the browser’s File menu to save or print your presentation; it won’t
work! Instead, use the File button and the Save and Save & Close buttons in
the Presentations header (refer to Figure 13-1) to save, print, or rename a file
(and more).
Adding Themes, Text, Shapes, 
and Images to Slides
When you start Presentations, it displays a new slide that has placeholder
text. You probably don’t want to give a presentation about “Click to add title,”
so we show you the basics of slide creation. In the following sections, you
can find out how to change the theme (look) of slides, add and edit text, add a
shape, and add images to your slides.
229
Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

Changing the placeholder text
If you’re a beginner, let Presentations make the font size and style decisions for
you until you get to know the app fairly well and feel your creative confidence
coming on. Presentations can make your presentation look good without you
having to think too much about its design, leaving you free to focus on your
message.
As soon as you start a new presentation, Presentations creates a title slide —
refer to Figure 13-1. Click the Click to Add Title placeholder text on your slide.
A text box appears in its place; click in it and type a new title. Although it’s
optional, you can add a subtitle (such as your name) by clicking the Click to
Add Subtitle placeholder text, clicking in the text box that appears, and
typing a subtitle. After you change the placeholder text, the tiny preview
slide in the slide pane on the left updates, as shown in Figure 13-2.
Changing themes
Themes bring together color schemes, templates, and font choices that are
designed to work well together. Some artistic person somewhere created the
themes so that the rest of us can just click and type, and still create a great-
looking presentation.
Pick an attractive theme by clicking the Edit tab’s Change Theme button
(refer to Figure 13-2). The Choose Theme dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 13-3, giving you many premade themes to select from. Happily,
Presentations offers some great options, so you can avoid any obnoxious color
schemes. Remember to keep your audience in mind when choosing a theme for
your presentation. For example, Pink n’ Pretty is very, well, pretty — but you
Figure 13-2:
Enter a title
and subtitle
for your
slide in the
place-
holders.
230
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

should probably avoid it unless you’re Elle Woods (you know, from the
Legally Blonde movies). For the sample presentation shown in the figures
throughout this chapter, we used the Chalkboard theme; it’s a stark choice,
but it shows up well on the black-and-white pages of this book.
Some old-school presenters say that you should enter all your content into a
blank presentation first, and then pick a theme and color scheme later. However,
we prefer to pick a colorful theme right off the bat, and then start adding con-
tent. It’s much more fun that way. Colors, stripes, images, fades, and textures
get the creative juices flowing. After all, presentations are a visual medium,
so why be boring at the start?
Another value of picking your theme early is that each one has a different
layout. You may need to tweak your words and pictures a bit so that every-
thing looks readable and balanced. Besides, if you suddenly decide that a
particular theme isn’t right, you can always change it midstream by clicking
the Change Theme button again and picking a new theme entirely. You never
need to be stuck with a boring theme.
Inserting text boxes and formatting text
If you’re using a theme, a few default text boxes appear in the slides. To create
a text box that doesn’t fit inside the normal template, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert Text button.
A new text box appears with the placeholder text Click to Add Content. 
Figure 13-3:
Pick a
theme from
the Choose
Theme
dialog box.
231
Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

2. Click in the text box and type away.
You can also paste text that you cut or copied from elsewhere.
Much like in Docs, you can type, format, and edit text in the text box.
When you finish typing, click outside the text box. (See Figure 13-4.)
3. Move the text box or resize it as needed to accommodate the text you
added (you may need to click the text box to select it):
• Move: Hover your cursor over the side of the text box; when the
cursor changes into a cross with four arrows, click and drag to
move the text box wherever you need it.
• Resize and reshape: Click a corner handle and drag to reshape and
resize any text box anyway you want. If you have text inside the
text box, the text reflows to fit the new dimensions.
Take a close look at the formatting tools at the top of the slide design area in
Figure 13-4. We used the formatting buttons to change the text in the bottom
text box to the Georgia font. We also added italics and changed the text color
to yellow.
We cover all the formatting tools available in Presentations in detail in
Chapter 11. They all work the same way in Presentations as they do in Docs
or Spreadsheets (click the button and type, or select text and click a button
to apply that format to the selected text). They also share the same keyboard
shortcuts (if applicable).
Table 13-1 shows the keyboard shortcuts specific to Presentations. (For more
keyboard shortcuts, see Chapter 11.)

You can add a link in your presentation (see Chapter 11 for the steps to add a
link). Putting a hypertext link into your presentation has advantages. If you
need to access Web sites or online articles during your presentation, list them
in your slides so that they’re ready when you want them to appear. Also, you
can put a link to your company or school Web page somewhere convenient
(such as on the title slide) so that you can link to it quickly. In the example at
the top of Figure 13-5, we entered the URL www.ardsleybooks.com.
On your presentation, you can click any hyperlinked text to edit or remove
the hyperlink. (See the bottom of Figure 13-5.)
A few buttons that you can use in Docs and Spreadsheets don’t appear in the
Presentations formatting toolbar. You don’t need options such as the Docs
Style feature in Presentations because you determine the styles by selecting a
theme, as described in the “Changing themes” section, earlier in this chapter.
The Cut, Copy, and Paste buttons don’t appear in Presentations. However,
you can still cut, copy, and paste text, shapes, and graphics by using the key-
board shortcuts Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+V (Windows) or Ô+X, Ô+C, and Ô+V
(Mac). You can also select your text and then right-click to bring these
options up in a contextual menu, as shown in Figure 13-6.
233
Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

With some browsers and operating systems, when you cut, copy, and paste, a
warning dialog box appears, asking whether you want to allow the Web page
to have access to the system Clipboard. Click the Allow Access button to
allow temporary access, and then try your operation again.

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Inserting shapes
You can add simple shapes to your presentation, such as squares, circles,
speech bubbles, starbursts, and arrows. For example, you can add arrow
shapes to create a simple flowchart.
Follow these steps to insert a shape:
1. Click the Insert Shape button.
2. From the menu that appears, select the shape that you want to insert.
The shape appears in the middle of your slide.
3. Move, resize, and recolor the shape, as needed:
• Move: Click and drag the shape to move it into position.
• Resize: Click a corner handle (you may need to click the shape first
to select it), and then drag to resize or reshape the image.
• Add color: Click the Paint Bucket or Line Color button in the top-
left corner (you may need to click the shape first to select it), and
then pick a color square from the menu that appears, as shown in
Figure 13-7.
Inserting images
A presentation can be boring if it’s all text (even with a theme applied). You
can add images to your slides to make your presentation more visually
appealing to the audience. You can also insert images, such as charts or
graphs, that you create in Google Spreadsheets.
Figure 13-7:
Insert
shapes and

them.
235
Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

To insert an image into a slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert Image button.
The Insert Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-8.
2. Click the Browse button.
3. In the Choose File dialog box that appears, browse to your picture
file, select it, and click the Open button to return to the Insert Image
dialog box.
You can use only Web-compatible image files: .jpg, .gif, or .png.
(Presentations can’t load other types of image files, such as .tif.)
You can insert a chart or graph that you create in Google Spreadsheets.
(See Chapter 12 for steps to create a chart.) In Spreadsheets, create your
chart or open an existing chart. Click the chart to select it, and then
click the Chart menu at the top of the chart. Select Save Image from the
menu, and click the Save button in the dialog box that appears to save
the file to your computer. Back in Presentations, follow Steps 1 through 3
in this list and select the chart’s image file in the Choose File dialog box.
4. Click OK in the Insert Image dialog box.
Presentations uploads and inserts a copy of the image file into your slide.
5. Move and resize the image as needed.
The default placement of the image, dead center in your slide, is proba-
bly not the right spot. The image is probably too large, as well. To adjust
your image
• Move: Click and drag the image to move it into position.
• Resize: Click a corner handle (you may need to click the image first
to select it) and drag to resize or reshape the image. (See Figure 13-9.)

236
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

If you right-click an image or a shape, a contextual menu appears that allows
you to delete, cut, or copy the image. You can also choose to make the image
look like it’s in front of or behind text or another image by right-clicking and
choosing Bring to Front or Send to Back, respectively. You can use this fea-
ture to make your presentation more visually appealing.
Organizing Slides
Unless you’re giving a ten-second presentation, you need to create more than
one slide. And, when you have a presentation with several (maybe several
dozen) slides, you may need to duplicate slides (to make the first and last slides
identical, or to start a new slide based on a previous slide, for example), delete
unneeded slides, and even change the order of slides. The following sections
show you what you need to know to create new slides and keep them organized.
Making a new slide
To build your presentation, you need to create new slides. After all, a one-
slide presentation isn’t very interesting — and it’s really short!
To create a new slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the New Slide button in the Edit tab.
The Choose a Slide Layout dialog box appears. In this dialog box, you
choose among a variety of predefined slide layout options, as shown in
Figure 13-10.
2. Click the slide layout that you want.
The new slide appears in the slide design area. Unless you choose the
Blank slide layout, placeholder text appears in the text boxes defined by
the slide’s layout.
Drag the image
to move it.
Drag a handle
to resize.
Figure 13-9:

237
Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

For most slides within a presentation, either the Text or Two Columns layouts
work well. But you can choose whichever one fits your content. In our example,
we used the Two Columns layout. This template places two text boxes side by
side, as illustrated by the dotted marquees (see Figure 13-10). In addition,
another text box appears at the top that you can use for a title or caption. To
enter a caption or a column of text, simply click any of the three text boxes and
start typing. (See the section “Inserting text boxes and formatting text,” earlier
in this chapter, for details.)
Duplicating, reordering, 
and deleting slides
The slide pane (sometimes called the slide navigator) is on the left side of the
Presentations screen. This pane displays thumbnails listing the slide order and
a caption for each slide, and you can keep your slides organized by deleting,
duplicating, reordering, and so on in this pane.
Use the Prev and Next buttons and the scroll bar in the slide pane to navigate
through the slide thumbnails. You can also use the Page Up and Page Down
keys on your keyboard. You find this pane helpful when you have more than
five slides and need to skip to a particular slide quickly.
There are two ways to rearrange your presentation in the slide pane. First, click
and drag a slide to change its order, as shown on the left side of Figure 13-11.
Second, if you right-click any slide in the slide pane, a contextual menu
appears, as shown on the right side of Figure 13-11. This menu allows you to
 Change the order of the slides: Select Move Slide Up or Move Slide
Down. (Remember, you can also click and drag a slide in the slide pane
to change its order.)
Figure 13-10:
Pick a slide

dialog box.
238
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

 Create a new slide: Select New Slide. (See the preceding section for
more information on creating a new slide.)
 Duplicate an existing slide: Select Duplicate Slide. When you duplicate a
slide, you make an exact copy of a slide, including all the text, images,
shapes, and layout of the existing slide. The duplicate slide appears
below the original slide in the slide pane. (You can also click and drag a
slide while holding the Ctrl key on your keyboard to create a duplicate
wherever you like.)
 Delete a slide: Select Delete Slide. If you accidentally delete a slide,
press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ô+Z (Mac) or click the Undo link in the top
center of the screen right away to restore your slide. You won’t be able
to retrieve it after you make any other edits.
 Copy and paste an existing slide: Select Copy Slide. Place the mouse
cursor where you want the copied slide to appear in the slide pane,
right-click, and select Paste Slide from the menu that appears. Your slide
will appear immediately below the slide you clicked.
Of course, if you need to edit a slide, select it in the slide pane first to make it
appear in the slide design area.
This simple idea can save you time: If you’ve worked hard on a slide and
intend to use some of the same elements (caption, image, or text) in the fol-
lowing slide, click the Duplicate Slide button on the Edit toolbar or right-click
and select Duplicate Slide from the contextual menu. Then, you can edit and
change just a few elements, leaving the rest of the slide intact.

Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

Using the File Menu
One of the most important tools in Google Presentations likes to hang out
inconspicuously in the top-left corner of the screen. Don’t underestimate its
power, though, as you create your presentations, you absolutely need to
understand the Presentations File menu.
The File menu, shown in Figure 13-12, allows you to do many tasks, such as
creating a new file; opening a file; uploading or importing a presentation;
saving, renaming, and deleting a presentation; seeing a print preview; saving
a file as HTML; and viewing a presentation.
Renaming a presentation
One of the key things that you can do from the File menu is rename your pre-
sentation. You may initially get stuck with a name like Untitled.
To rename a presentation, click the File button and choose Rename from the
menu that appears. (You can also click the title itself to rename the presenta-
tion.) A dialog box pops up, and you can type a new presentation title in the
textbox that appears.
A warning about scripted dialog boxes may appear in your browser when you
try to rename a file — just click on the warning bar and choose Temporarily
Allow Scripted Windows from the menu that appears. The browser then
allows the dialog box to appear when you choose Rename from the File menu
again, and you can rename your presentation by typing a new name in the
text box that appears.

menu to

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Saving a PDF copy of your presentation
You can save a PDF copy of a presentation on your hard drive or jump drive
in case you ever do need a backup. This is particularly handy if you will be
presenting from a computer that doesn’t have an Internet connection. To do
this, click the File button and select Save As PDF from the menu. (Refer to
Figure 13-12.) By choosing this command, you can save a small, compressed
copy of your presentation.
If you have Adobe Reader installed (you can download it at
www.adobe.com/reader), the PDF may appear directly in your browser
window. Click the Save button on the Reader toolbar to show a dialog box
that lets you choose where you would like to save your file. Otherwise, a
dialog box appears directly in your browser, asking whether you want to
open or save your file. Click the Save button, and browse to a location on
your hard drive or a jump drive to save the File. After you save the file, you
can open it later with Adobe Reader to view it.
To present your PDF presentation, open your PDF file in Adobe Reader, and
then choose File➪Full Screen Mode or press Ctrl+L (Windows) or Ô+L (Mac).
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move forward and backward.
Printing the presentation
You can easily print a copy of your presentation. Click the File button and
select Print from the menu that appears, or press Ctrl+P. Google Presentations
then prepares the presentation for printing in the window that appears, as
shown in Figure 13-13. Choose the number of slides you want to appear on
each printed page by selecting from the Layout drop-down list. Click the Print
button when you’re ready to print a copy of your presentation. You can also
click the Save As PDF button to save a PDF version.
Uploading existing PowerPoint 
presentations
You may have a few PowerPoint presentations on your desktop computer
that you want to convert into the Google Presentations format and save
online. In fact, you may want to carefully preserve a copy of all your
PowerPoint presentations on Google servers so that you don’t lose all your
hard work if a computer crashes. To upload a PowerPoint presentation, click
the File button and select Upload a File (.PPT, etc.) from the menu that
appears. The Upload a File screen appears, as shown in Figure 13-14.
241
Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

When the Upload a File screen appears, you can see the limitations on your
PowerPoint uploads. For example, your uploaded presentation can’t currently
exceed 10MB. Click the Browse button to locate your PowerPoint presentation.
(You can also convert other open source presentations.) If you want to rename
the PowerPoint presentation, click in the What Do You Want to Call It text box
and type a new name before you click the Upload File button.

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Integrating other slides into a presentation
When you create a presentation, you may want to insert a slide, or series of
slides, that you’ve already created for another presentation. You can integrate
both PowerPoint and Google Presentations slides. To integrate individual slides
from another file, click the File button and select Import Slides (.PPT, etc.) from
the menu that appears. The Import Slides dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure13-15. In this dialog box, just follow the steps — the first step asks you to
choose the presentation from which you want to import slides.
Thumbnails of the slides from the presentation that you choose appear in the
Import Slides dialog box. You can then select the check box foreach slide that
you want to integrate into your presentation, as shown in Figure 13-16. The
slides that you select are copied into your existing presentation. As soon as
you’ve selected all the slides you want, click the Import button, and the dialog
box closes.
You may need to move the newly integrated slides up or down to place them
in the order that you want, as we explain in the section “Duplicating, reorder-
ing, and deleting slides,” earlier in this chapter. Alternatively, right-click any
thumbnail in the slide pane and choose Move Slide Up or Move Slide Down.

Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

Viewing Revisions
What if you make a mistake or add too many slides, and you need to retreat
back to an earlier version of your presentation? Like with Docs and Spreadsheets,
Presentations tracks every change that you, and those collaborating with
you, make to your presentation in the Revisions tab, as shown in Figure 13-17.
You can always revert back to an earlier version by clicking a Revision # link
on the left side of the Revisions tab. A preview of the older version appears in
the Presentations window, and if you want to use that version, click the
Revert to This Version button.

Giving Your Presentation
Google Presentations gives you two great ways to present your presentation.
First, you can display your presentation from any computer in the traditional
way — by projecting it to an audience in a meeting room, classroom, or audi-
torium. This is a great way to present to a group of people that are gathered
together in a room. Second, you can give your presentation on the Web and
let other remote participants follow along on their computers and interact
with you in a group chat. This is an excellent way to share your ideas with
people in different locations or around the world.
Projecting your presentation
To begin a large group presentation, first make sure you have an Internet-
enabled computer that is hooked up to a projector. Then log into your Google
Apps account, open your presentation, and click the Start Presentation link at
the top of the screen or press Ctrl+F5 on your keyboard.
Your presentation loads in a new browser window at full-screen size.
(However, you will probably still see the window border.) To hide the window
and see your presentation full-screen, press F11. When you have finished
viewing your presentation, press F11 again to restore your browser window.
(Don’t worry; if you forget about the F11 key, Google Presentations shows a
temporary, transparent box at the top of your screen when you first start
your presentation to remind you about it.)
You’ll also notice the Audience panel that appears on the right side of the
presentation. We talk more about the Audience panel in the “Discussing the
presentation with your audience” section, later in this chapter. To hide that
panel, simply click anywhere along the left edge of the panel (look for the
little arrow), as shown in Figure 13-18.
To move from slide to slide, either forward or backward, click one of the
arrows in the bottom-left corner of the presentation screen. These arrows
appear in a transparent box, so you need to scroll over them to make them
fully visible. You can also use your arrow keys, Page Up and Page Down, or
the spacebar to advance slides.
If you use Internet Explorer, exit the full-screen mode by pressing either F11
or Esc. You can also move your mouse to the top-right corner of the screen,
and the Close button appears. Click the Close button to end the presentation.
245
Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

Leading a Web presentation
One of the great advantages of Google Presentations is that you don’t have to
present your presentations face to face with your audience. Using Web pre-
sentations, you invite others to follow along with your presentation while you
chat about it directly in your presentation, talk about it with Google Talk, or
have a conference call on Skype (check out www.skype.com to find out
more).
To start a Web presentation, you must first send each member of your audi-
ence a link to your presentation. After they have this link, they can view the
presentation, print out slides, and participate in group chat. Here is the easi-
est way to create an audience:
1. Log into Google Docs, open your presentation file, and click the Share
tab in the top-right corner of the screen.
You see a screen similar to Figure 13-19.
2. Click inside the text box below Invite People on the left side of the
screen, and enter the e-mail addresses of the people you want to join
your presentation.
3. (Optional) Click the Choose From Contacts link and select participants

mark to the left of their names), and then click the Done button.

4. Select the As Viewers radio button and click the Invite Viewers button.
Alternatively, to add co-presenters, repeat Steps 1 through 3, and in Step
4, select the As Collaborators radio button, and finally, click the Invite
Collaborators button.
The Email Presentation dialog box appears. If you enter e-mail addresses
for participants that are outside of your domain, you see a dialog box
asking you to confirm that you would like to invite them. Click OK to
load the Email Presentation dialog box.
5. Compose an e-mail message in the text boxes that appear (include a
short message and details about your presentation), and then click the
Send button to return to your Share screen.
Your message will be sent to your participants along with a link to view your
presentation. In the message, you may want to include the specific date and
time when you will discuss your presentation online. Also, participants
must have a Google account or create one to be able to participate.
6. (Optional) In the bottom-right corner of the Share screen, click the Create
Event with Viewers link to create a Calendar event with your viewers.
In the new Event Details dialog box that appears, enter the date and time
you would like to meet and click Save Changes. You may be warned
about sending an invitation outside your domain (click OK) or asked if
you want to send an e-mail invitation (click Send if you do). When you
are finished creating your invitation, close the Event Details dialog box.
Note: The event will include a link to your presentation as well.
7. Click the Edit tab to return to your presentation. When you are ready
to start your Web presentation, click the Start Presentation link at the
top of the screen or press Ctrl+F5.

Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

When you start a Web presentation online, you’re initially in control. Each
member in your audience that has opened your presentation appears in a list
in the Audience panel. You can deliver the presentation to your audience
slide by slide, just like you would to an audience in an auditorium. When you
click the Forward or Back button, your audience sees the slides that you
want them to see in the order that you present them.
Audience members can choose to stop following you and to flip through
slides at their own pace on their personal screens by clicking the left and
right arrows on their screen. When this happens, they see a small slide in the
top-right corner of their screen that reflects your current position. To start
following you again, they should click the Follow the Presenter link, as shown
in Figure 13-20.
To add any latecomers to your presentation that were not invited previously,
copy the presentation address that appears in a text box in the top-right
corner of the Audience panel (refer to Figure 13-20) or as a link along the
bottom of the screen, paste it into Google Talk or an e-mail message, and
send that message to your contacts. These contacts must be users in your
domain to join immediately; otherwise, you must add them as viewers (as
described in the previous steps).
Discussing the presentation 
with your audience
The Audience panel has similar features to Google Talk (see Chapter 7). You can
discuss your presentation with your participants while you collectively view the
presentation. This panel can serve another purpose: Your collaborators can
Figure 13-20:
Audience
members
can go at
their own
pace or
follow the
presenter.
248
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

chat about the presentation collectively and hammer out details as you all
make changes. (Refer to Figure 13-20.)
When new people join your presentation, they appear in your Audience list.
You can track the names of who’s coming and going with a quick glance at your
Audience panel.
Participants can also print hard copies of the slides in your presentation by
clicking the Print Slides link in the bottom-right corner of the presentation.
(See the “Printing the presentation” section, earlier in this chapter, for details.)
Relinquishing control
You can hand the presentation off to a co-presenter by clicking the Stop
Presenting link at the top of the Audience pane. Another presenter (whom
you should have invited as a collaborator, as described in the “Leading a Web
presentation” section, earlier in this chapter) can then take over the presen-
tation by clicking the Take Control of Presentation button that appears in his
or her Audience panel. (See Figure 13-21.)
If you’re participating in a presentation and think that the current presenter
is going too fast or too slow, you can always click back and forward through
the presentation at your own pace.
Sharing, Collaborating, and 
Publishing a Presentation
As with Documents and Spreadsheets, Google Presentations allows you to
collaborate with other team members or contacts on your presentation with-
out having to e-mail files back and forth and worry about having too many
Figure 13-21:
Another
presenter
can take
control of a
presenta-
tion.
249
Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

versions of the same presentation. (See Chapter 11 for more details on shar-
ing and collaborating.) The collaboration feature is one of the reasons we like
Google Docs so much.
In this section, we go over how to e-mail your presentation link to other
users, set up collaborators, and finally, publish your presentation to a Web
page so that anyone can view it.
E-mail a presentation
You can easily share a presentation by e-mailing your audience a link to it. If
you want to send the presentation to others, click the Email link in the
header. A simple e-mail form appears, as shown in Figure 13-22. Click in the
Subject text box and type a subject, and then click in the Message text box
and type a message (we like to keep it short and sweet). Click Send. (You may
want to Cc yourself by selecting the CC Me check box below the message.)
The e-mail message that your friend, family member, or colleague receives
includes a link to the actual presentation itself. Remember that you’re sharing
only one copy of the presentation with however many people need it (single-
documindedness). (See Figure 13-23.) After your contact receives the e-mail, he
or she can view the entire presentation and even make changes if you give him
or her collaborative rights, which we discuss in the following section. The pre-
sentation appears in his or her Docs Home list.
Figure 13-22:

250
Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

Inviting collaborators and viewers
Beyond giving Web presentations, you can use Google Presentations to invite
people as either collaborators or viewers. Collaborators can not only co-present
with you, but also make changes to the presentation itself. And viewers don’t
have to participate in your presentation to flip through the slides on their
own time.
Start inviting people by clicking the Share tab, as shown in Figure 13-24.
Select the As Collaborators radio button to allow people that you invite to
edit your presentation; select the As Viewers radio button to allow the people
you invite to only view the presentation. Click in the Invite People text box
and enter the e-mail addresses of the people that you want to invite.
You can further increase the security around your presentation by not selecting
the Advanced Permissions check boxes, shown in Figure 13-24.
Figure 13-24:

251
Chapter 13: Create Amazing Google Presentations

When you finish specifying your security settings, click the Invite Collaborators
(or Invite Viewers) button, and an e-mail invitation screen appears, letting you
send an e-mail message to your collaborators or viewers. This e-mail provides
its recipients with a link so that they can access the presentation.
If you need to send additional e-mail updates concerning your presentation,
click the Share tab and click the Email Collaborators link. The Email Collaborators
window appears, letting you write a message to your team. You can also create
Calendar events using the Create Event with Collaborators link and filling in the
details on the Events Details window that appears. If you need to add or delete
collaborators, you can do that from the Share tab, as well, by clicking the X to the
right of each contact’s name.
Publishing a presentation
The Google Presentations publishing feature may seem like a bit of an after-
thought, considering all the sharing, e-mail notification, discussion, and col-
laboration features explained in the preceding sections. However, because it’s
the only tab on the entire screen that we don’t talk about in another section
in this chapter, we give it a brief mention.
You can publish a presentation online with two or three simple clicks. Click the
Publish tab, and then click the Publish Document button (shown in Figure 13-25).
After a few seconds, the URL (Web address) of the published presentation
appears on the screen. You can copy the URL and send it to anyone who you
would like to see your presentation. Additionally, the option to embed a mini
player that will present your presentation on a Web page will appear. (See
Figure 13-26.) Copy the code in the text box on the left and paste it into a Web
page you have created to have your presentation appear (refer to Chapter 16
for instructions with Google Page Creator).
Figure 13-25:

Part III: Getting to Work: Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations 

If you want to limit publication to just the members of your Google Apps
domain, select the Viewers Must Sign In with a <YourDomainName> Account
to View the Published Document check box.
If you decide that you want to stop publishing your presentation online,
return to the Publish tab and click the Stop Publishing button, shown in
Figure 13-26.

Popping the Hood:
Google Apps
Administration

In this part . . .
I
f you want to use Google Apps in your organization,
you need to be familiar with a few more tools beyond
the actual apps. So, for the administrator types, we put
together the essentials for adding users, customizing your
group or organization Start Page, creating a quick and
easy Web site, and tweaking your Google Apps. You can
do it all from the Dashboard, which we describe in the
first chapter in this part.

Chapter 14
The Dashboard
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with the Dashboard
 Creating and managing user accounts
 Changing domain settings
L
ike the rest of the apps, the Dashboard is designed to be simple to use and
enables administrators to manage users and customize apps with a few
clicks. (We’re going to venture out on a limb on this one, but we bet you were
just a little excited when you clicked that last Continue button during Google
Apps setup and saw the Google Apps Dashboard for the first time.) Using the
Dashboard, you can take control and share the Google power with everyone
else in your organization.
Attention Team Edition users: One of the advantages of Team Edition is that
there are no administrator controls to worry about. That being said, you can
jump to the head of the class and skip to Part V for troubleshooting tips and
other cool Google Apps. However, if you would like to create a simple Web
page for your team, you might find the instructions for Google Page Creator
(http://pages.google.com), located in Chapter 16, helpful. When your
company or school finally makes the switch, all these tools, including the
Dashboard, will be available for the administrators.
In this chapter, we point you to all the important options in the Dashboard,
help you customize the look and feel of your apps, and get you on your way
to empowering your users by sharing the Google Apps love and giving them
administrator accounts, too.
Exploring the Dashboard
Managing your Google Apps is straightforward and simple for administrators
who use the Dashboard. The Dashboard is a control panel that gives you access
to all your user settings, as well as apps settings and configuration options.

Logging into the Dashboard
The Dashboard is powerful and incredibly simple, but if you can’t remember
how to get there, it’s pretty useless. So, make sure you take a moment and
memorize the following address (adding it to your bookmarks or favorites
might not be a bad idea, either): www.google.com/a/yourdomain.com
You can find this address in the confirmation e-mail that you receive when you
sign up for Google Apps. Of course, replace yourdomain.com with your
actual domain name.
Now, open your browser and go to the preceding address. You know you’re in
the right place if your screen looks like Figure 14-1. After you get to this screen,
log in by using your administrator account. (See Chapter 2 for instructions on
setting up Google Apps and creating your administrator account.)
Getting familiar with the Dashboard
Google has a knack for making complex systems manageable and useable.
The Dashboard is no exception. You can access all the tools that you need to
manage your users and services from the Dashboard’s main page, as shown
in Figure 14-2.
The following list describes the key tools, which are conveniently grouped on
the Dashboard:
 Navigation bar: Need to jump quickly to add new users or change
domain settings? Just click the tabs on the blue Navigation bar at the top
of the screen to jump right to the screen that you need.
Figure 14-1:
This login
screen
takes you

Dashboard.
258
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

 Tips: Each time you load the Dashboard, Google gives you a new tip to
help you get the most out of Google Apps. Click the Learn More link to
go to the corresponding page in the Help Center.
 Account information: The account information box shows your domain
name and settings, and it gives you quick links to account and user set-
tings. You can also see a graph of how active your users have been
within the last 90 days.
 Service settings: Quickly see which Google Apps are active and adjust
their settings in the Service Settings section of the Dashboard. We cover
how to adjust settings in each of these apps in Chapters 15 through 17.
For security reasons, the Dashboard automatically logs you out if you don’t
use it for a certain period of time. If you see the timeout screen, just log back
in and continue where you left off.

Chapter 14: The Dashboard

Creating User Accounts
You’re most likely not the only person running your company or group. For
this reason, you need to know how to add and delete user accounts and
adjust their account settings. In the following sections, we show you how to
create individual accounts and upload a bunch of users at the same time by
using a spreadsheet. We then show you how to update user account settings.
Unless users in your organization are getting to know Google Apps for the very
first time, it’s likely that many of your co-workers or fellow students and profes-
sors have already signed up for Google Apps Team Edition. If users already
exist for your domain, they are transferred automatically to your user list when
your organization signs up for Google Apps Standard Edition, Premier Edition,
or Education Edition. For those users, you only have to migrate their e-mail
from your old system to Gmail to complete the setup, as described in the sec-
tion about migrating existing e-mail accounts in Chapter 17.
From the Dashboard, you can access user accounts by clicking the aptly
named User Accounts button on the Navigation bar or by clicking the X Users
link (where X is the number of current users in existence) in the account
information area. The User Accounts screen opens, displaying your name and
a list of users (if you have any set up), as shown in Figure 14-3.
Figure 14-3:
The User
Accounts
screen lets
you create

settings.
260
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

Creating new users, one at a time
Unless you’re the only person in your organization who plans to use Google
Apps, you need to create accounts for everyone else whom you want to have
a Gmail address and access to Calendar, Docs, and Talk.
Follow these steps to create a new user account:
1. If you haven’t already, log into the Dashboard and click the User
Accounts button on the Navigation bar.
2. Click the Create a New User link.
The Create a New User screen appears, as shown in Figure 14-4.
3. Click in the First Name, Last Name, and Username text boxes and
enter the user’s first name, last name, and username, respectively.
When you create usernames for your employees, you should follow a set
username format. For example, some organizations use their employees’
first initial and last name, such as credwood. Another common format is
to use the employee’s full name with a period separating the first and
last names, such as cal.redwood.
4. (Optional) Google automatically assigns a temporary password for
new users. To assign your own temporary password for the new user,
click the Set Password link and type the password in the Password
and Re-enter Password text boxes that appear in place of the link.
If you assign your own temporary password, make note of the password
so that you can tell the user later.
Figure 14-4:
Enter a first
name, last
name, and
username to
create a
new user.
261
Chapter 14: The Dashboard

5. Click the Create New User button.
The new user information screen, displayed in Figure 14-5, shows the
new user’s information, including username and password, e-mail address,
and the URL from which the user can log into his or her personal Start
Page.
Click the Print Instructions link to print the new user’s vital information,
which makes a great letter to give to the user. If you need to access the
user’s information later, you can access the user information screen at
any time by clicking a user’s name in the User Accounts page.
Google lets you create up to 200 accounts for your domain by default. If you
need more, go to the User Accounts page (refer to Figure 14-3) and click the
Request More Users link.
Uploading many users at the same time
Creating individual user accounts can be fun for about the first ten users, but
then it just gets tedious. If you have a whole slew of new user accounts that
you need to create, you can save yourself a bunch of time and energy by cre-
ating many user accounts at the same time.
The first step to creating multiple users at the same time is to create a file
that contains all your new users’ basic information. Google Apps will only
import a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
Figure 14-5:
Print the
new user
information
screen for
each new
user.
262
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

You can use any spreadsheet program (such as Google Spreadsheets or
Excel) to create a CSV file by following these steps:
1. Open your favorite spreadsheet program and create a new file.
2. In the first row, enter the following headers: username, first name, last
name, password.
You must use these exact spellings with spaces in your headings — oth-
erwise, Google doesn’t recognize the information in your spreadsheet.
3. In the following rows, fill in the users’ information, as shown in
Figure 14-6.
4. Save the file in the CSV format.
In Google Spreadsheets, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export➪.csv.
2. In your browser, choose File➪Save As.
3. Enter users.csv for the file name in the Save dialog box that
appears, browse to your desktop, and click Save.
In Excel, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
2. Select CSV (Comma Delimited) from the Save As Type drop-down list.
3. Enter users.csv for the file name in the Save dialog box that
appears, browse to your desktop, and click Save.
We recommend that you save the file to your desktop so you can locate
it easier in Step 8.
5. Return to the Dashboard and go to the User Accounts screen.
6. Click the Upload Many Users at Once link.
Alternatively, you can click the Advanced Tools tab on the Navigation
bar and click the User Accounts Bulk Update link.
Figure 14-6:
You can use
a CSV file to
create
multiple
users.
263
Chapter 14: The Dashboard

7. Select the check boxes to the left of the update options, as appropriate:
• Create New Accounts: This option is selected by default and auto-
matically creates new user accounts for users that don’t already
have accounts.
• Update Existing Accounts: If you select this check box and the
spreadsheet you upload contains a user that already exists in
Google Apps, that user’s current information will be updated with
the new details in the spreadsheet. (If the user’s information in the
spreadsheet is the same as an existing account, no changes will
occur.)
• Require a Password Change: If you select this option, Google
requires users to create their own personal password the first time
they log in. Selecting this option gives each user extra security.
8. Click the Browse button, locate the users.csv file (it’s on your desk-
top if you follow our advice in Step 4), and click Open.
9. Click the Upload and Continue button.
You now have a chance to preview the upload and make sure the first
five users look okay. If the first five upload correctly, then chances are
the rest will work correctly, too.
10. If everything looks good, click the Confirm and Run Update button to
finish importing all your users.
Google may take a few minutes to create accounts for all the users. It
sends you an e-mail after it finishes.
Adjusting User Account Settings
Inevitably, your organization changes and evolves. Employees come and go,
get married and need to change their names, or forget their passwords.
You can accommodate these situations by adjusting the user’s user account
settings. You can change a user’s name, reset his or her password, and delete
the account of anyone who has moved on to less exciting things. We show
you how to do all these user account updates and more in the following sec-
tions. Also, if you want to share your responsibility with others, we help you
promote a user to administrator, as well.
Viewing a user’s account
When you need to make any changes to a user’s account, you first need to view
his or her current account settings. To view a user’s account, follow these steps:
264
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

1. Log into the Dashboard (if you haven’t already) and click the User
Accounts tab on the Navigation bar.
2. In the User Accounts screen that appears, click the name of the user
whose details you want to change.
The user screen appears, similar to the screen shown in Figure 14-7.
Changing a user’s name
Sometimes, users decide they want to use a different name (such as using
Tony rather than Anthony or changing a last name because of marriage or
divorce). To change a user’s name, follow these steps:
1. Open that user’s User Account page (see the preceding section for
instructions).
2. Click the Change Name link that appears below the user’s name.
3. In the text boxes that appear in place of the original name, enter the
first and last names as you want them to appear for all users.
Figure 14-7:
View a
user’s
account
settings.
265
Chapter 14: The Dashboard

4. Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page to save the
new name.
Google updates changes that you make to a User Account page in your
company’s shared address book, as well as in that user’s Gmail account.
You can’t change a person’s username without creating a whole new account.
But here’s a neat trick: Click the Add a Nickname link and enter a new user-
name in the text box that appears to create a new e-mail alias that automati-
cally forwards messages to that user’s main account. Now, any messages that
are sent to either the original e-mail address or the e-mail alias will arrive in
the same original user mailbox.
Resetting a user’s password
The user’s current password is hidden by default, but you — as the 
administrator — can reset it to a default password.
If a user forgets his or her password, follow these steps to reset it:
1. Open that user’s User Account page (see the section “Viewing a user’s
account,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions).
2. Click the Change Password link to reset the password to a default one.
3. (Optional) For added security, you can select the Require a Change of
Password in the Next Sign In check box.
This setting forces the user to enter a new password when he or she
logs in with the default password.
4. Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the screen to save the
new password.
Suspending a user
Suspending a user disables his or her account without actually deleting it.
The user can’t log in or access any e-mail messages or files until you restore
the account. (You can’t access that user’s e-mail or files until you restore the
account, either.)
Because you can have unlimited users, suspending a user is a much safer way
to disable someone’s account than deleting it. Suspending a user also keeps
his or her shared files intact so that you (or another administrator) can
access them later, if necessary.
266
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

Follow these steps to suspend the user:
1. Open the user’s User Account page (see the section “Viewing a user’s
account,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions).
2. Click the Suspend User link.
A peach-colored box appears below the username, asking whether you
really want to suspend a user.
3. Click the Suspend User button.
Another peach-colored box appears, indicating that the user has been
suspended. The changes are saved automatically.
4. Click the Back to User List link in the top-left corner of the screen to
return to the User List screen.
Restoring a suspended user
If a user whose account you’ve suspended returns or you want to gain access
to that account, you can restore that user’s account. Follow these steps to
restore access to a suspended account:
1. Open that user’s User Account page (see the section “Viewing a user’s
account,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions).
2. Click the Restore User link.
A peach-colored box appears below the username, asking whether you
really want to restore the user.
3. Click the Restore User button that appears.
Changes are saved automatically and the user is instantly reactivated.
4. Click the Back to User List link in the top-left corner of the screen to
return to the User List screen.
Deleting a user
Deleting a user is permanent. When you delete a user, Google deletes all the user’s
files, including his or her e-mail messages, calendars, documents, spreadsheets,
and presentations. Make sure that your other users save a copy of any shared
files before you delete the user; otherwise, no one can access the deleted user’s
files, even if those files are shared. If no one else saves a copy, other users could
lose access to these important files. Also, you must wait five days before you can
create a new user with the same name as the person you’re deleting. We still rec-
ommend suspending user accounts instead of deleting them (see the “Suspending
a user” section, earlier in this chapter).
267
Chapter 14: The Dashboard

If, after reading the preceding warning, you still want to delete a user, follow
these steps:
1. Open that user’s User Account page (see the section “Viewing a user’s
account,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions).
2. Click the Delete User link.
A peach-colored box appears, asking whether you’re sure that you want
to delete a user and warning you that all the user’s information will be
lost.
3. If you truly want to delete the user, click the Delete User button.
Like magic, that user’s account, documents, folders, calendars, contacts,
and e-mail messages will cease to exist and your changes will be saved
automatically. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
4. Click the Back to User List link in the top-left corner of the screen to
return to the User List screen.
Making a user an administrator
You can promote a user so that he or she has administrator privileges.
Administrators, like you, have access to the Dashboard, user accounts,
calendar resources (for Premier and Education Edition users), and Web page
creation tools.
Administrators have access to user information and can change other user
passwords, including yours! Make sure that you choose only trustworthy
individuals to administer your domain.
To make a user an administrator, follow these steps:
1. Open that user’s User Account page (see the section “Viewing a user’s
account,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions).
2. In the Privileges section, select the Allow User to Administer
YourDomain check box (where User is the user’s first name and
YourDomain is your domain’s name).
Administrators can log into the Dashboard and make changes to user
accounts and services. Deselect the check box to remove a user’s access.
3. Click the Save Changes button to save the changes you made to the
user’s account.
268
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

Adjusting Domain Settings
Your company is unique. It has its own name, image, and domain. After you
set up Google Apps and create users to go along with it, you can add your
own special touch to your Google Apps, including a nice logo for your team,
group, or company.
In the following sections, we show you how to customize the way your apps
appear, including setting the color of your group’s login screen and adding a
custom logo to the Gmail, Calendar, and Docs screens.
Changing general settings
First, adjust your domain’s general settings. To go to the Domain Setting
screen, log into the Dashboard (if you haven’t already), and then click the
Domain Settings tab on the Navigation bar. The Domain Settings screen
appears, as shown in Figure 14-8.
You can change the following settings on the Domain Settings screen:
 Organization Name: Your organization name appears on every login
screen that you and your users see. Your organization’s name should
already appear in this text box because Google asks you for it when you
sign up. Still, if you want to change it, click in this text box and type the
name that you want.
 User Support: When users forget their username or password, they can
click the Forgot Your Username or Password link below the sign-in box
for any of their apps and see the message that appears in this text box.
Enter the e-mail address or telephone number of your favorite adminis-
trator guru in this box. Otherwise, users may come to you for help!
 Language: Parlez-vous Français? Habla Español? Your users can change
their individual language settings, but if most of them speak a particular
language, you can select a default language from the Language drop-
down list (Google automatically assigns English) to make life easier for

 Time Zone: Select a time zone that applies to where the majority of your
users live from the Time Zone drop-down list. The time zone that you

 Control Panel: Google is always adding new features and tools to its
apps. If you’re not using the US English version, select the Current
Version radio button to leave the control panel as it is. If you’re using US
English as your default language, you can select the Next Generation
radio button to access all the new control panel features as soon as
they’re available.
By default, Google adds new features to Google Apps only after regular
users have tested those features for some time. If your organization
prefers to stay on the cutting edge, select the Turn On New Application
Features to My Domain before They Are Rolled Out to All Google Apps
Customers check box to access these features as soon as they’re released.
Note: Some of these features will still be in beta mode, and you don’t
receive support from Google if your users have issues with them.
Don’t forget to click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.
Otherwise, you make all your changes in vain and they will be reverted to
your last saved settings.

Customizing your domain’s appearance
You probably want to customize your domain’s appearance right away. To
change the appearance of your Google Apps screens, go to the Appearance
tab by following these steps:
1. Log into the Dashboard (if you haven’t already).
2. Click the Domain Settings tab on the Navigation bar.
3. Click the Appearance link below the Domain Settings heading.
The Appearance tab, shown in Figure 14-9, appears.

Chapter 14: The Dashboard

On the Appearance tab, you can set up your custom logo and change the
color of your login box as follows:
 Header Logos: This is our favorite setting! In this section, you can
choose to upload your organization’s logo, and Google replaces the
default logo in Gmail, Docs, and Calendar with your company’s own
logo. Follow these steps:
1. Select the Custom Logo radio button.
2. Click the Browse button to the right of the Custom Image text box.
3. In the dialog box that appears, locate the image file on your computer
and click Open to return to the Appearance screen.
Google automatically scales your image to fit. Your logo looks best
if you use an image editing program to resize your logo to 143 x 59
pixels before uploading it. You must save your logo in either PNG
or GIF format before uploading it. If you have a graphic in another
format, open the file in Paint (Windows) or Preview (Mac), choose
File➪Save As, select PNG or GIF for the file type, and click Save.
4. Click the Upload button in the Appearance tab to use your logo in
place of the default Gmail and Google logos.
5. Click the Save Changes button.
The next time your users log in, they see your logo in all its custom glory.
You can always change your logo at a later time by returning to the
Appearance tab in the Domain Settings screen. When you upload a new
image, it replaces your existing one.
 Sign-in Box Color: You can select different options in this section of the
Appearance tab to change the color of the sign-in box that your users see
when they log into any of their Google Apps. Select the radio button
beside one of the preset options to use that color or select the Custom
radio button to enter your own custom colors. If you select the Custom
radio button, click in the Border and Background text boxes and enter the
hexadecimal values of the colors that you want to use for those features.
To use the hex value (the combination of letters and numbers that repre-
sents a color) of the color that you want, find the color that you want at
www.colorschemer.com/online.html, copy the value for your color,
and paste it into the appropriate Custom text box on the Dashboard.
Remember: Click the Save Changes button when you finish making changes
on the Appearance tab.

Upgrading your account to Premier
What happens when your organization outgrows Google Apps Standard
Edition? You move up to Premier! Check out Chapter 1 to see what Premier
Edition offers over Standard Edition.
This section can help you make the jump to Premier and change other general
account information. You probably don’t need to change your basic account
information, but just in case you do, you can make those changes on the
Account Information tab.
To go to the Account Information tab and upgrade to Premier Edition of
Google Apps, follow these steps:
1. Log into the Dashboard (if you haven’t already).
2. Click the Domain Settings tab on the Navigation bar.
3. Click the Account Information link below the Domain Settings heading.
The Account Information tab appears, as shown in Figure 14-10.
Glance at the options available on this page:
• Account Type: Displays your current Google Apps edition. If you are
using Standard Edition, you can upgrade to Premier Edition by
clicking the Upgrade to Google Apps Premier Edition link in this
section.
• Admin Support: Has links to the Google Help Center and discussion
group. (Premier users have access to 24/7 telephone support.)
When you contact e-mail or telephone support, you will need to
provide the Customer PIN if you want any kind of help from
Google.
• Contact Information: Enter the e-mail address to which you want
Google to send news when new features arrive or programs change
in the Primary Email Address text box.
• Secondary Contact: Enter an alternative e-mail address where
Google can send news and notifications and your password, if you
ever need to reset it.
• Email Notifications: Select this check box to allow Google to contact
you about new services or features.
• Feedback: Selecting this check box lets you help Google become
better by sharing your experiences.
273
Chapter 14: The Dashboard

4. If you’re ready to move on up, click the Upgrade to Google Apps
Premier Edition link in the Account Type area near the top of the page.
A screen similar to Figure 14-11 appears.
Be sure that you want to make the jump. You pay $50 per user per year for
Google Apps Premier Edition, after all. You also must have a minimum of
ten accounts to upgrade.
5. In the Quantity text box, enter the number of additional users your
organization would like to use. If you are using currency other than
US Dollars, select your currency from the Total drop-down list. Click
the Recalculate Total button to update your subscription information.
You can also select the check box below the subscription to have Google
automatically renew your account every year and save you the hassle of
remembering. (They send you an e-mail to remind you, of course.)

which is similar to the registration process outlined in Chapter 2.
That was pretty painless, right?
Managing your domain names
To manage your domain settings, follow these steps:
1. Log into the Dashboard (if you haven’t already).
2. Click the Domain Settings tab on the Navigation bar.
3. Click the Domain Names link.
A screen similar to Figure 14-12 appears.
Your primary domain name appears on the Domain Names tab, as well as the
date that you registered it with Google’s registration partner. To adjust your
domain settings, click the Advanced DNS Settings link. A page appears that con-
tains your login information and gives you instructions of how to log in. If you
registered with another company before signing up, a screen appears that offers
general information on how to change your DNS settings with your registrar.

Chapter 14: The Dashboard

Here are a couple other helpful options available on this screen:
 Automatic Renewal: If you registered with a Google partner, you can
choose to renew your domain name automatically by selecting the
Automatic Renewal check box. When you select this check box, the
charge for your domain name automatically shows up on the credit card
bill for the card you used to register the domain originally.
 Domain Alias: Click the Add a Domain Alias link to go to the Add a
Domain Alias screen, where you can add another domain to your e-mail
accounts. You may find this option helpful if you want users to receive
e-mail from more than one domain (such as ardsleybooks.com and
bookssite.net) in the same account. Before you complete this setup,
you must first register your additional domain with Google (see Chapter 2
to see how to register a new domain for Google Apps) or have access to
the registrar login information for an existing domain. Enter a domain
alias in the text box on this screen and click the Continue and Set Up
Email Delivery button, and on the next screen, follow Google’s instruc-
tions to set up the mail exchange (MX) records for your domain alias
(see Chapter 17 for more details on adjusting MX records).
After you finish customizing Google Apps the way you want it in the
Dashboard, you generally never need to adjust these settings again. But, if
you ever read a Help file that tells you to change MX records, CNAME, or
other DNS settings, you need to go to the Domain Name tab. We talk a bit
more about MX, CNAME, DNS, and other cool acronyms in Chapter 17.

Start Page Configuration 
and Administration
In This Chapter
 Creating the Start Page for your users
 Customizing content and adding default gadgets
 Making changes to a published Start Page
T
he Start Page has the potential to play an extremely important role for
your team, business, organization, group, or family. It single-handedly
unites all your Google Apps in one place and has the added bonus of allowing
users to customize their own Start Pages by adding their favorite gadgets
(such as news, weather, comic strips, and games).
This chapter shows you, the administrator or designated helper, how to cus-
tomize the default Start Page template so that all users in your organization
can see it. You can discover how to add style and flair to your organization’s
Start Page, as well as how to make it useful for your users.
If you’re a user who flipped to this chapter hoping to find out how to cus-
tomize your personal Start Page, turn to Chapter 3. Chapter 3 explains what
gadgets are and how you can arrange them to help you locate information on
your personal Start Page.
Changing the Default Start Page Settings
When you first sign up for Google Apps, Google automatically creates a
generic Start Page for you that looks similar to Figure 15-1. It may not look like
anything really special at first, but we help you change that in this section.

If you registered your domain name with Google, your Start Page is located at
http://start.yourdomain.com as well as http://www.yourdomain.
com until you create your own Web site (see Chapter 16 for information on
how to set up a Web site with Google Page Creator). Otherwise, you get the
address http://partnerpage.google.com/yourdomain.com until you
customize the address on the Start Page administrator page.
To begin customizing your Start Page, first log into the Google Apps
Dashboard (go to www.google.com/a/yourdomain.com in your browser).
Then click Service Settings and select Start Page from the menu that appears,
as shown in Figure 15-2.
From the Start Page Settings screen, you can do the following:
 Customize Start Page: Click this link to begin editing your Start Page. We
take you through each step in the following section.
 Change URL: Click this link to choose to use the default Start Page
address (http://partnerpage.google.com/yourdomain.com) or
create your own custom address, such as http://start.yourdomain.
com or http://info.yourdomain.com, as shown in Figure 15-3.
If you did not register your domain with Google, you have to add a
CNAME record with your domain registrar so that start or info points
to ghs.google.com. Chapter 17 explains what this is and how to do it.
 Disable Start Page: If you decide that the Start Page just isn’t for you or
your group, click this link and confirm that you want to remove it. You
can always add it back later by clicking the Add More Services link on
the main Dashboard screen.

Creating a Custom Start Page Template
for Your Organization
On to the fun part — customizing your organization’s Start Page. In the 
Start Page Settings screen, click the Customize Start Page link. (To get to 
the Start Page Settings screen, go to the Dashboard, click the Service Settings
link, and select Start Page from the menu that appears.)
When you click the Customize Start Page link, the Get Started tab appears in
the Start Page Editor, as shown in Figure 15-4. Personalizing your Start Page
template is very straightforward — the Start Page Editor enables you to cus-
tomize the Start Page by using five links along the top of the screen that take
you to tabs: Layout, Colors, Header and Footer, Content, and Publish. We

walk you through each of these tabs in the following sections. You can click
any of the tabs at the top of the Start Page Editor or go through the tabs in
order by clicking the Next link at the bottom of each tab.
On each of the tabs in the Start Page Editor, you also have the following
options, located in the top-right corner of the screen:
 Save: Every so often, Google automatically saves any changes you’ve
made. If that’s not often enough for you, you can manually save changes
at any time by clicking the Save button.
 Publish: When you’re ready to make your changes permanent, click the
Publish link. You also have the option to make your changes permanent
on the Publish tab.
 Preview: To see what your Start Page looks like along the way and view
any tweaks you’ve made, click the Preview link.
Choosing a layout
To make basic changes to your Start Page template, begin by clicking the
Layout tab at the top of the Start Page Editor screen. You have two options
for the Start Page layout, as shown in Figure 15-5:

 Fully Customizable: Select this radio button to give your users complete
control over what gadgets they can add, delete, and rearrange.
 Locked Column: Select this radio button to lock the left column but still
allow users to change the other two columns. Use this layout if you have
company or group links, a photo album that you want everyone to see,
or a news feed that everyone should read.
Customizing colors
After you make your layout choice, click the Next: Colors link at the bottom
of the Layout tab or click the Colors tab. Your screen should now look similar
to Figure 15-6. The Colors tab enables you to customize the colors for your
organization’s Start Page, including the colors of the background, gadgets,
and links.
Follow these steps to create your masterpiece:
1. Select a page element in the Choose a Page Element to Customize 
list box.
The names are pretty self-explanatory. The User Section and Locked
Section choices control the look and feel of the gadgets on the Start
Page. If you choose the Fully Customizable radio button on the Layout
tab, you don’t have to worry about the Locked Section elements.
2. Click a color square.
When you click a color square, the Start Page preview at the bottom of
the tab updates to show you how the element will look with that color. 
If you don’t see the color you want, open www.colorschemer.com/
online.html in a new window for more colors, and then copy the six-
character color code (also called the hex value) and paste it into the
Enter Color Code text box back on the Start Page Editor screen.

Chapter 15: Start Page Configuration and Administration

3. Rinse and repeat Steps 1 and 2.
Keep choosing colors for different elements until you have a color
scheme that you like. The preview at the bottom of the tab shows your
current color choices — to see what your Start Page template looks like
full-screen, click the Preview link in the upper-right corner.
Setting your header and footer
Click the Next: Header and Footer link at the bottom of the Colors tab or click
the Header and Footer tab. Your screen now looks like Figure 15-7. The header
and footer make up the top and bottom portions of the Start Page. The header
generally contains a graphic, logo, or title for you business, organization, or
group. The footer usually contains links to other Web sites or pages.
Using the toolbar, you can add text, images, and links to your header. These
tools work just like Google Docs or any other word processor. If you know
HTML, flex your coding muscles with the header by clicking the Edit HTML
link to the right of the toolbar.

2. To upload a file from your computer, click the Browse button; in the
dialog box that appears, locate the image on your computer, and then
click the Open button.
Alternatively, if the image is already on the Web, click the Web Address
(URL) link and enter the address. If the address is correct, a preview of
the image appears in the Add an Image window.

Follow these steps to add a link to the header or footer:
1. To add a link to the header, click the Link button on the toolbar. To
add a link to the footer, click the Add a Link to the Footer link at the
bottom of the tab.
The Edit Link screen appears, as shown in Figure 15-9.
2. Enter the complete Web address of the page or file to which you want
to link.
You can also link to an e-mail address (such as your support person) by
clicking the Email Address link and entering the e-mail address.
3. Click OK.
To move a link in the footer to the left or right, select the link and click the 
< or > arrow above the link name. You can also edit or remove a link later by
selecting the link and clicking the Change or Remove link (refer to Figure 15-7).
If your company already has a Web page template that you want to use as a
header or backdrop, you can easily add it to the Start Page by using the
<iframe> HTML tag. Grab your HTML editor or techie, and then enter the
following code in the main body of the template:
<iframe src=”http://start.yourdomain.com”> </iframe>
If you decide to use your own template, leave your Start Page header empty.
After you save the Start Page, users who access the Start Page through the
address where your template is located will see your Web page template,
along with the layout and colors (and any custom gadget) you have chosen.

Customizing content
When you’re ready to select your default Start Page content, click Next:
Content at the bottom of the Header and Footer tab or click the Content tab.
Your screen should now look similar to Figure 15-10.
The Content tab enables you to choose the gadgets that your users see when
they first see the Start Page.
After a user begins making changes to his or her Start Page, any edits you
make to the default gadgets in the Start Page template have no effect on the
user’s personal Start Page. However, if you select the Locked Column radio
button on the Layout tab (described in the “Choosing a layout” section, ear-
lier in this chapter), users see any updates you make to the contents of the
locked column.
Adding default gadgets
To browse the Gadget Directory and add gadgets to the Start Page template,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Add Stuff link in the top-right corner of the content box on
the Content tab.
Your screen should look similar to Figure 15-11. For descriptions of the
gadget categories, see Chapter 3.

Custom gadgets let you add information that’s specific to your organization,
business, or group. Custom gadgets may include a list of links to company
policies, partner Web sites, or photos. They can also include news feeds from
blogs or online newspapers.

colors, images, and gadgets that you think your users will find useful and
exciting — you’re ready to publish your page. Click the Next: Publish link at
the bottom of the Content tab or click the Publish tab. Your screen should
now look similar to Figure 15-16.
Before you click the Publish Updates button, make sure that you save all your
changes (the button in the top-right corner should read Saved). If you haven’t
already, preview your new template before you publish it by clicking the
Preview link in the upper-right corner one last time. A preview of your cus-
tomized Start Page template appears, similar to Figure 15-17.
You can always go back to any of the tabs and make any adjustments that
you think can make your page better.

Making Changes to the Start 
Page after Publishing
We don’t expect your team, business, school, group, or family to stay the
same year after year, so your Start Page shouldn’t stay static, either. When
the gadget technology improves and your organization evolves, you can
return to the Dashboard and make changes to your Start Page and custom
gadgets whenever you like.
Follow these steps to get back to the Start Page Editor as needed:
1. Open your Web browser and log into your Dashboard.
The address is www.google.com/a/yourdomain.com.
2. Click Service Settings on the Navigation bar and choose Start Page from
the menu that appears (refer to Figure 15-2) or click the Start Page link
in the Service Settings section on the main Dashboard screen.
3. Click the Customize Start Page link and click through the tabs, making
any adjustments you see fit.
Refer to the sections earlier in this chapter for details on each tab.
4. Click the Preview link to see your changes, and then click the Publish
Updates button to save your updates.

Creating a Web Site for 
Your Organization
In This Chapter
 Using Google Page Creator
 Putting your Web pages on the Internet
 Fine-tuning your site settings
T
o round out your Google Apps experience, Google provides an amazing
tool that lets you create and edit a simple but professional-looking Web
site right within your browser. The tool is called Google Page Creator, and we
show you how to use it in this chapter.
If you’re a Google Apps Team Edition user or normal Google user and want to
create a personal Web page for personal or professional purposes, be sure to
check out http://pages.google.com. On that page, you can create a free
Google-hosted site by using the same tips and tricks that we discuss in this
chapter. When we mention the Dashboard in this chapter, skip that step and
log into Google Page Creator directly.
Getting Started with Page Creator
You access Google Page Creator (or Google Web Pages, as it’s sometimes
called) from the Google Apps Dashboard. To begin editing your pages, log
into your Dashboard (go to www.google.com/a/yourdomain.com), click
Service Settings on the Navigation bar, and select Web Pages from the drop-
down list that appears, as shown in Figure 16-1.
The Web Pages Setting screen that appears provides the following links for
administering your Web site:

 Edit Your Web Pages. Click this link to open Google Page Creator in a
new window and begin creating or editing your pages.
 Change URL. The default Start Page address (www.yourdomain.com-
a.googlepages.com) appears in the Web Address area, but you can
create your own custom address, such as www.yourdomain.com, by
clicking the Change URL link and you will be taken to a screen where you
can enter your custom address.
If you did not register your domain with Google, you have to add a
CNAME record with your domain registrar so that www points to
ghs.google.com. Chapter 17 covers how to add and change your
CNAME records.
 Disable Web Pages. Click this link if you decide that you don’t want to
use Google Page Creator to create a Web site. You can always add
Google Web Pages later by clicking the Add More Services link on the
main Dashboard screen and then clicking the Add It Now button below
the Web Pages option on the screen that appears.
On the Web Pages Settings screen, click the Edit Your Web Pages link to 
begin editing your pages. The very first time you load Page Creator, a brief
overview of the service appears, as well as the Terms and Conditions. Select
the I Have Read and Agree check box, and then click the I’m Ready to Create
My Pages button.
Site Manager
Google Page Creator consists of two parts: the Site Manager and the Page
Editor. The Site Manager keeps track of all your pages and files, and it looks
similar to Figure 16-2. The Page Editor lets you make changes to your pages
and add content. We cover the Page Editor in the following section.

Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site for Your Organization
Crash course in Web design
Normally, a section called “Crash course in
Web design” would start out with an explana-
tion of things called HTML tags. Fortunately for
you, we can skip that because Google Page
Creator takes all the technical mumbo jumbo
out of the picture and gives mere mortals the
ability to harness the power of the Internet with
tools that are as easy to use as a word proces-
sor. To successfully create pages by using
Google Page Creator, you only need to know
how to type, copy and paste, and open a picture
file on your computer — Google does the rest.
A word on Web site structure: You may want to
draw a diagram of your Web site before you
begin creating it. If you don’t know how many
pages to create, use the following list as a start-
ing point. Many Web sites commonly consist of
four main pages, diagrammed in the following
figure. When you start creating your site, you
make a new page for each of these topics. The
following list gives you a brief description of
what kind of information each of these pages
generally displays:
About
Contact
Products
Home
 Home: Your main welcome page. It should
inform people of what to expect from your
company, group, or organization.
 About: Tell your customers about your busi-
ness, how it started, and why it should
matter to them. Share your group’s cause
with the world, tell them who the cool
people are, and explain what makes your
organization special.
 Products/Services/Projects: Use this page
to highlight your current offerings or tell
when your next community project is. You
might want to embed a public calendar in
this page, as well (see Chapter 9 to find out
how to share your calendar).
 Contact Info: Let Web visitors know how to
get ahold of the important people in your
business or group.
The preceding structure may work as a good
start for your site, but you ultimately decide
whether you want more or fewer pages,
depending on your organization and how much
information you want to share. Don’t be limited
to the options in the preceding list.

When you load Web Pages from the Google Apps Dashboard, the Site
Manager appears. Here’s what each of the tools on this page does:
 Web site address: This address appears at the top of the screen to the
right of the Site Manager page title and shows you the address where
people can visit your site. This address may appear different than the
custom address (www.yourdomain.com) you create on the Web Pages
Settings screen (see the previous section), but if you set up your custom
address correctly, you can view your page at either address.
If you are a Google Apps Team Edition or other user, your Web 
site address will start with your username (http://username.
googlepages.com). You can create up to two additional sites at 
different addresses by selecting Create Another Site from the Choose
Another Site drop-down list in the top-right corner of the Site Manager
screen. Follow the instructions on the next screen to choose an address,
select a starting layout and look (more on that later in this chapter), and
click the Create Site button.
 Pages: All the pages that you create appear in the middle of the Site
Manager. Click a link to edit a page. Your primary (or home) page shows
a little house in the page icon. (The home page is the first page that
people see when they type in your main address.)
 Create a New Page: Click this link to create a new page.
 View As: Change the way you see your pages. Grid view shows a large
icon for each page (refer to Figure 16-2). List view, shown in Figure 16-3,
shows all your pages in (you guessed it!) a list. You may find List view
especially helpful after you accumulate a large number of pages.
 Site Settings: Click this link on the right side of the screen to display the
Settings screen and adjust your site name and other options. See the
“Tweaking Your Site” section, later in this chapter, for more information.

Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

 Uploaded Stuff: When you upload photos, documents, PDFs, and so on,
they appear in the Uploaded Stuff list in the lower-right portion of the
screen. In the Uploaded Stuff list, you can upload, view, and delete your
Web site files.
When you’re editing a page and want to return to the Site Manager, click the
Back to Site Manager link in the top-left corner of the screen.
Page Editor
The main reason for using Page Creator is to get your information out on the
Internet and share it with others. In the rest of this chapter, we show you how to
use the Page Editor to change the way your pages look and how to add images,
files, and gadgets to help you create a professional, compelling Web site.
When you open a page in the Page Editor (shown in Figure 16-4), it looks a lot
like a document in Google Docs. The common formatting buttons and tools
appear along the top of the window, and you can enter content in the middle
of the window. Here’s a list of the main tools and features in the Page Editor:
 Publish: When you have your page just right, click the Publish button to
make it live. Changes that you make to each of your pages don’t appear
online until you click the Publish button.
 Preview: Click the Preview link to see how your page will appear to 
visitors.
 Change Look: Click this link to open the Templates screen, which allows
you to view and select other styles for your Web page. Click the Preview
link below a template to see a sample page in a new window. Click the
Thumbnail image of the template you would like to use and your page
will automatically be updated.
 Change Layout: Click this link to show the Layout screen, where you
change how many columns appear on your page. Click a thumbnail to
update your page.
Figure 16-3:
Click the List
link to see
your Web
site’s pages

295
Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site for Your Organization

 Formatting toolbar: The buttons on this toolbar work similarly to the
buttons on the Editing toolbar in Google Docs. Use the buttons to
change the look and feel of your page content by adding bold or italics,
changing the font color and size, creating bulleted or numbered lists,
and so on.
 Editable area: Editable areas appear in the middle of the page as text
boxes with dashed borders. Enter text, graphics, gadgets, and so on into
these areas.
 Page address: Each page has a unique address, which you can see at the
bottom of the screen. Click this link to see the page as your visitors do.
 Unpublish: Click the Unpublish link to hide your page from other
Internet visitors. Visitors that visit this page’s address will see an error
page until you click the Publish button again.
 Add Gadget: Click inside an editable area and then click this link to
show the Gadget Directory. Click a gadget, enter the custom settings (if
available) in the next screen, and then click OK to add the gadget to
your page.
 Edit HTML: If you are savvy with HTML or want to play around with the
code, click inside an editable area and then click this link to begin tweak-
ing the code in the Edit HTML window. Click the Preview tab in the top-
right corner of this window to see your changes before you click the
Update button and make them official.

Google automatically saves a draft of any changes that you make to your
pages. When you’re ready to share your changes with the world, click the
Publish button.
Editing Web Pages in Page Creator
When you open Page Creator for the first time, a home page is automatically
created for you. The following sections describe how to add and edit all the
basic Web page content — text, images, and links. We also show you how to
add Google gadgets and, if you feel adventurous, how to edit the HTML code.
You don’t have to be an HTML expert to create really nice looking Web pages
in Google Page Creator. Think of it more as a word processor that happens to
save your documents as Web pages. As we discuss in the following sections,
you can enter text simply by typing it in or copying and pasting it from
another document. Images can be dragged around to wherever you want
them to appear. So be creative and fearless and enjoy creating your very own
Web site in minutes.
Adding text
Google gives you a basic page layout to work with that consists of five differ-
ent editable areas. Just click in the editable area and type the appropriate
information.
On a new page, each editable area will show text that begins with “Click
here.” When you click inside the area, the text will disappear and allow you to
enter your desired information. The five areas you can edit are
 Title: Click in this area and type the title of your page. You generally
want to keep the title short, such as “Contact Us” or “Ardsley Books.”
 Subtitle (optional): Add a slogan or saying in this area. We also like to
include links to other pages in this area.
 Main content: Your message goes in this area. Depending on what infor-
mation you want on a particular page, you could enter contact informa-
tion or a welcome paragraph. You can also add graphics, lists,
addresses, and more to the main content area.
 Sidebar: Use the sidebar for a list of links, to highlight a featured item, to
show off a nice photo, or for whatever you like.
If you don’t see a sidebar, click the Change Layout link at the top of the
Page Creator screen, and in the window that appears, choose a layout
with a sidebar to add one.
297
Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site for Your Organization

 Footer (optional): Generally, some links to other information, such as
copyright notices or legal pages, go in the footer.
After you add text to your page, you can format it just like you do in Google
Docs. See Chapter 11 for details.
Choosing a template
To give your site a unique and fun design, the gurus at Google have created
some pretty nice templates (Web page designs) for you to choose from. To
change the template for your page, click the Change Look link in the upper-
right portion of the screen. The Choose Look screen appears, similar to
Figure 16-5.
Click the Preview link below a style to see what the template looks like on a
Web site. The sample Web site can also give you some great ideas about what
information to put on your site if you’re not sure what you want.
Your current template is highlighted in blue. To apply a different template 
to your current page, click the thumbnail of the style that you want. Google
automatically saves your page with the new template and returns you to the
Page Editor.
If you change your mind before you select a new style, click the Back to Page
Editor link at the top to return to your page without changing your page’s
look. To revert to an old style, click the Change Look link and choose your
old template. Your page is automatically updated.
Figure 16-5:
Select a
template for
your page.
298
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

If you decide to change your template after you create multiple pages, you
have to open each page and select the new template for that page. New pages
that you create match the template that you’re currently using on your home
page.
Changing the layout
You don’t have to be content with the default layout for your page content.
You can choose from four layout styles, and you can find the layout that orga-
nizes your page just how you want it.
To change the page’s layout, click the Change Layout link at the top-right of
your Page Editor. A screen that looks like Figure 16-6 appears.
Your current layout is highlighted in blue. Click the new layout that you want,
and Google automatically updates your page. New pages that you create
automatically match the layout that you currently apply to your home page.
Using font styles
Besides using the usual Font, Size, and Color tools to make your text stand
out, each template includes four font styles with preset colors and highlight-
ing to match the theme, as shown in Figure 16-7. When you fill in your page,
use these styles to give even more punch to your page:
 Heading: This biggest and boldest style helps you make clear distinc-
tions between different sections on your page.
 Subheading: Use this style to break up a section so that viewers can
more easily read it.
 Minor Heading: You can use minor headings to emphasize parts of your
text.
 Normal: Use this style for normal text — it usually isn’t anything special.
Figure 16-6:
Choose your
page layout.
299
Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site for Your Organization

Note: These font styles are different for each editable region on your page.
Your sidebar uses different colors and borders than your main content sec-
tion, for example.
Inserting links
A Web page isn’t all that useful if it’s isolated, with no links to other pages.
Luckily, adding links in Google Page Creator is a breeze.
To add a new link to your page, follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t already, log into Google Page Creator and open the
page to which you want to add a link.
2. Highlight the text that you want to make into the link and click the
Link button on the Formatting toolbar. (Refer to Figure 16-4.)
The Edit Link dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-8. You have four
different options of places to link to. Select one of these radio buttons on
the left to create a link:
• Your Pages: A list of the pages that you’ve already created appears
when you select this radio button. Simply highlight the page to
which you want to link. If you want something other than the page
name to appear, type what you want the link to say in the Text to
Display text box at the top of the dialog box. When you’re happy
with your link, click OK to insert the link into your page.
You can also create a new page directly from this dialog box by
typing a name in the Create New Page text box at the bottom and
then clicking the Add Page button.

Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

• Your Files: A list of files that you’ve uploaded appears when you
select this radio button. Select a file, enter or edit the text that you
want to appear in the Text to Display text box at the top of the dialog
box, and click OK. This option should look similar to Figure 16-9.
To upload a file from your computer, click Browse, locate the file
on your computer in the dialog box that appears, and click OK to
return to the Edit Link dialog box. Your file will automatically begin
uploading to Google Pages. Select your file and click OK when
you’re done to insert the link.
• Web Address: Select this radio button to create a link to the Web
address of another page on the Internet. As shown in Figure 16-10,
enter the address of the page to which you want to link, type or
edit the link’s text in the Text to Display text box at the top of the
dialog box, and click OK.

Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site for Your Organization

Click the Test This Link link to make sure that the address you
entered opens the correct page.
If you don’t know the Web address, open the page to which you
want to link in another browser window. Then, highlight and copy
the Web address in your browser’s address bar. Return to the Page
Editor and paste the address in the Edit Link window, then click OK
to insert the link.
• Email Address: Select this radio button to link to an e-mail address,
as shown in Figure 16-11. When visitors click this link, they can
send you an e-mail message. Enter the e-mail address to which you
want to link in the To What Email Address Should This Link? text
box. Enter or edit the link’s text in the Text to Display text box at
the top of the dialog box, and then click OK.
A note on spam: Junk e-mailers love when you put a valid e-mail
address on a Web page. They can easily add the address that
appears on your Web page to their spam lists. To foil their evil
plans for world annoyance, you should write any e-mail addresses
as “name (at) yourdomain.com” or use a graphic that shows the
e-mail address, instead of using text.
The link to another page or file appears on your page. Links appear
underlined by default.

3. To change or remove a link, click the linked text.
A blue toolbar appears, as shown in Figure 16-12. When you click the
address in the blue bar, if the link points to a page that you created in
Page Creator, a preview of that page opens. For your own pages, you
also see an Edit Page link, which opens that page and lets you make
changes to the page. Click the Change link to change the page or file it
links to or how the link appears. Clicking the Remove link removes the
link but leaves the text.
Inserting and editing images
You can easily insert images into your Web page by using Google Page
Creator. But the really neat thing about Google Page Creator is that it has
powerful image editing tools that can help you get your graphics just right.
To add an image to your page in the Page Editor, click your mouse where you
want to place the image, and then click the Image button.
The Add an Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-13. The Add an
Image dialog box shows images that you’ve already uploaded. If you haven’t
uploaded any images before, the image area is empty.

Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site for Your Organization

In the Add an Image dialog box, you have the following options:
 Uploaded Images: Select the Uploaded Images radio button to view the
images that you’ve already uploaded or to upload a new image.
To upload an image, click the Browse button. In the dialog box that
appears, locate the image file on your computer. Click Open, and the
image uploads automatically. (Be patient — larger images may take a few
moments to upload.)
Highlight the image that you want to insert and click the Add Image
button. The dialog box closes and your image appears in your page.
 Web Address (URL): Select this radio button to add an image that’s
already on the Internet. (For example, you can add a photo that you
have on a photo-hosting site.)
Enter the address of the image that you want to use in the Image URL
text box. If the address is correct, a preview of your image appears
below the text box, as shown in Figure 16-14. Click the Add Image button
to close the dialog box and insert the image into your page.
To find the address of a photo that you’ve seen on a Web site, first open that
site in another window. Right-click the image (Control-click for Mac users)
and choose Copy Shortcut (in Internet Explorer) or Copy Image Location (in
Firefox). Then return to Page Editor and paste the address into the Image
URL text box.
Some images may be subject to copyright. Make sure that you have permis-
sion to use any images that you get from Web sites you don’t own.

304
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

You don’t need fancy software to change the way your images look. Page
Creator has the tools to do that right in your browser, as shown in Figure
16-15. After you place an image in your page, click and drag that image to the
position you want. Drag the image left to make your text wrap around to the
right side of the picture. Drag the image right to make your text flow along
the left side of the picture. Drag the image to the center of your page to
center it above or below your text.
To access more advanced image editing tools, first click the image. In the
light-blue bar that appears below the image, click the Edit Image link and the
Edit Image window appears (see Figure 16-15). You can alternatively click the
Remove link on this bar to delete the image from your page. Here’s what each
of the options on the Edit Image screen does:
 Size: Select another size from the Size drop-down list (Small, Medium,
Large, Original Size, or Custom). For the custom size, type your desired
pixel width and height in the text boxes that appear at the bottom of the
screen.
 Rotate: Click these loops to turn your image 90 degrees counter-clockwise
or clockwise.
 Crop: Click this button, and then adjust the handles surrounding your
image to cut the image down to the right shape, as shown in Figure 16-16.
Click the Crop To Selection button to crop the image or click Cancel Crop
if you decide not to crop the image.

 Effects: Clicking the Effects drop-down list lets you choose other tools to
enhance your image, create funky effects, and more. Check out these
cool tools:
• Brightness: Drag the slider left or right to make your image darker
or lighter.
• Enhance: Drag the slider right to enhance the image and produce
more vivid colors.
• Grayscale: Drag the slider right to reduce the colors in your image
and turn it more black and white.
• Sharpen: Drag the slider right to refine the picture and add more
edge to it.
• Mash-Up: Choose an image to use as a watermark, and then drag
the slider left or right to make that watermark more or less trans-
parent. See Figure 16-17.
• Reset: Click this link to remove any effects that you’ve added.
Select the effect from the list on the left of the slider bar and click
the Reset link.
Play around — try some new and funky things with your images. Of course,
some of these effects may not fit with your Web site’s or business’s image (no
pun intended), so don’t go overboard.
Putting gadgets on your page
Don’t forget all those nifty Google gadgets that we talk about for your Start
Page in Chapters 3 and 15. You can add gadgets to your Web Pages, too. You
may want to add a Google Maps gadget that shows your business location, a
Figure 16-16:
Drag the
handles to
crop your

306
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

News gadget to display a feed from your company blog, or a calendar gadget
with a list of upcoming events.
To add a gadget, click the Add Gadget link in the bottom-right corner of the
Page Editor screen. The Add a Gadget to Your Page dialog box appears, dis-
playing the Gadget Directory, as shown in Figure 16-18.
After you locate a gadget that you want, click it. The Setup Your Gadget
screen appears, and you can edit the gadget options. When the gadget looks
just right, click OK to add it to your page. Note: The gadget may not load cor-
rectly until you preview or publish your page.

To adjust a gadget that you’ve already added, click it and a blue preview box
appears above the gadget. Click the Edit link in the top-left corner to open the
Setup Your Gadget screen. You can always remove the gadget later by click-
ing the Remove Gadget link in the blue preview box.
Making changes to the HTML code
If you’re the adventuresome type or happen to have a little bit of HTML expe-
rience, and you want to tweak your page further, Google Page Creator doesn’t
leave you out in the dark. Click the Edit HTML link down in the bottom-right
corner of the page to open the Edit HTML screen, where you can make
changes to tags and other techie goodness. Figure 16-19 shows the Edit HTML
screen.
From this screen, you can edit the code in the HTML tab, and then preview
your changes by clicking the Preview tab. Click the Update button when
you’re done to return to the Page Editor and update your changes on the
page.
The Edit HTML link lets you edit the code for only the selected region. For
example, click inside the title area, and then click the Edit HTML link to make
changes to the title text and graphics. As an added bonus, the <style> tag
works beautifully if you want to have absolute power over how text, graphics,
and the like appear.

Publishing Your Web Pages
After you create your Web pages to your exact specifications — adding
colors and links, optimizing your images, and finding the perfect gadgets —
it’s time to go live by publishing your pages.
You can publish your pages in two ways: individually or many at the same time.
To publish an individual page, you can open each page individually and click the
Publish button in the top-left corner of the screen. When you click this button,
the Preview link changes to the View Live link.
At the bottom of the page, an orange bar appears that has two links: View 
It on the Web and Tell Your Friends. Click the Tell Your Friends link to open 
a new Gmail message announcing your new or updated site, as shown in
Figure 16-20.
To unpublish a page, click the Unpublish link that appears at the bottom of
each page.
To publish multiple pages at the same time, return to the Site Manager. Select
the check box in the top-left corner of each page that you want to publish,
and then click the Publish button. You can also unpublish multiple pages 
by selecting the pages and selecting Upublish from the More Actions drop-
down list.

To view your live site, click the address at the top of the screen or open a
new window and enter the custom address that you set up in Dashboard (see
the “Getting Started with Page Creator” section, earlier in this chapter, to
figure out your custom Web address).
Every site created with Google Page Creator is automatically optimized for
viewing from a mobile browser on a mobile device.
Tweaking Your Site
In this section, we help you make a few other adjustments from your Site
Manager. Click the arrow to the right of More Actions to see a drop-down list
of additional options for your pages.
Go through and clean up your Web site from time to time. An occasional
cleaning keeps your information up to date and accurate. The tools in the
More Actions drop-down list help you keep your site with the times.
Select the check boxes to the left of individual pages or click the Select: All
link to choose all your pages. Then, select one of the following options from
the More Actions drop-down list. In some cases, a dialog box will appear to let
you confirm your choice. Otherwise, the tasks are performed automatically.
 Tell Your Friends. Select this option to compose an e-mail that tells your
friends, customers, or group members about a particular page or group
of pages.
 Discard Unpublished Changes. Choose this option to revert any pages
back to the way they appeared the last time you published them.
 Unpublish. Choose this option to remove the selected pages from the
Internet. Visitors get an error message when they try to load these
pages.
 Duplicate. Select this option to create an exact copy of the selected
page or pages.
 Delete. Choose this option to permanently remove pages from your site.
Make sure that you really want to delete the page or pages before choos-
ing this option because after you select this option, those pages perma-
nently cease to exist.
Additionally, you can change some specific site settings to help optimize your
site. Click the Site Settings link, and the Settings screen appears, as shown in
Figure 16-21. You can then make the necessary changes to the settings:
310
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

 Site Name: Click in the Site Name text box and enter the name that you
want to appear in the title of each of your pages. The name that you
enter appears as a part of each page’s title, such as “Ardsley Books —
Home” or “Ardsley Books — Contact Us.”
 Site URL: This section displays the address where people can access
your site. The address that appears in this section may be different than
the address you set in the Dashboard. See the beginning of this chapter
to find out how to set up your custom URL.
 Homepage: Select the page that you want to make your default page
from the Homepage drop-down list. This page loads first when someone
visits your Web site.
 Image Upload: We recommend that you select the Optimize the Size of
Uploaded Images check box to optimize your uploaded images. That’s
because this setting allows you to upload more photos to your site, and
visitors can see your pages much more quickly.
 Adult Content: Although Google doesn’t restrict adult content, it does
ask you to select the The Content on My Pages May Be Unsuitable for
Minors check box to help protect users who don’t want to view adult
material.
 Hide This Site: While you make changes, select the Make Pages in This
Site Unavailable to the Public check box to make your site invisible to
visitors (they will see an error page when they try to access the page
directly). Published pages don’t appear on the Internet until you unhide
your Web site.

Tweaking Your Apps
In This Chapter
 Customizing your Google Apps addresses
 Making individual apps active or inactive
 Changing Gmail and Talk settings
 Adjusting Calendar settings
 Giving your Docs the right level of security
You don’t have to live with the default settings for your Google Apps if
you don’t want to. In this chapter, we show you the technical domain-
altering tasks that you can use to tweak your apps to your heart’s content
and really nail down how you want them to behave.
This chapter starts by helping you get your custom addresses to work with
your domain, and then it dives into how to change settings in Gmail and Talk.
We finish up by showing you how to adjust your Calendar and Docs.
Creating Custom Apps Addresses
If you registered your domain name with Google Apps, your apps already 
use the default custom addresses shown in Table 17-1. (We refer to these
addresses throughout this book.)
If you sign up with Google Apps by using an existing domain, Google provides
temporary alternative addresses because Google does not have access to
change your domain’s settings. To create custom addresses, you have to
make changes to your domain’s CNAME records with your registrar. You may
find these temporary addresses really helpful if you want to make sure your
Google Apps work smoothly before you make the complete transition.

To enable or create your own custom addresses, all at the same time, follow
these steps:
1. Log into your Dashboard.
The Web address for your Dashboard login page is www.google.com/
a/yourdomain.com.
2. Click the Service Settings button on the Navigation bar and, from the
menu that appears, select the app that has the URL you want to change.
That app’s Settings screen appears.
3. In the Web Address section, click the Change URL link.
A screen similar to Figure 17-1 appears.
Figure 17-1:
Create a
custom URL
for the Start
Page or any
other app.

Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

4. Select the radio button to the left of the custom address, click in the
text box, and enter a custom address name.
5. (Optional) If you want to change the addresses for multiple apps at the
same time, click the Change URLs for All Domain Services link.
A new screen appears, listing all your apps’ addresses with radio but-
tons that let you choose the default or custom address.
Unless you registered your domain directly with Google (see Chapter 2),
changing the custom URL doesn’t automatically make that address
active and usable. You must add a CNAME record with your registrar to
point the new address to Google’s servers.
Depending on whom your organization registered its domain with, the
next few steps could be a bit tricky. This process is similar to the
CNAME domain name verification method described in Chapter 2.
To find specific instructions for different domain registrars, open www.
google.com/support/a in your browser and search for CNAME. If you
have trouble finding the DNS management page, contact your registrar’s
support center directly. They can show you exactly where you need to go.
6. Open a new browser tab or window, log into your domain registrar’s
Web site, and open the DNS management page or control panel.
This page should show a list of your CNAME entries, similar to the page
in Figure 17-2.

Chapter 17: Tweaking Your Apps

7. In the CNAME or Alias section (depending on your registrar), click the
link or button that lets you add or create a new CNAME.
In Figure 17-2, it’s the Add New CNAME Record button. A new screen
appears, allowing you to enter your new CNAME values in various text
boxes.
Before you create a new CNAME entry, be sure to delete any existing
entries that match the one you’re trying to add. For example, if a CNAME
for mail already exists, delete that CNAME before you add a new mail
CNAME that points to Google’s servers.
8. Click in the Alias Name (or similar) text box and enter the custom
name that you select in Step 4.
9. In the Value or Points To (or similar) text box, type ghs.google.com.
10. If the screen shows a TTL (or similar) text box or drop-down list, set
TTL to the default value (usually 1 Hour) and click OK.
You are taken back to the main CNAME records screen, where you can
make additional changes.
11. Repeat Steps 6 through 10 for each custom domain that you change in
Steps 1 through 5.
Enabling and Disabling 
Apps and Services
When you sign up for Google Apps, all the basic apps are active by default. On
the Dashboard, these appear as Start Page, Chat, Web Pages, Email, Calendar,
and Docs. If any of these services don’t appear in the Dashboard, click the Add
More Services link to the right of Service Settings, as shown in Figure 17-3.
Figure 17-3:
Click the
Add More
Services link
to enable
more apps.
316
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

In the Add More Services screen that appears, you can select which apps you
want to add, as shown in Figure 17-4. Click the Add It Now button below a ser-
vice to make that service active.
If you want to extend your Google Apps experience, click the See More Services
from Our Partners link to find additional services, such as Google Apps
setup, Gmail backup, or advanced Calendar tools. Unlike with the basic 
apps, you have to pay an additional monthly fee to use most of these add-on
services.
Tuning Gmail and Talk
Gmail is a very robust platform and provides you with a lot of control over
your users and settings. Of course, to take advantage of the really cool tools,
such as an e-mail gateway, you need to use Premier Edition or Education
Edition.
Standard Edition Gmail settings
For Google Apps Standard Edition, Gmail settings are pretty basic. You can
access these settings by clicking the Email link on the Dashboard (see Figure
17-5). Note: If you’re using Premier Edition or Education Edition, skip to the
following section because your settings are completely different.
Figure 17-4:
Choose an
app and
click the

Chapter 17: Tweaking Your Apps

Here’s a description of what each setting does:
 Web Address: Click the Change URL link to create a custom address. See
the “Creating Custom Apps Addresses” section, earlier in this chapter,
for more information.
 Catch-all Address: Sometimes, messages sent to your domain have an
incorrect username (either because that user doesn’t exist or because the
sender mistyped the username). A catch-all address can receive all these
messages so that you or someone at your organization can review them
and respond, as needed. Or you can choose to discard all messages sent
to a non-existent or incorrect user, never giving those messages a second
thought.
 Email Activation: Click the Instructions on How to Activate Email link to
begin the activation process. We describe the process in the “Activating
e-mail and configuring MX records” section, later in this chapter.
 Disable Service: If you decide that Gmail just isn’t for you or your
group, click the Disable Email link. A new screen appears asking if you
are sure you want to disable e-mail. Click the Yes, Disable Email button
to confirm that you want to remove Gmail. You can always add it back
later by clicking the Add More Services link on the main Dashboard
screen and clicking the Add It Now button below the Email service on
the screen that appears.
If you make any changes to your Gmail settings, be sure to click the Save
Changes button at the bottom of the screen.

Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

Premier Edition and Education 
Edition Gmail settings
One of the key differences between Google Apps Standard Edition and both
Premier Edition and Education Edition has to do with e-mail. Premier Edition
and Education Edition allow you to add compliance and archiving, as well as
enable certain e-mail types to always pass through the spam filter.
From the Dashboard, click Email. A screen similar to Figure 17-6 appears. The
options available on this screen are described in the following list:
 Web Address: Click the Change URL link to create a custom address. See
the “Creating Custom Apps Addresses” section, earlier in this chapter,
for more information.
 Email Gateway: This option allows you to route your outgoing e-mail to
another server. You generally use this option for archiving, filtering,
monitoring, and/or compliance. To find out how to set up this option,
click the Learn More link or click the Help link in the top-right corner of
the screen and search for Email gateway in the Help Center.
 Email Whitelist: If you know that your users will be receiving some
important e-mails from another outside server, you can add that server’s
Figure 17-6:

Chapter 17: Tweaking Your Apps

IP address (such as 64.233.167.99) to the Email Whitelist text box so that
Google never marks mail from that server as spam.
 Email Activation: Click this link to begin the activation process. We
describe this process in the following section.
 Email Routing: This tool allows you to reroute messages to your server
or to a catch-all address that you establish for messages sent to a user
who doesn’t exist. Click the Learn More link to see a description of how
to adjust these settings and discover the different destinations and set-
tings that you can choose.
 Disable service: Click the Disable Email button to turn Gmail off and dis-
able the service. Simple as that.
Activating e-mail and configuring 
MX records
You need to follow two steps to activate e-mail for your domain. First, create
users in Google Apps. If you’re switching from another service, make sure
that you create user accounts to match the ones that already exist on your
other service. If you’re unsure how to create users, flip back to Chapter 14.
The second step requires you to configure your MX records through your
domain registrar.
You can still test Gmail before activating the service and switching your MX
records. Users can access temporary e-mail messages by logging into your
domain’s custom Gmail Web address. Until you change the MX records, they
can receive messages sent to a temporary Gmail address that looks like this:
user@yourdomain.com.test-google-a.com.
When you’re ready to change your MX record to point to Gmail, and allow users
to begin receiving messages sent to their normal address (user@yourdomain.
com) in Gmail, grab your registrar login information and complete the follow-
ing steps:
1. Log into your domain registrar’s Web site, using the login name and
password that you used to register the domain.
2. Open the page in which you can make changes to your MX records.
In most cases, you can make these changes in a section called DNS
Management or Mail Server Configuration. If you don’t see any section
with this kind of name, call your registrar for help.
320
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

3. Delete any MX records that already exist.
Deleting all records prevents any conflicts that might arise later.
4. Create an MX record for each value that you see in Table 17-2.
Be sure to include the period (.) at the end of each server address.
Depending on your registrar, you may have to enter different priority
values (such as 1,3,3,5,5,5,5) instead of those that appear in the table
below. Just make sure that the order stays the same.
5. Set any TTL values to their maximum.
Table 17-2
MX Record Values

6. Save any changes that you make.
Although most changes take effect fairly quickly, you may have to wait
up to 24 hours for the settings to take effect and to begin receiving
e-mail at your new address.
For more detailed, registrar-specific instructions, click the Email link on the
Dashboard. The Email Settings screen appears. Click the Instructions on How
to Activate Email link, and then click the Change MX Records link at the
bottom of the screen. Select your registrar from the drop-down list. If your
domain registrar doesn’t appear in the list, select Any Hosting Company.
Using Gmail tools
From the Dashboard, click the Email link in the Service Settings section to
access additional tools for creating group mailing lists, exporting users to a
321
Chapter 17: Tweaking Your Apps

spreadsheet file for analysis of quotas, adding first and last login times, and
so on. Click the Email Addresses tab to see a list of all the addresses and lists
associated with your domain. Click any address to view that user’s account
information or click any list to see who’s in that list. Here are a couple other
options that you can access from this page:
 Create a New Email List. Click this link to easily create group mailing
lists, as shown in Figure 17-7. Click in the Choose a Name for the New
Email List text box and enter a name for the list. Then, click in the Add a
Recipient text box, type the username of a user whom you want to add
to the list, and click the Add Recipient button. If you want to add a lot of
users to your list, you can click the Add Everyone in My Domain button
and then remove those users you don’t want to add.
To remove users from a list, first click the list address on the Email
Addresses screen. Select the check box beside the user’s name, as
shown in Figure 17-8, and then click the Remove from This List button.
When you add Google Apps users to a list, you have to type only their
usernames, as shown in Figure 17-8. If you want to add users from out-
side your domain, type their full e-mail addresses. Also, you can click a
user in the list to view that user’s account information.
 Download User List as CSV. Click this link (located at the bottom of the
screen) to save a spreadsheet filled with all your users’ usernames, first
and last names, quota (how much space the users’ e-mail messages use),
and first and last login dates. (Sorry, you don’t get any passwords in this
spreadsheet.) You may find this spreadsheet helpful when you want to
analyze how your users take advantage of Google Apps.

Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

Migrating existing e-mail accounts
For users of Google Apps Premier Edition or Education Edition, Google pro-
vides tools to help move e-mail messages from your existing non-Google e-mail
system to Google Apps. For more in-depth information on how to move your
messages to Google Apps, click the Advanced Tools tab on the Navigation bar
in the Dashboard, and then click the Learn More link in the Email Migration
section.
You must first create Google Apps user accounts for everyone whose mail
you want to migrate. For larger organizations, such as schools, you can most
easily create a bunch of accounts by creating a CSV file that contains all your
users’ information and uploading it. Chapter 14 covers the steps you need to
follow to create the CSV file and upload it.
To move your e-mail messages from your old server to Gmail, your old server
must allow IMAP access. Only a few e-mail server platforms are officially sup-
ported by Google. If your server doesn’t appear in the migration list found by
clicking the Learn More link, you can still try to migrate your accounts, but
you must search the Help Center or Google Groups for answers if you run
into problems.
After you create the CSV file and upload it (as described in Chapter 14),
follow these steps to migrate your e-mail accounts:
Figure 17-8:
You can add
or remove
users to 
a list at 
any time.
323
Chapter 17: Tweaking Your Apps

1. From the Dashboard, click the Advanced Tools tab on the Navigation
bar, and then click the Set Up Mail (IMAP) Migration link in the Email
Migration section.
A screen similar to Figure 17-9 appears.
2. Select the Add New Server Connection radio button, and enter your
server settings in the form that appears in the Establish Server
Connection screen.
3. Click the Save Settings button, and then click the Continue button at
the bottom of the screen.
4. On the Specify How Many Users screen that appears, select the Specify
a Few User Accounts radio button to test individual users or select the
Specify Many User Accounts Via File Upload radio button to upload a
list of users; click the Continue button.
On the next screen, you need to provide a Google Apps username, an old
(source) username, and an old (source) password for each user.
If you select the Specify Many User Accounts Via File Upload option to
upload a list of users, follow the instructions on the Bulk Upload Accounts
screen that appears to upload a CSV file. The spreadsheet file should
look similar to Figure 17-10.
5. After you’ve selected your spreadsheet file, click the Upload and Test
Connection button.
On the next screen, Google tests the first few users to make sure that
their e-mail messages can transfer correctly.
Figure 17-9:
Specify a
server from
which you
want to
migrate
e-mail.
324
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

6. If the Test Connection screen indicates a successful connection, and
you’re ready to begin the migration, click the Start Migration button.
If the connection fails, adjust your spreadsheet or server settings on
the previous screens and try again.
A lot of data may be transferred from your old server to the new one. We rec-
ommend that you transfer batches of users at a time, rather than the whole
tamale. Choose 10 to 50 users for each migration, and then verify that the
transfer was successful for those users by having them log in and check their
Gmail Inboxes.
Adjusting Talk settings
You can adjust your Google Talk settings from the Dashboard. Log into
Dashboard and click the Chat link to access the screen that looks like Figure
17-11. Here are the options that you can set:

Chapter 17: Tweaking Your Apps

 Download: Click the Download Google Talk link and click the Run or
Save button in the download screen that appears to download and
install the Google Talk client to your computer, or right-click the link and
choose Copy Link Location from the menu that appears and paste it into
an e-mail to other users who may want to download it.
 Sharing Options: Limit whether people outside your domain can see
your users’ chat status. If you select the Warn Users When Chatting
Outside This Domain check box, a warning appears each time a user
starts a new chat with people outside your domain. Click the Learn More
link to go to the Help Center, where you can find instructions on how to
set SRV records and allow your users to chat with other Gmail users.
 Disable Service: If Chat isn’t part of your group’s mission, or it’s more a
nuisance than a tool, turn it off by clicking the Disable Chat link and veri-
fying that you really want to do that on the next screen. (Of course, if
you change your mind about the usefulness of Chat, you can always add
it later from the Dashboard.)
Empowering Calendar
You can adjust some basic settings for Google Calendar from the Dashboard,
too. These settings are fairly nuanced, but they deal primarily with sharing
calendars outside of the domain. The Calendar app can, most importantly,
display a tool for everyone to schedule resources, such as rooms and equip-
ment. (This scheduling feature is only available for Premier Edition and
Education Edition users.)
You may need to restrict Calendar sharing in several situations — for exam-
ple, you might not want to let your top-secret meeting plans out of the bag.
Log into the Dashboard and click the Calendar link to go to the Calendar
Settings screen, as shown in Figure 17-12. The following list describes the
basic options that you can change:
 Web Address: Click the Change URL link and choose the default Google
Apps address or create a custom address on the next screen. See the
“Creating Custom Apps Addresses” section, earlier in this chapter, for
more information.
 Sharing Options: The options in this section allow you to limit who can
view your users’ calendars and how much information users can share.
326
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

Unlike other apps, with Calendar, you set the highest amount of sharing
with users outside of your domain. This way you can restrict outside
users from seeing your group’s personal meeting schedules. For users
within your domain, you can also select the default sharing options,
although users can always change their own settings if they choose.
Select the Only Free/Busy Information (Hide Event Details) radio button
to set the tightest security. Select the Share All Information, But
Outsiders Cannot Change Calendar radio button for medium security.
Finally, select the Share All Information, and Outsiders Can Change
Calendars radio button for the least restrictions on Calendar security.
 Disable Service: If you decide that Calendar just isn’t for you or your
group, click the Disable Calendar link. On the next screen, click the Yes,
Disable Calendar button to confirm that you want to remove access to
Calendar for your users. (You can always add it back later by clicking
the Add More Services link from the main Dashboard screen and clicking
the Add Service button below the Calendar module on the screen that
appears.)
If you have Premier Edition or Education Edition, Calendar enables users to
not only fill their own calendars, but also use the Room Finder to book
rooms, cars, and anything else that you (the administrator) let them.

Chapter 17: Tweaking Your Apps

To create and edit Calendar resources, follow these steps:
1. Log into the Dashboard and click the Calendar link to load the Service
Settings screen.
2. Click the Resources tab near the top of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 17-13.
3. Click the Create a New Resource link at the top of the tab to begin
adding a resource.
4. In the Create a New Resources screen that appears, click in the text
boxes and enter a name, type, and description for the resource.
5. Click the Create Resource button.
Your new resource now appears automatically in your users’ Room
Finder the next time they want to use a room, vehicle, bike, or other
available resource.
6. After you create a resource, you can edit or delete it, as follows:
• To edit a resource: Click the name of the resource in the list (see
Figure 17-13). On the Edit Resource screen that appears, click in
any of the text boxes and enter the changes you want. When you
are finished, click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the
screen to return to the Calendar Settings screen.
• To delete a resource: Select the check box for the resource in the
list (see Figure 17-13) and click one of the Delete Resource(s) but-
tons that appear at the bottom and top of the list.
As an administrator, you can view and change resource calendars from your
own Google Calendar. Simply log into your Calendar (click the Calendar link
Figure 17-13:
Create
Calendar
resources 
in the
Resources
tab.
328
Part IV: Popping the Hood: Google Apps Administration 

at the top of the screen if you want to zip to it quickly), click in the Other
Calendars text box, type the name of the resource, and press Enter. The cal-
endar (and all its scheduled events) will appear alongside your own events.
You can then edit or change any resource events or add new ones, just like
any other event (see Chapter 8 for details on adding and changing events).
All administrators can schedule blocks of time for resources, view and
change your users’ meetings (if necessary), or simply see when certain
rooms or resources are being used, as shown in Figure 17-14.
Securing Docs
Like Chat, Docs has several simple options that you can adjust. From the
Dashboard, click the Docs link to open the Docs Setting screen (as shown in
Figure 17-15), where you can view and change the settings for Docs. Here’s
what each of the settings does:

 Web Address: Click the Change URL link to open the screen that allows
you to create a custom address for Docs. (See the “Creating Custom
Apps Addresses” section, earlier in this chapter, for details on how to
change this address.)
 Sharing Options: The options in this area enable you to choose to whom
your users can send document links for sharing. If your users generally
work on sensitive information, you should probably select either the
Users Cannot Share Documents Outside This Domain radio button or the
Users Can Share Documents Outside This Domain, But Will Receive a
Warning Each Time radio button. (When you select that option, at least
they know what they’re doing before they send a trade secret to a
double agent.) If you want your users to be able to freely share docu-
ments (and you know it doesn’t pose a security threat), select the Users
Can Share Documents Outside This Domain (Without Any Warning)
radio button.
 Disable Service: Click the Disable Docs link and click the Yes, Disable
Docs button on the next screen to take access to Google Docs away from
everyone. Think of this as a self-destruct button. (You can always give
Docs back to your users later by clicking the Add More Services link
from the main Dashboard screen and clicking the Add It Now button
below the Docs service.)

included ten great tips to help you get out of a variety of
Google-related technical jams. And we show you where 
to go for help if you ever need it.
We end this part by giving you ten more Google Apps for

Chapter 18
Ten Solutions to Common
Problems
In This Chapter
 Solving general Google Apps issues
 Making Gmail work
 Troubleshooting Chat and Talk
 Fixing a broken Calendar
 Helping Docs behave
A
s ideal and wonderful as the Internet and Google Apps are, sometimes
they don’t work exactly right. After all, if everything worked perfectly all
the time, no one would need brilliant Googlers, authors of For Dummies
books, or techno-nerds.
In this chapter, we help you find solutions to some of the common headaches
that you may encounter when you use Google Apps.
Before we delve into the nitty gritty, we want to point out some great places
to find help with your Google Apps:
 Help Center: Google provides a Help Center full of solutions. To access
the Help Center, click the Help link in the top-right corner of any Google
Apps window.
 Google Groups: Other users just like you have come across all kinds of
problems with Google Apps, and they can help you find answers to your
own. Do a quick search by entering keywords in the Search text box in
the top-right corner of the screen and click the Search This Group button
to see whether someone else has already fixed a similar problem; or
select a problem category and click the Post Your Question button to

the right of the topic area, join the group on the screen that appears,
enter your specific problem in the Message text box, and click the Post
Message button to post your question. Other users usually post responses
to your question with helpful suggestions in no time flat. For more tech-
nical solutions, Googlers (Google employees) are on the scene, too. Just
look for the blue G badge to the right of the moderator’s name right
below a topic link.
 Premier Support: Organizations that have Google Apps Premier accounts
receive extra help for big issues. Administrators can locate the Google
telephone support number (and customer PIN) in the Dashboard. Log
into the Dashboard, click the Domain Settings tab on the Navigation bar,
and then click the Account Information link. On the Account Information
tab that appears, you can find links to the Help Center and e-mail sup-
port, as well as the telephone support info.
Oops! Errors in Google Apps
When you try to log into Google Apps, if Google displays an error message,
don’t panic. You get this kind of error message when Google is updating a
server or making some other changes. You can’t do anything directly to fix
the problem, so here are our best suggestions for what you can do to get
things working again:
 Wait a few minutes, and then try again. The error generally goes away
within five to ten minutes. Take a quick coffee break, and you can proba-
bly get back to work when you return.
 Notify your administrator if errors persist. In the rare case that the
error doesn’t go away in a few minutes, tell your administrator or sup-
port team. They can look into it and call Google, if they need to.
Can’t Log Into Google Apps
We know it’s frustrating to try to log in and get nowhere. It’s happened to 
us, too. (We’re not talking about not being able to log in because you forgot
your password in this section, though that happens to everyone at some
point.) If you can’t log in, and you’ve checked with the powers that be to
make sure you’re using the correct username and password, give these sug-
gestions a try:
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Try a different browser. For example, if you’re using Firefox, try
Internet Explorer or Safari.
 Clear the browser cache. Whenever you visit a Web page, a copy of the
page is saved to your browser cache so that it loads faster the next time
you visit. Sometimes, the cache file gets corrupted and causes your
Google Apps to not function properly. Clearing the browser cache gives
the App a chance to load again and usually fixes the problem.
Follow these steps to clear the browser cache in Internet Explorer 7:
1. Choose Tools➪Internet Options.
The Internet Options dialog box appears.
2. Select the General tab and click the Delete button in the Browsing
History section.
3. In the dialog box that appears, click the Delete Files button to clear
your temporary Internet files.
4. For an extra measure of goodness (and to be sure that your cache is
really cleared), close Internet Explorer completely and reopen it.
Follow these steps to clear the browser cache in Firefox:
1. Choose Tools➪Clear Private Data.
2. Make sure that the Cache check box is selected, and then click the
Clear Private Data Now button.
3. For an extra measure of goodness (and to be sure that your cache is
really cleared), close Firefox completely and reopen it.
Follow these steps to clear the browser cache in Safari:
1. Choose Edit➪Empty Cache.
2. In the dialog box that appears, click the Empty button.
 Configure third-party software. Occasionally, some software on your
computer conflicts with your Internet connection. Check your firewall or
antivirus software (you may have to call that software’s support people)
and disable it, if necessary.
POP/IMAP Doesn’t Work 
Correctly for Gmail
The number-one issue for Google users deals with getting POP/IMAP access to
work with Outlook. E-mail clients work differently and are more complicated

than Web browsers. Here are five tips for getting your Outlook program back
up and running with your Gmail account:
 Enable POP/IMAP access in Gmail settings. Click the Settings link at 
the top-right corner of the Gmail main screen. In the Settings page that
appears, click the Forwarding and POP/IMAP link. Make sure that the
Enable POP or Enable IMAP radio button is selected in the POP Download
or IMAP Access section, respectively. Click the Save Changes button
after you make any changes.
 Check client configuration. Generally, POP and IMAP don’t work if you
don’t set the correct port and select the Use SSL check box. To check
your client configuration in Outlook, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Account Settings.
The Account Settings dialog box appears.
2. Highlight your e-mail account and click the Change button.
The Change E-Mail Account dialog box appears.
3. Click the More Settings button.
4. In the Internet E-mail Settings dialog box, click the Advanced tab.
If you get errors when trying to send messages, make sure SMTP is
set to 465 or 25.
 Run the POP Troubleshooter Tool. This tool works on Windows. It
helps you pinpoint the exact problem and provides instructions to solve
that problem. Go to http://mail.google.com/support/bin/
answer.py?answer=44769 and click the Download the Gmail POP
Troubleshooter link. Run the tool and it tells you what the problem is.
 Use IMAP, rather than POP, when you access your Gmail from more
than one computer. If you’re using multiple computers, IMAP works
better because it syncs your messages — POP only downloads them.
When you use POP on multiple computers, the most recent messages
download only to the last computer that accessed them.
Can’t Send Attachments in Gmail
When you try to send files to other people, Google may not allow the file 
type (see the section about opening attachments in Chapter 5), or your Web
browser may be hanging on to some corrupted cache files. To fix issues with
attachments, take the following suggestions to heart:
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Don’t send programs or .exe files. To keep your files safe from viruses
and other bad stuff on the Internet, Google automatically restricts pro-
grams and executable (.exe) files, even if they’re hidden away in Zip
files. You should have no trouble sending documents, photos, movies, or
Zip files (as long as the Zip files don’t contain programs or executable
files, of course).
 Clear the browser cache. If the browser cache gets corrupted, the
attachment function may not work properly in Gmail. See the “Can’t Log
Into Google Apps” section, earlier in this chapter, for instructions on
how to clear the browser cache.
 Try a different interface. At the bottom of the Gmail Inbox screen, click
the Basic HTML link to reload a simple version of your Inbox and try
sending your attachment(s) again from the Compose Mail screen. This
approach works especially well if you’re using a nontraditional browser,
such as Opera.
Chat Disappears in Gmail
Chat usually doesn’t work in Gmail if you’re not using a supported Web
browser (search the Help Center for supported browsers). Try accessing Gmail
in Internet Explorer or Firefox to see whether Chat appears. If you still don’t
see Chat, scroll to the bottom of your Gmail page. Click the Standard link to
the right of Gmail View at the bottom of the screen. Your fully featured Inbox
will reload. If the Standard link is selected and Chat still doesn’t appear, look
for the Turn On Chat link at the bottom of the screen. Click that link to re-
enable Chat. If none of these solutions work, click the Help link at the top-
right corner of the Gmail page and search the Help Center that appears for
more options.
Voice Chat Doesn’t Work
After you install Google Talk on your computer, voice communication may
not work the first time you use it or if you change your audio equipment or
settings. When audio is being sent and received, you should see the blue
audio bars at the top of the call window moving up and down. If you or your
buddy can’t hear the other, try the following fixes:
 Make sure your system sound settings are correct. Use your system’s
control panel to check that your microphone and speakers are enabled,
337
Chapter 18: Ten Solutions to Common Problems

and that the volume is high enough. Also, check to make sure that
you’ve attached your microphone properly.
 Check your Google Talk sound settings. Open Talk and click the
Settings link in the top-right corner of the window. From the list on the
left side of the Settings screen that appears, click Audio, then make sure
that the correct microphone and speakers are selected on the right.
If neither solution works, click the Help link on the main Google Talk window
and search the Google Help Center.
Everything Looks Garbled in Calendar
Like Gmail, Calendar can run into issues from time to time. It may not load
correctly, or you may find an event missing once in a while.
When Calendar doesn’t load, partially loads, or shows strange characters, try
the following solutions (one is bound to make Calendar work properly again):
 Clear the browser cache. You can clear the cache as a general fixer-
upper. See the “Can’t Log Into Google Apps” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, if you don’t know how to clear your browser cache.
 Try using a secure connection. Look at your Web address in your
browser’s address bar. Where it says http://, change it to https://
(the s is for secure) and press Enter.
 Contact your administrator. Tell your administrator that Calendar isn’t
working. If the other solutions in this list don’t work, other people in
your organization are probably having the same problem. Your adminis-
trator can check the Internet connection or contact Google for some
extra help.
If these fixes don’t work, click the Help link in the top-right corner of the
Calendar screen to open the Google Help Center.
Events Don’t Show Up in Calendar
Here’s one of the worst feelings: You know that you have a meeting this morn-
ing with some very important people, and when you check Calendar, the
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

meeting’s not there! Aaaaaaaahhhhh! Before you panic, try these suggestions
(they may help you find those previously existing events, after all):
 Check the Calendars list. Make sure your calendar is selected in your
Calendars list on the left side of your main Calendar screen. Deselected
calendars don’t appear on the main calendar.
 Check with the event creator. If you received an invitation to an event
that you can no longer find on your calendar, check with the creator of
the event. He or she may have deleted or changed the event — or
removed you from the guest list without notifying you.
Documents, Spreadsheets, or
Presentations Don’t Appear 
in Docs Home
Google Docs are very near and dear to our hearts. So, when they don’t work
exactly right, it makes us a little sad. Whether documents, spreadsheets, or
presentations disappear or don’t load properly, we do our best to restore
your Docs Home bliss in this section. (You can also consult the Google Help
Center to find answers to more technical problems.)
When files don’t appear in Docs Home, it’s a similar issue to when events
don’t appear in Calendar (see the preceding section). Documents, spread-
sheets, and presentations that you’ve created should appear in Docs Home
just fine. If you don’t see some files in Docs Home that you know should be
there, try these fixes:
 Click the Hidden and Trash labels in the list on the left of Docs Home.
If you hid or deleted the file, you should find it under one of these labels.
 Search for the file. If the file hasn’t been permanently deleted, you
should find it using the Google Docs Search box and searching for any
words that you know appear in the document’s, spreadsheet’s, or pre-
sentation’s name or within the file.
 If someone else shared the file with you, check with that person to
make sure that they didn’t remove you from the Share list. If they did,
they can add your name to the list again to make the missing file reap-
pear magically in the blink of an eye.
339
Chapter 18: Ten Solutions to Common Problems

Documents Don’t Load Properly
This problem’s a little tricky. Not because it’s technical, but because Google
Apps deals with different types of files. Documents, spreadsheets, and pre-
sentations that you create directly in Google Docs should have no problems.
If they do, follow the steps in the “Everything Looks Garbled in Calendar” 
section, earlier in this chapter.
If, however, the files were created in Microsoft Office, OpenOffice, or another
program, the conversion of certain elements in the file may fail and those ele-
ments may not appear correctly — especially if the file contains advanced
formatting and graphics options, such as borders. If the file doesn’t import
correctly the first time, remove some of the special formatting and try to
import the file again in Docs, Spreadsheets, or Presentations. Like with any
conversion process, YMMV (your mileage may vary).

W
e know that Google Apps is going to make your organization more effi-
cient, streamlined, and hip. And just because you’re using the four
basic Google Apps (Gmail, Calendar, Talk, and Docs) doesn’t mean you have
to stop there. After all, you can find numerous other free Google Apps and
services that can help make your life easier.
So, before we send you off to get your work done, we want to take a moment
to tell you about some of our favorite Google products. We can’t list them all
in this chapter, and Google is adding new ones all the time. For a complete
list, go to www.google.com/options — and if you’re extra adventurous,
see what’s bubbling in Google Labs at www.google.com/labs.
In no particular order of importance, we present our favorite other Google Apps.
1-800-GOOG-411
This app has nothing to do with the Internet — at least, not directly. Google
offers free phone directory assistance for local businesses. Call this number
(1-800-GOOG-411), and Google not only lists the most relevant businesses
that you are looking for, but sends you an SMS text message with the listing
you want and connects you to the company you choose for free. You’ll be

amazed at how good the service is. Here are the key prompts and voice com-
mands, in order:
 What city and state? Say the city and state about which you want to find
information, such as “Duluth, Minnesota.”
 What business name or category? Say the name of the business that
you’re looking for, such as “Dentist” or “John Smith.”
 Say, “Number X”: Listen to the list of results. When you hear the busi-
ness that you want more information on, say the corresponding number.
You don’t have to wait until the list ends. Google connects you automati-
cally, or you can say one of these commands:
• “Details”: Listen to the full address and phone number of the busi-
ness. It repeats the information twice, so you can make sure your
pen is working correctly.
• “Text message”: If you’re using a mobile phone, say this command
to receive a text message with the address and phone number of
the business.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Creating a Google account
To use most Google services, you need a Google
account. A Google account is different than
your Google Apps account, but you can use
your Google Apps e-mail address to sign up for
a Google account and add some of the addi-
tional features that we talk about in this chapter.
Sign up for a Google account by following these
steps:
1. In your Web browser, go to www.google.
com/accounts.
2. Click the Create a New Account link (it
may also appear as Create an Account
Now) on the right side of the screen.
The Create an Account screen appears.
3. Enter your Google Apps e-mail address in
the Your Current Email Address text box,
then type your password in the Choose 
a Password and Re-enter Password text
boxes.
4. Choose your country from the Location
drop-down list.
5. Enter the characters that appear in the word
verification image in the text box below.
6. When you’re ready, click the I Accept.
Create My Account button.
At this point, you need to verify your e-mail
address. Log into your Google Apps Gmail
account and open the message that has the sub-
ject line “Google Email Verification.” Click the link
inside this message to activate your Google
account. Now, you can use the other apps listed
in this chapter for your personal edu-tainment.
Warning: Your Google account is still separate
from your Google Apps account. If you change
your Google Apps password and want your
Google account password to be the same, 
you have to return to www.google.com/
accounts and change your Google account
password, as well.

 Say, “Go back”: Return to the previous prompt.
 Say, “Start over”: Begin your search again with the city and state.
AdWords
http://adwords.google.com
What better way can you get your message out there than to advertise on
Google? With AdWords, you can quickly and easily set up an account and
decide how much you want to pay for advertising. It’s a cost-per-click 
service, so you decide how many times your ad appears and can be clicked.
You’re in control of how much you pay.
Visit www.google.com/businesseducators to download a free handbook
and discover more about advertising with Google.
AdSense
http://adsense.google.com
AdSense is Google’s way of renting space on your Web site for advertise-
ments. You have control over the advertisement categories that appear as
well as the color scheme. Every time your visitors click a link, you make
money. It’s as simple as that!
Follow the tutorial on http://adsense.google.com to set up your
account and begin making easy money.
Google Notebook
http://google.com/notebook
We love this tool. Notebook lets you take notes in your Web browser and
keep them online and accessible from anywhere. Copy snippets of Web pages
(including tables and images), make to-do lists, and more. For added conve-
nience, you can also download the Notebook browser plug-in and note things
when you’re surfing the Web without having to open another window.
343
Chapter 19: Ten More Google Apps for Your Business, Group, or Organization

Google Finance
http://finance.google.com
Track your stock portfolio or follow your favorite companies from one conve-
nient place. Google Finance brings information from multiple finance and
news sites, and places them in one location. Sift through financial statements,
check the historical stock prices, and watch the latest videos from the experts.
As a bonus, you can add a Google Finance gadget to your Start Page and see
how your stocks are doing while you peruse your Gmail Inbox.
Google Product Search
www.google.com/products
Looking for a printer or vintage coffee maker? Google Product Search looks
through a large selection of Internet stores so you don’t have to. Sort your
results by price, and you can find the best deal around. Adding Google
Checkout (http://checkout.google.com) to your Google account saves
time that you’d otherwise spend filling out forms, and you keep your credit
card information safe. Product Search lets you sort your results by price or
relevance, and other users like you have rated the stores, so you know what
you’re getting into.
Google Reader
www.google.com/reader
Instead of taking a lot of time to visit all your favorite news sites and blogs,
make them come to you. Google Reader helps you corral all your sources into
one place, and it automatically updates your top stories. After you log in the
first time, be sure to take the tour. Click the Add Subscription button on the
left side of the screen and a text box will appear, allowing you to search for
your favorite Web site feeds. Click the Subscribe button on the search results
page and you will begin receiving messages and articles right away.
Think of Reader as an inbox for the Web. Rather than messages from other
people, you get articles from other Web sites.

Google Maps
http://maps.google.com
Google Maps is intuitive and fun. Find addresses, locate businesses, or get
directions from place to place. Our favorite map views include
 Street View: Get down to street level and take a panoramic tour of major
cities, as shown in Figure 19-1. Use the plus and minus buttons to zoom
in close, and then drag the little yellow man onto an outlined street to
see what passersby see on their way to work.
 Traffic: Google taps into several traffic monitoring sources to give you
current traffic conditions. Green is good, red is bad. Google even takes
into account bad traffic when giving you directions to your destination.
 Map: Quickly find your way around with the default map view. Search
the map for local businesses, get directions from one place to another,
print out your maps, or e-mail them to your friends.
 Satellite: See a bird’s-eye view of your local shopping center or historic
statue. When you click the Satellite button, you can also check the Show
Labels box to see street names on the map.
 Terrain: See the world in topographical form, including all the nooks
and crannies of the Grand Canyon or your ski resort.

Don’t forget to check out the My Maps tab to add your own points of interest,
draw borders, and shade in areas.
Google Pack
http://pack.google.com
Google Pack brings together all the free software that you need (and none
that you don’t) in one easy-to-use installer. These programs include Web
tools, Internet security programs, and other productivity software. Pack even
keeps your software up to date automatically. Here are our favorite Google
Pack programs:
 Google Earth: Take Google Maps to the next level with a 3D atlas of the
world. Zoom into famous landmarks, search for your house, see commu-
nity photos of places, and globetrot without leaving your home.
 Google Desktop: Add Google Search to your computer desktop. Google
Desktop helps you quickly find documents, images, and music on your
computer as easily as you find pages on the Internet.
 Picasa: Organize and edit your photos with simple yet powerful tools.
Picasa also has an online counterpart called Picasa Web Albums
(http://picasaweb.google.com), which lets you post your photos
into your own online gallery with one click.
 StarOffice: For documents that need a little more oomph than Google
Docs provides, try this free alternative to Microsoft Office. It includes all
the tools that you need to create documents, spreadsheets, presenta-
tions, drawings, and databases.
The Google Installer will notify you of program updates. Check back from time
to time for more programs by returning to http://pack.google.com.
Google Translate
http://translate.google.com
Get yourself out of a pinch by using Google Translate. With support for over
20 languages and the ability to translate entire Web sites in a single bound,
Translate saves the day time and again. Go to http://translate.google.
com and click one of the tabs along the top. Here’s how they work:
 Text and Web: Enter a word, phrase, or paragraph in the Original Text
text box at the top of the page or enter a Web address in the Translate a
Web Page text box at the bottom of the page; use the drop-down list to
346
Part V: The Part of Tens 

select the language combination that you want to translate from/to; then
click the Translate button. In a moment, a translation appears on the right
side of the screen. Web pages load in their entirety in the same window.
Google Translate, like other automated translation services, can do a
decent job of translating basic text. However, many times, you get a
quite literal and not very accurate translation, which can be funny or
just plain confusing. If you need to translate an important document,
make sure you have a native speaker read through the translation before
you send the document. (You don’t want to inadvertently insult some-
one with an inaccurate translation.)
 Translated Search: Google Translate can help you find a search term in
Web pages that are written in a language other than English. See Figure
19-2 for an example.
 Dictionary: Use this language translation dictionary when you’re
stumped by a foreign word you have come across. Enter a word in the
Enter Word text box, choose a language translation in the drop-down list
to the right, and the foreign language equivalent appears.
 Tools: Add a Google Translate gadget to your Web page so that your visi-
tors can translate your page in a flash. Simply choose your page’s lan-
guage and then copy the HTML code that appears in the box below Step
2 into your page. If you translate pages often, make life simple — add
one of the translate buttons listed at the bottom of the screen to your
browser’s toolbar by clicking the link and dragging it to your browser’s
bookmarks or favorites bar. Then, when you visit a site, simply click the
button to translate the page instantly.
