PREFACE
This book is intended to provide an introduction to those parts of Astronomy 
which require dynamical treatment. To cover the whole of this wide sub­
ject, even in a preliminary way, within the limits of a single volume of 
moderate size would be manifestly impossible. Thus the treatment of bodies 
of definite shape and of deformable bodies is entirely excluded, and hence no 
reference will be found to problems of geodesy or the many aspects of tidal 
theory. Already the study of stellar motions is bringing the methods of 
statistical mechanics into use for astronomical purposes, but this development 
is both too recent and too distinct in its subject-matter to find a place here.
Nevertheless the book covers a wider range of subject than has been 
usual in works of the kind. Thereby two advantages may be gained. For 
the reader is spared the repetition of very much the same introductory matter 
which would be necessary if the different branches of the subject were taken 
up separately. But in the second place, and this is more important, he will 
see these branches in due relation to one another and will realize better that 
he is dealing not with several distinct problems but with different parts of 
what is essentially a single probleYn. In an introductory work it therefore 
seemed desirable to make the scope as wide as was compatible with a reason­
able unity of method, the more so on account of the almost complete absence 
of similar works in the English language.
The first six chapters are devoted to preliminary matters, chiefly connected 
with the undisturbed motion of .two bodies. These are followed by five 
chapters VII to XI dealing with the determination of orbits. This section is 
intended to familiarize the reader with the properties of undisturbed motion 
by explaining in general terms the most important and interesting applica­
tions. It is in no sense complete and is not intended to replace those works 
which are entirely devoted to this subject. Otherwise it would have been 
necessary to describe in detail such admirably effective methods as Professor 
Leuschner’s and to include fully worked numerical examples. Here, as else­
where, the aim has been to give such an account of principles as will be

vi 
Preface
instructive to the reader whose studies in this branch go no further, and at 
the same time one which will help the student to understand more easily 
the technical details to be met with in more special treatises. Though the 
actual details of practical computation are entirely excluded, the fact that all 
such methods end in numerical application has by no means been overlooked. 
A distinct effort has been made to leave no formulae in a shape unsuitable 
for translation into numbers. The student who feels the need will have no 
difficulty in finding forms of computation in other works. At the same time 
the reader who will take the trouble to work out such forms for himself will 
be rewarded with a much truer mastery of the subject, though he should not 
disdain what is to be learnt from the tradition of practical computers.
An outline of the Planetary Theory is given in the seven chapters XII to 
XVIII. The first of these deals exclusively with the abstract dynamical 
principles which are subsequently employed. It is hoped that this synopsis 
will prove useful in avoiding the necessity for frequent reference to works on 
theoretical mechanics. The reader to whom the methods are unfamiliar and 
who wishes to become more fully acquainted with them may be referred to 
Professor Whittaker’s Analytical Dynamics, where he will also find an intro­
duction to those more purely theoretical aspects of the Problem of Three 
Bodies which find no place here. To those who are familiar with these 
principles in their abstract form only the concrete applications in the follow­
ing chapters may prove interesting. A chapter on special perturbations is 
included. Here, as in the determination of orbits, the need for numerical 
examples may be felt. To have inserted' them would have interfered too 
much with the general plan of the book, and they will be found in the more 
special treatises. But it was felt that the subject could not be omitted 
altogether, and a concise and fairly complete account of the theory has there­
fore been given. It may seem curious that with the development of 
analytical resources the need for these mechanical methods becomes greater 
rather than less, but so it is.
Chapter XIX on the restricted problem of three bodies is intended as an 
introduction to the Lunar Theory contained in Chapters XX and XXI. The 
division of these two chapters is partly arbitrary, for the sake of preserving a 
fair uniformity of length, but it coincides roughly with the distinction 
between Hill’s researches and the subsequent development by Professor 
Brown. In the second a low order of approximation is worked out, and it is 
hoped that this will serve to some extent the double purpose of making the 

Preface 
vii
whole method clearer and of pointing out the nature of the principal terms, 
which are apt to be entirely hidden by the complicated machinery of the 
systematic development.
The rotation of the Earth and Moon is discussed in Chapters XXII and 
XXIII. The treatment of precession and nutation is meant to be simple 
and practical, and the opportunity is taken to add an account of the astro­
nomical methods of reckoning time in actual use. In the final chapter of the 
book the theory of the ordinary methods of numerical calculation is explained. 
This is necessary for the proper understanding of Chapter XVIII, but it also 
bears on various points which occur elsewhere. Numerical applications find 
no place in this work. But let the mathematical reader be under no mis­
apprehension. The ultimate aim of all theory in Astronomy is seldom 
attained without comparison with the results of observation, and the medium 
of comparison is numerical. Hence few parts of the theory can be regarded 
as complete till they are reduced to a numerical form. This is a process 
which often demands immense labour and in itself a quite special kind of 
skill. It is just as essential as the manipulation of analytical forms.
Originality in the wider sense is not to be expected and indeed would 
defeat the object of the book, which aims at making it easier for the student 
to read with profit the larger and more technical treatises and to proceed 
to the original memoirs. A certain freshness in the manner of treatment is 
possible and, it is hoped, will not be found altogether wanting. Few direct 
references have been given as a guide to further reading, and this may be 
regretted. But the opinion may be expressed that for the reader who is 
qualified to profit by a work like the present, and who wishes to go further, 
the time has come when he should acquire, if he has not done so already, the 
faculty of consulting the library for what he wants without an apparatus of 
special directions. Sign-posts have their uses, and the experienced traveller 
is the last to despise them, but they are not conducive to a spirit of original 
adventure.
Since the main object in view has been to cover a wide extent of ground 
in a tolerably adequate way rather than to delay over’ critical details, the 
absence of mathematical rigour may sometimes be noticed. Very little 
attention is given to such questions as the convergence of series. It is not 
to be inferred that these points are unimportant or that the modern astronomer 
can afford to disregard them. But apart from a few simple cases where the 

viii 
Preface
reader will either be able to supply what is necessary for himself, or would 
not benefit even if a critical discussion were added, such questions are 
extremely difficult and have not always found a solution as yet. It is pre­
cisely one of the aims of this book to increase the number of those who can 
appreciate this side of the subject and will contribute to its elucidation.
The reader who wishes to proceed further in any parts of the subject to 
which he is introduced in this book will soon find that the number of 
systematic treatises available in all languages is by no means large. He 
must turn at an early stage to the study of original memoirs. It is not 
difficult to find assistance in such sources as the articles in the Encyklopadie 
der Mathematischen Wissenschaften, which render it unnecessary to give a 
bibliography. The subject is one which has received the attention of the 
majority of the greatest mathematicians during the last two centuries and in 
which they have found a constant source of inspiration. Their works are 
generally accessible in a convenient collected form.
For the benefit" of any student who wishes to supplement his reading and 
has no means of obtaining personal advice, the following works may be 
specially mentioned:
Determination of Orbits and Special Perturbations.
1. J. Bauschinger, Bahnbestimmung der Himmelskorper.
(A source of fully worked numerical applications.)
2. Publications of the Lick Observatory, Vol. vn.
(Contains an exposition of A. O. Leuschner’s methods.)
Planetary and Lunar Theories.
3. F. Tisserand, Traiti de mecanique celeste.
(The most complete account of the classical theories.)
4. H. Po incard, Lemons de mecanique celeste.
5. 
‘ H. Poincare, Methodes nouvelles de mecanique celeste.
6. C. V. L. Charlier, Die Mechanik des Himmels.
7. E. W. Brown, An introductory treatise on the lunar theory.
(Gives full references to all the earlier work on the subject.)
The great examples of the classical methods in the form of practical 
application to the theories of the planets are to be found in the works of 
Le Verrier (Annales de I’Observatoire de Paris), Newcomb (Astronomical

Preface 
ix
Papers of the American Ephemeris) and Hill (Collected Works). The most 
suggestive developments, apart from the researches of Poincare, are contained 
in the work of H. Gyld6n (Traite analytique- des orbites absolues des huit 
planetes principales) and P. A. Hansen. All these works will repay careful 
study, but the suggestions are not to be taken in any restrictive sense.
The author of the present book has the best of reasons for acknowledging 
his debt to most of the writers mentioned above and to others who are not 
mentioned. Some of the proof sheets have been very kindly read by the 
Rev. P. J. Kirkby, D.Sc., late fellow of New College, Oxford. Acknowledge­
ment is also due to the staff of the Cambridge University Press for their 
care in the printing. It is not to be hoped, in spite of every care, that no 
errors have escaped detection, and the author will be glad to have such as 
are found brought to his notice.

CHAPTER I
THE LAW OF GRAVITATION
1. 
The foundations of dynamical Astronomy were laid by Johann Kepler 
at the beginning of the seventeenth century. His most important work, 
Astronomia Nova (De Motibus Stellae Martis), published in 1609, contains 
a profound discussion of the motion of the planet Mars, based on the obser­
vations of Tycho Brahe. In this work a real approximation to the true 
kinematical relations of the solar system is for the first time revealed. 
Kepler’s main results may be summarized thus:
(a) The heliocentric motions of the planets (i.e. their motions relative to 
the Sun) take place in fixed planes passing through the actual position of the 
Sun.
(b) The area of the sector traced by the radius vector from the Sun, 
between any two positions of a planet in its orbit, is proportional to the time 
occupied in passing from one position to the other.
(c) The form of a planetary orbit is an ellipse, of which the Sun occupies 
one focus.
These laws, which were found in the first instance to hold for the Earth 
and for Mars, apply to the individual planets. In a later work, Harmonices 
Mundi, published in 1619, another law is given which connects the motions 
of the different planets together. This is:
(d) The square of the periodic time is proportional to the cube of the 
mean distance (i.e. the semi-axis major).
These deductions from observation are given here in the order in which 
they were discovered. The third (c) is generally known as Kepler’s first law, 
the second (6) as his second law, and the fourth (d) as his third law. But the 
first statement is of equal importance. In the Ptolemaic system the “ first 
inequality ” of a planet, which represents its heliocentric motion, was assigned 
to a plane passing through the mean position of the Sun. Even in the 
Copernican system this “ mean position ” becomes the centre of the Earth’s 
orbit, not the actual eccentric position of the Sun. In consequence no 
astronomer before Kepler had succeeded in representing the latitudes of the 
planets with even tolerable success.

The Law of Gravitation 
[ch. i
2. It is undeniable that in making his discoveries Kepler was aided by 
a certain measure of good fortune. Thus his law of areas was in reality 
founded on a lucky combination of errors. In the first place it was based on 
the hypothesis of an eccentric circular orbit and was later adopted in the 
elliptic theory. In the second place Kepler supposed (a) that the time in a 
small arc was proportional to the radius vector, (6) that the time in a finite 
arc was therefore proportional to the sum of the radii vectores to all the 
points of the arc, (c) that this sum is represented by the area of the sector. 
Both (a) and (c) are erroneous, and indeed Kepler was aware that (c) was 
not strictly accurate. Mathematically expressed, the argument would appear 
thus:
hdt = rds, ht = 
= 2 (area of sector).
Both the supposed fact and the method of deduction are wrong, yet the 
result is right. But if it should be supposed that Kepler owed his success 
to good fortune it must be remembered that this fortune was simply the 
reward of unparalleled industry in exhausting the possibilities of every 
hypothesis that presented itself and in checking the value of any new principle 
by direct comparison with good observations. It must also be remarked that 
Tycho Brahe’s observations were of the proper order of accuracy for Kepler’s 
purpose, being sufficiently accurate to discriminate between true and false 
hypotheses and yet not so refined as to involve the problem in a maze of 
unmanageable detail.- Another factor in Kepler’s success was his knowledge 
of the Greek mathematicians, in particular of the works of Apollonius.
3. 
Kepler had no conception of the property of inertia and he was 
therefore unable to make any progress towards a correct dynamical view of 
planetary motion. It is interesting to analyze his results and to see what is 
implied by each of the above statements taken by itself.
According to the first statement the planets move in a field of force which 
is such that every trajectory is a plane curve. If we suppose that the 
acceleration at each point is a function of the coordinates of the point, an 
immediate deduction can be made as to the nature of the field of force. For 
let A, B be two points on a certain trajectory, and let P be a third point not 
in the plane of this curve. Then P can be joined to A and to B by plane 
trajectories. The planes in which AB, PA and PB lie meet in one point 0 
(which may be at infinity). The acceleration at A is in the plane OAB and 
also in the plane OAP. Hence it is along AO. Similarly the acceleration 
at B is along BO, and the acceleration at P is along PO. But the point 0 
is determined by the two points A and
*
 B. Therefore the acceleration at 
every point of the field is directed towards the fixed point 0, and the field of 
force is central (or parallel). Now the planes of the orbits all pass through 
the Sun. Hence the Sun is the centre of the field of force in which the 

2-5] 
The Law of Gravitation

planets move. For an analytical proof of the general theorem see Halphen 
(Comptes Bendus, lxxxiv, p. 944).
4. 
To this the second statement adds nothing with regard to the nature 
of the forces, and might indeed have been deduced from the first. For it 
tells us that
Jr2d0 -- J(xdy — ydx) = ht
the Sun being the origin of coordinates and h being a constant. By differen­
tiation we have
xy — yx = h 
or
xy —yx = 0.
Thus yfx C yfx, which proves that the acceleration is towards the Sun at 
every point, i.e. the field of force is central. Clearly the argument might be 
reversed, and the law of areas deduced from the fact that the accelerations 
are directed towards a fixed centre, which has already been obtained from the 
first statement. Both this theorem and its converse are given in Newton’s 
Principia, Book I, Props. I and u.
5. We shall now investigate the law of acceleration towards a fixed point 
under which elliptic motion is possible. In the first instance it will not be 
assumed that the fixed point is the focus of the ellipse. Apart from the 
interest of the more general result, this is the more desirable because many 
pairs of stars are known in the sky the components of which are observed to 
revolve around one another in apparent ellipses; but the plane of the motion 
being unknown it is only a matter of inference that either star is in the focus 
of the relative orbit of the other. For it is the projection of the motion on 
a plane perpendicular to the line of sight which is observed. Let then the 
ellipse
a2 b2
be described freely under an acceleration to the fixed point (f,g)- Any point 
on the ellipse can be represented by (a cos E, b sin E). The angle E which 
is known in analytical geometry as the eccentric angle is called in Astronomy 
the eccentric anomaly of the point. The accelerations being
— a sin E .E — a cos E. E2, b cos E .E — & sin E .E2 
along the two axes, we have
— 
a sin E.E — a cosE .E2 _ b cos E.E— b sin E.E2

This is an integrable form, giving immediately

where h and t0 are constants of integration. If we put h = abii,
E

a b
and this may be considered a generalized form of what is known as Kepler’s 
equation. By adding 2tt to E it is evident that %7T]n = T is the period of a 
whole revolution. Kepler’s form applies when the motion is about a focus of 
the ellipse, and can be obtained by putting f= ae, g = 0, so that
E — e sin E= n(t —10) ....... ....................(4)
This equation is of fundamental importance. The point for which E = 0 is 
the nearest point on the orbit to the attracting focus and is sometimes called 
the pericentre. The corresponding time is t0 and n is called the mean 
motion.
By (1) and (2) the components of the acceleration become

so that the total acceleration is equal to
cos E — sin .......  
where r is the distance of the point on the orbit from (f, g).
6. 
Before examining this result more closely, it may be noticed that the 
method is quite general and may be applied to any central orbit. For if the 
coordinates of a point (x, y) on the curve be expressed in terms of a' single 
parameter a, we have similarly
R = n2r
(5)
or
= yza+yzzd2 .

where x', yr... denote derivatives with respect to a, and a, a derivatives with 
respect to the time. Hence on integration,
d=-h{x'(y-g)-y'(x-f)}-1
J&dy ~ y dx) — fy + gx = h(t-10).

5-7] 
The Law of Gravitation

By taking the last integration over one revolution in a closed orbit it is 
seen that h represents twice the area divided by the periodic time. The 
components of the acceleration become
h*(xy"
 -x"f)(x-f) 
- x"y){y - g)
{y-g)~ y' -f)\3 
(y-g)~ y' -/)]3
and the total acceleration is therefore
R = h2r {x'y" - x'y) {x {y-g)~ y' (x -f)}~3
= h?r/p3p
where p is the radius of curvature at the point and p is the perpendicular 
from (f g) to the tangent at the point. This of course is the well-known 
expression for the acceleration towards the centre of attraction.
The same orbit will be described in the same periodic time under the 
central attraction R' to another point (/', g') if
R' = h?rjp3p 
that is, if
R"jR = p3r]p'3r.
This result is equivalent to Principia, Book I, Prop. VII, Cor. 3.
7. 
We now return to equation (5) which may be written
R = n2r (1 -= n2r (q0/q)3 ..................(6)
where q and q0 are the perpendiculars on the polar of (/, g) from the point 
(x, y) on the orbit and the centre of the ellipse respectively. Hence the 
ellipse represented by the general equation
ax2 + 2hxy + by2 + 2gx + 2fy + 1=0 ........................(7)
can be described under an acceleration directed towards the origin if the 
acceleration follows the law
R = m2r(1 + gx + fy)~3, wi2 = naA8/C3  ...................(8)
where A and C have their usual meaning for the conic (7). Conversely, if the 
law (8) is given, the trajectory is always a conic whatever the initial conditions 
may be. For (7) is a possible orbit, and f and g are determined by the law, 
while a, b and h are three arbitrary constants which can be chosen so as to 
satisfy'any given conditions, such as the initial velocity given in magnitude 
and direction at a particular point.
There now arises the interesting question whether any other form of law 
besides (8) exists, for which the trajectories are always conics (Bertrand’s 
problem). Let
R = m2rjf{x, y)

6 
The Law of Gravitation 
[ch. i
be such a law. Then if (7) is to be an orbit,
f(^> y) = (i+gx+fy)s
must be satisfied by the coordinates of every point on (7), i.e. this equation 
must be equivalent to (7). But (7) can be written in either of the forms
i ■^g-,'+fy = i (i - aa? - 2hxy - W
(1 + gx +fy)2 = (g2 - a) a? + 2(fg -h) xy + (f2-b)y2
and clearly in no other way which does not introduce a greater number of 
independent constants on the right-hand side. The first of these forms gives 
an expression for/(x, y) which is (like an infinite number of others) compatible 
with (7), but only under restricted conditions. For it fixes the constants a, b 
and h and leaves only / and g arbitrary; and these are not in general sufficient 
in number to satisfy the initial conditions. On the other hand, the second 
form gives an expression for the acceleration which may be written
R = mV (ax2 4- 2fixy 4- 7/) ~ 2 ............................(9)
This only requires the constants in (7) to satisfy the two relations
=fg ~ h _f2-b
“ 
7
and thus three other relations can be satisfied which are required by the 
initial conditions. Hence motion under a central acceleration given by (9) 
is always in a conic which by the two relations found touches the lines (real 
or imaginary)
ax2 4- 2fixy 4- 7/ = 0.
The laws (8) and (9) are the only ones under which a conic is always 
described in a given plane whatever the initial conditions may be. Their 
character was first established by Darboux and by Halphen (Comptes Rendus, 
lxxxiv, pp. 760, 936 and 939).
8. 
A point on a central orbit at which the motion is at right angles to 
the radius vector is called an apse.
At such a point = 0 and the radius
vector is in general either a maximum or a minimum. Since the motion is 
reversible the radius vector to an apse is an axis of symmetry in the orbit 
and the next apsidal distances on either side are equal. There can be there­
fore only two distinct apsidal distances recurring alternately and the angle 
between any two consecutive apses is constant and is called the apsidal 
angle.
The differential equation of a central orbit is known to be
d2u _ P
d^ + U'h2u2

7-9]
The, Law of Gravitation

where u=l/r and P is the force to the centre. If we write P=u2U the 
radius of a circular orbit is given by u= Ujh2. Let the circular orbit be 
slightly disturbed, so that we may write u 4- x instead of u, where u is con­
stant and x is so small that only the first power of x need be retained. Then

U' =

the equation becomes 
and the solution is

x = a cos m (0 — 0O).

The apsidal angle is therefore
K = 7r[m= tf(1 — uU'[U) * ...............................(10)
For example, if P = p,rp, U = p,u~p~2 and
K = ir (3 + p) “ K
This result is given in the Principia, Book I, Prop, xlv, Ex. 2.
9. 
Let us push the approximation further in order to see, if possible, 
under what conditions the apsidal angle remains unchanged by a higher 
order of the increment x. The equation of the disturbed circular orbit 
becomes
^+m2x = ^U"a- + lU'"^) ........................(11)
and we assume a solution
x = a0 4- «i cos m3 4- a2 cos 2m0 4- a3 cos 3m0.
If cq is of the first order, a0 and a2 must be of the second order at least, 
and it will become clear that a3 is of the third order. Hence
a? = Aa/ 4- (2aoa1 4- axa.,) cos m3 4- |a/ cos 2m0 4- cqa2 cos 3ni0
a? = fa/ cos m3 
4- ]a/ cos 3m0.
All terms of order higher than the third have been omitted and products 
of the cosines have been changed into simple cosines of the multiple angles. 
We now substitute in (11) and equate coefficients. Thus

The Law of Gravitation 
[ch. i
The last of these equations confirms the statement that u3 is of the third 
order, but will not be needed here. The first three after the elimination of 
a0 and a2 give
. flulT" 5 uU" . BITT,
U + 8 U J 1
or 
5u^"3+3^,/,(f/-t^') = 0 ............................ (12)
This equation expresses a necessary condition which must be satisfied if 
the apsidal angle is to remain constant when the displacement from a circular 
orbit is considered finite.
10. Let us consider any closed orbit to be determined by a central 
acceleration under a finite range of initial velocities. The number of apses 
in a complete orbit must be finite and (10) shows that m must be a com­
mensurable number. It must be a constant therefore, for otherwise it would 
change discontinuously as u changes continuously. Hence
m2 = 1 — uU'[U
is an equation giving the form of U, and the solution is
U = kul~m\
But if all the orbits are to be re-entrant, so that K is constant, the 
equation (12) must also be satisfied. Hence substituting the form just 
found, we have
(1 — wi2)2 + 3m4 (1 — m4) = 0 
or
2?n4 (4 — m2) (1 — m2) —■ 0.
Since K is finite, m is not zero and we have
1 — m2 = 0 or 1 — m2 = — 3 
giving
U — k or U = ku~
*
 
and
R = kfr2 or R = kr.
Thus we have Bertrand’s remarkable theorem (Convptes Rendus, lxxvii, 
p. 849) that these are the only laws, expressible as functions of the distance, 
which always give rise to closed orbits whatever the initial circumstances 
may be (within a certain range). In these two cases m. = 1 or 2 and the 
apsidal angle K = ?r or |tt.
11. 
The results obtained can now be brought together. According to 
Kepler’s law the planetary orbits are ellipses with the centre of attraction, 
the Sun, situated in one focus. The polar of the focus being the corresponding 
directrix, we have in (6) q^ — afe and 7 = r/e, so that the acceleration towards 
the Sun is
R = n2a3/r2............................ ,.............. (13)
When the centre of attraction is an arbitrary point and it is merely 
known that the orbits are ellipses, the acceleration towards the centre must

9-12] 
The Law of Gravitation 
9
follow one of the two laws expressed by (8) and (9). These are not in general 
simple functions of the distance and it is only by induction that we should 
infer from the apparent orbits of double stars that these bodies obey the law 
given by (13). But the law (8) provides a simple function of the distance, 
R = m2r, when f=g = Q, in which case the centres of all possible orbits are 
at the origin, i.e. coincide with the centre of attraction. Similarly the law (9) 
provides a simple function of the distance, R = when a = 7 and = 0. 
In this case every orbit touches the lines x2 + y2 = 0, showing that the centre 
of attraction at the origin is the focus for every path. These are the only 
two laws of central acceleration which give rise to elliptic orbits in general 
and can be expressed in simple terms of the distance. But we have also 
seen that the same restriction is imposed when it is merely required that the 
paths shall be plane closed curves of any kind. It is moreover obvious that 
the law of the direct distance, which makes the attraction of a distant body 
more effective than that of a near one, cannot be the law of nature. The 
only alternative is that the acceleration varies inversely as the square of the 
distance, and this law can therefore be based upon these simple suppositions : 
(a) the planets describe closed paths in planes passing through the Sun, 
(b) the centripetal acceleration towards the Sun, required by (a), is a simple 
function of the distance and does not become infinite when the distance is 
infinite.
12. 
We have now to consider Kepler’s law connecting the periodic times 
of the planets with their mean distances from the Sun. This states that T2 
varies as a3. But T = 27r/n, so that n2a3 is constant for all the planets. Hence 
by (13) the acceleration of each planet towards the Sun is /z/r2 where p is 
constant. The force of attraction acting on a planet is therefore m/t/r2 where 
m is the mass of the planet. And observation shows that the same form of 
law holds for the satellites of any planet, e.g. the satellites of Jupiter. , Thus 
not only does the Sun attract the planets but the planets themselves appear 
to attract their satellites in the same way. It is but natural to suppose that 
the forces of attraction in either case arise from an inherent property of matter, 
and that a stress exists between the Sun and a planet, or between a planet 
and its satellite. Action and reaction being equal and opposite, we must 
suppose the force proportional not only to the mass of the attracted body but 
equally to the mass of the attracting body. We are thus led to Newton’s law 
of gravitation that the mutual attraction between two masses m, m' at 
a distance r apart is measured by
Gnim /r2
where G is an absolute constant, independent of the masses or their distance. 
It must be noticed that the law has been arrived at from the consideration of 
cases in which the dimensions of the bodies are small in comparison with the 
distances separating them. But since the action in these cases is proportional 

10 
The Law of Gravitation 
[ch. i
to the total masses, it is to be supposed that it applies to the individual 
elements of the matter composing them. This is the true form of the law of 
universal gravitation. When it is a question of bodies whose dimensions are 
not negligible in relation to the distances of surrounding bodies, a modification 
of the simple statement must be expected. The examination of all conse­
quences of the law of gravitation, including a comparison with the results 
of observation, practically constitutes the complete function of dynamical 
Astronomy.
13. 
Since the Earth possesses only one satellite, it is impossible to verify 
Kepler’s third law in our own system. But it is of historic interest to calcu­
late from the observed motion of the Moon the acceleration towards the centre 
of the Earth which a body would have at the Earth’s surface. The Moon’s 
sidereal period is 27d 7h 43m 118’5 or 2360591’5 secs. Let a be the Moon’s 
mean distance and b the radius of the Earth. The required acceleration is
n2a3 4tt2 Za\3 ,
The ratio a/b is 60’2745 and b may be taken to be 6’378 x 108cm. The 
result of substituting these numbers is to give for the acceleration 989 cm./sec.2 
In point of fact the acceleration of a body at the Earth’s surface is in the 
mean g = 981 cm./sec.2 But the discrepancy is not surprising. The Moon 
describes its orbit not only under the attraction of the Earth but also under 
the disturbing influence of the Sun. Moreover g is a variable quantity over 
the Earth’s surface, owing to the Earth’s rotation and figure. The above 
calculation is altogether too rough to give really comparable results. But it 
suffices to show that the quantity is quite of the same order as g, and to this 
extent supports the identification of the force which retains the Moon in its 
orbit with that which in the case of terrestrial objects is known as weight. 
As stated, the point is of historical interest because it presented a difficulty 
to Newton who was long misled by adopting erroneous numerical data.
14. 
The numerical value of the constant G depends upon the units 
adopted. Its dimensions are given by
G.M2L-2 = MLT~2
or
G = M~1L2T~2.
In C.G.s. units it is the force between two particles each of 1 gramme 
placed 1 cm. apart. The first determination of the force in absolute units by 
a laboratory experiment was made by Cavendish. Several determinations 
have since been made, of which perhaps the two best, those of C. V. Boys and

INTRODUCTORY PROPOSITIONS

As we have seen, the simple facts of observation lead us to assume 
that between two particles of masses ni and m' situated at the points 
P(x, y, z) and P'(x, y, z) there exists a force Gmm'fr1, where r is the 
distance PP'. Now the direction cosines of PP' are
x — x y — y z' — z 
r ' r ’ r
and hence the components of the force acting on the particle m are

by mt at (xit yi} zt) the components of the total force are similarly

It is evident that U is the work which the system of attracting particles 
will do if the particle m is moved from its actual position by any path to 
some standard position, except for a constant; it is the potential energy of m 
due to its position relative to the attracting system. If we put 
P=G!Xmi/ri, U= — mV 
i
V is called the potential of the attracting system at the point P. When 
the potential is known it is evident that the components of the attraction 
can be easily calculated.

The case of a homogeneous spherical shell is of elementary im­
portance. Let in be the mass per unit area, a the radius and r the distance 
of the point P from the centre. If 0 is the centre of the sphere, two cones 
with semi-vertical angles </> and </> + d</>, each having its vertex at 0 and OP 
as its axis, will contain between them an annulus on the surface of the 
sphere. The potential of this annulus at P is
dV= Gm. 2ira sin </>. adc^jp 
where
p2 _ 
_|_ a2 _ 2ra cos Q
or
pdp = ra sin . d<f>
so that
dV = Gin. 2iradp/r.
. Hence
V = 27rGma (p2 — pi)/r
where p2 and pY are the values of p at the ends of the diameter through P. 
These values are
• p2 = r + a, pr = | r - a |.
If r > a, p! = r — a and p2 — = 2a ;. if r < a, pA = a — r and p2 — Pi = Ir. 
Also the whole mass of the shell is M = 47rma2. Hence when P is a point 
outside the shell
V= GM/r
or the potential and the forces derived from it are the same as if the whole 
mass of the shell were concentrated at the centre. On the other hand, when 
P is a point inside the shell,
V= GM/a
or the potential is constant and the forces derived from it are zero.
17. 
From this elementary proposition follow immediately two corollaries:
(1) 
A sphere of uniform density, or one composed of concentric strata 
of uniform density, may be treated, so far as its action at an external point 
is concerned, as equivalent to a single particle of equal mass placed at its 
centre.
'(2) For a point within such a sphere, the sphere may be divided into 
two parts by the concentric sphere passing through the point. The outer 
part is inoperative and may be ignored, while the inner may be replaced by 
a particle of equal mass situated at the centre.
The heavenly bodies are for the most part approximately spherical in 
shape, and though not uniform in density their concentric strata are in 
general fairly homogeneous. They may therefore be treated in most cases, 
as regards their action on other bodies, as simple particles.
The motion of a body within a sphere may be illustrated by the motion 
of a meteor within a spherical swarm, or of a star in a spherical cluster. If 

16-18] 
Introductory Propositions 
13
the swarm fills a sphere uniformly the mass operative at any point varies as 
the cube of the distance from the centre. Hence the effective force towards 
the centre varies directly as the distance. As another example it may be 
proved that if the density of a globular cluster varies as (1 + r2) r being the 
distance from the centre, each star moves under a central attraction vaiying 
as r (1 4- r2) ~ 1
18. 
An approximate expression can be found for the potential of a body 
of any shape at a distant point. Let the origin of coordinates, 0, be taken 
at the centre of gravity of the body and the axis of x be drawn through the 
point P, the distance OP being r. Let dm be an element of mass at the 
point (x, y, z). The corresponding element of the potential at P is

where Py, P2,... are the functions known as Legendre’s polynomials.
The first terms are easily obtained by expansion in the ordinary way, and 
we have
Hence if the expansion is not carried to terms beyond the second order,
J r \ r 2r2 J
But if A, B, 0 are the principal moments of inertia at 0, and I is the 
moment of inertia about Ox, since p2 has been written for a? 4- y2 4- z2,
A + B + 0 = ^2p2dm, I = J(p2 — x2) dm
and since 0 is the centre of gravity,
jx dm = 0.
Hence
V = — + 
+ B + C-3Z)
r 2r®
and we see that the potential of the body at P differs from the potential of a 
particle of equal total mass placed at the centre of gravity by a quantity 
depending only on 1/r3. Except in a few cases this quantity is negligible 

14 
Introductory Propositions 
[ch. ii
in astronomical problems not only by reason of the great distances which 
separate the heavenly bodies in comparison with their linear dimensions, 
but because they possess in general a symmetry of form which makes 
J + B 4- C — 3Z itself a small quantity.
19. 
We see then that in general a system of n bodies of finite dimen­
sions can be replaced by a system of n small particles of equal masses 
occupying the positions of their centres of gravity. The total potential 
energy of the system is
U— — G^miinjlrij
where are two of the masses and rtj their distance apart. For if we 
start with any one of the particles this sum, which consists of jn(n-l) 
terms, represents the potential energy of a second in the presence of the 
first, of a third in the presence of these two, and so on. The equations 
of motion are 3n in number and, according to § 15, of the form

These are called the three integrals of area and express the fact that the sum 
of the areas described by the radius vector to each mass, each multiplied by 
that mass and projected on any given plane, is constant. They also show that 
the total angular momentum of the system about any fixed axis is constant.

There are then in all ten general integrals for the motion of a system of 
particles moving under their mutual attractions: and it is known that no 
others exist under certain limitations of analytical form (Bruns and Poincare). 
They are in fact simply those which apply in virtue of the absence of external 
forces acting on the system.
20. Let the centre of gravity (x, y, z) of the system be now taken as the 
origin of coordinates. If (££, yit ££) are the new coordinates of m£,
Xi = X + £it yi = y + yit zt = z+ & 
and
X nii ^=^771^1 = 1

Ki^)
= 4<(h'-U) + 2U=4>h'-2U
since U is a homogeneous function of the coordinates of degree — 1. The 
form of the result is due to Jacobi. Now U is essentially negative. Hence 
if h' be positive the second derivative of Sm<//qry2 will be always positive and 
the first derivative will increase indefinitely with the time. Thus the first 
derivative, even if negative initially, will become positive after a certain time 
and therefore 
will increase without limit. This means that at least
one of the distances will tend to become infinite. We see therefore that 
a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the stability of the system is that 
h' must be negative.
, 22. The angular momenta whose constant values are cI; c2, c3 are the 
projections on the coordinate planes of a single quantity. They are there­
fore the components of a vector which represents the resultant angular 
momentum about the axis
^Ic^ylc^z/cs .........................................(1)
For this axis, which is fixed in space, the angular momentum is a maximum. 
The plane through the origin 0 . which is perpendicular to this axis and 
therefore fixed is called the invariable plane at 0. About any line through 0 
in this plane the angular momentum is zero, and about any line through 0 

20-23] 
Introductory Propositions 
17
making an angle 0 with the invariable axis (1) the angular momentum is 
V(c!a + c2a + c32) cos 0. The position of the invariable plane is dependent on 
the position of the chosen origin of reference.
Here we have considered the angular momentum as arising purely from 
the translational motions of the bodies treated as particles. In reality the 
total angular momentum of the system includes also that part which arises 
from the rotations of the bodies about their axes. This part itself is constant 
if the system consists of unconnected, rigid, spherical bodies whose concentric 
layers are homogeneous. Under these conditions the invariable plane at a 
point, as determined by the translational motions of the system alone, 
remains permanently fixed. The conditions hold very approximately in a 
planetary system. But precessional movements and the effects of tidal 
friction cause an interchange between the rotational and translational parts 
of the angular momentum, without disturbing the total amount, and to this 
extent affect the position of the astronomical invariable plane as defined 
above.
The centre of gravity of the system may be taken instead of an origin 
fixed in space. The invariable plane is then
cig+cz'i) + c3'£= 0 ........................................ (2)
and this is the invariable plane of Laplace. Its permanent fixity is subject 
to the qualifications just mentioned.
A simple proposition applies to the motion of two bodies, namely that 
the planes through a fixed point 0 and containing the tangents to the paths 
-of the two bodies intersect the invariable plane at 0 in one line. This is 
easily seen to be true. For the first plane passes through the origin, the 
position of the first body 
zj and the consecutive point on its path
(Xi + d^dt, yx + y^dt, zx + z1dt). Hence its equation is
a (yi A - 
+y - w) + z (^yi - yi) = °-
Similarly the equation of the second plane is
x (y2z2 - y2z2) + y (z2x2 - z2x2) + z (x2y2 - x2y2) = 0.
The equations of these planes together with that of the invariable plane 
may therefore be written
a2 = 0, a2 = 0, m1a1 + ?n2a2 = 0
and these evidently meet in a common line of intersection.
23. When we deal with the motions in the solar system it is convenient 
to refer them to the centre of the Sun as origin. Let M be the mass of the 
Sun, m the mass of the planet specially considered and let there be n other

The function R is called the disturbing function. When, as in the solar 
system, the masses of the planets are small in comparison with that of the 
central body, M, we see that the forces derived from this function are small 
in comparison with the attraction of M. Indeed a first approximation to the 
motion of the planet considered, which may now be called the disturbed 
planet, is obtained by putting R = 0.
24. A double star, or system of two stars physically connected and at the 
same time isolated from external influences, may be considered to present a 
case of the problem of two bodies. In the solar system the disturbing effect 
of the other planets is always operating. Since, however, this effect is small 
in comparison with the attraction of the Sun it is useful to neglect R and to 
consider the orbit which a particular planet would have if at a given instant 
the disturbing forces were removed and the planet continued to move as part 
of the system formed by itself and the Sun alone, its velocity in direction and 
amount at the given instant being that which it actually possesses. Such an 
orbit is called the osculating orbit corresponding to the given instant. The 
actual orbit from the beginning will depart more and more from the osculating 
orbit, but for a short interval of time the divergence between the two will be 
so small that an accurate ephemeris can be calculated from the elements of 
the osculating orbit. The usefulness of the conception of the osculating orbit 
goes much deeper than this, as will appear later.
Now the equations (4) to (6) show that in the problem of two bodies, since 
R = 0, the relative motion is that which is determined by an acceleration 
(m + M)Glir2' towards the body M which is considered fixed. But by § 11 
(13) a law of this form leads to an elliptic orbit with mean distance a and 
periodic time T, where
nT — 2tt, n2a3 = (m + M) G.
We can now introduce the usual system of astronomical units. Provision­
ally they are taken to be:
Unit of time: one mean solar day.
Unit of length: the Earth’s mean distance from the Sun.
Unit of mass: the Sun’s mass.
Corresponding to this system G is replaced by the constant k2, so that 
A;=27r/(l + m)iT7
which differs little from the Earth’s mean motion. Here T is the sidereal 
year expressed in mean solar days and m is the mass of the Earth expressed 
as a fraction of that of the Sun. The numerical values adopted by Gauss 
were:
T = 365- 256 3835 
m = 1/354 710
2—2

20 
Introductory Propositions 
[ch. ii
which lead to
k = 0 017 202 098 95, log k = 8-235 581 4414 - 10.
It may be useful to add that
180°. k/7r = 3548"18761, log (180°. Aj/tt) = 3’550 006 5746
which differs little from the Earth’s daily mean motion expressed in seconds.
The number k is called the Gaussian constant. The numerical values 
of m and T on which it is based are no longer considered accurate. Never­
theless it would cause great practical inconvenience to adjust the value of k 
to more modern values which themselves could not be regarded as final. 
Hence it is agreed to adopt the above value of & as a definite, arbitrary 
constant and to recognize that the corresponding unit of length is only an 
approximation to the Earth’s mean distance from the Sun. According to 
Newcomb the logarithm of this distance is 0’000 000 013.
It is also possible to put the constant k = 1 by adopting as the unit of 
time ljk— 58’132 44087 mean solar days.
For brevity we may often put
p = k2 (1 + m) = n2a3
in the case of a planetary orbit, and for a double star
p = k2 (M + m) = n2a3
where M, m are the masses of the two components when the mass of the 
Sun is taken as unity.

CHAPTER III
MOTION UNDER A CENTRAL ATTRACTION
25. If the attraction of the Sun alone is considered, the relative motion 
of any other body of spherical shape is conditioned by the central acceleration 
/zr-2, /z being a constant the value of which has been explained. The equations 
of motion expressed in polar coordinates are :
r — r& = — /z/r2
rQ 4- 2rG = 0.
The latter equation gives immediately
= h
where h is the constant of areas. Let v be the velocity in the orbit, P the 
perpendicular from the origin on the tangent and ijr the angle which the 
tangent makes with the radius vector. Then
r6 
. P
— = sin v = U

so that
Pv = r20 = h
or the velocity is inversely proportional to P. The result of eliminating 0 
from the equations of motion is
r = A2/r3 — fijr1
whence
P=2fi/r-h2/r2+ c..............................(1)
and from these again
<J2

The equation of energy is
v2 = r2 + r202 = 2/z/r + c.................................... (2)
The geometrical meaning of the constant c has yet to be found.

the integral of which is

where e and 7 are the two constants of integration. But this is the polar 
equation of a conic section of which the eccentricity is e and the focus is at 
the origin. The semi-latus rectum in this connexion is more usually called 
the parameter and denoting it by p we have
p = h2/p, or h = \f(pp}-

du pe . 
r = — r2u = — /i

But by (1) and (3)
r2 = 
{1 — e2 cos’ (6 — 7)} + c.
Hence
O = ^(l-«=) + c
or
c = -/x(l -e2)/p.
Thus if 2a is the transverse axis of the orbit, c = — n/a for an ellipse, c = 0 for 
a parabola and c = + p{a for an hyperbola. The equation of energy (2) 
becomes therefore
v2 — 2yn/j—yn/a, 
v2 — ^pfr, 
v2 = 2/z/r + ya/a,

Again, being the angle which the direction of motion at (r, 0) makes 
with the radius vector (drawn towards the origin),
V cos =
J sin (0-7)
v sin = r0 = hu = {1 4- e cos (0 — 7)}
are the components of the velocity along the radius vector (inwards) and 
perpendicular to it. The form of these expressions is to be noted. For they 
evidently represent (a) a constant velocity V=pjh = perpendicular to 

26, 27] Motion under a Central Attraction 
23
the radius vector, and (b) a constant velocity eV in a direction making an 
angle fyir+0—y with the radius vector, that is, perpendicular to the transverse 
axis. Thus at perihelion the velocity is V (1 + e) and at aphelion (in the case 
of elliptic motion) the velocity is F(1 — e).
Since h = vr sin the preceding equations may be written
/xe sin (0 — 7) = — v2r sin aJt cos
ye cos (0 — 7) = v2r sin2 -xjr — y
giving e and 7 when v and i/r are given at (r. 0). Thus
p? (e2 — 1) = v2r (v2r — 2y) sin2
27. In finding the relations which subsist between positions in an orbit 
and the time it is necessary to consider separately the three kinds of conic 
section. The closed orbit, or ellipse, will be discussed first.
The line 0 = 7 is drawn from the pole (the Sun) in the direction of peri­
helion. The angle 0 — y is measured from this line and is called the true 
anomaly. Let it be denoted by w. Then, if t0 is the time at perihelion, 
t —10 = hr1 [ r2d0 
• y 
_ h3 f dw 
~~ y2Jo (1 +ecosw)2’
The corresponding result in terms of the eccentric anomaly E has already 
been found (§ 5). It will be convenient to write down the relations between 
the radius vector and the true and eccentric anomalies in the forms which are 
most frequently required. We have
x = r cos w = a (cos E — e)
y = rsinw = a V(1 — e2) sin E.
Hence

r cos2 Jw = a (1 — e) cos2 %E
r sin2

This last equation may be regarded as the standard form of the relation 
between w and E. If we write e = sin </> (0° < </> < 90°), as is commonly done, 
then

But p = n2as where n is the mean motion; the angle n (t — t0) is called the 
mean anomaly and may be denoted by M. We have therefore once more 
obtained Kepler’s equation
M = n (t — t0) = E — e sin E................................(8)
the angles M and E being expressed in circular measure; or if M and E are 
expressed in degrees, e must also be converted to the same form by the 
factor 180°/7r.
28. 
The complete solution of the problem of elliptic motion is contained 
in the equations given above. No difficulty in numerical solution arises 
except in the case of Kepler’s equation when E is to be found for given 
values of e and M. The general method applicable in such cases may be 
illustrated here. By some means an approximate solution Eo is found. Let 
Eo + AA0 be the exact solution, and
71f0 = Eo — e sin Eo.
Then
M = Ma 4- (1 — e cos Ao) &E0 4-...
when E — esin A1 is expanded in, a power series in AA0 by Taylor’s theorem. 
Neglecting higher powers of AA0 we have
AA0 = (M- Mo)/(I - e cos Eo)
and hence a second approximation E1 = Eo + AE0. If this value is not 
sufficiently accurate the process may be repeated until a satisfactory result is 
obtained.

In order to obtain a good approximate solution at the outset a great 
variety of methods have been devised. These depend upon (a) the use of 
special tables, (&) an approximate formula or a series, or (c) a graphical 
method. Thus to the first order in e,
Eo = M + e sin 71/

the verification of which may be left as an exercise.
Among graphical methods we can refer only to one, given by Newton 
(Principia, Book I, Prop. xxxi). Consider a circle of unit radius and centre C 
rolling on a straight line OX. Let E be the point of contact and A the 
point on the circumference initially coinciding with 0. Let P be a point on 
the radius CA such that CP = e and M and N the feet of the perpendiculars 
from P on OX and CE. Then if E= Z ACA = arc AE—OE,
OM = 0E - ME = OE — PN = E-esinE.
Hence if the circle is rolled (without slipping) along OX until the point 
P is on the ordinate PM where OM = M, the point of contact gives 0E= E, 
which can therefore be read off when M is given. The locus of P is evidently 
a trochoid. It may also be noted that the ordinate
PM = CE - CN = 1 - e cos E
which is the corresponding value of r/a or of dMjdE, and so gives the factor 
required for the improvement of an approximate value Eo. For references 
to practical applications of the above principle see Monthly Notices, R. A. 8., 
lxvii, p. 67.

Hyperbolic motion along the concave branch of the curve under 
attraction to the focus may be treated in an analogous way to elliptic motion 
by using hyperbolic functions instead of circular functions of the eccentric 
anomaly. Thus we have

which is the analogue of Kepler’s equation for this case.
Analogy suggests the use of hyperbolic functions, but full and accurate 
tables of these functions are not always available. Hence it is convenient to 
introduce f, the Gudermannian function of F, where (Log denoting natural 
logarithm)
F= Log tan (45° -t-1/) 
or
sinh F = tan f, cosh F = sec f, tanh ^F = tan
We may also put e = sec ijr. The principal formulae (10), (11) and (13) then

where log denotes common logarithm and log X = 9’6377843.
Comets moving in hyperbolic orbits are few in number, and in no case 
does the eccentricity greatly exceed unity.
31. 
There are certain astronomical problems which require the con­
sideration of repulsive forces according to the law p^r~2 which are of the 
same form as gravitational attraction but differ in sense. The small particles 
which constitute a comet’s tail are apparently subject to such forces and

finely divided meteoric matter in the solar system must move under the 
pressure due to the Sun’s radiation. Hence we shall consider the effect of 
replacing + the acceleration at unit distance, by — p. The differential 
equation of the orbit becomes 
d2u p _ 
^ + “ + ^=0
the integral of which is
w = {* c°s(0-7)- !}
= 7>-1 (ecosw — 1) ........................................ (17)
If we restrict w to such a range of values that u (or r) is positive, this 
equation gives only the branch of the hyperbola convex to the centre of 
repulsion at the focus, just as under the same restriction the equation (10) 
gives only the branch concave to the centre of attraction. As compared 
with § 26 the signs of p and e, as well as of /z, have been changed. Hence 
the constant c in the equation of energy becomes
c = - p (1 - e2)/p = + p/a
so that the equation of energy is now
v2 = p'fa — 2p'!r ........................................ (18)

are the components of the velocity along the inward radius vector and 
perpendicular to it. These are evidently equivalent to (a) a constant 
velocity - V = — p'jh = — 
perpendicular to the radius vector, the
negative sign meaning that V is drawn in the sense opposite to that in 
which the radius vector is rotating, and (b) a constant velocity eV' in a 
direction making an angle |tf + 6 — 7 with the radius vector, that is, perpen­
dicular to the transverse axis. Thus at perihelion the velocity is V' (e — 1) 
as compared with the velocity V(e+ 1) at perihelion on the concave branch 
under an attracting force.
If the circumstances of projection are given in the form of v and x}r at the 
point (r, 0), we have
p'p ~h2 = v2r2 sin2 xjr
p'e sin (0 — 7) = — v2r sin x/r cos x/r
p'e cos (0 — 7) = tfr sin2 xjr + p
which determine p, e and 7 in terms of given quantities. In particular
p'2 (e2 — 1) = v2r (vV + 2p') sin2 xjr.

Motion under a Central Attraction [ch. hi
33. The simple and important representation of the velocity in all cases 
as the resultant of two vectors both constant in magnitude, and one constant 
in direction also, may be illustrated by considering the hodograph of the 
motion. This curve is clearly a circle of radius V and centre at a distance 
e V from the origin. The four figures given correspond with the four distinct 
types of motion, (a) elliptic, (6) parabolic, (c) hyperbolic, under attraction to 
the focus, and (d) hyperbolic, under repulsion from the focus. In all cases 0 
is the origin, C the centre, and OP represents the velocity at perihelion. If 
Q is any point on the hodograph, OQ represents the velocity in the orbit at 
one extremity of the focal chord which is at right angles to CQ. The radius 
CP being V, 00 = eV and as the eccentricity increases 0 moves along the 
radius opposite to CP from the position C for a circular orbit to a point on 
the circumference for a parabolic orbit. As e increases beyond the value 1 
the point 0 passes outside the circle. But the hodograph corresponding to 
hyperbolic motion is no longer a complete circle since the possible directions 
of motion are limited by the asymptotes. If OA, OB are the tangents from 0 
to the circle the angles CO A, COB are each equal to sin-1 e-1 and it is easily 
seen that OA, OB are parallel to the asymptotes of the orbit, that A OB is 
equal to the exterior angle between the asymptotes, and that the arc APB 
constitutes the whole hodograph. When the attraction is changed to a 
repulsion and motion takes place along the convex instead of the concave 
branch of the hyperbola, OP = V (e — 1), and the hodograph is confined to 
that arc of the circle which is at all points convex to 0, whereas in case (c) 
it was everywhere concave to 0.
34. 
From the point of view of practical calculation there are points con­
nected with orbits nearly parabolic in form which require special attention. 
Kepler’s equation for elliptic motion may be written
M = E — sin E 4- (1 — e) sin E.
When 1 — e is small the accurate calculation of M depends on that of 
E — sin E. But if E is small the latter expression is the difference of two 
nearly equal quantities and cannot be calculated directly unless each is 

33, 34] Motion under a Central Attraction 
31
expressed by a disproportionate number of significant figures. Hence the 
need for special tables (e.g. Bauschinger’s Tafeln, No. xl) or an approximate 
formula. Under the latter head may be mentioned the function
^(cos^)^
which is so close an approximation to E — sin E over the range of E from 
0° to 70° that the logarithms of the two expressions never differ by more than 
2 in the seventh place.
It is evident that in the parabola itself E is evanescent and generally in 
the ellipse of great eccentricity E is small at all points near the attracting 
focus. The method given by Gauss in the Theoria Motus for the treatment 
of Kepler’s equation is a particularly instructive example of the construction 
and use of special tables and as at the same time it brings out clearly the 
relation to parabolic motion its principle will be explained here.
Kepler’s equation may be written in the form
M = (1 — e) (aE + /3 sin E) + (/3 + ae) (E — sin E)
if a + /? = 1, or
M= (l-e).2A^ + (/3 + ae). $A
*B
 ............................(26)
if
A = 3 (E - sin jE7)/2 (aE + /3 sin E) 
and
B2 = (aE + /3 sin E^/G (E — sin E)
= (E^-^.E\..)/(ES-^...) 
which differs from unity by a quantity of the fourth order only in E if 
/3= 1/10, a = 9/10. With these values it is readily found that
A = ^E2 — 
.
E = 1 + ssoo E14 — ....
Hence log 7? is a small quantity of the fourth order which is tabulated with A, 
itself of the second order, as argument.
We now put, in view of (26),
-41=A/(iT%)tanK 
so that
M = 2 V-5 (1 — e)*
 (1 + 9e) ~ J B (tan jwj +1 tan3 |wj).

the analogy of which with (9) of § 29 is evident. Here B is unknown, but 
the supposition that B = 1 will lead to a good first approximation to tan 
and hence to A, and a nearer value for log B can then be taken from the table. 
This in turn will lead to a second approximation to tan , and so on until 
the correct value is reached. Now let
r = tan2 %E = (j E + £E3... )2 = | E3 + &E

or
A = r(l+iA...)-1 = T(l-jA + C)

so that the problem of finding w and r is solved by the aid of the tables 
giving log B and C with the argument A without introducing E explicitly 
into the calculation. The method with very little change is adapted equally 
to hyperbolic orbits. The tables will be found in the Theoria Motus of Gauss, 
or in an equivalent form in Bauschinger’s Tafeln, Nos. xvn and xvm.

It is evident that some expansions will be made more simply in terms of 
/? than of e. Hence it will be useful to have the development of any positive 
power of /? in terms of e. Now
/? + /3-1 = tan

and it is readily seen that this series is absolutely convergent.
36. 
Since 
x={y-0){1 - /fy)-1 
it follows that
logx = Idg.y + log (1 - /Sy"1) - log (1 - £y)
= logy + /3(y-y-1) + |/32(y2-y-2)+ .... 
Hence
w = E + 2 (/? sin E +1/32 sin 2E +sin '3E +...) ........... (8)
But x and y can be interchanged if the sign of /? is changed at the same time.
Therefore 
•
E = w — 2(J3 sin w — %p sin 2w + J/33 sin 3 w — ...).
It is also easy to express M in terms of w. For, by (5),
log z = log x + log (1 + ^ar1) - log (1 + fix') + £ cos d {(x + /3)-1 - (ar1 + /S)1}
= log x - £ (x - x-1) +1p- (a? - x~2) - %p {a? - x~3) + ...

and therefore
M = w — 2 
(1 + cos </>) sin w — 
(| + cos </>) sin 2 w + yS3 (| +cos«/>)sin3?c—...}.
By this expansion the equation of the centre, w—M, is expressed as a series in 
terms of the true anomaly.
37. 
We have now to consider the expansions in terms of M, which are of 
the greatest importance because they are required in order to express the 
coordinates as periodic functions of the time. And first we take the case of 
r-1. Now

Thus the coefficients in the expansion of F(t) are precisely the coefficients

or, equating the coefficients of tp, 
[Jp-i (x) — Jp+1 (x)] = Jp (x) ............................ (15)
These simple recurrence formulae show that, with any given argument, Bessel’s 
coefficients of any order, and their derivatives, can be expressed as linear 
functions of the coefficients of any two particular orders, or of any one 
coefficient and its derivative, e.g. Ji(x) and J/(x). In particular,

This well-known form, intermediate between Fourier’s and Laurent’s, is 
general and includes the case p = 0. It has been used already in § 37.

of which the first is available if i — p — m > 0 and the second if i — p — in < 0, 
for then the third argument of the series is positive and the binomial coeffi­
cient has a meaning. If i — p = m both forms become
X* ’™ = F(m -n-1, - m -n-1, 1, /32).
When n is assumed to be positive, at least one of the first two arguments of 
the series is always negative, and therefore the series is a polynomial in /32. 
For in the first form with i — p — m > 0, the second argument is certainly 

46 
Expansions in Elliptic Motion 
[ch. iv
negative if m is positive; if m is negative, n 4-1 — m > 0 and the. binomial 
coefficient shows that i — p — m < n 4- 1 — m, so that the first argument is 
negative. Similarly when the second form is valid it also is a terminating 
series. When n is negative one of the known transformations of the 
hypergeometric series may be necessary to give a finite form. Hence 
Hansen’s coefficients are reduced to the form

where X**  represents, with a simple factor, a hypergeometric polynomial 
in jS2. This form was first given by Hill.
46. The periodic series in M found above are evidently legitimate 
Fourier expansions, satisfying the necessary conditions with e<l, and as 
such are convergent. The Bessel’s coefficients are given in explicit form by 
the series (11) which also is at once seen to be absolutely convergent for 
all values of e. But in practical applications the expansions are generally 
ordered not as Fourier series in M but as power series in e. Under these 
circumstances the question of convergence is altered and needs a special 
investigation. Now
E = M 4- e sin E
considered as an equation in E has one root in the interior of a given contour, 
and any regular function of this root can be expanded by Lagrange’s theorem 
as a power series in e, provided that
| e sin E j < | E — M |
at all points of the given contour
*.
 We have then to find a contour with the 
required property, and to examine its limits.
We are to regard e and M as given real constants. The equation
E = M 4- p cos x + ip sin x
where p is constant, defines a circular contour. At any point on it
sin E = sin (M 4- p cos x) cosh (p sin x) + cos (M 4- p cos sinh (p sin x) 
so that
| sin E |2 = sin2 (M 4- p cos x) cosh2 (p sin x) + cos2 (M 4- p cos x) sinh2 (p sin x)
= cosh2 (p sin x) — cos2 {M 4- p cos x) 
while
| E-M\ = p.

45-47J 
Expansions in Elliptic Motion

The most unfavourable point on the contour for the required condition is 
that at which ; sin E | is greatest. And our series is to be valid for all real 
values of M. Hence the condition is always fulfilled if it is fulfilled when
sin x = ± 1, cos (M + p cos %) = 0 
or
X = + |tT, M = + J>7T 
in which case
| sin E = cosh p.
Thus the required condition becomes
e < p/cosh p.
The greatest value of e is therefore limited by the maximum value of 
p/cosh p, which is given by
cosh p = p sinh p.
Inspection of a table of hyperbolic cosines shows at once that p/cosh p is 
greatest when p is about 1’20 and that its value is then about f. With 
ordinary logarithmic tables an accurate value can be obtained without 
difficulty thus. Let tana be the greatest possible value of e, so that
tan a = p/cosh p = 1 /sinh p.
It easily follows that
exp. p = cot | a, coth p = sec a
whence, by the equation giving p,
cos a Log cot £ a = 1
or, using common logarithms and taking logarithms once more, 
log cos a + log log cot I a + 0’362 215 69 = 0.
In this form it is easily verified that
a = 33° 32' 3"0, tan a = 0’662 7434....
This last number is then the limiting value of e, within which the expansion 
of any regular function of E in powers of e is valid for all values of M. The 
orbits of the members of the solar system have eccentricities which are much 
below this limit, with the exception of some, but not all, of the periodic 
comets.

CHAPTER V
RELATIONS BETWEEN TWO OR MORE POSITIONS IN AN ORBIT
AND THE TIME
48. Since a conic section can be chosen to satisfy any five conditions it is 
evident that when the focus is given, and two points on the curve, an infinite 
number of orbits will pass through them. The orbit becomes determinate 
when the length of the transverse axis is given, though in general the solution 
is not unique. For let the points be Pn P2 and the focal distances g, r2. 
In the first place we take an elliptic orbit with major axis 2a. The second 
focus lies on the circle with centre P2 and radius 2a — rl; it also lies on the 
circle with radius P2 and radius 2a — r2. These two circles intersect in two 
points provided (c being the length of the chord P,P2)
2a — rt + 2a — r2 > c 
or
4a > Tj + r2 + c............................................ (1)
If this inequality be satisfied two orbits fulfil the given conditions; if not, 
no such orbit exists. We notice that the two intersections lie on opposite 
sides of the chord /\P2, so that in the one case the two foci lie on the same 
side of the chord, in the other on opposite sides. ’ In other words, in one 
orbit the chord intersects the axis at some point between the foci, while 
in the other orbit it does not. Only when 4a = rl+r2 + c the two circles 
mentioned touch one another in a single point on PjP2 and the two orbits 
coincide. In this case the chord passes through the second focus.
When the orbit is the concave branch of an hyperbola the second focus 
lies on the circle with centre Pi and radius ty + 2a and also on the circle 
with centre P2 and radius r2 + 2a. These circles always intersect in two 
distinct real points since
fi + 2a + r2 + 2a > c
always. There are therefore always two hyperbolas which satisfy the con­
ditions. The second foci lie on opposite sides of the chord and hence in the 
one case the chord intersects the axis between the two foci and the difference
p. D. A.

50 Relations between two or more Positions । [ch. v 
between the true anomalies at the points Px, P2 is less than 180°, while in 
the other case the chord intersects the axis beyond the attracting focus and 
the difference between the anomalies is greater than 180°.
Under a repulsive force varying inversely as the square of the distance the 
convex branch of an hyperbola can be described. The position of the second 
focus is again given by the intersection of two circles, the one with centre Px 
and radius — 2a and the other with centre P2 and radius r2 — 2a. These 
circles intersect in two points provided
rj — 2a + r2 — 2a > c 
or
4<a<r1 + r2 — c............................................ (2)
There are then two hyperbolas and in the one case the chord intersects the 
axis at a point between the two foci while in the other it cuts the axis at a 
point beyond'the second focus.
It is easy to see similarly that it is always possible to draw four hyper­
bolas such that one branch passes through Px while the other branch passes 
through P2. These have no interest from the kinematical point of view 
since it is impossible for a particle to pass from one branch to the other.
The case of parabolic solutions, two of which always exist, can be inferred 
from the foregoing by the principle of continuity. . But it is otherwise clear 
that the directrix touches the circles with centres P1} P2 and radii rlf r2. These 
circles, which intersect in the focus, have two real common tangents either of 
which may be the directrix. The corresponding axes are the perpendiculars 
from the focus to these tangents. In the case of the nearer tangent it is 
evident that the part of the axis beyond the focus intersects the chord PiP2 
and the difference of the anomalies is greater than 180°. In the case of the 
opposite tangent, on the other hand, it is the part of the axis towards the 
directrix which cuts the chord and the difference of the anomalies is less 
than 180°.
These simple geometrical considerations show that, when the transverse 
axis is given, two points on an orbit may be joined in general by four elliptic 
arcs (of two ellipses), by two concave hyperbolic arcs, by two convex hyper­
bolic arcs; and in particular by two parabolic arcs. This conclusion is qualified 
by the conditions (1) and (2) which of course cannot be satisfied simul­
taneously. All these different cases must present themselves when we seek 
the time occupied in passing from one given point to another, as we shall 
at once see.
49. Let Elt E2 be the eccentric anomalies at two points P1} P2 on an 
ellipse, and let
2G = E2 + Elf 2g = E2 — E2.
Then
rx = a (1 — e cos A'j), r2 = a (I — e cos P2)

and
7i + r2 = 2a {1 — e cos 1 (P’2 4- E^ cos | (E2 — £\)} 
= 2a (1 — e cos G cos g).
Again, c being the chord PXP2, 
c2 = a2 (cos E2 — cos E-tf 4- a2 (1 — e2) (sin E2 - sin Ex)2
= 4a2 sin2 G sin2# 4- 4a2 (1 — e2) cos2 G sin2 g.
Hence if we put
cos h = e cos G
then
c2 = 4a2 sin2 g (1 — cos2 A) 
of
c = 2a sin g sin h 
and 
7*1  + 7g = 2a (1 — cos g cos h).
If further we now put 
e = h+ g, 8 = h — g 
or
6 — 3= E2 — h\, cos |(e4- 8) =■ e cos |(A24- E-^) ..............(3)
we have
7*1  4- r2 4- c = 2a [1 — cos (h 4- g)} = 4a sin2 ...................(4)
r1 + r2 — c = 2a[l — cos (h — 
= 4a sin2..................(5)
But on the other hand, if E2 > Ex and
p = k (1 4- m) = nsa8
the time t of describing the arc PjP2 is given by
nt = E2 — Ex — e (sin E2 — sin P)
= c — £ — 2 sin |(c — 3) cos|(e 4- 8)
= (e — 8) — (sin e — sin S) ............................................ (6)
where e and S are given by (4) and (5) in terms of rx 4- r2, c and a; and this 
is Lambert’s theorem for elliptic motion.
50. It is evident that (4) and (5) do not give e and 3 without ambiguity, 
and this point must be examined. We suppose always that E2 —Ex < 360°, 
i.e. that the arc described is less than a single circuit of the orbit; and we 
assume that the eccentric anomaly is reckoned from the pericentre in the 
direction of motion. Now it is consistent with (3) to take l(e 4- S) between 
0 and 7f and we also have |(e — 8) between the same limits. Hence lies 
between 0 and tt and lies between — fyir and 4- |tt. But the equation of 
the chord PXP2 referred to the centre of the ellipse shows that it cuts the 
axis of x in the point
x = a cos | (P2 — Pi)/cos | (E2 4- Ex), y = 0

Now sin and cos $8 are always positive. We may also take Et less than 
2tt and sin |l?x positive; then sin %E2 is negative or positive according as 
the arc includes or does not include the pericentre. In the first equation 
the left-hand side is negative when the chord intersects the axis between 
the pericentre and the first (attracting) focus; in the second when the 
intersection falls between the pericentre and the second focus. Otherwise 
both members are positive. Hence we see that sin is positive if (1) the 
arc contains the pericentre and the chord intersects FiA, or (2) the arc does 
not contain the pericentre and the chord does not intersect jFY/1 ; and that 
cos |e is positive if (3) the arc contains the pericentre and the chord inter­
sects or (4) the arc does not contain the pericentre and the chofd does 
not intersect F2A. In other words, sin is positive when thp segment 
formed by the arc and the chord does not contain the first focus, and cos |e 
is positive when the segment does not contain the second focus.
Let ex and 5X be the smallest positive angles which satisfy (4) and (5). 
The other possible values are 2tf — ex and — 5X. If we put
n«2 = ex — sin ex, ?i/x = 8X — sin 8X
there are four cases to be distinguished, namely:
(a) 
t = t2 — <x
when the segment contains neither focus;
(6) 
t = t2 4-1.
when the segment contains the attracting, but not the other focus;
(c) 
t = 2ir!n — t2 — tx
when the segment contains the second, but not the attracting focus;
(d) 
t = 2ir/n — t2 4-1
when the segment contains both foci. It is easy to see from § 48 that when 
the extreme points of the arc alone are given these four cases are always 
presented by the geometrical conditions and can only be distinguished by 
further knowledge of the circumstances. Usually it is known that the arc is 
comparatively short and hence that the solution (a) is the right one.

51. The corresponding theorem for parabolic motion is easily deduced as 
a limiting case. For when a is very large e and 8 are very small. Hence 
(4) and (5) become
ae2 = rj + r2 + c, a& = rx + r.2 — c.
At the same time, if we replace n by (6) becomes
p^t = 
(e3 — 83)
= | (r> + r2 + c)- + i (rT + r2 -1)1
As this applies to the motion of a comet, and the mass of a comet may be 
considered negligible, we may therefore write
Qkt = (rj + r2 + c)*  + (rT + r2 - c)
*
............................(7)
which is the required equation. It was first found by Euler. As regards 
the ambiguous sign, the second focus is at an infinite distance and does not 
come into consideration. But 8 is negative or positive according as the 
segment formed by the arc described and the chord contains or does not 
contain the focus of the parabola. Hence the lower (+) sign is to be used 
when the angle described by the radius vector exceeds 180°, and the upper 
(—) sign is to be used when this angle is less than 180°, as it almost 
always is in actual problems.
52. 
The solution of (7) as an equation in c is facilitated by a trans­
formation due to Encke. We put
c = (n + r2) sin 7, 0 < 7 < 90c 
and
17 = 2/^/(r1 + r2)t
Then (7) becomes
= (1 + sin 7)’ + (1 — sin 7)*
= (cos I7 + sin J7)3 + (cos ly — sin I7)3 ....................(8)
First we’ take the upper sign, in which case
3?7 = 6 sin 17 cos2 £7 + 2 sin317
= 6 sin I7 — 4 sin317.
If we put
sin ly = V2 sin J©, 0 < J© < 30° 
then
37? = 2V2sin©, 0< ©<90'.........................................(9)
and
sin 7 = 2 V2 sin |© V(cos |©).
Hence
c = (rT + r2) w ............................................................. (10)
where
/z = sin 7/17 = 3 sin |© V(cos |©)/sin ©........................(11) 

54 Relations between two or more Positions [ch. v
Since /z and tj are both functions of 0, /z can be tabulated with the argument 77. 
When such a table is available (cf. Bauschinger’s Tafeln, No. xxii) and 77 is 
known, c is immediately given by (10).
In the second place we take the lower sign in (8), so that
St? = 2 cos3 £7 + 6 sin217 cos £7
= 6 cos I7 — 4 cos317.
If now we put
cos I7 = V2 sin j®, 30° < j® < 45° 
then
397 = 2^2sin®, 90° < @<135°.................................... (12)
and
sin 7 = 2 V2 sin j® V(cos f ®)
as before. Hence (10) and (11) apply equally to this case, with the difference 
that ® as given by (12) is an angle in the second quadrant instead of the 
first. Except for this the solution is formally the same in both cases, but 
different tables would be necessary. The case of angular motion exceeding 
180°, however, seldom demands consideration in practice.
53. 
For motion along the concave branch of an hyperbola under attraction 
to the focus we have (§ 30)
r1 = a (e cosh Ex — 1), r2 = a (e cosh E2 — 1)
and we may suppose E2 > E}. Hence
Ti 4- r2 = 2a [e cosh | (E2 — EJ cosh | (E2 4- EJ - 1}
= 2a {cosh | (e — 8) cosh | (e + 5) — 1} 
where
e— 8 = E2 — Ey, cosh|(e4-8) = ecosh j (E2 4- EJ .......(13)
Again, the chord c is given by
c2 = a2 (cosh E2 — cosh A\)2 4- a2 (e2 — 1) (sinh E2 — sinh EJ2
— 4a2 sinh21 (E2 — 2?T) sinh21 (E2 4- EJ

= 4a2 sinh2 j (e — 8) {— 1 4- cosh2 j (e 4- 8)} 
or
c = 2a sinh | (e - S) sinh | (e 4- 8). 
Hence
rx 4- r2 4- c = 2a (cosh e — 1) = 4a sinh2 je ...................(14)
4- r2 — c = 2a (cosh 8 — 1) = 4a sinh2................... (15)

But on the other hand if
/z = k2 (1 + m) = n2a3
nt = e sinh E2 - E2 - (e sinh ET - E^

= 2 sinh |(g - 8)cosh | (g 4- 8) — (g — 8)
= sinh g — sinh 8 — (g — 8).................................................(16)
where g and 8 are given by (14) and (15). This is the form which Lambert’s 
theorem takes in this case.
We may take (g 4- 8) as defined by (13) positive; and (g — 8) is positive 
since E2 > Ex. Hence g is positive. Now the equation of the chord referred 
to the centre of the hyperbola gives for the intercept on the axis
x = — a cosh | (E2 — E^/cosh | (E2 4- E^, y = 0
or, (— ae, 0) being the attracting focus within this branch,
x + ae = — a [cosh |(g — 8) — cosh |(g 4- 8)]/cosh | (E2 4- E^ 
= + 2asinh|6sinh|8/cosh|(E'2 + H) ................ (17)
The left-hand side is negative or positive according as the intersection falls 
beyond the focus or on the side of the focus towards the centre. Hence 
sinh |8 is positive when the angular motion about the focus is less than 180°, 
and negative when it exceeds 180°. Thus the sign of 8 is determined. If 
we put
= (t-j + r2 + c)l^a, m22 = (^ + r2 — c)/4a 
then
sinh |g = + mx, sinh |8 = + m2 
or
exp. |g = + 
1, exp. |8 = + 7?42 + Vm22 4- 1
sinh g = 
277^ V4- 1, sinh 8 — + 2t742 VmJ 4- 1.
Hence (16) can be written (Log denoting natural logarithm)
nt = 2774! V77412 4- 1 + 2t742 Vt7422 + 1
— 2 Log (ttZj 4- V774i2 4-1) ± 2 Log (m2 4- VmJ 4-1)
where the upper or the lower sign is to be taken according as the angular 
motion about the attracting focus is less or greater than 180°.
54. The corresponding theorem for motion along the convex branch of 
an hyperbola under a repulsive force from the focus can be proved similarly. 
In this case (§ 32)
7*1  = a (e cosh Et 4-1), r2 = a (e cosh E2 4-1).
Hence
7*j  + r2 = 2a [cosh (g 4- 8) cosh (g — 8) + 1]

where
e — S = E2 - Elt cosh j (e 4- 5) = e cosh | (E2 4- EJ........... (18)
and as in § 53
c = 2asinh j (e — S)sinh|(e4-S).
We have therefore
?’i 4- r2 4- c = 2a (cosh e 4-1) = 4a cosh2 j e...................(19)
r1 + r2 — c=2a (cosh S 4- 1) = 4a cosh21S .............. (20)
Then by § 32 (22), if/ = n2a3,
.nt = e sinh E2 4- E2 — (e sinh Ex 4- E^)
= 2e sinh (2?2 — Ei) cosh J- (E2 4- Ex) 4- E2 — EA
= 2 sinh |(e — 8)cosh|(e4- 8)4- e — S
= sinh e — sinh S 4-e - S ................................................. (21)
where e and S are given by (19) and (20). This is analogous to the other 
forms of Lambert’s equation.
Putting as before
?/ii2 = (?’i 4- r2 4- c)l^a, mJ = (rx 4- r2 — c)f^a
we have of necessity
cosh |e = 4-?/^, cosh|S = 4-/n2
but there is again an ambiguity in the values of e and & Now we may take 
E2 > and | (e — 8) positive; and we may define |(e 4- S) as the positive 
value which satisfies (18). Hence e is positive and exp. (|e) > 1. To the 
equation (17) now corresponds
x — ae = — 2a sinh sinh |S/cosh £ (E2 4- EJ
showing that S is positive if the chord intersects the axis at a point on the 
side of the focus towards the centre. It must be noticed that this focus is, 
as before, the focus within the branch and not the centre of force. Hence 
exp. 18 > or < 1 according as,the angular motion about this focus < or > 180 . 
It follows that
exp. (|e) = 4- mA 4- VmJ — 1, exp. (|S) = 4- 
± Vm22 — 1
sinh e = 2/711 VnJ — 1, sinh 8 = + 2m2 VmJ — 1

nt = 2/nj V7?ii2 — 1 + 2m2 mJ — 1
4- 
2 Log(m! 4- •JmJ — 1) + 2 Log(77i2 4- Vm.22 — 1)
where Log denotes natural logarithm and the upper or the lower sign is to be 
taken according as the motion about the internal focus (not the centre 
of force) is less or greater than 180°.

In all cases, whether the motion is along a parabola or either branch of 
an hyperbola, when two focal distances are given in position and nothing 

54, 55] 
in an Orbit and the Time

more is known about the circumstances, the discussion of § 48 shows that 
the ambiguities in the expressions for the time of describing the arc corre­
spond to the distinct solutions of the geometrical problem. Hence they 
cannot be decided without further information. In practice, however, it 
rarely happens that the angular motion about a focus exceeds 180° and 
this limitation, by which the upper sign can be taken, will be generally 
understood.
55. 
A quantity of great importance in the determination of orbits is the 
ratio, denoted by y, of the sector to the triangle. The case of elliptic motion 
is taken first. Since n = h[ab, where h is the constant of areas, twice the 
area of the sector is, by (6),
• ht = ab\e — b — (sin e — sin S)}.
But if yi), (a^, #2) are the extremities of the ate, twice the area of the 
triangle is
2A = O\y2-x2yA)
= ab {sin E2 (cos Ex — e) — sin E2 (cos E2 - e)}
= ab {sin (E> - Ei) - 2e cos | (E2 4- E}) sin | (E2 - Ex)\
= ab {sin (e — b) — (sin e — sin S)}
by (3). Hence 
e —$ — (sin e—sin 8) 
...........................
sin (e — 8) — (sin e — sin S)

This expression contains a implicitly and this quantity is to be eliminated. 
Let 2/ be the angle between rA and r2 and let g, h have the meaning assigned 
to them in § 49. Then

The value of y is to be found by solving this pair of equations in y and g, the

56. 
The corresponding ratio in the case of a parabola can be expressed 
in several forms. The simplest can be derived as a limiting case from the 
ellipse when a is large and e and 8 are small. For (22) then gives
‘ e3 — 83

In the case of the branch of an hyperbola concave to the focus of

ht = ab {sinh e — sinh 8 — (e — 8)}

twice the area of the focal triangle is
2A = x2yx - xxy2
= ab {sinh Et (cosh E2 — e) — sinh E2 (cosh Ex — e)}
= ab {sinh — E2) — e (sinh ET — sinh A.2)J
= ab {sinh e — sinh 8 — sinh (e — 8)}
by (13). Hence
_ sinh e — sinh 8 — (e — 8)

The case of the branch which is convex to a centre of repulsive 
force at the focus (— ae, 0) needs slight modifications. Twice the area of the 
sector is by (21)
ht = ab (sinh e — sinh 8 + e — 8)
while twice the area of the triangle is
2A = x2y2 - x2y2

= ab {sinh (A2 - E2) + 2e sinh ^(E2 — EJ cosh | (E2 + Ej]

by (18). Hence the ratio of sector to triangle is

Now in the case of the motion of two bodies in a plane we have

The form (40) applies to an ellipse and gives the means of calculating an

to the hyperbola by changing the sign of a. For the parabola the right-hand

CHAPTER VI
THE ORBIT IN SPACE
63. Hitherto we have considered the relative motion of two bodies only 
as referred to axes in the plane in which the motion takes place. It is now 
necessary to specify the manner in which the motion in space is usually 
expressed.
We take a sphere of arbitrary unit radius with the Sun at its centre. 
The ecliptic for a given date is a great circle on this sphere. That hemi­
sphere which contains the North Pole of the Equator may be called the 
northern hemisphere. On the ecliptic is a fixed point 7 which represents 
the equinoctial point for the given date and from which longitudes are 
reckoned in a certain direction. The plane of the orbit is also represented 
by a great circle which intersects the ecliptic in two points. One of these 
O corresponds to the passage of the moving body from the southern to the 
northern hemisphere and is called the ascending node; the other node is 
called the descending node. The longitude of fi, or 7O, may be denoted also 
by fl: it is an angle which may have any value between 0° and 360°. The 
angle between the direction of increasing longitudes along the ecliptic and 
the direction of increasing true anomaly along the orbit is called the in­
clination and may be denoted by i. It is an angle which may lie between 
0° and 180°.
Let P be the point on the great circle of the orbit which represents the 
radius vector through the perihelion and Q any other point on the same 
great circle representing a radius vector with the true anomaly w, so that 
PQ = w. We may denote the arc IIP lying between 0° and. 360° by to, so 
that flQ = to + w. This angle, reckoned from the ascending node to any 
point on the plane of the orbit, is called the argument of the latitude. It is 
possible to regard to as an element of the orbit, but it has been more usual 
to define the element w, which is called the longitude of perihelion, as the 
sum of the two angles f2 + <0 although only one of these is measured along 
the ecliptic. The angle is- + w or f1 + <0 +- w is called the longitude in the 
orbit. We have thus defined the three elements, the longitude of the
P. D. A.

The Orbit in Space 
[ch. vi
ascending node, the inclination of the orbit and the longitude of perihelion, 
required to fix the position of the orbit in space, and with these it is 
necessary to mention the date of the ecliptic and equinox to which they 
are referred.
64. The motion must now be definitely related to the time. Let t0 be 
an epoch arbitrarily chosen and T the time of perihelion passage. Then, 
n being the mean motion, the mean anomaly corresponding to the epoch is
M0 = n (t0 - T).
Either Mo or T might be regarded as an element of the orbit, but in the 
case of a planetary orbit it is more usual to employ the mean longitude at 
the epoch, e, which is defined as the sum ct + Mo. Thus at any time t, if 
u = vr + w is the longitude in the orbit and E the eccentric anomaly, the 
position of the planet is given by
tan j (u - ct) = 
tan £E
where
E — e sin E = M = n (t - T)
= n (t - to) + e - ct.
The mean motion and the mean distance are connected by the relation (§ 24) 
na% = jjfi = k"(l + ni)^
where m is the mass of the planet (negligible in the case of minor planets). 
The complete elements can now be enumerated and illustrated by the case of 
the planet Mars:

The number of independent elements is six, corresponding to the six con­
stants of integration which enter into the solution of the equations of motion, 
these being in their general form three in number and of the second order.
When the orbit is parabolic the eccentricity is 1 and the mean distance 
is infinite. The scale of the orbit is indicated by the perihelion distance q 
and the time of perihelion passage T is given instead of the mean longitude

65. If axes 0 (x1} ylf zi) be taken such that passes through the node, 
OyL lies in the plane of the orbit, and 0^ is in the direction of the N. pole of 
the orbit, the coordinates of the planet (or comet) are
x1 = r cos (&> + w), yi — r sin (&> 4- w), z1 = 0
when its true anomaly is w. Let the axes be turned about OxY so that Oyx 
takes the position 0y2 in the plane of the ecliptic and Oz2 is directed towards 
the N. pole of the ecliptic. Then
a?2 = #i> 
= ?/i cos z — sin z, z2 = cos i + y± sin i.
Next let the axes be turned about 0z2 so that 0x3 passes through the equi­
noctial point and 0y3 is in longitude 90°. Then
a?3 = x2 cos fl — y2 sin fl, y3 — y2 cos + x2 sin fl, z3 = z2.
Hence the relations between (a?3, y3, 23) and (a?1? y1; zi) are given by
This scheme will give the heliocentric ecliptic coordinates of the planet.

It is convenient to write
sin a sin A = cos fl, sin a cos J. = — cos i sin fl
sin 6' sin B' = sin fl, sin b' cos B' = cos i cos fl 
for then
x3 = r sin a sin (A + to + w)
y3 = r sin b’ sin (B’ + to + w) 
z3 — r sin i sin (to + w).
Hence, if R, Llt B^ are the geocentric distance, longitude and latitude (the 
last always a very small angle) of the Sun, which may be taken from the 
Nautical Almanac, and A, X, are the geocentric distance, longitude and 
latitude of the planet,
A cos X cos ^ — R cos Lx cos Bt + r sin a sin (A' + to + w)
A sin X cos /S = R sin Lx cos Bx + r sin b sin (B' + &> + «/)
A sin /S = R sin 
+ r sin i sin (to + w)
whence the geocentric ecliptic coordinates of the planet.

68
The Orbit in Space
[ch. vi
66. Were the elements given with reference to the equator instead of 
the ecliptic, and this is sometimes done (though not often), the same 
formulae would give equatorial coordinates with the substitution of R.A. and 
declination for longitude and latitude. To obtain equatorial coordinates 
from ecliptic elements another transformation is necessary. Let the last 
system of axes be turned about 0x3 so that 0y3 comes into the plane of the 
equator and the new axis 0z4 is directed towards the N. pole of the equator. 
Then the obliquity of the ecliptic being denoted by e0,
= ®3, 2/4 = y-3 cos €0 - z3 sin 60, z4 = z3 cos e0 + y3 sin e0-
From the above relations between (x3, y3, z3) and (xlf ylt zj it follows 
that (a?4, 7/4, z4) and (xlt y1} z-i) are related by the scheme:

where it is easily seen that
sin a sin A = cos fl
sin a cos A = — cos i sin fl 
cos a = sin i sin fl 
sin b sin B = cos e0 sin fl 
sin b cos B = cos e0 cos i cos fl — sin e0 sin i 
cos b = — cos e0 sin i cos fl — sin e0 cos i 
sin c sin C = sin e0 sin fl
sin c cos C = sin e0 cos i cos fl + cos e0 sin i 
cos c = — sin e0 sin i cos fl + cos e0 cos i.
The heliocentric equatorial coordinates of the planet now become 
x4 = r sin a sin (A + to 4- w) 
y4 = r sin b sin (B + to + w) 
z4 = r sin c sin (C + to + w).
Thus, for example, the above elements for Comet a 1906 lead to
x4 = r [9-803389] sin (243° 29' 42"-3 + w)
y4 = r [9 999830] sin (331 33 15 -1 + w)
z4 = r [9-887772] sin ( 60 14 19
*5+w)
 
referred to the equator of 1906’0.
Let (x, y, z) be the geocentric equatorial coordinates of the planet and 
{X, Y, Z) the corresponding geocentric coordinates of the Sun, which may 
be taken directly from the Nautical Almanac or other ephemeris. Thus
x = X + x4, y=Y+y4, z=Z+z4.

66, 67] 
The, Orbit in Space 
69
But
x = A cos a cos 8, y = A sin a cos 8, z —A. sin 8
where A, a, 8 are the geocentric distance, right ascension and declination of 
the planet. These coordinates can therefore be calculated from the equations
A cos a cos 8 = X + r sin a sin (J. 4- to + w) 
A sin a cos 8 = Y + r sin b sin (B + w + w) 
A sin 8 
= Z + r sin c sin (C + to + w).
This form of equations, introduced by Gauss, is very convenient for the 
systematic calculation of positions in an orbit.
67. 
The direct transformation of the elements from one plane of refer­
ence to any other may be made as follows. Let yAB represent the first 
plane of reference, yLAC the second plane and BCP the plane of the orbit. 
The first set of elements are yB = £l, BP = w and 180° — B = i. The new 
elements are 71C'=fl', CP=a, and C=i'. Also the position of the new 
plane of reference relative to the old may be defined by yA = fl1} A =i\ and 
the arbitrary origin 7! by yAA = fl0. Hence the sides and angles of the 
triangle ABC are
a = to — w, 
6 = fl' — fl0, c = fl — flx
A = i1} 
B = 180° — i, C = i'.
Now the analogies of Delambre may be written in the single formula, easily 
remembered,
sin {45° ± (45° -+ a)} = sin {45° + (45° - |B“±Z)}
sin (45° + (45° - j c)} 
cos {45° + (45° -1C)}
where the ambiguities + + must be read consistently but independently in 
two sets of three. Hence taking (1) all lower signs, (2) all + signs, (3) all 
— signs and (4) all upper signs in the above formula, we have
sin 2 (fl' — fl0 + to — to') sin |i' = sin | (fl — flx) sin | (i + i'i)
cos ’ (fl' — fl0 + co — co') sin 1i' = cos | (fl — flx) sin | (i —
sin | (fl' — fl0 — co + co') cos |i' = sin | (fl - flx) cos | (i +1\)
COS | (fl' — fl0 — ft) + ft)') cos |i' = cos | (fl — flj cos | (i —1\).
These formulae will serve directly if for example it is required to refer the 
elements of a minor planet to the plane of Jupiter’s orbit instead of to the 
ecliptic. Or again, if fl, on and i are the elements referred to the ecliptic 
and equinox at the date T and fl', a> and i' the elements for the equinox 
T +t, we may put flj = nn = ir\ and fl0 = Hi + where -fa is the general 
precession. Hence when these quantities are known the effect of precession 
is given by
tan|(fl' - Hj - 
- Aco) = tan|(fl - IL) sin |(i + iri)lsin |(i - wx)
tan | (fl' - Ih - i/ri + Aco) = tan | (fl - IL) cos | (i + iri)/cos | (i - 7rx)

68. 
When the interval t is moderately short, however, these rigorous 
equations for the effect of precession are not required and it is more con­
venient to use differential formulae. We now consider 7 AB as the fixed 
ecliptic of 1850.0 and 71A C as a variable ecliptic. Since
cos C = sin A sin B cos c — cos A cos B
— sin C. dC = (cos A sin B cos c + sin A cos B) dA — sin A sin B sin c. de
= sin C cos b. dA — sin a sin B sin Cdc
or 
dC= — cos b. dA 4- sin a sin B. de.......................(1)
Also, since
sin C sin b = sin B sin c
sin C cos b.db = sin B cos c. de — cos C sin b. dC
= sin B (cos c — cos C sin a sin b) de 4- cos C sin b cos b. dA 
or
sin C .db = cos (7 sin b. dA 4- sin B cos a. de .................................(2)
Similarly, since
sin C sin a = sin A sin c
sin C cos a. da — cos A sin c. dA 4- sin A cos c. de — cos C sin a. dC

or 
sin C. da = sin b. dA 4- sin A cos b. de .................(3)
By a slight change of notation we now put fl0, cu0 and t0 for the elements 
at T = 1850.0, D, cd and i for the elements at time T 4-1 (instead of 11', co' 
and i') and define the position of the ecliptic and equinox at T 4-1 relative to 
those at T by fl] = II, = 7r and fl0 = II 4- ty, so that
a = ct>0 — co, b = fl — II — i/r, c = fl0 — II
A=7t, 
£ = 180°-t0, C=i.
Hence by substitution in (1), (2) and (3)

But in the coefficients of dll we may put i = i0, to = to0 and ir = 0, this being 
the mutual inclination of the fixed and moving ecliptic. Hence we have 
simply
di /dt = — cos (fl — n — -^r) dirldt
dCL/dt = dty/dt + coti sin (H — H — >|r) dirldt 
dto I dt = — cosec i sin (H — n — \|r) dir/dt.
These are to be integrated between t = tx and t = 4, and the coefficients of 
dir I dt are variable with the time. Provided the interval is no more than a 
few years, it is sufficiently accurate to proceed thus. Writing
4 = ii - (t2 - Q cos (fl - n - ty) dir/dt
+ (4 - ti) {d^r/dt 4- cot i sin (11 — H — ty) dir/dt]
&>2 = 
— (t2 — ti) cosec i sin (H — H — -x|r) dir/dt
we take H + yfr, dir/dt and d-^/dt from appropriate tables (e.g. Bauschinger’s 
Tafeln, No. xxx) with the argument T + 
+ ti). With 11 = 12j and i =
approximate values of 112, i2 can be obtained and the calculation is then 
repeated with the corresponding values |(Di + H2), 
+ i2) substituted for
11 and i.
69. It is impossible to correct the first observations of a moving body 
for parallax in the ordinary way because its distance is unknown. But the 
line of observation intersects the plane of the ecliptic in a certain point, 
called by Gauss the locus fictus, the position of which can be calculated. If 
the observation is then treated as though made from this point the effect of 
parallax is allowed for and also the latitude of the Sun.
Let the observation be made at sidereal time T at a place whose geo­
centric latitude is <£>. Let a, S be the observed R.A. and declination, reduced 
to mean equinox. The geocentric equatorial coordinates of the place of 
observation are (p cos </> cos T, p cos </> sin T, p sin 0), p being the Earth’s radius 
at the place, and the corresponding ecliptic coordinates (pAj, p/^, pAs), where
Ai = cos I cos b = cos </> cos T
As = sin I cos b = cos </> sin T cos e0 + sin </> sin e0
A3 = sin b = sin </> cos e0 — cos </> sin T sin e0
e0 being the obliquity of the ecliptic and I, b the longitude and latitude of 
the Zenith. Similarly
Hx = cos X cos = cos S cos a
H2 = sin X cos = cos S sin a cos e0 + sin 8 sin e0
Hs = sin $= sin 3 cos e0 — cos 8 sin a sin e0
are the direction cosines of the line of observation, X, being the geocentric 
longitude and latitude of the observed object. The Nautical Almanac gives
L, and Bi the geocentric radius vector, longitude and latitude of the Sun.

72 
The Orbit in Space 
[ch. vi
Hence in heliocentric ecliptic coordinates the equation of the line of obser­
vation is

where A is the distance from the place of observation to the point (x, y, z) 
positively in the direction away from the object. If then this line intersects 
the plane of the ecliptic in the point (the locus fictus)
x = — R cos L, y = — R sin L, z = 0
A = (A3p — Rx sin B^{H3
— R cos L= — R1 cos Zj cos + phA — (h3p — Ri sin Bi) HJH3 
— R sin Z = — Ri sin Zj cos B1 + ph2 — (hsp — R1 sin B^) H2/H3.
But these exact equations can be simplified, regard being had to the small 
quantities involved. For Bj < 1" in general, so that sin B1 = B1, cos Bj = 1. 
Also we may put p =pRA where p is the solar parallax, 8"’8O. Hence writing 
B = Bi + Z = Zj + dL1} we have
A = R1 (hsp - B^ / H3
— cos Zj. dR1 + Bj sin . dLx =pRaha — (h3p — BO R^H^Hs
— sin Zj. dRx — Ri cos Zj. dLT =pRih2 — (h3p — Bi) RXH2IH3 
whence
— dRJRi —p{ha cos + h2 sin Zj) — (h3p — Bi) cos LA + H2 sin Li)fH3 
dLx = p (ha sin LA — h2 cos Zj) — (h3p — Bi) sin — H2 cos ZJ/ H3 
or again
— dRifRi —p cos b cos (Zj — I) — (p sin b — Bi) cos (Zj — X) cot ft 
dLi = p cos b sin (Lx — r) — (psinb — Bi) sin (Zj - X) cot ft 
A/ B2 = (jp sin & — BO/sin ft.
Here both p and Bj are naturally expressed in seconds of arc. Thus dL1, the 
additive correction to the Sun’s longitude, is appropriately expressed in the 
same unit. The Nautical Almanac gives logBj, to which the additive 
correction is
d. !og 
[4-3234 - 10].
Finally, had the observation actually been made from the locus fictus it 
would have been made later in time by the interval required for light to 
travel the distance A. But the light equation, or the time over the mean 
distance from the Sun to the Earth, is 4988,5. Hence the additive correction 
to the time of observation is (in seconds)
dt = 
[7'3832 -10].
The reduction to the locus fictus is a refinement rarely employed in practice.

CHAPTER VII
CONDITIONS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF AN ELLIPTIC ORBIT
70. There are certain properties of the apparent motion of a planet or 
comet on the celestial sphere which bear on the problem of determining the 
true orbit and which can be considered with advantage apart from the details 
of numerical calculation which are necessary for a practical solution. They 
are closely connected with the direct method of solution devised by Laplace, 
but they equally contain principles which are fundamental to all methods.
Let (x, y, z) be the heliocentric coordinates of the planet, (X, Y, Z) the 
heliocentric coordinates of the Earth. Then
x = — pxfr3, ...
X — — p^XfR3, ...
/z = k2 (1 4- m), p0 = k2 (1 4- m0)
m and m0 being the masses of the planet and the Earth. Let (a, b, c) be the 
corresponding geocentric direction cosines of the planet, so that
x = X + ap, y—Y + bp, z = Z + cp........................ (1)
p being the geocentric distance of the planet. The observed position of the

These formulae, which apply equally to the declinations, mutatis mutandis, 
are only correct if the observations are made at very short intervals of time 
and are ideally accurate. Since the accuracy of observations has practical 
limitations, moderately long intervals must be used and a greater number 
of observed places is necessary for satisfactory results. Our immediate 
concern, however, is rather with general principles than practical methods 
of calculation.

The mass of the planet, m, must be neglected in a first approximation to the 
orbit and this is one relation between p and r. In essence it is fundamental 
in all general methods of finding an approximate orbit. A second relation 
is available because we know the angle between R and p, namely
r*  = R? + p2 + 2Rp cos yfr.................................... (4)
while the projection of R as a vector in the direction of p gives
R cos yfr = aX + bY + cZ, (0 < >|r < 180°).
If r be eliminated between (3) and (4) an equation of the eighth degree in 
p results, and it will be necessary to examine the nature of the possible roots. 
For the moment we suppose that the appropriate value of p has been found. 
Then the corresponding value of p is given by (2) and the components of the 
velocity can be calculated, since by (1)
x=X+dp + dp, y=Y+bp + bp, z = Z 4- cp 4- cp........... (5)
where X, Y, Z must be found from the solar ephemeris by mechanical 
differentiation. Thus when p and p are known, (1) and (5) give the three 
heliocentric coordinates of the planet and the three corresponding components 
of velocity at a given time t. From these data the elements of the planet’s 
orbit, assumed for the present purpose to be elliptic, can be calculated without 
difficulty.
73. 
Since equatorial coordinates have been used hitherto, the elliptic 
elements of the orbit will also be referred to the equatorial plane. If new 
coordinates (£, ??, f) be taken so that the axis of £ passes through the node 
and the axis of f through the N. pole of the orbit, the transformation scheme 
is (cf. § 65):

Hence in the plane of the orbit, 
f = x sin fl' sin i' — y cos fl' sin ?' + z cos % = 0 
£ = x sin fl' sin i' — y cos fl' sin if + z cos i' = 0

Thus V and x> as well as r and u, are determined. Now if w is the true 
anomaly at the point, the polar equation of the orbit gives
p = r (1 + e cos w) .................................(11)
p cot x = re sin w .............................................(12)
since tan x = rdwfdr. But the constant of areas is
h = Vr sin x = V(/^p) = k >jp ............................ (13)
giving p and hence e and w. The mean distance a can be deduced from the 
known values of p and e, or directly from the relation
V2 = 2p/r — p/a .........................................(14)
and the mean motion n from the equation p = k~ = ??2a3. Also the element id-' 
is given by ts = fl' + u — w. Finally the epoch of perihelion passage is deter­
mined by the two equations
tan J A = 
tan | w
n(t— T) = E — e sin E.........................................(15)
E being the eccentric anomaly at the point of the orbit observed.
74. 
We now return to the consideration of the solution of equations (3) 
and (4), following the method of Charlier, which gives the clearest view of 
the geometrical conditions of the problem. The first of these equations is 
based on the assumption that the point of observation is. moving under 
gravity about the Sun. The point which so moves is in reality the centre 

73-75] 
of an Elliptic Orbit 
77
of gravity of the Earth-Moon system and, strictly speaking, the observations 
should be reduced to this point and not the centre of the Earth. But this is 
a matter of detail which our immediate purpose does not require us to stop 
and consider. Similarly we may neglect the mass of the Earth as well as that 
of the planet and put R = 1. Then the equations become simply
Zp = l —1/r3..................................................... (16)
r2= 1 + 2p cos-^r + p2 .....................................(17)
where I and -ft are known. The position of the planet becomes known when 
either p or r has been found, and it is simpler to eliminate p. Thus
. l~r
*
 = Pr8 + 21t3(t3 — 1) cos ijr + (r3 — I)2 
or
Z2r8 — (l2 + 21 cosijr + 1) r®+ 2 (Z cos\Jr + 1) r3 — 1 = 0 .......(18)
Now the coefficient of r3 is
2 (Z cos + 1) = {(1 — 1/r3) (r2 — 1 — p2) + 2p2]/p2
- [(1 - 1 A-3) (r*  - 1) + p*  (1 + 1/»W
which is obviously positive, whether r is greater or less than 1. And the 
coefficient of r6 is essentially negative. Hence, by Descartes’ rule of signs, 
there are at most three positive roots and one negative root. The latter 
certainly exists because the last term is negative (the equation being of 
even degree), and two positive roots must satisfy the equation, namely +1 
(corresponding to the Earth’s orbit) and the root required. There must 
be a fourth real root, and therefore in all three real and positive roots, one 
real and negative root and four imaginary roots. But the third positive 
root may or may not satisfy the problem.
Now by (16) r is greater or less than 1 according as Z is positive or 
negative. If then the two roots which are in question lie on opposite sides 
of 1, the spurious root can be detected and a unique solution of the problem 
can be found. But if they lie on the same side, they cannot be discriminated 
between in this way, and an ambiguity exists. If we divide (18) by (r — 1), 
we obtain
f (r) = Z2r® (r + 1) — (2Zr3cos + r3 - 1) (r2 + r + 1) = 0.
Thus
/(0) = + l, /(+l) = 2Z(Z-3cosi/r)
so that the roots are separated by +1, and a unique solution exists, if 
Z (Z — 3 cos ijr) is negative.
75. The geometrical interpretation is instructive. The equation (16) 
for different values of the parameter Z represents a family of curves in bipolar 
coordinates, the poles being E (the Earth) for p and (the Sun) for r. The 
planet lies at the intersection of one of these curves with a straight line

78

drawn through E in a given direction. But there may be two intersections, 
and this will happen if f (4- 1) or
p2l (I - 3 cos i|r) = (1 - 1/r3) [1 — 1/r34- f (1 +p2-^)}
is positive. This expression changes sign when we cross the circle r = 1 and 
again when we cross the curve
l-l/r’ + f (l+p2-^) = 0.
Putting p2 = 1 + r2 — 2r cos <£> we get for the polar equation of this curve with 
the origin at £
4 - 3r cos </> = 1/r3 .................................... (19)
or in rectangular coordinates,
r®(4 —3a?)=l
showing that the curve has an asymptote 3a? = 4. Moving the origin to E 
we find at once that E is a node, the tangents being y=±2x. The whole 
curve consists of a loop crossing the SE axis at the point r = ‘5604, <f> = tt, and 
an asymptotic branch, and is shown as the “ limiting ” curve in the figure. 
The plane of the figure is that containing S, E and P (the planet); it is 
only necessary to show the curves on one side of the axis because this is one 
of symmetry.
A few curves of the family (16) are also shown in the figure, for values 
of I which indicate sufficiently the different forms. When I = 0 we have the 
circle r = 1, called here the “ zero ” circle. It is evident that when I is 
negative r < 1 and the curve lies entirely within the zero circle, while when I 
is positive r > 1 and the curve lies entirely outside this circle. When I has 
a large negative value, the curve consists of a simple loop surrounding £ and 
an isolated conjugate point at E. As — I decreases from oo the loop increases 
in size until, when I — — 3, the loop extends to E, where there is a cusp. 
Afterwards as I approaches 0 the loop, still passing through E, approximates 
more and more closely to the zero circle.
When I is positive the form of the curves is rather more complicated. It 
must be remarked that I cannot be greater than 4-3. For
. 
I = (r3 — 1 j/'Pp = (r-14- r~2 4- r-3) (r — 1 )/p.
But r > 1 and r — 1 < p. Hence the limit is established and we have only to 
follow the values of I from 4- 3 to 0. At first the curve consists of a small 
loop passing through E. As the value of I falls the loop expands, tending 
to enfold the zero circle. Finally, when I = 4- 0’2959, it reaches the axis again 
and forms a node on the further side of & As the value of I falls still further 
the curve breaks up into two distinct loops. The larger continues to expand 
outwards at all points and recedes to infinity, while the inner, always passing 
through E, contracts until finally it becomes the zero circle. These features 
in the development of the family of curves will be evident in the figure.

80 
Conditions for the Determination [ch. vii
It will now be apparent that the limiting curve and the zero circle divide 
space into certain regions and that the solution of the problem of determining 
an orbit by the method indicated is unique or not according to the region in 
which the planet happens to be. Thus we distinguish four cases:
(1 ) If the planet is within the loop of the limiting curve there are two 
solutions.
(2 ) In the space between the loop and the zero circle the solution is 
unique.
(8 ) Outside the zero circle and to the left of the asymptotic branch of 
the limiting curve there are again two solutions.
(4 ) If the planet lies to the right of the asymptotic branch of the 
limiting curve only one solution is possible. It happens that newly dis­
covered minor planets are usually observed near opposition and therefore 
this is the case which most commonly occurs.
76. There is another curve which has considerable importance in the 
problem of determining an orbit by a method of approximation and to which 
Charlier has given the name of the “singular” curve. We may find it thus. 
If we eliminate r between the equations (16) and (17) we have
Ip = 1 — (1 + 2p cos "i/r + p2) ~ 7
which is an equation giving the values of p for a line drawn through E in 
the direction -xjr. Two of the values become equal and the line touches the 
curve (16) if
I = 3 (cos 1/r + p) (1 + 2p COS l/r + p2) ” *
= 3 (cos -xjr + p)/rr\
Hence the locus of the points of contact of the tangents from E to the family 
of curves (16) is
(1 — I/?"3)/p = 3 (cos yfr + py/r5 
or
2r2 (r5 - 1) = 3 (p2 + r2 - 1) 
or again
3p2 = 2r° - or2 + 3 ................................ (20)
This is the equation of the singular curve. If we change from bipolar 
coordinates to the polar equation with the origin at 8, we obtain
3(1 -2rcos</> + r2) = 2r5-5r2 + 3 
or
r3 = 4 — 3 cos </>/r........................................ (21)
Comparison of this form with the equation (19) of the limiting curve shows 
at once that these two curves are the inverse of one another with respect to 

75-77] 
of an Elliptic Orbit 
81
the zero circle. From this relation the form of the singular curve, which is 
shown in figure 3, becomes apparent.
The importance of the singular curve arises thus. In general a line 
through E meets a curve of the family (16) either in one point (besides E) 
or in two distinct points'. In the latter case the coordinates of the planet 
are regular functions of the time and can be expanded in powers of the time, 
but each is expressed by two distinct series between which it is impossible to 
discriminate. When, however, the planet is situated at a point on the singular 
curve, the two distinct series coalesce and each point of the singular curve 
corresponds to a branch point where we may expect the coordinates of the 
planet to be no longer regular functions of the time. This is in fact the 
case. Charlier obtained the equation of the singular curve by noticing that 
along this curve expansion of the coordinates as power series in the time 
ceases to be possible.
77. If the masses of the Earth and of the planet be neglected, (2) may 
be written in the form
-p 2p t-(l/r»-l/g)
A, A, A, ................................
where A,, A2, Ay represent three determinants and 1 = ^3/k2^. It is clear, 
as we have already noticed, that r < R if I is negative and r> R if I is
positive. Now the equation of the plane of the great circle tangent to the 
apparent orbit at (a, b, c) is
.........................................(23)
a
b
b y
c c z
The coordinates of the Sun on the celestial sphere are (— X/R, — Y/R, — ZjR) 
and of a neighbouring point to (a, b, c) on the apparent orbit (a + at + %dt2, 
&+..., c+...). Hence the ratio of the perpendiculars from these points to 
the above plane is - A1/j?-^|i2A3 = - 2jlk2t2R. Thus I is negative if the 
Sun and the arc of the planet’s orbit lie on the same side of the great circle 
touching the orbit, and positive if the Sun and the arc are on opposite sides. 
In the first case r < R, in the second r > R. Hence we have the theorem 
due to Lambert, which may be expressed by saying that an arc of the orbit 
of an inferior planet appears concave to the corresponding position of the 
Sun, but the arc described by a superior planet appeal’s convex. This test 
makes it immediately apparent whether a planet or the Earth is the nearer 
to the Suh.
It may happen that A3 vanishes. It is then necessary to express 
the coordinates of neighbouring points on the orbit to the third order

and the double sign shows that the curve crosses the tangent great circle. In 
the language of plane geometry there is a point of inflexion on the apparent 
orbit. Now if A3 vanishes either r=R or Aj = 0. Thus such a point of 
inflexion occurs either when a comet reaches the same distance from the Sun 
as the Earth or when the great circle which touches the orbit of a planet 
passes through the position of th A Sun.
78. When the apparent orbit of a planet reaches a stationary point the 
curve either crosses itself and forms a loop, or without crossing itself it pursues 
a twisted path, passing through a point of inflexion. At such a point, as we 
have just seen, the tangent in general passes through the Sun. There is a 
related theorem, due to Klinkerfues, which applies to the case of a loop. 
Let Pn P2, P3 be three positions of the planet in space, Elt E2, E3 the corre­
sponding positions of the Earth and 8 the position of the Sun. If the first 
and third positions correspond to the double point on the loop, E}J\ and E3P3 
are parallel and lie in one plane. Let SP2 meet the chord PjP3 in p2 and SE2 
meet the chord A’]A3 in e2. If is the time taken to describe PXP2 or E^E2 
and t2 the time along P2P3or E2E2, : t2 is the ratio of the sectors SP^P2, 
SP2P3 or very nearly the ratio-of the triangles SP'p2, Sp2P3, that is 
P1P2 • But similarly tx : t2 is nearly equal to the ratio E^ : e2E3. 
Hence PXP3 and EXE3 are divided by p2 and e2 in approximately the same 
ratio and therefore e2p2 is parallel to E^l\ and E3P3. Consequently the 
three planes E^SP^, E2e2Sp2P2, E3SP3 have a common line of intersection, 
namely the line through £ parallel to Ef\ and E3P3. But on the geocentric 
sphere these three planes correspond to three intersecting great circles. The 
first and third intersect in P, the double point on the apparent orbit. Hence 
the great circle joining any intermediate point on the loop to the corre­
sponding position of the Sun also passes through the double point, at least 
very approximately.
It may be inferred then that if any three points on such a loop be joined 
to the corresponding positions of the Sun, the three great circles will meet in 
one point which is also a point on the apparent orbit.
79. 
There is some interest in finding the geometrical meaning of the 
three determinants A1} A2, A3 in (2) or (22). Bruns has noticed that 
A3 = V3k, where k is the geodetic curvature of the apparent orbit on the 
sphere and V the velocity in this orbit at the point (a, b, c), so that
V2 = d2+ b2 + c\

77-80]

83
But we shall now express these determinants in terms of the small circle 
of closest contact or circle of curvature. This passes through the points 
(a, b, c), (a + at, b + bt,c + ct) and (a + at'+ ^at'2, b + ..., c +...), and the 
equation of its plane is
x y z 
a b c 
a b c
= 0
a b c 0
or
x (be - be) + y (cd - cd) 4- z (db — ab) = A3....................(24)
Now
a2 + b2 4- c - = 1
ad 4- bb 4- co = 0
ad 4- bb 4- cc = — V2
by successive differentiation. Solving these as linear equations in a, b, c, we 
obtain
a A;, = bc- be — V2 (be — be)
and two similar equations. But (a/ V, b/ V, c/ V) are the direction cosines of 
the point Pi on the tangent 90c from (a, b, c), and the pole of the tangent is 
(a0, b0, c0) where
Va0 = bc — be, Vb0 = cd— ca, Vc0 = ab - db 
so that
be — be = aA3 4- F3a0, • • • 
and
S (be — be)2 = A32 4- VK.
The equation of the circle of curvature (24) becomes then
(aA3 4- a0F3) x 4- (6A3 4- fe0F3) y 4- (cA3 4- c0F3) z = A3.
Hence, if w is the angular radius of this circle,
cos2 O) = A32/( A32 4- F6)
and therefore
A3 = F3 cot co.
This then is the geometrical meaning of the third determinant.
80. 
Next we take A2. If (J., B, C) are the geocentric direction cosines 
of the Sun, X = - AR, Y=-BR,Z=-CR and
A2 = — R (J. (be — bc)+B (cd — ca) + C (ab — ab)}
= — R^[A (be — be) + B(cd — ca) + C(ab — ab)}
= -R^i[V(Aaa + Bbl, + Cc.)]
= - RV(Aa0 + Bb0 + Cco)- RV(Ado + Bb0+ Cc0).

84 Conditionsfor the Determination of an Elliptic Orbit [ch. vii
Here A, B, C are of course constants. Now (a0, &0, c0) is the pole Po of the 
tangent at P, (a, b, c). The arc PP0 passes through the centre of the circle 
of curvature and while P is initially describing a circle of angular radius to 
about this centre Po is describing a circle of radius 90° — to about the same 
centre. If the velocity of Po, which is in the direction of the pole of PP0 
opposite Pn is V,
V'/cos to = 7/sin <o, d0/ V' = — d/V, b0/V' = — b/V, c^V' = — c/V.
Hence
A2 = Ai V/V+ R V cot to (Ad + Bb + Cc).
Again
Ai = - RV (Aa„ + P&o + C'co)
= - RV cosSP0 = - PKsin r
S being the position of the Sun on the sphere, and r the perpendicular arc 
from 8 to the tangent PPX at P to the apparent orbit (positive if drawn from 
the same side of PPi as Po or the centre of curvature). Also
Ad + Bb + Cc=V cos 8P1 = V sin v
where v is the perpendicular arc from $ to the normal PP0 to the apparent 
orbit at P (positive if drawn from the same side of PP0 as Pj). Hence
A2 = — R V sin t + RV2 cot to sin v.
Thus the geometrical significance of the three determinants has been 
determined and we may write (2) in the form
p == /x/r3 - p0/R3
R V sin t R ( V2 cot sin v — V sin r) V3 cot
which shows in the clearest way how this method of determining the orbit 
depends on a knowledge of the simple quantities V, V, r, v and to, which can 
be specified without reference to any particular axes. To these must be joined 
the equation (4), which enjoys the same property.
It has been remarked (§ 75) that I cannot be greater than +3. Now
I = A3/PAj = — V2 cot (ofk2R sin r.
Hence for a superior planet,
V2 < 3k2R | tan to sin r |
which sets a limit to the apparent velocity when to and t are known, or to the 
curvature of the path when V and r are known.

CHAPTER VIII
DETERMINATION OF AN ORBIT. METHOD OF GAUSS
81. 
Since a planetary orbit requires for its complete specification six 
elements, it is to be expected that three positions of the planet, i.e. three 
pairs of coordinates, observed at known times, will suffice to determine its 
path. And this is in general true, though there are exceptional circumstances 
in which further observations may be necessary. The formulae are a little 
simpler when ecliptic coordinates are employed, and though this is not 
essential we shall take as the data of the problem:
the times of observation 
the longitudes of the planet 
the latitudes of the planet 
the longitudes of the Earth 
the Earth’s radii vectores
ty, t2, t3
3i> 3a, 3s 
ILjj T2, -2>3 
Ri, R2, R3.
The angular coordinates are referred to a fixed equinox which will apply to 
the resulting elements. The Earth’s longitude (which differs by 180° from 
the Sun’s longitude) and radius vector can be derived from the Nautical 
Almanac or other national ephemeris: the Earth’s latitude can be neglected, 
or, if desired, allowed for by using the method of the locus fictus (§ 69).
At the time U let be the heliocentric distance of the planet and pi its 
geocentric distance. Referred to a fixed system of rectangular axes through 
the Sun let yi, z{) be the coordinates of the planet, (Ait Bi} Ci) the 
direction cosines of Ri and (u(-, bi} Ci) the direction cosines of pi} so that
Xi=aipi + AiRi, yi = bipi + BiRi, zi = cipi + CiRi.

These are the fundamental equations expressing the condition for a plane 
orbit. From them one pair of the six. quantities p,-, R; can be eliminated in 
fifteen ways. The result immediately required is obtained by eliminating 
Pj and p3, namely

where the determinants are indicated by their first lines, from which the 
second and third lines are to be obtained by changing the letters without 
changing the suffixes, e.g.

We have now to notice that these

from the points (Ax, Bly Ci), (a2, b2, ci), (A2, B2, C2) and (A3, B3, Cs)-, and these 
are the representative points of the directions of R1} p2, R2, R3 on the sphere 
of unit radius. The perpendiculars to the plane are therefore the sines of the 
perpendicular arcs to the great circle through (cq, blt ci), (a3, b3, c3) and if these 
arcs are Bi, /32', B2', B3' respectively (due regard being paid to sign) our 
equation becomes
[r,r,] P2 sin fti = [r2r3] R1 sin Bi - [r, r3] R2 sin B2' + 
Rs sin B3'.. .(4)
83. The points on the sphere just named are E1} E2, E3, representing 
the heliocentric directions of the Earth and lying on the ecliptic, and Plf P2, P3, 
representing the geocentric directions of the planet. The great circle men­
tioned is PiP3. Let this circle intersect the ecliptic in longitude H2 and at 
the inclination t)2. Then we have the same relation between any one of the 
perpendicular arcs and the longitude (reckoned from H2) and latitude of the 
point from which it is drawn as exists between the latitude of a point and its

by t)2. That is to say,
sin fi2 = cos ??2 sin /32 — sin % cos /Z sin (X2 — H2)
sin = 
— sin sin (Zj — H2)
sin B2 = 
— sin t]2 sin (L2 — H2)
sin B3 =

0 = cos 7]., sin - sin t]2 cos /?, sin (X! — H2)

The latter give, by addition and subtraction,

(Xi + Xa) - II2\ = sin (/Z + /33)/cos ft cos ft3 cos | (X3 - Xj)
2 tan 7]2 cos 
(X! + X2) — H2] = sin (ft. — ftO/cos ft1 cos ft, sin | (X3 — X^
and determine tj2 and H2. We now put

and
= DvJ/ki »’3], 
r2]/[r| r3].
The equation (4) then takes the simple form
p2 = — Cf??! + c2 — c3ns.
Now this is a purely geometrical relation involving the intersections of any 
plane through the Sun with three lines drawn in given directions through 
the positions of the Earth. If we imagine the plane to move into coincidence 
with the ecliptic, cn c2, c3 remain unaltered while in the limit p2, p3 vanish 
and ru r2, r3 become coincident with Ri, R2, R3. Hence if we put
Ni = [Z2Rs]/[Ri Z3] = R2 sin (Z3 — L^)jRi sin (Z3 — Lx)
N3 = [Zj R2~]/[Ri Z3] = R2 sin (L2 — Li)jR3 sin (Z, — /<)
the equation
0 = -c1W1 + c2-c3W3
must' be an identity, and this can be verified. Hence by the elimination of c2 
p2 = Ci (Ni - 7ii) + c3 (Ns - ??3)................................ (5)
which is the required equation for p2.
84. 
Since ft2' is the perpendicular arc from P2 to PiPs it is geometrically 
evident that if the observed arcs of the planet’s orbit are of the first order of 
small quantities (and we assume them to be small) ft/ is a quantity of the 
second order. Hence the equation (4) shows that if we are to obtain a value 
of p2 which is a real approximation and not merely illusory we must at the 
outset employ values of the ratios of the triangles which are correct to the 

88 
Determination of an Orbit

It is necessary to neglect the mass of the planet and put p = k2‘. this can 
safely be done in calculating a preliminary orbit, for which the perturbations 
are entirely neglected. The equation (5) for p2 therefore becomes
= ko — lofr^ ......................................................................(8)
where k0, Zo are completely determined quantities. But if 82 is the angle 
(< 180°) between p2 and R2 produced,
r22 = R22 + p22 + 2R.2p2 cos 82 ............................... (9)
where
cos 82 = cos P2 E2 = cos /32 cos (\> — Z2).
If now p2 be eliminated from (8), which corresponds to the definite form of 
Lambert’s theorem (§ 77), and (9), an equation of the eighth degree in r2 
results. The nature of the roots of this form of equation has already been 
discussed in § 74. But Gauss replaced the eliminant by a much simpler 
equation which is easily found. We have
r2 
p2___  
(TO)
sinS2 sin,? sin(S2 — z) ............................... v 7
where z is the angle subtended by R2 at the planet in its intermediate 
observed position. Hence by (8)
Asin (S2 — z} _ , Zo sin3 z 
sin,? 0 JR23sin382 
or
4 sin4 z\ R23 sin3 82 = — R2 sin (82 — z) + k0 sin z
and therefore if we put
7n0 cos q = k0 + R2 cos 82
m0 sin q = R2 sin 82
mm0 = l^R3 sin3 82
where 7n0 is given the same sign as Zo, we have the simple form
m sin4 z = sin (z — q)........................................(11) 

84, 85] 
Method of Gauss 
■ 
89
and this is the equation of Gauss. This form of equation does not avoid the 
possibility of an ambiguity arising from two distinct roots, which is inherent 
in the problem. But when only one appropriate root exists, it is easily found 
by successive approximation. In the most common case, that of a minor 
planet observed near opposition, z — q is small and a first approximate value is 
given by
z1 = q + m sin4 q.
When z is found the corresponding first approximations to p2 and r2 are given 
by (10).
85. We have now to find the corresponding values of px and p3. For 
this purpose we return to the equations (1), (2) and (3), and eliminate 
p3 and 7^3. The result can be written down at once in the form
[w] Pi | Ou O3, 213 I 4- [?’2r3] Rx I Ax, O3,213| = »3]p2|a2,O3,213|4-[r1r3]Z2|212,O3,213| 
or
HiPi | Cfi, «3, A314- 71^1 Ax, a3, AI = p21 a2, a3, A3 ' 4- R21 A2y a3, A3|
where the determinants as before are represented by their first lines, the 
other rows being obtained by change of letters without change of suffixes. 
Since the same form of equation must remain true, the directions of pn p2, p3 
being preserved, when the plane of the orbit is made to coincide with the 
ecliptic, in which case p1 = p.2 = O and nx becomes Nx, the equation
NXRX1 Alr o3, -/131 = R21A2, o3, A31
must be an identity. Hence
ihPi |

Similarly the result of eliminating p± and from the original equations is 
to give (interchanging the suffixes 1 and 3)

The coefficients Mi, M3, M3 as well as N\, N3 are constants throughout 
the process of approximation, hut nn n3 must he taken at this stage from the 
approximate forms (6) and (7). Then (12) and (13) give values of p± and p3 
corresponding to the approximate value of p2 already obtained.
86. The heliocentric distances, longitudes and latitudes of the planet are 
next deduced by the formulae
Tt cos bi cos (li —

ri cos bi sin (Zf — Li) = pt cos & sin (X,- — Li)
........... (14)
r.i sin bi = p{ sin fit
(2 = 1, 2, 3), which are at once found by taking the axis of sc successively along 
Rlt R2 and R3, the axis of z being always directed towards the pole of the 
ecliptic. But these coordinates give the position of the plane of the orbit, for
tan i sin (Zj — LL) = tan b± 
tan i sin (Z3 — LL) = tan b3
where i is the inclination and LL the longitude of the node; or in a form more 
suitable for calculation
2 tan i sin (Zj + Z3) — £2} = sin (bx + Z>3)/cos cos b3 cos | (Z3 — ZJ)
> (15)
2 tan i cos (Zj + ZJ — 
= sin (b3 — Z>J/cos b± cos b3 sin | (Z3 — li)J
And now the three arguments of latitude uj, giving the differences of the true 
anomalies, can be calculated, for
tan Uj = tan (lj — LL) sec i ................................ (16)
(j = 1, 2, 3). In the case of a comet, it is the practice to take Uj< or > 180° 
according as the latitude is positive or negative; in the case of a planet, Uj is 
placed in the same quadrant as lj — LL. If we calculate n3 from
_ r2 sin (w3 — m2) 
_ r2 sin (u2 — ui)
1 sin (u3 — vi) ’ 
3 r3 sin (u3 — ui)
we shall not obtain improved values of these ratios, because these equations 
have a purely geometrical basis and merely serve as a useful control on the 
accuracy of the calculation; the values already obtained should be reproduced.

Method of Gauss

87. We have now arrived at preliminary approximations to the values of 
the geocentric distances pn p2, Ps> the heliocentric distances r2, r3 and the 
arguments of latitude ult u3. From these quantities we might proceed to 
deduce a complete set of elements. But our results are not accurate for two 
reasons: (1) the effect of aberration has been ignored, and (2) the expressions 
(6) and (7) employed for and n3 were of necessity only approximate. The 
effect of aberration may be stated thus. The light observed at time t left the 
source whose distance is p at the time t — A£, where
Af = 498B-5 p/1 day = [776116] p
in days, 4988-5 being the light-time for unit astronomical distance. Had the 
source moved in the interval Atf uniformly with the velocity of the observer 
at time t, its position at time t would be correctly inferred from the observa­
tion, without correction, since in that case there is no relative motion between 
the source and the observer. If now we correct the observation for stellar 
aberration according to the ordinary rule the observer’s motion attributed to 
the source is eliminated and we have the direction of the observed body at 
time t — At from the observer’s position at time t. This is the most convenient 
procedure in the present case, because it enables us to retain the Earth’s 
coordinates (R, L) at the times of observation t throughout the calculation 
and to make no subsequent change in the planet’s observed coordinates (X, /?) 
supposing them to be corrected for stellar aberration at the outset. This 
avoids many changes which would otherwise be necessary in the calculation of 
subsidiary quantities. It only remains when approximate values of p become 
known to correct the time t by subtracting At in so far as these relate to 
actual positions in the orbit. In particular, the corresponding corrections 
must be applied to the time intervals t1} t2, t3.
88. A better approximation to the values of nlt n3 might now be made by 
using the formulae of Gibbs or those of § 62 and with these values the whole 
calculation might be repeated. But we proceed at once to introduce the 
accurate formulae for the ratio of the sector to the triangle, (25) and (26) of 
§ 55 in the case of an elliptic orbit. The sectors are
13/i [r2r3], 
[n r3], 13/s [rx r2]
and are proportional to t2, ts (now corrected for aberration). Hence

Determination of an Orbit 
[ch. viii
The corresponding equations for y1} ys can be written down by a symmetrical 
interchange of suffixes. Various methods have been devised for the convenient 
solution of these equations, generally involving the use of special tables.
In the absence of such tables, and they are not necessary, we may proceed 
thus. Writing the cubic equation in the form
Q (2g) = 0, Q (2g) = 3 (2g- sin 2g)/4 sm3g
where Q(2g) approaches the value 1 as g approaches the value 0, we compare 
it with the identity
(X3 - X-3) - 3 (X - X"1) - (X - X-1)3 = 0.
Thus y = c/(X — X-1) if
c3 _ c2 _ 4m2Q
X3 —X-3-3 | 3
that is, if c = 2m\!Q = J (X3 — X-3). Hence if X3 = cot 3mVQ = cot and if 
X = cot |y, y — m\/Q tan 7. But from the other equation in y we have 
sin tan S if y=wicos8/V^.
Accordingly we throw the equations in y into the following form : 
cot = 3mVQ 
* tan317 = tan 
cos 8 = \/(lQ) tan 7 
sin *g  = \/l. tan 8
Then, calculating the function Q with an approximate value g' of g, the result 
of solving these equations in turn is to lead to a new and closer approximation 
g". With this new value the process is repeated until no change is found 
between the initial and final values. The true value of g has then been 
arrived at, and finally (the value of £ being taken from the last repetition)
y = m cos
Since 2g is the difference between the eccentric anomalies, the first approxi­
mation to its value may be taken to be the difference between the true 
anomalies, that is, between the arguments of latitude. When 2g is small, as 
it usually is in the practical problem, the direct calculation of the function 
Q (2g) is inaccurate (cf. § 34). But if we write
log Q (%g) = 
lossec y ~ W logsec lg
the error committed is practically negligible when 2g < 90°, and the direct 
calculation only presents a difficulty when 2g is much smaller than this limit. 
The verification of this approximate formula may be left as an exercise.
It is unnecessary to repeat the solution of (19) until the value of g is 
exactly reproduced. This point may be explained in general terms as it is of 
wide application. Suppose the equations to be solved are y=p (x), x = q (y), 
p and 9 being any functions. These correspond to two curves P and Q. 
Starting with the approximate value we find yY =p(x^) and hence (xlt yT) 

88, 89]
Method of Gauss
93
the point on P. Next we find similarly (.t2, yj the point & on Q. This 
gives the new value x2 of x and with this we find successively (x2, y2) the 
point P2 on P and (x3, y2) the point Q2 on Q. But if the successive values 
a?i, x2, x3 do not differ greatly, the chords PAP2, QiQ2 lie close to the curves 
P and Q and their intersection nearly coincides with the intersection of the 
curves. In this way we find for the correction to the third value x3
& ^3 = 
~ ^1) 
03 — *^2)1  •
In the above case two solutions of (19) with application of the correction just 
indicated will generally suffice for the accurate determination of g and y.
89. When the values of y1; y2, y3 have been thus obtained we have new 
values of ?q and ?<.2 by (17). The next step is to recalculate p2 by (5) and 
Pi, P  by (12) and (13). Hence r2, r3 and llt l2, l3 by (14), new values of 
fl and i by (15) and finally ult u2, u3 by (16). This brings us back once more 
to the equations (18) in y. If the result of solving them with the improved 
values introduced is to leave ?q and n3 practically unaltered, our object is 
attained. Otherwise it is necessary to repeat the above steps until a satis­
factory agreement is reached.
*
When this stage has been arrived at the problem has been solved, and it 
only remains to calculate the other elements of the orbit, fl and i having 
been obtained in the last approximation. The three equations
p = Tj [1 + e cos {vj — &>)}, 
0 = 1, 2, 3)
are linear in p, e cos cd and e sin cd. The symmetrical solution gives
p = r,r2r3 S sin (u3 — u2)/X r2r3 sin (u3 — u2)
— e cos cd = X r2r3 (sin u3 — sin w2)/S r2r3 sin (u3 — u2)
esin cd = X r2r3(cos u3 — cos «2)/S r2r3sin(«»~ #2)
whence e = sin </>,&> = cr — fl and a=psec’ </>. This, however,is not the simplest 
solution. The areal velocity h = k\!p (§ 26) and hence
kr2 dp = [n r3] y2 = y21\ r3 sin (ji3 - iq)........................ (20)
Thus, p being known, we have
P + P-2
r3
= 2e cos | (iq + w3 — 2g>) cos |(u3 — iq)
■(21)
n r3
= 2e sin | (iq + u3 - 2&>) sin | (u3 — iq)
which also give e and cd. Finally, if the mass is neglected, the mean motion 
is n = tt'la?1* and the mean longitude at the epoch t0 is (§ 64)
where
e = cd + fl + Ej — e" sin Ej — n (tj —10)........................(22)
tan i Ej=+ tan $ (Uj - <»),
(j=l, 2 or 3).
The times tj are here corrected for aberration (§ 87).

CHAPTER IX
DETERMINATION OF PARABOLIC AND CIRCULAR ORBITS
90. The method explained in principle in the last chapter requires no 
assumption as to the eccentricity of the orbit. Its practical convenience is 
greatest, however, when the eccentricity is comparatively small. On the 
other hand the majority of comets move in orbits almost strictly parabolic. 
For these it is important to have approximate elements after the first 
observations have been secured, in order that an ephemeris may be calculated 
to guide observers as to the position of the object. For this purpose the 
method of Olbers (published in 1797), which depends on the assumption of a 
parabolic orbit, has continued in use to the present time. Although only 
five elements have in this case to be determined we still use three complete 
observations of the comet giving the longitude and latitude (Xj, /Bj) at the 
three times tj. We again take (Rj, Lj) as the corresponding radius vector 
and longitude of the Earth and pj the geocentric distance of the comet, so 
that as before
&j — ajpj 4" 
1 yt ~ bjPj 
— QjPj 4*  CjR/j.
Here (xj, i/j, zj) are the heliocentric coordinates of the comet, (<q, bj, Cj) the 
direction cosines of pj and (Aj, Bj, Cj) the direction cosines of Rj. In the 
ecliptic system of axes adopted,
aj = cos Xj cos /3j, bj = sin Xj cos /Bj, Cj = sin /Bj.
We shall express p3 in terms of px and for this purpose it is possible to 
eliminate p2 and R2 from (1), (2) and (3) in § 82. The same result may, 
however, be deduced from the condition that the orbit is plane in another way.
91. If $ is the Sun, Elt E2, E3 the three positions of the Earth, and 
Clt C2, C3 the three positions of the comet, 8, Clt C2, C3 are coplanar. Hence

But Euler’s equation gives
6k (t3 - ZJ = (i\ + r3 + c)= - (rj + r3 - c)-
and this must be satisfied by the appropriate value of p{ in (4), (5) and (6). 
This value must be found by a process of approximation and for a suitable 
starting point we may consider c small in comparison with r\ + r3, 
— r3
and 7^ = 1. Then
6k (t3 - Zj) = (rj + rif. Bc/fo + r3) = 3 ^2. c Vn

With approximate values of the numbers which occur in this equation it is 
easy to find by trial a value of pj which is correct at least to one decimal 
place. Then with this value of pA it is possible to calculate c in two ways: 
(i) directly Jby (6), (ii) through r1} r3 given by (4) and (5) and inserted in 
Euler’s equation, which may be written-(§ 52) in the form
3k (Z3 — ti)/\/2 (rx + r3)^ = sin W, c = 2 ^2 (rA + r3) sin .{0 V cos . .(7) 
or solved by special tables. Two values of c thus correspond to a hypo­
thetical value of p1} and the latter must be varied until the discrepancy 
between the former is made to disappear. A rule analogous to that given in 
§ 88 leads quickly to the desired value of px. For if the values pi, pi' lead 
successively to the differences AjC, A2c in c, it is easy to see that the value 
of Pj to be inferred is given by
Pi = Pi" + (pi' ~ pi) Aac/(AiC - A2c).
In ordinary cases the correct result is quickly obtained in this way.
93. When p1 and p3 = 71/pj have been obtained it only remains to de­
termine the elements of the orbit. The formulae of § 
86 are again
appropriate, namely
rj cos bj cos (lj — Lj) = pj cos /?; cos (Xj — Lj) + Rj
rj cos bj sin (lj — Lj) = pj cos sin (Xj — Lj)

which gives co = — 12 and also q, the perihelion distance. Finally, T being 
the time of perihelion passage, we have (§ 29)
T = fj — q% {tan | (tq — co) 4-1 tan3 |(zq — co)} V2/Z?........... (12)
(j = 1, 3). This completes the determination of the five elements.
94. It is to be noticed that while the first and third observations have 
been completely used, the second observation has only entered partially into 
the calculation. In fact the five elements have been determined from six 
given coordinates in a unique way because X2, /3.2 have not been used 
independently but only in the form cot/?2 sin (X, — Z2) in the equation (1) 
for M. Consequently it cannot be expected that the elements will satisfy 
the second place exactly and the magnitude of the discordance is an im­
mediate test of the derived orbit. The second place is therefore calculated 
by finding (§ 29) w2 = u2 — w from (12) (J = 2), r2 = 7 sec2 4?./'2, and hence the 
coordinates of the comet by means of
p2 cos /32 cos (X2 — 12) = r2 cos u.2 — R2 cos (Z2 — 12)
p2 cos /?2 sin (X2 — 12) = r2 sin «2 cos i — R2 sin (Z2 — 12)
p2 sin ^2 
= r2 sin u2 sin i.
If the residuals are small the elements may be considered satisfactory. If 
the residuals appear large, on the other hand, there are several possible 
reasons for the fact. There may be an error in the calculation, there may be 
an error in the observations, or the assumption of a parabolic orbit may be 
unjustified. The evidence of further observations must be the final test. 
But without additional material it is possible to improve the orbit obtained

by reconsidering the quantities which were ignored in the course of finding 
the first elements. Parallax and aberration may be allowed for. Jn the 
place of (3) may now be written
p3 = pi (M + m/pO
where M and m are given by (1) and the following equation. At this stage 
an approximate value of pv is known and [rarj/frirj can be calculated with 
greater accuracy than by means of (2), for example by the application of the 
formulae of Gibbs or by direct calculation of the areas, since the sides of the 
triangles and the included angles are now approximately known. Thus the 
approximate M in (3) can now be replaced by the improved value M -\-mjpy 
and the remainder of the work can be repeated from this point. There are, 
however, shorter practical methods of removing a discrepancy in the middle 
place, which serve the purpose well enough since a provisional orbit is in 
general all that is required.
95. The eccentricities of planetary orbits are in general small and hence 
a circular orbit may prove a useful approximation to the true path, just as a 
parabolic orbit is a useful preliminary step towards the orbit of a periodic 
comet. As the eccentricity vanishes and the position of perihelion ceases to 
have a meaning, the number of elements to be determined is reduced to four 
and two complete observations of position only are required. Thus if a 
minor planet has been found on two photographs of the sky and no other 
observations are immediately available, a search ephemeris based on a 
circular orbit may be a useful guide in examining other plates which may 
have been taken at the same or at other observatories.
To consider the problem in a general form let (Xlt Ylt ZJ, (X2, Y2, Z2) 
be the geocentric coordinates of the Sun at the times of observation tIr t2 
and let (Z1} ni), (l2, m2, n2) be the direction cosines of the observed 
directions of the planet. The axes may be any fixed system with the Sun 
at the origin. The planet is observed to lie. on the lines
(x + Xy)/^ = (y + Yi)lm1 = (z + Zi)/ni = p.
(x + X2)/l2 = (y + F2)/m2 = (z + Z2)/^ = p2

where 0 is the angle between the observed directions. Since 0 is a small

is unsuitable for its determination, but the proper modification depends on 
the choice of coordinates. Similarly n cannot be accurately determined 
from cos m.

A trial value of a gives, by (13), -^1, A and hence pn p2; these lead to a 
value of n and the process is continued until values are obtained consistent 
with the relation n2a? = k2. In the case of a minor planet log a = 0’4 is 
indicated as the appropriate initial value. With the above formulae the 
calculation can be performed directly in equatorial coordinates, and little 
will be gained by introducing the ecliptic system. When a and n have been

96. Gauss has given a method for finding a circular orbit, based on 
ecliptic coordinates. Let (1^, Zj), (Z2, Z2) be the heliocentric distances and 
longitudes of the Earth at the times tlf t2 and (Xn (X2, /32) the cor­
responding observed longitudes and latitudes of the planet. If in the plane 
triangle SE1P1 the angle at is denoted by zx and the exterior angle 
at Ex by P1SE1 = and
a sin = Px sin .................................... (14)
Similarly in the triangle SE2P2, with similar notation,
a sin z2 = R2 sin 82 .................................... (15)
The directions of the sides of the two triangles are now represented on a 
sphere of unit radius, SE1} SE2 being represented by E1} E2 on the ecliptic, 
SPy, SP2 by two points Plt P2. If Glt G2 represent EXPX, E2P2, these 
points lie respectively on the great circles Ed\, E2P2 and the arcs E^Ga, 
E2G2 are and S2. Let the circles EXG1} E2G2 cut the ecliptic at the 
angles 7^ 72. Then the projections of the radius through Gx on the radius 
through Ey, the radius through the point on the ecliptic 90° in advance 
of and the radius through the pole of the ecliptic give
cos & cos (Xx — Zx) = cos
cos & sin (Xi — Zx) = sin cos 7X
sin fa

and similarly
cos fa cos (X2 — Z2) = cos 82
cos fa sin (X2 — Z2) = sin S2 cos y2
sin fa 
= sin 82 sin 72
whence S2 and yx. y2. Let the circles EXPX, E2P2 meet in D at an angle tj.

DP1 = fa —th+Zi and DP2= fa - &2 + z2, while P^P2 = n (t2 - ti), n being the 
mean motion. Hence

where
Xi = </>2 - ^2 - (fa - 3]), x-2 = fa-82 + (fa ~ $i)-
The solution is conducted in the usual way. Since 82 are known an 
assumed value of a gives zlt z2 by (14) and (15). Then and 77 being 
ki^own, the value of n is deduced from (16), and the process is continued 
until values are found which satisfy the relation n2a3 = k2. When this has 
been done, the values of zx, z2 have also been found, and hence the geo­
centric distances are given by
Pj sin zy = Pi sin (^ — zi)} p2 sin z2 = R2 sin (&2 — z<i)
but these distances are not actually required. Since the arc EyPA on the 
sphere is 8] — and makes the angle 72 with the ecliptic, we have the 
heliocentric longitude and latitude of Px (as in the case of Gi) given by
cos 5] cos (Z2 — Zj) = cos (£>! — zi)
cos sin (Zi — Li) = sin (^ — zi) cos
sin 
= sin (8j — ^) sin 7j
with similar formulae for (Z2, b2) the heliocentric longitude and latitude of 
the planet in its second position.
97. 
If (Zi, bi), (l2, b2) have been thus obtained the remaining elements
are easily found. For by (15) of § 86 the node and inclination are given 
by
2 tan i sin (L +1.2) — fl} = sin (bi + 62)/cos bi cos b2 cos | (Z2 — li)
2 tan i cos (Z] + li) — fl] = sin (b2 — bi)/cos bi cos b2 sin | (Z2 — li)
and then the arguments of latitude by
tan Ui = tan (Zj — fl) sec i, tan u2 = tan (Z2 — fl) sec i
with the check u2 — 
= n (t2 - Z2). As the fourth element the argument of
latitude u0 at a chosen epoch t0 may be taken, and this is simply
u0 =iti + n (t0 — t^ = «2 + » (k ~ t-i)
where Zn t2 may be antedated for planetary aberration.
If, on the other hand, the heliocentric coordinates (a\, ylt zi) and (x2, y2, z2) 
have been found as in § 95, and i' is the inclination of the orbit to the

102 Determination of Parabolic and Circular Orbits [ch. ix 
plane z = 0 and fl' is reckoned in this plane from the axis of x towards the 
axis of y, the plane of the orbit is
x sin fl' sin i' — y cos O' sin i' + z cos i' — 0 
and as this is satisfied by the two points on the orbit we have
sin fl sin i' _ cos fl' sin / cos i' 
2/i^2- y^i 
~ 
~ x,y2-x2y, ‘
The solution can then be completed as before, the arguments u being now 
reckoned in the plane of the orbit from the node in the plane z = 0.
The meaning of the quantities bx, bz and c in § 95 may be seen thus. Let an 
axis of z be taken perpendicular to pj and p2, and an axis of x midway between 
the directions of pl and p2, so that (Z1} nT) become (cos|0, — sin 0), 
(l2, m2, n2) become (cos|0, sin 0), and Pj Zx\ (X2, Y2, Z2) become 
(X/, P/, ZO, (X2', Y', Z'\ Then
= (X2 — Xi) sec ^0
b2 = (Y2 — Yi) cosec 10 
c = (Z2' - Zi)\
If the difficulties of reducing this apparently simple problem to a practical 
form of calculation are carefully considered, in view of the small quantities 
which occur, the merit of the method in § 96 will be better understood. The 
reader must realize that the general problem of determining orbits from 
observations close together in time is essentially a question of arithmetical 
technique, and not of any particular mathematical difficulty. This is well 
illustrated in the history of the problem, especially in the eighteenth century.
It is to be remarked that the problem of finding a circular orbit to 
satisfy the given observations cannot always be solved. That a solution is 
not necessarily to be expected with arbitrary data can be readily seen, 
though the equations, not being algebraic, are too complicated to make a 
general discussion of the conditions feasible. It is enough to say that cases 
have occurred in practice in which a circular approximation to the orbit has 
proved impossible. The number of minor planets already discovered is 
approaching a thousand, and the most frequent eccentricity is in the neigh­
bourhood of 012.

CHAPTER X
ORBITS OF DOUBLE STARS
98. 
There exist in the sky pairs of stars the components of which are 
separated by no more than a few  seconds of arc, and frequently by less than 
one second. So close are they that they can only be seen distinctly in 
powerful telescopes, if indeed they can be clearly resolved at all. Such pairs 
are so numerous that probability forbids the idea that the contiguity of the 
stars can be explained by chance distribution in space. They must be 
physically connected systems for the most part and it is to be expected that 
the relative motion of the stars will reveal the effect of mutual gravitation. 
That this is actually true was discovered by Sir W. Herschel.
*
The motion is referred to the brighter component as a fixed point. The 
relative motion of the fainter component takes place in an ellipse of which 
the principal star occupies the focus (§ 24), unless there are other bodies in 
the system, or there proves to be no physical connexion between the pair. 
The apparent orbit which is observed is the projection of the actual orbit on 
the tangent plane to the celestial sphere, to which the line of sight to the 
principal star is normal, and since the point of observation is very distant 
compared with the dimensions of the orbit the projection can be considered 
orthogonal. Hence the law of areas holds also in the apparent orbit, which 
is equally an ellipse. But in this orbit the brighter star does not occupy the 
focus: its position gives the means of determining the relative situation of 
the true orbit.
The observations give the polar coordinates, p, 0, of the companion, the 
principal star being at the origin. The distance p is expressed in seconds of 
arc and the linear scale remains unknown unless the parallax of the system 
has been determined. The position angle 0 is reckoned from the North 
direction through 360° in the order N., E. or following, S., W. or preceding. 
The planes of the actual and apparent orbits intersect in a line called the line 
of nodes and passing through the principal star. The position angle of that 
node which lies between 0° and 180° will be designated by fl. Thus if the 
line of nodes is taken as the axis of £,
£ = p cos (0 - fl), 7] = p sin (0 — fl).

104 
Orbits of Double Stars 
[ch. x
On the other hand, in the plane of the actual orbit, the longitude of periastron 
X is the angle measured from this node to periastron in the direction of 
orbital motion. Hence in this plane, if the line of nodes is taken as the axis 
of x,
x = r cos (w 4- X), y=r sin (w 4- X)
where r is the radius vector and w the true anomaly of the companion. But 
if i is the inclination of the two planes to one another, £ = x and y = y cos i, 
so that
p cos (0 — fl) = r cos (w 4- X)
p sin (3 — fl) = r sin (w 4- X) cos i.
Here the limits contemplated for i are 0° and 180°. If 0° <i< 90°, 3 and w 
increase together with the time and the motion is direct. If 90° < i < 180°, 
3 decreases with the time and the motion is retrograde. This is a departure 
from the more usual convention according to which i is always less than 90°. 
It is then necessary to state whether the motion is direct or retrograde, and 
in the latter case to reverse the sign of cos i. Ordinary visual observations 
of double stars, however, must leave the position of the orbital plane in one 
respect ambiguous, since there is nothing to indicate whether the node as 
defined is the approaching or receding node. The two possible planes intersect 
in the line of nodes and are the images of one another in the tangent plane 
to the celestial sphere.
In addition to the three elements, fl, X, i, now defined, four other elements 
are required. These are a, the mean distance in the true orbit, expressed 
like p in seconds of arc; e, the eccentricity of the true orbit; T, the time of 
periastron passage; and P, the period (or n = 2tt/P, the mean motion) ex­
pressed in years.
99. The measurement of double stars is difficult and the early measures 
were very rough indeed. As the accuracy of the observations is not high 
refined methods of treatment are seldom justified and graphical processes 
have beep largely employed. The observed coordinates may be plotted on 
paper and the apparent ellipse drawn through the points as well as may be. 
Let C be the centre and >S' the position of the principal star. The problem 
consists in finding the orthogonal projection by which the actual orbit is 
projected into this ellipse and the focus F into the point &
The direction of the line of nodes can be determined by the principles of 
projective geometry. Conjugate lines through the focus F form an orthogonal 
involution. They project into an overlapping involution of conjugate lines 
through >S'. Of this involution one pair is at right angles and as in this case 
a right angle projects into a right angle it is clear that the line of nodes is 
parallel to one of the pair. Let /S'tI, SA'; SB, SB' be two pairs of conjugate 
lines through & When the apparent ellipse has been drawn these can be

98, 99] 
Orbits of Double Stars 
105
found by drawing tangents at the extremities of chords through S; or by 
inscribing quadrangles in the ellipse, for each of which S is a harmonic point. 
On CS as diameter describe a circle, centre K. Let Al} A/; Blt Bi be the 
points in which the conjugate lines intersect this circle and let A}Ai, 
intersect in 0. Corresponding points of the same involution on the circle 
are obtained by drawing chords through 0, and if OK meets the circle in 
N, N', SN, SN' are the orthogonal pair of the involution pencil required. 
Let CABNA’B' be a transversal of the pencil drawn parallel to SN' so that 
AA', BB' subtend obtuse angles at >S. This is an involution range of which 
N, since it corresponds to the point at infinity, is the centre, so that 
AN. NA' = BN. NB'. On NS take the point F such that NF
*
 is equal to 
this constant product. Then F is the intersection of circles on the diameters 
A A', BB' and 21/L4', BFB' are right angles. Hence if NF be rotated about
CN until FS is perpendicular to the plane CNS (the plane of the apparent 
orbit) right angles at F will be orthogonally projected into the involution of 
conjugate lines at $. The position of the focus F of the actual orbit has 
therefore been found, and the orthogonal projection by which the true and 
the apparent orbits are related.
The true orbit may be plotted point by point on the plane of the paper, 
with its centre C and focus F. For if P' is a point on the apparent orbit and 
P the corresponding point on the true orbit PP' is perpendicular to CN and 
PF, P'S meet on CN. In particular, if X' (fig. 5) is a point where CS meets 
the apparent orbit, the corresponding point X in which the perpendicular 
through X' to CN meets CF is a vertex of the true orbit and CX = a. The 
eccentricity is given by
CS_CF = 
CX'~ CX e

and the inclination by

where 0 < i < |tf if the motion is direct and |tf < i < tt if the motion is 
retrograde. Also fl (<7r) is the position angle of CN and X is the angle 
between ON and CF measured in the direction in which the motion takes 
place. The five geometrical elements of the orbit have therefore been found.
100. It is to be noticed that this method does not require the ellipse 
which represents the apparent orbit to be actually drawn. When the observed 
positions have been plotted five points may be chosen to define the ellipse. 
These points need not be actual points of observation: it is better if they are 
graphically interpolated among the observed positions. Let them be denoted
by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Draw a line through 1 parallel to 23. The second point in 
which this line meets the ellipse can then be found by Pascal’s theorem with 
the ruler only. This gives two parallel chords and hence a diameter. 
Similarly a second diameter is drawn and the two intersect in the centre C 
of the apparent ellipse. Again, by a similar use of Pascal’s theorem, the points 
in which the lines 1$, 2$, 3S meet the ellipse again are determined. This 
gives three pairs of lines each of which determines a quadrangle inscribed in 
the ellipse. If two of these be completed the sides of the harmonic triangles 
which meet in $ determine two pairs of conjugate lines. From this point 
the construction follows as before. The point X' in which CS meets the 
apparent ellipse can be constructed by projective geometry. But it is 
unnecessary. If F' is the second focus of the real orbit and P the point

corresponding to any one of the assumed points on the apparent orbit, 
FP + PF' = 2a and CF = ae. Hence a and e.
101. 
When the apparent ellipse has been drawn the eccentricity is 
known, for if CS meets the ellipse in X', the projection of the vertex of the 
true orbit, CS[CX' = e since the ratio of segments of a line is unaltered by 
orthogonal projection. Let CY' be the conjugate diameter to CX' and 
therefore the projection of the minor axis of the true orbit. If the oblique 
ordinates parallel to CY' are produced in the ratio 1 : v (1 — e2) an auxiliary 
ellipse will be constructed which is clearly the projection of the auxiliary 
circle to the true orbit and has double contact with the apparent orbit, CS 
being the common chord. But the orthogonal projection of a circle is an 
ellipse of which the major axis is equal to the diameter and is parallel to the 
line of nodes, while the minor axis is the direct projection of the diameter. 
Hence the major axis of the auxiliary ellipse is 2a, the minor axis 2a cos i, 
the eccentricity sin i and fl is the angle which the transverse axis makes 
with the N. direction. The circle on the major axis as diameter is the 
auxiliary circle of the true orbit turned into the plane of the apparent orbit. 
Let X be the point in which this circle is cut by a perpendicular from X' to 
the major axis of the auxiliary ellipse. The point X will project into the 
point X' and therefore represents the position of periastron on the auxiliary 
circle. Hence the angle (taken in the right sense) which CX makes with the 
major axis of the auxiliary ellipse, or line of nodes, is the angle X. This is 
the graphical method of Zwiers.
It is evident that the line of nodes and the inclination will be equally 
indicated by constructing the projection of any circle in the plane of the true 
orbit. Now the parameter p (or semi-latus rectum) is a harmonic mean 
between the segments of any focal chord. Hence the circle on the latus 
rectum as diameter has radii along any focal chord which are equal to the 
harmonic mean of the focal segments. The projection of this circle is an 
ellipse with its centre at S, its major axis equal to 2p and lying in the 
direction of the line of nodes, and its eccentricity equal to sin i. This ellipse 
can be actually derived from the apparent orbit by laying off on radii through 
S lengths equal to the harmonic mean of the intercepts on the same chord 
between £ and the curve, since the ratios are unaltered by projection. This 
principle, of which another use will be made, is due to Thiele.
102. 
Such graphical methods are tedious and may be avoided by a slight 
calculation when the apparent orbit has been drawn. Since the eccentricity 
is known when this has been done, there remain four geometrical elements, 
a, i, fl, X, to be determined. Four independent quantities are required and 
the four chosen by Sir John Herschel and others are 2a, the diameter through 
S, 2/3 the conjugate diameter, and y2 the position angles of these diameters. 
The length of the chord through £ parallel to /8, or the projection of the latus 

108

[ch. x
rectum of the true orbit, is therefore 2/?\/(l — e2). Hence the relations 
between the positions in the true and apparent orbits (§ 98) give:
a (1 — e) cos (^1 — fl) = a (1 — e) cos X
a (1 — e) sin — H) = a (1 — e) sin X cos i
(3 V(1 — e2) cos (^2 — H) = — a (1 — e2) sin X
(3 V(1 — e2) sin (^2 — D) = a (1 — e2) cos X cos i
since w = 0° at periastron and .90° at the extremity of the latus rectum. 
Hence 11 is given by
a2 (1 — e2) sin 2 
— H) + /3~ sin 2 
— H) = 0
or
tan (x, + %2 - 211) = tan (%, - %2) cos 27 
where
tan 7 = V( 1 — e2) a/ft.
This equation in H is satisfied by H + |tt as well as H. But
cos2 i = — tan (y, — H) tan (^2 — H)
and this rejects H + |tt since cos i < 1 and determines i. The first and third 
of the above set of four equations give both a and X with its proper quadrant 
and the second or fourth gives also the proper sign of cos i (according to the 
convention of § 98). The solution is then free from ambiguity, understanding 
that is the position angle corresponding to periastron and the position 
angle when the companion has moved through one quadrant in its plane 
beyond this point.
103. 
Another method employs the general equation
aa? + 2hxy + by2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0
of the apparent orbit referred to the principal star as origin. Without loss of 
generality c may be put equal to 1. The other coefficients are to be chosen 
to satisfy the observations as well as may be. But an elaborate solution is 
not justified because the one accurate element in the observation, the time, 
is not involved in this stage. The intersections of the ellipse with the axes 
and any fifth point give the result in the simplest way. The elements of the 
true orbit can then be derived in a variety of forms. Let us find the pro­
jection of the circle on the latus rectum. The above equation may be written
2 
c
a cos2 0 + 2h cos 0 sin 0 -f- b sin2 0 + - (g cos 0 + /sin 0) + — = 0.
Fora particular value of 0, p has two values, p, and — p2, one positive and 
one negative since the origin is inside the curve. Hence, if p represents the- 
harmonic mean,

where, in the usual notation,
A — be —f\ H=fg— ch, B = ac — g2.
Hence the equation
Bx2 — 2Hxy + Ay2 + c2 = 0
represents the projection of the circle on the latus rectum (§ 101), or an 
ellipse with axes 2p and 2p cos i and its transverse axis coinciding with the 
line of nodes. It is therefore identical with the equation
(x cos £14- y sin II)2 (y cos £2 — x sin £2)- _ 
p2 
p2 cos2 i
and thus
— B/c2 = p~2 cos2 £1 + p~2 sec2 i sin2 £1
H/c2 = ( p'~ — p~2 sec2 i) sin £1 cos £1
— A /c2 = p~2 sin2 £1 + p~2 sec2 i cos2 £2 
or
p~2 tan2 i sin 2£1 = — 2H[c2
p~2 tan2 i cos 2£2 = (B — A)/c2
2p~2 4- p~2 tan2 i = — (B 4- A )/c2
which determine £1, p and i.
Again, the perpendicular from the focus on the directrix is a (e-1 — e) = pe~\ 
Hence the intercepts on the line of nodes and on the line perpendicular to it 
between the focus and the directrix are pje cos X, p/e sin X. The projections 
of these intercepts, also at right angles, are pfe cos X, p cos ije sin X. But the 
projection of the directrix is the polar of the origin, or the line gx+fy + c = 0. 
Hence
(<7 cos £1 4-/sin £1) p e cos X 4- c = 0
(— g sin £2 4- f cos £1) p cos i[e sin X 4- c = 0
so that e and X are given by the equations
e sin X = — p cos i (/cos £2 — g sin Q)/c
ecosX= —p (/sin £2 +g cos £l)/c.
Equations for the five geometrical elements in the above form were first given 
by Kowalsky.
The form of the equation which represents the projection of a circle is 
defined by the fact that the asymptotes of the projected ellipse are parallel 
to the projection of the circular lines and therefore to the tangents from S to 
the apparent orbit. It will be found that the projection of the auxiliary 
circle, referred to its centre, is in the usual notation
C2 (Bx2 - 2Hxy 4- Ay2) 4- A3 = 0

110
Orbits of Double Stars
[CH. X
and that of the director circle
C2 (Bsc2 — 2Hscy 4- Ay2) + A (A + Cc) = 0 
while the eccentricity of the true orbit is given by
1 - e2 = Cc/A.
104. 
In some few cases a double star has been observed over more than
one complete revolution. The period P is then known approximately and 
the date T of periastron passage, when the companion is situated on the 
diameter of the apparent orbit through $. Otherwise, when the geometrical 
elements have been determined, two dated observations suffice to determine
these two additional elements. For two observed position angles 02 give 
the corresponding true anomalies w2, w2 and hence the eccentric anomalies

tan (6 - fl) = tan (w 4- X) cos i, 
Then 
tan %E =

n (tL — T) = E1 - e sin Elt n (t2 — T) = E2 — e sin E2
determine n = 2ttIP and T. In practice a larger number of such equations 
will be employed in order to reduce the effect of errors in the observations. 
The law of areas can also be applied directly to the apparent orbit, for if 
is the area described by the radius vector between the dates t2, and /L is 
the area of the ellipse, P = (t2 — ij) AJa^, and similarly T can be determined. 
A primitive method which has been used for measuring the areas consists in 
cutting out the areas in cardboard and weighing them.
When the parallax w of a double star is known, ci/w is the mean distance 
in the system expressed in terms of the astronomical unit. Hence. 24), if 
m, m' are the masses of the components,.
k2 (m 4- m) = fap a?! nr*  P2
while k2 = 4tf2 if the mass of the Sun-Earth system and the sidereal year are 
taken as units. For this purpose the mass of the Earth is negligible and 
thus, P being expressed in years,
m 4- m = a3/w3P2
is the combined mass of the system, compared with that of the Sun.
105. 
The apparent orbit can be reconstructed, on an arbitrary scale, 
from observed ppsition angles alone. This course was advocated by Sir J. 
Herschel, who considered the measured distances of his day very inferior in 
accuracy. With this object the position angles are plotted as ordinates with 
the time as abscissa. Owing to inaccuracies the points will not lie exactly 
on a smooth curve, but such a curve must be drawn through them as well as 
possible. Let be the angle which the tangent to the curve at the point 

103-105] 
Orbits of Double Stars 
111
(t, 0) makes with the axis of t, so that d0/dt = tan But since Kepler’s 
law of areas is preserved in the apparent orbit, p20 = h, an undetermined 
constant. Hence p = \'(h cot yfr) and the apparent orbit can thus be derived 
graphically from the (t, 0) curve. The elements with the exception of a can 
then be obtained and finally a is determined by the measured distances, of 
vyhich no other use is made in the calculation.
The opposite case may arise, and is illustrated by the star 42 Comae 
Berenices, in which the determination of the elements must be based on the 
distances. Here the plane of the orbit passes through the point of observa­
tion, i = 90° (or practically so) and the position angles serve only to determine 
D. If the star has been observed over more than one revolution the period P 
may be considered known. Corresponding to the point (a cos E, b sin E) on 
the orbit, the observed distance is
p — a cos E cos X — b sin E sin X — ae cos X
= R cos (E + ft)- ae cos X 
while
n (t — T) = E — e sin E.
If the observations are plotted for a single period, from maximum to 
maximum, the result is to give the curve
x = nt = nT + E — e sin E
y = p = R cos (E + ft) — ae cos X
which is a distorted cosine curve. Maximum and minimum correspond to 
E=—ft,7T — ft and give
ntx = nT — ft + e sin ft, yx = R — ae cos X
nt2 = nT + 7T — ft — e sin ft, y2 = - R- ae cos X
whence R and ae cos X, while in addition
n(t2- t1) = 7r—2esin ft.
These equations may be supplemented by a simple device. Taking the 
origin of x at the first maximum let the curve
y = R cos x — ae cos X
also be drawn. Let P be a point on this curve and Q the corresponding 
point on the first curve such that the ordinates at P and Q are equal. Then 
at P, x = E + ft, so that
QP = E + ft - n (t-tx) = e sin E + ft -n (T-t,).
Hence the curve
y = e sin (x — ft) + ft — n (T — tx)
can be constructed by laying off on each ordinate through P a length equal 
to QP. This is a simple sine curve, the form of which will serve to show 

112
Orbits of Double Stars
[ch. x
any irregularities in the (nt, p) curve from which it is derived. The ampli­
tude is 2e, represented on the scale by which 2tf corresponds to the period in 
x. The value of e being thus known gives from (t2 — ti) and hence a and X, 
since
a cos X = R cos a sin X = R sin /3/V(l — e2).
T is then given by the maximum and minimum of the original curve. Bui 
the sine curve has its maximum at x = /3 + |tf and its central line is 
y = ft-n(T— ij). These conditions must also be fairly satisfied by the 
adopted solution.
106. 
Graphical methods, such as those sketched above, only provide a 
first approximation to the solution of a problem. Here in general the obser­
vations are too rough to make a closer approximation feasible. But if it is 
necessary to improve the elements thus found, each observation gives one 
equation in the following way. Let da, d£l, ... be the required corrections 
to the approximate elements, a, fl, .... For the time t of an observation

107. In some cases the position of a binary system has been measured 
relatively to some neighbouring star C which is independent of the system. 
Let A be the principal star, its mass, (a\, y^ its coordinates at the time t', 
and similarly let B be the companion, its mass, (#2, y2) its coordinates. 
A series of measures of A B gives
a?2 — = p cos 3, y2 — yi = p sin 0
while the measures of AC give x3 — xi;y3 — y1, (a?3, y3) being the position of C. 
Let (£, y) be the C.G. of AB, so that
(Wj + m2) £ = 
+ m2x2, (m, + m2) y = m^y^ + m2y2.
But the motions of C and of the c.G. of AB are uniform and independent. 
Hence
% = x3 + a + ftt, y = y3 + a' + fit
where /3, /3' are the proper motions of the c.G. relative to C, and (a, a') is its 
position relative to C at the chosen epoch to which t refers. Thus

a + /3t — f{x2 — a?j) + x3 — g\ = 0 
and
a' + fit -f(y2 -yi) + ys-yi = o 
similarly, where
/= + ™2).
From a series of such equations a, a', ft, ft' and f can be determined and 
therefore the ratio of the masses of A and B. But if a is the mean distance, 
P the period and w the parallax of the system AB,
m-i + m2 = aP/t^P2
and the masses of the individual stars, expressed in terms of the Sun, become 
known.
108. In certain cases the absolute coordinates of stars apparently single 
have exhibited a variable proper motion. It is then assumed that the varia­
tion is periodic and due to orbital motion in conjunction with an undetected 
body. The motion to be investigated is relative to the C.G. of the system, 
which itself is supposed to move uniformly. In the plane of the orbit the 
coordinates are a' (cos E — e), b' sin E, and therefore in the plane of projection, 
when referred to the line of nodes and the line at right angles, they become
x = a (cos E — e) cos X — b' sin E sin X
y = {a' (cos E - e) sin X + b' sin E cos X] cos i.
Hence the orbital displacement in the direction of the position angle Q is

where
g = (i |cos X cos (£1 — Q) — sin X sin (£1 — Q) cos i}
h = — b' (sin X cos (£1 — Q) + cos X sin (£1 — Q) cos i}
and Q = 90° for displacements in R.A., Q = 0° for displacements in declination. 
The observations of one coordinate, say 8, therefore give a series of equations 
of the form
8 = 80 + p,5t + g cos E + h sin E — ge 
with
E — e sin E = n (t — T).
From these e, n (or P), T, b0, g and h can be determined. Since g and h 
are functions of a, £1, X and i, these four elements cannot be derived from 
observations of one coordinate alone. But from observations of the other 
coordinate, say a, the corresponding quantities g and h' can be found and the 
elements of the motion are then completely determinate, including a', the 
mean distance from the C.G. of the system.
In the two notable examples of this kind, Sirius and Procyon, the 
companion was discovered afterwards. It thus became possible to find the 
relative mean distance a and hence the ratio of the masses, since
n^a' — m2 (a — a').
Hence, the parallax being known, the individual masses of the components 
have been determined. It is to be noticed that, when the companion cannot 
be observed, the function of the masses which can be found is m/ (m} +

CHAPTER XI

CEBITS OF SPECTROSCOPIC BINARIES
109. Another class of orbits which are based on pure elliptic motion is 
presented by those systems which are known as spectroscopic binaries. It 
is now possible to determine the radial velocities of the stars in absolute 
measure with high accuracy. This follows from the application of Doppler’s 
principle to the interpretation of stellar spectra. On the simple wave theory 
of light this principle is easily explained. A light disturbance travels out­
wards from its source in a spherical wave front which expands in the free 
ether of space with the uniform velocity U. Let a fixed set of rectangular 
axes be taken in this space, and let ylf Zj) be the position of the source 
at the origin of time. Let (un v1} wY) be the velocity components of the 
source, supposed to be in uniform motion, and t the time at which a light 
disturbance is emitted. Similarly let (x2, y2, z2) be the position of the 
observer, also supposed to be moving uniformly, (u2t v2, w2) the velocity 
components, and t the time at which the specified disturbance reaches him. 
For simplicity the motions have been considered uniform, but obviously they 
are immaterial except as regards the source at the instant t and the observer 
at the instant t. Let the corresponding positions be A, B respectively and 
let the distance AB = R. Then
Rr = S \x2 + u2t — (a?! + W10}2
dR v / dr \ v dr Tr 
di=ta\u‘dt-u')=Kdt-v'
where (a, 
7) are the direction cosines of AB and V2 are the projections
of the velocities (wj, v1} wA, (u2, v2, w2) on this line. But since the wave 
reaches B from A in the time (7 — t),
R=U(r-t),
Hence
dr U- V> _ 
V2-K V2(V2- V.)
dt~U-V2* U ^U{U-V2)'

116 
Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries [ch. xi
Now (F2 — Ft) is the component of relative velocity of A and B, measured 
in the direction of separation of the two points. This is a definite quantity. 
But V2 is a component of the observer’s absolute motion in free ether, and 
this is unknown. Presumably it is small in comparison with U, and the last 
term can be rejected as a negligible effect of the second order. Or, on the 
theory of relativity, Jr2 is not only unknown but unknowable, and the effect 
is completely compensated by a transformation of the ideal coordinates of 
space and time into ‘another set which is the subject of observation. All 
this has its counterpart in the theory of aberration, with which it is intimately 
related. Whether the limitation is imposed by the imperfection of practical 
observations or by the ultimate nature of things, it is necessary to be content 
with the effect of the first order.
If the light emitted at A has the wave length X, the frequency of a 
particular phase in the wave train at A is U/X. But the number of waves 
emitted in a time dt is received at B in the time dr. If then the apparent 
wave length of the light received at B is X' and the apparent frequency 
J7/X',
£7X-1 dt = UX'~1 dr 
and therefore
V_dr_ V 
X~ dt + U
where V is the relative radial velocity of A from B. Thus the application 
of Doppler’s principle gives
V= U. AX/X
where AX is the increase of wave length (or displacement measured positively 
towards the red end of the spectrum) of a spectral line, of which the natural 
wave length in the star is supposed known. Further details on the practical 
methods of reduction would be out of place here, and this explanation must 
suffice. It is usual to express V in km./sec., and the velocity of light maybe 
taken to be U— 299860 km./sec.
110. 
From the measured radial velocity must be deduced the radial 
velocity of the star relative to the Sun, or rather relative to the centre 
of gravity of the solar system. This requires the calculation of certain 
corrections, of which the most important are due to (1) the diurnal rotation 
of the observer, and (2) the annual elliptic motion of the Earth relative to 
the Sun. The effects of perturbations of the Earth and Sun are compara­
tively small.
An observer situated on the equator is carried by the Earth’s rotation 
over 40,000 km. in a sidereal day. This means a velocity of 0'46 km./sec. 
Hence the velocity of an observer in latitude is 0'46 cos<£> km./sec. always 
directed towards the E. point. If 0 is the angular distance of the star from 
this point at the time of observation, cos 0 = cos 8 cos (A + 90°), where 8 is the 

109, no] 
Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries 
117
declination and h the W. hour angle of the star. Hence the additive 
correction corresponding to (1) is
vd = + 0'46 cos <f) cos 0 = — 0’46 cos 0 cos 3 sin h.
Again, the Earth’s elliptic velocity is compounded (§ 26) of one constant 
velocity Pi perpendicular to the radius vector and another e K, perpendicular 
to the major axis, e being the eccentricity of the orbife. These vectors arc 
directed to points in the ecliptic of which the longitudes are H — 90° and 
T —90°, where 0 is the longitude of the Sun and F the longitude of the 
solar perigee. Let (I, fi) be the star’s longitude and latitude. Hence the 
required correction for the Earth’s orbital motion is
va = + Fj cos (3 [cos (I — B + 90°) + e cos (Z — T + 90°)}.
Now Tri is precisely that vector on which the constant of stellar aberration 
depends, so that if k" is this constant,
F, = k" U/ 206265" = 29’76 km./sec.
when the standard value of k, 20"’47, is adopted with the value of U given 
above. Hence the correction for (2) is
va = + 29’76 cos[sin(® — Z) + esin (T — I)}.
It is evident that the process might be reversed and the value of k deter­
mined by observing the apparent radial motion of one or more stars at 
different times of year. This has been done at the Cape Observatory, with 
the result that the standard value of k was reproduced very exactly, an 
excellent test of the theory. Indeed this is probably the best available 
method of finding the constant of aberration: it will be noticed that the 
adopted value of U, being a factor of both Fj and F, will scarcely affect the 
resulting value of k.
When the necessary corrections have been applied to the apparent radial 
velocity of a star, the star’s radial velocity is obtained relative to the solar 
system. This is affected by the motion of the latter relative to the stellar 
system as a whole. Hence conversely when the radial velocities of a number 
of stars scattered over the sky are known, it becomes possible to deduce the 
motion of the solar system 'relative to the average of those stars in absolute 
measure. If, further, is the parallax of a star, and p its total annual 
proper motion, its transverse velocity is p{ nr when expressed in astronomical 
units per year. Now with the solar parallax 8"’8O and the Earth’s equatorial 
radius 6378’249 km., the astronomical unit (or Earth’s mean distance from 
the Sun) is 149,500,000 km. Hence this unit of velocity is equivalent to 
4’737 km./sec. and the star’s transverse velocity is 4’737 p/nr km./sec. Thus 
the velocity of a star relative to the Sun can be completely determined in 
absolute measure. This concerns questions of stellar kinematics which are 
now entering the region of dynamics but lie outside our present scope.

111. 
Repeated determinations of the radial velocity of a star yield values 
which in the majority of cases are constant within the errors of observation. 
The motion of the star is apparently uniform. But in other cases, perhaps 
a third of all the brighter stars, changes are observed which prove to be 
regular and periodic. These are attributed plausibly to the motion of one 
component in a binary system. Such spectroscopic binaries differ from 
visual doubles only in the scale of their orbits, which prevents them from 
being resolved even in the most powerful telescopes, while their periods are 
to be reckoned in days instead of years or even centuries. It may appear 
that the spectrum of the second component should also be seen. When the 
components are fairly equal in brightness, as in Aurigae, this is so; the 
lines of the spectrum are seen periodically doubled. But with other stare, 
and this is the more common type, the companion is relatively so faint that 
only one spectrum is shown: it is quite unnecessary to suppose that the 
companion is then an absolutely dark body. Even when both spectra are 
visible the secondary spectrum is often difficult to detect and usually difficult 
to measure. As a particularly interesting example Castor (a Geminorum) 
may be quoted. The telescope reveals this star as a visual double, and the 
spectroscope shows that both components are themselves binary systems. 
More complex systems can be inferred from spectroscopic measures alone. 
Thus Polaris, which appears in the telescope as a single star, has been shown 
to be a triple system, consisting of a close pair revolving round a more 
distant third body. Here the motion will be considered in the first instance 
of one component of a binary system about the common centre of gravity, 
and it will be seen how far the elements of an elliptic orbit can be deduced 
from the measured radial velocities, these being based on the comparison of 
the star’s spectrum with that from a terrestrial source (usually the spark 
spectrum of iron or titanium).
112. 
Since the period is generally short, the observations extend over 
several revolutions and the period P is determined by obvious considerations 
with fair exactness. This being known, the observed velocities can be 
referred to a single period with arbitrary epoch and plotted as ordinates 
with the time as abscissa in a diagram called the radial velocity curve. Such 
a curve is illustrated in fig. a, while the relative orbit is shown in fig. b, 
corresponding points being indicated by the same letters. The focus of this 
orbit is G, the centre of gravity of the system. The line of nodes AGB, 
passing through A the receding node and B the approaching node, is the 
line drawn through G in the plane of the orbit at right angles to the line of 
sight. The points Plt P2 mark the position of periastron and apastron, and 
the angle from GA to GP}, measured in the direction of motion, is the longi­
tude of periastron, w. The true anomaly at any point of the orbit being w, 
the longitude of this point from A is w = co + w. Let i (0° < i < 90°) be the 

in, 112]

inclination of the orbit, this being the angle between its plane and the plane 
which is normal to the line of sight, and let e be the eccentricity.
The orbital velocity of the star is compounded (§ 26) of one constant 
velocity V2 transverse to the radius vector and another eV2 perpendicular to 
the major axis. These may be resolved along and perpendicular to the line 
of nodes. The former components contribute nothing to the radial velocity. 
The latter are + V2cos u and +eV2cosw in the direction GE which is 

120 
Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries [ch. xi
drawn at right angles to GA. This line makes the angle (90c - i) with the 
line of sight, and hence the radial velocity which is measured is
V = 7 + (cos u + e cos co) F2 sin i
where 7 is the radial velocity of the point G, that is, of the system relative 
to the Sun. It is at once evident that V2 and i cannot be determined inde­
pendently from the radial velocities alone, and the equation may be written
V = 7 + K (cos u + e cos co), K = V2 sin i 
or again,
V — 7' + K cos u, 7' = 7 4- Ke cos co
where K, 7 and y are to be taken as constant.
113. When the velocity curve has been drawn the maximum and mini­
mum ordinates are approximately known. These are y = y + K, y = y — K 
which require u=0, u— 180r. The maximum and minimum points, A, B, 
therefore correspond with the receding and approaching nodes. The line 
y = y can then be drawn in the diagram, intersecting the velocity curve in 
E, F. These points require u = 90°, 270° and the corresponding points in 
the orbit are the extremities of the focal chord at right angles to the line of 
nodes. The velocity curve is thus divided at A, E, B, F into four parts 
corresponding to four focal quadrants, each bounded on one side by the line 
of nodes. The part which contains the periastron passage will be described 
in the shortest time and that which contains the apastron passage will 
require the longest time. The opposite extremities of any focal chord give 
equal and opposite values to (F— 7'). In particular, the periastron and 
apastron points, P2, are located on the velocity curve by the further 
condition that their abscissae differ by the half period, and the points 
Llt L2 corresponding to the ends of the latus rectum by the condition that 
they are equidistant in time from or P2. The four points PY, P2, L1, L2 
on the velocity curve are easily found graphically by trial and error.
Again, let 0 be the centre of the orbit and COD the diameter which is 
conjugate to the diameter parallel to the line of nodes, so that the tangents 
to the orbit at C and D are also parallel to this line. Hence f=7 at 
C and D on the velocity curve. Let an axis of z be taken parallel to GE in 
the plane of the orbit, so that
tz dz . . 
v=1+disml
Ct*J (V — 7) dt -= (z2 — Zj)sin i.
Now the integral represents the area of the velocity curve measured from 
the line y = 7. Hence by taking the limits at A, C, B, D it follows that the 
positive area of the velocity curve from A to C is equal to the negative area 
from C to B, and the negative area from B to D is equal to the positive area 

112-114] Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries 
121
from D to A. These conditions, which can be tested by a planimeter or some 
equivalent method, make it possible to draw the line y = 7 in the diagram.
At Klf K2, the extremities of the minor axis, the radial velocities relative 
to G are equal and opposite. Hence on the velocity curve and K2 are at 
equal and opposite distances from the line 3/= 7 and equidistant in time 
from P1 or P2. Thus these points can also be found graphically without 
difficulty.
114. It is supposed that the period P is known, and this gives the mean 
daily motion, /z = 2tt/P. The other quantities which can be derived from 
the velocity curve are five in number, namely T the time of periastron 
passage, K = V2 sin i, 7 the radial velocity of the system, co the longitude of 
the node, and e = sin </> the eccentricity of the orbit. The most satisfactory 
direct method of finding these elements is based on the representation of 
the curve (see Chapter XXIV) by a harmonic series in the form
V=V0 + ^rj sin (jpi + ft)
where t is reckoned from some arbitrary epoch. This is always possible 
by Fourier’s theorem. But

There are now only four quantities to be determined, which may be taken to 
be Ku K2, 7’and e. Thus the four equations corresponding toj = 1, 2 are 
alone required: those of a higher order are useful only when there is reason 
to suspect that the motion is not purely elliptic. Now these give (§ 47)

very small angle which can scarcely exceed 2° and is generally negligible.

From this equation e is easily found by trial and error, and then a, which 
gives T, is found from (3). The equations (2) give Kx and K2, whence finally 
K and co are derived by (1). The process is therefore very simple, even 
without special tables, when once the harmonic representation of the velocity 
curve by two periodic terms has been obtained. This can be done very 
easily and with all needful accuracy by taking a sufficient number of equi­
distant ordinates from the curve.
115. It is, however, more usual in practice to find approximate pre­
liminary elements by methods which are largely graphical and to improve 
them, if thought necessary, by a least-squares solution giving differential 
corrections. Thus 2K is the apparent range of the velocity curve, and when 
the periastron point Pj has been located on the curve, T is known, while the 
areal property which fixes the position of the line y = 7 has been explained 
(§ 113). The remaining elements to be determined are therefore e and o>, 
and these are connected by the relation Ke cos w = 7' — 7. A number of 
interesting properties have been used for the purpose.
Among these are the properties connected with a focal chord of the 
orbit. Let be the time at a certain point of the orbit and w and ft the 

114-116] Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries

corresponding true and eccentric anomalies. Let t2 be the time at the other 
end of the focal chord through the point and 180° + w and the true and 
eccentric anomalies. Then
(1 — e'fi tan

or
e cos | (E2 + EJ = cos | (E2 — EJ 
and therefore
(4 — Q = E2 — Ei — 2e sin | (E2 — h\) cos ^(E2 + h\)
— (E2 — Ex) — sin (E2 — Ey).
Also
tan | (E2 -E^- J (1 - erf e-1 (cot

= — cot 0 cosec w.
Hence, if 2t) = E2 — Eit
/a (i2 — <i) = 2y — sin 2t?, tan </> sin w = — cot 77.
Similarly, if i3, i4 are the times at the ends of the perpendicular chord, where 
the true anomalies are 90° + w, 270° + w,
/i (i4 — t3) = 2t}' — sin 2t), tan <f> cos w = — cot 77'.
The angles 77,77' are easily found, especially with the help of a suitable table 
of the function (x — sin x), and hence </> or e and w = u - co. But the ordinate 
at the point tA gives y—f = K cos w and therefore u, whence the value of co 
can be inferred. The equations
tan |Ex = tan (45° — | </>) tan |w, 
/c - T) = EA—e sin Ex
tan %ES = tan (45° —1</>) tan (^w + 45°), /it (t3 — T) = E?, - e sin E. 
will give two independent values of T.
Sets of four points related in this way are easily located on the velocity 
curve, for they are given by y — 7' = + Kcos u, + K sin u. Thus the four 
points y — y = ±KI^/2 are very suitable for the purpose. Here u = 45°, 
w = 45° — co. Two special sets have been mentioned in § 113, namely, AB, 
EF where u = 0°, w = — co, and PXP2, LAL2 where w = 0°. In the latter case 
y — f = ±K cos co, + K sin co, giving co immediately, tx = T, and e is given 
by </> = 77' — 90°.
116. There are also properties connected with a diameter of the orbit. 
If E is the eccentric anomaly at a point, E + |tt and E + f tt are the eccentric 
anomalies at the ends of the diameter conjugate to that which passes through 
the point. Let t2 be the corresponding times. Then
p (ij — T) = E +17T — e cos E
p(t2 — T) — E + f 7F + e cos E

124 
Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries [ch. xi
so that
|/z(^ + ^-2T) = P + 7t
l/z. (t2 — ti — %P) = e cos E.
Now the points C, D, in which the line y = 7 cuts the velocity curve, satisfy 
this condition and the conjugate diameter being parallel to the line of nodes 
makes the angle — &> with the major axis. Hence in this case
— tan co = cos <f> tan E 
and therefore
(t2 — ti — |P) = e (1 + tan2 &> sec2 </>) ^
= ecos w (1 — e2cos2 &>) ^cosd
which gives e = sin <£> when e cos &> = (7 — f)[K is known. Also
-e = 
(t2- tY -|P)sec + t2- 2T)
which gives a relation between e and T.
Another pair of such points is Kx, K2, corresponding to the ends of the 
minor axis. Since E = 0 in this case,
+ 
2T) = tf
(t2 -tT- %P) = e.
Let Z4j, u2 be the longitudes at Klt K2. Then the radial velocities at these 
points, relative to G, are
+ (cos uA — cos = ± K sin | (u2 — uj sin 1(1/2+ «i) = ± K cos sin w. 
This quantity is therefore given by the ordinates at Klt K2 on the velocity 
curve, relative to the line y = y.
117. The velocity curve also possesses interesting integral and differential 
properties which may be useful. It is necessary to have a consistent system 
of units, and since those of time and velocity have already been adopted, the 
unit of length is fixed and the natural system is:
Unit of time = 1 mean solar day = 86400 mean secs.,
Unit of length = 86400 km. = 0'0005779 astronomical units,
Unit of velocity = 1 km. per second,
Unit of mass = that of the Sun.
Now the constant of areal velocity in the orbit is
pV2= 2vrabIP = pa2 cos <£> 
so that
a sin i = K/u."1 cos </> sin i = Kyr1 cos </>.
The argument relative to the areas of the velocity curve in § 113 can now be 
made more precise. For the tangents to the orbit at C and D, referred to 
the principal axes of the ellipse, are
x sin to + y cos to = + V(«2 sin2 to +b2 cos2 to)

116-118] 
Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries 
125
and the perpendiculars on them from the focus G are
Zi > ^2 = ± ae sin to 4- a V(1 - & cos2 to).
Measured from the line y = y let yIj be the area of the velocity curve from A 
to C, — J.! from C to B, — j42 from B to D, and A2 from D to A. Then
^(Ai + A2) = cos </> V(1 — e2 cos2 to)

A2A2 = K-fjr2 cos4 <t>.
When A2 have been measured in the proper units these equations deter­
mine (j> (or e) and to.

axis of time,

and r being the radius vector in the orbit, the constant areal velocity is
/za2 cos (/> = r2 dw

Hence
tan i/r = — /j,K cos </> sin u(air)2
= — fiK sec3 <f) sin u (1 4- e cos w)- 
and at special points on the curve tan a/t has these values:
A, B : u = 0°, 180 
: tan = 0
E,F :u=90°, 270° 
: tan a/t = +/lzJi sec3 <£ (1 + e sin w)-
Pi, P2 : w = 0°, 180° 
: tan a/t = + pKsec3 <£ sin to (1 + e)2

: tam/r = + /zKsec3 <f> cos u>
Klt K2: w = + (90 4- 0) : tan a/t = + p,K cos <f> cos (to + (j>).
If tan a/t is found graphically at any of these points, attention must be paid 
to the scales in which ordinates and abscissae are represented. These 
expressions can then be used in order to find to and <j>.
Since
r x (sin u cot a/t)^, w = u — to
and u at any point on the velocity curve is given by the ordinate measured 
from the axis y = it is possible theoretically to plot the actual orbit to an 
arbitrary scale, point by point. This is scarcely a practical method, but 
deserves mention as the counterpart of Sir John Herschel’s method for 
double star orbits (§ 105).

119. The values of the elements found by any of these graphical methods 
are approximate only. They can be improved by the addition of differential 
corrections, 8K to K, be to e, bto to &>, 8T to T and bfi to fi. Thus each 
observation gives an equation of condition of the form
\de oT dfi J
Vo — Vc= 87' + cos u. SK — K sin u. 
and it is easily found that
= sin w (2 4- e cos w) sec2 <£>

= (t — T) (1 4- e cos w)2 sec3 <£>.
It is more usual to give 7, the radial velocity of the system, than 7', but this 
quantity can be derived finally from the relation 7 = 7'— Ke cos co.
120. When the elements of an orbit specified above have been obtained, 
by whatever method, some information can be gained as to the dimensions 
and mass of the system. An equation already found in § 117 gives
a sin i = Kfi~x cos <£>. 86400 km.
when the unit of length there adopted is explicitly introduced. Let m be 
the mass of the star whose spectrum is observed, and m! the mass of the 
other star. Then
pPa3 ^1 4- 
= (»«• + m ) C
where C is a constant depending on the units employed. These being as 
stated in § 117, the special case when m = 1, m = 0, gives
4*7T^

C = (365

2 * (0-0005779)3 ’ log G = 6’18557- 
It follows that
ms (m 4- m')-2 sin3 i = [3’81443 — 10] Kpr1 cos3 <£>
= [3 01625 - 10] K3P cos3 </>
and it is only this function of the masses, involving the unknown inclination 
of the orbit, which can be determined when only one spectrum can be 
observed.
If, however, the radial velocity V of the second component of the system 
can be measured at the same time, which is possible when the two superposed 
spectra are of comparable intensity,
m ( V — 7) 4- w/ (V' — 7) = 0.

119-121] 
Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries 
127
One such equation will give the ratio m : m when 7 is known and two will 
give 7 in addition without any knowledge of the orbit. It has been supposed 
that the radial velocities have been determined by referring the stellar 
spectrum to a comparison spectrum from a terrestrial source, as mentioned in 
§111. When there is no comparison spectrum, as when an objective prism 
is used, and the stellar spectrum shows double lines, it is still possible to 
deduce the orbit of the system from the relative displacements of corre­
sponding lines. But the orbit is then the relative orbit, a is the mean 
distance of the components from one another, and it is easily seen that 
(m 4- m') sin3 i must be substituted for the above function of the masses.
121. The true spectroscopic binary cannot be resolved in the telescope. 
But one or both components of a visual double can, when bright enough, be 
observed with the spectrograph, and very interesting results can be gained 
in this way. Let a, a' be the mean distances of the components relative to 
the centre of mass, expressed in terms of the linear unit 86400 km. The 
astronomical unit contains 1730 such units. Let a" be the visual mean 
distance and -gt" the parallax of the system, both expressed in seconds of arc. 
Then

If then the elements of the visual orbit have been independently determined 
and the radial velocity of the first component alone can be observed at 
different dates, the two quantities 7 and (1 4- m/m') ■gt" can be inferred. If 
the radial velocity of the second component can also be observed, the parallax, 
the ratio of the masses and hence the individual masses themselves in terms 
of the Sun (§ 104) can also be deduced. From the relative radial velocity 
alone,
V— V = 1730 p, sin i sec </> (cos u 4- e cos t») a” / -gt"
the parallax can be found, and hence the total mass of the system.
One question remains in the determination of the true orientation of a 
double star orbit in space, which can only be decided by radial velocity

observations. For the spectroscopic binary i has been defined so that 
0 < i < |7r, while for the visual double 0<t<7r. This difference does not 
affect sin?, which is positive in either case. Hence if Vlt F2 are the 
radial velocities of the principal star at different times, the two expressions
Fx — F2, cos 4- co) — cos (w2 + 60) 
have the same sign, where co is the longitude of periastron of this star, 
reckoned from its receding node in the direction of motion. But X is the 
longitude of periastron of the companion at its first node H (< 7r). Hence if 
the expressions
Fi — F2, cos (Wi + X) — cos (w2 + X)
have the same sign, X = co. Tfiis means that the principal star is receding 
and the companion is approaching when the latter is at its node ft. If on 
the other hand the expressions are of opposite signs, X = co + 7r and the 
companion is receding at fl.
Otherwise it may be possible to determine the velocities F, V of the 
principal star and the companion respectively at the same time. Then the 
expressions
F — V, cos (w + co) + e cos co 
have the same sign, and therefore if the expressions
F — V, cos (w + X) + e cos X
have the same sign, X = co, while if they have opposite signs, X = co + ir. The 
same consequences follow as before. Thus a knowledge of either Ft — F2 or 
F — V removes the ambiguity with regard to the true position of the orbital 
plane, which remains after the elements of a double star have been deter­
mined from visual observations alone.

CHAPTER XII
DYNAMICAL PRINCIPLES
122. It will be convenient in this chapter to recall some of the salient Ut
*  
features of dynamical theory and to consider as briefly as possible the form 
of those transformations which are of the greatest importance in astronomical 
applications. We shall start from Lagrange’s equations.
Let the system consist of a number of particles whose coordinates can be 
expressed in terms of n quantities q1} q^,...,qn and possibly of the time t. 
Let m be the mass of a typical particle situated at the point (x, y, z). 
Then

where X is the component of the force acting on m. If T is the kinetic 
energy of the whole system,
T = | m (x3 + y- 4- z~).
Hence adding all the equations of the preceding type for the three co­
ordinates and all the particles,

Now the forces which occur in astronomical problems are in general con­
servative, and we can write

where dU is a perfect differential. U represents the work done by the 
forces in a change from the actual configuration to some standard configu­
ration and is called the potential energy. We therefore have
d = d(y~^)

But U does not contain qr, and hence, if we write T =U + L, this becomes

The function L is often called the Kinetic Potential. In the absence of

Then T is a homogeneous (positive definite) quadratic form in q1} ...,qn-
123. If L does not contain t explicitly, the equations admit an integral 
called the Integral of Energy. For in this case

where h is a constant of integration. Replacing L by T— U, where T is a 
homogeneous quadratic form in qr and U does not contain qr, we have
h = 2T-(T- U) = T + U
which shows that h is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies.
More generally, let L contain t explicitly through U and let T no longer 
be a homogeneous function in qr but of the form T2 + 
+ To, where T.2 is a
homogeneous quadratic function, a linear function and To of no dimensions 
in qr. Then similarly

an equation which applies to relative motion. When U does not contain t
T2-T0+U=h.
When U does contain t the equation
Tt-T, = - f/ + f^dt + h
J dt
is a purely formal integral because it is to be understood that any coordinates 
occurring in dU/dt are expressed in terms of t before integration. This 
implies a knowledge of the complete solution of the problem. But the 
equation is not without its uses. Thus if U= Uo+ U', where Uo does not 
contain t and the effect of U' is small in comparison with the effect of Uo, 
preliminary values of the coordinates in terms of t may be found. When 
these are inserted in dU'/dt a closer approximation to the true integral will 
be obtained and the process can be repeated. The true meaning of the 
equation is therefore connected with a method of approximation.
124. 
The above form (2) of the integral of energy is directly connected 4 
with the Hamiltonian form of the equations of motion whereby the n 
Lagrangian equations of the second order are replaced by a system of 
2n equations of the first order. For we may write
The n equations for pr are linear in qr and when solved express qr in 
terms of (qr, pr), this symbol being used, where no ambiguity is to be feared, 
to denote all the quantities qlt qn, Pi, })■>,■■■, pn- Hence L and H can 
be expressed either in terms of (qr, qr) or of (qr, pr\ Thus

Let us consider the differential form
de = ^prdqr-Hdt
or
d (2pr gr-0) = ^ qr dpr + H dt.
If dO is a perfect differential, the right-hand side of both equations must 
also be perfect differentials, and this requires that
_ dH dqr _ dH

or the canonical equations must be satisfied. Let us suppose now a trans­
formation from the variables (qr, pr) to the variables (Qr, Pr) such that
S PrdQr — ^prdqr = — dW................................(4)
where cHV is a perfect differential and W is expressible either in terms of 
(gr, pr) or of (Qr, Pr)- Such a transformation is called a contact transforma­

Since these equations equally with the form (3) express the conditions

This equation is known as the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. But when K = 0,
P, = £, Qr = «r
where ar and j8r, by (5), are arbitrary constants. Hence if any function W 
can be found which satisfies (8) and contains n arbitrary constants (ar) in

the 2n equations (7) written in the form

problem which are defined by (12). This is the foundation of Lagrange’s 
method of the variation of arbitrary constants. The simple form of (12) 
depends essentially on the function K being expressed in terms of the 
constants which occur in a solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation and 
which may be called a set of canonical constants.
If we suppose that the problem defined by Ho has been solved by some 
other method than through the medium of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation, a 
different set of constants will be obtained. Let Am be a typical member of 
such a set. Then Am is some function of (ar, /3r). Hence

8J = [ ( — bH 4- ^qrbpr 4- Xpr^qr) dt 
J to
= ^Xprfy/j 4- I (- bH 4- ^qr^Pr - ^pr^qr) dt
where 8 denotes a change in (qr, pr) but leaves t at each point unaltered. 
Hence bJ = 0 if bqr = 0 at the limits and if the canonical equations are 
satisfied. And this proves Hamiltons principle that in the passage from 
one fixed configuration to another the integral J has a stationary value for 
the actual motion as compared with any other neighbouring motion in which 
the time at corresponding points is the same.

Hence when two neighbouring forms of motion, each compatible with the 
canonical equations, are compared, the complete variation between two

Accordingly, if the initial time is taken as fixed and (ar, are the initial 
values of (qr, pr), we have
^r=p-
and
But this is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Hence the integral J is a par­
ticular solution of this equation. And further, since we have reproduced the 
equations (8) and (9) of § 126 except that J is written in the place of W, we 
see that J is that solution which contains the initial values of the coordinates 
as its n arbitrary constants.

This is the complete variation of J and it vanishes between fixed terminal 
points if 8A = 0 in each intermediate position, i.e. if the time is assigned to 
each displaced position in such a way that the equation If = A is satisfied in 
the varied motion. Under these conditions the integral
J = f' (L + A) dt = [*'(7-

136 
Dynamical Principles 
[ch. xii
has a stationary value in the course of the actual motion as compared with 
motion in any neighbouring paths.
This integral is called the action and the proposition established is known 
as the principle of least action. When T is a quadratic function of the 
velocities h = T+U and the integral becomes

and in problems which involve only one material particle this is simply
J= f v2dt = [ vds ...........................(16)

where v is the velocity of the particle (of unit mass).
The integrals which we have found to be stationary are not necessarily 
minima. The necessary conditions in order that an integral
J = [ f(qr> qr) dt

shall be an actual minimum are:
(1) The first variation 8 J vanishes between fixed terminal points.
(2) The function of (er)

. Between the terminal positions 0 and 1 no intermediate position P 
exists such that 0 and P can be joined by a neighbouring path which satisfies 
the dynamical conditions and is other than the path considered. The nearest 
point to 0 on the path which does not satisfy this condition is called the 
kinetic focus of the point 0.
130. It is necessary to study the properties of certain expressions 
connected with the transformations which are frequently employed. Let 
u1} u2,..., u2n be 2n distinct functions of (qr, pr). The first expression is
V flqr fyr _ fyr = <Kqr, pr)

which is called a Lagrange's bracket and is denoted by [uh um]. The second 
expression is
2 3Um_dUm duj\ O (uf, Un) 
■ r \dqr’dpr fyr ‘ fyr) r (qr, pr) ....................' '
This is called a Poissons bracket and will be denoted here by the symbol 
{ui, um}. It is evident that we have
[ui, utn] = - [um; U[],

[ui, ut] = {uh ui] = 0.

divided by that determinant. Any Lagrange’s bracket is thus expressible in 
terms of Poisson’s brackets, and vice versa.

It is at once evident that these conditions may be written
[Pz, P„l] = 0, [&, QJ = 0
for all values of I and m,
[&, P„J = 0
for all unequal values of I and m, and
[&, Pz] = l
for all values of I. In other words, in the case of a contact transformation 
all the Lagrange’s brackets vanish with the exception of those which are of 
the form [Qz, PJ, and these are all unity.
Let us now put
ur=Qr, un+r = Pr, (r=l, 2,..., n).
Then the substitution (19) becomes simply
a?r = ^n_|_r, xn^.r= zr.
But this shows that all the Poisson’s brackets occurring in (20) vanish 
except those which,;ire of the form \ui, ?zz±n|, and these may be written
{Qi, Pi\ = 1 or {P;, Qi\ = — 1.
The conditions for a contact transformation are therefore of the same simple 
form whether expressed in terms of Lagrange’s or of Poisson’s brackets.
Again, the substitutions of § 130,

131, 132] 
Dynamical Principles 
139
become identical when m = n + I, since zn+i = xt. Hence
dqr _ dPt dpr _ _ dPi 
3Qi ~ dpr ’

But when I = n + m, they are identical except for an opposite sign throughout, 
since xn+m = — zm, and thus
^Qr __ dQm ftp? _ dQm
&Pm ~ 3pr ’ dPm ~ i>qr'
These relations hold for all values of I, m or r not exceeding n.
132. 
Let us consider the transformation
Qr = qr + eg/, Pr = Pr + ep/
where qr',pi are any functions of (qr, pr) and e is an infinitesimal constant.
If the transformation is an infinitesimal contact transformation,
d W = t {(pr + ep/) d (qr + eg/) - prdqr] 
r
= e S (pr'dqr + prdqr) 
r
is a perfect differential. Hence we may write
e 2 (pr'dqr - qr'dpr) = d ( W — e Sprg/)

where K may be any function of (gr, pr). Accordingly 
, dK , dK 
q'=fyr’ Pr=~^r
and the general form of an infinitesimal contact transformation is given by

where K is an arbitrary function of (gr, pr).
If for e we write the equations (22) become
ggz=aA ^pr = _dK 
i>t dpr ’ dt dqr
and comparing this form with that of the canonical equations of motion we 
see that the progressive motion of a system from point to point corresponds 
to a succession of infinitesimal contact transformations.

produce an increment

with a similar set of conditions arising from the equations for dpr. But 
it is evident that all these conditions will be satisfied if K is an integral 
of the system, for then K = 0. We thus see that if K is an integral, the 
equations (22) are a particular solution of the equations for the disturbed 
motion.
134. 
Let u be another integral of the undisturbed system. Then u + Au 
must also have a constant value in the disturbed motion. But by (23)
Au = e [u, K]
when the disturbed motion is that obtained by the infinitesimal contact 
transformation derived from K. Hence [u, K\ must be constant, and we 
have Poisson’s theorem: if u and K are two integrals of a system, the 
Poisson’s bracket {u, K} is also an integral. It might be supposed that a 
knowledge of two integrals would thus lead to the discovery of all the 

133, 134] 
Dynamical Principles 
141
integrals of a problem. This is not so in general. The known integrals are 
more often of a generic type, particularly in the case of those gravitational 
problems with which we have to deal, and fall into closed groups. For 
example, if we start from two integrals of area we obtain by Poisson’s theorem 
the third integral of the same type and no further progress can be made in 
this way. In order to obtain fresh information it is necessary to start from 
integrals which are special to the problem considered.
Let u2,..., Uzn be 2n distinct integrals of the problem. Then each 
Poisson’s bracket of the type tz8} is constant throughout the motion. But 
we have seen in § 130 that a Lagrange’s bracket [«r, u8] can be expressed in 
terms of all the Poisson’s brackets. Hence [ur, u8] is also constant through­
out the motion. But this gives no means of finding additional integrals of 
the problem, for in order to calculate [ur, ?/8] it is first necessary to express 
(?r, pr) in terms of the 2n integrals (ur). And this presupposes that the 
problem has been completely solved.

CHAPTER XIII
VARIATION OF ELEMENTS

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation corresponding to elliptic motion 
about a fixed centre of attraction is very simply solved when the variables 
are expressed in polar coordinates (r, I, X), so that (I, X having the same 
relation to one another as longitude and latitude)
qi = r, q2 = K q3 = l.
Then, after suppressing the factor m in the potential energy U and therefore 
treating the mass factor in the momenta as unity,
U = — pr~\ p = k2 (1 + m) = n2a3
2T = r2 + r2X2 + r2cos2X.Z2

where 0lt /92, /?3 are three additional constants. The lower limit r0 is also 
arbitrary. It may be identified with the pericentric distance, and then the 
integrals depending on ?' will vanish at the pericentre.
136. We have now to determine the meaning of the six constants of 
integration. Since the integral in the first equation vanishes at perihelion, 
& is clearly the time at this point. Also, by the same equation,
= 2ot! (r - r\) (?' -
But at an apse, r = 0 and r = a (1 + e). These then are the values of r1} r2, 
and hence
fj, = — 2a an a/ = — 2a2 (1 — e2) a2 
or
«i = - /i/2a, a2 = 
(1 — e2)}-
Also if we put a3/a.2 = cos i the second and third equations become on 
integration
— /92 = — f (?') + sin-1 (sin X/sin i)
— /93 = I — sin-1 (tan X/tan i) 
or
sin X = sin i sin {/i (r) — /32]
tan X = tan i sin (I + /?3).
This last equation shows that the motion takes place in a fixed plane making 
the angle i with the plane X = 0, which may be taken to represent, for 
example, the ecliptic, with I and X as the longitude and latitude of the 
planet. Thus the meaning of a3 = a2 cos i is defined, and - is simply the 
longitude of the node. The preceding equation then shows that (r) — /32 is 
the angle between the radius vector of the planet and the line of nodes, 
i.e. the argument of latitude. But at perihelion the integral f (r) vanishes. 
Hence — $2 is simply the angle in the orbit from the node to perihelion, 
or -nr — fl in the ordinary notation. The canonical elements which we 

144
Variation of Elements
[CH. XIII
have introduced can therefore be expressed in terms of the usual elements 
(T being reckoned from the epoch when the mean longitude is e) thus:
«! = —/x/2a, 
/3j = T- — (e — cr)/n
«2=V{/xa(l “ &)}, 
/32= —■cr + ft
a3 = ^{pa (1 — e2)} cos i, ft3 = —SI.
The homogeneity of these constants will be increased by introducing a = 
instead of aA. This makes 2^ = —/x2/a2 and W= W' + pst/Zd2. Hence & 
will be replaced by /3, where

Since the integral vanishes at perihelion, and t = T at this point, 
£=^=. A.7’ = n7’=-e + ^.
The other constants are easily seen not to be affected by the change in otj, 
which can accordingly be replaced by
a=y/(pa), ft = tiT = — e +
where e is the mean longitude of the planet at the time t = 0.
137. The expressions for a, a2, a3, ft, ft2, ft3 in terms of the ordinary 
elliptic elements which have just been found make it very easy to calculate 
the Lagrange’s brackets
r q v (da dft 3/3 da\ 
lu, v]
where u, v are any pair of the six elements a, e, i, ft, cr, e. Since a, a2, a3 are 
functions of a, e, i alone and /3, /32, /33 are functions of SI, w, e alone, the 
Lagrange’s bracket for any pair of either set of three elements vanishes. It 
is equally evident on inspection that [e, e], [i, cr] and [i, e] also .vanish, the 
two constituents never occurring in a corresponding pair of canonical constants. 
Hence the complete array of Lagrange’s brackets may be set out thus:

The six Poisson’s brackets are thus all known.
139. A solution of the  Hamilton-Jacobi equation, involving the six 
• arbitrary constants a, a2, a3, /3, /32, has been found for the case of un­
disturbed elliptic motion relative to the Sun. When the action of the other 
planets is taken into account, the potential energy U becomes U — R, 
where R is the disturbing function and is expressed by (§ 23)
*
Hence H becomes Ho— R and consequently by § 127 the constants of the 
approximate problem are in the more complete problem subject to variations 
which are defined by the equations
dar _ dR d[3r _ &R. 
dt ~ dfir’ dt +3a,.‘
Here R is supposed to be expressed in terms of the constants mentioned in 
§ 136, which refer to the motion of the planet considered undisturbed, and 
the time as it occurs in the expression of the coordinates of the disturbing 
planets. When instead of the canonical constants arising in the solution of 
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation the ordinary elements of elliptic motion are 
employed, the equations for the variations are no longer of the above simple 
type, but take the more complicated form

expressions for all the Poisson’s brackets, the equations for the variation of

A slight simplification has been made by writing sin <j> in place of e in the 
coefficients of the partial differentials of R.

140. The above set of equations for the variations of the elements is
fundamental. An important point must be noticed in regard to them. The 
variation of a entails a corresponding variation of n which is determined by 
the relation n2a3 = p. Now the disturbing function R is a periodic function 
of the mean anomaly and is expressed in terms of circular functions of mul­
tiples of nt. Hence the derivative of R with respect to a would contain the 
same circular functions multiplied by t and this introduction of terms not 
purely periodic would be inconvenient. The difficulty is avoided by an 
artifice which should be carefully noted.
We consider n (as distinct from a) to occur only in the arguments of these 
periodic terms. Otherwise a is used explicitly or if it is more convenient to 
use n outside the arguments, n is simply a function of a given by^z2a3 = p. 
Now e enters into R only in the form nt + e through the mean anomaly,

If then we take e' instead of e, where

the form of the above equations for the variations of the six elements will be 
unaltered, since

but their natural meaning will be so far altered that (1) n in the mean

141. When e (and therefore </>) is small, and this is commonly the case, 
the coefficients in the variations of e and w which contain cot </> as a factor 
become large. This gives rise to a difficulty which can be avoided by intro­
ducing the transformation

Similarly, when the angle between the plane of the orbit and the plane of

large, and the transformation

142. Another form of the equations for the variations of the elements, 
in which the disturbing forces appear explicitly, is of great importance. Let 
S, T be the components of these forces in the plane of the orbit along the 
radius vector and perpendicular to it, and W the component normal to the 
plane. Let u be the argument of latitude and (X, p, v) the direction cosines 
of the radius vector, so that (§ 65)
X = cos u cos fl — sin it sin fl cos i
p, = cos u sin fl + sin u cos fl cos i 
v = sin u sin i.
The direction cosines of the transversal and of the normal to the plane may

It has been convenient to derive the above important set of equations from 
those which involve the derivatives of the disturbing function. But their 
form would be the same if the components of the forces were not such as can 
be expressed as the differentials of a single function. Thus they hold, for 
example, in the case of elliptic motion disturbed by a resisting medium.
Since n2as = p is constant, the equation for the variation of a may be 
replaced by

143. It has been seen in § 139 how the canonical solution of the problem 
of undisturbed elliptic motion leads to the canonical equations appropriate to 
the form of motion which follows from the introduction of disturbing forces.

But there is here a change in the meaning of R due to replacing the element 
— /3 by the mean anomaly I. If the disturbing function in the usual form 
quoted in § 139 be denoted by Ro, the variation of I follows from 
d 
dR0 dR dR»
and therefore
R = Ro — jndL = R0 — g?L~
*dL
 = Ro + pl2/2L~.
This change in R has no effect in the other equations, and since R is a 
function of e — ur 4- nt, dRfdl is the same thing as — dRjdfl. The above 
canonical equations are precisely those on which Delaunay’s theory of the 
Moon is based.

Without changing L let the transformation

be made. Then
XdL 4- 
4- &>2</p2 — (IdL + gdG + hdH') = 0
and this expression is therefore a perfect differential. Hence by § 125 the 
transformation from the variables
I, g, h 
to the variables
A, Pi, Paj X, <0i,
is one which leaves the equations of motion in the canonical form. The 
angle X = e 4- '/if is the mean longitude', and Wj = - ■nr, g>2 = — fl are the longi­
tudes of perihelion and the node, reversed in sign.
Again, consider the transformation
£ = (2p)^ cos cd, i] = (2p)2 sin cd.
In this case
rjd^— cadp = — 2p sin2 cadco + sin cd cos cadp — cd dp
= d {p (| sin 2g> — &>)}
is a, perfect differential. Hence the variables L, p1} p.2; X, cd19 cd2 can be 
changed to
L, £>; \ Vi, V2
and the canonical form of the equations will still be preserved. These 
variables have been used extensively by Poincare. Since
Pi = L — G = 2 sin2 j <£>
(sin<£> = e), ir]A are of the order of the eccentricity, and are called by him 
the eccentric variables- Similarly, since
p2 = G — H =2 V(pp) sin2
£2, % are of the same order as the inclination, and are therefore called the 
oblique variables.
144. The account which will be given of the lunar theory in later 
chapters will be based on a method which is quite different from Delaunay’s. 
But the latter is in reality very general and therefore Delaunay’s mode of 
integrating the canonical equations of the previous section will now be 
indicated. The form of the disturbing function will be taken to be
R = — B — A cos 14- i2g 4- i3h 4- i^nt 4- q) 4- A
= — B — A cos 3 4- Rj. = Ro 4- Ri
where R2 represents an aggregate of periodic terms similar to the one written 
down and n', q are constants. The term B and the coefficients A are 
functions of L, G, H only and in comparison with B these coefficients are 
small quantities of definite orders. Let
Pj = i114- i2g + i3h = 0 — i4n't — q.

At this point (G, g', h'; c, — G', — H') are absolute constants, resulting from 
the solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation when the Hamiltonian function is 
R — Rt. Hence, by § 127, the further treatment of the problem depends on

145. 
In the partial solution
G = By + A cos#, = V [A2 - (C - BO2) = A sin 0 
where Bn A are functions of 0 (and the constants G, G', H'), and 0, 0 are 
functions of t to be determined. The forms to be expected may be seen in 
this way. The above equations give
0=/(cos0), -/'(cos0)f = ^
and therefore
t + c = J<£> (cos &) d0 — 0[0O + ’Ztr sin r0
when 0 vanishes with t + c. Hence 0 — 0O (t + c) is an odd periodic function 
of 0 and therefore of X = 0G (t + c). Thus, 0O being some constant,
0 = X + %0r sin ?’X,. X = 0O (t + c) 
and
0 = /(cos 0) = ©0 + -©, cos rX.
These forms, which without a critical examination of the conditions have 
only been made plausible, are actually found in practice. It follows that

[ch. xiii
Now, since 0 and 0 contain C, G', H', these constants also enter into g0, h0 
and therefore into the coefficients of t in the arguments of the terms in R}. 
Hence t will appear outside the circular functions in the derivatives of Rx 
with respect to C, G', H'. This inconvenient circumstance must be avoided 
by a change of variables. Now
d [ 0d® = 0d® - (t + c)dC + (g -g')dG' + (h - h') dH'
by the form of the partial solution, and therefore
d (Ct - 0 d0) = - ®d0 - cdC + {g - g') dG' + (h - h') dH' + Cdt.
This is a perfect differential and when each side is expanded in the form of 
a secular and a periodic part, the same must clearly hold true for each part 
separately, at least when the number of periodic terms is finite; and in
practice the remainder after a certain number of terms must be treated as 
negligible. Butfd0
— (0O + X0r cos rX) (1 + Sr 0r cos rX) 
= Ao + SA,, cos rX, Ao= 0o + |Sr0,.0r.
Hence, when the periodic terms are omitted,
Cdt — AodX — cdC + g0(t + c) dG' + h0 (t + c) dH'
is a perfect differential, to which d (A0X) may be added; and therefore the 
variables
0, G', H'; c, g', h’
can be replaced by
Ao, G', H'; X, k, t}
where
K = f + <h 0 + c)> V = I1' + h0(t+ c).
This follows from § 125, which shows that at the same time R^ must be 
replaced by — C. All is now expressed in terms of the last set of variables, 
and secular terms are thus removed from the arguments of the terms in R1.
It is convenient to make a final simple transformation. Since
(i’iX' — X) cZAo + i2KdA0 + is7}dA0 = — d (Ao(tint + 9)} + i^n'A^dt 
if
z'iX' =• X — i2K — i-iT) — i^n't — q 
the variables
Ao, G', H'; X, k, 7} 
can be replaced by
A' = Ao, G" = G' + ?<2A0, H" = H' + z3 Ao; Xz, k, 
but at the same time it is necessary to add Ao to R^ — C. Thus finally, if

146. If the value of X' be compared with the expression for I in terms of 
X it will now be seen that
I = Xz + S (0r — i2g,. — iji,} sin rX 
and thus X' and I differ only by periodic terms. The same is true of k, g and 
rj, h. The periodic terms would disappear with A, as also those in © and 0, 
and Ao would coincide with Bo and ©. Hence the final variables are the 
same as the original variables when A = 0. The form of R ’ differs from that 
t)f R mainly in the complete removal of the term A cos 0, and naturally the 
most important term will be first selected for elimination. Periodic terms 
will be introduced into the arguments of R', but it is easily seen that on 
expansion they give rise to periodic terms of a higher order than A cos 0.
The same process can be repeated indefinitely, until all sensible terms are 
one by one removed, together with those of a higher order introduced at an 
earlier stage. It has been assumed that is not zero. If = 0, i2g or ish 
can take the place of I. There are also terms for which = i2 = is = 0. In 
the lunar problem these depend on the mean longitude of the Sun and are 
removed by a single preliminary operation analogous to the above.
Delaunay’s expression for the disturbing function contains over 300 
periodic terms, and their removal involves practically 500 operations of the 
above kind, reduced to the application of a set of formal rules. This 
immensely laborious task was carried out unaided. But the result is the 
most perfect analytical solution which has yet been found for the satellite 
type of motion in the problem of three bodies. The solution is not limited 
to the actual case of the Moon, since it is expressed in general algebraic 
terms. The satellite type of motion may indeed be defined as that type for 
which the Delaunay expansions are valid. It seems an interesting problem 
of the future whether such satellites as Jupiter VIII and IX will be found 
to satisfy this definition. Their conditions differ widely from those of the 
lunar problem, in particular in the fact that the motions are retrograde.

CHAPTER XIV
THE DISTURBING FUNCTION
147. The development of the disturbing function R in a suitable form 
gives rise to many difficulties, partly of analysis, partly of practical computa­
tion, and is the subject of an extensive literature
.
 It is possible to deal 
here only with a few of the more important points.
*
The principal part of the disturbing function for two planets involves the 
expansion of A-1, the reciprocal of their mutual distance. It is therefore 
important to consider the nature of this expansion, or rather of A-2* in 
general, where s is half an odd integer. For this more general form will 
give the derivatives of A-1, A2 being a rational quantity, and these will 
naturally occur when A-J is expanded in terms of any contained parameter.
It is convenient to consider first the case of two circular, coplanar orbits. 
Then, if H is the difference of longitude in the plane,
A2 = aT2 + a/ — 2aj a2 cos H
ch, a2 being the radii of the orbits. Let
a1<a2, a:=a1la2, tH=\ogz, t2 = —1 
and therefore
a2~2 A2 = 1 + a2 — 2a cos H = (1 — az) (1 — as-1).
Hence the function to be examined is
F~s = (1 — az)~e (1 — az~l)~s = 12 bjz'
- OD
= (1 + a2 — 2a cos H)~8 = %bs° + S bs*cos iH.
Since the function is unaltered when z and are interchanged, bs~i = bgi, 
and i may be treated as positive. The coefficients are called Laplaces 
coefficients. By Fourier’s theorem,

The Disturbing Function 
159
The first (complex) integral is due to Cauchy; the path of integration is ' 
taken round a circle of unit radius. By introducing the Weierstrassian 
elliptic function
V (u) = z -1 (a + a-1)
Cauchy’s integral clearly becomes an elliptic function, and Poincare has 
shown how this function can be reduced to a calculable form. But another 
method will be followed here.
The coefficients 6/ are easily developed as power series in a-. For, with 
the use of gamma functions,
(1 - az)~8 (1 - az-1)-8 = S \ +- T) apzp . v (s + 9) aq -q

But this can be recognized as a hypergeometric series, and when it is 
expressed in the ordinary notation,

By the known properties of the hypergeometric series, this expansion is 
convergent when a < 1. There are many equivalent forms, but (2) is enough 
for the present purpose.
148. Laplace’s coefficients are subject to several formulae of recurrence, 
which facilitate their calculation. That such exist follows from the known 
relations between sets of three contiguous hypergeometric functions. Instead 
of finding them directly, a more general function
may be considered, for this reduces to 6/ when j=0. In the integral (1) 
write z = a£, and then

Derivatives of the latter with respect to a can then be expressed as linear

Newcomb’s method of calculating the coefficients bj, together with 
their derivatives in the form subsequently required, can now be explained.

The development is to be carried to a definite order fixed by i = k, say 11. 
In the first place p^’i is calculated for the required values of n, j by a direct 
method. Next pnk~A,\ ..., ppi are deduced in succession by (7). For i = 1, 
s = |, the formula (3) becomes

whence epi (zz = 3, 5, ...) are found in succession. It only remains to form 
On'3 = Pn’3 Cn^'i (i'■ = 1, 2, ...) and the calculation is then complete. The 
successive derivatives are finally derived by the use of (6).
The employment of a chain of recurrence formulae in practical computa­
tions requires care, because they are apt to involve an accumulation of 
numerical error. It is the merit of Newcomb’s method here described that 
it is not only simple but very accurate.
150. The quantities which must be calculated directly are Cj0’0 andpP\

rapidly a few terms suffice to give its value. By this method Newcomb 
determined the required values of pnk’i.

and this is the required form. The relation between the alternate constituents 
is obvious enough, for the substitution of j 4- 2 for j and n — 2 for n (or 8 — 1 
for 8) clearly has the effect of increasing each factor by 1 in the numerators 
and by 2 in the denominators. As i = k is a fairly large number in the direct 
calculation of pn,3> the even constituents are small and the calculation is 
based on an odd number of terms (generally five). With the use of subtraction 
logarithms the process is rapid.
152. The next step is to consider two circular orbits in planes inclined at 
an angle J. Let Ll} L2 be the longitudes in the two planes, reckoned from 
the common node, and let
p = cos21 J, v = sin21 J, + v = 1
x = Zq — L2, y = Li + L2.
Then the angular distance between the planets is given by

It is easy to continue these developments further, and this is the method 
used by Le Verrier and Newcomb. But its validity is limited. The binomial 
expansion (10) of a2A-1 is convergent only when
I 1 + a2 — 2a cos x I 
| 2a (cos y — cos x) ■
and since the most unfavourable case, cosx = — cosy = 1, must be included
sin2 ^,T =v <{1 — a)2/4a.
It has been proved by H. v. Zeipel that the same limit applies to the 
expansion of Jacobi’s coefficients b^t This condition is satisfied in all cases 
by the small inclinations of the orbital planes of the major planets.
153. Among the orbits of the minor planets, however, are some whose 
inclinations to the plane of Jupiter exceed the above limit. It is therefore 
desirable to find a more general form of development. Let

Hence either pA = p2 or p2 is independent of t. The first case has the more

The second condition may be written

But the direct expansion of F~s shows that since cosix cosjy arises from

Now B\j is a polynomial in v with a constant term, and this equation gives 
the law of its coefficients. But the equation is clearly of the form satisfied 
by a hypergeometric series. Hence
Anitj = cp'viFii +j — n, i +j + 1 + n, 2j + 1, v) ........... (15)

development in powers of a, namely
cl, A-1 = S a”. A\j cosia? cosjy, (n>i+j). 
n,i,j
The determination of the constant c may be deferred.
155. This is the simplest, most obvious application of the method. But 
its possibilities, though limited, are not exhausted. The first condition for 
its use is also satisfied by making p2 a constant. This may be expressed by
Pi = sin- ps = ®m2^Jo, p, = cos-JJ cosv = sin sin
where JQ is to be treated initially as constant, though finally it will be 
identified with J. The relation p + v = 1 no longer holds formally, but is 
replaced by
. /x2/cos21 Jo + ir/sin21 Jo = 1
and the result of differentiating this twice with respect to t and eliminating 
tan|J0 shows that the right-hand side of the second condition (14) is 1. 
Therefore s = 1. At first sight this case has no present interest, since s is 
not half an odd integer, but the reason for considering it further will be 
seen later.
The development will be in powers of sin2|J as before, but it will be 
convenient first to make t = | J, so that
p' = — sin | J cos Jo, v = cos | J sin | Jo, p" = — p, v” =- v.

determines the formation of its coefficients. But again it is an equation 
of the type satisfied by a hypergeometric series. Hence
where cy is independent of r. But p and v, and therefore T\j, involve J9 
symmetrically with J, and therefore it is evident that contains as a factor 
the same polynomial with r replaced by r0 = sin2 %J0. Hence
T% = c2F(t0)F(t)
where c2 is a constant independent of r and r0. This is clearly general, 
whatever the values of J and Jo. A return to the actual problem can now 
be made by putting Jo = J, and then r = v and

which completes the determination of Hansen’s development.
The results obtained for inclined circular orbits may now be summarized. 
Since
cos ia cosjy = cos i (LA — Z2) cos j (L^ + Z2)
= j cos [(a + j) A - (a -j) Z2] +1 cos [(a -j) F - (a + j) ZJ
it is possible to write
= 
(p^^X^X/s 2a = l^+^l, 27=1^-^ |
where log Xj = lLx , log X2 = lL2 ; and it has been shown how the coefficient 
A(pi,p2) can l>e developed (1) in powers of v = sin2|J, (2) in powers of 
« = «!/«£>, (3) as a series in Laplace’s coefficients.
157. The preceding developments of A-1 or A-28 apply to circular orbits, 
but they are not on that account to be regarded as mere approximations to 
the forms actually appropriate to the orbits of the solar system. On the 
contrary they constitute the essential source from which the latter forms 
must be generated by the most convenient means. Now quite generally
A2 = r/ + r22 — 2r1r2 cos H
and Llf L2 must be replaced by a)1 + w1, <o2 + w2, where <o2 are the 
longitudes of perihelion reckoned from the common node, and wlt w2 are the 
true anomalies. When the eccentricities e1} e2 vanish the radii r2 become

The Disturbing Function

the mean distances a2, and wlt ix2 can be identified with the mean 
anomalies Mx, M2. The corresponding value of A may be written Ao.
Taylor’s theorem can be expressed in the familiar symbolical form
j\*
 + y)= exp. (y = exp. (yD)f(x)
which means simply that if the exponential function be expanded as though yD 
were an algebraic quantity, the result otherwise known to be true is formally 
reproduced. Thus generally,
/(^i + yi, a?2 + y2,...) = exp. A + y2 A + ...)/(«!, x2, ...)
where A operates on xr alone. Now when = e2 = 0,
Ao-1 =/(«,, t^, A, A)
is an expansion of which the form has been completely determined. The 
more convenient developments refer not to r — a but r/a, and the change 
from the argument a to the argument r is made additive by taking log a as 
the variable instead of a. Thus in the present case
xx = log Oj, 
x2 = log a2, 
xs = L1 = cox + 
, x4 = L2 = w2 + M2
yx = logrx/ax, y2=^gr2/a2, y:i = Wi-Nx, yi = w2-M2

and
A9 (XW) = (t^^X^-XA A9 (X^X/O =

where log XT = t (c^ + J/i), log X2 = t (<o2 + M2), log .a, = tM1} logz2 = tM2, and 
the symbols X are respectively functions of ey, A and e2, D2.
158. 
This leads immediately to Newcomb’s operators as defined by 
Poincare. For the functions X can be expanded in positive powers of e, 
so that
-211,’“' (D,, Pt) e^, 
= 2 n».(A. Pi!)
where — | i |, m2 — j j | = 0, 2, ..., since Xin’m is of the order eli-mi at least. 
The operators H are combined by Newcomb in the notation
nA (A, Pi) ha (A, Pi) = n~?0 n°o:p
but the combined symbols, though tabulated by him over a wide range, seem 
to present no practical advantage over the constituent operators.
The final form of the development of A-1 can therefore be written
A-1 = 2 X^X2^ S eA>eA S z^zjSX^ (D1} pi) HA (— 1 — A, pi) A (plt p2) 
Pi, Pi m\-> m2 
i, 3
and the completion of this part of the problem depends on the practical 
treatment of Newcomb’s operators H, which are polynomials in D, p of 
degree m, with numerical coefficients.
The definition of the symbols is given by
2nr(AP)^=sx^=g)2’(5)’'.
Hence in particular
S IIA (A 0) e™zi = 
2 Hi”1 (0, p) emzi =

and therefore
S Hi”1 (A p) = t Ha (A 0) e,nzi. S H/ (0, p) ^zl

n, j
Comparison of the coefficients of emzi on both sides then gives
Hf1 (D, p) = S H/ (A 0) H"_? (0, p) 
n,j 
1 1
where n = 0, 1,..., m,, and j has all the values which make n — \j\ and 
m — n — | i —j | positive integers (including 0). This formula, due in another 

157-159] 
The Disturbing Function

notation to Cowell, makes the calculation of IItm (D, p) depend on the 
expansion of r/a and x?.
But these are known forms. The first is given by (22) in Chapter IV. 
Means of deriving the latter have been given in § 45. In fact
Xj;;=sn?»(o,2>)e» 
*
and therefore it is necessary to expand in powers of e and the resulting 
coefficients will represent Uim (0, p). They are purely numerical and can be 
tabulated for all moderate values of m, i and p. Other methods have been 
suggested to facilitate the calculation of Newcomb’s operators. But the 
above will suffice to make clear the principles involved.
159. 
The disturbing function due to the complete action of a single 
planet can now be considered. By (3) of § 23 this is
R = Gm' {a " 73 
+yy'+zz')}
where (x, y, z), (x, y, z') are the heliocentric coordinates of the disturbed and 
disturbing planets; r' is the radius vector of the latter. The constant G 
may be reduced to unity by the choice of appropriate units, and the dis­
turbing mass m may be understood as a common factor to be restored 
ultimately. Thus
R = (r2 4- r'2 _ 2rr' cos H) ~ * — rr'~2 cos H
where H has its previous meaning, the mutual elongation of the two planets 
as seen from the Sun. The principal part, already discussed, is symmetrical 
in r, r', but the indirect part is not so. Hence a distinction must be drawn, 
according as the disturbing planet is superior, when r = rn r' = r2> or the 
disturbing planet is inferior, when r = r2, r =rv Now when the eccen­
tricities vanish, by § 152,
a2A-1 = b°’° 4- 251’0 cos x + 250’1 cosy + ...
cos H = p cos x + v cos y 
and
R — A-1 = bR = — aa'~2 (p cos x + v cos y)
is the correction required to change A-1 into R. This can be effected by 
giving corrections to 51’0 and 6”’1, thus
2bb1,0/p — 226°’ 1/v = — a2aa'~2
= — a (a' > a); — a-2 (a > a')
where a < 1 always and a' is the mean distance of the disturbing planet. If 
these corrections are carried into the expansion in terms of v (§ 152), as used in 

174 
The Disturbing Function 
[ch. xiv
the chief planetary theories, it will affect the Laplace’s coefficients only to 
this extent:
8b,1 = — a, 8b3° = — 2 (a > a) 
2 
2
8b.1 — — a-2, 8b.0 = — 2a-3 (a > a') 
2 
2
for it is easily verified that these changes will give the required corrections 
to b1*0, b0>1. In the exponential form they apply equally to b-1;^ b0’-1, 
and b^-1. Thus the indirect term is very simply incorporated in Ro, in 
which Ci = e2 = 0, and the full expansion of R in terms of the eccentricities 
can then be deduced in the manner explained for the development of A 
from Ao.
It is most important to remark that while the indirect part modifies the 
coefficients of certain elementary periodic terms, it affects in no way the 
constant term which is independent of the time.
160. 
Another order of development is possible by expanding A-1 initially 
in terms of 7i/r2. If this ratio is small, as in the case of the solar perturba­
tions of the lunar orbit, this method has great advantages. By § 153 this 
expansion takes the form
A-1 = S 
A\j cos ix cos jy
n, i.j
where A\j is given by (15) and x, y have their true meanings,
Ik, + W2 = a)] + Wi + (a>2 + w2).
It is more convenient to use the exponential form, and with a slight change 
of notation for the coefficients,
A-1 = S 
n (px, pi) pf
*
 pJh
n, pt, pt
where log px = i + wj, log p2 = i (<w2 + w2), | p2 - p21 = 2i, 17^ + p2 \=2j 
and n — ] J9] |, n — \p21 are even positive integers. Hence
. A1 = S r^r2~n~yAn(pi, p2) AT’1 (a;i

where logX^ 1(0)] + Mi), logX2=i((w2-|-Jf2), log-z^iAG, logz2=tJf2, loga?1 = tw1, 
log x2 = iw2. But this form can clearly be expressed in terms of Hansen’s 
coefficients. Thus
n,P!,p2 qltqa
where qlt g2 have all integral values, positive and negative, and the symbols X 
are respectively functions of elf e2, while An (p1} p2) is a function of p = sin2|Jr 
which has been determined.
The indirect part of the disturbing function, when rt (< r2) refers to the 
disturbed body, is clearly allowed for by simply excluding the terms cor­
responding to n = 1, for these are equal to ^r^cos H.

159-161] 
The Disturbing Function 
175
By either method the fundamental importance of Hansen’s coefficients 
and their relation to Newcomb’s symbolic operators is clearly seen. Numerical 
developments of their coefficients according to powers of e have been calculated 
by several authors, including Cayley, Newcomb and, for the purposes of the 
lunar theory, Delaunay.
161. 
It has been seen that the generating expansion is of the form
R = S 2.4 pLpvq cos px cos qy
= £ ApXv^cos [(p +q}L — (p — q) //]
where L = to + M, L' = w + MThe subsequent process introduces e, e into 
the coefficient A, which already contains powers of r = sin2^J, and adds 
multiples of M, M' to the argument. In the ordinary notation for the 
elements,
CO = EF — fl — X? &)' = Er' — fl' — ^'
where x> x are the distances of the intersection of the orbits from their 
ecliptic nodes. Hence R takes the form
R = 2 ApJ>vq cos \hM + KM' + (p + q) (ef - fl)
-(p-q)(^'~ H/)-7>(x-x/)-9(x+ /)]•
Now the two orbits with the ecliptic form a spherical triangle ABC in which
« = X, b =X’ c = fl2 — fl,
A = i, B = 7r — ir, C = J
where i, i' are the inclinations of the orbits to the ecliptic. Hence, as in § 67, 
if the intersection be taken as the ascending node of the disturbing orbit on 
the disturbed orbit,
sin | (x + x) sin | J = sin | (fl' — fl) sin | (i' + i)
cos | (x + x ) s,n IJ — cos 2 
— H) sin i — i)
sin |(x — x) cos i J = sin I <D' ~ H)cosI + 0

and therefore

cos 
exp.—(fl'—fl)
p£ exp. (x — x )=cos 
cos I1 exp. i4 (fl' —fl)+sin

It follows that
r® cos q (x + x) = 
cos 5 ~ ^)> v9 sin 9 (X + X ) = 
sin s (fl' — fl)
piP cosp (x - x) = S as cos s (fl' — fl), pA> sinp (x - x') = 
««sin s (fl' - fl)
where as, bs represent simple coefficients involving i, i'. Thus x ± X can 5e 
eliminated from R, which now takes the form
R = S A cos \hM + KM'+(p + q) (ef - fl) - (p - q} - fl') - (s + s') (fl' - fl)] 

176 
The Disturbing Function 
[ch. xiv
where A now contains a, a, e, e', i, i' and also powers of v. But from the 
above analogies of Delambre,
v = sin21 (flz — fl) sin21 (i' + i) + cos21 (flz — fl) sin21 (i' — i) 
= |(1 — cos i cos i'l — | sin i sin i' cos (fl
*
 — fl).
Hence these powers of v can be removed from the coefficient without altering 
the form of the arguments, which are only changed by the addition of some 
multiples of fl' — fl. Thus finally
R = 2 A cos [hM + h'M' + gtz + g^' + f£l +
= S A cos \h (nt + e) + h' (n't + e') + gv^ + g-n + f£l + /ZD']
where the coefficient A is now a function of a, a!, e, e', i, i' only, and the 
argument contains the six elements fl, fl', sr, wz, e, e and the time. And 
this is the final form of the disturbing function, involving the twelve 
elements of the two orbits explicitly, and expressed in the desired way.

CHAPTER XV
ABSOLUTE PERTURBATIONS
162. 
The disturbance of a purely elliptic motion may be illustrated in 
a quite elementary way by supposing the motion to take place in a resisting 
medium. Let the tangential resistance per unit mass be where v is the 
velocity and r the radius vector, so that the radial and tangential components 
are
av 1 dr _ a dr 
av r dd _ a dd
r2'v dt 
r2 dt ’ 
r^'vdt 
r di *
When other powers of v and r are assumed in the expression for the resistance 
the general results are very much the same, and this simple form is sufficiently 
typical to represent fairly an interesting problem.
Let u be the reciprocal of r and 3 W the work done by external forces in 
a small radial or transversal displacement. Then
— u‘ dW 9 du dW de 
a!i=-^ + a(g,
where p is the constant of attraction; and the kinetic energy is T, where 
2T= + r2#2 = w*

where e and 7 are constants.
163. 
The osculating ellipse at the point 0 = 0j is obtained by supposing 
the resisting medium to disappear at this point and the subsequent motion 
under the central attraction to be undisturbed. The path is then
u = Pi-111 + eicos _ 7i)}-
The motion at the instant is the same in the actual trajectory (1) and in this 
ellipse, and thus 0 = 0lf u = u^, u and 0, and therefore H = Hl and duidd are 
the same for both curves. Let =p~\ Now IIis the constant of areal 
velocity in the ellipse, and hence
pr1 = pHr2 =p~
*
 (1 - aA-10j)-2.
To the first order in a then
pr1 &Pi = — 2aA-10i.
Again, by equating the values of u and dujd0,
pr1 {1 + Cj cos (0i — 7i)} =•• p-1 [1 + e cos (0i — 7) + 2aA-10j}
Pi-1 { — 6i sin (0j — 7j)} =p~1 { — e sin (0j — 7) + 2aA-1} 
and to the first order in a
6i cos (0i — 71) = e cos (0i — 7) — 2aA-1e0i cos (0i — 7)
6i sin (0i — 7J = e sin (0j — 7) — 2aA-1 — 2ah~1e0i sin (0j — 7).
Hence
6i cos (71 — 7) = e — 2aA~1e01 — 2aA-1 sin (0j — 7)
6i sin (7J — 7) = 2ah~1 e cos (0j — 7) 
and, still to the first order,
Aei = - 2aA-1 {e0j + sin (0j — 7)}
A71 = 2ah~1 cos (0j — 7).
Between these terms an important practical distinction is at once apparent. 
That in Agj depending on 0j will diminish the eccentricity indefinitely until 
the orbit becomes circular. It is a secular term. The other terms are 

162-164] 
Absolute Perturbations 
179
periodic, and when a is small their effect, not being cumulative, is small also. 
In practical applications, to Encke’s comet for example, they can be neglected. 
Then k-h = 0 and the direction of the apsidal line is unaffected by the resist­
ing medium.
In a complete revolution the secular effects are given by
Acj _ Apx _ 4?ra 
Ci pi 
h
and the corresponding changes in the mean motion and the mean distance are 
given by
An1_ 3 Acq _ 3 Ap, 3eiAei _ 1 + 0/ 6?ra
Tii — 2 tZi ~ 2 pi l—Ci’ 1 — ef ‘ h
since cti =pi (1 — 0/)-1. Thus the most important effects of a resisting medium 
are a steady increase in the mean motion and a steady decrease in the mean 
distance, which must ultimately bring the disturbed body into contact with 
the centre of attraction.
164. 
This simple example has been chosen, apart from its intrinsic 
interest, because it illustrates certain important points. There is, in the first 
place, the osculating or instantaneous ellipse, which is
. pjU = 1 + 0i cos (0 — Yi) 
and not
pu = 1 + e cos (0 — 7).
The latter is a definite curve which may be called an intermediate orbit and 
may serve usefully as a curve of reference. Indeed it has been so used in 
what precedes. But it is not the osculating orbit at any time. There is also 
the distinction drawn between periodic and secular disturbances in the motion, 
of which the former may be relatively unimportant compared with the latter 
because these, however slow, are cumulative in effect.
The general nature of disturbed planetary motion can now be considered. 
For two planets only, the disturbing function has the form, found in the last 
chapter,
R = XF(a, a, e, e', i, i')cos T,
T= [/<, (nt + e) + h' (n't + e') + g^ + g'^' + ffl + /TV] 
where (a, n, e, i, fl, cr, e) are the elements of the disturbed orbit, (a, n', e', i, 
fl', vr', e') the elements of the disturbing orbit. The equations of § 139 are 
now available for finding the variations of the elements. In accordance with 
the artifice explained in § 140 the mean longitude e is taken in a special 
sense there defined, and a in the coefficient and n in the argument of any term 
are treated as independent in forming the partial differential coefficients of R. 
Therefore ’

are all of the form SC cos T, and
dR dR dR
d£l ’ 3-nr ’ ot
are all of the form SC sin?7, where ^is the argument of the term. Hence 
the equations for the variations are themselves of the form
-^-= SC2cos T7,....
» v
In the first approximation the right-hand members (which contain the dis­
turbing mass as a factor) are calculated with the osculating elements of both 
orbits for a certain epoch, and these elements are treated as constant. The 
equations can then be integrated, and in fact
^a = — S C7, cos Tf{hn 4- h'n),...
= SC2sin Tfihn4-h'n),....
These are the absolute perturbations of the first order. Similarly the pertur­
bations of the first order in the masses can be calculated for all the disturbing 
planets concerned and the results can be combined by addition.
165. Each term in the perturbations represents a distinct inequality in 
the motion of the disturbed planet. It will now be seen that the inequalities 
are of two kinds. The multipliers h, h' have all integral values, positive and 
negative, including 0. When h = h' = 0 the disturbing function R is reduced 
to that part which does not contain the time. Thus
da 
dll
~dt= 1””’ dt 2”'
‘ Sia = C&..., 8Al = C2t,... :
and the inequalities are secular. From the present limited point of view they 
will increase indefinitely and in the course of time will modify the condition^ 
of the planetary system profoundly, uncompensated by any check.
• But one remark can be made immediately. The most important element 
as regards the stability of the system is clearly the mean distance a. Now 
when h = h' = 0, not only does t disappear from R but also e. Hence
and in the previous set of equations C\ = 0. There is therefore no secular 
•inequality in a of the first order in the masses. How far this important 
theorem can be extended to the higher orders must be seen later. It follows 
that the mean motion n is also free from any secular inequality of the first 
order.

164-166] 
Absolute Perturbations 
181
The other inequalities, when h and h' are not both zero, are evidently 
purely periodic, unless hn + h'n' = 0. The meaning of this qualification is that 
the mean motions must not be commensurable. Now mean motions are never 
commensurable, except perhaps instantaneously, since in fact they are not 
constant. But there are, as it were, degrees of incommensurability. In any 
case integers can be found to make hn 4- h'n smaller than any assignable 
quantity. If the incommensurability of n, n is high, the corresponding 
integers h, h' will be large. In general the coefficients in R which correspond 
to arguments of a high order diminish rapidly with the order. Then the 
occurrence of a small divisor hn 4- h'n on integration will have no very serious 
effect. But if the incommensurability of the mean motions is low, this 
divisor may become very small for quite moderate values of h, h', and a fairly 
small term in the disturbing function may be greatly magnified by integration.
Thus in the case of Jupiter and Saturn
5n — 2n — n/30 = n'/74
nearly, and this fact causes a considerable inequality in the motion of both 
planets, with a period of nearly 900 years. The period of such an inequality 
is 2ir/(hn 4- h'n') and therefore inequalities of the class just considered are 
always connected with long periods. They hold an intermediate place between 
ordinary periodic inequalities and secular inequalities.
The mean longitude is affected in a double degree. For (§ 140) this is
€ 4" I ndt = € 4- p 
where
^ = --a ^ = SCsinT 
dt2 a2 de
and therefore
Sjp = — X C sin T[(hn 4- h'n')2.
The long-period inequalities in the other elements have the divisor hn 4- h'n 
in the first degree only. Hence the principal effect is to be observed in the 
mean longitude.
166. It is in the next place necessary to consider the perturbations of 
the second order in the masses, for the first approximation does not in general 
suffice, and in the theories of Jupiter and Saturn it is even necessary to go 
beyond the third order. It is convenient to write

explained, S2 those of the second order, and so on. The equations for the

The reduction of the right-hand side to a suitable form will be readily 
understood in general terms, apart from the complexities which will naturally 
arise in the practical calculation, and a simple integration, requiring the 
introduction of no arbitrary constant, will give the expression of Similarly 
the perturbations of higher orders, so far as they are of sensible magnitude, 
can be found successively, when those of the lower orders have been deter­
mined, for all the elements.
167. The general form of the results will now be apparent. In the 
first order the inequalities are of the forms
A cos (vt + h), At
only. In the higher orders the terms obtained by the algebraic composition 
and subsequent integration of these two forms will clearly belong to one of 
the three types
A cos (vt + h), A tm, A tm cos (vt + h)
which may be called respectively periodic, purely secular and mixed terms. 
The term order may be retained to denote the degree a of J. in the masses. 
As A is also a function of the eccentricities and inclinations, which are also 
in general small parameters, it may be limited to a homogeneous function in 
these parameters. Then the degree of the term is the degree of this function 
and represents its order in respect to the eccentricities and inclinations.
A further classification is used by Poincare. The order of a term being a, 
the rank of a term is represented by a - m, or by the order less the exponent 
of t. A term of high order is initially small, but if m is large it will grow 
rapidly in importance, so that ultimately the terms of the lowest rank will 
have the greatest significance.
The occurrence of long-period terms with small divisors has been noticed. 
In the higher orders these divisors will be combined and raised to higher 
powers by the subsequent integrations. Let m' be the sum of the exponents 
of such divisors in any term. Then the class of that term is defined by the 
number a — 
+ m'). It will now be clear that the value of these different
categories depends on the length of time contemplated. For relatively short

intervals the most important terms are those of low order. In longer intervals 
the terms of low class rise into prominence. And finally it is the terms of low 
rank which have the greatest influence in the ultimate destiny of the system.
But here a question naturally arises. How far is the form in which the 
terms present themselves natural to the problem, and how far are they the 
artificial product of the particular method by which they are obtained ? It is 
evident that the physical importance of this question is not quite the same 
in all cases. Thus a mean motion in the position of the node or perihelion 
may be admitted without any serious direct consequences to the nature of the 
system. On the other hand, a purely secular term in the mean distance or 
the eccentricity, taken by itself without compensating circumstances, must 
ultimately prove fatal to the stability. The general problem suggested is 
very difficult and the reader is referred to the first volume of Poincare’s 
Lemons de Mecaniqve Celeste for a thorough discussion.
It must, however, be pointed out that the form of the results may be 
perfectly legitimate, so far as it goes, and at the same time not in any way 
inconsistent with the stability of the system, though a decision is beyond the 
range of the above elementary methods. It is impossible to be satisfied with 
the solution here described as a final representation, and this feeling is ob­
viously suggested by considering the mixed terms. Since the corresponding 
oscillations increase in amplitude indefinitely with the time the departure 
from the original configuration will become so great that the fundamental 
assumption of small displacements in forming the equations for the variations 
will be contravened. Then one of two things will happen. Either the mutual 
forces will tend to restore the original configuration, and there will be stability, 
or the forces will tend to magnify the disturbance, and there will be instability. 
But in either case equally the method adopted breaks down and the funda­
mental question remains unanswered.
How then are the statements to be reconciled, that the method—which 
is the method on which the existing theories of the major planets are actually 
based—may be perfectly, legitimate, and that, while the form of the terms to 
which it leads obviously suggests instability, complete stability is never­
theless entirely possible ? The simple answer is that it is only necessary to 
imagine that v in the argument of any term is itself a function of the 
disturbing masses. Now the above method involves a development in powers 
of the masses, and when the parameters which represent the masses are thus 
forced out of the circular functions they carry the time t explicitly with them, 
and the appearance of secular and mixed terms is a natural consequence. 
Yet the development in terms of the masses may be convergent and entirely 
legitimate. In this way it will be seen that the occurrence of secular and 
mixed terms is compatible with stability, though a profound discussion is 
necessary for a positive conclusion on this point.

[ch. xv
The case of a planet moving in a resisting medium is quite different. 
There is then a definite loss of energy and the effect of the secular changes is 
not doubtful.
168. In the theories of the planets on which the existing tables have 
been based the coordinates of the planets relative to the Sun have been used 
and this fact governs the form of the disturbing function, which is distinct 
for each pair of planets. For practical purposes this choice of coordinates is 
an obvious one. But for theoretical purposes it is unsuitable, chiefly because, 
like the common system of elliptic elements, it is ill adapted to the transfor­
mations which are an essential feature of the dynamical methods initiated by 
Hamilton. Another system of coordinates, due to Jacobi, will therefore now 
be introduced.
Let (fi, Tji, ft) be the coordinates of the mass mt in a system of n masses 
...,mn, the origin being any fixed point. The masses are taken in 
any fixed order, represented by the suffixes, which is quite independent of 
any arrangement which may be visible in the system. Let
771]+ 7772+ ...+77^ = ^, Wlf = 
, fi0 = 0.
Let (Xif Yit Zi) be the coordinates of the point Git which is the centre of mass 
of the partial system m2,..., mi, so that
PiXi = pi^1 + (p2-p1)^2 +
(pi - fii^) & = ptXi-pi_iAt_lt & = Xi.
Let (xif yi, zi) be the coordinates of mi relative to Gi-i, so that
= & - X^, (pi - p^) Xi = pi (Xi - Xi-i).
Thus (x2, y2, z2) are the coordinates of m2 relative to mlt or (£>—fi, fy-Vi, &-&)', 
(x3, y3, z3) are the coordinates of m3 relative to G2, the centre of mass of mltm2; 
and so on. There are no coordinates (a^, y1} zi). By the above
(Ui - /^-i)2 
= (PiXi - p^ A,-])2
(Pi - pi-if x? = p2 (Xi - Xi-if.
Hence on eliminating the product term AfA^
(pi - p^) (tf - pi^xUpi) = piXi2 - p^Xi^2
and on addition of all the equations of this type
X (pi - pi_i) (tf - pi^xi/pi) = pnXn2

The relations between the coordinates have been written down for one 
only. But they are linear and the same for all three coordinates separately.

Therefore they also apply to the velocities. Hence if T is the kinetic energy 
of the system,
1=1

(x? + y? + if2) + /xn (Xn2 + yn2 + Z2).
i=2
But (Xn, Yn, Zn) are the coordinates of the centre of mass of the system. 
They are absent from the potential function and are in fact ignorable coordi­
nates. The known integrals for the centre of mass follow immediately and 
these coordinates can be suppressed. The problem of n bodies is thus reduced 
to a problem of n — 1 fictitious bodies and the total order of the differential 
equations of motion is reduced by 6.
169. 
The new form of the areal integrals is easily found. For
(fH - pi-tf (yt ti - & in) = 
Yt_A (mZi - 
Z^)
- (P'iZi - jii-iZ^) (fifYi - fii^Yi-i)
(pi - /tf-O2 (y^ - Ziyt) = pi2 (Yi- Y^) (Zi - Z^) - 
(Z{ - Zi^)(Yi - Y^)
and hence
(in - fii-i) {GfrSi - ^Tji) - 
{yiZi - Ziyi)}
= k ( Y^ - Zi Yi) - 
( Y^Z^ - Z^ Yi-J.
The sum of all equations of this type gives
S mi {(yiii - Ki'hi) - /£-> w
*
 {yi^i - Ziyi)} -,Fn{Ynzn-zn Yn).
But it is possible to write Xn = Yn = Zn = 0; that is equivalent to taking the 
centre of mass of the system as the origin of the coordinates (&•, 
£■). Thus
the areal integrals now take the form

where (cn c2, c3) are the angular momenta of the system about fixed axes 
through the centre of mass. The direction of the axes has remained the 
same throughout.
Let (ci, c2, c3) be considered as the components of a constant vector C, 
mi A^-i P'Y1 (^f> yi, Zi) as the components of a vector Jf,-, and (xif yit z{) as the 

186

[ch. xv
components of a vector rj. Then in quaternion notation the above three 
integrals may be represented by the single equation
X V(riMi) = a 
i=2
Hence in the problem of three bodies
V(r2M2)+V(rsMs)=C.
These three vectors are therefore coplanar. But V (r2M2) is normal to the 
plane of r2, M2, that is, to the instantaneous orbit of the fictitious planet 2. 
Similarly V (r3Ms) is normal to the instantaneous orbit of the fictitious planet 3, 
and clearly C is normal to the invariable plane. Hence the nodes of the instan­
taneous orbits of the two fictitious planets on the invariable plane coincide.
This important property explains the so-called elimination of the nodes, 
which in an explicit form is due to Jacobi. In the more common system of 
astronomical coordinates it disappears from view. The reader who is un­
acquainted with the elements of quaternions will have no difficulty in finding 
an alternative form of proof, as in § 22.
170. The body denoted by 1 will now be identified with the Sun, and 
i or j will have the values 2, ...,n. The potential energy of the system, when 
the units are chosen so that the constant of gravitation is unity, is

which expresses the relative coordinates —£n... in terms of the coordinates 
xitand shows that the latter differ from the former only by quantities of 
the first order in the small masses. In particular, for the body 2, which may 
be identified with any one of the planets, there is no difference.
Let U be reduced to its terms of the lowest order in the small masses, 
which is the first. Then
U\ = — Wj S mifri, r? = xf + yi + z?
for ri differs from by a quantity which involves the masses. The equations 
of motion reduce to
at dxi at oxi
or in more explicit form
Pi-iPC1 Xi = - mlxi[ri, (x, y, z).
These are the equations of undisturbed elliptic motion, and in particular 
x2 = - 
+ m2) a?2/r2s, (x, y, z)
which agree naturally with the usual equations of a planet relative to the 
Sun in undisturbed motion, and give a mean distance a2 with the usual 
meaning. For the other bodies the equations are of the same form and have 
precisely similar solutions, but the elements a,- will differ from the ordinary 
elements slightly because (xit yit zi) are not coordinates relative to the Sun 
* unless i = 2. This is not material to the purpose in view because the body 2 
represents any planet and any proposition which is proved for it must be true 
generally.
171. These equations for the undisturbed motion can now be solved in 
terms of canonical constants. When the latter are treated as variables, they 
satisfy canonical equations formed with R = U1 — U. As in § 143 this value 
of R may be modified by adding 'ZmytftL'2, where m — rriiy^lyt and 
y = 
in view of the explicit form of the undisturbed equations. Then
any of the different sets of variables explained in that section can be used, 
and the last set, now denoted by (L\ 
%2'; X, yi, y2'), will be chosen. The
equations for the perturbations can now be written

There are n— 1 pairs of equations in (Z/, X<) and 2(n — 1) pairs in (£/, ry), 
but there is no need here to distinguish between the eccentric and oblique 

188

[ch. xv
variables. From this point the former use of (&, tji, £{) as the rectangular 
coordinates of mi disappears.
A little explanation may be necessary to account for the appearance of 
the mass factors of the momenta sei in the equations. In § 135 giving the 
Hamilton-Jacobi solution for undisturbed elliptic motion the single factor w, 
representing the mass of the moving body, was removed consistently from U, 
T and H. Similarly in § 139 U—R was written in the place of U, R being 
the disturbing function in its common form, whereas the true increment in 
the potential energy is — mR. But here it is not possible to divide the more 
general function U — tTj as a whole by any particular mass, though it is 
possible to do so as regards the set of equations corresponding to a particular 
value of i. Hence it was necessary to restore the mass factors in the manner 
shown. But now they can be removed by the change of variables,

so that Xi = 7iit + h and ??t- is the ipean motion in the preliminary solution. 
The first-order perturbations of X; will require the first-order perturbation of 
Li to be included in the term from which nt- originates.
172. It is not at present very necessary to consider in detail the form of 
expansion of U —U\. It can in the first place be expanded in powers and 
products of the small masses and of the coordinates (a\-, yi, zR). The latter 
can be expanded in powers of Li, £i, yi with purely periodic functions of X£. 
Hence U —U^ can be expanded in the same form, and arranged in orders of 
the masses, beginning with the second since the first has been removed by Z7r 
Thus if the fourth order in V be neglected, V = V2 4-F3, where V2 is of the 
second order and Vs of the third, and V2 contains at most two, Fs at most 
three, mean longitudes X; in its arguments, the coefficients of the periodic 
terms being rational and integral functions of L{,

171, 172]

189
The perturbations of the first order can now be obtained in the usual way 
by neglecting lza and substituting initial values of Lit £i, i)i in K2, including 
nit 4- Xj® for X<. This process gives
+ 
Xi = M + Xi® + S1Xf«, ^i = ^ + ^, ^=%® + W
where L?,... are constants and SjA®,... are the perturbations of the first order. 
Owing to the form of V2, dV2/dX{ is purely periodic and free from any term 
independent of Xf. Hence biLf is also periodic and free from a secular term. 
But the other elements will contain a term multiplied by t, arising from the 
terms independent of Xf in the partial derivatives of V2, together with 
periodic terms. To the second order let
Li = L^ + L^ + ^L?.
In Vs, which must now be - retained, it suffices to substitute the constant 
values Li0,... for Li,..., and M + X<® for Xf; but in V2 it is necessaiy to 
substitute Lf + ^Lf,... for Li,..., though only the first powers of these 
perturbations are required. Hence the equation
1 (Z(« + 8, Lf + 8, L(") = 
(V2 + K,)

By the same argument as applied to V2 in the first approximation the last 
term gives rise to periodic terms only: Hence a search for secular terms can 
be confined in the first place to the expression
j [dXidLj0 J oXj dXidXjJoLf cXidt-j0 J oi)f dX^fj J
Here the multipliers of the integrals are all purely periodic, owing to 
differentiation with respect to Xf. The integrals themselves contain secular 
terms in t. Hence on integration the products will give rise to periodic and 
mixed terms, but not to purely secular terms on this account. The latter must 
arise, if at all, from a constant term in the products. The only way in which 
this could happen would be connected with terms in the development of V2 of 
the form
V2 = B sin (kiXi + kjX^ + Ccos (fcfXf + kjXj) = B sin t/t 4- C cos yfr.

In a similar way those terms which might produce constant terms neutralize 
one another between the other pairs of products and therefore no purely 
secular part of can arise in this way.
But the above expression is not complete, because depends on 
a« well as on V2. For, by the last equation of § 171,

so that there is an additional part of S2L? not yet considered. It is given by

Therefore this part of 82Li° is purely periodic.
Hence there are no purely secular terms in 82Li°, a proposition which 
Poincard has proved in the more general form: there are no purely secular 
perturbations of in any order of rank lower than 2.
This applies in particular to L2. But az = ML?, where JI is a constant 
mass factor. Hence
°2 + 
+ ^2^2 = JI (1'2 + ^1-^2 + ^2^2)2
^i®2 2ML2^L2, 82u2 = M + 2Z2 (So-I'i)}
the affix 0 being now omitted. But ^L2 is purely periodic, and %ZL2 has no 
purely secular term. Hence to the second order in the masses there is no 
secular inequality in the mean distance, for it has been remarked that a~> 
represents the mean distance of any of the planets. This is Poisson’s theorem, 
an extension of Laplace’s corresponding theorem for the first order, and it is 
the most important elementary result bearing on the stability of the solar 
system.
173. On the other hand there are evidently mixed terms of order 2 and 
rank 1 in Li. Hence the existence of purely secular terms of order 3 and 
rank 2 in a.2 can be anticipated. For even without pushing the approximation 
further and examining 83L2 it is obvious that 2M8AL2.82Z2 constitutes a part 
of 83a2. Therefore the combination of a term A cos mt in SjZ2 with a term 
Bt cos ml in &2LZ will give a term MA Bt in 83a2. Such terms were first shown 
to exist by Spiru-Haretu in 1876.

172, 173]

On one condition true secular inequalities of the first order occur in the 
mean distances. Since
U — U\ = S A cos (kiXi + kjkj + h) 
to its lowest order,
3 F/0Xf = S Aki sin (ktXi + kjXj + h).
For perturbations of the first order the coefficients are constants and X; - n^t, 
— rijt are also constant. Hence
dLijdt = "S, Aki sin {mt + h').
A constant term results, producing a secular inequality, if m = kini + kjTij = 0, 
which is possible only if nit rij are commensurable. This possibility was 
considered in the previous form of discussion and excluded. But it is in effect 
ruled out by its own consequences. For if a body were artificially or fortui­
tously projected in such a way as to have a mean motion commensurable 
(e.g. |, 3,...) with the mean motion of a disturbing body, its mean distance 
would be subject to a secular disturbance from the beginning, and therefore 
the commensurability of its motion would be definitely destroyed. Hence if 
the minor planets be arranged in order of distance from the Sun, it is to be 
expected that gaps will be found in the frequency at distances corresponding 
to mean motions commensurable with that of Jupiter, and it is so. And 
similarly divisions in the rings of Saturn can be attributed to the secular 
perturbations of the constituent meteoric bodies, produced by the commen­
surable motions of any satellite which may be effective. This also has been 
verified for the action of Mimas by Lowell and Slipher.
Nevertheless among the many minor planets a few are naturally found 
whose motions are nearly commensurable with Jupiter’s mean motion. For 
these the long-period terms with small divisors are highly important, and the 
terms of low class play a far larger part than in the theories of the major 
planets. The special difficulties thus presented require special methods of 
treatment, and such have been suggested by Hansen, Gylden and others. 
Poincar6 has used an application of the principle of Delaunay’s method. The 
proper treatment of this class of minor planets presents perhaps the most 
interesting problems to be found in dynamical Astronomy at the present 
time.

CHAPTER XVI
SECULAR PERTURBATIONS
174. In the preceding chapter it has been shown that the mean distances 
in the planetary system are free from purely secular inequalities when 
developed to the second order in the masses. The general nature of the 
secular perturbations in the other elements will now be examined. It may 
be convenient to modify slightly the equations obtained in §§ 170, 171. By 
reducing U to its terms of the lowest order the equations of motion there 
took the explicit form
(x, y, z)
which are satisfied by the osculating motion of a planet, according to its 
ordinary definition, when i = 2, but not otherwise. But if Uf be substituted 
for Uy, where
U' = - S (mJ + mi) 
mri
r
a form which will be found to differ from Uj by terms of the third order 
only, the explicit equations of motion become
Xi = — (?nx + mt) Xifr^ (x, y, z)
which are the ordinary equations in the undisturbed problem of two bodies, 
and are satisfied by the osculating elements taken in their usual sense. The 
mass factors of the momenta are as before miPi-^pt, but the constants of 
attraction are p = mx + m^ Hence the equations for the variations will now 
be based on
V' = — U+ Ui + 2 (z/ij + mi)2 mipi-^piLi2
= — U + Ui + S (mi + mt)2 p3i_A!'2.p^Li2.
The relation between Zf and Z/ is the same as before, but the meaning of 
both is changed (except when i = 2) in such a way that Lt bears generally 
the same form of relation to ait the osculating mean distance in its ordinary 
sense, as L2 to a2.

yi — bi, Zi — Ci where (ai} bi} ci) are what (xit yit zt) become when £f = iji = 0. 
Now (§ 65) the heliocentric coordinates are generally
x = r cos £1 cos (w + tb — £1) — r cos i sin £1 sin (w + w — £1)
= r cos2 cos (w + «•) + r sin2 cos (w + — 2£1)
y = r sin £1 cos (w 4- w — £1) + r cos i cos £1 sin (w + w — £1)
= r cos2 sin (w 4- -gt) — r sin2 sin (w 4- w — 2£1)
z = r sin i sin (w 4- -gt — £1)
w being the true anomaly. Let
X = r cos (w — M), Y — v sin (w — M), M = X — -gt
M being the mean anomaly. Then
x = X [cos2|i cos X + sin2 cos (X — 2£1)}
— Y {cos2|i sin X 4- sin2 sin (X - 2£1)}
y = X [cos2 sin X — sin2 |i sin (X — 2£1)}
4- Y [cos2 cos X — sin2 cos (X — 2£1)}
z = X sin i sin (X — £1) + Y sin i cos (X — £1).
The coefficients of X and Y here involve, besides periodic functions of X, the 
quantities

of e sin M, e cos M if this is true of sin (E — M), cos (E — M). But Kepler’s 
equation may be written

0 — x cos 0 — y cos 0 = 0, 0 = E — M, x = e sin J/, y = e cos M
and 0 can be expanded in powers of x, y. Hence sin (E — M), cos (E — M) 
can be expanded in powers of e sin M, e cos and therefore also X and Y. 
But this shows that X, Y can be expanded in powers of e sin ct, e cos ct with 
coefficients involving periodic functions of X, since M = X — ct. And e sin ct, 
e cos ct can be expanded in powers of 
as can easily be seen, with
coefficients involving L. Hence (x, y, z) can be developed in powers of 
£i, 
^2 with coefficients involving L and periodic functions of X. There­
fore finally U — 17/ can be expanded in powers of £lfl, 97^, ^ij2, yit2 with 
coefficients involving Li and periodic functions of X<, and the supplementary 
part of V involves Li only.
It is assumed that the inclinations of the orbits are very small. Now 
there are two ways of regarding retrograde motion in an orbit whose plane 
differs little from the orbits of planets moving in the opposite sense. It is 
possible to take the mean motion nt as positive. Then the inclination is 
near ir and is not small. Or it is possible to take the inclination as small, 
and to regard 7?$ as negative. Then since Lf is a positive mass function, 
Li is negative and therefore th are imaginary. All the orbitswill therefore 
be supposed to be described in the same (direct) sense, which is true of the 
planetary system but not always of the satellite systems.
This remark has an obvious bearing on theories of cosmogony. For if 
high inclinations and in particular retrograde motions were unstable, such 
forms of motion would not be permanently maintained. Now the nebular 
hypothesis of Laplace is very largely based on the observed fact that the 
planetary motions are nearly coplanar. If, however, such a type of motion. 
is alone stable, the observed fact loses its significance in this connexion and 
no deduction of the kind is to be drawn from it. The question of stability 
in general, beyond the range of inclinations to be found in the actual planetary 
system, is therefore important, though beyond the range of this work.

are all possible without affecting the result. Thus (a) follows when fl,, 
are altered by tf, or when the axes of xy are rotated through tf in their own 
plane. Similarly (6) follows when this rotation is made through |tf. Again 
(c) is produced when fl,- (but not tBi) is altered by it, and this is equivalent 
to reversing the axis of z. Finally (d) is obtained by changing the signs of 
all the angles Xf, fl,-, «r£, which is equivalent to reversing the axis of y. The 
change in X£ is of no further importance here since X£ is absent from the 
terms now considered.
Certain properties of the exponents in the expansion are now obvious. 
For X (pj + qy +p2+ q^) must be an even number to satisfy (a), and X (P2+92) 
to satisfy (c). Hence ^.(p^qj is also an even number. Similarly (d) 
requires X (q^ + q2) to be even, and therefore X ( px +p2) must be even. Hence 
in the second degree there can be no terms of the form £y or y^. 
But if terms of the fourth degree be neglected, only terms of the second 
degree involving f, y remain. These terms can therefore be written down in 
the form
[- U + tZ/] = X £> j (J- t , + yit j yjt J + (f£> 2 & 2 + yit 2 yjt 2)

the lowest order in the masses. The principal part of the disturbing function 
is SwifTHjA”] and it has been seen in § 159 that the complementary part 
contains periodic terms only. The distances A£j involve coordinates (xit yt, Zi) 
which themselves contain the masses. But to the lowest order these coordi­
nates are identical with the relative coordinates commonly in use, and the 
methods of Chap. XIV can therefore be employed. Two planets, 1, 2, will be 
first considered. Then in the notation of § 152, when the orbits are circular,

Since v is of the second order the Laplace’s coefficient is derived imme­

eccentricities, the orbits being now treated as coplanar. Let

All operating terms which do not combine Mlf M2 in the form My — M2 will 
clearly produce periodic terms only. And terms already of the second degree

To simplify this expression the recurrence formulae (4) and (5) of § 148 with

‘n 179. The problem of the small eccentricities and inclinations of the 
planetary system is now brought within the range of the general theory of 
small oscillations about a steady state of motion. Indeed a knowledge of the 
principles of this theory shows at once that the variations in the eccentricities 
and inclinations are periodic and stable, for this follows from the definite 
(positive or negative) forms of the quadratic terms.

This is a symmetrical determinant of familiar type, and it is well known that 
all its roots are real. For the system of the eight major planets it is of the 
eighth order. It is most unlikely that the equation would have exactly equal 
roots in a case like this, nor does it in fact happen. But it is to be observed 
that the occurrence of repeated roots would alter in no way the essential 
circumstances. The main point is that the definite quadratic form can always 
be reduced to the form 'Za.ipi by a linear transformation to normal coordinates. 
The effect of repeated roots can be seen when there are three planets. Then 
Sa^i2 corresponds to an ellipsoid, which is one of revolution when two roots 
at are equal. An arbitrary element enters into the direction cosines of the 
principal axes, which are the coefficients of the transformation. But this does 
not affect the form of the result or the stability of the motion. It is not 
necessary to examine the algebra of the subject further, but so much should 
be mentioned because from the time of Lagrange to Weierstrass in 1858 it 
was supposed that the occurrence of repeated roots would result in the 
appearance of the time outside the periodic functions and would be fatal to 
stability. It is not so.
180. It has been seen that the orthogonal transformation to normal 
coordinates is also canonical and that the principal function, as far as the • 
eccentric variables are concerned, takes the form
v= +
where a< is positive, since V is a positive definite form. The canonical 
equations therefore become
dqi
•3- = ^ ±—«<Pi 
and the solution is
pi = Ci cos (ad 4- hi), qt = — Ct sin (ad + ht)
where Ct, hi are arbitrary constants. This gives the quadratic integrals

These results are immediately expressed in terms of the previous variables

where aitj are definite constants. When the transformation is reversed,

The general solution may also be written, with the degree of approxima­
tion adopted,

CiL^ sin CTf = ^aitjCj sin (aft + hj)
which determine the eccentricities and the motions of the perihelia. The 
question then arises in every case: has the perihelion a mean motion ? In 
other words, is the motion of perihelion, to use the analogy of the simple 
pendulum, of the circulating or the oscillating type ?
The problem, stated in general terms, is not a simple one. But there is 
one simple case which will serve to explain what is meant and the necessary 
condition of which is satisfied more often than not. The preceding equations 
may be regarded as applying to certain coplanar vectors whose tensors are 
ciitjCj. From this point of view the one vector is represented as the 
sum of a set of vectors each rotating uniformly. Let the tensor of one vector 
of the set exceed in length the sum of the
*
 tensors of the rest, and let this 
vector terminate at the origin, the others forming a chain from the other 
end. It is then geometrically obvious that the representative point at the 
end of the chain must share in the circulation round the origin of the pre­
dominant vector. The perihelion in this case has a mean motion therefore, 
and it coincides with that, at, associated with the large coefficient. The 
sense of this mean motion is always direct, since a, is positive. In the same 
circumstances e*  cannot vanish, but has a lower positive limit.
The condition is clearly satisfied when there are only two planets, unless 
the two tensors are equal. In this exceptional case it is evident that the 
mean motion of a perihelion is the same as that of the resultant of the two 
vectors and is the arithmetic mean, j (of.2 + a3), between their angular motions.
The eight roots of the fundamental determinant range between the values 
0"
*616
 and 22"'46 (Stockwell). These are annual motions, so that the corre­
sponding periods lie between 58,000 and 2,100,000 years. Since they are of 
this order it is evident that Ci, can be developed in powers of the time and 
that the lowest terms of such expressions will suffice to represent the changes 
for several centuries. These are the secular inequalities as commonly under­
stood, and it will be seen that they exhibit the initial changes, apart from 
those of short period, rather than truly secular effects.

These results for the eccentricities and- perihelia apply almost 
without change equally to the inclinations and nodes. But there are two 
differences to be noted. In the first place the principal function is a negative 
definite form, which may be written after the transformation to normal 
coordinates,
where is positive. In the second place, one is zero, or, in other words, 
the discriminant or Hessian of V (a quadratic form) vanishes. For the part 
which involves the oblique variable may be written (§ 178)
and therefore
; Bi,i’ Lj Bi,j'
If then i is the characteristic of a row and j of a column in the Hessian, and 
each column is multiplied by the corresponding L^, the sum of each row will 
vanish. Hence the discriminant is identically zero and /3= 0 is a root of the 
fundamental equation.
The physical reason for this is easily seen. For the canonical equations 
become
Corresponding to the root /3; = 0,
Pi = %bitj = const., • q; = S&fj — const.
which are two linear integrals. The constants need not be zero, and the 
inclinations may be finite, while their variations vanish. This in fact is the 
case when the orbits are all coplanar and inclined to the plane of reference. 
This explains why the fundamental determinant has a zero root. The other 
seven negative roots when calculated for the solar system are quite similar in 
magnitude to the positive roots of the determinant in a.
The general solution of the equations when a finite root is in question is
Pi = Di cos (fat + kt), qi = Di sin (fat 4- fc<)

where are the definite constants of the transformation to normal coordi­
nates. Owing to the zero root in /3, t disappears from one term on the right­
hand side of each equation, leaving seven periodic terms and one constant, 
but the form is undisturbed by this fact.
These equations determine the inclinations and. the motions of the nodes. 
The plane of reference is fixed and arbitrary, except in so far as it lies near 
the average plane of the orbits. Considered as applying to a set of rotating 
coplanar vectors, the equations show immediately that if one coefficient on 
the right exceeds the sum of all the rest (taken positively), the node has a 
mean motion equal and opposite to that of the corresponding vector, and this 
mean motion is therefore retrograde. When this simple criterion is satisfied, 
as it is more often than not, it is also evident that the tensor of the vector 
cannot vanish and that ii has a lower limit.
182. 
The sum of the quadratic integrals gives
2 (pr + q?) = S (£/• + 1?»2) = const.
and this applies separately to the eccentric and to the oblique variables. It 
follows immediately from the canonical equations of § 179 without any trans­
formation. Now rji contain the factor Li} which is 
pi-ipf-'afi
or to the lowest order in the masses niim^a^. Hence
= const.
= const.
or, as the latter is more usually written,
tan2 ii = const.
for the degree of approximation adopted allows of no discrimination between 
these forms. The constants being small initially it follows that the orbit 
of no considerable mass in the system can acquire an indefinitely large 
eccentricity or inclination at the expense of the others as a result of mutual 
perturbations. These propositions, due to Laplace, clearly have an importance 
analogous to that of Poisson on the invariability of the mean distances.
The areal velocity in any orbit is
= («i + cos <£>t- = G"-.
The mass factors being 
as in § 170, the components of angular
momentum are
(sin it sin fl„ — sin cos fl;-, cos «»■)
= Li cos fa (sin ii sin fl,, — sin i{ cos flf > cos it)
when the direction cosines of the normal to the orbit are introduced. These 
components may be written (§ 174)

Li COS <£>, COS if

or since
(1 - cos <ft), £\>2 + ifij2 = 2Li cos 0; (1 - cos tt)
they can also be expressed in terms of these quantities. The areal integrals 
then become

[A - 4 (Pm +

s {Li - I (^i,! + y2itl) - j (£2i>2 + Vft>2)} = const.
If the plane 01 reference is the invariable plane the first two of these con­
stants are zero. In that case, when there are only two planets, ??2/£2 is the 
same for both and the nodes coincide, which is the property already noticed 
in § 169 and referred to as the elimination of the nodes.
These integrals, being satisfied identically, remain true when developed 
according to order and rank. Thus the third equation gives
^(f%.+^.+n!+Aa)=^zi=o
S + ifi,! + g\2 + v\2) = const.
which is the sum of the quadratic integrals both for the eccentric and the 
oblique variables. For has no terms of zero rank, and the purely periodic 
terms of the first order are excluded from consideration.
Thus Li is for the present purpose to be regarded as constant. The 
neglect of terms of the fourth degree in the disturbing function implies the 
neglect of the third degree in the variables £, 77 themselves. Hence to the 
same approximation the first two areal integrals give
SZi^ij2 = const., ^L^it2 = const.
These then are the two linear integrals found above for the oblique variables, 
and their physical meaning is thus explained. The constants are now 
interpreted (to a factor) as the angular momenta of the system about two 
rectangular axes in the arbitrary plane of reference. In particular, if the 
invariable plane of the system is taken as the plane of reference, both the 
constants will become zero.

Aoj (AOiO— ai)~l is of the order of 
An exception occurs when AOf()
is nearly equal to a; that is, when the period of the free oscillation nearly 
agrees with one of the forced periods imposed by the main planetary system. 
The corresponding amplitude then tends to become infinite. This condition 
is fulfilled at the mean distance from the Sun 1’95, or near the inner limit of 
the minor planets (Eros excepted), but for the inclinations only (A0t0 =/3i). 
But before any positive conclusion can be drawn for this case, the extremely 
limited development of the disturbing function must be remembered

CHAPTER XVII
SECULAR INEQUALITIES. METHOD OF GAUSS
184. 
A beautiful method of calculating the secular perturbations of the 
first order, due to the action of one planet on another, was proposed by Gauss 
in 1818. It was this method which was applied by Adams to the path of the 
Leonid meteors. Further developments have been given by several writers, 
and references will be found in an article  by H. v. Zeipel.

The component W contains as a factor k-m = n2a3m'/(I 4- m). We therefore 
write
n2a3m'r 1 f 2"
= WdM'
1+m 2tt J0
with similar reduced mean values No, To corresponding to S, T. If then a 
series of values of *S'O, To, Wo can be calculated for a number of points
Encyklopadie d. math. Wiss., vi. 2, p. 632.
The principle of the method is extremely simple. Equations for the 
variations of the elements have been found in a suitable form in § 142. As 
an example we may take (jm = n2as)
di _ 1 rlKcosw
dt na2 ‘ cos <£>
Here the right-hand side can be developed in terms of Jf, M', the mean 
anomalies of the disturbed and disturbing planets, in the form
di = A,o + X Ajj cos (jM +j'M' 4- q)
and hence., the coefficients being constant in the first approximation,
i - i» = AOtO 14- 2 Ajj sin (jM +j'M’ + q)Kjn +j'n).
If therefore the mean motions n, n' are incommensurable, so that (jn +j'n) 
can never vanish, Ao 01 constitutes the secular inequality in i. Now

[ch. xvii
regularly distributed round the disturbed orbit, they can be introduced into 
the equations for the variations and a simple quadrature will give the 
secular perturbations of the several elements, that of a being zero.
185. In calculating So, To, Jlr0> the disturbed planet occupies a given 
fixed point P in its orbit. It is clear that £0, 7'0, Wo are components of the 
mean attraction, with respect to the time, exercised at P by a unit mass 
describing the disturbing orbit, with unit constant of gravitation. They are 
the same as would result if the disturbing orbit were permanently loaded so 
as to constitute a material ring of the same total mass, when the density is 
proportional to dM' Ids'. Thus it is necessary to calculate the attraction of 
an elliptic ring of this kind.
Let any system of rectangular axes xyz be taken, with origin at P. Let 
(a?0, y0, z0) be the coordinates of the Sun, (x, y, z') those of a point P' on the 
disturbing orbit, and let da' be the area of an elementary focal sector, dV' 
the volume of the tetrahedron on the base da' with its apex at P. Then
2p.da' = 6dV' = x0{y’dz — z'dy') + y0(z'dx — x'dz) + z0(xdy- y'dx) 
where p is the perpendicular from P on the plane of da'. Hence one 
component of the required attraction at P is

Px= - I dM = —yr, hr. da = —h;tdY
2tt Jq A3 7rao J A3 Trabpjb?
where a', b' are the semi-axes of the disturbing orbit and A2 = x2 4- y2 + z2. 
This takes account of the first (principal) part of the disturbing function 
only: the second (indirect) part has been left out of consideration because 
(§ 159) it gives rise to no secular terms in the perturbations of the first order. 
It is now to be observed that xXsdV' is a homogeneous function of degree 0 
in x, y', z, and can therefore be expressed, since z'dy’ — y'dz' = z'2d (yjz'),..., 
in terms of x'fz', y'jz', which are connected by some relation
fWtf, y' Iz) = 0
which is the equation of the cone having its apex at P and the attracting 
ring as its section. Thus the integral factor of Px (and similarly of Py, Pz) 
depends only on the form of the cone and not on the particular section. 
This is true whatever the shape of the ring may be. But in the present case 
the cone is of the second degree, and the axes may now be identified with 
its principal axes, P (X, Y, Z). Let PZ be the internal axis and a, the 
semi-axes of the section Z— 1. The coordinates of P’ can be written
_X' = acosr, Y' = /3sinr, Z'=l
where r is the eccentric angle in the section, and
A2 = 1 + a2 cos2 r + /22 sin2 t, 6d V' = (— /3X0 cos r — a Yo sin t + a/2Z0) dr.

186. It is now necessary to consider the geometry of the problem. Let 
the angular elements of the disturbed orbit be ft, i, &>, and of the disturbing 
orbit fl', i', w. These are referred to the ecliptic, which it is convenient to 
eliminate by referring the latter orbit directly to the former. With some 
change in the notation of § 67 the equations there found give

Here 11" is the distance of the intersection of the two orbits from the ecliptic 
node of the disturbed orbit, i" is the mutual inclination of the two planes, 
and &>" is the distance of the perihelion of the disturbing orbit from the 
intersection.
Two sets of rectangular axes, with an arbitrary origin 0, are now to be 
defined. For 0 (%, y, £) the directions are those of S, T, W, so that 0% is 
parallel to the radius vector at P, Or] is parallel to the plane of the disturbed 
orbit and 90° in advance of 0%, and 0% is in the direction of the N. pole of 
this orbit. For the second set, 0 (x, y, z), Ox is directed towards the peri­
helion of the disturbing planet, Oy is parallel to the plane of the disturbing 
orbit and 90° in advance of Ox, and Oz is directed towards, the N. pole of this 
orbit. Let v be the true anomaly at P, and
<d + v — fl" =
the distance of P from the intersection of the orbits. Then the relations 
between the two systems of coordinates are given by the scheme:
£ 
V 
t
x cos to" cos sin &>" sin Vi cosi" — cos to" sin sin co" cos WjCos?i" sin to" sini" 
y —sinto"cos01+costo"sin«j1cosfc" sin to"sinv1+costo"cosw1cosi" costo"sini"

Thus if r is the radius vector at P, and the origin 0 be taken at the centre 
of the disturbing orbit, the coordinates of P are (x1} ylt z^, where
xY = a'e + r (cos to" cos + sin to" sin Vi cos i")
y1 = r (— sin to" cos vY + cos to" sin cos z"), z1 = —r sin sin i" — p 
and a, e are the mean distance and eccentricity of the disturbing orbit.
187. 
Consider now the confocal system of quadrics of which the 
disturbing orbit is the focal ellipse
x2 y2 
a^b'2
The parameters Xn X2, Xs of the three quadrics passing through the point 
(a?j, yi, zi) are given by
a;/ y^ zf 
a2 + X b'2 + X X
or as the roots of the cubic
X3 — X2 (xf + y2 + ZJ2 —a2 — b'2)
+ X (a'2b'2 - azy2 - b2x2 - a'2zx2 - b^zf) - a,2b'2zf =0 ....... (2)
Now the axes of any tangent cone to a quadric are the normals to the three 
confocals which can be drawn through the vertex of the cone, and this 
remains true in the particular case where the focal ellipse is a section of 

186, 187]

the cone. Hence the relations between the sets of coordinates (X, Y, Z) and 
(x, y, z) are given by the scheme:

P3Z1I^3
where px, p2, p3 are such that
px* [xx2 (a2 + A,)'2 + y2 (b'2 + X,)“2 + zx2X^\ = 1,....
When combined with the scheme given above for (x, y, z), (£, 17, £), this gives 
the relations between (A, Y, Z) and (£, 17, £).
The equation of the cone is
(zx, - xzx)2 (zyx - yzj2 
~~d2 
+ pi ~ <S-^)
for this is clearly homogeneous and of the second degree in x — xx, y-yx, 
z — zx, and its section by the plane z = 0 is the disturbing orbit. Transposed 
to parallel axes through its vertex (xx, y1} zx) it becomes
_ £ _ 2L2 _ ZL _i_ y? _ 1 \ 
a'2 b’2 z?\,a'2 b'2 J b'2 * zx a'2 ‘zx
= X2/Xx + Y2/X2 + Z2/X3 = F_x = 0.
The justification for identifying these two forms is seen on comparing the 
three functions of the coefficients which remain invariant under a rotation 
of the axes. It will then be found that the results are equivalent to the 
relations between the coefficients and roots of (2).
It is convenient to write down the equation of the reciprocal cone. The 
coefficients are th(±. minors of the discriminant of the previous equation 
= 0. Hence with due care in choosing the right multiplier the desired 
equation may be written
x2 (xf - a'2) + y2 (yx2 - b'2) + z2zx2 + 2yz yxzx + 2zxzxxx + 2xyxxyx
= Xx X2 + X2 F2 + X3Z2 = Fx = 0
the invariant relations being identical with those between the coefficients 
and roots of (2).
Also
x2 + y2 + z2 = X2+ Y2 + Z2= £2 + i72+ £2 = Fo
and it is evident that F_u Fx can also be readily expressed, by means of the 
transformation scheme of § 186, in terms of £, 77, £

Two of the roots of the cubic (2) are negative and one positive, 
since two of the corresponding quadrics are hyperboloids and one an ellipsoid. 
Let
Xj < X2 0 < ^3.
The axis of Z is then the internal axis of the cone F_r and it follows that
a==-X‘

X3 1 + a2 X3 — Xj
The elliptic integrals F, E can therefore be found. The coordinates of the 
Sun relative to the point P are x0 = a'e' — y0 = — y1} z0 = — zt in the system 
(sc, y, z) and (Xo, Yo, Zo) can be deduced by the transformation scheme of 
§ 187. Hence Px, Py, Pz become known, and the components P( = S0, 
P^^Tq, P^— JFo may be derived by applying the two transformations of 
§§ 186 and 187.
It is unnecessary here to consider the equations for all the inequalities.

Suppose that j values of = r cos u . 1FO have been found, corresponding 
to j points around the disturbed orbit at which Jf has equidistant values,

and it is only necessary to calculate the average value of to have the 
secular inequality. For the major planets j = 12 practically suffices. The 
summation formula for a0 really gives a0 4- cij + .... It is therefore necessary 
to take j large enough to make aj negligible. The number of points to be 
taken on the disturbed orbit thus depends on the practical convergency of 
the series a0, alf a2>....
It is, however, preferred to take points equidistant in E, the eccentric 
anomaly, instead of M, since this secures a more even distribution in arc. 
The advantage of this course seems scarcely obvious, because it appears to 
weight unduly the part of the orbit which is passed over rapidly. But the 
modification is easily made. In this case

The cubic (2) has three real roots and can be easily solved. It is 
now to be seen that the solution can be avoided. Let the equation be 
written
X3 + 3Z\X2 + 3£2X + k3 = 0
the roots being X,, X3, and let the result of removing the second term be 
4X'3-#2X'-#3 = 0
of which the roots are eY, e2, e3. Then
g2 = — 4 (e2e3 + e3&i + e^) = 12 (k? - kf

Thus

z = cos 87, x = sin2 87 = g~

 (g — 1) and since there can be only one convergent 
series for y in powers of x, this is it. The above series may therefore be 
replaced by
F(TV> 1, s^2 37), F(- TV ^n2 3?)

Now V is a homogeneous quadratic function in (x, y, z) and can be

simply. Let the transformation scheme of § 186 be written

= ^{^(r2 — b'2 + b'2l32 + 2derl1) + 2y (de’rm^ + b'^m^ + 2£(de’rn^ + b’2l3nf\ 
with neglect of terms not containing £. Similarly
F-i = z2fz2 — (zx\ — xZiYI d2z2 — (zyx — yz^j b'^zf.
The last term does not contain £ and hence
d2r2l^F_1 = d2 (l3^ +

or
F_j = {b'2l3^ + 2y (b'2m3+de'rn2) + 2£ (b'2n3 — de'rm2)} £/d2r2l3.
Thus Fu Fo, F-l are now expressed, as far as necessary, in terms of y, 
It remains to calculate Hl and H2, and then the simple comparison of the 
coefficients of ^2, ^tj, in (5) and (6) gives So, To, Wo.
It must be understood that it is not the object here to obtain the most 
practical form of calculation in its final shape, but rather to explain the 
mathematical principles involved and to be content with showing how the 
computation might be carried out. The method was not developed by 
Gauss in the complete form which is necessary for practical computations. 
This was done by Hill. The introduction of elliptic functions in the modem 
form is due to Halphen.

CHAPTER XVIII
SPECIAL PERTURBATIONS
193. In Chapter XV some explanation has been given of the various 
classes into which planetary perturbations naturally fall when regarded from 
a practical point of view. There is, however, another kind of distinction 
which can be drawn among perturbations, depending on the mode of calculation 
and expression. When they are expressed in an analytical form, from which 
their values can be deduced for any time simply by giving t its appropriate 
value, they are called absolute perturbations. For all the major planets 
a theory has been developed in this form. But such a theory, if it is to be 
complete and accurate, demands immense labour, which is justified if positions 
of a planet are constantly required. Moreover questions of general theory 
must nearly always be based on analytical forms. On the other hand there 
are bodies which are observed during one short period only, like the majority 
of comets, or at relatively long intervals, like the periodic comets. In such 
cases, which include also the orbits of the minor planets, the method of 
quadratures is resorted to, partly in order to save labour and partly to avoid 
difficulties which have not hitherto been surmounted by analysis. Perturba­
tions calculated in this way are called special perturbations. The advantage 
of the method is that it is generally applicable, though against this must be 
set the frequent necessity of continuing the calculation without a break 
through long intervals when no observations have been made, and the im­
possibility of making any general inference as to the motion outside the actual 
period covered by the computations. There are exceptions to this statement, 
because important researches have been made with success into the origin of 
comets by the method of special perturbations, and the periodic solutions of 
the problem of three bodies have also been largely investigated by the method 
of quadratures. But generally the services of this method have been of a 
practical rather than a theoretical kind.
The method of quadratures involves an arithmetical technique with which 
the reader may not be familiar. It therefore lies strictly outside the intended 
scope of this work, which is not concerned with the actual details of practical 
calculation. But the computation of special perturbations fills so large a place 
in the practice of astronomy at the present time that it cannot be dismissed

without some description. Accordingly, in order to interrupt the treatment 
of dynamical questions as little as possible, a brief account of the algebra of 
difference tables is given in the final chapter of the book, and the results will 
be quoted here without proof.
194. Let yn be a tabulated function of the argument t = a + nw, where n 
represents a series of consecutive integers and w is a constant tabular interval. 
As the practical formulae of quadrature depend on central differences, it will 
be convenient to represent the difference table thus:
K-'yn ... 
yn 
... Kyn ... K*y
n ................
... 
^R~xyn ... 
... b.Kyn ... 
&K
*y
n ...
Here yn is tabulated in a vertical column and the successive differences on 
the right are formed directly in the usual way. Thus Ayn = yn+1 — yny and 
the commutative operator K, which is clearly appropriate to central (or hori­
zontal) differences, represents a move two places to the right on a horizontal 
line of the table. Similarly K~x represents a horizontal move two places to 
the left. Two columns are shown on the left of the tabulated function, and 
these are known as the first and second summation columns. The relation of 
each to the adjacent columns on the right is precisely the same as that 
holding between any two consecutive difference columns. Thus the first 
summation column contains the differences of the second, and the differences 
of the first are the successive values of the function itself. The first column 
can therefore be based on an arbitrary constant and formed in the downward 
direction by adding the numerical values of the function successively. The 
second summation column is based on a second arbitrary constant and formed 
from the first in the same way.
The table thus constructed has alternate blank spaces. These are now 
filled by the insertion of the arithmetic means of the entries standing im­
mediately above and below each space. In its completed form the table may 
be represented thus:
A'“1yn ... yn [&yw] Kyn 
AK-'yn [k'yn] &yn [k’Kyn]
\kKyn\ K*y
n \kK^yn\ ... 
&Kyn [k'K2yn] &K2yn ...
where the mean differences are distinguished by k to the right of a simple 
difference or by k' below a simple difference. As a matter of fact,
tf=l + |A, A;=A(1+|A)(1 + A)-1, K = A2 (1 +
but for the immediate purpose in view these operators serve merely to define 
the position of entries in the difference table. They are all algebraic.

where m is written in the upper limit in the place of n +1. The commutative 
operator k must of course be carefully distinguished from the Gaussian 
constant k.

the lower limit is to be c = a,

The application of quadratures to the solution of differential equa­
tions such as arise in dynamical problems can be explained by a simple but 
fairly general form. Consider the equation

&x = X.

Kxn
*^n+l xn
tn+i &n+i 
Kxn+1
^n+2 ^n+i 
tn+2 ^h+2
Here Xn is a known function of xn and tn. It is required to find xn+3 and Arn+3 
which depend on «n+3 and on one another, so that they cannot be calculated 
directly. For simplicity the time interval w may be imagined to be so small 
that —K'-Xn+1 is negligible. The general run of the differences KX will 
suggest a close guess to the value of KXn+2, though the true value requires 
a knowledge of Xn+3 and therefore of xn+3 itself. This leads to a correspond­
ing provisional value of Kxn+2 by (1) and hence to xn+3 — xn+2 or xn+3. Then 
Xn+3 can be calculated, in general, with the accuracy which is finally necessary. 
If this be so, KXn+2 is now accurately known, and hence xn+3 by a simple 
repetition of the same process, in which if need be an allowance for K2X can 
be made. After every few steps in the calculation the whole can be rigorously 
checked by the difference formula (1) and either verified or corrected if 
necessary. In general small corrections of xn do not entail a re-adjustment 
of Xn.
197. This is the principle of the method employed by Cowell and 
Crommelin in calculating the path of Halley’s Comet during the two revolu­
tions 1759-1835-1910. It is the crudest possible method in the sense that 
it ignores completely what is known of the approximate orbit and is based on 
the equations of motion in their primitive form, but it is none the less ex­
tremely effective for its practical purpose. The origin of coordinates is taken 

222
Special Perturbations
[ch. xviii
at the centre of gravity of the solar system, with the axis of x towards the 
equinox, the axis of y towards longitude 90° and the axis of z towards the 
N. pole of the ecliptic for a stated fixed epoch. The equations of motion are 
then (§ 20)

where

and 2 includes the Sun and all the disturbing planets. Thus the typical 
equation may be written
+ 12^”240jfir2 +604807<3“ 
where
X = — S (kPuPnij) (x — Xj) rj~s
and k^w^mj is a constant for each attracting body. The problem, being in 
three dimensions, involves the parallel solution of the three similar equations 
for x, y and z. It is convenient to change the time interval from time to time 
according to circumstances, in order to economise labour in computing the 
forces by making the interval as long as experience may show to be practicable. 
In the example referred to, w = 2p days, where p has integral values ranging 
from 1 in the neighbourhood of the Sun to 8 in the most distant part of the 
orbit. As the comet recedes from the Sun it becomes feasible to treat first 
Venus and later the Earth and Mars as forming a centrobaric system with 
the Sun, so that the separate computation of their attractions is avoided. 
The solution is started by deriving the rectangular coordinates of the comet 
on two consecutive dates from the osculating elements at the intermediate 
epoch 1835.
A similar treatment has been applied to the path of Jupiter’s eighth 
satellite, which is so distant from its primary that the solar perturbations are 
relatively very considerable.
198. 
The above process is closely related to the more usual method of 
calculating special perturbations in rectangular coordinates, which dates from 
Encke. Here the origin is taken at the centre of the Sun and a fixed ecliptic 
system of axes is generally chosen. Let (x, y, z) be the position of the 
disturbed body P, (xj, yit Zj) of the typical disturbing planet Pj, and let 
SP = r, SPj = pj and PPj = &j. Then the equations of motion of P relative 
to the Sun are of the form (§ 23)

The right-hand side contains (£, y, f) implicitly, and therefore extrapolation 
is necessary as in § 197. But in the first member £, which is of the first 
order in mj, is multiplied by mj and hence if the second order in nij be 
neglected (x0, y0, z0) can be directly substituted for (x, y, z\ This is conse­
quently known as the direct member, but it is quite possible to include 
approximate values of the perturbations as they become known in the course 
of the work, and thus to make allowance for the higher orders of the disturb­
ing masses. The second member, which has been called the indirect member, 
has no small multiplier and besides is expressed as the difference of two 
nearly equal quantities. To avoid this inconvenience the transformation
£=l + 2j. ^ = (1 + 23)-’ = I-/9 
is made, where
Q = (r2 - r02)/2r02 = 
£ + (y0 + i y) V + (z0 +

for £ now becomes

with parallel equations for y and £. This treatment is not applied to the 
planets with sensible masses, but only to bodies whose masses are negligible 
and generally unknown. Hence h = k2r0~3.
Suppose that n — 1 steps in the quadrature have been carried out, so that 
£n-i are known and £n is required. As in § 197 w2 can be omitted by

Here Sx,n comprises the terms which can be directly calculated, for 
represents the direct terms, K~'£n follows from the previous stage of the 
quadrature, and K£n can be extrapolated easily owing to its small multiplier. 
Also a?n=a?0+£m is known well enough since it is multiplied by q. But q itself 
is not accurately known. By combining the three parallel equations of the 
same type as the last with the above equation for q, it follows that
Qro2 
+ pg 
= 
2 Sx,n + hfy. ~^2 Xn
where 5 refers to the three coordinates. Thus, f being easily extrapolated, 
q can be calculated. The combination of (3) and (5) now gives
fn = tXn + h (1 + ~ hj (fqxn - SXi n)
whence £n can be calculated, and therefore £n by (4). Thus the quadrature, 
once started, proceeds step by step.
In order to start the quadrature the four dates are taken such that the 
epoch of osculation coincides with the centre of the middle interval. With 
£ = 0 the direct terms in £ are calculated and the difference table is formed. 
By applying (27) and (34) approximate values of £ are obtained whereby the 
indirect terms can be brought in. The process is then repeated until the 
final approximation is reached. The rest of the calculation, giving the results 
by means of (30), has already been explained.
199. 
Special perturbations may also be directly calculated for polar 
coordinates. Let the cylindrical coordinates of the disturbed mass m be 
(p, 0, z), the fundamental plane being the plane of the osculating orbit itself 
at the epoch t0, and the initial line passing through the ecliptic node. The 
rectangular coordinates of the typical disturbing planet, of mass nij, relative 
to the Sqn are
Xj = rj cos Bj cos Lj, yj = rj cos Bj sin Lj, Zj — Vj sin Bj.
The kinetic energy of m is (p2 + p202 + i2), and therefore the equations of 
motion are, since r2 = p2 + z3,

where 0O is the initial value of 0 and w0 is the distance of the undisturbed 
perihelion from the node. The angle Aw, which represents and is defined by 
the double integral, would vanish in the absence of disturbing forces. In the 
same circumstances V would be the undisturbed true anomaly. Thus V may 
be regarded as the disturbed true anomaly and Aw as a rotation of the apse.
In the rotating orbit thus defined, in which the elements p0, a0, e0, </>0 keep 
their osculating values, let p (1 + v)-1 be the radius vector corresponding to 
the true anomaly V, so that, since V = hp~2,

Again, instead of finding V by a direct quadrature, the necessary correction 
N is found to the mean anomaly calculated with the undisturbed mean motion 
n0, so as to reproduce the true anomaly V or the eccentric anomaly E in the 
rotating orbit. Thus
E — e0 sin E = Mo + n0 (t — 4) + N

Special Perturbations

Perturbations to the first order will be obtained by calculating the quanti­
ties occurring in the differential equations according to the osculating elements, 
but as they become known in the course of the work their approximate effect 
on the coordinates of the disturbed planet can be introduced before integra­
tion. The integral of U, and also iV and Aw, can thus be found by direct 
quadrature by applying (27) and (28). For v and z, which require exactly 
similar treatment, the case is slightly different. As before, the time interval 
w is removed by writing w2ZX for k1, which is equivalent to making this interval 
the unit of time. Then at any stage n, when zn_^ and K~l‘zn are known,
Zn = (k~' + J2 - 
K +...I z„
(i + ±2^)z„ = (/c-.-2-l-0^n + 1121r,
= JT, (1 + X ((tf- - k) + X 17,}
and this last equation will determine zn with the needful accuracy, and 
hence zn and K^z^ for the next stage.
This method is due in principle to Hansen. The perturbations start from 
zero values and remain small for a considerable length of time. This conduces 
to accuracy and is an advantage. The method is less simple than that of 
rectangular coordinates, and for the easier construction of an ephemeris 
requires the determination of new osculating elements by a process which is 
itself complicated and is omitted here. Perturbations of the coordinates are 
recommended by the fact that there are three coordinates as against six 
elements to be determined by quadratures, and their computation is suitable 
for practical needs in the case of a body, such as a periodic comet, which can 
only be observed at relatively long intervals. Otherwise it is preferred to 
perform the calculation on the elements directly.

where after differentiation z = 0, because the plane of reference is the plane

planet, which with log rj are given in annual tables like the Nautical Almanac.

which is the scheme derived in § 65. Hence

7j = cos Bj sin Lj — cos bj cos i sin (lj — f 1) + sin bj sin i
= cos Bj = — cos bj sin i sin (lj — fl) + sin bj cos i
and thus Fit F2, Fs can be calculated, so far as the coordinates of any disturb­
ing planet are concerned.
But Fi, F2, Fa and the coefficients [i, 3], ..., involve also the varying 
elements and coordinates which depend on them. The elements may be 
identified with the osculating elements at the initial epoch t0 and the co­
ordinates may be calculated as in undisturbed motion. Then the result of 
mechanical integration will give the perturbations of the first order. When 
these are known for the several dates covered by the work, the calculation 
can be repeated with the improved values and a higher approximation can be 
obtained. The work can be arranged so as to obviate this repetition by 
including the perturbations to date at each step.
204. 
The five elements i, D, </>, -ct, n require only a single quadrature. 
The lower limit a + is made to coincide with the epoch of osculation and 
the tables are formed in accordance with (27). The corresponding perturba­
tions are then given by (28) or (26) according as a + nw or a + (n + |) w is 
preferred for the final date. It is to be noticed that the differential equations 
for the elements have been reduced to a form in which w occurs explicitly as 
a coefficient of the derivatives on the left-hand side. It will disappear when 
the quadratures are effected, its function being to make the unit of time agree 
with the tabular interval. But the unit of time is not really changed, and 
with the ordinary Gaussian constant k occurring in the combination kwntj for 
each disturbing planet remains one mean solar day. Thus the perturbation 
in n which will be drawn by this process will be the increment in the mean 
daily motion. Since all the elements are in the form of angles, it is con­
venient to express k, so far as it occui-s in Fu F2, F3 through the combination 
kwmj, by its value in arc (logk" = 3’55...). But in [n, 1], [??, 2] k has its 
purely numerical value (log& = 8'235...).
The perturbation in M can be conveniently divided into two parts. The 
first,
biM = w-1 [{(Jf, 1] F, 4- [M, 2] F2} dt
is calculated in precisely the same way as the other five elements. The second is

and (28), the second can be performed by means of (34) and (30). The

immediate result will give 
which must therefore be multiplied by w2.
To avoid this large multiplier it is usual to calculate wbn from w^dnjdt at the 
first quadrature (giving the increment in the w-day mean motion). This 
alters the time unit of the acceleration and therefore no multiplier will be 
required by a result which can be otherwise seen by noticing that all 
the tabular entries are multiplied by w, while the integrand is divided by w, 
being in fact dnfdt instead of w. dn/dt as in the first quadrature actually 
performed on this plan.
205. In the case of parabolic and nearly parabolic orbits some modifica­
tion is necessary. The equations for i, fl and -nr remain valid, except that it 
is well to replace </> by e. The equation for e itself becomes

Thus a valid form for the perturbation of q is obtained. If Fx, F2 have

But these coefficients are in a form absolutely unsuitable for calculation,

and the problem is thus solved in a practical way. Similar treatment can be

207. It sometimes happens that a comet approaches a planet (generally 
Jupiter) so closely that the disturbing force due to the planet is actually 
greater than the force due to the solar attraction. It is then more convenient 
to refer the motion to the centre of the planet and to treat the solar action as 
the disturbing force.
In the ordinary case the equations of motion of the comet are of the form

7s \ A3 p3/
where M is the mass of the Sun, m the mass of the planet, and the origin is 
at the centre of the Sun. If S, P, C are the positions of Sun, planet and 
comet, CS = r, CP = A, SP = p. The equations involve no assumption as to the 
relative masses of the Sun and planet, and if they are interchanged the 
equations of motion of the comet take the form
dt2 A3 \ r3 psJ
where the origin is at the centre of the planet, so that x=x' 4- £,..., a/ + £,=0,.... 
The advantage of either form depends on the ratio of the total disturbing 
force to the corresponding central attraction, and it will rest with the latter if
that is, if p. = m/M, when

To gain an idea of the planet’s sphere of influence the approximation need not 
go further. On the other side of the inequality the first term preponderates 
and it can be further simplified by taking r = p. Thus the significant terms 
of the lowest order in A give the inequality

and the polar equation, with coordinates (A, 0) and origin at the centre of 
the planet,

represents a meridian of the bounding surface, which is one of revolution 
and differs little from a sphere. Its radius for Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus is 
about a third, and for Neptune rather more than half, of an astronomical 
unit.
When the comet enters this sphere of influence its relative coordinates 
(«! — a?/, yx — yi, zx — z^) or (£n and its relative velocity £) are 
known and its orbit about the planet can be found, with the constant of 
attraction k2m. It remains within the sphere so short a time that the solar 
perturbation can generally be neglected, and on emergence a return is made 
to the heliocentric orbit, based on the new position (£2 + ®2, ife + y*,
 $2 + ^2) or 
(a?2, y2, ^2) and the velocity (x2, y2, z2).

CHAPTER XIX
THE RESTRICTED PROBLEM OF THREE BODIES
208. The general problem of three bodies is reduced to a relatively 
simple and ideal form when two of the masses describe circles in one plane 
about their common centre of gravity and the third body has a mass so small 
as not to affect this circular motion in any appreciable degree. Let OXYZ 
be a set of rectangular axes rotating with angular velocity n about OZ, OX 
following OY, and let the coordinates of the masses p, v be (— c1} 0, 0), (c2, 0, 0) 
where pci = vc2. The velocity components in space of a small body at P (£, 7), £) 
are (f — tw;, j? 4- 
£) and hence the kinetic energy of unit mass is

where in this case

multiplied respectively by £, 17, £, gives Jacobi’s integral of energy
v2 = ^2 + 7)2 + t2 = 2V + n2 (£2 + 7f) - C
and in accordance with Kepler’s law
k2 (jjb 4- v) = n2 (Cj 4- c2)3.
209. 
This integral has a very simple and important practical application. 
Let us return to fixed axes through p, so that
£ 4- Cj = x cos I + y sin I, 7) = y cost —xsva.1, £= z 
where I is the longitude of v and I = n. Then
£2 4- ?)2 = (£ 4- ny)2 4- (y — nx)2
^2 + t)2 = x2 + y2 — 2cj (x cos 14- y sin 1) 4- c/2.

2O8-2io] The Restricted Problem of Three Bodies 237
Hence Jacobi’s integral becomes
& + f + & + 2n (yx — xy) = 2 F — 2n2cT (x cos 14- y sin 1) + ??2c12 — C.
The special circumstances under which this integral can be usefully 
employed are these. A periodic comet between two appearances in the 
neighbourhood of the Sun may pass in close proximity to a large planet, 
Jupiter for example. In that event the elements may be so altered that at 
the second return the identity of the comet is doubtful. At times when the 
perturbations are small and the heliocentric motion is sensibly elliptic,
x" + y2 + i2 = k2 (%p!pi — p/d) 
xy — yx = k\! (pp) cos i
the latter being the projection of the areal velocity on the plane of the 
disturbing planet. Hence
— k2p]a — 2kn d(pp) cos i = 2k~v]p2 — 2n2cx (x cos I + y sin I) + n2^2 — C.
It is supposed that the change in the observed osculating elements takes 
place almost impulsively within the region of the planet’s influence. This 
region is small and nearly spherical. Hence p2 is the same at the beginning 
and end of the encounter, and the changes in x, y and I are small. These can 
be neglected together with the other planetary perturbations, and therefore 
approximately
p/d + 2&-1n d(pp') cos i' = p/a" + 2&-1n d(pp") cos i" 
where a', a" are the mean distances of the comet, p’, p" the parameters, and 
i', i" the inclinations of the orbit to the orbit of the disturbing planet, before 
and after the encounter. For the Sun p = 1 and A?(l + v) = n2a3, where a is 
the mean distance of the planet, and if v be neglected
a'~f + 2a~^p^ cosi’ = a"-1 + 2a~
*p"^
 cos i"
which is the criterion of identity proposed by Tisserand. It has been assumed 
that the orbit of the disturbing planet is circular, but some allowance can be 
made for the eccentricity of the orbit by taking into account the actual 
motion of the planet at the time of the suspected encounter.
210. Let the problem of § 208 be now reduced to two dimensions = 0). 
Then
Ppi + W? = P (£ + Ci)2 + pd + v (J; - c2)2 + vy2
= (p + v) (£2 + y2) + pc2 + vc22.
Let the units be so chosen that k— 1 and Ci + c2= 1, with the consequence 
that p + v = n2. The equations of relative motion may now be written

The Restricted Problem of Three Bodies [ch. xix
where
2ft = /z (2P1-1 + P12) + v (2/V1 + p22)
and the integral of relative energy is
v2 = 2ft - C.
These are the equations used by Sir G. H. Darwin, with the masses /z = 10, 
v = l, in his researches on periodic orbits. Now it is obvious that v2 cannot 
become negative under any circumstances. Hence the curves of the family 
given in bipolar coordinates by the equation
2ft = 6*
are of great importance in the restricted problem of three bodies, because they 
represent barrier curves which cannot be crossed by trajectories characterized 
by corresponding values of C. Thus if the barrier curve, or curve of zero 
velocity, is a simple loop within which a part of the trajectory lies, then the 
trajectory can never pass outside. If the lunar theory can be compared with 
this simpler problem it is found that the orbit of the Moon lies within such a 
closed curve surrounding the Earth, and therefore the Moon cannot recede 
beyond a certain limiting distance from the Earth. This remark is due 
to Hill.
The simplest view of the general character of the curves of zero velocity 
is gained by considering them as the contour lines of the surface
2ft = z, z = C.
If the axis of z is taken vertically upwards, and motion for a given value of C 
is supposed to take place on the actual contour plane z = C, then it is 
evidently restricted to those parts of the plane which lie underneath the 
surface, since elsewhere in the plane the velocity becomes imaginary. Now 
the main features of the surface are easily represented topographically. At 
the points where the masses /z, v are situated the surface rises to infinity, but 
in the neighbourhood of these singular points may be treated as two peaks. 
At any considerable distance from them the terms pp2 + vp2 are predominant, 
and the surface rises indefinitely in all directions. Now 2ft may be expressed 
in the form
2ft = 3 (p + v) + /z (P1 - I)2 (1 + 2/V1) + v (P2 - I)2 (1 + 2p2-9
and clearly has an absolute minimum value 3 (/z + v) when P1 = p2 = 1, i.e. at 
the vertices of the equilateral triangle on the line joining the masses /z, v. 
These points represent the bottom of two valleys, and a simple consideration 
of the continuity of the surface shows that these valleys must be connected 
by three passes, one between the two masses and the others on the same line 
but on opposite sides of the two masses and separating them from the rising 
surface as it recedes in the distance. ~ If it be added that the highest pass is 

210. 211] The Restricted Problem of Three Bodies 239
that which lies between the masses and the lowest is on the other side of the 
greater mass, the general order of development of the contour lines should be 
sufficiently evident. The critical curves for Darwin’s special case, p = 10, 
v = 1, are illustrated in fig. 7. The whole is symmetrical about the line SJ.
211. 
The points at which the ovals coalesce or disappear evidently

is obviously symmetrical with respect to the rotating masses.

x — 2ny = fl10 + il^x 4- flny 4- ...
y + 2nx = fl01 + £lnx + £lmy + ... 
where
provided fl is regular at the point (f0, ^0) and x, y are not too large. 
If
(fo. Vo) is a point of relative equilibrium, or as it has been called 
a point
of libration, and x, y are very small, the linear equations
x — 2ny = il^x + flny 
y + 2nx = ilux+ £lmy
are obtained, and these determine the nature of the equilibrium at (£0, y0). 
For they, are satisfied by the solution
x = h cos (mt — a), y — k cos (mi — /3) 
provided
— 2mnk sin = (wi2 + h cos a + kilu cos /?
2mnk cos = (m2 + fla,) h sin a 4- k£ln sin ft
2mnh sin a = h£ln cos a + (m2 + f I02) k cos /3 
— 2mnh cos a = Aflu sin a 4- (m2 4- £lm) k sin ft.
These equations, which result from equating coefficients of cos mt, sin mt, are 
equivalent to
(m2 4- H20) h sin (a — j8) = 2mnk
Hln sin (a — /3) = — 2winA; cos (a — /S)
(m2 + Q^k sin (a -/3) = 2mnh
h£ln sin (a- /3)= — 2mnh cos (a — ft).
There are only three independent equations here, and this should be so 
because the only quantities which can be determined are the ratio of
p. d. a.

amplitudes hfk, the difference of phases a — /3, and in. The three equations 
may be written
h2 (m2 + fLjo) = k2 {in2 + n02) 
tan (a — /3) = — 2mn
(m2 + O^) {m2 + floa) = 47n2n2 + fl2n
and these determine a series of infinitesimal elliptic orbits about a point’of 
libration when m has a real value. With certain simple developments such 
a series can be traced into a family of finite periodic orbits.
213. 
The third equation, that is the quadratic in m2,
_ W2 (4n2 _ 
4- 
- fl2n = 0
decides the question of stability and may be examined more closely. If the 
roots in m2 are complex or negative, real exponential functions of the time 
enter into the disturbed motion and equilibrium is unstable. If the roots 
are real, but of opposite sign, an unstable mode of motion is associated with 
a possible elliptic mode and equilibrium is again unstable. Here the point 
is surrounded by an unstable family of orbits initially elliptic. This is 
illustrated by the collinear points of libration. For it is easily found that 
when t) = 0
Gu = 0, n20 = Zi(2pr3+l) + i/(2p2-3+l)
so that is positive. Now at the point of libration between the masses

and therefore, since y = 0,
_i an i an_/i i\ f

pJ'^v1 pi2)
which is negative since px < 1. Similarly n^ is negative at the other collinear 
points of libration. Hence at these three points the absolute term of the 
quadratic in m2 is negative and the roots are real and of opposite sign. Each 
of the points is therefore surrounded by a family of unstable periodic orbits. 
It has been suggested by Gylden and by Moulton that the phenomenon 
known as the Gegenschein is due to sunlight reflected by meteors which, in 
spite of the instability, are temporarily retained in the neighbourhood of that 
centre of libration in the Sun-Earth system which is opposite to the Sun and 
at a distance of about 938,000 miles from the Earth.
When both values of m2 are positive the disturbed motion is the resultant 
of two elliptic motions, and equilibrium is stable. This may be illustrated 
by the “ equilateral ” centres of libration. At one of these

Hence the quadratic in m? becomes, since n2 = p + v,
m“ — m2(p + v) + -£pv = 0
and the roots are real and positive if
(p + v)2 > 27pv
an inequality which is satisfied if p)v is 25 or greater. In that case the 
equilateral centres of libration are surrounded by two distinct families of 
stable periodic orbits which are ellipses in their elementary form, with periods 
tending to 2-7r/?rz. If the masses are more nearly equal, the roots of the 
equation in m2 are complex, and no such periodic orbits exist.
Since the masses in the system Sun-Jupiter satisfy the condition of 
stability, and the disturbing influence of Jupiter predominates over the 
minor planets, it might be expected that planets would be found in this 
group approximating to the equilateral configuration. Such planets, with 
a mean motion nearly equal to that of Jupiter, have actually been discovered.
214. A valuable insight into the general character of the solutions of the 
problem of three bodies is obtained from the periodic solutions because they 
repeat themselves after every period. These solutions have therefore been 
the subject of much laborious study. But such orbits will not be indefinitely 
permanent unless they are also stable. Hence it is necessary to study them 
in relation to those orbits which initially differ but little from them.

Again, let (u, u) be the components of velocity in space of P in directions 
coinciding with ds, dp. Since these lines are rotating with the absolute

then those which contain Bp,
This result may be used to give 0 another form, namely
®=;3?+2n!+2(^+n)’i-'V!n ......... w
where V2 = 32/3p2 + “fffos2 =

than Hill’s because V2 (not to be confounded with the three-dimensional V2) 
does not depend on any particular direction.

independent variable. Then (3) becomes

215. When the unvaried orbit is periodic, © is a periodic function of t 
with the same period T. The equation (3) is therefore a particular case of a 
linear differential equation with periodic coefficients. Its general theory may 
be indicated. Since the equation is unaltered when t is replaced by t + T, 
g (t + T) is a solution if g (t) is one. But every solution is a linear combination 

246 The Restricted Problem of Three Bodies [ch. xix
of any two others which are independent. Hence if g represents g(t) and 
G represents g(t + T), glf g2 being any two solutions,
= a0i + @02, G2 = yg, + bg2
where a, /3, 7, 8 are constants, not unrelated. For since g1} g2 are two solutions

Hence aS — /By = 1. Let f,f2 be two other independent solutions. Then
0i = af +bf2, g2 = cf. +df2
G\ = aFx + bF2, G2 = cF1 + dF2
and the result of eliminating glt g2, Gx, G2 is
F^Afi + Bf, F2 = Cfi + Df2 
where
(ad — be) A = ada + cd/3 — aby — bcb
(ad — bc)B = bd (a — S) + d2/3 — fry 
(ad — bc)C — — ac(a — b) — c2/B + a2y 
(ad — bc)D = — bca — cd/B + aby + adb.
Hence J. + D = a + S is a constant independent of the choice of particular 
solutions, as well as AD — BC = ab — /By = l. But it is now possible to choose 
b/d and a/c so that B=C=0. Then
Fi = Af, F2 = Df2, AD = 1
and the functions j\,f2 are defined by the property that they are multiplied 
by constants when the argument is increased by the period T. Hence the 
general solution of the differential equation may be written
bp —a^ <£>1 (t) + 
</>2 (t)
where <j>1} </>2 are periodic functions with the same period as ® and 
cosh kT = £ (a + S), a constant which can be derived from any pair of inde­
pendent solutions. The quantities + k are what Poincare has called 
characteristic exponents. If A; is a pure imaginary circular functions are 
involved and bp has no tendency to increase beyond a certain limit. The 
periodic orbit is then stable. If on the contrary k is real or complex real 
exponential functions are involved and bp will increase indefinitely. The 
orbit is then unstable.
The question of stability therefore involves essentially the determination 
of k. But this is a matter of great difficulty in general. What is known as 
Mathieu’s equation, generally written in the form

of which the solutions are elliptic cylinder functions, is only a particular case 
of the general type (3) and it is the subject of an extensive literature. On

It follows that the action J round a closed orbit is greater than for any 
adjacent parallel curve when 0 is positive at every point. In this case the 
periodic orbit is in general stable. Similarly the action J is a real minimum 
when 0 is negative at every point. Then, as (3) shows, the periodic orbit is 
obviously unstable.
217. 
This remark is due to Prof. Whittaker, who has given another 
application of equation (5). The quantity K can be calculated for all points 
on a given curve. Now let K be negative everywhere along a simple closed 

216, 217] The Restricted Problem of Three Bodies 249
curve A. Then by (5) the value of J will be diminished when taken round 
another curve adjacent to and surrounding A. Again, let the quantity K be 
positive everywhere along another simple closed curve B external to A. The 
value of J will also be diminished when taken round a curve adjacent to and 
surrounded by B. Now consider the aggregate of all the simple closed curves 
which can be drawn in the ring-shaped space bounded by A and B. There 
must exist, if the space contains no singularity of fl, one of these curves 
which will give a smaller value of J than any other, and it cannot coincide 
with A or B for any part of its length. It represents therefore a periodic 
orbit characterized by the constant of energy C, and thus the existence of 
such an orbit is established when the two curves A and B can be found 
which satisfy the conditions stated. The orbit is necessarily unstable.
The same author has given another elegant theorem. By Green’s theorem
JJv2 (log v) 
= J (log v) dv~^ (log v)
where the first integral is taken over the area of a closed curve, and the second 
over its boundary. But if the curve is a trajectory, K = 0 and therefore

This assumes that the enclosed area contains no singularity of the integrand. 
But this function becomes infinite at the centres of attraction. Surround the 
mass p at (— Ci, 0) with a small circle of radius p. Then since
v2 = 2fl — C - 2/xpi-1
the integral round the circumference becomes
' L,(dvS-rd^')'OgV ’
= — 7T.

250 The Restricted Problem of Three Bodies [ch. xix
Similarly the corresponding integral round a small circle k2 surrounding the 
mass v tends to the same limit. Now if the outer boundary contains either 
of the attracting masses or both, the boundary integral must be diminished 
by subtracting the integrals taken round or k2 as the case may be. Hence 
the final result is
where j = 0, 1 or 2 according as the loop of the orbit contains neither or one 
or both of the attracting masses, 7 is the total angle through which the 
tangent to the orbit turns, and T is the time from one end of the loop to the 
other. In the case of a periodic orbit in the form of a single closed curve 
7 = 2?r.
218. 
The equations of relative motion are capable of a transformation 
which is very useful in some cases. This may be deduced from the intro­
duction of conjugate functions in a general form. Let the original equations be

d^v = (p + v)c sinh v — c2h sinh 2v.
Here the variables u, v are separated and the equations lead immediately to 
a solution in elliptic functions. The comparison of this problem with the 
simplest case of the problem of three bodies is instructive as to the difficulty 
of the latter.

CHAPTER XX

LUNAR THEORY I
220. The theory of the Moon’s motion relative to the Earth has been 
discussed with generally increasing elaboration and completeness by various 
authors from the time of Newton to the present day. The methods which 
have been employed also differ considerably, presenting peculiar advantages 
in different respects, so that it cannot be said definitely that any one method 
possesses an exclusive, claim to consideration. But at the present time three 
modes of treatment are certainly of outstanding importance, those adopted 
by Hansen, Delaunay and G. W. Hill respectively. Hansen’s theory was 
reduced to the form of tables by the author; these tables were published in 
1857 and are still in common use, but will shortly be superseded. Delaunay’s 
work took the form of an entirely algebraic development of the Moon’s motion 
as conditioned by the Earth and Sun alone. His theory has been completed 
by others and made the basis of tables recently published. Hill’s researches, 
which bear a certain relation to Euler’s memoir of 1772, deal only with 
particular parts of the theory, but the whole work on these lines has now 
been carried out systematically and completely by E. W. Brown and will 
form the foundation of a new set of lunar tables now in course of preparation.
Here it is only possible to attempt a slight sketch of one method. For 
this purpose Hill’s theory will be chosen, partly because it is destined to 
receive extensive practical application, and partly because it contains original 
features of the greatest theoretical interest. The reader who wishes to gain 
a comparative view of the different methods which have been used in the 
lunar theory will study Brown’s Lunar Theory and may also be referred to 
the third volume of Tisserand’s Mecanique Celeste.
221. Let the mass of the Earth be E, of the Moon M and of the Sun m', 
the unit being such that the gravitational constant G = 1. Let the origin of 
rectangular axes be E, (x, y, z) the coordinates of M and (x, y', z) the co­
ordinates of m'. Further, let r be the distance EM, r' the distance Eni, 
and A the distance Mm'. Then (§ 23) the forces on the Moon per unit mass 
relative to E can be derived from the force function

Now the Moon’s parallax is of the order lc, the solar parallax is of the 
order 9" and the ratio MjE is of the order 1/80. It follows that the second 
term in P/ is of the order IO-7 as compared with the first. It can be 
neglected, at least in the first instance. P/ is therefore reduced simply to 
the first term, and the meaning of this is that the motion of G about in', or 
of m’ about G, is the same as if the masses E and M were united at their 
centre of gravity.

This motion is elliptic and the coordinates (a^, ylt can be treated as 
known functions of the time according to undisturbed elliptic motion. The 
influence of the other planets is left out of account in the first instance and 
finally introduced in the form of small corrections. The first task, and the 
only one considered here, is to find an appropriate solution of the problem of 
three bodies, the problem being already so far simplified that the relative 
motion of the Sun and the centre of gravity of the Earth-Moon system is 
supposed known.
222. 
The force function F is expressed in terms of (x, y', z') and not the 
coordinates (xx, ylt zY) now supposed known. It is necessary to consider the 
effect of this. The ^-component of the Moon’s acceleration is

when r*  and A are expressed in terms of (xlt y1} zT) instead of (x, y, z).

and therefore in the expanded form
after suppressing m fr^. This is not the same as Flt but for practical 
purposes it can be brought into agreement by a simple device. Let a, a' be 
the mean values of r, v\. It is found that to a term of the series involving 
(r/rip’ correspond inequalities with the factor (a/a'y. If then
(E-M)al(E + M)a'
be substituted for a/a in the results which follow from the use of F2, they 
will be very nearly the same as if they had been derived by using Fu It 
may be left to the reader to examine the order of the chief outstanding dis­
crepancy after this treatment of F2. It is easy to make the adjustment exact.
223. Let the axis Ez be taken normal to the ecliptic and let EX, EY 
rotate in the ecliptic plane of {xy) with the Sun’s mean motion n'. The 
equations of motion of the Moon are then

Now if E-+ M= p., since n'2a'3 = m (more strictly m + ya),

Let if be the true longitude of the Sun and let if = e when t = 0. Then the 
Sun’s coordinates are
X’ = z-j cos {if — n't — e'), Y' = rx sin (t/ — nt — e\ z—6
the axis of X being always directed towards the Sun’s mean place. When 
the solar eccentricity is neglected and the Sun’s orbit treated as circular, 
/ = n't -f- e and = a', so that
X' = r. = a, Y' = z f 0, rS = {XX' + YY')/^ = X.
Hence when the solar parallax and eccentricity are both neglected
F2 = fir-1 + n'2 (f X2 — jr2) = fir-1 + n'2 (X2 — | Y2 — %z2)

and when, still further, the latitude of the Moon is ignored, the equations 
of motion become simply
X - 2n'F- 3n2X = - i*X/rh
Y+2n'X = -f>Y/r>\ ............................(1)
These two-dimensional equations represent the simplest problem bearing any 
real resemblance to the actual circumstances of the lunar theory. It is the 
degenerate case of the restricted problem of three bodies when the two 
finite masses are relatively at a very great distance apart and refers strictly 
to the motion of a satellite in the immediate neighbourhood of its primary. 
These equations have great importance in Hill’s theory.
Again, when the solar parallax alone is neglected, Fs may be written in 
the form
F. =

where the third term, which vanishes with the solar eccentricity, is a quadratic 
function in X, P, z. Thus
Z2 = 
+ n'2 (Z2 -1P2 - |* 2) - j (A 'Z2 + 2 H'X Y + B' P2 + C'z2)
where A', H', B, C' are functions of t to be derived from the elliptic motion 
of the Sun. The equations of motion now become
Z - 2n'P— 3n'2Z + A'X + H'Y= - ^Z/r3
P + 2n'Z + H’X + B'Y=- pY/r

and these are the foundation of the researches of Adams into the principal 
part of the motion of the lunar node.

equations of motion. Let

The kinetic energy of the Moon T is given by

= (u + n'tu) (s — n'is) + z2.

The equations of motion are therefore

Let

It is, however, convenient to separate from £l2 (accented for this reason) the 
part which is independent of the solar eccentricity. This is
O2' — H2 = m2 (3X2 — r2) = f m2 (u 4- s)2 — m2 (us 4- z2).

225. 
The next object is to transform the equations in u and s so as to 
remove the terms involving r~s. Since (§ 123)

and F2 contains terms involving t explicitly only in 11, in this case

or in the later notation
Du. Ds + (Dz'f + f m2 (u + s)2 - nr a2 + y = C - ft + D~' (Dt£l)
where C is a constant of integration, D~l is the inverse operator to D, and Dt 
represents the operator D applying to fl only in so far as fl contains t 
explicitly. This corresponds to the equation of energy.
Again, since r2 = us + z2, the equations of motion (2) give

The result of adding the last two equations is

This is one equation of the required form.
The other equations are obtained simply by eliminating the terms with 
r~3 as a factor between different pairs of the equations of motion. Thus 
from the first pair
D(uDs— sDu— 2mus) +|m2(w2 — s2)= s^~~

and when the third equation is used,

where with the upper sign W = 4 (u + s) and with the lower W = u — s. In 
this more symmetrical form the real and imaginary parts of u and s are 
clearly separated.
Equations in the form of (4) and (5) have two advantages. In the first 
place the left-hand members are homogeneous in u, s, z of the second degree. 
Except for the constant C this applies also to the right-hand members when 
the parallax of the Sun is neglected, and the parallactic terms need rarely be 
taken beyond the third and fourth degrees. In the second place, whereas 
X and Y can be expressed as trigonometrical series in terms of t, u and s 
can be expressed as algebraic (Laurent) series in terms of if, and such series 

225, 226]

can be more easily manipulated. Also if u = /(£), * = /(£-1) and therefore 
when either u or s has been calculated the other can be derived immediately.
226. The general method of the lunar theory, which is common to all 
forms, consists in choosing an intermediate orbit which bears some re­
semblance to the actual path of the Moon and in studying the variations 
which it must undergo in order that the path may be represented accurately 
and permanently. This intermediate orbit, since it merely serves as a subject 
for amendment, will naturally be chosen with a view to simplicity. At the 
same time, the more closely it represents the permanent features of the 
actual motion, the less burden will be thrown on the subsequent variations. 
Thus one might take the osculating elliptic orbit of the Moon about the 
Earth as the intermediary, neglecting the effect of the Sun altogether. The 
intermediate orbit adopted by Hill is called the variational curve and this 
must now be defined.
When the solar eccentricity (ez) and the solar parallax are neglected, 
fl = 0. Also, when the Moon’s latitude is neglected, z = 0. Equations (4) 
and (5) then become
Z>2 (us) — Du .Ds+2va (sDu — uDs) + f m2 (u + s)2 = C)
D(uDs — sDu — 2mus) 4- f m2 (u2 — s2) 
= 0)
which must be equivalent to (1), whence in fact they can be directly deduced. 
The constant k (or /z) has been eliminated and the constant C has been 
introduced. There must be a relation between them which can be found by 
reference to the original equations of motion. Hill’s variational curve is 
defined as that particular solution of (1) or (6) which represents a periodic 
orbit. Since the axes of reference rotate at the rate n the period of this 
orbit must be 27r/(n — n') where n is the mean motion of the Moon. From 
this it follows that the coordinates X, Y of the solution have this period and 
can be expressed in the form of Fourier series in (n — n')t, while u, s can 
be expressed in the form of Laurent series in £ The coefficients will be 
developed in powers of m, and this is an essential advantage of the method, 
since it is precisely this development which is less easy by the earlier 
methods. As a particular solution of the equations the symmetrical periodic 
orbit involves no arbitrary constants beyond those already introduced, namely 
n, which depends on the actual scale of the lunar orbit, and t0, which gives 
an arbitrary epoch corresponding with the fact that (6) do not involve the 
independent variable explicitly.
The existence of such periodic orbits is assumed. The question has been 
discussed analytically by Poincare (Methodes Nouvelles, Tome i), who has 
proved that they do exist in general. To some extent the assumption will 
be found practically justified by the results. But there is no doubt on the 
point. The periodic orbit in the actual circumstances could be found by the 
method of quadratures.

262

227. The assumption that the periodic orbit required is symmetrical 
about both axes at once limits the form of the expansions. For with this 
limitation X, Y must be of the form
X = X ^2i+1 cos (2? +1) £, Y = X A'^ sin (2z + 1) £, g=(n-n')(t- t0)

equal to 1, though retained for the sake of symmetry. Then, if m is a 
small quantity of the first order, ap is found to be of order |, being a 
function of m alone. This fact makes it possible to obtain the coefficients 
by a process of continued approximation, provided m is sufficiently small. 
The terms containing aoa2j, a0a_2J- in the last equations are obtained when 
i =j and i — 0, and they are respectively

and hence the rule for connecting the pair of equations corresponding to + j: 
in terms multiplied by [2j, 2i] change the signs of j and i throughout (both 
in coefficients and in suffixes); in the other terms write [— 2j, — ] for [2/, +] 
and [— 2j, +] for [2/, —], the suffixes being unchanged.
229. Since the coefficients [2J, +] are of the second order in m, the orders

Let the equations be written down so as to include all quantities of the sixth 
order (neglecting m8). This requires j = ± 1, + 2, + 3. The orders of the 
terms with the only .possible values of i are:
j=l, i=2(6, 10, 14), 1(2, 6, 10), 0(2, 2, 6), -1(6, 6, 6), -2(10, 10, 6)
j 2, i = 2 (4, 8, 16), 1 (4, 4, 12), 0 (4, 4, 8)
j = 3, i = 3 (6, 10, 22), 2 (6, 6, 18), 1 (6, 6, 14), 0 (6, 6, 10).
Hence the required equations are:
a0O2 = [2, 4] a2a4 4- [2, - 2] a_2a_4 4- [2, +] (2u2a_2 4- a02) 4- [2, -] (2a0a_4 4- a2-2) 
a0a_2 = [- 2, - 4] a_2a_4 4- [- 2, 2] a2a4 + [- 2, -] (2a, a_2 4- a02)
+ [- 2, 4-] (2a0a_4 4- aL.2) 
a0a4 = [4, 2] a2a_2 4- [4, 4-] 2a0a2
aoa^t = [— 4, — 2] a2a^ 4- [— 4, —] 2a0a2
a0a6 = [6, 4] a_2a4 4- [6, 2] a2a_4 4- [6, 4-] (2a0a4 4- a/)
a0a_6 = [- 6, - 4] a2a_4 4- [- 6, - 2] a_2a4 4- [- 6, -] (2a0a4 4- a/).
Thus, since a0 = 1, if m6 be neglected,
a2 = [2, 4-], a_2 = [- 2, -]
and then, neglecting m8,
a4 = [4, 2] [2, 4-] [- 2, -] + 2 [4, +] [2, +] 
a_4 = [- 4, - 2] [2, 4-] [- 2, -] 4- 2 [- 4, -] [2, 4-].
These values will give a6> a_6 as far as m9, and inserted on the right-hand 
side of the first pair of equations they give second approximations to a2, a~2 
of the same order. It is to be noticed that each stage of further develop­
ment carries an equation four orders higher.
The ratio of the mean motions of the Sun and Moon, and therefore the 
numerical value of m, is known with great accuracy from observation. Hill 
adopted the value
m = n'/(?i _ w') = 0 08084 89338 08312.
Hence it is practicable to introduce the numerical value of m from the 
beginning, and the approximation to great accuracy in the calculation of 
a±2,... is then extremely rapid by the above method. This is the process 
which has been adopted in the latest form of lunar theory. It is also possible 
by giving m other values to trace the development of the whole family of 
periodic orbits of lunar type. These orbits are of great theoretical interest, 
especially for larger values of m. But it is evident that the effect of the 
neglected parallactic terms will become more considerable, and such results 
may differ sensibly from true solutions of the restricted problem of three 
bodies. Also when m exceeds | the question of convergence begins to in­
troduce practical difficulties and the method of quadratures, followed by 
Sir G. H. Darwin and others, becomes necessary.

To find the value of a recourse must be had to an equation of 
motion which has not been reduced to a homogeneous form in u, s. Since 
11 = z = 0 and r2 = us, the first of (2) becomes in the present case
(D2 4- 2mZ) +1 m2) u 4- f m2s = ku (us) ~ *

This equation must hold for all values of £ including £ = 1. Then ?/=s=aSa2i, 
and therefore
a S {(2z 4-14- m)2 4- 2m2} 
= /ca~2 (2 OztT2.
But (§ 224) k = p. (n — ri)~2 = /z (1 4- m)2 n~2, so that
n2a3 = fi (1 4- m)2 (S a^)~2 [S }(2t 4-14- m)2 4- 2m2} a^]-1........(11)
It has been usual to write n2a3 = p, a being the mean distance which would 
correspond to the mean motion n in the absence of solar or other perturba­
tions. Thus a = a (1 4- powers of m) when the values of are inserted. 
The precise form of this relation is required only when it is desired to 
compare two theories expressed in terms of a and a respectively. The con­
stant a fixes the scale of the orbit and therefore depends on the parallax, 
which is observed directly.
When the coefficients and a have been determined, (8) gives the 
value of C, if it be required.

r sin (v — nt — e) = a { 
(a2 - a_2)sin 2£+ (a4 — (z_4)sin 4£ 4- ...}J
which lead to the determination of r and v, the more simply because v — nt — e 
is evidently of the second order in m.

The index k is arbitrary. It may be proved that if k is an odd integer

if k is an even integer the orbit is completed in %k circuits and is sym­
metrical about the axis of p only. For Hill’s variational curve k= 1.
The substitution of the assumed series in the equations leads to three 
series of equations which must be solved by continued approximation as in

Hill’s method. A most interesting result is that the series for e converges 
with exceptional rapidity, so that the equation
r~3 = c0 + 2c2 cos 2Z
where c0 = 93c.2 nearly, represents the variational curve with an error which 
on the scale of the lunar orbit is no more than half a mile. No simpler idea 
of the nature of this curve could possibly be given.
It may be left as an exercise to the student to fill in the details of the 
outline conveyed in this section

232. The method by which the variational curve can be determined 
with any required degree of accuracy has been fully explained. But it must 
not be supposed that this curve represents the lunar orbit in any true sense. 
It is merely a particular solution of equations which are themselves only 
a degenerate form of those which characterize the Moon’s motion, and the 
only significant parameter involved is the mean motion of the Moon. The 
next step is to seek the form of the general solution of the same equations. 
With this object it is necessary to study the variation of the particular 
solution and to determine a fundamental quantity c.

each row being divided by such a factor that the constituent in the leading 
diagonal becomes 1 when c = 0. This is Hill’s celebrated determinant, 
which introduced the consideration of the meaning and convergence
*
 of 
determinants of infinite order into mathematical analysis.
234. The determinant A (—c) = A(c), for the change only reverses the 
order of the constituents in the leading diagonal. Also A (c 4- 2y) = A (c), 
for the displacement of the leading diagonal along itself may be compensated 
by moving the divisors of the rows. Hence if c0 is a root of A (c), + c0 4- 2y 
are also roots. The highest power of c in the development is given by the 
product of terms in the leading diagonal, and this product is

for this contains the right number of roots, the same as Ao (c), and the same 
coefficient of the highest power of c. The roots are those already found, and 
there are no others. But this equation shows that
A (0) = (1 — COS 7FCo)/(l — COS 7T V©o)
and therefore c0 is a root of

The solution of A(c) = 0 is thus reduced to the calculation of A(0). The 
latter determinant is convergent if 2;©; is convergent, and this may be 
assumed for sufficiently small values of m.
As a matter of fact in the present case A (0) is not only convergent but 
very rapidly convergent. It may be written in the form
A(0)=.................. ....................... ...................
1 , , -&©2 , ..................

-&-3©i,

where
&-=l/(4j2-©0).
Suppose every ©j to be multiplied by 0j. If then the sign of 0 be changed 
the sign , of every alternate constituent in every row and every column is 
changed. Multiply every alternate row and every alternate column by — 1 
and the original determinant is restored. This involves multiplication of 
A (0, — 0) by an even power of — 1, since the number of rows and columns is 
equal. Hence A (0, — 0) = A (0, 0), and A (0, 0) is an even function of 0. 
But the power of 0 in any term of the development of A (0, 0) is the sum of 
the suffixes of the ©j associated with it. Therefore the sum of the suffixes 
in any term of the development of A (0) is even. Since ©y is of the order 
, 2j J in m, this means that the order of every term is a multiple of 4.
It is evident that the determinant A (0) must be developed axially, the 
term of zero order, 1, coming from the leading diagonal alone. There can 
be no term in ©j alone, for ©j incapacitates by its row and column two units 
from the leading diagonal as cofactors. Similarly a product ©t ©j incapaci­
tates more than two such units unless their rows and columns intersect on 
the leading diagonal. Thus i =j and the only terms of binary type involve 
squares.
235. The mode of developing A (0) will be sufficiently understood if m12 
be neglected. The sum of the suffixes can only be 0, 2 or 4. Hence the 
only possible terms are of the type
A (0) = 1 4- A©/ + £©22 4- 0©?©, 4- D©/.
It is also easy to see how each of these terms arises. Thus

The other coefficients can be calculated similarly by first reducing to the 
form of partial fractions. Hill’s results include all terms of order less than 
16, and with the value of m already given (§ 229) he obtained the value
c0= 1 07158 32774 16012.
Without going further than the term of which the form has actually been 
found here,
A (0) = 1 + Itt©/ cot >7rV®o/(l - ®o) V®o ................(17)
The argument given above as to the order of the terms refers to 0j, ®2, ... 
and not to effects arising from 0O. But 1 — 0O is itself of the first order, 
and therefore this expression neglects m7 instead of m8. Since m = 0’08 the 
error in c0 might be expected to occur at about the seventh decimal place, 
and in fact it is about 5 units in this place. This simple expression, involving 
only ®0 and ®i, is therefore veiy approximate.
It may be noticed that + tc (n — n) are the characteristic exponents of 
the variational curve. Since c is real this curve represents a stable orbit for 
small variations.

236. The introduction of the eliminant of infinite order was a bold and 
original expedient on the part of Hill, though justified later by analysis. 
But an analogous method had been used earlier by Adams, whose results 
were published after the appearance of Hill’s. They refer to the integration 
of the third equation of (2) when fl = 0, or
D2z — z (jcr~3 + m2) = 0.
If z be neglected in the coefficient of z, that is in r-3, the series already used 
in § 232 may be inserted, and the equation becomes
D2z = (2^M^2i)z
i
which, since Mi = is of the order | 2i | in m, is of exactly the same form 
as (15). A solution is known to be of the type
z=^^
i
and g must be determined from the infinite set
fy (g + ty? = Si
Hence the eliminant is A' (g) = 0, and the solution is given by
sin2 |7Tg0 = A' (0) sin2 |tt \f(2M0)
where A'(0) is the result of replacing by 2Mi in A (0).
Adams used the value m = n'/n = 0 0748013 exactly, which is not quite 
the same as Hill’s value. He thus obtained the corresponding numbers
m = 0-08084 89030 51852, g0 = 1 08517 13927 46869.

237. It is now necessary to consider the form of the general solution of 
the equations (6); in the present chapter equations will receive reference 
numbers in continuation of those assigned in the previous chapter, so that 
the latter will suffice without referring specifically to the chapter or section 
in which they occur. The solution of (15) may now be written
8X = £±c Sb^, log £ = i (n - n) (t -tj.
The arbitrary constant ij makes it possible to assign any required phase to 
the variation in relation to the periodic solution and as 8N is supposed small 
(so that 31V2 has been neglected) the coefficients bt may be considered to 
have a small arbitrary factor. These two arbitraries make the small variation 
otherwise general. Since c has been determined it would clearly be possible 
to determine real values of the coefficients (except for the arbitrary factor) 
by substituting the series in (15), equating coefficients, and proceeding by 
continued approximation.
Again, if 8a be the displacement in arc corresponding to 8N, by (2) of 
§214 adapted to the present notation,
or (§ 232)

Hence, V being an even function of t8a has the same form as 8N. But 
since
V cos = X, V sin = Y
V = iv Du, Ve~ = w Ds 
and
8N = 8X sin i/r — 3Pcos = (8u. e-1* — 3s. e^)
8a = 8X cos i/r + 31rsin i/r = | (8u . e~"1' + 3s . e1*)  
it follows that

Hence 3u, 3s, like Du, Ds, are odd functions in £ with real coefficients, and it 
is possible to write
3u = ?3s =
i 
i
the coefficients as expressed being the same in the two series since 3u + 3s = 23X 
is real. For the purpose of this argument it is necessary to associate the + c 
solution for 3u with the — c solution for 3s, and to notice that (ti/t)±c are 
constant conjugate imaginaries with absolute value 1 which have been re­
garded as external factors of the series with real coefficients for 3 A, ila, 8u 
and 3s. At the same time 3u — 3s is a pure imaginary.
Hence the general solution of (6), differing but little from the variational 
curve, may be written
w = a £X X A.2i+pC g8* 
s = a f 1X X A_2j__pC f2* £ZC
ip 
ip
where i has all integral values between + oo and p has the values 0 and + 1. 
Also A2i = a^t as in the variational curve and c is a determined function of m 
which has been denoted by c0.
238. But the solution which is now sought differs by a finite amount 
from the variational curve. The above form must therefore be regarded 
merely as the beginning of the full development. Hence the restriction on 
p will now be withdrawn and its values will be allowed to range between 
+ oo. The coefficients of the first order A^c contain a small arbitrary para­
meter e and the higher coefficients will be obtained by successive 
approximation in the ordinary way, so that A.2i±pc will be of the order | p | 
in e. The introduction of e into the solution will affect both A2j and c, and 
Uai and c0 represent those parts only which are functions of m alone and not 
of e.
It is assumed that this process will produce convergent series. If they 
converge they are true solutions of the differential equations, and not other­
wise. This recurrent question in dynamical astronomy cannot be dealt with 
here. But the reader must realize its fundamental importance, and he will 
understand why so much attention has been given, by Poincare especially, to 
discussions of this kind, although they may seem unproductive of new and 
striking results.
It is now to be noticed that
D (^+1 £?c) = (27 + 1 +pc) fr*
5, D^+p0 = (2i + 1 +pc) ^+1+2^ 
and therefore that the result of putting & = £ will affect in no way the pro­
cess of calculating the coefficients. If this substitution is made it is only 
necessary to retain c explicitly in the index of £ and to remember that the 
argument of the trigonometrical term corresponding to £2i+1+2’c is
(2i + 1) (n - n') (t - £0) +pc (n — n) (t — ti).

With this understanding the form of solution becomes

been given with (10), [2J + qc, 2j+<?c] = —1 is the coefficient of d0d2j+9C, 
and [2J + qc, 0] = 0 is the coefficient of A0A^j-qc- The counterpart of (8) is

239. Of the first importance are the terms which depend on the first 
power of the parameter e. When §N2 was neglected was identical with 
a^, and therefore A^ = a.2i when e2 is neglected. Let
■doi-j-C = e€i, dgi—c — 
.
The limitation to the first order in e means a return to the equations at the 
end of § 237 and the only admissible values of q are + 1. With either value 
p must be chosen so that c occurs only once in the suffixes of any term, or 
terms involving e2 will be introduced. Hence (19) gives
S {[2J + c, 2i + c] a^+^ei + [2j + c, 2i] a^e'-j+i

are thus obtained. Since the numerical value of m is introduced from the 
outset and c has been determined, the coefficients of €t, e/ are numbers, which 
in general become rapidly smaller at a distance from the central term. The 
equations can therefore be solved by continued approximation. As they 
determine the ratios only of e/, it is possible to put
€0 — €0' = 1, €( = bi €0 + 
€0', €{ = bi €0 + 
€0'.
The equations for j= ± 1, + 2,... will then serve to determine the coefficients 
bi, b/, &, where 60 = /30' = 1, /30 = b0' = 0. For j = 0,

with a similar equation obtained by changing the sign of c and interchanging 
e. e. Either of these two equations, with e0— e0'= 1, determines e0 and €0', 
and hence ef, e/ in general. The two must lead to the same result, and 
together are merely a check on the value of c, which, had it not been deter­
mined otherwise, could in theory be deduced from the whole set of these 
equations.
240. Before continuing the development of a method the whole aim of 
which is a systematic advance towards great accuracy in the complete results, 
and which is therefore apt to obscure the main features of the actual motion 
of the Moon, it will be well to consider the kind of results which have already 
been obtained implicitly or can be readily deduced. For this purpose a low 
order of approximation must be adopted and m4 will be neglected. Then it

= l + m + fm2 — ffm3 = 108521.
The numerical value of g0, corresponding to m = 0’08085, is much nearer the 
truth than that of c0. Also it follows from (11) that
a = a (1 — |m2 + |m3).

239-241] 
Lunar Theory II

Then (12) give
r cos (v — nt — e) = a {1 — (m2 + |ms) cos 2£}
r sin (v — nt — e) = a (’/m2 + VO s^n 
whence
v = nt + e + (^-m2 + JO s’n 
r = a {1 — |m2 + | m3 — (m2 + |m3) cos 2£}.
Terms depending on m only are called variational terms. The coefficient of 
the principal term of the variation in longitude is thus
Vm2 + Vm3 = 0-01013 = 2090"
which is some 16" in defect of the true value. This term was discovered 
observationally by Tycho Brahe, and its period, indicated by 2£ (or 2D in 
Delaunay’s notation), is half a synodic month.
241. 
The equations (20) for y=±l, when the leading terms only are 
retained, become simply
ex = {[2 + c, c] a_2 + 2 [2 + c, +]} e0 + [2 + c, 2] a2e0'
€-i = [- 2 + c, c] a2 €0 + {[- 2 + c, - 2] a_2 + 2 [- 2 + c, -I e0'
e/ = [2 - c, 2] a2 e0 + {[2 - c, - c] a_2 + 2 [2 - c, +]} e0'
e -i = {[— 2 — c, — 2] a_2 + 2 [— 2 - c, — ] ■ e„ + [— 2 — c, — c] a>ej.
It is to be noticed that [a?, y], [a?, +] contain as a divisor
Dx = 2a?2 — 2 — 4m + m2
and that this has the factor m when + a? = 2 — c. It is easily found that
[2 + c, c] = -/?, [2 + c, 2] = -f, [2 + c, +] = T^m2
[—2 —c, — c] = — 
[—2 — c, — 2] = — ||, [-2-c,-] = -^m2
[—2+ c, c] = f m-1 + ff, [—2 + c, — 2] = f m-1 +-^
[- 2 + c, -] = m + ffgm2, [2 - c, +] = - |fm - ff|m2
[2-c, 2] = -|m-1-ff, [2 — c, — c] = — |m-1 — T7^
as far as the present low order of approximation requires. Hence with the 
approximate values of a2, a_2,
ei = T2Bm2e0 — i-2s,n'2eo/
e-i = G&m + iffm2) e0 + (^m + -WO
e/ = - (Am + ft|ms) e0 - (Alm + WO
€—1 = — ■^gnl2eo — Tfsm2eo •
It has been seen how the order of e_1} e/ is lowered by the divisor Dx. 
A similar circumstance affects the coefficients of (21) more seriously, since
Dc = 2c2 — 2 — 4m + m2 = — ^|^m3.

278 
Lunar Theory TI 
[ch. xxi
The disappearance of the terms below m3 explains why an extremely accurate 
value of c is required in the numerical development. Without continuing 
the series for c beyond m3, Dc is heje limited to a single term, and therefore 
only the terms of the very lowest order in (21) can be taken into account. 
This equation is thus reduced to
[c, 2] a2ei - €0 + [c, - 2 + c] a_2e-i + 2 [c, +] aoe-i = 0 
where
[c, 2] = [c, - 2 + c] = - ^m-3, [c, +] = - ^m-|
Hence
75 (A e0 + 
€o) — eo + (A95 ~ Ts) (A e0 + Vr €<>) = 0
which gives quite simply 3e0 + e0' = 0, and with e0 — e0' = 1, e0 = {, e0' = — f. 
These values, though representing only the terms of zero order in m, are true 
within 1 per cent. It follows that
ei = Am2> e-i = “ 
“ fffm2
e/ = m 4- f|jm2,' 
m2
where, owing to the imperfect values of e0, e0', the second terms in e_1; e/ may 
also be defective.
242. 
The terms thus found in (18) are 
u = aef (eor 4- 4- 
4-
s = aef-1 
+ e,?-2"0 + 
4- e/f"2^ 4- e'-^0)
to which correspond (§ 230)
rcos(i> — nt — e) = ae {(e0 + e0')cos ^>+(e14- €'_!)cos(2£ 4- ^>)4-(e1/4-c_1)cos(2^—<}>)} 
rsin(v - nt — e) - ae{(e0 — e0')sin — €/_1)sin(2^4- ^)4-(e/—e_!)sin(2^—^>)} 
where
<f> = c (n — n')j(t — tj)
is the argument of the trigonometrical term corresponding to fc. These 
terms are additive to the variational terms already obtained.
The fundamental terms are
r cos (v — nt — e) = a (1 — |e cos ^>) 
r sin (v — nt — e) = ae sin <£.
Now in elliptic motion (24) and (25) of Chapter IV give, to the first order 
in e,
r cos w = a (— fe 4- cos M 4- 
cos 2 M)
r sin w = a ( 
sin M 4- sin 271/)
whence
r cos (w — M) = a (1 — e cos 71/)
r sin (w — J/) = 2ae sin M.

241-243] 
Lunar Theory II 
279
These can be identified with the former by putting a = a, e = 2e, $ = M, and 
v = nt + e + w — M
= w + [n — c(n — n')} t + e + c(n — n)Z, 
= w + {1 — c/(l 4-m)| nt + const.
This shows that to this extent the motion of the Moon is purely elliptic, with 
eccentricity j e, but that this motion is referred to a line rotating uniformly, 
given by
v0 = {1 - c/(l + m)} nt = (| m2 4- V/m3 +...) nt.
Thus c determines the motion of the lunar perigee, which completes a revolu­
tion in the direct sense in rather less than 9 years. The above approximation 
gives 128 sidereal months or 3500 days.
In the older lunar theories, beginning with Clairaut, the rotating elliptic 
orbit is adopted in the first approximation.
243. 
The result of collecting the terms found so far as necessary is
r cos (v — nt — e) = a [1 — m2 cos 2£ — Je cos </>
— m + -’f^-m2)e cos (2f — </>) 4- ^m2e cos (2£ 4- </>)}
r sin (v — nt — e) = a l^m2 sin 2£ 4- e sin </>
4- (J8-m + Vrn2) e sin (-? — </>) + /?ni2e sin (2£ 4- </>)}-
The effect of dividing the latter by the former is to add to the second series 
the terms
m2e (cos 2£ sin </> 4- |f sin 2£ cos </>) = m2e 
sin (2£ + </>) — ^ sin (2£ — </>)}.
Hence the longitude is approximately
v = nt + e + Vm2 s^n 2£ 4- e sin </>
4- (-lg5-m + ^°2-m2) e sin (2£ —</>) + |f m2e sin (2£ 4- </>).
As a constant of integration introduced at one stage of the present 
method, e may be defined in any suitable way for the later stages. Its 
value depends on the exact definition adopted and will be found by com­
paring the final results with observation. Thus |e as defined by Brown is 
not to be identified with the e of Delaunay, for example. The difference is 
not great, however, and its value may be taken to be 0’0549. Thus the co­
efficient of the principal elliptic term in longitude, e sin </>, is of the order 6 °’3.
The term next in importance has the argument 2£ — </> (or 2D — Z in 
Delaunay’s notation). The coefficient is right to the order given, though the 
above derivation left this doubtful, and its value gives
(|fm 4- %°^m2) e = 73' nearly.
The true coefficient, depending on e alone, is 4608". This inequality is 
the largest true perturbation in the Moon’s motion and is known as the 
Evection. Its discovery from observation is due to Ptolemy.

280 
Lunar Theory II 
[ch. xxi
The term with the argument 2£ + 0 (or 2D + I) is much smaller. The 
above coefficient gives 157", while the true value is about 175" for the part 
depending on e alone. It will be noticed that the greater part of it is 
due not to a true perturbation in the rectangular coordinates but to inter­
ference between the variation and the principal elliptic term in deriving the 
longitude.
244. The terms depending on the first power of the solar eccentricity e' 
will be next considered. With z = 0 and the solar parallax still neglected, 
12 = fl2 and (4), (5) become
D2(ws) — Du. Ds + 2m (sDu — uDs) + f m2(u + s)2 = C — 3 £ >2 + D-1 (Dt£l>)
D (uDs — sDu — 2mus) + jm2 (zt2 — s2) 
= s — u
where (3) gives
fl2 = m2 (3r2S2 — r2) — |m2 (3 (u + s)2 — 4us}.
Now
rS = (XX' + YY') r^1 = | (u + s) cos (u — s) sin % 
where (§ 223) 
= v' — n't — e = v — 0' is the solar equation of the centre.
Hence
r2S2 = | (u2 + .s'2) cos 2%' + I us - 
(u2 — s2) sin 2%
and therefore
fla = m2 {f (u2 + .s2) cos 2% + %us — ft (u2 — s2) sin 2%} — |m2 (3zz2 + 3s2 + 2us)
where u, s have the values given by the variational curve. The Sun’s mean 
anomaly is
<!> =n'(t- t3) = m (n - n') (t-t3) = -i log £3m.
The whole disturbing function must ultimately be developed in powers of 
as far as necessary, the coefficients involving u, s, a'"1 and e'. But for the 
immediate purpose it is easily verified that to the first order in e',
^5 = —3cos 2/ = 1 + 8e'cos 0'> 
sin 2/ = 4e' sin <£'.
Hence
=f mV {«• (- if,”+if,-”) + s’ W - ife-”)+MS (&” + &-”))
A!is -1mV {u’ (- 
- if,-”) + s*(if,
” + if,-”) + ms (f,” - f,-”)).
Thus the right-hand members of the equations at the beginning of this 
section will be of the form
a?e"S.Est+l,mp^, 
for, as in § 238, the suffix of %3 may be suppressed in the calculation with the 
proper understanding as to the argument corresponding to in the results. 
The solution is of the form
u = 
s =
ip 
ip

243-245] 
Lunar Theory II 
281
where
A-2i ~ fyn.} ^21+m = ® Vi > -d 2i—m = ® Vi
and p has the values 0, + 1 only, until higher powers of e are taken into 
account. The solution follows the same course as in § 239 except that there 
are now terms on the right-hand side of the equations. The equations of 
condition corresponding to (20) are thus
S {L2.7 + In> 2* + m] «-2j+2i Vi + [2j + 
2* + 2j]
+ 2 [2/ + m, +]tt2j—21—27/i + 2 [2j4-m, ]U—^j—zi—2Vi} ~ 
2j+m-
This form results from the linear combination of a pair of equations obtained 
by comparing coefficients of ^+In and in these the leading terms by analogy 
with (9) are respectively
... + [4/2 + 2/ +1 + 4m (/ +1) + gm2} aoe%
+ {V2 “ 2/ + 1 - 4m (j -1) + gm2} 
+ ... = e'J?2j+m
... - 4/(1 + j + m} a^e'rjj - 4/ (1 -j' + m) aoe'rf_j + ... = e'E'2j+m 
where j' is written for j + jm. The combination is such that the coefficient 
of 7)-j vanishes and that of becomes — 1. Hence
™ 
= 4/ (1 
+ m) #2j+m + [4/2 - 2/ +1 - 4m (/ - I) + gm2} ^+m
2;+m 
4p (8/2 - 2 - 4m + m2)
The divisor, which appears also in the symbolical coefficients [ ], becomes 
small only through the factor/, when j = 0, 4/2 = m2.
245. The calculation of ty, rj- when m is given its numerical value at 
the outset, proceeds as in the case of e,-, e/ with this difference, that the 
equations, con tain definite right-hand members. A particular solution of the 
differential equations is required, representing a forced disturbance of the 
steady variational motion. Hence no new constant of integration enters.
The machinery is of course absurdly elaborate when only the main parts 
of the leading terms are sought, but this plan will be pursued. It is easily 
found that
= lm2e'a2 {- j (r+m 4- 
+ i (£2-m + ?“2+,n) + (1 + 6a_2) (£m 4- £-“)}
with the neglect of m in the coefficients of ^±2^in, but not £±m. The operator 
Dt applies to £±m only and gives a multiplier + m to every term, while the 
operator Z)-1 applies to t, generally and gives divisors + 2 + m or + m. Hence 
to the same order in m
D~l (Dtfl2) = fm2e'a2 {(1 4- 6a_2) (£“ + ?-“)}.
Also
« 
- u ~ = gm2e'a2 (| (£2+m - £~2~,n) -g (£2-m - t~2+m) + 8a^ (£m - £~m)}
OS vU

282

[ch. xxi
Hence
Em = .D_m = - :]m2 (1 4- 6a_2), En' = - E'm = 12m2a_2
E^' = (- m-1 + f) Dm - jm-2Dm' = f m 4- ^rn2
D"_m = (m-1 - |) E_n - %va~
*E'_
m = - 3m _ 5gLm2.
Thus t/o, ^o' must be of the first order in m and give rise to terms of at least 
the third order in the equations for j = + 1. These contain no small divisor 
and for the lowest order they give immediately:
~V1 — E 2+m = ^E 2+m = m2
~~ Vi — E 2—w = iE 2—m = — || m2
~ V—1 = E —2+m = — j E 2+m + E —2+m = 
n12
— V-i = E,,_jlr_va = — 
4- 274- E'_2_m - —||m2.
Coefficients of the form [m, y\ are of the order — 1 in m, but they multiply 
terms of at least the fourth order in the equations for j = 0. These give 
therefore to the second order
- Vo 
+ 2 [m> +] 
+ 2 [m, -] a^'^ = E"m
- Vo + 2 [~ m, +] 
+ 2 [- m. -] a^_, = E"_m
where
[m, +] = [—m, +] = -f, [m, -]=[-m, -] = f.
Accordingly
-77o = fm-fm2, -Vo= -fm + fm2.
Thus the principal terms depending on the solar eccentricity may be put 
in the form
r cos (v — nt — e)
= ae' {(t?0 +1]0') cos 4- (??! 4- 7] Li) cos (2£ 4- </>') 4- (97/ 4- cos (2£ — <]>')}
= ae' {I m2 cos </>' +1 m2 cos (2£ 4- </>') — |m2 cos (2£ — <}>')}
r sin (v —nt — e)
= ae' {(t)0 - Vo) sin </>' 4- (vi ~ V-i) sin (2£ 4- </>') 4- 
sin (2£ - </>')]
= ae' {— 3 (m — m2) sin 
— ||m2 sin (2£ + 
+ f|m2 sin (2£ — </>')}.
In deriving the longitude there are no interfering terras of this order, and 
the last line without a gives the additional terms depending on e'. The 
term with argument ^>' (or I') is called the Annual Equation after its period. 
The value of e is 0’01675 and the coefficient of this part of the term, 
— 3e' (m — m2), is — 770" as compared with the complete value — 659". For 
the argument 2£ —</>' (or 2D -=• I') the coefficient f|e'm2 is 4-109", the true 
value being 4-152", and for the argument 2^4- (or 2D 4-1') the coefficient 
— ||e'm2 is — 15" 5, the true value being — 21"
*6.
 The discrepancies are 
considerable and show that the parts depending on higher powers of m are 
large. As series in m the coefficients converge slowly, and hence the great 

245, 246]

advantage of the Hill-Brown method, which by employing an accurate 
numerical value of m from the beginning avoids expansions in this parameter 
altogether.
246. In deriving the terms with the characteristic a'-1 alone, e is neg­
lected and therefore fl2 = 0, Dt£l = 0, and
fl = fl3 = 2m2 a'-1 P3r3 = m2a'-1 (5?’\S3 — Sr’S) 
= |m2a'-1 [5 (u + s)3 — 12?/s (u + $)}
since rS = X = |(w + s) when e = 0. The terms on the right-hand side of 
(4), (5) are thus
— 4fl3 = — ^m2a'-1 {5 (w3 + s3) + Sus (u + $)} = a3a'-1

respectively. The additional terms required in the solution must be of the 
form
u = aV“> ^+1, s = a2a'-1 
£2i+1
in order to produce odd powers of £. Similarly fl4 has the factor a'-2 and 
gives rise to terms with the same arguments as the variational terms. The 
solution follows the same course as for the terms with characteristic e', and 
the relation connecting E"y+1 with E2j+1, E'2j+1 is the same as before when 
/ =J + I-
The principal terms are given by 2j +1 = + 1, + 3. The divisor D2/ is of 
the order m when j' = + | only. But fl3 contains m2 as a factor. Hence, 
when terms of the order m3 are neglected in E’2j+1, m2 can be neglected 
in m~2fl3 and the variational coefficients a2, a_2 are not required. Thus it is 
enough to write
- 4D3 = - j m2a3a'-1 [5 + f3) + 3 (£+ r1)}
«

and therefore

The equations for ax, a_x can be adapted from (21) and its correlative by 
putting c = l, e0 = e1' = ai and 
= cr^. To the second order in m
these give

whence
- & ma2 - «! + H*  ma-! - Vmot-i = if m + ill ™2
- a_i -

and therefore
- a, = m + ff m2, -a_1 = - ff m - -UgL m2.
The additional terms in their elementary form are thus
r cos (y - nt — e) = a2a/_] {(c^ + a_j) cos £ + («3 + a_3) cos 3£}

and the last line, divided by a, gives the corresponding terms in longitude. 
The mean parallax of the Sun is 8"
*80
 and of the Moon 3422"-7 ; to the 
above order a/a'= 0’002571. This gives — 114" for the coefficient of the 
first term (argument £ or D) and 1"6 for the coefficient of the second 
(argument 3£ or 3D), whereas the complete values, with the characteristic 
a/a' alone, are — 125" and under 1". The term with argument D is known 
as the Parallactic Inequality. Its period is one lunation (or synodic month) 
and the comparison of its theoretical coefficient with observation gave 
probably the best determination of the solar parallax until the direct geo­
metrical method based on the observation of minor planets was adopted. 
This use of the parallactic inequality is not entirely free from objection 
because the Moon cannot be observed throughout a complete lunation and 
systematic error may be suspected, due to the varying illumination of the 
lunar disc.
247. Hitherto the terms of u, s which are of the first order in the 
characteristics e, e, a a'-1 have alone been considered. If the third coordinate 
z be assumed to be of the first order the first two equations of (2) show that 
ut s contain in addition only terms of the second and higher orders. The 
third equation of (2) has already been considered in § 236, and when £1 is 
neglected terms in z of the first order are given by the equation
D2z = (2tMi^)z.
Let
7] = g(n- n) (i -12) = - t log
Then the general solution is of the form
tz = akS^ (^i+g -
where a preliminary value of g has been found in § 240 and k, t2 represent 
the two necessary arbitrary constants. As before the suffix of has been 
suppressed because it does not affect the calculation, though the proper 

246-248.] 
Lunar Theory II 
285
argument must be retained in the results. The coefficients ki are deter­
mined by equating terms in £9+g, so that
kj (2J + g)2 =
and it is possible to write k0 = 1.
In obtaining k^k-i to m2 only it is possible to neglect k2, k_2 and approxi­
mate values of J/o, 
have been found in § 240. Thus the equations
are
(2 + g)2^ = 2Mok1 +2^0
(2 - g)2 k^ = 2M0k_x + 2Jf_A 
where
(2 + g)2 - 2Mo = 8, (2 - g)2 - 2J/0 = - 4m - 3m2, 2MX = 2M_A = 3 m2 + if- m3.
Hence
k\ = T3(j m2, k_i = — | m —m2 
and to this order in m
= ak ?~g - Qm + j|m2) (g~^ - 
+ T%m2 (?+
*
 -
z = 2ak [sin + (jm + ||m2) sin (2£ — 77) + f^m2 sin (2£ + 77)}.
248. 
Here the fundamental term is
z = 2ak sin 77 = 2ak sin [g (n — n) (t — £2)}
and its general meaning is easily seen, though the exact definition of k must 
be adapted to the final approximation and then determined (like e) by direct 
comparison with observation. The maximum value of z is 2ak. But it is 
also approximately a tan I, a being the mean distance in the orbit projected 
on the plane of the ecliptic and I being the inclination of the orbit to this 
plane. Hence k is nearly | tan Z, and differs little from Delaunay’s y=sin|Z. 
Its provisional value may be taken to be 0’0448866 = 9260".
At a node z=0 and the period between successive returns to the same node 
is 27r/g(n — n'). In this time the mean motion in longitude is 27rn/g(n — n'). 
Hence the mean rate of change in the position of the node is
{27rn/g (n — n') — 2tt} 4- 2?r/g (n -n) = n — g (n — n')
= n {1 -g/(l +m)} = n(- fm2 + f|m3)
with the approximate value of g found in § 240. Since this expression is 
negative the lunar node has a retrogade motion and completes a circuit in 
6890 days or 18’9 years, which is reduced by about 100 days when the com­
plete value of g is used. These facts have an important bearing on the 
theory of eclipse cycles.
In deriving the elementary terms in latitude with the characteristic k it 
is enough to take from the variational solution
r = a (1 — m2 cos 2£)
and to the order m2 the latitude is
z\r = 2k {sin 77 + (|m + |jm2) sin (2g - 77) + i|m2 sin (2g + 77)}.

286 
Lunar Theory II 
[ch. xxi
The first term, with argument t] (or F in Delaunay’s notation) is the principal 
term in latitude. Its coefficient is 5° 8'. The second term, with argument 
2£ — 7] (or 2D — F), has been called the evection in latitude. Its coefficient 
as found above is 610"’6, the true value being 618/,’4. The third term, with 
argument 2£ + t] (or 2D + F) has the coefficient 83"

 as compared with the 
true value 94"'5.
249. 
It is now possible to sketch the whole method of the subsequent 
development. The greater part of the practical work of calculation has been 
based not on the homogeneous equations used above, which present advan­
tages in special cases (especially the calculation of long-period terms), but on 
the original equations (2),

It is unnecessary to use the equation in s because s =f(X~v) if w = 
'■> two
real equations are replaced by a single complex one. Also the characteristics 
entering into u and z are distinct. Hence the treatment of the equations in 
u and z is also distinct. The order of a characteristic is the sum of the 
positive powers of the parameters e, e', aa'-1, k which compose it: m is 
a mere number for this purpose, and retains its identity only in the argu­
ments. Now suppose that a complete solution u = ult s — s1, z = zY to the 
order /z in the characteristics has been obtained. The next step is to find 
the solution u = zq + zq, s=s!-|-s2, z = zx + ^2, where zq, s2> z2 represent the 
terms of order /n + 1. Insert these values in the equations, retaining only 
the first powers of iq, s2, z2. The result is, since r- = us + z2,
(D + m)2 (zq + zq) + | ni2 (zq + u.2 + 3sj + 3s2) — k (zq + zq) ?q_3

Now terms of order less than /z +1 must be satisfied identically and therefore 
terms linear in zq, z2 may be omitted. Also terms of order higher than 
p> + 1 can be neglected. Hence s2, z2 may be used in calculating fl, and 
in conjunction with zq, s2, z2 it is possible to write zq = zq, Si = s0, £i = 0, 
ri2 = zqs0 = p02, where zq, s0, £=0 is the variational solution of zero order. 
Hence the equations reduce to

where the terms with D have been retained on the right-hand side, though 
apparently of order not higher than p, for a reason to be explained later. 
For the moment they can be left out of sight.
250. Since the treatment of the two equations is separate but quite 
similar it will be enough to consider the first. It is convenient to write 
Wj = u0 4- Ui, s1=s0 + and to expand the term Ki^rf3 in terms of w/, $/, zlf 
rejecting the variational part fcu0p0~3 and the linear terms. The form of 
the known solution has been made sufficiently obvious, and it is clear that 
the right-hand side, when developed, will contain an aggregate of character­
istics X each of order p + 1 and each associated with one or more series. 
Each constituent part may be taken to be of the form
A = aX£2

where
t = ?,c4 q2m + q3g
qx, Q2, q3 having fixed integral values (positive or negative) in the series con­
sidered, while 2i may have odd integral values when aa'~! occurs in X.
The part of the solution required to satisfy this series is of the same form 
w2 = aX£S (Xl-t2?+T + XL^-21’"")
i
and Xj, X/ are to be found by inserting this expression in the equation. This 
may be written
(D 4- m)2 u2 4- Mzi2 4- jVs2£2= A 
where
M = jm2 4-|«p0~3 =271f^21’, N^~ = f m2 4- |«u02p0-5= ^2XNi^2i.
The series 717, in which = -M_;, has already occurred in the determination 
of c0 and g0. After substitution of the series for u.2, s2 comparison of the 
terms in ^’±(2>+T)+1 On both sides of the equation gives

This series of linear equations, in which the coefficients M,, Nt rapidly diminish, 
must then be solved by successive approximation. When this has been 
carried out for each series A and every characteristic X, all the terms of order 
p. 4-1 in u, s have been determined. The treatment of z is precisely similar.
251. But one important question clearly arises. Is the set of linear 
equations consistent and definite ? If the modulus of the set, which can be 
written as a symmetrical determinant of infinite order since 71/; = M_i} 
Ni = N_i} is not zero, the solution is certainly definite. This is the general 
case. But consider the determination of eit e/ the co-factors of the character­
istic e of the first order. By the above method these will be obtained from 
(23) by putting Aj = A'_j = 0 and r = c. The consistency of the equations 

288 
Lunar Theory II 
[ch. xxi
now requires the modulus to vanish. It is obvious that this condition in fact 
must lead to a determination of r which will be identical with the value of 
c0, though the latter was found above in a formally different way. When 
the equations have thus been made consistent the solution only becomes 
definite when the arbitrary condition e0 — e0' = 1 is added, and this condition 
is equivalent to a definition of e.
It is now evident that the modulus vanishes whenever t = c, or for every 
series based on the same argument as that of the principal elliptic term. 
The consistency of the linear equations requires a relation between the 
coefficients Ajf A/ which may be expressed by equating the modulus to zero 
after replacing any column in it by the series A); A/. But owing to the 
symmetry of the modulus this relation is capable of a much simpler form. 
Let the equations (23) be multiplied by €j, e_j and let the sum be taken for 
all values of j. Then the coefficient of X7 is
(2j + t + 1 + m)2 €j + 2 MiCj+i + XNi€_j+i = 0
because, since 
— 
this is one of the equations of
condition. Similarly all the coefficients on the left-hand side vanish, and 
the required relation appears in the form
0 = S(4e,-ML/_,).................................... (24)
3
The reason for retaining the terms (D2 + 2mD) in (22) will now be under­
stood. Without them there is no reason why the relation (24) should be 
satisfied, and in fact it will be contradicted. But let contain terms of the 
form
(Wl)=^(^r£+c+^-ir2i-c)
(Z> + 2mD) (W1) = 
{[c2 + 2c (2a + 1 + m)] Ei^
+ [c2 + 2c (2a -1 - m)]
where terms obviously of order less than /a + 1 are omitted. Then clearly, if 
the value of c here be regarded as unknown, it will be possible to adjust its 
value so as to satisfy the relation (24).
252. The matter is made clearer by considering the actual facts. In the 
first order there is one such series, with the coefficients €i, In the second 
order there is no such series and the question does not arise. The primitive 
value c0 suffices. In the third order series of this type reappear, associated 
with the characteristics e3, ee'2, ek2, e (aa'-1)2. The contemplated change in c 
is associated with e through the first order terms. Hence the relation (24) 
in the third order will give in succession the parts of c which contain 
e2, e'2, k2 and (a a'-1)2. Similarly still higher parts of c may be found in con­
junction with the inequalities of a higher order. It is natural that the 
motion of the perigee (and the value of the characteristic exponent) which 
was determined for highly simplified conditions, should require adjustment 

251-253] 
Lunar Theory II 
289
when the conditions are more complicated and the deviation from the periodic 
orbit is no longer infinitely small.
For c let Cj4- Xz3c be written, where X'3c is the part to be determined, its 
characteristic being X', and let
Aj = Bj 4- Dj8c, A'_j = B'_j 4-
where Bj, B'-j, Dj, D'_j are calculated numbers. With the new value of c the 
quantities Ajt A'_j satisfy a certain relation identically as required, and the 
equations (23) become consistent, but the solution is not definite because any 
one of the equations can be derived from the rest. An arbitrary condition 
can be imposed, and the form X/ = Xo is chosen. The solution is then con­
ducted in the following way.
The equations for j=0 are left aside. Three separate solutions are then 
made of the remaining equations: (1) Xj=fy, Xz_j = 6'_j when Xo = Xo' = O 
and Aj = Bj, A'_j = B'_j; (2) X7 = dj, X'_j = d'_j when Xo = Xoz=O and Aj=Dj, 
A,_j = D,_j', and (3) \=fj, X'-j=f'_j when Xo=X0' = l and Aj = A'_j = 0. 
The last, which under the different condition Xo — Xo' = 1 would have led to 
€j, e_j, is independent of Aj, A'_j and applies in all cases. The complete 
solution is therefore
Xj = bj + djbc + fj\>, X _j = b _j 4- d —jbc 4- f’—j\0.
When these are inserted in the equations for J = 0 the result is of the form
b0 4- d08c 4- /0X0 = b0' + d0'bc 4- fo^o = 0
and Sc and Xo are thus determined. The value of Sc must also satisfy the 
relation (24), so that a check on the accuracy of the work is provided. The 
solution of the equations (23) for the case when t = c is therefore complete, 
and the derivation of the higher parts of c has been explained. It may be 
noted that on the left-hand side of these equations the primitive value c0 is 
to be retained for r at every stage, both because it is associated with terms of 
the full order /z 4-1 and because the theory of the equations depends on the 
fact that the modulus vanishes. On the other side c will receive its full 
value so far as it has been determined. When a new part of c comes to be 
determined in conjunction with inequalities having the characteristic X, 3c is 
always associated through (D2 4- 2mD) (i/j) with the terms in ux of the first 
order in e. Hence the new part of c itself always has the characteristic 
Xz = e-1X, and the numbers dj, d'_j, like fj,f_j, are the same in all cases.
253. With the equation for z matters follow a precisely similar course, 
and the exceptional case arises when r = g. The conditions are simpler, 
because Xj 4- Xz_j = 0 always, and therefore the arbitrary relation has the 
form Xo = Xoz = 0. The terms of the first order with suitable arguments have 
the characteristic k, and the part of g found in conjunction with inequalities 
having the characteristic X contains the characteristic k-1X.

The arbitrary condition X0 = X0' adopted in all cases has an importance 
beyond that apparent in the actual calculation. The aggregate of the terms 
considered up to the final stage of approximation gives for the one argument
u = ae£(e0£c + 
+ a£(£c + f0) SXX0
s = aer1 (fot“c 4- eo'D + af"1 (r + Sxxo 
ae (e0 - e0') (£c - f-c).
The last expression remains unaltered throughout the course of the approxi­
mations. Hence the constant e is defined as “ the coefficient of a sin I in 
the final expression of p sin (v — nt — e) as a sum of periodic terms, where 
v — nt — e is the difference of the true and mean longitudes and p is the 
projection of the Moon’s radius vector on the plane of reference.”
Similarly the terms of the form
= ak&0 (£g — £-g)
in the first approximation have no addition made to them subsequently, 
since Xo = X/ = 0. Hence the constant k is defined as “ the coefficient of 
2a sin F in the (final) expression of z as a sum of periodic terms.”
There is no reason to alter the definition of a, which is based on the 
variational curve. But it is then to be noticed that the constant of distance 
in the projection on the z plane will no longer be aa0, where a0 = 1, but will 
be affected by terms with various characteristics which arise in the course of 
the approximations as the constant parts of or Either m or a, since 
they are connected by a certain relation (11), maybe regarded as an arbitrary 
constant of the solution.
The remaining three arbitraries have been denoted by £0, tx, t2. These 
may be replaced by e, w, 0, the mean longitudes of the Moon and its perigee 
and node at the epoch t = 0. Then
D = (n — n') (t — t0)= (n—n)t+€ — e
I = c (n — n) (t — Q = c (n — n)t+ e -w- 
I' = m (n — n') (t — ts) = nt + e' — ot' 
F = g (n - n') (t - t2) = g (n — n') t + e — 0 
where e is the mean longitude of the Sun at the epoch t = 0 and nr' is the 
(constant) longitude of the solar perigee. The time ts is not an arbitrary: it 
depends on the Sun alone and is one of the data of the problem.
The formulae for transformation to polar coordinates were given in § 230 
for two dimensions only. It is necessary to replac'd r by p, its projection on 
the plane of the ecliptic, where p2 = X2 + Y2 = us. Then
u^1 — p exp. i (v — nt — e)
= p exp. — t (v — nt — e)

The constant of the Moon’s horizontal equatorial parallax is based on «, 
where n2a3 = E + M. To obtain the parallax at any time this constant must 
be multiplied by

r ~ a * \ a2 J

In these expressions for v, <f> and ar~' the variational parts n0, s0 are separated 
from the other terms z, and the expressions are then expanded in terms 
of the latter. Advantage can thus be taken of the expansions already obtained 
in the course of the previous work. The conversion to the final form of 
coordinates therefore entails no great amount of extra labour.
254. This completes in outline the solution of the main part of the 
problem, in which the Earth, Moon and Sun are treated as centrobaric 
bodies, and the orbit of the Sun, or the relative orbit of the centre of mass 
of the Earth-Moon system, is treated as an undisturbed ellipse in a fixed 
plane. A large number of comparatively small but highly complicated 
corrections are still necessary in order to represent the gravitational motion 
of the Moon in actual circumstances. They may be classified thus :
(1) 
The effect of the ellipsoidal figure of the Earth, and possibly of the 
Moon.
(2) 
The direct action of the planets on the relative motion of the Moon.
(3) 
The indirect action of the planets, which operates by modifying the 
coordinates of the Sun. These indirect effects are in general larger than 
the direct effects, and are sometimes sensible in the lunar motion when they 
are insensible in the relative motion of the Earth and Sun. Among the 
indirect actions of the planets may be specially mentioned
(4) 
Lunar inequalities produced by the motion of the ecliptic, and
(5) 
The secular acceleration of the Moon’s mean motion, which arises 
from the secular change in the solar eccentricity e under the action of the 
planets.
It is impossible to discuss these matters profitably in a short space. The 
reader will find references in Professor Brown’s Treatise and detailed results 
in the memoir

 which contains his complete and original theory.

CHAPTER XXII
PRECESSION, NUTATION AND TIME
255. In order to investigate the motion of the Earth about its centre of 
gravity 0 we take a set of rectangular axes OXYZ fixed in space and a 
second set Oxyz coinciding with the principal axes of inertia. These are 
fixed in the Earth and move with it. The two sets are drawn in such a 
sense that the positive directions of the corresponding axes can be brought 
into coincidence by a suitable rotation. Their relative situation is defined 
by the three Eulerian angles 0, <$>, where 0 is the angle between OZ 
and Oz, (f> is the angle between the planes OXZ and OZz, and i/r is the angle 
between the planes OZz and Ozx. Then the coordinates are related by the 
scheme:

The result of resolving the angular velocities 0 which is a rotation in the 
plane OZz, which is a rotation about OZ, and which is a rotation about

axes, namely

which are Euler’s geometrical equations.
Let A, B, C be the moments of inertia about the axes Oxyz and L, M, N 
the moments of the external forces about these axes. Then the dynamical 
equations may be written in the well-known form:

256. The external forces which are here considered are due to the action 
of the Sun and Moon. An approximate expression for the action of either 
of these bodies is sufficient and easily found. The potential of the Earth 
(mass m) at a distant point P has been found (§ 18) to be
V = GX — = G (— 4- 
~
p \r 
2r3 
/
where OP = r and I is the moment of inertia of m about OP. This expression 
is true as regards terms of the second order in the coordinates of points in m 
relative to the centre of gravity 0. Terms of the third order will clearly 
vanish in the sum provided that the mass m possesses three rectangular 
planes of symmetry: and this is sensibly true in the case of the Earth. 
Terms of the fourth order are small in consequence of the ellipsoidal figure 
of the Earth and are neglected. Now V is the work done by unit attracting 
mass at P when the particles of the mass m are brought from infinity to 
their actual configuration. Hence the work done by a finite mass near 
a distant point O' is

„ (mm' m(A' + B’ + O' — 3Z')1

by similar reasoning, if O' is the centre of gravity of the attracting mass 
m, 00' = R, A', B', O' are the principal moments of inertia of m' at O' and I' 
is the moment of inertia of m about 00'. Now since A, B, 0 and I are of 
the second order in the linear dimensions of m, terms of the second order in 
the linear dimensions of m' can be neglected when associated with them. 
Let the coordinates of 0' relative to 0 be (x, y, z) and of P relative to O' be
Then

But since O' is the centre of gravity of the mass m'
Hgdm' = 'Zrjdm' = 'Sgdm' = 0.
Hence if the expression to be summed be expanded in terms of £, y, the 
terms of the first order vanish in the sum and terms of the second order are 
neglected. To this order of approximation

This represents the mutual potential of two masses rn, m with sufficient 
accuracy. In the usual astronomical units (§ 24) G = A;2. The mass of the 
Sun is unity and for the masses of the Earth and Moon we take E and fE.

mean motions n' and n",
G(\ + E) = n2a3

257. The moments of the external forces about the axes Oxyz being 
L, M, N, the work done by them when the Earth receives a small twist 
defined by the rotations dw1} da>2, dto3 about the same axes is
dU = Ldto1 + Mdtt}2 + Nd(o3.
But U depends on the orientation of the Earth only through the occurrence 
of I ; and
R2I = Ax2 + By2 + Cz2
(x, y, z) being the centre of gravity of the attracting body. Hence 
dU=— 3 Gm' (Axdx + By dy + Czdz)IR\
But with due regard to sign, when the axes are rotated,
dx — y d(o3 — z dw2, dy = z dwx — x dto3, dz = xdw2 — ydwA.
Hence, equating the coefficients of dwx, dw2, dw3 in the two expressions 
for d U,
L — BGm'(C — B) yz/ R5, M =3Gm (A — C)xz/R5, N = 3Gm'(B — A) xy / R5. 
These apply to a body possessing three distinct principal axes. But the 
Earth may be regarded as an ellipsoid of revolution, for which B = A and 
0 > A. Under these circumstances
E = 3Gm'(C-A)yz/R3, M= - 3Gm (C-A)xz/R3, N=0.
On the other hand, the term in U which depends on the orientation of the 
Earth is more generally
U' = — |Gml / R3 = — | Gm' (Ax2 + By2 + Cz2) / R3
= -lGm' {(2(7 - A - B) z2 + (A - B) (a? - y2) + (A + B) B2}/R3
a useful form for some purposes. The last term on the right, being inde­
pendent of the orientation, can always be rejected; and when the Earth 
is considered uniaxal, it is possible to use simply
U" = —^Gm (C — A)z2/R3................................ (3)
258.

The actual motion of the Earth is a steady state of rotation disturbed by the 
external forces and this steady state will be found by putting L = M = 0. 
The equations then give
— tw2 + 
= 0
where
p, = n(C-A)/A.
Hence the steady state is given by
&>! = h cos (pt + a), (o2 = h sin (fit + a).
But the instantaneous axis of rotation in the Earth is the line
«?/&>! = y/to2 = z/cd3 
or
sc/h cos (p,t + a) = y/h sin (pt + a) = z/n
which indicates that if h is fairly small the terrestrial pole describes a small 
circle of radius A/n about the axis of figure in the period 2tt//x. This is the 
Eulerian period of A/(C — A) (roughly 300) days. Now the angle between 
the Zenith of a place and the Pole is the co-latitude of the place, an angle 
which can be constantly observed. Hence the latitude of any place should 
exhibit a variation with a period of about 10 months. Until a quarter of 
a century ago no variation of latitude had certainly been detected. Since 
that time variations (of the order of 0"'3) have been systematically observed 
and studied and have also been traced in the older observations. But 
analysis has proved conclusively that these variations contain no part which 
conforms with the Eulerian period. They cannot therefore be explained by 
the free motion of the Pole on a rigid Earth. Hence observation justifies 
the belief that h /n is insensibly small.
The variations of latitude observed are always very small and constitute 
a highly complex phenomenon. The periods of the chief components of the 
motion of the Pole are about 12 and 14 months.
259. 
Corresponding to the free movement of the Pole on the Earth’s 
surface we have, by (1),
G = ojj sin yfr + co2 cos = h sin (y.t + a + >Jr)
<f> sin 6 = &>2 sin — co, cos y]r = — h cos (fit + a + yfr).
For the plane OXY we take the plane of the ecliptic which varies but 
slightly in consequence of planetary perturbations. The value of G is about 
23°. Hence G and <j> are very small in comparison with n, a fact in accord­
ance with observation even when the disturbing effects of the Sun and 
Moon are operative. Hence, further, yjr differs only slightly from n.
The rotational energy of the Earth is T, where
27T=^(co12 + co22) + Cco32
= A (tf2 + <j>2 sin2 G) + C (jr + <j> cos G'f.

z = X sin 0 cos </> + F sin 0 sin </> + Z cos 0.
The position of a disturbing body, such as the Moon, is more conveniently 
referred to a similar set of axes for another epoch t. The necessary changes 
may be considered successively, thus:

(i) Rotate the axes about OZ through the angle fl so as to bring OX to 
the position 0X4. Then
X = A\ cos fl — Fj sin fl, F = F4 cos fl + A\ sin fl, Z = Z4
where fl is the node of the ecliptic for epoch t on the ecliptic for 1850.0.
(ii) Rotate the axes about 0XA through the angle i so as to bring 0Yx 
to the position 0F2. Then
X4 = X2, Fx = F, cos i — Z2 sin i, Z4 — Z2 cos i + F, sin i
where i is the inclination of the ecliptic for epoch t to the ecliptic for 1850.0.
(iii) Rotate the axes about 0Z2 through the angle X — fl so as to bring 
0X2 to the position 0X3. Then
A2 = X3 cos (X— fl) — Fs sin (A — fl),
F2 = F3 cos (X — fl) + X3 sin (X — fl), Z2 = Z3
where X is the longitude of the Moon’s node reckoned through fl in both 
ecliptic planes.
(iv) Rotate the axes about 0X3 through the angle c so as to bring 0 Ys 
to the position 0F4. Then
X3 = Xit Ys = F4 cos c — Z4 sin c, Z3 = Z4 cos c + F4 sin c
where c is the inclination of the Moon’s orbit to the ecliptic for epoch t.
But, if (X4, F4, Z4) are the Moon’s coordinates,
Ar4 = r cos (v — X), . F4 = r sin (v — X), Z4 = 0
where r is the radius vector and v is the longitude of the Moon at epoch t 
reckoned in its orbit; this longitude is the sum of three arcs in the two 
ecliptic planes and the plane of the lunar orbit. Now i < 1° and, for the 
Moon, c is of the order 5°. Terms of the order i2, cs and ic are therefore 
neglected. Then the result of eliminating (X3, F3, Z3), (A4, F4, Z4) gives
A2 = r cos (v — fl) + |c2r sin (v — X) sin (X — fl)
F2 = r sin (v - fl) — £c2r sin (v — X) cos (X — fl)
Z2 = cr sin (v — X)
and the result of eliminating (X, F, Z), (A\, Fn ZJ gives
z = X2 sin 0 cos (</> - fl) + F2 sin 0 sin (0 — fl) 4- Z2 cos 0
+ i {F2 cos 0 — Z2 sin 0 sin (0 — fl)].
Hence
zfr = sin 0 cos (v — 0) + c cos 0 sin (v — X) — |c2 sin 0 sin (v — X) sin (0 - X)
+ i cos 0 sin (v — fl).
In squaring this expression terms not involving 0 or 0 can be rejected, 
because they disappear on differentiation. Also terms involving v with

Certain expansions in terms of the mean anomaly in undisturbed 
elliptic motion are now required. When e3 is neglected in the formulae 
of § 40, (22), (26) and (27) of Chapter IV become
r/a = 1 + je2 - e cos M — |e2 cos 2M
afx/r3 = (1 — f e2) cos M + 2e cos 2 M + -2fi7-e2 cos 371/
a?y_ (J _ s|n M+2e sin 2M + ^e2 sin 371/.
The latter give, w being the true anomaly,
a4 sin 2w/r4 = (1 — e2) sin 2M 4- 4e sin 371/ + ^-e2 sin 471/
a4 cos 2w/r4 = | e2 + (1 — e2) cos 2M + 4e cos 371/ 4- ^3-e2 cos 471/
a4/?’4 = 1 + 3e2 + 4e cos 71/ 4- 7e2 cos 271/
whence, after multiplication by r/a,
a3 sin 2wjr!i = [— |e sin TH] 4- (1 — g e2) sin 2M 4- [je sin 37H 4- V®2 s*n
a3cos 2wjr3 = [— |e cos 71/] 4- (1 — f e2) cos 271/4- [|e cos 371/ 4- J./e2cos 471/]
a3/.r3 = 1 4- 3e2 4- 3e cos 71/ 4- [f e2 cos 2M].
The eccentricity being small, of the same order as c, the terms [ ] which 
involve 71/ and are not of zero order, are immediately rejected. Now
M = n"t 4- fj> — ts
v = w 4- ®
where n't 4-p is the mean longitude of the Moon in its orbit and -nr is the 
longitude of the lunar perigee, both being measured partly in the two 
ecliptic planes for 1850’0 and the epoch t and partly in the plane of the 
lunar orbit. From the expression (4) can now be derived

which result must be solved by continual approximation. This process, 
when guided by the facts of observation and limited to practical require­
ments for a period of a century or two, is very simple. For it is known 
that 0 is very nearly constant, while <£> changes progressively but very slowly. 
Hence it is possible to discuss the secular effects, or precession, and the 
periodic effects, or nutation, separately.
263. The last three lines in the expression for U[Cn, containing six 
terms, give rise to periodic terms in 0, <f>, which can be neglected in the 
first instance. The secular changes come from the terms in the first line. 
With sufficient accuracy we may write
i sin 12 = gt, i cos 22 = g't, e' = e0 4- erf
the quantities e0, elt g and g being given by the theory of the Sun’s motion. 
The corresponding changes for the Moon are negligible in effect or rather 
are treated differently. Hence the equations for the secular movements of 
the Earth’s axis are

[cn. xxii
When t = 0 (18500), 0 is the mean obliquity of the ecliptic for that date 
and may be denoted by e0. Also 0, being the angle between the planes 
OXZ and OZz (§ 255), is 90° by the definition of the axis OX. The periodic 
effects at the time t = 0 are excluded from consideration here, but their 
influence is small. Hence initially

The length of time during which these expressions will be valid depends 
on the numerical values of the quantities involved. For a short interval 
from 1850’0 (a century or two) the preceding equations hold good, and may 
be written.
</>m = 9O°-a

Gm = e0 + 7^ J
the suffix m denoting mean values from which periodic changes are excluded. 
Thus <j>m, 0m define the position of the mean equator at the time t relative to 
the fixed ecliptic (1850’0), the coefficients a, /3 and y being now determined 
by (7). The motion of the mean equator on the fixed ecliptic, measured by 
90° — <}>m, is called the luni-solar precession in longitude. The angle 0m — e0 
may be called the luni-solar precession in obliquity.
264. It has been convenient to use a fixed set of axes XYZ, where 
Z represents the pole of the ecliptic for 1850’0 and X the mean equinox for 
the same date. It is now necessary to introduce a new set of axes X'Y'Z', 
where Z' represents the pole of the ecliptic for the epoch t and X' the 
corresponding mean equinox, i.e. the intersection of the mean equator and 
ecliptic at the epoch t. Let z represent the N. pole of this mean equator, 
its position being defined by 0m. The longitude of Z' in the X YZ system 
is fl — 90° and ZZ' = i, where
i sin fl = gt + hi?
i cos fl = g't + h'&
the terms of the second order being omitted above because they clearly give 
rise to terms of the third order only in the luni-solar precessions.
Let us consider the spherical triangle ZZ'z, of which two sides are 
ZZ'— i and Zz=0m. Since XZZ' = £1 — 90° and XZz = <j>m, the angle 
Z'Zz = <j>m — fl + 90°. The side zZ', which is the mean obliquity of the 
ecliptic at t, will be denoted by 0m', and the angle ZzZ’, which is called the 
planetary precession, will be denoted by a. Hence
cot i sin 0m — cos 0m sin (fl — <£m) + cot a cos (fl — <£m)

Again, in the same triangle,
cos Gm' = cos i cos Gm + sin i sin Gm sin (12 — </>m) 
whence, to the second order,
(Gm - Gm') sin | (Gm + 0m') = - \i2 cos Gm + sin Gn (agt2 - g't - h't2). 
To the first order, therefore,
Gm -Gm = - gt, sin 2 (Gm + 0m') = sin e0 + %gt cos e0.

The relations between the various sets of axes are shown in fig. 8. The equator 
X'y (epoch t) cuts the fixed ecliptic ATin.-r, where Xx = zZY= 90° — 
the luni-solar precession, and xX'= xzX'= ZzZ'= a, the planetary pre­
cession. Let ZX' cut XY in D, so that XD is the negative mean longitude 
(1850'0) of X', the mean equinox at t. This arc is called the general pre­
cession and will be denoted by 90° — </),/, so that xD = <f)m' — </)m. The angle 
DxX' = Zz— 6m and xDX' is a right angle. Hence
tan ~ <M = tan a cos 0,tl 
and to the second order

Thus by (8) and (9) the general precession may be expressed in the form
90° -</>,/ = Pt + P't2 
where
P = a —g cot e0
P' = - cot e0 (h 4- ag' — gg' cot e0) 
and by (8) and (10) the mean obliquity of the ecliptic is 
0 m = €o + Qt + Q t2 
where
Q =g
Q’ = y + h' -ag + %g2 cot e0.
265. To find the periodic effects, or nutation, it is necessary to return 
to § 262 and write
</> = </>m + <£> 
@ = @m +
Now <f>m and 0m have been calculated so as to satisfy the secular terms which 
arise in the equations of motion from the first line of the expression (6) for 
UjCn. Hence the six periodic terms of the last three lines alone are now 
relevant, and the dynamical equations become
<b = — {cos 2 (n't + fi —<]>) + 3e' cos (nt + fi — w')] cos 0
— K2 {cos 2 (n't + fi —<f))+3ecos (n't + fi — ct)} cos 0

The Moon’s node makes a circuit of the ecliptic in 18| years in the retro­
grade direction, so that it is possible to write

® is the nutation of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and — 4> is the 
nutation of longitude, 0 and <1> being measured in the direction of increasing 
longitudes. The numerical quantities involved are of such an order of 
magnitude that a fair standard of accuracy has already been obtained in the 
formulae. If more precise results were needed, it would be necessary (1) to 
carry the expansions for the disturbing bodies further, and (2) to continue 
the process of integration by successive approximation to a higher stage. 
The latter process would clearly introduce terms of the form at sin (nt 4- a). 
Among the terms of the former origin those depending on three times the 
Sun’s mean longitude (nt4-N) are the most important, and it may be left as 
an exercise to the reader to determine them.
By far the most important terms in the nutation are those with the 
argument (No — Nt). The other terms being omitted, let

Since e/T is an angle of a few seconds only, x and y may be considered as the 
rectangular plane coordinates of the Earth’s pole relative to the mean pole, 
£ being measured in the direction of increasing longitudes and y upwards 
towards the pole of the ecliptic. The relative path of the true pole is 
therefore the small ellipse

Precession, Nutation and Time [ch. xxn
described in a period of about 18 years. Since cos e0> cos 2e0 the major axis 
is directed towards the pole of the ecliptic and, since x has the same sign 
as y, the sense of description is such that the relative longitude of the true 
pole is increasing when it lies between the mean pole and the pole of the 
ecliptic, that is, it is clockwise when viewed from a point outside the celestial 
sphere. The centre of this elliptic motion is carried by precession almost 
uniformly in the direction of decreasing longitudes round the pole of the 
ecliptic.
267. 
Since the manner of the investigation has been controlled by the 
actual magnitude of the various quantities involved, it is necessary to intro­
duce numerical values if the results are to be properly understood. Three 
quantities are based on observation, and not derived from theory, namely, 
the obliquity e0 at the fundamental epoch 1850’0, the precession constant P 
and the nutation constant eX The values now accepted are
e0 = 23° 27'31"'7, P = 50"-2453, J^= 9"'21O.
The eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit is given by
e' = e0 + ej = 0-016 7719 - 0'000 0004181
and the position of the ecliptic by
i sin fl =gt + ht2 = + 0"-053411 + 0"-000 01935t2
i cos 12 = g't + h't2 = - 0"-46838 t + 0"-000 00563t2
the unit of time being a Julian year of 365’25 mean solar days. The Sun’s 
period relative to the equinox is the tropical year, and the corresponding 
mean motion is therefore
n = 2tt x 365-25/365-2422 = 6’28332.
The eccentricity and inclination of the Moon’s orbit are
e = 0-05490, c = 5° 8'43" = 0-089802.
The tropical period of the Moon is 27 32158 days, and hence the mean 
motion in a Julian year is
n' = 83’997 radians.
The retrograde motion of the Moon’s node has a sidereal period of 6793 5 
days. The corresponding mean motion, corrected for precession, is
N, = 0-33757 radians.
It is now possible to derive the values of and K>. In the first place, 
by (11),
Ar2 = eJAT1/ccose0 = 37"-74.
Also
a = P + g cot e0 = 50"’2453 + 0"-1231 = 50"’3684.

Since any error in <#affects K2 directly and hence K, equally, greater accuracy 
would be superfluous. The expressions for the luni-solar precession (§ 263)

In giving the numerical values of the terms in the nutation (§ 265) 
the notation is changed to that employed in the Nautical Almanac. The 
results which follow from substituting the above constants are:

where L is the Sun’s mean longitude (n't 4- fi), tt is the longitude of the

mean anomaly (n't + p — ■or), and S3 is the longitude of the Moon’s ascending 
node (No — Nj). In the Nautical Almanac the nutation of the obliquity of 
the ecliptic (0) is called Aw, and the nutation of longitude (— 0) is called 
AZ. Comparison shows that no term with coefficient exceeding 0"’05 has 
been omitted here.
Two important astronomical constants are involved implicitly in the 
constants of nutation and precession, namely the mass of the Moon and the 
ratio (C — A)/C, which has been called the mechanical ellipticity of the 
Earth. For the equations (5) may be written

expressed above in seconds of arc, are angular motions in a Julian year, 
and n, n' and n" are sidereal mean motions in the same unit of time. With 
sufficient accuracy the above values of n' and n" may be used, and for n the

obtained as a by-product from the observations of a minor planet in a refined 
determination of the solar parallax. The value of f found by Hinks in this 
way was 1/81-53.
269. The practical application of the results obtained for precession and 
nutation belongs to the domain of Spherical Astronomy and will not be 
pursued in detail here. Nutation is so small that its effects can be, and 
are, treated independently of those due to precession. Of the latter some­
thing more may be said in order to define the two quantities employed in 
calculating the effects of precession in right ascension and declination.
Let a, 8 be the R.A. and declination of a star at the epoch t. These refer 
to the system of axes X'yz (fig. 8), which differs by a simple rotation 
through the angle a about z from the system xyz. Hence the coordinates 
of the star in the latter system are
x = cos 8 cos (a + a), y = cos 8 sin (a + a), z = sin 8 
whence, by differentiation with respect to t, it easily follows that
a 4- a = (xy — y#)/cos2 8
b = z/cosb.
Now the relations between the systems xyz and XYZ are expressed by the 
scheme:
X 
Y 
Z
x sin <£> 
- cos <£> 
0
y cos 0 cos $ cos 0 sin <£> 
— sin 0
z sin 0 cos $ sin 0 sin 0 cos 0.
Here XYZ are constant, and differentiation of the linear formulae for xyz, 
when XYZ are finally expressed in terms of x, y, z, gives
x = (y cos 0 + z sin 0) (/>
y = — x cos 0 .(/> — z0
z = — xsin0 . <j) +y0.
Hence, when x, y, z are expressed in terms of a, 8,
a + d = — cos 0.<j> — tan 8 sin (a + a) sin 0. — tan 8 cos (a + a) . 0
8 = - cos (a + a) sin 0. </> + sin (a + a) 0.
These differential expressions are required to the first order in t, and a0 
being of the second order may be rejected at once. Hence (the symbol n 
being used here in a new sense)

while p = + 0"‘000 0002 and is altogether negligible. Thus m and n are the 
important quantities known as the annual precessions in R.A. and declination. 
The total precession in R.A. from 1850 for a point on the equator is

The expressions found for a, 8 are the coefficients of the first power of the 
time and these terms suffice for short intervals only. The further develop­
ment of formulae for the transformation of coordinates from one epoch to 
another according to the methods of astronomical practice must be sought in 
such works as Newcomb’s Compendium of Spherical Astronomy.
270. It is now possible to consider in some detail the astronomical 
measure of time. The third equation of (1) is
to3 = yjr + <£ cos 0.
Here to3 is the angular velocity of the Earth about its axis of figure and is 
a constant previously denoted by n. As this symbol has been used with 
another meaning in § 269 it will now be replaced by to. The angle r/r is 
the angle between a meridian plane (Ozx) fixed in the Earth and rotating 
with it and the plane (OZz) passing through the pole of the fixed ecliptic. 
For the fixed meridian we adopt the meridian of Greenwich. The rotation 
yfr refers therefore to the Greenwich meridian relative to zx in fig. 8, and 
T = ^r — a will measure the same rotation relative to zx'. But the angle 
between the Greenwich meridian and zx, x being the equinoctial point at 
the time t, is the hour-angle of the First Point of Aries, i.e. the sidereal time 
at Greenwich. Thus, t being Greenwich sidereal time,
T = yjr — d — to — a — <£> cos 0.

 — 0 cos e0 ........................ (12)
where t is measured in Julian years of 365'25 mean days and reclined from 
1850 Jan. 0, Gr. mean noon. The quantity t is an equi-crescent variable in 
the sense required by the dynamical laws which have been used; its origin 
and unit are for the moment of importance only so far as they condition the 
numerical values of the coefficients. On the other hand the sidereal time t 
is not uniform, being affected by secular and periodic terms. Hence t is 
merely an intermediate standard of time. But this in no way affects its 
practical utility. By far the largest term in 4> cos e0 is
15"'8O3 sin & = l8054 sin
of which the period is nearly 19 years, and m2 is very small. The irregularities 
in t are therefore very small and gradual, and far less than the natural 
irregularities in the rate of the most perfect sidereal clock. Since this 
instrument shows the hour-angle of the First Point of Aries, it also shows 
the right ascension of stars on the meridian, and this principle serves both 
to determine the error of the clock and to measure the apparent positions of 
the stars.
271. In the next place a mean Sun is defined which moves in the plane 
of the equator with the uniform sidereal mean motion /z. Its R.A. at time t, 
reckoned from the true equinox, is therefore
A = Ao 4- fit 4- mJ 4- mJ2 — 4> cos e0 
and its hour-angle
T =r — A = t0 — Ao 4- (tn — /z) t
is the measure of Greenwich mean time. The constants occurring in A are 
adjusted as far as possible to secure identity with the mean longitude of the 
actual Sun affected by aberration. This may be written in the form
L = (\, 4- XJ 4- M2) - k 4- (Pt 4- P'i2)
= Lo 4- LJ 4- Lj?

where is the true mean longitude of the Sun when t = 0, Xt is the sidereal 
mean motion, and 2X> is the secular acceleration which arises indirectly from 
the perturbations of the other elements of the Earth’s orbit; k = 20"’47 is 
the constant of aberration; and (Pt + P't2) is the general precession in 
longitude. The adjustment of the constants in A and L gives
J.o = Zo, /j, + 
= Lx
and leaves outstanding between L and A the secular discrepancy (L2 - m2) t2 
which would lead ultimately to a departure of the actual Sun, apart from 
periodic effects, from the meridian at mean noon. This quantity is small 
and far from certain in amount, and will have no practical effect for many 
centuries to come. Now at 1850 Jan. 0, Greenwich mean noon,
T=t=O, r0=zl0 = Z0
and the effect of adding one mean day to T or t is
24h = 360° = (co - ^)/365-25 
whence
to/365'25 = 24h4-(Z1 - t^)/365'25
(co 4-?^)/365’25 = 24h 4- A/365’25.
Now, according to Newcomb,
Zo = 279° 47' 58"-2 = 18h 39m ll8-88
A = 1296027"6674 = 864018-84449
L2 = 4- 0"-000 1089 = 4- 08-000 00726
while in the latter unit (I8 = 15")
th, = 4- 38-07141, m2 = 4- 08-000 00928 
so that
A/365-25 = 2368-55533, (ZT - 771^/365-25 = 2368-54692.
Hence in numbers the equation (12) for Gr. sidereal time becomes
r = 18h 39“ 118-88 4- (24h 3ra 56855533) D 4- 08-000 00928t2 - <I> cos e0
where D = 365'251 is the number of days reckoned from 1850 Jan. 0. When 
D is given an integral value this expression gives the sidereal time at Gr. 
mean noon and its value (less a multiple of 24h) is tabulated for every day 
in the Nautical Almanac. When the nutational term is omitted,
At = (24h 3m 568-55533 4- 08000 000051) AD.
The secular term is also negligible, and hence

A catalogue of astronomical positions gives mean places freed from 
nutation and reduced to the equinox of a common epoch. Such an epoch is 
always the beginning of a tropical year and this expression must be defined. 
It is the moment when the mean longitude of the Sun as above described,
L —

is 280° = 18h 40m. It follows that the length of a tropical year is

 mean solar days at the epoch 1900. For the present the 
secular change is unimportant. Once the beginning of the tropical year 
is fixed in a particular calendar year, its beginning in any other year 
may be found by adding so many tropical years. But the details will be 
better illustrated by a direct example from the year 1900. When t = 50, 
£'= 18h40m448123. Now 50 Julian years exceed 50 years of 365 days by 
12| days, whereas the calendar inserts 12 leap days between 1850 and 1900. 
Hence this is the mean longitude for 1900 Jan. 0*5.  The mean longitude 
for 1900 Jan. 0 (Gr. mean noon) is therefore L' — 
365
*25
 = 18h 38m 458*845
and must be increased by 748*155  at the daily rate 2368*555  in order to 
become 18h40m. This requires 0*3135  mean days, and the beginning of 
the tropical year in 1900 is therefore Jan. 0*3135,  the fraction of a mean day 
being reckoned from Greenwich mean noon. This epoch is recorded briefly 
as 1900
*0.
 It is to the mean equinox of this date that the observations of 
the year are reduced in the first instance.
273. 
Such in outline are the main features in the astronomical methods 
of reckoning time. They involve certain constants which, being based on 
the comparison of theory with observations, are capable of improvement. 
But there is no absolute standard of time. Ultimately no doubt the con­
tinued comparison of theory with observation according to such a system of 
time as that described above will bring to light discrepancies in the motions 
of the heavenly bodies of a kind which cannot be attributed to errors of 

271-273] Precession, Nutation and Time 
311
observation. Then the question will arise whether these discrepancies can 
be removed by a mere adjustment of an accepted system of constants in­
volved in the measure of time or whether the fault lies in the theory. This 
is the ordinary experience of practical astronomy. It may, however, prove 
that what have been regarded as constants are not really constant at all. 
Thus co, the rate of rotation of the Earth on its axis, may vary owing to such 
causes as the secular cooling of the Earth and the effect of tidal friction. 
There is, indeed, reason to think that this is so. But ultimately it is only 
possible to adopt such a system of measuring time as will reconcile all 
celestial phenomena as far as may be with the simplest possible body of 
laws. In the meantime to deal with discrepancies as they arise is among 
the most critical problems of technical astronomy.

CHAPTER XXIII
LIBRATION OF THE MOON
274. The form of solution found suitable in discussing the rotation of 
the Earth depends on special circumstances and is by no means general. 
The Moon’s rotation similarly presents quite special features which require 
very different treatment. This movement is governed to a high degree of 
approximation by Cassini’s laws:
(1) 
The Moon rotates uniformly about an axis which is fixed with 
respect to the Moon itself. The period of this rotation is identical with the 
sidereal period of the Moon in its orbit, namely 27'321661 days.
(2) 
The pole of the lunar rotation z makes a constant angle (1°35') 
w'ith the pole of the ecliptic Z, which may here be regarded as a fixed point 
on the celestial sphere.
(3) 
In consequence of the nearly uniform regression of the lunar node 
on the plane of the ecliptic and the nearly constant inclination of the lunar 
orbit (5° 9'), the pole of the Moon’s orbit P is known to describe a small 
circle about Z in a period of 18 j years. The arc of a great circle zP contains 
also the pole Z. In other words, the planes of the lunar orbit and the lunar 
equator intersect on the ecliptic, the latter plane being intermediate between 
the two former.
These laws were discovered by observation and they are so exact that 
later work with more refined instruments has failed hitherto to determine 
any divergences from them with a satisfactory degree of certainty. They 
define as it were a steady state of motion, and it is necessary to inquire 
under what conditions such a state is possible, and to what oscillations it is 
subject according to theory.
275. The first of the above laws corresponds with the well-known fact 
that the Moon always presents the same face to the Earth, or more truly 
that a large fraction of its surface (nearly f) is always concealed from obser­
vation. In order that exactly the same face should be seen at all times 
three further conditions would be necessary and the failure of these conditions 
gives rise to three distinct components of what is called the apparent or 

274 276] 
Libration of the Moon 
313
optical libration of the Moon. These conditions and the corresponding 
effects of their departure from the facts are:
(1) 
The motion of the Moon in its orbit about the Earth must be 
uniform. But owing to the equation of the centre and periodic perturbations 
the actual place of the Moon may differ from its mean place by as much as 
8°. Hence an oscillation in the central meridian, which is known as the 
libration in longitude.
(2) 
The axis of the Moon must be normal to the plane of its orbit. 
Actually the angle which it makes with the normal to the orbit is
1° 35' + 5° 9' = 6° 44'.
The monthly effect of this is called the libration in latitude.
(3) 
The point of observation must be the centre of the Earth. Owing 
to the position of the observer on the Earth’s surface, which varies with the 
rotation of the Earth, there is a parallactic effect which is called the diurnal 
libration.
These three effects which together constitute the optical libration of the 
Moon are purely geometrical consequences of the known conditions, and 
entirely independent of the dynamical libration which is now to be examined.
276. When the rotation of the Moon is in question the action of the 
Earth as a disturbing body is clearly preponderant and the action of the 
Sun is neglected. Let 0 be the centre of gravity of the Moon, OXYZ a set 
of ecliptic axes, fixed in space, and O.ryz a set fixed in the rotating body and 
coinciding with the principal axes of the Moon, the corresponding moments 
of inertia being A, B, C. Now since the axis of rotation is nearly or quite 
fixed in the body it must practically coincide with a principal axis; for a 
permanent axis in any other position would require a constraint which is 
obviously absent in this case. This principal axis will be identified with Oz. 
As in § 255 the two sets of axes are connected by the angles 0, and -fy, and 
0 = ZOz being always of the order lo-6, its square may be neglected. The 
relations between the coordinates are then given by the scheme:

Libration of the Moon
[ch. xxin
The dynamical equations are again of the form
AtOi — (B—C) 
= L
— (C — A) (o3g>i = M
Cw3 — (A — B) Wj (i)2 = N 
where (§ 257)
L = 3Gm(C — B) yz/r’, M—8Gm(A — C) xz/r5, N =3Gm(B — A) xy fi*  
m being the mass of the Earth, (x, y, z) its coordinates and r its distance 
from the Moon. Let (A\ Y, Z) be the ecliptic coordinates of the Earth 
relative to the Moon. The inclination of the Moon’s orbit, c = 5° 9', is so 
small that c2 will be neglected. Then (cf. § 65)
— X = r cos (fl + to + w), — Y = r sin (fl + w + w), — Z = rc sin (w + w) 
where fl is the longitude of the Moon’s node, (fl + &>) the longitude of the 
Moon’s perigee, and w the Moon’s true anomaly. But
X = fl + w + w
is the longitude of the Moon in its orbit. Hence, by the above relations 
between the two sets of coordinates,
— x = r cos (X — </> — •*/<),  — y = r sin (X — </> — i/r)
— z = r0 cos (X — <£) + rc sin (X — fl)
the product c0 being neglected in x and y. Let
C—B = Aa, A—C=B/3, B-A = Cy.
Then the dynamical equations of motion become
&>! 4- a&>2&>3 = 3Gmar~3 sin (X — </> — ^) [0 cos (X — </>) + c sin (X — fl))' 
g>2 + /Swg&h = 3Gm/?r-3cos (X — — ^) (0 cos (X — </>) + c sin (X — fl)} 
to3 + 
= ^Gmyr-3 sin 2 (X — </> — i/r)
•••(I)
As the figure of the Moon is to all appearance sensibly spherical, a, ft and 7 
must be fairly small quantities. And since, further, the instantaneous axis 
is nearly fixed in the body and very close to the axis of z, coj and to2 must be 
very small in comparison with w3.
277. It follows that in the last equation the term 7&>1&>2 can be neglected. 
Hence this equation becomes, in view of the third geometrical equation,
<j> + = f Gmyr~3 sin 2 (X — </> — ijr) ........................(2)
The Moon’s mean longitude is n't + e, where n is the Moon’s mean motion 
and e is a constant. The Earth’s mean longitude, as seen from the Moon, is 
therefore 77 + n't + e. But according to Cassini’s first law, 
to3 = </> + ^ = n' 
or
</> 4-

276-278J

the constant depending on the choice of a fixed meridian on the Moon’s 
surface. Let it be so chosen that the latter expression is equal to the 
Earth’s mean longitude. The corresponding meridian is called the first 
lunar meridian. In order now to allow for a possible inequality in the 
Moon’s rotation an angle is introduced such that
</> + 
+ x = 7r + n't + e.................................... (3)
This angle represents an oscillation in the position of the first meridian. 
According to Cassini’s laws % = 0 and observation proves that x is certainly 
very small. The equation (2) now becomes
X = — fGnvfr~3sin2+ X — nt — e) ........................(4)
It is clear that the conditions of stability are only complicated by the 
inequalities in the motion of the Moon. Therefore we substitute for the 
moment a uniform circular orbit with mean distance a, so that X = nt + e, 
r = a' and
X = — f Gmya'^ sin 2^
= - f ^7 (1 +/)-1 sin 2X ............................(5)
where f is the ratio of the mass of the Moon to the mass of the Earth; since 
by Kepler’s third law
Gni(l+/) = w'2a'3 ................................... (6)
But the equation of motion of a simple pendulum of length I and inclined to 
the vertical at an angle 6 is
0 = — gl~l sin 0
which can be identified with (5) by taking %= and 3n'27(l +f)-1 = gl~\ 
Both equations can of course be solved generally in elliptic integrals. But 
it is enough to notice the physical fact that the pendulum is capable of 
small vibrations provided 0 is small initially and g is positive. Similarly x 
if initially small will remain small provided 7 is positive, i.e. B > A. Now, if 
the inclination of the lunar equator to the lunar orbit be neglected, (</> + i/r) 
measures the displacement of the axis of x from the equinox from which the 
longitudes are reckoned. Under these simplified conditions the first meridian 
contains the axis of x and always coincides with the central meridian of the 
apparent disc. The axis of x is therefore directed approximately towards 
the Earth and this defines the axis about which the moment A is less than 
the moment B. This is the first condition of stability. It is also to be 
inferred that AfiB. For if A = B, x = 0 and a small disturbance would 
introduce a secular term in x which observation shows to be absent.
278. If 7' = 7 (1 + y*)
-1 the more general equation (4) for x becomes 
X = — 2(a'/r)3sin 2(x + X — nt — e).
Now (X — n't — e) is of the order of the eccentricity of the lunar orbit 
(•055)r x is st,iU smaller and a fr differs from 1 also by a quantity of the 

316 
Lib ration of the Moon 
[ch. xxiii
order of the eccentricity. Hence if the square of the eccentricity be 
neglected,
X = - 3-n'V (x + X - n't - e) 
or
X + 
= — ^n^y^H sin (ht + h')
where the terms under S represent the equation of the centre and periodic 
inequalities of the lunar motion. This is the ordinary equation for forced 
vibrations and the solution may be written in the form x = Xi + where Xi 
is a particular solution, corresponding to the forced vibrations, and ^2 is the 
complementary function, corresponding to an arbitrary free vibration. It is 
easily verified that
and
%2 = K sin [n't \/(3y') + k'}
where K, k' are arbitrary. Terms in Xi can onty become sensible by reason 
of H large or h small, and the most promising terms in the lunar theory are 
consequently the equation of the centre (or principal elliptic term):
ht + h'=gi, 17= + 22639"-1, /t = 47033"-97
and the annual equation :
ht + h' = ©, H = - 668"-9, h = 3548"16
where gA is the Moon’s mean anomaly, © is the Sun’s mean anomaly, and 
the unit of time is the mean solar day, so that n' = 47435"’03. The corre­
sponding terms in Xi are
377' 
, . 
11'15

X1 0-3277 -y 7 Slngi 0-001865-7" 7 Sm° ...........
It is easily seen that, y being certainly very small, it is the second of these 
terms which is the larger. But the determination of its coefficient from 
observation has not yet been made with satisfactory certainty. Since the 
Earth’s distance is about 220 times the Moon’s radius a geocentric angle 
of 1" is the equivalent of 4' in selenographic arc near the centre of the lunar 
disc. As the quantities to be looked for are likely to be of this order, or 
rather still less, and the observations are very difficult, positive results must 
be awaited from the study of the large-scale photographs of the Moon which 
are now available. According to Franz, using the heliometer observations of 
Schluter, the coefficient of sin © is about 2', giving y of the order 0 0003, 
and the arbitrary libration K, which should have a period of rather more 
than 2 years, is practically negligible.
279. Since, by (3), co3 4- x — n' where x may now 6e supposed very small, 
the first two dynamical equations may be written

M]B = 3y3zi'2 (a fr)2 cos (X — <p — ip-) {0 cos (X — <£>) + c sin (X — 11)} 
and as they are already of the order 0 or c multiplied by a or /3, the other 
quantities involved are only required to the first order in e, the eccentricity 
of the orbit. Now gx being the mean anomaly, by Ch. IV (9) and (30)—or

It is now necessary to introduce (11), (12) and (13) into LfA, M[B, to 
reject terms of the third order in e, c and 0, and to resolve the products

In this way any periodic terms on the right of the equations can be 
represented by corresponding terms in £ and 77. But the coefficients Q, Q' 
involve P, P' multiplied by the small quantities a or ft, and are therefore 
extremely small unless A is also very small. Now A=jp2(p2 —1) when 
a and ft are ignored and therefore, ceteris paribus, sensible terms can be 
obtained only when p is very near to 0 or +1.
Solutions of the same form constitute the complementary function and 
are determined by (17) when P — P' = 0. Then p is given by
A — pi — p2 (1 — 3ft — aft) — 4>aft = 0 
or
2p2 = 1 — 3ft — aft + V{(1 - 3ft - aft)2 + 16a/3]
It is enough to retain in p the terms of the first order in a, ft, and thus
2p2 = 1 - 3ft - aft + (1 - 3ft - aft + Saft)
so that if p1, p2 are the two roots,
Pi = 1 - %ft, p>=2 \f(~ aft).

Thus the periods of the two possible terms are determined with sufficient 
accuracy, the former being nearly a month, and if the corresponding co­
efficients are Qlt Qi, Q2, Qi, then by (16) to the lowest order only
Qi/Q^-1, Qi/Q2 = 2J(-/3/a).
Hence a solution of (15) when 0 is substituted on the right-hand side is
fi = Qi sin {(1 - f/3) n't + 
+ Q2 sin [2 V(— «/3) t +
Vi = - Qi cos {(1 - f/3) nt + 
+ 2 V(- £/a) Q2cos [2 V(- a/3)t +
and as these expressions contain four arbitrary constants Q1} Q2, q1} q2 they 
represent the required complementary functions.
These arbitrary terms again appear to be insensible. The important 
point is that a/3 must be negative, for otherwise the circular functions would 
be changed into hyperbolic functions and the motion would be unstable. 
This means that (C
*  — B) (A — C) is negative, or again that C is not inter­
mediate in magnitude between A and B. This is the second condition of 
stability which has been found.

To terms of the first order only,
Z/A = 0, M [B = — 3/3n2c sin (^ + •st — fl) 
where, the secular inequality of the node being taken into account, 
ffi + -ar = nt + e, fl = fl0 — pnt, p = + 0'004019.
Thus in applying (17), P" = 0, P = — c, p = 1 + p, and therefore

If a, /3 and p be regarded as small quantities of the first order and those of

These terms contain the explanation of the steady motion of the Moon’s axis, 
which is expressed by Cassini’s laws.

the ecliptic may be taken as

F = 0 sin </> = £ sin (0 + t/c) - 77 cos (0 + '*/'')•

Let the free components £, ifr be ignored and also the forced oscillations of 
the second order which have still to be found. Then
X = Q sin ((/j + is — fl — </> - i/r) 
F = Q cos (gi + ib — fl — </> — i/r).
But by (10)
<j>+'^' = g1+'tB+TT 
and therefore
X = Q sin fl, Y = — Q cos fl.
But the longitude of the pole of the lunar orbit is fl — |tf, so that its 
coordinates are similarly
X'= c sin fl, Y' = — c cos fl.
Hence these two poles are always exactly on opposite sides of the pole of 
the ecliptic provided Q is negative. This requires, since Q is given by (19), 
0 > > — f/x. Hence C> A, which is a third condition to be satisfied by the 
moments of inertia. The resultant of the three places the moments in the 
order
C>B>A
where C refers to the axis of rotation and A to that axis which in the mean 
is directed towards the Earth.
It is now clear that the further conditions necessary in order that the 
second and third laws of Cassini shall remain approximately true are one 
and the same, namely that those terms which have been neglected in the 
above argument are really small in comparison with Q. This quantity is 
the mean value of 0, and its numerical value is 91/-4 according to Franz. 
With c = 808'-7 and p. = 0 004019 it follows that
-3 = (0'-ii)/B = 0*000612
which should be tolerably well determined. It is to be noticed that a, 7 
are not independent, but connected by the identity
a + + 7 + a$7 = 0.
The product is negligible and if 7 = 0'0003 as given above, then a is of 
exactly the same order as 7.
282. The terms of the second order in e, c, 3 can now be found without 
difficulty, since here it is legitimate to give 0 and yfr their values in the 
steady motion. Thus 3 = 30, its constant mean value, and since in the steady 
motion </> — fl + |tf,
t/t = ^ + ct — fl +
Hence without the terms of lower order already treated, the expressions (14) 
become

The corresponding terms in £ 77 can be found in the way explained in § 280. 
But since ct and fl change slowly p is nearly 2 in the case of the terms which 
contain 2^ in the argument. Their counterpart in £, 77 is therefore negligible. 
With the other pair p is very small. The secular changes in the node and 
perigee may be expressed by
fl = fl0 — pnt, ct = ct0 4- vnt
so that p = p 4- v, and 2P = P' = — e (0O 4- c). Hence (17) give
Q_________ =______

which, when simplified by the removal of all but the most significant quantities 
in the denominators, become
Q/2a = Q'//3 = %e(0o+c)/p.
The terms of the second order are therefore simply
& = 3ae 3° + C sin (ct - fl), tj3 = %0e ^-C cos (ct - fl).......(21)

Now v = 0’008455, p 4- v = 1/80 nearly, and 0O 4- c = 400'. Also e = 0’0549 
and with the above values of a and (3, 3ae = — ^/3e = 0’00005. Hence both 
coefficients are numerically 1'6, and
£3 = l'*6

/n' = - (1 4- p 4- v) £3, co2/n' = (1 4- p 4- v) ?)3
and (p 4- v) is relatively unimportant here.
One remark is necessary however. For the sake of simplicity and in order 
to concentrate attention on the main feature of the motion, the coefficients 
of £2 and in (20) were made numerically equal by the simple expedient 
of neglecting /x2(= 0 000016) in comparison with p. Consistently with this

the factor (1 4- /t) has been omitted in finding £2, iy2, and the result is that 
£2, y2 do not appear in c^, co2. This factor can only be reinstated correctly 
after /t2 has been restored in £2, y2. Now by (18) £2, y2 are of the form
&= {(1 +a02-«} Gwng, ?/2 = —(1—a)(l +n)Gcosg
where g = gr 4- is — fl. Hence
f2/n' = (1 4-

and the contributions to coj, w2 are given by
Afth/n' = — a (2/i 4- /t2) G sin g

The factor a shows that Aw, is very small and if /t2 as well as a be now 
rejected,
kafri = 0, Ato2/n' = — 2/n/2.
Hence in a numerical form the forced rotations are finally given by
w1fn = — £3 = — T'6 sin (w — fl)

 and /t = 0 004.
With the more exact expressions the coefficient in is numerically 
greater than that in t?2, the difference being — p (1 4- /t 4- a) G or — p,G. This 
amount, 22", may be divided equally between the two coefficients without 
disturbing the observed mean inclination of the lunar equator to the lunar 
orbit, and thus
£2 = — 9Y‘f> sin (g± + is — fl), % = 91'2 cos (<7i 4- o — fl).

where the coefficients are expressed in circular measure. Thus the position 
of the instantaneous axis, relative to the principal axes of the Moon,
x I — y J <02 — z / co3
is determined. It has therefore been seen under what conditions Cassini’s 
laws are approximately true, and how far they must necessarily be modified 
by disturbing actions.
The latest results from observation, by M. Puiseux of Paris, seem to be 
at variance with the foregoing theory. It is probable that it will be necessary 
to treat the Moon as a deformable body, as the observed variations of latitude 
have shown to be requisite in the case of the Earth. The above theory is 
very largely due to Poisson.

FORMULAE OF NUMERICAL CALCULATION
284. If we consider a function of one variable or argument only, for the 
sake of definiteness, it can be represented in three distinct ways, namely:
(1) By an analytical form, e.g. sin a; or a hypergeometric series F (a, /3, 7, x). 
The effectiveness of such a form depends on the knowledge of its properties 
and the facility with which it submits to the ordinary operations of mathe­
matics.
(2) Graphically, by a curve. This gives a Continuous representation. 
Values of the function corresponding to particular values of the argument 
can be obtained and the processes of differentiation and integration can be 
performed mechanically. But the accuracy of the results is limited in 
practice.
(3) 
Numerically, by a series of isolated values. This gives a discon­
tinuous representation, but one capable of very great accuracy. In theory 
this does not serve to define the function, for it may vary in any manner 
between the given values. Even in practice the representation does not 
cover terms in the function with a period of the same order as the intervals 
between the values. But with due care this limitation causes little in­
convenience.
Each mode of representation has distinct advantages of its own and to 
pass from one to another is a problem frequently arising and often attended 
by great difficulty. The form (1) may be considered the ultimate expression 
of natural truth, but it has no absolute superiority. Thus integration may 
be practically impossible in this form and must be replaced by a mechanical 
quadrature.
A function determined by a series of observations or experiments falls 
generally under the form (3). Now the variable quantities which occur in 
Astronomy, e.g. the coordinates of the Moon, are in general so complicated, 
even when an expression in analytical form is available, that for practical 
purposes it is necessary to use an ephemeris, or a table of values calculated 
for equal intervals of time (not necessarily one day, as the name would 
imply). • It is therefore necessary to consider how functions represented in 
21—2 

324 
Formulae of Numerical Calculation [ch. xxiv
this way may be manipulated so as to give intermediate values by inter­
polation for comparison with the results of observation, and also to render 
numerical differentiation and integration possible.
285. Let w be the constant interval of the argument and yn=f(a + nw') 
be the function to be considered, the values of yn being given for consecutive 
integral values of n. A simple difference table can be formed thus:
a + (n — l)w yn_x
yn ~ y-n—i
ainw yn 
yn+1 - %yn + yn^
yn+1 ~ yn ,
a + (n+l)w yn+1
Now let two operators A, 8 be introduced such that 
tyn = yn+i ~ yn, fyn = yn~ yn-i ■
Then it follows that
ASyn = A (yn - 
= yn+1 - %yn + yn^ = 8 (yn+1 - yn) = 8A yn.
Hence the operators A, 8 are commutative, and similarly it is easily seen 
that they obey all the laws of ordinary algebra. The inverse operators 
A-1, 8-1 may be defined so that A A-1 = 1, S3-1 = 1. Then the table of 
differences may be replaced by a table of operations which, acting on yn, will 
reproduce the difference table, thus:
A-18 
82
8 
1 
A8
A 
A8-1 
A2
The two operators are not independent, for the position of A 8 in this table 
shows that they are connected by the homographic relation
A8 = A —8, 8 = A (1 + A)-1, A = 8 (1 — 8)-1............... (1)
Let x be the variable, so that y = f(x), and let D = djdx. Then 
(1 + -j- w)
=f{x) + wf (x) + |w2/" (x) + ...
= {1 + wD + |w2Z>2 + . ..}/(#)

where j q | by a proper choice of n may always be taken < |, and in any case 
should not exceed 1. The coefficients are simple binomial coefficients.
286. 
The differences A, A2,... are diagonal differences in the table. 
But the most useful formulae involve central differences, lying on or adjacent 
to a horizontal line in the table. If the blank spaces in the odd columns are 
filled by the arithmetic means of the entries immediately above and below, 
the operators in the complete central line are
1

Thus k cannot be expressed rationally in terms of K*  and in order to find a 
formula in terms of central differences it is necessary to expand in terms 
of K, keeping only the first power of k. Thus

immediately below the central function, with the mean even differences 
of the same line, so that the operators are
1 + |A, A, . (1 + |A) K, AK, (1 + |A) K2,.....
The odd differences are thus the same as in the formula of Gauss, and 
therefore
(1 + A)9 = bllg + Vg = (1 4- |A) Vg + A (tig - | Vg)

which is of course equivalent, hut is not symmetrical with respect to the

When the sign of p is reversed, the terms of even order are unchanged and 
the terms of odd order are simply reversed in sign. If terms of the two 
orders are computed separately, two interpolations—corresponding to + p— 
are obtained at the same time. This is of great advantage in systematic 
interpolation to regular fractions of the tabular interval, e.g. in reducing the 
12-hourly places of the Moon to an hourly ephemeris. Stirling’s formula 
presents a similar advantage. But (13) becomes particularly simple at the 
middle of an interval, for then q = | or p = 0, and the odd differences dis­
appear. Thus
y.+, - ((1 + JA) - * (1 + |A) g + ^(1 + *A)  g«

and this gives intermediate values with great ease and accuracy.
289. When the values of a function y are known only at irregular 
intervals of the argument x, as in an ordinary series of observations, the 
function is strictly indeterminate in the absence of other information as to 
its form. Nevertheless, when n values ylt ...,yn are known, corresponding 
to a?!, ..., xn, a formula
y = a0 4- a^x 4- ... 4- an_i a?M-1
can be found which is satisfied by the n values and within the interval 
to xn will generally resemble the true function closely. The n coefficients 
can be determined by the linear equations
yr = a0 4- a^x? 4-... 4- an_x xrn~'
(r = 1,...,n). These can be solved in the ordinary way, but it is immediately 
obvious that the result can be written
(iCr-Xi) ,..(xr-sc^

where the numerator of the fraction written does not contain (a; — a?r). For 
this equation becomes an identity when xr, yr are substituted for x, y. The 
.expression on the right is a polynomial of degree n — 1 in a? and the equation, 
since it is satisfied by every pair (a?r, yr\ must be identical with the previous 
equation, the coefficients in which can be written down by comparison. The 
formula (15) is due to Lagrange and is directly suitable for interpolation,

differentiation and integration. An illustration of its use in a case where 
n = 3 has been given in § 71. When n is large the formula naturally be­
comes inconvenient for practical purposes.
290. 
Returning to the function with known values at regular intervals 
of the argument, let us consider the process of mechanical differentiation. 
By (2)
wD =log(l+A) = A - |A24-|A3 — 
।
w2D2 = {log (1 + A)}2 = A2 - A3 4- fl A4 - ... J................' }
These formulae are suitable only in simple cases where great accuracy is not 
required. The loss of accuracy is a natural tendency when differentiation is 
concerned. The forms (16) also apply only to the tabulated value of the 
argument. But since
x = a 4- (n 4- q) w, wD = wdfdx = djdq
a formula of differentiation can be derived from every formula of interpolation. 
Thus Bessel’s formula (12) gives
= (A + J(2, - 1). (1 + JA) K + A (6<C - 6S + 1)?A A + ...] 
1
Wy»+9={(1+JA)£+1(2?-1).AA'+I15(6!’-61Z-I).(l+1A)^+...M< ’ 
and analogous forms may be derived similarly by differentiating (7) and (9) 
with respect to q.
But there are some particular cases of special simplicity and importance 
in the formulae of central differences. According lo (6) uq is an odd function 
and vq an even function of q. Now when q =0, dfdq is the coefficient of q 
and d2[dq2 -is twice the coefficient of q2 in kuq + vq. These coefficients can 
easily be taken from kuq and vq respectively, and give, by (6) or (7),

Both (18) and (19) involve the alternate differences in the central tabular 
line.
Similarly when Vqt Uq are expressed in terms of p = q 4-1 instead of q as 
in (8) and (11), Vq is an even function and I7q is an odd function of p.

The distinction between the operators (1 + A)^ and (1 + |A) must be 
carefully noted. That on the left, (1 + A)^, indicates an addition of half the 
tabular interval to the argument, so as to apply the differentiation at the 
right point, which is the middle of the interval. That on the right, (1 + |A), 
merely denotes the mean of adjacent differences in a vertical column of the 
difference table.
291. 
Convenient methods for mechanical integration or quadrature can 
now be deduced. The formulae for differentiation just found, (18), (19), (20), 
(21), are of the form
wD = kS, (K), 
w2D2 = S2 (K)
wD (1 + A)
*
 = AS3 (K), w2I> (1 + A)1 = (1 + |A) S4 (K) 
S (K) denoting a power series in K. Hence
w-1 D-i = k~'/Si (K), 
ur2 D-2 =1/S2 (K)
«r>Z>"1(l+A)i=(l+A)A-’/^(A'), w-2D-2(l+A)i=(l + A)(l+|A)-1/^(^). 
The coefficients of the reciprocals of the K series must be expressed more 
appropriately, thus:
k~' = k/k2 = k(K + IK2)-1 = kK^Kl + \K)
(1 + A)A-1 = 3"1 = A^"1
(1 + A) (1 + £A)-1 = (1 + |A) {1 + |A2 (1 + A)-1}-1 = (1 + |A) (1 + 1 AS)-
*
 
= (l+iA)/(l + W.
It is therefore necessary to multiply and by (1 + |F) before finding the 
reciprocals of the series by division in order to have results for D1, D~2 of

exactly the same form as those already found for D, D2. These results are 
easily found to be

+ 7*2% K — e04So +)...... *•............... (22)
w~2 D~2 = K~f + A +

w-‘Z)->(l + A)‘ = (l + 
A + Tfe 
A'«+ ...)...(25)
The development is here carried as far as differences of the fifth order. 
This is generally sufficient.
It is now necessary to examine the meaning of these purely formal 
results. The operator K, like its components A, 8, is such that KK~2 = 1, 
and therefore, as K represents a move two places to the right in the table, 
K2 represents a move two places to the left. The difference table now 
requires an extension not hitherto contemplated, and the central line of the 
table of operators, with the adjacent lines above and below, now becomes:
8 A"-1 
8 
8 A" 
8/f2 ...
K~' 
[Hk-1] I [A] K [A7k] 
A"2 
[AA?] ...
[(H-iA)AT-1] A A"-1 [1+|A]| A [(1+|A)A"] AA" [(1+|A)A"2] ^ ...
Here 1 corresponds to the original entry yn in the table. The natural 
differences as directly formed are expressed simply, while those which are 
means of the entries immediately above and below are enclosed by [ ]. 
But while the symbols occurring in the columns to the right of the central 
column (representing the function itself) will be readily understood, the 
construction of the columns to the left must now be explained. The numbers 
in the first column to the left are such that their differences appear in the 
central column. Thus
(A/f1 - 87T-1) yn = yn, AA"-1 yn = yn + 8/f-1 yn
and when one number in this column is fixed, the rest are formed by 
adding successively (when proceeding downwards) the tabulated values of 
the function. The entries in this column therefore contain an additive 
arbitrary7 constant. The second column to the left is related to this first 
column in exactly the same way as the first column to the central column, 
and therefore contains another arbitrary constant, but is otherwise definite.
The use of four different operators in the table may seem excessive, since 
they are all expressible in terms of one. In fact
A = ev:D — 1, 8=1 — e~wD, k = sinh uD, K = 4 sinh2 fywD
and this suggests another mode of development which has here been de­
liberately avoided. But all these operators have simple special meanings 

332 
Formulae of Numerical Calculation [ch. xxiv
and it is important to notice that ktir1 and (1 4-|A) are equivalent, but quite 
distinct from AAr1, though in the complete table, in which the mean differ­
ences are filled in, they all three denote one vertical step downwards.
292. As with A-1 and the other operators, D~l is such that DD-1 = 1, or 
D, D-1 represent inverse operations. And since D represents differentiation, 
D-1 represents integration. Thus take the formula (24). The column A Ar1 
being formed with an arbitrary constant, the right-hand side of the equation, 
operating on yn, will produce a function (represented in tabular form) which 
is w-1 D-1 (1 + A)^ yn — w~x D-1 yn+^- On the application of D or differentia­
tion, this becomes w~Tyn+^. Hence the meaning of the formula is
ra+mw
w-1 J 
ydx = (A A"1 4- 
A - A AC 4- AA”2 - ...) yn .. .(26)
where m is written for n 4- |. The lower limit is arbitrary. But the right­
hand side also contains an arbitrary constant, and this constant can now be 
chosen so as to fix the lower limit of integration. For let this limit be 
a 4- If then m> = |, n = 0 in (26)
0 = (AAT-1 4- A — A A 4- -5$$^ NK
*
 — ...) y0 ......(27)
and the value of &K~x.y<> is now determined. With it the whole of the 
corresponding column can be definitely calculated by successive additions of 
the values of the function. When this is done, (26) represents the definite 
integral of y between the limits a 4- and a + (n 4- |) w.
Quite similarly the meaning of (22) is seen to be
ra+nw
w-1 J ydx = (kK-1 - k 4- kK - kK2 + ...) yn .. .(28) 
where the lower limit is a when
0 = (kK-1 — k + Nq kK — 
kK2 + ...) y0.
But the latter form is not convenient, because kK^y[}, which is hereby deter­
mined, is the mean of two numbers not yet known. Now
2k K-1 y0 = A AT-1 y0 + 5K~x yOf y0= A A"1 y0 - SK'1 y0 
and therefore
NK-1 y0 = (| + k — kK 4- 
“ • • •) ........... (29)
Thus A A-1. y0 is determined, and the calculation proceeds as in the previous 
case. It is to be noticed that, though (27) has been derived from (26) and 
(29) from (28), (26) can be used in conjunction with (29), giving a and 
a 4- (n 4-1) w as the limits of integration, or (28) with (27), giving a 4- nw as 
the upper limit and a 4- as the lower limit.

where m = n 4-’ as before. The lower limit c of the subject of the second 
integration is arbitrary. But if the first summation column, on the left of 
the function y, has been based on (29), c= a; if it has been based on (27), 
c = a + ^w. The lower limit b of the second integration is also arbitrary and 
corresponds with the additional arbitrary constant in the second summation 
column K~\ The latter is easily determined by taking the case b = a, n = 0 
of (30). Thus
0 = {K~y 4- K4-uoVw F2 — ...)y0....................(32)
This gives K"1 y0, and the whole of the second summation column becomes 
determinate when the first column has been fixed. Or again, if the lower 
limit b is to be a 4- jw, (31) gives when b = a 4- |w, m = j, n = 0,
0 — (1 +|A) (F~

or

This is quite general whatever the value of c, or of AST-1 y0, may be. But as 
c = b usually, (27) can be used in this case, and then
K-1 y0 = 
(1 + A) - Iyy (3 + 2A) K + ^%yy (5 + 3A) K2 - ...} y0.. .(34)
When the second summation column is based on (34) and the first on (27) 
x = a 4- jw is the common lower limit for the double integration. When 
(29) and (32) are used in forming these columns, x — a is the common lower 
limit. In either case (30) and (31) give the values of the double integrals 
to the upper limits x = a + nw and x = a 4- (n 4-1) w respectively.
No attention has been given here to the limitations of the method which 
are imposed by the conditions of convergence of the expansions employed. 
In general the question is settled in practice by obvious considerations. But 
for a critical estimate of the accuracy attainable it is clearly important.
294. 
There is also a trigonometrical form of interpolation, otherwise 
known as harmonic analysis, which is of great importance. This is intimately 
related to Fourier’s series, and indeed amounts to the calculation of the 
coefficients of this expansion. It will be well to recall the principal pro­
perties of the series, which may be stated thus:
The sum of the infinite series
a0 4- S (an cos nx 4- bn sin nx)

(n a positive integer), where

is f(x) throughout the interval 0 < x < 2tt, provided f (x) is continuous.
At any point x in the interval where f(x) is discontinuous, the sum of 
the series is J {f(x - 0) +f(x + 0)}.
It is assumed that the number of finite discontinuities and the number of 
maxima and minima of f(x) are finite. These conditions are more than 
sufficient and are always satisfied by the empirical functions of practical 
computation.
The expansion is unique in the sense that no other coefficients can make 
the given series represent the same function over the stated interval so long 
as n remains integral.
If the series is absolutely convergent for all real values of x it is also 
uniformly convergent. Its sum has then no discontinuities and has the 
same value at x = 0 and x = 2tf.
The sum of the series is a periodic function, with the period 2tt. If f (x) 
is also periodic with the same period, it coincides with the sum of the series 
for all values of x, but otherwise the functions coincide only in the interval 
0 < x < 2tt. If f (x) =f(—x) = f(x + 2?r), f(x) is represented by a Fourier 
series containing cosine terms only (bn = 0). If f(f) = — f(— x)=f(x+ 2tt), 
f(x) is represented completely by a series containing sine terms only 
(ao = an = O). Similarly an arbitrary function can be represented within 
the interval 0 to tt either by a sine series or by a cosine series when one of 
the functions + f (2tt — x) is assigned to the interval tt to 2ir.
295. 
When the function is given—and the term function has here an 
exceptionally wide meaning—the coefficients in its expression as a Fourier’s 
series can be calculated by a special kind of integrator, known as an Harmonic 
Analyser, of which several forms have been invented. But here the equivalent 
arithmetical processes will be considered.
When the function is represented by a definite number of distinct values 
it is obvious that only a finite number of terms in the series can be deter­
mined, and it is necessary to assume that the practical convergency of the 
series is such that the remainder after a certain point is negligible. Let the 
finite series be
n
u = aQ+ S (a{ cos id + b,- sin id) 
i=l
with 2n + 1 corresponding pairs of values, u = ur, d = dr. From the linear 
equations
ur = «0 + X (at cos idr + bt sin idr)

294-296] ■ Formulae of Numerical Calculation 
335
the coefficients a0, ait bt can be found in the ordinary way. It is also easy to 
represent the result by a formula analogous to Lagrange’s formula of inter­
polation (15). But when 3r = 2rn-/(2n 4-1) the solution can be effected in a 
very simple way.
It is necessary to consider the sums of two very simple series. In the 
first place 
«-i 
«-i
2 sin ra = 2 [cos (r — 1) a — cos (r 4-1) a} /2 sin |a 
r=o 
o
= [cos |a — cos(s — |) a}/2 sin |a
= sin |sa sin j (s — 1) a/sin |a
and this is 0 if a = 2pirfs. Even when p = p's, p and p being both integers, 
and therefore sin = 0, this remains true, for every term of the series is then 
zero. Similarly
2 cos ra = 2 [sin (r 4-1) a — sin (r — |) a}/2 sin |a 
r=0 
0
= [sin (s — |) a 4- sin ja}/2 sin |a
= sin |sacos|(s — 1) a/sin |a
and this is 0 also if a = 2pTrfs, unless/) =ps. In the latter case each term of 
the series is 1 and the sum is s. Thus both the series vanish for a = 2prr/s, 
except the cosine series when a = 2p'ir.
296. Let u = ur be the value of the function corresponding to the value 
of the argument 3 = ra. The series will not now be limited to a finite number 
of terms. Then
2 ur cos jra = a02 cos jra 4- 2 2 {aL cosjra cos ira 4- bi cos jra sin ira)

a multiple of s (including zero). Thus, J having in succession all values from

When s equidistant values, n0, ...» w«_i, (ug = u0), are known the operations 
indicated on the left are easily performed. Then, if the series converges so 
rapidly that the higher coefficients can be neglected, a„, aA, b1} ... are deter­
mined, as far as 
if « is odd, and as far as a±g, b^g_x if s is even.
The lower coefficients will naturally be calculated much more accurately than 
the higher, for there is little reason to suppose tqg+1 small in comparison with 
But it is well to compute the higher coefficients as a practical test of 
convergence.
297. It is usually convenient to make s an even number, and indeed a 
multiple of 4, so as to divide the quadrants symmetrically. Let s = 2n and 
let the terras of higher order than an, b^ be neglected. Then (35) become

The mode of solution for the harmonic coefficients can be con­
sidered from another point of view. Let the s equidistant values

be given as before, and let the first p harmonics—including ap, bp—be 
required. If 2p =s — 1, the number of unknowns is equal to the number of 
values and the solution is unique. . If 2p < s — 1, the number of equations is 
in excess of the number of coefficients to be determined. The latter can 
then be found by the rule of least squares, that is, so as to make the sum of 
the squared residuals a minimum. The equations being of the form

(j = 1, ..., p). But these are identical with the earlier equations of the group 
(35) when the distant harmonics are omitted. Hence the harmonics to any 
order p derived by the general rule (36) from 2?i equidistant values (p < n) 
are the same as would result from a least-square solution. Thus if the 
function is represented by a curve and the coefficients are calculated by the 
rule, a0 gives the best horizontal straight line, a0 4- <q cos 0 + bt sin 0 the 
closest simple sine curve, and so on, in the sense defined. This important 
property emphasises the independence with -which the several coefficients 
are determined. Each apart from the rest is found with the greatest possible 
accuracy from the data according to the principle of least squares.
300. The method can be extended to the development of a periodic 
function in two variables,
F= 'Zaij sin (i0 +j0' 4- a).
For this may be written
F = a0 4- S (at cos i0 4- bi sin i0) 
i
where a0, cq, bi are each of the same form as F with 0' in the place of 0. 
With any particular value of 0' and 2n equidistant values of F in respect 
to 0, a0, ai} bi can be determined according to the rule expressed by (36). Each 
of these is a function of the chosen value of 0', and if the process is repeated 
with 2n equidistant values of 0', each coefficient can be expressed in the 
form
aj = a0 4- S (a,- cos i0' 4- & sin i0') 
i
by the same rule. When these expressions are inserted in the second form 
of F, the first form is readily deduced. This method was employed by 
Le Verrier in his theory of Saturn.
