Chapter One 
Offshore Banking 
 
The offshore world is often cloaked in secrecy, the price for membership 
of this elite club is high, the techniques for offshore freedom, elusive, until 
now. 
 
This chapter was written to provide you, the reader with a series of easy to 
follow steps to opening and maintaining an offshore bank account, as 
well as obtaining debit and credit cards, establishing merchant accounts, 
and setting up online payment systems 
 
I will describe the different types of accounts that you can open and 
discuss ways of hiding your funds should anyone come looking for them. 
Everything is provided, from account opening forms, schedules of fees, 
benefits, and a complete analysis of each bank referenced in this book. 
 
By the end of it you will be able to open your own offshore account, 
manage and move funds in secrecy, and be part of the offshore world.

1. Introduction  
 
Since that fateful day – September 11 – things have changed 
considerably; the offshore world and those who participate in it are now 
viewed in the same regard as ‘arms dealer’.  
 
Opening offshore accounts, setting up offshore companies, not wanting 
the government to know every single detail of your life is not terrorism, it is 
the right of every free person. If it were not the case then many of our 
recognised politicians would be charged and incarcerated by now, 
where do you think they keep their money? 
 
Most people view this industry with scepticism and distrust and this is 
largely due to the cost involved in getting started. Many offshore 
consultants charge small fortunes to open an account. In fact one guy I 
know, charges $2500 to open a visa account, $1000 gets deposited in the 
account as its minimum opening balance and he pockets the other $1500 
for sending you two forms in the post. It is this kind of behaviour that gives 
the rest of us a bad name.  
 
So, rant over, let us begin.

2. So Why Go Offshore? 
 
There are a myriad of reasons, from hiding money from your spouse, to 
collecting profits from an on-line business. The most popular though, is 
avoiding the high rate of taxation in your home country. Many of my 
friendss are I.T. consultants living in Europe, they contract all over the 
world, and under regular circumstances would be required to pay tax on 
their income either in their place of work or back home. To get around this 
they set up an offshore business and invoice the local company directly 
from there. The payments are wired to their account and they have 
instant access to the funds via a regular ATM card. The small service fees 
for this kind of transaction are nothing compared with the high rate of tax 
they would have been paying otherwise. 
 
I am not saying this is one hundred percent legal in some countries but the 
fact of the matter is, if you do it properly, carefully, then the chance that 
anyone will ever find out is practically zero. 
 
Another good reason to go offshore is to protect your assets.  If they are 
offshore, and you were ever divorced, made bankrupt etc. the chances 
of them ever finding, let alone seizing them would be slim to none.

3. Offshore Agents and Big Brother 
 
As you can see the offshore world is a murky one. An alarming fact has 
recently come to the attention of myself and several other consultants 
that I know, and this is that some well known offshore providers have been 
‘pressed’ into providing information on their clients and the services that 
they have purchased from them. One guy who attends one of our regular 
conferences admitted that his boss sends full reports every time an 
account is opened for a client to a US based agency. 
 
This is why opening an account yourself, or opening several and passing 
the money between them reduces your risk. Only you and the bank know 
about this arrangement.  
 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
10 
4. Offshore Money Flow 
 
In a perfect world, offshore banks would offer one hundred percent 
secrecy, one hundred percent stability, and one hundred percent 
accessibility. Unfortunately this isn’t true, due to ever changing laws and 
regulations, and increasing pressure on offshore havens, maintaining 
secrecy whilst having instant access to your funds is a little more difficult 
than you may think. 
 
The answer though lies in the creation of several bank accounts. Each of 
these created for a specific purpose, and part of the overall money flow 
solution. 
 
The Three Accounts 
 
Below are listed the three type of accounts that should be created, and 
their function.  
 
1. The Pass-Through Account 
 
This will be the first type of account you will create. It should be in a 
jurisdiction that has total banking secrecy laws in place such as; Latvia, 
Antigua, Estonia, Grenada, or Venuatu. This is your front account, the 
account that you will give to your clients when they wish to pay you, this is 
also the account that you will use when you want to transfer money to 
someone else. This is as the name suggests, an account whose only 
purpose it to send or receive money.  
 
Typically you should rely on the smaller banking establishments as they 
generally provide far better secrecy and confidentiality than the larger 
ones. The stability of the jurisdiction and the bank is less important for this 
type of account as their will never be any great sums of cash sitting there 
for more that a few days. 
 
2. The Stash Account 
 
Your stash account should be opened in a stable jurisdiction with a 
reputable banking establishment. This account will be used to store the 
majority of your money, and receive funds from your stash account or 
other offshore investments. 
 
 
3. Spending Account 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
11 
 
Your spending account should be the most flexible of your three 
accounts, you should have a cash withdrawal facility using major ATM 
machines and probably a secured Visa or MasterCard. The primary 
function of this account is to provide you with an untraceable means of 
accessing your funds without having to do a wire transfer. Many providers 
will issue you a card with minimal or even no identification requirements. 
 
Take a look at the digram below to see how all your accounts fit together 
and the flow of funds between them.

Now that you have seen how the money flow solution works, lets take a 
look at how this can protect you.  
 
Imagine big brother, your spouse, or a business partner wanted to shut 
you down, the first step and potentially most painful would be to freeze 
your bank accounts.  Now given the fact that you are banking offshore, 
this is going to be a considerably difficult process. 
  
First of all the only account they know about is your Pass-Through account. 
The jurisdiction where this account is located will have some of the best 
banking secrecy laws in the world and it would require proof of a major 
offence such as money laundering or drug dealing for them to even 
consider freezing the account. Tax evasion or other similar crimes would 
not warrant any kind of action from them. 
 
But even assuming that they do manage to access this account, all they 
would find is an empty account with a couple of dollars. Next they would 
have to obtain records of everyone you have sent money to from that 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
12 
account. If you were clever, your stash account would be under a 
corporate name, assuming that you have paid several suppliers from your 
Pass-Through account, they would never know which was a legitimate 
supplier and which was you masquerading as a supplier. They would have 
to then attempt to freeze the accounts of all those paid from your 
account.  
 
Even if your stash account is discovered, they would then have to pressure 
the bank into freezing that account (this account would be in a different 
country and the whole process would have to be restarted) by which 
time you would have noticed that your Pass-Through account was frozen 
and would have transferred your funds elsewhere. This way your money 
will always be one step ahead, no matter what happens. 
 
Of course, I hope that you won't ever get into such a situation, but it can 
happen even if you are completely innocent - and thus it would make 
sense to be prepared now rather than to be taken by surprise later.  
 
As you can see, diversification is of extreme importance, that's why I 
advise you to open at least three different accounts. There is nothing to 
stop you opening five or ten accounts but always consider the difference 
between secrecy, stability and accessibility, and carefully evaluate how 
you can optimise your strategy by creatively taking advantage of these 
three principles!

5.  Jurisdictions & Banks 
 
Below is a list of countries that you should look into setting up accounts in, 
these are split into pass-though, stash, and accessibility jurisdictions, and 
should give you an idea of where to start researching. In the next section 
we will examine several different banks where you can easily and cost 
effectively establish an account. 
 
 
Secrecy Jurisdictions - For your Pass-Through Accounts  
 
 
Caribbean & Central America 
 
The Caribbean is home to some of the world's most well known offshore 
banking centers. Top banking secrecy ensures your complete privacy. 
Unfortunately, some of these havens are currently under considerable 
pressure from the US.  
 
Antigua: A small island but a big defender of freedom! Antigua has one of 
the very strongest banking legislations in the world. Check out the 
Barrington Bank which offers a variety of accounts and cards. Notarized 
identification and references required. 
 
Belize: The Provident Bank & Trust offers personal and corporate accounts 
and requires a detailed bank reference, and a notarised copy of your 
passport. Secured credit cards are available. 
 
Dominica: The Banc Caribe provides personal and corporate accounts as 
well as secured MasterCard's. Accounts can be opened online or by fax. 
A passport copy and a bank reference or professional reference is 
required. 
 
Grenada: The International Capital Bank offers a number of solid services 
including on-line accounts, debit cards, and loans. 
 
 
Eastern Europe  
 
Many Eastern European countries are now emerging as new democracies 
after having wasted decades as part of the Warsaw Pact or even the 
Soviet Union. These countries like Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia have 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
14 
recognized the international need for financial privacy and are offering 
some of the best banking secrecy laws in the world.  
 
The only major drawback is that most of these countries are planning to 
join the European Union. If this happens, it will result in downgraded 
banking secrecy. However, I do not recommend that these accounts are 
used as long-term accounts anyway, but rather as one of your initial Pass-
Through accounts. As soon as there is an indication that secrecy laws are 
actually going to be changed (maybe 5 or 10 years from now), you would 
simply establish another Pass-Through account in a different country.  
 
Latvia: Despite some bad experiences with Latvia's largest bank (the 
Parex Bank), I recommend Latvia for its excellent banking privacy laws. 
The 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
various 
Latvian 
banks 
are 
very 
comprehensive, with the exception of customer service where there's still 
a lot of potential for further improvement. If you need a solid Pass-Through 
account with no references required, then you might want to consider the 
Rietumu Bank. 
 
 
Montenegro: Due to an excellent, recently introduced offshore banking 
legislation it is fairly easy for the creative entrepreneur to start an offshore 
bank in this country. These banks operate outside Montenegro and offer 
personal, corporate and fully anonymous accounts.  
 
Middle East: The Middle East isn't exactly where most people would think 
about opening offshore accounts. This low profile, combined with strict 
banking privacy, offers excellent opportunities to operate below Big 
Brother's radar screen.  
 
Israel: Israel Discount Bank enables you to bank in privacy. Requires a 
notarised signature. (Note: For maximum security, don't use this bank if you 
are a US citizen or resident as they do have several branches in the US). 
 
 
Stability Jurisdictions - For your Store Accounts  
 
 
Western Europe  
 
The European Union (EU) is trying hard to become Big Brother's Little 
Brother (Big Brother being the US), but it is our belief that due to Europe's 
unique and diversified culture these plans will fail in the long term. Despite 
frequently announced "tax harmonization plans" and the like, the actual 
implementation of a "United Europe" is many years away, and even then it 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
15 
will only concern EU citizens and residents. Europe is home to some of the 
most stable banks in the world which won't disappear overnight - so why 
not take advantage of this!  
 
Denmark: Banking privacy in this country is not as strong as elsewhere, 
however there is one reputable and stable bank, the Jyske Bank, which 
has very liberal identification requirements and offers excellent investment 
services. Minimum opening deposit is $15,000. Visa card available. 
 
Ireland: This former offshore haven has cracked down on its Irish non-
resident companies some time ago. Still, the new and progressive Fsharp 
Bank calls Ireland its home. They offer excellent online services but don't 
accept US, UK and Canadian residents as clients. References and utility 
bill required.  
 
 
Channel Islands  
 
These small islands between England and France - the Isle of Man, Jersey 
and Guernsey - have long been traditional offshore havens. They're part 
of the UK, but not of the EU. Still, both the UK and the EU are trying to 
destroy these havens by having them comply with their downgraded 
banking secrecy standards. So strong is this pressure that these islands are 
now seriously considering to declare independence! If you aren't an EU 
citizen or resident then the Channel Islands are recommended, if not for 
banking secrecy (which is under attack) - then definitely because of the 
stability of their banks. Without a doubt, these are some of the most 
reputable and stable offshore banks in the world!  
 
Isle of Man & Jersey: Lloyds TSB is a major, well known offshore bank that 
offers excellent services. They do want to know a lot about you and 
require a notarized passport copy and a notarised utility bill. Also, if you 
desire a Visa card they will even demand income statements! It's still worth 
requesting an account opening package and information about their 
Overseas Club. Minimum opening deposit is between $100 and $200, 
depending on what currency you open your account in. (Available are 
USD, GBP and Euro accounts)  
 
The Standard Bank Offshore is a South African bank with branches on the 
Isle of Man and Jersey. They offer personal and corporate accounts as 
well as Visa debit cards. Notarized passport or driver's license copy and an 
original utility bill (or bank statement) is required.  
 
  

The Essential Underground Handbook 
16 
Jersey: Abbey National Offshore offers the High Yield Cheque and Savings 
Accounts  
 
Jersey: The Royal Bank of Canada is a major offshore bank and offers 
excellent private banking services. 
 
 
 
Accessibility Options - For your Spend Accounts  
 
Bahamas: As long as you are not too concerned about privacy and just 
need a card to spend your money, take a look at Axxess International, 
they offore a range of secured Visa cards with a variety of limits. (See Next 
Section)   
 
Mexico: We can arrange a limited number of personal Mexican bank 
accounts which include a prestigious MasterCard Gold debit card. The 
opening fee for this is only $1,200, and the bank needs an opening 
deposit of $2,000 which you can put straight on your MasterCard and 
spend it immediately if you like. The account is kept in Mexican Pesos, and 
the bank is Mexico's largest and most reputable one.  Please email us for 
details. 
 
 
Countries to Avoid - Big Brother's Little Brothers  
 
Bahamas: In an unofficial agreement, the Bahamas have caved in to U.S. 
pressure and have agreed to divulge to the IRS and to the C.C.R.A. 
(former 
Revenue 
Canada) 
information 
on 
beneficial 
owners 
of 
corporations, holders of personal bank accounts etc.  
  
Bermuda: This UK dependency is readily cooperating with the US and the 
UK, even in tax matters. They have no income tax but still made tax 
evasion a crime. Shortly after giving in to Big Brother, their formerly 
prosperous economy stumbled as funds were and still are leaving the 
island. Beware!  
  
Cayman Islands: They are one of the most well known offshore havens 
and on every tax agency's "target list". They have also agreed to end their 
tax haven status by 2005. Beware!  
  
Cyprus, Malta, Mauritius and San Marino: Another four formerly popular 
offshore havens which have decided to join the "fight" against "unfair" tax 
competition.  

The Essential Underground Handbook 
17 
 
Switzerland: Swiss banking privacy is no longer what it used to be, the 
bank are much keener to co-operate with International agencies, but if 
you are only hiding money from the IRS then you should still be pretty safe.

A NOTE ON IDENTITY DOCUMENTS 
For the record I don’t condone the production of fake identity documents 
or other required documents but needless to say, sending a scanned or 
photocopied document that has been altered in some way in Photoshop

opening (if you know what I mean)

7. Merchant Services 
 
To successfully escape offshore you need to find an alternative source of 
income. Typically if you are offering products or services you will need to 
take payment via Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Below we 
take a look at the different options you have to becoming a merchant. 
 
The Merchant Account 
 
Getting a merchant account if you are a US citizen is a relatively easy 
process and usually takes less than 48 hours. The disadvantage to this is 
that if you are trying to hide your funds offshore and you have a US 
merchant account which is tied directly to your name then the IRS is going 
to know about it, and your money wont be yours for much longer. 
 
Also Visa have introduced a new pricing schemes to comply (in their 
mind) with the Homeland Security Act, meaning you have to pay Visa 
$750 for the privilege of processing a form… I don’t think so. So what other 
options do you have… 
 
The Reseller Account 
 
This type of account is similar to a merchant account but with none of the 
hassle. The reseller provides you with the ability to process cards etc, they 
are the merchant and technically wholesaling your good for you and in 
return charge you a percentage typically ranging from 5% - 15%. 
 
If you are a US citizen then you still have to pay the Visa fee, but by using 
an offshore credit card to open the account, together with an 
anonymous offshore maildrop you can get around this… and at the same 
time, hide your money from the IRS. 
 
Merchant Account Providers 
 
There are a large number of companies on the Internet who will get you 
set up with a merchant account. Below are some links to companies 
offering this service. 
 
Charge.com 
 
This company offers one of the best merchant services with free setup, 
free application, a free shopping cart, free technical support, and a host 

The Essential Underground Handbook

of other things. Any business type accepted. Charge.com have over 
75,000 existing customers and provide a quick and efficient setup. 
 
Visit them by clicking here. 
 
ACS Credit Card Merchant Services  
 
Another very good merchant account provider with friendly and efficient 
staff. 
 
 
Reseller Account Providers 
 
There are now a considerable number of providers in the market, some 
better than others, below is a list of payment processors that we have 
used and would recommend.  
 
Glo-Bill.com 
These are one of the few providers that don’t charge a setup fee. After 
completing their application form you can be up and running and selling 
products in under an hour. 
 
For more information on Glo-Bill.com and to sign up click here 
 
MultiCards.com 
Another good payment processor with variety of charge bands to suit 
your business. Setup fees start at $15 and you can accept the following 
cards: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Diners Club, JCB, Carte 
Blanche, and Discover. 
 
For more information on MultiCards.com and to sign up click here 
 
 
PaySystems.com 
With one of the lowest commission rates in the business and a simple setup 
service, PaySystems are becoming one of the leaders in the reselling 
business. Setup costs are $49.95 but you can also use their shopping cart / 
catalog system to manage your store. PaySystems also has a good 
backend sales monitoring system. The only disadvantage to using 
PaySystems is that transactions are approved instantly but can be 
revoked over a 48 period so goods should not be shipped etc until the 
transaction is marked complete.

8. Other Payment Services 
 
There are several other payment services out there which you can use to 
receive money on your site. The three below are probably the most used 
of these. 
 
E-Gold 
Receive payment in Gold and other precious metals, yes it seems weird 
but it works remarkably well, and best of all its anonymous. Basically, users 
of the service can purchase Gold using their credit cards and then the 
gold can be sent to merchants as payment. Due to the anonymity of the 
E-Gold transactions you will find that most companies offering offshore 
services readily accept this form of payment. 
 
PayPal 
Probably the most established payment facilitator on the Internet, PayPals 
service is very good and provides a range of billing options for one off 
sales and subscriptions and its easy account opening makes it a valuable 
addition to any online store.

9. Confidential Check Cashing Services  
 
Good anonymous check cashing services are few an far between, 
currently we can only recommend one of these service, we are 
constantly on the look out for new service providers and as a purchaser of 
this book you will receive free updates as and when they become 
available. 
 
The service we recommend is:

Subscribe to one of their individual or business basic packages. You would 
then allow them to endorse checks made payable to you over to YVO 
and they would credit your escrow account by the same amount, less 
applicable check cashing fees. Your options would then be to: 
 
1. Request the return of said funds in Federal Reserve Notes ("cash") 
or in totally blank U.S. postal money order(s); 
2. Forward bills which you want them to pay on your behalf, or; 
3. Designate specified purchases or contributions to be made for 
you.

Second Identities 
 
Creating a second identity can protect you from the aggressive and 
potentially dangerous controls of your Government. In this chapter we will 
look at Second Passports, Citizenships, Banking Passports, Alternative 
Identity Documents and more.  
 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook

1. Second Passports and Citizenship 
 
A second passport can bring you freedom from the shackles of any one 
government! The fact that you are reading this proves that you have 
already realized that you are a tenant of Planet Earth and not the 
property of any "government". However, as long as they can track you 
and your assets and detain both with growing ease you *are* effectively 
their property, whether you like it or not!   
 
Your government does not want you to be freely shopping the planet for 
a passport or citizenship program based on "features and benefits". They 
would much rather have you continue producing fruits for them as "citizen 
slaves" in a relationship that, by definition and implementation, always 
benefits only one side - the State!   
 
They do not want your assets out of their reach - they want to be able to 
confiscate them at will. They want to be able to infiltrate any offshore 
banking institution, attorney's office, and trust structure in order to "identify" 
the records and funds of "their" citizens!  
 
They do not want to allow you to freely travel wherever you want - but 
rather track and restrict your travel, limit your stays, and even be able to 
prevent you from traveling at all.  
 
So it should not come as a surprise they DO NOT want you to even be 
thinking about getting a second passport! 
 
So with that in mind, lets take a look at the different types of passports 
available. 
 
 
Passport Types 
 
The types of passport programs that are available can be easily divided 
into three areas:  
 
Black Area: 
Illegal 
Grey Area: 
Kind of legal 
White Area: 
Fully Legal 
 
 
Black Area 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
60 
The illegal passport market still exists today, in fact the majority of offerings 
that you may see being promoted on bulletin boards, or on web sites 
hosted on free servers, and even in the back of some economic and 
business magazines fit this category.   
 
This area is also the most dangerous for the consumer. Not only are the 
programs illegal - but those selling them tend to be the least reliable, and 
many (if not most) are simply rip-off artists.   
 
Of course there could be a need in a time of crisis, and it might be 
beneficial to know that this market exists, but once you understand the 
abundance of legal and easily obtainable programs you will find no need 
to deal in this marketplace examples of back area passports are:-   
 
 
Stolen Passports 
 
Years ago a market existed for stolen and altered passports. The thief stole 
it to order and changed the picture. But due to the wealth of anti-tamper 
and security features built into a modern passport, getting a good quality 
and passable passport that has been provided in this way is almost 
impossible, 
 
 
Fake Passports   
 
This is another area where technology has made things virtually 
impossible. Check out your passport under ultraviolet light and you will see 
just how sophisticated today's passports have become. Ultraviolet checks 
are now so commonplace at many border crossings that you would never 
get away with using a fake passport.   
 
 
Stolen Blanks 
 
These are exactly what the name implies - stolen and unregistered blanks. 
Some passport office worker, diplomat or embassy employee steals 10 or 
20 blank passports and "issues" them himself, without registering them in 
government computers.   
 
These usually work fine as long as you don't enter the country of issuance, 
and as long as no one realizes that this particular passport is "missing".  
 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
61 
Registered Passports   
 
These passports are issued just like regular ones. The corrupt official simply 
goes through a regular application process and registers everything in 
government computers (usually at night). Of course, he fills out the 
application form himself on behalf of his "client", and the details on the 
"birth certificate", "proof of address" etc. that he enters into the computer 
only exist in his imagination. This process results in a passport that is fully 
registered.   
 
Many countries have now introduced new procedures to avoid this kind 
of "secret business". Applications are now checked and double-checked 
and the chance of such an application not being detected is very small 
in most countries.  
 
 
Ghosting Passports   
 
This is basically stealing the identity of someone else and usually involves 
acquiring the birth certificate of a dead child or a mentally retarded 
person, both of which are extremely unlikely to ever apply for a passport.  
 
An application for a passport is then sent off and if you are lucky a brand 
new passport arrives in the mail. Understandably this is a know method 
and passport offices are now starting to cross reference birth and death 
records when processing the application. Just think, if they found your 
application was fake then they would have a perfect mug shot to send to 
the police.  
 
 
Grey Area  
 
We are big believers in traditions and customs, particularly when they 
support our privacy goals and objectives. And there exists today a 
wonderful opportunity in an area we refer to as "Discretionary Programs", 
this is the Grey area. 
 
 
Friendly Bureaucrats  
 
Especially in third world countries, exchanging favors for favors is still an 
acceptable way of life. Bureaucrats in these countries often have the 
power to grant citizenship in exchange for a favor given by the applicant. 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
62 
Naturally, this favor can consist of a cash payment. These programs often 
include naturalization certificates and sometimes even birth certificates.   
 
While some have a knee jerk reaction to the idea of giving a direct 
payment to a politician in return for the granting of a discretionary favor, 
you need to understand that this is not only a tolerated situation in the 
countries allowing such discretionary power, but it is in fact one of the 
"benefits" of holding the political position and an acceptable subsidy to 
their otherwise modest government checks!   
 
It's the "good old boys" network in full glory: Buy them a drink, a good 
cigar, talk some business, and hand them an envelope! And the best part 
is they can openly do it - they have the discretion and they will use it when 
properly motivated.   
 
However, this is not a "free for all" process. If these people are going to 
exercise their discretion, they will only do so if it will not adversely affect 
their good name. So these types of arrangements typically involve a 
screening process by a trusted third party who then "lobbies" on behalf of 
the applicant.   
 
These passports work like any other legally issued passport and can even 
be used to live in the country of issuance.   
 
There is very little risk to this form of application but if the "power holder" 
grossly abuses their authority or otherwise falls from political grace there is 
a remote chance that their discretionary decisions could be retroactively 
reviewed.   
 
This risk can be minimized by focusing on programs where the power 
holder is at one of the highest government levels and is very discreet in 
their use of authority.  
 
 
National Interest  
 
Most countries in the world, even first world countries, are more than 
willing to grant instant citizenship through fully legal means if it is in the 
"national interest" that they do so.   
 
To go through this route, just identify and influence the decision makers 
and you're on your way! In first world countries they will not normally 
accept cash payments, but if you can offer the country a substantial 
contribution of a different nature you might have a reasonable chance to 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
63 
acquire their citizenship without spending any money at all.   
 
We list this in the "grey" area as this power to grant instant citizenship is not 
normally given to the bureaucrats through their country's constitution. 
However, in this day and age it is normal practice for most countries NOT 
to obey their own constitution. They will usually claim that it is in the 
"national interest" not to do so. Do you see the parallel?   
 
  
White Area  
 
Official Fast-Track Citizenship Programs  
 
There are a few countries that offer an economic citizenship program that 
enables you to acquire citizenship usually within a few days or weeks if 
you pay a certain amount of money to the government. Alternatively, you 
will be required to invest money in a certain type of business in the country 
in question.   
 
Countries offering such official programs have a clause in their constitution 
that 
enables 
bureaucrats 
to 
grant 
instant 
citizenship 
if 
certain 
requirements are met. It's basically the same as "Friendly Bureaucrats" as 
above, only that these programs are usually a lot more expensive and are 
fully backed by the country's constitution. This ensures that once you have 
citizenship there is little risk that subsequent governments might reverse the 
process and kick you out again.    
 
 
Diplomatic Programs  
 
An interesting variation of the white programs is a diplomatic 
appointment. Obviously, any government has the power to appoint 
honorary diplomats and issue them a diplomatic passport. In some cases 
they will even arrange for a naturalization certificate, but this usually falls 
into the grey area (see "National Interest").    
 
 
Which One To Chose 
 
If you're on a small budget you might be tempted to go for a "black" 
passport. If a country's "white" program costs $2,000,000 and a bureaucrat 
offers to bend the rules and let you have it for $25,000, it's not a bad deal 
even though it's not legal. Many people seem to consider this option 
especially if they just need it for banking purposes, visa-free travel, or to 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
64 
hide money from the wife.   
 
Nevertheless, we strongly recommend that you stay away from these 
programs, instead, have a good look at the variety of readily available 
"grey" programs first, and then ask yourself whether a "black" program is 
worth the risk!   
 
Generally, a "grey" program offers almost all of the benefits of the "white" 
programs, none of the drawbacks of the "black" programs, and often 
costs less than either!   
 
If you have a very high profile and a lot of money you might want to 
consider one of the "white" programs.   
 
 
Grab and Run  
 
Acquiring a black passport is basically a "grab and run" venture.                 
No one trusts anyone in this "business" - as both the client and the supplier 
could be scamsters, or part of a government sting operation.   
 
We strongly discourage you from going through any of the black 
programs; due to the shady nature of these programs the marketplace is 
penetrated by scamsters and fraudsters who take your money and run. 
An estimated 85% of all offers you see for black passports are either 
outright scams or sting operations, and you will never see your money 
again, nor your promised passport. Even if you do eventually obtain a 
black passport, it will usually not give you the freedom you expected, but 
a headache for the rest of your life!   
 
Usually only people whose life depends on it should consider these 
programs - but even if you are in such an unfortunate situation there are 
better (and fully legal) options available.   
 
 
Greasing The Palms  
 
Acquiring a grey "discretionary" program is much more reasonable. Unless 
you are very well connected and have substantial resources, you would 
normally focus on second and third world countries as they tend to make 
it pretty easy to get what you're looking for.   
 
You should consider these programs if you want a second passport for 
travel, residency or banking 
purposes. Most 
programs are per 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
65 
naturalization only, but there are a few that will result in the issuance of a 
birth certificate and thus give you a completely new identity.   
 
You can get full citizenship in a good and peaceful third world country for 
around $15,000. Prices for second world programs usually start at around 
$25,000.   
 
 
Squeaky Clean  
 
White programs are protected by the issuing country's constitution and 
are thus 100% legal. There are only a few countries in the world that offer 
such a fast track economic citizenship program. Prices start at $30,000 for 
a 
particular 
third 
world 
with 
reasonably 
good 
visa-free 
travel 
opportunities. In the upper range you can expect to invest up to several 
million dollars.   
 
Watch out for scams here as well - there is a European country that 
requires you to invest a million dollars before they will even consider your 
application! There is no guarantee that you will be approved.

2. Frequently Asked Questions 
 
Below are some of the questions we are frequently asked when providing 
information on second passports and citizenship. 
 
Q: Are there any particular countries that it is very advantageous to have 
a second passport for, or are all second passports 'equal'?   
 
A: Some passports are better than others! Look for the following features 
before acquiring a second passport:   
 
Visa-free travel: Does the country of your new citizenship restrict you from 
traveling to certain other countries? Will the passport allow you to travel to 
your favorite countries without having to obtain a visa?   
 
Grip on non-residents: Does the country care what you do when you are 
a non-resident and live outside their borders? Do they require you to 
prove that you are resident somewhere else before they will no longer 
require you to pay taxes? Do they require that you file an annual tax 
return no matter where you are?   
 
The following applies if you intend to live in the country:   
 
Grip on residents: Does the country have a personal income tax or any 
other excessive taxes? Do they force your children (and possibly yourself) 
to serve in the military for a certain period of time? Is the general climate 
in the country litigious? Is the country in the grip of Big Brother? What kind 
of privacy is there in the country?   
 
Climate & Life: Is the weather reasonable and suitable for your health? Is 
the air clean? How about the water? Does the country offer a reasonable 
standard of life?   
 
Q: If I have an opportunity to have a US passport, is it wise to take it 
considering the restrictions for US citizens?   
 
A: In our opinion it is not wise at all. US passports are nowadays regarded 
as a liability, not as an asset. Many people who obtain a US passport 
realize that they are much worse off than before, and try to rid themselves 
of it as quickly as possible! Worldwide taxation, danger of being assaulted 
almost anywhere in the world due to the US government's aggressive role 
as a world policeman, not being allowed to travel to certain countries 
(Cuba, Lybia etc), etc. - all this has made the US passport one of the least 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
67 
attractive ones.  
 
 
Q: Is it safe to obtain a second passport if someone lives in a country that 
banned second citizenship?   
 
A: It depends on your particular circumstances. Almost no country that 
you acquire citizenship from notifies your original country - thus they would 
never need to learn that you now also have another citizenship. Of 
course, to be on the safe side, you could renounce (or simply abandon) 
your old citizenship. Again, whether this is feasible or not depends on your 
current country, circumstances, plans for the future etc.   
 
Q: How can I test whether a second passport I recently received is legal 
and fully registered?   
 
A: You could use the "WG Hill Method", which consists of asking a major 
company, preferably in a third world country, to send a letter along with a 
copy of your passport to your passport country's local embassy, essentially 
saying: "This person has applied for a job with very serious responsibilities, 
please let us know whether his documents check out with your records 
and whether he has anything against him". This method is often used by 
major companies so it doesn't raise any attention. The disadvantage is 
that with some countries, such an inquiry might result in your documents 
being flagged for further investigation, income tax checks etc. If your 
documents and supporting records are only 99% legal (still perfectly 
usable under most circumstances), this might start the very troubles you 
wanted to be safe from in the first place. There are other, more 
confidential ways to check a passport which unfortunately we cannot 
reveal here. If you have acquired a second passport and would like some 
assistance in checking its validity then please contact us. 
 
Q: Sometimes consultants ask for substantial amounts of money up-front - 
what if the prepaid service is not delivered?   
 
A: This happens fairly frequently and unless you want the authorities to get 
involved, it's just a matter of bad luck. If someone asks for money up-front 
and you aren't comfortable with the risk, ask them whether they will 
accept an escrow arrangement, or if they can provide you with suitable 
references. If they agree to an escrow service, find a reputable agent to 
handle the escrow. If they don't agree, and they can't provide you with 
any solid references either, don't do business with them. With most "white" 
programs the government itself (or one of its attorneys) will act as escrow 
agent.   

The Essential Underground Handbook 
68 
 
Q: In the 1950's some totalitarian governments destroyed the passports of 
their citizens returning to the home country. How would you avoid such a 
situation if this were ever to happen again?   
 
A: By not returning to the home country in the first place. If you have to 
return, obtain a passport from a different country in a different name, and 
only then return.   
 
Q: I heard that the German and Irish (any other?) governments will allow 
second citizenship to foreign-born persons of German or Irish ancestry. 
True?   
 
A: Partially - Germany does not allow second citizenship so you would 
have to renounce your current citizenship in order to obtain your German 
passport. Other than that, if some of your grandparents are/were Irish or 
German you could have a good chance of acquiring citizenship.   
 
Q: I am a US businessman who travels to a lot of potentially hostile 
countries. Is it possible to get a second passport from a less "aggravating" 
country than the USA and still have it known and recognized by the USA 
as a legitimate passport?   
 
A: Definitely yes. You could obtain second citizenship from a low-profile 
Caribbean country and use that one to travel abroad. You could even 
take both passports with you, using the US passport to leave and reenter 
the US, and the Caribbean passport to travel abroad. The passports of 
most countries in the world are fully recognized by the US, and the US also 
"allows" their citizens to have dual citizenship, so you have a lot of choices 
available!   
 
Q: What is truly the cheapest?   
 
A: By far the cheapest we have heard of is a legitimate African passport 
at $5,000.   
 
Q: How long does it take to get the cheapest?   
 
A: Four to six weeks upon receipt of photos and payment.   
 
Q: Will a second passport have exactly the same name as your first 
passport?   
 
A: With some programs, yes. With others, it can be in a different name if 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
69 
you like. The white programs usually require that you use your name, but 
even then you can sometimes legally change your name to a different 
one. Most grey programs allow name change without too many 
bureaucratic hassles.   
 
Q: Will I be able to leave on the 1st passport and come back on the 2nd 
passport?   
 
A: You will most definitely be able to do so. Whether this is fully legal 
depends on a number of circumstances, regulations etc. For example, 
some countries have the requirement that if you are a dual citizen you 
must identify yourself as a citizen when entering or leaving the country.   
 
Q: Most of the second passport schemes come with a very high cost. Is 
there any that are available through an investment program, rather than 
an ex gratia payment to a government or agency. I understand some 
countries will grant passports and citizenship to people who have a 
certain amount invested in that country - do you know of any such cases.   
 
A: Austria is one such case, but it rather falls into the "scam" category. 
Here's how it works: First you must invest between $500k and $1M into a 
certain type of business within Austria. Once you've made the investment 
they will review your application and decide whether you'll be accepted 
for the fast-track citizenship or not. If not, your money is tied up and you'll 
have to wait the normal 5+ years until you obtain citizenship, provided of 
course that you become a permanent resident!   
 
Q: What is the best way of finding out which of the people in power would 
be most likely to accept an offer for a grey area passport. In other words is 
there any way of becoming connected when you are not already, 
without getting involved with scammers, sting operations, or somebody 
who is not actually likely to accept an offer and possibly even be a rat.   
 
A: The best way to do it yourself is usually to travel to the country in 
question and try to get acquainted with bureaucrats and politicians. 
Maybe you can make friends with them and hint that a friend of yours is 
looking for fast- track citizenship... would they know someone who can 
help him?   
 
Get the idea? It's more diplomatic to ask "on behalf of a friend" - and 
once they are committed to assisting you, you can always say that you 
too might be interested. Hey, you could even get them to help you twice 
and resell the second set to a friend at twice the price, thereby effectively 
getting yours for free. But be careful - we have heard of many incidents of 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
70 
"power holders" taking money and not delivering what they had 
promised. You have very little recourse once you've parted with the 
money.   
 
Q: How can one start using the new passport to leave a country if the 
passport has no visa and entry stamp to that country?   
 
A: Simple - if the passport is in a *different* name, you usually can't, unless 
you walk across the border without being checked. The solution is to use 
your current passport to travel to a country that does not stamp passports 
from the country your second passport is from, and leave your current 
passport there while starting to travel on the new one. Ideally, your first 
passport wouldn't be stamped either so you can switch back and forth as 
you like.   
 
Q: Assuming I have two passports, continuing the question above, does it 
mean I should/can only "switch" passports when "in- between" countries 
i.e. always leave on same passport as entry passport and switch to 
second passport when entering the second country?   
 
A: If your two passports are in the *same* name (i.e. dual citizenship) then 
this is the correct way to do it. If the passports are in *different* names, it is 
still possible but outright dangerous! If you are checked out by 
immigration or customs in any country and they find out that you have 
two passports in different names on you, you will have a lot to explain 
(and usually be given plenty of time to do so).   
 
Q: What are the financial qualifications for getting Swiss citizenship? Are 
there other countries that are as good or better for getting citizenship: as 
far as financial freedoms (especially from the IRS)?   
 
A: In this day and age, Swiss citizenship is hard to obtain and not 
recommended at all. If you value your freedom and privacy we highly 
recommend a Caribbean or Latin American country that offers good visa-
free travel and has no personal income tax.   
 
Q: Is it not simply against all law or common sense to have a second 
passport?   
 
A: Not at all - as for the law, if you are a US citizen then it is fine (check 
with your countries consulate). As for common sense, consider the 
following *imaginary* situation: Half a year from now the US could be 
declaring martial law and shooting its citizens who try to leave the 
country. Only foreigners will be allowed to leave the country that has 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
71 
turned into hell on earth. Guess who will be able to create the impression 
of being a foreigner? Those lucky people who were wise enough to 
acquire a second passport while there was still time to do so!   
 
Q: If you can have a second passsport, then you cannot fault the terrorist 
or illegal immigrant who has come to this country under such means, can 
you? Your comments?   
 
A: Most people who have the means to acquire a *legal* second 
passport want to *leave* the US, not enter it. Terrorists and illegal 
immigrants most likely use *illegal* documents which they have obtained 
through a fraudulent application process. Note the difference between 
legal and illegal! You wouldn't outlaw all knives and rely on your hands to 
cut bread, meat etc., just because criminals use knives to kill other 
people, would you?   
 
Q: How difficult is it to obtain a fully legal, legitimate EU passport?   
 
A: It is quite easy if you are prepared to live (and pay taxes) in a EU 
member country for a couple of years, learn the local language, and 
then obtain a passport through naturalization.   
 
Q: Failing this, what about for countries lobbying for membership?   
 
A: Same thing - live there for a couple of years, learn the language and 
they will usually offer you citizenship! Of course, there are fast-track 
options available, but these cost a lot of money and are very 
controversial, to say the least.   
 
Q: If I acquire second citizenship, are my children eligible too?   
 
A: Usually yes. Sometimes there might be an extra fee.  

The Essential Underground Handbook 
72 
 
Bonus Tip: Free Passports 
 
In certain circumstances you can get a passport completely free of 
charge. This is usually possible on ethnic or religious grounds. To determine 
your likelihood of being able to obtain a free passport we suggest you list 
all foreign family connections and religious possibilities over the last 
hundred years. For example, if you are Jewish we can recommend a path 
to gain an Israeli passport, or for dedicated Buddhists a Thai passport is a 
definite possibility.  
 
On ethnic grounds the list of possibilities is very substantial, for example 
ethnic Germans from the Volga in Russia are returning to Germany and 
are granted citizenship, even though their ancestors left over 200 years 
ago. In the case of Ireland, more people entitled to an Irish passport live 
outside Ireland than in the country itself! Plus, people born in northern 
Ireland can also easily obtain an Irish passport from the South.   
 
Another obvious possibility is marriage with someone who already holds 
your desired citizenship. It should be easy to find someone who is 
interested in a marriage of convenience, especially if you are wealthy or 
attractive, or both.   
 
Note: Many countries either make random checks or require you to 
complete some sort of written or oral test (where you must answer 
questions about your spouse's habits etc.) to make sure that you are 
indeed involved with each other and aren't just married on paper. If you 
cheat and they find out, your new citizenship will be renounced, and 
you'll be banned from ever acquiring it again. So watch out!

3. Banking Passports 
 
A banking passport is simply a legal passport from a country and in a 
name other than your current one. It is a passport you use for banking, i.e. 
to open and operate bank accounts, and to own property. As 
inexpensive banking passports typically require a visa to travel to almost 
any country in the world, they are not normally used for travel.  
 
A banking passport is cheap and most often from a poor third world 
country. These countries can raise money by giving away passports to 
those who are willing to pay for them. There are a few semi-official 
programs; others are run by entrepreneurial bureaucrats. In these 
countries, doing such favors for cash is well accepted and not necessarily 
illegal.  
 
Banking passports typically cost $7,000 or less. Anything over $10,000 
would normally no longer be considered a banking passport if it could 
also be used for travel. It would then simply be a second passport. Of 
course, every second passport can be used as a banking passport as well.  
 
 
Why bother?  
 
The answer to this question becomes obvious when you consider that a US 
passport is considered to be the most dangerous in the world. Not only will 
you be targeted by terrorists, but also by terrocrats (i.e. terroristic 
bureaucrats)! If you open offshore bank accounts using a US passport, 
sooner or later you might get into serious trouble.  
 
Why? It's simple. The IRS and FBI are actively pressuring offshore havens to 
turn over banking records of their American clients. And they are trying to 
infiltrate banks in those havens they cannot openly force into submission. 
There are rumors that they have even set up their own offshore bank in 
the Caribbean in order to attract clients and then turn them in.  
 
Now, the IRS is hardly interested in the finances of a citizen of some poor 
third world country. Even if they manage to infiltrate a bank, or you fall for 
one of their scams, then having used such a passport could mean the 
difference between freedom and slavery.  
 
We all know what happened to those unlucky clients of a former Cayman 
Island Bank whose owner volunteered to turn over client records to the 
IRS, in exchange for a less severe penalty for an unrelated crime.

Thousands of Americans were investigated, hundreds were jailed. 
Investigations are still ongoing. What would have happened to them if 
they had used an African passport in a name other than their own, and 
an African mailing address? Nothing. Think about it.  
 
 
Why not to use camouflage passports  
 
Camouflage passports are passports which look like those from countries 
that no longer exist. British Honduras, the Soviet Union and Rhodesia are 
just a few examples. Anyone can legally make up such passports, or buy 
them for a few hundred dollars. However, banks throughout the world 
have woken up to this, and they have very up-to-date lists of all countries 
in the world. They are simply not going to accept account applications 
from persons who use a passport from a non-existing country. What's 
worse, they might flag them down for further investigation.  
 
What's still worse than that, they might initially accept the application and 
make you believe that everything is alright. Later, when you have 
deposited tens of thousands of dollars, they would suddenly freeze your 
account, saying that they "just" discovered that you've used an invalid 
passport... "Would you please come forward to prove that the passport is 
issued by a genuinely existing country!"   Money gone!  
 
The common argument for a camouflage passport is that it can be useful 
when your plane is hijacked or similar. Proving that you aren't American in 
such a situation (by flashing your camouflage passport) can supposedly 
save your life. Actually, most bureaucrats from unpopular countries like US 
and UK who travel internationally have one or several such camouflage 
passports, and they know only too well why.  
 
Unfortunately, the terrorists are catching up too! Just imagine the following 
situation. Your plane is hijacked and Americans are singled out. You show 
your Rhodesian camouflage passport... but the hijackers happen to know 
that Rhodesia ceased existence over 20 years ago! They strip-search your 
body and find your US passport. Guess who will be the very first hostage to 
be shot? (To add insult to injury, they might even assume that you're a 
bureaucrat or diplomat as these are the people to most likely carry 
camouflage passports.)  
 
If you find yourself in such an unpleasant situation, we recommend that 
you either blend in with the crowd - if you're on a plane with several 
hundred US citizens, your individual risk of being killed is rather low. 
Alternatively, get a full citizenship from a non-controversial country in the 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
75 
first place... a country that actually exists and whose passport enables you 
to travel wherever you want to. Then you can leave your US passport at 
home - or even renounce it.  
 
 
Registered or unregistered?  
 
For banking purposes, you need to use a registered passport from an 
existing country. All legal banking passports are fully registered with the 
issuing country, so even in case of an official inquiry the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs would respond that the passport is indeed genuine and that the 
holder is a bona fide citizen. Considering that it is possible to obtain such 
legal, fully registered passports for as little as $5,000, it would be a big 
mistake to obtain an unregistered passport for a few hundred dollars less, 
trying to "save money".  
 
 
Security precautions  
 
Obviously, you do not want to receive or store the banking passport at 
your current home. Don't even let it enter your home country! Instead, set 
up an offshore mail drop address or box where you receive the passport 
and other sensitive mail. After having opened the bank accounts you 
need, store the passport in an offshore safe deposit box and never, 
repeat never take it back home! Depending on the country where you 
are at any given moment, there might be very stiff penalties for being 
found in possession of two "conflicting" passports (i.e. in different names), 
even if they are both legally issued.  
 
 
Where to get banking passports  
 
There are various sources on the Internet of Banking Passports, doing a 
search on Google will yield numerous results but our best advice would be 
to sign up for a free subscription to Offshore Wire Magazine which 
regularly reviews different providers, or simply email the staff directly for 
more information. Please note: we are not in anyway affiliated with this 
magazine  but the quality of information provided by it is excellent. 
 
For the more adventurous, you would travel to a third world country 
yourself, get acquainted with a few high level bureaucrats, and you'll find 
out that they'll be more than happy to assist you!

the 
crème 
de 
la 
crème 
of

5. International Drivers License 
 
The United Nations, in the Convention on International Road Traffic on 
September 19, 1949, established the International Driving Permit to 
facilitate the worldwide travel of motorists in foreign countries where 
language barriers create difficulties for both motorists and police. It has 
been ratified by more than 160 nations.  
 
The Permit is a 17-page booklet about the size of a passport (4.25 x 6 
inches; 10.8 x 15.25 cm). It is printed in eleven (11) languages: English, 
French, German, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Italian, Chinese, Swedish, 
Japanese and Portuguese. It explains that the motorist has a driving 
license from his permanent place of residence. The Permit has been so 
widely used for more than fifty years that is recognized everywhere in the 
world.  
 
The International Driving Permit cannot be assessed points, revoked or 
suspended!  
 
The United Nations itself does not issue driving permits. In order to 
implement this valuable document for the motorist, it was decided that it 
should be issued by certain authorized travel associations.  
 
This International Driving Permit meets every requirement of the 
Convention on International Road Traffic, and covers all types of vehicles 
from motorcycles to heavy trucks. Below you can specify which vehicles 
you are qualified to drive.  
 
IMPORTANT! For the International Driving Permit to be valid in your U.S. 
state or country, you cannot have a drivers license issued from your state 
or country, or a car registered in your name. State issued licenses 
supersede an international driver license in the state or country where 
they are being used. That is, if you are ever stopped, your tags and name 
are run through the DMV computers. If the name on your IDP matches 
that in DMV records, then you are a 'resident' and not a 'tourist'. IDP's are 
intended for world traveler tourists only.  
 
Having an International IDP does not authorize the Holder to break the 
law(s) or endanger public safety. The Holder of an IDP is presumed to be 
bound under the Convention of International Road Traffic of 19 
September, 1949. That is, you must be qualified, and obey all the rules of 
the road in every country or state it is used. The IDP is NOT a silver bullet 
against traffic citations. If you happen to get a traffic citation (and 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
80 
deserved it), then pay the pay and stop doing whatever it was that got 
you the citation. The Holder of an IDP is also responsible for any property 
damage he or she may cause.  
 
 
Facts:   
 
An International Driving Permit is valid in every country except the country 
of Issue (IDP's are for international travellers and tourists only.)   
 
A State issued Driver License nullifies an International Driving Permit in the 
State of residence.   
 
Automobile registration in your name nullifies an International Driving 
Permit in the State of residence.   
 
Carrying any government or private identification that shows a residence 
address in your state will nullify an International Driving Permit.   
 
 
A successful IDP holder does NOT:   
 
Carry any ID in or out of his automobile that is in conflict with his new ID.   
 
Have an automobile registered in his name. Rather, his automobile is 
registered in another name, or to a trust, and carries a 'permission to use' 
letter from the registered owner.   
 
Drive under the influence of any substance that would impair his ability 
behind the wheel.   
 
Drive cars which draw needless attention.   
 
Carry contraband within his automobile which would be in plain view of a 
police officer (probable cause.)   
 
Engage in needless conversation (designed to entrap), or answer 
questions that are not directly related to a traffic stop.   
 
Become confrontational or disrespectful with police officers.   
 
Grant permissions to search his car, unless a search warrant is issued.   
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
81 
Go to court and voluntarily grant jurisdiction to adjudicate the validity of 
International Law or the Permit. Traffic, Municipal and State courts do NOT 
have jurisdiction or venue in International Law (unless it is voluntarily 
given.)  
 
 
A successful IDP holder DOES:   
 
Obey the rules of the road, and obey posted speed limits.   
 
Conduct himself in a courteous manner at all times.   
 
Drive a clean car in good repair.   
 
Pay traffic citations which are deserved.  
 
 
A successful IDP holder's position if ever confronted is ALWAYS:   
 
I am an American (or, nationality printed on IDP.) I live and work abroad. I 
am here on vacation. I am a non-resident. I am borrowing the car. If I 
have committed a crime, then arrest me, cite me, or let me go. Then SHUT 
YOUR MOUTH, AND ADMIT NOTHING!   
 
Police officers are not trained in Law or International Law! They operate 
under police procedure and have been given the power of 'discretion.' 
Many officers have no knowledge and have never even seen an IDP. 
Some may even tell you that an IDP is not valid. Never argue the subject 
of validity, as police officers hate to appear ignorant. If anything, simply 
state that the IDP was purchased in the 'country of issue', and to the best 
of your knowledge and belief it is perfectly lawful. Tell the officer that (if 
need be), you will save your arguments for the judge (if a citation is to be 
issued.)   
 
 
Where to get an International Driving License 
 
At the end of this chapter we have listed several reliable providers of 
International Driving Licenses and have done business with all of these 
companies.

6. Fake Identity Documents 
 
The first question you have to ask yourself when looking for fake ID is why 
do you need it? If you are trying to open a bank account in another 
name or travel anonymously then fake ID will not cut it, instead you should 
be looking at a second passport / citizenship program.  
 
Alternatively if you are trying to create a new persona and want a well-
rounded set of documents then you can simply order these from a range 
of suppliers on the Internet or preferably make them yourself. 
 
 
Making Your Own ID 
 
Using an average PC and a good quality Ink Jet printer you can produce 
near perfect ID documents in under an hour, couple that with a range of 
letters to yourself from big companies, a few bills, and a bank statement 
and your new alias is starting to look like a believable character. If 
someone were to go through your briefcase and found these things then 
they would be pretty convinced that you are who you say you are. 
 
Included with this eBook is a selection of ID documents that have been 
scanned in for you to take a look at, these include drivers licenses, ID 
cards, 
college 
and 
university 
diplomas, 
and 
other 
professional 
accreditations.  
 
Using a photo manipulation program such as Adobe Photoshop or Photo 
Paint, you can edit the details on these images and change them to 
whatever you want. This process does take practice and you expect to 
spend a few days learning the editing program and practicing on the 
sample images before you start making your own documents. 
 
For utility bills, bank statements, and other corporate letters, simple take 
an existing document and scan this into your computer. Most modern 
scanners in the sub $100 range provide adequate resolution to reproduce 
the original. Once this has been scanned in you may need to touch it up 
slightly in your paint program and then edit the details etc. 
 
Don’t forget that you can always hold photocopies of your documents as 
these hide and slight blemishes or mistakes which are a result of the 
scanning process. 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
83 
Please Note: A lot of offshore banks only require you to send a notarized 
photocopy of a document. Now come on, how easy is that to fake. Once 
you have an offshore account and credit card in a different name, think 
how easy it would be to get an account or other services in your own 
country. 
 
 
Sources of ID 
 
Although we personally recommend creating your own documents, we 
have supplied a list of on-line suppliers at the end of this chapter. We have 
never used any of these ourselves and cannot give any guarantee about 
their service.

7. Prestigious Titles 
 
Acquiring a prestigious title can and does change the way organisations, 
businesses, restaurants and clients deal with you. You are instantly given 
respect due to your status. Surprisingly, obtaining such a title is as simple as 
filling in a form and paying a few hundred dollars. 
 
A Title By Deed Poll 
 
Under International and English Law: "You have the right to call yourself, 
and be known as anything you like" provided there is no fraudulent          
intention in the process of any such change. 
 
What this effectively means is that you can legally change your name to 
Lord Harry Davenport or Earl Davenport and use this on your passport or 
driving license.  
 
You must first check that here is not an existing person with a similar Title 
granted by Royalty, Government, or Inherited by birthright, as it could be 
perceived as trying to cause upset or distress to that person.  
 
The next step in this process is applying to your local court to change you 
name by deed poll. All in all this is a very simple process and can be done 
by yourself with minimal cost. If you require professional assistance in this 
matter then we have included a list of contact in the references section 
at the end of this document. 
 
Names to consider for this are: 
 
Lord / Lady 
Baron / Baroness 
Earl / Count / Countess 
Viscount / Viscountess 
Marquis / Marchioness 
Duke / Duchess 
Sir 
 
 
Seated Titles 
 
A seated title is quite different than a simple name change. A seated title 
is acquired by purchasing a parcel of land from an existing Lord or Lady of 
the British Empire. The parcel of land can be legally named, for example 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
85 
‘Westminster’. Once you have purchased such land you will be legally 
entitled to call your self for instance Lord Davenport of Westminster. 
What’s more, seated titles can be inherited by your children. 
 
The legal process for such a purchase is quite complicated and requires 
Land Registration, Title Registration, and the preparation of all legal 
documents; In the References and Contact section of this manual we 
have included a list of companies that can provide a full service solution 
for around $1500

8. Becoming an Ordained Minister 
 
As with becoming a Lord, becoming a minister can add a certain air of 
respect to your new persona. Surprisingly becoming a minister does not 
require years of theological study and a life of chastity, just a church that 
will take you on, and there are plenty of those. 
 
Becoming a minister will allow you to perform marriage ceremonies, 
baptisms, and other religious ceremonies as well as forming your very own 
church, which will be tax-exempt and can own property, securities and 
other financial instruments. 
 
As I said, there are plenty of churches that will ordain you, some charge a 
nominal fee so as to support the church, others offer this completely free. 
So lets take a look at one of these. 
 
Universal Ministries 
 
The Universal Ministries is a nondenominational Ministry founded in the 
truth of accepting the rights of all to follow their own personal beliefs 
without their intervention. They uphold the First Amendment of the 
Constitution of the United States of America, and the right of the individual 
to legally worship as they please.  
 
The Universal Ministries will ordain anyone that requests ordination for free, 
online or through postal mail.  
 
Since being originally ordained in the Universal Life Church, and as 
Ministers in good standing with them, they have founded the Universal 
Ministries as a truly independent nondenominational order. With members 
belonging to several denominations, The Universal Ministries was created 
to encompass all beliefs, and invite all members to contribute to the 
weekly sermons. 
 
Here are a few questions and answers taken from their web site. 
 
Q: How old does one have to be to be an ordained minister?  
 
A: Ministers are of all ages, however, in some states you cannot officiate 
at a wedding unless you are at least 18 years old. The legal may vary in 
different states, so check with your local Marriage Bureau for your state's 
requirements.    
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
87 
Q: What services do I have to perform as an ordained minister?  
 
A: There are no specific duties required, other than those needed by the 
congregation. You are authorized to perform all ministerial duties such as: 
baptisms, marriages, funerals, and to conduct church worship and 
meetings.     
 
Q: May a minister be compelled to reveal any communications with 
members of the congregation?  
 
A: Yes, you may called upon if such communication involves confession of 
a crime, or the intent to commit a crime.  
 
Q: Is the Universal Ministries legal in all 50 states?  
 
A: Yes it is, and in most other locations too. 
 
Q: Does a church have to reveal the sum and substance of its religious 
basis?  
 
A: No. A church may be established on the basis of Liberty of Religion and 
permit to each of its ministers the Liberty of Conscience to which they are 
naturally entitled. In Everson v. Board of Education, 330 US 203, 91 L. Ed. 
711, it was held that: "The establishment of religion, of the First Amendment 
means at least this: Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all 
religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force or 
influence a person to go to or remain away from a church against his will 
or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can 
be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for 
church attendance or nonattendance."  
 
Q: What sections of U.S. Title 26, the Internal Revenue Code, apply to 
churches?  
 
A: Of particular importance are sections 107, 170, 501, 511, 513, 1402, 
2055, 2106, 2522, 3121, 3401, 6033, 7605, and 7214. However, it is up to 
each minister and each congregation to be acquainted with the 
provisions of the Internal Revenue codes of the federal government and 
the Revenue and Taxation codes of their own state.  
 
Q: Is the Universal Ministries liable for excise taxes?  
 
A: No, as a public foundation (churches are not private foundations), the 
Universal Ministries is not subject to the excise taxes required by Chapter 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
88 
42 of the Internal Revenue Code, U.S. Title 26, and most states follow the 
same policy.  
 
Q: Should the Universal Ministries file a Form 990T to report unrelated 
business income?  
 
A: Perhaps, depending upon whether a particular congregation had 
unrelated income, as defined in sections 511 and 513 of the Internal 
Revenue Code, a congregation may wish to file a report of unrelated 
business income on Form 990T.  
 
Q: May the Internal Revenue Service, or any sate agency order my 
congregation to furnish its books and records for inspection?  
 
A: Yes, with the proper court order or warrant.  
 
Q: What prohibits the IRS from examining our congregration's records?  
 
A: Section 7605(c) of the IRS Code prohibits the IRS from examining the 
books and records of any church.  
 
Q: Can the IRS see our congregation's bank records?  
 
A: Yes, but only if the first get a court order (Section 7609(c) of the IRS 
Code), check with an attorney.  
 
Q: The IRS has asked me a list of questions about the congregation and it's 
internal operations. Do I have to answer them?  
 
A: No. Section 7605(c) of the IRS Code strictly forbids this type of questing, 
as it reveals a more complete disclosure than any audit could.  
 
Q: May a congregation have a postal Bulk Rate mailing permit?  
 
A: Yes, a congregation as a nonprofit organization is entitled to mail at a 
bulk rate. This is a bulk rate that is available to all nonprofit organizations. 
Ask your local postmaster about these rates and the permit required.  
 
Q: Can I use my apartment as my church?  
 
A: Most states allow you to use just about anything as a meeting place. 
However, there are a few exceptions. so we suggest you contact the 
appropriate authority in your state.  
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
89 
Q: What is the minimum number of people required to organize a 
congregation?  
 
A: A minimum of three people, a Minister (or Pastor), Secretary and 
Treasure (who must all be of legal age).  
 
Q: Is it necessary to keep minutes of Board Meetings?  
 
A: Yes. Everything done by a church must be done by resolution voted on 
and passed by the Board of Directors. You need only those things which 
passed.   
 
Q: Does the Universal Ministries control the money and property I donate 
to my congregation?  
 
A: All money and property will be in your congregation's name. Your 
congregation has no financial obligations to the Universal Ministries.  
  
Q: Can the real property be declared a church where there is no building, 
and be exempt from tax as such?  
 
A: Your congregation can hold meetings wherever the Board of Directors 
may decide. However, any property used exclusively for church services, 
and only that part, may be eligible for tax exemption. Check with your 
local tax authority.   
 
Q: Can I borrow money from my congregation?  
 
A: Yes, provided that you repay the loan with a reasonable interest. But 
you should check the IRS code.   
 
Q: Are churches exempt from the payment of sales taxes on items used 
for religious services?  
 
A: Yes. Check with the state for all exemption requirements.  
 
Q: How could I find out about property tax exemption for my 
congregation?  
 
A: Contact the local county tax assessor for all such information. It varies 
from county to county because it is local government function, as it 
should be.        
 
Q: If we need copies of the Certificate of Authority for the church to 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
90 
operate in our state, who do we contact?  
 
A: Write to the Secretary of State's office and request specific information. 
There is a basic fee charged for duplication.           
 
Q: What types of investments and incomes may churches have?  
 
A: It has been the policy of the Federal Government to actually promote 
organized religion by granting it almost total tax immunity. All income that 
accrues to a non-profit church is tax exempt (with the exception of 
unrelated business income). There are about six different kinds of church 
income, five of which are totally tax exempt.  
 
1. Donation Income - All money and property donated or willed to a 
church or otherwise received from it's church members is tax exempt. A 
church may perform any type of service or engage in any business 
activity for the benefit of its members without paying taxes on the income.  
 
2. Fund Raising Activity Income - Whenever a church sponsors a fund 
raising activity and charges admission, the income is tax exempt. All 
income that is generated by various church members by donating their 
services in return for contributions to their church is tax exempt.  
 
3. Passive Church Investment Income - All income earned by a church via 
its own investments in stock, bonds, rental properties, bank accounts, etc. 
is tax exempt. A passive investment is any investment that does not 
require day-to-day management and supervision by the directors of the 
church.  
 
4. Capital Gains Income - Any income or profit realized by a church from 
the sale of church owned assets is tax exempt.  
 
5. Related Business Income - any income that accrues to a church from a 
business venture that can be justified one the basis that the business is 
related to the mission of the church is tax exempt. Several examples of 
related business income can be found throughout the Catholic Church 
with regard to the radio and television stations that the church owns and 
operates. Churches are also engaged in publishing as well as the life 
insurance business. The Lutheran Church maintains a $3 billion insurance 
fund exclusively for church members.  
 
6. Unrelated Business Income - Church can own and operate any kind of 
business. If the IRS can prove in court that the income from a particular 
business venture is not related to the overall mission of the church, then it 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
91 
can force the church to pay taxes on the income. The most famous and 
recent example of this is when the IRS finally forced the Christian Brothers 
Winery to pay income taxes on the revenue they received from the 
production and sale of liquor related products.  
 
Q: What is "self dealing"?  
 
A: "Self dealing" includes borrowing or loaning money, buying or selling 
property, and any other activity in which a profit may be made for the 
Trustees or members of the Board of Directors - except that anyone may 
receive compensation reasonably related to services actually performed.     
 
Q: Can the congregation buy real estate and other items in it's own 
name?  
 
A: Yes, any person, natural or artificial, may own real estate. An individual 
is a natural person, as opposed to an organization that conducts business, 
such as a church. A church, a Common Law organization, or a 
corporation, are examples of artificial, or juristic, persons.   
 
Q: Can the congregation own stocks and bonds?  
 
A: Yes, the congregation may own stocks, bonds, and securities as passive 
investments.

9. Escaping the USA 
 
The United States of America was founded on the principles of liberty, 
limited government, and the pursuit of happiness. However, the practical 
application of these ideals leaves quite a lot to be desired these days.  
 
In fact, the US Government is undoubtedly the biggest Big Brother of them 
all when it comes to poking its nose into its citizen's financial affairs and 
attempting to regulate personal behavior. Consequently, being a forced 
contributor to the world's number one economic and military superpower 
may not seem quite as exciting to you as it once was.   
 
Furthermore, you may have decided that your personal freedom and 
happiness in the "Land of the Free" is not quite up to your enlightened 
personal standards. 
 
Let's say you've visited one or more countries elsewhere on this globe, and 
now find yourself considering a full-time move from US shores to live the 
good life in your newfound expatriate paradise. If you're a US citizen or 
resident alien, leaving your US taxes behind is not quite as simple as 
leaving your US home behind.   
 
The US is almost unique in the world in that it taxes on the basis of 
citizenship, not residency. This means that you can leave the US, abandon 
your US residency (thereby negating any need for costly US government 
support services), and take up legal, permanent residence in a foreign 
land... and still be liable for US taxes!   
 
Regardless of where you're actually living, the IRS still considers you a 
bona fide, full-liability taxpayer entitled to the fullest possible privileges(?) 
of supporting your country's legislation-happy bureaucracy in all its glory. 
Not only that, but also you're subject to the same income tax filing 
requirements as onshore taxpaying residents.   
 
However, you can be granted exemptions under US tax law if you follow 
the rules. These exemptions can render you tax-free if you're in the right 
income bracket!   
 
But if you don't qualify, then there's another approach you could use. 
Renouncing your US citizenship could be the ultimate answer for you. We'll 
cover both approaches in this article.  
 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
93 
Sneak Under the $74,000 Wire   
 
If you're not presently a large earner - and if you're not employed by the 
US government or any of its agencies including the Armed Forces - the 
foreign-earned income exemption could be an excellent opportunity for 
you to avoid paying any US income tax once you're no longer living in 
your home and native land.   
 
You could qualify for a complete exclusion from income tax if your 
foreign-earned income is presently less than $74,000 USD. This means you 
wouldn't owe the IRS a penny! Even if you earn more, your first $74,000 of 
earnings would be tax-free and only the remainder of your income will be 
subject to tax. This could still result in tremendous savings to you.   
 
As far as the IRS is concerned, "foreign-earned income" is generally 
defined as money earned for services performed outside of the US. 
"Outside of the US" includes not only the 50 states, but also Puerto Rico, 
the Northern Marina Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the 
Federated 
States 
of 
Micronesia, 
Guam, 
and 
American 
Samoa. 
Additionally, you may not claim the income exclusion for Cuba, Libya, or 
Iraq, as government restrictions prohibit US citizens and residents from 
engaging in transactions relating to travel to, from, or within those 
countries.   
 
An important point to note: once you've excluded your income, you may 
not claim any credits or deductions related to that excluded income. This 
would include IRA contributions or any other normal deductions you might 
make in a normal, onshore tax return. Your money is effectively off the IRS 
radar screens once it's excluded.   
 
 
You Could Also Benefit From Housing Costs   
 
Another benefit you could be eligible for is tax exclusion of allowable 
housing costs in excess of the specified base amount, which is presently 
$9,865 USD annually or $27.03 USD per day on a pro rata basis (if you lived 
less than the full year outside the US in the previous tax year). So if your 
allowable costs are $50 USD per day, for example, you could deduct 
$22.97 USD for each day you qualify as having a foreign tax home (more 
on this in a moment).   
 
Allowable housing expenses include rent, utilities other than telephone 
charges, and real and personal property insurance. These items could 
have been paid or incurred during the tax year by you or another entity 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
94 
on your behalf; for example, you can include the rental value of housing 
provided by your employer in return for your services.   
 
Additionally, you can also include the allowable housing expenses of a 
second foreign household for your spouse and dependents if they 
couldn't live with you because of dangerous, unhealthy, or otherwise 
adverse living conditions at your tax home.   
 
Items that don't qualify under the housing exclusion include the cost of 
home purchase or other capital items, the wages of domestic servants, or 
deductible interest and taxes.   
 
 
But Do I Qualify?   
 
Now that you can see the possibilities, you must pass a simple test 
imposed by the IRS. You must fall under one of the following three 
categories to take advantage of the $74,000 exclusion as well as the 
excess housing allowance:   
 
If a US citizen, you must be a legal (bona-fide) resident of a foreign 
country (or countries) for an uninterrupted period that includes a 
complete tax year; or   
 
A US resident alien who is a citizen or national of a country with which 
the United States has an income tax treaty in effect, and who is also 
a legal resident of a foreign country (or countries) for an 
uninterrupted period that includes a complete tax year; or   
 
A US citizen or a US resident alien who is physically present in a 
foreign country or countries for at least 330 full days during any 
period of 12 consecutive months.   
 
Examined closely, you are trying to pass one of two tests: either you're a 
bona-fide resident of one or more foreign countries for an entire year, or 
you're just physically present in one or more foreign countries for nearly the 
same length of time.   
 
What either of the above categories do is establish a new "tax home" for 
you that's outside the US. Generally, your tax home is your main place of 
business, employment, or post of duty where you are permanently or 
indefinitely engaged to work. You should not expect to spend a great 
deal of time in the US if you wish to qualify for a new foreign tax home. If 
you spend too much time stateside, the IRS will still consider you to have 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
95 
your abode in the US and refuse you the exemption. However, being 
temporarily present in the US (or even maintaining a dwelling there) does 
not necessarily mean that your tax home remains in the United States.  
 
An additional point to consider is that even if you don't fully qualify under 
time requirements in any of the three categories (due to a major crisis 
such as war, civil unrest, or similar adverse conditions in your foreign 
country), you could still be eligible for the exclusion. However, you must be 
able to show that you could have met the minimum time requirements if 
the crisis had not prevented you from conducting normal business in your 
new jurisdiction.   
 
 
Paying Foreign Income Tax   
 
Should you be residing in a country where you must pay income taxes, a 
limited amount of the foreign income tax you pay can either be:  
 
Credited against your remaining US tax liability (usually to your 
advantage, as it reduces your US tax liability and may be carried back 
or forward to other years);   
 
Or deducted in figuring taxable income on your US income tax return 
(this only reduces your taxable income and may be taken only in the 
current year);   
 
You must treat all foreign income taxes in the same way, therefore you 
can't deduct some foreign income taxes and take credits for others.   
 
 
Don't Forget to File   
 
You must always file a tax return for each year that you remain a US 
citizen. You could find yourself in hot water with the IRS if you fail to do so, 
even if the net result (had you filed) would have resulted in no tax 
payable.   
 
However, if your tax home is outside the US or Puerto Rico, you're 
automatically granted an extension (usually to June 15) to file your return 
and pay any tax due. You don't have to file a special form to receive the 
extension but must attach a statement to your tax return showing that you 
are eligible for it.   
 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
96 
Some useful forms to be aware of, and which should be filed with your tax 
return:   
 
Form 2555-EZ (Foreign Earned Income - Easy) if you were not self-
employed, if your income was less than the exclusion amount, and if 
you're not claiming business and moving expenses (or the housing 
exclusion) then this is the paper you need for your $74,000 exclusion   
 
Form 2555 (Foreign Earned Income) use this one if one or more of the 
restrictions for 2555-EZ are not fulfilled. For example, you could be self-
employed, earning more than $74,000, or claiming various expenses 
including the housing exclusion   
 
Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit) if you wish to take advantage of the tax 
credit and deduction privileges available if you are already paying 
income tax in your new tax home   
 
 
Getting Extreme With US Citizenship   
 
Maybe the $74,000 exemption isn't enough for you. Or maybe just the 
idea of filing a bunch of forms every year for Big Brother isn't something 
you want to do. Maybe you want to be permanently tax free in the 
paradise of your choice. And maybe you already have an alternate 
citizenship 
and accompanying passport, courtesy 
of your birth, 
parentage, religion, or other means. For whatever reason, US citizenship 
isn't vital to you any more.   
 
Then you might want to consider going all the way and renouncing that 
US citizenship. This isn't for everyone, and you should think very carefully 
about this. Aside from the emotional and psychological consequences of 
renouncing something you may hold dear, there could be negative 
financial repercussions and travel restrictions for you to worry about.   
 
The key issue of concern with renouncing US citizenship is that the IRS may 
deem you're doing so primarily for tax avoidance reasons. How do they 
decide? In typical paranoid bureaucrat fashion, you are automatically 
presumed to be a tax avoider if your average annual US income tax 
liability for the previous five tax years is greater than $100,000 USD; or, your 
net worth is greater than $500,000 USD  
 
Nobody said the rules were fair. However, you may be able to exonerate 
yourself if you can obtain (within one year of renouncing your US 
citizenship) an IRS ruling certifying that tax avoidance was not one of the 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
97 
principal reasons you relinquished your citizenship status. You might even 
be able to obtain an IRS ruling in advance (before you leave), although it 
remains to be seen how much documented proof the tax bureaucrats 
would require for this.   
 
 
Why is the determination of tax avoidance so important? If the 
government decides you're a tax avoider, here's what they do:   
 
You’re still liable for income tax on all US-source income for 10 years after 
shedding your US citizenship; and, during that 10-year period, you'll also 
be subject to US estate and gift taxes that expose you to tax liabilities 
those "normal" non US-citizens wouldn't pay in similar situations. In other 
words, you're subject to a pure "expatriate tax" designed to punish you for 
daring to leave the mighty US of A   
 
Unless you are prepared to wait 10 years to unwind certain estates and 
properties you may hold, this could be a serious problem.   
 
And as if that isn't bad enough, former US citizens who are deemed to 
have renounced their citizenship in order to avoid paying taxes can be 
barred from entering the US. However, the language of the statute is very 
broad and therefore the extent of its application remains unknown.   
 
 
It Isn't Getting Better   
 
There is new legislation on the way, which promises to make everything 
even worse. The Rangel-Matsui bill (HR 3099) toughens the rules on tax-
motivated expatriation and takes aim at gift and estate tax avoidance. 
The legislation imposes an exit tax on the unrealized appreciation of an 
expatriate’s assets - with an exemption on the first $600,000 USD ($1.2 
million USD for a married couple) - just as if the expatriate had sold his or 
her assets for their fair market value on the date of expatriation. An 
expatriate would be defined as:   
  
Any  individual who renounces or relinquishes US citizenship;   
 
Any 'long-term resident' of the United States who relinquishes his or 
her Certificate of Lawful Permanent Residence (known as a 'green 
card'); or   
 
Any 'long-term resident' of the United States who commences to be 
treated as a resident of a foreign country under the provisions of a 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
98 
double tax treaty without waiving the benefits of that treaty.   
 
Additionally, the bill would impose a tax on the receipt (by US citizens) of 
gifts or bequests from expatriates in any case where US gift or estate taxes 
would normally not apply. (The tax would be reduced by the amount of 
any foreign gift and estate taxes paid.) This provision is directed at 
wealthy individuals who might expatriate while their families continue to 
maintain US citizenship.   
 
Other countries including Canada have departure tax laws, but it is only in 
the US that renunciation of citizenship is necessary to avoid global 
taxation.   
 
 
In Conclusion   
 
Given the severity of existing and proposed laws, you will need expert 
legal and tax advice before considering expatriating from the US. 
However, it can be done if you're willing to pay the price, and once free, 
you should be free forever.   
 
If you are serious about leaving, start with the $74,000 exclusion while 
exploring and living in foreign countries, and continue monitoring 
expatriation legislation for pending changes. HR 3099 isn't law yet, so it's 
still possible to find freedom even in an un-free world.

10. Escaping Canada 
 
How to Become a Non-Resident of Canada And Escape The Income Tax 
Burden   
 
So you're thinking about leaving Canada behind for the exciting world 
waiting just offshore. Perhaps you plan to travel or sail around the world, 
retire to an exotic locale, or just work overseas in a country with a lower 
cost of living and a warmer climate.   
 
It may come as a surprise that you (and your spouse) could still be liable 
for oppressively high Canadian taxes - even if you don't plan to spend a 
single day inside Canada during the next year… or more.   
 
In this report, you'll learn how the tax department tries to keep the 
taxation ball-and-chain attached to your leg, even if you're no longer 
living in Canada. And you'll discover how to use the government's tax 
laws against itself, allowing you to escape the Canadian tax burden if 
you're out of the country.   
 
 
The Government is Not Here to Help You   
 
Never expect the CCRA (the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency, 
successor to Revenue Canada) to be particularly helpful in assisting you 
to become a tax-escapee. They're not on your side and they never will 
be. They want you paying taxes as early as  they can get you onto the tax 
rolls, and they want you to keep paying for as long as legally possible.  
 
They are, however, obligated to provide correct information in response 
to your specific questions about reducing tax. Just don't count on them to 
volunteer anything you don't already know. It's up to you to know the 
questions to ask.  
 
And when you do ask, be sure to get it in writing, as you'll have little 
recourse if you base your plans on telephone answers that are later found 
to be incorrect. Besides having a hard copy in your possession in case of a 
dispute, there's the added advantage that the CCRA's written responses 
are generally quite accurate. They are well aware that a documented 
mistake on their part could be quite damaging not only financially but 
also reputation-wise.  
 
If you decide to handle your non-residency planning on your own, without 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
100 
the assistance of a qualified expatriate tax advisor - this is not 
recommended - be sure to avoid the following pitfalls when contacting 
the CCRA:  
 
Don't call your local CCRA office to discuss your plans and look for hints 
and tips. A phone call can and will create a permanent trail straight back 
to your most personal financial affairs. You don't want them to know any 
more about you and your plans than they absolutely must. Needless to 
say, appearing on a list as a potential tax escapee is not in your best 
interests.   
 
Don't take any information from the CCRA at face value. Always attempt 
to verify its accuracy.   
 
Don't provide your SIN if you should call. Your SIN is the magic number 
they need to access anything and everything about you on every 
government database in existence. Handing your personal blueprints to 
an adversary is not the way to win the game!   
 
 
Canadian Citizenship and Residency Are Not One And the Same  
 
The basis on which you are taxed by the CCRA is your deemed residency 
- not your citizenship. This is a much different situation than the one the 
American taxpayer faces, where American citizens are taxed by the US 
government regardless of their country of residence.   
 
For clarification, let's make the distinction between citizenship and 
residency right now.   
 
Citizenship is an asset to you and potentially a liability to the government 
that issues it, as the government is morally obligated to protect its citizens 
should they find themselves in a difficult situation outside the country. 
Citizenship also gives you the right to vote for the pork-barreling, lowlife 
politician you dislike the least and (most importantly!) gifts you with a 
passport to the world. Therefore a citizenship can be quite difficult to 
obtain without spending significant amounts of time and/or money to 
acquire one.   
 
On the other hand, a residency works the opposite way and is an asset to 
the government that decrees it. A residency is usually an albatross around 
your neck thanks to its financial liabilities. As a resident, you are 
considered to be a consumer of government services, regardless of how 
much or how little of those services you actually consume. This gives the 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
101 
government its self-mandated authority to tax you based on your income 
(unless, of course, the residency is in a tax haven). As you might expect, 
non-tax haven governments love to make you a resident as quickly as 
possible. Furthermore, they erect numerous barriers to prevent an easy 
escape from residential obligations once they are acquired.   
 
 
A Four Point Escape Route  
 
A solid Canadian non-residency plan has four legs, making a solid 
platform from which leap from the CCRA's grasping clutches and allowing 
you to escape Canada as a non-resident. All the legs are equally 
important. In summary, you must do the following:  
 
Properly cut your residency ties to Canada.   
 
Establish similar residency ties in another tax jurisdiction (ideally in a 
low-tax or no-tax haven, but there are other considerations as well).   
 
File an accurate and complete income tax return for your year of 
departure from Canada.   
 
Ensure that any Canadian-source income you will still receive after 
leaving is properly taxed.   
 
By executing these four steps correctly, you should be confident that 
Canada and its confiscatory tax laws will not come back to haunt you at 
a later date.  
 
 
Cutting the Residency Ties That Bind  
 
The CCRA uses four primary walls (and an assortment of speed bumps) to 
box you into being a resident of Canada. In no particular order of 
importance, the four walls are:   
 
The physical location of your common-law or legally married spouse.   
 
The physical location of any dependents you might be supporting.   
 
Your own physical presence within the country.   
 
Whether or not you maintain a habitable dwelling or apartment for 
your future use within Canada.   

The Essential Underground Handbook 
102 
 
Naturally, should you wish to cease being a Canadian resident, you must 
be prepared to batter down each of these four walls, and then further 
navigate the speed bumps waiting just outside them.  
 
While they're of secondary importance to the principal residency ties, you 
could have difficulty declaring yourself a non-resident - even after 
satisfying the primary obligations - if the CCRA deems you to have too 
many of the following:  
 
A relative or family friend is living in your former home under a rental 
agreement (in other words, under a non-arm's length arrangement)   
 
You are maintaining your former home in a vacant state, or otherwise 
leaving yourself the option of easily re-using it as a dwelling   
 
You keep furniture, furnishings, clothing, personal items, or pets within 
Canada   
 
Whether or not you maintain a habitable dwelling or apartment for 
your future use within Canada.   
 
You are storing or driving one or more Canadian-registered vehicles 
inside the country   
 
You decide to keep or renew your Canadian drivers license   
 
You take steps to maintain your eligibility for government subsidized 
health coverage even after three months outside the country 
(normally your MSP coverage will expire by default if you depart for 
longer than 90 days)   
 
You maintain your social, recreational, religious, or professional 
club/association memberships   
 
You keep one or more bank accounts with Canadian financial 
institutions   
 
You continue to use Canadian-issued credit cards   
 
You maintain investments in Canada including securities accounts, 
RRSP's, or other financial investments   
 
You own a seasonal residence such as a summer cottage or a time-

The Essential Underground Handbook 
103 
share condominium   
 
You maintain a Canadian based telephone service   
 
You continue to use stationary or business cards with a Canadian 
address, and/or use a P.O. box or safety deposit box in Canada   
 
You fail to terminate any partnerships, endorsements, or other 
business relationships within the country   
 
You could have as many as five or six items the above list and still be a 
non-resident, but it's best to have as few marks as possible against you in 
determining your non-residency in Canada.   
 
Non-residency is resolved by a very subjective evaluation process defined 
by CCRA computer logic. The computer will flag various bits of info and 
prompt further inquiry by a CCRA agent if it thinks you may have too 
many remaining ties to Canada. Ideally, you want to arrange your affairs 
so that you will successfully bypass the computer's algorithms, thus 
avoiding any further inquiries.   
  
 
Building A Bridge To Freedom  
 
However clever and diligent you are at removing your Canadian 
residency ties, you must also prove to the CCRA and its computer system 
that you are in fact a legal resident of another jurisdiction. Just checking 
off the two lists in the above section is not enough. If you can't establish 
foreign ties you'll still be considered a de facto tax resident of Canada. 
You'll be liable for Canadian income taxes just as if you still lived at home.  
 
If you plan to never, ever return to Canada, you just might get away with 
simply cutting all your ties and conveniently forgetting about a foreign 
residency. But doing this will make you a potential tax evader and you'll 
be punished accordingly if you're ever apprehended by the authorities. A 
visit to your relatives in Canada at Christmas could be considerably less 
festive than you planned if you spend the holiday season in prison due to 
tax evasion charges.  
 
The CCRA will want to see some proof that you're serious about living in 
another country. And unfortunately, they're just as nosy about the 
personal details of your life as when you were still a captive tax serf. In 
fact, they'd like to know:  
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
104 
Where your spouse or common law spouse will reside outside of 
Canada   
 
Detailed information on your dependent children, including their 
ages, schools, and present educational levels   
 
Information about any other individuals who are your dependents 
outside of Canada 
 
Description, details, and address of your new dwelling   
 
Any possessions you have in your new country   
 
Whether or not you have a new drivers license in the new country   
 
Whether or not you have medical insurance and the length of 
coverage   
 
Details of social, recreational, or religious clubs in which you're now a 
member   
 
Details of foreign investments such as bank accounts and property 
outside of Canada and why you keep them outside of Canada   
 
Lines of credit and credit cards outside of Canada   
 
Your new telephone number, even if it is not listed   
 
Addresses of any foreign P.O. boxes or safety deposit boxes   
 
Details of business partnerships or endorsements in other countries   
 
Details regarding which countries, other than Canada, you have 
visited in the past year   
 
Whether or not you're considered a legal resident of another country, 
with documented proof from that country's government   
 
By the time you've read to the end of this list, you're probably ready to 
explode with indignation at such a blatant fishing expedition into your 
financial and personal privacy. However, the good news is that only 
general answers are required to virtually all of these questions. As 
determined by the CCRA computer logic, highly specific information does 
not appear to be necessary.  

The Essential Underground Handbook 
105 
 
But by far the most critical of the above items is the last one on the list: do 
you really have a legal residency in a foreign jurisdiction? To establish such 
status, you will need a residency visa, a work permit, or similar 
documentation issued by the government in question. A tourist visa is not 
acceptable. You must be a legal resident.   
 
Although most people treat it as an afterthought, a proper visa should be 
a primary consideration for anyone wishing to gain non-residency status 
outside of Canada.   
 
Ideally, you will have acquired this new residency in a country where 
there is no taxation on worldwide income, only on income earned within 
that particular country. This has privacy as well as financial benefits.   
 
However, taxes should not be your over-riding concern in picking a new 
country in which to reside. There are many other factors such as climate, 
the cost of living, the pace of life, whether or not there are lots of fellow 
expatriates in the area, and the healthcare situation too.  
 
Certain individuals, sometimes referred to as "tax junkies", will do anything 
to save a tax dollar and keep it out of the authorities' hands. This isn't 
always the best policy. Is saving a few hundred dollars in taxes really worth 
it if you end up in a country you hate and just can't wait to leave? Your 
safety and happiness should be your primary consideration, because 
without it, you just won't enjoy life.  
 
And if you're not happy, why go to all the trouble?   
 
 
Picking A Departure Date  
 
You must file a tax return for your year of departure that explicitly states 
your day of departure from Canada. The actual date is important as it will 
have a direct affect on the tax calculations the CCRA will make to 
determine what amounts you owe them in departure taxes.   
 
Also, your day of departure is not necessarily the day you step onto the 
plane to leave the country. Factors affecting your exact date of 
departure include:   
 
The departure date of your spouse   
 
The departure date of your children or other dependents   

The Essential Underground Handbook 
106 
 
The date of the sale or arm's-length rental of your dwelling, and other 
asset ownership complications that could result in it being very 
difficult or very expensive for you to achieve non-residency status   
 
The date you acquire legal residency in another jurisdiction   
 
Due to the rather personalized and complex nature of departure tax - 
especially if you control substantial assets - you will probably need the 
advice of an experienced expatriate tax advisor to deal authoritatively 
with this step of the non-resident escape plan.  
 
 
Handling Post-Departure Taxes On Canadian Source Income  
 
If you won't have any financial ties whatsoever to Canada after leaving, 
then you'll have little to worry about once you're successfully declared a 
non-resident. However, most people will, and if you retain ownership or 
possession of substantial Canadian-based assets, you'll probably be 
paying some amount of withholding tax on your investments.  
 
Canada imposes a withholding tax rate of 25% on most investment-
derived income you might receive - even after affirming your non-
residency status.  
 
This includes rental income on your dwelling, should you choose to rent it 
at arm's length rather than sell it. It also includes a myriad of minor 
financial details that may not be apparent while you are in the process of 
leaving the country. The tax implications of asset ownership should never 
be taken lightly, even when you are a non-resident. It's these details which 
trip up many would-be expatriates.  
 
However, here are a few extra issues you should be aware of to assist your 
planning efforts.  
 
  
When Goodbye is Not Forever  
 
After being declared a non-resident, you should not physically reside 
within Canada for more than 183 days per year, or you will automatically 
be deemed a resident once more - even if you have maintained a legal 
residency in a foreign jurisdiction.   
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
107 
If you repatriate to Canada within two years of shedding your previous 
Canadian residency, you stand a real risk of having been declared a 
resident for the entire intervening time period. This could result in 
substantial and unexpected tax penalties to you.   
  
  
RRSP's: Should You or Shouldn't You?  
 
In general, if your RRSP's dollar value is less than $500,000 it's not worthwhile 
to cash out and take the money offshore. There are some very 
incompetent and even criminal investment advisors in the world, and 
offshore there is no regulation or transparency available to assist you. In 
Canada, the provincial securities commissions (OSC, BCSC, etc.) and the 
Investment Dealers Association (IDA) are available to help you if you feel 
you have been financially wronged. Offshore you have no legal recourse 
if your money is being wasted away or stolen.   
 
The question you should always ask yourself is: who's going to be looking 
after your money? If you have a Canadian advisor whom you trust and 
respect, the peace of mind from this relationship will outweigh any 
potential tax savings with an unknown advisor.   
 
There is also the matter of convenience. It may be more difficult to 
contact your new advisor when he or she is located in an exotic (and 
inconvenient) time zone or in a hard-to-visit country where it's difficult to 
maintain top-notch communications. Canada, for all its high-tax 
aggravations, does maintain a very high-quality communications network 
and is relatively accessible from most areas of the world.   
 
You should seriously consider expatriating your RRSP only if it is in excess of 
$500,000. In this case, the tax savings available with such offshore 
structures as IBC's and trusts can be of invaluable assistance in estate 
planning.   
 
  
Two Choices: Sell It or Rent It  
 
The mistake most Canadians make while attempting to leave the CCRA's 
clutches is with their dwelling. To be certain that you won't be disqualified 
as a non-resident, you must either sell your dwelling or rent it in such a way 
that it is considered merely a real estate asset held for investment 
purposes.   
 
The CCRA must not be able to build a valid claim that you could return to 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
108 
live in your former dwelling at your convenience. Therefore, don't leave 
the house vacant while you're gone - this will not be good enough. And 
don't rent it to family members, business partners, or other associates who 
are somehow connected to you in any way other than as a tenant. The 
dwelling must be held at arm's length as an investment asset only.   
  
  
Helpful Links and References   
 
The CCRA's website is not tremendously useful to anyone looking to 
expatriate. After all, they don't want you to stop subsidizing the wasteful 
and inefficient government programs that are causing you to leave in the 
first place.   
 
However, the website does have some useful forms and bulletins that 
you'll need to inform yourself about becoming a non-resident of Canada.   
 
You will find links to documents and other information in the Reference 
and Contacts section at the end of this chapter.

11. Escaping The UK 
 
English culture, law, and language have been dominant forces with far-
reaching effects on modern life. However, all that tradition and history 
may seem to be expensive anachronisms on your part as a loyal taxpayer 
in England or its neighbors Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.   
 
The United Kingdom has enjoyed a long and storied tradition marked by 
numerous major events that have shaped recorded history. But you may 
be feeling that the financial price of all that tradition is not nearly so 
romantic and enjoyable as history would suggest. So now you're thinking 
about getting out, and making your own history and tradition as a tax-free 
UK expatriate.   
 
There are two key areas that will determine your status as a former tax-serf 
of Inland Revenue: the source of your income in relation to the UK, and 
also which of the five possible residency categories apply to you.   
 
We'll discuss income-source taxation further on. For now, let's give some 
definitions of the ways in which the UK taxman can choose to place you 
in the grand scheme of things.   
  
 
The Five Possibilities for UK Tax Status   
 
Your taxation status hinges upon whether or not Inland Revenue considers 
you resident, ordinarily resident, and/or domiciled in the UK.   
 
1. Resident: if you stay 183 or more days in the UK during a given tax year, 
you're automatically deemed a resident no matter what other offshore 
residency arrangements you may have made - no exceptions! Even if you 
make several short UK visits, if the total number of days hits the magic 183, 
you'll be an automatic UK resident taxpayer.   
 
2. Ordinarily Resident: This is a longer-term concept where Inland Revenue 
takes a three to four year view about where you habitually reside. What 
jurisdiction you consider your "home" is where you're considered ordinarily 
resident. The criteria: if you're customarily a UK resident year after year (or 
even if you just visit more than 91 days each year), you're generally 
declared to be an ordinary resident. This designation can haunt you for 
three (maybe even four!) years after you permanently leave the UK, 
unless you plan your affairs correctly. You're still liable for UK capital gains 
tax as an ordinary resident even if you're no longer a resident.   

The Essential Underground Handbook 
110 
 
3. Not ordinarily resident: If you work overseas, intend to continue living 
and working overseas, and won't be spending more than 91 days each 
year back in the UK, you can be declared not ordinarily resident. This is a 
good category to fall into in order to avoid many UK taxes. If you can 
prove that your intention is to remain overseas before leaving then you 
can earn this status from the day you depart the UK, not three years 
farther down the road.  
 
4. Not resident: An even more desirable status you can achieve. If you 
conform to the tax department's rules for living and working overseas and 
also not returning to the UK for any period of time which could throw 
doubt on that intention, you can be declared not resident. If you're not 
resident you're not liable to pay taxes on most UK-based income.  
 
5. Domicile: Any UK citizen - this means you! - remains UK domiciled unless 
you permanently emigrate through official channels to a foreign country. 
You must provide strong evidence that you intend to live in that new 
country permanently or indefinitely. Simply living in another country for a 
long time (without emigrating) is not sufficient to prove you have acquired 
a new domicile.   
 
Essentially, your domicile is linked to the country where your roots are and 
clings to you for life. It is where your "heart" is until proven otherwise. Usually 
you acquire your domicile or origin from your father when you're born - his 
domicile becomes yours. Unless you deliberately change your domicile, it 
can and will catch up to you on your death when your inheritance taxes 
are due.   
 
  
How to Change Your Residency Status   
 
As you might have guessed by now, Inland Revenue is none too keen 
about losing a tax-serf and thus you will have to satisfy their requirements 
to escape UK taxes. Arranging matters on your own and arbitrarily 
deciding that you're no longer a taxpayer could have some rather nasty 
repercussions should you happen to return to your homeland at a later 
date.   
 
However, leaving UK taxes (not just the UK itself) behind can be done if 
you're careful and methodical. Here's how to escape both residency and 
ordinary residency:   
 
You must leave the UK to work full-time abroad under a contract of 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
111 
employment (or in a trade, profession, or vocation), with the 
following stipulations:   
 
Your contract is for at least one full tax year (where a tax year is 
defined as 12 months starting April 6 and ending April 5 in the 
following year)   
 
You may be permitted to have several simultaneous part-time jobs 
and lump them together as one full-time commitment, but all such 
commitments should be overseas   
 
You should acquire accommodation outside the UK   
 
If you keep your UK home, it must not be maintained in such a way as 
to provide an abode for you (e.g. you should rent it at arm's length)   
 
Your return visits to the UK must total less than 183 days per tax year, 
and average less than 91 days per tax year over 4 years   
 
Exemptions to the above requirement can be granted in 
extraordinary circumstances beyond your control, such as the illness 
of a family member in the UK   
 
If the above conditions can be met, you will be both not resident and not 
ordinarily resident on the day you depart the UK for your contract. 
Furthermore, your spouse will enjoy the same benefits if he/she 
accompanies you, even if he/she is not working abroad.   
 
However, you will once more be declared a resident and ordinary 
resident when you return from the contract.   
  
  
Leaving Permanently   
 
If you declare that you are leaving the UK permanently (by Inland 
Revenue's definition, this means more than 3 years continuously), you must 
be sure not to spend more than 91 days per year (on average) in return 
visits to the region or you may find yourself declared a resident again.   
 
Evidence required by Inland Revenue to support your claim of leaving 
permanently includes:   
 
A settled purpose for leaving (e.g. a fixed object or intention in which 
you are going to be engaged for an extended period of time)   

The Essential Underground Handbook 
112 
 
Your return visits to the UK must total less than 183 days per tax year, 
and average less than 91 days per tax year - again, exemptions can 
be granted in extraordinary circumstances beyond your control, such 
as the illness of a family member in the UK   
 
Any additional evidence that shows you truly don't intend to return, 
such as a foreign residency or other documentation   
 
If you don't have a settled purpose for leaving the UK, you could still be 
considered a resident and ordinary resident for up to 3 years after your 
departure! The sooner you show evidence that you truly do not intend to 
return to the UK as a resident, the better off you'll be.   
 
  
Using Form P85   
 
Much of the relevant information regarding your planned expatriation 
can be clarified on Form P85, which covers all the technicalities regarding 
your of date of departure, intention of remaining overseas, and any assets 
(such as property) left behind in the UK.   
 
If you're uncertain as to the length of time you'll be overseas, submit P85 
with an accompanying letter or a copy of your contract from your 
employer. This documentation should confirm that your employment 
period would be for at least one full tax year so that you may be classified 
as not ordinarily resident or not resident.   
 
The vital importance of this form is that you'll receive feedback from 
Inland Revenue confirming your tax status with regards to residency. This 
not only ties up a possible loose end, it's also useful when communicating 
with the new tax department (if any) in your new country of residence.   
 
One final benefit is that you could be eligible for a tax rebate on tax 
already remitted in your tax year of departure.   
  
  
How To Change Your Domicile   
 
Getting rid of your UK Domicile designation is a little more difficult than 
changing your residency and ordinary residency status. You must take 
more extensive actions to remove this final albatross from around your 
neck if you truly wish to be free of UK inheritance tax on your worldwide 
assets.   

The Essential Underground Handbook 
113 
 
You absolutely must show detailed proof that you've left the UK on a 
permanent basis. The following list is an indicator of what you should be 
prepared to do to change your domicile:  
 
Leave the UK, become a UK non- resident, and acquire residency in 
your new country   
 
Survive (and hopefully thrive) in your new country for at least 3 full tax 
years, preferably more   
 
Become a citizen of your new country   
 
Buy a house in your new country   
 
Make a will under the laws of your new country, and   
 
Don’t return to visit the UK any more than absolutely necessary   
 
Acquiring a new domicile is quite important for ensuring preferential tax 
treatment once you leave the UK.   
 
Now here's a breakdown of how income- (and other revenue-) sourcing 
coincides with your planned tax status in the UK.   
 
Income Tax Treatment for Residents and Non-Residents   
 
From Inland Revenue's taxation viewpoint, you could have three different 
sources of income (letter designations are for the purposes of this section 
only):   
 
A- income earned inside the UK   
 
B- the offshore portion of a combined UK & offshore income (i.e. your 
employment is both UK- and offshore based)   
 
C- income earned wholly outside the UK   
 
To determine if your income is wholly earned outside the UK (or not), 
Inland Revenue decides if your UK-related job duties are considered 
"incidental" to your job. If they're incidental, then your income would fall 
under type C rather than a combination of type A and B. Depending on 
your residency status, this distinction could render you tax-free under UK 
law. Some examples of job duties that are not incidental (considered type 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
114 
A and therefore taxable):   
 
Attendance at directors' meetings in the UK by a director of the 
company who normally works abroad   
 
Visits to the UK as a member of the crew of a ship or aircraft   
 
Visits to the UK in the course of work by a courier  
 
Examples of job duties that are considered incidental (rendering your 
income type C):   
 
Visits to the UK by an overseas representative of a UK employer to 
report to the employer or to receive fresh instructions   
 
Training in the UK by an overseas employee if and only if the total 
time spent in the UK for training is no more than 91 days in a year, 
and also no productive work is done in the UK during the training   
 
Now that we've established the criteria for types A, B, and C, here's how 
they apply to the various states of UK residency (or non-residency):   
 
If you're still a UK resident (and ordinarily resident), you already know 
that you must pay tax on any income arising under either A and B. If 
you have wholly foreign earnings (C), these earnings are not 
necessarily taxable unless you remit (deposit) the money into the UK.   
 
If you're a UK resident (but not deemed ordinarily resident), your 
situation is much the same, save that you're solely liable for tax on A. 
The B portion of your earnings (if any) is not taxable unless remitted 
into the UK. C remains untaxed unless remitted, as before.   
 
If you're no longer a resident or ordinarily resident, you're taxed only 
upon UK-based income (A). Any income earned outside the UK is 
tax-free regardless of whether or not you remit it to the UK. However, 
we should point out that remitting foreign income to the UK is 
perhaps not the most intelligent strategy to follow if you are trying to 
expatriate and prove your intentions of living elsewhere.   
 
 
Pension Income for Residents and Non-Residents   
 
If you're resident in the UK and receive a UK pension, you'll be taxed on it 
regardless of your ordinary residency or domicile status. You'll obtain UK 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
115 
tax relief on your UK pension only if you're a non-resident of the UK.   
 
On the other hand, if you receive a pension from overseas, you're liable 
for UK tax on it if you're both resident and domiciled in the UK. However, if 
you're:   
 
Resident but not domiciled in the UK, or   
 
Resident but not ordinarily resident in the UK, and either a 
Commonwealth citizen (which includes a British citizen) or a citizen of 
the Republic of Ireland   
 
Then that overseas pension is tax-free unless you remit the funds into the 
UK.   
 
And of course, if you're a non-resident, your overseas pension is tax-free.   
 
 
Carrying On a Trade or Profession for Residents and Non- Residents   
 
You are liable for tax on the entire earnings of any trade or profession 
(even if you're a non-resident), based wholly or partly in the UK. However, 
if your professional earnings are wholly offshore, you're liable for UK tax 
only if you're both resident and domiciled in the UK. See points 1 and 2 in 
Pension Income (above) for the two exceptions to rendering your 
overseas income tax- free until it is remitted into the UK.   
 
 
Investment Income for Residents and Non-Residents   
 
If you're a resident, you must pay tax on all investment (i.e. non-pension) 
income. As before, see points 1 and 2 in Pension Income (above) for the 
two exceptions to rendering your overseas income tax-free until it is 
remitted into the UK.   
 
If you're a non-resident, you'll be taxed on all UK-related investment 
income, but all offshore investment income is tax-free.   
 
Capital Gains for Residents and Non-Residents   
 
If you're a UK resident or ordinarily resident, you'll be liable for capital gains 
on all your UK-based assets.   
 
As far as overseas assets are concerned, being resident but not ordinarily 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
116 
resident will allow you to avoid capital gains tax unless you remit the funds 
to the UK. (Having both residency designations makes you liable, 
regardless).   
 
It is only when you're both not resident and not ordinarily resident that you 
can avoid capital gains tax. However, you'll only to avoid the tax if you 
were neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK for at least four of the 
seven tax years immediately preceding the tax year in which you leave 
the UK.   
 
Regardless of your UK residence status, there is some good news - you 
generally won't be billed for capital gains tax on the following 
transactions:   
 
Transferring an asset to your spouse   
 
Disposing of private motor vehicles   
 
Disposing of household goods and personal effects up to a value of 
£6,000 per item   
 
Disposing of a private home which has been treated as your only or 
main residence throughout the time you have owned it   
 
On gains arising from certain other assets - for example Save-As-You-
Earn (SAYE) terminal bonuses, National Savings Certificates, Premium 
Bonds and investments held within an Individual Savings Account or 
Personal Equity Plan   
 
Also, gains on the disposal of gilt-edged securities and qualifying 
corporate bonds are exempt from capital gains tax

12. How to Beat Big Brother and other Scammers 
 
Choosing and interacting with an offshore supplier  
 
Choose a reputable supplier that has been recommended to you by 
close friends or associates. If you are not aware of any such 
recommendations, try to get hunches on your prospective supplier's real 
intentions. Trust your feelings, but don't be guided by greed.   
 
Do not discuss personal details or your personal opinions about political 
matters, revolutionary plans etc. with your supplier. It's better to keep your 
daydreams and secret plans to overthrow the government to yourself as 
anything you write could be used against you later if it gets into the wrong 
hands, and if your online communications are ever traced back to your 
real identity.   
 
Make sure that you do not get to know your supplier personally and that 
they don't know anything about you - not your name, not your 
occupation, not even the country where you are located. NEVER meet 
your supplier!   
 
Do not use the phone or fax machine. Use PGP to communicate with your 
supplier.   
 
 
Scammers and Government Agents   
 
Both scammers and government agents try to present you a "perfect 
world" and their "perfect solution" in order to get you to move forward. 
There is no perfect world or perfect solution. Honesty is rare in today's 
business world; if you find a supplier who "tells it all" and gives you an 
unbiased overview of the facts you can count yourself lucky!   
 
Scammers are often overly aggressive in their approach and promise you 
(or imply) instant & immediate freedom if you just send them the money. 
Watch out for artificial enthusiasm and attempts to get you overly 
excited!   
 
Many suppliers who don't ask for any money up-front have no intentions 
to make any, nor to deliver the promised services. The reason is obvious - 
they are in bed with Big Brother, as scammers would at least take the 
money!   
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
118 
Be aware that there are many crooks on the client side as well! A 
responsible supplier will try to minimize the risk for all concerned. Assist 
them in this approach.   
 
Bureaucrats are sometimes very easy to identify from their style as they 
are, well, bureaucrats. Watch out for inconsistencies. If you discover any, 
ask for an immediate explanation. If the answer doesn't satisfy you, cut off 
all contact immediately.   
 
Check whether your supplier shows you both sides of the coin, or tries to 
push a specific program from a particular country, and loses interest in 
you if you suggest a different program. If this is the case you can bet that 
you're communicating with an agent from the very country he is trying to 
"push" - or to "invite" you to.   
 
 
Ordering and Receiving "Documents", "Corporations", "Bank Accounts"   
 
Be prepared to pay at least a partial amount up-front. Send only money 
once you are completely comfortable with the supplier. Never send 
money you cannot afford to lose in case something goes wrong.   
 
If you receive your documents by mail, use an anonymous forwarding 
address (mail drop) in a third party country which you have established 
through a different, unrelated supplier. For additional security link several 
mail drops together in a chain.   
 
If you receive your documents by personal courier, be sure to meet this 
courier in a third party country, i.e. neither the country of issuance nor the 
country of your residency. Better still, send a courier yourself (who can 
always say he knows nothing) to pick up your documents.   
 
If you order an offshore bank account, insist that you will reveal your 
identity only directly to the offshore bank. Don't give any of your details to 
your provider (other than an anonymous email address). Pay for the 
service by anonymous Western Union transfer.   
 
Better still, always use an offshore identity (i.e. offshore mail drop plus 
banking passport) when shopping for offshore services.

Chapter Four 
Company Formations 
 
There are a variety of reasons for forming your own corporation or Limited 
Liability Company. In this chapter we explore company formations in the 
US, the UK and International jurisdictions. 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
127 
1. How to set up a Corporation or LLC 
 
Corporations and Limited Liability Companies provide a degree of 
protection for you and your business. The information below is relevant to 
the US. We will also take a look at forming Limited Companies in the UK a 
little later on in this chapter. 
 
 
The Advantage of a Limited Liability Company 
 
A Limited Liability Company has the advantage of being a hybrid 
between a partnership and a Corporation.  The advantage of a Limited 
Liability Company is that most states require fewer formalities be observed                     
in an LLC in comparison to a corporation.  
 
Advantage:  One LLC Member Required. Historically, most states require 
that a Limited Liability Company be comprised of at least two LLC 
members.  Today most states and the IRS recognize the single-member 
LLC as a legitimate business structure.  
 
Separate Legal Entity. Like limited partnerships and corporations, the 
Limited Liability Company shares a similar advantage -- it is recognized as 
a separate legal entity from its "members." 
 
Limited Liability. Ordinarily, only the LLC is responsible for the company's 
debts thus shielding the members from individual liability. However, there 
are some exceptions where individual members may be held liable:  
 
Guarantor 
Liability: 
Where 
an 
LLC 
member 
has 
personally 
guaranteed the obligations of the LLC, he or she will be liable. For 
example, where an LLC is relatively new and has no credit history, a 
prospective landlord about to lease office space to the LLC will most 
likely require a personal guarantee from the LLC members before 
executing such a lease.  
 
Alter Ego Liability: Very similar to the judicial doctrine applied to 
corporations where a court may hold the individual shareholders 
liable where the business entity is merely the "Alter Ego" of its 
shareholders, a member of an LLC may also be held liable for the 
LLCs debts if the court imposes its "alter ego liability" doctrine.  
 
Please note, however, that although a corporation's failure to hold 
shareholder or director meetings may subject the corporation to alter 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
128 
ego liability, this is not the case for LLCs in California. An LLC's failure 
to hold meetings of members or managers is not usually considered 
grounds for imposing the alter ego doctrine where the LLCs Articles of 
Organization or Operating Agreement do not expressly require such 
meetings.  
 
LLC Management and control. Management and control of an LLC is 
vested with its members unless the Limited Liability Company's articles of 
organization provide otherwise.  
 
Voting Interest. Ordinarily, voting interest in an LLC directly corresponds to 
interest in profits, unless the articles of organization or operating 
agreement provide otherwise  
 
Transferability.  No one can become a member of an LLC (either by 
transfer of an existing membership or the issuance of a new one) without 
the consent of members having a majority in interest (excluding the 
person acquiring the membership interest) unless the articles of 
organization provide otherwise.  
 
Duration.  An LLC does not have a reliable continuity of existence. The                           
articles of organization must specify the date on which the Limited Liability 
Company's existence will terminate.  Unless otherwise provided in the 
articles of organization or a written operating agreement, an LLC is 
dissolved at the death, withdrawal, resignation, expulsion, or bankruptcy 
of a member (unless within 90 days a majority in both the profits and 
capital interests vote to continue the LLC)  
 
Advantage: Formalities. The existence of an LLC begins upon the filing of 
the Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State.   The articles must 
be on the form prescribed by the Secretary of State. Among the required 
information on the form is the latest date at which the LLC is to dissolve 
and a statement as to whether the LLC will be managed by one 
manager, more than one manager, or the members. 
 
To validly complete the formation of the LLC, members must enter into an 
Operating Agreement. This Operating Agreement may come into 
existence either before or after the filing of the Articles of Organization 
and may be either oral or in writing. 
 
 
Forming a Corporation or LLC 
 
To form a LLC you will need to prepare ‘Articles of Organization’ and in 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
129 
some states ‘Operating Agreements’. You will also need to decide which 
state your LLC will be formed in and who and where its registered agent 
and office is going to be. 
 
Articles of Organization for an LLC  
 
The articles of organization are the founding documents of the LLC. Once 
filed, the LLC begins its existence as a limited liability company. Articles of 
organization are considered to be the controlling provisions in an LLC; 
therefore, conflicting provisions in other LLC forms or documents (the 
operating agreement, member agreements, or corporate/llc resolutions) 
would thus have no significance.  
 
Sample LLC Articles of Organization  
 
The provisions that are required in an LLC's Articles of Organization will vary 
amongst the different states.  In general, however, most states require that 
a limited liability company's articles of organization contain at least the 
following information:  
 
The name of the LLC 
  
The mailing address of the proposed entity  
 
The name and address of a registered agent in the state of filing.  this 
must be a physical address.  
 
The name and address of the LLC's organizer  
 
The LLC's stated period of duration or date of termination  
 
Some states may require that your articles of organization list the 
name and address information for each LLC member  
 
The signature of the Organizer or person filing the articles of 
organization  
 
The Registered Agent listed in the LLC Articles of Organization  
 
Most states require that an LLC have a Registered Agent who maintains a 
registered office within the state of formation.  This Registered Office may 
be at an address that is different from the LLC's business address (as where 
the LLC's business office is not located within the state).  
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
130 
Most often, YOU may act as registered agent for your limited liability 
company.  Please note, however, that your Registered Agent Address as 
stated in your Articles of Organization MUST be within the state of 
formation.  Furthermore, the registered agent address MAY NOT be a post 
office box.  
 
The main purpose of including the registered Agent information in your 
articles of organization is to provide potential claimants against your LLC 
with a designated person who is authorized to receive service of process 
on behalf of the LLC.  Because your articles of organization will be a 
matter of public record, potential claimants can merely research public 
records to retrieve your LLC's registered agent information in order to serve 
your LLC with a subpoena or summons.  
 
LLC Articles of Organization and Public Records  
 
To prevent process servers, unsolicited sales calls, and junk mail from being 
delivered to your home address by individuals marketing to "registered 
agents," consider using a service such as MyCorporation.com as your 
registered agent for your LLC.  By using our their registered agent services, 
their registered agent information will be designated in your articles of 
organization. 
 
 
Operating Agreement  
 
After the Articles of Organization , the LLC operating agreement is one of 
the most important documents in your LLC. While many states do not 
require that this LLC operating agreement be in writing, best practice 
dictates that agreements amongst Members be memorialized in writing, 
especially once your LLC begins to earn profits and  hold assets.  
 
The Member-Managed LLC Operating Agreement  
 
The typical agreement usually ranges from 12 to 16 pages in length 
depending on its complexity, and contains the following information:  
 
Company name and address information 
Registered agent information  
Name and address information for each LLC member  
LLC management structure and operation 
Items contributed by each Member 
Fair market value of each item contributed 
Date of company dissolution  

The Essential Underground Handbook 
131 
Accounting method 
Tax treatment for your LLC 
Sample LLC operating resolutions 
Appointment of LLC officers 
Designation of a final capital pay-in date 
 
LLC Meetings  
 
While many states do not require that your Limited Liability Company hold 
meetings on a regularly scheduled basis it's always wise to conduct 
meetings with your members to ensure the LLC is in agreement in all its 
endeavors.  
 
Opening a Bank Account  
 
Most banks require only a copy of your Articles of Organization and your 
federal Employer ID Number to open a bank account. Some, however, 
may also require a resolution passed by the Limited Liability Company's 
members and a copy of the LLC Operating Agreement before                           
opening an account. To better determine your bank's requirements, you 
Should contact the branch manager and ask about their requirements for 
New Accounts. 
 
 
Where to form an LLC 
 
Under which state’s laws should an LLC be formed?   State laws governing 
LLCs vary from state to state.  However, if the LLC will have significant 
business or member contacts (a.k.a. "presence") within a state, there is 
usually not much reason to form the entity outside of that state. For 
example, forming a California LLC for a business centered in California is 
usually the logical choice for the following reasons:  
 
Filing Fees: An out-of-state LLC that will be conducting business in 
California must "qualify" to do business in California. This "qualifying” 
requires the LLC to pay filing fees to the California Secretary of in addition 
to whatever filing fees were paid in the state of LLC Formation. California's 
filing fees and franchise taxes for "qualifying” to do business in California 
are the same for an LLC formed in California as they are for a foreign LLC 
(e.g. and LLC formed in Delaware).  
 
State Taxes: An out-of-state LLC doing business in California will have                           
to pay franchise taxes to California. The corporation may also have to                           
pay taxes and annual fees in its state of formation (even if the LLC is                            

The Essential Underground Handbook 
132 
not conducting business in that state). Thus, the LLC is potentially exposed                           
to taxing by more than one state.  
 
Corporate Rules: Regardless of where the LLC is formed, many provisions 
of California Law, for example, apply if the LLC has a sufficient "presence" 
in California. 
 
 
A Simple Solution 
 
Filing and preparing company formation documents can be a daunting 
task, especially if this is your first company. I would advise making use of 
one of the many company formation agents available on the Internet. 
The agents will properly prepare your Articles and submit them for you. 
The next time you need to form a company you can then use these 
documents as a template. Below is a list of several company formation 
agents that can prepare documents according to the requirements of all 
52 states.

2. UK Company Formations 
 
In comparison to the US with its varying State rules and regulations, 
forming a UK Limited Liability Company (LTD) is a relatively straightforward 
process. 
 
What type of companies are there  
 
There are four main types of company:  
 
Private company limited by shares: Members' liability is limited to the 
amount unpaid on shares they hold.  
 
Private Company Limited by guarantee: Members' liability is limited to the 
amount they have agreed to contribute to the company's assets if it is 
wound up.  
 
Private Unlimited Company: - here is no limit to the members' liability.  
 
Public Limited Company (PLC): - the company's shares may be offered for 
sale to the general public and members' liability is limited to the amount 
unpaid on shares held by them.  
 
Who can form a company?  
 
The Companies Act generally allows one or more persons to form a 
company for any lawful purpose by subscribing to its memorandum of 
association. However, a public company or an unlimited company must 
have at least two subscribers. 
 
How do I form a company?  
 
Ready-made companies are available from company formation agents.  
If you incorporate a company yourself, you will need to send the following 
documents, together with the registration fee of £20 to the Registrar of 
Companies: 
 
A memorandum of association  
Articles of association 
Form 10  
Form 12 
 
Each of these documents is explained below.  

The Essential Underground Handbook 
134 
 
Memorandum of Association 
 
The Memorandum of Association is document which sets out the objects 
of a company (this can be very generic) 
 
Articles of Association  
 
This document sets out the rules for the running of the company’s internal 
affairs and also a list of subscribers to the company. (Shareholders) 
 
Form 10  
 
Form 10 gives details of the first director(s), secretary and the intended 
address of the registered office. As well as their names and addresses, the 
company's directors must give their date of birth, occupation and details 
of other directorships they have held within the last five years. Each officer 
appointed and each subscriber (or their agent) must sign and date the 
form.  
 
Officers acting as both director and secretary: The same person can be 
both a director and company secretary, provided there is another 
director. A sole director cannot also be the company secretary.  
 
Form 12  
 
Form 12 is a statutory declaration of compliance with all the legal 
requirements relating to the incorporation of a company. It must be 
signed by a solicitor who is forming the company, or by one of the people 
named as a director or company secretary on Form 10. It must be signed 
in the presence of a commissioner for oaths, a notary public, a justice of 
the peace or a solicitor.  
 
Signing the declaration on Form 12: Form 12 must be signed and dated 
after all the other documents are signed and dated. This is because Form 
12 confirms that all other registration requirements have been completed.  
 
The form must clearly show if a person has signed on behalf of a 
corporate director. If it appears that the person who signed is not a 
director, this will cause delay.  
 
 
Registered Office  
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
135 
It is the address of a company to which Companies House letters and 
reminders will be sent. The registered office can be anywhere in England 
and Wales (or Scotland if your company is registered there). The 
registered office must always be an effective address for delivering 
documents to the company, and to avoid delays it is important that all 
correspondence sent to this address is dealt with promptly.  If a company 
changes its registered office address after incorporation, the new address 
must be notified to Companies House on Form 287. 
 
Valid addresses  
 
Companies House uses the Post Office address file to verify addresses; so, 
to avoid delays, please ensure that your proposed registered office 
address is recognized by the Post Office and always give the correct 
postcode on forms sent for registration.  
 
What is the minimum number of officers a company requires?  
 
Every company must have formally appointed company officers at all 
times.  
 
A private company must have at least:  
 
One director - but the company's articles of association may require            
more than one. 
 
One secretary - formal qualifications are not required. A company's 
sole director cannot also be the company secretary.  
 
Can anyone be a company director?  
 
In general terms, yes, but there are some rules. You can't be a company 
director if: 
 
You are an undischarged bankrupt or disqualified by a court from holding 
a directorship, unless given leave to act in respect of a particular 
company or companies; 
 
There is no minimum age limit in the Companies Act for a director to be 
appointed in England and Wales. However, he or she must be able to 
consent to their own appointment. You should seek legal advice if you   
intend to have a very young person as a director of your company.  
 
In Scotland the Registrar will not register for any company the 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
136 
appointment of a director under the age of 16 years old. A child below 
that age does not have the legal capacity to accept a directorship - Age 
of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991.  If you need more information, 
contact Companies House, Edinburgh. 
 
Some people not of British nationality are restricted as to what work they 
may do while in this country. If you need more information about whether 
such a person can become a director of a UK-registered company, 
contact:  
 
Home Office Immigration and Nationality Department  
Lunar House  
Wellesley Road  
Croydon  
CR9 2BY   (Tel: 020 8686 0688)  
 
 
What happens to the documents sent to the Registrar?  
 
All company formation documents are subject to certain checks 
including checks of prospective officers against the disqualified directors’ 
register.  
 
The Registrar then keeps the documents and makes them available for          
public inspection.  
 
Can I choose any name I want for my company?  
 
No. There are some restrictions on your choice of company name. Take a 
look at the following booklet on guidelines for company names: 
 
http://ws1.companieshouse.gov.uk/notes/gbf2.html 
 
Briefly, the restrictions are that:  
 
You cannot register the same name as another company;  
The use of certain words is restricted; and  
Names likely to cause offence are not allowed. 
 
It is also important to check whether your chosen name is similar to any 
other names already on the register.  If your chosen name is too like 
another name, an objection could be made within the 12 months 
following the incorporation of your company and you could be directed 
by the Secretary of State to change the company's name.

shares in respect of which the commission is payable are issued. 
 
SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT 
 
7.1.1 
The instrument of transfer of a share shall be signed by or on behalf of 
the transferor, and the transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of 
the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register of 
Members in respect thereof; provided that in the case of a partly paid 
share the instrument of transfer must also be signed by the transferee. 
 
7.1.2 
The Directors shall refuse to register any transfer of shares made in 
contravention of the provisions of Article (2) but shall not be entitled to 
refuse to register any transfer of shares made pursuant to paragraph 
7.1.3 of this Article or pursuant to Article (2) or any transfer to which the 
consent in writing of all Members for the time being of the Company is 
given. 
 
7.1.3 
(a) Any Member being a corporation may transfer any shares to another 
corporation resulting from a re-construction or amalgamation of such 
Member or to any subsidiary or holding company (as those expressions 
are defined in Section 736 of the Companies Act 1985) of such Member 
or to another subsidiary of such holding company. 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
146

otherwise dispose of on death any shares to the husband, wife, widow, 
widower or any child or children of such Member.

The Directors shall register as a Member or Members the legal personal 
representatives of a deceased member where under the provisions of the 
Will or the laws as to intestacy the person beneficially entitled, whether 
immediately or contingently, to the shares in respect of which such legal 
personal representatives  are intended to be registered, are persons to 
whom a transfer may be made under the provisions of paragraph 
7.1.3(b) of this Article. 
 
7.2    Subject and without prejudice to paragraphs 7.1.2, 7.1.3 and 7.1.4 of 
Article (1), the following provisions shall have effect in relation to the 
transfer and transmission of shares, namely: 
 
7.2.1 
Any Member who desires to sell any legal or beneficial interest in any 
shares (in this Article called "the Vendor") shall give to the Company 
notice in writing (in this Article called "a transfer notice") accompanied by 
the deposit of the relevant Share Certificate of such desire and stating 
the number of shares which the Member desires to sell. A transfer notice 
may not relate to more than one class of shares and it shall not be 
revocable except with the sanction of the Directors. 
 
7.2.2 
A transfer notice shall constitute the necessary authority for the Directors 
to be the Vendor’s agents for the sale in the manner provided by this 
Article of the shares to which the transfer notice relates at a price to be 
agreed between the Directors and the Vendor or, in default of agreement 
within 30 days of the date of the transfer notice, at a price which the 
Auditors for the time being of the Company shall certify in writing to be in 
their opinion the fair selling value thereof as between a willing vendor 
and a willing purchaser and in so certifying the Auditors shall be 
considered to be acting as experts and not as arbitrators. 
 
7.2.3 
If the Auditors are asked to certify the fair selling value as aforesaid, the 
Directors shall as soon as they receive the Auditors Certificate furnish a 
certified copy thereof to the Vendor and the Vendor shall be entitled, by 
notice in writing given to the Company within seven days of the service 
upon him of the said certified copy, to cancel the Directors’ authority to 
sell the said shares. The cost of obtaining the certificate shall be borne 
(by the Company) (by the Purchasers) unless the Vendor shall cancel 
the Director’s authority as aforesaid in which case the Vendor shall bear 
such cost. On receipt from the Vendor of a notice of cancellation as 
aforesaid the relevant Share Certificate shall be returned to the Vendor. 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
147 
7.2.4 
Within seven days after the price shall have been fixed as mentioned in 
paragraph 7.2.2 of this Article or after seven days referred to in 
paragraph 7.2.3 have expired (as the case may be), the Directors shall 
give notice to all the Members (other than the Vendor) holding shares of 
the same class as the shares comprised in the transfer notice of the 
number and price of those shares, and shall invite each of them to state 
in writing within twenty one days, after the date of the notice whether he 
is willing to purchase any and if so what maximum number of the said 
shares. 
 
7.2.5 
If within the period of twenty one days mentioned in paragraph 7.2.4 of 
this Article Members to whom the notice therein mentioned was given 
have expressed their willingness to purchase all of the shares comprised 
in the transfer notice the Directors shall allocate those shares among 
those Members so far as may be necessary pro rata to their existing 
shareholdings, subject to the limitation that no Member shall be under 
any obligation to purchase more than the maximum number of shares 
which he himself has notified as being willing to purchase. As soon as 
such allocation has been made and provided that such allocation 
comprises all the shares to which the transfer notice relates (but not 
otherwise), the Vendor shall be bound, on payment of the price, to 
transfer those shares to the purchaser or respective Purchasers thereof, 
and if he shall make default in so doing the Directors shall receive and 
give a good discharge for the purchase money on behalf of the Vendor 
and shall authorise some person (who shall be deemed to be the 
attorney of the Vendor for that purpose) to execute in favour of the 
Purchaser or respective Purchasers a transfer or transfers of the shares 
allocated to him or them and shall enter his or their names in the 
Register of Members as the holder of those shares. 
 
7.2.6 
If within the period of twenty one days mentioned in paragraph 7.2.4 of 
this Article Members to whom the notice therein mentioned was given 
shall have expressed their willingness to purchase part only of the shares 
comprised in the transfer notice or no such Member shall have 
expressed his willingness to purchase any of those shares the Directors 
shall within seven days after expiration of that period give notice to all the 
Members (including the Members referred to in paragraph 7.2.4 of this 
Article but excluding the Vendor) and the provisions of paragraphs 7.2.4 
and 7.2.5 of this Article shall apply mutatis mutandis to every notice 
given pursuant to this paragraph. 
 
7.2.7 
If within the period referred to in any notice pursuant to paragraph 7.2.4 
of this Article the Members shall have expressed their willingness to 
purchase part only of the shares comprised in the transfer notice or no 
Member shall have expressed his willingness to purchase any of those 
shares, then for a further period of three months from the expiration of 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
148 
the said period the Vendor shall be entitled to transfer to any person 
whom he selects all but not part of the shares to which the transfer notice 
relates at a price not lower than the price fixed as mentioned in 
paragraph 7.2.2 of this Article and on the terms not less favourable than 
those offered in the transfer notice. 
 
7.2.8 
(a) If any person (other than an existing shareholder or pursuant to 
Article 7.1.3(b)) shall become entitled to any shares by reason of the 
death or bankruptcy of any Member he shall forthwith give to the 
Company notice in writing to that effect, and if that person shall fail to 
give such notice the Directors may give notice on his behalf. 
 
(b) All the foregoing provisions of this Article in relation to a transfer 
notice and the procedure to be adopted following the service of such a 
notice shall apply mutatis mutandis to a notice given pursuant to (a) 
above which shall accordingly be deemed to be a transfer notice in 
respect of all of the shares to which such a person has become entitled 
provided however that there shall be no right pursuant to paragraph 7.2.2 
to cancel the Directors’ authority to sell any of the shares. 
 
7.2.9 
If any shares to which any person has become entitled on death or 
bankruptcy of any Member shall not be sold pursuant to paragraph 7.2.8, 
then after the expiration of the period during which such shares might 
have been purchased by the Member or Members pursuant thereto such 
person shall, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to 
time be required by the Directors, have the right to elect either to be 
registered himself as the holder of the shares in question or to have 
some person nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof, but 
in either case the Directors shall have the same right to refuse or 
suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of 
the shares in question by the deceased or bankrupt Member before his 
death or bankruptcy. Regulations 30 and 31 of Table A shall not apply.

3. How to set up International Business Corporations 
 
International Business Corporations (IBC’s) can for an effective tax barrier 
or asset protector for most situations. The complexities involved in setting 
these up varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and typically requires a 
registered office in the country of your choice. 
 
There are basically two ways in which you can go about forming an 
offshore corporation; 1. By contacting a lawyer in the desired country and 
negotiating a rate for his services. 2. Using a standard company formation 
agent that offers these services. 
 
We have found that on the whole, contacting a lawyer in the country 
and explaining your requirements then engaging them to perform the set-
up and act as registered agents and/or a registered address is the 
cheapest and most secure way of doing this. On the other hand, using a 
formation agent can be quicker and more convenient depending on the 
situation. 
 
Below is a list of formation agents that actively form International Business 
Corporations.

Private Investigation, 
Security & Surveillance 
 
The methods and techniques that are used by Private Investigators in their 
day-to-day work can be invaluable to the rest of us. In this section you will 
learn some of the essential methods of the Private Investigator. You will 
almost certainly find these often deceptively simple techniques to be of 
great usefulness in your daily life.

1. Performing Background Checks 
 
There are various reasons why you may want to perform background 
checks on people. Maybe you want this information to check out a new 
employee or to find out about a potential business partner or even 
someone you are thinking of having a relationship with. Whatever you are 
planning to use the information for, this section describes some types of 
information that may be accessible to you and explains different ways to 
access this information. 
 
It is a common misconception that private individuals are not allowed 
access to many types of government records. This is often not the case. 
Currently in the US, for example, nineteen states allow private individuals 
to access criminal conviction records from state repositories (a list of these 
is included for reference further on in the document). It is worth finding out 
exactly what records are available for public consumption in whatever 
region and country you are interested. While some of the following 
content has specific examples based in the US, the general principles are 
applicable in many other countries. 
 
 
Accessing Courthouse Records 
 
Background investigations carried out by private investigators in the US 
often lean heavily on the fact that many courthouse records are quite 
readily accessible. Generally, most courthouse records are public records 
and can be reviewed by just about anyone. A complete courthouse 
records check can often provide a great deal of information concerning 
most people who live in the county. 
 
The different departments in the courthouse give us some indication of 
the sort of data that may be available: 
 
• Circuit Civil Records 
• Small Claim Civil Records 
• Auto tag registration 
• Fishing And Hunting License 
• Real Estate Property Records 
• Traffic Records 
• County Criminal Records 
• Voter Registration 
• General Index Records 
• Marriage Records 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
156 
• Building Permits 
• County Police Records 
• Tax Records 
• Business License 
• Probate Records 
• Circuit Criminal Records 
• Mobile Home Registration 
 
The list could go on through a dozen or so minor records kept by the 
county. The point is that a courthouse records search can be used very 
effectively for a fast background investigation in the development of all 
kinds of information on any one person living within the county. In fact, a 
courthouse records check is a standard part of insurance claims 
investigations and is often used in a skip trace. 
 
One of the secrets in going to the courthouse to check courthouse 
records is that a lot of people just do not know such an all-encompassing 
investigation can be done. For example, lawyers might know to have their 
clerk check auto tag registration from time to time but most have no idea 
that a complete investigative profile can be worked up on someone in a 
very short time checking all kinds of records. Even some investigators who 
are somewhat familiar with record checks have no idea such a great 
volume of information can be found at the courthouse. They tend to think 
of records at the courthouse in various departments and run down one 
day to check tax rolls unaware of the fact that needed information could 
be pulled from several dozen or so other departments. 
 
If you are not that familiar with your county's courthouse records it will take 
you some time to get used to them. You might find several departments 
that will not just give any stranger who walks in access to the records. 
However, once they know who you are and what you are doing you will 
generally be able to walk right in and start digging.  
 
Indexing of records takes various forms. You will find some small county 
records use old ledger systems. Other types of record indexing systems will 
be kept on microfiche units. The most modern counties will have 
everything on computer. You may or may not need a clerk to help you 
look up the indexes. Almost all indexes are sectioned by year or month 
and then list the names in alphabetical order. 
 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
157 
 
 
Old Telephone Directories 
 
You can find these old directories at the public library in your city. Most 
libraries keep old directories dating back fifty years. Look up the subject's 
name and when you find an old address for them, go to the Henderson 
Directory and locate their former neighbours. Begin calling them. If you 
are patient, you are likely to find some neighbours who still remember the 
subject 
and 
who 
can 
provide 
important 
historical 
background 
information. 
 
 
Birth Records of the Subject's Children 
 
These will show the address of the parents (your subject) at the time of the 
child's birth. You must know the town or district where the child was born 
to find out a former address. These records are at the Department of Vital 
Statistics. The subject's birth records also can be used but are not likely to 
be as helpful, since you can only learn the location of the subject's birth 
and not their adult residences. 
 
Marriage and Divorce Records 
 
These records may be found at the Department of Vital Statistics and the 
Courthouse, respectively. They are also good sources for locating a 
subject's former addresses. Divorce records usually contain valuable 
information about the subject's assets, real and personal property, former 
associates and friends. The latter can be contacted through telephone 
pretext (see below).  
 
Bankruptcy, Civil and Criminal Records 
 
By following search procedures previously discussed, you will find a 
subject's address at the time a bankruptcy, civil or criminal action was 
filed. 
 
Criminal Records Searches 
 
Criminal records can reveal a lot of startling information about individuals. 
Typically criminal records searches are carried out at the local county 
level. At the time of writing, nineteen states allow private individuals to 
access criminal conviction records. These states are listed below.

2. Pretext 
 
Pretext is a technique that investigators use in order to obtain information 
by deception. It is much frowned upon in some circles, but it remains one 
of the most useful techniques for a skilled investigator. Ethical 
considerations aside, some uses of pretext are legal and others illegal and 
yet others exist in a grey area somewhere between the two. If you plan on 
using pretext then you need to make sure you understand which uses of 
pretext could be considered illegal so that you can safely avoid them. 
 
You may not feel comfortable with using deception to gain information. 
This is an entirely personal ethical standpoint on which I will make no 
comment – I am not trying to be a moral guide here. Suffice it to say that 
you must make a decision for yourself whether the benefits you are 
hoping to gain from using deception outweigh any negative factors that 
may be involved. One important point that I hope you will come away 
with after reading this section though is that if you are approached by an 
inquisitive stranger asking questions about a person or situation you are or 
have been acquainted with, things may not always be as they appear. 
You should be on your guard in such situations and stay aware that 
someone may be using pretext to gain information from you. 
 
 
Telephone Pretexts 
 
The telephone is certainly the most common tool in the use of pretext. Like 
other forms of pretext, telephone pretext can be illegal, so you must be 
very careful. Telephone pretext involves calling someone and pretending 
to be someone else in order to get information about a third party. You 
may be pretending to be an insurance agent, a friend of a third party, a 
landlord and so on. The beauty of using the telephone is that the person 
on the other end will never see you, so you can be sat at home or in your 
office pretending to be someone totally different and be very convincing 
about it. Used properly this method will enable you to get access to a 
whole host of useful information about almost any subject. 
 
A note regarding the legality of this method of information gathering; 
never pretend to be a law enforcement officer, a doctor, a lawyer or a 
member of any real organisation – In most areas of the US, this is illegal.  
 
We will now go on to look at potential targets for telephone pretext. 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
161 
1. Employers 
 
Current and past employers can provide valuable information concerning 
a subject. By questioning these sources over the phone in the correct 
way, you can often get detailed information such as the following: 
  
• Is the subject responsible and dependable? 
• Did they steal anything from the company? 
• Do they get along well with other employees? 
• Do they have any problem with alcohol or drugs or any other 
personal problems? 
 
A good pretext to use when calling employers is to tell them that the 
subject is applying for a job with your company and then ask the usual 
sort of questions that might be expected on a pre-employment check. 
Remember, the friendlier you are with the person you are talking with 
(within reason), the more information you can hope to get. You should 
aim to strike up a good ‘professional’ rapport with the person on the other 
end of the phone. Do not be too casual as this may give away your 
pretext – you are calling in a ‘professional’ capacity, so stay professional 
but friendly. One good way to get the person to open up a bit more is to 
use leading questions based around facts you already know of the 
subject – e.g. “I heard that Mike has a penchant for gambling – did that 
affect his work much?” 
 
As an aside, if you plan on using telephone pretext much; you should 
understand some basic psychology. There are various techniques that 
can allow you to get more information out of people over the phone, and 
there are various sources to learn these from. One good source of 
information that can offer valuable assistance with this subject is to read 
some of the works of the so-called ‘psychological illusionists’. People such 
as Derren Brown (http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk) have turned the ability 
to persuade other people to give out information into an art form! 
 
 
2. Landlords 
 
Current and past landlords are an excellent source of information about 
their tenants. They are often quite communicative. You can use a variety 
of pretexts to get the information from a landlord. You could tell the 
landlord you are considering hiring the subject and you need some 
information, or you can pose as a loan officer. With either pretext, you 
can ask about the subject's personal habits, their characteristics as a 
tenant, their reliability in paying the rent and maintaining the apartment in 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
162 
good condition. One thing to avoid with landlords is to pretend to be 
another landlord. If the landlord you are interviewing wants to get rid of 
the subject as a tenant, they will tell you that he/she is a fantastic tenant. 
Conversely, if they want to keep the tenant, they are likely to give you 
negative information so that you won't steal him away. These practices 
are so widespread that many landlords simply don't bother calling other 
landlords to verify information on new tenants. 
 
If the subject is a property owner rather than a renter, check the records 
of property transactions in which the subject has been involved. These 
records will provide names of others with whom the subject has been 
involved in property transactions. You can contact these other people 
and tell them you are planning to buy or sell property from or to the 
subject and ask about their experience with the subject. 
 
 
Neighbours 
 
Neighbours can reveal a lot personal information about your subject if you 
know exactly what you are after. They can relate how a husband and 
wife get along, if a subject smokes, drinks or uses drugs. They can tell how 
the children are treated, how the subject entertains at home, whether 
they are loud, quiet or secretive, and what kind of hours they keep. In 
other words, neighbours can report on what they hear or observe and this 
may be what you want to find out. Suppose you are preparing to phone 
the neighbours of a subject and use a pretext. What should you do? First, 
you must have the neighbour’s phone number. If you do not have the 
neighbour’s name, correct address and phone number, use your subject's 
address and then find addresses of immediate neighbours. When you 
make the call you could pretend to be an insurance sales agent. You 
may use a fictitious personal name, but do not mention an existing 
company name. You might ask questions that are about automobile 
insurance coverage, such as: 
 
• Does the subject keep his car in a garage or on the street? 
• Have you noticed any minor children driving the car? 
• Have you noticed any dents or accidents to the vehicle? 
 
As you engage the neighbour in conversation, be casual and courteous. 
Then, obtain any other personal information you must have through "chit-
chat" and small talk. If you are friendly, you won't have any trouble getting 
that additional information. Be careful to solicit only factual information, 
what the neighbour saw or heard. Personal opinions and value judgments 
are not useful, although you will get those too.

163 
4. Former Spouses 
 
Former spouses can be good sources of information, as they know the 
subject most intimately. But, they also can be very bitter and under 
emotional stress. Therefore, the information you gather from former 
spouses should be verified in other ways. To begin, you can get divorce 
records from the Courthouse and then by using a phone book or the 
Henderson Directory, get the phone number of the ex-spouse. When you 
make your call, you may pretend that you are the subject's new 
"boyfriend or girlfriend" and that you are having some problems with 
them. You may begin by discussing these problems, and see what you 
can find out. Some former spouses will be very honest and tell you about 
their ex-spouse's good, as well as bad, qualities. But, some are so bitter 
that they may tell you a string of horror stories. When this happens you 
should check other sources and compare your notes to get a true picture 
of the subject. Remember, your goal is to get good, objective information, 
not simply to "dig up dirt" or damage anyone's reputation.

investigative purposes. More and more information is being put onto the

4. Uncovering Hidden Property 
 
Unclaimed property offices currently hold several billion dollars of "lost 
property" belonging to millions of people. Some of your money could be 
sitting in an unclaimed property office, just waiting for you to claim it. You 
can find out for free whether there is unclaimed property belonging to 
you, and claim that property. There is also good money to be made in 
uncovering this ‘hidden’ property and passing it on to its rightful owners – 
for a fee. This section will explain how and give you links to the resources 
to enable you to do this. 
 
What is Unclaimed Property? 
 
Unclaimed property can include the following: 
 
• Court Deposits 
• Customer Deposits, Overpayments, Credit Balances, and Refunds 
• Deposit 
• Dormant Savings and Checking Accounts and Certificates of 
• HUD/FHA Refunds 
• Health and Accident Insurance Payments 
• Insurance Payments 
• Mineral Royalty Payments 
• Oil and Gas Royalty Payments 
• Paid Up Life Insurance Policies 
• Probate Court Judgments 
• Property Overlooked in the Probate of an Estate 
• Safe Deposit Box Contents 
• Stock Certificates 
• Uncashed Death Benefit Checks and Life Insurance Proceeds 
• Uncashed Money Orders, Cashiers Checks, and Travellers Checks 
• Uncashed Payroll Checks 
• Uncashed Stock and Mutual Fund Dividends 
• Unclaimed Security Deposits 
• United States Unclaimed Property 
• Unused Gift Certificates 
• Utility Deposits 
 
 
What Happens To Unclaimed Property? 
 
There are laws in every state of the US that govern ‘unclaimed’ property. 
Money, property and other assets is deemed to be abandoned after a 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
171 
period of inactivity of three to five years. During this abandonment period 
the banks and other companies who have responsibility for these assets 
must attempt to return the property to its owner. If this is not 
accomplished, they then turn the property over to the states abandoned-
property division or unclaimed property office. The assets are returned to 
the state of the property owners most recent known address. If no address 
is known the assets are returned to the state in which the business holding 
the funds resides. There is no time limit on claiming this property and some 
states have unclaimed property dating back to the 1800s. If the owner of 
the property is deceased then surviving relatives can claim the property. 
 
In order to find this property, all you have to do is to contact the 
unclaimed property offices in each state and get them to check their 
database to see if there is any unclaimed money waiting for you. If any is 
found, you will need to provide proof of identity, and then the property 
will be passed along to you. A list of the property offices in each state 
follows. Many of these offices have web searches available – to locate 
these, do a search on Google with the name of the state and then 
‘unclaimed property’ – e.g. ‘Alabama unclaimed property’. A good web 
search that purports to search all the databases can be found on the 
Missing Money site.

Communications  
 
 
“Good communication is as stimulating as black coffee and just as hard 
to sleep after” Anne Morrow Lindbergh, 'Gift From the Sea'. 
 
Communication is the lifeblood of the modern world. We all need to 
communicate with other people, whether they are next door, in the next 
city or on the other side of the world. These days though, it is often difficult 
to know if our communications are as private as we would want them to 
be. The information in the following pages will help you to keep your 
communications private. 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
202 
1. How to set up telephone numbers in practically every 
city in the world. 
 
Having a phone / fax number in another city can be very useful. Whether 
you are trying to hide your tracks or attempting to assert your business 
presence in another country, this is a valuable tool to have up your sleeve. 
 
There are several companies around that offer this service. We will look at 
a couple of them and explain how the service works.  
 
jConnect 
 
jConnect (formerly jFax),  is a company based in Hollywood, CA. that 
offers a variety of communication services. (http://www.j2.com/) 
 
The useful service from our perspective here is called ‘jConnect Premier’. 
At the time of writing, this service costs $15 per month. It includes the 
following features –  
 
• Local or toll free number 
 
Use 
a 
jConnect 
number 
to 
unify 
and 
manage 
your 
communications: create a virtual office, receive voicemail and 
faxes in your email, and establish a local presence in over 1000 
cities across the world (or get a US toll-free number for nationwide 
coverage).  
       
• jConnect Voice Conferencing 
 
Conference calling with all the bells and whistles you need. In a few 
simple steps, you can set up your own conference call.  
       
• Email-by-Phone 
 
Access all your communications via phone, including email, 
voicemail and fax headers. Reply to an email with a voice message 
and forward faxes to the nearest fax machine.   
       
• Send and Receive Faxes 
 
Receive faxes in your email inbox — easily forward faxes via email, 
and store faxes on your PC. Send a fax from your email, the web, or 
a Palm VII organizer — to one person or broadcast to a group.   

The Essential Underground Handbook 
203 
       
• Send and Receive Voicemail 
 
Receive voice messages via email — listen to them over your 
computer speakers, and store them in your email. Record your 
message and send it as an email attachment — to one person or 
broadcast to a group.   
 
 
There are hundreds of US cities covered by this service, and many cities 
elsewhere in the world. The worldwide locations as at the time of writing 
are listed here for your convenience (There are too many US locations to 
list here!!!)

As you can see there are plenty of locations around the world that this 
service can be used in. You can tell your customers / business associates 
that you have an office in London, Hong Kong, Milan etc. and give them 
the number to prove it! They can call the number and leave messages. 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
205 
This is certainly the lowest cost way I’ve ever found to give your 
organisation an international presence. 
 
eFax 
 
eFax offers a similar service to jConnect, except it only works with faxes 
(http://www.efax.com/). If faxes are important to your business then the 
faxing capabilities of jFax are superior to those offered by jConnect, and 
they have the same sort of presence in over 1000 countries worldwide. 
The service is slightly cheaper than jConnect too – at the time of writing it 
was $12.95 per month. It doesn’t offer phone services though, so if you 
need those you’ll need to go for jConnect. 
 
Incidentally, if it’s still there when you read this, take a look at “A Tale of 
Two Faxes” on the eFax page. This is the worst animation I’ve seen in a 
long time – I can’t find the words to describe it… (Don’t let that put you off 
the service though!)

2. How to Get Cheap Telephone and Fax Calls 
Worldwide 
 
If you regularly need to make calls or send faxes to people outside your 
country, then the costs soon start to get quite high. Thanks to the latest 
communication technology though, this needn’t be the case. The 
increasing prevalence of high speed internet lines and standardised 
compression algorithms have led to a situation where voice and fax calls 
can now be routed over the internet. In case you’re interested, heres a 
very basic overview of how it works. You make a call from your normal fax 
or telephone and the signal goes to the phone company, off to another 
specialist company who convert the signal to compressed data and route 
the call over the Internet to another country. In the other country the 
process happens in reverse – the data is uncompressed and fed into the 
normal phone lines where the person / fax machine you are 
communicating with would be completely unaware that the signal had 
travelled across the internet instead of across the standard phone 
company communication networks. Here’s a little diagram: 
 
 
 
This technology is known as Voice Over IP or VOIP. So, what’s the point of 
all this routing the call over the Internet malarkey then? Well basically it’s 
cheap. The companies that offer VOIP services to make calls to different 
countries can do so at a fraction of the cost of the telephone companies 
using their standard networks. 
 
Here 
are 
some 
sample 
rates 
for 
VOIP 
calls 
from 
a 
popular 
communications service company: 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
207 
US > China $0.089 
  
US >  Philippines $0.169 
 
US >   Australia $0.069 
 
US >   Brazil $0.149 
 
US >   Germany $0.069 
 
US >   France $0.069 
 
US >  Argentina $0.149 
 
US > Mexico $0.190 
 
Compared with standard international rates, I think you’ll agree, these are 
fantastic! 
 
So, how do you make VOIP calls? 
 
Most companies that offer VOIP services work in the same way. You sign 
up with them on the internet and then whenever you make a call you first 
dial their toll free number and then when prompted just enter the 
international number you want to dial. It’s as easy as that. Your call is 
automatically charged at the lower VOIP rate, and you can talk to 
someone on the other side of the world for as long as you like without 
worrying about the cost of the call! With most providers, you don’t need a 
special phone or any other equipment to make VOIP calls – just your 
standard phone connected to your standard phone line. Alternatively, 
you can hook specialist equipment up to your computer and in some 
cases get even cheaper calls that way. 
 
You can find VOIP providers by doing a web search on google, but here 
are the best ones we’ve used – these providers are both cheap and 
reliable.

3. How to Surf the Internet Anonymously using Proxy 
Servers 
 
Proxy Servers 
  
A proxy server is a buffer between your computer and the Internet 
resources you are accessing. Proxy servers accumulate and save files that 
are most often requested by Internet users in a special database, called a 
cache. Therefore, proxy servers are often able to increase the perceived 
speed of your connection to the Internet. The cache of a proxy server 
may already contain information you need by the time of your request, 
making it possible for the proxy to deliver it immediately. The overall 
increase in performance may be very high. Proxy servers can also help in 
cases when some owners of the Internet resources impose some 
restrictions on users from certain countries or geographical regions. In 
addition to that, some proxy servers are ‘anonymous proxy servers’. These 
hide your IP address from the sites and servers you are connecting to, 
thereby saving you from the vulnerabilities associated with giving out your 
IP address. 
 
Anonymous Proxy Servers   
  
Anonymous proxy servers hide your IP address and thereby help prevent 
unauthorized access to your computer through the Internet. They do not 
provide anyone with your IP address and effectively hide any information 
about you and your reading interests. Besides that, they don’t even let 
anyone know that you are surfing through a proxy server. Anonymous 
proxy servers can be used for all kinds of Web-services, such as Web-Mail 
(MSN Hot Mail, Yahoo mail), web-chat rooms, FTP archives, etc. 
 
There are various sources of proxies on the Internet. E.g. ProxySite.com, 
where ‘a huge list of public proxies has been compiled’.  
  
Why Should You Use Anonymous Proxy Servers?   
  
Any web resource you access can gather personal information about you 
through your unique IP address – your ID in the Internet. They can monitor 
your reading interests, spy upon you and, according to some policies of 
the Internet resources, deny you access to any information you might 
need. You might become a target for many marketers and advertising 
agencies who, having information about your interests and knowing your 
IP address as well as your e-mail, will be able to send you regularly their 
spam and junk e-mails.  

The Essential Underground Handbook 
210 
 
A web site can automatically exploit security holes in your system using 
not-very-complex, ready-made, free hacking programs. Some such 
programs may just hang your machine, making you reboot it, but other, 
more powerful ones, can get access to the content of your hard drive or 
RAM. The only thing a hacker or other malicious intruder may need in 
order to mount such an attack on your system is the IP address.  
 
  
The Solution   
  
Using an anonymous proxy server you don’t give anybody chance to find 
out your IP address to use it in their own interests. There are two main ways 
to solve your IP problem: 
 
1. Pay proxies – there are several of these available. A good one we 
would recommend is Anonymizer - a pay proxy server with plenty of 
features. Effective for personal use, when your Internet activities are not 
involved in very active surfing, web site development, mass form 
submitting, etc. In short, Anonymizer is the best solution for most of Internet 
users. Ultimate protection of privacy - nobody can find out where you are 
surfing. Blocks all methods of tracking. URL Encryption protects you from 
your own ISP. Web Based - does not require any program installation or a 
configuration on your computer. 
 
2. Using free or pay proxies manually. You can simply enter the details of 
a known proxy server into your internet browser. In Internet Explorer this is 
entered in the connections section of the Internet Explorer settings dialog 
in the following way : 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
211 
 
 
You can find proxy server lists at the following sites : 
 
Multi Proxy 
 
Proxy Mania 
 
All Proxies 
 
There are several others too – as always, do a search on google to find 
what you want! 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
212 
How to route your anonymous Internet connection through multiple 
countries 
 
Why would you want to do this? Well basically it makes it much harder for 
anyone to track down your Internet connection. By making sure your 
Internet connection runs through a chain of proxy servers in multiple 
jurisdictions, you can make it extremely difficult to track your connections 
back to your computer. 
 
How do you do it? Quite simple – we alluded to it in the sentence just 
above. Basically you need to set up a ‘proxy chain’ – this is a list of proxy 
servers that your internet connection is routed through before it gets to it’s 
destination – think postal depots and you’ll have the general idea. 
 
There are several pieces of software out there to set up and use proxy 
chains. 
 
One of the best of these is the ‘Anonymity 4 Proxy’ package available 
from inetprivacy.com - http://www.inetprivacy.com/a4proxy/review.htm. 
This has built in proxy checking and several other features to ensure your 
privacy.

Computer Security 
 
Right – lets get this out of the way – hacking is bad – it’s illegal and we 
don’t condone it. The tools and techniques described in this section of the 
book are intended to demonstrate how easy it is for even a fairly 
inexperienced person to gain access to computer systems and data that 
they shouldn’t be anywhere near… We hope this information will instil in 
the reader a healthy sense of paranoia concerning the computer systems 
they have dealings with in their day-to-day life!  Of course, an 
unscrupulous person could use the information found herein for malicious 
purposes, but that is not its published intent. 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
214 
1. Introduction 
 
We decided to lay this section out in the following way. First we are going 
to do a simple hacking walkthrough to throw you in at the (not too) deep 
end – this is something you could do yourself right now if you were so 
inclined, with any windows based computer connected to the internet 
and get instant access to other users systems and data. After that, we are 
going to discuss a couple of automated hacking tools that are available 
for free on the Internet. Finally, we’ll give you a list of computer security 
tools and resources available from various places. This is not designed to 
be a complete guide to hacking / computer security. It is meant to 
demonstrate some of the basics and give you the inspiration to find out 
more. Often the best place to find out about the latest exploits and 
system vulnerabilities is on the Internet, due to the rapidly changing nature 
of the Internet and computer systems. 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
215 
2. A Basic Hacking Walkthrough 
 
Right then lets get started. I don’t know how much experience you have 
with the windows operating system, but if you’ve used it much at all then 
you’ve probably set up a shared folder at some point. Shared folders are 
easy to set up on windows. In fact, you might say too easy to set up… To 
be fair, Microsoft have tightened up security a little on their Windows XP 
and 2003 Server products, but it is still easy for home users with XP to share 
folders if they select a couple of options and answer yes to a couple of 
warning dialog boxes without really understanding what they are getting 
themselves in for. 
 
Anyway, when you share a folder on windows, you have set up what is a 
called a NETBIOS share. Anyone out there who understands how this works 
may want to skip the next section. For those of you have don’t have much 
experience in this sort of thing though, lets look at an example. 
 
A network administrator has been asked to share some files on the 
‘Accounts’ folder on a server. He goes into windows explorer on a 
windows 2000 box, right clicks on the C drive and selects ‘Sharing’. A 
window pops up as below, showing that this folder is not shared yet (NB 
this is a Windows 2000 server machine, but other windows OS’s work in 
pretty much the same way).  
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
216 
 
 
So our hapless administrator selects the ‘Share this folder’ radio button. 
Windows helpfully fills out the data as below, suggesting a name for the 
share that is the same as the name for the folder – sounds reasonable. 
Then our administrator clicks ‘OK’. This is what a lot of people do. I’ve 
worked in IT for over 15 years and trust me people really do this.  

The Essential Underground Handbook 
217 
 
 
If our administrator had taken the time to click on the permissions button 
then he would have got the window below, which shows him that 
‘Everyone’ has permissions to access this share, and moreover, ‘Everyone’ 
has ‘Full Control’ over the share. 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
218 
 
 
Hmm. Nice one Microsoft… 
 
So now, our administrator sends an email to everyone in Accounts telling 
them that they can access the shared folder ‘Accounts’ by navigating to 
the server in windows explorer, mapping the drive, or by typing the 
following link in their windows explorer address bar: 
 
\\server1\Accounts\ 
 
What our administrator probably doesn’t realise is that if he replaces the 
name of the server with the IP address of the server then that still works (in 
case you don’t know, an IP address is a number that identifies a computer 
on a network) 
 
So for example if the IP address of server1 was 192.168.0.1 then everyone 
on the network could access this folder by typing the following into the 
windows explorer address bar: 
 
\\192.168.0.1\Accounts\

Fine. So this isn’t really a problem – only people on the local network can 
access this folder. Well that’s true, unless the network is connected to the 
Internet. Then things can get a whole lot more interesting. On most 
corporate networks, firewalls are in place to stop NETBIOS shares being 
accessible from the Internet. For many small business networks and home 
users though, this isn’t the case. Many of these types of users have shared 
folders on their computers that are directly accessible from the Internet. 
All a hacker needs to do is to find these open shares and then err... No, 
actually, there is nothing else. That’s all he needs to do!  
 
Right then, lets think about this from a hackers perspective. How are we 
going to find open NETBIOS shares on the Internet? First, we need an IP 
range that we can scan through.  Finding an IP range is pretty easy. These 
are often detailed on ISP sites or perhaps we can scan a range around 
any IP address that we know exists (the IP address of someone’s ADSL line 
etc.). If we are really desperate and can’t find an IP range to use, we 
could use our own external IP if we are on broadband as a starting point, 
but this is pretty desperate. (If we didn’t know our external IP address, we 
could point our browser at something like this:  
 
http://www.urgentclick.com/whats_my_ip_address.php 
 
Which will tell us our IP address - there are loads of these on the Internet – 
type ‘what’s my IP’ into google 
 
Right then. Now we have a starting address – say for example it’s 
100.100.23.23 
 
Lets start at the next address block – 100.100.24.1 
 
We could now go into windows explorer and type the following into the 
address bar in windows explorer: 
 
\\100.100.24.1\ 
 
And hit enter and wait for a bit… 
 
If we get a timeout error, then we know there is nothing at this address 
and we can carry on – if we are lucky we’ll get something like this (going 
back to our earlier example)

This method would work, but it would also take ages. There must be an 
easier way… Well, it just happens that there is. There are several tools out 
there to automate NETBIOS scans across IP ranges. We are going to look 
at a popular shareware package called Legion. Legion can be 
downloaded from various places on the net (do a search on ‘legion 
NetBIOS’ in google). 
 
Once we’ve downloaded and installed the program, we can start it up 
and we get an interface like this –  
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
221 
 
 
Basically we just need to set our connection speed, enter a start IP and an 
end IP and hit the start button – Legion will scan the IP range for us and 
report back any open NETBIOS shares. There is also an option with this tool 
to try to get into any password protected shares – we won’t go into that 
here – it is very time consuming and typically we don’t need to do it as 
there are enough open shares out there to keep us occupied. We don’t 
want to make the IP range too big here otherwise it will take ages to scan. 
We would probably scan the same IP range a few times on different days 
and at different times of the day – a lot of people don’t leave their 
machines on all the time, and we won’t pick anything up if the machine is 
turned off. 
 
When this completes, and as long as we have picked a decent IP range, 
we will get a list of shares that we can open. The easiest way to open 
these shares is to copy the share path from the Legion window and paste 
it into the windows explorer address bar. Then we can open the share, 
browse the files and copy them at will to our own machine for whatever 
purpose we wish. If we have access to the C: drive then we can put files 
into the start-up path to run our own programs on the users computer 
when they next start it up.

There – we could now have access to a number of remote computers on 
the Internet. So what are we going to do now we have this access? 
Typically hackers use ‘compromised’ machines in a number of ways –  
 
• To perform denial of service attacks on the remote computer – 
making the computer unusable 
• To steal files and data from the remote computer – typical targets 
on windows machines are outlook / outlook express data files, Word 
documents, Excel files etc. Basically anything that could have useful 
or lucrative information in. 
• To send spam emails from the remote computer 
• To use the computer as a base for hacking other, possibly more 
lucrative, targets 
 
Right that’s it for our simple walkthrough. I hope that proved how easy it 
could be to gain access to other people’s computers – or your computer 
if you’re not careful!

3. Automated Hacking Tools 
 
In this section we are going to describe two general-purpose hacking 
tools that are in fairly widespread use amongst the hacking community. 
These tools are BackOrifice 2000 and SubSeven. 
 
 
BackOrifice 2000 
 
This is probably still the most well known hacking tool available for 
windows, although it is now getting slightly long in the tooth. It is billed as a 
remote windows administration tool, and allows a hacker to gain a high 
level of control over a system, including the ability to reboot the system, 
modify the registry, view passwords, start programs, transfer files and much 
more besides. You can download the program files for this tool from the 
Internet – see the tools and resource section later, or try typing ‘Back 
Orifice 2000’ into google. 
 
Once you have downloaded and installed BackOrifice 2000 (BO2K), there 
are a few steps you need to go through to get the software working. (This 
assumes you have version 1.0 of BO2K that has a configuration wizard – if 
not, the steps are very similar without the wizard) 
 
Configure the Server 
 
In this context, ‘Server’ means the program that goes on the target 
machine 
You need to customise this program. First, make a copy of the bo2k.exe 
file that is installed in the program directory – call it anything you want as 
long as it has an exe extension. Then run the BO2K Configuration Tool from 
the start menu. This starts the BO2K configuration wizard. Click next and 
choose the file you copied. 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
224 
 
Click next, make sure TCPIO networking is selected, type in any port 
number above 1024 and below 65535 
 
Click next; choose 3DES unless you have the non-US version in which case 
you can only choose XOR, and then click next again. Enter a password, 
and then finish the wizard. This will write the program file to disk in the 
same folder you picked it up from. 
If you want to make any more specific changes then you can load the 
program into the Configuration Tool and make these changes now – 
otherwise, you can exit the configuration tool. 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
225 
Install the Server 
 
The server needs to run on the target machine. If you were really hacking, 
you would have to put it there surreptitiously (over a NETBIOS share into a 
start-up folder, or some other way…). For now, just to test (You’re not really 
hacking are you? That would be illegal!!!), you can just copy the machine 
to the server (or leave it on this machine), and run it. 
 
 
Start Up The Client  
 
Now start the client program by running ‘BO2K Client’ from the start menu. 
It should open, and maximize itself. Now you need to create a new server 
connection. Click on the computer icon on the left hand side of the server 
list window at the bottom.  
Enter a name for he server (doesn't matter what it is). Type in the IP 
address and port of the server in the following format – 127.0.0.1:6666 
(replacing the IP (127.0.0.1) with the actual IP of the machine you are 
connecting to and the port (6666) with the port you entered earlier. Leave 
the other settings to their defaults and hit OK. 
One you've hit OK, the server command client pops up for this server. You 
can minimize and restore the server command client by double-clicking 
the server name in the server list box at the bottom.  
 
Connect To The Server 
 
Hit the 'Connect' button on the Server Command Client. It should display 
the version number of the server it has connected to in the output window 
at the bottom of the command client. Once connected, select 
commands out of the 'Server Commands' tree control. When you choose 
a command, the parameters for the command will appear in the right of 
the box. Some parameters are optional, as indicated by either brackets [], 
or opt). All other parameters must be entered.

226 
 
Right then, so now you’ve got pretty much complete control over this 
machine… Not too difficult is it? Right, next. 
 
 
SubSeven 
 
Next we are going to look at a similar program called SubSeven. This is 
more widely used than Back Orifice, presumably as it is more stable and 
offers greater functionality. You can find this program easily enough on 
the internet – see the Tools and Resources section later, or search on 
google for ‘SubSeven’. 
 
Once the zip file for this program is downloaded, you can extract the files, 
and you should get the following files –  
 
editserver.exe 
ICQMAPI.dll 
server.exe 
SubSeven.exe 
tutorial.txt 
 

The Essential Underground Handbook 
227 
I’m not going to go into detail on this one – you can read the tutorial, 
which gives you all the information you need. In terms of the overall 
system architecture it works in a broadly similar way to Back Orifice, with a 
server configuration tool, server that runs on the target machine and a 
client that runs on your machine. At first the interface will feel a bit weird 
as it is not built to a standard windows style, but don’t let that put you off – 
it has loads of features and is well worth having a look at.
