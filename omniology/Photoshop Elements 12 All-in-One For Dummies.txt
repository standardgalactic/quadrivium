Introduction
W

e live in a photo world. And Photoshop Elements has become a tool 
for both professional and amateur photographers who want to 
edit, improve, manage, manipulate, and organize photos and other media. 
Considering the power and impressive features of the program, Elements 
remains one of the best values for your money among computer software 
applications.
This book is an effort to provide as much of a comprehensive view of a 
wildly feature-rich program as we can. Additionally, this book is written for 
a cross-platform audience. If you’re a Macintosh user, you’ll find all you 
need to work in Elements 12, including support for placing photos on maps 
and more consistency with Windows features.
Elements is overflowing with features, and we try to offer you as much as 
possible within a limited amount of space. We begged for more pages, but 
alas, our publisher wants to get this book in your hands in full color and 
with an attractive price tag. Therefore, even though we may skip over a few 
little things, all you need to know about using Photoshop Elements for 
designing images for print, sharing, the web, versatile packaging, e-mailing, 
and more is covered in the pages ahead. 
Because Photoshop Elements has something for just about everyone, we 
know that our audience is large and also that not everyone will use every 
tool, command, or method we describe. We offer many cross-references 
throughout to help you jump around. You can go to just about any chapter 
and start reading. If a concept needs more explanation, we point you in the 
right direction for getting some background.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, especially in step lists, we point you to menus for 
keyboard commands. For accessing a menu command, you may see some­
thing like this:
Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
You click the File menu to open its drop-down menu, click the menu com­
mand labeled Get Photos, and then choose the command From Files and 
Folders from the submenu that appears. It’s that simple.

2
Icons Used in This Book
We also refer to context menus, which open where your cursor is positioned 
and show you a menu of options related to whatever you’re doing at the 
time. These menus look like the ones you select from the top of the Elements 
workspace. To open a context menu, just right-click the mouse, or Control-
click on a Mac if you don’t have a two-button mouse.
When we mention that keys need to be pressed on your keyboard, the text 
looks like this:
Press Alt+Shift+Ctrl+S (Option+Shift+⌘+S on the Macintosh).
In this case, you hold down the Alt key on Windows/the Option key on the 
Mac, then the Shift key, then the Control key on Windows/the ⌘ key on the 
Mac, and then press the S key. Then, release all the keys at the same time.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins throughout this book, you see icons indicating that some­
thing is important.
	
This icon informs you that this item is a new feature in Photoshop 
Elements 12.
	
Pay particular attention when you see the Warning icon. This icon indicates 
possible side-effects or damage to your image that you might encounter 
when performing certain operations in Elements.
	
This icon is a heads-up for something you may want to commit to memory. 
Usually, it tells you about a shortcut for a repetitive task, where remember­
ing a procedure can save you time.
	
A Tip tells you about an alternative method for a procedure, giving you a 
shortcut, a workaround, or some other type of helpful information.
	
Elements is a computer program, after all. No matter how hard we try to 
simplify our explanation of features, we can’t entirely avoid some technical 
information. If a topic is a little on the technical side, we use this icon to 
alert you that we’re moving into a complex subject. You won’t see many of 
these icons in the book because we try our best to give you the details in 
nontechnical terms.

Beyond the Book
We have online content that you can enjoy in conjunction with this book:
	
✓	Cheat sheet: The cheat sheet for this book includes a detailed look at 
the Elements photo editing workspace, Tools panel shortcuts, tricks for 
selecting objects, and more.
www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/photoshopelements12
	
✓	Online articles: We couldn’t fit everything we wanted into this book, so 
you can find additional content here:
www.dummies.com/extras/photoshopelements12
	
	A few of the topics covered are organizing and importing photos, 
dynamically updating saved searches, finding and loading actions, and 
adjusting brightness/contrast with the Smart Brush tool. But there’s 
much more than these few topics. Be sure to check these out.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re totally new to Photoshop Elements, Book I helps orient you to the 
different workspaces (one for organizing and another for editing) and tools 
within those workspaces. After you have a feel for navigating among the dif­
ferent workspaces in Elements, feel free to jump around based on your inter­
ests and pay special attention to the cross-referenced chapters, in case you 
get stuck on a concept.
We hope you have much success and enjoyment in using Adobe Photoshop 
Elements 12, and it’s our sincere wish that the pages ahead provide you with 
an informative and helpful guide to the program.

Chapter 1: Examining the 
Elements Environment
In This Chapter
✓	Working with the Organizer
✓	Setting up your workspaces
✓	Moving through the Menu bar and context menus
✓	Picking settings in the Options panel
✓	Playing around with panels and bins
✓	Shortening your steps with shortcuts
✓	Getting a helping hand
P

hotoshop Elements 12 continues to evolve with new tools and features. 
Both Windows and Macintosh users also have continued support for 
the Organizer and its file management, creation, and file-sharing 
opportunities.
This chapter starts with some essential tasks to make your 
photo management and editing experiences an easy pro­
cess. This chapter’s content may not be the most fun 
part of this book, but it’s a critical first step for any­
one new to Elements. Stay with us while we break 
down all the areas in the Photoshop Elements work­
space, where you can turn that photo of Aunt Gina 
into something that Whistler’s mom would envy.
Launching Elements
After running the installer from the Photoshop 
Elements DVD-ROM or downloading the program from 
the Adobe Store (or Apple App Store for Mac users), double-
click the program icon to launch Elements. When the program 
launches, you see the Adobe Photoshop Elements Welcome screen, as 
shown in Figure 1-1.

8
Launching Elements
Figure 1-1: The Photoshop Elements Welcome screen for Windows.
On the Welcome screen, you find two buttons for opening the Organizer and 
the Photo Editor. Click one of these buttons, and you open the respective 
Elements application:
	
✓	Organizer: Click the Organizer button, and Elements opens the Organizer, 
the window where you take care of a plethora of file-management and 
organization tasks. Among your other options, you can choose to load pic­
tures in the Organizer window so that they’re ready to use for all your 
projects. The Organizer is available to Macintosh users in Photoshop 
Elements 9 and above as well as to Windows users.
	
✓	Photo Editor: Click the Photo Editor button to open the Photoshop 
Elements Photo Editor, where you perform all the editing for your photos.
	
✓	Settings: Click Settings (the sprocket icon) to open the Adobe Photoshop 
Elements 12 preferences for the startup window. Here, you can choose to 
show the window on startup, open only the Organizer, or open only the 
Photo Editor. By default, the Welcome screen is set to always open when 
Elements is launched.
	
✓	Close: Click the X on the Welcome screen to close it. Closing the 
Welcome screen has no effect on the Editors or the Organizer. If either 
or all are open, they remain open when you close the Welcome screen.
Every time you launch Photoshop Elements, the Welcome screen is the first 
item you see on your monitor. From the Welcome screen, you choose the 
kind of tasks you want to accomplish in a session. If you want to change 
from one window to another, for example, or change from the Organizer to 
the Photo Editor, you can easily navigate workspaces after you open one 
editing environment, as we explain in the section “Navigating the Different 
Modes,” later in this chapter.

Chapter 1
Examining the 
Elements 
Environment
Opening the Organizer
	
The window you see in Figure 1-1, along with any of the help information dis­
played there, may be slightly different from what you see on your monitor 
when you launch Elements. The Welcome screen displays dynamic content, 
and Adobe changes the content routinely.
Opening the Organizer
The Organizer is one of several workspaces available to you with Photoshop 
Elements. Unless you have an immediate task at hand for editing a photo in 
the Photo Editor workspace, the Organizer is often going to be your first 
workspace to visit. In the Organizer, you can manage photos and navigate to 
every other editing workspace that Elements provides you.
	
If you use Photoshop Elements 9 or above on a Macintosh, you have the 
Photoshop Elements Organizer available to you with many features that had 
previously been available only on Windows. Many screenshots showing the 
Organizer in this book equally apply to both Windows and Macintosh users.
To open the Organizer, click the Organize button on the Welcome screen. 
When you install Elements and first open the Organizer, you see an empty 
screen, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Getting familiar with your hardware
Wait! Stop! Hold on! Before you launch Ele­
ments, be advised that there are certain mini­
mum hardware requirements necessary to 
run the programs. The minimum requirements 
recommended by Adobe include the following:
	✓	Common requirements for all systems: 
1GB of RAM (2GB for HD video functions), 
4GB of available hard-disk space (addi­
tional space is needed for installation), 
DVD drive, and an Internet connection for 
product activation.
	✓	Windows requirements: Microsoft Win­
dows XP with Service Pack 3, Windows 
Vista with Service Pack 2, Windows 7, or 
Windows 8. Note that Windows XP offers 
only limited functionality for Camera Raw 
files. See Book III, Chapter 4, for an intro­
duction to Camera Raw.
	
	 You also need the following on a Windows 
computer: 1.6 GHz or faster processor (in­
cluding single core support), color moni­
tor with 16-bit color video card, 1024 x 768 
monitor resolution, and Microsoft Direc­
tX 9 compatible display driver.
	✓	Macintosh requirements: 64-bit Multi-core 
Intel processor, Mac OS X v10.7, 1024 x 768 
display resolution, QuickTime 7 software 
required for multimedia features.
Note that the preceding specifications are 
what Adobe recommends for problem-free op­
eration. You may be able to run Elements with 
older operating systems and less hardware 
power, but Adobe does not recommend it.

10
Opening the Organizer
Figure 1-2: Upon your first launch of the Organizer, you see an empty workspace.
You can add photos to the Organizer window by using a variety of options 
that we cover in Book II, Chapter 1. For now, we focus on looking at the 
Organizer tools and understanding how they work. Some of the more impor­
tant tools in the Organizer include
	
A.	Elements Organizer button: On a Windows machine, clicking this but­
ton opens a menu where you can choose to close, minimize, and maxi­
mize the Organizer workspace. The icon represents the Organizer. In 
other workspaces, such as the Photo Editor, clicking the icon returns 
you to the Organizer window. On the Mac, no such icon exists.
	
B.	Menu bar: The menus contain all the commands you use in the Organizer 
workspace. On the Macintosh, the menu bar is positioned above the 
Organizer workspace and a menu item titled Elements Organizer appears 

11
Book I 
Chapter 1
Examining the 
Elements 
Environment
Opening the Organizer
in the menu bar. Throughout this book, we talk about using menu 
commands.
	
C.	Media: In Elements 12, you find four tabs at the top of the Organizer win­
dow above the Media Browser (see CC). When you click Media, thumb­
nail images of your media appear in the Media Browser.
	
D.	People: Click this tab, and all images with people tags are shown in the 
Media Browser.
	
E.	Places: Click the Places tab, and you see images in the Media Browser 
that have been tagged as locations. When you click this tab and click the 
Tags/Info button (item GG), the Map button appears at the bottom of the 
Panel Bin (item S). Click the Map button, and a Google map is displayed 
in the Panel Bin.
	
F.	Events: The fourth tab above the Media Browser is the Events tab. Click 
this tab, and all images tagged as events appear in the Media Browser. 
You additionally see a calendar in the Panel Bin for sorting events 
according to dates.
	
G.	Search: Type text in the text box to search for photos in the Organizer 
window. After typing text in the text box, click the magnifying glass icon 
to perform the search.
	
H-J.	Features buttons: The three buttons represented by tiny icons include, 
from left to right, (H) Minimize, (I) Restore, and (J) Close (on the top 
right in Windows and on the top left on a Mac where they are Close, 
Minimize, and Zoom, from left to right). These buttons work the same as 
they do in almost all Windows or Mac applications.
	
K.	Import panel: The Import panel displays Albums (item L) and folder 
locations (item O). In Figure 1-2, media has not yet been imported into 
the Organizer. Therefore, no folders appear in the Import panel.
	
L.	Albums: At the top of the Import panel, you see Albums. A list of albums 
appears as you create them. You can add new albums by clicking the + 
(plus) icon and choosing New Album from the drop-down menu.
	
M.	Create/Share buttons: Click a button to open a drop-down menu for the 
respective panel in the Panel Bin (item S). The panels include
	
•	 Create: Click the Create tab to make creations you can print or share 
online.
	
•	 Share: Options in this panel provide you with many different oppor­
tunities to share photos and creations.
	
N.	Mobile Albums: Click the Learn More icon to find out more about using 
Mobile Albums.
	
O.	My Folders: As you add media, the media are added as folders. You can 
create folders on a hard drive and add a folder name and the media con­
tained within the folder.

12
Opening the Organizer
	
P.	Sort By: A drop-down menu permits you to choose how images are 
sorted in the Media Browser: Newest files first, Oldest files first, or by 
Import batch.
	
	
In Elements 12, another sort option was added to this menu. You find 
Name as a choice that permits you to sort files according to filename.
	
Q.	All Media: After you add images to the Organizer, text here indicates 
that all media is shown in the Media Browser. If you click a folder, only 
the media in the folder is shown in the Media Browser. The text then 
appears as a button to the left of the Sort By drop-down menu. Click the 
All Media button, and you return to the view showing all the media in 
the Media Browser.
	
R.	Ratings: Click a star to rate an image with 1 to 5 stars.
	
S.	Panel Bin: The default Panel Bin displays keyword tags, information, 
and image tags. Additional panels are opened in the Panel Bin by click­
ing the Create and Share button at the top of the panel and by clicking 
icons appearing at the bottom of the panel.
	
T.	Hide Panel: Click this button, and the Import panel disappears, provid­
ing you more space in the Media Browser to look for photos. When hid­
den, the button changes to Show Panel. Click the Show Panel button, 
and the Import panel reappears.
	
U.	N Item: The number of items in the catalog appears as a readout here. 
In Figure 1-2, no media is loaded in the Organizer, hence the readout is 
0 Item.
	
V.	Undo/Redo: You use these tools to undo and redo edits.
	
W.	Rotate: Click the Rotate tool to display the Clockwise and 
Counterclockwise tools. Select a photo in the Media Browser and click 
one of the tools, and you can rotate the image. When you rotate an 
image, you don’t need to save anything. The Organizer remembers 
rotated images, and they continue to appear as you perform a rotation 
in all subsequent Organizer sessions.
	
X.	Add People: Select one or more photos and click this button to tag 
photos for people recognition.
	
Y.	Add Places: Select one or more photos and click this button to display a 
map where you can tag photos with geospatial locations.
	
Z.	Add Event: Click this button, and the Add Event panel opens in the 
Panel Bin. The Add Event panel permits you to add new event tags to 
photos with dates and descriptions.
	
AA.	Slide Show: Click this button and a Full Screen view window opens, 
where you can view all files in the Media Browser as a slide show.
	
BB.	Editor: Click the button, and the Elements Photo Editor opens. If you have 
photos selected in the Media Browser, the photos open in the Photo 
Editor. Click the down arrow adjacent to the icon, and a menu provides 

13
Book I 
Chapter 1

choices for editing with an External Editor, Edit with Photoshop (if 
installed), edit with the Elements Photo Editor, and Edit with Premiere 
Elements (if installed). If you choose External Editor and you haven’t iden­
tified an editor in the Editing preferences, Elements opens the Preferences 
dialog box, where you identify the external editor you want to use.
	
CC.	Media Browser: The main window in the Organizer is called the Media 
Browser. Here is where you find thumbnail images of photos added to 
your catalog and thumbnail icons representing PDF files, music files, and 
video files.
	
	
Commit the term Media Browser to memory. This area is where thumb­
nail images are shown in the Organizer, and we make reference to the 
Media Browser throughout this book.
	
DD.	Adjust Size of Thumbnail: Move the slider to change the size of thumb­
nail images appearing in the Media Browser. (See item CC for more on 
the Media Browser.)
	
EE.	Instant Fix: Click this button, and the Quick editing tools open in the 
Panel Bin. You can make many adjustments to your photos without leav­
ing the Organizer.
	
FF.	Catalog Name: The name of the open catalog appears here. Click the 
text, and you open the Catalog Manager. A catalog contains thumbnail 
images of all the photos you add from your hard drive or media disk.
	
GG.	Tags/Info: Click this button, and the default panels display keyword 
tags, information, and image keywords.
	
For maximum viewing of photos in the Media Browser, click the Hide Panel 
button and the Keyword/Info button. Both panels collapse from view, and 
the Media Browser occupies the entire Organizer window horizontally.
Adding Images to the Organizer
To manage photos and apply edits, you need to load some photos into the 
default catalog that appears (empty, obviously) when you first launch Elements.
	
If you used earlier versions of Elements, the Organizer prompts you to con­
vert an earlier catalog to the new version when you first launch the program. 
If you want to convert an earlier catalog, follow the onscreen directions, and 
your photos are loaded in the Media Browser.
To add photos to the default catalog, do the following:
	
1.	 Copy some photos to your hard drive.
	
	 On the Macintosh, you’re prompted immediately when you launch the 
Organizer the first time to add photos from your iPhoto library. If you 
have photos stored in iPhoto, click the Import button to add photos to a 
new catalog.

A number of file-management options are available in the Organizer for sort­
ing images, tagging files with keywords, and creating albums of photos. We 
cover all you can do with file management in Book II, Chapters 2 and 3.
Navigating the Different Modes
Elements provides you with three editing modes. If you’re in the Organizer, 
you access the different editing modes in the Photo Editor. Click the Photo 
Editor button at the bottom of the Organizer window or click Photo Editor 
on the Welcome screen when you launch Elements from your desktop. The 
editing modes are as follows:
	
✓	Expert: In Expert mode, you have access to all tools and commands, 
which provide you with limitless opportunities for editing your pictures.

17
Book I 
Chapter 1
Examining the 
Elements 
Environment
Navigating the Different Modes
	
✓	Quick: Use this mode when you need to polish an image in terms of 
brightness, contrast, or color adjustment or other, similar editing tasks. 
You can perform quick edits in the Photo Editor or within the Organizer 
by clicking the Instant Fix tool.
	
✓	Guided: This marvelous tool gives you step-by-step instructions to 
­produce an editing result, such as removing a color cast or perfecting 
a portrait image. Three new Guided photo edits have been added in 
Elements 12 — Old Fashioned Photo, Puzzle, and Zoom Burst. 
After you have files loaded in the Organizer, you can easily open an image in 
an editing mode.
	
You can move around in the Photo Editor to explore panels and different 
modes. When you change from Expert mode to another mode or explore 
options in the Panel Bin, you lose the Tools panel on the far left of the Photo 
Editor screen. When you want to regain access to the Tools panel, click 
Expert at the top of the Photo Editor window.
Visiting Expert editing mode
Don’t let the term Expert dissuade you from exploring options in this mode. 
It’s not really a mode used only by experts. Rather, the Expert moniker sim­
ply distinguishes it from the other modes, because the Expert mode is where 
you apply limitless edits to your photos.
Assuming that you want to edit a picture, follow these steps to launch the 
Photo Editor workspace from the Organizer:
	
1.	 Click an image thumbnail in the Organizer.
	
	 Following this step presumes that you’ve added photos to the Organizer, 
as we describe in the section “Adding Images to the Organizer,” earlier 
in this chapter.
	
2.	 Click Editor at the bottom of the Organizer window.
	
	 After you select the mode, the selected image appears in the Photo 
Editor’s Expert mode workspace, as shown in Figure 1-6. Notice the tabs 
at the top of the window for changing the modes.
	
3.	 To return to the Organizer, click the Organizer button at the bottom of 
the Editor window, as shown in Figure 1-6.
When you open a file from the Organizer or change to another workspace 
while the Organizer is open, you have two workspaces open in Elements. 
The second workspace (such as the Photo Editor) opens while the Organizer 
remains open. When you toggle between modes, both modes remain open 
until you exit one mode or the other.

18
Navigating the Different Modes
Figure 1-6: To return to the Organizer from the Photo Editor workspace, click the Organizer 
button.
Visiting Quick editing mode
If you’ve worked in earlier versions of Elements, you may expect the 
Organizer to provide a direct link to each editing mode in the Photo Editor: 
Expert (formerly Full Photo Edit mode), Quick (formerly Quick Fix), and 
Guided.
In Elements 12, you have just one place to switch to from the Organizer — 
the Photo Editor. You get to the Photo Editor by clicking the Editor button at 
the bottom of the Organizer window. In the Photo Editor, Elements shows 
you the last mode you chose (Expert, Quick, or Guided). To switch to a dif­
ferent editing mode, click the tab at the top of the window. So, for Quick edit­
ing mode, you click the Quick tab.
	
If you’re in the Organizer, you don’t have to switch to the Photo Editor to 
make quick fixes to your images. Click Instant Fix at the bottom of the Panel 
Bin, and Photo Fix Options are displayed for making quick edits while you 
remain in the Organizer.

Navigating the Different Modes
If you arrive at the Photo Editor via the Welcome screen, you see the same 
tabs for each mode at the top of the Photo Editor. To enter Quick mode, 
click the Quick tab and Quick mode appears, as shown in Figure 1-7.
	
Notice in Figure 1-7 that you find the Move tool in the Tools panel. Earlier ver­
sions of Elements didn’t have the Move tool in this mode. Now in Elements 12, 
the Move tool has been added to the Tools panel.
Getting help with Guided mode
Although the Guided panel isn’t entirely a separate mode, it changes the 
appearance of the Panel Bin to offer you help with many editing tasks. In the 
Photo Editor, click Guided at the top of the Photo window. The Guided panel 
opens in the Panel Bin. You have a number of choices for editing tasks. In 
our example, we chose a very simple edit process to straighten a photo, as 
shown in Figure 1-8.
One common item that appears with many different editing tasks is a mini-
toolbar. Whenever you see a toolbar, remember to click the check mark to 
accept your edits. Or, if needed, click the icon with a circle and diagonal line 
to dismiss the edits and return to the image’s previous state.
Quick switching between interfaces
Your operating system has a built-in Application 
Switcher. In Windows, press the Alt key and 
then the Tab key. Keep the Alt key depressed, 
release the Tab key, and click the application 
you want to use. On the Macintosh, press the 
⌘ key and then the Tab key. Keep the ⌘ key 
depressed, release the Tab key, and click the 
application you want to use. You can also use 
the left and right arrows to move between ap­
plications in the Application Switcher. The fol­
lowing figure shows the Application Switcher 
in Windows (left) and on the Macintosh (right).
When you’re using the Organizer and want to 
quickly open the Photo Editor or you’re using 
the Photo Editor and want to switch to the Or­
ganizer, use the Application Switcher. If you 
need to open the Desktop view, use the Appli­
cation Switcher to quickly change to the Desk­
top view. All the applications remain open, 
and you can toggle back and forth between 
programs.

In Photoshop Elements 12, three new Guided editing tasks have been added: 
	
✓	Restore Old Photo provides step-by-step instructions for editing old 
photos. 
	
✓	Puzzle enables you to turn any photo into a puzzle. 
	
✓	Zoom Burst is a marvelous new addition that will capture your enthusi­
asm for adding effects similar to what you see in Figure 1-9.
Figure 1-9: The new Elements 12 Zoom Burst effect.
Click other items in the Guided panel and find helpful steps to guide you 
through a number of common image-editing tasks.
Moving through the Menu Bar
As with most programs on your computer, Elements offers you a number of 
drop-down menus with many different commands that invoke actions. 
Don’t bother to memorize all the menu commands. Instead, try to develop 
an understanding of the types of actions included in a given menu. A gen­
eral understanding of the menus helps you find commands much faster.
Take a look at the menus in the Organizer. Among the Organizer menus, 
you find
	
✓	File: On the File menu, as you might expect, you find commands to open 
and browse files on your hard drive. You also find a number of options 
for saving files, such as writing images to CD-ROMs and DVDs 
(Windows). Commands for managing catalogs, moving files, and printing 
images are also located in this menu.
	
✓	Edit: Many commands you’re familiar with — copy, undo, delete, and so 
on — are located on the Edit menu. In the Organizer, you also find many 

22
Moving through the Menu Bar
options for sorting files and options for managing color. In addition, you 
find a number of quick-access commands for editing photos similar to 
options you find in Quick mode.
	
✓	Find: The Find menu is all about finding images on your computer. You 
have many choices for searching photos based on a wide range of criteria.
	
✓	View: The View menu handles commands related to viewing images in 
the Organizer window. You can choose the types of media to display in 
the Organizer, show and hide files, and show and hide certain data asso­
ciated with files such as the filenames. Choices you make in this menu 
relate to the display of images in the Organizer’s Media Browser.
	
✓	Help: As you might expect, the Help menu contains menu commands 
that provide help when working in Elements. Certain Help commands 
open your default web browser and open Help web pages on the Adobe 
website.
Keep in mind that the Organizer is distinct from the editing modes. The com­
mands you find in the editing modes are, for the most part, quite different 
from the menu items found in the Organizer. The Photo Editor contains the 
following menus:
	
✓	File: You find file-opening and -saving options as well as printing com­
mands on the File menu. The File menu also contains some options for 
combining images and batch-processing files.
	
✓	Edit: The Edit menu offers a number of editing tasks, such as copying 
and pasting, merging copies, pasting into selections, setting up files, and 
using patterns and brushes. You also find color-management options 
that are identical to the commands on the Organizer Edit menu.
	
✓	Image: The Image menu contains commands used for changing images, 
such as cropping and resizing photos, changing color modes, converting 
color profiles, and transforming images or selections. Notice that you 
find no image corrections for brightness and color adjustments. These 
commands are on the Enhance menu.
	
✓	Enhance: The Enhance menu is all about working with images in terms 
of color and brightness corrections and altering their visual appearance.
	
✓	Layer: The Layer menu lets you work with layers and gives you access 
to the many tasks you can do with layers.
	
✓	Select: You use the Select menu to create, modify, and use selections. 
One of the most frequent phases of an edit is creating a selection, and 
the Select menu provides a number of commands and tools to help you 
perfect your selection of image content.
	
✓	Filter: For artistic edits, take a look at the Filter menu and explore the 
many filter effects you can add to your pictures. You don’t need to be a 
Photoshop Elements expert. The program makes it easy for you by

keeping all filters in one place so that with a click of the mouse button, 
you can create some dazzling effects.
	
✓	View: Viewing options in the Photo Editor relate to zooming in and out 
of photos, showing rulers and guides, and creating new windows.
	
✓	Window: The Window menu displays a list of panels that can be opened 
and closed. You also find a list of all open files, to a maximum number of 
windows you determine in the Elements preferences.
	
✓	Help: The Help menu connects you to an online Help document describ­
ing most of what you can do in Elements, tutorials, a Photoshop Elements 
forum, program updates, and the Inspiration Browser that’s a Flash-based 
tutorial guide offering tips and techniques.
Using Context Menus
Context menus are found in just about every Adobe program. One of the 
helpful things about context menus is that if you want to perform an action 
using a menu command or tool, chances are good that you may find just 
what you’re looking for on a context menu.
You open a context menu by right-clicking the 
mouse button (Windows or Mac) or Control-
clicking (Mac). Depending on the tool you’re 
using and the mode you’re working in, the menu 
commands change. For example, in Figure 1-10, 
we opened a context menu on a thumbnail image 
in the Organizer. As you can see in the figure, sev­
eral of the menu commands that are available are 
similar to the menu commands you find in the 
top-level menu commands.
	
If you’re a Mac user with a two-button mouse, 
you can right-click to open a context menu. And, 
if you’re a Mac user employing a trackpad, you 
can click with two fingers to open a context 
menu.
In Figure 1-11, we opened an image in the Photo 
Editor and created a selection. If you right-click 
the mouse button, the context menu changes to 
reflect edits you can make relative to a selection.
	
When you change tools and editing modes, the 
context menu choices change to reflect what 
you can do with the selected tool and in your 
current editing mode.
Figure 1-10: Context menus 
provide quick access to menu 
commands.

24
Selecting Settings in the Options Panel
Figure 1-11: We created a selection in the Photo Editor mode and opened 
a context menu.
Selecting Settings in the Options Panel
A number of tools and options exist in several places in each mode. One area 
you frequently visit when you edit pictures is the Options panel. The Tool 
Options panel provides several choices for every tool you select in the Photo 
Editor. In Figure 1-12, we opened the Photo Editor and clicked the Lasso tool. 
The Tool Options panel changes to reflect the choices you have when work­
ing with this tool.
As you click different tools in the Tools panel, the Tool Options panel 
changes to offer the choices for working with the selected tool.
	
If you used Photoshop Elements prior to version 11, pay particular attention 
to the Tool Options panel at the bottom of the Photo Editor window. Earlier 
versions of Elements had pop-out toolbars in the Tools panel where you 
could select different tools from a tool group. In Elements 11 and 12, the 
Tools panel does not have any pop-out toolbars. You make all tool choices 
first in the Tools panel and can then choose related tools from the tool 
group in the Tools Options panel. Notice that in Figure 1-12, the Magnetic 
Lasso and Polygon Lasso tools appear adjacent and below the Lasso tool in 
the Tool Options panel.

Playing with Panels
The Panel Bin contains many choices for editing 
files, assembling projects, and working with dif­
ferent tools. Each workspace and mode you visit 
(Organizer or Photo Editor and Expert, Quick, or 
Guided mode) support panels and a variety of 
options from panel menus and tools. In the 
Photo Editor, you see the Effects panel open in 
the Panel Bin with the Filters tab in view, as 
shown in Figure 1-13.
At the top of the Panel Bin are tabs in the Effects 
panel. Clicking a tab (Filters, Styles, or Effects) 
changes the tools and options you see. Notice 
that you also have drop-down menus on some 
tabs. In Figure 1-13, the Artistic menu is shown. 
Also, an Options drop-down menu is available: 
To open it, click the series of horizontal lines 
and a tiny down-pointing arrow shown in the 
upper-right of Figure 1-13. When you see this 
icon on any panel, click to open the menu, where 
you find menu commands for choosing addi­
tional options.

Playing with Panels
Getting choosy in the 
Favorites panel
You use the Favorites panel to add your favorite 
settings in the Photo Editor, such as the filters 
you like to apply to images. By default, you don’t 
see the Favorites panel open. Open the panel by 
clicking the Favorites icon at the bottom of the 
Panel Bin.
	
Elements provides you with a number of 
Favorites contained in the panel, as shown in 
Figure 1-14. To add one of the graphic items to 
an image in the image window, double-click the 
favorite item in the panel. You can also open the 
Options menu and choose Apply.
Exploring other panels
The icons at the bottom of the Panel Bin open different panels. By default, 
the Layers panel is in view; when you’re editing an image, you typically 
use this panel more often than the other panels.
On the far-right bottom of the Panel Bin, you see 
the Other icon. Click this item, and a pop-up 
menu appears, as shown in Figure 1-15. From 
the menu options, you can choose additional 
panels to open in the Panel Bin.
	
At the bottom of the pop-up menu you find 
Custom Workspace. In Elements 11, some panels 
were docked in the Panel Bin and could not be 
removed. Other panels appeared as floating pan­
els but could not be docked in the Panel Bin. 
Now in Elements 12, you can select Custom 
Workspace and dock/undock all panels as you 
like to create your own custom workspace.
When you open a panel by clicking one of the 
icons below the Panel Bin, such as Layers, Effects, 
Graphics, and Favorites, the panels are fixed in a 
docked position in the Panel Bin unless you choose Custom Workspace. If 
Custom Workspace is selected, you can drag panels out of the Panel Bin.
Figure 1-14: The Favorites 
panel, opened in the Panel Bin.

icon to open a pop-up menu 
where you can select other

Chapter 1
Examining the

Environment
Playing with Panels
All the panels you open from the Others pop-up menu are not docked by 
default; they open as a floating window — meaning that they open in a window 
that you can move around the Photo Editor workspace. Notice, in Figure 1-16, 
the Actions panel opens as a floating window. Once again, if you choose 
Custom Workspace, you can dock the floating panels in the Panel Bin.
Figure 1-16: The Actions panel opens as a floating window.
In Figure 1-16, you see Actions at the top of the panel that appears like a tab. 
When you open additional panels, the newly opened panels open in the 
same space and appear as tabs. In essence, additional panels dock to the 
open floating window. If you want panels in separate windows, you can drag 
them out and away from the original floating window, thereby producing 
multiple floating windows, as shown in Figure 1-17.
In Figure 1-17, the panels in the lower-left corner where you see History, 
Histogram, and Color Swatches are docked together in a single panel. You 
can tear away any one of the panels, or you can dock any one of the floating 
windows to any other panel. You do this simply by clicking and dragging the 
panel tabs.

28
Playing with Panels
Figure 1-17: Several panels open from the Others pop-up menu and appear as floating 
windows.
On the Others pop-up menu, you find the following panels:
	
✓	Actions: In earlier versions of Elements, you found Actions nested in the 
Guided panel. Actions have graduated and now appear within their own 
panel.
	
	Actions are like macros where you can automate different sequences. In 
Elements, you still can’t record a series of steps and produce your own 
custom action, but you do have many choices for preset actions that 
Adobe provides you. You can also add actions from recorded action sets 
that are produced in Adobe Photoshop. We cover more on actions in 
Book I, Chapter 2.
	
✓	Color Swatches: The Color Swatches panel displays a color set from 
which you can choose colors to apply to images and artwork. We talk 
about using the Color Swatches in Book V.
	
✓	Histogram: The Histogram panel shows a histogram of the brightness 
values in an image open in the image window. For more on understand­
ing histograms, see Book VIII.

✓	History: The History panel shows a historical view of your edits begin­
ning from the last edit made and backward. You can return to an edit in 
the History panel by clicking the item you want to return to in the panel 
list of edits. For information on using the History panel, see Book III, 
Chapter 5.
	
✓	Info: The Info panel displays information related to mouse cursor posi­
tion in the image window and assesses color values beneath the cursor. 
You can also choose to view different color models. We cover more 
about the Info panel in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
	
✓	Navigator: The Navigator provides you with a method for viewing a 
photo in the image window in zoomed views. It’s like zooming on ste­
roids. We talk more about the Navigator in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
	
Each panel you open in Expert mode in the Photo Editor has associated 
Options menus. Click the icon in the upper-right corner to look over 
your options when working in any one of the panels.
Using the Photo Bin
You might have several images you want to edit in Elements. You might 
have some image data you want to copy from one image and paste into 
another image, or maybe you want to enhance a series of images so that 
the brightness and color appear consistent in several images taken in the 
same lighting conditions.
The photos are added to the Organizer, and you can easily see their thumb­
nail images in the Media Browser. But you don’t want to continue returning 
to the Organizer to open one image or another in an editing mode.
Fortunately, thumbnails for all your open images appear in the Photo Bin, as 
shown in Figure 1-18. To see the thumbnails, click the Photo Bin button at 
the bottom of your editing workspace.
Additionally, notice the top of the image window. All open files appear 
nested in the image window as tabs with the filename displayed for each 
open image. You can close an image by clicking the X to the right of the 
filename.
	
You can change the behavior of windows in the preferences. Options exist 
for making the panels default as floating windows or tabbed in the Panel Bin. 
See Chapter 4 of this minibook for more on setting preferences.

30
Using the Photo Bin
You can easily access the images shown in the Photo Bin by clicking the 
respective filenames above the image window. You can also open several 
files in the Photo Editor and create a project from the files, such as a calen­
dar or photo book. What you see in the Photo Bin are the files that are open 
in the Photo Editor in Expert mode.
Figure 1-18: Several images opened in the Photo Editor appear in the Photo Bin.
In Figure 1-18, we opened six images, and they all appear in the Photo Bin 
when we hide the Panel Bin. (Click Layers, and the panel disappears.) If we 
want to work on the images and do something like move image data between 
the photos, we need to organize the photos in the image window a little dif­
ferently. To work between photos, we need to view each photo in its own 
separate window.
We can easily undock the photos and have them appear in separate windows 
by choosing options on the Layout menu. Click Layout at the bottom of the 
Photo Editor workspace and choose an option to view photos differently in 
the image window. In our example, we chose All Grid, as shown in Figure 1-19. 
The photos then are displayed individually in separate windows.

Getting Productive with Shortcuts
Every Adobe program supports keyboard shortcuts, and Elements makes 
use of many different keystroke actions that open menus and select various 
tools. As a matter of fact, the keystroke commands available to you are so 
numerous that you would spend considerable time committing them all to 
memory.
Fortunately, Elements provides you with many 
hints as you organize and work on your photos. 
You find hints for using keyboard shortcuts in 
the following places:
	
✓	Menus: When you open a menu and skim 
the commands, you find that many com­
mands list a keyboard shortcut, as shown 
in Figure 1-20.
	
	Look at Figure 1-20. If you want to use Auto 
Smart Fix (the first menu item), press 
Alt+Ctrl+M (⌘+Option+M on the Mac) to 
invoke the menu command. Using the 
Figure 1-20: The items to the 
right of the menu commands 
display keyboard shortcuts.

32
Finding Help When You Need It
keyboard shortcut results in exactly the 
same action as selecting the menu 
command.
	
✓	Tools: When you move the cursor over a 
tool in the Tools panel, a pop-up tooltip 
opens, as shown in Figure 1-21. To the right 
of the tool name, you see a character within 
parentheses. Typing the character on your 
keyboard accesses the tool. For example, in 
the figure, you see the Horizontal Type tool 
below the selection arrow. The character in 
the tooltip is T. If you press T on your key­
board, the Horizontal Type tool is selected. 
You select each tool by typing individual 
characters on the keyboard. To scroll 
through tools in a given group, press the 
Shift key and press the respective key. For 
example, to scroll through the Type tools, 
press T to access the Horizontal Type tool and press Shift+T to scroll 
through the different Type tools. (Note that whether you need to use the 
Shift key is determined in the General preferences.)
	
The best way to figure out keyboard shortcuts is to observe the menus and 
tools when you perform edits. For edits you use frequently, try to commit 
their keyboard shortcuts to memory. As you figure out more shortcuts, 
you’ll find that working in Elements goes much faster.
Finding Help When You Need It
We hope this book provides you with helpful information on using all the 
features you have available when working in Photoshop Elements. However, 
you don’t have to page through the book for every edit you make.
For speedy access to readily available Help information or when you want to 
expand your knowledge of commands, tools, and procedures, you have sev­
eral sources of Help information.
Using the Help menu
Open the Help menu, and you find a menu command to access the 
Photoshop Elements Help guide. The web-based Help guide is hosted on the 
Adobe website. You need an Internet connection to access the file.
After choosing Help➪Photoshop Elements Help or pressing the F1 key 
(Windows) or Help key or ⌘+? (Mac), you can search for keywords. Press 
the Enter key after typing the words you want to search for, and the panel

Windows. One the Mac you can see the PDF files in the Mac OS Preview 
application. The Installer disc contains the Adobe Reader installer. Double-
click the installer to install Adobe Reader. Then take some time to browse 
the contents of the DVD-ROM for PDF documents.
	
If you have an earlier version of Adobe Reader on a Windows computer and 
you want to install a newer version from the Elements DVD-ROM, you must 
first uninstall the earlier version of Adobe Reader before installing a newer 
version.
Reading tooltips
We cover tooltips earlier in this chapter in the section “Getting Productive 
with Shortcuts.” As you place the cursor over tools and in panels, you can 
observe the tooltips. They contain helpful information concerning the types 
of edits you want to perform or notifications of actions that take place when 
you click an object or a command.
Checking dialog boxes
When you open many different dialog boxes, you find some text adjacent to 
a light bulb icon, beginning with Learn More About and followed by blue 
text, as shown in Figure 1-22. Click the blue text, and the Adobe website 
opens to web pages where Help information is available.
Figure 1-22: You can find links to Help information 
in dialog boxes.

Every time you see a light bulb icon appearing in a dialog box, you’re one 
click away from Help information.
Upgrading to Photoshop Elements 12
We live in a world of software upgrades. As time passes, one wonders if the 
most recent upgrade is worth spending money for a few more added fea­
tures and refinement. 
With this new version of Photoshop Elements, there aren’t many dazzling 
new methods, but we believe the new wow features you do find make 
upgrading worthwhile.
For starters, Adobe has made available most of its application software 
through either purchase or a subscription where the user pays a monthly 
fee for use of the software. Photoshop Elements has joined the other applica­
tions and is now available both as a purchase and as a subscription.
	
To enumerate a little on what’s new, following is a list of some of the more 
impressive new features you find in Elements 12. They include the following:
	
✓	Adobe Revel integration: Adobe previously offered a photo-sharing ser­
vice on Photoshop.com. Photoshop.com is shutting down and is giving 
way to Adobe’s new sharing service known as Adobe Revel. From within 
the Organizer, you can easily import and export photos to and from 
Adobe Revel with one click of your mouse button. Adobe is turning the 
Organizer into a first class Revel client. For a limited free service, you 
can upload a maximum of 50 photos monthly using Adobe Revel. To 
learn more about Adobe Revel, check out Book IX, Chapter 3, where we 
discuss sharing your photos.
	
✓	Frames/textures/effects in Quick mode: Each effect applies a prede­
signed group of edits to an image. In Elements 11, you had to enter 
Expert mode from Quick to apply these effects. Now, in Elements 12, you 
can stay in Quick mode to make your brightness and color corrections, 
and then apply these effects without entering Expert mode. Book VII, 
Chapter 3, ripples with details about effects.
	
✓	Move tool in Quick mode: In earlier Elements releases, the Move tool 
wasn’t present in Quick mode. This omission may have been an over­
sight by Adobe. Now, in Elements 12, you can find this useful tool with­
out leaving Quick mode. See “Navigating the Different Modes” for a quick 
primer on this editing mode.
	
✓	New Guided edits: Three new Guided edits have been added in 
Elements 12. Restore Old Picture is a step-by-step process to help you 
restore old photos. The Puzzle Guided effect enables you to easily trans­
form your photo into a puzzle.

	Look out! If you don’t want to spend hours of fun playing with your 
images, stay away from this third new Guided edit. The Zoom Burst 
effect is guaranteed to get you hooked on applying a zoom burst on 
many of your images (refer to Figure 1-9). Zoom Burst is so easy and 
completely addictive. Book VIII, Chapter 4, guides you through the 
details.
	
✓	Content-Aware Move tool: This tool helps you easily remove distracting 
elements from the foregrounds in your images. If a trashcan appears in 
front of Uncle Albert, simply use the Content-Aware Move tool to move 
the object to a new location in your photo. Presto! Elements fills in the 
foreground so it appears as if nothing was placed in front of your fore­
ground subjects. Book VIII, Chapter 1, walks you through the steps for 
using this new tool.
	
✓	Auto correction with learning: This new feature is truly a wow effect. 
When you use the Auto Correct features in Elements such as brightness 
adjustments, contrast changes, and color correction, you may prefer a 
look on your photos with just a little more brightness, saturation, or 
contrast. Elements 12 remembers how you fine-tune your images and 
applies the same settings to all subsequent similar edits. It’s like an arti­
ficial intelligence set up to record your personal preferences. To get 
started with quick image makeovers, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.
	
✓	Places and Events tags in the Organizer: In Elements 11 the People/
Places/Events views completely removed attributes assigned to Tags. 
This was an oversight by Adobe and is now fixed in Elements 12. Book II, 
Chapter 3, helps you find your bearings with tags.
	
✓	Alphabetic sorting in the Organizer: Perhaps another oversight by 
Adobe was the absence of being able to sort image views in the Media 
Browser alphabetically. Now in Elements 12 you can sort filenames 
alphabetically. Book II, Chapter 2, helps you sort out the details.
	
✓	Content-Aware Fill and Straighten tool: Elements 11 had a Content-
Aware Fill in the Panorama Stitcher. Now in Elements 12, when you 
straighten a photo, Content-Aware Fill is applied to missing pixels 
around the edges of the straightened image. Book VIII, Chapter 3, helps 
you piece together how the updated tool works.
	
✓	Pet Eye correction: If your beloved pets are showing up with green or 
yellow eyes when you use a flash, you need worry no more. Elements 12 
can easily correct pets’ eyes, much as the Red Eye correction does for 
people. Book VIII, Chapter 1, clears up your questions about correcting 
red eyes or pet eyes.
	
✓	Sharing photos on Twitter: The Twitter social media site has supported 
photo links for some time. Now in Elements 12, you can tweet photos 
from your Twitter account without leaving the Organizer. Fly over to 
Book IX, Chapter 3, where we introduce you to Elements’ sharing 
features.

36
Upgrading to Photoshop Elements 12
	
✓	64 bits for Mac users: Here’s a feature that first comes to the Mac. You 
can now take advantage of extra RAM on the Mac. Unfortunately for 
Windows 64-bit users, you won’t see support until the next release of 
Elements. The benefit of 64-bit support is that all Elements operations 
will run much faster.
The items you find missing in Elements 12 include the following:
	
✓	Magic Extractor tool: The Image➪Magic Extractor command and the 
Magic Extractor dialog box have been eliminated.
	
✓	Photoshop Showcase (and the online albums that go with it): However, 
as mentioned earlier in this section, Photoshop Showcase is giving way 
to Adobe Revel.
	
✓	Smart Albums: If you’re looking for Smart Albums, you won’t find them 
in Elements 12. Adobe believes saved searches perform much the same 
function as creating Smart Albums and has thus eliminated this feature 
in Elements 12.
	
✓	Color Variations
	
✓	Frame from Video
	
✓	Interactive layout mode in Photomerge Panorama
	
✓	Texture Fill
There are more new features in Elements that will make your life much eas­
ier when organizing and editing photos. You’ll find much better organization 
in the Tags panel with tags divided into four categories (Keywords, People, 
Places, and Events). There are also some under-the-hood improvements in 
performance. If you’re a Mac user, you’ll appreciate the new 64-bit support. 
All in all, there’s plenty to get excited about in Elements 12 and we hope this 
book will help guide you through the maze of new features.

Chapter 2: Getting 
to Know the Tools
In This Chapter
✓	Looking at the Tools panel
✓	Understanding the tool groups
✓	Automating your image edits
Y

ou edit photos by using menu commands and tools. Elements knows 
that, so it provides you with a toolshed chock-full of tools to perform all 
sorts of editing tasks. These tasks include selecting image content areas, refin­
ing and sharpening photos, drawing and painting, adding text, and more.
In addition to using tools for manually changing the characteristics of a 
photo, you can use a number of different tools to magically automate tasks. 
In this chapter, you take a look at the Tools panel and all the tools at your 
disposal for modifying photos in many ways.
Examining the Tools Panel
The Tools panel opens by default when you enter 
Expert mode in the Editor. As you may recall from 
Chapter 1 of this minibook, you can open the Editor 
directly from the Welcome screen by clicking the 
Photo Editor button or by clicking Editor in the 
Organizer.
The tools you see in Figure 2-1 are listed by name 
and their keyboard shortcuts. If you press the key 
adjacent to a tool name shown in Figure 2-1, you 
select its respective tool. (See Chapter 1 in this mini­
book for more on keyboard shortcuts.)

38
Examining the Tools Panel
Figure 2-1: The Tools panel.
The tools in the Tools panel include the ones in the following list, from top 
to bottom (sort of). To get you into the habit of using keyboard shortcuts, 
we list the shortcut associated with each tool and describe what you can do 
with each one:
	
Z	Zoom: Click with this tool to zoom in on an image. Press the Alt (Option 
on the Mac) key when the tool is selected and click to zoom out.

the Tools
Examining the Tools Panel
	
H	Hand: Move an image around the image window. If you zoom in on a 
photo and see scroll bars on the right and left sides of the image window, 
you can drag the image around the window to display hidden areas.
	
V	Move: Move either content within a selection, a layer, or an entire image.
	
M	Marquee: One of many tools you can use to select part of an image.
	
L	Lasso: Select part of an image in a free-form manner.
	
A	Quick Selection: Similar to the Magic Wand tool, lets you click and drag 
to select part of an image.
	
Y	Red Eye: Remove red-eye from photos.
	
J	Spot Healing Brush: Repair images by removing dust and scratches.
	
F	Smart Brush: Brighten or add contrast to areas you specify by “brushing 
over” the image.
	
S	Clone Stamp: Clone an image area.
	
R	Blur: Soften edges, particularly when you paste new image content into 
a photo and want to blur the edges of the pasted data slightly.
	
O	Sponge: Add or remove color saturation on a photo.
	
B	Brush: Paint over a photo using a number of brush tips.
	
E	Eraser: Erase part of an image.
	
K	Paint Bucket: Fill an area with a foreground color.
	
G	Gradient: Create gradients.
	
I	Color Picker: Sample color in an image. Click anywhere in a photo, and 
the foreground color swatch changes to the sample taken with the Color 
Picker tool. Press the Alt (Option) key and click the Color Picker tool to 
sample color for the background color.
	
	If you’re using other marking tools, such as Brush, Pencil, Blur, and so 
on, pressing Alt (Option) temporarily switches to the Color Picker tool. 
Release the Alt/Option key and you return to the last selected tool.
	
U	Custom Shape: Create a vector shape on a new layer. This is one of 
many Shape tools you can choose in the Tool Options panel.
	
T	Horizontal Type: Add text to a photo.
	
N	Pencil: Draw free-form as if you’re using a pencil.
	
C	Crop: Crop images.
	
W	Recompose: Recompose an image by making selections and resizing 
selected areas of an image.
	
Q	Content-Aware Move tool: Select an area in a photo and move the selec­
tion away. Elements automatically fills the empty space with content so 
the photo appears with a background similar to the surrounding area.

40
Using Selection Tools
	
P	Straighten: Straighten images — particularly useful for scanned images.
	
X	Switch Foreground and Background Colors: Toggle between the fore­
ground and background colors.
	
D	Default Foreground and Background Colors: Return the foreground 
color to default black and the background color to default white.
Many tools in the Tools panel have companion tools that form a group. For 
example, the Lasso tool is contained among a group with the Magnetic Lasso 
and Polygon Lasso tools. Prior to Elements 11, tools within common groups 
appeared in pop-out toolbars. You accessed the toolbar by pressing the 
mouse button down on a tool that displayed a tiny arrow below and to the 
right of the tool.
Photoshop Elements 11 and 12 have eliminated the pop-out toolbars in the 
Tools panel. All tools within tool groups are now accessed in the Tool 
Options panel. (For more information on the Tool Options panel, see 
Chapter 1 in this minibook.)
	
Elements supports touch-screen capability on both Windows and Mac plat­
forms. If you have a touch-screen monitor, or an iPad with a VNC (Virtual 
Network Computing) application, you can browse images in the Organizer by 
simply flicking with your fingers. What’s even cooler is that you can retouch 
and enhance images by using all the tools in the Tools panel with your fin­
gers. Mouse? We don’t need no stinkin’ mouse!
	
After you know the keyboard shortcuts for accessing tools, you can select 
tools within common tool groups by pressing the keystroke to access a tool 
plus the Shift key. For example, if you press L, you access the Lasso tool. 
When you press Shift+L, you access the Magnetic Lasso tool. Press Shift+L 
again, and you access the Polygon Lasso tool. You can also bypass adding 
the Shift key in the General preferences. If you disable Use Shift Key for Tool 
Switch, you can change tools simply by pressing the key for the respective 
character.
You can think of the tools in the Tools panel as part of individual categories. 
Knowing a little about the categories can help you decide where to look first 
when you want to make edits to a photo. The rest of this chapter discusses 
each tool in its category.
Using Selection Tools
You use selection tools to create selections of pixels in a photo. Unlike the 
objects you find in programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint, graphics you 
import in Microsoft Word, or artwork you create in illustration programs 
such as Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw, photos are composed of tiny pixels. 
In other programs where objects are available, you can just click the mouse 

41
Book I 
Chapter 2
Getting to Know  
the Tools
Using Selection Tools
button with the cursor placed on an object to select it. In Photoshop 
Elements, you surround pixels with a selection tool to select part of a photo.
Clicking an object is easy, but selecting pixels requires some careful steps. 
You must also use the best tool to make a given selection. You can easily run 
into problems when little contrast and slight color difference exist between 
the areas you want to select and the areas you want to remain unselected in 
a photo.
You can also use certain keyboard modifiers to manage selections when 
using a selection tool. Such modifiers include
	
✓	Shift key: If you select a geometric selection tool and then press the 
Shift key while dragging the mouse, shapes are constrained to a square 
or circle. Also, if you make a selection on a photo and then press the 
Shift key and drag a new selection, you get to add that selection to the 
one you’ve already made. If you’ve made a selection on a photo and 
don’t use the Shift key when you create a new selection, the first area 
you chose becomes deselected by default.
	
✓	Alt (Option on the Mac) key: When you press the Alt (Option) key and 
drag a geometric selection tool, you draw the selection from the center 
outward. If you already have a selection and then press the Alt (Option) 
key and drag through the first selection, you remove that segment from 
the current selection.
	
✓	Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac): If you already have a selection 
drawn, pressing the Shift key and the Alt (Option) key while dragging 
through that selection creates a new selection at the intersection with 
the original selection.
	
✓	Spacebar: If you press the spacebar while you press the mouse button, 
you can move a selection to another area in a photo without changing 
the size of the selection.
	
✓	Tool Options panel: Don’t forget the Tool Options panel below the 
Media Browser. When you click a selection tool, you find additional 
choices available by clicking one of the choices in the Tool Options 
panel. Choose from Creating a New Selection, Add to a Selection, 
Subtract from a Selection, or Intersect with a Selection.
The following sections introduce you to the tools, and you find out details 
about how to create selections with them in Book IV.
Geometric selection tools
The geometric selection tools include the Rectangular Marquee tool and the 
Elliptical Marquee tool. By default, the Rectangular Marquee tool appears 
“on top” in the Tools panel, whereas the Elliptical Marquee tool is hidden 
from view. So how do you find the hidden tool? Easy — look down at the 
Tool Options panel. In the Tool Options panel, you see all tools within the 

42
Using Selection Tools
selected tool’s group as well as attribute choices for setting options for the 
tools, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: When you click the Rectangle Marquee tool, the Elliptical Marquee tool appears 
beside the Rectangle Marquee tool in the Tool Options panel.
	
Using geometric selection tools is straightforward. Click either the 
Rectangular Marquee tool or the Elliptical Marquee tool and drag on a 
photo to create a rectangle or ellipse.
	
The Tool Options panel occupies the same space as the Photo Bin (see 
Chapter 1 in this minibook for more on the Photo Bin). If you want to return 
to the Photo Bin after selecting a tool, click Photo Bin at the bottom of the 
Editor window. If you want to dismiss the Tool Options panel (and the Photo 
Bin), click the down-pointing arrow in the upper right (shown in Figure 2-2).
Lasso tools
Whereas the geometric selection tools restrict you to creating rectangles and 
elliptical shapes, the Lasso tools are used to create irregular selections — 
similar to freehand drawing with a pencil. The following three types of Lasso 
tools are shown in the Tool Options panel in Figure 2-3:
	
✓	Lasso: Click this tool and draw on a photo in a free-
form fashion to select pixels around irregular 
shapes.
	
✓	Magnetic Lasso: With this tool, you can click and 
drag around a shape, and Elements magically hugs 
the shape as you draw. If you have a foreground fig­
ure that you want to isolate from the background, 
you can drag this tool around the shape. Elements 
automatically refines the selection to grab the 
shape you’re selecting.
	
✓	Polygonal Lasso: This tool behaves like a Polygon 
tool that requires you to click and release the 
mouse button and then move the cursor to click in 
another area on the photo. As you continue clicking, 
the selection shape takes the form of a polygon.
Figure 2-3: Click the 
Lasso tool in the 
Tools panel and 
observe the com­
panion tools in the 
Tool Options panel.

43
Book I 
Chapter 2
Getting to Know  
the Tools
Using Selection Tools
In Figure 2-3, the Magnetic Lasso tool is selected in the Tool Options panel, 
and the tool name appears above the tool. As you select a tool, the tool 
name appears similarly in the Tool Options panel.
Magic Wand tool
The Magic Wand tool is truly magical. This tool performs a few different 
actions. For example, when you click the tool in an area of a blue sky, the 
area you click is sampled for the selected pixel value. Immediately following 
the mouse click, Elements travels outward in a contiguous area to find pixels 
of similar value and includes them in the selection.
To determine the amount of variance of the pixel values picked up by the 
Magic Wand tool, tweak the Tolerance value in the Tool Options panel, as 
shown in Figure 2-4. You can change (by moving the slider or typing in the 
text box) the value so that the Magic Wand tool selects a wider range of pix­
els (a higher number) or narrower range of pixels (a lower value).
Figure 2-4: You can change the Tolerance value to select a wider or 
narrower range of pixels.
	
By default, the Tolerance value is set to 32, which means that the pixel you 
click produces a selection of 16 pixel values lower than the sample and 16 
pixel values higher than the sample.
After you create a selection with the Magic Wand tool and you want to add 
another selection to the first selection, press the Shift key and click the 
Magic Wand tool in another area on the photo. If you grab too many pixels, 
you can press the Alt (Option) key and click the area you don’t want to be 
selected. If you need to refine the selection, you can adjust the Tolerance 
value in the Tool Options panel before clicking the mouse button each time 
you add to or subtract from a selection.
	
Suppose that you make a selection with the Magic Wand tool and the selec­
tion appears with tiny gaps (unselected areas). You can quickly grab those 
tiny areas that were not selected by using a menu command. Choose Select➪
Modify➪Expand and type a small number in the Expand Selection dialog box 
(1 or 2 pixels). The selection expands. Now return to the Select menu and 
choose Modify➪Contract. Type the same value in the dialog box (1 or 2 pix­
els) to contract the selection. 

44
Using Selection Tools
Quick Selection tool
The Quick Selection tool is similar to the Magic Wand tool. Click the tool in 
an area of a photo, and three check boxes in the Tool Options panel permit 
you to start a new selection, add to the current selection, or subtract from 
the current selection.
If the Quick Selection tool isn’t visible in the Tools panel, click the Selection 
Brush or the Magic Wand tool and click the Quick Selection tool in the Tool 
Options panel (refer to Figure 2-4).
In Figure 2-5, we used the Quick Selection tool and clicked a few times in the 
sky area of the photo to create the selection.
Figure 2-5: Click the Quick Selection tool in a few areas with similar 
pixel values to create a selection.
	
After you have a selection — regardless of the tool you used to create 
the selection — other edits you perform in Elements apply to only the 
active selection. If no selection appears on your photo, edits are made to 
the entire layer.
Using Figure 2-6 as an example, we wanted to add a little more character to 
the sky. We first set the foreground color to a light blue, and then applied 

45
Book I 
Chapter 2

the Tools
Using Drawing and Painting Tools
the Filter➪Render➪Clouds filter to artificially create a better sky. (For more 
information on using filters, see Book VII, Chapter 1.)
Figure 2-6: After you create a selection, you can apply edits to just the 
selected area.
Selection Brush tool
Use the Selection Brush tool like a brush to change shapes and diameters 
and paint over an area in an image. The result is a selection. To find out 
more about the Selection Brush tool, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
Using Drawing and Painting Tools
Drawing and painting tools provide you with a huge number of options for 
adding illustrations, paintings, and effects and modifying brightness and con­
trast in photos. Don’t think of these tools strictly as tools you use to draw 
and paint. You can also use them for color correction, contrast adjustments, 
and other kinds of brightness enhancements. Check out the introduction to 
the tools here and flip to Book V to find steps to guide you through the pro­
cess of using them.

46
Using Drawing and Painting Tools
Brush tools
Several types of Brush tools are tucked away in the Tool Options panel. To 
view all tools, click the Brush tool and look down to the Tool Options panel 
to see the additional Brush tools, shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7: The Brush tools.
The tools that are available in the Tool Options panel are
	
✓	Brush: The Brush tool supports a number of different brush tips that 
you can choose from the Tool Options panel. You use the Brush tool as 
you would use a brush to apply paint to a canvas. You can paint within 
type selections, add color to selected areas, paint in selection channels, 
and more. For more information on selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1. 
For more on type selections, see Book V, Chapter 3. For more on selec­
tion channels and selection masks, see Book VI, Chapter 4.
	
✓	Impressionist Brush: This tool is designed to paint over a photo to make 
it look like a masterpiece by Renoir or Matisse. You can set various 
options that change the brush stroke style. Styles are chosen from a 
drop-down list in the Tool Options panel.
	
✓	Color Replacement: As its name suggests, you use this tool to paint 
over areas where you want to replace color.
	
✓	Tablet support: To the right of 
the three Brush tools, you see 
two more tools. These tools are 
only active when you use a tab­
let and stylus. The tools offer 
Brush mode (left) or Airbrush 
mode (right).
Smart Brush tools
The Smart Brush tools, shown in 
Figure 2-8, are located in the Tool 
Options panel. As you can see in 
Figure 2-8, the tools support options 
that you can select in a pop-up 
menu.

Using Tools for Cloning and Healing
Using the Smart Brush and Detail Smart Brush tools is impressive and 
requires more than a brief explanation here. For a detailed view of using the 
brushes, see Book VIII, Chapter 2.
Eraser tools
Three Eraser tools appear in the Tool Options panel, as shown in Figure 2-9:
	
✓	Eraser: The Eraser tool paints a color on a photo if you’re 
erasing on the Background layer. The current background 
color is used when you paint with this tool on the 
Background layer. If your photo appears on a layer, the 
Eraser tool behaves like a normal eraser, removing pixels 
as you drag across a photo.
	
✓	Background Eraser: When you open a photo in the 
Editor, the photo appears on a background. Certain 
objects and types are added in layers that appear above 
the background. Two things happen when you make your 
first edit with this tool: The background is converted to a 
layer, and as you drag the cursor, the image data is 
removed from the layer.
	
✓	Magic Eraser: The Magic Eraser tool sort of combines the Quick 
Selection tool and the Eraser tool. When you click and draw on a back­
ground, the area where you click is selected just as with the Quick 
Selection tool. Also, the background is converted to a layer, and the 
selected area is removed from the photo.
For details about working with each eraser, flip to Book VI, Chapter 4.
Paint Bucket tool
The Paint Bucket tool performs two separate actions when you click the tool 
in a photo. First it creates a selection similar to the one you create with the 
Magic Wand tool. After the selection is created, the foreground color fills the 
selected area. See Book V, Chapter 2, for more about the Paint Bucket tool.
Gradient tool
You can use the Gradient tool to create a gradient on a layer or within a 
selected area. You have a number of choices for gradient colors from the 
Tool Options panel, or you can add custom colors to create the gradient 
effect. Book V, Chapter 2, explains how to create and customize gradients.
Using Tools for Cloning and Healing
The cloning and healing tools are used for effects and when you need to 
clean up images. Cloning involves duplicating an image area to construct 
Figure 2-9: 
The Eraser 
tools.

48
Using Tools for Cloning and Healing
image content that wasn’t in the original photo, whereas healing means (in 
an Elements context) removing dust, scratches, and imperfections in photos. 
Book VIII, Chapter 1, explains how to use these tools to fix problems in your 
images.
Cloning tools
Cloning tools are designed to duplicate image areas. You can use them for 
artistic effects and for reconstructing, repairing, and enhancing photos. The 
two tools are
	
✓	Clone Stamp: You use this tool by first sampling an area on a photo you 
want to clone. To sample, you place the cursor over the area to clone, 
press the Alt (Option) key, and then click the mouse button. You then 
move the cursor to an area where the clone image will appear and start 
painting with the cursor.
	
✓	Pattern Stamp: Use the Pattern Stamp tool to apply a pattern you select 
from a list of available patterns from the Tool Options panel. Select 
a pattern and paint with the cursor to apply the pattern to an area on a 
photo.
Healing brushes
Healing brushes are designed for photo-repair tasks, such as removing dust 
and scratches. The two Healing Brush tools are
	
✓	Spot Healing Brush: The Spot Healing Brush tool automatically samples 
neighboring pixels to correct image imperfections in one step. Unlike 
when you use the Healing Brush tool, you don’t need to sample an area 
and then apply the brush strokes.
	
✓	Healing Brush: You use the Healing Brush tool by first pressing the Alt 
(Option) key and sampling an area you want to use as a source for the 
repair. Then move the cursor to a scratch or another imperfection and 
paint over the area.
Content-Aware Move tool
	
The Content-Aware Move tool gives you yet another way to fix photo imper­
fections. This is a new tool introduced in Elements 12. Suppose that you 
have a nice photo, but a trash can or some other object appears in the fore­
ground. The Content-Aware Move tool enables you to easily move the object 
out of the way. You simply draw a selection around the object you want to 
move and then drag the selection away, as shown in Figure 2-10.

top to bottom, are
	
✓	Horizontal Type: Click the cursor and type text horizon­
tally. You can choose from various type attributes in the 
Tool Options panel.
	
✓	Vertical Type: Use this tool to add type vertically on a 
photo.
	
✓	Horizontal Type Mask: The Type Mask tools create selection outlines of 
the characters you type. As the tool name indicates, the text created 
with this tool is oriented horizontally.
	
✓	Vertical Type Mask: Use this tool to create a selection mask vertically.
	
✓	Text on Selection: Click this tool and make a selection. After completing 
the selection, you add text to the selection path.
	
✓	Text on Shape: Click this tool, and you can draw a shape (like a box). 
Move the cursor over the shape while the tool is still selected and add 
type to the shape. For example, add type around the sides of a box.
	
✓	Text on Custom Path: Click this tool, and you draw a line free-form — 
it’s much like using a Pencil tool, but the cursor appearance is like a Pen 
tool. After drawing a line, click the cursor on the line to add text along 
the path.

Using Focus and Toning Tools
Discover the tips and tricks of typography and see how to more precisely 
use the Elements 12 Type tools in Book V, Chapter 3.
Using Focus and Toning Tools
Use focus and toning tools to edit image brightness, contrast, and color. 
Several tools for making these adjustments are contained within the Tools 
panel. Book VIII, Chapter 1, explains how you use these tools to create your 
desired results.
Red Eye Removal tool
In Elements 12, two tools appear in the Tools Panel:
	
✓	Red Eye Removal tool: This tool is used to scrub over red-eye that fre­
quently appears when taking pictures indoors with a flash.
	
✓	Pet Red Eye tool: This tool is new to Elements 12. We’ve had a red-eye 
correction tool available for people, but Adobe forgot about our pets 
that show up with green eyes when we’re shooting with flash. This tool 
helps you correct red-eye (or green-eye) problems with your pets.
Toning tools
Toning tools are used to refine edges on pasted content of 
photos by softening edges, sharpening areas of a photo, and 
blending areas that might have been cloned or pasted into 
photos. The tools, as shown in Figure 2-12, are
	
✓	Blur: Scrub over an area to blur the pixels.
	
✓	Sharpen: Scrub over an area to sharpen it.
	
✓	Smudge: Scrub over an area to blend pixels.
Focus tools
You use focus tools for making edits similar to those tradi­
tionally used in photo darkrooms. The tools, shown in 
Figure 2-13, are
	
✓	Sponge: Use this tool on an area that you want to either 
saturate with more color or reduce saturation. The 
choices for saturation and desaturation are found in the 
Tool Options panel.
	
✓	Dodge: The process of dodging in a traditional darkroom 
holds back light during a print exposure resulting in a 
Figure 2-12: 
The Toning 
tools.

lighter image. Use this tool to scrub over areas in a photo that you want 
to lighten.
	
✓	Burn: Burning has the opposite effect as dodging. Use this tool to darken 
image areas.
Creating Shapes
Use shapes to add artistic elements to photos or to mask out areas in a 
photo. We explain using shapes in layers and masks in Book VI. Find out 
your options in the following sections.
Cookie Cutter tool
When you click and drag the Cookie 
Cutter tool on a photo, the entire 
area outside the shape is eliminated 
from the layer. You can see some of 
the shapes available in Figure 2-14. 
Book VI, Chapter 4, cuts to the chase 
with steps for using this tool.
Shape tools
Shape tools, as shown in Figure 2-15, 
add different shape objects to your 
images.
This list describes what you can do 
with the Shape tools:
	
✓	Rectangle: Draw a rectangle.
	
✓	Rounded Rectangle: Draw rect­
angles with rounded corners.
	
✓	Ellipse: Draw elliptical shapes.
	
✓	Polygon: Draw polygonal 
shapes.
	
✓	Line: Draw lines.
	
✓	Custom Shape: Draw custom 
shapes from a choice of shapes 
identical to those available for the Cookie Cutter tool. Again, you make 
shape choices from a drop-down list in the Tool Options panel.
	
✓	Shape Selection: After a shape has been drawn, it appears as an object 
on a photo. Move it by clicking and dragging with this tool.
Figure 2-14: To change the Cookie Cutter 
shape, open the pop-up menu and click a 
different shape.

Viewing, Navigating, and Sampling Tools
Viewing, Navigating, and Sampling Tools
Some of the tools in Elements are useful for zooming in and out of photos, 
moving photos around the image window, and sampling color.
Color Picker tool
The Color Picker tool samples color and places the sample color in the 
Foreground color swatch. If you press the Alt (Option) key and click the Color 
Picker tool, the sampled color is placed in the Background color swatch.
Hand tool
Use the Hand tool to move a photo around the image window.
Zoom tool
Click the Zoom tool to zoom in on a photo. Press the Alt (Option) key to 
zoom out.
You find the same magnifying glass icon for the Zoom tool appearing in dif­
ferent dialog boxes. Whenever you see this tool icon, realize that in order 
to zoom out, you always need to press the Alt (Option) key and then click 
the photo.
	
When using any of the painting tools, pressing Alt (Option) shows you the 
Eyedropper tool. You can click to sample color; release the Alt (Option) key 
to return to the selected painting tool.
Other Editing Tools
Some miscellaneous tools are contained in the Tools panel to perform addi­
tional edits.
Move tool
Click and drag with the Move tool to move the 
selection on the canvas. This tool is particularly 
helpful when moving layer content if you’re cre­
ating layered files. If you press the Alt key 
(Option on the Mac) when you drag, you dupli­
cate the content.
Crop tool
Use the Crop tool, shown in Figure 2-16, for 
cropping images.
Figure 2-16: The Crop tool.

53
Book I 
Chapter 2
Getting to Know  
the Tools
Discovering the Automation Tools
The Crop tool provides you with choices for a rule-of-thirds grid, a grid, a 
golden ratio grid, or no grid — shown from left to right in Figure 2-16. You 
can also drag the Crop tool outside the image borders to add more canvas 
area to your photos. To find out more about using the new features for the 
Crop tool and understanding the grid choices, see Book III, Chapter 1.
Recompose tool
The Recompose tool was nested with the Crop tool in Elements 10. In 
Elements 11 and 12, the Recompose tool occupies its own position in the 
Tools panel. This tool is marvelous when you have large gaps between sub­
jects and want to narrow the gaps to bring people closer together in a group 
shot. For more information on using the Recompose tool, see Book IV, 
Chapter 1.
Straighten tool
Use the Straighten tool to straighten crooked images. This tool is especially 
useful for slightly tilted images. We used the Straighten tool in Chapter 1 of 
this minibook in Guided mode. Refer to Chapter 1 to see how the Straighten 
tool helps you straighten images.
	
In earlier versions of Elements, the Straighten tool left some gaps after 
straightening a photo. In Elements 12, you find a Content-Aware Fill applied 
to the Straighten tool, and the results are much improved.
Discovering the Automation Tools
Elements offers you some one-click steps to improve your images. Although 
these automated tasks aren’t tools per se, we list them here as tools to sim­
plify the message. In reality, you use menu commands to automate certain 
refinements for your photos. More authentic automation is available using 
the Actions panel.
Using one-click auto 
adjustments
To observe the automation tools 
available to you, click the Enhance 
menu and look over the first set of 
commands, as shown in Figure 2-17. 
If a menu command name begins 
with Auto, the command has some­
thing to do with an automated 
function.
Figure 2-17: Some automated tasks in 
Elements are listed as menu commands in the 
Enhance menu.

54
Discovering the Automation Tools
The automated features you find in the Enhance menu are
	
✓	Auto Smart Fix: Use Auto Smart Fix to add more contrast, adjust bright­
ness, and improve color by using only one menu choice.
	
✓	Auto Levels: The Levels adjustment is used to adjust image brightness. 
Elements takes a guess at the proper brightness level and automatically 
boosts the white and black points in your photos to render a pure white 
and rich black.
	
✓	Auto Contrast: Use this command when contrast is flat and without any 
snap.
	
✓	Auto Color Correction: Auto Color Correction improves color in images 
by removing color casts.
	
✓	Auto Sharpen: Use the Auto Sharpen command to sharpen dull images.
	
✓	Auto Red Eye Fix: You use this tool to remove red-eye in photos. If you 
have a group shot taken with a flash, you can use this command to 
remove red-eye from all subjects.
	
In previous versions of Elements, the auto-correction tools offered you cor­
rections without regard to your personal preferences. For example, some 
people may like to see photos with a bit more contrast while others may 
want a little less contrast. Now in Elements 12, you find an implementation of 
Auto Correction with Learning. In essence, Elements learns some tweaks 
that you make to adjustments and applies the same tweaks to all subsequent 
images you correct. It’s like an artificial intelligence application for your per­
sonal use with the auto-correction tools.
Running actions
An action is an automated set of 
sequences. You find several of these 
available in the Actions panel. To 
access actions, click More in the 
Editor at the bottom of the Panel 
Bin. From the pop-up menu, choose 
Actions. To perform an action on an 
image, do the following:
	
1.	 Open an image in the Editor 
and open the Actions panel.
	
2.	 Look over the actions appear­
ing in the panel. If you see one 
you like, skip to Step 4. If you 
don’t find the action you want, 
open the Options menu and 
choose Load Actions, as shown 
in Figure 2-18.
Figure 2-18: Open the Options menu and click 
Load Actions.

55
Book I 
Chapter 2
Getting to Know

Discovering the Automation Tools
	
	 After clicking Load Actions, the Load dialog box opens. Elements takes 
you to the Actions depository automatically. You don’t have to search 
your hard drive for the Actions files.
	
3.	 In the Load dialog box shown in Figure 2-19, select the action set you 
want and click Load.
	
	 In our example, we chose the Image Effects actions.
Figure 2-19: Select the action set you want to use and click Load.
	
4.	 Run the action.
	
	 In our example, we want to use a simple action to create a sepia toning 
on an image. Click the action you want to use and click the Play Selection 
(right-pointing arrow), as shown in Figure 2-20. The action runs and 
produces the effect in a single step.
Many predefined actions are available in Elements. Have some fun and poke 
around, experimenting with the effects that the actions produce.
If you want a custom action that’s not available in Elements, you can create 
actions (or have them created for you) in Adobe Photoshop. You can also 
find actions available for download from the Internet. Elements will run most 
of the actions you create in Photoshop or download from sites offering free 
or for-purchase action sets.

O

ne of the most important aspects of working with images in an editor 
is navigation — knowing how to move around the image (as well as 
between images) and how to use tools and menu commands to help.
Many tools in Elements enable you to zoom in and out of images, acquire 
information about your photos, and examine them in detail. In this 
chapter, we talk about these tools and clue you in on the best 
methods to use for viewing files in an editor.
	
When you open the Photo Editor, you arrive at the last 
mode you viewed. You find three different modes — 
Quick, Guided, and Expert. Throughout this chapter, 
when we refer to the Photo Editor, we assume that 
you enter the Expert mode. After you select Expert 
in the Photo Editor, all future editing sessions open 
in the last mode you selected.
Looking at the Image Window
The first thing you need to know about examining an image 
is how to open it in the Image window. The Image window in 
the Photo Editor is where your photos open, ready for editing. To 
open an image in the Photo Editor, you have a few options available to you.
Like almost all programs, Elements supports choosing File➪Open. When 
you use that menu command, a dialog box opens, enabling you to navigate 
your hard drive and select a photo. Click the Open button, and the photo 
opens in the Image window.

58
Looking at the Image Window
Another method for opening photos is to use the Organizer, where you 
select one or more photos you want to edit. Because we cover the essential 
steps for using the Organizer in Book II, Chapter 2, we take a look here at 
opening a file from the Organizer in the Photo Editor:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer.
	
	 You can launch Photoshop Elements and click the Organizer button on 
the Welcome screen to open the Organizer window; or, if you’re in an 
edit mode now, click the Organizer button at the bottom of the Photo 
Editor window.
	
2.	 Click a photo thumbnail in the Organizer window.
	
	 Following this step presumes that you have photos in the default cata­
log, as we explain in Chapter 1 of this minibook and elaborate more in 
Book II, Chapter 2.
	
3.	 Click Editor at the bottom of the Organizer window or press Ctrl+I/⌘+I.
	
	 The photo opens in the Image window, as shown in Figure 3-1. By default 
and unless you made any changes to the Photo Editor Preferences, the 
photo appears as a tab in the Photo Editor. In Figure 3-1, we dragged the 
photo away from the top so that it appears as a floating window.
Figure 3-1: The Image window.

59
Book I
Chapter 3
Viewing and 
Navigating Images
Looking at the Image Window
Figure 3-1 highlights several important items when you view photos in the 
Image window:
	
✓	The filename appears in the upper-left corner of the photo (above the 
center on the Mac). Double-check the name to be certain that the photo 
you want to edit is the correct image.
	
✓	Scroll bars become active when you zoom in on an image. You can click 
the scroll arrows, move the scroll bar, or grab the Hand tool in the Tools 
panel and then drag within the window to move the image.
	
✓	The Magnification box shows you at a glance how much you’ve zoomed 
in or out.
	
✓	The Information box shows you the readout for a particular tidbit of 
information. You can choose which information you want to see in this 
area by choosing an option from the pop-up menu.
	
	When you’re working on an image in Elements, you should know its 
physical image size, image resolution, and color mode. (We explain 
these terms in more detail in Book III, Chapters 1 and 2.) Regardless of 
which menu option you choose from the Information box, you can get a 
quick glimpse of these essential statistics by clicking the Information 
box, which displays a pop-up menu like the one shown in Figure 3-2.
	
✓	The Size box enables you to resize the 
window. Move the cursor to the box, and 
a diagonal line with two opposing arrows 
appears. When the cursor changes, drag in 
or out to size the window smaller or larger, 
respectively.
	
	You can also resize the window by dragging 
any other corner in or out.
	
✓	You can click the Close button that appears 
as an X in Windows (upper-right corner as 
shown in Figure 3-1) or like a red button 
(upper-left corner on the Mac) to close the 
active Image window and keep Elements 
open. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+W 
(⌘+W on the Mac) or choose File➪Close to 
close the active window.
When you’re familiar with the overall Image 
­window, we want to introduce you to the 
Information box’s other drop-down menu, in 
which you choose the type of information you 
want to view in the Information box. Click the 
right-pointing arrow (not the information in 
the box itself) to open the menu, as shown in 
Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-2: Click the readout 
in the Information box to see 
important information about 
your file.
Figure 3-3: From the drop-down 
menu in the Information box, you 
select commands that provide 
information about your file.

60
Looking at the Image Window
Here’s the lowdown on the options you find on the drop-down menu:
	
✓	Document Sizes: Shows you the saved file size.
	
✓	Document Profile: Shows you the color profile used with the file. For 
more on color profiles, see Book III, Chapter 5.
	
✓	Document Dimensions: Shows you the physical size in the default unit 
of measure, such as inches.
	
✓	Current Selected Layer: This item has been added in Elements 12. When 
you click Current Selected Layer, the layer name appears adjacent to the 
right-pointing arrow that opens the pop-up menu.
	
✓	Scratch Sizes: Displays the amount of memory on your hard drive that’s 
consumed by all documents open in Elements. The scratch space is the 
extension of RAM created by a space on your hard drive. For example, 
20M/200M indicates that the open documents consume 20 megabytes 
(M) and that a total of 200 megabytes is available for Elements to edit 
your images. When you add more content to a file, such as new layers, 
the first number grows while the second number remains static.
	
✓	Efficiency: Indicates how many operations are being performed in RAM 
as opposed to using your scratch disk. When the number is 100 percent, 
you’re working in RAM. When the number drops below 100 percent, 
you’re using the scratch disk.
	
	Continually working below 100 percent is a good indication that you 
need to buy more RAM to increase efficiency.
	
✓	Timing: Indicates the time it took to complete the last operation.
	
✓	Current Tool: Shows the name of the tool selected from the Tools panel.
Don’t worry about trying to understand all these terms. The important thing 
to know is that you can visit the drop-down menu to change the items at will 
during your editing sessions.
	
The Image window is just one small part of the user interface in Elements. To 
get the full picture, imagine that when a photo opens in the Photo Editor, 
you see the Image window contained within the workspace as a whole, 
where you have access to tools, panels, and menus to choose from a variety 
of editing options.
If you select multiple files in the Organizer and click the Editor button, all 
photos open in the Image window. Clicking the filename in the Image window 
brings forward a photo so that you can edit it. Likewise, double-click a 
thumbnail in the Photo Bin, and the photo moves forward and appears in the 
Image window. In the workspace interface, you see an arrangement similar 
to the one in Figure 3-4 when a photo is opened in the Image window and 
several other open photos appear in the Photo Bin. In Figure 3-4, the Panel 
Bin is visible. (If the Panel Bin is hidden, choose Window➪Panel Bin or click 
the Layers icon at the bottom of the Photo Bin.)

Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
Figure 3-4: One photo in the Image window with several open photos in the Photo Bin.
Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
Precision goes a long way toward making good edits on photos. When you’re 
working carefully on image detail, zoom in on any part of a picture where 
you want to (carefully) apply some fine-tuning. Nothing looks worse than 
photos with obvious edits that were clumsily made.
Zooming with keyboard shortcuts
For some quick zooms in and out of photos, you can use keyboard short­
cuts. Here are a few to keep in mind when you need to quickly change the 
zoom level:
	
✓	Ctrl++ (⌘++ on the Mac): Press the Ctrl (⌘) key and the plus (+) key, 
and you zoom in on a photo. Keep pressing the same keys to continue 
zooming in. By default, when you press these keys, the photo and the 
Image window zoom together.

62
Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
	
✓	Ctrl+– (⌘+– on the Mac): Press the Ctrl (⌘) key and the minus (–) key, 
and you zoom out. Again, the Image window zooms along with the 
photo.
	
✓	Ctrl+Alt++ (⌘+Option++ on the Mac): Press both the Ctrl (⌘) and Alt 
(Option) keys and then press the plus (+) key. The photo zooms in, but 
the Image window stays fixed at one size.
	
✓	Ctrl+Alt+– (⌘+Option+– on the Mac): Press both the Ctrl (⌘) and Alt 
(Option) keys and then press the minus (–) key. The photo zooms out, 
but the Image window stays fixed at one size.
	
✓	Ctrl+0 (⌘+0 on the Mac): Press the Ctrl (⌘) key and then 0 (the zero 
key), and the photo zooms to fit the Image window.
	
✓	Ctrl+spacebar (⌘+spacebar on the Mac): This combination temporarily 
activates the Zoom In tool. For this shortcut to work on a Mac, you need 
to change the System Preferences and reallocate the Spotlight shortcut 
to another key combination.
	
✓	Ctrl+Alt+spacebar (⌘+Option+spacebar on the Mac): This combination 
temporarily activates the Zoom Out tool. You also need to reallocate the 
Spotlight shortcut on the Mac.
Using the Zoom tool
	
	 You can use the Zoom tool to zoom in and out of the Image window. You 
first click to select the Zoom tool in the Tools panel and then click the photo 
to zoom in. (To zoom out, press the Alt [Option] key when clicking the Zoom 
tool on the photo.)
	
While working on an image using another tool from the Tools panel, you can 
temporarily access the Zoom tool without clicking it in the Tools panel. Press 
Ctrl+spacebar (⌘+spacebar on the Mac), and the cursor changes to the 
Zoom In tool. To zoom out, press Ctrl+Alt+spacebar (⌘+Option+spacebar on 
the Mac). When you release the keys on the keyboard, you return to the tool 
last selected in the Tools panel.
When you select the Zoom tool in the Tools panel, the Options panel shows 
your choices for zooming, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-5: Click the Zoom tool, and the Options panel displays more 
options for zooming.

Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
The tools available in the Zoom tool Options panel are
	
✓	+/–: The plus and minus icons are for zooming in and out of a photo in 
the Image window. Click one of the icons to zoom in or out.
	
✓	Slider and Percent readout: You can change the number in the text box 
to zoom to a percentage size. Drag the slider left/right to zoom out/in, 
respectively.
	
✓	Resize Windows to Fit: When you select the check box, the zoom resizes 
the window to the size of the image or the maximum size of the window.
	
✓	Zoom All Windows: If you have multiple photos open in the Image win­
dow, all photos are zoomed together when you zoom views.
	
✓	Actual Pixels: The ratio is reported in this text box. When the photo is 
shown at 100 percent size, the ratio reads 1:1. The ratio changes as you 
change zoom views.
	
✓	Fit Screen: Zooms the current window to the screen size.
	
✓	Fill Screen: Click this button to zoom the image to the largest size that 
fits within the workspace.
	
✓	Print Size: Click this button, and the photo zooms to the size that the 
file will be when it’s printed.
Moving with the Hand tool
	
	 When you zoom in to a size larger than the Image window can accommo­
date, scroll bars appear on the bottom and right sides of the photo. You can 
click and drag scroll bars to see more of the image area, or you can use the 
Hand tool to drag the image around the Image window.
While working with other tools from the Tools panel, you can temporarily 
access the Hand tool by pressing the spacebar. Press the spacebar and drag 
the image; then release the spacebar to return to the last tool selected in the 
Tools panel.
	
If you’re typing text on an image, you can’t use the spacebar to temporarily 
access the Hand tool. To move the Image window when you’re typing text, 
click the Hand tool in the Tools panel and move the photo. Click the Type tool 
in the Tools panel, click in the text block you started, and continue typing.
Cruising with the Navigator panel
The Navigator panel is a handy tool to keep open when you need to zoom in 
and out of a photo while editing images. It allows you to zoom on a particu­
lar part of a photo while viewing a thumbnail preview of the entire image in 
the Navigator. You can do all your zooming in this panel — and you can keep 
it open during your editing session!

64
Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
To open the Navigator panel, choose Window➪Navigator. The panel opens 
in a floating window, as shown in Figure 3-6.
At the upper right adjacent to the slider, a readout displays the current 
zoom percentage. You can move the slider left to zoom out of a photo and 
right to zoom in on a photo. In the center of the panel, you see a view dis­
playing the entire image and a red rectangle displaying the area correspond­
ing to the zoom view in the Image window.
The rectangle in the center of the panel can be moved around the Navigator 
panel just as you use the Hand tool to move around an image. The lower-
right corner is dragged out or in to size the panel larger or smaller, 
respectively.

Aligning Image Elements with Grids and Guides
	
You can quickly resize the zoom area in the Navigator panel by pressing the 
Ctrl key (⌘ on the Mac) and drawing a rectangle around the area you want 
to zoom.
Aligning Image Elements with Grids and Guides
Grids and guides are helpful when you’re adding text to photos, working 
with layers, or working with selections. You can align content to guidelines 
for precise alignment. In addition, you can display rulers along the left and 
top sides of a photo.
To view the grid and guidelines, choose View➪Grid. A nonprinting grid 
appears in your photo, like the one shown in Figure 3-7. To display rulers, 
choose View➪Rulers.
Figure 3-7: To show a grid and rulers, choose the appropriate options 
from the View menu.
To snap layers and objects to the grid and guides, choose View➪Snap To. 
From the submenu, you can choose Guides and Grid. When the objects in 
your image are dragged, selected, or moved, they snap to the items you’ve 
selected on the Snap To submenu.

Using the Info Panel
Using the Info Panel
The Info panel provides some feedback related to the cursor position and 
color information as you move the cursor around a photo. In addition, you 
can quickly examine the file size and other document information in the 
panel.
To open the Info panel, choose Window➪Info. By default the panel is docked 
with the other More panels. You can make it a floating panel by dragging the 
Info tab away from the docked position, as shown in Figure 3-8.
Click the icon in the upper-right cor­
ner of the panel to open the Options 
menu, shown in Figure 3-9. Choose 
Panel Options from the menu, and 
the Info Panel Options dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 3-10. 
Here, you can choose what kind of 
information appears in the panel.
The options you have available in 
the dialog box are
	
✓	First Color Readout: From the 
drop-down list, you can choose 
from Grayscale, RGB Color (the 
default), Web Color, and HSB 
(hue, saturation, and bright­
ness) Color. The choice you 
make from the menu displays 
the values in the upper-left 
quadrant (first readout) of the 
Info panel. See Book III, 
Chapter 3, for an explanation 
of color modes, such as 
Grayscale, RGB, and so on.
	
✓	Second Color Readout: The 
same choices appear from the 
drop-down list as you find for 
First Color Readout. These val­
ues are displayed in the upper-
right quadrant (second readout) 
of the Info panel.

­Preferences

✓	Choosing Organizer preferences
T

he Photoshop Elements program accommodates a wide range of pho­
tographers and artists who have a wide range of needs. Not every indi­
vidual who works in the program is likely to work the same way or use the 
same tools consistently. When you think of all the creative options you have 
for editing photos and then consider your hardware advantages and limita­
tions, you can begin to design a personal working environment.
Elements understands a user’s need to tailor the program to fit specific needs. 
That’s why it provides you with a set of preferences that enable you to cus­
tomize your personal work environment for the way you use Elements.
Understanding Preferences
A preference setting is an adjustment in the 
Preferences dialog box that has an effect on edits 
you make to pictures, on the behavior of tools and 
menus, and on the controls that affect Elements.
When you make a choice in a Preferences dialog 
box, the new setting takes effect after the adjust­
ment is made, and it remains intact until you make a 
change in the Preferences dialog box. Most prefer­
ences adjustments you make are dynamic: The change 
in a setting takes place immediately after you click OK in 
the dialog box. In some cases, preference settings are not 
dynamic: You must quit Photoshop Elements and relaunch the 
program for the new setting to take effect.
Preferences are adjusted separately in different dialog boxes for the Editors 
and in another dialog box for the Organizer. In the remainder of this chapter, 
we walk you through the preferences options you’ll likely want to customize 
to save you time and effort as you use Elements.

Setting the Photo Editor Preferences
Setting the Photo Editor Preferences
Preferences are all contained in the nine panes of the Preferences dialog 
box. By default, when you open the Photo Editor and open the Preferences 
dialog box, the opening pane is the General pane. 
	
To open the Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences➪General 
(Adobe Photoshop Elements Editor➪Preferences➪General on the Mac). 
Alternatively, press Ctrl+K (⌘+K on the Mac). Using either method opens 
the Preferences dialog box to the General pane, as shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1: The General pane in the Preferences dialog box.
Figure 4-1 shows items that are common to all preference panes. Here’s a 
quick introduction to these items and how they work:
	
✓	Panes list: In the Preferences dialog box, Elements lists all the different 
panes on the left. Click an item in the list to open the respective pane on 
the right side of the dialog box. 
	
✓	OK: Click OK to accept any changes made in any pane and to close the 
Preferences dialog box.
	
✓	Cancel: Click Cancel to return to the settings that were in effect when 
you opened a pane. If you hold down the Alt key (Option on the Mac), 
the Cancel button changes to Reset, and clicking that button performs 
the same action as clicking the Reset button.
	
✓	Reset: If you change any settings, click OK to dismiss the dialog box. If 
you make a change before dismissing the dialog box but then change 
your mind, just click Reset. This action restores the settings that were in 
effect when you opened the Preferences dialog box.

✓	Prev: Switch to the previous pane.
	
✓	Next: Switch to the next pane. You can also press the Ctrl+1 through 
Ctrl+9 keys (⌘+1 through ⌘+9 keys on the Mac) to jump to another 
pane.
Setting General preferences
The first pane you see when you open the Preferences dialog box is General 
preferences. (Refer to Figure 4-1.) In the General preferences pane on the 
right, you see drop-down lists and check boxes that relate to a variety of tool 
behaviors and the Elements user interface. The items in this pane (starting 
at the top) are
	
✓	Color Picker: From the menu list, you can choose the Adobe Color 
Picker or your system color picker.
	
✓	Step Back/Fwd: The default keyboard shortcut for stepping back (that 
is, undoing an edit) is Ctrl+Z (⌘+Z). To step forward (redo an edit), the 
default is Ctrl+Y (⌘+Y). You can change the shortcuts by selecting other 
options from the drop-down list.
	
✓	Show Tool Tips: Select this check box to show tooltips.
	
✓	Use Shift Key for Tool Switch: As we introduce in Chapter 2 of this mini­
book, you can press a key (such as the M key) to activate a tool (such as 
the Rectangular Marquee tool). Press M again, and you select the 
Elliptical Marquee tool. If this check box is selected, you change the 
default behavior so that you have to press Shift+a letter to switch tools.
	
✓	Select Move Tool after Committing Text: In Elements, committing text 
refers to clicking the green check mark icon that appears after you type 
some text with the Text tool. Clicking the green check mark tells 
Elements that you’re ready to create that text on a new type layer. As 
you work in the Photo Editor, notice what you tend to do after you com­
mit text: Do you keep editing your text with the Text tool or adjusting 
the placement of the text with the Move tool? Then you can set this pref­
erence accordingly to reflect the way you work.
	
✓	Zoom with Scroll Wheel: Select this check box if you have a mouse with 
a scroll wheel and want to zoom in and out when rotating the wheel.
	
✓	Allow Floating Documents in Expert Mode: By default, open photos in 
the image window appear as a row of tabs with filenames and Close but­
tons at the top of the window. You can choose to view documents in a 
more traditional Elements view in which multiple images appear as float­
ing windows, and you can arrange the photos within the image window. 
When you select this check box and return to the Editor, click the 
Layout icon to open a drop-down menu and select the Float All Windows 
option. For more information on using the Layout drop-down menu, see 
Chapter 1 of this minibook.

72
Setting the Photo Editor Preferences
	
✓	Enable Soft Notifications: Soft notifications are reminders that appear in 
pop-up windows when you may be processing an event. If you want to 
hide these notifications, deselect the check box.
	
✓	Enable Floating Document Window Docking: When windows are float­
ing, you can dock them together across the top of the image window 
where the files appear as tabs. Select this box to permit floating win­
dows to dock.
	
✓	Reset Preferences on Next Launch: Resets preferences to defaults when 
you relaunch the program.
	
✓	Reset All Warning Dialogs: A warning dialog box often contains check 
boxes that, if selected, let you dismiss the dialog box, safe in the knowl­
edge that you never again have to bother with that particular one. If, 
however, you change your mind and want any warning dialog boxes that 
you’ve hidden to pop up again, click this button to reset all the dialog 
boxes to the default setting.
Setting Saving Files preferences
The Saving Files preferences, shown in Figure 4-2, relate to options available 
for saving files. The available settings are
Figure 4-2: The Saving Files preferences.
	
✓	On First Save: From this drop-down menu, you can select Always Ask, 
Ask If Original, or Save over Current File. These options apply to the first 
time you edit a photo. On the Mac, you have similar options, though the 
option names vary a bit.
	
✓	Image Previews: Image previews show you thumbnail previews of images 
when viewing photos on your desktop. Adding a preview increases its file

size. You can choose Never Save, Always Save, or Ask When Saving. On 
the Mac you don’t need to save previews because OS X automatically cre­
ates them for you and you also have an assortment of check boxes that 
offer additional choices.
	
✓	File Extension: In Windows, you can tell Elements to put filename exten­
sions in uppercase or lowercase. On the Mac, you find an Append File 
Extension setting with choices for Always, Never, and Ask When Saving, 
and a Use Lower Case check box.
	
✓	Save as to Original Folder: When this box is selected, the Save As dialog 
box defaults to the folder where the original file is stored.
	
✓	Ignore Camera Data (EXIF) Profiles: EXIF data is information that most 
digital cameras store each time a photo is taken. The data stored depends 
on the camera and may include the camera make and model; date and 
time the image was taken; and even camera settings such as exposure, 
f-stop, ISO speed, and so on that you can use to compare photos taken 
with different settings. When this check box is selected, Elements adds 
camera data for each photo as metadata. Or, you can deselect the box to 
discard the EXIF data.
	
✓	Maximize PSD File Compatibility: When you save files from Elements, 
you can save in a format that’s compatible with Adobe Photoshop. For 
larger files, you may want to eliminate the compatibility to reduce the 
overall file size. Book III, Chapter 3, explains how saving works in differ­
ent file formats — and the file formats you can choose from.
	
✓	Recent File List Contains XX Files: The File➪Open Recently Edited File 
submenu lists ten files by default. You can reduce the number of files 
appearing in the list (to as low as 0) or increase the number (to a maxi­
mum of 30 files).
Setting Performance preferences
Check out the Performance preferences pane, shown in Figure 4-3, for history 
states and memory settings, such as scratch disk settings. (See the nearby 
“What’s a scratch disk?” sidebar in this chapter for more on scratch disks.)
The options in the Performance preferences pane are
	
✓	Let Photoshop Elements Use: This item specifies the amount of memory 
allocated to Elements. You can type values in the text box to change the 
memory allocation. If you find that Elements is running slowly, check 
how much RAM is allocated to Elements here and increase the amount 
if you have memory to spare. For minimum system requirements see 
Book I, Chapter 1.

74
Setting the Photo Editor Preferences
Figure 4-3: The Performance preferences pane.
	
✓	History States: You can undo edits as many as 50 times back, as defined 
in the History States text box by default. You can change this value to 
increase or reduce the number of times. The more you add to the text 
box, the more memory is required in Elements.
	
✓	Cache Levels: Some operations you perform are cached in memory so 
that you can quickly access them again. You can edit the text box to 
increase or decrease the cache levels.
	
✓	Scratch Disks: If you have additional internal or external hard drives 
attached to your computer, you can extend the scratch disk space to 
external drives.
	
	Don’t use USB 1.1 external hard drives or other drives that have connec­
tions slower than USB 2.0, USB 3.0, FireWire, or Thunderbolt. Using 
slower drives slows the performance of Elements.
What’s a scratch disk?
Assume that you have 100 megabytes (MB) of 
free RAM (your internal computer memory) and 
you want to work on a picture that consumes 
200MB of hard drive space. Elements needs to 
load all 200MB of the file into RAM. Therefore, 
you need an auxiliary source of RAM to work 
on the image; Elements uses your hard drive. 
When a hard drive is used as an extension of 
RAM, this source is a scratch disk.
If you have more than one hard drive connect­
ed to your computer, you can instruct Elements 
to use all hard drives, and you can select the 
order of the hard drives that Elements uses for 
your extension of RAM. All disks and media 
sources appear in a list as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

75
Book I 
Chapter 4
Setting Your 
­Preferences
Setting the Photo Editor Preferences
	
If you have an opportunity to find an affordable USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt 
device, by all means use it; you’ll notice great speed improvements when 
copying files and when scratch disks are necessary. Note that you also need 
a USB 3.0 controller card or Thunderbolt support. USB 3.0 is also backward 
compatible, so when you outfit your computer with a USB 3.0 controller card 
and a USB 3.0 storage device, you can also use all your USB 2.0 devices (cam­
eras, storage devices, and media cards, for example).
Setting Display & Cursors preferences
The Display & Cursors preferences are shown in Figure 4-4. These choices 
offer options for how certain tool cursors are displayed and how to view the 
Crop tool when you’re cropping images.
Figure 4-4: The Display & Cursors preferences.
Your Display & Cursors preferences choices are
	
✓	Painting Cursors: Your choices include
	
•	 Standard: Shows a tool icon, such as the Lasso tool or the Brush tool, 
for when you edit an image.
	
•	 Precise: Changes the tool cursor to a crosshair for precise markings.
	
•	 Normal Brush Tip: Displays a 50 percent tip on a brush for the cursor 
shape.
	
•	 Full Size Brush Tip: Shows the tool cursor at the full size of a brush tip.
	
•	 Show Crosshair in Brush Tip: Shows the tool cursor with a crosshair 
inside the tip.
	
✓	Other Cursors: Choose Standard to display an icon of the tool being 
used or select Precise to display a crosshair for a more precise detail 
image of the cursor.

76
Setting the Photo Editor Preferences
	
✓	Crop Tool settings: The following Crop Tool options are found in this 
section:
	
•	 Use Shield: If you select this option and then use the Crop tool, the 
inside area defining the crop region shows the photo at the normal 
appearance, and the area outside the crop region appears with a 
shield, making it easier to see areas that will be eliminated and 
areas that will be retained when the photo is cropped.
	
•	 Shield Color: You can change the color of the Crop tool shield 
by making choices in the drop-down color palette.
	
•	 Opacity: The shield is semitransparent by default. You can 
change the opacity of the shield to make it more opaque or 
transparent by editing the text box or choosing options from 
the drop-down list.
Setting Transparency preferences
The Transparency preferences are shown in Figure 4-5. Using these settings 
requires an understanding of how Elements represents transparency. Imagine 
painting a portrait on a piece of clear acetate. The area you paint is opaque, 
and the area surrounding the portrait is transparent — invisible, in other 
words. To display transparency in Elements, you need a method to make 
transparent areas visible. To accomplish that task, open the Transparency 
preferences and make choices for displaying transparency in your 2D 
Elements environment. Transparency becomes especially important when 
you start working with layers, which are the subject of Book VI.
Figure 4-5: The Transparency preferences.

77

Setting Your 
­Preferences
Setting the Photo Editor Preferences
The Transparency preferences settings available to you include
	
✓	Grid Size: The grid you see in the image in the upper-right corner of the 
Transparency preferences pane displays the default settings for the grid 
size and color. You can change the grid size to None, Small, Medium, or 
Large.
	
✓	Grid Colors: From the drop-down menu, you can choose from preset 
colors to display the transparency.
	
✓	First transparency background color: Click the swatch if you want to 
make a custom color choice for one set of the pattern squares.
	
✓	Second transparency background color: Click the second color swatch if 
you’d like to choose a custom color for the second set of pattern squares.
	
Any changes you make in the Transparency settings are dynamically 
updated in the large preview in the upper right.
Setting Units & Rulers preferences
The Units & Rulers preferences, shown in Figure 4-6, let you specify settings 
for ruler units, column guides, and document preset resolutions.
Figure 4-6: The Units & Rulers preferences.
Your Units & Rulers preferences choices are
	
✓	Rulers: From the drop-down list, choose the unit of measure you want to 
use for your display.
	
✓	Type: From the drop-down list, choose the default units you want to use 
when creating text.
	
✓	Print Sizes: From the drop-down list, choose the units you want to work 
with when printing photos.

78
Setting the Photo Editor Preferences
	
✓	Photo Project Units: You can define separate units of measurements for 
projects and choose either inches or mm/cm.
	
✓	Print Resolution: When you create a new document, the print resolution 
default is determined by this setting.
	
✓	Screen Resolution: A new document’s screen resolution is determined 
by this setting.
Setting Guides & Grid preferences
The Guides & Grid preferences, shown in Figure 4-7, offer options for guide 
colors and styles and for gridline color, divisions, and subdivisions. A grid 
shows you nonprinting horizontal and vertical lines. You use a grid to align 
objects and type and other elements. You can snap items to the gridlines to 
make object alignment much easier.
Your choices for Guides & Grid preferences are
	
✓	Color: Guides and grids are displayed with colored lines. You can 
change the line color by choosing Custom or a preset color from the 
drop-down menu.
	
✓	Style: Guides and gridlines can be regular lines, dashed lines, or dots. 
Make your choice by choosing an option from the drop-down menu.
	
✓	Gridline Every XX Inches: You can space major gridline divisions 
according to a value you type in the text box. The default is inches, but 
you can change the units to pixels, centimeters, millimeters, points, 
picas, or percent in the drop-down menu to the right.
	
✓	Subdivisions: Between each major subdivision, you can define the num­
ber of subdivision lines by typing a value in the text box.
Setting Plug-Ins preferences
The Plug-Ins preferences pane doesn’t look like much. It contains a single 
option for selecting an additional plug-ins folder for storing third-party utili­
ties to work with Elements. If you have third-party utilities, though, this 
option is a great help. Just select the check box and click the Choose button 
to locate another folder for storing your third-party plug-ins.
Setting Adobe Partner Services preferences
These options enable you to check for new services and reset account ser­
vices, as shown in Figure 4-8. For more options, see the upcoming section for 
the related Organizer preferences.

To access your preferences for the Organizer, choose Edit➪Preferences or 
press Ctrl+K (Adobe Elements 12 Organizer➪Preferences or ⌘+K on the 
Mac). 
Initially, you may be confused because both the Photo Editor and the 
Organizer display your preference options in a dialog box named 
Preferences. However, a quick glance at the Preferences dialog box for the 
Organizer, shown in Figure 4-10, shows you a set of choices that are much 
different from those you see when you access preferences in the Photo 
Editor.

Setting Camera or Card Reader preferences
The Camera or Card Reader preferences, shown in Figure 4-13, determine 
how you acquire images from digital cameras and media storage cards. Your 
computer may have a built-in card reader in which you can insert a media 
card, such as CompactFlash or Smart Media, or a USB card reader that sup­
ports a media card. You may have a cable that connects from your camera 
to a USB port on your computer. You use these preference options with 
media cards, camera connections, and download options.
	
Before you set these preferences, check out Book II, which explains how the 
features that are referenced in these preference options work. For example, 
you’ll have a better idea of how you’d like image downloads and keyword 
tags to work after you’ve actually tried out these features.
The Camera or Card Reader preferences options are

✓	Email Client: Choose the e-mail program you want to use from the 
options in the drop-down list. The program has to be installed on your 
computer; web-based e-mail services (such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, or 
AOL) don’t connect to Elements via this preferences option.
	
✓	Write Email Captions to Catalog (Windows): When using Photo Mail (a 
feature for e-mailing photos right from the Elements Organizer) to e-mail 
images, you can write the captions in the e-mail message, and the cap­
tions appear in the Organizer.

Setting Adobe Revel preferences
The last item in the list on the left in the Organizer preferences is Adobe 
Revel.
	
We cover Adobe Revel thoroughly in Book IX, Chapter 3. For now, realize 
that you have new preference options in Elements 12 for setting preferences 
that pertain to using Adobe Revel.
Most important is the Sync checkbox and the Revel Agent On/Off switch you 
see in Figure 4-19. When Sync is checked and the Revel Agent is on, your 
photos saved to Adobe Revel are synced with your Organizer Media 
Browser. When you update photos by editing them, the photos are automati­
cally added to your online Revel account.
Also, be aware that, when Sync is active and Revel Agent is on, the Mobile 
Albums item in the Import panel disappears. When these items are not active, 
Mobile Albums reappear, and you can create albums by downloading photos 
from your Revel account.
For now, just understand what happens when you enable/disable these 
items in the Preferences. In Book IX, Chapter 3, we explain how to work with 
Adobe Revel and sync your photos.

Chapter 1: Gathering Your 
­Image Files
In This Chapter
✓	Organizing your hard drive
✓	Acquiring photos from cameras, phones, scanners, and more
✓	Importing photos into the Organizer
✓	Backing up your photos and edits
A

fter you install Photoshop Elements, the first thing you want to do is 
open some photos. It stands to reason that, before you can jump into 
all the editing opportunities you have with the program, you need to have 
the image files ready to use, whether those photos are digital camera pho­
tos still on a memory card or files copied to your computer. You may also 
have a photo print you want to scan or photos you took on your cellphone.
Regardless of where you have photos stored, you want to get them into 
Elements and start working on them. In this chapter, we talk about 
getting your files onto your computer and imported into the 
Organizer. After you have your files loaded in the 
Organizer, you have a number of options for viewing, 
searching, and organizing photos in the Organizer, 
which we discuss in Chapters 2 and 3 of this mini­
book. (If you want to bypass the robust image-
tagging and organization features that the Organizer 
offers and jump right into editing in the Photo 
Editor, skip to Book III.) You also find out about 
your options for backing up your images after you 
have them on your hard drive.
Organizing Image Files 
on Your Hard Drive
Although the Photoshop Elements Organizer is a marvelous tool for manag­
ing photos, you’ll still get the best results from Elements if you first have a 
system for storing photos on your hard drive.

94
Organizing Image Files on Your Hard Drive 
	
We recommend creating folders in a hierarchical order with folder names 
that represent logical divisions for where and when photos were taken. It’s 
your call for how you want to develop the hierarchy. You might want to cre­
ate separate folders for each year and inside those folders divide the images 
into other folders for people, family, business, events, occasions, and so on. 
How you organize the images is a personal choice. Just be certain that you 
keep the organization consistent and logical for your personal needs.
Dedicating a drive to just photos
If your photography is important to you and you have substantial numbers 
of images stored on a hard drive, you may want to look at acquiring a dedi­
cated hard drive just for your photos. With prices dropping on large drives 
of 1⁄2 to 2 terabytes, you can pick up an additional drive and attach the drive 
to your computer. Use the drive for storing your photos only and keep all 
other data away from the drive.
Photoshop Elements offers you some backup options to store images in the 
cloud (a remote server accessible via the Internet) on Adobe Revel. But the 
free service is limited to 50 image uploads a month. These days, you can 
shoot 2GB of photos in a single photo shoot. All the free services you find 
aren’t going to provide you with enough storage space if you’re a serious 
photographer.
For backup purposes, it might be best to purchase a second drive for your 
photos. A 1-terabyte drive will serve you well for media storage and backup.
See the section “Protecting Your Assets,” later in this chapter, for more 
details about backing up.
Viewing your hard drive’s folder 
structure in the Organizer
When you get into the Organizer, you can use the marvelous viewing option 
for finding photos on a hard drive. As a matter of fact, your folder organiza­
tion on your hard drive has become the default view in Elements 12. You see 
an Import panel and a list of folders where your photos are stored, as shown 
in Figure 1-1.
For a more traditional Explorer/Finder type appearance, you can change the 
view by clicking the folder tree icon in the Import panel (the icon is indi­
cated by a red box in Figure 1-1). The view changes to a hierarchical view, as 
shown in Figure 1-2. To return to the original folder view, click the folder tree 
icon again. (It moves to the upper-right corner in the Import panel when the 
Explorer/Finder-style view is displayed.)

Chapter 1
Gathering Your 
Image Files
Transferring Images to Your Computer
Don’t worry now about how to use the Folder views and how to navigate 
folders. We cover all that and more in Chapter 2 of this minibook. For now, 
think about how you want your folders on your hard drive to be organized 
and create a structure that you can understand so that you can easily copy 
photos to the newly created folders.
Transferring Images to Your Computer
In the early days of Adobe Photoshop, circa early ’90s and later when 
Photoshop Elements arrived, most photos were acquired from scanned 
prints, from scanned slides, from some point-and-shoot cameras, and occa­
sionally from images stored on CDs. These days, you can add volumes of 
photos, not only from scanned images and CD/DVDs but also from digital 
cameras, cellphones, and tablets. The following sections walk you through 
the options that Elements and your computer make available to you.
Getting images from your camera
When you work with Elements, you most frequently use one of two work­
spaces, as we describe in Book I, Chapter 1: the Organizer or the Photo 
Editor. The Organizer is frequently your first stop for editing photos. Unless 
Figure 1-1: The Folder view in 
the Organizer.
Figure 1-2: The Hierarchical 
Folder view in the Organizer.

96
Transferring Images to Your Computer
you have an image you want to edit in the Photo Editor and, therefore, open 
it immediately in the Photo Editor, your typical first step is to look over a 
collection of photos you’ve taken with a digital camera or imported using a 
scanner. Therefore, when we talk about getting images from your camera, 
we’re pointing you to the Elements Organizer.
To load images from your camera in the Organizer window, you open the 
Organizer and use a cable connected to your camera and your computer. 
Most digital cameras come with USB cables that can connect to both camera 
and computer.
	
We don’t, however, recommend uploading photos directly from your camera. 
If the camera battery is low, Elements stops the upload when the connection 
is lost. The best way to copy files to your computer is via a card reader. We 
explain how this process works in the next section. (If you don’t have a 
reader, however, the process for a camera or reader is basically the same.)
	
If your camera is a mobile device instead of a digital camera with a memory 
card, you can easily load those images into the Elements Organizer, too. See 
the upcoming section, “Grabbing photos from mobile devices” for details.
Getting images from your card reader
Almost all cameras use memory cards to store photos. After shooting some 
photos, you can remove the memory card itself from the camera and place it 
in a card reader hooked up to your computer or in a direct slot on your com­
puter if one exists.
Both methods — a direct hookup or a connection to a card reader — afford 
you an opportunity to load your photos into the Elements Organizer. To add 
photos to the Organizer from a card reader, do the following:
	
1.	 Hook up a card reader via a cable; alternatively, if you have a built-in 
reader on your computer, you can insert the memory card into the 
slot for the built-in reader.
	
	 Use the cable supported by your card reader. When you connect your 
camera or card reader, the AutoPlay Wizard opens on a Windows PC or 
iPhoto opens on a Mac.
	
2.	 Cancel the AutoPlay Wizard (Windows). If iPhoto or Image Capture 
opens on the Mac, close the application.
	
	 Click Cancel in the wizard or choose iPhoto➪Quit to proceed.
	
	 For Mac users, you can set Preferences in iPhoto to prevent iPhoto from 
being launched when you connect a camera or card reader. Open iPhoto 
and choose iPhoto➪Preferences. On the General tab, select No 
Application from the Connecting Camera Opens pop-up menu. Click

the Advanced tab and deselect the Importing Item: Copy Items to iPhoto 
Library check box.
	
3.	 Open the Organizer.
	
	 Launch Photoshop Elements and click the Organizer button on the 
Welcome screen.
	
4.	 In the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos and Video➪From Camera or 
Card Reader or press Ctrl+G (⌘+G on the Mac).
	
	 The Elements Organizer – Photo Downloader Wizard appears. At the top 
of the wizard, you find a drop-down list that displays your hard drive 
and a source, such as a camera or card reader attached to your 
computer.
	
5.	 In Windows, select a media source from the Get Photos from drop-
down list, as shown in Figure 1-3. On the Mac, choose a source drive 
from the Devices list in the sidebar.

6.	 Click the Browse button in the Location area and locate a folder 
where you want to copy your photos.
	
	 If you followed our advice and created folders on a hard drive as we 
explained in the section “Organizing Image Files on Your Hard Drive,” 
earlier in this chapter, locate the folder where you want to copy the 
files. If you need a new folder, you can make a new folder in the Browse 
dialog box.
	
	 After you choose a camera or card reader, the Downloader appears with 
the Get Media button active.
	
7.	 Click the Get Media button and leave the other settings at their 
defaults.
	
8.	 Wait for the Downloader to complete downloading all images before 
continuing.
	
	 A progress bar displays the download progress. If you have many pho­
tos on your memory card, it may take a little time to complete the down­
load. Be patient and wait for the download to finish.
	
	 A dialog box opens when the download is complete. The download 
doesn’t copy images to the Organizer.
	
9.	 To import the copied images into the Organizer, click OK.
	
10.	 View the results.
	
	 After the photos have been imported in the Organizer, you see thumb­
nail images for all the photos acquired from the memory card.
After the photos are added to the Organizer, you can edit the images in the 
Editor’s Expert or Quick mode. Book III helps you with opening images in the 
Editor.
	
Each time you import photos in the Organizer, only the last import is visible 
as thumbnails. If you have other photos you previously imported and you 
want to see both the new import and the other files in the Organizer, click 
the Show All button at the top of the window.
Grabbing photos from mobile devices
If you’re among the increasing numbers of people pulling a cellphone from 
your pocket to capture a moment or taking pictures with a tablet, this sec­
tion is for you. Cellphones and tablets offer various options for transferring 
media from the handheld device to your computer. You typically have the 
following options:
	
✓	USB: Devices that support USB connections enable you to connect a 
cable through a USB port to your phone and your computer. With some 
devices, the computer sees the phone as an external media source, so 

99
Book II 
Chapter 1
Gathering Your 
Image Files
Transferring Images to Your Computer
you can drag photos from the device to a folder on your computer. In 
the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and 
Folders. Or you can choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Camera 
or Card Reader to load the files in an Organizer catalog from a folder on 
your hard drive or directly from the media storage source. See the pre­
ceding section for details about using these Organizer commands.
	
✓	Bluetooth: Many handheld devices support Bluetooth, a type of wireless 
connection. A Bluetooth support application makes a device discover­
able, enabling you to copy photos from your device to a folder on your 
computer. Both Windows and the Macintosh operating systems support 
Bluetooth natively.
	
✓	E-mail: Although not a connection, e-mailing photos is available on many 
devices and used often for sharing photos. Simply e-mail the photo to 
yourself from your device. Then log in to your e-mail program on your 
computer and download the image attachment.
The iPhone, iPad, and many Android 
devices use both USB connections 
and Bluetooth. In Figure 1-4, we 
hooked up a Samsung Galaxy Tab. 
After we mounted the device, we 
opened the Elements Organizer 
and chose File➪Get Photos and 
Videos➪From Camera or Card 
Reader. The Photo Downloader rec­
ognizes both the internal memory 
and the memory card. On iPhone 
and iPad, you have only a single 
storage device: the internal memory 
card.
On the Macintosh, you can use the 
Apple iPhoto software to download 
photos and videos from iPhone or 
iPad.
Scanning images
Scanners connect through the same ports as cameras and card readers. 
Most of today’s scanners use either USB or FireWire. Almost all low-end 
scanners sold now are USB devices.
Even the lowest-end scanners provide 16-bit scans that help you get a little 
more data in the shadows and highlights. Like a digital camera, a scanner’s 
price is normally in proportion to its quality.

device is attached to your computer.

Preparing before you scan
Just as you’d clean a lens on a digital camera and set various menu selec­
tions before clicking the shutter button, you should prepare a few things 
ahead of time before scanning:
	
✓	Connect the scanner properly. Make sure that you have all connections 
made to your computer according to the user manual that came with 
your scanner. If you just purchased a scanner, check for any lock bolts 
or tape and remove them according to the instructions.
	
✓	Clean the scanner platen. Use a lint-free cloth and some glass cleaner 
(applied to the cloth) to remove all dust and particles on the glass. The 
more dust particles you remove, the easier it is to edit your image in 
Elements.
	
✓	Clean the source material. Be certain that the print or film you want to 
scan is free of dust and spots.
	
	If you have old negatives that are dirty or that have water spots or debris 
that you can’t remove with a cloth and film cleaner, soak the film in photo 
flo (a liquid you can purchase at a photo retailer). Be certain that your 
hands are clean and then run the filmstrip between two fingers to remove 
the excess liquid. Turn on your shower full force with hot water only and 
hang film nearby to dry it. Remove the film when it’s dry, and you should 
see a surprisingly clean filmstrip compared to your soiled original.
	
✓	Get to know your scanner software. When you scan in Elements, the 
software supplied with your scanner takes charge, and you use the 
options in this software before the image scan finally drops into an 
Elements Image window.
	
✓	Prepare the artwork. If you plan on scanning pages in a book or pam­
phlet, remove the pages or try to make photocopies so that the piece 
you scan lies flat on the scanner platen. Make sure that you observe 
copyright laws if you’re scanning printed works. For faxes and photo­
copies, try to improve originals by recopying them on a photocopier by 
using darker settings.
	
✓	Find the scanner’s sweet spot. Every scanner has an area where you 
can acquire the best scans. This area is often called the sweet spot. To 
find the scanner’s sweet spot, scan a blank piece of paper. The sweet 
spot is the brightest area on the resultant scan. Other areas should be 
darker. The sweet spot is most often in the upper-left quadrant, the 
lower-right quadrant, or the middle of the page. Note the area and place 
your source material within this area when scanning pictures.
Understanding image requirements
All scanning software provides you with options for determining resolution 
and color mode before you start a new scan. You should decide what output 
you intend to use and scan originals at target resolutions designed to accom­
modate a given output. Here are some examples:

101
Book II 
Chapter 1
Gathering Your 
Image Files
Transferring Images to Your Computer
	
✓	Scan the artwork or photo at the size and resolution for the final out­
put. If you have a 3-x-5 photo that needs to be 1.5 x 2.5 inches on a web 
page, scan the original with a 50-percent reduction in size at 72 ppi (pix­
els per inch). (See Book III, Chapter 2, for information about resizing 
images.)
	
✓	Size images with the scanner software. If you have a 4-x-6 photo that 
needs to be output for prepress and commercial printing at 8 x 12 
inches, scan the photo at 4 x 6 inches at 600 ppi (enough to size to 200 
percent for a 300-dpi [dots per inch] image).
	
✓	Scan properly for line art. Line art is 1-bit black and white only — some­
thing like a black-and-white illustration. When you print line art on laser 
printers or prepare files for commercial printing, the line-art resolution 
should match the device resolution. For example, printing to a 600-dpi 
laser printer requires 600 ppi for a 1-bit line-art image. When you’re 
printing to an image setter at a print shop, or if it’s going directly to 
plate or press, the resolution should be 1200 dpi.
	
✓	Scan grayscale images in color. In some cases, it doesn’t matter, but 
with some images and scanners, you can get better results by scanning 
in RGB (red, green, blue) color and converting to grayscale in Elements 
by using the Hue/Saturation dialog box or the Convert to Black and 
White dialog box, as we explain in Book III, Chapter 3.
	
✓	Scan in high bit depths. If your scanner is capable of scanning in 16 or 
32 bits, by all means, scan at the higher bit depths to capture the most 
data. See Book III, Chapter 2, for more information about working with 
higher-bit images.
Using scanner plug-ins
Generally, when you install your scanner software, a stand-alone application 
and a plug-in are installed to control the scanning process. Plug-ins are 
designed to work inside other software programs, such as Photoshop 
Elements. When you’re using the plug-in, you can stay right in Elements to 
do all your scanning. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 After installing a new scanner and the accompanying software, launch 
Elements and then open the Organizer by clicking the Organize but­
ton on the Welcome screen.
	
	 Macintosh users need to use a TWAIN plug-in. By default the plug-in is 
not available in Elements. In your Mac’s Application folder, open the 
Adobe Photoshop Elements 12 and then open the Support Files folder. 
Copy the Import Modules folder and paste it into the Plug-ins folder. 
Relaunch the Photo Editor and you find your scanner accessible in the 
File➪Import submenu.
	
2.	 From the Organizer, open the Preferences dialog box by pressing Ctrl+K.
	
3.	 Click Scanner in the left column and adjust the Scanner preferences, 
as we describe in Book I, Chapter 4.

102
Transferring Images to Your Computer
When the Preferences dialog box sees your scanner, you know that the con­
nection is properly set up and you’re ready to scan. Assuming that all your 
connections are properly set up, here’s how to complete your scan:
	
1.	 To open the scanner software from within Elements, choose File➪Get 
Photos and Videos➪From Scanner.
	
	 You must be in the Organizer window to access this menu command.
	
	 Elements may churn a bit, but eventually your scanner software appears 
atop the Organizer window, as shown in Figure 1-5. The window is the 
scanner software provided by your scanner manufacturer. (Your win­
dow looks different from the one in Figure 1-5 unless you use the same 
scanner we use.) Regardless of which software you use, you should have 
similar options for creating a preview; selecting resolution, color mode, 
and image size; scaling; and other options.
Figure 1-5: When you scan from within Elements, your scanner 
software loads on top of the Elements workspace.
	
2.	 Adjust the options according to your output requirements and the 
recommendations made by your scanner manufacturer.
	
3.	 When everything is ready to go, click the Scan button.
	
	 The final image drops into an Elements Image window.
If you’re a Macintosh user, save your scans and then acquire the scans either 
via iPhoto or choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders.

Transferring Images to Your Computer
Scanning many photos at a time
If you have several photos to scan, 
you can lay them out on the scanner 
platen and perform a single scan 
to acquire all images in one pass. 
Arrange the photos to scan on the 
glass and set up all the options in the 
scanner window for your intended 
output. When you scan multiple 
images, they form a single scan, 
as you can see in Figure 1-6.
	
After you scan multiple images, 
Elements makes it easy for you to 
separate each image into its own 
image window, where you can save 
the images as separate files. Choose 
Image➪Divide Scanned Photos to 
make Elements magically open each 
image in a separate window, as 
shown in Figure 1-7, while the origi­
nal scan remains intact. See Book III 
for details about saving images after 
they’re divided.
Figure 1-7: After you choose Image➪Divide Scanned Photos, the scan is split into separate 
image windows.

one pass.

Importing Files from Your Hard Drive into the Organizer
Adding images from any media via your file system
Your computer’s file system (for the purposes outlined in this section) is the 
Windows Explorer or Mac Finder view, where you can make folders and 
copy files to folders. To get images from your storage media onto your com­
puter using your file system, you can copy files to folders from a card 
reader, CD/DVD, or some other device mounted on your computer and view 
the photos in the file system. Here are the steps to do so:
	
1.	 Make sure that the media is connected to your computer or loaded 
into your CD/DVD drive.
	
2.	 Cancel out of any autoplay wizards and go to Windows Explorer or 
the Finder.
	
3.	 Open the source media and drag files to target folders on your hard 
drive.
	
	 If you shoot an event such as a birthday party and you additionally 
shoot some nature photos, you may want the photos to be organized in 
separate folders. Organizing photos into separate folders may be easier 
using the file system. (See the section “Organizing Image Files on Your 
Hard Drive,” earlier in this chapter, for details.)
Importing Files from Your Hard 
Drive into the Organizer
After your image files are on your computer’s hard drive, you want to work 
with them in Elements. If you want to use the viewing, searching, and organiz­
ing capabilities of the Organizer, your first step is loading files copied to your 
hard drive into the Organizer. In the following sections, you find out how to 
choose certain files you want to import or how to set up a special folder called 
a Watch Folder that helps you import images into the Organizer automatically.
Searching for files
The last option you have on the Get Photos 
and Videos submenu in the Organizer is the By 
Searching item. Choose File➪Get Photos and 
Videos➪By Searching and a search dialog box 
opens. You can choose to search the media 
sources available from the Look In drop-down 
menu.
Searching is limited to searching for photos. 
You don’t have options for searching for file­
names or camera data. Most often, this option 
is the one you’ll typically use less than the 
other submenu choices.

Importing photos manually
When you want to choose specific files or a folder to import, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Organize your image files into folders and subfolders on your hard 
drive.
	
	 See the “Organizing Image Files on Your Hard Drive” section, earlier in 
this chapter.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders.
	
	 The Get Photos and Videos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 1-8.
	
3.	 Select images to import.
	
	 To import a folder full of images, select that folder to import all the 
images within it. If you nest folders, you can get files from a parent 
folder and all subfolders when you select the parent folder.

Importing Files from Your Hard Drive into the Organizer 
	
	 However, you only import one folder in the same level of your folder 
hierarchy at a time. So, if you want to import multiple folders at the 
same level, you have to repeat the steps here to import each folder’s 
images into the Organizer.
	
	 If you want to import all photos within a given folder but not any sub­
folders, click any file in the list and then press Ctrl+A (⌘+A on a Mac) to 
select all. 
	
	 Alternatively, you can click and Ctrl-click (⌘-click) to select files individ­
ually in a noncontiguous order or click and Shift-click to select photos in 
a contiguous order.
	
4.	 Specify your Fix Red Eyes and Photo Stacks options.
	
	 We recommend leaving the other options, such as fixing red-eye and 
suggesting photo stacks, at the defaults where the check boxes are dese­
lected. You have much better editing options in Elements, so don’t use 
the automated features in the Get Photos and Videos from Files and 
Folders dialog box.
	
5.	 Click the Get Media button.
	
	 Wait for Elements to complete the import process. Your photos appear 
in a new Organizer window.
	
When you import photos, only those photos you imported are shown as 
thumbnails in the Organizer. To see all photos you imported from previous 
sessions as well as the new import, click the Show All button at the top of 
the Media Browser window.
Setting Up Watch Folders
	
One easy way to get files into the Organizer window is to use Watch Folders. 
Watch Folders are folders that you can identify on your computer. Each time 
new photos are added to the Watch Folders, Elements prompts you to con­
firm adding the files from the folders to your Organizer Catalog.
To set up a Watch Folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer and choose File➪Watch Folders. 
	
	 The Watch Folders dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-9. By default, 
your Pictures folder on your hard drive is already identified as a Watch 
Folder.
	
2.	 To identify a new Watch Folder, click the Add button. 
	
3.	 In the Browse for Folder dialog box that opens, locate a folder or 
make a new folder for adding photos. Click OK when you’re done.

Importing Files from Your Hard Drive into the Organizer 
	
	 Each time you copy photos to 
any location shown in the Watch 
Folders dialog box, Elements 
sees the photos and either asks 
you whether you want to import 
them into your catalog or auto­
matically adds the files to a 
catalog.
	
4.	 Choose whether to be notified 
when Elements detects new 
files or to import new files 
automatically.
	
	 In the Watch Folders dialog box, 
you find radio button choices 
for either notifying you when 
new files are found in a Watch 
Folder or for Elements to auto­
matically import photos each 
time that new files are added to 
a Watch Folder. We recommend selecting the Notify Me radio button so 
that you’re always aware of when new files are added to your catalog.
	
5.	 Click OK to create your new Watch Folder.
The next time you copy photos to the watched folder and launch the 
Organizer, a dialog box opens, prompting you to confirm adding photos 
(assuming that you chose Notify Me in the Watch Folders dialog box). Follow 
these steps to decide whether you want to import the newly detected 
photos:
	
1.	 Click Yes in the dialog box shown in Figure 1-10.
	
	 The Add New Files from Watch Folder dialog box opens, where you find 
thumbnail previews for the new files found in a Watch Folder. By default, 
all the check boxes are selected, 
as shown in Figure 1-11.
	
2.	 Deselect any photos you don’t 
want to add. 
	
3.	 Click OK, and the files are 
added to your catalog.
	
When you add photos in the 
Organizer, only those photos you 
added appear in the Media Browser area of the Organizer. To see all photos, 
be sure to click the Show All button above the Media Browser.

Protecting Your Assets
At this point in your digital life, you probably have more data stored on com­
puters from photo and other media files than any other document types. 
Other media, such as text documents, layouts, and spreadsheets, can often 
be easily reproduced. However, photos, once lost, are gone forever. That’s 
why backing up your photos is important. If you take a lot of time to create 
and edit images and photos, you don’t want to lose that work either. 
We can save you aggravation right now before you spend any more time 
editing your photos in Elements. The following sections introduce you to a 
couple of backup options. You might choose one or more than one. We 
authors are so paranoid when we’re writing a book that we back up our 
chapters on multiple drives, CDs, and DVDs when we finish them. The stan­
dard rule is that if you spend sufficient time working on a project and it gets 
to the point at which redoing your work would be a major aggravation, it’s 
time to back up your files.

Backing up your catalog
When organizing your files, you want to back up the catalog file in case your 
catalog becomes corrupted. (You have a default catalog for all your images 
unless you create separate catalogs, as we explain in Chapter 2 of this 
minibook.)
Here’s how you can use Elements to create a backup of your data:
	
1.	 In Windows, choose File➪Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive to 
open the Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive Wizard (Windows) 
or Assistant (Mac). On the Macintosh, choose File➪Backup to Hard 
Drive.
	
	 This wizard has three panes (Window) or two panes (Mac) that Elements 
walks you through; it’s a pretty painless way to back up your files.
	
2.	 Choose a backup option.
	
	 The first pane in the Burn/Backup Wizard offers two options:
	
•	 Full Backup: Select this radio button to perform your first backup or 
when you’re writing files to a new media source.
	
•	 Incremental Backup: Use this option if you’ve already performed at 
least one backup and you want to update the backed-up files.
	
3.	 Click Next and select a target location for your backed-up files.
	
	 Active drives, including CD/DVD drives attached to your computer 
(Windows), appear in the Select Destination Drive list, as shown in 
Figure 1-12. Select a drive, and Elements automatically assesses the 
write speed and identifies a previous backup file if one was created. The 
wizard also displays the total size of the files you’ve chosen to copy. 
This information is helpful so that you know whether you need more 
than one CD or DVD to complete the backup.
	
4.	 If you intend to copy files to your hard drive or to another hard drive 
attached to your computer, click the Browse button and identify the 
path.
	
	 If you use a media source, such as a CD or DVD, Elements prompts you 
to insert a disc and readies the media for writing.
	
5.	 Click Done, and the backup commences.
	
	 Be certain to not interrupt the backup. It might take some time, so just let 
Elements work away until you’re notified that the backup is complete.

110

Figure 1-12: You can choose your destination backup media in the wizard.
Backing up photos and files (Windows)
With files stored all over your hard drive, manually copying files to a second 
hard drive, CD-ROM, or DVD would take quite a bit of time. Fortunately, 
Elements makes finding files to back up a breeze.
Choose File➪Make a CD/DVD and then, in the dialog box that opens, click 
Yes to confirm the action. The Make a CD/DVD dialog box opens. Select a 
hard drive or a CD/DVD drive, type a name for the backup folder, and click 
OK. Elements goes about copying all files shown in the Organizer window to 
your backup source.

Chapter 2: Viewing, Searching, 
and Sorting Images
In This Chapter
✓	Working with catalogs
✓	Locating and viewing images
✓	Searching image metadata, content, and more
✓	Hiding and stacking files
W

hen you add files to the Organizer, you have many options for view­
ing, searching, and sorting your images. As your photo collection 
grows over time, these tools can help you sift through your images to find 
ones that meet specific criteria, whether they are images associated with a 
certain location or images of a friend or family member through the years.
This chapter covers the many types of viewing and searching options you 
have when working in the Organizer. In Chapter 3 of this minibook, you find 
out how to add tags, create albums, and use other organization 
tools that often work hand in hand with the viewing and 
searching features we explain in this chapter.
Cataloging Files
When you add files in the Organizer, they’re con­
tained within a catalog. You can have a single cata­
log showing thumbnail images of your media or 
several catalogs that contain media organized 
according to the events, time frames, or other orga­
nizational criteria you want. If multiple users are 
working on the same computer, you can create sepa­
rate catalogs for each user.
In the following sections, you find out about the benefits of 
organizing images in separate catalogs and see how to create a 
new catalog, import an old catalog, and move from one catalog to another 
after setting up catalogs the way you want them.

112
Cataloging Files
Creating a new catalog
If you have lots of pictures — perhaps numbering in the hundreds or even 
thousands — you can still add each and every one of these photos to a sin­
gle catalog. However, doing so slows the performance in the Organizer and 
makes searching for photos a bit more difficult. A better option for dealing 
with large numbers of photos is to create separate catalogs.
You might have a number of photos that were taken at some event or special 
occasion and want to create a separate, new catalog to manage just those 
files. Here’s how you go about creating a new catalog:
	
1.	 In the Organizer, choose File➪Manage Catalogs.
	
	 The Catalog Manager opens, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: Choose File➪Manage Catalogs to open the Catalog Manager.
	
2.	 In the Catalogs section of the Catalog Manager, choose an accessibility 
level (Windows).
	
	 By default, your catalog is accessible to all users. If you have several log­
ons for different users, all users can access the catalog.
	
	 On the Macintosh, the catalog is always accessible to the current user. If 
multiple users access the same computer, the catalog files created by 
other users cannot be viewed by the current user. For multiple user 
access, you can use the default OSX Public folder, shared folders, or use 
an external hard drive for storing photos.

113
Book II

	 If you want to make the catalog accessible only to you and not to others 
logging on to your computer, select the Catalogs Accessible by the 
Current User radio button.
	
3.	 Choose a location.
	
	 If you don’t choose one of the first two radio buttons and you want to 
save the catalog to the folder of your choice, select the Custom Location 
radio button and click the Browse button to select a folder on your hard 
drive in which you want to store the catalog.
	
4.	 Click the New button in the upper-right corner of the Catalog 
Manager.
	
	 The Enter a Name for the New 
Catalog dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 2-2.
	
5.	 Type a name for your new 
catalog.
	
	 If you want to import free music 
files for later use when creating 
slide shows, select the Import 
Free Music into This Catalog 
check box.
	
6.	 Click OK.
	
	 You return to the Catalog Manager, and the new catalog is listed below 
your default catalog.
	
7.	 Click OK in the Catalog Manager.
	
	 The new catalog opens in the Organizer with an empty screen. From 
here, you can add photos by importing images, using any of the methods 
described in Chapter 1 of this minibook.
	
One Elements limitation is that it has no option for moving images between 
catalogs.
If you decide that you want to move images from one catalog to another, you 
can import the images into the desired catalog and then delete those images 
from the old catalog. Or, if you like, the same images can appear in more 
than one catalog.
You can create multiple catalogs by following the same steps. To change a 
catalog, choose File➪Manage Catalogs. In the Catalog Manager, click a cata­
log name and click Open. The newly selected catalog is now the default and 
is available in all Elements sessions until you change the catalog again.
	
You can include the same photo in different catalogs.

and click OK.

Importing legacy catalogs
If you’ve used a previous version of Elements, you may want to convert an 
older catalog created in an earlier version of Elements to one that Elements 
12 can recognize. Note that Elements prompts you to convert a legacy cata­
log when you first attempt to open it in Elements 12.
To convert a legacy catalog, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the Catalog Manager by choosing File➪Manage Catalogs.
	
2.	 Click the catalog you want to convert and then click the Convert but­
ton in the Catalog Manager to open the Convert Catalog dialog box.
	
3.	 Select the Show Previously Converted Catalogs check box.
	
	 The list expands to display older catalogs, as shown in Figure 2-3.
	
	 Additionally, you can click the Find More Catalogs button and locate cat­
alogs that are saved to your hard drive.
Figure 2-3: Select the Show Previously Converted Catalogs check box 
to expand the list.
	
4.	 Click the Done button.
	
	 The catalogs are converted and displayed in the Catalog Manager.
Switching catalogs
As you create new catalogs, you switch back and forth between catalogs to 
view photos in the Organizer. If you make a catalog active, of course, you see 
only the photos you’ve previously added to that particular catalog.

115
Book II 
Chapter 2
Viewing, Searching, 
and Sorting Images
Viewing Images in the Organizer
To switch catalogs, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Manage Catalogs to open the Catalog Manager. 
	
2.	 From the list of catalogs that appears, select 
the catalog that you want to open, as shown 
in Figure 2-4.
	
3.	 Click the Open button. 
	
	 The photos added to the catalog appear in 
the Organizer, and you’re ready to edit those 
pictures.
Viewing Images in the Organizer
After you add images to a catalog, the default Organizer view — the view 
you’re most likely to use in all your Elements work sessions — looks a lot 
like a light table (those tables with lights under the tabletop that enable you 
to easily view sheets full of negatives). 
The Organizer window shows you all the files that have been added to a par­
ticular catalog. You can change the types of views you see in the Organizer to 
facilitate finding photos and managing them. In addition to the default view, 
here are a few of the other view options:
	
✓	Double-click a photo in the Organizer, and you see the image fill an 
Organizer window. 
	
✓	Use the View menu to limit the images shown based on media type, date, 
and more.
	
✓	Examine your pictures one by one in a slide show.
	
✓	Compare images side by side.
If you’re looking for one or more images to edit, you can select the desired 
images and then select an editor to use — whether from the Edit menu or 
from a context menu opened on a selected image. Or, instead of opening a 
menu, simply click the Editor button at the bottom of the Organizer window 
to switch to the Photo Editor.
In the sections that follow, you find just what you need to know about your 
viewing options in the Organizer.
Understanding the Media Browser
The central area in the Organizer where you see image previews of your pho­
tos is called the Media Browser. The Media Browser displays thumbnail 
Figure 2-4: Click the catalog 
that you want to open.

116
Viewing Images in the Organizer
images of photos and also displays icons for other file types, such as PDFs, 
videos, and audio files.
When you import photos in the Organizer, the Organizer doesn’t create a 
copy of your image elsewhere on your hard drive or external drive. Instead, 
the Organizer keeps track of the locations of your files on your hard drive 
and creates links to the images. Therefore, the catalog doesn’t get overbur­
dened with the total file size for each image.
In Windows, if you move 
a photo (or rename a 
photo or folder) to 
another folder on your 
hard drive, the link to the 
file is broken. When you 
click a thumbnail in the 
Media Browser where a 
photo has been moved to 
another location, 
Elements opens a dialog 
box and begins searching 
for the file. In the dialog 
box, you can click the 
Browse button and man­
ually locate the file to 
reestablish the link.
When you import new 
media into the active cat­
alog, only the media you 
last imported is shown in 
the Media Browser. To 
see all the media in your 
catalog (media that was 
previously imported as 
well as a new import), 
click the All Media button 
at the top of the Media 
Browser, as shown in 
Figure 2-5.
Using Thumbnail view
When you open the Organizer, the default view is a Thumbnail display. Your 
photos, videos, projects, audio files, and so on are shown as mini-images or 
icons in the Media Browser that you can adjust to different sizes.
Figure 2-5: Click the All Media button to show all the media 
in the open catalog.

Viewing Images in the Organizer
Below the Media Browser, you find a zoom slider. Move the slider left and 
right to size the thumbnail images.
	
Press Ctrl++ (Control plus the + key — Windows) or ⌘++ (Command plus 
the + key — Macintosh) to zoom in on the image thumbnails. To zoom out, 
press Ctrl+- (Control plus the – [minus] Key — Windows) or ⌘+- (Command 
plus the – [minus] key — Macintosh).
If you double-click a photo, the image thumbnail zooms into view as a single 
photo in the Media Browser. To return to a view where you see smaller 
thumbnails, click the icon to the left of the slider.
Using sort commands
One quick way to sort images in the Organizer is to use the menu on the 
Shortcuts bar in the Organizer window for date sorting. The following four 
options are available to you, as shown in Figure 2-6:
	
✓	Newest: Select this 
option to view 
images according to 
the date you took the 
photos, beginning 
with the most recent 
date.
	
✓	Oldest: This option 
displays photos in 
chronological order, 
starting with the old­
est file.
	
✓	Name: When you 
choose Name, files 
are sorted according 
to filenames.
	
✓	Import Batch: Import Batch organizes photos according to the date you 
import files. All files imported together are nested in groups according 
to the import. You may have photos taken in 2009, 2011, and 2012 and 
import them all together. When you choose Import Batch, all the files 
from a given year are viewed together in the Media Browser.
Changing view options on the View menu
The View menu enables you to change views and sort images according to 
different preset views:
Figure 2-6: You can sort files quickly by Date (Newest First) 
order, Date (Oldest First) order, Name, or Import Batch.

118
Viewing Images in the Organizer
	
✓	Media types: The Media Browser displays thumbnail previews and icons 
for Photos, Videos, Audio files, Projects, and PDF documents. Choose 
View➪Media Types and select the types you want to display in the 
Media Browser or deselect to hide a media type. If you want only photos 
shown in the Media Browser, deselect each of the other media types on 
the Media Types submenu.
	
✓	Hidden files: Some files, such as different versions of the same docu­
ment, may be hidden from view. Choose View➪Hidden Files, and you 
can make choices for hiding files, showing all files, or showing only the 
hidden files. See the section “Hiding Files That Get in the Way,” later in 
this chapter, for more about hidden files.
	
✓	Sort by: When you choose View➪Sort By, you have the same options 
that are available on the Sort By menu that appears at the top of the 
Media Browser. The preceding section explains each of the sorting 
options.
	
✓	Details: You may want to keep the Details display as a default. Details 
displays star ratings if you rate files from 1 to 5 stars (Chapter 3 of this 
minibook explains how), dates the photos were taken, and the filename. 
In Figure 2-7, you can see some files with the Details and star ratings. 
Notice that adding Details takes up a bit more vertical space. However, 
the trade-off is slight when you review large catalogs and want to locate 
files by ratings, creation dates, or filenames.

creation dates, and filenames.

✓	Timeline view: Choose View➪Timeline, and a horizontal timeline 
appears above the Media Browser with a slider. (You can also see this 
view by pressing Ctrl+L or, on the Mac, ⌘+L.) Click All Media in the cata­
log; you can adjust the slider to narrow the thumbnail views to specific 
date periods; see Figure 2-8.
	
	Be careful: The date is taken from the camera metadata. If a date isn’t 
available from the camera data, the date is taken from the file’s creation 
date and thus isn’t likely to be the date you shot the photo.
Figure 2-8: Move the slider on the Timeline to view photos 
within date ranges.
	
✓	Gridlines: In Figure 2-8, you see lines dividing the thumbnail images into 
rectangles. When viewing Details, also shown in Figure 2-8, the Gridline 
view makes it easy to understand what detail belongs to a given 
thumbnail.

✓	Expanding and collapsing stacks: You can stack photos like a deck of 
cards, with only the top image appearing in the Media Browser. You can 
select two or more photos and stack them by choosing Edit➪Stack➪
Stacked Selected Photos. You can also have Elements automatically stack 
photos when importing media into the Organizer. See the section 
“Stacking ’em up,” later in this chapter.
	
	The View➪Expand All Stacks command expands stacks so that all photos 
within stacks are shown. Choosing View➪Collapse All Stacks returns the 
stacks to a collapsed view.
Viewing photos in a slide show (Full Screen view)
Are you ready for some exciting viewing in Photoshop Elements? To take an 
alternative view of your Organizer files, you can see your pictures in a self-
running slide show (in Full Screen view), complete with transition effects 
and background music. Full Screen view takes you to a Slide Show view. For 
the purposes of clarity, think of Full Screen view and viewing a Slide Show as 
the same thing. Full-screen viewing temporarily hides the Elements tools and 
menus and gives you the most viewing area on your monitor to see your 
pictures.
	
Viewing files in Slide Show mode can be helpful for quickly previewing the 
files you want to edit for all kinds of output, as well as for previewing photos 
that you might use for an exported slide show, which we explain in Book IX.
	
Creating a slide show and outputting it to a movie file is supported only on 
Windows. However, viewing slide shows in Elements is supported for both 
Windows and Macintosh users. Also, both Windows and Mac users can cre­
ate PDF slide shows, as we explain in Book IX, Chapter 1. The only limitation 
Macintosh users have is that they cannot export slide shows as movie files.
Taking a quick view of the slide show
To set up your slide show and/or enter Full Screen view, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer.
	
2.	 Select images that you want to see in a slide show or use all the 
images in the Organizer for your slide show.
	
	 If no images are selected when you enter Full Screen view, all photos in 
the Organizer window are shown in Full Screen view.
	
3.	 Click the Slide Show button at the bottom of the Organizer window.
	
	 You jump right into the Full Screen view with some panels and tools 
displayed, as shown in Figure 2-9.

	 You can also open Full Screen view by pressing F11 (⌘+F11 on the Mac). 
On Apple laptop computers, press Fn (Function key)+F11.
	
4.	 View the slides.
	
	 The slide show swipes photos at an interval you can specify in the 
Settings. By default, the photos change every 4 seconds. You can watch 
the slide show, or you can click the arrow keys at the bottom of the 
screen to move forward and back through the slides.
	
5.	 Exit the Full Screen view and press the Esc key on your keyboard to 
return to the Organizer window.
Working with the Edit tools
Full Screen and Slide Show views provide you with several editing tools. 
When you open selected photos from the Organizer in Full Screen or Slide 
Show view, you find two panels on the left side of the screen. The Edit panel 
provides Edit tools for editing photos, such as sharpening images and 
removing red-eye. The Organize panel permits you to add keywords for eas­
ily organizing photos.

122
Viewing Images in the Organizer
To open the Edit panel, shown in Figure 2-10, 
click the vertical tab on the left side of the Full 
Screen window or click the Fix button on the 
Slide Show toolbar.
As you move the mouse cursor over the tools, 
tooltips display the tool name. You can easily 
locate tools in the Edit panel and make image 
adjustments without leaving the Full Screen/
Slide Show view.
Elements provides you with many different editing 
options using the Quick Edit tools, and we cover 
each of the tools later in Book VIII, Chapter 1.
Working with the Organize tools
The other panel on the left side of the Full 
Screen/Slide Show window is the Organize panel. 
Click Organize on the left side of the window to 
open the panel or click the Organize button on 
the Slide Show toolbar.
As you can see in Figure 2-11, this panel offers 
you choices for adding images to existing albums 
from the current images in the Full Screen/Slide 
Show view, and you can tag photos with key­
word tags. For more information on creating 
albums and creating keyword tags, see Chapter 3 
of this minibook.
Using the Slide Show toolbar
The toolbar shown in Figure 2-9 offers the follow­
ing options for slide viewing (from left to right):
	
✓	Previous Media: Click the left arrow to open 
the previous photo or other media.
	
✓	Play/Pause: Click to play or pause a slide 
show.
	
✓	Next Media: Click the right arrow to advance 
to the next photo or other media.
	
✓	Theme: This item was named Transitions in earlier versions of Elements. 
Click the Theme tool, and the Select Transition dialog box opens, as shown 
in Figure 2-12. When you enter Full Screen view, this tool is selected. Four 
different transition effects are displayed in the dialog box. You can preview 
Figure 2-10: The Edit panel

and hides the Fix, Organize, and Info tools.
	
The main thing to keep in mind is that the Full Screen view is a temporary 
viewing option you have in Elements. It’s not permanent. You use the view 
for a quick display method on your computer when you want to show off 
some photos to family and friends. Windows users have more permanent 
options for saving files as slide shows that they can share with other users, 
as we explain in Book IX.
Exploring more options in context menus
When you are in Full Screen view, you lose the top-level menus. If you’re 
wondering how you can add the slide images to an album or create a Slide 
Show movie file (Windows only), you need a menu command. Because the 
menus are hidden, you must open a context menu in the Full Screen view.
In a context menu, you find options not available in the panels or the Slide 
Show tools. Figure 2-14 shows a context menu opened in Full Screen view. 
You have menu commands for adding images to an existing album, removing 
an image from an album, creating a slide show (Windows only), marking for 
printing, and several commands for working with keyword tags.

Searching for Images in the Organizer
	
When in doubt, always look for commands and features by opening a con­
text menu. 
Searching for Images in the Organizer
The Organizer’s Find menu is devoted entirely to searching for photos. From 
the Find menu, you can locate photos in albums and catalogs or based on a 
variety of search criteria. In addition, you have a Search text box at the top 
of the Organizer window.
To use the Organizer’s search features, you need to have photos loaded in 
the Organizer. The following sections introduce the available search options 
and explain how each one works.
Typing search terms in the Search box
At the top of the Organizer window, you find Search with a text box. Type 
text in the box to search a given name or search criteria. Type any informa­
tion in the text box related to filenames, captions, notes, and metadata.
	
Search is powerful and supports Boolean expressions (AND, OR, NOT). You 
can, for example type Jack AND Jill to find only files that match both words 
(not just one or the other). Or you can type Jack OR Jill AND Harry to nar­
row the search to files that contain either the word Jack or Jill but all of 
which match the word Harry. Or if you needed a photo of Jack and Jill 
together, but without Harry, the Boolean search Jack AND Jill NOT Harry 
would help you narrow your options.
After typing the search criteria, press Enter/Return to perform a text search, 
or you can choose from menu items to open other search items. Those 
items, shown in the drop-down menu in Figure 2-15, are explained later in 
this section.
Using Advanced Search
	
Advanced Search is placed at the top of the Find menu and for good reason. 
This option provides you with one of the best methods for searching through 
the Media Browser. In one window, you can search for Newest/Oldest photos, 
photos rated with star ratings, Keywords tags, People tags, Places tags, and 
Events tags. (Chapter 3 of this minibook explains how to tag photos.)
Choose Find➪Using Advanced Search, and the Media Browser display changes, 
as shown in Figure 2-16. The panes are scrollable so that you can locate all the 
tagged items in the four panes. Select the check boxes for the items you want 
to search, and the Media Browser dynamically updates to display the photos 
meeting the conditions you selected in the Advanced Search area.

Searching metadata
Metadata includes not only the information about your images that’s sup­
plied by digital cameras but also the custom data you can add to a file. 
Metadata contains descriptions of the image, including such data as your 
camera name, the camera settings you used to take a picture, copyright 
information, and much more.
Searching metadata is easy. Just choose Find➪By Details (Metadata) in the 
Organizer. The Find by Details (Metadata) dialog box opens. The first two 
columns in the dialog box offer a number of different choices for search cri­
teria and for options based on the criteria. In the third column, you type 
search criteria into a text box to specify exactly what you want to search for. 
You can click the plus button to add new lines to your search criteria, as 
shown in Figure 2-17, which shows four lines of search criteria. Clicking the 
minus button deletes a line.
Figure 2-17: Choose Find➪By Details (Metadata) in the Organizer to 
open the dialog box in which you specify metadata.
Searching by media type
You have the same choices here as you do when viewing media. Choose 
Find➪By Media Type. From the submenu, choose Photos, Video, Audio, 
Projects, PDF, and/or Items with Audio Captions.

Searching by history
Elements keeps track of what you 
do with your photos, such as print­
ing from within Elements, sharing 
photos, and performing various 
other tasks. If you want to base a 
search for files based on the file his­
tory, choose Find➪By History, as 
shown in Figure 2-18. After you 
choose an option from the By 
History submenu, you see files that 
meet your criteria arranged by date 
and displayed in the Media Browser.
Your options on the By History sub­
menu include
	
✓	Imported On: If you choose this 
option, you can select a date 
when files were imported into 
the current catalog. When you 
make this choice on the sub­
menu, the dialog box that opens 
lets you select the import date 
and click OK. (All options on the 
submenu display a dialog box 
similar to Figure 2-19 when the 
respective menu command is 
chosen.)
	
✓	Emailed To: Choose this menu 
item, and the list in Figure 2-19 
changes to reflect all the photos 
you e-mailed from within Elements.
	
✓	Printed On: This option displays all files printed in a date order for the 
print date and time.
	
✓	Exported On: This choice displays files that were exported from the cur­
rent catalog.
	
✓	Ordered Online: This item displays files that were submitted to an 
online service.
	
✓	Shared Online: This choice displays files that were shared online.
	
✓	Used in Projects: This option displays files that were used in projects.

Searching captions and notes
When captions or notes are added to files, you can search for the caption 
name, contents of a note, or both. Before you can search for captions and 
notes, though, you have to add them to your images similarly to the note we 
added in Figure 2-20.
Figure 2-20: The Information panel.
Adding captions and notes
Text captions and notes are easy to create. Although you can select a 
thumbnail image in the Organizer window and choose Edit➪Add Caption, a 
better way is to use the Information panel. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	 To open the Information panel, select a thumbnail image in the 
Organizer and click the Information panel in the Panel Bin.
	
2.	 Type a caption by adding text to the Caption text box.

130
Searching for Images in the Organizer
	
3.	 Type text in the Notes area on the panel to add a note.
	
	 That’s all there is to it, as shown in Figure 2-20. You can also record 
audio notes about an image. 
	
To record audio, click Audio in the Information panel, and a dialog box 
opens where you can click a button to make your recording.
Searching the captions and notes content
After you create captions and notes, you can search for the words contained 
in the descriptions.
To search for caption names and notes in your open catalog, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer.
	
	 You should have images in a catalog and have files identified with cap­
tions and notes.
	
2.	 Choose Find➪By Caption or Note.
	
	 The Find by Caption or Note dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-21.
	
	 Options in the dialog box are as 
follows:
 
•	 Find Items with Caption or 
Note: In the text box, type the 
words you want to locate.
	
•	 Match Only the Beginning of 
Words in Captions and Notes: 
Select this radio button if 
you know that your caption 
or note begins with words 
that you type into the text 
box.
	
•	 Match Any Part of Any Word in Captions and Notes: Select this radio 
button if you’re not sure whether the text typed in the box is used at 
the beginning of a caption or note, or whether it’s contained in the 
caption’s name or the note’s text.
	
3.	 Click OK.
	
	 Your results appear in the Organizer window.
Searching by filename
Choose Find➪By Filename, and a dialog box opens. Type the name of the file 
you want to find and click OK.

Searching missing files, version sets, and stacks
If you have files that appear in the Media Browser but Elements cannot find 
the file, you may want to search your hard drive to locate the files. Choose 
Find➪All Missing Files, and a dialog box opens. Elements automatically 
searches locations on your hard drive to locate the missing files.
	
Remember that the Media Browser contains references to only the original 
files; so if you move photos to different locations on your hard drive, 
Elements loses the links to the photos.
	
You can create stacks and version sets where photos are grouped together, 
as we explain at the end of this chapter. Choose Find➪Stacks or choose 
Find➪Version Sets, and Elements displays only stacks or version sets in the 
Media Browser.
Searching by visual similarities
Elements enables you to search photos for visual similarities. You may have 
group shots, architecture, animal life, and so on and want to search for pho­
tos where objects in the photos are visually similar. To search for photos 
with visual similarities, choose Find➪By Visual Searches. From the submenu, 
you can choose Visually Similar Photos and Videos, Objects Appearing in 
Photos, and Duplicate Photos.
The features for finding people are integrated with Elements’ tagging fea­
tures and discussed in the sections about tagging in Chapter 3 of this 
minibook.
Searching duplicates
You may have a number of duplicate or near-duplicate photos. You may 
want to locate duplicates or near-duplicate images and delete some of them 
from your catalog.
Searching for duplicates is a two-step process:
	
1.	 Choose Find➪By Visual Searches➪Visually Similar Photos and Videos.
	
	 To help narrow your search, move the slider for Color/Shape back and 
forth. The results are immediately displayed in the Media Browser.
	
2.	 Return to the Find➪By Visual Searches menu and choose Duplicate 
Photos.
	
	 Photos that are visually similar appear in horizontal rows.
In Figure 2-22, you can see one of the rows as it appeared after we performed 
a search. Notice the Stack button on the right side of the second figure in the 

132

second row. Click Stack, and the photos are stacked. If you want to delete 
photos, click a photo and click the Remove from Catalog button at the bot­
tom of the window.
Figure 2-22: Here, we did a search for similar photos and then searched 
for duplicate photos.
Searching objects
You may have objects in photos, 
such as buildings, automobiles, trees, 
groups of people, and so on that you 
want to stack or delete. To search for 
objects, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Find➪By Visual 
Searches➪Visually Similar 
Photos and Videos.
	
2.	 Search again and choose 
Objects Appearing in Photos 
from the By Visual Searches 
submenu.
	
	 A rectangle appears on a 
selected photo that contains the 
object you want to search. You 
can move the rectangle and 
resize it.
	
3.	 When you’ve identified the 
object, click Search Object, as 
shown in Figure 2-23.

Hiding Files That Get in the Way
Searching for miscellaneous items
Other search items you have on the Find menu include Items with Unknown 
Dates, Untagged Items, Unanalyzed Content, and Items Not in Any Albums. 
These items are self-explanatory and make more sense when you run the 
Elements Auto Analyzer (see Book I, Chapter 4) and work with Albums (see 
the section “Working with Albums” in Chapter 3 of this minibook).
Hiding Files That Get in the Way
Elements offers a few ways to hide files so that you can keep your images 
organized and easy to find.
With a simple menu command, you can mark selected files in the Organizer 
as hidden. You might have several files of the same subject and want to keep 
only one file visible in the Organizer window. However, you may not want to 
delete the other photos. You can hide files in the Organizer window — and 
show the hidden files later by using menu commands.
Select files that you want to hide, and from either the Edit menu or a context 
menu, choose Visibility➪Mark as Hidden. To see the files you marked as hid­
den, return to the same Visibility menu and choose Show Hidden. When you 
remove the check mark for Show Hidden, you hide the files. To toggle easily 
between showing and hiding files marked for hiding, choose View➪Hidden 
Files. Selecting this menu command toggles between showing and hiding the 
files you marked for hiding.
The following sections explain how to hide files using stacks.
Stacking ’em up
Think of stacks as a stack of cards that are face up. You see only the front 
card, and all the other cards are hidden behind that card. Stacks work the 
same way. You hide one or more images behind a foreground image. At any 
time, you can sort the images or display all images in the stack in the 
Organizer window.
To create a stack, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Organizer, select several photos.
	
	 You can select any number of photos. However, you can’t stack audio or 
movie files.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Stack➪Stack Selected Photos.
	
	 Elements stacks your photos. The first image you select remains in view 
in the Organizer window. In the upper-right area, an icon that looks like 

134
Hiding Files That Get in the Way
a stack of cards appears on 
the image thumbnail when 
you’ve stacked some images, 
as shown in Figure 2-24. When 
you click the photo to open 
the stack in the Organizer, 
you find the same icon in the 
upper-right corner shown at 
the bottom of Figure 2-24. You 
also see a right-pointing arrow 
to the right of the image 
thumbnail for a collapsed 
stack and left-pointing arrow 
to the right of the last photo 
in an expanded stack. To see 
all images in the stack, click 
the right-pointing arrow. To collapse the stack, click the left-pointing 
arrow that appears when a stack is expanded.
Managing stacks
After you stack a group of images, you can use the Stack submenu com­
mands to manage the photos. Click a stack to select it and then choose 
Edit➪Stack. The submenu commands that are available are
	
✓	Automatically Suggest Photo Stacks: Choose this command to make 
Elements search the photos in the Organizer window for visually similar 
appearances. Photos that look similar are opened in a separate window, 
where you can select the photos you want to stack. Make a selection of 
two or more photos and then choose Stack Selected Photos from the 
same submenu.
	
✓	Stack Selected Photos: This command remains grayed out unless you 
have several photos selected to create a stack.
	
✓	Unstack Photos: Click a stack in the Organizer and choose this com­
mand to return all images to the Organizer window and eliminate the 
stack.
	
✓	Expand Photos in Stack: This command expands the stack to show all 
thumbnail images in the Organizer window.
	
✓	Collapse Photos in Stack: This command collapses a stack to show only 
the top photo in the Organizer window.
	
✓	Flatten Stack: After you stack some photos, this command becomes 
available. When you flatten a stack, the top-level photo is retained, and 
all other photos in the stack are deleted from the catalog.

	Be careful with this command. All photos except for the top photo really 
are deleted from the catalog — although not from your hard drive.
	
✓	Remove Photo from Stack: Choosing this command removes the 
selected photo from the stack. It doesn’t delete the photo from your cat­
alog but merely moves it outside the stack.
	
✓	Set as Top Photo: Before accessing this command, you choose Expand 
Photos in Stack. If you don’t like the topmost photo, select another and 
choose this menu command to move the selected photo to the top of 
the stack.
	
If you want to view all stacks in an Organizer window in expanded form, 
choose View➪Expand All Stacks. Using this command, you don’t have to 
select stacks individually in the Organizer before expanding them.

Chapter 3: Organizing Images with 
Tags, Albums, and More
In This Chapter
✓	Tagging images with keywords
✓	Putting photos on a map
✓	Rating images with stars
✓	Organizing images into albums
W

hen you have a catalog with many photos, you’ll want to organize 
the photos so that you can easily locate the pictures you want to 
share or use when making creations. Fortunately, Photoshop Elements 
offers a number of tools to help you organize and find images you want to 
use in editing sessions. 
In this chapter, we extend our discussion from Chapter 2 of this minibook, 
where you find out how the view, search, and sort tools tell the Media 
Browser to display only files that meet certain criteria. These tools 
help you narrow down images so that you can easily apply 
tags, rate images with stars, and create albums, which are 
the tasks you find out how to do in this chapter.
As a bonus, after you develop a system for tagging 
your photos or rating them with stars, the viewing 
and searching features become even more robust. 
For example, after you add the tags and star rat­
ings, you can then search for images based on a tag 
or rating. Or, if you want to collect several images 
with various tags, star ratings, or metadata for an 
image-editing project, you can use the view and 
search features to track down the images you want 
and then organize those images into an album so that 
they’re all a click away as you work on your project.

Introducing Tags and the Tags Panel
Introducing Tags and the Tags Panel
In the Organizer window, the Tags panel helps you sort and organize your 
pictures. In the lower-right corner of the Organizer, the Tags/Info button tog­
gles display of the panel so that it’s hidden or visible. With the panel visible, 
simply click the Tags tab at the top to see the whole panel of tags and tools 
for working with them.
You use the Tags panel to identify individual images by using a limitless 
number of options for categorizing your pictures. In this panel, you can find 
Keywords tags, People tags, Places tags, and Events tags that help you 
neatly organize files. To create keyword tags, all the tools you need are right 
in the Tags panel. To tag people, places, or events, you can click the corre­
sponding tab at the top of the screen to see additional tools that help you 
find and tag images based on the respective categories.
	
In Elements 12, Adobe has made the category divisions much easier for you 
by adding People, Places, and Events tags right under the Keywords tags in 
the Tags panel.
Before you start adding different types of tags, here are a couple of basics 
you need to know before you get started:
	
✓	You can create unique tags of each type. Each of the four tag types 
shown in Figure 3-1 contains its own drop-down menu where new tags 
can be created. For example, when you open the People Tags drop-down 
menu, you find New Person as the first menu item. You use this com­
mand to add a new People tag. In the Places Tags area, you find Add a 
New Place. Choose this item to add a new Places tag. In the Events Tags 
portion, you find Add an Event. Use this item to add a new Events tag.
	
✓	The hierarchy for each tag type has categories and subcategories. 
When you add new tags, a category tag is at the top of the tag hierarchy. 
Below a category or subcategory, you can add additional subcategories. 
For example, you may want to create a Holiday category Keywords tag, 
and below it, you may want to add several different holidays, such as 
Valentine’s Day, Groundhog Day, Independence Day, and so on. You 
might add people in the People Tags area and have subcategories for 
each person.
	
Tags are saved automatically with the catalog you work with. By default, 
Elements creates a catalog and automatically saves your work to it. If you 
happen to create another catalog, as we explain in Chapter 2 of this mini­
book, your tags disappear. Be aware of which catalog is open when you cre­
ate tags so you can return to them.

139
Book II 
Chapter 3
Organizing Images

Introducing Tags and the Tags Panel
Figure 3-1: The four main tag categories.
You can manage tags by using menu commands from the New drop-down 
menu and other commands from a contextual menu that you open by right-
clicking a tag in the Tags panel.
On the New drop-down menu, you can access the following commands. 
We’ve used the specific names you see for Keywords tags here, but other 
than the tag type, the commands are the same for Keywords, People, Places, 
and Events tags:
	
✓	New Keyword Tag: Create a new keyword tag. The upcoming section 
“Creating a custom keyword tag,” walks you through the process step 
by step.
	
✓	New Sub-Category: A subcategory is like a nested bookmark. Create a 
subcategory by selecting New Sub-Category from the New menu; a dia­
log box opens, prompting you to type a name for the new subcategory. 
As an example of how you would use keyword tags and subcategories, 
you might have a keyword tag category named Uncle Joe’s Wedding. 
Then, you might create subcategories for Bride Dressing Room, 
Ceremony, Family Photos, Reception, and so on.

140
Organizing Groups of Images with Keyword Tags
	
✓	New Category: Choose New Category to open a dialog box that prompts 
you to type a name for the new category. By default, you can find pre­
defined category names for People, Places, Events, and Other. If you 
want to add your own custom categories, use this menu command.
	
✓	Edit: Click Edit, and the Edit Keyword Tag dialog box opens, where you 
can customize how your tag looks. See the section “Adding icons to key­
word tags,” later in this chapter, for details.
	
✓	Import Keyword Tags from File: If you export a keyword tag, the file is 
written as XML (eXtensible Markup Language). When you choose From 
File, you can import an XML version of a keyword tags file.
	
✓	Save Keyword Tags to a File: You can save keyword tags to a file that 
you can retrieve with the From File command. This option is handy 
when you open a different catalog file and want to import the same col­
lection of names created in one catalog file to another catalog file.
	
✓	Collapse All Keyword Tags: Keyword tags appear like bookmark lists 
that you can collapse and expand. An expanded list shows you all the 
subcategory keyword tags. Choose Collapse All Keyword Tags to col­
lapse the list.
	
✓	Expand All Keyword Tags: This command expands a collapsed list.
	
✓	Show Large Icon: Select this item on the menu and the icons appear 
larger. While in a larger view, you can see the icons associated with tags. 
If Show Large Icon is deselected, you won’t see the icons you add with 
the Edit Icon dialog box.
Organizing Groups of Images with Keyword Tags
Elements provides you with a great opportunity for organizing files, in the 
form of keyword tags. After you acquire your images in the Organizer, you 
can sort them and add keyword tags according to the dates you took the pic­
tures, the subject matter, or some other categorical arrangement.
Elements offers you a selection of keyword tags that you can use to tag your 
photos, and we refer to these tags as the default tags. We refer to custom key­
word tags as those tags you create in the Tags panel. When you create a new 
tag, you end up with a custom tag that you can modify in regard to the 
appearance. With the default tags that Elements provides, you can make 
some changes to the tag appearances but in limited ways. For example, you 
have some preset icon images that Elements provides you, and you can 
choose one of the preset images for the icon appearance. However, you 
can’t add a custom image for the tag icon.

Organizing Groups of Images with Keyword Tags
In the following sections, you walk through the process of creating and cus­
tomizing keyword tags in the Tag panel and tagging your photos.
Creating a custom keyword tag
To create a new keyword tag, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer window by clicking the Organizer button in an 
editing mode or by clicking the Organizer button on the Welcome 
screen.
	
	 At this point, we assume that you have images imported into the 
Organizer. If you don’t have photos in a catalog, refer to Book I, Chapter 
1, to see how to add images.
	
2.	 If the Tags panel isn’t already displayed, click the Tags/Info button in 
the lower right to display the panels and select Tags at the top of the 
panel bin.
	
3.	 To create a new keyword tag, click the plus (+) icon in the Tags panel 
to open a drop-down menu and then choose New Keyword Tag.
	
	 Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+N (⌘+N on the Mac) to create a new 
keyword tag.
	
	 The Create Keyword Tag dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 3-2.
	
4.	 Click the Category drop-down 
menu and choose one of the 
preset categories listed on the 
menu.
	
	 See the section “Building your 
own categories and subcatego­
ries,” later in this chapter, for 
instructions on customizing 
these categories.
	
5.	 Type a name for the tag in the 
Name text box and add a note 
to describe the keyword tag.
	
	 You might use the subject mat­
ter or other descriptive informa­
tion for the note.
	
6.	 Click OK in the Create 
Keyword Tag dialog box.
	
	 You return to the Organizer window.
Figure 3-2: The Create Keyword Tag dialog box.

142
Organizing Groups of Images with Keyword Tags
Tagging photos
After you create the tag you need, you’re ready to apply that tag to your 
photos. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 In the Organizer window, select the photos to which you want to add 
keyword tags.
	
	 Click a photo and Shift-click another photo to select photos in a group. 
Click a photo and Ctrl-click (⌘-click on the Mac) different photos scat­
tered around the Organizer window to select nonsequential photos. The 
view and search features discussed in Chapter 2 of this minibook can 
help you narrow your choices based on specific criteria.
	
2.	 To add a new keyword tag to a photo (or 
selection of photos), click one of the 
selected photos in the Organizer window 
and drag the photo thumbnail to the tag’s 
icon in the Tags panel, as shown in Figure 
3-3.
	
	 Alternatively, you can drag a tag to the 
selected photos.
	
	 When you release the mouse button, the 
photos are added to the new keyword tag.
You can add one or more tags to any photo. For 
example, if you take a lot of family photos, you 
might have a tag called Group Family Photos as 
well as a tag for different events, such as 
Reunion and Christmas. You’d likely have at 
least a handful of photos that you could tag with both the Group Family 
Photos tag and the Reunion tag for group photos taken at a family reunion.
Adding icons to keyword tags
In Figure 3-2, the Create Keyword Tag dialog box appears empty without an 
icon. If you want to add an image to the tag icon, you can handle it in a few 
ways. Perhaps the most reliable is to edit the icon by following these steps:
	
1.	 In the Tags panel, open a context menu by right-clicking (Option-
clicking on a Mac) a tag and then choose Edit. 
	
2.	 When the Edit Keyword Tag dialog box opens, click Edit Icon. 
	
	 The Edit Keyword Tag Icon dialog box opens. The dialog box displays 
the total number of images that are tagged with the current tag.

adding some keyword tags.

images and choose one for an 
icon, as shown in Figure 3-4.
	
4.	 (Optional) Crop the image by 
moving handles on the rectan­
gle displayed in the Edit 
Keyword Tag Icon dialog box. 
	
	 Rest assured that this cropping 
just determines what part of 
your image will appear as the 
keyword icon. You don’t actually 
crop your image in this step.
	
5.	 Click OK when you finish edit­
ing the icon.
	
	 The icon is displayed in the 
Tags panel.
Modifying the default 
keyword tags
You can also modify the names for 
the default tags, and you can add 
some custom subcategories. To edit 
a default category tag, open a con­
text menu and choose Edit in one of 
the predefined categories. The Edit 
Category dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 3-5.
Notice the Choose Color button in 
Figure 3-5. Click this button, and you 
can change the color of the tag icon. 
Also notice in Figure 3-5 that a row 
of icon images appears for choosing 
a category icon. Move the scroll bar 
horizontally and click the icon you 
want to use for the preset category. 
You’re limited to the images that 
Elements provides for displaying 
icons on the predefined categories.
Figure 3-4: The Edit Keyword Tag Icon dialog 
box enables you to add or change a tag icon.
Figure 3-5: The Edit Category dialog box enables 
you to make some changes to the tag icon.

Finding and Tagging People in Photos
Building your own categories and subcategories
In the earlier section “Introducing Tags and the Tags Panel,” you find out 
about the context menu that you can open for each tag type, as well as the 
way that tags have a hierarchy of categories and subcategories.
To create a category and/or subcategory, follow these steps:
	
1.	 From the Keyword Tags drop-down menu in the Tags panel, choose 
New Category.
	
	 The Create Category dialog box appears.
	
2.	 Provide a name and choose a color and icon for the appearance.
	
3.	 After creating a new category, choose New Sub-Category from the 
Keyword Tags drop-down menu.
	
	 The Create Sub-Category dialog box appears.
	
4.	 Provide a Sub-Category name and click OK.
	
5.	 Repeat Steps 1 through 4 until you create all the subcategories you 
want.
	
A Category tag you create using the context menu is limited to the same 
conditions you have with the default category tags. You can’t use custom 
icons, and you’re restricted to using the icons provided by Elements (refer 
to Figure 3-5). All the Sub-Category icons are predefined for you, as you can 
see in Figure 3-1, where three subcategories appear in the People Tags panel.
Finding and Tagging People in Photos
Elements provides a great, although not perfect, solution for identifying and 
labeling people. As people are identified, keyword tags are automatically 
added to the Tags panel. After you tag people, you can easily click the 
People tab at the top of the Organizer window and locate all the people 
you’ve tagged.
	
Before you start using Elements’ facial recognition features, you’ll find it 
helpful to understand Elements’ strengths and weaknesses in determining 
whether a photo contains a person:
	
✓	Photos that show a person’s whole face from the front are generally rec­
ognized by Elements as a photo with a person.
	
✓	Elements has more difficulty recognizing profile shots, people’s faces at 
angles, and people wearing hats. Elements may also not detect a person 
in photos where harsh contrast appears along faces, such as partial 
shadow and partial bright sunlight.

Finding and Tagging People in Photos
With this in mind, you can’t rely solely on Elements to identify people in 
photos. You have to fine-tune the automated features by hand. Here’s the 
basic process for using Elements’ automated facial recognition tool along 
with its manual people-tagging tool to make sure that the important people 
in your photos are all tagged:
	
1.	 Tag on import.
	
	 Elements recognizes some photos when you import them into the 
Organizer, but the process isn’t foolproof. Elements may not recognize 
that some photos containing people may need people tags. You can 
choose to supply names for people when the photos are imported or 
dismiss tagging people and handle the tagging later.
	
2.	 Add people.
	
	 You can add people to a batch after you import it. However, you must 
have some photos tagged with people names for Elements to offer you 
suggestions and automate the tagging process. If you start in a catalog 
that has no people tags, you need to first identify some people in some 
photos using the Mark Face feature. After that, when Elements analyzes 
photos, it makes recommendations for tags that belong to people in pho­
tos. The next section walks you through this process.
	
3.	 Individually tag photos where Elements missed people.
	
	 You can open a photo in the Media Browser and supply tag information 
individually on photos with the Mark Face feature. The upcoming sec­
tion “Marking faces” explains how this process works.
Adding people
A great way to start adding people tags is by using the Add People button on 
the toolbar at the bottom of the Organizer window. This tool uses facial rec­
ognition to find photos that contain the same person and then asks you to 
confirm whether its analysis is correct. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 Select the folder that you want to search in the Import panel. Or you 
can search the entire catalog if no folder or batch is selected.
	
2.	 Click the Add People button.
	
	 If you’ve tagged people in your catalog, Elements looks for visual similar­
ities and asks you to confirm adding tags to people it thinks are the 
same as other tags in your catalog.
	
3.	 If the people shown in the window match the names on the tagged 
photo, click the Save button. If not, skip to Step 4.
	
	 In Figure 3-6, you see the photo on the left identified and all the other 
photos that Elements thinks are a match.

146
Finding and Tagging People in Photos
Figure 3-6: If all people are a match to the tagged photo, click Save.
	
4.	 If some images aren’t a match, click the photo, and a drop-down menu 
appears. Click Not (Name), as shown in Figure 3-6.
	
	 Elements may display several windows asking you to confirm matches. 
Click Save in each window, and eventually you may arrive at a window 
where Elements can’t find any potential matches. 
	
5.	 If Elements detects a person but not a corresponding people tag, click 
the Who Is This? text and type names for each individual in the win­
dow, as you see in Figure 3-7.
	
	 Notice that when you click the text, Elements may offer suggestions 
below the text box for tags it thinks may belong to the photo. If one of 
the tags does belong to the photo, click the name below the text box. If 
no name appears that matches the photo, type the name of the person 
in the text box.
Marking faces
When Elements doesn’t have a clue that a person appears in the photo, you 
have to go to its missing person’s bureau and find someone. In Elements, 
that bureau is called the Mark Face button. For example, in Figure 3-8, 
Elements recognized the two figures on the left (Arnie and Irene). But 
Elements didn’t recognize Malou on the right as a person.

To use the Mark Face button, do the following:
	
1.	 In the Organizer, locate a photo where a person isn’t recognized.
	
2.	 Double-click the photo to open it in full view in the Media Browser. 

148

	 You must double-click the photo in order for the Mark Face button to

3.	 In the tools at the bottom of the Organizer window, click the Mark 
Face button.
	
	 A new rectangle appears in the photo.
	
4.	 Move and size the rectangle around the face to position it.
	
	 When the cursor is placed inside the rectangle, you can click and drag 
the rectangle around the photo and to the person you want to tag. You 
resize the rectangle by dragging a corner of the rectangle in or out 
diagonally.
	
5.	 Type the name of the person in the text box.
	
6.	 Click the Commit button (green check mark) to accept your edits.
Mapping Photos with Place Tags
Photoshop Elements 11 reintroduced geospatial tagging in Elements with 
Google Maps and support for both Windows and Macintosh users. In addi­
tion, the Places view in the Organizer works in conjunction with maps. As a 
matter of fact, you won’t see a Google map until you click the Places tab at 
the top of the Media Browser.
In Elements 12, tagging photos at map locations is easy as long as you know 
how it works, but quite frustrating if you don’t know how the tools work.
	
GPS cameras and phones can tag photos with locations. Such photos appear 
with places tags automatically when you open the photos in Elements.
There are two ways to add Places tags to your photos:
	
✓	Select photos in the Media Browser. Next, open the Places panel and 
click the Plus icon to open the drop-down menu. Click the New Place 
button, and the Add New Place window opens where you can search the 
map to find the location for tagging the photos. Because you selected 
photos in the Media Browser, Elements assumes you want to add all the 
selected photos to the same place.
	
✓	Click the Add Places button at the bottom of the Organizer. You can do 
this by first selecting photos or not selecting any photos. In the Add 
Places window that opens after you click the Add Places button, a film­
strip appears at the top of the window. Click the photos you want to add 
to a common place.

Mapping Photos with Place Tags
To add geospatial tagging to photos you select in the Media Browser, do the 
following:
	
1.	 Select photos in the Media Browser that you want to tag on a map 
location.
	
2.	 Open the Places panel and click the Plus icon to open the drop-down 
menu.
	
	 When you click the Add Places button, Elements opens the Add Places 
wizard, where you can search for a location and place photos on a map.
	
3.	 Click Add New Place.
	
	 The Add New Place wizard opens.
	
4.	 Search for the map location.
	
	 In the Add New Place wizard shown in Figure 3-9, type a location in the 
search text box and press the Return/Enter key.
	
5.	 Click the green check mark (the Commit button) to tag the images to 
the map location as shown in Figure 3-9.
	
6.	 Click Done.

Tagging Events with the Events Tab
	
7.	 View the photos in the Media Browser.
	
	 Click the Places tab, and click a place listed 
in the panel (shown in Figure 3-10) to display 
photos tagged with a given place in the 
Media Browser.
If you first select photos in the Media Browser 
and click the Add Places button, the Add Places 
wizard opens with the selected photos appearing 
in a filmstrip as shown in Figure 3-11. You can 
choose which photos you want to add to a new 
place or a previously added place by dragging 
photos from the filmstrip to the map below the 
filmstrip.
Theoretically, if you haven’t yet mapped any 
photos to a map location, you use the Places 
panel to add a new place. If later you want to 
add additional photos to the same place, select the photos in the Media 
Browser and click the Add Places button at the bottom of the Organizer 
window.

of the wizard.
Tagging Events with the Events Tab
You may have occasions such as birthday parties, Christmas or other holi­
day celebrations, company picnics, and so on that you want to tag according 
to an event name. 
When adding Events tags, you follow steps similar to when you add People 
and Places tags. Select photos in the Organizer, open the Events Tags panel, 
and click the Plus icon to open the drop-down menu. Click Add New Event in 
Figure 3-10: Click a place in 
the Places panel to see all the 
images tagged with that place.

the menu, and the Events Tags panel appears as 
shown in Figure 3-12.
Type a name for the event, and add the dates by 
either typing a date in the text box or clicking 
the calendar icon to open a calendar where you 
choose dates. Add a Description of the event and 
click Done.
Removing Tags
Invariably, you’ll find yourself tagging a photo 
that doesn’t belong to a tag group. For example, 
you may tag a person with the wrong name, add 
a photo to an event that doesn’t belong in the 
group, or add Keywords tags to photos that 
shouldn’t be tagged with a given tag name.
Photoshop Elements is not very intuitive when it 
comes to deleting tags from photos. You find no 
Delete Tag item in the drop-down menus in the 
different tags panels.
To remove a tag from a photo, you must follow 
some precise steps:
	
1.	 Click a tag item in one of the tags panels to 
display photos tagged with a given name. 
	
	 The right-pointing arrow appears when the 
mouse cursor hovers over a tag name.
	
	 In this example, we use the Events Tags 
panel. We have a tag named Ko Olina Golf 
Tournament. When we click the tag name, the photos with the same tag 
appear in the Media Browser as shown in Figure 3-13.
	
2.	 Click a photo that doesn’t belong in the tag group.
	
	 In our example, we click the last photo in the second row as shown in 
Figure 3-13.
	
3.	 Right-click (Control-click on a Mac with a one-button mouse) in the Image 
Tags panel to open a context menu. Choose Remove from tag name.
	
	 The tag associated with the selected image in the Media Browser 
window is removed.

Automating Tagging with Image Tags

name.
All the tags panels operate the same way when you want to remove tags. 
Display all photos having the same tag. Then, select the mistakenly tagged 
photo or photos in the Media Browser, open a context menu in the Image 
Tags area, and choose to remove the tag.
Automating Tagging with Image Tags
The Image Tags feature at the bottom of the Tags panel puts the burden on 
Elements for sorting through photos and adding tags.

Book II 
Chapter 3
Organizing Images

Rating Images with Stars
	
You use the Image Tags feature in conjunction 
with the Media Analyzer. By default, Media 
Analyzer is turned off because it tends to be a 
drain on your computer’s memory. To turn on 
the Media Analyzer so that you can use the 
Image Tags feature, use the Media Analysis 
Preferences, as we explain in Book I, Chapter 4.
	
Using the Media Analyzer with a large catalog of 
files is especially burdensome to your system 
and can slow the performance of Elements. So 
unless you really need the Media Analyzer, you 
can keep it turned off in the Media Analysis 
Preferences.
In the Image Tags panel, Elements has pre­
defined tags created for you, such as Two Faces, 
High Quality, Close Up, In Focus, and more. 
When you choose one of these tags from the 
pop-up menu that appears when you click in the 
text box, Elements displays all the predefined 
tags; see Figure 3-14. When you run the Media 
Analyzer, these tag names are used to automati­
cally tag photos. For example, the Media 
Analyzer searches through the photos for Two 
Faces, High Quality, and people names, and 
when Elements thinks a photo matches an item, 
it tags the photo automatically.
You can add more image tags by typing a new 
keyword in the Image Tags panel text box and 
then clicking the Add button.
The benefit of having image tags is that you can search any of the image tags 
in the Search item at the top of the Organizer window. When searching one 
of the criteria associated with Image Tags, Elements reports the number of 
found instances in the Search text box.
Rating Images with Stars
You can rate photos in the Organizer by tagging images with one to five 
stars. You might give exceptional photos a five-star rating and poor photos 
with lighting and focus problems one star. If you use stars to rate your 
Figure 3-14: Click in the text 
box and a pop-up menu 
displays the predefined tags 
and additional tag names you 
add using the Tags panel.

154
Working with Albums
photos, you can use the star rating as search cri­
teria. Here’s how star ratings work:
	
✓	Giving a file a star rating: Select a photo in 
the Media Browser and click Information in 
the Tags panel, shown in Figure 3-15. In the 
General pane, shown at the top of the panel, 
click a star. We clicked the fifth star, giving 
this file a five-star rating.
	
✓	Searching based on star ratings: At the top 
of the Organizer window, you see Ratings 
followed by five stars. This item is used for 
searching images and not for rating them. 
After you rate files, you can search for all 
files with, for example, a three-star rating 
and above. Only those images rated with 
three, four, or five stars appear in the Media 
Browser. See Chapter 2 of this minibook for 
more details about searching in the 
Organizer.
	
If you need to look up other data about your images, the Information panel is 
a great resource, as you can see in the other panes shown in Figure 3-15. See 
the nearby sidebar “Checking out image information” for details.
Working with Albums
Albums allow you to organize your photos in a way that’s different from key­
word tags or stars. Albums basically give you a special place to put photos 
you want to group together, no matter what the content or quality of the 
image is. You may want to organize an album for sharing photos with others 
on Adobe Revel, for creating a slide show, or just as a temporary holding 
spot.
	
The term album in Photoshop Elements nomenclature refers to a collection 
of images that aren’t yet integrated into projects, such as photo books and 
photo collages. See Book IX for details about the projects you can create via 
the Create panel.
In the following sections, you find out a bit more about the benefits of 
albums and how to create and add photos to an album.
Figure 3-15: The Information 
panel.

Working with Albums
Exploring album benefits
Creating albums affords you many different exciting things that you can do 
with a collection of photos. Here are just a few ways that you might find 
albums helpful as you work in Elements:
	
✓	Share your albums with friends and family. Host albums online for oth­
ers to view your photos, or write albums to CDs and DVDs (Windows) 
that you can view on your television set, on an Apple TV (Mountain Lion 
or greater Mac OS), or another device for television viewing. In short, 
albums help you assemble a collection of photos that you can view on 
many devices and share with others. We explain much more about 
albums in Book IX, Chapter 1.
	
✓	View albums as slide shows, as we explain in Chapter 2 of this 
minibook. 
Checking out image information
Image properties appear in the Information 
panel. By default, the panel is open when you 
view keyword tags.
The Information panel offers information about 
your files, including
	✓	Captions: You type captions for photos in 
the text box.
	✓	Name: The filename appears in a text box, 
and it is editable. You can change file­
names by editing the text.
	✓	Notes: If you want to add notes to images, 
you can type in the Notes text box.
	✓	Rating files: You can assign ratings to files, 
as we describe in the nearby section “Rat­
ing Images with Stars.”
	✓	Size: The file size is reported in the panel.
	✓	Date: The panel reports the date the pic­
ture was shot, a canvas was created, or a 
picture was scanned.
	✓	Directory path: The panel displays the di­
rectory path for the file location on your 
hard drive.
	✓	Audio: If the file contains a sound, the 
sound information is displayed.
	✓	Metadata: Metadata, such as the camera 
data, are reported when you click the right 
arrow to open the Metadata pane.
	✓	History: Open the History pane by clicking 
the right arrow, and you see the media’s file 
history, such as date last modified, import 
date, import source, and the current location.

156
Working with Albums
	
✓	Group a collection of images with different tags.
	
✓	Assemble a collection of photos to use in a project and then later trash 
the album (without deleting the photos). Albums serve you well for 
quick assembly of different projects. After you add photos to an album, 
you don’t need to be concerned with searching through a catalog when 
assembling a project.
Creating an album
To create an album, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Sort photos in the Media Browser to find the photos you want to 
include in a new album.
	
	 In addition to tags and stars, discussed earlier in this chapter, Elements 
offers a variety of search and viewing options (discussed in Chapter 2 of 
this minibook) to help you track down specific photos in a large catalog.
	
2.	 Click the plus (+) icon at the top of the left panel, as shown in 
Figure 3-16.
Figure 3-16: Click the plus (+) icon to open the drop-down menu.
	
3.	 From the drop-down menu, click New Album.
	
	 Notice in Figure 3-16 that you see the Albums menu on the left side of 
the Organizer window. When you create a new album, the remaining 
work you perform on an album — such as naming the album, categoriz­
ing the album, adding content to an album, and sharing an album — is 
all handled in the Panel Bin on the right side of the Organizer window. 
	
	 The location of the menu is different than earlier versions of Elements, 
where the menu and the album options were all contained in the Panel Bin.

157

Working with Albums
	
4.	 Name the new album.
	
	 In the Panel Bin, you see the New Album panel. Type a name for the 
album in the Album Name text box, as shown in Figure 3-17.
Figure 3-17: Filling in the Album Name text box.
What happened to Smart Albums?
In previous versions of Elements, we had a 
feature called Smart Albums, where Elements 
automatically added photos to your Smart 
Album as you imported them and tagged the 
photos with similar tags.
In Elements 12, you won’t find Smart Albums. 
Adobe feels that when you create a search 
and save your searches, the process is very 
similar to creating Smart Albums; therefore a 
bit of redundancy is removed from this ver­
sion of Elements. Whether you agree or not, 
unfortunately you won’t find Smart Albums in 
Elements 12.

158
Working with Albums
	
5.	 Drag photos from the Media Browser to the Content pane in the New 
Album panel, as shown in Figure 3-17.
	
	 Because we first started the steps to create an album with a star-rating 
sort, the only photos in the Media Browser are those files with a three or 
greater star rating. If you didn’t sort files, you can do so now or simply 
pick and choose which photos to add to the new album from photos 
appearing in your catalog. If you want to include all photos in the Media 
Browser, press Ctrl+A/⌘+A to select all or choose Edit➪Select All. After 
the files are selected, drag them to the Content pane in the New Album 
panel (see Figure 3-17). If you don’t have files sorted, click one or more 
photos and drag them to the Content pane. Repeat dragging photos until 
you have all photos you want to include in your new album.
	
6.	 Click Done at the bottom of the panel.
	
	 Your new album now appears listed in the Albums panel.
That’s it! Your new album is created, and the photos you drag to the album 
are added to it. You can isolate all the photos within a given album by click­
ing the album name in the Albums panel.
	
Creating multiple albums uses only a fraction of the disk space that would be 
required if you wanted to duplicate photos for multiple purposes, such as 
printing, web hosting, sharing, and so on.
Using albums for temporary work
As you explore various features in Photoshop Elements, you may want to 
explore some of the creation and sharing items in the Create and Share pan­
els. As you peruse the options, first create an album and add photos to it. 
Then proceed to explore the many features Elements offers you.
When you finish your exploration, right-click (or Ctrl-click on a Macintosh 
with a one-button mouse) to open a context menu and choose Delete album 
name. You can add an album for temporary work and then delete the album 
when you no longer need it.
Editing an album
After creating an album, you may want to change the album name, add more 
photos to an album, delete some photos from an album, change the album 
category, or do some other kind of edit. 

159
Book II 
Chapter 3
Organizing Images 
with Tags, Albums, 
and More
Working with Albums
Your first step in performing any kind of edit to an album is to look at the left 
side of the Organizer window. In the Import panel, you see a list of albums 
under the Albums category. To edit an album, open a context menu on an 
album name and click Edit. After clicking Edit, the album appears in the 
Panel Bin on the right side of the Organizer window, much like you see in 
Figure 3-17.
Other commands are available on the context menu you open from an album 
name in the Import panel. You can rename an album, delete an album, and 
add more media to your album.
	
If you want to use the context menu commands, you must close the New 
Album panel in the Panel Bin. While this panel is open, you can’t open a con­
text menu on an album name. Click either Done or Cancel to close the New 
Album panel in the Panel Bin.

o edit an image, your first step is to open an existing image or create a 
new one. It sounds simple, and it is. The same goes for saving images: 
Many times, you can just choose your favorite way of invoking the Save 
command that you find in almost any program. So why did we write a whole 
chapter about creating and saving images? Here are two reasons:
	
✓	First of all, Elements is packed with specialized tools. 
You’ll find it helpful to know what commands and tools 
are at your disposal for opening, creating, and sav­
ing images. The primary focus of this chapter is 
introducing you to these commands and tools 
and explaining the basics of how they work.
	
✓	Secondly, you need to know when to pay atten­
tion to the options in the New and Save dialog 
boxes. When you create or save an image file, 
many of the options that you see exist for differ­
ent outputs — namely, for prints or for display­
ing images online. As you walk through the basic 
steps for using the tools in this chapter, we point 
out when you need to understand an important 
image-editing concept (and where to find an explana­
tion) so that your final image looks its best in your desired 
output.

Opening an Image in the Photo Editor
	
As you start learning how to create and edit your images — or even after you 
become pros like us — you’re bound to make mistakes. As you begin your 
journey into image editing, this chapter bestows you with the magical gift of 
Undo. Elements’ sophisticated Undo tools enable you to wipe away your 
errors in myriad ways. Whenever your image-editing experiments go awry, 
remember that you can undo. Then flip to this chapter for help.
Opening an Image in the Photo Editor
You may have a single photo that you want to edit without adding it to the 
Organizer. Perhaps you just want to apply some edits to an image you have 
on a media source or on your hard drive and then send it off via e-mail or 
share the photo using one of several supported sharing services.
In this case, you can bypass the Organizer and start in the Photo Editor. To 
open an image in the Photo Editor, do the following:
	
1.	 Launch Photoshop Elements.
	
	 If you open the Welcome screen, click the Photo Editor button to open 
the Photo Editor. If you’re in the Organizer, click Editor at the bottom of 
the Organizer window.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Open. Alternatively, you can click Open at the top of the 
Tools panel.
	
3.	 (Optional) If you want to search for photos saved within a given for­
mat, open the All Formats drop-down list (Format pop-up menu on the 
Mac) and choose the format for a file you want to open.
	
	 Selecting a format narrows the files displayed to only those files saved in 
the selected format. For example, if you have Camera Raw, JPEG, and 
TIFF images in a folder and you want to open only a JPEG file, you can 
select JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG, *.JPE) from the All Formats drop-down list 
(or JPEG from the Format pop-up menu [Mac]). Doing so displays only 
files saved in the format you choose.
	
	 If you’re not sure what format the file you want to open is, leave the 
default choice from the menu at All Formats.
	
	 Macintosh users have an advantage here when searching for files. When 
you arrive at the Open dialog box (File➪Open or ⌘+O), you can use the 
Mac OS search feature, Spotlight, in the upper-right corner of the Open 
dialog box. Of course, if you haven’t renamed your image from the 
default camera name (such as img_3012.jpg), you’ll likely have a hard 
time remembering what filename to use in your search terms.

Opening an Image in the Photo Editor
	
4.	 From the list of photo files displayed, click the photo you want to 
open.
	
5.	 Click the Open button in the Open dialog box.
	
	 The file opens in the Photo Editor.
Using Open As
You may have a photo that was saved as a JPEG, TIFF, or some other format 
without a file extension or an incorrect file extension for the file type. You 
may not see the file listed in the Open dialog box, but you know it’s there 
and what format the file is. In this case, you can try to use the Open As 
command.
Choose File➪Open As, and the Open As dialog box opens, providing you 
with the same options as the Open dialog box. Choose a format from the 
Open As drop-down list (the Format pop-up menu on the Mac) and click the 
file you want to open. Click Open and see whether it works. In some cases, 
Elements may not recognize the file if it’s damaged. In other cases, you may 
be able to resurrect a damaged file.
	
One advantage to using the Open As command is opening images in Camera 
Raw. You can open any photo (JPEG, TIFF, and so on) in the Camera Raw 
converter even if your camera didn’t originally capture the photo in Camera 
Raw. We cover all you want to know about Camera Raw, and why this would 
be an advantage when editing photos, in Book III, Chapter 4.
Opening recently edited files
A quick way to open recently edited files is to choose File➪Open Recently 
Edited File. The submenu lists these files. The number of files appearing in 
the submenu is determined in Preferences, as we explain in Book I, Chapter 4.
If the file you want to open appears on the submenu, click the filename in the 
list, and the file opens in the Photo Editor.
	
The Recently Edited Files list also appears in the Organizer. If you want to 
open a recently edited image while in the Organizer workspace, choose 
File➪Open Recently Edited File and select the file you want to open. The file 
opens in the Photo Editor.
Opening an image within another image
In Elements, opening one image file inside another image is called placing an 
image file. You may have a piece of artwork you want to add to a photo. The 

166
Opening an Image in the Photo Editor
artwork can be of any file type you find for the supported formats that you 
can open in Elements. Quite often, you may find a vector art drawing or a 
PDF file that contains the artwork you want to import into your current 
image file; however, you can use any of the supported formats for placing 
content on a photo.
For more information on placing PDF files, see our Web Extra on creating 
custom calendars at www.dummies.com/extras/photoshopelements12.
	
Before you place an image inside another image, you’ll find it helpful to know 
whether you’re working with vector versus raster art and how that impacts 
your ability to resize the placed image. Flip to Book III, Chapter 2, for an 
introduction to vector and raster images and image sizing.
	
Note that when you place an image, no matter what file format, it’s inserted 
into your open file as a Smart Object. Smart Objects are essentially com­
posed of two files, one inside the other, enabling the image’s source data, 
whether pixel- or vector-based, to be embedded. Adobe uses the analogy of 
a new file, the child, which is embedded into the original file, the parent. 
What does this all mean to you? It means that you can repeatedly transform 
(size, skew, rotate) your image without losing any additional image quality 
because Elements uses your original source data to render the transforma­
tion and the Smart Object updates dynamically as you make edits. One 
caveat: With vector images, you can size up and down repeatedly and never 
worry about losing quality. With raster images, however, you can safely 
resize repeatedly, but you don’t want to size larger than your original dimen­
sions or else you risk resampling or degradation.
To place content in Elements, use the Place command as follows:
	
1.	 Open an image file in the Photo Editor.
	
	 You must start with a file open in the Photo Editor to use the Place 
command.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Place.
	
	 The Place dialog box opens. This dialog box has the same options you 
find in the Open dialog box.
	
3.	 Select a file to place.
	
	 Your file can be an image format, EPS, Adobe Illustrator (AI) or other 
type of vector format, PDF, or any other file type you see listed in the 
Files of Type drop-down list (Windows) or Format pop-up menu (Mac).

4.	 Click Place.
	
	 When you place an image, you see handles around the image that can be 
used for sizing the image, as shown in Figure 1-1. Smart Objects always 
import into your file with an X over the image, which distinguishes them 
from regular images.
Figure 1-1: A placed image.
	
5.	 Size and position the image.
	
	 If you import a vector art image or PDF file containing vector art, you 
can drag the corner handles out to size up the image without losing 
image quality. Press the Shift key when sizing the image to constrain 
proportions and press the Enter (Return) key to accept your resizing 
edits. Click the image and move it to the desired position.

Creating a New Image
	
6.	 Press Return and commit your layer.
	
	 The small black-and-white Smart Objects icon is in the lower-right 
corner of your layer thumbnail in the Layers panel.
	
Before you start creating new images from various sources and tools in 
Elements, we also suggest that you check out how layers work (see Book V) 
and see how the Photomerge tools help you combine images (see Book VIII, 
Chapter 3).
	
If you open a Camera Raw 16-bit image, you cannot place artwork on the photo. 
You must first convert the 16-bit image to an 8-bit image by choosing Image➪
Mode➪8 Bits/Channel. For more on 8-bit and 16-bit images, see Book III, 
Chapter 5.
Creating a New Image
In Elements, you can create a new image from a totally blank canvas or from 
data you copied to the Clipboard. When you start with a fresh, new canvas, 
you can copy and paste content from other pictures, place objects, add 
shapes, and/or add text to create your own scene. To begin the process, you 
create a new image.
In either the Photo Editor or the Organizer, choose File➪New➪Blank File. 
Additionally you can open the Open drop-down menu in the Photo Editor 
and choose New Blank File. If you start in the Organizer, Elements switches 
workspaces from the Organizer to the Photo Editor, and the New dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 1-2.
The options you have here are covered thoroughly in Book III, Chapter 2. 
Look over that chapter for details on the options you have for creating new, 
blank files.
In Elements, you can also create a new image from data you copy to the 
Clipboard. If you copy data from somewhere else — such as text in Office 
applications or objects in Office applications, illustration programs, and 
other types of applications — Elements can convert the data on the 
Clipboard to a new image.

For example, you might want to copy a photo and save it as a new image 
when a family member posts a picture on Facebook or in another online 
album-sharing tool. You can create a new image from the photo you’ve cop­
ied and save it to your computer’s hard drive. 
Follow these steps to copy a photo from a web page, such as Facebook, and 
create a new file that you can add to your Organizer catalog:
	
1.	 Log on to your Facebook, Flickr, Adobe Revel, or iCloud account, or 
another website where you can freely use an image.
	
	 Remember to observe copyright laws when copying online images. You 
should have permission to use the images you copy.
	
2.	 Right-click a photo to open a context menu. (Ctrl-click on a Mac with a 
one-button mouse.)
	
3.	 Choose Copy (Internet Explorer) or Copy Image (in Firefox or Safari), 
as shown in Figure 1-3.

Undoing in Elements
Using the steps outlined here, you can grab a bunch of images from a family 
member’s online account without having to load images from a removable 
device or a media card.
Undoing in Elements
Back in 1984, Apple Computer brought windowing interfaces to the masses 
with the introduction of the Macintosh computer. Also tucked into that inter­
face was the Undo command. Both innovations revolutionized the way peo­
ple use personal computers. Together with the Cut, Copy, and Paste 
commands, these features became a standard in all programs that followed. 
Being able to undo your most recent edit in a program like Elements gives 
you the freedom to experiment, as well as the chance to correct mistakes 
immediately. Adobe broadened that initial Undo feature in Photoshop 
Elements so that you can retrace an entire series of editing steps with multi­
ple undo actions, see a visual list of edits in the History panel, and work with 
different editing states.
In the following sections, you explore the many ways you can branch out, 
experiment a little, and retrace your editing steps (or overcome a series of 
editing mistakes) without having to save multiple versions of your photos.
Undoing what’s done with the Undo command
	
As you might expect, the Undo command is found on the Edit menu. To undo 
an editing step, you simply choose Edit➪Undo or press Ctrl+Z or ⌘+Z. This 
simple command helps you correct a mistake or toss away an experimental 
edit that doesn’t work for you.
When you open the Edit menu, you find the Undo command at the top of the 
menu. In addition, you find the name of the edit you last applied to the 
image. Figure 1-5 shows that we just applied a fill within a selection. On the 
Edit menu, the menu command appears as Undo Fill.
You also have a command for Redo on the Edit menu. If you choose Undo 
from the Edit menu or press Ctrl+Z (⌘+Z) and then change your mind, you 
can always just redo that last undo: Choose Redo or press Ctrl+Y (⌘+Y), and 
the last undo returns to the state before you chose to undo the edit.

172
Undoing in Elements
Figure 1-5: The Undo command appears listed on the Edit menu with the name of the last edit 
applied to the document.
The number of redos you have is the same as the number of undos. By 
default, you can undo and thus redo up to 50 edits at a time. See Book I, 
Chapter 4, for details about changing the default in the Elements 
Performance Preferences pane.
Reverting to what’s saved
At times, rather than undo a bunch of edits, you just want to toss all the 
edits away and return to the last saved version of your file. The Revert com­
mand on the Edit menu returns you to the last saved version of your photo.
If you make several edits and you like what you see, you can choose File➪Save 
or press Ctrl+S (⌘+S) to save your edits. If you then make several more edits 
and you don’t like the results, choose Edit➪Revert to revert to the last save.

173
Book III 
Chapter 1
Creating, Undoing, 
and Saving Images
Undoing in Elements
	
In many Adobe programs, you find a Revert command listed on the File 
menu. In Photoshop Elements, however, the Revert command is listed on the 
Edit menu. Keep this in mind when you perform edits in the Editor’s Expert 
mode.
Working with the almighty History panel
Using menu commands and keyboard shortcuts enables you to travel back 
and forward in time to undo and redo edits using single menu choices or 
keyboard shortcuts for each undo/redo.
	
The History panel, on the other hand, gives you a capability that menu com­
mands don’t: You can target an undo (or redo) to go back (or forward) to a 
specific edit. For example, if you create a selection, apply an enhancement 
edit (such as changing image brightness), and then apply a filter, you can 
return to the selection with one mouse click. Instead of choosing Undo to 
undo the filter and Undo again to undo the image brightness, you simply 
click the selection edit in the History panel.
The following steps walk you through the process of undoing and redoing 
history states with the History panel:
	
1.	 To open the History panel, choose Window➪History.
	
	 The History panel opens, as shown in Figure 1-6. As you make edits on 
an image, each edit is shown as a history state in the list in the panel.
Figure 1-6: The History panel.

174
Undoing in Elements
	
2.	 To return to an earlier edit in the History 
panel, find the history state you want to 
return to in the list and click it. 
	
	 For example, say that you applied a number 
of edits with the Clone Stamp tool and then 
decided that the overall effect looked too 
splotchy. If you want to return to the original 
edit with the Clone Stamp and start over, 
click its corresponding history state in the 
History panel, as shown in Figure 1-7, and 
your image returns to that state in the image 
window.
	
3.	 If you decide that you went back too far in 
the list of history states, you can redo any 
grayed-out history states by clicking the 
most recent state you want to redo.
	
	 In our example, if we decide we want to redo 
the next two history states below the cur­
rently selected one in Figure 1-7, we’d simply 
click the third instance of the Clone Stamp in 
the list. That would restore the second and 
third use of the Clone Stamp in the list.
	
	 As long as your history states remain in the list in the History panel, you 
can click backward or forward to undo and redo edits.
You may need to manage the number of history states that appear in the 
History panel. By default, the panel provides 50 history states. When you 
come to the 51st edit, the first edit in the sequence is deleted from the panel, 
and you can’t return to that state. As you make more new edits, you continu­
ally delete edits from the top of the panel. If you’re making a lot of compli­
cated edits to an image, you might be surprised by how quickly you use up 
all 50 states.
To manage the available history states in the History panel, you have the fol­
lowing options:
	
✓	Increase the number of available history states. To do so, open the 
Performance preferences and change the value in the History States text 
box, as we explain in Book I, Chapter 4.
	
	As you increase history states in the Performance preferences, the amount 
of memory required by Elements is increased. You may find the program 
getting sluggish if you significantly increase the number of history states.
Figure 1-7: Click the item in the 
list that you want to return to 
so that you can undo a series 
of edits.

Chapter 1

Saving Files
	
✓	Delete certain history states that you’re certain you no longer need. 
You may have applied a series of edits to a document and then want to 
return to an earlier history state. Suppose that you no longer need all 
the history states made after the one to which you return. (This might 
happen if you’re experimenting with different edits and viewing the 
results.) If you know that the history states following a particular state 
are no longer needed, you can delete those history states from the list.
	
•	 To delete the last history state in the History panel, click the history 
state in the list and then right-click to open a context menu. From the 
menu choices, choose Delete. The selected history state is deleted 
from the list.
	
•	 If you have a series of history states that you want to delete from the 
list, click the first history state within a given list of edits to open a 
context menu. Then, when you choose Delete, you delete all the his­
tory states in the list that follow as well as the selected history state.
	
	Keep in mind that all history states following a history state you target 
for deletion are deleted when you open a context menu and choose 
Delete.
	
	If you want to delete a series of edits that are followed by edits you want 
to retain, you have to delete the unwanted edits individually. 
	
✓	Clear the entire history. If you don’t need any of the history states in 
the History panel, open a context menu and choose Clear History. The 
list is cleared until you start editing your image again.
	
	You also clear a file’s history each time you save and close the image 
file. If you apply a number of edits and just choose File➪Save, the his­
tory states remain in the list of edits applied to the document before you 
last saved it. Therefore you can undo edits after saving a file, as long as 
the file remains open. However, if you close the file and reopen it, the 
History panel is cleared.
Saving Files
In almost any program, the Save (or Save As) dialog box is a familiar place 
where you make choices about the file to be saved. In Elements (as in most 
other programs), choose Save when you want to save changes you’ve made 
to the current image, overwriting the original. Choose Save As when you 
want to save a copy of your image to edit and retain the original file.
To use the Save/Save As dialog box, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open an image and choose File➪Save for files to be saved the first 
time or choose File➪Save As for any file. 

176
Saving Files
	
	 Either command opens a dialog box for you.
	
	 One exception: If you need to save a smaller version of a file for the 
web, you use a different dialog box than you do when you’re saving files 
for other output. Choose File➪Save for Web; the Save for Web dialog box 
opens. Flip to Book III, Chapter 3, for details about how to use the Save 
for Web dialog box.
	
2.	 In the Filename (Windows) or Save As (Mac) box, type a name for your 
file in the text box if you haven’t saved the file yet or would like to 
save it under a different name.
	
	 This item is common to all Save dialog boxes.
	
3.	 (Optional) From the Format drop-down list or pop-up menu, select a 
file format. 
	
	 If you do nothing to an image in terms of converting its color mode or 
changing bit depth (topics I explain in Book III, Chapters 3 and 5, respec­
tively), you can save your edits to a file in the same format in which the 
file was opened. 
	
	 However, in many circumstances, you open an image and prepare it for 
some form of output (web or print), which requires more thought about 
the kind of file format you use in saving the file.
	
	 For example, some format types require you to convert a color mode 
before you can use the format. Therefore a relationship exists between 
file formats and saving files. Additionally, bit depths in images also 
relate to the kinds of file formats you can use in saving files. Last but not 
least, not all file formats support all the Elements features. For example, 
if you add layers as you edit a file and want to preserve the layers for 
future editing, you need to save your file in a format that supports 
layers.
	
	 Before you go too far in Elements, we recommend familiarizing yourself 
with the file formats you use and the conversions you need to make to 
save in one format or another (as we explain in Book III, Chapter 3). 
	
	 If you save in JPEG format, be aware that JPEG uses a lossy compression 
scheme, meaning that image data is tossed away with each save. 
Repeated saves from the same JPEG image degrade the image. After you 
open a JPEG file that was shot with your camera, save the file as PSD 
(Photoshop format). You can edit and save the file without losing data. 
When you need a final image in JPEG, use the Save As command and 
save in JPEG format. You can always return to the PSD file to edit more 
and then save again in JPEG format for output. To find out more about 
converting JPEG to other formats, see the section about exporting files 
in Book III, Chapter 3.
	
4.	 (Optional) Set your options in the Save Options area.

Closing and Quitting
	
	 You see the following choices:
	
•	 Include in the Organizer: If you want the file added to the Organizer, 
select this check box.
	
•	 Save in Version Set with Original: You can edit images and save a 
version of your image, but only in the Photo Editor’s Quick mode. 
When you save the file from Quick mode, this check box is active. 
Select the box, and a version of the original is saved and appears in 
the Organizer.
	
•	 Color: Select the check box for the ICC (International Color 
Consortium) Profile. Depending on which profile you use, the option 
appears for sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is 
selected, the profile is embedded in the image. See Book III, Chapter 5, 
for an introduction to color profiles; Book IX, Chapter 2, explains 
how to use color profiles when you print.
	
•	 Thumbnail (Windows): If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can 
see a miniature representation of your image when viewing it in fold­
ers or on the desktop. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving 
Files preferences, the check box can be selected or deselected. If 
you’re choosing an option for Never Save or Always Save in the 
Preferences dialog box, this check box is selected or deselected for 
you and is grayed out. You need to return to the Preferences dialog 
box if you want to change the option. See Book I, Chapter 4, for help 
with preferences.
	
•	 Use Lower Case Extension (Windows): File extensions give you a 
clue to which file format was used when a file was saved. Elements 
automatically adds the extension to the filename for you. Your 
choices are to use uppercase or lowercase letters for the extension 
name. Select the Use Lower Case Extension check box for lowercase 
or deselect the check box if you want to use uppercase characters in 
the filename. Lowercase extensions are preferable when you work 
with images that are hosted on websites.
	
5.	 When you’re done selecting your options, click Save.
Closing and Quitting
You should understand a few important details when closing files and quit­
ting Elements:
	
✓	When you’re in the Photo Editor and have an image open in the image 
window, you can close the image without quitting the Photo Editor work­
space. Click the X button in the upper-right corner of the Image window or 
the red button in the upper-left corner (Mac), and the open file is closed. If 
the images appear as tabs in the image Window, click the X to the right of 
the filename (Windows) or left of the filename (Mac).

178
Closing and Quitting
	
✓	If you click the X (red button) in the upper-right corner of the Photo 
Editor workspace (Windows) or choose Photoshop Elements➪Quit on 
the Mac, you quit the Photo Editor. Alternatively, you can press Alt+F4 
(Windows) or Ctrl+Q (⌘+Q on a Mac).
	
✓	If you happen to have the Organizer and the Photo Editor open and you 
quit one workspace, the other workspace remains open. For example, if 
the Organizer and the Photo Editor are both open when you quit the 
Organizer, the Photo Editor remains open and vice versa.
	
✓	If you make an edit on a photo in the Photo Editor and decide to quit the 
Photo Editor, Elements prompts you to save the file before quitting.
	
✓	If you have the Welcome screen open as well as the Organizer and the 
Photo Editor, quitting both the Organizer and the Photo Editor doesn’t 
get you out of Elements. The Welcome screen remains open even though 
you’ve quit the workspaces.
	
✓	To completely shut down Elements, take a look at the status bar 
(Windows) or the Dock (Mac). If you see one workspace open, click the 
respective item in the status bar (or Dock) and then choose File➪Quit, 
click the Close button (Windows), or press Ctrl+Q (⌘+Q on the Mac).

hen you open a picture in Photoshop Elements, you’re looking at a 
huge mass of pixels. These pixels are tiny, colored squares, and the 
number of pixels in a picture determines the picture’s resolution. This rela­
tionship between pixels and resolution — important to understand in all your 
Elements work — relates to creating selections (as we explain in Book IV), 
printing files (Book IX, Chapter 2), and sharing files (Book IX, Chapter 3).
This chapter explains some essential points about resolution and 
image sizes and displaying images onscreen, especially in 
terms of the way these points affect how you end up mod­
ifying your images.
Examining Images Closely
Files you open in Elements are composed of thou­
sands or even millions of tiny, square pixels. Each 
pixel has one, and only one, color value. The 
arrangement of the pixels of different shades and 
colors creates an illusion for your eyes when you’re 
viewing an image onscreen. For example, you may have 
black and white pixels arranged in an order that creates 
the impression that you’re looking at something gray — not 
at all those tiny black and white squares.
Just about everything you do in Elements has to do with changing pixels. 
You surround them with selection tools to select what appear to be objects 
in your image, you make pixels darker or lighter to change contrast and 

180
Examining Images Closely
brightness, you change the shades and tints of pixels for color correction, 
and you perform a host of other possible editing tasks.
We have another term to throw at you when talking about pixels and 
Elements files: Your pictures are raster images. When you have pixels, you 
have raster data. If you open a file in Elements that isn’t made of pixels, 
Elements can rasterize the data. In other words, Elements can convert other 
data to pixels if the document wasn’t originally composed of pixels.
In addition to raster data, you can find vector data, which we talk more 
about in the section “Looking at raster versus vector images,” later in this 
chapter.
	
To use most of the tools and commands in Elements, you must be working 
on a raster image file. If your data isn’t rasterized, many tools and com­
mands are unavailable.
Understanding resolution
The number of pixels per inch (ppi) in a file determines its image resolution. 
If you have 72 pixels across a 1-inch horizontal line, your image resolution is 
72 ppi. If you have 300 pixels in 1 inch, your image resolution is 300 ppi.
	
Image resolution is critical to properly outputting files when
	
✓	You print images: If the resolution is too low, the image prints poorly. If 
the image resolution is too high, you waste time and memory processing 
all the data that needs to be sent to your printer.
	
✓	You show images onscreen: Just as an image has an inherent resolution 
in its file, your computer monitor has an inherent — fixed — resolution 
at which it displays everything you see onscreen. Many computer moni­
tors display images at 72 ppi (or 85 or 96 ppi) while newer computers 
such as the Apple’s Retina displays show images with resolutions up to 
227 ppi. With newer devices, such as cellphones and tablets, image reso­
lution rises significantly. What’s important to know is that you can 
always best display photos on your computer monitor at a 72-ppi image 
size in a 100-percent view. On cellphones and tablets, you need to look 
over the device specifications to see what the optimum resolution is for 
each device.
	
	As an example for viewing images on computer monitors, take a look at 
Figure 2-1: You see an image reduced to 50 percent and then at different 
zoom sizes. When the size changes, the resolution display on your moni­
tor changes. When the size is 100 percent, you see the image in an opti­
mum view. The 100-percent size represents the image displayed on your 
monitor at 72 ppi, regardless of the resolution of the file.

181

Chapter 2
Specifying Resolution 
and Changing 
Image Sizing
Examining Images Closely
Figure 2-1: The same image, viewed at different zoom levels.
This relationship between the image resolution and viewing the image at dif­
ferent zoom levels is tricky but vital. If, for example, you grab an image off 
the web and zoom in on it, you may see a view like the 800-percent view 
shown in Figure 2-1. If you acquire a digital camera image, you may need to 
zoom out to a 16-percent view to fit the entire image into the image window.
These displays vary so much because of image resolution. That image you 
grabbed off the web may be a 2-inch-square image at 72 ppi, and that digital 
camera image may be a 10-x-15-inch image at 240 ppi. You have to zoom in 
on the 240-ppi image if you want to fill the entire window with it — but when 
you zoom in, the resolution is lowered. The more you zoom in, the lower the 
resolution on your monitor.
	
When you zoom into or out of an image, you change the resolution as it 
appears on your monitor. No resolution changes are made to the file. The 
image resolution remains the same until you use one of the Elements tools to 
reduce or increase image resolution.
Understanding image dimensions
Image dimensions involve the physical size of your file. If the size is 4 x 5 
inches, for example, the file can be one of any number of resolution values. 
After the file is open in Elements, you can change the dimensions of an 
image, the resolution, or both.

182
Using the Image Size Command
When you change only the dimensions of an image (not the number of pixels 
it contains), an inverse relationship exists between the physical size of your 
image and the resolution: As image size increases, resolution decreases. 
Conversely, when you reduce the image size, you raise resolution.
Understanding camera megapixels
Digital-camera image resolution is measured in megapixels (millions of pix­
els) and is a factor in image size. If you have a 6-megapixel camera, the full-
resolution images from your camera are about 3000 x 2000 pixels. The file 
size for a 6-megapixel image is about 5.7MB.
On the screen, the resolution of many digital camera images is 72 ppi (pixels 
per inch). Using the 6-megapixel image as an example, the resolution at 72 
ppi produces an image that measures a little more than 41 x 27 inches. 
Regardless of whether your camera or cellphone takes pictures at 3, 5, or 8 
megapixels or more, many images are captured at 72 ppi, but the dimensions 
vary according to the total number of pixels captured. With other cameras, 
you may find image resolutions like 230 ppi or some other variation. The 
higher resolutions typically produce images of smaller physical sizes.
Looking at raster versus vector images
Elements supports working with vector data in addition to raster data. 
Whereas raster data carries with it a fixed resolution, vector objects are not 
resolution-dependent. What does this mean, and more importantly, what 
advantages come from working with vector data?
A vector object might be a line of text or a shape that you add to a photo 
from an assortment of vector shapes. When you size vector text and shapes 
in Elements, the resizing has no effect on resolution. In other words, you can 
make a line of text or a shape as large as you want, and when the photo is 
printed, the text and shapes print clearly without distortion. Text and 
shapes remain resolution-independent until you flatten the layers. Then the 
shapes are converted to pixels and appear as raster images.
Vector images are created with mathematical algorithms instead of pixels, 
and thus are usually illustrations, line drawings, and basic shapes or letters. 
(You can’t take or save a photo of your family as a vector image.)
Using the Image Size Command
When an image is too large, you need to reduce its resolution, physical size, 
or both. Or you may need a higher resolution to output an image at a larger 
size. This method of sizing — changing the size as well as the number of 
pixels — is called resampling an image.

183
Book III 
Chapter 2
Specifying Resolution 
and Changing  
Image Sizing
Using the Image Size Command
	
You can reduce resolution by sampling fewer pixels (downsampling) or raise 
resolution by adding more pixels to the sample (upsampling).
	
Use caution when you resample images; when you resample, you’re either 
tossing away pixels or manufacturing new pixels — and neither activity par­
ticularly benefits image quality. We discuss the sampling details in the section 
“Upsampling images,” later in this chapter.
Downsampling images
You can change an image’s size and 
resolution in a couple different 
ways. One method involves crop­
ping images. You can use the Crop 
tool with or without resampling 
images. (For more information on 
using the Crop tool, see the section 
“Using the Crop tool,” later in this 
chapter.) Another method involves 
the Image Size dialog box, which you 
use in many of your editing sessions 
in Elements.
When you use the Image Size dialog 
box to make an image smaller, you 
are downsampling the image. For 
example, you might downsample a 
high-resolution camera image from 
14 inches wide and 240 ppi to 7 
inches wide and 300 ppi before you 
send the image to a printing service. 
In Figure 2-2, you can see an image 
that was downsampled in Elements 
from more than 14 inches 
horizontal.
If you try to make an image larger, 
you are upsampling an image. Too 
much upsampling results in images 
of very poor quality, as shown in 
Figure 2-3.
Follow these steps to downsample 
an image in Elements:
	
1.	 Open a photo in the Photo Editor.
	
	 For these steps, you can use any photo you have handy.
Figure 2-2: Downsampling images usually 
produces satisfactory results.
Figure 2-3: Upsampling images produces very 
poor results.

184
Using the Image Size Command
	
2.	 Choose Image➪Resize➪Image 
Size.
	
	 Alternatively, you press 
Ctrl+Alt+I (⌘+Option+I on a 
Mac). The Image Size dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 2-4.
	
	 The Pixel Dimensions area in 
the Image Size dialog box 
shows the file size (such as 2MB 
[megabytes]). This number is 
the amount of space the image 
takes up on your hard drive. 
The width and height values are 
fixed unless you select the 
Resample Image check box at 
the bottom of the dialog box.
	
3.	 In the Document Size area, 
redefine the dimensions and 
resolution.
	
	 You have the following options:
 
• Width: Type a value in the text box to resize the image’s width; then, 
to implement the change, press Tab to move out of the field. From 
the drop-down list to the right of the text box, you can select a unit 
of measure: percent, inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, 
or columns.
 
• Height: The Height options are the same as the Width options, except 
there is no column setting. If you keep the sizing proportional — by 
selecting the Constrain Proportions check box — you typically edit 
either the Width or Height text box, but not both. When you alter 
either width or height, the resolution changes inversely.
 
• Resolution: Edit the text box to change resolution and press the Tab 
key to change the value. When you edit resolution, the Width and 
Height values are changed inversely (if the Constrain Proportions 
check box is selected).
	
4.	 If you’re okay with resampling your image to get the desired size, 
select the Resample Image check box.
	
	 With this check box selected, you can change dimensions and pixels at 
the same time, which results in reducing or increasing the number of 
pixels. When the check box is deselected, the values for dimensions are 
linked. Changing one value automatically changes the other values.
	
	 Before you resample your image, however, be sure to check out the 
following section.
Figure 2-4: Choose Image➪Resize➪Image 
Size to open the Image Size dialog box.

5.	 If you select the Resample Image check box, choose a resampling 
method as well as other resampling options.
	
	 In the drop-down menu, you find resampling-method choices. See Table 
2-1 for details. The two check boxes above the Resample Image check 
box become active when you select the Resample Image check box. 
Here’s what they do:
 
• Scale Styles: Elements has a Styles panel from which you can apply a 
variety of style effects to images. When you apply a style, such as a 
frame border, the border appears at a defined width. When you 
select the Scale Styles box and then resize the image, the Styles 
effect is also resized. Leaving the check box deselected keeps the 
style at the same size when the image is resized.
 
• Constrain Proportions: By default, this check box is selected; keep it 
that way unless you want to distort an image intentionally.
	
6.	 When you’re done selecting your options, click OK to resize your image.

You might use this option with gray­

Unless you find better results by 
using any of the other methods, 
leave the default at Bicubic.

This method improves on 
the Bicubic method, but 
you notice a little soften­

Upsampling images
	
As a general rule, reducing resolution is okay, but increasing resolution isn’t. 
If you need a higher-resolution image and you can go back to the original 
source (such as rescanning the image or reshooting a picture), try (if you can) 
to create a new file that has the resolution you want instead of resampling in 
Elements. Upsampling can severely degrade an image.

186
Using the Scale Command
	
If you start with an image that was originally sampled for a web page and 
you want to print a large poster, you can forget about using Elements or any 
other image editor. Upsampling low-resolution images often turns them to 
mush, as shown in Figure 2-3.
You may wonder whether upsampling is useful for any purpose. In some cases, 
yes, you can upsample with satisfactory results. You can experience better 
results with higher resolutions of 300 ppi and more if the upsampling size isn’t 
extraordinary. If all else fails, try applying a filter to a grainy, upsampled image 
to mask the problem. (Book VII, Chapter 1, has the details on filters.)
	
Some third-party tools do much better with upsampling images than the 
built-in sampling tools that Elements provides. For starters, take a look at 
OnOne Software’s Perfect Resize 7.5 (formerly Genuine Fractals) at www.
ononesoftware.com. When it’s absolutely necessary to upsample images, 
you’ll generally find favorable results using this product.
Using the Scale Command
When you open a photo in Elements, the photo rests on an underlying layer 
called the canvas. The canvas and the photo are at a 1:1 ratio. In essence, the 
canvas is the physical size of your image. You can keep the canvas size fixed 
while upsizing or downsizing the photo image. To do so requires using the 
Transformation tools.
Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform or press Ctrl+T (⌘+T on a Mac), 
and you see a number of handles on the sides of the transformation rectan­
gle. To scale a photo up or down, grab one of the four corner handles by 
clicking one and holding down the mouse button; then you can move the 
handle in or out to size the image down or up, respectively.
If you open a context menu after you’ve selected Free Transform, you find 
several transformation commands, as shown in Figure 2-5. Choose the Scale 
command to size an image up or down. As you drag the corner handles, the 
scaling is made while constraining proportions.
The end result of scaling images is the same as using the Image Size dialog 
box to upsample and downsample images. As you scale an image up, the 
image loses resolution. As you scale an image down, it gains resolution. 
Therefore, when scaling images up, be certain that the image resolution is 
sufficient to support the new size.

Choosing a Resolution for Print or Screen
Choosing a Resolution for Print or Screen
The importance of resolution in your Elements work is paramount when 
printing files. Good ol’ 72-ppi images can be forgiving, and you can get many 
of your large files scrunched down to 72 ppi for websites and slide shows. 
Printing images is another matter. Among the many different printing output 
devices, resolution requirements vary.
For your own desktop printer, plan to print a variety of test images at differ­
ent resolutions and on different papers. You can quickly determine the best 
file attributes by running tests. When you send files to service centers, ask 
the technicians what file attributes work best with their equipment.
For a starting point, look over the recommended resolutions for various out­
put devices listed in Table 2-2.

For more information on printing photos, see Book IX, Chapter 2.
Changing the Canvas Size
When you scale images, you maintain the same canvas size. You might (for 
example) have a canvas size set up for printing a photo — say, 8 x 10 inches — 
and want to make an image a bit larger on the canvas. You might also add 
other images to create a photo collage and need to scale those added images 
up or down, again keeping the same canvas size.
For that matter, you might want to keep the image size the same but increase 
the canvas size to accommodate an area to include type, some content from 
the Content panel, or additional images.
You can also crop the canvas size with the Crop tool. The Crop tool is a 
more visual method for sizing the canvas.

Changing the Canvas Size
Using the Canvas Size dialog box
To increase the canvas size, choose 
Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size. The 
Canvas Size dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 2-7. In this dialog 
box, you have several options to 
control, such as
	
✓	Current Size: The display for 
the Current Size shows you 
what your original canvas size is 
when you open the dialog box.
	
✓	Width: Type the new width in 
the text box.
	
✓	Height: Type the new height in 
the text box.
	
✓	Relative: By default, the new size 
is absolute. Select this check box 
if you want the new size to be relative to the dimensions.
	
✓	Anchor: By default, the canvas is increased from the center out. For 
example, if you have a 3-x-3-inch canvas area and you increase the size 
to 5 x 5 inches, 1 inch of canvas is added to all four sides of the photo. 
By clicking an arrow in the Anchor area, you can size the canvas relative 
to the photo from the upper-left corner, top, upper-right corner, left 
side, right side, lower-left corner, bottom, or lower-right corner.
	
✓	Canvas Extension Color: From 
the drop-down list, you can 
choose the current background, 
foreground, or some preset val­
ues for the color of the new can­
vas area. If you want a custom 
color, click the color swatch to 
the right of the drop-down list 
and make a new color selection 
from the pop-up color wheel.
In Figure 2-8, we added some canvas 
area to make the total size of the 
photo 8 x 10 inches. The new canvas 
color specified in the Tools panel is 
the same color as the background 
color.

Changing the Canvas Size
Using the Crop tool
You have a lot of toggles available in the Canvas Size dialog box. We’re going 
to tell you to forget them all! It’s old school, and you can now take advantage 
of a more visual method for sizing the canvas.
Sizing a canvas with the Crop tool
“I’ve always been able to trim a canvas with the Crop tool,” you say, “But can 
I really size up a canvas with the Crop tool?” Yes, you can! In Photoshop 
Elements, you can resize the canvas with the Crop tool. The Crop tool in 
Elements is capable of expanding the canvas size as well as trimming it.
To find out how to use the Crop tool to size up a canvas, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open an image in the Photo Editor.
	
	 Any image will do. Select an image in the Organizer and click the Editor 
button to open the image in the Photo Editor.
	
	 2.	 Select the Crop tool.
	
	 Press the C key to access the tool or click the tool in the Tools panel.
	
3.	 Drag open a rectangle on the image and release the mouse button.
	
	 You can drag out a small rectangle or one to fill the entire size of the 
image. The size of the rectangle doesn’t matter. Just be certain that you 
see a rectangle with eight handles (squares) along the dashed lines.
	
4.	 Drag the rectangle handles out beyond the image size similar to what 
you see in Figure 2-9.
	
5.	 Press the Enter/Return key or click the green check mark to commit 
the new canvas size.
	
	 The canvas size is sized up to the rectangle boundaries.
What you see in Figure 2-9 is an overlay called the Rule of Thirds, where the 
grid appears with equal divisions in nine quadrants. Theoretically, the cen­
termost rectangle is the area where a viewer of your photo makes eye con­
tact; it should appear as the focal point for your photo.
In the Options panel, you see Rule of Thirds selected, as shown in Figure 2-9. 
You have other choices for overlays or using no overlay in the panel.

Figure 2-9: Drag the crop rectangle outside the image area.
	
You can also use numerical values as you do in the Canvas Size dialog box. 
Type values for the Width and Height fields (also shown in Figure 2-9) and 
reshape the rectangle to include the area outside the image or crop the 
image down in size while retaining a fixed width and height.
Using Golden Ratio
Because we’re talking about cropping images, you may want to look at some 
of the other options available to you using the Crop tool. As we said, you can 
make some choices in the Options panel when you click the Crop tool in the 
Tools panel. In addition to the Rule of Thirds, three other choices (from left 
to right) are available:
	
✓	Grid: This option provides a grid with equal divisions within the crop 
boundary.

192
Changing the Canvas Size
	
✓	Golden Ratio: Your second choice is Golden Ratio. Golden Ratio is 
based on what’s known as the divine proportional spiral, a guideline that 
the famous classical artists used to ensure that their paintings were 
pleasing to the eye.
	
✓	None: The last option in the panel is None. Use this option when you 
want only the crop rectangle to appear.
When you choose Golden Ratio in the Options panel, you see crop guides as 
they appear in Figure 2-10. You should understand some of the choices you 
have when using this tool. You have the following options:
Figure 2-10: The crop guides as they appear using Golden Ratio.
	
✓	Aspect Ratio: The drop-down list offers fixed choices for aspect ratio. 
When you select Golden Ratio, the aspect ratio changes to Custom, as 
you see in Figure 2-10. If you make a choice for another aspect ratio, the 
Golden Ratio is reset to Custom.
	
✓	Swap height and width: When you drag the Crop tool for Golden Ratio, 
the default appears in landscape view (horizontal larger than vertical). If 
you want to change to a portrait crop, click the arrowheads.

✓	Crop tool choices: Make a choice for the Crop tool you want to use. In 
this example, we’re talking about Golden Ratio.
	
✓	Flip the overlay: Figure 2-10 
shows the focal point (repre­
sented by the callout in the mid­
dle of the intersecting guides), 
appearing on the right side of 
the image. You can flip the crop 
guide so that the focal point 
appears on the left side of the 
image. If you have a portrait 
guide (by clicking the arrow­
heads between W and H in the 
Options panel) and flip the 
overlay, you can choose 
between a top or bottom for the 
focal point.
	
✓	Focal point: The focal point is 
where you want the most inter­
esting area in your image. Do 
your best to drag the crop rect­
angle so that the point amidst 
the intersecting guides rests 
atop the main area of interest. 
With portrait shots, the main 
area of interest might be a sub­
ject’s eyes, for example.
	
✓	Commit/Cancel: As is common 
to most editing tasks in 
Elements, you click the green 
check mark to commit the edit 
or click the circle with diagonal line to cancel the crop definition.
In Figure 2-11, we used the Golden Ratio tool to produce the image shown in 
Figure 2-12.

W

hether you plan to use your images for print or screen (or both), 
you have to consider color mode and file format. The most common 
color mode for photos taken with a digital camera is RGB; you use it to pre­
pare color files for printing on your desktop color printer or for sending to 
photo-service centers.
You can also use color modes other than RGB (red, green, blue) — bitmap 
or grayscale, for example. If you start with an RGB color image and want to 
convert to a different color mode, you have menu options for doing 
precisely that. Photoshop Elements uses an algorithm (a math­
ematical formula) to convert pixels from one mode to 
another. In some cases, the conversion that’s made via a 
menu command produces good results; in other cases, 
you can use some different options for converting 
modes.
In this chapter, we introduce the modes that are 
available in Elements and explain how to convert 
from RGB to the mode of your choice: bitmap, gray­
scale, or indexed color. 
File formats are also somewhat dependent on which 
color mode you choose for your files, so we tossed in a 
discussion about saving files in this chapter.

196
Selecting a Color Mode
Selecting a Color Mode
When you open an image from a digital camera or scan an image, the image 
file contains a color mode. Typically, digital camera images are in RGB color 
mode. When you scan documents and photos on a scanner, you can choose 
from among line art (bitmap mode), grayscale, or RGB color.
	
Another mode you may have heard of is CMYK. Although CMYK mode isn’t 
available in Photoshop Elements, you should be aware of it and its uses. 
CMYK, commonly referred to as process color, contains percentages of cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black colors. This mode is used for commercial print­
ing and also on many desktop printers. If you design a magazine cover in 
Elements and send the file to a print shop, the file is ultimately converted to 
CMYK. Also note that most desktop printers use different ink sets within the 
CMYK color space.
If you start in the Photo 
Editor and create a new 
blank document, you 
have a choice for defin­
ing the color mode of the 
new document. Choose 
File➪New➪Blank File, 
and the New dialog box 
opens, as shown in 
Figure 3-1. (Alternatively 
you can create a new 
blank file by clicking the 
Open drop-down menu at 
the upper left of the 
Photo Editor and choose 
New Blank File.) At the 
bottom of the dialog box, 
you make a choice for 
the color mode from the Color Mode drop-down list.
When choosing a color mode, the options you have for importing images 
from digital camera shots, scanning images, and creating new documents are 
limited to the modes discussed thus far. To explore other modes or change a 
mode, you have to work with menu commands for converting color.
Figure 3-1: Define the color mode for a new blank document 
with the New dialog box.

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
Converting Color Modes and Profiles
The most common scenario for photographers and users of Photoshop 
Elements is to start out with an RGB color image. This color mode is the cen­
ter of your mode universe — and from here, you can convert from RGB to 
other color modes.
Converting to Bitmap mode
Bitmap mode is most commonly used in printing line art, such as black-and-
white logos, illustrations, or black-and-white effects that you create from 
your RGB images. Also, you can scan your analog signature as a bitmap 
image and import it into other programs, such as Microsoft Office programs. 
If you’re especially creative, you can combine bitmap images with RGB color 
to produce many interesting effects.
	
The Elements Bitmap mode isn’t the same as the Windows BMP file format. 
In Elements, Bitmap mode is a color mode with only two color values — 
black and white. A Windows BMP file can be an image in RGB, Grayscale, or 
Bitmap color mode.
	
When you’re working with color modes, keep in 
mind that when you combine images into single 
documents (as we explain throughout Book VI), 
you have to convert bitmap files to grayscale or 
color if you want to merge those images with an 
RGB image. If you convert to grayscale, Elements 
takes care of converting grayscale to RGB mode.
For an example of what happens when you com­
bine grayscale and color images, look over 
Figure 3-2: The original RGB image was con­
verted to a bitmap and then saved as a different 
file. The bitmap was converted to grayscale and 
dropped on top of the RGB image. Adjusting the 
opacity produced a grainy effect with desatu­
rated color. (For more information on how to 
merge files, create layers, and blend the opacity 
of layers, see Book VI, Chapters 1 through 3.)
You can acquire Bitmap mode images directly in 
Elements when you scan images that are originally 
Figure 3-2: Combining the same 
image from a bitmap file and an 
RGB file.

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
black and white — such as line art, logos, your signature, or a copy of a fax — 
in Bitmap mode. Additionally, you can convert your RGB color images to 
Bitmap mode.
Converting RGB color to bitmap is a two-step process. You first convert to 
grayscale and then convert from grayscale to bitmap. If you use the Bitmap 
menu command while in RGB color, Elements prompts you to convert to 
grayscale first.
To convert RGB mode to Bitmap mode, do the following:
	
1.	 Open an image that you want to convert to Bitmap mode in the Photo 
Editor, using either Expert or Quick mode.
	
2.	 Choose Image➪Mode➪Bitmap.
	
	 If you start in RGB mode, Elements prompts you to convert to Grayscale 
mode.
	
3.	 Click OK.
	
	 The Bitmap dialog box opens, providing options for selecting the output 
resolution and a conversion method.
	
4.	 Select a resolution.
	
	 By default, the Bitmap dialog 
box (see Figure 3-3) displays the 
current resolution. You can edit 
the text box and type a new res­
olution value or accept the 
default.
	
5.	 Under the Method heading, 
select one of the following set­
tings from the Use drop-down 
menu:
 
• 50% Threshold: This choice 
results in half the pixels 
turning white and the other 
half turning black. You see a 
piece of artwork that 
appears solid black and white.
 
• Pattern Dither: Dithering results in an illusion of gray pixels according 
to the placement of the blacks and whites. When using a pattern 
dither, the image is dithered according to a defined pattern.
Figure 3-3: Type a resolution for your output; 
select a conversion method from the Use 
drop-down menu.

• Diffusion Dither: This option results in the best view of a black-and-
white photo where the dithering appears with grays as well as blacks 
and whites.
	
	 For more about dithering color, see the section “Converting to Indexed 
Color mode,” later in this chapter. Look at Figure 3-4 to see a compari­
son of the different methods used in converting RGB images to bitmaps.
Figure 3-4: RGB image converted to bitmap by using 50% Threshold, Pattern Dither, and Diffusion Dither.
	
6.	 Click OK to convert your image to Bitmap mode.
Converting to Grayscale mode
Grayscale images have black and white pixels and any one of 256 levels of 
gray. By converting an RGB image to grayscale, you can make it look like a 
black-and-white photo.

200
Converting Color Modes and Profiles
	
We talk about 256 gray levels in many chapters in this book. An RGB color 
image is divided into three separate channels (one for red, one for green, 
and one for blue). Each of these channels contains 256 levels of grays. 
Adjusting the levels of grays affects the brightness and color in your images. 
(Look over Book VIII, Chapter 2 to understand more about the gray levels 
and adjusting them in Photoshop Elements.)
	
You can convert an image to grayscale in one of three ways, but we’re here 
to tell you that one of these methods isn’t as good as the others. In other 
words, avoid converting to grayscale by choosing Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. 
When Elements performs this conversion, it removes all the color from the 
pixels, so you lose some precious data during the conversion. You can’t 
regain this color after conversion. If you use the Image➪Mode➪Grayscale 
command sequence to convert an image to grayscale and then save the file 
and delete the original from your hard drive or memory card, the color 
image is lost forever. You can save a secondary file, but this method is con­
fusing and requires more space on your hard drive.
As an alternative to using the menu command for converting images to gray­
scale, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open an RGB image in Elements.
	
2.	 Duplicate a layer.
	
	 The default Project Bin contains 
the Layers panel. In this panel, 
you find a pop-up menu when 
you click the box in the upper-
right corner. From the menu 
commands, choose Duplicate 
Layer. (For more information on 
working with layers, see Book 
VI, Chapter 1.) After duplicating 
the layer, you see a thumbnail 
of another layer in the Layers 
panel.
	
3.	 Choose Enhance➪Adjust 
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation 
(alternatively, press Ctrl+U or 
⌘+U on the Mac) to open the 
Hue/Saturation dialog box, 
shown in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-5: In the Hue/Saturation dialog box, 
move the Saturation slider to the far left to 
eliminate color.

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
	
4.	 Drag the Saturation slider to the far left to desaturate the image and 
click OK.
	
	 All color disappears, but the brightness values of all the pixels remain 
unaffected. (For more information on using the Hue/Saturation dialog 
box and the other Adjust Color commands, see Book VIII, Chapter 2.)
	
5.	 Turn off the color layer by clicking the Eye icon.
	
	 In the Layers panel, you see two 
layers, as shown in Figure 3-6. 
You don’t need to turn off the 
color layer to print the file in 
grayscale, but turning it off can 
help you remember which color 
layer you used the last time you 
printed or exported the file.
When you follow the preceding 
steps, your file will contain both 
RGB and grayscale versions of your 
image. If you want to print the color 
layer, you can turn off the grayscale 
layer. If you need to exchange files 
with graphic designers, you can 
send the layered file, and then the 
design professional can use both the 
color image and the grayscale 
image.
Another choice you have for converting color to black-and-white photos is 
to use the Convert to Black and White dialog box. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 Choose Enhance➪Convert to Black and White in either Expert or 
Quick mode.
	
	 The Convert to Black and White dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 
3-7. This dialog box contains many controls for adjusting brightness and 
contrast in images that you convert to grayscale.
	
2.	 Select from preset options in the Select a Style list.
Figure 3-6: The Layers panel shows the 
grayscale and color layers. Click the Eye icon 
to turn layers on or off.

202

3.	 (Optional) To modify the settings that the preset applies, click and 
drag any of the Adjust Intensity sliders.
	
	 As you move the sliders in the Adjust Intensity area, you can see a 
dynamic preview displayed in the After thumbnail area.
	
4.	 (Optional) If you want to keep your original RGB image in the same 
file as the grayscale version, duplicate the background by right-
clicking a layer in the Layers panel and choosing Duplicate Layer 
from the context menu. Then click the background and choose 
Enhance➪Convert to Black and White. 
	
	 The conversion is applied only to the background, leaving the copied 
layer in the original color mode.
Convert a photo by using the Convert to Black and White command, de-
saturate a photo by using the Hue/Saturation adjustment, or choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color. The photo appears as a black-and-
white photo after using one of these techniques, but the color mode remains

in RGB. From there you can tint a photo with a color Photo Filter or add a 
sepia-tone effect. See our Web Extra for more on creating sepia tones at 
www.dummies.com/extras/photoshopelements12.
Converting to Indexed Color mode
Indexed Color is a mode that you use occasionally with web graphics, such 
as saving in GIF format or PNG-8 (discussed later in this chapter). When sav­
ing indexed-color images, you can often create smaller file sizes than using 
RGB. These are ideal for using in website designs.
RGB images in 24-bit color (8 bits per channel) can render colors from a pal­
ette of 16.7 million colors. An indexed color image is an 8-bit image with only 
a single channel. With indexed color, you get only 256 colors. When you con­
vert RGB images to indexed color, you can choose to dither the color, which 
displays the image with a dithered effect much like the effect you see with 
bitmapped images. This dithering effect makes the file appear as though it 
has more than 256 colors, and the transition between colors appears 
smoother than it would if no dithering were applied.
On occasion, indexed-color images have an advantage over RGB images 
when you’re hosting the images on web servers: The fewer colors in a file, 
the smaller the file size and the faster the image loads. When you prepare 
images for web hosting, you can choose to use indexed color or RGB color. 
Whether you choose one over the other really depends on the quality of the 
image as it appears on your monitor. If you have some photos that you want 
to show on web pages, you should use RGB images and save them in a for­
mat appropriate for web hosting, as we explain in the section “Saving files 
for the web,” later in this chapter.
If you have files composed of artwork, such as logos, illustrations, and draw­
ings, you may find that the appearance of images using indexed colors is no 
different from the same images as RGB. If that’s the case, you can keep the 
indexed-color image and use it for your web pages.
To convert RGB images to indexed color, choose Image➪Mode➪Indexed 
Color; the Indexed Color dialog box opens. Various options are available to 
you; fortunately, you can preview the results while you make choices. Get in 
and poke around. You can see the options applied in the image window.
Converting color profiles
Because we’re talking about color conversions in this chapter, we also cover 
a little bit about color profiles (and converting color profiles) here. But for a 
more thorough discussion of color profiles, jump to Chapter 5 of this minibook.

204
Using the Proper File Format
Some image files contain embedded color profiles; an example is the 
one shown later in this chapter, in Figure 3-8, where the embedded profile is 
shown in the Save As dialog box.
Photoshop Elements can embed either one of two different color profiles in a 
photo: Adobe RGB and sRGB. The Adobe RGB profile uses a slightly larger 
color gamut (more available colors) than sRGB. Some printing devices work 
best when converting sRGB color to the printer’s color. Other printers offer 
better support for Adobe RGB. (This is a nutshell view of color profiling for 
printing. For more detailed information, see Book IX, Chapter 2.)
If you want to print the file to a printer, you might want to convert the color 
profile. To do so, choose Image➪Convert Color Profile and then make a 
choice from the submenu. Your options are
	
✓	Remove Profile: Choosing this option removes the color profile from 
the image.
	
✓	Convert to sRGB Profile: This choice applies the sRGB profile to the 
image.
	
✓	Convert to Adobe RGB: This option applies the Adobe RGB color profile 
to the image.
Choosing one of these options either removes a color profile or converts to 
the selected color profile. When you save your file, you have the option to 
embed the profile in the image.
Using the Proper File Format
As you edit your image files, be sure that you save frequently to update the 
work performed in your editing sessions. Continue saving as your work pro­
gresses to avoid data loss.
You can save Photoshop Elements files in a variety of formats. Some format 
types support only certain color modes, so you may need to convert a color 
mode before you can save in those formats. Put another way, a relationship 
exists between the color modes present in files and saving those files in for­
mats that support those color modes. Additionally, an image’s bit depth may 
also limit the kinds of file formats you can use when saving files. (See 
Chapter 4 in this minibook for more information about bit depth.)
Before you go too far in Elements, become familiar with file formats and the 
conversions necessary to save in one format or another. If you don’t convert 
an image’s modes or change its bit depth, you can save an edited file in the 

205
Book III 
Chapter 3
Choosing Color 
Modes and File 
Formats
Using the Proper File Format
same format in which you opened it. Often, however, if you open an image 
and prepare it for some form of output, you have to give more thought to the 
kind of file format you should use when saving the file.
Using the Save/Save As dialog box
In almost any program, the Save (or Save As) dialog box is a familiar place 
where you make some choices about the file to be saved. With Save As, you 
can save a duplicate copy of your image or save a modified copy and retain 
the original file.
To use the Save (or Save As) dialog box, choose File➪Save for files to be 
saved the first time, or choose File➪Save As for any file, and a dialog box 
opens. In Figure 3-8, you can see the save options you have available in 
Windows (left) and on the Macintosh (right).
Figure 3-8: The Save As dialog box (Windows left, Mac right).
The standard navigational tools that you find in any Save dialog box appear 
in the Elements Save/Save As dialog box. Here are some standard options 
you find in the Elements Save/Save As dialog box:
	
✓	File Name (Save As on the Mac): This item is common to all Save dialog 
boxes. Type a name for your file in the text box.
	
✓	Format: From the drop-down menu, you select file formats. We explain 
the formats supported by Elements in the next section.

206
Using the Proper File Format
A few options make the Photoshop Elements Save/Save As dialog box differ­
ent from other Save dialog boxes that you might be accustomed to using. 
The Save Options area in the Save As dialog box provides the following 
choices:
	
✓	Include in the Elements Organizer: If you want the file to be added to 
the Organizer, select this check box. (For more information about using 
the Organizer, see Book II, Chapter 1.)
	
✓	Save in Version Set with Original: You can edit images and save a ver­
sion of your image, but only in Quick mode. When you save the file from 
Quick mode, this check box is active. Select the box to save a version of 
the original, which appears in the Organizer. The “Creating Versions” 
section, later in this chapter, introduces version sets.
	
✓	Layers: Select this check box if you have a file with layers and want to 
preserve the layers. This option is available only for PSD, TIFF, PDF, and 
PSE file formats.
	
✓	As a Copy: Select this check box to save a copy of the file without over­
writing the original.
	
✓	Color: Select the check box for ICC (International Color Consortium) 
Profile. Depending on which profile you’re using, the option appears for 
sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is selected, the profile 
is embedded in the image. (See the section “Converting Color Modes 
and Profiles,” earlier in this chapter.)
	
✓	Thumbnail (Windows): If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can see a 
miniature representation of your image when viewing it in folders or on 
the desktop. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving Files prefer­
ences, the check box can be enabled or disabled. If you select an option 
for Always Save or Never Save in the Preferences dialog box, this box 
is enabled or disabled (and grayed out). You have to return to the 
Preferences dialog box if you want to change the option. Flip to Book I, 
Chapter 4 for help with preferences.
	
✓	Use Lower Case Extension (Windows): File extensions give you a clue 
about the file format in which a file was saved. Elements automatically 
adds the extension to the filename for you. Your choices are to use 
uppercase or lowercase letters for the extension name. Select the check 
box for Use Lower Case Extension for lowercase; deselect the check box 
if you want to use uppercase characters in the filename. By default, you 
should always use lowercase extensions. Lowercase is required for 
some uses such as web-hosting images.

Understanding file formats
When you save files from Elements, you pick a file format in the Format 
drop-down menu found in both the Save and Save As dialog boxes.
	
When you choose from the different format options, keep the following infor­
mation in mind:
	
✓	File formats are especially important when you exchange files with 
other users. Each format has a purpose, and other programs can accept 
or reject files depending on the format you choose.
	
✓	Whether you can select one format or another for saving a file depends 
on the color mode and the bit depth, and whether layers are present. 
If a format isn’t present in the Format drop-down list when you attempt 
to save a file, return to one of the edit modes and perform an edit, such 
as changing a color mode or flattening layers, to save the file in your 
chosen format.
Figure 3-9 shows a number of differ­
ent file formats you can use. However, 
in practicality, you’re likely to use 
only a few on a routine basis. We 
talk about the most essential for­
mats in this chapter. If you want to 
find out more about those formats 
we don’t discuss here, consult the 
Elements Help files.
In the following sections, we explain 
formats you’re likely to use most.
Photoshop (*.PSD, *.PDD)
This format is the native file format for both Photoshop and Photoshop 
Elements. The format supports saving all color modes and bit depths, and 
you can preserve layers. Use this format when you want to save in a native 
format or exchange files with Photoshop users. Also use it for saving files 
that you want to return to for more editing. When you save layers, any text 
that you add to layers can be edited when you return to the file. (See Book V, 
Chapter 3 for more information on adding text to an image.)
BMP (*.BMP, *.RLE, *.DIB)
The term bitmap can be a little confusing. You have both a file format type 
that’s bitmap and a color mode that’s also bitmap. Don’t confuse the two. 
Figure 3-9: Open the Format drop-down menu 
in either the Save or Save As dialog box to make 
the formats supported by Elements appear.

208
Using the Proper File Format
The bitmap format supports saving in all color modes and in all bit depths. 
The Bitmap color mode, which we cover in the section “Converting to Bitmap 
mode,” earlier in this chapter, is 1-bit black-and-white only.
Use the bitmap format when you want to add images to system resources, 
such as wallpaper for your desktop (Windows). Bitmap is also used with 
many application programs. If you can’t import images in other program 
documents, try to save them as BMP files.
CompuServe GIF (*.GIF)
GIF is a format used with web graphics. Although you have the format avail­
able in the Save As dialog box, use the Save for Web command that we 
explain later in the section “Saving files for the web” when saving images in 
GIF format.
Photo Project Format (*.PSE)
Use this option when you create a project and want to save the file as a proj­
ect. See Book IX, Chapter 1 for more on creating projects in Elements.
JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG, *.JPE)
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is perhaps the most common file 
format now in use. JPEG files are used with e-mail attachments and by many 
photo labs for printing files. You can view this file type in a JPEG viewer or 
directly in a web browser. Just about every program capable of importing 
images supports the JPEG format. Creative professionals wouldn’t dream of 
using the JPEG format in design layouts, but everyone else uses the format 
for all kinds of documents.
	
You need to exercise some caution when you’re using the JPEG format. JPEG 
files are compressed to reduce file size. You can scrunch an image of several 
megabytes into a few hundred kilobytes. When you save a file with JPEG 
compression, you experience data loss. You might not see this on your mon­
itor or on photo prints if you’re using low compression while preserving 
higher quality. However, when you save with maximum compression, more 
pixels are tossed away, and you definitely notice image degradation.
	
Every time you save, open, and resave images in JPEG format, the image 
degrades more. When you submit JPEG images to photo labs for printing 
your pictures, keep saving in Photoshop PSD file format until you’re ready 
to save the final image. Save that one in JPEG format — only when you 
want to save the final file for printing — and use a low compression with 
high quality.

209
Book III 
Chapter 3
Choosing Color 
Modes and File 
Formats
Using the Proper File Format
When you select JPEG for the format 
and click Save, the JPEG Options 
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 
3-10. You choose the amount of 
compression by typing a value in 
the Quality text box or by moving 
the slider below the Quality text 
box. The acceptable ranges are from 
0 to 12 — 0 is the lowest quality and 
highest compression, and 12 is the 
highest quality with the least 
compression.
Notice that you also have choices 
in the Format Options section of 
the JPEG Options dialog box. The 
Progressive option creates a progres­
sive JPEG file commonly used with 
web browsers: While the file down­
loads from a website, the image first appears in a low-quality view and then 
shows higher-resolution views as the download proceeds; the image appears 
at full resolution when it’s completely downloaded in your browser window.
Photoshop PDF (*.PDF, *.PDP)
Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) is designed to maintain document 
integrity when exchanging files between computers. PDF is one of the most 
popular formats and can be viewed in the free Adobe Reader program avail­
able for installation on your Elements DVD Installer or by downloading it 
from the Adobe website.
PDF is everywhere in Elements. When you jump into Organize mode and cre­
ate slide presentations, cards, and calendars, for example, you can export 
your documents as PDF files. When you save in Photoshop PDF format, you 
can preserve layers and text. Text is recognizable in Adobe Reader (or other 
Acrobat viewers) and can be searched by using the Reader’s Find and 
Search tools.
PDF files can be printed, hosted on websites, and exchanged with users of 
Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, and Linux. All in all, this format is well suited for 
all the files you create in Elements that contain text, layers, and transpar­
ency. It is also ideal when you want to exchange files with users who don’t 
have Elements or Photoshop.
Figure 3-10: When saving in JPEG format, 
choose the amount of compression you want 
to apply to the saved image.

210
Using the Proper File Format
Pixar (*.PXR)
This format is used exclusively to exchange files with Pixar workstations.
PNG (*.PNG)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is another format used with web pages. 
PNG supports all color modes, 24-bit images, and transparency. One disad­
vantage of using PNG is that color profiles can’t be embedded in the images, 
as they can be with JPEG. An advantage, however, is that PNG supports 
transparency and saving with lossless compression. Rather than make a 
choice for PNG here in the Save As dialog box, use the Save for Web com­
mand that we explain later in the section “Saving files for the web.”
TIFF (*.TIF, *.TIFF)
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is the most common format used by graphic 
designers. TIFF is generally used for importing images in professional layout 
programs, such as Adobe InDesign. Commercial photo labs and print shops 
use equipment that supports downloading TIFF files directly to their devices. 
(Note: Direct downloads are used in lieu of opening a Print dialog box.)
Although creative professionals 
have used TIFF for a long time, the 
native Photoshop PSD file format is 
a better choice for designers who 
need to create a file for import into 
programs like Adobe InDesign. The 
PSD format works as well as TIFF, 
and using PSD saves you the work of 
converting the file format.
Those who prefer to work in TIFF 
format should know that TIFF, along 
with Photoshop PSD and Photoshop 
PDF, supports saving layered files 
and works in all color modes. When 
you save in TIFF format, you can 
also compress files using one of sev­
eral different compression schemes. 
Compression with TIFF files doesn’t 
lose data unless you choose a JPEG 
compression.
When you select TIFF for the format 
and click Save in the Save/Save As 
dialog box, the TIFF Options dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 3-11.
Figure 3-11: Choose TIFF from the Format 
drop-down list and click Save to open the TIFF 
Options dialog box.

211
Book III 
Chapter 3
Choosing Color 
Modes and File 
Formats
Using the Proper File Format
In the Image Compression area, you have these choices:
	
✓	NONE: Selecting this option results in no compression. You use this 
option when sending files to professionals who are creating layouts in 
programs such as Adobe InDesign.
	
	Don’t use any of the compression schemes in the following bullets for 
printing files to commercial printing devices.
	
✓	LZW: This lossless compression scheme results in much smaller file 
sizes without destroying data.
	
✓	ZIP: ZIP is also a lossless compression scheme. You can favor ZIP com­
pression over LZW when you have large areas of the same color in an 
image.
	
✓	JPEG: JPEG is lossy — the trade-off is that losing some data from the 
image results in the smallest file sizes. Saving a file you created in some 
other format as a JPEG image has the same result as when you apply 
JPEG compression to files saved in the JPEG format: some data loss.
Saving files for the web
You save files for web hosting in a special dialog box — the Save for Web 
dialog box. It offers other options than the dialog boxes you use to save files 
for other output. You can use the Save for Web dialog box to optimize files, 
but before you open it — in fact, before you even save a file, set the physical 
size and resolution of the image. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size. In the 
dialog box that appears, you can adjust the dimensions and resolution. For 
web graphics, choose a resolution such as 72 ppi and downsample the image 
if necessary. (For more about downsampling, see Book III, Chapter 2.)
After your image is resized, choose File➪Save for Web or press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S 
(⌘+Option+Shift+S on the Mac) to open the Save for Web dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 3-12. As you can see, you have a lot of things to control in 
this dialog box. The settings are
	
A.	Hand tool: When you are zoomed in on the Preview, use the Hand tool 
to move the image around the Preview area.
	
B.	Zoom tool: Click the Zoom tool on one preview image to zoom in on 
both previews. Press the Alt (Option) key to zoom out.
	
C.	Eyedropper tool: Sample a color in the image shown in the Preview area.

212
Using the Proper File Format
Figure 3-12: The Save for Web dialog box.
	
D.	Eyedropper Color Picker color: This choice contains the current sam­
pled color. Whatever color you sample can be used for the matte color, 
which is the transparent areas in your image, if any exist.
	
E.	Previews: The first image displays the original image. The second pre­
view displays a preview for how the file will look when saved. In Figure 
3-12, JPEG is selected for the format option with a Quality of 5. The sec­
ond preview displays the image with the JPEG settings. Notice that in 
the lower-left corner of the right-side preview area, you see an estimate 
of how long the image will take to download with a certain modem 
speed. An image that can download in 11 seconds on a 56-Kbps modem, 
as shown in Figure 3-12, will download pretty quickly on most modern 
modems, which are usually high-speed broadband modems. You can use

this area of the preview to make sure that you have the right balance 
between image quality and speedy downloads on the web.
	
F.	Preset: A number of presets are available from the drop-down menu that 
will set up preconfigured settings for the options in this dialog box.
	
G.	Image format: From the drop-down menu, choose a file format and 
adjust settings relative to the format. As you make choices, you can pre­
view the results in the right-side preview area.
	
H.	Quality settings: When saving your file as a JPEG, the Quality menu is 
visible. When saving in GIF and PNG-8, you have choices for the number 
of colors. When saving as PNG-24, you have an option for a matte color.
	
I.	Image attributes: You see the original width and height in the Original 
Size area. In the New Size area, you can adjust the size of your image by 
specifying a new width and height in pixels or a percentage by which 
you want to increase or decrease the image size relative to its current 
size. For example, entering 50 in the Percent box would size the image at 
50 percent of its original size.
	
J.	Animation: Settings here apply to animated GIF images.
	
K.	Preview menu: This option displays the output preview.
	
L.	Save: Click Save when you have all the adjustments made and are satis­
fied with the results.
This is a brief review of the options you have available in the Save for Web 
dialog box. For examples related to using the options, see Book IX, Chapter 3.
Creating Versions
Versions enable you to create and save several versions of an image in only 
one file. After you edit an image in the Photo Editor, saving the image with a 
version set permits you to save the original plus the edited version in the 
same file.
To create a version set, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open an original image file in the Photo Editor.
	
2.	 Edit the image to the point where you want to save a version.
	
	 You can choose from many different menu commands to edit the image. 
For example, change the color mode to Indexed Color by choosing 
Image➪Mode➪Indexed Color.
	
3.	 Save a version by choosing File➪Save As.
	
4.	 In the Save Options area of the Save As dialog box, select the Include 
in the Organizer and the Save in Version Set with Original check boxes.

214
Batch-Processing Files
	
5.	 Click Save.
	
	 The edit made in the Photo Editor is saved as another version in your 
version set.
	
After you create a version 
set, the Organizer offers 
menu commands that 
you can use to manage 
the version set. In the 
Organizer, choose Edit➪
Version Set or open a 
context menu on a ver­
sion set and then choose 
Version Set. The submenu, as shown in Figure 3-13, opens with the following 
options:
	
✓	Expand Items in Version Set: Click a version set and choose this menu 
command to expand the items in the version set.
	
✓	Collapse Items in Version Set: When items are expanded, you can 
return them to a collapsed view by selecting this command.
	
✓	Flatten Version Set: Be careful here. If you choose this command, you 
lose all items in the version set except the top image.
	
✓	Convert Version Set to Individual Items: This command removes items 
from the version set and adds each version as a separate image to the 
Organizer window.
	
✓	Revert to Original: This command deletes the version set and returns 
you to the original, unedited version of the file.
	
✓	Remove Item(s) from Version Set: This option removes any selected 
item (or items) from a version set.
	
✓	Set as Top Item: When viewing an expanded version set, click one of the 
images and choose this item to move it to the top.
Batch-Processing Files
Elements provides you with some automated features for processing 
batches of photos. You can export multiple files from one format to another 
file format, and you can export files, changing file formats if you like. In addi­
tion, you have a limited number of other editing tasks you can automate.
The method you use and the features you want depend on whether you 
choose Export in the Organizer or Process Files in the Photo Editor. The fol­
lowing sections explain how each tool works.

Exporting files in the Organizer
You may need to export files from one format to another for a number of rea­
sons. For example, when you open JPEG images and save back to a JPEG for­
mat, you’re adding file compression to the saved images. JPEG is a lossy file 
format, which means that you lose image data when you save in this format. 
If you edit a JPEG image many times and save back to JPEG format each time, 
you continually lose more image data.
In some cases, you may want to convert multiple JPEG files to a file format 
that doesn’t toss away data. You can use formats such as Photoshop PSD, 
PNG-24, or TIFF (without JPEG compression), and no data is thrown away 
when you save the file.
For a single instance when you want to convert a JPEG image to a PSD or 
TIFF image, you can open the file in Elements and choose File➪Save As. 
From the Files of Type drop-down list (Windows) or Format pop-up menu 
(Mac), choose the desired format.
	
If you have multiple files and you want to convert the file type more effi­
ciently, you can process a folder of files using a single command. To use a 
batch process to convert multiple files from one format to another (in 
Windows only), do the following:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer.
	
	 You should have a collection of 
photos in the Organizer saved 
as JPEG or some other format 
that you want to convert to a 
newer format.
	
2.	 Select files in the Organizer 
that you want to convert.
	
	 Click a file and press Shift and 
click the last file in a group, or 
you can click and press Ctrl and 
click all the photos you want to 
convert.
	
3.	 Choose File➪Export as New 
Files.
	
	 The Export New Files dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 3-14.
	
4.	 Select a File Type option.
	
	 If you’re converting JPEG files, 
you might want to choose PSD for the file format. The PSD format does

not compress files. See the earlier section “Understanding file formats” 
for an explanation of each file type.
	
5.	 Select a Size and Quality.
	
	 Select Original if you want to maintain the same image dimensions and 
resolution. If you want a different size for the saved images, make a 
choice from the Photo Size drop-down list.
	
6.	 Click the Browse button in the Location area.
	
	 You can target a folder on your hard drive if you don’t want to use the 
default folder shown in the Export New Files dialog box.
	
7.	 Select an option under Filenames.
	
	 You can save the files to a new folder with the same names without over­
writing the original files or save to the same folder adding a common 
base name. If you select the Common Base Name option, you can type a 
base name in the text box. Type something like Hawaii, for example, and 
the files are saved as Hawaii001, Hawaii002, and so on.
	
8.	 Click the Add or Remove button to add more files or remove some 
from the list, respectively.
	
	 If you want to add more files, click the Add (+) icon. 
	
	 To remove a file, you can scroll the list of thumbnails, click the photo to 
remove from the group to be exported, and click the Remove (–) icon.
	
9.	 Click the Export button.
	
	 Wait for the progress to complete before moving on.
	
	 After the export progress finishes, the Exporting Files Complete dialog 
box opens.
	
10.	 Click OK.
	
	 The file export task is completed.
Processing multiple files
The Export as New Files command in the Organizer provides a batch pro­
cess for converting file formats with a rather limited set of options. In the 
Photo Editor, the Process Multiple Files command is more powerful than the 
Organizer’s export tool and can make several enhancements to the new files 
saved. As shown in Figure 3-15, you have far more options available to you in 
the Process Multiple Files dialog box than you have in the Export New Files 
dialog box shown earlier in Figure 3-14.
To access the Process Multiple Files tool in the Photo Editor, choose 
File➪Process Multiple Files to open the dialog box shown in Figure 3-15.

In the left pane of the dialog box, you can make choices for file-naming con­
ventions, locations for saved files, image size and resolution, and file for­
mats. On the right, you see options for automating some basic edits to your 
images. Here’s a brief introduction to each area of the dialog box:
	
✓	Process Files From: Use the options in this area to select the location of 
the images you want to process. You most likely want to corral all the 
images you want to process into a folder, select the location of the 
folder in the Source area, and select a different folder where Elements 
will save the processed files in the Destination area. 
	
	From the drop-down menu at the top, you can also choose to process 
files on import (from, say, a camera) or to process currently open files.
	
✓	File Naming: When you select the Rename Files check box, you can 
choose to rename the files using the current document name, numbers, 
dates, and letters. The example shown below the drop-down lists of 
options displays a preview of a filename that your selections will 
generate.

218
Batch-Processing Files
	
✓	Image Size: When you select the Resize Images check box, you can 
adjust the width, height, and resolution of a batch of images. Chapter 2 
of this minibook explains how these options work.
	
✓	File Type: If you select the Convert Files To check box, the processing 
changes the file format of your images. The options here reflect all the 
options you see in the Save As dialog box. See the section 
“Understanding file formats,” earlier in this chapter, for details about 
each format.
	
✓	Quick Fix: Here, you can select the check boxes for the image enhance­
ments you want to make. For a complete description of these items, see 
Book VIII, Chapter 1.
	
✓	Labels: You can apply watermarks with custom text and choose the font 
attributes and placement for the text added to the new saved files. Leave 
the Custom Text box blank if you don’t want to add text to your images. 
See Book V, Chapter 3 for details about adjusting the opacity of text.
After you click OK, your files are converted and saved to the target folder 
that you identified in the dialog box.

he Camera Raw format provides you with an optimum image for editing 
in Elements. When a Camera Raw image is saved to a media source, all 
the information that the sensor captured is saved with the file. When you 
want to edit your images, this extra information gives you immense 
flexibility.
For example, you can open a Camera Raw image and, before the image 
opens in Elements, you can adjust temperature, exposure, and a bunch of 
other settings — in effect, processing the photo after the shot was 
taken.
You can return to the original Camera Raw file and 
change the temperature or exposure (for example) to 
open the file with different settings to see how they 
affect the image. Just as chemical temperature and 
development time affect analog film processing, 
similar options affect post-processing Camera Raw 
images. The difference between analog film and 
Camera Raw is that after the analog film is pro­
cessed, you can’t change the processing attributes. 
With Camera Raw, you can go back and post-process 
the image 100 times or more — and change the pro­
cessing attributes each time.
Camera Raw also supports higher bit-depth images than 
JPEG files do. In Book III, Chapter 5, we talk about 8-bit and 16-bit 

220
Introducing the Benefits of Camera Raw Files
images, including advantages of using 16-bit images. Camera Raw files typi­
cally produce these higher bit-depth images that give you more flexibility 
when editing brightness, contrast, and color.
	
If your camera offers you the choice between capturing just JPEG images 
and both JPEG and Camera Raw, always choose the latter. You have much 
more editing control over your images — and ultimately, you get better 
results.
	
If your camera isn’t capable of taking Camera Raw files, you can always open 
your original JPEG files as Camera Raw. Choose File➪Open As in the Photo 
Editor and choose Camera Raw from the Open As drop-down menu. Your file 
opens in the Camera Raw converter. All that follows in this chapter is avail­
able to users with or without camera options for taking Camera Raw photos. 
Check out the following sections for details about processing your images 
with the Elements Camera Raw tools.
Introducing the Benefits of Camera Raw Files
Camera Raw images enable you to post-process your pictures. When you 
take a picture with a digital camera in Camera Raw format, the camera’s sen­
sor records as much information as it can. When you open a Camera Raw file 
in Elements, you decide what part of that data is opened as a new image.
If you don’t have a camera that’s capable of capturing Camera Raw images, 
you aren’t left out. Any photo you’ve saved in JPEG or TIFF format can also 
open in the Camera Raw converter. You don’t have the same file attributes 
as you do with Camera Raw images — these images won’t have all the data 
captured by your camera’s sensor because the images will already be post-
processed — but you do have access to all the image-correction controls 
that authentic Camera Raw files have.
In regard to processing Camera Raw files, suppose that your camera is set 
for exposure in tungsten lighting. (Tungsten flash photography is common in 
studios.) If you take this camera outside in daylight and shoot an image with­
out changing the settings, all your images appear with a blue cast because 
tungsten lighting requires a cooler color temperature than daylight.
If you acquire images that are saved in JPEG format, you have to do a lot of 
color correction after the image opens in Elements. If you shoot the image in 
Camera Raw format, you just process the image with a warmer temperature 

221
Book III

Working with 
Camera Raw
Opening Images in the Elements Raw Converter
(consistent with conditions when the shot was taken), and your color cor­
rection in Elements happens in a fraction of the time it takes to fix a file 
opened without using the Camera Raw converter. Fortunately, you can also 
change temperature for JPEG and TIFF files if you open them in the Camera 
Raw converter.
Post-processing Camera Raw images requires a plug-in that’s installed with 
Photoshop Elements. When you open a Camera Raw image, the Camera 
Raw plug-in takes over and provides you with a huge set of options for post-
processing the image before you open it in one of the Elements Editors.
	
Each camera manufacturer uses a different flavor of Camera Raw; some man­
ufacturer use different Camera Raw formats in different models in their prod­
uct line. Although Adobe tries to keep up with all the various Camera Raw 
formats, you may find a camera using a format not supported by the Camera 
Raw plug-in. Be sure to check for updates online for Photoshop Elements. As 
new developments occur, Adobe makes an effort to update plug-ins to sup­
port newer formats.
Opening Images in the Elements Raw Converter
When you open a Camera Raw file in Elements, it always opens in the raw 
converter. Elements recognizes raw files and defaults to open the file in the 
raw converter. (See Chapter 1 of this minibook for details about opening 
files.)
If you want to use the raw converter to work with any photo on your com­
puter saved as JPEG, TIFF, or another format, you need to tell Elements that 
you want to use the raw converter. In the Photo Editor, choose Open 
As➪Camera Raw. The file opens in the raw converter, where you can make 
adjustments before opening the file in the Photo Editor.
	
You might use this method to open nonraw files that need temperature 
adjustments before attempting to edit the photos in the Photo Editor.
In Figure 4-1, a single image is opened in the Camera Raw converter. You can 
use a vast number of options to post-process your image before you drop it 
into Elements. This window is like a digital darkroom, where you can pro­
cess the film and see what you’re doing to the image before you accept the 
changes.

222
Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
Figure 4-1: A single image opened in the Camera Raw converter.
Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
With an image open in the Camera Raw converter, don’t be shy. Poke around 
and adjust settings to see the results in the Preview area. The more you play 
with the settings, the more you find out about how to get the best out of 
Camera Raw. 
	
If you have your monitor properly calibrated (as we explain in Book III, 
Chapter 5), all the adjustments you make for Camera Raw format are dynam­
ically updated in the Image preview.
	
When working in the Camera Raw converter, the adjustments are placed in 
the order you should follow. Start at the top of the right panel and make 
adjustments beginning with Temperature and Tint. Follow downward 
making adjustments to Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, and so on. You can 
go back and fine-tune the adjustments after addressing each item from top 
to bottom.

223

Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
In the following sections, you find an introduction to the tools and settings in 
the converter. You then walk through the steps of processing an image in 
the raw converter one setting at a time.
Introducing the converter’s tools and settings
The Camera Raw window has a large number of settings, as the following list 
describes:
	
✓	Tools: Nine tools appear in the window:
	
•	 Zoom: This tool zooms in and out of the Image preview.
	
•	 Hand: This option moves the image around, just as it does in the 
Elements image window.
	
•	 White Balance: Changes the Temperature and Tint.
	
•	 Crop tool: Draw a marquee with the Crop tool and make your color 
and brightness adjustments. The adjustments are applied only to the 
area defined by the Crop tool. When you click Open Image, the photo 
opens, cropped to the area you marked with the Crop tool.
	
•	 Straighten tool: The Straighten tool enables you to draw a horizontal 
axis to straighten a crooked photo.
	
•	 Red Eye Removal: Click the Red Eye Removal tool to remove red-eye 
caused by flash lighting.
	
•	 Open Preferences dialog box (Ctrl+K [⌘+K]): Click this tool to open 
the Camera Raw Preferences dialog box, where you can make 
choices for saving image settings, change default image settings, and 
use the Adobe Digital Negative (DNG) format.
	
•	 Rotate Left: Used to rotate the image counterclockwise.
	
•	 Rotate Right: The last tool below the Title bar is used to rotate the 
image clockwise.
	
✓	Preview: Select the check box to show dynamic previews of your edits.
	
✓	Shadow/Highlight Clipping: The Shadow and Highlight buttons above 
the histogram (denoted by the up-pointing arrows shown above the his­
togram at the top of the adjustments pane) show clipping in the shadows 
(dark areas of the image) and highlights (light areas of the image). 
Clipping means that, in a certain area, the image has lost data (and, ulti­
mately, detail), and you don’t want clipping to appear in your pictures. 
When you make adjustments with clipping enabled, shadow clipping is 
shown in blue, and highlight clipping is shown in red in the Image 

224
Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
preview. Take a look at Figure 4-2, 
in which we exaggerate clipping 
to show how the Clipping preview 
appears.
	
✓	Histogram: This graph displays 
all three channels (red, green, 
and blue) in an image simultane­
ously. The histogram changes 
when you change other options 
in the Camera Raw window.
	
	The histogram graphs how pix­
els in an image are distributed. 
The distribution includes the 
number of pixels at each color-
intensity level (one of the 256 levels, which you can find out about in 
Book III, Chapter 3).
	
	If images have pixels concentrated in the shadows, you see the histo­
gram skewed to the left. Conversely, images with pixels concentrated in 
the highlights reveal a histogram skewed to the right.
	
	As you grow more familiar with histograms, eventually a quick glance at 
a histogram will suggest adjustments that you can make to improve an 
image.
	
✓	RGB values: These values appear below the histogram. When you first 
open an image, you don’t see any values in the RGB area. Click the Zoom 
tool, the Hand tool, or the White Balance tool and move the cursor 
over the Image preview. When you move any of these tools around 
the image, the RGB values corresponding to the point below the cursor 
are reported in this area.
	
✓	Detail icons: The three icons change the pane below the Histogram from 
Basic (refer to Figure 4-1) to Detail (as shown in Figure 4-3), where you 
apply sharpening and noise reduction, or to Camera Calibration, where 
you can select a camera profile. Here’s a brief introduction to the areas 
you find on the Detail pane:
	
•	 Sharpening images: You can choose to sharpen images in the Camera 
Raw window or in Elements. Try to avoid sharpening here; instead, 
use the sharpening tools in Elements (as we explain in Book VIII, 
Chapter 1).
	
•	 Noise reduction: Includes options for adjusting the brightness and 
color. You’ve probably seen images with a lot of noise; in extreme 
cases, the pictures look like they were printed on sandpaper. Noise 
in an image is okay if that’s an effect you want to apply intentionally. 
If you want a smooth-looking image, however, you have to eliminate 
Figure 4-2: Shadow clipping appears in blue, 
and highlight clipping appears in red.

225
Book III 
Chapter 4
Working with 
Camera Raw
Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
any noise introduced by the 
camera. Luminance Smoothing 
reduces grayscale noise. The 
next setting is Color Noise 
Reduction, which is used to 
reduce color noise.
	
✓	Settings (pop-up menu): This 
pop-up menu opens when you 
click the small icon on the far 
right of the Basic tab. From this 
menu, you have choices for 
applying settings to the open 
image. If you change any setting, 
the menu option changes to 
Custom.
	
	If you’ve made setting choices 
on a Camera Raw image and 
want to return to the shot as it 
was taken by the camera, open 
the image and select Reset 
Camera Raw Defaults from the 
Settings pop-up menu.
	
	The Previous Conversion option 
is handy if you have a collection 
of images that all require the 
same settings. After adjusting 
the first image, open additional 
images and select Previous 
Conversion. The Camera Raw 
plug-in applies the last settings 
you made to a Camera Raw 
image to the currently open file.
	
✓	White Balance: You use White Balance settings (available on the Basic 
tab — the leftmost icon below the histogram; refer to Figure 4-1) to 
adjust the color balance of an image to reflect the lighting conditions 
under which the shot was originally taken. Remember that the sensor in 
a digital camera is capable of capturing the entire range of white balance 
that the sensor can see. You choose your settings not necessarily on the 
basis of what you see, but rather to match the white balance of the shot 
you took. Therefore, if you set up your camera to take pictures under 
one set of lighting conditions and then move to another set of lighting 
conditions but forget to change the settings, you can let the Camera Raw 
plug-in correct for the difference in white balance; that’s because the 
Figure 4-3: Clicking the Triangle icon below the 
histogram opens the Detail tab, where you can 
adjust sharpness and reduce noise.

226
Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
sensor picked up the entire range, and the necessary data is contained 
in the file.
	
	In Figure 4-4, you can see a picture taken with the camera set for tung­
sten lighting, but the shot was taken outdoors in daylight. By changing 
the White Balance setting in the Camera Raw dialog box, you can see 
how different settings affect the image color.
Figure 4-4: Changing the White Balance setting can dramatically change the image color.
	
✓	Temperature: If one of the preset White Balance options doesn’t quite 
do the job, move the Basic tab’s Temperature slider or edit the text box 
to settle on values between one white balance choice and another. Use 
this item to fine-tune the white balance.
	
✓	Tint: Tint is another fine-tuning adjustment affected by white balance. 
This slider and text box (again, found on the Basic tab) are used to cor­
rect any green or magenta tints in a photo.
	
✓	Brightness adjustments: Several adjustment sliders and text boxes in 
the Basic pane help you control the image brightness and tonal range. 
Notice the Exposure setting. This item lets you correct photos taken at 

227
Book III 
Chapter 4
Working with 
Camera Raw
Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
the wrong exposure. In analog darkrooms, you might ask technicians to 
push or pull film during processing, which results in (respectively) lon­
ger or shorter processing times. Changing exposure times compensates 
for underexposing and overexposing film. A nice advantage of using 
Camera Raw is that you can change the exposure for one image and then 
later open the original raw image and change to a different exposure 
value. Analog film can’t be reprocessed, but by using Camera Raw, you 
can reprocess repeatedly.
	
	Other options for the brightness and tonal controls are similar to the 
choices you have in the Elements Photo Editor. (For more information 
on these adjustments, see Book VIII, Chapter 2.)
	
✓	Cancel/Reset: When you open the Camera Raw window, the button you 
see by default is Cancel. Press the Alt (Option on a Mac) key, and the 
button changes to Reset. If you want to scrub all the settings you made 
and start over, press the Alt (Option) key and click Reset.
	
✓	Open Image/Open Copy: This single button has two purposes:
	
•	 Open Image: This button is the default. Click Open Image after you 
choose all your settings. Elements then processes the photo and 
opens it in the Photo Editor.
	
•	 Open Copy: Press the Alt (Option) key, and the button changes to Open 
Copy. Click Open Copy to open a copy of the raw image in Elements.
	
If you want to keep your original image at the default Camera Raw settings, 
press the Alt/Option key and click Open Copy. The original photo is not pro­
cessed by the raw converter and remains unchanged.
	
✓	Done: Clicking Done doesn’t open the image in Photo Editor. You click 
Done after changing the settings; the new settings then become the new 
defaults for your raw image. You can clear the defaults by opening the 
Settings flyout menu (upper-right corner) and selecting Reset Camera 
Raw Defaults.
	
✓	Zoom: In this drop-down list (located in the lower-left area of the Raw 
Camera plug-in window), you can choose from several zoom presets. 
You can also type a zoom percentage in the text box, click the minus (–) 
button to zoom out, or click the plus (+) button to zoom in. Using any 
option from the menu zooms the Image preview.
	
✓	Help: Clicking the Help button opens a Help document to assist you in 
understanding more about Camera Raw.
	
✓	Save Image: Click the Save Image button to open the Save Options 
dialog box.
	
✓	Depth: If your camera is capable of shooting higher bit depths of 16-bit 
or more, they’re listed here. If you want to convert to 8-bit images for 
printing, you can select the option from the drop-down list.

228
Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
All we can hope to provide in this book is a simple cursory view for using 
Camera Raw. Several books have been written exclusively covering the 
Camera Raw format and how to open files in the Camera Raw plug-in win­
dow. For a more detailed look at using Camera Raw, see Color Management 
for Digital Photographers For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (pub­
lished by Wiley).
Adjusting the image settings
	
The idea behind using the raw converter is that you want to get the tonal 
range and brightness values set to an optimum before opening the image in 
Elements. You’ll find your editing tasks, such as adjusting color and bright­
ness, much easier in Elements if your image starts somewhere in the ball­
park of a good tonal range.
Take Figure 4-5 as an example. This Camera Raw file was opened in the 
Camera Raw dialog box. The image’s white balance is way off the scale, the 
contrast is poor, the saturation is poor, and the photo needs a lot of adjust­
ing to bring it within an acceptable range of color and contrast. Here’s an 
overview of the process we used in the Elements Camera Raw converter and 
then the Photo Editor to adjust the image:
Figure 4-5: A poor-quality photo opened in the raw converter.

1.	 The first step to perform is to adjust the White Balance. We moved the 
Temperature slider to the far left to bring the White Balance into a 
proper setting.
	
2.	 We then made some adjustments for the Exposure, Brightness, Contrast, 
and Blacks, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6: Making adjustments in the raw converter.
	
	 Your clue for making proper adjustments is the histogram. While you 
move the sliders, you want to try to get an even tonal range across the 
histogram without clipping the image (showing spikes on either end). 
Compare the histogram in Figure 4-5 with the one shown in Figure 4-6.
	
	 More important than the color balance is the data you find in the histo­
gram about the tonal range. You can make adjustments for brightness 
and color after you open the image in Elements.
	
3.	 After we made our adjustments in the raw converter, we clicked Open, 
and the photo opened in the image window in Photo Editor, as shown in 
Figure 4-7. From here, all we need are a few adjustments using the 
Shadow/Highlight dialog box, the Levels dialog box, and the Hue/
Saturation dialog box. (See Book VIII, Chapter 2 for information on using 
these image-enhancement settings.)

Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
Now that you understand how the 
overall process of making adjust­
ments works, follow these steps to 
make adjustments in your own 
photos:
	
1.	 Open an image in the raw 
converter.
	
	 Either use a Camera Raw file or 
choose File➪Open As and open 
a JPEG or TIFF file. In the Open 
As drop-down list from within 
the Open As dialog box, choose 
Camera Raw. (A long list of files 
supported follows the Camera 
Raw option.)
	
2.	 Turn on Shadow and Highlight 
Clipping.
	
	 Click the up-pointing arrows 
above the histogram in the right 
pane of the Camera Raw con­
verter (refer to Figure 4-1). 
Clicking the arrows turns on the 
clipping views.
	
3.	 Select an option from the 
White Balance drop-down menu.
	
	 For most images, just choose Auto. If you have a radical shift in white 
balance, such as the one shown in Figure 4-5, make a choice for another 
temperature setting that brings the image into an acceptable white bal­
ance. For the most part, just choose Auto for images that don’t have a 
radical shift in white balance.
	
4.	 Move the Exposure slider to bring the overall exposure into an accept­
able setting.
	
	 You visually examine the photo, looking for an overall brightness with­
out too much regard for the shadow and highlight clipping. You can 
recover the detail later. But realize that you will need to return to this 
slider after making other adjustments.
	
	 When moving sliders in the raw converter, you can double-click any 
slider to return that adjustment to the default.
	
5.	 Adjust Contrast.
	
	 Move the Contrast sliders to add some contrast. Adding contrast can 
help correct a flat appearance in the image.

6.	 Make decisions for clipping by adjusting the Shadows and Highlights 
sliders.
	
	 In many photos, you can’t recover all shadow and highlight data. You’ll 
see clipping often, especially with images taken with lower-end cameras. 
You may find that you have to let go of the idea for capturing all the 
highlight (or shadow detail). Look for general overall exposure being 
within an acceptable range.
	
7.	 Move the Blacks slider.
	
	 You want to look for a rich black in your photo. If the blacks look dirty 
and dingy, move the black slider to the right just far enough so that not 
much clipping occurs. If a few small areas are clipped, you want to leave 
the clipping in favor of adding richness in some of the black areas of 
your photo.
	
8.	 Adjust the Clarity.
	
	 Zoom in to your image to 400% or more by using the Zoom tool or press­
ing Ctrl+plus sign (+) or ⌘+plus sign (+). Move the Clarity slider to a set­
ting where the image pixels appear smooth without a speckled look.
	
9.	 Adjust Vibrance.
	
	 Be careful with the Vibrance adjustment. Make a small adjustment to 
make the photo appear vibrant but don’t overdo it.
	
	 Instead of using the last adjustment in the pane, use the Hue/Saturation 
dialog box in the Photo Editor after opening the image for better satura­
tion control.
	
10.	 Make Detail adjustments.
	
	 Click the Detail button at the top of the panel. Be certain that your view 
is 400% or more. These adjustments need to be made in a zoomed in 
view to see results of your edits:
	
•	 Sharpening images: You can choose to sharpen images here in the 
Camera Raw window or in Elements. Try to avoid sharpening here; 
instead, use the sharpening tools in Elements (as we explain in Book 
VIII, Chapter 1).
	
•	 Noise reduction: Includes options for adjusting the brightness and 
color. You’ve probably seen images with a lot of noise; in extreme 
cases, the pictures look like they were printed on sandpaper. Noise 
in an image is okay if that’s an effect you want to apply intentionally. 
If you want a smooth-looking image, however, you have to eliminate 
any noise introduced by the camera. Luminance Smoothing reduces 
grayscale noise. The next setting is Color Noise Reduction, which is 
used to reduce color noise.
	
	 Move sliders for sharpening and eyeball the results. Adjust the 
Luminance and Color sliders in zoomed-in views to see a smoothing 
of the image and lower grain effect.

232
Processing Files in the Camera Raw Converter
	
11.	 Preview the results.
	
	 Return to the Basic pane by clicking the Basic icon at the top of the 
pane. Deselect Preview and then select it again to toggle the preview. 
Look over your results. You may need to return to a few adjustments to 
fine-tune your corrections.
	
12.	 When you’re finished in the raw converter, click the Open Image 
button.
	
	 The photo opens in Photo Editor, where you can use the Enhance tools 
to fine-tune the brightness, contrast, and color correction. For more on 
using the Enhance menu features, look over the chapters in Book VIII.
	
13.	 After opening an image in the Photo Editor, choose File➪Save As and 
save the file under a new filename. For the file format, choose either 
Photoshop (*.PSD) or TIFF (*.TIF) to prevent the sort of data loss that 
occurs when you save an image in JPEG format.
	
	 When you save the file under a different name, you preserve the original 
raw image, and you can return to the raw converter, make other adjust­
ments, and open the file in Elements again to tweak the brightness and 
color.

T

o produce great output, you have to understand color and how 
Elements treats color. If you want to carry around a laptop computer to 
show off your photos, you can basically adjust color for that particular com­
puter. However, sharing photos with other users, printing your pictures, 
and hosting photos on websites require that you know something about the 
way color is displayed on other devices and in photo prints.
There’s a lot to know about handling color, including set­
ting up color workspaces, managing color, and working 
with color profiles. In this chapter, we talk about these 
issues and offer some key concepts for understand­
ing and using color as it pertains to Photoshop 
Elements.
Dealing with Foreground and 
Background Colors
Foreground and background colors appear in the Tools 
panel as large color swatches. What you see in the two-
color swatches represents the currently selected color for a 
foreground and the currently selected color for the background.

234
Defining Color
	
	 By default, the foreground color is black, and the background color is white. 
You can change the foreground and background colors by making color 
selections from the Color Picker or the Swatches panel or by clicking the 
Color Picker tool and lifting a color from an image. (You find out how each 
method works in the next section.)
You can use colors that appear in the Foreground Color Swatch to fill type 
selections, shapes, and strokes, as well as when using tools to apply color. 
You can also use the current background color when using the Eraser tool to 
erase to the background color.
	
A couple of keyboard shortcuts are helpful when working with the fore­
ground and background color swatches. You’ll use the following keyboard 
shortcuts frequently, so you might as well commit them to memory:
	
✓	D: Press the D key to return to the default black for the foreground color 
and the default white for the background color.
	
✓	X: Press the X key, and the foreground and background colors are 
reversed. You might want to use this keyboard shortcut when painting 
black and white areas with one of the marking tools.
	
You can also click the two arrows adjacent to the upper right of the 
Foreground Color Swatch to reverse colors, or click the tiny icon adjacent to 
the lower right of the Foreground Color Swatch to return to default colors.
Defining Color
When you want to use a color for the foreground or background other than 
the default black and white colors, you make your color assignments using 
tools, panels, or dialog boxes.
All the colors available for a given color mode are accessible from the 
Swatches panel and the Photoshop Elements Color Picker. The range of col­
ors shown in an image is also accessible through sampling color with the 
Color Picker tool.
Poking around the Color Picker
The Color Picker provides you with a color spectrum displaying all the col­
ors available within a given color mode. If you’re in RGB mode, you can 
choose from a color panel of more than 16.7 million colors. (See Chapter 3 of 
this minibook for an introduction to RGB mode.)

235
Book III
Chapter 5
Using and 
Managing Color
Defining Color
To open the Color 
Picker, click the 
Foreground Color 
Swatch in the Tools 
panel. The Color 
Picker pops up in a 
dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 5-1. The 
choices you have for 
selecting color and 
the options available 
to you in this dialog 
box are as follows:
	
A.	Color panel: The 
large color 
swatch displays 
colors according 
to the position of 
the color spec­
trum slider.
	
B.	New Color 
Choice: Clicking a 
color in the color panel selects a new color for the foreground color.
	
C.	Warning: Not Web Safe Color: Not all colors display equally in both the 
Mac and Windows operating systems in 8-bit mode when you’re viewing 
web pages. If a color is out of the Web Safe color palette, a cube icon 
appears.
	
	The Web Safe palette was introduced more than 15 years ago to create a 
color palette that used common colors between computer systems with 
8-bit video cards. It’s almost nonessential today because nearly all com­
puter systems use 24-bit color. You can safely ignore this warning.
	
D.	Select Closest Web Safe Color: Click this icon to select the closest Web 
Safe color value relative to the new color.
	
E.	Current Foreground Color: When you open the Color Picker, the color 
that appears in the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools panel is dis­
played here. The Current Foreground Color Swatch and the New Color 
Choice Swatch show you a before/after difference between the current 
color and any new color that you select in the color panel.
	
F.	HSB values: This measure relates to Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. 
These values are the RGB equivalents for HSB.
Figure 5-1: The Photoshop Elements Color Picker.

236
Defining Color
	
G.	RGB values: The numeric values for Red, Green, and Blue. As you 
choose other colors in the large color panel or by sliding the color spec­
trum slider, these values and the HSB values change to reflect the new 
color swatch at the top of the Color Picker.
	
H.	Only Web Colors: Select this check box if you want to view only Web 
Safe colors.
	
I.	Color Spectrum slider: Move the slider up or down to change the hue 
and display a new hue range in the large color panel.
	
J.	Hexadecimal values: Colors are defined using specific hexadecimal 
values (or hex values for short). The hex value is displayed here for 
the new color. You may find hexadecimal numbers valuable when inte­
grating Elements photos and projects with programs such as Adobe 
Fireworks and Adobe Dreamweaver. These programs specify color in 
hex values, which are sometimes used to specify color in web page 
design.
To define a new foreground color, do the following:
	
1.	 Click the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools panel.
	
	 The Color Picker opens.
	
2.	 Move the color spectrum slider to the hue range that you want to use 
for the new color.
	
	 For example, if you want to select a blue color, move the slider up to the 
range of blues.
	
3.	 Click the cursor in the large color panel to select a color.
	
	 The new selected color appears as a rectangle in the New area above the 
current foreground color. (Refer to Figure 5-1.)
	
4.	 Click OK.
	
	 The new foreground color selected in the Color Picker appears in the 
Foreground Color Swatch.
	
If you want to change the background color, click the Background Color Swatch 
in the Tools panel, and the same Color Picker opens. (Refer to Figure 5-1.) 
Any changes you make in the Color Picker are applied to the background 
color.
Grabbing color from the Color Swatches panel
Selecting color in the Color Picker is fine when you want to make a single 
color selection and use it once. However, if you want to create your own

custom color panel and reuse colors, 
you want an easier method for 
choosing foreground and back­
ground colors — and a way to reuse 
the same colors easily.
The Color Swatches panel provides 
you with exactly what you need to 
create a personal color panel and 
easily access colors when painting 
on a canvas or filling selections in an 
image.
To open the Color Swatches panel, 
choose Window➪Color Swatches. 
The Color Swatches panel, shown in 
Figure 5-2, opens as a floating panel.
When you open the Color Swatches 
panel, you see a default panel of colors. Elements provides you with a num­
ber of different color panels that you can load into the Color Swatches panel. 
The choices also enable you to create your own custom color panel, as we 
describe later in the section “Creating a custom swatch set.”
Using preset color panels
If you open the Default drop-down list in the Color Swatches panel, you find 
several preset color panels that you can load in the Color Swatches panel, as 
shown in Figure 5-3. Here’s a quick introduction to each of your choices:
	
✓	Mac OS: If you’re using a Mac and looking at an image created on a 
Windows machine, choose this option to load a color panel that displays 
color accurately on the Mac. If you’re using OS X Snow Leopard or 
higher, the colors are identical between platforms.
	
✓	Photo Filter Colors: This swatch set is a narrow range of colors consis­
tent with those you apply using Photo Filters. (For a look at how Photo 
Filters are used, see Book VII, Chapter 1.)
	
✓	Web Hues: This swatch set displays hues that are Web Safe colors. 
Because most computers use 24-bit color, you needn’t be concerned 
with Web Safe colors for web designs.
	
✓	Web Safe Colors: This set of swatches displays colors in a Web Safe 
panel. As with hues, you aren’t likely to use Web Safe colors for any 
designs.

238
Defining Color
	
✓	Web Spectrum: This swatch set 
displays the entire spectrum of 
Web Safe colors.
	
✓	Windows: This color set con­
tains all the colors that display 
properly on a Windows 
machine.
Creating a custom swatch set
The Color Picker has all the colors 
you can use in a given color mode. 
You may want to add more colors to 
one of the color swatch sets when 
you select different colors in the 
Color Picker. You might also want to 
delete some colors from a swatch 
set, or you may want to save your 
new swatch set as a library that you 
can load in Elements so that you can 
use the new custom colors.
All this is possible in Elements, and here’s how you go about creating your 
own custom panel of color swatches:
	
1.	 Choose Window➪Color Swatches to open the Color Swatches.
	
2.	 Delete colors from the Default panel.
	
	 Choose a color that you don’t want to appear in your custom color 
panel. Press the Alt (Option) key, and the cursor changes to a Scissors 
icon. Click a color swatch with the Alt (Option) key depressed to delete 
the color. Continue deleting all the colors that you don’t want in your 
custom color set.
	
3.	 Select a new color to add to your custom color set and make that new 
color the foreground color.
	
	 Click the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools panel. When the Color 
Picker opens, click a color that you want to add to your new set. Click 
OK, and the new color appears as the foreground color.
	
4.	 Add the foreground color to the set.
	
	 Click the Panel menu icon in the Color Swatches panel to open a flyout 
menu. From the menu choices, choose New Swatch. The Color Swatch 
Name dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-4. The color is derived 
Figure 5-3: Preset choices in the Color 
Swatches panel.

from the current foreground 
color to the left of the Name text 
box. Type a name for the color 
swatch and click OK. The 
new swatch is added to the 
Color Swatches panel.
	
5.	 Add additional colors.
	
	 Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to add new colors to the Swatches panel.
	
6.	 Save the swatches.
	
	 Open the Panel menu and choose Save Swatches. A Save dialog box 
opens with the Color Swatches folder selected as the target folder. Be 
sure to not change the folder location. Type a name for your new 
swatches and click OK.
	
If you want to share color swatches with other Elements users or users of 
many Adobe programs such as Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, and 
Flash Pro, use the menu option Save Swatches for Exchange. For more on 
exchanging swatches, see the section “Using Adobe Kuler,” later in this 
chapter.
You have saved a set of swatches without disturbing the original Default set. 
You can always return to the Default set by selecting Default. The original 
set remains intact.
Loading swatches
If you created a custom set of color swatches and then chose one of the pre­
sets from the Default drop-down list, the custom colors you created aren’t 
visible in the Color Swatches panel. To see them there and use them, you 
have to load the swatches back into the Color Swatches panel.
To load swatches, open the Panel menu and choose Load Swatches. A Load 
dialog box appears with the target folder pointing to the Elements Color 
Swatches folder. Here you find all the custom color swatches you saved from 
the Color Swatches panel. Select a file in the Load dialog box and click Open. 
The custom color swatches set opens in the Color Swatches panel.
Replacing swatches
If you want to replace colors in an existing Color Swatches panel, you can do 
so by choosing Replace Swatches on the Panel menu. After the Load dialog 
box opens, select a file in the Custom Colors folder, and the colors in the file 
you selected replace the existing swatches.
Figure 5-4: Type a name and click OK to add a 
color to your Color Swatches panel.

240
Defining Color
Another item on the menu is Save Swatches for Exchange. If you want to 
exchange the palette with another user, choose this command. A Save dialog 
box opens that defaults to the Color Swatches folder location inside your 
Elements 12 folder. When you provide a name and click Save, the file is 
saved with an ASE extension. ASE is the Adobe Swatch Exchange format. You 
can save color swatches in this format, and you can load swatches saved in 
this format in a number of different Adobe applications, including Elements 
12. If you send the ASE file to another Elements user, he or she can then load 
the palette into Elements by following the steps outlined in the section 
“Loading Adobe Kuler themes into Elements,” later in this chapter.
Lifting and sampling color
If you have a photo that has colors you want to add to your Color Swatches, 
you can sample colors in an open image.
	
	 Click the Color Picker tool and click anywhere on a photo in the image win­
dow, and the Color Picker samples the color. We call this technique lifting 
color, although the color isn’t removed from the photo. (It merely replaces 
the current foreground color.) If you want to replace the background color, 
press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click the Color Picker tool on a 
color you want to sample.
In the Options panel, you find a few settings for 
the Color Picker tool. Click the Color Picker tool 
in the Tools panel and click one of the three 
choices in the Options panel, as shown in Figure 
5-5. The list items are
	
✓	Point Sample: This selection is the default. 
When you click the Color Picker tool to sam­
ple color, the pixel you click is the sampled 
color.
	
✓	3 by 3 Average: This menu choice averages 3 
x 3 pixels, and the sampled color is the result 
of combining the color at the sample point with 8 surrounding colors.
	
✓	5 by 5 Average: This menu choice averages 5 x 5 pixels, and the sam­
pled color is the result of combining the color at the sample point with 
24 surrounding colors.
	
You can sample colors in a photo and use the sampled colors to create a 
custom Color Swatch library.

Picker tool and click a choice

Using Adobe Kuler
For people without skill in fine art, one of the difficult aspects of working 
with color is creating color palettes. What colors are complementary? What 
colors work well together? What color combinations are visually pleasing in 
designs?
Adobe Kuler (http://kuler.adobe.com) is a free community that can 
help you answer these questions. On the Kuler website, you can explore 
color themes that you might want to use in Elements projects and share 
color themes that you create with other users. In the following sections, you 
find out how to start using Adobe Kuler and explore the tools and sharing 
services it offers.
Getting started with Adobe Kuler
Before you log on to the Adobe Kuler website, you need to acquire an Adobe 
ID. You can visit the site without an Adobe ID, but to acquire themes that 
you can load in the Elements Photo Editor Color Swatches panel (which we 
describe earlier, in the section “Loading swatches”), you need to have an 
Adobe ID.
After you’ve acquired an Adobe ID, visit http://kuler.adobe.com. When 
the web page opens, provide your logon information (e-mail address and 
password) and click Sign In. That’s it. You’re in and ready to acquire some 
color themes.
	
If you ever need help using Adobe Kuler, click the User Forums link at the 
bottom of any page to visit the Adobe Community page for Kuler. Here, the 
best place to find help with a topic is the Frequently Asked Questions 
section.
Exploring color themes
On the Kuler website, the color themes are the main attraction. To see 
themes that others have uploaded, click the Explore link, and you arrive at a 
screen like the one shown in Figure 5-6. You can limit the selection based on 
criteria such as the newest themes or the most used themes. Or use the 
search box to type a keyword that reflects the colors you want to explore, 
such as skies, leaves, foliage, landscapes, or retro. 

242
Using Adobe Kuler
Figure 5-6: Log on to the Kuler website and click Explore, to see color themes that others 
have uploaded, which you can edit or download for your own use.
When you click a theme, you see 
options for editing the theme, copy­
ing the link, and downloading the 
color as a color swatch file that you 
can load in Photoshop Elements 
(refer to Figure 5-7).
When you hover over a theme or 
select it to see its details, Adobe 
Kuler offers you a few options:
	
✓	Favorite: Click the heart-shaped 
Favorite icon to save a theme to a list of your personal favorites so that 
you can find it again easily. To see your favorite themes, move to the 
MyThemes area and then click My Favorites.
	
✓	Edit: Click the Edit icon with three sliders and you’re able to customize 
someone else’s theme to your liking. For example, you can make one hue 
a little darker or lighter, or change some colors altogether. To do so, use 
the color slider under each color, or search for another starting swatch 
by moving the swatch’s corresponding dial on the color wheel. When 
you’re done editing the theme, you can save a copy of it to your My 
Themes area. 
	
✓	Copy Link: Clicking this chain-link icon copies a link to the color theme 
to your computer’s Clipboard. You can the paste the link wherever you 
like by pressing Ctrl+V or choosing the Paste command from a context 
menu.
Figure 5-7: When you click a color theme, 
you see more options that enable you to add 
as a favorite, edit the theme, copy the link or, 
download the swatch file.

✓	Download: When you move the cursor over a Theme and click the 
Download button, the file is downloaded to your computer. If you save 
that file to your hard drive, you can then use the file to upload the theme 
into Elements, as we explain in the section “Loading Adobe Kuler 
themes into Elements,” later in this chapter.
Creating your own color theme in Kuler
You have two choices for creating a color swatch. You can move colors 
around the color wheel to select five different colors. The values are 
displayed below the five different swatches. When you have the colors 
selected, click the Save button and the new color set is saved to your per­
sonal Themes. See Figure 5-8.
The other choice you have is to upload a photo. When the photo is uploaded 
Kuler creates a sample of the colors. You can resample different areas of the 
photo using the Color Picker tool. When you have the colors you want, click 
the Save button and the swatch set is saved to your personal Themes.
Figure 5-8: Click the Create button.
	
If you like creating color themes from photos and have an iPhone, check out 
the Adobe Kuler iPhone app. Just load a photo from your Camera Roll into 
the app. Kuler can then plot five points that create a theme from the colors 
in your photo. You can move the points around the photo and modify the 
color set from those colors you want to use. In the future, expect to see a 

244

similar feature available to everyone (not just iPhone users) on the Adobe 
Kuler website.
Getting themes from master artists
One truly great opportunity that’s available with Search is exploring color 
combinations used by master artists. You might like wonderful earth tones 
used by Cézanne; bright colors used by Matisse; consistency across colors 
used by Da Vinci; or the colors used by Van Gogh, Picasso, Michelangelo, 
Rembrandt, Rivera, and more. 
Just type the artist’s name and press Enter/Return or click the search icon 
adjacent to the Search text box. The search results display color sets used in 
various paintings by the artist you entered as shown in Figure 5-9, where we 
searched for Van Gogh.
You can also search for colors contained in a variety of different themes 
such as skies, earth tones, landscapes, and so on.

Loading Adobe Kuler themes into Elements
This section explains how to load a theme you’ve downloaded from Kuler 
into the Elements Color Swatches panel. (For an introduction to this panel, 
see the earlier section “Grabbing color from the Color Swatches panel.”)
In Kuler, you can export any color theme you like as an ASE file by clicking 
the Download tool when your cursor hovers over a Theme. To then load the 
theme for use in Elements, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Save the ASE file to the Elements Color Swatches folder on your hard 
drive.
	
	 You can save your color swatch anywhere on your hard drive, but if you 
want it to be available in the Color Swatches panel, save the file to the 
Color Swatches folder.
	
	 In Windows, the directory path is Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop 
Elements 12\Presets\Color Swatches. 
	
	 On the Macintosh, the path is Applications/Adobe Photoshop 
Elements 12/Settings/Presets/Color Swatches.
	
2.	 Load the color set by choosing Load Swatches from the Color 
Swatches panel menu in the Photo Editor.
	
3.	 When the Load dialog box opens, select Swatch Exchange (*ASE) from 
the Files of Type drop-down list (Windows) or Format pop-up menu 
(Macintosh).
	
4.	 Select the file or files you want to load in Elements. 
	
	 If you want several color sets in a single color palette, download individ­
ual color sets from Kuler. Delete all colors in your Color Swatches panel 
and load each of your downloaded color sets. Save the final composite 
as a single color palette to the Color Swatches folder inside the Elements 
12 folder.
Understanding Color Management Essentials
In Elements, the challenge with color isn’t understanding color theory or def­
initions, but rather matching the RGB color you see on your computer moni­
tor as closely as possible to your output. That output can be a printout from 
a color printer, a screen view on a web page, or an image in a photo-slide 
presentation.
We say match “as closely as possible” because you can’t expect to achieve 
an exact match; you have far too many printer and monitor variables to deal 
with. However, if you properly manage color, you can get a very close 
match.

246
Understanding Color Management Essentials
To match color in your monitor and your output, you must calibrate your 
monitor and then choose a color workspace profile. In the following sec­
tions, you can find all the details on how to do just that.
Discovering color channels
Your first level of color mastery in Photoshop is to understand what RGB is 
and how it comes about. RGB stands for red, green, and blue. These are the 
primary colors in the computer world. Forget about what you know about 
primary colors in an analog world; computers see primary colors as RGB.
RGB color is divided into color channels. Although you can’t see the individ­
ual channels in Elements, you still need to get a handle on color channels. 
When you see a color pixel (a tiny, square dot), the color is represented as 
different levels of gray in each channel. (This may sound confusing at first, but 
stay with us for just a minute.) When you have a color channel, such as the 
red channel, and you let all light pass through the channel, you end up with a 
bright red. If you screen that light a little with a gray filter, you let less light 
pass through, thereby diluting the red color. That’s how channels work — 
individually, they all use different levels of gray that permit up to 256 differ­
ent levels of light to pass through them. When you change the intensity of 
light in the different channels, you ultimately change the color.
Each channel can have up to 256 lev­
els of gray that mask out light. You 
can calculate the total number of 
possible colors that you can create 
in an RGB model by multiplying the 
values for each channel (256 × 256 × 
256). The result is more than 16.7 
million; that’s the total number of 
colors a computer monitor can dis­
play in RGB color.
This is all well and good as far as 
theory goes, but what does that 
mean in practical terms? Actually, 
you see some of this information in 
tools and dialog boxes you work 
with in Elements. As an experiment, 
open a file in Elements and choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels (or 
press Ctrl+L/⌘+L); the Levels dialog 
box, shown in Figure 5-10, opens.
Figure 5-10: Choose Enhance➪Adjust 
Lighting➪Levels to open the Levels dialog box.

247
Book III 
Chapter 5
Using and 
Managing Color
Understanding Color Management Essentials
The Channel drop-down list shows you Red, Green, and Blue as individual 
channels, as well as a composite RGB selection. Furthermore, the Output 
Levels area shows you values ranging from 0 on the left to 255 on the right. 
Considering that 0 is a number, you have a total of 256 different levels of 
gray.
	
What’s important is that you know that your work in color is related to RGB 
images that make up three different channels. Each channel can let 256 dif­
ferent levels of gray through — that is, hold back different amounts of light — 
to change brightness values and color.
Understanding bit depth
Another important item to understand about channels is bit depth. A bit holds 
one of two values; one value is for black, the other for white. When you have 
256 levels of gray, you’re working with an 8-bit-per-channel image — 8 bits 
with 2 possible values each is 28, or 256 possible levels of gray. Multiply 8 
bits per channel times your 3 channels, and you get 24 bits, which is the 
common bit depth of images you print on your desktop printer.
Now take a look at the Image➪Mode 
submenu. You should see a menu 
selection that says 8 Bits/Channel, 
as shown in Figure 5-11. When you 
open an image in Elements, if this 
menu command is grayed out, it 
means that you’re working with a 
24-bit image — an image of 8 bits 
per channel.
What does it mean when you can 
select the 8 Bits/Channel menu com­
mand? You can be certain that your 
image isn’t an 8-bit-per-channel 
image. You may be able to select 
this command because some digital 
cameras and most low-end, 
consumer-grade scanners can capture images at higher bit depths. Using a 
scanner, you can scan a photo at 16 bits per channel. When you do, you end 
up with many more levels of gray. When you take a picture with a quality 
digital camera, you can capture 32-bit-per-channel images, and you end up 
with a file containing more than 4 billion levels of gray. That’s a lot!
Figure 5-11: When you can choose 8 Bits/
Channel, the image bit depth is higher than 8 
bits per channel.

248
Understanding Color Management Essentials
Now, here’s the catch: All files have to be reduced to 8 bits per channel 
before you print them — because that’s all the information any printer uses. 
In addition, many tools, commands, and panel options work only with 8-bit-
per-channel images. So, you ask, “What’s the benefit of acquiring images at 
higher bit depths than I can print?”
	
If you attempt to adjust brightness, contrast, or other image enhancements 
in an 8-bit-per-channel image, you often destroy some data. You can cause 
some noticeable image degradation if you move adjustment sliders too far 
while working with 8-bit-per-channel images. When you edit your 16-bit and 
32-bit images, you don’t destroy data — you simply inform Elements which 
256 levels of gray (of the total number available) you want to use. The result 
is an image with more continuous gray tones than you can achieve in 8-bit-
per-channel images.
Calibrating your monitor
You need to calibrate your monitor to adjust the gamma and brightness; cor­
rect any color tints or colorcasts; and generally to display, as precisely as 
possible, accurate colors on your output. You have a few choices for which 
tool you can use to adjust monitor brightness, ranging from a low-cost 
hardware device that sells for less than $100 to expensive calibration equip­
ment of $3,000 or more — or you can skip the hardware and use tools pro­
vided by Adobe, Windows, or your Mac.
	
Gamma is the brightness of midlevel tones in an image. In technical terms, 
it’s a parameter that describes the shape of the transfer function for one or 
more stages in an imaging pipeline.
We skip the high-end costly devices and software utilities that don’t do you 
any good and suggest that you make, at the very least, one valuable pur­
chase for creating a monitor profile: a hardware profiling system. On the low 
end of the price scale, some affordable versions of this device go a long way 
toward helping you adjust your monitor brightness and color balance, 
including the following:
	
✓	Datacolor Spyder4Express S4X100 Display Calibration Device by 
Datacolor: For as low as $99, you can purchase an easy-to-use, three-
step calibration device to balance the color on your monitor and adjust 
it for optimum brightness. This device is receiving five-star ratings at 
online resellers, including www.amazon.com.
	
✓	Pantone huey MEU101: This is another low-cost system used for cali­
brating both CRTs and LCDs. This unit sells for $69.99 at Amazon.com, 
as of this writing.

249
Book III 
Chapter 5
Using and 
Managing Color
Understanding Color Management Essentials
	
✓	X-Rite CMUNSML ColorMunki Smile: This device, like the 
Spyder4Express and huey, is an easy-to-use profiling tool that works 
with CRT displays, LCDs, and laptop computers. It sells for $99. You 
attach the unit via a USB port and click a few buttons in the software 
application accompanying the hardware. The profile you create is 
used automatically by your operating system when you start your com­
puter. When the profile kicks in, your monitor is balanced with the set­
tings that were determined when the device performed the calibration.
On LCD monitors, you adjust the hardware controls to bring your monitor 
into a match for overall brightness with your photo prints. Make sure that 
you run many test prints and match your prints against your monitor view 
to make the two as similar as possible.
You have a lot to focus on to calibrate monitors and get color right on your 
monitor and your output. (We talk more about color output in Book IX, 
Chapter 2.) For a good resource for color correction and printing using 
Photoshop Elements, we recommend that you look at Color Management for 
Digital Photographers For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (pub­
lished by Wiley).
Establishing your color settings
After you adjust your monitor color by using a hardware profiling system, 
your next step is to choose your color workspace. In Elements, you have a 
choice between one of two workspace colors: either sRGB or Adobe RGB 
(1998). You access your color workspace settings by choosing Edit➪Color 
Settings. The Color Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-12.
Figure 5-12: The Color Settings dialog box.

250
Understanding Color Management Essentials
The options you have in the Color Settings dialog box are
	
✓	No Color Management: This choice turns off all color management. 
Don’t choose this option for any work you do in Elements. You use No 
Color Management when you work with files that have color profiles 
embedded in the photos. Most likely you won’t be using these types of 
photos. (For more about when you might use this option, see Book IX, 
Chapter 2.)
	
✓	Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens: Selecting this radio but­
ton sets your workspace to sRGB. sRGB color is used quite often for 
viewing images on your monitor. But this workspace often results in the 
best choice for color printing, as well. Many color printers can output all 
the colors you can see in the sRGB workspace. In addition, many photo 
services, such as the Kodak EasyShare services (discussed in Book IX, 
Chapter 2), prefer this workspace setting.
	
✓	Always Optimize for Printing: Selecting this option sets your color 
workspace to Adobe RGB (1998). This workspace has more available col­
ors than can be seen on your monitor. If you choose this workspace, you 
need to be certain that your printer is capable of using all the colors in 
this color space.
	
✓	Allow Me to Choose: When you select this option, Elements prompts 
you for a profile assignment when you open images that contain no pro­
file. This setting is handy if you switch back and forth between screen 
and print images.
Understanding how profiles work
You probably created a monitor color profile when you calibrated your mon­
itor. You probably also selected a color profile when you opened the Color 
Settings dialog box and selected your workspace color. When you start your 
computer, your monitor color profile kicks in and adjusts your overall moni­
tor brightness and correction for any color casts. When you open a photo in 
Elements, color is automatically converted from your monitor color space to 
your workspace color.
At print time, you use another color profile to output your photos to your 
desktop color printer. Color is then converted from your workspace color to 
your printer’s color space. In Book IX, Chapter 2, we show you how to use 
color profiles for printing. For now, just realize that the proper use of color 
profiles determines whether you can get good color output. From here, you 
can jump to Book IX, Chapter 2, and understand how the color profiles are 
used at print time.

S

ometimes you get lucky, and what you capture in the camera’s view­
finder is exactly what you want to edit, print, or share online. But at 
other times, you may want to work with only a portion of that image. Maybe 
you just need to adjust the contrast in a certain area, or you want to com­
bine part of one image with another. In these instances, you have to make a 
selection before you can go on to do the real editing work.
Being able to make accurate selections is a valuable skill. Fortunately, 
Elements offers an assortment of tools for making selections. In 
this chapter, we give you the foundation to use the basic 
selection tools. If, after you make a selection, you want to 
modify or transform that selection, check out the next 
chapter. Finally, masking is another way to make a 
selection. Be sure to look at Book VI, Chapter 4, for 
the lowdown on masking.
Defining Selections
Defining a selection means that you specify which 
part of the image you want to work with. Everything 
within a selection is considered selected. Everything 
outside the selection is unselected. Seems simple enough. 
It is, except that you can also have partially selected pixels, 
which allow for soft-edged, diffused selections. You can create 

254
Selecting a Rectangular or an Elliptical Area
partially selected pixels by feathering, masking, or anti-aliasing the selection. 
We cover feathering and anti-aliasing in this chapter. Masking is covered in 
Book VI, Chapter 4.
When you make a selection, a moving dotted outline known as a selection 
border (also called a selection outline or selection marquee) appears around 
the selected area. After you’ve made a selection, any adjustments or edits 
you apply affect only that portion. The unselected areas remain unchanged. 
You can also make a selection in one image and then copy and paste it into 
another image. If you can’t squeeze in that trip to Europe this year, no wor­
ries: Select yourself from a family photo, choose Edit➪Copy, open a stock 
photo of the Eiffel Tower, and then choose Edit➪Paste. Nobody will know 
that you never made it to the City of Lights.
	
When making selections, be sure that you’re working in the Photo Editor, in 
Expert mode, and not in Quick or Guided modes, or in the Organizer. For 
more on various modes in Elements, see Book I, Chapter 1.
Selecting a Rectangular or an Elliptical Area
The Marquee tools are the easiest selection tools to use. Basically, if you 
can use a mouse or a trackpad without much difficulty, you can become a 
marqueeing expert.
The Rectangular Marquee tool creates rectangular or square selections. Use 
this tool when you want to grab just a portion of an image and copy and 
paste it into a new, blank document or into another image.
Follow these steps to make a selection with the Rectangular Marquee tool:
	
1.	 Select the Rectangular Marquee tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 The tool looks like a dotted square. You can also use the keyboard 
shortcut — press the M key. If the tool isn’t visible, press M again, or 
you can select the Rectangular Marquee tool from the Tool Options.
	
2.	 Click and drag from one corner of the area that you want to select to 
the opposite corner.
	
	 While you drag, the selection border appears. The border follows the 
movement of your mouse cursor (a crosshair or plus sign icon).
	
3.	 Release your mouse button.
	
	 You now have a rectangular selection, as shown in Figure 1-1.

Figure 1-1: The Rectangular Marquee selects part of your image.
The Elliptical Marquee tool creates elliptical or circular selections. You can 
select clocks, doughnuts, inner tubes, and other round objects with this 
tool.
Here are the steps to create an elliptical selection:
	
1.	 Select the Elliptical Marquee tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also use the keyboard shortcut — press the M key. If the tool 
isn’t visible, press M again, or you can select the Elliptical Marquee tool 
from the Tool Options.
	
2.	 Position the crosshair near the area you want to select, click the area, 
and then click and drag around the element.
	
	 While you drag, the selection marquee appears.
	
3.	 When you’re satisfied with your selection, release the mouse button.
	
	 Your elliptical selection is complete, as shown in Figure 1-2.

Figure 1-2: The Elliptical Marquee selects rotund elements.
	
If your selection isn’t quite centered on the element, move the selection bor­
der by clicking and dragging inside the border with either the Rectangular or 
Elliptical Marquee tool. You can also move a selection with either tool while 
you’re drawing by pressing the spacebar.
Fine-tuning squares and circles
If you want to create a perfect square or circle, hold down the Shift key after 
you begin dragging your mouse. When you have a selection, release the 
mouse button first and then release the Shift key.
You may find it easier to create an elliptical selection by dragging from the 
center outward. To do so, click and hold down the mouse button in the cen­
ter of an element. Then press the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and drag 
from the center outward. After you have your selection, release the mouse 
button first and then the key.
If you want to draw from the center outward and you want a perfect circle 
(or square), hold down the Shift key as well. When you have a selection, 
release your mouse button first and then press Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on 
the Mac).

Selecting a Rectangular or an Elliptical Area
	
You can achieve a perfect circle or square by specifying a 1:1 aspect ratio on 
the Tool Options.
Using the Marquee options
The Tool Options provide oodles of other options when you’re making 
Marquee selections. Some of these options allow you to make precise selec­
tions by specifying exact measurements. Others enable you to make soft-
edged, feathered selections.
	
You must select the options in the Tool Options, as shown in Figure 1-3, 
before you make your selection with the Marquee tools. The only exception 
is that you can feather a selection after you have created it. Note that to 
feather a selection, you must choose the menu command Select➪Feather.
Figure 1-3: Specify Marquee settings in the Tool Options.
Here’s the scoop on each Marquee option:
	
✓	Feather: Feathering softens, or feathers, the edges of a selection. The 
amount of softening depends on the value — the higher the value, the 
softer the edge, as shown in Figure 1-4. The radius measures how far in 
all directions the feather effect extends. You can use small amounts of 
feathering to create natural transitions between selected elements in a 
collage. Use larger amounts to create a special effect where one image 
gradually fades into another. If you just want a selected element to have 
a soft edge without the background, choose Select➪Inverse and then 
delete the background.
	
	To feather while you’re selecting, select the Feather option in the Tool 
Options before you use the Marquee tools. You can feather a selection 
after the fact by choosing Select➪Feather.

258

Figure 1-4: Feathering a selection softens the edges.
	
✓	Anti-aliasing: Whereas feathering completely softens edges, anti-aliasing 
just slightly softens the edge of an elliptical or irregularly shaped selec­
tion so that extremely hard, jagged edges aren’t quite so prominent, as 
shown in Figure 1-5. An anti-aliased edge is always only 1 pixel wide.
	
	We recommend keeping the Anti-aliasing option selected, especially if 
you plan on creating a collage of images. Anti-aliasing helps create 
natural-looking transitions and blends between multiple selections. 
However, if you want a supercrisp edge, deselect this option.
	
✓	Aspect: The Aspect drop-down menu contains three settings:
	
•	 Normal: This option enables you to freely drag a selection to any 
dimension.
	
•	 Fixed Ratio: This setting allows you to specify a fixed ratio of width 
to height in a selection. For example, if you enter 2 for width and 1 
for height, the Marquee selection you create is always twice as wide 
as it is high, no matter what the size.
	
•	 Fixed Size: This setting lets you specify values for the width and 
height. It comes in handy when you need to make multiple selections 
that must be the same exact size, such as in a school yearbook. 
Note that the marquee is immediately drawn when you click your 
canvas. The click point is the upper-left corner of the marquee.

259

Figure 1-5: Anti-aliasing barely softens selection edges.
	
✓	Width and Height: When you select Fixed Ratio or Fixed Size from the 
drop-down menu, you also enter values in the Width and Height text 
boxes. To swap the Width and Height values, click the double-headed 
arrow button.
	
	Even though the default unit of measurement in the Width and Height 
text boxes is pixels (px), you can enter any unit of measurement that 
Elements recognizes — pixels, inches (in), centimeters (cm), millimeters 
(mm), points (pt), picas (pica), or percents (%). Enter the value and then 
type the word or abbreviation of a unit of measurement.
The Refine Edge option is also available, but because you most likely won’t 
need it for a selection made with the Marquee tools, we explain it in the next 
section on Lasso selections.
Free-Form Selecting with the Lasso Tools
Unfortunately, not much in life is perfectly rectangular or elliptical in shape. 
Most of the time, you have to deal with irregular shapes that have undulations 

260
Free-Form Selecting with the Lasso Tools
of some kind or another. That’s where the Lasso tools come in handy. This 
group of tools enables you to make any free-form selection your heart 
desires.
Elements offers three Lasso tools: Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, and Magnetic 
Lasso. Each Lasso tool has its own special purpose in the world of free-form 
selections, and they’re simple to use. You just have to drag around the part 
of the image that you want to select. All that’s required is a decaffeinated, 
steady hand.
The selection you make is only as good as your accuracy in tracing around 
an element. If you don’t make an exact selection the first time around, don’t 
worry. You can always go back and make corrections, as described in the 
next chapter.
	
If, when making a selection, you find the mouse a little unwieldy, you may want 
to look into a digital drawing tablet, such as a Wacom tablet. Using a tablet 
makes using the Lasso tool — as well as other tools, such as the Brush — 
much easier. Tablet lovers claim that you’ll never revisit mouse usage again.
	
The Lasso and Polygonal Lasso tools have three settings in the Tool Options — 
Feather, Anti-aliasing, and Refine Edge. The first two options work exactly as 
they do with the Marquee tools. To find out about Feather and Anti-aliasing, 
see the preceding section. The Refine Edge option does exactly that — cleans 
up the edges of your selection. You also find this command in the Tool 
Options for the Marquee, Magic Wand, and Quick Selection tools. Keep in 
mind that you can apply this option to any existing selection, no matter how 
you created the selection, by choosing Select➪Refine Edge.
Here’s the scoop on the settings for the Refine Edge options:
	
✓	View Mode: Choose a mode from the drop-down menu to preview your 
selection. For example, Marching Ants shows the selection border. 
Overlay lets you preview your selection with the edges hidden and a 
semi-opaque layer of color in your unselected area. On Black and On 
White show the selection against a black or white background. Hover 
your cursor over each mode to see a tooltip. Show Original shows the 
image without a selection preview. Show Radius displays the image with 
the selection border.
	
✓	Smart Radius: Select this option to have Elements automatically adjust 
the radius for hard and soft edges near your selection border. If your 
border is uniformly hard or soft, you may not want to select this option. 
This enables you to have more control over the radius setting.

261
Book IV 
Chapter 1
Making Selections
Free-Form Selecting with the Lasso Tools
	
✓	Radius: Specify the size of the selection border you will refine. Increase 
the radius to improve the edge of areas with soft transitions or a lot of 
detail. Move the slider while looking at your selection to find a good 
setting.
	
✓	Smooth: Reduces jaggedness along your selection edges.
	
✓	Feather: Moves the slider to create an increasingly softer, more blurred 
edge.
	
✓	Contrast: Remov­es artifacts while tightening soft edges by increasing 
the contrast. Try using the Smart Radius option first before playing with 
Contrast.
	
✓	Shift Edge: Decreases or increases your selected area. Slightly decreas­
ing your selection border can help to defringe (eliminate undesirable 
background pixels) your selection edges.
	
✓	Decontaminate Colors: Replaces background fringe with the colors of 
your selected element. Note that because decontamination changes the 
colors of some of the pixels, you will have to output to, or create, 
another layer or document to preserve your current layer. To see the 
decontamination in action, choose Reveal Layer for your View mode.
	
✓	Amount: Changes the level of decontamination.
	
✓	Output To: Choose whether you want to output your refined, decontami­
nated selection to a selection on your current layer, layer mask, layer, 
layer with layer mask, new document, or new document with layer mask.
	
✓	Refine Radius tool: Brush around your border to adjust the area you are 
refining. To understand exactly what area is being included or excluded, 
change your View mode to Marching Ants. Use the right and left brack­
ets to decrease and increase the brush size.
	
✓	Erase Refinements tool: If your refinements were not so refined after all, 
brush around the border to restore your original edge.
	
✓	Zoom tool: Enables you to zoom into your image to see the effects of 
your settings.
	
✓	Hand tool: Lets you pan around the document window to see the effects 
of your settings on various portions of your image.
Using the Lasso tool
Making a selection with the Lasso tool is basically like tracing an outline 
around an element on a sheet of paper.

262
Free-Form Selecting with the Lasso Tools
To make a selection by using the Lasso tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 It’s the tool that looks like a rope — hence the moniker lasso. You can 
also use the keyboard shortcut by pressing the L key. If the Lasso isn’t 
visible, press L again to cycle through the various Lasso tools or grab 
your desired tool from the Tool Options.
	
2.	 Position the cursor anywhere along the edge of the element you want 
to select.
	
	 The hot spot (the leading point) of the Lasso cursor is the end of the 
rope. If you need a little visual help, press the Caps Lock key, which 
switches your cursor to a crosshair.
	
	 Zoom in on the image a bit if you need to better see its edges.
	
	 In our example, we started at the bottom of the butterfly wing, as shown 
in Figure 1-6.
	
3.	 Hold down the mouse button and trace around the element, trying to 
include only what you want to select.
	
	 While you trace, an outline forms that follows the movement of your 
mouse.
	
	 Don’t release the mouse button until you complete the selection by clos­
ing the loop and returning to your starting point. When you release the 
mouse button, Elements assumes that you’re done and closes the selec­
tion from wherever you release the mouse button to your starting point.
	
4.	 Continue tracing until you return to your starting point; release the 
mouse button.
	
	 Elements rewards you with a selection border that matches your Lasso 
path, as shown in Figure 1-7.
Selecting straight sides with the 
Polygonal Lasso tool
The Polygonal Lasso tool is at its best when selecting straight-sided sub­
jects, such as city skylines, buildings, and stairways. Unlike the Lasso tool, 
the Polygonal Lasso tool has rubber band–like qualities, and instead of drag­
ging, you click and release the mouse button at the vertices of the object 
you’re selecting.

263
Book IV 
Chapter 1
Making Selections
Free-Form Selecting with the Lasso Tools
Follow these steps to select with the Polygonal Lasso tool:
	
1.	 Select the Polygonal Lasso tool in the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also use the keyboard shortcut by pressing the L key. If the 
Polygonal Lasso isn’t visible, press L again to cycle through the Lasso 
tools or select the tool from the Tool Options. The Polygonal Lasso tool 
looks like the Lasso tool but has straight sides.
	
2.	 Click and release at any point along the edge of the desired element.
	
	 We like starting at a corner.

3.	 Move (don’t drag) the mouse and click and release at the next corner 
of the element; continue clicking and releasing at the various corners 
of the object.
	
	 The line stretches out from each corner you click, like a rubber band.
	
4.	 To close a selection, return to your starting point and click and 
release.
	
	 When you place the cursor over the starting point, a small circle 
appears next to the cursor, indicating that you’re at the right place for 
closing the selection. A selection marquee that matches your Polygonal 
Lasso path appears, as shown in Figure 1-8.

Some objects have both curves and straight sides. No problem. Hold down 
the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and then click and drag to select the 
curves. Your Polygonal Lasso tool temporarily transforms into the regular 
Lasso tool. Release the Alt (or Option) key to return to the Polygonal Lasso 
tool. This trick also works with the other Lasso tools.

Hugging edges with the Magnetic Lasso tool
The last Lasso tool is the Magnetic Lasso, which works by analyzing the col­
ors of the pixels between the elements in the foreground and the elements in 
the background. Then it snaps to, or hugs, the edge between the elements, 
as though the edge had a magnetic pull.
	
Not always the easiest tool to manipulate, the Magnetic Lasso tool performs 
best when your image has a well-defined foreground object and good con­
trast between that object and the background — for example, a dark moun­
tain range against a light sky or a black silhouette against a white wall.
The Magnetic Lasso tool has some unique settings, found in the Tool 
Options, which you can adjust to control the sensitivity of the tool and thus 
aid in your selection task.
	
We recommend starting out by experimenting with the Magnetic Lasso tool 
using its default settings. If the tool isn’t cooperating, play with the options.
The Feather, Anti-aliasing, and Refine Edge options work as they do with the 
Marquee and Lasso tools. Here are the remaining options:
	
✓	Width: This option, measured in pixels from 1 to 256, determines how 
close to the edge you have to move the mouse before the Magnetic 
Lasso tool snaps to that edge. Decrease the value if the object’s edge 
has a lot of indentations and protrusions or if the image has low con­
trast. Increase the value if the image has high contrast or smooth edges.
	
✓	Contrast: Measured in percentages from 1 to 100, this option specifies 
the contrast required between the object and its background before the 
Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to the edge. If the image has good contrast 
between the foreground element and its background, use a high 
percentage.
	
✓	Frequency: This setting, measured in percentages from 0 to 100, speci­
fies how many fastening points (points anchoring the selection line) to 
place on the selection line. The higher the value, the more fastening 
points used. If the element you want to select has a fairly smooth edge, 
keep the value low. If the edge is jagged or has a lot of detail, try a higher 
value to create a more accurate selection.
	
✓	Tablet Pressure (Pen icon): If you own a pressure-sensitive drawing tab­
let, select this option to make an increase in stylus pressure to cause the 
edge width to decrease.

266
Free-Form Selecting with the Lasso Tools
Follow these steps to use the Magnetic Lasso tool:
	
1.	 Select the Magnetic Lasso tool in the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also press the L key if the tool is visible. If it isn’t, press L again 
to cycle through the Lasso tools. The tool looks like a straight-sided 
lasso with a magnet on it.
	
2.	 Click and release on the edge of the element you want to select to 
place the first fastening point.
	
	 Start anywhere, but be sure to click the edge between the element you 
want and the background you don’t want.
	
3.	 Move your cursor around the object without clicking.
	
	 The Magnetic Lasso tool creates a selection line similar to the other 
lasso tools while placing fastening points that anchor the selection line 
(see Figure 1-9). Think of it as the way you might cordon off an area of 
your yard with ropes and stakes.

	 Here are a couple tips to keep in mind when working with the Magnetic 
Lasso tool:
	
•	 If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts veering off the edge of your object, 
back up your mouse and click and release to force a fastening point 
farther down along the edge.

Performing Wand Wizardry
The Magic Wand has been around since the early days of the digital-imaging 
era. You’d think with a name like Magic Wand, it’d grant your every selection 
wish with a mere click. Well, yes and no. The success of the Magic Wand 
depends on your particular image.
The Magic Wand is a no-brainer to operate: Click the element you want 
within your image, and the Magic Wand makes a selection. This selection is 
based on the color of the pixel (the target pixel) directly under the cursor 
when you click. If other pixels are similar in color to your target pixel, 
Elements includes them in the selection. What’s sometimes hard to predict, 
however, is how to determine how similar the color has to be to get the 
Magic Wand tool to select it. That’s where the Tolerance setting comes in. 
First, here’s a little info on tolerance so that you can better wield the Wand.
Talking about tolerance
The Tolerance setting determines the range of color that the Magic Wand 
tool selects. The issue is that most images contain a few shades of a similar 
color. For example, consider an image of a field of grass. A few shades of 
green make up that field. Using the Magic Wand tool, if you click a darker 
shade of green, it selects all similar shades of green, but the lighter shades 
remain unselected, which is a sign that you need to increase the tolerance 
level to select all shades of the green grass. Tolerance is based on bright­
ness levels that range from 0 to 255. That being said,
	
✓	Setting the tolerance to 0 selects only one color.
	
✓	Setting the tolerance to 255 selects all colors, or the entire image.

268
Performing Wand Wizardry
The default setting is 32, so whenever you click a pixel, Elements analyzes 
the value of that base color and then selects all pixels whose brightness lev­
els are between 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker.
	
What if an image contains a few shades of the same color? It’s not a huge 
problem. You can try different Tolerance settings: 
	
✓	If you didn’t quite pick up what you wanted in the first try, as shown 
in Figure 1-10, try a higher Tolerance setting. 
	
✓	If your wand selects too much, you can also lower your Tolerance set­
ting, or you can make multiple clicks of the Magic Wand, with the Shift 
key pressed down, to pick up additional pixels that you want to include 
in the selection.

Selecting with the Magic Wand tool
	
The Magic Wand tool works best when you have high-contrast images or 
images with a limited number of colors. For example, the optimum image for 
the Wand is a solid-colored object on a white background. Skip the Wand if 
the image has a ton of colors and no real definitive contrast between your 
element and the background.
To make a selection with the Magic Wand tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the Magic Wand tool in the Tools panel.
	
	 It looks like, well, a wand. You can also press the A key. If the Magic 
Wand isn’t visible, press A again to cycle through the tools. Or simply 
choose the Magic Wand in the Tool Options.
	
2.	 Click the portion of the image you want to select, using the default 
Tolerance setting of 32.
	
	 The pixel you click (the target pixel) determines the base color. Remember 
that the default value of 32 means that the Magic Wand tool selects all 
colors 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker than the base color.
	
	 If you selected everything you wanted the first time you used the Magic 
Wand tool, give yourself a pat on the back. If you didn’t (which is proba­
bly the case), go to Step 3.
	
3.	 Enter a new Tolerance setting in the Tool Options.
	
	 If the Magic Wand tool selected more than you wanted it to, lower the 
Tolerance setting. If it didn’t select enough, raise the setting.
	
	 Here are a few other options to specify:
	
•	 Sample All Layers: If you have multiple layers and enable this option, 
the Magic Wand selects pixels from all visible layers. If it’s dese­
lected, the tool selects pixels from the active layer only. For more on 
layers, see Book VI.
	
•	 Contiguous: When this option is selected, the Magic Wand tool 
selects only pixels that are adjacent to each other. When this option 
is deselected, the Magic Wand tool selects all pixels within the range 
of tolerance on the active layer (unless Sample All Layers is 
selected), regardless of whether they’re adjacent to each other.
	
•	 Anti-aliasing: This option subtly softens the edge of the selection. See 
the section “Using the Marquee options,” earlier in this chapter, for 
details.
	
•	 Refine Edge: This option enables you to clean up the selection edges. 
See the earlier section “Free-Form Selecting with the Lasso Tools” for 
details on this option.

Painting with the Selection Brush
	
4.	 Click the portion of 
the image that you 
want to select.
	
	 Changing the toler­
ance level doesn’t 
adjust the current 
selection, so you 
must start again by 
clicking your image. 
The Magic Wand tool 
then deselects the 
current selection 
and makes a new 
selection — based on 
the new Tolerance 
setting, as shown in 
Figure 1-11. If it still 
isn’t right, you can 
adjust the Tolerance setting again. Unfortunately, it’s all about trial and 
error.
Painting with the Selection Brush
If the action of painting on a canvas is more up your alley, try out the 
Selection Brush. Using two different modes, you can either paint over areas 
of an image that you want to select or paint over areas you don’t want to 
select. The Selection Brush also lets you make a basic selection with another 
tool, such as the Lasso, and then fine-tune the selection by brushing addi­
tional pixels into or out of the selection.
Follow these steps to paint a selection with the Selection Brush:
	
1.	 Select the Selection Brush from the Tools panel or simply press the 
A key.
	
	 If the Selection Brush isn’t visible, press A again to cycle through the 
tools. Or simply choose the Selection Brush in the Tool Options. This 
tool works in either Expert or Quick mode.
	
2.	 Specify your Selection Brush options in the Tool Options.
	
	 Here’s the scoop on each option:
	
•	 Mode (note that this drop-down menu is not labeled as such): Choose 
between Selection and Mask. Choose Selection if you want to paint

over what you want to select. Choose Mask if you want to paint over 
what you don’t want to select. If you choose Mask mode, you must 
choose some additional overlay options. An overlay is a layer of 
color (that shows onscreen only) that hovers over your image, indi­
cating protected or unselected areas. You must also choose an over­
lay opacity between 1 and 100 percent. You can also choose to 
change the overlay color from the default red to another color. This 
option can be helpful if the image contains a lot of red.
	
•	 Brush Presets: Choose a brush from the presets drop-down panel. To 
load additional brushes, click the down-pointing arrow to the left of 
Default Brushes and choose the preset library of your choice. You 
can select the Load Brushes command from the panel menu.
	
•	 Size: Enter a brush size from 1 to 2500 pixels. You can also drag the 
slider.
	
•	 Hardness: Set the hardness of the brush tip, from 1 to 100 percent.
	
3.	 If your mode is set to Selection, paint over the areas you want to 
select.
	
	 You see a selection border. Each stroke adds to the selection. (You’ll 
notice the Add to Selection button in the Tool Options is automatically 
selected.) If you inadvertently add something you don’t want, simply 
press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and paint over the undesired area. 
You can also click the Subtract from Selection button in the Tool 
Options. After you finish painting what you want, your selection is ready 
to go.
	
4.	 If your mode is set to Mask, paint over the areas that you don’t want 
to select.
	
	 While you paint, you see the color of your overlay. Each stroke adds 
more to the overlay area, as shown in the left image in Figure 1-12. When 
working in Mask mode, you’re essentially covering up, or masking, the 
areas you want to protect from manipulation. That manipulation can be 
selecting, adjusting color, or performing any other Elements command. 
Again, if you want to remove parts of the masked area, press the Alt key 
(Option on the Mac) and paint.
	
	 When you’re done painting your mask, choose Selection from the Mode 
drop-down menu or simply choose another tool from the Tools panel to 
convert your mask into a selection border, as shown in the right image 
in Figure 1-12.

Saving Time with the Quick Selection Tool

Figure 1-12: Paint a selection with the Selection Brush.
	
	 If you painted the selection in Mask mode, the selection border is 
around what you don’t want. To switch to what you do want, choose 
Select➪Inverse.
	
	 The mode you choose is up to you. One advantage of working in Mask 
mode is that you can partially select areas. By painting with soft 
brushes, you create soft-edged selections. These soft edges result in par­
tially selected pixels. If you set the overlay opacity to a lower percent­
age, the pixels are even less opaque or “less selected.” If this “partially 
selected” business sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because this is also what 
happens when you feather selections, as we discuss in the section 
“Using the Marquee options,” earlier in this chapter.
Saving Time with the Quick Selection Tool
No one ever has enough time, so any tool that can shave a few minutes off a 
selection task is welcome. The Quick Selection tool can do just that. Think of 
it as a combo Brush/Magic Wand/Lasso tool. Easy to use — and producing 
surprisingly good results — it’s sure to become a favorite part of your collec­
tion of selection tools.
To make short work of selecting by using this tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the Quick Selection tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 The tool looks like a wand with a marquee around the end. You can also 
press the A key — or if the tool isn’t visible, press A again to cycle

through the tools. You can also select the Quick Selection tool in the 
Tool Options.
	
	 This is one of the few tools that works in either Expert or Quick mode.
	
2.	 Specify the options in the Tool Options.
	
	 Here’s an explanation of the options:
	
•	 New Selection: The default option enables you to create a new selec­
tion. You also have options to add to and subtract from your 
selection.
	
•	 Brush Settings: Choose your desired brush settings. Specify hardness, 
spacing, angle, and roundness settings.
	
•	 Size: Specify the diameter, from 1 to 2500 pixels.
	
•	 Sample All Layers: If the image has layers and you want to make a 
selection from all the layers, select this option. If this option is left 
deselected, you can select only from the active layer.
	
•	 Auto-Enhance: Select this option to have Elements assist you with 
automatically refining your selection by implementing an algorithm.
	
3.	 Click and drag over 
the desired areas of 
the image.
	
	 Your selection grows 
while you drag, as 
shown in Figure 1-13.
	
	 If you stop dragging 
and click another 
portion of the image, 
your selection 
includes that clicked 
area.
	
4.	 Modify your selec­
tion, as needed.
	
	 You have three 
options to change 
your selection:
	
•	 To add to your 
selection, press 
the Shift key 
while dragging 
across your 
desired image 
areas.

Resizing Smartly with the Recompose Tool
	
•	 To delete from your selection, press the Alt key (Option key on the 
Mac) while dragging across the unwanted image areas.
	
•	 You can also select the Add to Selection or Subtract from Selection 
options in the Tool Options.
	
5.	 If you need to further fine-tune your selection, click the Refine Edge 
option in the Tool Options.
	
	 We explain the Refine Edge settings in detail in the section “Free-Form 
Selecting with the Lasso Tools,” earlier in this chapter. If the object is 
fairly detailed, you may even need to break out the Lasso or another 
selection tool to make some final cleanups.
Resizing Smartly with the Recompose Tool
The Recompose tool is a combination crop-and-transform tool. You can move 
elements closer together or even change the orientation of a landscape shot 
from horizontal to vertical without eliminating your most important elements.
Follow these steps to recompose:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, select the Recompose tool from 
the Tools panel.
	
	 This tool is just to the right of the Crop tool and looks like a gear in front 
of a bounding box. You can also press the W key to access the tool.
	
2.	 Using the brushes and erasers in the Tool Options, mark the areas you 
want to protect and eliminate.
	
	 Although this step isn’t mandatory, it yields better results.
	
	 Here’s a description of these options, located at the far-left end of the 
Tool Options:
	
•	 Mark for Protection brush: Brush over the areas of the image you want 
to protect, or retain (strokes are green). You don’t have to be super-
precise — just provide Elements with an idea of what you want to 
keep (or remove, in the case of the next brush).
	
•	 Mark for Removal brush: Brush over those areas you want to remove 
first (strokes are red). Make sure to choose the area you don’t mind 
deleting, as shown in Figure 1-14.
	
•	 Erase Highlights Marked for Protection: Use this tool to erase any area 
you mistakenly marked to retain.
	
•	 Erase Highlights Marked for Removal: Use this tool to erase any area 
you mistakenly marked to remove.

3.	 Specify the other options in the Tool Options.
	
	 Here’s a description of those options:
	
•	 Size: Adjust the brush size by clicking the down arrow and dragging 
the slider to make the brush diameter smaller or larger.
	
•	 Highlight Skin Tone (green man/brush icon): Select this option to pre­
vent skin tones from being distorted when scaled.
	
•	 Preset: Use a preset ratio or size to which to recompose your image, 
or leave on the No Restriction default setting.
	
•	 Width and Height: Enter width and height scale percentages, if you 
want.
	
•	 Threshold: Set a recomposition threshold to help minimize distortion. 
Start with a higher percentage and then adjust as needed.
	
4.	 Grab the image handle and resize your image.
	
	 As you drag, the red areas are removed first, and the green areas remain 
intact. After all the red areas have been removed, Elements begins to 
“carve” out areas you didn’t indicate to protect.
	
5.	 After you recompose the image, click the Commit (green) check-mark 
icon to accept the composition.
	
	 Retouch any areas as needed with the Clone Stamp or Healing tools. 
For our example, shown in Figure 1-15, we retouched some of the water 
and sky.

or most people, getting the perfect, pristine selection on the first 
attempt is difficult. A little too much caffeine or not enough shut-eye, 
and that once-steady hand is no longer so. Fortunately, Elements, compas­
sionate digital-imaging friend that it is, understands this difficulty and 
doesn’t make you settle for inaccurate selections. You have many ways to 
modify and transform selections to refine them to the point of near-perfect 
accuracy. You can add or remove pixels from your selection, scale the selec­
tion outline, smooth jagged edges, or switch what’s selected for what isn’t. 
In this chapter, we show you how to clean up and modify your 
selections and enable you to nail an element with precision.
If you haven’t already checked out the first chapter of 
this minibook and gotten a good grasp on how to cre­
ate selections in the first place, you may want to start 
there.
	
When modifying selections, be sure that you’re 
working in the Photo Editor in Expert mode (not in 
Quick or Guided mode, or in the Organizer). For 
more on various modes in Elements, see Book I, 
Chapter 1.
Modifying Selections
Although the selection tools, such as the Lasso, Quick Selection, 
and Magic Wand, usually do a fair job of capturing most of a selection, mak­
ing an extremely accurate selection often requires a degree of modification 

278
Modifying Selections
and cleanup. If you give the selection a little extra TLC, you’re rewarded with 
more accuracy and precision. By adding and subtracting from the selection, 
you can refine it and ensure that you capture only what you want.
With the multitude of tools and features in Elements, you can usually exe­
cute the task in more than one way. In the following sections, we show you 
how to use keyboard operations (along with your mouse) to modify selec­
tions. But note that you can also use the four selection option buttons on the 
left side of the Tool Options to create a new selection, add to a selection, 
subtract from a selection, or intersect one selection with another. You just 
choose the selection tool, click the selection option button you want, and 
drag (or click and release, if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygonal Lasso 
tool). When you’re using the Selection Brush, the Add to Selection and 
Subtract from Selection buttons are also available.
	
When adding to a selection, a small plus sign (+) appears next to your cur­
sor. When subtracting from a selection, a small minus sign (–) appears. 
When intersecting two selections, a small multiplication sign (×) appears.
Adding to a selection
If your selection doesn’t contain all the elements you want to capture, you 
need to add those portions to your current selection.
To add to a current selection, simply hold down the Shift key and click and 
drag around the pixels you want to include when using the regular Lasso or 
the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool. If you’re using the Polygonal 
Lasso, click and release around the area. (We wouldn’t use the Magnetic 
Lasso tool to add to a selection; it’s way too cumbersome.)
You can also hold down the Shift key and click the area you want when using 
the Magic Wand tool, or drag on the area you want when using the Quick 
Selection tool.
	
After your first drag with the Quick Selection tool, your selection option but­
ton should convert to the Add to Selection button automatically. When using 
the Selection Brush in Selection mode, the selection option button is also set 
automatically to the Add to Selection button.
	
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection that you used 
to create the original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you 
think can get the job done. For example, it’s common to start off with the 
Magic Wand and clean up your selection with the Lasso tool. See Chapter 1 
of this minibook if you need more info on selection tools.

Follow these steps to add to a circular selection, such as the one shown in 
Figure 2-1:
	
1.	 Make your first elliptical selection with the Elliptical Marquee tool, as 
shown in the left example in Figure 2-1.
	
	 Be sure to hold down the Alt key (Option on the Mac) to draw from the 
center out. Also, press the Shift key if you want to constrain your selec­
tion to a circle.
	
2.	 To add to your initial selection, hold down two keys at once: First 
hold down the Shift key to add to the selection and then hold down 
the Alt (or Option) key to draw from the center out.
	
	 You must press and hold the keys in this order.
	
	 Note that if you also need to constrain your selection to a perfect circle, 
you have a dilemma because the Shift key is already being used to add 
to the selection. See the later section “Avoiding Keyboard Collisions” for 
a solution.
	
3.	 Drag around the second selection by using the Elliptical Marquee tool.
	
	 You would have to repeat Steps 2 and 3 several times to select all the 
tennis balls. Figure 2-1 shows the steps repeated so that a second tennis 
ball is selected.

Subtracting from a selection
Just as you can add to a selection marquee, you can subtract from a selection. 
Here’s how to subtract from a current selection using the following tools:
	
✓	Using the Lasso or the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool: Hold 
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and drag around the pixels 
you want to subtract.

280
Avoiding Keyboard Collisions
	
✓	Using the Magic Wand and Quick Selection tools: Hold down the Alt 
key (Option key) and click the area you want to remove.
	
✓	Using the Polygonal Lasso tool: To subtract a straight-sided area, hold 
down the Alt key (Option key) and click and release around the area.
	
✓	Using the Selection Brush tool: Hold down the Alt key (Option key) and 
drag.
In Figure 2-2, we first 
selected the frame by 
using the Polygonal 
Lasso tool. We didn’t use 
the obvious tool of 
choice — the Rectangular 
Marquee tool — because 
the frame wasn’t com­
pletely straight. To dese­
lect the inside of the 
frame from the selection, 
we again used the 
Polygonal Lasso tool, 
holding down the Alt key 
(Option key) and clicking 
at each corner of the 
inside of the frame to 
produce the selection 
that’s shown.
Intersecting two selections
What happens when you hold down Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) 
together? An intersection, that’s what happens. Holding down both keys 
while dragging with the Lasso and Marquee tools, clicking and releasing with 
the Polygonal Lasso tool, or clicking with the Magic Wand tool all create the 
intersection of the original selection with the second selection.
Avoiding Keyboard Collisions
Elements has a little conflict in its methods. With so many ways of doing 
things, sometimes you may have to fiddle with Elements to get it to do what 
you want. For example, when you press the Shift key, how does Elements

what if you want to delete part of a selection while also drawing from the 
center outward? Both actions require the use of the Alt key (Option key on 
the Mac). You have a way out of this keyboard madness, and the following 
sections help you find it.
Adding a perfectly square or circular selection
To add a perfectly square or round selection to an existing selection, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Hold down the Shift key and drag when using the Rectangular or 
Elliptical Marquee tool.
	
	 Your selection is unconstrained.
	
2.	 While you drag, keeping your mouse button pressed, release the Shift 
key for just a moment and then press and hold it again.
	
	 Your unconstrained selection suddenly snaps into a constrained square 
or circle.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button before you release the Shift key.
	
	 If you don’t release the mouse button before you release the Shift key, 
the selection shape reverts to its unconstrained form.
You can bypass the keyboard shortcuts in the preceding steps list by using 
the various selection buttons on the left side of the Tool Options to add, sub­
tract, or intersect to and from your selections.
Deleting from an existing selection 
while drawing from the center out
To delete part of a selection while drawing from the center out, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Position your mouse cursor in the center of a selection; hold down the 
Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and drag when using the Rectangular 
or Elliptical Marquee tool.
	
2.	 While you drag, keeping your mouse button pressed, release the Alt 
key (Option key) for just a moment and then press and hold it again.
	
	 You’re now drawing from the center outward.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button before you release the Alt key (Option key).

Using the Select Menu
	
Use this technique when you’re 
selecting a doughnut, a tire, an 
inflatable swim ring, or other circu­
lar items that have holes in the mid­
dle, as shown in Figure 2-3.
Using the Select Menu
Although you can add, subtract, and 
intersect selections by using the 
Shift and Alt keys (Option key on the 
Mac) and the selection option but­
tons in the Tool Options, you can do 
even more with the commands on 
the Select menu, shown in Figure 
2-4. On this menu, you find ways to 
expand, contract, smooth, and 
soften your selection and even turn 
your selection inside out. You can 
also use this menu to automatically 
select similar colors. If you use the 
Select menu, your selections should 
be ready and rarin’ for action.
Selecting all or nothing
The All and Deselect commands are self-explanatory. To select everything in 
an image or, if it has layers, everything in the chosen layer, choose 
Select➪All or press Ctrl+A (⌘+A on the Mac). To deselect everything, 
choose Select➪Deselect, Ctrl+D (⌘+D on the Mac).
	
You rarely have to use All. If you don’t have a selection border in the image, 
Elements assumes that you want to apply whatever command you execute 
to the entire image (or layer).
Reselecting a selection
If you’ve taken some valuable time to carefully lasso a spiky iguana from its 
perch on a mangrove tree, the last thing you want is to lose your hard-
earned selection border. But that’s what happens if you inadvertently click 
the image when you have an active selection border — it disappears.

selection and draw from the center outward 
simultaneously.

Modifying and 
Transforming 
Selections
Using the Select Menu
Yes, technically, you can choose 
Edit➪Undo if you catch your error 
right away. And you can access the 
History panel to recover your selec­
tion. But a much easier solution is to 
choose Select➪Reselect, which 
retrieves your last selection.
	
The Reselect command works for 
only the last selection you made, so 
don’t plan to reselect a selection you 
made last Wednesday — or even two 
minutes ago — if you’ve selected 
something else after that selection. If 
you want to reuse a selection for the 
long term, save it, as we explain in 
the section “Saving and loading selec­
tions,” later in this chapter.
Inversing a selection
	
Sometimes, selecting what you don’t 
want is easier than selecting what 
you do want. For example, if you’re 
trying to select your cat Princess, 
photographed against a neutral 
background, why spend valuable 
time meticulously selecting her with 
the Lasso tool when you can just 
click the background with the Magic 
Wand tool?
After you select the background, as 
shown in Figure 2-5, just choose 
Select➪Inverse. Voilà. Princess is 
selected and obediently awaiting 
your next command.
Feathering a selection
In Chapter 1 of this minibook, we 
describe how to feather (soften or 
blur the edges of) a selection when 
using the Lasso and Marquee tools 
by entering a value in the Feather 
option in the Tool Options. This 
method of feathering requires that 
you set the Feather radius before 
you create your selection.
Figure 2-4: The commands on the Select menu.

Figure 2-5: Sometimes, you want to select what 
you don’t want and then inverse your selection.

284
Using the Select Menu
A problem may arise with feathering before you make your selection, if later 
you want to modify your initial selection. When you make a selection with a 
feather, the selection border adjusts to take into account the amount of the 
feather. So, the resulting marquee outline doesn’t resemble your precise 
mouse movement. As a result, modifying, adding, or subtracting from your 
original selection is difficult.
	
A much better way to feather a selection is to make your initial selection with­
out a feather, as shown in the left image of Figure 2-6. Clean up your selection 
as necessary and then apply your feather by choosing Select➪Feather. In the 
dialog box, enter a radius value from 0.2 to 250 pixels and click OK. The result­
ing selection appears in the image on the right in Figure 2-6.
©istockphoto.com/Hanis Image #2054524
Figure 2-6: You can more easily clean up your selection before applying a feather.
	
The radius is how far out in all directions the feather extends. A radius of 8 
means that the feather extends 4 pixels inward and 4 pixels outward from the 
selection outline. A large feather radius makes the image appear to fade out.
The Refine Edge command, which appears right after Feather on the Select 
menu, enables you to fine-tune selection edges by using various options. For 
full details on this option, see the section on free-form selecting with the 
Lasso tools in Chapter 1 of this minibook.

Modifying and 
Transforming 
Selections
Using the Select Menu
Using the Modify commands
The Select➪Modify menu contains a group of modification commands that 
are lumped together categorically. (Refer to Figure 2-4.) You probably don’t 
use these options every day, but sometimes they can come in handy. Here’s 
the lowdown on each command:
	
✓	Border: Selects the area around the edge of the selection. You specify 
the width of the area from 1 to 200 pixels, and you create a border out­
line, as shown on the left in Figure 2-7. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection and fill 
the border with color, as shown in the image on the right in Figure 2-7.
©istockphoto.com/imv Image #2053920
Figure 2-7: The Border command creates a selection outline, which you can then fill with 
color.
	
✓	Smooth: Rounds off the nooks, crannies, and jagged edges. Enter a 
radius value from 1 to 100 pixels, and Elements looks at each selected 
pixel and then includes or deselects the pixels based on the radius 
value. If most pixels are selected, Elements includes the strays; if most 
pixels are deselected, Elements removes these pixels. Start with 2 pixels 
or so — and if that doesn’t seem like enough, increase it by a few pixels.
	
	Use this command with great caution. It’s just too easy to produce 
mushy, inaccurate selections.
	
✓	Expand: Increases the size of your selection by a specified number of 
pixels, from 1 to 100. This command comes in handy if you just miss the 
edge of an elliptical selection and want to enlarge it a tad.

286
Using the Select Menu
	
✓	Contract: Shrinks your selection by 1 to 100 pixels. When you’re com­
positing multiple images, you can benefit by slightly contracting your 
selection if you plan to apply a feather. You can then avoid picking up a 
fringe of background pixels around your selection.
	
	After you make a selection, contract it and then feather it before you drag 
it onto the canvas. This technique helps to create a natural-looking transi­
tion between the images in your composite. The amount you decide to 
contract and feather varies according to the resolution of the images. For 
example, if you’re using low-resolution (72 pixels per inch, or ppi) images, 
you may want to use 1 pixel for the Contract amount and 0.5 pixels for the 
Feather amount; higher-resolution images may warrant 2 to 3 pixels for 
the Contract amount and 1 to 2 pixels for the Feather amount. If the word 
resolution makes you scratch your head, see Book III, Chapter 2.
Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are often mentioned in the same breath with 
the Magic Wand tool. If you didn’t get the perfect selection on the first click — 
quite a common occurrence, unfortunately — you can use the Grow command. 
For example, to include more in your selection, you increase the Tolerance 
setting and try again: Hold down the Shift key and click the area to include. Or 
you can choose Select➪Grow. The Grow command increases the size of the 
selection by including adjacent pixels that fall within the range of tolerance.
The Similar command is like Grow, only the pixels don’t have to be adjacent 
to be selected. The command searches throughout the image and picks up 
pixels within the tolerance range.
	
Both commands use the Tolerance value that’s displayed in the Tool Options 
when you have the Magic Wand tool selected. Adjust the Tolerance setting 
to include more or fewer colors by increasing or decreasing the setting, 
respectively.
Saving and loading selections
If you’ve invested valuable time perfecting a complex selection, we highly 
recommend that you save it for future use. It’s extremely easy to do and will 
prevent you from having to start from square one again. Here’s what you do:
	
1.	 After you make your selection, choose Select➪Save Selection.
	
2.	 In the Save Selection dialog box, leave the Selection option set to New 
and enter a name for your selection, as shown in Figure 2-8.
	
	 The option defaults to New Selection.

Moving and Cloning Selections

3.	 Click OK.
	
4.	 When you want to access the selection again, choose Select➪Load 
Selection and choose a selection from the Selection drop-down menu.
	
	 To inverse your selection, click the Invert box. Note that you also have 
options to add to, subtract from, or intersect with your selection. These 
options can come in handy if you want to modify your existing selection. 
For example, you may select just the head of a person and not the full 
body. You later decide that you need the whole person. Rather than 
make a whole new selection, you can select just the body and then 
choose Add to Selection, and you have your whole person. If you want, 
you can then save the whole person as a new selection for later use.
Moving and Cloning Selections
When you have your selection modified to perfection, you may then want to 
move it or clone it. To move a selection, simply grab the Move tool (the four-
headed arrow) in the Tools panel and then drag the selection.
Sounds easy enough, right? When you move the selection, however, be 
warned that the area where the selection used to reside is now filled with 

288
Moving and Cloning Selections
the background color, as shown in Figure 2-9. It 
turns out, though, that the background color 
appears only if you decide to move both the 
selection outline and the image pixels. But you 
don’t have to move both; you can move just the 
selection outline (without the pixels), as we 
explain in the section “Moving the selection out­
line, but not the pixels,” later in this chapter. 
Also, if you’re moving a selection on a layer, 
you’re left with transparent pixels (see Book V).
	
The Move tool has a few options residing in the 
Tool Options that are mostly relevant when 
working with layers. For a description of these 
options, see Book VI, Chapter 2.
Cloning
If you don’t want to leave a hole in your image, 
you can copy and move the selection, leaving the 
original image intact, as shown in Figure 2-10. 
Just hold down the Alt key (Option key on the 
Mac) and drag when using the Move tool. This 
action is often referred to as cloning because 
you’re essentially making a duplicate of a 
selected area and then moving that duplicate 
elsewhere.
	
Note that moving and cloning are considered the 
“old school” way to eliminate an element from 
your image. If you want to do it the new-fangled 
way, be sure to check out the Content Aware 
option for the Spot Healing Brush and the brand 
new Content-Aware Move tool, both described in 
Book VIII, Chapter 1. But just in case you don’t 
get the results you want with the new tool, you 
now know to use the tried-and-true tools as well.
Moving the selection outline, 
but not the pixels
If all you want to do is move the selection outline 
without moving the pixels underneath (for exam­
ple, to better center an elliptical selection around 
whatever you want), avoid using the Move tool. 
Instead, choose any selection tool — a Marquee

selection by using the Move 
tool, you leave a hole that

or Lasso tool — and then click anywhere inside the selection and just drag. 
That way, you move only the outline of the selection, not the pixels of the 
selection itself. You can also use the arrow keys to nudge a selection 
marquee.
Transforming Pixels
After you select an element, you may find that you need to resize or reorient 
it. Transforming involves scaling, rotating, skewing, distorting, flipping, or 
adjusting the perspective of your pixels. Although you may consider these 
types of transformations somewhat pedestrian, we’re sure you’ll find them 
practical and useful in your daily digital-imaging chores.
Follow these steps to transform a selection:
	
1.	 Create your selection.
	
	 We leave this task up to you; just use your selection expertise (or refer 
to Chapter 1 of this minibook for assistance).
	
	 You can also apply transformations to a layer or to multiple layers. (For 
more on this topic, see Book VI.)
	
2.	 If you need to rotate the selection, choose Image➪Rotate and then 
choose your desired rotation from the submenu:
	
•	 Free Rotate Selection: Enables you to manually rotate the selection.
	
•	 Rotate Selection 180°, 90° Left, or 90° Right: Rotates the selection by 
the specified amounts.
	
•	 Flip Selection Horizontal or Vertical: Flips your selection along the 
vertical or horizontal axis, respectively.
	
	 The other rotate commands have to do with layers.
	
3.	 To scale the selection, choose Image➪Resize➪Scale.
	
4.	 To freely transform, skew, distort, or adjust the perspective of a sec­
tion, choose Image➪Transform and then choose a transformation type 
from the submenu:
	
•	 Free Transform: Enables you to rotate, resize, skew, distort, and 
adjust perspective all within a single command. See the later sidebar 
“Distorting selected pixels with Free Transform” for more on this 
productive command.
	
•	 Skew: Distorts your selection on a given axis.

290
Transforming Pixels
	
•	 Distort: Distorts your selection with no restrictions on an axis.
	
•	 Perspective: Applies a one-point perspective to your selection.
	
	 As soon as you select a distortion and release the mouse button, a 
bounding box or transform box surrounds your selection, complete with 
handles on the sides and corners. You don’t get a bounding box when 
you select the Flip or Rotate (by degrees) transformations. (These com­
mands are just applied to your image.)
	
5.	 Depending on which transformation type you choose in Steps 2, 3, or 
4, drag the appropriate handle:
	
•	 Free Rotate: Move the cursor outside the bounding box. When the 
cursor becomes a curved arrow, drag clockwise or counterclock­
wise. Hold down the Shift key to rotate in 15-degree increments.
	
	 Remember that choosing Rotate 180°, 90° CW, or 90° CCW or Flip 
Horizontal or Vertical executes the command. Handle-dragging isn’t 
necessary.
	
•	 Scale: Corner handles work best for this transformation. Hold down 
the Shift key to scale proportionately. Hold down the Alt key (Option 
key on the Mac) to scale from the center.
	
•	 Skew: Drag a side handle.
	
•	 Distort: Drag a corner handle.
	
•	 Perspective: Drag a corner handle.
	
	 Elements executes all the transformations around a reference point. The 
reference point appears in the center of the transform box by default. 
You can move the reference point anywhere you want, even outside the 
bounding box. In addition, you can set your own reference point for 
the transformation by clicking a square on the reference point locator 
in the Tool Options. Each square corresponds to a point on the bound­
ing box.
	
	 You can also use the fields in the Tool Options to perform most of your 
transformations. After choosing any of the transformation commands 
from the menu, fields for a numeric entry to scale, rotate, and skew 
appear in the Tool Options.
	
	 Execute all your transformations in one fell swoop, as shown in Figure 
2-11, if possible. In other words, don’t scale a selection now and then 
five minutes later rotate it, and then five minutes after that distort it. 
With the exception of flipping or rotating in 90-degree increments, every 
transformation you apply to an image results in a resampling. You 
should limit the number of times you resample an image, because it has 

291
Book IV 
Chapter 2
Modifying and 
Transforming 
Selections
Transforming Pixels
a degrading effect — your image starts to appear soft and mushy. For 
more on resampling, see Book III, Chapter 1.
	
6.	 After you transform the selection to your liking, double-click inside the 
bounding box or click the Commit button next to the bounding box.
	
	 To cancel the transformation, press Esc or click the Cancel button next 
to the bounding box.
	
	 Your selection is now magically transformed. If your image isn’t on a 
layer, you can end up with a hole filled with the background color after 
your image is transformed. Check out Book VI on layers to avoid this 
calamity.
Figure 2-11: Apply all transformations at the same time to minimize interpolation.
	
When the Move tool is active, you can transform a layer without choosing a 
command. Select the Show Bounding Box option in the Tool Options. This 
option surrounds the layer or selection with a box that has handles. Drag 
the handles to transform the layer or selection.

292
Transforming Pixels
Distorting selected pixels with Free Transform
An efficient way to apply multiple transforma­
tions is to use the Free Transform command. 
Like the Transform command, the Free Trans­
form command surrounds the selection with a 
bounding box. Within the bounding box, you can 
scale, rotate, skew, distort, or apply perspective 
without having to choose individual distortions. 
You just have to use the right keyboard short­
cuts. To scale and rotate, use the same method 
as the Image➪Scale and Image➪Rotate➪Free 
Rotate commands. Here’s the scoop on the rest:
	✓	Skew: Ctrl+Shift-drag (⌘+Shift-drag on 
the Mac) on a side or corner handle.
	✓	Distort: Ctrl-drag (⌘-drag on the Mac) on 
any handle.
	✓	Perspective: Ctrl+Shift+Alt-drag (⌘+
Shift+Option-drag on the Mac) on a 
corner handle.
If you forget these tedious keyboard shortcuts, 
simply right-click with the mouse (Control-
click on the Mac) to access a context-
sensitive menu with the transform commands 
from which you can then select.

eel free to keep on your street clothes for this chapter on drawing and 
painting. The tools you work with in Elements are self-cleaning and 
don’t require that you wear a smock. Painting is a basic skill that you need 
to have down pat in Elements. After you get familiar with the technique of 
painting strokes and working with brushes, you’re well on your way to 
mastering more advanced skills, such as retouching, which come easier to 
you if you already have some strong painting skills under your belt.
In tandem with painting, of course, comes drawing. The Elements 
shape tools add an important dimension to your drawing 
capabilities. This chapter introduces you to a plethora of 
tools and techniques. We start with painting and then 
move on to drawing. Master both, and they can serve 
you well.
Introducing the Pencil 
and Brush Tools
The Pencil and Brush tools are like chocolate and 
mint: They not only work well together but also share 
many important attributes. Just as important, however, 
are their differences. You can access these tools in the 
Tools panel. Press the B key to make the Brush tool appear 
by default. By pressing the B key again, you can toggle among the 
Brush tool, the Impressionist Brush, and the Color Replacement tools. You 
can also select the companion brush tools in the Tool Options. To access 
the Pencil, press the N key.

296
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools 
Drawing with the Pencil tool
The Pencil and Brush tools are similar, except that the Pencil tool has hard 
edges whereas the Brush tool can have soft, feathered edges. In fact, the 
edges of a pencil stroke can’t even be anti-aliased. Keep in mind that if you 
draw anything other than vertical or horizontal lines, the lines have some 
jaggies when they’re viewed up close. But hey, don’t dismiss the Pencil. 
Those hard strokes can work great for web graphics because they lend 
themselves to producing crisp-edged images for display in a browser 
window. What’s more, the Pencil tool can erase itself, and it’s helpful for 
digital sketches, as shown in Figure 1-1.
You can do all the 
following with the 
Pencil tool:
	
✓	Drag the mouse to 
draw freehand lines.
	
✓	Click at one point, 
release the mouse 
button, and then 
Shift-click at a 
second point to 
draw a straight line 
between the points. 
As long as you hold 
down the Shift key, 
you can keep clicking 
to draw straight lines 
between the last 
clicked point and the 
current click.
	
✓	Press the Alt key 
(the Option key on 
the Mac) and click 
any area of color in 
the drawing to switch the foreground color to that hue.
To try out the Pencil tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the Pencil tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 You can press the N key to access the tool.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, choose your pencil settings.

	 Options are
	
•	 Brush Preset Picker: By default, the Pencil tool’s brush tip is the 
1-pixel brush. Click the arrow and select a brush from the Brush 
Preset Picker drop-down panel that appears. To load another preset 
library, click the Brush drop-down menu at the top of the panel. You 
also find options to save, rename, or delete individual brushes and 
also save, load, and reset brush libraries from the panel menu.
	
•	 Size: A preset brush’s pixel diameters are shown as text below a 
thumbnail image of the brush shape. If you want to change the size of 
that brush tip, drag the Size slider or enter a value.
	
3.	 If you want to draw using anything other than Normal mode, select a 
mode from the Mode drop-down menu in the Tool Options.
	
	 Blend modes alter the interaction of the color you’re applying with the 
color on your canvas. See more on Blend modes in Book VI, Chapter 3.
	
4.	 In the Tool Options, specify an Opacity percentage for your pencil 
strokes.
	
	 If you want your background to show partially through your strokes, 
select an opacity of less than 100 percent by using the slider or by 
typing an opacity percentage directly into the text box. The lower the 
percentage, the more the background images show through.
	
	 Your strokes must be on a separate layer above your images for you to 
be able to adjust the opacity and Blend modes after you draw them. For 
more on layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
	
5.	 Select Auto Erase to enable that option.
	
	 This option erases portions of your pencil strokes. For example, the 
foreground color might be black and the background color white, and 
you might apply some black strokes. With Auto Erase enabled, you 
apply white if you drag back over the black strokes. If you drag over the 
white background, you apply black.
	
6.	 Click and drag with the mouse to create your pencil lines.
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool is a popular tool used throughout Elements in various 
incarnations, so getting to know this tool and how it operates is a good idea.
The most important difference between the Brush and the Pencil tools is 
that, by default, the Brush tool produces soft-edged lines, as shown in 
Figure 1-2. How soft those strokes are depends on which brush you use. By 
default, even the hardest brush has a slightly soft edge because it’s anti-aliased. 
Anti-aliasing creates a single row of partially filled pixels along the edges to 
produce the illusion of a smooth edge. You can also get even softer brushes, 
which employ feathering.

298
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools 
Although jagged edges 
are most apparent 
in diagonal lines, 
Elements applies anti-
aliasing to brush-
stroke edges, even in 
horizontal and vertical 
lines.
The Brush tool shares 
most of the basic 
options found in the 
Pencil tool, except that 
the Auto Erase feature 
isn’t available.
Here are a few tips on working with the Brush tool and its unique options:
	
✓	Select the Brush tool from the Tools panel or press the B key until you 
get the Brush.
	
✓	In the Tool Options, click the arrow and select a brush tip from the 
Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel that appears.
	
✓	Select a mode and opacity from the options in the Tool Options.
	
✓	Drag to paint, click and Shift-click 
to paint straight lines, and hold 
down the Shift key while dragging 
to constrain the Brush tool to 
horizontal or vertical lines.
	
✓	Press the Alt key (the Option 
key on the Mac) and click any 
area of color to switch the fore­
ground color to that color.
The Brush tool has several other 
options:
	
✓	Airbrush Mode: Click the 
Airbrush button in the Tool 
Options to apply the Airbrush 
mode. This mode produces the 
spray effect you see with a 
traditional airbrush. The longer 
you hold down the mouse 
button, the more paint pumps 
out of the tool and the wider the 
airbrush effect spreads, as 
shown in Figure 1-3.

✓	Tablet Settings: 
If you’re using a 
pressure-sensitive 
digital drawing 
tablet, check the 
settings you want 
the tablet to 
control, including 
size, scatter, 
opacity, roundness, 
and hue jitter 
(switching 
between 
foreground and 
background 
colors). The 
harder you press 
with the stylus, 
the greater the 
effect of these 
options.
	
✓	Brush Settings: In 
the Tool Options, 
click Brush 
Settings to access additional options that enable you to change the 
brush strokes as you apply them. Here’s a quick lowdown on each 
option (and the way they impact the brush effect, as shown in 
Figure 1-4):
	
•	 Fade: The lower the value, the quicker the stroke fades. Zero, 
however, creates no fade.
	
•	 Hue Jitter: This option varies the stroke between the foreground and 
background colors. The higher the value, the more frequent the 
variation.
	
•	 Scatter: The higher the value, the higher the number of brush marks 
and the farther apart they are.
	
•	 Spacing: The higher the number, the more space between marks.
	
•	 Hardness: The higher the value, the harder the brush.
	
•	 Roundness: A setting of 100 percent is totally circular. The lower the 
percentage, the more elliptical your brush becomes.
	
•	 Angle: If you create an oval brush by adjusting the roundness, this 
option controls the angle of that oval brush stroke. You can more 
easily drag the points and the arrow on the diagram than “guesstimate” 
values in the text boxes.

•	 Set this as a default: You can lock in these brush options by selecting 
this check box, ensuring that every brush you select adopts these 
settings.
Just as they do for the Pencil tool, more features for the Brush tool appear 
on the Brush Preset Picker panel menu. (Click the arrow at the top of the 
panel.) Here’s a quick explanation of what you can do with each one:
	
✓	Save Brush: Save a custom brush as a preset. See the following section 
for details.
	
✓	Rename Brush: Don’t like the name of your brush? Give it a new one 
with this option.
	
✓	Delete Brush: Eliminate an unwanted brush with this option.
	
✓	Reset Brushes: Revert your current brush library to the default.
	
✓	Load Brushes: Load a preset or custom brush library. They have names 
such as Special Effect Brushes and Faux Finish Brushes. Select one to 
append the brushes to your current set or to replace the current set 
with the library you select. (The dialog box that appears offers a choice 
of either action.)
	
✓	Save Brushes: Save custom brushes in a separate library.
	
✓	The display options: A set of commands that enables you to change the 
way your brush tips are displayed in the drop-down panel. The default 
view is Stroke Thumbnail, which displays the appearance of the stroke. 
Other commands include Text Only (text names of brush tips), Small 
and Large Thumbnail (thumbnail images with diameter in pixels), and 
Small and Large List (thumbnail images with text names).
	
You can also manage brush tip libraries by using the Preset Manager option 
available from the panel menu or by choosing Edit➪Preset Manager.
Getting artsy with the Impressionist Brush
The Impressionist Brush is designed to paint over photos in a way that 
makes them look like fine-art paintings. The best way to get familiar with the 
Impressionist Brush is to open your favorite image and experiment with the 
tool. You can set various options that change the style of the brush strokes.
Here’s how to use this artistic brush:
	
1.	 Select the Impressionist Brush from the Tools panel.
	
	 It looks like a brush with a curlicue next to it. You can also press the B 
key to cycle through the various brushes.
	
2.	 Set the brush options.

	 The Brushes Presets, Size, Mode, and Opacity options are identical to 
those for the Brush tool, described in the previous section. You can also 
find some unique options on the Advanced panel:
	
•	 Style: This drop-down list contains various brush stroke styles, such 
as Dab and Tight Curl.
	
•	 Area: Control the size of your brush stroke. The larger the value, the 
larger the area covered.
	
•	 Tolerance: Control how similar color pixels have to be before they’re 
changed by the brush stroke.
	
3.	 Drag on your image 
and paint with your 
brush strokes, as 
shown in Figure 1-5.
Creating a 
custom brush
After playing with the 
various options, if you 
like the personalized 
brush you’ve created, 
save it as a preset so that 
you can access it again 
and again. Click the 
arrow at the top of the 
Brush Preset Picker 
panel and choose Save 
Brush from the menu. 
Name the brush and click OK. Your new, custom brush shows up at the bot­
tom of the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel.
You have one other way to create a brush. Elements enables you to create a 
brush from all or part of your image. The image can be a photograph or 
something you’ve painted or drawn.
Here’s how to create a brush from your image:
	
1.	 Select part of an image with any of the selection tools.
	
	 If you want to use the entire image or entire layer, deselect everything. 
(For more on selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1.)
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Define Brush or Edit➪Define Brush from Selection.
	
	 You see one command or the other, depending on what you do in Step 1.

3.	 Name the brush and click OK in the dialog box.
	
	 The new brush shows up at the bottom of the Brush Preset Picker drop-
down panel. Note that your brush is only a grayscale version of your 
image. When you use the brush, it automatically applies the color you’ve 
selected as the foreground color, as shown in Figure 1-6.

Putting It Together
Colorizing Black-and-White Images
Just as you may have artistic reasons for shooting a photo in black and white, you may 
also have valid arguments for converting a grayscale image into a color one. Perhaps the 
picture is an old one, taken before color film was widely used, and you want to colorize 
it. Or you may come across a monochrome image that would look more interesting in 
color. Elements enables you to return the missing colors to your original black-and-white 
pictures or to create your own customized color image.

303
Book V 
Chapter 1
Painting and 
Drawing with 
Elements
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools 
In our example, we chose a black-and-white photo of an adorable pair of siblings. Rather 
than try to duplicate a color photograph, we want to apply a technique that mimics the 
subtle, hand-colored look of the Marshall’s Photo Coloring System of pigments, photo 
oils, spot colors, retouch pencils, and other products popular in the 1950s and ’60s. You 
may have also seen this look used in greeting cards featuring children.
Follow these steps to apply this technique:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, 
open a grayscale image in 
Elements, as shown in the figure.
	
2.	 Choose Image➪Mode➪RGB Color 
to convert the grayscale image to a 
full-color image (even though it 
lacks color).
	
3.	 Choose Layer➪New➪Layer.
	
	 This step creates a new, transparent 
layer to paint on. Although you can 
paint directly on an image, using a 
blank layer is safer and gives you 
more flexibility in editing when you make a mistake. (For more information on 
working with layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.)
	
4.	 In the New Layer dialog box that appears, name the layer and click OK.
	
	 You can paint all colors on a single layer, but you may find that using a separate 
layer for each part of the face lets you fade that color in and out as required to blend 
smoothly with your other hues.
	
5.	 Select the Color mode from the Blend Mode drop-down menu in the Layers panel.
	
	 Elements uses this mode to combine the painting layer with the image layer, 
enabling you to apply color while retaining the details of the underlying image.
	
6.	 Select a color you want to apply from the Swatches panel or use the Color panel to 
mix your own.
	
	 For details on using color, see Book III, Chapter 4.
	
7.	 Select the Brush tool from the Tools panel.
	
8.	 Click the down arrow on the Brush Preset Picker in the Tool Options and select a 
brush from the drop-down panel.
	
	 Start with a soft-edged brush.

	 The Airbrush option in the Tool Options creates a subtle and soft effect. Just be sure 
to pick the kind of brush that works best for the area of the picture you’re colorizing. 
(Use a small, fuzzy brush for smaller areas, and use a bigger, sharper brush for more 
defined lines and wider areas.)
	
9.	 Paint all parts of the image where you want to apply color.
	
	 If you make a mistake, you can use the Eraser tool (or the History panel, as discussed 
in Book III, Chapter 1) to erase the bad strokes without affecting the underlying 
grayscale image because you’re painting on a separate layer.
	
	 In our example, we chose a nice, 
light blue to change the color of the 
childrens’ eyes, as shown in the 
figure. A small, fuzzy brush is per­
fect for small areas, such as the 
eyes.
	
	 Change brushes as necessary by 
clicking the Brush Preset Picker in 
the Tool Options and selecting a 
larger or smaller brush.
	
10.	 When you finish with that area of the image, create a new layer for each of the 
image’s main components and repeat Steps 4 through 9 with an additional color.
	
	 We painted the eyes, lips, cheeks, hair, and hair highlights separately because cre­
ating natural, subtle effects with people’s skin, hair, and eyes takes a special touch:
	
✓	 Eyes: When painting the eyes, paint only the irises and leave the pupils their 
original black color. Don’t paint over the catchlights in the eyes, either. 
(Catchlights are reflections of light sources, such as windows or the flash.)
	
✓	 Lips: Color the inner surface of the lips a darker, rosier pink than the outer sur­
face. Lips look best when portrayed in at least two shades. Don’t forget to color 
the gums with an even lighter pink.
	
✓	 Hair: Hair looks best when the highlights and darker portions are slightly differ­
ent colors.
	
✓	 Cheeks: To put a little blush in 
the cheeks, choose the 
Airbrush option on the Tool 
Options and work with a rela­
tively large brush size. Apply a 
good dash of color to each 
cheek and a lighter bit of color 
to the forehead and chin, as 
shown in the figure.

	 We left the clothes and background uncolored to emphasize that the focal point 
is the faces.
	
11.	 For the overall skin tone, choose a different technique, using the Hue/Saturation 
command.
	
	 This technique works especially well with those who have naturally dark complexions. 
You can choose to paint the skin with a brush or use this technique:
	
✓	 Duplicate the grayscale Background layer and then choose Enhance➪Adjust 
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation.
	
✓	 Choose the Colorize option and move the Hue slider to the left to produce a 
sepia tone. We set our Hue to 36 and Saturation to 25 percent and then clicked 
OK to colorize this layer.
	
✓	 Use the Eraser tool to remove 
everything in the colorized 
layer that isn’t skin. In our 
example, we removed the hair, 
background, eyes, lips, teeth, 
and clothing. This result is a 
nice sepia tone to the face, as 
shown in the figure.
	
	 Be sure to pick a color that’s as 
close to life as possible. If the 
subject has darker skin, you 
may need to move away from 
rosier blush tones.
	
12.	 When you finish coloring your layers, experiment with different opacity levels for 
each colorized layer to see whether more transparent hues might look better.

Creating Shapes
Although we’re big fans of photos and pixels, sometimes you have the need 
for a vector shape or two. Maybe you need to create a button for a web page 
or a simple logo for a poster. In these instances, drawing a vector shape with 
one of the shape tools does the job.
Before we discuss the ins and outs of creating shapes, here’s a little overview 
that explains the difference between pixels and vectors (both types are 
shown in Figure 1-7):

306
Creating Shapes
	
✓	Pixel images describe a shape in terms of a grid of pixels. When you 
increase the size of a pixel-based image, it loses quality and begins to 
look blocky, mushy, and otherwise nasty. For more details on resizing 
pixel-based images and the ramifications of doing so, see Book III, 
Chapter 2.
	
✓	Vectors describe a shape mathematically. The shapes comprise paths 
made up of lines, curves, and anchor points. Because vector shapes are 
math based, you can resize them with no loss of quality.
Figure 1-7: Elements images fall into one of two camps: vector or pixel.
When you create a shape in Elements, you’re creating a vector-based 
element. Shapes reside on a special kind of layer called, not surprisingly, a 
shape layer.
Drawing a shape
Elements offers an assortment of shape tools for you to choose from. Follow 
these steps to draw a shape in your document:
	
1.	 Select a shape tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also press the U key to cycle through the tools. You can select 
from the following shape tools, shown in Figure 1-8:

307
Book V 
Chapter 1
Painting and 
Drawing with 
Elements
Creating Shapes
Figure 1-8: The shape tools and Tool Options give you all you need to make shapes, from the 
simple to the ornate.
	
•	 Rectangle/Ellipse: The Rectangle and Ellipse shapes have no special 
parameters in the Tool Options; however, they both behave much 
like their counterparts among the selection tools. Hold down the 
Shift key while dragging a shape to produce a perfect square or 
circle; hold down Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) to additionally 
draw the shape outward from the center.
	
•	 Rounded Rectangle: This shape has the same options as the 
Rectangle, with the addition of a radius value used to round off the 
corners of the rectangle.
	
•	 Polygon: This tool creates a polygon with a specified number of 
sides, from 3 to 100. You can also create a star with the same 
possible number of convex vertices.

308
Creating Shapes
	
•	 Line: Creates a line with a width from 1 to 1000 pixels. You can also 
add an arrowhead at either end or both ends.
	
•	 Custom Shape: You can find numerous preset custom shapes to 
choose from, as shown in Figure 1-8. As with any shape, hold down 
the Shift key to constrain proportions or the Alt key (Option key on 
the Mac) to draw from the center out.
	
•	 Shape Selection: Use this tool to select and move your shapes.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, click the down arrow above the (W) and (H) fields 
to specify Geometry options.
	
	 Each shape has its own options. For a detailed explanation, see the 
section “Specifying Geometry options,” later in this chapter.
	
	 If you chose the Custom Shape tool in Step 1, click the down arrow to 
access the drop-down Custom Shapes panel, shown in Figure 1-8, and 
choose a shape. You can access more preset shape libraries via the 
drop-down menu at the top of the panel.
	
3.	 Select a color from the Color drop-down panel in the Tool Options.
	
	 Click the color wheel icon at the bottom of the panel to access the Color 
Picker for additional color choices.
	
4.	 Select a style from the Style 
Picker drop-down panel.
	
	 To spice up the shape with bevels 
and interesting edges, choose a 
style from the panel. For more on 
styles, see Book VII, Chapter 3.
	
5.	 Drag in the document to draw the 
shape you’ve defined.
	
	 The shape appears in the Image 
window on its own shape layer. 
Check out the Layers panel to see 
this phenomenon. Figure 1-9 shows 
our shape, an Elvis ’do.
Drawing multiple shapes on a shape layer
After you create a shape layer, you can draw additional shapes on that layer. 
You can add, subtract, exclude overlapping, and intersect shapes in exactly 
the same way you do with selections, as described in Book IV, Chapter 2. 
Follow these steps:
Figure 1-9: Custom shapes run the gamut 
from the ordinary to the exotic.

309
Book V 
Chapter 1
Painting and 
Drawing with 
Elements
Creating Shapes
	
1.	 After you create the first shape, as we explain in the preceding 
section, select a state button in the Tool Options:
	
•	 Add to Shape Area: Combines and joins two or more shapes.
	
•	 Subtract from Shape Area: Subtracts one shape from another shape.
	
•	 Intersect Shape Areas: Creates a shape only from the areas that 
overlap.
	
•	 Exclude Overlapping Shape 
Areas: Creates a shape from 
only the areas that don’t 
overlap.
	
2.	 Choose a shape tool and draw the 
next shape.
	
	 We finished our drawing, as shown 
in Figure 1-10, by adding a face to 
our Elvis impersonator.
	
	 You can also hold down the Shift 
key to temporarily switch to Add 
to Shape Area while drawing a new 
shape. Hold down the Alt key 
(Option key on the Mac) to tempo­
rarily switch to Subtract from 
Shape Area. It works just like adding 
or subtracting selections.
Specifying Geometry options
Geometry options for your shapes help define how the shapes look. Click the 
down arrow at the end of the row of Shape tools in the Tool Options to 
access the Geometry options described in the following sections.
Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle Geometry options
Here’s what the Geometry options for the Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle 
shapes let you do:
	
✓	Unconstrained: Freely draw a rectangle of any shape or size.
	
✓	Square: Constrain the shape to a perfect square. (You can also hold 
down the Shift key to do the same thing on the fly.)
	
✓	Fixed Size: Draw rectangles only in fixed sizes. Specify the exact size by 
entering a width and height.
Figure 1-10: Add to your shape layer.

310
Creating Shapes
	
✓	Proportional: Define an aspect ratio, or proportion, for the rectangle. 
Type 3 into the W box and 4 into the H box to constrain yourself to 
drawing any rectangle size with fixed proportions in a 3:4 ratio.
	
✓	From Center: Draw the shape from the center outward.
	
✓	Snap: Align the edges of a rectangle or rounded rectangle to the pixels 
on your screen.
	
✓	Radius: For rounded rectangles, use an inscribed circle of the given 
radius to round off the corners of a rectangle.
Elliptical-shape Geometry options
The Ellipse shape has many of the same options available for rectangles. Of 
course, rather than being able to create a perfect square, you can constrain 
the shape to be a perfect circle. Also, the Snap to Pixels option (available for 
rectangles) doesn’t exist for ellipses.
Polygon Geometry options
These are the Geometry options for the polygon:
	
✓	Sides: Lets you indicate the number of sides for the polygon.
	
✓	Smooth: Corners: Rounds off the corners.
Star Geometry options
These are the Geometry options for a star:
	
✓	Indent: Determines the amount the sides indent inward.
	
✓	Smooth: Indents: Rounds off the indents.
	
✓	Smooth: Corners: Rounds off the corners.
	
✓	Sides: Lets you indicate the number of points for a star.
Line Geometry options
The Line shape’s Geometry settings include whether to put arrowheads at 
the start or end of the line, neither, or both. You can also specify the width, 
length, and concavity settings, which affect the arrowhead shapes.
Custom Shape Geometry options
The Custom Shape options are similar to those you can find for the other 
shapes — with a couple of additions:
	
✓	Defined Proportions: Draws a shape based on the original proportions 
you used when you created it.
	
✓	Defined Size: Draws a shape based on its original size when you 
created it.

Editing shapes
You can edit shapes you create by using a variety of tools and techniques. 
Here’s a list of the things you can do to modify your shapes:
	
✓	Select: Choose the Shape Selection tool in the Tool Options to move one 
or more shapes in their layers.
	
✓	Move: Choose the Move tool (press the V key) to move the entire 
contents of the shape layer.
	
✓	Delete: Select a shape and press Delete to remove it.
	
✓	Transform shapes: Choose the Shape Selection tool and select your 
shape. Choose Image➪Transform Shape and then choose your 
transformation.
	
✓	Change the color: Double-click the thumbnail of the shape layer on the 
Layers panel. This action takes you to the Color Picker, where you can 
choose a new color.
	
✓	Clone a shape: Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and 
move the shape with the Move tool.
	
To convert your vector-based shape into a pixel-based shape, click the 
Simplify button in the Tool Options or choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. Note 
that you can’t edit a shape after you simplify it, except to modify the pixels. 
But you can now apply filters to the layer. See Book VII, Chapter 1, for more 
on fun with filters.

Chapter 2: Filling and Stroking
In This Chapter
✓	Adding color to a selection
✓	Filling with the Paint Bucket tool
✓	Adding a stroke around a selection
✓	Working with gradients
✓	Creating and applying patterns
E

lements offers several ways to create things like geometric shapes out 
of pixels. Filling and stroking such elements are two of the most 
popular commands at your disposal. The Fill command adds a color or a 
pattern to the entire selection, whereas the Stroke command applies the 
color to only the selection border.
This chapter shows you how to fill and stroke your selections. If filling and 
stroking with a solid color is just too mundane for you, we also show you 
how to create and apply multicolored gradient blends as well as the best 
ways to make and use patterns. After reading this chapter, you’ll 
have your “fill” of different fills and strokes.
	
Open the Photo Editor in Expert mode for your filling, 
stroking, gradient, and pattern activities.
Filling a Selection with a Solid Color
You won’t find a Fill tool in the Tools panel. 
Elements avoids the crowded panel and places the 
Fill and Stroke commands on the Edit menu. When 
you want to fill your selection with just a solid color, 
you can use either the foreground or the background 
color, among other options. (These colors appear at the 
bottom of the Tools panel, as we explain in Book III, 
Chapter 4.)
The following steps show you the basics of filling a selection with either the 
foreground or background color:

314
Filling a Selection with a Solid Color
	
1.	 Choose the selection tool of your choice and create your selection on 
a layer.
	
	 Although you don’t have to create a new layer, we recommend it. That 
way, if you don’t like the filled selection, you can delete the layer, and 
the image or background below it remains safe. See Book IV for all you 
need to know about selections and Book VI for the scoop on layers.
	
2.	 In the Tools panel, select either the foreground or the background 
color and then choose a fill color.
	
	 If you need information on choosing a color, see Book III, Chapter 5.
	
3.	 Choose Edit➪Fill Selection.
	
	 Note that if you don’t have an active selection border in your image, the 
command says Fill Layer and the entire layer is filled with your color or 
pattern.
	
	 The Fill Layer dialog box, shown 
in Figure 2-1, appears.
	
4.	 Choose a fill from the Use drop-
down menu.
	
	 You can select whether to fill 
with the foreground or back­
ground color.
	
	
You also can choose Color, 
Black, 50% Gray, White, or 
Pattern. If you select Color or 
Pattern, you must complete a 
couple additional steps, 
described in the next section.
	
5.	 In the Blending area, specify 
whether to preserve 
transparency.
	
	 This option enables you to fill only the portions of the selection that 
contain pixels (the nontransparent areas).
	
	 Although you can also choose a blend mode (how the fill color interacts 
with colors below it) as well as an opacity percentage in the Fill Layer 
dialog box, we don’t recommend doing so. Making adjustments on your 
layer later using the Layers panel commands gives you more flexibility 
for editing.
	
6.	 Click OK.
	
	 The color or pattern you chose fills the selection.

pattern.

Filling Options and Tips
Filling Options and Tips
After you make a selection, you’re ready to use one of the filling options. You 
can use the Fill Layer dialog box (as described in the preceding section) to 
fill the selection with the foreground or background color; you can also 
choose to fill the selection with color, black, white, or gray. Elements is full 
of shortcuts and options.
Here are just a few. With the selection active, you can do any of the 
following:
	
✓	Press Alt+Backspace (Option+Delete on the Mac) to fill the selection 
with the foreground color. All areas within the selection, including 
transparent areas, fill with the color.
	
✓	Press Alt+Shift+Backspace (or Option+Shift+Delete on the Mac) to fill 
only the pixels in a selection with the foreground color, leaving any 
transparent pixels untouched.
	
✓	If you’re working on the Background layer, you can also fill the selection 
with the background color by pressing the Backspace (Delete on the 
Mac) key. (Pressing Backspace [Delete] on other layers creates a 
transparent area that shows the image in the layer underneath the 
selection.)
	
✓	By selecting the Color option from the Use drop-down menu in the Fill 
Layer dialog box, you access the Color Picker, where you can select any 
color your heart desires to fill your selection. For more on using the 
Color Picker, see Book III, Chapter 5.
	
✓	Select the Pattern option from the Use drop-down menu in the Fill Layer 
dialog box to fill the selection with a pattern. Click the arrow next to the 
pattern swatch and select a pattern from the drop-down panel. Click OK. 
To access additional pattern libraries, click the Pattern panel menu to 
select more pattern libraries.
	
✓	Paint part or the entire interior of the selection by using a Pencil or 
Brush tool. This option lets you partially fill a selection using a bit of 
flexibility and creativity. When you paint a selection using Brush tools, 
Elements confines the paint inside the boundaries of your selection, as 
shown in Figure 2-2. For more on painting, see Chapter 1 in this 
minibook.

Pouring with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool operates much like a combination of the Fill command 
tool and the Magic Wand tool. It makes a selection based on similarly 
colored pixels and then immediately fills that selection with color or a 
pattern. Just like the Magic Wand tool, this tool is used most successfully 
when you have a limited number of colors, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Figure 2-3: Select and fill your background simultaneously with the Paint Bucket tool.
To use the Paint Bucket tool, select it and click the area you want to fill with 
color. If you want a more precise fill, first make a selection and then click 
inside the selection border. It’s as simple as that. Before you click, however, 
specify your options, which are all in the Tool Options:
	
✓	Paint: Select whether to fill with the Foreground color or a Pattern.
	
✓	Pattern: If you select Pattern, select a preset pattern from the drop-
down panel. You can also load patterns from pattern libraries or create 
a pattern of your own. Find more information on patterns in the section 
“Working with Patterns,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Opacity: Adjust this value to make the fill more or less transparent.
	
✓	Tolerance: Just as you did with the Magic Wand tool, choose a tolerance 
level (from 0 to 255) that specifies how similar in color a pixel must be 
before it’s selected and then filled. For more on tolerance, see Book IV, 
Chapter 1.
	
✓	Mode: Select a blending mode to change how the fill color interacts with 
the color below it. Find details on these modes in Book VI, Chapter 3.
	
✓	All Layers: This option selects and fills pixels within the selection in all 
layers that are within the tolerance range.

318
Stroking a Selection
	
✓	Contiguous: If selected, this option selects and fills only pixels that are 
touching within your selection. If the option is deselected, pixels are 
selected and filled wherever they lie within your selection and within 
your tolerance range.
	
✓	Anti-aliasing: Choose this option to smooth the edges between the filled 
and unfilled areas.
	
As with other tools that fill, you can prevent the Paint Bucket tool from 
filling the transparent pixels. Just select the Lock Transparent Pixels icon in 
the Lock area of the Layers panel.
Stroking a Selection
Stroking enables you to create colored outlines, or borders, of selections or 
layers. It’s up to you to decide whether to put the border inside, outside, or 
centered on the selection.
To stroke a selection, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Tools panel, choose a foreground color.
	
2.	 In the image, make a selection on a layer using the selection tool of 
your choice.
	
	 Although you don’t have to create a new layer to stroke a selection, we 
recommend it. That way, if you don’t like the stroked selection, you can 
just delete the layer and your document remains unadulterated.
	
3.	 Choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection.
	
4.	 In the Stroke dialog box, specify options, as shown in Figure 2-4:
	
•	 Width: Enter a width of 1 to 250 pixels.
	
•	 Color: Click in the Color box to select the hue that you want from the 
Color Picker.
	
•	 Location: Specify how Elements should apply the stroke in relation to 
your selection border. Note that the Inside option always gives you 
sharp corners on a rectangle. The Center and Outside options can 
result in blunt corners.
	
•	 Mode: Determine how the stroke color interacts with other colors on 
the same layer.
	
•	 Opacity: The default value is 100%. If you want the stroke to be semi­
transparent, enter a lower value.
	
•	 Preserve Transparency: Select this option to apply the stroke to only 
nontransparent pixels. Note that if you choose this option on a new, 
blank layer, nothing is stroked.

5.	 Click OK to apply the stroke.
	
	 We gave a 10-pixel centered stroke to our selection (see Figure 2-4).
Figure 2-4: Apply strokes up to 250 pixels wide to your selection.
	
Rather than use the Stroke dialog box to adjust the Mode and Opacity settings, 
we recommend creating a new layer for the stroke and then choosing 
different Mode and Opacity settings in the Layers panel. This approach gives 
you better flexibility in editing.
Working with Multicolored Gradients
If one color just doesn’t get you fired up, you’ll be happy to know that 
Elements enables you to fill a selection or layer with a gradient, a blend of 
one or more colors that gradually dissolves from one into another or into 
transparency. Elements provides numerous preset gradients. But creating 
your own custom gradient is also fun and simple.
You can create the following gradient effects:
	
✓	Foreground to background: A transition from the current foreground 
color to the background color
	
✓	Foreground to transparent: A transition from the current foreground 
color to transparent, allowing whatever’s under the transparent portion 
to show through
	
✓	Black to white: A transition from black to white

320
Working with Multicolored Gradients
	
✓	An array of colorful selections: A transition including rainbows, 
coppery sheens, and other effects
	
You can load other libraries of gradients from those found on the menu of 
the Gradient panel. They have names such as Color Harmonies, Metals, and 
Special Effects.
In addition to being able to control the appearance and application of a 
gradient, you can also specify various Gradient options, which are all in the 
Tool Options:
	
✓	Mode: Select a blending mode to change how the color of the gradient 
interacts with the colors below it.
	
✓	Opacity: Select how opaque or transparent the gradient is.
	
✓	Reverse: Reverse the order in which the colors are applied.
	
✓	Transparency: Deselect this option to make Elements ignore any 
transparent areas in the gradient, making them opaque instead.
	
✓	Dither: Add noise, or random information, to produce a smoother 
gradient that prints with less banding (color stripes caused by the 
limitations of the printing process to reproduce a full range of colors).
Applying a preset gradient to a selection
Here’s how to apply a preset gradient:
	
1.	 Select the layer from the Layers panel.
	
	 If you want the gradient to fill only a portion of that layer, make your 
selection.
	
	 We recommend making the selection on a new layer so that you can edit 
the gradient later without harming the underlying image.
	
	 If you don’t make a selection, the gradient is applied to the entire layer 
or background.
	
2.	 Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel or press the G key.
	
3.	 Select one of the preset gradients from the Gradient Picker drop-down 
menu in the Tool Options.
	
	 Remember that you can find other preset libraries by clicking the 
Gradient menu at the top of the Gradient Picker panel. Libraries, such as 
Color Harmonies and Metals, contain interesting presets.

321

4.	 Select the gradient type by clicking an icon in the Tool Options.
	
	 Figure 2-5 illustrates each gradient type:
	
•	 Linear: Blends the colors of the gradi­
ent in a straight line.
	
•	 Radial: Blends the colors outward in a 
circular pattern.
	
•	 Angle: Creates a counterclockwise 
sweep around the starting point, 
resembling a radar screen.
	
•	 Reflected: Blends the colors by using 
symmetrical linear gradients on either 
side of the starting point.
	
•	 Diamond: Blends the colors outward in 
a diamond pattern.
	
5.	 Choose any other options you want from 
the Tool Options.
	
	 We explain these options earlier in this 
section.
	
6.	 Place the cursor at the position in the 
layer or selection where you want to 
place the starting color of the gradient.
	
7.	 Drag in any direction to the end point for 
the gradient.
	
	 Longer drags result in a more subtle 
transition between colors, whereas shorter 
drags result in a more abrupt transition. 
Hold down the Shift key while dragging to 
constrain the direction of the gradient so 
that it’s perfectly horizontal or vertical or 
at an exact 45-degree angle.
	
8.	 Release the mouse button to apply the 
gradient.
	
	 We applied a pastel radial gradient to 
a selection of an abstract symbol in 
Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-5: You can choose 
from five gradient types.
Figure 2-6: Fill your selection 
with a multicolored gradient.

322
Working with Multicolored Gradients
Customizing and editing gradients
Although Elements includes dozens of gradient presets, you may want to 
create your own. The Gradient Editor makes that task an easy one by letting 
you create a custom gradient with as many colors as you want, which you 
can then save as a preset and reuse at any time.
The Gradient Editor has many options, but it’s easy to use when you know 
what the controls and options do. Follow these steps to create a simple, 
smooth gradient:
	
1.	 Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel or press the G key.
	
2.	 Click the Edit button in the Tool Options.
	
	 The Gradient Editor dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7: The Gradient Editor enables you to create custom gradients.
	
3.	 Pick an existing gradient preset from the Presets area to use as the 
basis for your new gradient.
	
4.	 Choose Solid or Noise from the Type drop-down menu.
	
	 As soon as you start to edit the existing gradient, the name of the 
gradient changes to Custom. A noise gradient is one containing random 
colors. Because the colors are random, each time you create a noise 
gradient, the result is different.

323
Book V 
Chapter 2
Filling and Stroking
Working with Multicolored Gradients
	
5.	 If you chose a Solid gradient in Step 4, adjust the Smoothness 
percentage to determine how smoothly one color blends into another.
	
6.	 If you chose a Noise gradient in Step 4, specify the options that follow 
and then skip to Step 15 to finish the gradient.
	
•	 Roughness: Adjust this slider to determine how smoothly or abruptly 
the colors transition from one stop to another.
	
•	 Color Model: Select the color model to set the range of color and get 
the corresponding color sliders to adjust, if desired. 
	
•	 Restrict Colors: Select this option to avoid oversaturated colors.
	
•	 Add Transparency: Select this option to include transparency in your 
gradient, if desired.
	
•	 Randomize: Use this option to change the colors in the gradient. 
Each time you click Randomize, you see a new set of colors.
	
7.	 If you’re creating a solid gradient, define the color of the starting point 
for your gradient; click the left color stop under the gradient bar.
	
	 The triangle above the stop turns black to indicate that you’re working 
with the starting point of the gradient. Because Noise gradients are 
random, you can’t define the colors.
	
8.	 Select the starting color by using one of these methods:
	
•	 Click the down-pointing arrow to access the Color menu. You can 
also access other color libraries from the Color Swatches menu at 
the top of the panel.
	
•	 Double-click the left color stop and select a color from the Color 
Picker that appears.
	
•	 Click the Color swatch in the Stops area of the dialog box and choose 
a color from the Select Stop Color dialog box that opens.
	
•	 Position the cursor (it appears as an eyedropper icon) anywhere on 
the gradient bar to select a start color from the bar, or position the 
cursor anywhere within an image on your screen and then click to 
select the color under the cursor.
	
9.	 Click the end-point color stop at the right side of the gradient bar and 
use any of the methods described in Step 8 to choose the end color of 
the gradient.
	
10.	 Change the percentage of the amount of one color versus the other by 
moving the starting and ending points to the left or right; drag the 
midpoint slider (a diamond icon that appears when you click an 
adjacent color stop) to adjust where the colors mix equally, 50–50.

324
Working with Multicolored Gradients
	
	 You can also change the position of the midpoint by selecting it and 
typing a value into the Location box. The position of the color stops can 
also be changed this way.
	
11.	 (Optional) To add another color, click below the gradient bar at the 
position you want to add the color and define a color using the new 
color stop as you did in Step 8.
	
12.	 (Optional) Repeat Step 11 for additional colors.
	
13.	 For additional color stops, move the stops to the left or right to adjust 
the location of the start and end points for each color; adjust the 
midpoint sliders between the colors.
	
14.	 If you change your mind, redefine the color of the color stop or 
remove a color stop altogether by dragging it down or up from its 
position on the gradient bar.
	
15.	 After your edits are complete, enter a name for your gradient in the 
Name field and then click the New button.
	
	 Your gradient is added to the Presets menu. Figure 2-8 shows an 
example of a unique gradient that we created in the Gradient Editor.
Figure 2-8: The Gradient Editor gives you more creative license than the presets.
Adding transparency to a gradient
By default, a gradient has 100 percent opacity in the start color and progresses 
to 100 percent opacity in the end color. If you like, you can have the gradient 
fade out to transparency so that the portion of the image under the gradient 
shows through. To add transparency to a gradient, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Create a gradient, as described in the preceding section.

325
Book V 
Chapter 2
Filling and Stroking
Working with Multicolored Gradients
	
2.	 Select the left opacity stop.
	
	 This stop is located just above the gradient bar, as shown in Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9: Add transparency to your gradients by adjusting the 
opacity of your colors.
	
3.	 Use the Opacity slider to specify the amount of transparency for the 
gradient at its start point.
	
	 You can also type a value into the Opacity box.
	
4.	 Select the right opacity stop and then slide the Opacity slider, or enter 
a percentage in the text box to specify transparency for the gradient 
at its end point.
	
	 The lower the percentage, the less opaque the color.
	
5.	 Move the opacity stops to the right or left to adjust the location where 
Elements applies each stop’s opacity setting.
	
6.	 Move the midpoint slider (diamond icon) to adjust how the color and 
the transparency blend.
	
7.	 Click above the gradient bar to add more opacity stops if you want to 
vary the transparency of the gradient at different points.
	
	 For example, you can fade transparency from 100 percent to 50 percent 
and back to 100 percent to produce a particular effect.
	
Gradients ordinarily proceed smoothly from one color to another. If you 
want a less homogeneous appearance, adjust the Smoothness slider to a 
value of less than 100 percent. (Click the right-pointing arrow to access the 
slider.)

326
Managing and Saving Gradients
Managing and Saving Gradients
After taking the time to create custom gradients, store them so that you can 
use or edit them again later. Before you save them, however, be sure to 
add them to the gradient presets. (See the section “Customizing and editing 
gradients,” earlier in this chapter.) Here are some tips for managing 
gradients:
	
✓	To save your set of gradients, click the Save button (disk icon) in the 
Gradient Editor dialog box. You save the current presets, including your 
new gradient, under the current library’s name or another one you choose.
	
✓	To load gradient presets into the Gradient Editor, click the Load 
button (green plus sign icon) and select the name of the gradient library 
you want to add to the Presets list.
	
✓	To add to the current presets, click the Add to Preset/Create a New 
Gradient Preset button.
Working with Patterns
You may have spotted someone on the golf course with plaid shorts and a 
striped polo shirt. If so, you’ve been introduced to the power of patterns. 
Not always a pretty sight when used with abandon, patterns can be used to 
fill selections or layers. You can also stamp your image with the Pattern 
Stamp tool and retouch using a pattern with the Healing Brush tool. 
Elements offers several preset patterns to keep you happy. But you can 
create your own, of course.
You select patterns from panels that appear in the Tool Options for many of 
the tools just mentioned, just as you do with brush tips and gradients. You 
also manage them in much the same way using the Preset Manager. The 
following sections show you how to apply a preset pattern and create your own.
Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter 
sticks with applying patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset 
pattern, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose the layer from the Layers panel and/or make the selection you 
want to fill with a pattern.
	
	 We recommend making your selection on a new layer above the image 
for more flexible editing later.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Fill Selection or Fill Layer and then select Pattern from 
the Use drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 2-10.

327
Book V 
Chapter 2
Filling and Stroking
Working with Patterns
Figure 2-10: Fill the selection with one of the many other preset patterns.
	
3.	 Click the arrow next to the Custom Pattern swatch, and then from the 
Custom Pattern drop-down panel, select your pattern.
	
4.	 Choose any other fill options you want to apply, such as Mode, 
Opacity, or Preserve Transparency.
	
	 The Preserve Transparency option prevents Elements from filling the 
transparent areas on your layer with a pattern.
	
	 If you choose this option on a new, blank layer, nothing is filled. (For 
details on the other options, see the section “Filling a Selection with a 
Solid Color,” earlier in this chapter.)
	
	 We recommend adjusting the Mode and Opacity settings in the Layers 
panel rather than in the Fill Layer dialog box. This approach allows you 
maximum flexibility if you want to make edits later.
	
5.	 Click OK to fill the layer or selection with the chosen pattern.
	
	 Here are a few other tips for working with preset patterns:
	
•	 Replace the current patterns with new patterns by selecting Replace 
Patterns from the panel menu. (Click the right-pointing arrow on the 
right side of the panel.) Then select the new pattern library from the 
dialog box that appears.
	
•	 Append new patterns to the current set by selecting Load Patterns 
from the panel menu.

328
Working with Patterns
Creating a new pattern
You can create your own pattern, basing it on an existing image or one you 
create yourself. Select a small portion of an image to build an abstract 
pattern or use a recognizable object to define that object as a pattern stamp. 
You can use anything, from a logo to your signature, as a pattern.
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the image that contains the area you want to use as a pattern or 
create an image from scratch.
	
2.	 Make any modifications to the image to produce the exact pattern you 
want.
	
3.	 Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select the area you want to 
convert into a pattern.
	
	 If you don’t make a selection, Elements uses your entire image as a basis 
for the pattern.
	
	 If you’re using a selection to define your pattern, you must use a 
rectangular selection. And you can’t use a feathered selection of any 
kind.
	
4.	 Choose Edit➪Define Pattern from Selection or Edit➪Define Pattern.
	
5.	 Enter a name for your pattern in the Pattern Name dialog box.
	
	 Your new pattern appears in the Pattern panel for use.
	
In addition to filling your selection with a pattern, you can stamp on a 
pattern using the Pattern Stamp tool. For details, see Book I, Chapter 2.

Y

es, images are powerful. But so are words. In fact, humans tend to 
remember images better when they’re combined with words. This is 
why we don’t recall our dreams well — no words are paired with the 
images. Enough psychobabble. You may never need to pick up a Type tool. 
But, just in case you need to add a caption, headline, or short paragraph, we 
want you to be comfortable using the Type tools.
Elements allows you to create, edit, stylize, and even distort type. Keep in 
mind that this capability is no substitute for a hard-core page layout or 
word processing program. But for small chunks of text here and 
there, it’s surprisingly effective. This chapter is all about 
adding great-looking snippets of text to great-looking 
images — an unbeatable combo.
Understanding Type Modes
The text you create in Elements can be categorized 
in several different ways, but ultimately, you’re 
either adding just a little text (such as a word or 
single line) or a lot (a paragraph or so). Accordingly, 
Elements can create type in three modes:
	
✓	Point type: Use this mode to create a headline or 
label. You can create point type by clicking in your 
image and typing; the line appears while you type and 
grows to whatever length you need. In fact, it even continues past 
the boundary of your image! Point type never wraps around to a new 
line. To wrap to the next line, you must press Enter (Return on the Mac).

330
Understanding Different Kinds of Type
	
✓	Paragraph type: Use this mode to enter longer blocks of text on an 
image. It’s similar to the kind of type you’re accustomed to working with 
in word processing programs. In paragraph type mode, all the text goes 
into a resizable bounding box; if a line is too long, Photoshop automatically 
wraps it around to the next line.
	
✓	Path type: Elements also allows you to apply text along a path via three 
special Type tools. Double-click the path and enter type. The text 
appears and adheres to the shape of the path.
The various type modes each operate a bit differently, although they share 
many features and options. We explain each of them separately in the 
sections “Entering Point Type,” “Entering Paragraph Type,” and “Creating 
Path Type,” later in this chapter.
Understanding Different Kinds of Type
In addition to the three Type modes Elements offers (see point type, 
paragraph type, and path type modes in the preceding section), Elements 
can also display and print type in two different formats. Each format has its 
pros and cons, and which format you use depends on your needs. Here’s a 
description of each one:
	
✓	Vector type: All text in Elements is initially created as vector type. 
Vector type provides scalable outlines that you can resize without 
producing jagged edges in the diagonal strokes. You can edit type in this 
mode, adding or subtracting characters or adjusting attributes, such as 
kerning and tracking. Vector type is always of optimum quality and 
appears crisp and clean. (See Book III, Chapter 1, for more details on 
vector and rasterized images.)
	
✓	Raster type: When Elements converts vector type into pixels, that text is 
rasterized. Elements refers to this rasterization process as simplifying. 
When text is simplified, it’s no longer editable, but is converted into a 
raster image. In essence, it’s a frozen graphic of the text. You usually 
simplify vector type when you want to apply filters to produce a special 
effect or when you want to merge the type with the image. You can’t 
resize simplified type without losing some quality or risking jagged 
edges. For more details, see the section “Rasterizing the Type Layer,” 
later in this chapter.
Exploring the Type Tools
Elements has seven Type tools (found in the Tools panel), but two of them 
are simply vertically oriented versions of the main two text implements, as 
shown in Figure 3-1. Don’t worry about the Vertical Type tools. Although you 

331
Book V
Chapter 3
Working with Type
Exploring the Type Tools
can use them, they’re 
designed for the Asian 
market, to enter Chinese 
and Japanese characters. 
The Horizontal and 
Vertical Type tools are 
identical in their attri­
butes, so we cover only 
the two Horizontal Type tools here, and for the sake of simplicity, we call 
them the Type tool and the Type Mask tool. The last three Type tools all 
create text on a path in various ways.
You can use the paragraph or point type mode with the Type and Type Mask 
tools:
	
✓	Type tool: Use this tool to enter point or paragraph type. This tool 
creates the type on its own type layer, except when used in Bitmap or 
Indexed Color modes, neither of which supports layers. For more on 
layers, see Book VI.
	
✓	Type Mask tool: This tool doesn’t create actual type; instead, it creates 
a selection border in the shape of the type you want to enter. The selection 
border is added to the active layer. You can do anything with a type 
selection that you can do with any other selection. For details on 
selections, see Book IV.
To create a path type, you must use the Text on Selection, Shape, or Custom 
Path tools:
	
✓	Text on Selection tool: This tool enables you to draw on your image to 
create a selection. (For more on selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1.) The 
selection then converts into a path, upon which you can then enter text, 
which flows along the path.
	
✓	Text on Shape tool: The second tool allows you to create any desired 
shape from your shapes drop-down list. You can then apply your text on 
that shape.
	
✓	Text on Custom Path tool: The last tool lets you draw any custom path 
you want on your image. Enter text on that custom path, and it adheres 
to that path.
	
A path is composed of three elements — anchor points, straight segments, 
and curved segments. The path essentially hovers on the image in its own 
“space,” thereby not altering or marking the image in any way. The path in 
this context is merely a track upon which the text can flow. You can alter the 
path as you desire by using the Refine Path option. Find out more about this 
option in the section “Using the Text on Custom Path tool,” later in this 
chapter.
Figure 3-1: Elements offers seven Type tools.

332
Entering Point Type
Entering Point Type
Most of the type you 
add to Elements will 
probably consist of 
point type. Point type 
is useful for headlines, 
captions, labels, and 
similar small amounts 
of text. You can also use it to create logos and headings for web pages. Point 
type is so named because a single anchor point, which marks the starting 
point of the line of type, precedes it. Remember that point-type lines don’t 
wrap automatically, as shown in Figure 3-2.
To enter point type, just follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open an image or create a new, 
blank document (or choose File➪New➪Blank File).
	
	 You can also enter type in Quick mode, but we recommend doing it in 
Expert mode where you have Elements’ full arsenal of tools at your 
disposal.
	
2.	 Select either the Type tool from the Tools panel or press the T key to 
select it.
	
	 If the Type tool isn’t visible, press T to cycle through the Type tools. 
You can also select the particular Type tool you want from the Tool 
Options. Your cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to the one you see in a 
word processing program.
	
3.	 Click the area of the image where you want to insert the text.
	
	 For horizontal type, a small, horizontal line about one-third of the way 
up the I-beam shows the location of the baseline (on which the line of 
text rests).
	
4.	 Specify type options from the Tool Options.
	
	 All the options are described in the later section “Using the Tool 
Options.”
	
5.	 Type some text and press Enter (or Return on the Mac) to begin a new 
line.
	
	 When you press Enter (or Return), you insert a hard return that doesn’t 
move. You have to remove hard returns if you want to change the length 
of the lines you type.
	
6.	 When you finish entering the text, click the Commit (the green check- 
mark icon) button near your text.
Figure 3-2: Point type doesn’t automatically wrap, but can 
actually run off your image.

Entering Paragraph Type
	
	 You can also commit the type by pressing the Enter key on the numeric 
keypad or by clicking any other tool in the Tools panel. A new type layer 
containing your text — indicated by the T icon — is created and appears 
in your Layers panel.
Entering Paragraph Type
If you have larger chunks of text, entering the text as paragraph type is the 
most practical option. Paragraph type is similar to the text you enter in a 
word processing program, except that it’s contained inside a text box or a 
bounding box. While you type into a text box, the lines of text wrap around to 
fit the dimensions of the box. If you resize the box, Elements adjusts the 
wrapped ends to account for the new size.
You can type multiple paragraphs, use typographical controls, and rotate or 
scale the type. You can easily resize paragraph type (and point type, too) 
by entering a new point size value in the Tool Options without having to 
reselect all the text. Just make sure that the text layer is selected in the 
Layers panel and that the Text tool is active. This approach works for all 
other text characteristics as well.
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open a saved image or create a new, blank Elements document in the 
Photo Editor in Expert mode.
	
2.	 Select either the Horizontal Type tool from the Tools panel or press 
the T key to select it.
	
	 If it isn’t visible, press T to cycle through the Type tools. You can also 
select the particular Type tool you want from the Tool Options.
	
	 The cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to the one you see in a word 
processing program.
	
3.	 On the image, insert and size the text box by using one of the following 
methods:
	
•	 Drag to create a text box close to the size you want. After you release 
the mouse button, you can drag any of the handles at the corners 
and sides of the box to resize the box.
	
•	 Hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click the image. The 
Paragraph Text Size dialog box appears. Enter the exact dimensions 
of a bounding box. When you click OK, the specified box appears, 
complete with handles for resizing the box later.
	
4.	 Select Type options from the Tool Options.
	
	 Options are described in detail in the later section “Using the Tool Options.”

Creating Path Type
	
5.	 Enter the text.
	
	 To start a new paragraph, press Enter (Return on the Mac).
	
	 Each line wraps 
around to fit inside 
the bounding box, 
as shown in 
Figure 3-3.
	
	 If you type more 
text than fits in 
the text box, an 
overflow icon 
(plus sign) 
appears in the 
lower-right han­
dle. You can resize 
the text box by 
dragging any of 
the bounding box 
handles.
	
6.	 Click the Commit button (green check-mark icon) near the text (or 
press the Enter key on the numeric keypad).
	
	 Elements creates a new type layer, as indicated by the T icon displayed 
in the Layers panel.
Creating Path Type
If you have a need to have your type flow in a circle, wave, stair step, or any 
other shape, you’re now in luck. Elements provides three Type tools that 
enable you to do just that. The great thing is that you can easily create 
totally editable type that resides on its very own layer.
Using the Text on Selection tool
You can create path type by first creating a selection of your image, similarly 
to how you create a selection with the Quick Selection tool. Here’s how:
	
1.	 Open a saved image or create a new, blank Elements document in the 
Photo Editor in Expert mode.
	
2.	 Select the Text on Selection tool from the Tools panel or press the T 
key to cycle through the various Type tools.
	
	 You can also select the particular Type tool you want from the Tool 
Options.

3.	 On the image, “paint” (drag) over your desired selection.
	
4.	 Refine your selection by adding or subtracting from your selection in 
one of two ways.
	
	 By dragging: Press the Shift key and drag around the additional area that 
you want to include in your selection.
	
•	 Press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and drag around the additional 
area that you want to subtract from your selection.
	
•	 Select the Add to Selection or Subtract from Selection buttons in the 
Tool Options and drag around your desired areas.
	
	 With the Offset slider: Drag the Offset slider right to expand, or left to 
contract, your selection.
	
	 The additional options you can use to refine your selection, common to 
all the Type tools, are described in detail in the following section.
	
5.	 When your selection is complete, click the Commit check-mark icon to 
convert your selection to a path.
	
	 If you want to start over, click the red Cancel (slashed circle) icon.
	
6.	 Position your mouse over the path; when the cursor icon changes to 
an I-beam (capital letter I with a crooked line crossing over), click the 
path and type your text.
	
	 The text wraps along the path. If you type more text than can fit on the 
path, an overflow icon appears. You can move the text around the path 
or to the outside or inside of the path by holding Ctrl (⌘ on the Mac) 
while clicking and dragging the mouse around the path or to the outside 
or inside of the path.
	
7.	 When you finish entering your text, click the Commit icon.
	
	 Elements creates a new type layer. You can edit any attributes, such as 
font size, just as you can with point or paragraph text. See the upcoming 
section “Editing Text” for details.
Using the Text on Shape tool
This tool enables you to create type that flows along the perimeter of any 
shape. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open a saved image or create a new, blank Elements document in the 
Photo Editor in Expert mode.
	
2.	 Select the Text on Shape tool from the Tools panel or press the T key 
to cycle through the various Type tools.
	
	 You can also select the particular Type tool you want from the Tool 
Options.

Creating Path Type
	
3.	 Select your desired shape in the Tool Options.
	
4.	 Drag your tool over the image to create the shape.
	
•	 To constrain your proportions, hold the Shift key down while 
dragging.
	
•	 To draw from the center outward, hold down the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key while dragging.
	
5.	 Transform your shape by choosing Image➪Transform Shape and then 
your desired transformation from the submenu.
	
	 For details on transformations, see the upcoming “Editing Text” section.
	
	 The additional options you can use to refine your shape, common to all 
the Type tools, are described in detail in the following section.
	
6.	 Position your mouse over the path; when the cursor icon changes to 
an I-beam (capital letter I with a crooked line crossing over), click the 
path and type your text.
	
	 The text wraps along 
the shape’s path, as 
shown in Figure 3-4. 
Note that for some 
shapes, the text 
wraps inside the 
shape. You can move 
the text around or to 
the inside or outside 
of the custom path 
by holding Ctrl (⌘ 
on the Mac) while 
clicking and dragging 
the mouse around 
the shape or to 
outside or inside of 
the path.
	
	 If you type more text 
than can fit on the 
path, an overflow 
icon appears.
	
7.	 When you finish entering your text, click the Commit icon.
	
	 Elements creates a new type layer. You can edit any attributes, such as 
font size, just as you can with point or paragraph text. See the upcoming

You can also refine your shape path by using the Refine Path tool that 
appears in the Tool Options when the Text on Custom Path tool is selected. 
Just be sure that you have your type layer selected before working with this 
option.
Using the Text on Custom Path tool
If you want to create your own path or shape as the basis for your type, the 
Text on Custom Path tool is the tool for you. Here’s what you do:
	
1.	 Open a saved image or create a new, blank Elements document in the 
Photo Editor in Expert mode.
	
2.	 Select the Text on Custom tool from the Tools panel or press the T key 
to cycle through the various Type tools.
	
	 You can also select the particular Type tool you want from the Tool 
Options.
	
3.	 Drag your tool over the image to create the custom path of your 
choice.
	
4.	 Refine your path by selecting the Refine Path option in the Tool 
Options; drag the anchor points or path segments with the tool to get 
your desired shape.
	
	 You can also transform your custom path by choosing Image➪
Transform Shape. For details on transformations, see the upcoming 
“Editing Text” section.
	
	 The additional options to specify your path, common to all the Type 
tools, are described in detail in the following section.
	
5.	 Position your mouse over the path; when the cursor icon changes to 
an I-beam (capital letter I with a crooked line crossing over), click the 
path and type your text.
	
	 The text wraps along the shape’s path. If you type more text than can fit 
on the path, an overflow icon appears.
	
	 You can move the text around or to the inside or outside of the custom 
path by holding Ctrl (⌘ on the Mac) while clicking and dragging the 
mouse around the shape or to outside or inside of the path.
	
6.	 When you finish entering your text, click the Commit icon.
	
	 Elements creates a new type layer. You can edit any attributes, such as 
font size, just as you can with point or paragraph text. See the upcoming 
section “Editing Text” for details.
	
7.	 To create a new custom path, select the background layer and begin 
again.

Using the Tool Options
Using the Tool Options
Several character and paragraph type settings are located in the Tool 
Options, shown in Figure 3-5. These options enable you to specify the type 
and pair it with your images.
Figure 3-5: The Type options in the Tool Options.
Here’s an explanation of each option:
	
✓	Font Family: Select the font or typeface you want from the drop-down 
list. Elements provides you with a What You See Is What You Get 
(WYSIWYG) font menu. After the font name, the word sample is rendered 
in the actual font. You also find one of these abbreviations before the 
font name to let you know what type of font it is:
	
•	 a: Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) fonts
	
•	 TT: TrueType fonts
	
•	 O: OpenType fonts
	
	Fonts with no abbreviation are bitmapped fonts.
	
✓	Font Style: Some font families have additional styles, such as light or 
semi-bold. And other styles are assigned as separate typefaces. Only the 
styles available for a particular font appear in the list. The font style also 
supports a WYSIWYG menu.
	
	If a font you want to use doesn’t offer bold or italic styles, you can 
simulate either (or both) by selecting a faux style in the Tool Options 
(T icons). But keep in mind the key word here is “faux.” The faux bold 
and italic styles are somewhat crude approximations; if possible, avoid 
them.
	
✓	Font Size: Select your type size from the drop-down list or just type a 
size in the text box. Generally, text sizes are shown in points, with 72 
points equaling approximately 1 inch.
	
	If you don’t like points, you can switch to millimeters or pixels by 
choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Units and Rulers (or Adobe Photoshop 
Elements Editor➪Preferences➪Units & Rulers on the Mac).

Book V 
Chapter 3
Working with Type
Using the Tool Options
	
✓	Text Color: Click the color swatch to select a color for your type from 
the Color Picker. You can also choose a color from the Swatches panel.
	
✓	Leading: Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is the amount of space 
between the baselines of lines of type, usually measured in points. The 
baseline is the imaginary line on which a line of type rests. You can 
select a specific amount of leading or allow Elements to determine the 
amount automatically by choosing Auto. When you select Auto Leading, 
Elements multiplies the type size by a value of 120 percent to calculate 
the leading size. Therefore, Elements spaces the baselines of 10-point 
type 12 points apart. Elements adds that extra 20 percent so that the 
bottoms of the lowest letters don’t “hook” onto the tops of the tallest 
letters on the line below them.
	
	Wider line spacing can make text easier to read (as long as you don’t go 
overboard!) or provide an artistic effect. Tighter line spacing makes for 
more compact text but can decrease readability if the tightening goes 
too far.
	
✓	Text Alignment: Choose an option to align horizontal text on the left, 
center, or right. Left-aligned text is even with the left margin and allowed 
to be ragged on the right side of the column. Centered text is evenly 
centered in its column and ragged on both right and left edges. 
Right-aligned text is even with the right margin and allowed to be ragged 
on the left side.
	
	If you happen to have vertical text, these options rotate 90 degrees 
clockwise and change into top, bottom, and center vertical settings.
	
✓	Anti-aliasing: Select Anti-
aliasing to smooth the edges of 
your text slightly. Anti-aliasing 
softens that edge by 1 pixel, as 
shown in Figure 3-6. For the 
most part, you should keep this 
option turned on. The only 
occasion when you may want to 
have it turned off is when you’re 
creating small type to display 
onscreen, such as on web pages. 
The soft edges can sometimes 
be tough to read easily.
	
✓	Faux Bold: Use this option to create a fake bold style when a real bold 
style (which you’d choose under Font Style) doesn’t exist. Be aware that 
applying faux styles can distort the proportions of a font. You should try 
to use fonts with real styles, and if they don’t exist — oh, well.
	
✓	Faux Italic: This option creates a phony oblique style and carries the 
same warning as the Faux Bold option.
	
✓	Underline: This setting obviously underlines your type, like this.
Figure 3-6: Anti-aliasing softens the edges of 
your type.

340
Editing Text
	
✓	Strikethrough: Choose this option to apply a strikethrough style to your 
text. In legal applications, strikethrough is widely used to show sections 
that have been removed, in their original context.
	
✓	Style: Select a type layer in the Layers panel and then choose a style 
from the Style picker drop-down list. Choose from simple styles (such as 
shadows and bevels) to complex ones (such as glass and plastic effects). 
Note that this option is accessible after you have committed your type.
	
✓	Change the Text Orientation: Select your type layer in the Layers panel 
and then click this option to switch between vertical and horizontal type 
orientations.
	
✓	Create Warped Text: This option lets you warp and bend text by using 
15 different types of distortion.
Editing Text
You can apply all options described in this chapter while you enter text, or 
later, when you’re rearranging words or fixing typos and other errors. To 
make changes to the text itself, just follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open your image in the Photo Editor in Expert mode.
	
2.	 Select the Type tool from the Tools panel.
	
3.	 In the Layers panel, select the existing type layer you want to modify 
or click within the text to automatically select the type layer.
	
	 Double-click the T icon in the Layers panel to simultaneously select all 
the text in that layer and make the Type tool active.
	
4.	 After selecting some text, use the Tool Options to make changes:
	
•	 Change the font 
family, size, 
color, or other 
type option: If 
you want to 
change all the 
text, simply select that type layer in the Layers panel. To select only 
portions of the text, highlight the text by dragging across it with the 
I-beam of the Type tool, as shown in Figure 3-7.
	
•	 Delete text: Highlight the text by dragging across it with the I-beam of 
the Type tool. Then press the Backspace key (Delete on the Mac).
	
•	 Add text: Make an insertion point by clicking the I-beam within the 
line of text. Then type new text.
	
	 Note that these editing steps apply to all the types of text — point, 
paragraph, and path.
	
5.	 When you finish modifying the text, click the Commit button.

Working with Type
Rasterizing the Type Layer
	
Occasionally, you may want to transform your text. To do so, make sure that 
the type layer is selected in the Layers panel. Then choose Image➪
Transform➪Free Transform. Grab a handle on the bounding box and drag to 
rotate or scale. Press Ctrl (⌘ on the Mac) and drag a handle to distort. 
After you finish, double-click inside the bounding box to commit the 
transformation. For more details on transformations, see Book VI, Chapter 2.
	
For path type, applying the transformation command will enable you to 
change the shape of your path, but not the actual type itself. Upon double-
clicking the bounding box, the type will then rewrap along the transformed 
path.
Rasterizing the Type Layer
The Type tool creates editable type layers. You can change the wording, 
spacing, font, font size, and other factors as much as you want as long as the 
type remains in a type layer, which retains a vector format. (See the section 
“Understanding Different Kinds of Type,” earlier in this chapter, for details.)
However, after you make all the changes you want, you may need to convert 
your vector type layer to pixels as rasterized type. In Elements, this 
rasterization process is referred to as simplifying. After the type is simplified, 
you can apply filters, paint on the type, and apply gradients and patterns.
If you’re working with layers and flatten your image (merge layers into a 
single background image), the type layers are also simplified and merged 
with the other pixels in the image. By the way, if you try to apply a filter to a 
vector type layer, Elements barks at you that the type layer must be simplified 
before continuing and gives you the opportunity to click OK (if you want to 
simplify) or Cancel.
To simplify your type, select the 
type layer in the Layers panel and 
choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. Your 
type layer is then converted (the T 
icon disappears) into a regular layer 
on which your type is now displayed 
as pixels against a transparent back­
ground, as shown in Figure 3-8.
	
After you simplify your type, you 
can no longer edit the text, nor can 
you resize the text without risking 
jaggies. Simplify your type only 
when you’re certain that you no 
longer need to edit or resize it. 
Figure 3-8: Simplifying your type layer converts 
vector type into pixels.

342
Masking with Type
Another thing to remember about simplified type is that although it looks 
identical to vector type onscreen, it may not print as crisply and cleanly as 
vector type. So, if you’re experimenting with painting or filters on type, just 
make a duplicate of the type layer before simplifying it and then hide that 
layer in the Layers panel. For details on working with layers, see Book VI.
Masking with Type
In addition to its Vertical 
and Horizontal Type 
tools that we discuss in 
the section “Exploring 
the Type Tools,” earlier 
in this chapter, Elements 
includes Vertical and 
Horizontal Type Mask 
tools. These tools 
function almost identically 
to their conventional 
counterparts, with one 
important exception: 
Type Mask tools don’t 
create a new layer. Instead, they create a selection on the active layer, like 
the one shown in Figure 3-9.
You can treat the selections created with the Type Mask tools just as you 
would any other selection. Try the following:
	
✓	Move type mask selections around your document when any of the 
selection tools are active.
	
✓	Store type mask selections for later use by choosing Select➪Save 
Selection. See Book IV for details on selections.
	
✓	Use the selection to 
cut or copy portions 
of an image in text-
shaped chunks, as 
shown in Figure 3-10. 
You can find out how 
this last technique 
works by following 
the steps in the 
upcoming Putting It Together project, “Carving Your Type Out of Stone,” 
in which you find out how to literally carve your words in stone.
	
✓	On a separate layer, fill the selection with a Foreground to Transparent 
gradient to have your type gradually fade out over the image, as shown 
in Figure 3-11. For details on gradients, see Chapter 2 of this minibook.

Putting It Together
Carving Your Type Out of Stone
You can use a Type tool to create selections shaped like text and then use images them­
selves as fills for the type. For example, if you’re creating a floral-themed web page, you 
can use pictures of flowers as the fill for the text. A type selection can cut out any part of 
a picture for use in any way you want.
Follow these steps to create letters made from stone:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open the stone texture image you want to use.
	
	 We’re using a sandstone wall, but you can use other kinds of stone or wood or any 
texture that interests you.
	
2.	 Convert your background into a layer by double-clicking the word Background in 
the Layers panel and then click OK.
	
	 This step enables you to stylize the type later.
	
3.	 Select the Horizontal Type Mask tool from the Tools panel and then click the area 
where you want to enter text; press the T key to cycle through the various Type 
tools.
	
	 You can also select the particular Type tool you want from the Tool Options.

Stylizing and Warping Type
Stylizing and Warping Type
You can do a lot more with type than create conventional labels, captions, 
or paragraphs of text. Type can become an interesting part of your image, 
especially when you stylize, warp, or otherwise transform it in interesting 
ways. Your Elements text can help enhance the impact of your image. The 
text of a beach scene can appear to be wavy, or watery and translucent. 
Halloween type can take on a ghostly or spooky appearance. Text on a 
wedding photo can be elegant and romantic. It all depends on how you 
create and apply various effects.
The following sections show you some of the tricks you can perform by 
stylizing and warping your type so that your words come to life and add 
something special to your images.
Playing with type opacity
Layers are a digital version of the 
old analog transparency, or acetate, 
sheets. (Check out Book VI, Chapter 
1, for the scoop on layers.) You can 
change the transparency of a type 
layer — just as you can with any 
other layer in Elements — by 
reducing the opacity (transparency) 
of the type so that it enables the 
underlying layer to show through. 
Take a peek at Figure 3-12, which 
shows type at varying levels of 
opacity over an image.
The upcoming Putting It Together 
project, “Ghosting Your Type,” shows you a way to use type opacity to 
create a ghostly effect.

Ghosting Your Type
Need some ghostly, semitransparent type? Using Elements, you can twist, transmogrify, 
and transform your text. Create your type from scratch in an empty document or add the 
type to an existing picture or background. Just for the heck of it, these steps show you 
how to add ghostly writing to an existing image:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open the image you want to use as a 
background for the ghost type.
	
	 Any image, ectoplasmic or not, will do. We chose 
a nasty looking witch, as shown in the figure.
	
2.	 Click the Foreground color swatch in the Tools 
panel and select the color you want to use for 
your text from the Color Picker.
	
	 For info on using the Color Picker, see Book III, 
Chapter 5. Black, orange, or witchy green are good 
Halloween colors, but you can use any contrasting 
colors.
	
	 You can also sample a color directly from your 
image by using the Eyedropper tool. Simply click a 
color and it then becomes your new foreground 
color.
	
3.	 Select the Horizontal Type tool from the Tools panel and then click the area where 
you want to add the text.
	
	 You can also press the T key to cycle through the various Type tools.
	
	 The vertical cursor that appears is the size the text will be.
	
4.	 Select a font, style, and size from the drop-down lists in the Tool Options.
	
5.	 Select the Anti-aliasing option in the Tool Options to help smooth the edges of your 
type.
	
6.	 Type your text.
	
	 The text appears on top of the background.
	
7.	 Click the Commit button (the green check-mark icon) next to your text to insert 
what you’ve typed into a layer of its own.
	
8.	 To change the opacity of the type, adjust the Opacity setting of the type layer in the 
Layers panel.

Working with Type
Stylizing and Warping Type
	
	 To make additional changes to the text, you can 
apply a filter. For example, if you want to make the 
text wavy, select the Wave filter on the Filter➪
Distort menu. Or you can use other filters from the 
array discussed in Book VII, Chapter 1. Just 
remember that when you use a filter, a warning 
pops up informing you that the type layer must be 
simplified (converted from editable text to pixels) 
first. Click OK and then apply the filter.
	
9.	 When you’re satisfied with the look (ours is shown 
in the figure), save your image for additional editing 
later or choose Layer➪Flatten Image to combine 
the text and background.

Applying filters to type
One of the most interesting things 
you can do with type in Elements 
that you can’t do in a word 
processing or page layout program 
is apply special effects, such as 
filters. You can make type look as 
though it’s under water or on the 
move, as shown in Figure 3-13, 
where we applied a motion blur. 
The only caveat is that type has to 
be simplified before you can apply a 
filter. Be sure to do all your text 
editing before you reach the filtering 
stage. Applying the filter is as easy 
as selecting the simplified type layer 
in the Layers panel and choosing a filter from the Filter menu. For more on 
filters, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
Painting over type with color
Changing the color of text is as easy as highlighting it and selecting a color 
from the Color Picker. But what if you want to do something a little more 
unconventional, such as apply brush strokes of paint randomly across the 
type, as we did in the top image shown in Figure 3-14? Honestly, it’s easier

make it appear as fast as the car.

than it looks. Again, as with applying 
filters to text, the only criterion is that 
the type has to be simplified first. After 
that’s done, select a color, grab the 
Brush tool with settings of your choice, 
and paint. In our example, we used a 
rough, dry brush found in the Brushes 
presets. We used diameters of 39, 15, 
and 6 pixels and just clicked the type a 
few times.
	
If you want the color or gradient to be 
confined to only the type area, you can 
select the text by either Ctrl-clicking 
(⌘-clicking on the Mac) the layer 
containing the text or locking the 
transparency of the layer in the Layers 
panel.
You can also apply a gradient to your type. Here are the steps to follow after 
simplifying your type:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor in Expert mode, select the Gradient tool from the 
Tools panel.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, click the down arrow next to the Gradient Picker 
to access the Gradient Picker drop-down panel.
	
3.	 Choose a gradient.
	
	 If you want to create a custom gradient, find out how in Chapter 2 of this 
minibook.
	
4.	 Position the gradient cursor on the text where you want the gradient 
to start and drag to where you want the gradient to end.
	
	 If you’re not happy, drag again until you get the look you want. Remember 
that you can drag at any angle and to any length, even outside your type. 
In the bottom image shown in Figure 3-14, we used the copper gradient 
and just dragged from the top of the letters to the bottom. We also 
locked the transparent pixels on the layer to confine the gradient to just 
the type area.
Warping your type
The great automated Elements Warp feature can twist your type in a variety 
of ways (see Figure 3-15) that are not only repeatable but also, thanks to the 
controls in their dialog boxes, customizable. The cool part is that even 
though type has been warped, it remains fully editable until you simplify it.
Figure 3-14: Add visual interest to type with 
color (top) or a gradient (bottom).

Stylizing and Warping Type
Figure 3-15: Choose from a number of warp styles.
Type-warping is fun and easy to do. Select the Type tool in the Tools panel 
and then click the Create Warped Text button in the Tool Options. (It’s the T 
with a curved line below it.) This action opens the Warp Text dialog box, 
where you find a vast array of distortions on the Style pop-up menu with 
descriptive names such as Bulge, Inflate, and Squeeze. You can adjust the 
orientation, amount of bend, and degree of distortion by dragging the sliders. 
The Bend setting affects the amount of warp, and the Horizontal and Vertical 
Distortions apply perspective to that warp. Luckily, you can preview the 
results while you adjust. We could give you technical explanations of these 
adjustments, but the best way to see what they do is to just play with them. 
Figure 3-15 shows some of the warp styles. The names speak for themselves.
	
Web designers take note: You can’t warp text that has a Faux Bold style 
applied.

U

sing Elements without the assistance of layers would be like trying to 
wash your car with a toothbrush and a pail of water instead of with a 
hose and a power-scrubber brush. Yes, it can be done, but it takes a lot 
longer and is downright tedious. The benefit to using layers is that you have 
tremendous flexibility. You can make endless edits as long as those layers 
exist. You can rearrange their order, and if you decide that you no longer 
want them, you simply delete them. Layers make working in Elements a lot 
more forgiving, allowing you to make changes quickly and 
productively.
But hey, it’s not just the technical and practical aspects 
that make layers awesome. Layers also allow you to 
express your creative side: You can composite several 
images into one with just a drag of the mouse or a 
swipe on the trackpad, for example. This chapter 
gives you the basics on working with layers. 
Chapter 2 of this minibook fills in the rest of the 
details. After you give layers a try, you’ll find that 
they make your image-editing life much easier. Now, 
if only they would go out and wash the car.
Getting Familiar with Layers
In terms of a real-world analogy, think of layers as sheets of 
acetate or transparency film, similar to those clear plastic sheets used 
with overhead projectors. You have drawings, photos, or type on the 
individual sheets. What you place on one sheet doesn’t affect the other 
sheets. You can show just one sheet, or you can stack several on top of one 
another to create a combination image, or composite (or collage). You can 

354
Getting Familiar with Layers
reshuffle the order of the sheets, add sheets, or delete sheets. Any space on 
the sheet that doesn’t have an image, a drawing, or some type on it is 
transparent.
That’s how layers work in Elements. You can place elements on separate 
layers yet show them together to create a composite. You can also add, 
delete, or rearrange layers. And, unlike using real sheets of acetate, you can 
adjust an element’s opacity, or how opaque or transparent the element is on 
the layer. You can also change the way the colors between layers interact by 
using Blend modes. Both opacity and Blend modes are covered in Chapter 3 
of this minibook.
When you create a new image with a white or colored background, scan an 
image into Elements, or open a file from a CD or your digital camera, you 
basically have a file with just a background. You have no layers yet.
At this basic level, an image contains only the single background, and you 
can’t do much to it besides paint on it and make basic adjustments. You 
can’t rearrange the background in the stack of layers (after you have some) — 
it’s always on the bottom of the Layers panel. Nor can you change the 
opacity or Blend mode of a background. What you can do is convert a 
background to a layer, making it possible to shuffle, change the opacity, and 
change the Blend modes of your newly formed layer.
	
To work with layers, you must be in the Photo Editor in Expert mode.
To convert a background into a layer, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, choose Window➪Layers to 
display the Layers panel.
	
	 The Layers panel is explained in the later section “Getting to Know the 
Layers Panel.”
	
2.	 Double-click Background in the Layers panel.
	
	 You can also choose Layer➪New➪Layer from Background. Note that the 
name Background is italicized in the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 1-1.
	
	 The New Layer dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Name the layer or leave it at the default name Layer 0.
	
	 Note that you can also adjust the Blend mode and opacity of the layer in 
the New Layer dialog box. However, you shouldn’t do it here. Instead, you 
should make those adjustments by using the Layers panel commands 
where you have more editing flexibility. We cover these techniques in 
Chapter 3 of this minibook.

4.	 Click OK.
	
	 Elements converts the 
background into a layer, also 
known as an image layer. Note 
that the layer name is no longer 
italicized nor is it locked, as 
shown in Figure 1-2.
	
When you create a new image 
with transparent content for the 
background, the image doesn’t 
contain a background; it’s created 
with a single layer. You can convert 
a layer into a background by 
selecting it and then choosing 
Layer➪New➪Background from 
Layer, which moves the background to the bottom of the stack. Note that 
this option is available only when no background exists.
Figure 1-2: Double-click the background to 
convert it into a layer.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
Introducing Different Types of Layers
Although turning the background into a layer (discussed in the preceding 
section) is a popular activity, Elements refers to plural layers for a reason. 
You’ll probably create image layers most of the time, but other types exist. 
Elements offers five types of layers. Some you may never use, and some you 
may use only occasionally, but you should be familiar with them all.
Working with image layers
The image layer is the one that most closely matches the acetate analogy 
(discussed in the section “Getting Familiar with Layers,” earlier in this 
chapter). You put various elements on separate layers to create a composite 
image. You can create blank layers and add images to them, or you can 
create layers from images themselves. You can create as many layers as 
your computer’s memory allows.
Because each layer in an image is a separate entity, you can edit, paint, 
transform, mask (described in Chapter 4 of this minibook), or apply a filter 
to a layer without affecting the other layers or the background. And, after an 
element is on a layer, you no longer have to make a selection to select it. 
(See Book IV for details on selections.) Just drag the element with the Move 
tool. The element freely floats in a sea of transparency.
	
Because showing clear areas, or transparency, is impossible on a computer 
monitor, Elements uses a gray-and-white checkerboard by default to 
represent the transparent areas of a layer.
Using adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind of layer used mostly for color and 
contrast correction. The helpful aspect of adjustment layers is that you can 
apply those corrections without permanently affecting any pixels on your 
other layers. Adjustment layers are nondestructive. They project the 
correction to all layers below them without affecting any layers above them.
Because the adjustment resides on a layer, you can edit, delete, duplicate, 
merge, or rearrange the adjustment layer at any time. You have more 
flexibility in your image-editing chores and more freedom for experimentation. 
Additionally, none of this experimentation harms your image because it 
takes place above the image on an adjustment layer.
	
Another unique feature of adjustment layers is that when you create one, 
you also create a layer mask on that layer. A layer mask is sort of a second 
sheet of acetate that hovers on the underlying layers. You use the layer 
mask to selectively apply the adjustment to the layers below it by applying 
shades of gray — from white to black — on the mask. For example, because 
the mask is, by default, completely white, you can fully apply the adjustment 

357
Book VI 
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Introducing Different Types of Layers
to the layers. If you paint on a layer 
mask with black, as shown in Figure 
1-3, the areas under those black 
areas don’t show the adjustment. If 
you paint with a shade of gray, 
those areas partially show the 
adjustment. The darker the shade of 
gray, the less these areas show the 
adjustment. Note that if your image 
has an active selection border in it 
before you add an adjustment layer, 
the adjustment is applied to only the 
area within the selection border. 
The resulting layer mask also reflects that selection: The selected areas are 
white, and the deselected areas are black.
You can also apply a layer mask at will and use it to creatively blend two or 
more layers. Be sure to see Chapter 4 of this minibook to find out how. It’s 
definitely worth your while.
Elements has eight kinds of adjustment layers, and you can use as many as 
your heart desires. The adjustments offered are, for the most part, the same 
ones you find on the Enhance➪Adjust Lighting and Enhance➪Adjust Color 
submenus. For specifics on each adjustment and the problems it corrects or 
the enhancement it makes, see Book VIII, Chapters 1 and 2.
Here’s how to create an adjustment layer:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open an image of your choice.
	
	 Because you’re applying an adjustment layer, you may want to use an 
image that’s in need of some color adjustment. Note that when you use 
adjustment layers, you don’t need to convert the background into a 
layer.
	
2.	 Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers panel.
	
	 The Adjustment Layer drop-down menu appears.
	
	 You can also choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer and then choose an 
adjustment layer type from the submenu. Name the layer, leave the 
other options at their defaults, and click OK.
	
3.	 From the drop-down menu, choose an adjustment.
	
	 The dialog box pertaining to your adjustment appears in the 
Adjustments panel.
	
4.	 Make the necessary adjustments in the particular Adjustments panel.
	
	 The adjustment layer appears in the Layers panel, shown in Figure 1-4. 
The Adjustment Layer icon (sporting a few gears) and a thumbnail 
(representing a layer mask) appear on the adjustment layer.
Figure 1-3: Layer masks are added when 
creating an adjustment layer.

Figure 1-4: Applying corrections with an adjustment layer, rather than directly 
on the image, allows for more editing flexibility.
	
When you first apply the adjustment layer, the mask will appear white, 
enabling your adjustment to be applied at full strength over the entire image. 
However, in our example, the layer mask of the Levels adjustment layer 
(refer to Figure 1-3) is black and white. Where the mask is white, the 
adjustment shows up over the image at full strength; where the mask is 
black, the adjustment doesn’t appear at all. We achieved this by painting on 
the layer mask to allow only portions of our image to receive the adjustment. 
We also did this to our Hue/Saturation adjustment layer in Figure 1-4. Use 
the Brush or Pencil tool to paint. Or, you can also make a selection and fill it 
with any shade of gray, from white to black. Finally, you can use the Gradient 
tool on the mask to create a gradual application of the adjustment.
You can also adjust the opacity and Blend modes of an adjustment layer, 
just as with image layers. Reducing the opacity of an adjustment layer 
reduces the effect of the adjustment on the underlying layers.
Viewing and deleting adjustment layers
	
If you want to view your image without the adjustment, click the eye icon in 
the left column of the Layers panel to hide the adjustment layer.
If you want to delete the adjustment layer, simply drag it to the Trash icon in 
the Layers panel or choose Layer➪Delete Layer from the Layer menu or the 
Layers panel menu. (Click the down-pointing arrow in the upper-right corner 
of the Layers panel to access the menu.)

Chapter 1

Introducing Different Types of Layers
Editing adjustment layers
After you create an adjustment layer, you can easily edit it. Simply double-
click the Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers panel. You can also choose 
Layer➪Layer Content Options. In the adjustment’s dialog box, make any 
edits and then click OK.
	
The only adjustment layer you can’t edit is the Invert adjustment layer. It’s 
either totally on or totally off.
Using the Adjustments panel controls
Click an icon at the bottom of the Adjustments panel. From left to right, 
here’s what the icons do:
	
✓	Clip the adjustment layer to the layer below it (affects only the layer 
directly beneath it, not all underlying layers in the stack).
	
✓	Toggle the adjustment layer visibility on and off.
	
✓	Reset the adjustment layer settings to their defaults.
Isolating your adjustments
If you don’t use an adjustment layer when you make color corrections, the 
correction you apply affects only the active layer (the layer highlighted in 
the Layers panel). The correction doesn’t affect all layers below it, as it 
would if you used an adjustment layer. But you can also isolate the adjustment 
layer to a single layer or a portion of a single layer by clipping.
Here are some tips for using and isolating adjustment layers:
	
✓	Correct part (but not all) of a layer. To enable the adjustment layer to 
correct only a portion of a layer, make a selection before you create the 
adjustment layer. The adjustment affects only the pixels within the 
selection outline. The adjustment affects the pixels within the selection 
outline on each layer that resides below the adjustment layer.
	
	Another way to correct part of a layer is to paint on the adjustment 
layer mask. Painting with black hides the adjustment, and painting with 
various levels of gray partially hides the adjustment. For more on masks, 
see Chapter 4 of this minibook.
	
✓	Clip to the layer. If you want the adjustment layer to affect only the 
immediate underlying layer and not those below that layer, you can 
create a clipping group. To do so, press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) 
and click the line between the adjustment layer and the immediate, 
underlying image layer. For details on clipping groups, see Chapter 4 of 
this minibook.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
Taking advantage of fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern. Like 
adjustment layers, fill layers also have layer masks, as indicated by the Mask 
icon thumbnail image in the Layers panel.
Just as with image layers and adjustment layers, you can create as many fill 
layers as you want. You can also edit, rearrange, duplicate, delete, and 
merge fill layers. Additionally, you can blend fill layers with other layers by 
using the opacity and Blend mode options in the Layers panel.
	
You can confine the effects of a fill layer, as you can with an adjustment 
layer, to a portion of the image. Make a selection before you create the fill 
layer (see Book IV for more on selections) or paint on the mask later 
(described in the previous section). Editing a fill layer is similar to editing an 
adjustment layer. To edit a fill layer, double-click the Fill Layer thumbnail in 
the Layers panel.
Here’s how to create a fill layer:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open an image.
	
	 In this case, open an image that would look good with a frame or border 
or even some type. If you don’t have an active selection, the fill layer 
encompasses your entire layer.
	
2.	 Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers panel; from the 
drop-down menu, choose a fill of a solid color, gradient, or pattern.
	
	 You can also choose Layer➪New Fill Layer and then choose a fill layer 
from the submenu. In the New Layer dialog box, name the layer, leave 
the other options at their defaults, and click OK. Specify options such as 
Mode and Opacity within the Layers panel, where you have more editing 
flexibility.
	
	 The dialog box specific to your type of fill appears.
	
3.	 Specify your options, depending on the fill type you chose in Step 2:
	
•	 Solid Color: Select a color from the Color Picker. (For more on color, 
see Book III, Chapter 5.)
	
•	 Gradient: Click the down arrow to choose a preset gradient from the 
drop-down panel or click the Gradient preview to display the 
Gradient Editor and create your own gradient. For details on gradients, 
see Book V, Chapter 2.
	
•	 Pattern: Select a pattern from the drop-down panel, as shown in 
Figure 1-5. Choose a value from the Scale drop-down menu, if you 
want. Click Snap to Origin to make the origin of the pattern the same 
as the origin of the document. Select the Link with Layer option to 
specify that the pattern moves with the fill layer if you move the 
layer.

361

Chapter 1
Creating Layers

Figure 1-5: Choose from a variety of preset patterns for the fill layer.
	
4.	 Click OK.
	
	 The fill layer appears in the Layers panel. Similar to what happens in 
adjustment layers, a layer mask is created on the fill layer. In our exam­
ple, in Figure 1-6, the words DOGGIE daycare appear in white on the 
layer mask, thereby allowing our pattern to show through. The remain­
ing areas are black, hiding the pattern. We also added some layer styles 
(bevel and drop shadow) to jazz up our type. For more on layer styles, 
see Book VII, Chapter 3.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
	
	 If you want to delete the fill layer, first select the layer in the Layers 
panel; then either drag it to the Trash icon in the Layers panel, choose 
Delete Layer from the Layer menu, or choose Delete Layer from the 
Layers panel menu.
	
You can simplify a fill layer to convert it to a regular image layer. Choose 
Layer➪Simplify. By doing so, you can use painting tools or filters on that 
layer. For more on simplifying layers, see Chapter 2 of this minibook.
Making use of shape layers
Believe it or not, Elements isn’t just about photos and painting. It also has a 
set of shape-drawing tools — six, to be exact. You can fill those shapes with 
solid color, gradients, or patterns. When you create a shape, you’re creating 
a vector-based object: The shapes are defined by mathematical equations, 
which create points and paths, rather than by pixels. The advantage of using 
vector-based objects is that you can freely size these objects without causing 
degradation. Additionally, they’re always printed with smooth edges, not 
with the familiar jaggies you see in pixel-based elements.
To create a shape layer, grab a shape tool from the Tools panel and drag it 
onto your canvas. When you create a shape, it resides on its own, unique 
shape layer, as shown in Figure 1-7. Although you can move and transform 
shapes and adjust the Blend modes and opacity, your ability to edit shape 
layers is limited. To apply filters and many other special effects, you must 
first simplify the shape layers — that is, convert the vector paths to pixels. 
For more on shapes, see Book V, Chapter 1.
Figure 1-7: A shape layer is a vector-based object.

Getting to Know the Layers Panel
Using type layers
To create type, such as the type shown in Figure 1-8, click the canvas with 
the Type tool and type some text. After you commit your text by pressing 
Enter on the numeric keypad, clicking the Commit button (the check mark 
icon) in the Tool Options, or pressing Ctrl+Enter (⌘+Return on the Mac), 
you’ve created a type layer. In the Layers panel, you see a layer with a T 
icon, indicating that it’s a type layer. Initially, the name of the type layer 
corresponds to the text you typed. (You can change the layer name, if you 
want.) Like shapes, the text in Elements is vector-based type and, if left in 
that format, always prints smoothly and without the jaggies. For more 
information on vector images, see Book III, Chapter 1.
Figure 1-8: Type layers automatically appear when you create and 
commit type.
Another useful aspect of type in Elements is that it’s live: You can edit the 
text at any time. Besides being able to change the font and size, you can 
change the orientation, apply anti-aliasing (softening of the edges), and even 
warp it into various distortions. You can transform, move, rearrange, copy, 
and change the layer options (opacity and mode) of a type layer just as you 
can for image layers. If, however, you want to apply filters, you must first 
simplify (convert into pixels) the text. For everything you need to know 
about type, see Book V, Chapter 3.
Getting to Know the Layers Panel
Just like every other important aspect of Elements, layers are controlled in 
their very own panel. You may have seen bits and pieces of the Layers panel 
throughout this chapter, but now it’s time for a full-blown discussion of its 

364
Getting to Know the Layers Panel
capabilities. To display the Layers panel, shown in Figure 1-9, choose 
Window➪Layers in the Photo Editor, in Expert mode.

Figure 1-9: The Layers panel is Control Central for your layers.
The order of the layers in the Layers panel represents the order in the 
image. We refer to this concept as the stacking order. The top layer in the 
panel is the top layer in your image, and so on.
For some tasks, you can work on only one layer at a time. For other tasks, 
you can work on multiple layers simultaneously.
Here’s the lowdown on how to work with the Layers panel:
	
✓	Select a layer. Click a layer name or thumbnail. Elements then highlights 
the active layer in the panel.
	
✓	Select multiple contiguous layers. Click your first layer and then 
Shift-click your last layer.
	
✓	Select multiple noncontiguous layers. Ctrl-click (⌘-click on the Mac) 
some layers.
	
	Only visible layers are printed. This limitation can be useful if you want 
to have several versions of an image (each on a separate layer) for a 
project within the same file. Click the eye icon to show and hide a layer.

365
Book VI 
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Getting to Know the Layers Panel
	
✓	Select the actual element (the nontransparent pixels) on the layer. 
Ctrl-click (⌘-click on the Mac) the layer’s thumbnail in the panel.
	
✓	Create a new, blank layer. Click the Create a New Layer icon (a 
dog-eared page) at the top of the panel.
	
✓	Add a layer mask. Click the Add Layer Mask icon at the top of the panel. 
A layer mask enables you to selectively show and hide elements or 
adjustments on your layer as well as creatively blend layers. For more 
details, see Chapter 4 of this minibook.
	
✓	Create an adjustment or fill layer. Click the Create a New Fill or 
Adjustment Layer icon (the black-and-white circle) at the top of the 
panel. See the earlier sections “Using adjustment layers” and “Taking 
advantage of fill layers” for more on these types of layers.
	
✓	Duplicate an existing layer. Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer 
icon at the top of the panel.
	
✓	Rename a layer. When you create a new layer, Elements provides 
default layer names (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). To rename a layer, 
double-click the layer name (the name, not the thumbnail) in the Layers 
panel, enter the name directly in the Layers panel, and press Enter 
(Return on the Mac). Although giving layers meaningful names may 
seem tedious, doing so can increase your productivity, especially when 
the number of layers in your file increases.
	
✓	Adjust the interaction between colors on layers and adjust the 
transparency of layers. You can use the Blend modes and the Opacity 
drop-down menus at the top of the panel to mix the colors between 
layers and adjust the transparency of the layers. (Take a look at 
Figure 1-10, where we set the opacity at 50%) For details, see Chapter 3 
of this minibook.

Using the Layer and Select Menus
	
✓	Delete a layer. Drag a layer to the Trash icon at the top of the Layers 
panel. You can also choose Layer➪Delete Layer or choose Delete Layer 
from the Layers panel menus.
You use the remaining icons at the top of the Layers panel to link layers and 
lock layers. Both actions warrant sections of their own. Additionally, you 
can view, hide, rearrange, merge, and flatten layers. See Chapter 2 of this 
minibook for more details on all these features.
Using the Layer and Select Menus
As with many features in Elements, you usually have more than one way to 
do something, especially when working with layers. Besides the commands 
in the Layers panel, you have two layer menus — the Layer menu and the 
Select menu — both of which you can find on the main Menu bar at the top 
of the Application window on a PC or at the top of the screen on a Mac.
The Layer menu
Much of what you can do with the Layers panel icons, you can also do by 
using the Layer menu on the Menu bar and the Layers panel menu. (Click the 
down arrow in the upper-right corner to call up that one.) Commands such 
as New, Duplicate, Delete, and Rename are omnipresent throughout. But you 
also find commands that are exclusive to the panel, the main Layer menu, 
and the Layers panel menu. So, if you can’t find what you’re looking for in 
one area, just go to another. Some commands require an expanded explanation 
and are described in other sections of this and other minibooks.
Here’s a quick description of most of the commands:
	
✓	Delete Linked Layers and Delete Hidden Layers: These commands 
delete only those layers that have been linked or hidden from display in 
the Layers panel.
	
✓	Layer Style: These commands manage the styles or special effects you 
apply to your layers. Find more on layer styles and effects in Book VII, 
Chapter 3.
	
✓	Arrange: You use this command to shuffle the layer-stacking order. See 
Chapter 2 of this minibook for more on this topic.
	
✓	Group with Previous and Ungroup: The Group command creates a 
clipping group, in which a group of layers is constrained to the boundaries 
of a base layer. Find more details in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
	
✓	Type: The commands on the Type submenu control the display of type 
layers. For more on type, see Book V, Chapter 3.

367
Book VI 
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Making Layers
	
✓	Rename Layer: You use this option to give a layer a new name. You can 
also simply double-click the name in the Layers panel.
	
✓	Simplify: This command converts a type layer, shape layer, or fill layer 
into a regular image layer. In other words, it converts vector-based type 
and images to pixel-based type and images. See Chapter 2 of this minibook 
for details.
	
✓	Merge and Flatten: The various Merge and Flatten commands combine 
multiple layers into a single layer or, in the case of flattening, combine 
all layers into a single background. See Chapter 2 of this minibook for 
more info.
	
✓	Flattened copy on a layer: This command doesn’t appear on the menu 
but is accessible via the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E 
(⌘+Option+Shift+E on the Mac). This command makes a flattened copy 
on a layer that sits above all the visible layers.
	
✓	Panel Options: Choose Panel Options from the Layers panel menu and 
select a thumbnail size. You can also choose whether to display just the 
boundary of the layer contents or the whole document in the thumbnail.
The Select menu
Although the Select menu’s main duty is to assist you in making and refining 
your selections, it offers a few handy layer commands. Here’s a quick 
introduction to each command:
	
✓	Select All Layers: If you want to select all the elements in your file 
quickly, choose Select➪All Layers. Note that this command doesn’t 
select the background.
	
✓	Select Layers of Similar Type: This command is helpful if you have 
different types of layers in your document — such as regular layers, 
type layers, shape layers, and adjustment layers — and you want to 
select just one type. Select a layer and then choose Select➪Similar Layers.
	
✓	Deselect All Layers: Choose Select➪Deselect Layers.
Making Layers
Good old-fashioned image layers are the backbone of the world of layers. 
You can create multiple image layers within a single document. Even more 
fun is creating a composite from several images. The creative possibilities 
are endless. The following sections look at the various ways to create these 
layers.

368
Making Layers
Creating a new layer
You can create a layer in a new file or an existing one. To go the new-file 
route, choose File➪New in the Photo Editor, in Expert mode. Then, in the 
New dialog box that appears, select Transparent for the Background 
Contents option. (Note: Your new file appears labeled as Layer 1 rather 
than as Background.)
If you have an open image and you want to create a new, blank layer, you 
can use any of the following methods to do so:
	
✓	In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, click the Create New Layer icon at 
the top of the Layers panel. A layer with the default name of Layer 1 
appears in the Layers panel.
	
✓	In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, select New Layer from the Layers 
panel menu (click the down-pointing arrow in the upper-right area of the 
panel).
	
✓	Choose Layer➪New➪Layer.
	
	If you create a layer by using either the second or third method in this 
list, you open a dialog box in which you name your layer and can specify 
other options for blending and opacity. Provide a name for your layer 
and click OK. You should specify the other options directly in the Layers 
panel later.
After your new transparent layer is ready to go, you can put content on the 
new layer in one of several ways:
	
✓	Paint directly on the layer. Use one of the painting tools, such as the 
Brush or Pencil.
	
✓	Copy and paste a selection to your layer. Make a selection on another 
layer or on the background within the same document or from another 
image entirely. Then choose Edit➪Copy. Select your new, blank layer in 
the Layers panel and choose Edit➪Paste.
	
✓	Cut and paste a selection to your layer. Make a selection on another 
layer (or on the background) within the same document or from another 
image and then choose Edit➪Cut. Select a new, blank layer and choose 
Edit➪Paste. Just remember that Elements deletes the selection from the 
source and adds it to your new layer, as shown in Figure 1-11.
	
✓	Transfer an entire image to your new layer. Choose Select➪All and 
then either Edit➪Copy or Edit➪Cut. Select a new, blank layer and 
choose Edit➪Paste.

Figure 1-11: Cutting and pasting a selection from one layer to another leaves a transparent 
hole on the original layer.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy command on the 
Layer menu. Make a selection on a layer or background and choose 
Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy. The copied selection is placed on a new layer 
with the default name of Layer 1. You can do the same with the Layer via Cut 
command, but in this case, Elements cuts, or deletes, the selected area from 
the source layer or background and places it on the new layer. The source 
layer is left with a transparent or background-colored hole (refer to Figure 1-11).
	
You can use these two commands only within the same image. You can’t use 
them between images.

370
Compositing with Multiple Images
Duplicating layers
If you want to duplicate an existing layer, first select it in the Layers panel. 
Then drag the layer to the Create New Layer icon at the top of the Layers 
panel. You can also duplicate a layer by selecting Duplicate Layer from the 
Layers panel menu or by choosing Layer➪Duplicate Layer. As when you 
create a new layer, both menu methods prompt you with a dialog box to 
name your layer and specify other options. Provide a name for your layer 
and click OK. If you choose the first method, Elements provides the default 
name of the original layer with the word Copy appended to the name.
	
Duplicating layers can be especially handy when you want to experiment 
with a special effect but don’t want to harm your original image.
Compositing with Multiple Images
Often, when working with layers, you’re not using just a single image. Face it: 
You can do only so much to that family portrait taken down at the local 
photo studio. But pluck your family out of that stale studio and put them in 
front of the ruins at Pompeii or the summit at K2, and you have endless 
hours of fun. When you get the hang of working with several images, you find 
that it opens up a completely new realm of creative possibilities. And, you’re 
not limited to snapshots. You can incorporate type, shapes, and scans of 
just about anything you can place on a scanning bed. Apply some effects, 
maybe a filter or two, and you have an image worthy of some major wall 
space.
Copying and pasting images
In the earlier “Making Layers” section, we explain how to use the Copy, Cut, 
and Paste commands within the same image or between two images when 
you want to fill a new, blank layer with content. You can also use the Copy 
and Paste commands without having a blank layer ready. When you copy 
and paste a selection without a blank layer, Elements automatically creates a 
new layer from the pasted selection. You can go on your merry way and 
perform all your layer creations by using only those commands. However, 
we rarely use them when working with multiple images. We prefer the 
drag-and-drop method, which we describe in the following section.
	
The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged, or joined, 
copy of all visible layers within the selection.

371
Book VI 
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Compositing with Multiple Images
Dragging and dropping layers
Follow these steps to drag and drop layers from one file to another:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open two or more images.
	
2.	 In one of your images, select a layer in the Layers panel.
	
3.	 Grab the Move tool (the four-headed arrow) from the Tools panel.
	
4.	 Position the Move tool within an image and click it; then drag and 
drop the layer onto your destination file.
	
	 The dropped layer pops in as a new layer above the active layer in the 
image, as shown in Figure 1-12. You don’t need to have a selection 
border to copy the entire layer. But, if you want to copy just a portion of 
the layer, make your selection before you drag and drop with the Move 
tool. If you want the selected element centered on the destination file, 
press the Shift key while you drag and drop.
Bypassing the Clipboard
Yes, you can always cut and paste or copy and 
paste a layer from one image to another, but 
we prefer to drag and drop, rather than copy 
and paste, between two images. By dragging 
and dropping, you bypass the temporary 
storage area for copied and stored data — 
the Clipboard. (Whenever you copy or cut 
a selection, Elements stores the selection 
on the Clipboard until you’re ready to paste 
it to its new home.) What’s wrong with that? 
Well, nothing, unless you’re working with 
high-resolution images. Storing images on 
the Clipboard, even temporarily, can slow 
your system. Keeping your Clipboard clear of 
data ensures that Elements is running lean 
and mean so that you can drag and drop more 
images, selections, and layers faster and more 
efficiently. If you want to perform a little spring 
cleaning on your Clipboard, you can always 
choose 
Edit➪Clear➪Clipboard 
Contents, 
which empties it of any stored data.

Figure 1-12: Dragging and dropping a selection keeps the Clipboard lean and mean.
	
If you have multiple elements on one layer and want to select only one of the 
elements to drag and drop, simply grab the Lasso tool and draw around the 
object. You don’t have to be superprecise, but don’t include any portion of 
the other elements on the layer. Then hold down the Ctrl key (⌘ key on the 
Mac) and press the up-arrow key once to neatly select the element. You can 
drag and drop the element and move or edit it without affecting the other 
pixels on the layer. Flip to Book IV, Chapter 1 for help with making 
selections.
Be sure to check out the sidebar, “Bypassing the Clipboard,” for more on 
dragging and dropping.

Using the Paste into Selection command
The Edit➪Paste into Selection command lets you paste one selection into 
another. For example, if you want to make it appear as though a snake is 
poking its head out of the opening of a cave or a paintbrush is poking out of 
a can, Paste into Selection is your command (see Figure 1-13). Be sure to 
check out the Putting It Together project later in this chapter to get more 
practice in using this practical technique.

emerging from another.

374
Compositing with Multiple Images
Follow these steps to insert a copied or cut selected image into a selection 
outline:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, make the selection on the layer 
that you want the image to fill.
	
	 It’s the destination layer.
	
2.	 Select the image that will fill that selection.
	
	 This source image can be within the same file or from another file.
	
3.	 Choose Edit➪Copy.
	
4.	 Return to the destination image layer and choose Edit➪Paste into 
Selection.
	
	 The pasted selection is visible only inside the selection outline. (Refer to 
Figure 1-13.) If necessary, reposition your pasted selection with the 
Move tool. If you need to scale the pasted selection, choose Image➪
Transform➪Free Transform. For more on transformations, see Chapter 2 
of this minibook. In our example, our bottle is showing only inside our 
selection. The bottom of the bottle is hidden, making it look as though 
it’s sitting inside the ice bucket.
Putting It Together
Creating Layers and Using the Paste into 
Selection Command to Make a Collage
You probably remember from elementary school cutting out a bunch of pictures from 
magazines and pasting them on a piece of construction paper. Well, with Elements, the 
idea of a collage isn’t much different, though the activity is a little more refined.
Maybe you want to unleash your artistic side. Or, maybe you need to combine several 
images into one as part of a job. Whatever your reason, you can use the steps here to get 
started on your first collage. And, if collage is too prissy a word for you, you can substi­
tute it with composite — which has the definition “derived from many components.” We 
usually do.
	
Creating a collage takes many steps. Throughout this minibook, you can find a couple of 
ongoing Putting It Together projects, all of which build on each other and lead you to a 
finished collage. Be sure to save your collage file so that you can work on it while you 
make your way through this minibook, if you like.

Creating Layers
Compositing with Multiple Images
If you’re short on photos, you can go to www.gettyimages.com. Be sure to 
register so that you have access to a huge gallery of free comping images — small, low-
resolution images used only for internal corporate or personal noncommercial use. You 
can also purchase high-resolution images for a song (from $1 on up) at www.istock
photo.com or www.stockxpert.com. If that’s too pricey for you, check out 
Stock.xchng at www.sxc.hu, where you can find user-uploaded files and download 
them for free. Just be sure to ask for the photographer’s permission if you want to use the 
images for anything other than practice.
To create the first layer of your collage, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Decide on two images to use in your collage and open them in the Photo Editor, in 
Expert mode, by choosing File➪Open.
	
	 You can pick an image to use as 
your main canvas, as shown in the 
figure, and then open a supporting 
image that you can select and then 
drag onto that main image. However, 
if you want, you can also start with 
just a blank document, which is 
what we’ve done. We then filled 
the blank image with light green. 
See Book V, Chapter 2 for details 
on filling with color.
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Layers to open 
the Layers panel if it isn’t already open.
	
	 Always be sure that the Layers panel is visible 
whenever you’re creating a composite from 
multiple images. You need to see what’s 
happening while you drag and drop, and you need 
to be aware, at all times, of which layer you’re 
working on.
	
3.	 Select an element in the supporting image.
	
	 Feel free to use whichever selection method suits 
your fancy, but remember that the finished collage 
will look only as good as its individual selections. 
For more on making selections, see Book IV.
	
	 We used the Quick Selection tool to select the girl, 
as shown in the figure. We then used the Lasso 
tool and cleaned up our selection border.

4.	 Choose Select➪Modify➪Contract and, in the Contract Selection dialog box, 
enter a value; choose Select➪Feather and enter a value in the Feather Selection 
dialog box.
	
	 Contract the selections slightly (we chose a value of 1 pixel) before you apply a 
feather (we chose a 0.5-pixel value) to avoid picking up some of the background 
during the feathering process. Note that the values you choose depend on the 
resolution of your images; the lower the resolution, the smaller the value needed.
	
	 Using a small feather helps to avoid the harsh, I-cut-it-out-with-a-pair-of-pinking-
shears look.
	
5.	 With the Move tool, drag and drop the selection onto the background image.
	
	 The Layers panel shows that you’ve produced a layer. Notice that your main image 
remains as the background below the layer.
	
	 Don’t worry if your element isn’t the right size. You can find a Putting It Together 
project in Chapter 2 of this minibook that shows you how to scale the layer.
	
6.	 Choose File➪Save As, and in the Save As dialog box, name the file collage and 
make sure that the format is Photoshop.
	
	 Keep the file in a handy spot on your hard drive so that you can find it when you’re 
ready to do more with your collage.
In the preceding step list, we show you how to create a layer by dragging and dropping 
an image onto a background image. The process we demonstrate in the following steps 
is a little different. It entails pasting one selection into another.
To paste one selection into another on your collage, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, 
choose File➪Open, select the file 
you saved from the preceding 
exercise, and open a new 
supporting image, as shown in 
the figure.
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Layers to open 
the Layers panel if it isn’t already 
open.
	
	 Always keep the Layers panel 
visible whenever you’re creating a 
composite from multiple images.
	
3.	 Select the part of the supporting image you want to use.
	
	 Feel free to use whichever selection method you want, but make the selection as 
accurate as you can.
	
	 We wanted to use the whole image, so we chose Select➪All.

4.	 Contract and feather the selection (as described in Step 4 in the preceding set of 
steps).
	
	 Unless you’re going for a special effect, be consistent with the treatment of the 
edges of each element in your composite.
	
	 We bypassed this step because we’re using the entire image.
	
5.	 Choose Edit➪Copy.
	
6.	 In your saved collage file, use the Lasso tool (or any other selection tool) to create 
a selection in which to paste your new supporting image.
	
	 We selected the blank screen of the girl’s laptop with the Polygonal Lasso tool.
	
7.	 Choose Edit➪Paste into Selection.
	
	 Use the Move tool to position the pasted image within the boundaries of the 
selection outline.
	
	 If your image needs to be scaled or rotated, choose Image➪Transform➪Free 
Transform. For details on transforming layers, see Chapter 2 of this minibook.
	
8.	 Choose File➪Save.

W

e hope that you have the time and inclination to check out the 
first chapter of this minibook. That’s where you find all the basic 
information on creating layers. In this chapter, you get all the details on how 
to manage the layers you’ve created. And, unlike some employees, clients, 
or children, layers are extremely agreeable to being managed — even 
micromanaged, for that matter. You can scale and rotate them, hide them, 
rearrange them, link and lock them, and even condense them into one 
loving, collective layer. Yes, Elements has a slew of ways to line up 
your layers in the orderly and organized fashion you deserve.
Viewing Layers
Often, hiding all layers in an image except for the 
layer you want to edit is useful. You can then focus 
on the element at hand without the distraction of 
seeing all other elements of the image. You can 
hide layers with a single quick click of the mouse 
button, as we describe in the following list:
	
✓	Hide all the layers but selected. Select the 
layer(s) you want to display. Alt-click (Option-click 
on the Mac) the eye icon for that layer in the left 
column of the Layers panel, and all other layers disappear 
from view. To redisplay all layers, Alt-click (Option-click on 
the Mac) the eye icon again.
	
✓	Hide an individual layer. Click the eye icon for that layer. To redisplay 
the layer, click the blank space in the eye column. Figure 2-1 shows the 
girl layer hidden in the bottom figure.

Rearranging Layers
	
©istockphoto.com/Yuri_Arcurs Image #18860532 and JohnnyH5 Image #915486
Figure 2-1: You can hide and show individual layers to better focus your tasks.
	
Only visible layers print. Hiding layers for printing can be useful if you want 
to have several versions (each on a separate layer) of an image for a project 
within the same document. You can view selective layers and print them, get 
approval from the powers that be, and then delete the layers with the 
scrapped versions. Only one file to manage — even we can handle that.
Rearranging Layers
You can shuffle the order of layers like clear sheets of acetate used with 
overhead projectors. The stacking order of the layers in the Layers panel 
corresponds to the order of the layers in the document. If you want to move 
a layer to another position in the stacking order, drag the layer up or down 
in the Layers panel. While you drag, you see a fist icon. Release the mouse 
button when a highlighted line appears where you want to insert the layer.

381
Book VI 
Chapter 2
Managing Layers
Moving Layer Elements
Alternatively, you can change the order by selecting the layer and then 
choosing Layer➪Arrange. Then select one of the following commands from 
the submenu:
	
✓	Bring to Front or Send to Back: Send the layer to the top or bottom of 
the stacking order.
	
✓	Bring Forward or Send Backward: Move the layer one level up or down.
	
✓	Reverse: Switch the order of your layer stack when you have two or 
more layers selected.
	
If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost layer. If 
you need to move the background, first convert it to a layer by double-clicking 
the name in the Layers panel. Enter a new name for the layer and then 
click OK.
Moving Layer Elements
Rearranging layers is different from moving the content on the layer. Because 
the elements on a layer are free-floating on a bed of transparency, you can 
easily move the element whenever necessary. Moving the element(s) on one 
layer has no effect on any other layer and doesn’t harm the image.
To move an image on a layer, first select the layer in the Layers panel. Then 
position the Move tool (the four-headed arrow in the Tools panel) anywhere 
on the image and drag it to the position you want. It doesn’t get any simpler 
than that.
Here are a few more handy tips for moving an image and using the Move 
tool:
	
✓	Move the image on the layer in 1-pixel increments. Press an arrow key 
when you have the Move tool selected. To move the layer in 10-pixel 
increments, press Shift when you press the arrow key.
	
✓	Find out which layer holds the image you want to move or edit. If you 
have the Auto-Select Layer option selected in the Tool Options, select 
the Move tool and click the element. Elements automatically activates 
the layer that the element resides on. If you don’t have this option 
selected, Ctrl-click (⌘-click on the Mac) the element.
	
✓	Switch to a layer when you click with the Move tool on any part of a 
layer. To perform this trick, select the Auto-Select Layer option in the 
Tool Options. Be careful when using this option, especially if you have a 
lot of overlapping elements — you may inadvertently select a layer when 
you don’t want to.

382
Transforming Layers
	
✓	Display a bounding box (a rectangle that encloses a selection or an 
image on a layer) that has handles around the elements on your layer. 
To do this one, select the Show Bounding Box check box in the Tool 
Options. This box can be useful if all your elements are melting into one 
another in an indistinguishable conglomeration.
	
	We recommend keeping this option selected so that you have essentially 
the same controls (scale, rotate, and so on) as when you choose 
Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
	
✓	Show Highlight on Rollover. Hover the mouse cursor on any element 
found on the canvas, and an outline magically appears around the 
element on your layer. Click the highlighted layer to select it and then 
move it.
Transforming Layers
When working with multiple images, you no doubt have to scale, or even 
rotate, some images to fit them into your composite. Fortunately, Elements 
makes scaling an easy chore by providing you with the Transform and Free 
Transform commands on the Image menu. When it comes to transforming 
layers and transforming selections, the methods are identical. After an 
element is on a layer, you can just choose the appropriate transformation 
command, and off you go. In addition, you can apply a transformation to 
multiple layers simultaneously if you select the various layers first.
Here’s how to transform a layer:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, select a layer in the Layers panel.
	
	 You can also apply a transformation to multiple layers simultaneously 
by linking the layers first. For details, see the section “Linking Layers,” 
later in this chapter.
	
2.	 Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
	
	 A bounding box surrounds the contents of your layer, as shown in 
Figure 2-2. (In our example, the bounding box surrounds the dolphin 
layer.)
	
3.	 Transform your layer as you want.
	
	 You have several options:
	
•	 Resize the contents: Drag a corner or side handle to size the contents. 
Press Shift while dragging to constrain the proportions. You can also 
click the link icon between the W and H fields to do the same.

383
Book VI 
Chapter 2
Managing Layers
Transforming Layers
	
•	 Rotate the contents: Move the mouse cursor just outside a corner 
handle until the cursor turns into a curved arrow and then drag.
	
•	 Distort, skew, or apply perspective to the contents: Right-click and 
choose a command from the context menu that appears. You can 
also click the Rotate, Scale, and Skew icons in the Tool Options as 
well as enter Transform values numerically in the fields.
	
	 If you want to apply just a single transformation, you can also choose 
the individual Distort, Skew, and Perspective commands from the 
Image➪Transform menu. Or, to rotate or flip, you can choose Image➪
Rotate.

Figure 2-2: Transform your layers.
	
4.	 When your layer is transformed to your liking, double-click inside the 
bounding box.
	
	 The bounding box disappears, leaving behind your transformed layer.
	
Try to perform all transformations in one execution. Don’t go back numerous 
times to apply various transformations. With the exception of rotations in 
multiples of 90 degrees, every time you transform pixels, you put your image 
through the interpolation process (increasing, decreasing, or remapping 
pixels). Done repeatedly, this process can degrade the quality of your image, 
which is why you’re prudent to use the Transform➪Free Transform command 
rather than individual commands — so that all transformations are executed 
in one fell swoop. Note that the above doesn’t apply to shape or type layers.

384
Simplifying Layers
Simplifying Layers
When you simplify a layer, you’re simply converting a type layer, shape 
layer, or fill layer into a regular image layer. You want to do this to apply 
filters or to edit the layers with painting tools. However, simplifying comes 
with a price: After you simplify a shape layer, for example, you no longer 
have access to the shape-editing options — only the editing options available 
to a regular image layer. And, when you simplify a type layer, your text is 
converted to pixels, so you can no longer edit the text. The moral of the 
story? Be sure that your type is spelled and formatted to your liking before 
simplifying.
Here’s how to simplify a layer:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, select a layer in the Layers panel.
	
2.	 Choose Layer➪Simplify Layer.
	
	 You can also choose the command from the Layers panel menu (click 
the down arrow in the upper-right corner of the panel). If you select a 
shape layer, you can also click the Simplify command in the Tool 
Options.
Putting It Together
Transforming and Moving Layers in a Collage
When you have a couple of images in your collage (see the Putting It Together project in 
Chapter 1 of this minibook), you can start transforming them to your liking. Moving and 
scaling are the manipulations you’ll probably perform the most. Elements enables you 
to transform layers without affecting any other layer within the image. To transform and 
move images in a collage, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, choose File➪Open. Select your saved collage 
file in the dialog box that opens.
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel.
	
3.	 In the Layers panel, select the layer (or layers) you want to transform.
	
	 In our example, we chose the layer that has the girl and her laptop.

4.	 Choose Image➪
Transform➪Free 
Transform.
	
	 The Free Transform 
bounding box appears 
around your layer. 
By choosing Free 
Transform, you inter­
polate the image only 
once rather than mul­
tiple times.
	
5.	 Shift-drag a corner 
transformation handle 
to scale the image 
down to the size you want but maintain its proportions, which reduces the amount 
of distortion.
	
	 We reduced the girl’s size by about 20 percent.
	
6.	 Position the cursor just outside the handle until a curved arrow appears. Rotate the 
image the desired amount.
	
	 Our layer didn’t need any rotation.
	
7.	 After you scale and rotate your image, place the cursor inside the Free Transform 
bounding box and position your layer elements by dragging them to your desired 
location.
	
	 We positioned our layer at the bottom of the Image window.
	
8.	 When you transform the selection to your liking, double-click inside the Free 
Transform bounding box or press Enter (Return on the Mac).
	
9.	 Transform any remaining layers, by following Steps 3 through 8.
	
	 If you’re transforming a layer with a layer mask, be sure to choose the layer’s 
thumbnail and not the layer mask thumbnail. Otherwise, you transform the layer 
mask rather than the layer.
	
10.	 As always, when you transform a selection to your liking, double-click inside the 
Free Transform bounding box.
	
11.	 Choose File➪Save.

You probably already have a good sense of the possibilities (which are infinite) available 
to you when you create and change collages. Of course, you can always add more stuff 
to a collage and rearrange its layers, as needed. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, choose File➪Open, select a collage file, and 
open another image.
	
	 We chose an image of a temple in Kyoto.
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel if it isn’t already visible.
	
3.	 Select an element in the new image you open.
	
	 It goes without saying that making the selection accurate can only enhance your 
composite. We want to use our whole image, so we didn’t need to make a selection.
	
4.	 Contract and feather the image’s edges (as described in the Putting It Together 
project in Chapter 1 of this minibook) and use the Move tool to drag the selection 
into the collage file.
	
	 For the most consistent appearance possible, use consistent values for modifying 
and feathering all selections in this composite.
	
5.	 Position and transform the selection, as needed.
	
	 Follow the directions provided in the preceding step list. In our example, we scaled 
the temple image about 50 percent smaller and positioned it in the upper-right 
corner.
	
6.	 In the Layers panel, rearrange your layers, if needed, by selecting a layer and drag­
ging it above another 
layer.
	
	 In our image, we 
dragged the temple 
layer below the girl 
layer, as shown in the 
figure.
	
	 Because layers are 
independent entities, 
you can shuffle them 
indefinitely, like a 
deck of cards.

Aligning and Distributing Layers
Aligning and Distributing Layers
If you’re a precision junkie, like we are, you’ll appreciate Elements’ capability 
to align and distribute your layers. These commands can be especially use­
ful when you need to align such items as navigation buttons on a web page 
mock-up or a row of head shots for a corporate publication.
Follow these steps to align and distribute your layers:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, select the layers you want to 
align in the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 2-3.
	
	 Select your first layer and then Ctrl-click (⌘-click on the Mac) to select 
more layers.
Figure 2-3: Select the layers you want to align in the Layers panel.
	
2.	 With the Move tool selected from the Tools panel, click the Align 
option in the Tool Options and choose an alignment option.
	
	 Elements provides you with handy little icons that illustrate the various 
alignment types, as shown in Figure 2-4.

388
Linking Layers
Figure 2-4: The Tool Options offers different alignment buttons.
	
	 Note that, depending on which alignment 
type you choose, Elements aligns to the layer 
element that’s the farthest from the top, 
bottom, left, or right. If you align to the center, 
Elements splits the difference among the 
various layers.
	
3.	 In the Layers panel, select three or more 
layers that you want to distribute evenly.
	
4.	 With the Move tool selected from the Tools 
panel, click the Distribute option in the Tool 
Options and choose a distribution option.
	
	 The Distribute commands evenly space the lay­
ers between the first and last elements in either 
the row or column.
	
	 As with aligning, you find an icon illustrating 
the distribution types. You can see the 
buttons from Figure 2-3 precisely aligned and 
evenly distributed in Figure 2-5.
Linking Layers
You’ll probably find that you don’t need to link layers in most cases. You can 
simply select multiple layers and apply your command — moving, scaling, or 
rotating, for example. Occasionally, however, you may want to link layers so 
that they stay grouped as a unit until you decide otherwise.

and evenly distributed

Managing Layers
Locking Layers
To link layers, follow these short 
steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert 
mode, select your first layer in 
the Layers panel. Ctrl-click 
(⌘-click on the Mac) to select 
your additional layers.
	
2.	 Click the Link/Unlink layers 
icon just to the left of the layer 
thumbnail in the Layers panel, 
as shown in Figure 2-6.
	
	 The Link/Unlink layers icon 
appears highlighted in the 
Layers panel.
	
	 To remove a link, click the Link/
Unlink layers icon again.
Locking Layers
When you have your layers how you 
want them, you may want to lock 
them to prevent them from being 
changed, as shown in Figure 2-7. To 
lock a layer, select it in the Layers 
panel and select one of the two lock 
options at the top of the Layers 
panel. The checkerboard square 
icon locks all transparent areas of 
your layers: You’re prevented from 
painting or editing any transparent 
areas on the layers. The lock icon 
locks the entire layer and prevents 
it from being changed in any way, 
including moving or transforming 
the elements on the layer. You can, 
however, still make selections on 
the layer. To unlock the layer, simply click the icon again to toggle off the 
lock.
Figure 2-6: Use the Link Layers command to 
group layers.
Figure 2-7: Locking prevents unwanted edits.

Flattening and Merging Layers
By default, the background is locked and can’t be unlocked until you convert 
the background into a layer by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer from Background. 
You can also just double-click Background in the Layers panel. In addition, 
by default, type and shape layers have the Lock Transparent Pixels option 
selected. These options are grayed out and can’t be deselected. However, if 
you need to paint on the type or shape layer, you can always simplify it (as 
described in the section “Simplifying Layers,” earlier in this chapter), 
thereby removing the locked option.
Flattening and Merging Layers
True layers evangelists that we are, we tout the glories of layers in the first 
chapter of this minibook. And, although layers are wonderful, they have a 
dark side: They can make your file go from slim and trim to bulky and 
bloated. You not only create a larger file size that slows your computer 
system’s performance, but you’re also limited to the file formats that allow 
you to save layers: the native Photoshop format (.psd), TIFF (.tif), and 
PDF (.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Elements smushes your 
layers into a background. This file limitation often forces users to save two 
versions of every layered file — one as a native Photoshop file and one as 
something else, such as EPS or JPEG, to import into another program. (For 
more on file formats, see Book III, Chapter 3.)
To curb large file sizes or to use your image in a nonlayer supporting format, 
you have a couple of options:
	
✓	Merge layers: Combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into a single 
layer (not a background). The intersection of all transparent areas is 
retained. You can also merge adjustment or fill layers, although they 
can’t act as the target layer for the merge. Merging layers can help 
decrease file size and make your documents more manageable. You’re 
still restricted to the layer-friendly file formats, however.
	
✓	Flatten an image: Combines all visible layers into a background. 
Elements deletes hidden layers and fills any transparent areas with 
white. Flattening is usually reserved for when you’re finished editing 
your image. We recommend, however, that before you flatten an image, 
you make a copy of the file with all its layers intact and save it as a 
native Photoshop file. That way, if you ever need to make any edits, you 
have the added flexibility of having your layers.
Merging layers
You can merge layers in several ways. First, simply select the layers you 
want to merge in the Layers panel and choose Merge Layers from the panel 
menu or the Layer menu.

391
Book VI 
Chapter 2
Managing Layers
Flattening and Merging Layers
You can also merge just visible layers by following these steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert 
mode, ensure that all the 
layers you want to merge are 
visible in the Layers panel, as 
shown in Figure 2-8.
	
2.	 Choose Merge Visible from the 
Layers panel menu or the 
Layer menu.
	
	 All visible layers merge into a 
single Background layer.
	
Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) 
when choosing Layer➪Merge 
Visible. Elements merges those 
layers onto a new layer.
You can also merge layers by 
following these steps:
	
1.	 Position the layers that you want to merge adjacent to each other in 
the Layers panel.
	
2.	 Select the top layer of the ones you want to be merged.
	
3.	 Choose Merge Down from the Layers panel drop-down menu or the 
Layer menu.
	
	 Note that Merge Down merges your active layer with the layer directly 
below it.
	
One last merge command doesn’t appear in the menu but is accessible via 
the key command of Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E (⌘+Opt+Shift+E on the Mac). This 
command creates a merged copy of your layers on a layer that sits above all 
the visible layers.
Flattening layers
To flatten an image into a single background, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, ensure that all layers you want to 
retain are visible in the Layers panel.
	
	 Elements discards all hidden layers.
	
2.	 Choose Layer➪Flatten Image or choose Flatten Image from the Layers 
panel menu.
Figure 2-8: Merging layers can make your file 
size a lot smaller.

392
Flattening and Merging Layers
	
	 The transparent areas of 
flattened images fill with the 
background color and appear 
as a background in the Layers 
panel, as shown in Figure 2-9.
	
	 If you mistakenly flatten an 
image, you can undo the 
command immediately by 
choosing Edit➪Undo. If you go 
ahead and perform another 
action, undo your mistake by 
using the Undo History panel. 
However, note that if the 
flattening step is no longer in 
the Undo History panel, you 
have no way to undo the 
flattening.
Figure 2-9: Flatten your layers only if you’re 
sure that you no longer need individual layers.
Putting It Together
Checking Your Collage for Flaws and Consolidating Layers
When you begin a project, you may think that you know what you want the result to look 
like. But when your creative juices start flowing, you may decide that something doesn’t 
look right. For example, while we were working on our collage, we felt that our green 
background was a little boring, so we followed these steps to add a pattern to the 
existing background:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open the saved 
collage file and open a new image that you want to 
incorporate into the collage.
	
	 In our example, we thought the green background 
needed some texture, so we opened an image that 
contained some Japanese characters we like.
	
2.	 Select the part of the image that you want to add to 
your collage, as shown in the figure.
	
	 We wanted the whole image, so we didn’t need to 
make a selection.
	
3.	 With the Move tool, drag and drop your new selec­
tion, or the entire image, onto your collage image.

When you’re close to final­
izing your collage, you may 
want to consolidate layers. 
Minimizing the number 
of layers makes projects 
easier to manage and the file size smaller, which is helpful when you get ready to add the 
finishing touches to your collage.
	
Before you merge your layers, be certain that you’ll never have to manipulate them 
separately again, especially if the elements on the layer overlap each other, as ours do.
To consolidate two layers, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, select the layers in the Layers panel.
	
2.	 Choose Merge Layers from the Layers panel drop-down menu.
	
	 The two layers merge and become one.

Chapter 3: Playing with Opacity 
and Blend Modes
In This Chapter

✓	Applying Blend modes for effects
✓	Setting the blend options
I

n this chapter, we show you how to have a little fun and get those cre­
ative juices flowing. This chapter, along with Chapters 1 and 3 in Book 
VII, gives you a few ways to tweak the layers you’ve so diligently created. 
Maybe you want to make one of your layers semitransparent so that you can 
see the layer beneath it. Or perhaps you want to try blending the colors 
between a couple layers in a way that’s slightly offbeat. Look no further.
Take these techniques as far as you want. Remember: There’s no substitute 
for good old experimentation. Before you jump into these techniques, you 
should have a handle on the methods of layer creation and management 
that we explain in Chapters 1 and 2 of this minibook.
Adjusting Layer Opacity
One of the easiest ways by far to make your image 
look interesting is to have one image ghosted over 
another, as shown in Figure 3-1. Creating this effect 
is an easy task with the Opacity option in the Layers 
panel. You adjust the opacity by selecting a layer in 
the Layers panel. Then either access the slider by 
clicking the right arrow or enter a percentage value 
in the Opacity text box.

396
Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes

Figure 3-1: Adjusting the opacity enables one image to ghost over another.
The Opacity setting allows you to mix the active layer with the layers below 
it in varying percentages from 100% (completely opaque) to 0% (completely 
transparent). Remember that you can adjust the opacity only on a layer, not 
on the Background.
	
You can also use the scrubby slider by pressing and dragging your mouse 
over the word Opacity in the Layers panel. Finally, you can also change the 
Opacity percentage by using keyboard shortcuts. With any tool active, 
except a painting tool or an editing tool, press a number key. Press 5 for 50% 
or 25 for 25%. If you’re entering a 2-digit value, just be sure to type the num­
bers quickly, or else Elements interprets the numbers as two different val­
ues. You get the picture. Note that for the default of 100%, you must press 0.
Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
Elements sports an impressive 25 Blend modes. Blend modes affect how col­
ors interact between layers and how colors interact when you apply paint to 
a layer. Blend modes can produce a multitude of interesting, sometimes 

397
Book VI 
Chapter 3
Playing with 
Opacity and  
Blend Modes
Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
even bizarre, effects. What’s more, you can easily apply, edit, or discard 
Blend modes without modifying your image pixels one iota.
Blend modes are located on a drop-down menu at the top of the Layers panel 
in Expert mode. The best way to get a feel for the effect of Blend modes isn’t to 
memorize the descriptions we give you in the following sections. Instead, grab 
an image with some layers and apply each Blend mode to one or more of the 
layers to see what happens. In fact, try a few different images because the 
effects may be subtle or intense, depending on the colors in the image and the 
colors with which they’re blending. Throw in some different opacity percent­
ages, and you’re on your way to endless hours of creative fun.
	
You see Blend modes called Painting modes, Brush modes, Layer modes, cal­
culations, or just plain modes. They’re usually referred to as Blend modes or 
Layer modes when used with layers and painting modes, and as Brush modes 
when used in conjunction with a painting or an editing tool.
General Blend modes
Normal Blend mode doesn’t require an explanation. It’s the one you probably 
use the most. Dissolve is the next one on the list and, ironically, is probably 
the one you use the least. (You can see both at work in Figure 3-2.)
	
✓	Normal: The default mode displays each pixel, unadjusted. Note that 
you can’t see the underlying layer at all with the Normal blend mode.
	
✓	Dissolve: You can see this mode only on a layer with an opacity setting 
of less than 100%. The lower the opacity, the more intense the effect. 
Dissolve allows some pixels from lower layers, which are randomized, to 
show through the target (selected) layer.

Figure 3-2: The Dissolve Blend mode enables pixels from one layer to peek randomly through 
another layer.

Blend modes that darken
Overall, all the Blend modes we cover in this section produce effects that 
darken an image, as shown in Figure 3-3.
©istockphoto.com/dlewis33 Image #2434140 and PhotoInc Image #464286
Figure 3-3: These Blend modes darken, or burn, your layers.
	
Here’s one of our favorite uses for the Darken Blend mode. Scan a handwrit­
ten letter or sheet of music and layer it over an image. Apply the Darken 
Blend mode to the letter or sheet music layer. The white areas of the paper 
become transparent, and only the letters or musical notes display, creating a 
nice composite image.
Here are the Blend modes that darken your image in some way:
	
✓	Darken: Turns lighter pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer 
are lighter than those on layers below. If the pixels are darker, they’re 
unchanged.

399
Book VI 
Chapter 3
Playing with 
Opacity and  
Blend Modes
Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
	
✓	Multiply: Burns the target layer onto the layers underneath, thereby 
darkening all colors where they mix. When you’re painting with the 
Brush or Pencil tool, each stroke creates a darker color, as though 
you’re drawing with markers.
	
✓	Color Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer and burns 
them with color, creating an increased contrast effect, like applying a 
dark dye to an image. Blending with white pixels has no effect.
	
✓	Linear Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer by decreas­
ing the brightness. This effect is similar to Multiply but often makes por­
tions of an image black. Blending with white has no effect.
	
✓	Dark Color: When blending two layers, the darker color of the two col­
ors is visible. This mode comes in handy when you overlay elements like 
scanned sheets of music, handwritten letters, or logos over your images 
and you want the white portions to appear transparent.
Blend modes that lighten
If you have Blend modes that darken, well, having modes that lighten just 
makes good sense. So, if you have the need to throw some digital bleach on 
your brightly colored pixels, try a couple of these Blend modes, as shown in 
Figure 3-4.
	
✓	Lighten: Turns darker pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer 
are darker than those on layers below. If the pixels are lighter, they’re 
unchanged. This effect is the opposite of Darken.
	
✓	Screen: Lightens the target layer where it mixes with the layers under­
neath. Blending with black has no effect. This effect is the opposite of 
Multiply.
	
✓	Color Dodge: Lightens the pixels in the layers underneath the target 
layer and infuses them with colors from the top layer. Blending with 
black has no effect. This effect is similar to applying a bleach to an 
image.
	
✓	Lighter Color: When you’re blending two layers, the lighter color of the 
two colors is visible.
	
✓	Linear Dodge: Lightens the layers underneath the target layer by 
increasing the brightness. This effect is similar to Screen but often 
makes parts of an image pure white. Blending with black pixels has no 
effect.

Figure 3-4: These Blend modes lighten, or dodge, your layers.
Lighting or Contrast Blend modes
This group of Blend modes plays with the lighting in your layers. Some of 
these Blend modes, such as Pin Light, are best reserved for the occasional 
wacky special effect. See these Blend modes in action in Figure 3-5.
	
✓	Overlay: Multiplies the dark pixels in the target layer and screens the 
light pixels in the underlying layers. Enhances the contrast and satura­
tion of colors.
	
✓	Soft Light: Darkens the dark pixels (greater than 50% gray) and lightens 
the light pixels (less than 50% gray). Blending with black or white results 
in darker or lighter pixels but doesn’t make parts of your image pure 
black or pure white. It’s similar to Overlay, but is softer and subtler. The 
effect is like shining a soft spotlight on the image.
	
✓	Hard Light: This mode multiplies the dark pixels (greater than 50% 
gray) and screens the light pixels (less than 50% gray). It can be used to 
add highlights and shadows to an image. Blending with black or white 
gives you black and white. The effect is similar to shining a bright, hard 
spotlight on the image.

✓	Vivid Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, this 
mode darkens the colors by increasing the contrast. If the pixels on the 
top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the mode lightens the colors by 
decreasing the contrast. It’s a combination of Color Burn and Color Dodge.
	
✓	Linear Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the 
mode darkens the colors by decreasing the brightness. If the pixels on the 
top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the mode lightens the colors by increas­
ing the brightness. It’s a combination of Linear Burn and Linear Dodge.

Figure 3-5: These Blend modes adjust the lighting between image layers.

402
Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
	
✓	Pin Light: Replaces the colors of pixels, depending on the colors in the 
top layer. If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the 
mode replaces the pixels that are darker than those on the top layer and 
doesn’t change pixels that are lighter. If the pixels on the top layer are 
lighter than 50% gray, the mode replaces the pixels that are lighter than 
those pixels on the top layer and doesn’t change pixels that are darker. 
It’s a combination of Darken and Lighten; useful for special effects.
	
✓	Hard Mix: Similar to Vivid Light but reduces the colors to a total of 
eight: cyan, magenta, yellow, black, red, green, blue, and white. Although 
the results depend on the mix of existing colors on the top and bottom 
layers, this mode usually creates a highly posterized (a cartoon or flat 
illustration) effect.
Blend modes that invert
If the Blend modes discussed in the preceding sections are a little too sedate 
for you, you may want to experiment with the inverters — Difference and 
Exclusion. These Blend modes, also referred to as Comparative blend 
modes, invert your colors and can produce some interesting special effects, 
as shown in Figure 3-6.
	
✓	Difference: Produces a negative, or inverted, effect according to the 
brightness values on the top layers. If the pixels on the top layer are 
black, no change occurs in the underlying layers. If the pixels on the top 
layer are white, the mode inverts the colors of the underlying layers. It 
can produce some intense effects.
	
✓	Exclusion: Like Difference, but with less contrast and saturation. If the 
pixels on the top layer are black, no change occurs in the underlying lay­
ers. If the pixels on the top layer are white, this mode inverts the colors 
of the underlying layers. Medium colors blend to create shades of gray.

HSL color model Blend modes
These Blend modes, sometimes referred to as the Comparative blend modes, 
use the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminosity) color model to mix colors, as 
shown in Figure 3-7.
	
✓	Hue: Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation (intensity of the 
color) of the underlying layers with the hue (color) of the top layer.
	
✓	Saturation: Blends the luminance and hue of the underlying layers with 
the saturation of the top layer.

404
Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
	
✓	Color: Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the saturation 
and hue of the top layer. This mode enables you to paint color while pre­
serving the shadows, highlights, and details of the underlying layers.
	
	Our favorite Blend mode in this group is Color; you use it to apply color 
to images without obscuring the tonality. Color mode is helpful for 
“hand painting” grayscale images. If you’ve ever admired those hand-
tinted, black-and-white photos used in greeting cards and posters, you 
can create the same effect fairly easily. First, make sure that your black-
and-white image is in RGB (red, green, blue) mode so that it can accept 
color. Create a new layer in the Layers panel and set it to the Color 
Blend mode. Grab the Brush tool (with a soft-edged tip), choose a color, 
and paint over the image. Adjust the opacity to less than 100% to create 
a softer effect. See details on this technique in Book V, Chapter 1.
	
✓	Luminosity: The opposite of Color, this mode blends the hue and satura­
tion of the underlying layers with the luminance of the top layer. This 
mode also preserves the shadows, highlights, and details from the top 
layer and mixes them with the colors of the underlying layers.
Putting It Together
Adjusting Opacity Settings in a Collage
If you’ve followed along with the Putting It Together projects we discuss in Chapters 1 
and 2 of this minibook, you may have a collage that you’re satisfied with. You just need to 
make the final tweaks to get it to the state of perfection.
One of the most important tweaks you can make concerns opacity. Follow these steps to 
adjust the opacity settings on some of the layers:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open your saved collage file.
	
2.	 If the Layers panel isn’t already visible, choose Window➪Layers to open it.
	
3.	 Select a layer in the collage and move the Opacity slider, located at the top of the 
Layers panel, to the left or right.
	
	 If you want the layer to be more opaque, move the slider to the right. If you’re inter­
ested in making the layer more transparent, move the slider to the left.
	
	 We chose our Japanese-characters layer and adjusted the opacity to 10%. We 
wanted the characters to create just a subtle texture, not to appear in full strength.
	
4.	 Save the file and then move to the next layer you want to adjust.
	
	 If you have more complicated opacity settings to adjust, keep reading.

Opacity and  
Blend Modes

5.	 Select another layer, choose Duplicate Layer from the Layers panel menu, and 
click OK to close the Duplicate Layer dialog box.
	
	 Making a copy of a layer is useful because you can add a Blend mode and then 
adjust it to create just the right amount of the effect.
	
	 For example, if you want to define an element in your collage but applying it directly 
on the layer makes the effect too intense, make a copy of the layer. We made a copy 
of our temple layer.
	
6.	 Select the duplicated layer and choose a mode (such as Soft Light) from the Blend 
Mode drop-down menu in the Layers panel.
	
	 Leaving our duplicated and blended layer at 100% opacity is a little too garish.
	
7.	 Adjust the opacity to tone it down as much as you want.
	
	 We brought ours down to 25%.

8.	 When you’re satisfied with the opacity and contrast, save the collage file.
	
	 Oh, by the way, we added a dark green background box and a lucky cat to our 
collage.

and Masking
In This Chapter

✓	Getting rid of items with the eraser tools
✓	Using layer masks
✓	Adding clipping masks
I

n Book IV, we present you with lots of information about making selec­
tions with the many tools that Elements provides for that very purpose, 
such as the Marquee and Lasso tools, the Magic Wand, the Quick Selection 
tool, and the Selection Brush. But we left the discussion of a few tools until 
this chapter. The tools in Book IV involve making selections by dragging 
around, clicking, or painting over. And, though the result is similar — select­
ing what you want or don’t want in an image — the tools in this chapter are 
a little different in their methodology. They involve cutting out, masking 
from, and erasing around.
To add to your selection repertoire, we give you details on 
layer masking, a feature that is the most versatile way to 
get what you want out of an image. Layer masking is 
essentially just another way of making a selection. 
Rather than define your selection with a selection 
outline or by erasing away what you don’t want, 
you can use masks to define the selection with up 
to 256 levels of gray. This gives you varying levels 
of selection. You can choose to fully show your 
layer, partially show it, or hide (or mask) certain 
areas. The nice thing about layer masks is that you 
can creatively blend one layer into another in a multi­
tude of ways.
We round out this chapter by showing you how to create a 
clipping group, yet another way to blend your layers by masking 
them to the opaque areas of a base layer. Don’t worry: It may sound com­
plicated, but it’s a piece of cake.

408
Working with the Cookie Cutter Tool
Working with the Cookie Cutter Tool
The Cookie Cutter tool is a cute name for a powerful tool. Think of it as a 
Custom Shape tool for images. But, whereas the Custom Shape tool creates a 
mask and only hides everything outside the shape, the Cookie Cutter cuts 
away everything outside the shape, much like a traditional cookie cutter 
does with dough. The preset libraries provide you with a variety of shapes, 
from animals and flowers to symbols and faces.
Here’s how to use the Cookie Cutter:
	
	 1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, choose the Cookie Cutter tool 
from the Tools panel.
	
	 The tool icon looks like a flower. You can also press the C key. Note that 
in this latest version of Elements, the Cookie Cutter tool lost its own 
space in the Tools and now shares a space with the Crop tool.
	
2.	 Specify the following options in the Tool Options:
	
•	 Shape: Click the down arrow and choose a shape from the Custom 
Shape picker preset library. To load other libraries, click the panel 
drop-down menu and choose one from the submenu.
	
•	 Geometry Options: Draw your shape using certain parameters:
	
	 	
Unconstrained: Draw freely using the default, Unconstrained.
	
	 	
Defined Proportions: Keep the height and width proportional.
	
	 	
Defined Size: Crop the image to the original, fixed size of the 
shape you choose. You can’t make it bigger or smaller.
	
	 	
Fixed Size: Enter a width and height in the W and H fields.
	
	 	
From Center: Draw the shape from the center outward.
	
•	 Feather: Create a soft-edged selection.
	
•	 Crop: Crop the image into the shape. The shape fills the Image 
window.
	
3.	 Click and drag the mouse on the image to create your desired shape 
and then size and position the shape.
	
	 You can size the shape by dragging one handle of the bounding box. You 
can then position the shape by placing the mouse cursor inside the box 
and dragging.
	
	 You can also perform other types of transformations, such as rotating 
and skewing, manually or via the options in the Tool Options. For more 
on transformations, see Book IV, Chapter 2.

	 Take a gander at the Layers panel. Notice the temporary creation of a

4.	 Click the Commit button (green check mark) near the Cookie Cutter 
bounding box, press Enter, or double-click inside the bounding box to 
complete the cut.
	
	 Figure 4-1 shows our image cut into a flower. If you change your mind 
and don’t want the cut, click the Cancel button (red slashed circle) near 
the bounding box or press Esc.

If you’re looking for information about the Magic Extractor, forget about it. 
Adobe gave it the ax in this latest version of Elements.
Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
The eraser tools let you erase portions of an image. The three eraser tools 
are the regular Eraser, the Magic Eraser, and the Background Eraser, which 
all share a flyout menu in the Tools panel.
The eraser tools look like real erasers, so you can’t miss them. But just in 
case you do, press E to cycle through the three tools.
	
When you erase pixels, those pixels are gone — for good. Before using the 
eraser tools, make a backup of your image. You can save the image as either 
a separate file or another layer. That way, if things run amok, you have some 
cheap insurance.

410
Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
Using the Eraser tool
The Eraser tool allows you to erase 
areas on your image. If the image 
contains just a background, you 
erase to the background color. If the 
image is on a layer, you erase to 
transparency. Both instances are 
shown in Figure 4-2.
To use this tool, simply select the 
image and then click and drag 
through your desired area on it, and 
you’re done. Because it isn’t the 
most accurate tool on the planet, 
remember to zoom way in and use 
smaller brush tips to erase 
accurately.
These options in the Tool Options 
control the Eraser tool:
	
✓	Brush Presets Picker: Click the 
drop-down panel to access the 
Brush presets. Choose the 
brush you want. Again, addi­
tional brush libraries are avail­
able from the Brush panel 
menu.
	
✓	Size: Slide the Size slider and 
choose a brush size between 
1 and 2500 pixels.
	
✓	Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for the erased areas. The 
lower the Opacity setting, the less it erases. This option isn’t available 
for Block mode.
	
✓	Type: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Brush or 
Pencil, you have access to the Brush Preset Picker panel in the Tool 
Options. When you select Block, you’re stuck with one size (a 16-x-16-
pixel square tip). But because the block size remains constant, if you 
zoom way in, you can perform some detailed erasing.
Selecting and erasing by color
The Magic Eraser tool works like a combination Eraser and Magic Wand tool. 
It selects and erases similarly colored pixels simultaneously. Here’s how it 
works:
©istockphoto.com/gmutlu Image #4440145
Figure 4-2: The Eraser tool erases to either the 
background color (top) or, if you’re on a layer, 
transparency (bottom).

411
Book VI 
Chapter 4
Cutting, Erasing, 
and Masking
Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
	
✓	When you click a 
layer: The Magic 
Eraser tool erases 
pixels of a similar 
color based on a 
specified range and 
leaves the area trans­
parent, as shown in 
Figure 4-3.
	
✓	When you click the 
background: The 
Magic Eraser tool 
automatically con­
verts the background 
to a layer and then 
does the same pixel-
erasing thing.
	
✓	When you click a 
layer with locked 
transparency: The Magic Eraser tool erases the pixels and replaces the 
area with the background color.
Here are the options for using the Magic Eraser tool:
	
✓	Tolerance: Defines the range of colors that Elements erases, just as it 
does with the Magic Wand tool. The value determines how similar a 
neighboring color has to be to the color you click. A higher value picks 
up more colors, whereas a lower value picks up fewer colors.
	
✓	Anti-aliasing: Creates a slightly soft edge around the transparent area.
	
✓	Contiguous: Selects only similar colors that are adjacent to each other. 
Deselect this option to select and then delete similarly colored pixels 
wherever they appear in your image.
	
✓	Sample All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers, but 
erases pixels on only the active layer.
	
✓	Opacity: Works like it does for the regular Eraser tool, described in the 
previous section.
Removing the background from an image
The Background Eraser tool is probably the most sophisticated of the 
Eraser-tool lot. It erases the background from an image and should leave the 
foreground untouched. But if you’re not careful in using the Background 
Eraser tool, it can erase the foreground and anything else in its path.

Figure 4-3: Clicking with the Magic Eraser simultaneously 
selects and erases similarly colored pixels.

412
Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
	
Like the Magic Eraser 
tool, the Background 
Eraser tool erases to 
transparency on a layer. 
If you drag on the back­
ground, Elements con­
verts the background 
into a layer.
To use the Background 
Eraser tool successfully, 
carefully keep the cross­
hair, or hot spot, which 
appears in the center of 
the cursor, on the back­
ground pixels while you 
drag. The hot spot sam­
ples the color of the pix­
els and deletes pixels of 
that color wherever they fall under the brush circumference. But, if you get 
close to a foreground pixel with the hot spot, that pixel is gobbled up as 
well. This tool works better with images that have good contrast in color 
between the background and foreground objects, as shown in Figure 4-4. 
Also, if your image has very detailed or wispy edges (such as hair or fur), 
you’re better off using a layer mask, which we describe next.
Here’s the rundown on the options, found in the Tool Options, for the 
Background Eraser:
	
✓	Brush Settings: Click the Brush Settings button to bring up the settings 
to customize the size, hardness, spacing, roundness, and angle of your 
brush tip. The Size and Tolerance settings at the bottom are for pressure-
sensitive drawing tablets. You can base the size and tolerance on the 
pen pressure or position of the thumbwheel.
	
✓	Limits: The Contiguous sampling setting erases similar colors that are 
adjacent to one another under the brush circumference. The Discontiguous 
sampling setting erases similar colors whenever they’re under the brush 
circumference, regardless of whether they’re adjacent.
	
✓	Tolerance: Works just like the Magic Eraser Tolerance setting, described 
in the previous section.

because you can inadvertently eat up pixels.

Working with Layer Masks
Working with Layer Masks
A layer mask is one of the most helpful and powerful creative tools at your 
disposal. But before we get ahead of ourselves and tell you how to create a 
layer mask, you may want to know what one is and why in the world you 
would ever need one.
A layer mask is similar to a second sheet of acetate that hovers over a layer. 
You can use layer masks with image layers and adjustment layers, as follows:
	
✓	For an image layer, the layer mask allows you to selectively show, hide, 
or partially show portions of your image.
	
✓	With adjustment layers, the layer mask lets you selectively apply the 
adjustment to the layers below it.
You do this by painting on a layer mask with black and white and various 
shades of gray. Any black areas on the mask hide the image or the adjust­
ment; any white areas show the image or adjustment; and anything between 
them (gray) partially shows the image or adjustment, as shown in Figure 4-5, 
where we hid the background of the girl image so that the image of the bal­
loons would show through. The darker the shade of gray, the less it shows 
the image or adjustment.
©istockphoto.com/Zennie Image #478144 and kaisersosa67 Image #186601
Figure 4-5: A layer mask uses varying shades of gray to selectively show and hide the under­
lying layer.

414
Working with Layer Masks
Note that if you have an active selection border in your image before you 
add an adjustment layer, the adjustment is applied to only that area within 
the selection border. The resulting layer mask also reflects that selection: The 
selected areas are white, and the unselected areas are black. By default, the 
mask is completely white. This allows the image or adjustment to be fully 
applied to the layers.
Layer masks are excellent for blending layers of images and creating soft 
transitions between elements. You can gradually brush in transparency and 
opacity on a selective-pixel basis. You can even apply gradients and filters to 
your layer masks to create interesting special effects.
	
Masking is just another way of making a selection. Rather than make a selec­
tion with a single selection outline (it’s either selected or it isn’t), masks let 
you create a selection with up to 256 levels of gray — from white to black.
Now, for the fun part. Follow these steps to create a layer mask:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open or create a layered image.
	
2.	 In the Layers panel, select the layer that you want to hide portions of.
	
	 In our case, we want to hide the background of the little girl (refer to 
Figure 4-5) so that the balloons layer underneath could show through 
instead.
	
3.	 In the Layers panel, click the Add Layer Mask icon (circle on a square) 
at the top of the panel.
	
	 You see the appearance of a second thumbnail, directly to the right of 
your image thumbnail, in the Layers panel.
	
4.	 With the painting tool of your choice (we recommend the Brush tool), 
paint on your layer mask.
	
	 Make sure that the mask is selected, not the actual layer. You see black 
brackets around the thumbnail in the Layers panel.
	
a.	 Apply a foreground color of black where you want to hide the portions 
of the layer. Leave the mask white where you want the layer to show.
	
b.	 Adjust the Opacity setting in the Tool Options to paint with a less-
opaque black, which is essentially like painting with gray. The higher 
the opacity, the darker the gray and the more it partially hides the 
layer. If you want subtle blending between layers, use a large, feath­
ered brush tip and vary your opacity settings accordingly.
	
	 If things start to run amok, just choose Edit➪Fill and fill the entire layer 
mask with white to start again. As you can see from the figure, we painted 
some of the background of the girl with black. We used a large feathered 
brush to create soft edges around the girl and her smaller balloons.

415

Chapter 4
Cutting, Erasing, 
and Masking
Working with Layer Masks
	
You can also use the 
Gradient tool on the layer 
mask. Using foreground 
and background colors of 
white and black, you can 
create a nice transition 
from showing and hiding 
the layer, as shown in 
Figure 4-6. The darker 
areas of the gradient 
gradually hide the image, 
whereas the lighter areas 
gradually show the 
image. This is a helpful 
way to creatively and 
subtly blend one layer 
into another. For more 
on gradients, see Book V, 
Chapter 2.
	
You can also use layer masks to selectively show and hide the effects of an 
adjustment layer. (See Chapter 1 of this minibook for more on adjustment 
layers.)
Here are some other things to remember when using layer masks:
	
✓	You can’t add a layer mask to a background layer. You must convert the 
background into a layer first.
	
✓	Feel free to edit your layer mask at will. Unlike simply making a feath­
ered selection, you can continue adjusting how much of the current 
layer or underlying images show — or how gradually one image blends 
into another. Just change the areas of white, black, and gray on the layer 
mask by painting with any of the painting tools.
	
✓	To load the mask as a selection outline, Ctrl-click (⌘-click on the Mac) 
the layer mask thumbnail in the Layers panel.
	
✓	To temporarily hide a mask, Shift-click the layer mask thumbnail in the 
Layers panel. Repeat to show the mask.
	
✓	To view the mask without seeing the image, Alt-click (Option-click on the 
Mac) the Layer Mask thumbnail in the Layers panel. This action can be 
helpful when editing a layer mask.
	
✓	You can unlink a layer from its layer mask. By default, Elements links a 
layer mask to the contents of the layer. This link enables them to move

Figure 4-6: Layer masks enable you to also softly blend two 
layers.

Creating Clipping Masks
together. To unlink a layer from its mask, click the link icon on the layer 
in the Layers panel. Click again to reestablish the link.
	
✓	To delete a layer mask, drag the layer mask thumbnail to the trash icon 
in the Layers panel and click Delete in the dialog box.
	
✓	To apply a layer mask so that it’s fused to the layer and can no longer be 
edited, drag the mask thumbnail to the Trash icon in the Layers panel 
and click Apply in the dialog box.
	
✓	Try applying a filter to your layer mask to create an interesting special 
effect.
Note that many of these commands are also available from the Layer➪Layer 
Mask submenu.
Creating Clipping Masks
In a clipping mask, the bottommost layer (also known as the base layer) acts 
as a mask for the layers above it. The layer or layers above clip to the 
opaque areas of the base layer and don’t show over the transparent areas of 
the base layer.
Creating a clipping mask works well if you want to fill a shape or some type 
with different images on multiple layers.
Using the steps that follow, we opened our image and converted the 
Background to a layer. We then used the Custom Shape tool to create a 
shape of an alarm clock on another layer and put that layer underneath the 
layer of the actor. We then created a clipping mask between the actor and 
the shape of the alarm clock. We then added a new layer, filled it with white, 
and made it the bottommost layer.
Follow these steps to create your own clipping mask:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open or create an image that has 
several layers.
	
	 To best see how this technique works, try creating a shape layer for 
your base layer. For more on shape layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.
	
2.	 Arrange your layers so that your base layer is the bottommost layer.
	
	 See Chapter 2 of this minibook for more on rearranging layers.

3.	 Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and, in the Layers panel, position 
the mouse cursor over the line dividing the base layer and the layer 
above it.
	
	 The cursor changes to two overlapping circles with a small arrow icon. 
You can also choose Layer➪Create Clipping Mask.
	
4.	 Click the mouse button.
	
5.	 Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for any remaining layers you want to have 
clipped to the base layer.
	
	 Notice how our actor image clips to the base layer (the alarm clock 
shape) in the Layers panel (appears indented).
	
	 Nothing outside the boundaries of the clock shape is visible on the layer 
in the clipping mask, as shown in Figure 4-7. The down-arrow icon 
beside the layer in the Layers panel indicates that the layer is clipped. 
The clipped layers take on the opacity and Blend mode of the base layer.

Figure 4-7: In a clipping mask, layers mask to the opaque areas of a base layer.
	
Keep these additional tips in mind when working with clipping masks:
	
✓	Remove a layer from the clipping mask. Alt-click (Option-click on the 
Mac) the line between the two layers in the Layers panel. Or you can 

418
Creating Clipping Masks
select the layer and choose Layer➪Release Clipping Mask. Both com­
mands remove from the clipping group the selected layer and any layers 
above it.
	
✓	You can also apply clipping masks to adjustment and fill layers. If you 
clip between a regular layer and an adjustment layer, or between a regu­
lar layer and a fill layer, the adjustment or fill layer affects only the pix­
els of the adjacent underlying layer rather than all the underlying layers.

F

ilters have a long and glorious history, ranging from performing essen­
tial tasks (such as removing abrasive particles from the oil in your car’s 
engine) to even more important tasks involving the pixels in your images in 
Elements. In both cases, filters (also called plug-ins because they can be 
installed and removed independently) manipulate pixels in useful and sim­
ply frivolous and fun ways. They can correct less-than-perfect images by 
making them appear sharper or by covering flaws. Or they can enhance 
your images by making them appear as though they’re painted, 
tiled, photocopied, or lit by spotlights. The result of this 
effort can be something to be admired.
This chapter introduces you to the basics of the 
Photoshop Elements filter facilities and starts you on 
the road to filter proficiency.
Understanding Filter Basics
All filters do a simple task in a seemingly compli­
cated way. Deep within a filter’s innards is a set of 
instructions that tells Elements what to do with a par­
ticular pixel in an image or a selection. Elements applies 
these instructions to every pixel in the relevant area by 
using a process that pixelheads call convolution (creating a form 

422
Understanding Filter Basics
or shape that’s folded or curved in tortuous windings), which we normal 
humans refer to as simply applying a filter.
You can apply a filter in three ways:
	
✓	From the Filter menu (in either Expert or Quick mode): Choose a filter 
category and then select a specific filter.
	
✓	From the Effects panel (in Expert mode only): Choose Window➪Effects, 
or click the Effects icon in the lower right of the workspace, to open the 
Effects panel. Click the Filters button at the top of the panel. Select a fil­
ter category from the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the 
panel. Double-click the thumbnail of your chosen filter or drag the filter 
onto the Image window.
	
✓	From the Filter Gallery (in either Expert or Quick mode): Choose 
Filter➪Filter Gallery to apply one or more filters in a flexible editing envi­
ronment. The Filter Gallery is described in the section “Working in the 
Filter Gallery,” later in this chapter.
	
You can’t apply filters to images that are in Bitmap mode or Indexed Color 
mode. Neither can you apply them to type or shape layers. And some filters 
don’t work on images in Grayscale mode. For a refresher on color modes, 
see Book III, Chapter 3.
Corrective and destructive filters
Most digital imagers classify filters into two basic categories:
	
✓	Corrective filters are usually used to fix problems in an image. These fil­
ters fine-tune color, add blur, improve sharpness, or remove such nasti­
ness as dust and artifacts. Remember that pixels are still being modified; 
it’s just that these filters don’t change the basic look of an image. 
They’re just intended to enhance its good points and hide the bad.
	
	Be sure to check out the important techniques of sharpening and blur­
ring, covered in Book VIII, Chapter 2. Sharpening and blurring are the 
king and queen of the corrective filters.
	
✓	Destructive filters tend to obliterate at least some detail in an original 
image while they add special effects. They may overlay an image with an 
interesting texture; move around pixels to create brush strokes; or dis­
tort an image with twists, waves, or zigzags. You can often tell at a 
glance that a destructive filter has been applied to an image: The special 
effect often looks like nothing that exists in real life.
An unaltered image (such as the image on the left in Figure 1-1) can be 
improved by using a corrective filter such as Unsharp Mask (center) or 
changed dramatically with a destructive filter such as Rough Pastels (right).

Single-step and multistep filters
Whether a filter is corrective or destructive, it falls into one of these two 
camps:
	
✓	Single-step filters: The easiest 
filters to use, single-step filters 
have no options and use no dia­
log boxes. Just choose the filter 
from the menu and watch it do 
its stuff on your image or 
selection.
	
✓	Multistep filters: Most filters 
come complete with at least one 
dialog box, along with (perhaps) 
a few lists, buttons, and check 
boxes. And, almost every multi­
step filter has sliders you can 
use to adjust the intensity of an 
effect (see Figure 1-2). These fil­
ters are marked on the menus 
with an ellipsis (a series of dots) 
following their names.
The controls themselves are easy to master. The tricky part is figuring out 
what the various parameters you’re using do. How does changing the brush 
size affect an image when you’re using a brush-stroke filter? What happens 
when you select a particular pattern with a texturizing filter? You can read 
descriptions of how various filter controls affect an image, but your best bet

Understanding Filter Basics
is to simply experiment until you discover the effects and parameters that 
work best for you.
	
Save a copy of the original image before you start experimenting with filters. 
Filters do permanent damage to files — by modifying, adding, and deleting 
pixels.
Reapplying a filter
You can reapply the last filter you worked with — using the same settings — 
by pressing Ctrl+F (⌘+F on the Mac). (It’s also the first command on the 
Filter menu.) You might want to do this to strengthen the effect of a filter on 
a particular image, layer, or selection. Or you may simply want to apply the 
same filter to a succession of images or selections.
To bring up the dialog box for the last filter you applied, press Ctrl+Alt+F 
(⌘+Option+F on the Mac). This shortcut can be quite useful when you apply 
a filter and then decide that you don’t like the results and want to go back 
and try different settings. After applying the filter, press Ctrl+Z (⌘+Z on the 
Mac) to undo and then press Ctrl+Alt+F (⌘+Option+F on the Mac) to bring 
up the filter’s dialog box. The dialog box opens with the settings you used 
last time, allowing you to make adjustments and then reapply the filter.
Fading a filter
Sometimes, you don’t want the full 
effect of a filter applied to an image. 
Sometimes, fading a filter a bit soft­
ens the effect and makes it look less 
“digitized,” as shown in Figure 1-3.
Here’s what you can do to dial down 
a filter:
	
1.	 In Expert mode, choose 
Layer➪Duplicate Layer and 
then click OK when the dialog 
box appears.
	
	 Creating a duplicate layer 
enables you to blend the origi­
nal image and filtered layer 
together as desired.
	
2.	 Make sure that your duplicated 
layer is selected in the Layers 
panel and then apply your cho­
sen filter to the duplicate layer.
Figure 1-3: Fading a filter allows you to mix the 
filtered and unfiltered images.

	 We applied a Palette Knife filter. (You can find it in the Artistic 
category.)
	
3.	 Use the Blend modes and Opacity settings located in the Layers panel 
to merge the filtered layer with the original unfiltered image.
	
	 We brought the opacity of our image down to 65%. If you need more 
details on working with layers, see Book VI.
	
4.	 (Optional) With the Eraser tool, selectively erase portions of your fil­
tered image to enable the unfiltered image to show through.
	
	 For example, if you applied a Gaussian Blur filter to soften a harshly lit 
portrait, try erasing the blurred portion that covers the subject’s eyes to 
let the unblurred eyes of the layer below show through. The sharply 
focused eyes provide a natural focal point.
	
Rather than erase, you can now also apply a layer mask to selectively show 
and hide portions of your filtered image. For details on layer masks, see 
Book VI, Chapter 4.
Selectively applying a filter
You don’t need to apply filters to an 
entire image or an entire layer. You 
can achieve some of the best effects 
when you apply a filter to only a por­
tion of an image — say, to an object 
in the foreground, but not on the 
background. For example, you can 
blur a distracting background so that 
the person in your image gets due 
attention. Or, as shown in Figure 1-4, 
we applied a Twirl filter to the water, 
leaving the surfer unfiltered to avoid 
that overly “Photoshopped” effect. 
(Not surprisingly, you find Twirl in 
the Distort category.)
Working in the Filter Gallery
When you apply a filter, you may be presented with a huge dialog box. This 
editing window is officially named Filter Gallery. You can also access it by 
choosing Filter➪Filter Gallery. In the flexible Filter Gallery, you can apply

an image from looking overly manipulated.

426
Working in the Filter Gallery
multiple filters, delete them, and edit them to your heart’s content. This fea­
ture has made filters more flexible, more user-friendly, and easier to apply.
	
Even when you’re using the Filter Gallery, make a backup copy of the image — 
or at least create a duplicate layer — before you apply filters. Filters change 
the pixels of an image permanently, and when you exit the Filter Gallery, you 
can’t remove the filters that you applied.
Follow these steps to get up and running in the Filter Gallery:
	
1.	 In either Expert or Quick mode, choose Filter➪Filter Gallery.
	
	 The Filter Gallery dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-5.

2.	 In the center of the editing window, click the folder for the desired fil­
ter category.
	
	 The folder expands and displays the filters in that category. A thumbnail 
illustrating the filter’s effect accompanies each filter. To collapse the fil­
ter category folder, simply click the folder again.

3.	 Select a filter.
	
	 You see a large preview of your image in the left side of the dialog box. 
Use the magnification controls to zoom in and out of the preview. To 
preview a different filter, simply select that filter.
	
4.	 In the rightmost section, specify any settings associated with the filter.
	
	 The preview is updated accordingly.
	
5.	 When you’re happy with the filter, click OK in the upper-right corner 
of the dialog box to apply the filter and exit; if you want to apply 
another filter, leave the dialog box open and proceed to Steps 6 
through 8.
	
6.	 If you want to apply another filter, click the New Effect Layer button 
at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
	 Clicking this button duplicates the existing filter.
	
7.	 Select a new filter, which then replaces the duplicate in the Applied 
Filters area of the dialog box.
	
	 Elements lists each of the filters you apply to the image in the lower-
right area of the dialog box.

is more.
Here are some other helpful tips to keep in mind when you’re using the Filter 
Gallery:
	
✓	Delete an applied filter: Select it in the list in the lower-right area of the 
dialog box and click the Delete Effect Layer button (the trash can icon) 
at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
✓	Edit an applied filter’s settings: Select it from the list and make any nec­
essary changes. Click OK to reapply. Although you can edit a particular 
filter’s settings, that edit affects any subsequent filters you’ve added 
after applying that particular filter.
	
✓	Rearrange the order of the applied filters: Simply select and drag the 
filter up or down within the list.
	
	Rearranging the order of the filters you’re using changes the results of 
applying the filters.
	
✓	Resize the Filter Gallery dialog box: Drag the lower-right corner.

✓	Hide the Filter menu and provide the maximum real estate for the pre­

automatically — but not all filters are available in the Filter Gallery. You 
have to access some of them individually from the Filter menu.
	
Filters change the pixels of an image permanently, and after you apply one, 
you can’t remove it. Be sure that you truly like what you’ve done and that 
you have a backup copy of that precious family photo or critical project 
image.
Having Fun with Filters
After you get familiar with what filters are, how you can apply them, and 
how you can modify and tone them down, it’s time to experiment and have 
some fun. Experimenting is something you can do on your own when you 
have an hour or so and some willing images lying around. Create a compos­
ite with multiple layers and apply some filters. Add some different opacity 
settings and Blend modes, and you have yourself a party.
To get your party started, we give you a few tips on a few of our favorite 
filters.
Correcting camera distortion
If you’ve ever tried to capture a skyscraper or another imposing piece of 
architecture in the lens of your camera, you know that it often involves tilt­
ing your camera and putting your neck in an uncomfortable position. And 
then, after all that, what you end up with is a distorted view of what was an 
impressive building. The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes the distorted 
perspective created by both vertical and horizontal tilting of the camera. As 
a bonus, this filter also corrects other kinds of distortions caused by lens 
flaws.
Here’s how to fix those lens issues:
	
1.	 Choose Filter➪Correct Camera Distortion in either Expert or Quick 
mode.
	
2.	 In the Correct Camera Distortion dialog box, select the Preview 
option, as shown in Figure 1-6.

Figure 1-6: The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes distortions caused 
by camera tilt and lens flaws.
	
3.	 Specify your correction options:
	
•	 Remove Distortion: Corrects lens barrel, which causes images to 
appear spherized or bloated. This distortion can occur when you’re 
using wide-angle lenses. It also corrects pincushion distortion, which 
creates images that appear to be pinched in at the center, a flaw 
that’s found when using telephoto or zoom lenses. Slide the slider 
while keeping an eye on the preview. Use the grid as your guide for 
proper alignment.
	
•	 Vignette: Adjusts the amount of lightening or darkening around the 
edges of your photo that can sometimes be created from incorrect 
lens shading. Change the width of the adjustment by specifying a 
Midpoint value. A lower Midpoint value affects more of the image. 
Then move the Amount slider while viewing the preview.
	
•	 Vertical Perspective: Corrects the distorted perspective created by 
tilting the camera up or down. Again, use the grid to assist in your 
correction. We used the Vertical Perspective option to correct the 
church. (Refer to Figure 1-6.)
	
•	 Horizontal Perspective: Corrects halos and blurs caused by moving 
the camera (or if your subject can’t sit still). For better results, set 
the angle of movement under the Angle option.
	
•	 Angle: Enables you to rotate the image to compensate for tilting the 
camera. You may also need to tweak the angle slightly after correct­
ing the vertical or horizontal perspective.

430
Having Fun with Filters
	
•	 Edge Extension: When you correct the perspective on an image, blank 
areas may remain on your canvas. You can scale the image up or 
down to crop into the image and eliminate these “holes.” Note that 
scaling up results in interpolating your image up to its original pixel 
dimensions. Therefore, if you do this, be sure to start with an image 
that has a pixel dimension or resolution high enough to avoid severe 
degradation.
	
•	 Show Grid: Shows and hides the grid, as needed. Choose the color of 
your grid lines.
	
•	 Zoom: Zooms in and out for the view you want.
	
4.	 Click OK to apply the correction and close the dialog box.
The Facet filter
The Facet filter breaks up an image by using a posterizing effect. It gathers 
blocks of pixels that are similar in brightness and converts them to a single 
value, using geometric shapes. (When you posterize an image, you reduce it 
to a very small number of tones.)
The geometric shapes make the image look more 
randomly produced while eliminating much of 
the banding effect you see with conventional 
posterizing filters.
The effects of the Facet filter are subtle and best 
viewed at close range. The image in Figure 1-7 
originally contained some dust and scratches 
and a few other defects. Rather than retouch 
them one by one, we used Facet.
Facet is a single-step filter, so you don’t need to 
adjust any controls. Just choose Filter➪Pixelate➪
Facet and evaluate your results. You can apply 
the filter multiple times. However, even one 
application smoothes out the picture and elimi­
nates the worst of the artifacts.
If you apply the Facet filter multiple times, the 
image takes on a kind of pointillist, stroked look 
that becomes more and more obvious. Using the 
filter repeatedly on the same image can yield 
interesting special effects.
Figure 1-7: The Facet filter 
can simply eliminate annoying 
artifacts or convert an image 
into a “painted” piece.

Getting artsy
Several filters produce great artistic effects. You can find a large collection 
of them on the Artistic, Sketch, and Stylize submenus.
Many users employ these filters to create images that look as though they 
were painted. What those users may not tell you, unless pressed, is that fil­
ters can make photos of less than the best quality look better. These filters 
can disguise a multitude of photographic sins, turning shoebox rejects into 
decent digital transformations.
Try any of the following artistic filters:
	
✓	Poster Edges: This filter gives 
the picture an artsy, poster-like 
look but also enhances the 
edges to make the outline of the 
object appear sharper, as 
shown in Figure 1-8.
	
✓	Rough Pastels: This filter gives 
the look of a fine-art piece cre­
ated with oil pastels.
	
✓	Dry Brush: This filter can add 
an even more stylistic effect, 
reducing details to a series of 
broad strokes.
	
✓	Colored Pencil: This filter 
crosshatches the edges of an 
image to create a pencil-like effect.
	
✓	Cutout: This effect assembles an image from what looks like cut-out 
paper shapes, which resemble a kid’s art project.
	
✓	Film Grain: This photographic effect diffuses an image with thousands 
of tiny dots that simulate clumps of film grain. (If you’re old enough, 
think of old home movies.)
	
✓	Fresco: This effect looks (supposedly) like pigments applied to fresh, 
wet plaster. Okay, we guess — if you squint.
	
✓	Paint Daubs: This effect uses smears of color from your choice of a half-
dozen different brush types — very Jackson Pollock.
	
✓	Plastic Wrap: This filter can produce a wet look, particularly when you 
apply it to a selection and then fade the filter so that it doesn’t over­
power the detail in the image.
	
✓	Watercolor: This nice pastel effect diffuses an image while adding an 
interesting, watery texture.

interesting with artistic filters.

Stroking your image
The filters on the Brush Strokes submenu try to mimic the appearance of art 
created with pen, brush, airbrush, ink, and paint. Here are a few of our 
favorites:
	
✓	Ink Outlines: Adobe describes 
this filter as producing the look 
of a corroded ink drawing.
	
✓	Spatter: This filter generates the 
look you might see from a sput­
tering airbrush.
	
✓	Accented Edges: Use this filter 
to make a subject jump out from 
its background by emphasizing 
the edges of all objects in the 
picture.
	
✓	Sprayed Strokes: This filter cre­
ates a textured, painted brush 
stroke effect, as shown in 
Figure 1-9.
Distorting for fun
With a couple exceptions, the Elements 
Distortion filters twist, turn, and bend images in 
surprising ways, turning ordinary objects into 
wavy images, pinched shapes, and bloated 
spheres.
The first exception? The Diffuse Glow filter dis­
torts images only to the extent that it imbues 
them with a soft, romantic, fuzzy look that can 
make the sharpest image look positively ethe­
real, as shown in Figure 1-10.
The Glass filter can add a glass-block texture or a 
frosted-glasslike fuzziness to an image. Other fil­
ters on this submenu produce wavy images, add 
pond ripples, pinch images, or transform images 
into spheres.

Getting noisy
Noise in images consists of any graininess or texture that occurs because of 
either the inherent quality of the image or the editing process. Noise filters, 
such as Add Noise, produce random texture and grain in an image. If you’re 
new to image editing, you might wonder why you’d want to add noise to an 
image in the first place. Wouldn’t it be smarter to remove it? Well, some­
times. In practice, you can find a lot of applications that call for a little noise 
here and there:
	
✓	Add texture: Objects that 
become too smooth, because of 
either blurring or another type 
of image editing you may have 
done, often look better when 
you add some noise to give 
them a texture, as shown in 
Figure 1-11. This technique is 
particularly useful if one object 
in an image has been edited, 
smoothed, or blurred more than 
the other objects in the image.
	
✓	Blend foreign objects into a 
scene: When you drop a new 
object into the middle of an 
existing scene, the amount of 
grain or noise in the new object 
is often quite different from the 
objects it’s joining.
	
	Say that you’ve decided to take a 
photo of your house and want to insert a certain luxury car in your drive­
way. Unfortunately, the photo of your in-laws’ car is a lot sharper than the 
picture of your house. Adding a little noise can help the two objects blend 
more realistically. You may even forget that the car isn’t yours.
	
✓	Improve printed image quality: Images that contain smooth gradients 
often don’t print well because some printers can’t reproduce the subtle 
blend of colors from one hue to another. The result is objectionable 
banding in the printed image: You can see distinct stripes where the col­
ors progress from one to another. Adding a little noise can break up the 
gradient enough that your printer can reproduce the blend of colors, 
and the noise/grain itself is virtually invisible on the printed sheet.
	
The other filters on the Noise submenu don’t add noise; instead, they make 
noise and artifacts (flaws, such as the dust and scratches on old film) less 
noticeable.
Figure 1-11: Adding some noise can give an 
image some needed texture.

Breaking your image into pieces
The Pixelate filters break up images into bits and 
pieces, providing more of the painterly effects 
that you can create with brush strokes and artis­
tic filters. The Pixelate submenu includes the 
Crystallize filter, shown in Figure 1-12, as well as 
filters that produce color halftone effects, frag­
mented images, and a pointillism effect.
Rendering
In computer lingo, rendering means creating 
something from a set of instructions, in a way. 
That’s why all rendering filters produce special 
effects by creating a look, an object, or a lighting 
effect that’s melded with your original image. 
Here are a few of our favorite render filters and 
what you can do with them:
	
✓	Clouds: Create a sky full of clouds using ran­
dom values taken from a range between the 
foreground and background colors, as 
shown in Figure 1-13. To create a cloud 
effect with more contrast, hold down the Alt 
key (Option key on the Mac) quickly when 
choosing the command. If you don’t like the 
first set of clouds you see, apply the filter 
repeatedly until you do. If you want a more 
“realistic” sky, try using a dark sky blue for 
the foreground color and a very light blue or 
white color for the background color.
	
	Need a quick web background image? Create 
an image of 128 x 128 pixels (or a multiple of 
that size) and apply the Clouds filter. It tiles 
seamlessly on your web page.
	
✓	Difference Clouds: Create puffy objects in 
the sky (or foggy clouds at lower levels). The 
Difference Clouds filter uses image informa­
tion to calculate the difference in pixel val­
ues between the new clouds and the image 
they’re joining. The result is a unique cloud 
effect. Try applying the filter repeatedly to 
create a marbleized effect.

✓	Lens Flare: Create the reflection effect that plagues photographers when 
they point their cameras toward a strong light source, such as the sun. 
The filter mimics several kinds of photographic lenses, giving you useful 
flares that can spice up concert photos and add a sunset where none 
existed. Specify a location for the center of the flare by clicking the 
image thumbnail or by dragging the crosshair.
	
✓	Lighting Effects: In a sort of photo-studio lighting setup, use pixels to do 
this type of work. You can set up 16 different lights and manipulate how 
they illuminate a photo.
Getting organic with the Sketch filters
If you’ve ever envied people who can crank out a beautiful pen sketch in a 
matter of minutes, this filter menu is the one for you. The Sketch submenu 
includes plenty of traditional media artistic effects, such as Graphic Pen, 
Conté Crayon, Note Paper, Chalk, and Charcoal. Here’s a brief rundown of a 
few effects that aren’t quite so traditional:
	
✓	Photocopy: Gives that infamous, anachronistic look dating back to the 
days when photocopiers didn’t reproduce halftone images. This filter 
creates areas of black and white with little gray value when the default 
foreground and background colors of black and white are selected.
	
✓	Plaster: Creates a look that resembles molten plastic more than it looks 
like plaster. The filter uses the foreground and background values to 
color the image.
	
✓	Stamp: Mimics a rubber or wooden-block stamp.
	
✓	Reticulation: Adds texture by reproducing a veritable photographic 
disaster — the wrinkling of film emulsion that occurs when you move 
film from one developing chemical to another that has an extremely dif­
ferent temperature. (Think of a hot developer followed by a bath in cold 
water.) The highlights look grainy; the shadow areas look thick and 
goopy.
	
✓	Torn Edges: Creates the look of ragged paper and colorizes the image 
using the foreground and background colors.
	
✓	Water Paper: Creates the look of paint-like daubs on fibrous, wet paper.
	
No matter which Sketch filter you’re using, if you want to reset your sliders 
to the default values for the preset, press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key, 
and the Cancel key will change to Reset.

•	 Clean Look: A higher value makes smoother, more refined strokes.
	
•	 Contrast: The higher the value, the more contrast and darker overall 
an image appears. A lower value will produce a lower-contrast, light 
gray image.
	
•	 Thickness: Affects the thickness and blackness of the outlined 
strokes. A higher value produces a “goopier” stroke appearance.
	
•	 Smoothness: Fine-tunes your edges and enhances the overall filter 
effect.

•	 Zoom: Zoom in and out for your desired view. You can also use the 
1:1 view (recommended) or the Fit in Window view.
	
•	 Hand tool: Moves you around the image window when you’re 
zoomed in.
	
5.	 Click OK to apply the filter and close the dialog box.
Adding texture
Elements lets you add a lot of interesting textures to your image, such as the 
cracked canvas effect generated by the Craquelure filter (see Figure 1-17) or 
the pixel effect produced by the Patchwork filter.

Figure 1-17: The Craquelure filter gives an Old World–painting feel to your image.
You can find other filters on this menu to help you create mosaic effects, 
add another kind of film grain, and create stained-glass effects in images. But 
the most versatile filter in this set is surely the Texturizer, which enables 
you to apply various kinds of textures to your images or selections, includ­
ing Brick, Burlap, Canvas, or Sandstone.
You can select the relative size of the texture compared with the rest of your 
image by using the Scaling slider. You can even select the direction of the 
light source that produces the 3-D look, selecting from top or bottom, either 
side, or any of the four corners of the image.
Putting It Together
Creating an Angelic Glow
Sometimes, a little blur can add a soft, romantic mood or an angelic glow that can 
improve glamour photos, pictures of kids, or even an object as mundane as a flower. 
The secret is to apply only enough blurring to provide the soft effect you want without 
completely obliterating your original subject. This assumes, of course, that the subject 
doesn’t deserve obliteration, that the kids are your own (or those of a close friend or rela­
tive), and that they are, in fact, of that rare angelic variety.
You won’t want to use this effect on other subjects, such as men, who generally like a 
rugged, masculine appearance. Many senior citizens regard the age lines on their faces 
as badges of distinction earned over a long, rewarding life. Don’t try softening them with 
glowing effects.

Having Fun with Filters
To add an angelic glow to your little angel, just follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Expert mode, open an image.
	
	 We used one of a trio of cute little 
kids.
	
2.	 Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer to 
create a copy of the image layer.
	
3.	 With the duplicate layer selected 
in the Layers panel, choose 
Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
	
	 Gaussian Blur softens the upper 
layer, producing an airy glow.
	
4.	 Move the Radius slider to the right 
to produce a moderate amount of 
blur and then click OK to apply the 
blurring effect, as shown in the 
figure.
	
	 We used a value of 3.
	
5.	 In the Layers panel, choose 
Lighten from the Modes drop-
down menu.
	
6.	 Use the Opacity slider (click the 
right-pointing arrow to access the 
slider) to reduce the amount of glow (if it’s too much for your tastes).
	
	 We reduced the Opacity to 75%.
	
7.	 Choose Layer➪Flatten Image to combine all layers.
	
	 Experiment with different amounts of Gaussian Blur until you find the perfect glow­
ing effect, as we did in our figure.

Book VII: Filters, Effects, Styles, and Distortions

Chapter 2: Distorting with the 
Liquify Command
In This Chapter
✓	Checking out the Liquify window
✓	Understanding the options
✓	Liquifying an image
L

iquify is the only Elements filter that garners a chapter of its own. 
That’s because Liquify is not your run-of-the-mill filter. Truth be told, 
it’s the ultimate distortin’ fool, with a bevy of tools, modes, and options that 
make it a good deal more complex than most of its kin on the Filter menu.
The Liquify filter lets you push and pull on parts of an image; twist, turn, 
and pinch other parts; and bloat and reflect others. You can basically 
manipulate an image as though it were pliable saltwater taffy. And, although 
these actions would create worthwhile entertainment on their own, you can 
use the Liquify filter to perform some productive tasks.
If you pick up any fashion magazine, we guarantee you that 
many of the images of models and celebrities you see 
there have made their way through the Liquify filter for 
nips and tucks and overall body sculpting. Yes, even 
people blessed with natural beauty are given a dose 
of digital beautification for good measure.
Exploring the Liquify Window
At first glance, the Liquify window is a little daunt­
ing. It’s a little daunting on second, third, and fourth 
glances, too. But when you quit glancing and dive into 
using this versatile filter, you find that the tools and 
options make a lot of sense.

444
Exploring the Liquify Window
Open the Liquify window by choosing Filter➪Distort➪Liquify. The Liquify Tools 
panel appears on the left, as shown in Figure 2-1. The other options available 
with Liquify appear on the right side of the window. The Tools panel 
includes a handful tools that you can use to paint and distort an image.
©istockphoto.com/svera Image #2741294
Figure 2-1: The Liquify window is quite user-friendly after you become 
familiar with its tools and settings.
	
As on the main Elements Tools panel, you can activate each tool by pressing 
a keyboard shortcut letter associated with its name.
The distortion painting tools
You use the first group of tools in the Tools panel to paint distortions on an 
image. The following list describes each tool, with its keyboard shortcut in 
parentheses. To see what the tool icon looks like, refer to Figure 2-1. To see 
what each tool does to pixels, check out Figure 2-2.
	
	
✓	Warp (W): This tool is faintly reminiscent of the Smudge tool but doesn’t 
obliterate details in the pixels quite as much as it pushes them forward 
while you drag, creating a stretched effect. Use the Warp tool to push 
pixels where you want them to go, using short strokes or long pushes. 

445
Book VII
Chapter 2
Distorting with the 
Liquify Command
Exploring the Liquify Window
This tool is the main one to use when you want to body-sculpt the per­
son in an image.
	
	
✓	Turbulence (T): This tool adds a random jumbling effect to pixels when 
you click and hold down the mouse button. It acts similarly to the Warp 
tool when you click and drag. Adjust how smooth the effect is by drag­
ging the Turbulent Jitter slider in the Tool Options area. The higher the 
value, the smoother the effect. You can use the Turbulence tool to cre­
ate maelstroms of air, fire, and water with clouds, flames, and waves.
	
	
✓	Twirl Clockwise (R) and Twirl Counterclockwise (L): Place the cursor 
in one spot, press the mouse button, and watch the pixels under your 
brush rotate like a satellite photo of a tropical storm. Or drag the cursor 
to create a moving twirl effect. Pixels move faster in the center than 
along the edges of the brush.
	
	Try this technique with the other tools we describe in this list. (With 
some tools, the effect is more obvious than with others.) Simply hold 
down the mouse button. The longer you hold it down, the more promi­
nent the effect becomes.
	
	
✓	Pucker (P): This tool is the equivalent of the Pinch filter, squishing pix­
els toward the center of the area covered by the brush while you hold 
down the mouse button or drag. To reverse the pucker direction, which 
essentially applies a bloat, hold down the Alt key (Option key on the 
Mac) while you hold down the mouse button or drag.
	
	
✓	Bloat (B): Think of this tool as a kind of Spherize filter, pushing pixels 
toward the edge of the brush area while you hold down the mouse but­
ton or drag the mouse. To reverse the bloat direction — doing so 
applies a pucker — hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while 
you hold down the mouse button or drag.
	
	
✓	Shift Pixels (S): This odd tool moves pixels to the left when you drag the 
tool straight up. Drag down to move pixels to the right. When you drag 
right, pixels move up; when you drag left, pixels move down. Drag clock­
wise to increase the size of the object being distorted. Drag counter­
clockwise to decrease the size. To reverse any of the directions, hold 
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while you hold down the 
mouse button or drag.
	
	
✓	Reflection (M): This tool drags a reversed image of your pixels at a 
90-degree angle to the motion of the brush. Hold down the Alt key 
(Option key on the Mac) to force the reflection in the direction opposite 
the motion of the brush (for example, to the left of a brush moving right, 
or above a brush moving down). This tool is a good choice for making 
reflections on water.

Three tools in the Liquify Tools panel help with undoing distortions you may 
no longer want and also help with navigation. These tools (shown here with 
their keyboard shortcuts) are

Chapter 2

✓	Reconstruct (R): This tool is a variation on the old standby, Undo. It lets 
you reverse or alter — completely or partially — the distortions you’ve 
made. You can retrace your steps if you went overboard in your distor­
tion activities.
	
	
✓	Hand (H): The Hand tool works exactly like the standard Elements Hand 
tool. Click and drag the image to move it around within the Preview win­
dow. You can find more about the Hand tool in Book I, Chapter 2.
	
	
✓	Zoom (Z): This tool works exactly like the Elements Zoom tool, which 
zooms images in and out. Just click the image to zoom in. Hold down the 
Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click to zoom out. You can also 
zoom by selecting a magnification percentage (from 6 to 1,600 percent) 
from the pop-up menu in the lower-left corner of the dialog box. Or, if 
you like buttons, click your way to magnification by using the +/– zoom 
control buttons. See Book I, Chapter 2, for more on using the Zoom tool.
The Options Area
On the right side of the Liquify window (refer to Figure 2-1), you can find 
some menus and buttons that let you specify options for the tools. We point 
them out to you here and cover how to use them in the rest of this chapter:
	
✓	Brush Size: Specifies the width of the brush.
	
✓	Brush Pressure: Specifies the speed at which you distort while you drag. 
The lower the value, the slower the distortion is applied.
	
✓	Turbulent Jitter: Determines how tightly the brush jumbles pixels. 
When you use the Turbulence tool, this option gives the stroke a more 
natural, organic look.
	
✓	Stylus Pressure: Selects the pressure of the stylus when you click it, if 
you have a graphics tablet and stylus. Clicking this option then controls 
the width of your brush stroke.
Distorting an Image with Liquify
Liquify is as easy to apply as finger paint after you play with it a little. Here’s 
a step-by-step scenario of the things you might do to apply some distortion 
to an image of your own:
	
1.	 Select and open in the Photo Editor an image that you want to distort, 
in either Expert or Quick mode.

448
Distorting an Image with Liquify
	
2.	 In the Layers panel, select a layer.
	
	 If you don’t want to distort the whole layer, you can select part of it. For 
more on selections, see Book IV. For information on layers, see Book VI.
	
3.	 Choose Filter➪Distort➪Liquify.
	
	 The Liquify dialog box appears with the image in the preview area, as 
shown in Figure 2-3.

Figure 2-3: The Liquify dialog box is where the magic happens.
	
4.	 Choose a distortion weapon of choice.
	
	 For a detailed description of each tool, see the earlier section “The dis­
tortion painting tools.” To see what each tool does, take another gander 
at Figure 2-2.
	
5.	 Specify options in the Tool Options area.
	
	 Remember to adjust the brush size and pressure to get the exact cover­
age you want. For a description of each option, see the previous section. 

449
Book VII 
Chapter 2
Distorting with the 
Liquify Command
Distorting an Image with Liquify
	
6.	 If you take the distortions a little too far, select the Reconstruct tool to 
partially or fully reverse or modify your distortions.
	
	 Note that the reconstruction occurs faster at the center of the brush’s 
diameter. To partially reconstruct an image, set a low brush pressure 
and watch closely while the mouse drags across the distorted areas.
	
7.	 Apply the distortion to the image by clicking OK and exiting the 
Liquify dialog box.
	
If you mucked up and want to start again, click the Revert button to return to 
the original, unaltered image. This action also resets the tools to their previ­
ous settings. Figure 2-4 shows the Before (and the Extreme After) of our 
image.

Chapter 3: Adding Pizzazz with 
Styles and Effects
In This Chapter
✓	Working with the Effects panel
✓	Taking photo effects for a spin
✓	Stylizing layers
✓	Tweaking layer styles
A

fter you have all the basic elements lined up in your layered compos­
ite image, you may want to give it a little pizzazz. Elements provides a 
lot of different effects that you can apply to enhance your images. Maybe a 
headline would pop out a little more if you beveled the edge, or maybe that 
silhouetted image would take on a little more dimension if you placed a 
drop shadow behind it. In this chapter, you find out how to do all these 
things.
Seeing What the Effects Panel Can Do
Elements has organized all its various effects in one 
neat panel. In the Photo Editor in Expert mode, 
choose Window➪Effects, or click the Effects icon in 
the lower right of the workspace. On the right side 
of the Elements workspace, you see the Effects 
panel, shown in Figure 3-1. Buttons for the various 
categories of effects — Filters, Styles, and Effects — 
are at the top of the panel. Subcategories (or librar­
ies) of Filters, Styles, and Effects are just 
underneath, accessible via a drop-down menu. 
Individual effects, styles, and filters are located in the 
bottom portion of the panel and are displayed by 
thumbnail or name.

452
Enhancing with Effects
	
In this latest version of Elements, you 
can now also apply effects in Quick 
mode. See the section “Adding 
Effects, Textures, and Frames in 
Quick Mode,” later in this chapter, 
for more info.
Click the down arrow in the upper-
right corner of the Effects panel to 
change the view of your effects, fil­
ters, and styles as thumbnails or as 
names. You also find a fast track to 
Effects help, if you need it.
Later sections of this chapter explain 
how to apply effects and styles. We 
go into a hefty discussion about fil­
ters in Book VII, Chapter 1.
Enhancing with Effects
Elements provides a variety of effects 
(also called photo effects) that you 
can apply to your photos. Some 
effects automatically create a dupli­
cate of the selected layer, whereas 
other effects work only on flattened 
images. You can’t preview how the 
effect will look on your image or type, 
as you can when you apply filters. 
Also, you have no options to specify.
Here are the steps to follow when 
applying a photo effect:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert 
mode, select an image layer in 
the Layers panel.
	
	 Or, if you’re applying the effect 
to only a single selection, make the selection before applying the effect.
	
	 For applying effects in Quick mode, see the section “Adding Effects, 
Textures, and Frames in Quick Mode,” later in this chapter. Note that the 
effects found in Quick mode are different than those found in Expert 
mode. And with names like Summer Day and Scary Night, they are worth 
a gander.

the Effects panel.

2.	 Choose Window➪Effects.
	
	 You can also click the Effects icon (fx symbol) in the lower right of the 
workspace.
	
3.	 In the Effects panel, click the Effects button at the top of the panel.
	
	 Refer to Figure 3-1.
	
4.	 Select a subcategory, or library, of Effects from the drop-down menu 
at the top of the panel:
	
•	 Frame: Includes effects that enhance the edges of the layer or selection.
	
•	 Faded Photo, Monotone Color, Old Photo, and Vintage Photo: Makes 
your image fade from color to grayscale, appear as a single color, or 
look like an old pencil sketch or a photo on old paper.
	
•	 Misc Effects: Includes a wide variety of effects to make your image 
appear as though it’s snowing, made of lizard skin or neon tubes, or 
painted with oil pastels.
	
•	 Show All: Shows all effects described in this list.
	
5.	 In the Effects panel, double-click an effect or drag the effect onto the 
image.
	
	 In our example, in Figure 3-2, we applied the Oil Pastel effect to our 
image and the Fluorescent Chalk effect to our type layer, both from the 
Misc Effects library.

Figure 3-2: Enhance images by adding effects to your image 
and type layers.

454
Working with Layer Styles
	
You can also apply an effect to type. Select a type layer in the Layers panel 
and follow Steps 2 through 5 in the preceding list. Note that a dialog box 
alerts you that the type layer must be simplified before you can apply the 
effect. If you simplify the layer, you can no longer edit the text, so be sure 
that your type is exactly as you want it. For more on working with type lay­
ers, see Book V, Chapter 3.
	
Unlike styles (described in the following section), you can’t edit effects. 
Effects automatically creates another layer, so if you don’t care for the 
effect, simply delete that layer by dragging it to the trash can at the top of 
the Layers panel.
	
You may also want to check out the interesting effects found in Guided 
mode. Elements 12 even provides a couple of new effects, Puzzle and Zoom 
Burst, which are worth giving a whirl.
Working with Layer Styles
Layer styles (also referred to as just styles) range from simple shadows and 
bevels to more complex designs, such as buttons and patterns. The wonder­
ful characteristic of layer styles is that they’re completely nondestructive. 
Unlike filters, layer styles don’t change your pixel data. You can edit them or 
even delete them if you’re unhappy with the results, so feel free to use them 
with abandon.
Getting the scoop on layer styles
Here are a few fun facts about layer styles:
	
✓	You can apply layer styles only to layers. Therefore, if all you have in 
your image is a background, be sure to convert it to a layer first. See 
Book VI for details on working with layers.
	
✓	Layer styles are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you 
move or edit the contents of the layers, the results are updated.
	
✓	When you apply a layer style to a layer, an fx icon appears next to the 
layer’s name in the Layers panel. Double-click the fx icon to open the 
Styles Settings dialog box and make any adjustments that are necessary 
to create the look you want.
	
✓	Layer styles are stored in different libraries. You can add shadows, 
glows, beveled and embossed edges, and more complex appearances, 
such as neon, plastic, chrome, and other man-made textures. See Figure 
3-3 for a layer style sampler.

✓	Delete a layer style or styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear Layer 
Style or drag the fx icon in the Layers panel to the trash can in the panel.
	
✓	Copy and paste layer styles onto other layers. Select the layer contain­
ing the layer style and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style. 
Select the layer or layers on which you want to apply the effect and 
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style. You can also just drag and 
drop an effect from one layer to another while holding down the Alt key 
(the Option key on the Mac). Note that if you drag and drop an effect 
without holding down the Alt or Option key, you move the layer style 
from one layer to another.
	
✓	Hide or show layer styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects 
or Show All Effects.
	
✓	Scale a layer style. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select 
Preview and enter a value between 1 and 1,000 percent. Then you can 
scale the style without scaling the element.

456
Working with Layer Styles
Applying a layer style
Here are the steps to apply a style and a description of each of the style 
libraries:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, select an image or type layer in 
the Layers panel.
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Effects.
	
	 You can also click the Effects icon (fx symbol) in the lower right of the 
workspace.
	
3.	 Select the Styles button at the top of the Effects panel.
	
	 Refer to Figure 3-1.
	
4.	 Select a library of styles from the drop-down menu at the top of the 
panel:
	
•	 Bevels: Adds a three-dimensional edge on the outside or inside edges 
of the contents of a layer, giving the element some dimension. 
Embossed styles make elements appear as though they’re raised off 
or punched into the page. You can change the appearance of these 
styles, depending on the type of bevel chosen. Adjust attributes, 
such as the lighting angle, distance (how close the shadow is to the 
layer contents), size, bevel direction, and opacity.
	
•	 Drop and Inner Shadows: Add a soft drop or an inner shadow to a 
layer. Choose from an ordinary shadow or one that includes noise, 
neon, or outlines. You can adjust the lighting angle, distance, size, 
and opacity.
	
•	 Outer and Inner Glows: Add a soft halo that appears on the outside or 
inside edges of your layer contents. Adjust the appearance of the 
glow by changing the lighting angle, size, and opacity of the glow.
	
•	 Visibility: Click Show, Hide, or Ghosted to display, hide, or partially 
show the layer contents. The layer style remains fully displayed.
	
•	 Complex and others: The remaining layer styles are a group of differ­
ent effects ranging from simple glass buttons to the more exotic 
effects, such as Groovy and Rose Impressions. You can customize all 
these layer styles somewhat by adjusting the various settings, which 
are similar to those for other styles in this list.
	
5.	 In the Effects panel, double-click a style or drag the style onto the image.
	
	 The style, with its default settings, is applied to the layer. Note that 
styles are cumulative. You can apply multiple styles — specifically, one 
style from each library — to a single layer.

457
Book VII 
Chapter 3
Adding Pizzazz with 
Styles and Effects
Editing Layer Styles
	
	 You can also apply styles to type layers, and the type layer doesn’t need 
to be simplified. This is an advantage over Effects because you can 
retain the type’s editability, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4: Styles are advantageous because they don’t alter your pixels.
Editing Layer Styles
Layer styles are quite agreeable. 
They’re not only easy to apply but also 
equally easy to edit. Here’s how:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor in Expert 
mode in the Layers panel, 
double-click the fx icon on 
the layer.
	
	 The Style Settings dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 3-5.
	
2.	 Be sure to select Preview so that 
you can view how your edits are 
affecting the layer style.
	
3.	 Expand the options for any layer 
style category by clicking the 
arrow (referred to as a disclosure 
triangle) just to the left of the 
layer style name.
	
	 You can toggle the layer style on 
and off by selecting and deselect­
ing the style.
	
4.	 Depending on which layer style 
category you use, specify the 
options.
Figure 3-5: Layer styles, such as shadows, are 
live, enabling you to edit them at any time.

458
Editing Layer Styles
	
	 Here’s a rundown:
	
•	 Lighting Angle: Specify the angle of your light source. 
If you’ve decided to put together a realistic composite of multiple 
images, make sure that all the shadows and highlights of all the dif­
ferent elements are consistent. You don’t want one layer to look like 
it’s 6 a.m. and another to look like it’s 2 p.m.
	
•	 Size: Specify the size of your shadow, glow, bevel, or stroke from 0 to 
250 pixels.
	
•	 Distance: Adjust how far the shadow or glow is offset (from 0 to 
30000 pixels) from your element.
	
•	 Opacity: Adjust the Opacity setting to change how transparent the 
shadow, glow, or stroke appears — from 0% to 100%.
	
•	 Glows - Inner/Outer: Specify whether your glow is an inner or outer glow.
	
•	 Color: Click the color swatch and choose a glow color from the Color 
Picker. Click OK to close the Color Picker dialog box.
	
•	 Direction Up/Direction Down: Specify whether the bevel (the raised 
or sunken-in edge) direction is up or down. Direction Up positions 
the highlight along the edge closest to the light source and the 
shadow on the opposite edge. Direction Down does the opposite, 
positioning the shadow near the light source.
	
5.	 After you refine the layer style settings, click OK.
	
	 The layer style is edited and ready to go, as shown in Figure 3-6. Note 
also the options for Reset, to start over, or Cancel, to bail out entirely.

Putting It Together
Adding Photo Effects and Layer Styles to a Collage
If you like your images and text simple and unadorned, more power to you. But if you feel 
a sudden urge to add an embellishment or two, make sure that you’re prepared to do 
that. In this exercise, we show you how to add some type to a collage and apply effects 
and styles to the various elements. Just follow these simple steps:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, 
open a previously created and 
saved collage file.
	
	 Make sure that the Layers panel is 
also open. Our image is a collage 
made up of four images, each 
residing on its own layer — the 
blue background, the butterfly, the 
gardening tools, and the flower/
watering can/sky/grass image. For 
details on creating collages from 
multiple images, see Book VI.
	
2.	 Select the Eyedropper tool from the 
Tools panel and click in the col­
lage on a color you like.
	
	 The color you sampled is now the 
foreground color, as you can see 
from your swatches at the bottom of the Tools panel. We sampled one of the light 
blue clouds.
	
3.	 Select the Type tool and then select a font, style, and point size and other format­
ting options from the Tool Options.
	
	 We recommend choosing an easy-to-read font and applying a bold style to it. We’re 
using Times New Roman Bold, and we set the point size to 30 and the leading to 24 
points.
	
	 We selected the Anti-aliasing option so that our text transitions nicely with the 
image elements.
	
4.	 Click inside the image and type some text.
	
	 We typed Organic Gardening for our garden collage. We also added a second line 
of text with the day and time.

6.	 With the type layer selected in the 
Layers panel, choose Window➪
Effects. In the Effects panel, click 
the Styles icon at the top and 
choose Drop Shadows from the 
library drop-down menu. Double-
click the Low drop shadow.
	
	 If you need to edit the layer style, 
double-click the fx icon in the 
Layers panel and specify settings. 
For details on how to do this, see 
the previous section. We edited the 
drop shadow to make it a little 
smaller, less opaque, and closer to 
the type.
	
7.	 Next, choose Bevels from the 
library drop-down menu. Double-
click the Simple Inner bevel. Make 
any necessary edits to the bevel 
layer style.
	
	 We reduced the size of our bevel to 
make the effect crisper, as shown 
in the figure.
	
8.	 Repeat Step 6 or 7, or both, on any 
other of your layers, if desired.
	
	 We added a Low drop shadow to 
our gardening tools layer.
	
9.	 To add an effect, in the Effects 
panel, click the Effects icon at the 
top, choose Misc Effects from the 
library drop-down menu, and double-click the Soft Flat Color effect.
	
	 We added a Soft Flat Color effect to each of our image layers.

Adding Content from the Graphics Panel
If you aren’t the artistic type or need a quick graphic in a pinch, check out 
the Graphics panel, which shares a space with the Effects panel.
Here’s how to add a graphic from the Graphics panel:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, choose Window➪Graphics, or 
click the Graphics icon in the lower right of the workspace.
	
2.	 In the Graphics panel, shown in Figure 3-7, from the drop-down menu 
at the top of the panel, select the search criteria by category for your 
desired graphic.
	
	 Choices include categories, such as seasons, mood, and activity.
	
10.	 Choose File➪Save.
	
	 You’re all done. If you feel like it, keep adding to or refining the collage as you dis­
cover new tricks.

Adding Effects, Textures, and Frames in Quick Mode
	
3.	 From the drop-down menu just to the right 
of the search categories, select the specific 
season, mood, activity, or other effect.
	
4.	 From the graphics drop-down menu below 
the categories, continue to filter your 
results.
	
	 Choose from Backgrounds, Frames, Graphics, 
Shapes, and Text.
	
5.	 After you select your graphic, double-click 
the graphic thumbnail in the panel or drag 
the thumbnail onto your image window.
	
	 The graphic is added to your image as a 
Smart Object layer, as indicated by the white 
square/black page icon on your layer in the 
Layers panel. Smart Objects are special 
kinds of layers that enable you to repeatedly 
size and transform your layer without the 
fear of degradation. For more on Smart 
Objects, see Book III, Chapter 1.
	
	 To remove the content, simply delete the 
layer.
Adding Effects, Textures, and 
Frames in Quick Mode
	
In the latest version of Elements, Adobe wanted 
to give Quick mode more features in being able 
to transform images, not merely correct them. 
That being said, three new panels were added to 
Quick mode — Effects, Textures, and Frames.
To apply an effect in Quick mode, first click the 
Effects icon in the lower-right corner of the work­
space. In the Effects panel, double-click your 
desired effect or drag it onto your image. One of the great things about the 
Effects panel is the live previews that give you an idea of what the effect will 
look like before you even apply it. After it is applied, if you aren’t happy, 
click the Reset button (the curved arrow) in the upper right of the panel.

Styles and Effects
Adding Effects, Textures, and Frames in Quick Mode
Note that effects are applied as a new layer with a layer mask that can be 
edited in Expert mode. For example, if you applied an effect to a portrait, but 
don’t want the effect to cover the person’s face, you can edit the layer mask 
to hide the effect over the face. For more on editing layer masks, see Book VI, 
Chapter 4. We applied the Vintage effect to our image.
To apply a texture to an image in Quick mode, click the Textures icon in the 
lower-right corner of the workspace. In the Textures panel, click your 
desired texture. After it’s applied, if you aren’t satisfied, click the Reset but­
ton in the upper right of the panel. Like effects, textures are also applied as a 
new layer with a layer mask that can be edited in Expert mode. We applied 
the Old Canvas texture to our photo.
Here’s how to add a frame to an image in Quick mode:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Quick mode, click the Frames icon in the lower 
right of the workspace.
	
2.	 In the Frames panel, shown in Figure 3-8, click your desired frame 
style.
	
	 We chose the Scalloped frame. Elements automatically fits your image 
into the frame the best way possible.
	
3.	 Using the bounding box that appears, drag any handle to size and oth­
erwise transform your image within the frame.
	
	 Note that you can also use the onscreen controls that appear near the 
bounding box. Drag the slider to size your image. Click the Rotate icon 
to rotate your image’s orientation.
	
4.	 After you’re satisfied with the results, click the Commit icon (the 
green check mark) or double-click inside the bounding box.
	
5.	 If you need to further tweak your framed image, go to Expert mode, 
where you will see that your framed image is on its own image layer. 
In addition, the background of the frame is also on its own Fill layer.
	
	 To change the color of your frame’s background (not the frame itself), 
double-click the fill icon on the Fill layer in the Layers panel, as shown in 
Figure 3-8. In the Color dialog box, click your desired color in the Color 
field or enter your desired color formula values and click OK.

Chapter 1: Quick Image Makeovers
In This Chapter
✓	Using one-step auto-fixes
✓	Editing in Quick mode
✓	Cloning realistically
✓	Healing wrinkles, spots, and blemishes
✓	Fixing small flaws
O

ne of Elements’ strongest assets is its ability to fix images quickly, 
painlessly, and effectively. When you work with digital imaging, 
cloning an image with a shadow, adjusting the color or contrast of a photo, 
or eliminating flaws from that otherwise perfect portrait are all fixes that 
you can do successfully, whatever your skill level. With these simple 
image-makeover tools, Elements makes these tasks as easy to perform as 
clicking a button or making a few swipes with a brush.
	
But before you dive into this chapter of fixer-uppers, be sure to size, crop, 
and straighten your image to its final desired dimensions and 
resolution. To find out how, check out Book III, Chapter 2.
Applying One-Step Auto-fixes
Elements has seven automatic lighting-, contrast-, 
and color-correction tools that can quickly improve 
the look of your images with a single menu command. 
These commands are available in either Expert or 
Quick mode, and they’re all on the Enhance menu.
What’s great about these auto-fixes is that they’re 
very easy to use. You don’t need to know a heck of a 
lot about color or contrast to use them. The not-so-good 
news is that the result of these auto-fixes often isn’t as 
good as you could get via a manual color-correction method. 
And sometimes these fixes may even make your image look worse 
than before by giving you strange shifts in color. But, because these 
correctors are quick and easy — and easily undone — they’re worth a try. 
Usually, you don’t want to apply more than one of the auto-fixes. If one 
doesn’t work on your image, just remember that you can undo the fix and 
try another. If you still don’t like the result, move on to one of the manual 
methods that we describe in Chapter 2 of this minibook.

468
Applying One-Step Auto-fixes
Auto Smart Tone
	
This new auto-fix is designed to adjust the tonal values (the range of tones 
or shades from black to white) in your image.
Follow these steps to check out this new command:
	
1.	 In either Expert or Quick mode, with your image open, select 
Enhance➪Auto Smart Tone.
	
	 Elements automatically applies a default correction.
	
2.	 Moving what Adobe refers to as the joystick, the small circle icon, as 
shown in Figure 1-1, fine-tune your correction.
	
	 The thumbnail previews in each corner give you an idea of how the 
image will look when you move the joystick in that particular direction.
The joystick
Figure 1-1: Apply the Auto Smart Tone command to quickly improve an 
image’s tones.
	
3.	 Select the Learn from This Correction check box in the lower left of 
the dialog box to have Elements “learn” from this editing session.

Book VIII 
Chapter 1
Quick Image 
Makeovers
Applying One-Step Auto-fixes
	
	 If you select this option, Elements remembers what corrections you 
made on this image and positions the joystick on the basis of that 
correction on the next image you open and correct. The more images 
that are corrected, the smarter the Auto Smart Tone corrections 
become. This intelligent algorithm is able to distinguish between various 
types (based on the tonal characteristics) of images and remembers the 
adjustment for that particular type of image.
	
	 Click the eye icon to see the before and after of the adjustment 
previews.
	
	 If your adjustments are starting out way out of whack and you feel that 
you need to reset the learning archive, choose Edit➪Preferences➪
General➪Reset Auto Smart Tone Learning (Adobe Photoshop Elements 
Editor➪Preferences➪General➪Reset Auto Smart Tone Learning on 
the Mac).
	
4.	 When you’re satisfied with the adjustment, click OK.
	
	 If you want to start over, click the Reset button.
Auto Smart Fix
This all-in-one command attempts to adjust it all. Auto Smart Fix is designed 
to improve lighting, improve the details in shadow and highlight areas, and 
correct the color balance, as shown in Figure 1-2. The overexposed image on 
the left was improved with the Auto Smart Fix command.
Figure 1-2: Apply the Auto Smart Fix command to quickly improve an image overall.

470
Applying One-Step Auto-fixes
	
The Auto Smart Fix command, as well as the Auto Color, Auto Levels, Auto 
Contrast, Auto Sharpen, and Auto Red Eye Fix commands, are available in 
the Organizer in the panel on the right, where you can apply the commands 
to several selected images simultaneously.
If Auto Smart Fix didn’t quite cut it, you can ramp it up and try Adjust Smart 
Fix. This command is similar to Auto Smart Fix, but it gives you a slider that 
allows you to control the amount of correction applied to the image.
Auto Levels
The Auto Levels command adjusts the overall contrast of an image. This 
command works best on images that have pretty good contrast (detail in the 
shadow, highlight, and midtone areas) to begin with and just need a little 
adjustment, but it can also work wonders for seemingly unsalvageable 
images, as shown in Figure 1-3. Auto Levels works by mapping, or converting, 
the lightest and darkest pixels in your image to white and black, which 
makes highlights appear lighter and shadows appear darker.
Figure 1-3: Auto Levels adjusts the overall contrast of an image.
	
Although Auto Levels can improve your contrast, it may also produce an 
unwanted color cast (a slight trace of color). If a color cast happens, undo 
the command and try the Auto Contrast command instead. If that still 
doesn’t improve the contrast, try the Levels command that we describe in 
Chapter 2 of this minibook.
Auto Contrast
The Auto Contrast command is designed to adjust the overall contrast in an 
image without adjusting its color. This command may not do as good a job 
of improving contrast as the Auto Levels command, but it does a better job 
of retaining the color balance of an image. Auto Contrast usually doesn’t 
cause the strange color casts that can occur when you’re using Auto Levels. 
This command works really well on images with a haze, as shown in Figure 1-4.

471

Chapter 1

Makeovers
Applying One-Step Auto-fixes
Figure 1-4: The Auto Contrast command clears up hazy images.
Auto Color Correction
The Auto Color Correction command adjusts both the color and contrast of 
an image, based on the shadows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the 
image and a default set of values. These values adjust the number of black 
and white pixels that Elements removes from the darkest and lightest areas 
of the image. You usually use this command to remove a color cast or to 
balance the color in your image, as shown in Figure 1-5. Sometimes this 
command can be useful in correcting oversaturated or undersaturated 
colors.
Figure 1-5: Use Auto Color Correction to remove a color cast.
Auto Sharpen
Sometimes photos taken with a digital camera or scanned on a flatbed 
scanner can appear soft, meaning slightly out of focus. Sharpening gives the 
illusion of increased focus by increasing the contrast between pixels. Auto 

472
Applying One-Step Auto-fixes
Sharpen attempts to improve the focus, as shown in Figure 1-6, without 
going too far. What happens when you oversharpen? Your images go from 
soft to grainy and noisy.
Figure 1-6: Use Auto Sharpen to improve focus.
	
Always make sharpening the last fix after you make all other fixes and 
enhancements. You don’t want to sharpen nasty flaws and make them even 
more noticeable than they already are. For more accurate sharpening 
methods, see the Unsharp Mask and Adjust Sharpness features discussed in 
Chapter 2 of this minibook.
Auto Red Eye Fix
The Auto Red Eye Fix command automatically detects and eliminates 
red-eye in an image. Red-eye occurs when a person or an animal (where a 
red-eye can also be a yellow, green, or even blue eye) looks directly into the 
flash.
Many cameras have a red-eye prevention mode, which is a pre-flash that 
causes the subjects’ pupils to contract when the real flash goes off. Other 
cameras mount the flash high or to the side of the lens, which also minimizes 
the chance of red-eye. However, these preventive measures are of little 
solace when you have a great picture that features bright red pupils as its 
dominant feature.

Using the Red Eye Removal tool
If, for some reason, the Auto Red Eye Fix command doesn’t correct the 
problem, you can always try the Red Eye Removal tool in the Tools panel. 
Here’s how to remove red-eye manually:
	
	 1.	 Select the Red Eye Removal tool from the Tools panel in the Photo 
Editor in Expert mode.
	
	 Note that this tool is also available in Quick mode.
	
2.	 Using the default settings, click the red portion of the eye in your 
image.
	
	 This one-click tool darkens the pupil while retaining the tonality and 
texture of the rest of the eye, as shown in Figure 1-7.
Figure 1-7: The Auto Red Eye Fix and the Red Eye Removal tools detect 
and destroy the dreaded red-eye.
	
3.	 If you’re unhappy with the fix, adjust one or both of these options in 
the Tool Options:
	
•	 Pupil Size: Use the slider to increase or decrease the size of the pupil.
	
•	 Darken Pupil: Use the slider to darken or lighten the color of the 
pupil.
	
	 Previously, the Red Eye Removal tool didn’t do a great job with the 
white, green, blue, or yellow eyes that pets can get from the flash. Now, 
however, Elements 12 provides a Pet Eye option. If this new option still 
doesn’t fix the problem, your best bet is to use the Color Replacement 
tool. See the section “Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool,” later 
in this chapter. If all goes well, your image is now cured of the dreaded 
red-eye. (Refer to the image on the right in Figure 1-7.)

474
Editing in Quick Mode
	
You can also use the Brush tool with a Color blend mode and paint away the 
red. Or you can use the Color Replacement tool with a black foreground to 
color away the crimson. If you’re trying to fix green-eye in animals, your best 
bet is to use the Color Replacement tool.
Editing in Quick Mode
If you get the results you want with the auto-fixes we cover in the previous 
sections while working in Quick mode, you may already have all the tools 
you need to repair and enhance your images. This means that you may not 
have to visit Expert mode. Given the ease and flexibility of Quick mode, we 
devote an entire section to it.
As you’ve probably already figured out by now, Quick mode is a pared-down 
version of Expert mode that provides basic image-correcting tools and 
throws in a few dedicated features — such as a before-and-after preview of 
your image — for good measure. To get a general idea of how Quick mode 
works, take a look at the following step-by-step workflow, which shows you 
how you’d put Quick mode to use to fix your photos:
	
1.	 Open a photo.
	
	 You can open a photo in one of three ways from within Elements:
	
•	 In the Organizer, select one or more photos. Click the Photo Editor 
button at the bottom of the workspace and then click the Quick 
button at the top of the workspace.
	
•	 In Expert mode, select your desired image(s) from the Photo Bin. 
Click the Quick button at the top of the workspace.
	
•	 In Expert mode, open your desired images by choosing File➪Open. 
Click the Quick button at the top of the workspace.
	
2.	 Specify your preview preference from the View drop-down menu at 
the top of the workspace.
	
	 You can choose to view just your original image (Before Only), your 
fixed image (After Only), or both images side by side (Before & After) in 
either portrait (Vertical) or landscape (Horizontal) orientation, as 
shown in Figure 1-8.
	
3.	 Use the Zoom and Hand tools to magnify and navigate around your 
image.
	
	 You can also specify the Zoom percentage by using the Zoom slider in 
the Tool Options or in the upper right of the workspace.
	
4.	 Crop your image by using the Crop tool in the Tools panel.
	
5.	 To rotate the image in 90-degree increments, click the Rotate Left or 
Rotate Right button at the bottom of the Image window.

475

Figure 1-8: Quick mode enables you to view before-and-after previews of your image.
	
6.	 Remove the red from your subjects’ eyes.
	
	 Automatically fix red-eye by selecting the Red Eye Removal tool from the 
Tools panel and clicking the Auto Correct button in the Tool Options. If 
that doesn’t work, try clicking the red-eye in your image with the Red 
Eye Removal tool itself.
	
7.	 Apply any necessary auto-fixes, such as Auto Smart Fix, Auto Levels, 
Auto Contrast, and Auto Color Correction.
	
	 All these commands are on the Enhance menu or under Smart Fix, 
Levels, and Color in the right Basic Edit panel of the workspace. Click a 
down-pointing arrow to access the various commands. If the commands 
aren’t visible, click the Basic Edit button in the lower-right corner of the 
workspace.
	
	 Each of these fixes is described in the section “Applying One-Step 
Auto-fixes,” earlier in this chapter.
	
	 Usually one of the fixes is enough. Don’t stack them on top of each 
other. If one doesn’t work, click the Reset button in the upper right of 
the image preview and try another. If you’re not happy, go to Step 8. If 
you are happy, skip to Step 9.
	
8.	 If the auto-fixes don’t quite cut it, gain more control by using the 
sliders, or clicking the thumbnails, that are available for Smart Fix, 
Exposure, Levels, Color, and Balance.

476
Editing in Quick Mode
	
	 Here’s a brief description of each available adjustment:
	
•	 Shadows: When you drag the slider to the right, the darker areas of 
your image lighten without adjusting the highlights.
	
	
	 For all adjustments, you can now hover your cursor over any of the 
thumbnails in the pane to get a dynamic preview of that particular 
adjustment. The slider will automatically move accordingly.
	
•	 Highlights: When you drag the slider to the right, the lighter areas of 
your image darken without adjusting the shadows.
	
•	 Midtones: Adjusts the contrast of the middle (gray) values and leaves 
the highlights and shadows as they are.
	
•	 Exposure: Adjusts the brightness or darkness of an image. Move the 
slider left to darken and right to lighten. The values are in increments 
of F-stops and range from –4 to 4.
	
•	 Saturation: Adjusts the intensity of the colors.
	
•	 Hue: Changes all colors in an image. Make a selection first to change 
the color of just one or more elements. Otherwise, use restraint with 
this adjustment.
	
•	 Vibrance: Adjusts the saturation of an image by increasing the satura­
tion of less saturated colors more than those that are already saturated. 
Tries to minimize clipping (loss of color) as it increases saturation and 
preserves skin tones. Move the slider right to increase saturation. The 
values are in increments of F-stops and range from –1 to 1.
	
•	 Temperature: Adjusts the colors to make them warmer (red) or 
cooler (blue). You can use this adjustment to correct skin tones or to 
correct overly cool images (such as snowy winter photos) or overly 
warm images (such as photos shot at sunset or sunrise).
	
•	 Tint: Adjusts the tint after you adjust temperature to make the color 
more green or magenta.
	
	 If you still don’t get the results you need, move on to one of the more 
manual adjustments that we describe in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
	
	 You can always apply fixes to just selected portions of your image. 
Quick mode offers the Quick Selection tool for your selection tasks. For 
details on using this tool, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
	
9.	 Add final fixes by using the remaining tools in the Tools panel.
	
	 Here’s a quick description of each tool you’ll need from the Tools panel:
	
•	 Whiten Teeth: This digital fix whitens teeth at a fraction of the cost of 
the real analog procedure. Choose an appropriate brush size from 
the Tool Options before whitening. (For more on brush options, see 
Book V, Chapter 1.) Using a brush diameter that’s larger than the 
area of the teeth also whitens or brightens whatever else it 
touches — lips, chin, and so on. Click the Brush Settings option to

specify Hardness, Spacing, Roundness, and Angle of the brush tip. 
Click the teeth. Note that this tool makes a selection and whitens simul­
taneously. After your initial click, your selection option converts 
from New Selection to Add to Selection in the Tool Options. If you 
pick up too much in your dental selection, click the Subtract from 
Selection option and click the area you want to eliminate. When 
you’re happy with the results of your whitening session, choose 
Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D (⌘+D on the Mac).
	
•	 Spot Healing Brush/Healing Brush: These tools are great for fixing 
flaws, both big (Healing Brush) and small (Spot Healing Brush). For a 
detailed explanation on using these tools, see the upcoming sections, 
“Performing Cosmetic Surgery with the Healing Brush Tool” and 
“Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush.”
	
	 You can find these same fixes (and many more) in Expert mode, under 
the Smart Brush and Detail Smart Brush tools. Check out Chapter 2 of 
this minibook for the lowdown on these tools.
	
10.	 You can add any desired text by clicking your image with the Text 
tool. See Book V, Chapter 3, for details on working with text.
	
	 You can now use the Move tool in Quick mode to fine-tune the 
positioning of your text.
	
11.	 Sharpen your image either automatically (by clicking the Auto button 
under Sharpen in the right pane) or manually (by dragging the 
Sharpen slider).
	
	 This fix should always be the last adjustment you make on your image. 
Sharpening increases contrast, so you want to fix the flaws first so that 
you don’t exacerbate them by making them more noticeable.
	
The Quick mode now sports additional panels. Click the Effects icon in the 
lower-right corner of the workspace and you’ll find various new effects, such 
as Cross Process and Lithograph, to apply to your image. Click the Frames 
icon and you can apply borders, such as Scalloped and Aged, to the perimeter 
of your photo. Finally, click the Texture icon to access textures, such as Blue 
Wash and Old Canvas. Click Basic Edit to return to your default panel 
settings.
Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
Say that you want to duplicate an element in your image. That’s easy 
enough, right? Make a selection and copy and paste it into the new location. 
That works fine most of the time. But what if the element has a shadow 
behind it, next to it, above it, or below it? You face the dilemma of having a 
hard edge on the copied element because the shadow (called a cast shadow) 
is cut off by the selection outline. You could feather the selection, but then 
you have to make sure that the copied element blends realistically with the 

478
Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
background. What a pain. The better method is to clone the element by 
using the Clone Stamp tool. It’s quick and easy, and no one will know that 
only one element was there originally.
Believe it or not, you can also reach for this tool when retouching 
imperfections, such as scratches, scars, bruises, date/time stamp imprints 
from cameras, and other minor flaws. In fact, that used to be one of its major 
functions. In some retouching instances, it does a decent job, although the 
arrival of the Healing Brush and Spot Healing tools has relegated the Clone 
Stamp tool more to the pure cloning functions and less to the hard-core 
retouching jobs.
The Clone Stamp tool works by taking sampled pixels from one area and 
cloning (or copying) them onto another area. Follow these steps to clone an 
element without any genetic engineering:
	
	 1.	 Open an image and choose the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools panel 
in Expert mode.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, choose a brush from the Brush Preset drop-down 
panel and then use the brush as is or adjust its size with the Size 
slider.
	
3.	 Select the Blend mode of your choice in the Tool Options.
	
	 Selecting a mode such as Difference, Multiply, or Color can produce 
some interesting special effects. For info on Blend modes, see Book VI, 
Chapter 3.
	
4.	 To make the clone more or less opaque, use the Opacity slider or text 
box in the Tool Options.
	
	 To make your cloned image appear ghosted, use an opacity setting of 
less than 100 percent.
	
5.	 Select or deselect the Aligned option, depending on your preference.
	
	 With Aligned selected, the clone source moves when you move your 
cursor to a different location. If you want to clone multiple times from 
the same location, deselect the Aligned option.
	
6.	 Select or deselect the Sample All Layers option.
	
	 This option enables you to sample pixels from all visible layers for the 
clone. If this option is deselected, the Clone Stamp tool clones from only 
the active layer. Check out Book VI for details about working with layers.
	
7.	 Optionally, click the Clone Overlay button.
	
	 Select the Show Overlay option, if desired. Applying an overlay can be 
useful when cloning subjects that need to be in alignment with the 
underlying image. Adjust the Opacity to your desired percentage. Select 
Clipped to have the overlay clipped, or contained, only within the 
boundaries of your brush. In our opinion, this makes it a lot easier to

clone exactly what you want. Select the Auto-Hide option, which, when 
you release your mouse button, will display a ghosted preview of how 
your cloned pixels will appear on the image. While you’re painting, 
however, the overlay will be hidden. Select Invert Overlay to reverse the 
colors and tones in your overlay. This setting can also assist you in 
aligning areas.
	
8.	 Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the area of your image that you 
want to clone to define the source of the clone.
	
9.	 Click or drag along the area where you want the clone to appear, as 
shown in Figure 1-9.

Figure 1-9: When using the Clone Stamp tool, drag along the area 
where you want the clone to appear.
	
	 While you drag, Elements displays a crosshair cursor along with the Clone 
Stamp cursor. The crosshair represents the source you’re cloning from, 
and the Clone Stamp cursor shows where the clone is being applied. 
While you move the mouse, the crosshair moves as well. This provides a 
continuous reference to the area of your image that you’re cloning. Keep 
an eye on the crosshair, or you may clone something you don’t want.
	
	 When you successfully complete the cloning process, you have two 
identical objects.
	
	 If you’re cloning an element, try to clone it without lifting your mouse. 
Also, when you’re retouching a flaw, try not to overdo it. Clicking once 
or twice on each flaw is usually plenty. If you’re heavy-handed with the 
Clone Stamp, you get a blotchy effect that’s a telltale sign something has 
been retouched.
	
10.	 Save the image and close it.

Performing Cosmetic Surgery with  the Healing Brush Tool
Here are a few additional tidbits regarding the Clone Stamp tool:
	
✓	Use the Clone Stamp tool to fix simple flaws. To clean up a flaw that’s 
pretty straight, such as a stray hair or scratch, Alt-click (Option-click on 
the Mac) with the tool to define the source. Then click at one end of the 
straight flaw and Shift-click at the other end. The cloned source pixels 
cover up the flaw.
	
✓	Pay attention to the origin point for sampling. Depending on what 
you’re cloning (for example, when covering up a flaw), if you keep 
sampling from the same point without ever varying it, the area you’re 
cloning starts to look like ugly shag carpeting. Or, at best, it starts to 
appear blotchy and over-retouched.
	
✓	Zoom out once in a while to check how your image looks overall. 
Doing so helps you avoid those funky clone-stamp repetitive patterns 
and blotches.
Performing Cosmetic Surgery with 
the Healing Brush Tool
The Healing Brush tool is similar to the Clone Stamp tool (see the preceding 
section). Both tools let you clone pixels from one area and apply them to 
another area. But that’s where the similarities end, and the Healing Brush 
leaves the Clone Stamp tool in the dust.
The problem with the Clone Stamp tool is that it doesn’t take the tonality of 
the flawed area — the shadows, midtones, and highlights — into consideration. 
So, if the pixels you’re sampling from aren’t shaded and lit exactly like the 
ones you’re covering, you have a mismatch in color, which makes seamless 
and indecipherable repairs hard to achieve.
That’s where the Healing Brush tool comes in. This very intelligent tool 
clones by using the texture from the sampled area (the source) and then 
using the colors around the brush stroke when you paint over the flawed 
area (the destination). The highlights, midtones, and shadows remain intact, 
and the result of the repair is more realistic and natural — not blotchy, 
miscolored, and screaming “retouched.”

	 Our guy, shown in Figure 1-10, 
looks like he could stand to get 
some “work done,” as they say in 
Hollywood. Note that you can also 
heal between two images. Just 
make sure that they have the same 
color mode — for example, both 
RGB (red, green, blue).
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, specify a size 
for the Healing Brush tool.
	
	 Click the Brush Settings button to 
select your desired diameter and 
hardness, as well as spacing, angle, 
and roundness if you want, for 
your brush tip. You’ll most likely 
specify your brush settings several 
times while retouching your image. 
Using the appropriate brush size 
for the flaw you’re repairing is 
important.
	
3.	 Choose your desired Blend mode.
	
	 You can change your Blend mode, 
if necessary. The Replace mode preserves textures, such as noise or film 
grain, around the edges of your strokes when you’re using a soft brush. 
For most simple retouching jobs, such as this one, you can leave it set at 
Normal.
	
4.	 Choose one of these Source options:
	
	 You have a choice between Sampled and Pattern:
	
•	 Sampled: Uses the pixels from the image. You’ll probably use this 
option 99.9 percent of the time.
	
•	 Pattern: Uses pixels from a pattern that you select from the Pattern 
Picker drop-down panel.
	
	 For our example, we’re sticking with Sampled because we don’t think 
our guy would look that good with a Tie-Dye pattern across his face.
	
5.	 Select or deselect the Aligned option in the Tool Options.
	
	 For most retouching tasks, you probably should leave Aligned selected. 
Here are the details on each option:
	
•	 With Aligned selected: When you click or drag with the Healing Brush, 
Elements displays a crosshair along with the Healing Brush cursor. 
The crosshair represents the sampling point, also known as the

source. When you move the Healing Brush tool, the crosshair also 
moves, providing a constant reference to the area you’re sampling. 
(We left the Aligned option selected in our example.)
	
•	 With Aligned deselected: Elements applies the source pixels from 
your initial sampling point, no matter how many times you stop and 
start dragging.
	
6.	 Select the Sample All Layers option to heal an image by using all 
visible layers.
	
	 If this option is deselected, you heal from only the active layer.
	
	 To ensure maximum editing flexibility later, select the Sample All Layers 
option and add a new, blank layer above the image you want to heal. 
When you heal the image, the pixels appear on the new layer and not on 
the image itself. You can then adjust opacity, adjust Blend modes, and 
make other tweaks to the “healed” pixels.
	
7.	 Optionally, click the Clone Overlay button.
	
	 For details on all the Clone Overlay 
options, see the preceding section.
	
8.	 Establish the sampling point by 
Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on 
the Mac).
	
	 Make sure to click the area of your 
image you want to clone from.
	
	 In our example, we clicked the 
smooth area on the cheek and 
portions of the forehead.
	
9.	 Release the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key and click or drag over a 
flawed area of your image.
	
	 Pay attention to where the cross­
hair is located because that’s the 
area you’re healing from. We 
brushed over the wrinkles under 
and around the eyes and on the 
forehead. This guy never looked so 
good, as shown in Figure 1-11, and 
he experienced absolutely no 
recovery time.

Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
Whereas the Healing Brush is designed to fix larger flawed areas, the Spot 
Healing Brush is designed for smaller blemishes and little imperfections, 
with the exception of the Content-Aware option, which we explain in a 
moment. The biggest difference between the Healing Brush and the Spot 
Healing Brush is that the Spot Healing Brush doesn’t require you to specify a 
sampling source. It automatically takes a sample from around the area to be 
retouched. The good news is that it’s quick and easy. The downside is that it 
doesn’t give you as much control over the sampling source. Consequently, 
reserve this tool for small and simple flaws.
Follow these steps to quickly fix imperfections with the Spot Healing Brush 
tool:
	
	 1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open your image and grab the 
Spot Healing Brush tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 The diamond nose earring on this lovely hip senior, as shown in Figure 1-12 
on the left, is no match for the power of the Spot Healing Brush.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, click the Brush Presets Picker and select a brush 
tip. Adjust the size as needed with the Size slider.
	
	 Try to select a brush that’s a little larger than the flawed area you want 
to fix.
	
3.	 Select a Blend mode in the Tool Options.
	
	 Just as with the Healing Brush, you can select the Replace mode. Most 
likely, the Normal mode works the best.

4.	 Select a type in the Tool Options:
	
•	 Proximity Match: Samples the pixels around the edge of the selection 
to fix the flawed area.
	
•	 Create Texture: Uses all the pixels in the selection to create a texture 
to fix the flaw.
	
•	 Content-Aware: If you want to eliminate something larger or more 
substantial than a nose ring, mole, or freckle, this is the option to 
use. This option takes actual content from the image and uses it as a 
kind of patch for the flawed area. You can delete large objects with 
the Content-Aware option, as shown in Figure 1-13, where we elimi­
nated the twenty-first-century signs from the front of the seventeenth-
century barn.
	
	
	 You may have to paint over the offending object a couple times to 
get your desired result. Also keep in mind that you may need to do 
some touching up with the Clone Stamp or other healing tools. Ours 
is a little smudgy in parts and could use a bit of touching up.
	
	 Try Proximity Match first, and if it doesn’t work, undo and try Create 
Texture or Content-Aware.

Repositioning with the Content-Aware Move Tool
Repositioning with the Content-Aware Move Tool
	
The new Content-Aware Move tool allows you to select and move a portion 
of an image. What’s great is that when you move that portion, the hole left 
behind is miraculously filled using content-aware technology. In other 
words, Elements analyzes the area surrounding the selected portion you’re 
moving and then fills the “hole” with matched content.
Here’s how to use this new editing tool:
	
1.	 In Expert mode, open your image and select the Content-Aware Move 
tool.
	
	 It’s the tool that looks like two arrows. You can also press the Q key.
	
2.	 Choose your Mode, either Move or Extend.
	
	 When you choose Move, Elements moves your selection to a new loca­
tion and then fills in the remaining “hole” with content-aware pixels. The 
Move mode works well when you need to move an object, or objects, in 
your image for a more desirable composition. Keep in mind that this 
technique works best when the background of the new location of the 
object is similar to that from which it was extracted.
	
	 When you choose Extend, 
Elements attempts to extend 
your selected area, while 
maintaining any lines and 
structural elements and 
blending them into the existing 
object. This option works great 
for expanding or contracting 
objects such as hair, fur, trees, 
buildings, and so on.
	
	 For my example, I chose the 
Move mode because I wanted to 
bring my yogis closer together, 
as shown in Figure 1-14.
	
3.	 Choose your desired Healing setting.
	
	 Healing controls the amount of flexibility that Elements uses in determining 
how to shift pixels around and how strictly regions are preserved when 
determining the content-aware fill. The default setting is smack dab in 
the middle, which is what we stuck with.
	
	 You can also choose Sample All Layers to use content from all your 
layers. If you leave this check box deselected, you will only use content 
from the active layer.
	
4.	 Drag around the area of your image that you want to move or extend.

Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool
	
	 If you need to fine-tune your 
selection, you can use the 
Path Operations options on 
the Options bar. Or, you can 
press the Shift key to add to 
your selected area or press 
Alt (Option on the Mac) to 
delete from your selection.
	
5.	 Move your selection to your 
desired location, as shown 
in Figure 1-15.
	
6.	 Touch up any areas that 
require it.
	
	 You can break out any of the 
healing tools or the Clone 
Stamp tool to fix any mismatches or remaining flaws.
Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool
The Color Replacement tool allows you to replace the original color of an 
image with the foreground color. You can use this tool in a variety of ways. 
Create the look of a hand-painted photo by colorizing a grayscale image. Or 
maybe you just want to change the color of an object or two, such as a 
couple of flowers in a bouquet. And even though Elements has a bona fide 
Red Eye tool, you can also use the Color Replacement tool to eliminate 
red- (or yellow- or green-) eye in people and animals.
	
The great thing about the Color Replacement tool is that, like the other 
healing tools, it completely preserves the tonality of the image. The color 
that you apply doesn’t obliterate the midtones, shadows, and highlights as it 
would if you were applying color with the regular Brush tool. The Color 
Replacement tool works by first sampling the original colors in the image 
and then replacing those colors with the foreground color. By specifying 
different sampling methods, limits, and tolerance settings, you can control 
the range of colors that Elements replaces.
Follow these steps to replace existing color with your foreground color:
	
	 1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open your image and select the 
Color Replacement tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also press the B key to cycle through all the Brush tools.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, select your desired brush tip from the Brush 
Preset Picker drop-down panel and further adjust your brush size as 
needed.

3.	 Adjust the hardness, spacing, roundness, and angle under Brush 
Settings.
	
4.	 In the Tool Options, select your desired Blend mode:
	
•	 Color: This default mode works well for most colorizing jobs. Use this 
mode if you’re trying to get rid of red-eye.
	
•	 Hue: This mode is similar to color, but less intense, providing a 
subtler effect.
	
•	 Saturation: This mode is the one to use to convert the color in your 
image to grayscale. Set your foreground color to Black in the Tools 
panel.
	
•	 Luminosity: This mode is the opposite of the Color mode. Although 
this Blend mode can create a beautiful effect between two image 
layers, it doesn’t tend to provide that great an effect in other 
circumstances.
	
5.	 Select your sampling Limits mode:
	
•	 Contiguous: The default setting replaces the color of pixels containing 
the sampled color that are adjacent to each other directly under the 
brush.
	
•	 Discontiguous: Replaces the color of the pixels containing the 
sampled color wherever it occurs under your brush.
	
6.	 Specify your Tolerance percentage.
	
	 Tolerance refers to a range of color. A high tolerance lets you replace a 
broad range of color. A low tolerance limits the replacement of color to 
only the areas that are very similar to the sampled color.
	
7.	 Choose whether you want 
anti-aliasing.
	
	 Remember, anti-aliasing slightly 
softens and smoothes the edge 
of the sampled areas.
	
8.	 After you establish your 
settings, click or drag in your 
image.
	
	 Notice how the color, which in 
our example is purple, replaces 
the original colors of the 
sampled areas, which is dark 
pink (see Figure 1-16). Of 
course, the exact effect you get 
depends on your settings.

Lightening and Darkening with  Dodge and Burn Tools
	
If you want to be more accurate, make a selection before you replace your 
color so that you can avoid coloring elements that you don’t want to color.
Lightening and Darkening with 
Dodge and Burn Tools
Dodging and burning originated in the darkroom, where photographers 
would salvage negatives containing areas that were too dark or too light by 
adding or subtracting exposure as an enlarger made the prints.
An enlarger makes a print by projecting an image of a negative onto a piece 
of photosensitive paper. During the exposure, the darkroom technician can 
reduce the amount of light falling onto the paper by placing some object 
(often a disk shape of cardboard or metal impaled on a piece of wire) in the 
light path to dodge part of the image. The worker can burn other parts of an 
image by exposing only a small portion through an opening, such as the 
fingers in a cupped pair of hands or a piece of cardboard with a hole. The 
Dodge and Burn tools in Elements adopt their icons from those analog tools 
used in the darkroom.
However, the digital counterparts are a great deal more flexible and precise. 
For example, the worker in a darkroom varies the size of the dodging or 
burning tool by moving it up or down in the light path. Unfortunately, the 
closer the real-world tool gets to the paper, the sharper it appears, forcing 
the darkroom worker to move the tool more rapidly and frequently to blur 
the edges of the effects. With the Elements Dodge and Burn tools, you can 
specify the size of the tool and its softness by selecting one of the many 
brush tips available.
You can also limit the correction to a specific tonal range in your image — 
shadows, midtones, or highlights. You can adjust the degree of lightening 
and darkening applied by specifying an exposure percentage, too.
	
The Dodge (used to lighten) and Burn (used to darken) tools can be very 
effective, but you can’t add detail that isn’t there. Keep the following in 
mind:
	
✓	When you lighten very dark shadows that contain little detail, you end 
up with grayish shadows.
	
✓	Darkening very light areas that are completely washed out doesn’t make 
your image look very good, either. You’ll end up with white patches.
In either case, you want to use the Dodge and Burn tools in moderation and 
work only with small areas. To dodge or burn a portion of an image, just 
follow these steps:

Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools 
	
	 1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open an image with underexposed 
or overexposed areas and select the Dodge or Burn tool from the 
Tools panel.
	
	
	 Press the O key to cycle among the Dodge, Burn, and Sponge tools. 
(See the next section for details.)
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, select a brush from the Brush Presets Picker 
drop-down panel and also adjust the brush size, if necessary.
	
	 Larger, softer brushes spread the dodging-and-burning effect over a 
larger area, making blending with the surrounding area easier, creating a 
more realistic, natural appearance.
	
3.	 In the Tool Options, under the Range drop-down menu, select 
Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights.
	
	 Select Shadows to lighten or darken detail in the darker areas of your 
image. Choose Midtones to adjust the tones of average darkness. And 
select Highlights to make the brightest areas even lighter or darker.
	
	 In Figure 1-17, the original image had mostly dark areas, so we dodged 
the shadows. Note the increased detail in the eyes, teeth, and hair. We 
also gave a couple swipes to the highlight areas with the Burn tool.
Figure 1-17: The Dodge and Burn tools are effective when touching up 
smaller dark and light areas.
	
4.	 In the Tool Options, select the amount of correction you want to apply 
with each stroke by using the Exposure slider or text box.
	
	 Exposure is similar to the Opacity setting that you use with the regular 
Brush tool. Start with a lower percentage to better control the amount 
of darkening or lightening. High exposure values can overcorrect and 
produce unnatural-looking, obviously dodged or burned areas in your 
images. (We used a setting of 10 percent.)

490
Turning Color Up or Down with the Sponge Tool
	
5.	 Drag or “paint” over the areas that you want to lighten or darken, 
gradually building up the desired effect.
	
	 You can make a selection prior to your dragging to make certain that the 
adjustment is applied only to that specific area.
	
6.	 If you go too far, press Ctrl+Z (⌘+Z on the Mac) to reverse your most 
recent stroke.
	
7.	 When you finish, choose File➪Save to store the image.
Turning Color Up or Down with the Sponge Tool
The Sponge tool soaks up or squeezes out color. It can reduce the richness 
or intensity (or saturation) of a color in applied areas. It can also perform 
the reverse, giving a specific area richer, more vibrant colors.
Surprisingly, the Sponge tool also works in grayscale mode by darkening or 
lightening the pixels. Unlike the Hue/Saturation command (under 
Enhance➪Adjust Color), which works only on layers or selections, you can 
use the Sponge tool on any area that you can paint with a brush.
You can use the Sponge tool on an image in subtle ways to reduce the 
saturation in selected areas for an interesting effect. For example, you may 
have an object that’s the center of attention in your picture simply because 
the colors are very bright. The Sponge tool lets you reduce the color 
saturation of that area (and only that area) to allow another section of your 
image to become the focal point. You can also use the Sponge tool to make 
an artistic statement: You could reduce or increase the saturation of a single 
person in a group shot to give that person more attention (perhaps as being 
more colorful than the rest).
To use the Sponge tool, just follow these steps:
	
	 1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open an image and select the 
Sponge tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 Press the O key to cycle among the Dodge, Burn, and Sponge tools.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, select a brush from the Brush Preset Picker 
drop-down panel and further adjust the size of the brush tip, if 
needed.
	
	 Use large, soft brushes to saturate/desaturate a larger area. Smaller 
brushes are useful mostly to change the saturation of a specific small 
object in an image.
	
3.	 In the Tool Options, select either Desaturate (reduce saturation) or 
Saturate (increase saturation) from the Mode drop-down menu.

Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
The Smudge tool performs a kind of warping effect by pushing your pixels 
around as if they consisted of wet paint, using the color that’s under the 
cursor when you start to stroke. However, don’t view the Smudge tool as a 
simple distortion tool that produces only comical effects. We use it on tiny 
areas of an image to soften the edges of objects in a way that often looks 
more natural than when we use the Blur tool. You can also use the Smudge 
tool to create a soft, almost-painted look, as shown in Figure 1-19. Just don’t 
get too carried away, or you may obliterate detail that you want to preserve.
	
Smudged areas may be obvious because of their smooth appearance. Adding 
a little texture by using the Noise filter after you smudge is often a good idea 
if you want to blend a smudged section in with its surroundings. You can 
find tips on applying the Noise filter in Book VII, Chapter 1.

Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
To apply the Smudge tool, just 
follow these steps:
	
	 1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert 
mode, open the image and 
select the Smudge tool from the 
Tools panel.
	
	 Press R to cycle through the 
Smudge, Blur, and Sharpen 
tools.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, select a 
brush from the Brush Preset 
Picker drop-down panel and 
use the Size slider to specify 
your desired brush diameter.
	
	 Use a small brush for smudging 
tiny areas, such as edges. Larger 
brushes produce drastic effects, 
so use them with care.
	
3.	 In the Tool Options, select a 
blending mode from the Mode 
drop-down menu.
	
4.	 In the Tool Options, select the 
strength of the smudging effect 
with the Strength slider or 
text box.
	
	 Low values produce a lighter effect; high values really push your pixels 
around.
	
5.	 If your image has multiple layers, select the Sample All Layers option 
to make Elements use pixels from all visible layers when it produces 
the effect.
	
	 The smudge still appears only on the active layer, but the look is a bit 
different depending on the contents of the underlying layers.
	
6.	 Use the Finger Painting option to begin the smudge by using the

	 You can create interesting effects with this option. Rather than using the 
color under your cursor, this option smears your foreground color at 
the start of each stroke.

by holding down the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) while you drag. 
Release Alt (Option) to go back to Normal mode.

your image. If you don’t like the results, press Ctrl+Z (⌘+Z on the Mac) 
to undo the changes and then lower the Strength percentage (discussed 
in Step 4) even more.
	
	 This tool can be a little destructive. If you’re looking to preserve reality, 
use it with restraint. If you want to get wild, go crazy.
	
8.	 When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
Softening with the Blur Tool
The Blur tool can repair an image, or you can use it for more creative tasks. 
Adding a little blur here and there can save an image with a few defects. 
Blurring can also be used for artistic effect — say, to add a little motion to a 
soccer ball frozen in time by a too-fast shutter speed. You can also blur 
portions of your image to emphasize and focus on a particular element, as 
shown in Figure 1-20, where we blurred the classroom background a bit to 
draw attention to the teacher and students. The Blur tool makes it easy to 
paint your blur effects exactly where you want them. This tool works by 
decreasing the contrast among adjacent pixels in the painted area.

Figure 1-20: Use the Blur tool to soften a rough edge or emphasize a 
focal point.
The mechanics of using the Blur tool and several of its options are similar to 
those of the Smudge tool. Just follow these steps:
	
	 1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open an image and select the 
Blur tool from the Tools panel.

494
Focusing with the Sharpen Tool
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, select a brush from the Brushes Presets 
drop-down panel.
	
	 Use a small brush for applying small areas of blur.
	
	 Use larger brushes with caution. For example, if your goal is to blur the 
entire background to make a foreground object appear sharper in 
comparison, it’s better to make a selection and apply the Blur filter, as 
described in Book VII, Chapter 1.
	
3.	 In the Tool Options, select a blending mode from the Mode drop-down 
menu.
	
4.	 In the Tool Options, select the strength of the blurring effect with the 
Strength slider or text box.
	
5.	 If your image has multiple layers, select the Sample All Layers option 
to make Elements use pixels from all visible layers when it produces 
the effect.
	
	 Selecting this option can produce a smoother blur when you merge the 
layers later. See Book VI for more info on layers.
	
6.	 Paint over the areas you want to blur.
	
7.	 When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
Focusing with the Sharpen Tool
In theory, the Sharpen tool is nothing more than the Blur tool in reverse — 
instead of decreasing contrast among pixels, the Sharpen tool increases the 
contrast. In practice, however, use this tool with a bit more care than the 
Blur tool. Whereas blurred areas tend to fade from a viewer’s notice (at 
least, in terms of how his or her eyes perceive them), sharpened areas of an 
image jump out at people. Even a small area that’s been oversharpened can 
quickly lead to overly grainy and noisy images.
You can often successfully sharpen small areas with the Sharpen tool. 
Sometimes, the eyes in a portrait can benefit from a little sharpening, as 
shown in Figure 1-21. Or you may want to sharpen an area to make it stand 
out more distinctly against a slightly blurred background.
Follow these simple steps to use the Sharpen tool:
	
	 1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open an image and select the 
Sharpen tool from the Tools panel.

495

2.	 In the Tool Options, select a 
brush from the Brushes Presets 
drop-down panel.
	
	 Use a small brush for applying 
small areas of sharpening.
	
3.	 In the Tool Options, select a 
blending mode from the Mode 
drop-down menu.
	
4.	 In the Tool Options, select the 
strength of the sharpening 
effect with the Strength slider 
or text box.
	
	 Using a fairly low value (say, 25 
percent or less) is a good idea 
because you can build up 
sharpness slowly, being careful 
not to overdo it.
	
	 You know you’ve gone too far 
with the sharpness when the 
pixels start to look noisy and 
grainy.
	
5.	 If your image has multiple 
layers, select the Sample All Layers option to make Elements use 
pixels from all visible layers when it produces the effect.
	
6.	 Select the Protect Detail option to enhance the details in the image 
and minimize artifacts.
	
	 If you leave this option deselected, your sharpening is more 
pronounced.
	
7.	 Paint over the areas you want to sharpen.
	
8.	 When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
	
Sharpening increases contrast, so be careful when using the Sharpen tool if 
you plan to also adjust the Levels or Curves controls. Any change that 
increases contrast in the whole image also boosts the contrast of an area 
you’ve sharpened.
	
The Unsharp Mask and Smart Sharpen filters offer more options and better 
overall control, so unless you really need to use the sharpening effect, you’re 
usually better off using a filter. (Book VII, Chapter 1, has more on filters in 
general.)

Putting It Together
Fixing a Photo
Unless you’re a highly skilled photographer, you probably have a few photos that require 
a number of digital fixes. Certainly, we both do. Although it may seem like fixing them 
is too much trouble or will take too long, you’ll find how easy it is after you practice the 
techniques a few times. After a while, you may even get into the habit of running through 
your personal quick-editing workflow before you organize and archive your images in 
the Organizer. If you have more time to burn, you can also add a few artistic touches to 
further enhance those shots. That way, when you get the urge to share those photos, 
they’re just an e-mail or print away.
Note that most of the details for executing these steps are described in this chapter. 
When they aren’t, we give you the book and chapter where you can find further explanations. 
If these steps are too tedious for you, you can always follow the Quick mode route we 
describe earlier, in the section “Editing in Quick Mode.”
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, open any image in need of repair.
	
	 The image of our two girls is in 
pretty bad shape — horrible 
contrast, bad color cast, soft focus, 
and in need of some healing, as 
shown in the figure.
	
2.	 If you need to rotate the image, 
choose Image➪Rotate and select 
a rotation amount.
	
3.	 Crop the image using the Crop tool 
in the Tools panel.
	
4.	 To allow for maximum flexibility in 
editing, convert your background 
to a layer by double-clicking 
Background in the Layers panel; 
click OK in the New Layer 
dialog box.
	
	 For details on working with layers, see Book VI.
	
5.	 Adjust the contrast of your image, if needed.
	
	 Try choosing Enhance➪Auto Contrast. If that doesn’t work well, undo it by pressing 
Ctrl+Z (⌘+Z on the Mac) and choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/
Highlights or Levels.

497

Focusing with the Sharpen Tool
	
	 Make sure that you have good 
tones in the shadows (dark areas), 
midtones (middle-toned areas), and 
highlights (light areas). Also ensure 
that you can see details in all the 
tonal ranges, as shown in the 
figure. For details on using the 
Shadows/Highlights and Levels 
commands, see Chapter 2 of this 
minibook. For our girls, we broke 
out the big guns — Levels.
	
6.	 Adjust the color of your image, if 
needed. If you didn’t use an auto-
fix in Step 5, you can try the Auto 
Color command on the Enhance 
submenu. Or choose Enhance➪
Adjust Color and select one of the 
color-adjustment commands described in Chapter 2 of this minibook.
	
	 If you need to adjust the skin tones of your people, you can try the Adjust Color for 
Skin Tone command. We recommend using the Adjust Color Curves command for 
overall color adjustment, as we did for our girls in the figure. Usually working with 
this curve will do the trick, no matter what your color issues are.
	
	 Note that you can fix just selected 
portions of your image. Make a 
selection first and then apply the 
adjustment. For details on making 
selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
	
7.	 If you have any people or animals 
with nasty red-eye, use the Red 
Eye Removal or Color Replacement 
tool.
	
	 Remember to use the Zoom and 
Hand tools to magnify and navigate 
around your image, as needed.
	
8.	 If you need to whiten the teeth of 
any of your people, click Quick at 
the top of the workspace and use 
the Whiten Teeth tool in the Tools 
panel.

	 Although our girls have pretty white teeth, we gave a swipe or two with the Whiten 
Teeth tool.
	
	 Click Expert at the top of the workspace to return to Expert mode.
	
9.	 Perform any additional repair or healing tasks by using the Healing Brush, Spot 
Healing Brush, and Clone Stamp tools.
	
	 Our girls are quite gorgeous as they are, but we broke out the Spot Healing Brush 
and got rid of a mole and blemish here and there.
	
10.	 Sharpen your image.
	
	 You can return to Quick mode and 
either click the Auto button or drag 
the Sharpen slider under Sharpen 
in the right pane. Or, for more pre­
cise control, in Expert mode, 
choose Enhance➪Adjust Sharpness, 
as described in Chapter 2 of this 
minibook.
	
	 This fix should always be the last 
adjustment you make on your 
image. You want to make sure that 
all your contrast, color, and flaws 
are fixed before sharpening. The 
reason is that the sharpening pro­
cess increases contrast, so you 
don’t want to exacerbate any prob­
lems that may exist. Our “fixed” 
girls are shown in the final figure.

f you’ve tried the quick automatic fixes on your photos but they didn’t 
correct the photos to your satisfaction, this chapter should be of some 
help. Fortunately, Elements offers multiple ways and multiple levels of 
correcting and enhancing your images. If an auto-fix doesn’t work, elevate to 
a manual fix. Chances are good that if you can’t find the tools to correct and 
repair your images in Elements, those images are probably beyond 
salvaging.
Correcting Your Images the Logical Way
	
Using this chapter and the information provided in Chapter 1 
of this minibook as your jumping-off points, try to 
employ some kind of logical workflow when you tackle 
the correction and repair of your images. Personally, 
we’re partial to the following series of steps:
	
1.	 Crop, straighten, and resize your images, if 
necessary.
	
2.	 When you have the images in their proper 
physical state, correct the lighting and 
establish good tonal range for your shadows, 
highlights, and midtones to display the greatest 
detail possible.
	
	 Often, just correcting the lighting solves minor color 
problems. If not, move on to adjusting the color balance.
	
3.	 Eliminate any color casts and adjust the saturation, if necessary.
	
4.	 Grab the retouching tools, such as the healing tools and filters, to 
retouch any flaws.

500
Understanding the Histogram Panel
	
5.	 Apply any desired enhancements or special effects.
	
6.	 Sharpen your image if you feel that it could use a boost in clarity and 
sharpness.
By following these steps, in this order, you should be able to get all your 
images in shape to print, post, and share with family and friends.
Understanding the Histogram Panel
One of the first things you want to do before you make any color or tonal 
adjustments to your image is to take a good look at the quality and 
distribution of the tones throughout your image. We don’t mean just 
eyeballing the composite image on your screen. We’re talking about getting 
inside your image and looking at its guts with the Histogram panel — and 
keeping it onscreen so that you can see its constant feedback on your image 
adjustments.
A histogram displays the tonal 
range of an image, as shown in 
Figure 2-1. It shows how the pixels 
are distributed by graphing the 
number of pixels at each of the 
256 brightness levels in an image. 
On this graph, pixels with the same 
brightness level are stacked in bars 
along a vertical axis. The higher the 
line from this axis, the greater the 
number of pixels at that brightness 
level. You can view the distribution 
for the entire image, a selected 
layer, or an adjustment composite 
(described in Step 2 of the preced­
ing list).
	
From this graph, you can determine 
whether the image contains enough 
detail in the shadow, midtone, and highlight areas. This information helps 
you determine what image adjustments you may need to make. The following 
steps walk you through the basics of using the panel and understanding the 
information you find there:
	
1.	 Choose Window➪Histogram to bring up the panel.
	
2.	 Select your desired source of the histogram’s display from the Source 
drop-down menu:
Figure 2-1: The Histogram panel displays 
how pixels are distributed at each of the 256 
brightness levels.

Understanding the Histogram Panel
	
•	 Entire Image: Displays a histogram of the entire image.
	
•	 Selected Layer: Displays a histogram of just the selected layers in the 
Layers panel.
	
•	 Adjustment Composite: Displays a histogram of a selected adjustment 
layer and all the layers below it.
	
3.	 Select an option to view isolated portions of your image by choosing 
an option from the Channel drop-down menu:
	
•	 RGB: Displays a composite image of all color channels — red, green, 
and blue.
	
•	 Red, Green and Blue: Displays the histogram of each individual color 
channel.
	
•	 Luminosity: Displays the luminance, or intensity, of the RGB 
composite image.
	
•	 Colors: Displays the composite RGB histogram by color. Red, green, 
and blue represent the pixels in each of those channels. Gray 
represents the area where all three channels overlap.
	
4.	 Examine the tonal range in the histogram.
	
	 An image with good tonal range displays pixels in all areas. An image 
with poor tonal range has gaps or slopes that lean heavily toward the 
right or left sides in the histogram, as shown in Figure 2-2.
	
	 The rest of this chapter explains ways that you can correct contrast and 
color problems that you find.
	
5.	 (Optional) If you’re into numbers, check the statistics to evaluate your 
image:
	
	 Drag your cursor within the histogram to see the statistics about a range 
of values. Or position the cursor within a specific area of the histogram 
that interests you.
	
	 Some statistics, such as Standard Deviation, may be for those who live 
in the mathematical land of statistics. But you may discover useful infor­
mation from the other statistics that can help you in your image-adjusting 
tasks. Here’s a brief explanation of each statistic:
	
•	 Mean: The average intensity value.
	
•	 Standard Deviation: How much the intensity values vary from the mean.
	
•	 Median: The middle value of the intensity value range. More specifi­
cally, the value that has as many values less than it has greater.
	
•	 Pixels: The total number of pixels used to represent the histogram.
	
•	 Level: The intensity level.

502
Understanding the Histogram Panel
	
•	 Count: The total number of pixels corresponding to that intensity level.
	
•	 Percentile: The number of cumulative pixels (in percentages) at or 
below that level, from 0% (left) to 100% (right).
	
•	 Cache Level: The current level of image cache used to calculate the 
histogram. For more info on cache, see Book I, Chapter 4.

Adjusting Lighting
Adjusting Lighting
Elements has several simple, manual tools you can use to fix lighting if the 
Auto tools (see Chapter 1 of this minibook) don’t cut the mustard. The 
manual tools offer more control for adjusting overall contrast, as well as 
bringing out details in shadow, midtones, and highlight areas of your images. 
You can find all lighting adjustments in both Expert and Quick modes.
Fixing lighting with Shadows/Highlights
The Shadows/Highlights command offers a quick-and-easy method of 
correcting overexposed and underexposed areas. This feature works 
especially well with images shot in bright, overhead light or in light coming 
from the back (backlit). These images usually suffer from having the subject 
partially or completely surrounded in shadows, such as the original image 
(left) in Figure 2-3.
After Adjusted with Shadows/

Before
Figure 2-3: Correct the lighting in your images with the 
Shadows/Highlights command.
To use the Shadows/Highlights command, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Expert or Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/
Highlights and make sure that the Preview check box is selected.
	
	 When the Shadows/Highlights dialog box appears, the default correction 
is applied automatically in your preview.

504
Adjusting Lighting
	
2.	 If the default adjustment doesn’t fix the problem, move the sliders (or 
enter a value) to adjust the amount of correction for your shadows 
(dark areas), highlights (light areas), and midtones (middle-toned areas).
	
	 Try to reveal more detail in the dark and light areas of your image. If, 
after you do so, your image still seems to need more correction, add or 
delete contrast in your midtone areas.
	
3.	 If you need to start over, press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and 
the Cancel button becomes Reset; click Reset to start again.
	
4.	 Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the dialog box.
Using Brightness/Contrast
Despite its very descriptive name, the Brightness/Contrast command doesn’t 
do a great job of either brightening (making an image darker or lighter) or 
adjusting contrast. Initially, users tend to be drawn to this command 
because of its logical name and ease of use. But, after users realize its 
limitations, they move on to better tools with more controls, such as 
Shadows/Highlights and Levels.
The problem with the Brightness/Contrast command is that it applies the 
adjustment equally to all areas of the image. For example, you may have a 
photo that has some highlights that need darkening, but all the midtones 
and shadows are okay. The Brightness slider isn’t adept enough to recognize 
that, so when you start to darken the highlights in your image, the midtones 
and shadows also become darker. To compensate for the unwanted darkening, 
you try to adjust the Contrast slider, which doesn’t fix the problem.
The moral is, if you want to use the Brightness/Contrast command, select 
only the areas that need the correction, as shown in Figure 2-4. (For more on 
selections, see Book IV.) After you make your selection, choose Enhance➪
Adjust Lighting➪Brightness/Contrast.
You can also find the Brightness/Contrast command in Guided mode. See 
Chapter 4 of this minibook for more on Guided mode.
Figure 2-4: The Brightness/Contrast command is best reserved 
for correcting selected areas (left) rather than the entire
image (right).

Adjusting Lighting
Nailing proper contrast with Levels
If you want the real deal when it comes to correcting the brightness and 
contrast (and even the color) in your image, look no further than the Levels 
command. Granted, the dialog box is a tad more complex than those for the 
other lighting and color-adjustment commands, but when you understand 
how it works, the payoff is well worth the effort.
You can get a taste of what Levels can do by using Auto Levels, explained in 
Chapter 1 of this minibook. However, the Levels command offers much more 
control. And, unlike the rudimentary Brightness/Contrast command, Levels 
enables you to darken or lighten 256 different tones. Keep in mind that you 
can use Levels on your entire image, a single layer, or a selected area. 
You can also apply the Levels command by using an adjustment layer, a 
recommended method, as we describe in Book VI, Chapter 1.
If you’re serious about image editing, the Levels command is one tool you 
want to master. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 In Expert or Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels.
	
	 We recommend using Expert mode for this command because you have 
access to the Info panel needed in Step 2.
	
	 The Levels dialog box appears, displaying its own histogram. This graph 
displays how the pixels of the image are distributed at each of the 256 
available brightness levels. Shadows are shown on the left side of the 
histogram, midtones are in the middle, and highlights are on the right. 
For details on histograms, see the first section of this chapter.
	
	 Although you generally make changes to the entire document by using 
the RGB channel, you can apply changes to any one of an image’s 
component color channels by selecting the specific channel on the 
Channel drop-down menu. You can also make adjustments to just 
selected areas, which can be helpful when one area of your image needs 
adjusting and others don’t.
	
2.	 In Expert mode, choose Window➪Info to open the Info panel.
	
3.	 Set the black and white points manually by using the eyedroppers in 
the dialog box.
	
	 To do so, first select the White Eyedropper tool and then move the 
cursor over the image.
	
4.	 Look at the Info panel, try to find the lightest white in the image, and 
then select that point by clicking it.
	
	 The lightest white has the highest RGB values.
	
5.	 Repeat Steps 3 and 4, using the Black Eyedropper tool and trying to 
find the darkest black in the image.
	
	 The darkest black has the lowest RGB values.

506
Adjusting Lighting
	
	 When you set the pure black and pure white points, the remaining pixels 
are redistributed between those two points.
	
	 You can also reset the white and black points by moving the position 
of the white and black triangles on the input sliders (just below the 
histogram). Or, you can enter values in the Input Levels boxes. The 
three boxes represent the black, gray, and white triangles, respectively. 
Use the numbers 0 to 255 in the white and black boxes.
	
6.	 Use the Gray Eyedropper tool to remove any color casts by selecting a 
neutral gray portion of your image, one in which the Info panel shows 
equal values of red, green, and blue.
	
	 If your image is grayscale, you can’t use the Gray Eyedropper tool.
	
	 If you’re not sure where you have a neutral gray, you can also remove a 
color cast by choosing a color channel from the Channel drop-down 
menu and doing one of the following:
	
•	 Choose the Red channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to 
add cyan or to the left to add red.
	
•	 Choose the Green channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to 
add magenta or to the left to add green.
	
•	 Choose the Blue channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to 
add yellow or to the left to add blue.
	
7.	 If your image has too much contrast, adjust the output sliders at the 
bottom of the Levels dialog box.
	
	 Moving the black triangle to the right reduces the contrast in the shadows 
and lightens the image. Moving the white triangle to the left reduces the 
contrast in the highlights and darkens the image.
	
8.	 Adjust the midtones (or gamma values) with the gray triangle input 
slider.
	
	 The default value for gamma is 1.0. Drag the triangle to the left to lighten 
midtones and drag to the right to darken them. You can also enter a 
value.
	
9.	 Click OK to apply your settings and close the dialog box.
	
	 The contrast in your images should be improved, as shown in Figure 2-5.
	
When you click the Auto button, Elements applies the same adjustments as 
the Auto Levels command, as we explain in Chapter 1 of this minibook. Note 
the changes and subsequent pixel redistribution shown in the histogram 
after you click this button.

Adjusting Color
Getting the color you want sometimes seems about as likely as finding a pot 
of gold at the end of a rainbow. Sometimes, an unexpected color cast (a shift 
in color) is created when photographing, for example, by using (or not using, 
in some cases) a flash or lens filter or by setting the camera’s white balance 
for lighting conditions that aren’t present. After the fact, you can usually do 
a decent job of correcting the color with one of the many Elements adjustments. 
Occasionally, you may want to change the color of your image to create a 
certain special effect. Conversely, you also may want to strip out most of the 
color from your image to create a vintage feel. Remember that you can apply 
all these color adjustments to the entire image, to a single layer, or to only a 
selection. Whatever your color needs, they’ll no doubt be met in Elements.
All color adjustments are available in either Expert or Quick mode except for 
Defringe Layers, which is available only in Expert mode.
	
If you shoot your photos in the Camera Raw file format, you can open and fix 
your files in the Camera Raw dialog box. Remember that Camera Raw files 
haven’t been processed by your camera. You’re in total control of the color 
and the exposure. For more on Camera Raw, see Book III, Chapter 4.
Removing color casts automatically
If you ever took a photo in an office or classroom and got a nasty green tint 
in your image, it was most likely caused by the overhead fluorescent lighting. 
To eliminate this green tint, or color cast, you can apply the Remove Color 
Cast command. This feature is designed to adjust the image’s overall color 
and remove the cast.

508
Adjusting Color
Follow these short steps to correct your image:
	
1.	 Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast in either Expert or 
Quick mode.
	
	 The Remove Color Cast dialog box appears. Move the dialog box to 
better view your image. Note that this command is also available in 
Guided mode.
	
2.	 Click an area in your photo that should be white, black, or neutral 
gray, as shown in Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-6: Get rid of nasty color shifts with the Remove Color Cast 
command.
	
	 The colors in the image are adjusted according to the color you choose. 
Which color should you choose? The answer depends on the subject 
matter of your image. Feel free to experiment. Your adjustment is merely 
a preview at this point and isn’t applied until you click OK.
	
3.	 If you goof up, click the Reset button.
	
	 Your image reverts to its unadjusted state.
	
4.	 If you’re satisfied with the adjustment, click OK to accept it and close 
the dialog box.
	
If the Remove Color Cast command doesn’t fix the problem, try using the 
Color Variations command or applying a photo filter (as we describe in the 
section “Adjusting color temperature with photo filters,” later in this 
chapter). For example, if your photo has too much green, try applying a 
magenta filter.
Adjusting with Hue/Saturation
The Hue/Saturation command enables you to adjust the colors in your image 
based on their hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is the color in your image. 
Saturation is the intensity, or richness, of that color. And lightness controls 
the brightness value.

menu or choose one color to adjust.
	
3.	 Drag the slider for one or more of the following attributes to adjust 
the colors as described:
	
•	 Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise (drag right) or counterclockwise 
(drag left) around the color wheel.
	
•	 Saturation: Increases (drag right) or decreases (drag left) the 
richness of the colors. Dragging all the way to the left gives you the 
appearance of a grayscale image.
	
•	 Lightness: Increases the brightness values by adding white (drag 
right) or decreases the brightness values by adding black (drag left).
	
	 The top color ramp at the bottom of the dialog box represents the 
colors in their order on the color wheel before you make any 
changes. The lower color bar displays the colors after you make your 
adjustments.
	
	 When you select an individual color to adjust, sliders appear between 
the color bars so that you can define the range of color to be adjusted. 
You can select, add, or subtract colors from the range by choosing one 
of the Eyedropper tools and clicking in the image.
	
4.	 (Optional) Select the Colorize option to change the colors in your 
image to a new, single color; drag the Hue slider to change the color 
to the desired hue.
	
	 The pure white and black pixels remain unchanged, and the intermediate 
gray pixels are colorized.
	
Use the Hue/Saturation command with the Colorize option to create tinted 
photos, such as the sepia-colored image shown in Figure 2-7. You can also 
make selections in a grayscale image and apply a different tint to each 
selection. This can be especially fun with portraits. Tinted images can create 
a vintage or moody feel and can greatly improve mediocre photos.

Eliminating color with Remove Color
Despite all the talk in this chapter about color, we realize that sometimes 
you don’t want any color. With the Remove Color command, you can 
eliminate all the color from an image, layer, or selection. In Figure 2-8, we 
selected the background and applied the Remove Color command. To use 
this one-step command, simply choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove 
Color.
	
Sometimes, stripping away color with this command can leave your image 
flat, or low in contrast. In this case, adjust the contrast by using one of the 
many lighting fixes in Elements, such as Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, or 
Levels.
The Convert to Black and White command (on the Enhance menu) enables 
you to convert a selection, a layer, or an entire image to grayscale. But, 
rather than just arbitrarily stripping color (as the Remove Color command 
does), the Convert to Black and White command enables you to select a 
conversion method by first choosing an image style. To further refine the 
results, you can add or subtract colors (red, green, or blue) or contrast by 
moving the Intensity sliders until your grayscale image looks the way you 
want. You aren’t really adding color; you’re simply altering the amount of 
data in the color channels.

Switching colors with 
Replace Color
The Replace Color command 
enables you to replace designated 
colors in an image with other colors. 
You first select the colors you want 
to replace by creating a mask, which 
is a selection made by designating 
white (selected), black (deselected), 
and gray (partially selected) areas. 
(See Book VI, Chapter 4, for more 
details on working with masks.) 
You can then adjust the hue and/or 
saturation of those selected colors.
Follow these steps to replace colors 
with others:
	
1.	 In Quick or Expert mode, 
choose Enhance➪Adjust 
Color➪Replace Color.
	
	 The Replace Color dialog box 
appears.
	
2.	 Select the Preview check box, 
if it isn’t selected already.
	
3.	 Choose either Selection or Image:
	
•	 Selection: Shows the mask in the Preview area. The deselected areas 
are black, partially selected areas are gray, and selected areas are 
white.
	
•	 Image: Shows the actual image in the Preview area.
	
4.	 Click the colors you want to select in either the image or the Preview 
area.
	
5.	 Shift-click or use the plus sign (+) Eyedropper tool located in the 
Replace Color dialog box to add more colors.
	
6.	 Press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) or use the minus sign (–) 
Eyedropper tool to delete colors.
	
7.	 To add colors similar to the ones you select, adjust the Fuzziness 
slider to fine-tune your selection, adding or deleting from the 
selection based on the Fuzziness value.
	
	 To further fine-tune your selection, try using the Localized Color 
Clusters option. This option lets you select multiple color clusters and 
can assist in getting a cleaner, more precise selection, especially when 
you’re trying to select more than one color.

Correcting with Color Curves
The most sophisticated of the color correctors is the Color Curves com­
mand. This adjustment attempts to improve the tonal range in color images 
by making adjustments to highlights, shadows, and midtones in each color 
channel. Try using this command on images in which the foreground ele­
ments appear overly dark due to backlighting. Conversely, the adjustment is 
also designed to correct images that appear overexposed and washed out.
Here’s how to use this adjustment on a selection, a layer, or an entire image:
	
1.	 In Quick or Expert mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color 
Curves.
	
	 The Adjust Color Curves dialog box appears.

Adjusting skin tones
Sometimes, the family and friends in your photos appear nauseated (green), 
sunburned (red), or frigid (blue), or they’ve taken on some other nonflesh-
colored tone. To fix that problem, Elements provides a command that’s 
designed to adjust the overall color in the image and restore skin tones to 
more natural and attractive shades.
Here’s how to fix those skin tones:
	
1.	 Open your image in Quick or Expert mode, select the Preview check 
box, and do one or both of the following:
	
•	 Select the layer that needs to be adjusted. If you don’t have any layers, 
your entire image is adjusted.
	
•	 Select the desired areas of skin that need to be adjusted. Only the 
selected areas are adjusted. This is recommended if you’re satisfied 
with the color of your other elements and just want to fix the skin 
tones. For more on selection techniques, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
	
2.	 Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin Tone.
	
	 The Adjust Color for Skin Tone dialog box appears. You can also find 
this command in Guided mode.
	
3.	 In the Image window, click the portion of skin that needs to be 
corrected.
	
	 The command adjusts the color of the skin tone, as well as the color in 
the overall image, layer, or selection, depending on what you selected in 
Step 1.
	
4.	 If you’re unhappy with the results, click another area or adjust the 
Skin and Ambient Light sliders:
	
•	 Tan: Increases or decreases the amount of brown in the skin.
	
•	 Blush: Increases or decreases the amount of red in the skin.
	
•	 Temperature: Adjusts the overall color of the skin, making it warmer 
(right toward red) or cooler (left toward blue).
	
5.	 To start from square one, click the Reset button; to bail out completely, 
click Cancel.
	
6.	 When you’re satisfied with the correction, click OK to apply the 
adjustment and close the dialog box.
	
	 Your improved skin appears, as shown in Figure 2-11.

Defringing layers
A surefire sign of a sloppily composited image is a selection with a fringe. 
Don’t get us wrong: If the fringe is the kind that is hanging off of your ’70s-era 
buckskin leather jacket, that’s fine. You just don’t want the fringe that consists 
of those background pixels surrounding the edges of your selections, as 
shown in Figure 2-12. Sometimes, when making a selection, you pick up some 
of the background pixels. These pixels are referred to as a fringe or halo. 
Luckily, the Defringe command replaces the color of the fringe pixels with 
the colors of neighboring pixels that don’t contain the background color. In 
our example, we plucked the globe out of a white background and placed it 
on a black background. Some of the background pixels were included in our 
selection and appear as white fringe. When we apply the Defringe command, 
those white fringe pixels are changed to colors of nearby pixels (see 
Figure 2-12).
Follow these steps to defringe your selection:
	
1.	 In Expert mode only, copy and paste a selection onto a new or exist­
ing layer, or drag and drop a selection onto a new document.
	
	 The Defringe Layer command doesn’t work in Quick mode.
	
2.	 Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Defringe Layer.
	
	 The Defringe dialog box appears.

3.	 Enter a value for the number of pixels that needs to be converted.
	
	 Try entering 1 or 2 first to see whether that fixes the fringe problem. If 
not, you may need to enter a slightly higher value.
	
4.	 Click OK to accept the value and close the dialog box.
Adjusting color temperature with photo filters
Light has its own color temperature. A photo shot in a higher color 
temperature of light makes an image blue. An image shot in a lower color 
temperature makes a photo yellow. Photographers sometimes use colored 
glass filters in front of their camera lenses to adjust the color temperature of 
the light. They do this to warm up or cool down their photos or just to add a 
hint of color for subtle special effects. You can, however, mimic this effect in 
Elements with the digital versions of these filters.

To apply the Photo Filter adjustment, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Expert mode, choose Filter➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter.
	
	 The Photo Filter dialog box appears.
	
	 You can also apply the photo filter to an individual layer by creating a 
photo-filter adjustment layer. For details on adjustment layers, see 
Book VI, Chapter 1.
	
2.	 In the dialog box, select Filter to choose a preset filter from the 
drop-down list, or select Color to select your own filter color from the 
Color Picker.
	
	 Here’s a brief description of each of the preset filters:
	
•	 Warming Filter (85), (81), and (LBA): Adjust the white balance in an 
image to make the colors warmer or more yellow. Filter (81) is like 
(85) and (LBA), but it’s best used for minor adjustments.
	
•	 Cooling Filter (80), (82), and (LBB): Also adjust the white balance 
that’s shown, but instead of making the colors warmer, they make 
the colors cooler or bluer. Filter (82) is like (80) and (LBB), but it’s 
designed for slight adjustments.
	
•	 Red, Orange, Yellow, and so on: The various color filters adjust the 
hue, or color, of a photo. Choose a color filter to try to eliminate a 
color cast or to apply a special effect.
	
3.	 Adjust the Density option to specify the amount of color applied to 
your image.
	
4.	 Select Preserve Luminosity to prevent the photo filter from darkening 
your image.
	
5.	 Click OK to apply your filter and close the dialog box.

Adjusting Color
	
A good way to minimize the need for color adjustments is to be sure to set 
your camera’s white balance for your existing lighting conditions before 
shooting your photo.
Mapping your colors
Elements provides commands referred to as color mappers, which change 
the colors in your image by mapping them to other values. You can find the 
color mappers by choosing Filter➪Adjustments. Figure 2-14 shows results of 
using these commands, which we also briefly describe in the following list:

Book VIII 
Chapter 2
Correcting Lighting, 
Color, and Clarity
Adjusting Clarity
	
✓	Equalize: This mapper first locates the lightest and darkest pixels in the 
image and assigns them values of white and black. It then redistributes 
all the remaining pixels among the grayscale values. The exact effect 
depends on your individual image.
	
✓	Gradient Map: This command maps the tonal range of an image to the 
colors of your chosen gradient. For example, colors (such as orange, 
green, and purple) are mapped to the shadows, highlight, and midtone 
areas.
	
✓	Invert: This command reverses all the colors in your image, creating a 
kind of negative. Black reverses to white, and colors convert to their 
complementary hues (blue goes to yellow, red goes to cyan, and so on).
	
✓	Posterize: This command reduces the number of colors in your image. 
Choose a value between 2 and 255 colors. Lower values create an illus­
trative, poster look, and higher values produce a more photo-realistic 
image.
	
✓	Threshold: Threshold makes your image black and white, with all pixels 
that are brighter than a value you specify represented as white, and all 
pixels that are as dark or darker than that value as black. You can 
change the threshold level to achieve different high-contrast effects.
	
	The Threshold command can come in handy when you need to clean up 
scans of line art, such as hand-drawn sketches, people’s signatures, 
pages from a book, or even sheet music. Often, when you scan things on 
paper, the slight color from the paper appears as a dull gray background 
in the scan. By applying the Threshold command, you can adjust the 
tones in your image to black and white and drop out the gray. Simply 
move the slider to get your desired balance of white and black areas.
Adjusting Clarity
After you’ve corrected the contrast and color and fixed your major flaws, 
like scratches, wrinkles, and blemishes (as we describe in Chapter 1 of this 
minibook), you’re ready to finally work on the overall clarity of that image. If 
your image suffers from an overall problem like dust, scratches, or artifacts 
(blocky pixels or halos), you may need to employ the help of a filter. Then 
finally, after you totally clean up your image, your last task is to give it a 
good sharpening. Why wait until the very end to do so? Sometimes, improving 
the contrast and color and getting rid of flaws can reduce the clarity and 
sharpness of an image. So you want to be sure that your image is as soft as 
it’s going to get before you dive into sharpening. On the other hand, keep in 
mind that sharpening increases contrast, so (depending on how much of the 
image you’re sharpening), you may need to go back and fine-tune it by using 
the lighting adjustments described in the section “Adjusting Lighting,” 
earlier in this chapter.

520
Adjusting Clarity
Finally, we know we’ve been harping on the value of sharpening, but believe 
it or not, you may also need to blur an image occasionally. Blurring can 
eliminate unpleasant patterns that occur during scanning, soften distracting 
backgrounds to give a better focal point, or even create the illusion of 
motion.
Removing noise, artifacts, dust, and scratches
We know it sounds ironic, but the tools you use to eliminate unwanted 
garbage from your images are found on the Filter➪Noise submenu in Expert 
mode. With the exception of the Add Noise filter, the others actually help to 
hide noise, dust, scratches, and artifacts. Here’s the list of cleaners:
	
✓	Despeckle: Decreases the contrast, without affecting the edges, to make 
the dust in your image less pronounced. You may notice a slight blurring 
of your image (that’s what’s hiding the garbage), but the edges should 
still be sharp.
	
✓	Dust & Scratches: Hides, well, dust and scratches by blurring those 
areas of your image that contain the gunk. (It looks for harsh transitions 
in tone.) Specify your desired Radius value, which is the size of the area 
to be blurred. Also, specify the Threshold value, which determines how 
much contrast between pixels must be present before they’re blurred.
	
	Use restraint with the Dust & Scratches filter. It can wipe out detail and 
make your image look like mush.
	
✓	Median: Reduces contrast around dust spots. The process the filter 
goes through is rather technical, but basically light spots darken, dark 
spots lighten, and the rest of the image isn’t changed. Specify your 
desired radius, which is the size of the area to be adjusted.
	
✓	Reduce Noise: Designed to remove luminance noise and artifacts from 
your images. We used this filter to correct the original image (on the 
left) in Figure 2-15, which had the nasty blockiness caused by JPEG 
compression. Luminance noise is grayscale noise that makes images look 
overly grainy. Specify these options to reduce the noise in an image:
	
•	 Strength: Specify the amount of noise reduction.
	
•	 Preserve Details: A higher percentage preserves edges and details but 
reduces the amount of noise that’s removed.
	
•	 Reduce Color Noise: Remove random colored pixels.
	
•	 Remove JPEG Artifact: Remove the blocks and halos that can occur 
from low-quality JPEG compression.

Blurring when you need to
It may sound strange that anyone would 
intentionally want to blur an image. But, if your 
photo is overly grainy or suffers from an ugly 
moiré pattern (described in the following list), 
you may need to blur the image to correct the 
problem. Also, often, you may even want to blur 
the background of an image to deemphasize 
distractions or to make the foreground elements 
appear sharper and provide a better focal point, 
as shown in Figure 2-16.
You can access all the blurring tools by choosing 
Filter➪Blur in Expert or Quick mode. The 
exception is the Blur tool, which we explain in 
Chapter 1 of this minibook:
	
✓	Average: This one-step filter calculates the 
average value of the image or selection and 
fills the area with that average value. You 
can use it for smoothing overly noisy areas 
in your image.
	
✓	Blur: Another one-step filter, this one applies a fixed amount of blurring 
to the whole image.
Figure 2-16: Blur your image to 
emphasize a focal point.

522
Adjusting Clarity
	
✓	Blur More: This one-step blur filter gives the same effect as Blur, but 
more intensely.
	
✓	Motion Blur: This filter mimics the blur given off by moving objects. 
Specify the angle of motion and the distance of the blur. Make sure to 
select the Preview check box to see the effect while you enter the 
values.
	
✓	Radial Blur: This filter produces a circular blur effect.
	
a.	 Specify the amount of blur that you want.
	
b.	 Choose the Spin method to blur along concentric circular lines, as 
shown in the thumbnail.
	
	 Or choose Zoom to blur along radial lines and mimic the effect of 
zooming in to your image.
	
c.	 Specify the desired Quality level.
	
	 Because the Radial Blur filter is notoriously slow, Elements gives you 
the option of Draft (fast but grainy), Good, or Best (slow but 
smooth). The difference between Good and Best is evident only on 
large, high-resolution images.
	
d.	 Indicate where you want the center of your blur by moving the blur 
diagram thumbnail.
	
✓	Smart Blur: This filter provides several options to enable you to specify 
how the blur is applied.
	
a.	 Specify a value for the radius and threshold, both defined in the 
following section.
	
	 Start with a lower value for both and adjust from there.
	
b.	 Choose a quality setting from the drop-down menu.
	
c.	 Choose a mode setting.
	
	 Normal blurs the entire image or selection. Edge Only blurs only the 
edges of your elements and uses black and white in the blurred 
pixels. Overlay Edge also blurs just the edges, but it applies only 
white to the blurred pixels.
	
✓	Surface Blur: This filter blurs the surface, or interior, of the image, 
rather than the edges. If you want to preserve your edge details but blur 
everything else, this is the filter for you.
	
✓	Gaussian Blur: The last Blur filter we discuss is probably the one you’ll 
use most often. It offers a Radius setting to let you adjust the amount of 
blurring you desire.

523
Book VIII 
Chapter 2
Correcting Lighting, 
Color, and Clarity
Adjusting Clarity
	
	Use the Gaussian Blur filter to camouflage moiré patterns on scanned 
images. A moiré pattern is caused when you scan halftone images. A 
halftone is created when a continuous-tone image, such as a photo, is 
digitized and converted into a screen pattern of repeating lines (usually 
between 85 and 150 lines per inch) and then printed. When you then 
scan that halftone, a second pattern results and is overlaid on the 
original pattern. These two different patterns clash and create an ugly 
moiré pattern. The Gaussian Blur filter doesn’t eliminate the moiré — it 
just merges the dots and reduces the appearance of the pattern.
If you’ve ever played with the aperture settings on a camera, you know that 
you can specify how shallow or deep your depth of field is. Depth of field 
relates to the plane of focus (the areas in a photo that are in front of or 
behind the focal point and that remain in focus) or how in-focus the fore­
ground elements are when you compare them to the background elements. 
The Lens Blur filter allows you to give the effect of a shallower depth of field 
after you have already captured your image. This filter enables you to take a 
fully focused image and create this type of selective focus. You can also use 
it to create a kind of dreamy effect, as shown in Figure 2-17.
Figure 2-17: Use the Lens Blur filter to create a shallow depth of field 
effect.

524
Adjusting Clarity
Follow these steps to use the Lens Blur filter:
	
1.	 Choose Filter➪Blur➪Lens Blur.
	
2.	 In the Lens Blur dialog box, choose your Preview mode.
	
	 Faster gives you a quick preview, while More Accurate shows you the 
final rendered image.
	
3.	 Choose a Source from the drop-down menu for your depth map, if you 
have one.
	
	 You can choose between a layer mask or transparency. A good way to 
create an image with this shallow depth of field effect is to create a layer 
mask on your image layer and fill it with a white-to-black gradient — 
black where you want the most focus and white where you want the 
least focus or most blur. Choose Transparency to make an image 
blurrier and more transparent.
	
	 The filter uses a depth map to determine how the blur works.
	
4.	 Drag the Blur Focal Distance slider to specify how blurry or in focus 
an area of the image is.
	
	 Alternatively, click the crosshair cursor on the part of the image that 
you want to be in full focus.
	
	 Dragging the slider enables you to specify a value. You can also select 
Invert to invert, or reverse, the depth map source.
	
5.	 Choose an Iris shape, such as triangle or octagon, from the Shape 
drop-down menu.
	
	 The Iris settings are meant to simulate a camera lens.
	
6.	 Specify the shape of the lens, as well as the radius (size of the iris), 
blade curvature (how smooth are the iris edges), and rotation of that 
shape.
	
7.	 Set the Brightness and Threshold values in the Specular Highlights 
area.
	
	 The Lens Blur filter averages the highlights of an image, which, if left 
uncorrected, cause some highlights to appear grayish. The Specular 
Highlights controls help to retain specular highlights, or those highlights 
that should appear very white. Set the Threshold value to specify which 
highlights should be specular (remain white). Set a Brightness value to 
specify how much to relighten any blurred areas.
	
8.	 Drag the Amount slider in the Noise area to add noise back into your 
image; choose monochromatic to add noise without affecting the 
color.

	 Blurring obliterates any noise (or film grain) that an image may have. 
This absence of noise can cause the image to appear inconsistent or 
unrealistic, in many cases.
	
9.	 Click OK to apply the Lens Blur and exit the dialog box.
Sharpening for better focus
Of course, if your images don’t need any contrast-, color-, and flaw-fixing, feel 
free to move right into sharpening. Sometimes, images captured by a scanner 
or a digital camera are a little soft, and it’s not due to any tonal adjustments. 
Occasionally, you may even want to sharpen a selected area in your image 
just so that it becomes a better focal point.
Keep in mind that you can’t really improve the focus of an image after 
capturing it. But you can do a decent job of faking it. All sharpening tools 
work by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels. This increased 
contrast causes the edges to appear more distinct, thereby giving the 
illusion that the focus is improved, as shown in Figure 2-18. Remember that 
you can also use the Sharpen tool for very small areas, as described in 
Chapter 1 of this minibook.
Figure 2-18: Sharpening mimics an increase in focus by increasing 
contrast between adjacent pixels.

526
Adjusting Clarity
Here’s the lowdown on sharpening commands:
	
✓	Unsharp Mask: Unsharp Mask, on the Enhance menu in Expert or Quick 
mode, gives you several options that enable you to control the amount 
of sharpening and the width of the areas to be sharpened. Use them to 
nail your desired sharpening:
	
•	 Amount: Specify an amount (from 1% to 500%) of edge sharpening. 
The higher the value, the more contrast between pixels around the 
edges. Start with a value of 100% (or less), which usually gives good 
contrast without appearing overly grainy.
	
•	 Radius: Specify the width (from 0.1 to 250 pixels) of the edges that 
the filter will sharpen. The higher the value, the wider the edge. The 
value you use is largely based on the resolution of your image. 
Low-resolution images require a smaller radius value. High-
resolution images require a higher value.
	
	 Be warned that specifying a value that’s too high overemphasizes the 
edges of your image and makes them appear thick and goopy.
	 	
	 A good rule for selecting a starting radius value is to divide your 
image’s resolution by 150. For example, if you have a 300-ppi (pixels 
per inch) image, set the radius at 2 and then use your eye to adjust 
from there.
	
•	 Threshold: Specify the difference in brightness (from 0 to 255) that 
must be present between adjacent pixels before the edge is sharpened. 
A lower value sharpens edges with very little contrast difference. 
Higher values sharpen only when adjacent pixels are very different in 
contrast. We recommend leaving Threshold set at 0 unless your 
image is very grainy. Increasing the value too much can cause 
unnatural transitions between sharpened and unsharpened areas.
	
	Occasionally, the values you enter for Amount and Radius may sharpen 
the image effectively but can create excess grain, or noise, in your 
image. You can sometimes reduce this noise by increasing the 
Threshold value.
	
✓	Adjust Sharpness: Another sharpening option is the Adjust Sharpness 
command, as shown in Figure 2-19. This feature enables you to control 
the amount of sharpening applied to shadow and highlight areas. It also 
allows you to select from various sharpening algorithms.
	
	Specify the following options:
	
•	 Amount and Radius: See the two descriptions in the earlier Unsharp 
Mask bullet.

•	 Remove: Choose your sharpening algorithm. Gaussian Blur is the 
algorithm used for the Unsharp Mask command. Lens Blur detects 
detail in the image and attempts to respect the details while reducing 
the nasty halos that can occur with sharpening. Motion Blur tries to 
sharpen the blurring that occurs when your camera, or your subject, 
moves.
	
•	 Angle: Specify the direction of motion for the Motion Blur algorithm, 
described in the preceding Remove bullet.
	
•	 More Refined: Runs the algorithm more slowly than the default speed 
for better accuracy.

Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush Tools
The two Smart Brush tools — Smart Brush and Detail Smart Brush — are fun 
tools that enable you to selectively apply image adjustments or special 
effects that then appear on all or part of your image. What’s great is that 
these adjustments and effects are applied via an adjustment layer, meaning 
that they hover over your layers and don’t permanently alter the pixels in 
your image. The adjustments can also be flexibly edited and deleted, if you 
so desire.

528
Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush Tools
Using the Smart Brush
The Smart Brush tool allows you to paint a variety of image adjustments on 
all or just a portion of your image. The action of the tool is similar to that 
of the Selection Brush — as you brush, you make a selection and adjust 
simultaneously. Follow these steps to use the Smart Brush tool:
	
	 1.	 Select the Smart Brush tool from the Tools panel in Expert mode.
	
	
	 The tool icon looks like a house paintbrush with an adjacent gear. 
You can also press the F key to switch between the Smart Brush and 
Detail Smart Brush tools.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, choose your desired brush size.
	
3.	 Choose additional attributes, such as hardness, spacing, and 
roundness, from the Brush Settings drop-down panel.
	
	 For more on working with brushes, see Book V, Chapter 1.
	
4.	 Select your desired adjustment category and then a particular preset 
adjustment from the Smart Paint Preset Picker drop-down panel in the 
Tool Options, as shown in Figure 2-20.
	
	 In the Smart Paint preset panel, choose adjustments ranging from 
photographic effects, such as a vintage Yellowed Photo, to nature 
effects, such as Sunset (which gives a warm, orange glow to your image).
	
5.	 Paint an adjustment on a layer in your image, as shown in Figure 2-20, 
where we painted with the Antique Contrast effect.
	
	 While you paint, the Smart Brush tool attempts to detect edges in your 
image and snaps to those edges. In addition, while you brush, a selec­
tion border appears.
	
	 A new adjustment layer is automatically created with your first paint 
stroke. The accompanying layer mask also appears on that adjustment 
layer. For more on adjustment layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
	
6.	 Using the Add and Subtract Smart Brush modes in the Tool Options, 
fine-tune your adjusted area by adding and subtracting from it.
	
	 When you add and subtract from your adjusted area, you’re essentially 
modifying your layer mask. Adding to the adjusted area adds white to 
the layer mask, and subtracting from an adjusted area adds black to the 
layer mask. For more on layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 4.
	
7.	 Select a different preset adjustment for your selected area, if you 
want.
	
	 In fact, try them all out before you make your final choice.

8.	 If you believe that you need to refine your selected area, choose the 
Refine Edges option in the Tool Options.
	
	 For more on Refine Edges, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
	
	 If you’d rather apply the adjustment to your unselected area, select the 
Inverse option in the Tool Options.
	
	 If you want to modify your adjustment, double-click the Adjustment 
Layer pin on your image. The pin is annotated by a small, square, 
black-and-red gear icon. After you double-click the pin, the dialog box 
corresponding to your particular adjustment appears. For example, if 
you double-click the Shoe Box Photo adjustment (under Photographic), 
you access the Hue/Saturation dialog box.

530
Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush Tools
	
9.	 Make your necessary adjustments in the dialog box and click OK.
	
	 You can also right-click (on the Mac, Control-click if you’re using a 
one-button mouse) and select Change Adjustment Settings from the 
contextual menu that appears. Or, you can select Delete Adjustment and 
Hide Selection from the same menu.
	
10.	 After you finish, simply deselect your selection by choosing Select➪
Deselect.
	
You can add multiple Smart Brush adjustments. After you apply one effect, 
reset the Smart Brush tool and apply additional adjustments.
Getting accurate with the Detail Smart Brush
The Detail Smart Brush tool also enables you to paint various image 
adjustments on all or part of your image. The action of the tool is similar to 
the regular Brush tool, enabling finer control than that of the Smart Brush. 
Follow these steps to use the Detail Smart Brush tool:
	
	 1.	 Select the Detail Smart Brush tool from the Tools panel in Expert mode.
	
	
	 The tool icon looks like an art paintbrush with an adjacent gear. 
You can also press the F key to switch between the Smart Brush and 
Detail Smart Brush tools.
	
2.	 In the Tool Options, choose a brush tip from the Brush Preset Picker 
drop-down panel and adjust the brush tip size as desired.
	
	 Feel free to change your brush tip and size as needed to achieve the 
desired effect. For more on working with brushes, see Book V, Chapter 1.
	
3.	 Select an adjustment category and then your particular preset adjustment 
from the Smart Paint drop-down panel in the Tool Options.
	
	 Effects include making your image look like a film negative or an X-ray, 
as well as more subtle looks, such as creating a vintage photo with the 
Sepia Duotone effect. Figure 2-21 shows a pencil sketch effect.
	
4.	 Paint an adjustment on the desired layer in your image.
	
	 A new adjustment layer is automatically created with your first paint 
stroke, along with an accompanying layer mask.
	
5.	 Follow Steps 6 through 9 in the preceding step list for the Smart Brush 
tool.
	
Elements supports touchscreen capability on both Windows and Mac 
platforms. If you have a touchscreen monitor, or an iPad with a VNC (Virtual 
Network Computing) application, you can browse images in the Organizer by 
simply flicking with your fingers. What’s even cooler is that you can even 
retouch and enhance images by using all the tools in the Tools panel with 
your fingers. Mouse? We don’t need no stinkin’ mouse!

S

ometimes, working with just a single shot isn’t quite enough. Imagine 
this scenario: As much as you try, you just can’t quite squeeze that 
vacation scenic vista into one photo; in fact, it takes a total of three shots. 
Or one of your relatives is always blinking or looking the wrong way in your 
family reunion snapshots, so no single shot ends up being the perfect group 
photo. Or maybe bystanders or cars keep crossing the path of your 
camera when you’re trying to capture that historic landmark.
Not to worry, because the Elements Photomerge com­
mands are designed to help you fix these types of 
problems. One command seamlessly stitches multi­
ple shots of your panorama into a single image, 
while another eliminates distracting elements from 
your shots, and a third command enables you to 
combine multiple group shots to get the best com­
posite. Yet another command even lets you take 
two faces and combine them into a kind of hybrid 
human. And the newest command enables you to 
transfer the style of one image onto another. How cool 
is that?
	
You can access all but one (Photomerge Panorama) of the 
Photomerge commands in all three Photo Editor modes — 
Expert, Quick, and Guided — or in the Organizer. Photomerge Panorama 
is only available in Expert mode and in the Organizer.

534
Stitching a Scene with Photomerge Panorama
Stitching a Scene with Photomerge Panorama
The Photomerge Panorama command enables you to combine multiple 
images into a single panoramic image. You can take several overlapping pho­
tos, from skylines to mountain ranges, and stitch them together into one 
shot.
	
If you know your ultimate goal is to create a Photomerge composition, you 
can make things easier for yourself by making sure that when you shoot 
your photos, you overlap your individual images by 15 percent to 40 per­
cent, but no more than 50 percent. Adobe recommends that you avoid using 
distortion lenses (such as a fish-eye) and that you also avoid using your 
camera’s zoom setting. Additionally, try to keep the same exposure settings 
for even lighting. Finally, try to stay in the same position and keep your cam­
era at the same level for each shot. Using a tripod and rotating the head can 
help you achieve this consistency. Note, however, that rotating the head 
may make it difficult to keep even lighting, depending on the angle of your 
light source relative to the camera. You may also introduce a perspective 
distortion. To minimize distortion while shooting, try to have your tripod on 
a level and parallel surface, if possible. If you still get some distortion, you 
can correct it during the stitching described in the following steps.
Follow these steps to assemble your own Photomerge Panorama composition:
	
1.	 In the Photo Editor, in Expert mode, choose Enhance➪Photomerge➪
Photomerge Panorama.
	
	 This command is the only Photomerge command that is accessible only 
from the Expert mode or from the Organizer.
	
2.	 In the first Photomerge dialog box, shown in Figure 3-1, select your 
source files.
	
	 You can select from Files (which uses individual files you select) or from 
Folder (which uses all images in a folder) from the Use drop-down list. 
Click the Add Open Files button to use all currently open files. Or click 
the Browse button to navigate to certain files or folders.
	
3.	 Under Layout, select a projection mode.
	
	 The thumbnail illustration visually demonstrates each mode, but we 
give you a little more description of each here:
	
•	 Auto: Using the Auto mode, Elements analyzes your images on 
its own.
	
•	 Perspective: Select this mode if your images have been shot with 
­perspective or at acute angles. This mode is also good to use if 
you’ve shot images using the tripod method described earlier in this 
section.

Stitching a Scene with Photomerge Panorama
Figure 3-1: Select the source files for your composition.
	
•	 Cylindrical: Select this option if you shot images with a wide-angle lens. 
This mode is also good for those 360-degree, full panoramic shots.
	
•	 Spherical: This projection method aligns images by rotating, position­
ing, and uniformly scaling each image. It may be the best choice for 
pure panoramas, but you may also find it useful for stitching 
together images based on common features.
	
•	 Collage: This mode is useful when stitching together a 360-degree 
panorama in which you have a wide field of view, both horizontally 
and vertically. Use this option for shots taken with a wide-angle lens.
	
•	 Reposition: When you select this mode, Elements doesn’t take into 
account any distortion but merely scans the images and positions 
them in what it considers the best position.
	
4.	 Select one of the following options:
	
•	 Blend Images Together: Corrects the color differences that can occur 
from blending images with different exposures.
	
•	 Vignette Removal: Corrects exposure problems caused by lens 
vignetting (when light at the edges of images is reduced and the 
edges are darkened).
	
•	 Geometric Distortion Correction: Corrects lens problems such as bar­
rel distortion (bulging out) and pincushion distortion (pinching in), 
which are both types of radial distortion.

Figure 3-2: Combine multiple images into a single panoramic shot using Photomerge Panorama.
	
	 Note that, with any of the modes, Elements leaves your merged image in 
layers. Also notice that a layer mask has been added to each layer to bet­
ter blend the panoramic image. For more on layer masks, see Book VI.
	
	 Elements alerts you if it can’t composite your source files. If that hap­
pens, you may have to composite your images manually by creating a 
large canvas and dragging and dropping your images onto that canvas.
Getting the Best Shot with Photomerge Group Shot
Getting a group of people to smile, not blink or fidget, and look in the same 
direction is about as easy as herding cats. With Elements, you no longer have 
to worry about snapping the perfect group shot anymore. Just take a bunch 
of shots (on burst mode is a great way to go) and later create the ultimate 
perfect shot by compositing those shots using Photomerge Group Shot.

Getting the Best Shot with Photomerge Group Shot
Here are the steps to create a Photomerge Group Shot image:
	
1.	 In any of the Photo Editor modes, select two or more photos from your 
Photo Bin at the bottom of your Image window.
	
2.	 Choose Enhance➪Photomerge➪Photomerge Group Shot.
	
	 The Photomerge Group Shot dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Take your best overall group shot and drag it from the Photo Bin onto 
the Final pane.
	
4.	 Select another photo in the Photo Bin to use as your source image and 
then drag it to the Source pane.
	
5.	 With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the portions of the source 
photo you want to merge into your final photo, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3: Use Photomerge Group Shot to composite the perfect group shot from several 
images.

538
Getting the Best Shot with Photomerge Group Shot
	
	 In the Options area on the right side of the dialog box, you can choose 
to show the yellow pencil strokes (Show Strokes) or show regions (Show 
Regions), which are then highlighted with a blue overlay. Use the Eraser 
tool to remove any portions you don’t want to be merged onto the final 
image.
	
6.	 Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with any remaining photos.
	
	 If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under 
Advanced Options.
	
7.	 Using the Alignment tool, click the source image and position the 
three target markers on three key locations.
	
	 Do the same on the final image and choose similar locations.
	
	 You can click the Pixel Blending option to better blend pixels.
	
8.	 Click the Align Photos button.
	
	 Again, as with Photomerge Panorama, the more similar (in framing, size, 
lighting, and so on) that your source and final images are, the better the 
merged result.
	
	 If you see any noticeable seams on your final image around the copied 
area, you can click the Pixel Blending button to help smooth over those 
flaws.
	
9.	 If you make a mess of things, click the Reset button and go back to 
Step 3.
	
10.	 When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
	
	 The file opens as a new window (save to create a new file) in Elements, 
as shown in Figure 3-4.

Manipulating Image DNA with Photomerge Faces
Photomerge Faces enables you to create the perfect portrait by compositing 
several less-than-perfect shots of a person. For example, you can get the 
smile from one shot, the eyes from another shot, and so on. You can also use 
this feature in more of a whimsical, fun way to blend features from multiple 
faces to create sort of a hybrid face, as we did in our example.
To create a new and improved human by using the Photomerge Faces fea­
ture, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select two or more photos from your Photo Bin.
	
2.	 Choose Enhance➪Photomerge➪Photomerge Faces in any of the Photo 
Editor modes.
	
	 The Photomerge Faces dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Choose the face that you want to have as your canvas (or starting 
image) and drag it from the Photo Bin onto the Final pane.
	
4.	 Select one of your other photos in the Photo Bin to use as the source 
image and then drag it to the Source pane.
	
5.	 With the Alignment tool, click the source image and position the three 
target markers on the eyes and mouth of the face; then do the same on 
the final image.
	
6.	 Click the Align Photos button.
	
	 This command sizes the images to better match and align the features. 
It’s always best to start with similarly sized, framed, and oriented 
images. Shooting the images in similar lighting helps, as well.
	
7.	 With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the features of the source 
photo that you want to merge into your final photo, as shown in 
Figure 3-5.
	
	 In the Options area on the right side of the dialog box, you can choose 
to show your blue pencil strokes (Show Strokes) or show your regions 
(Show Regions), which are then highlighted with a blue overlay. Use the 
Eraser tool to remove any portions of the face you don’t want to be 
merged onto your final image.
	
8.	 If you make a mess of things, click the Reset button and go back to 
Step 3.
	
9.	 When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
	
	 We used three photos as the basis for our frightening hybrid faces, as 
shown in Figure 3-6. The image opens as a new, layered image in 
Elements.

Eliminating with Photomerge Scene Cleaner
To get the best source images for a “clean scene,” be sure to take multiple 
shots of your scene from the same angle and distance. It also works best 
when the elements you want to eliminate are moving.
Follow these steps to create a Photomerge Scene Cleaner composite:
	
1.	 Select two or more photos from your Photo Bin.
	
2.	 Choose Enhance➪Photomerge➪Photomerge Scene Cleaner in any of 
the Photo Editor modes.
	
	 The Photomerge Scene Cleaner dialog box appears.
	
	 Elements attempts to auto-align your images the best it can.
	
3.	 Take your best overall shot of the scene and drag it from the Photo 
Bin onto the Final pane.
	
4.	 Select one of your other photos in the Photo Bin to use as your source 
image and then drag it to the Source pane.
	
5.	 With the Pencil tool, draw a line on or around the elements in the 
final photo that you want to be replaced by content from the source 
photo, as shown in Figure 3-7.
	
6.	 Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with the remaining shots of the scene.
	
	 If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under the 
Advanced Options.
Figure 3-7: Create the ideal photo from multiple shots with Photomerge Scene Cleaner.

7.	 Using the Alignment tool, click the source image and position the 
three target markers on three key locations; do the same on the final 
image, choosing similar locations.
	
8.	 Click the Align Photos button.
	
	 Again, as with the other Photomerge commands, the more similar the 
starting source images (similar framing, similar angle, similar lighting), 
the better the merged result will be.
	
9.	 If you see any noticeable seams on your final image around the cop­
ied area, click the Pixel Blending button to help smooth over those 
flaws.
	
10.	 If you make a mess of things, click the Reset button and go back to 
Step 3.
	
11.	 When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
The cleaned-up image opens as a new file in Elements. You have to admit, for 
a command that’s so easy to use, the results are impressive (see Figure 3-8).
	
Be sure to check the edges of your composite image carefully for artifacts or 
blurring caused by the aligning of the multiple images. Execute a quick crop 
with the Crop tool, and you’re good to go.

Fixing Lighting with Photomerge Exposure
Fixing Lighting with Photomerge Exposure
Occasionally, you need to capture a shot that presents an exposure 
­challenge — your foreground and background require different exposure 
settings. This challenge often occurs in shots that are backlit. For example, 
you have a person in front of an indoor window in the day or someone in 
front of a lit nighttime cityscape or sunset. With Photomerge Exposure, you 
can take photos with two different exposure settings and let the command 
blend them together for the perfect shot.
	
You can capture your shots using exposure bracketing (shooting at consecu­
tive exposure camera settings) or with a flash and then without. Elements 
can detect all these camera settings. We recommend that you use a tripod to 
keep your shots as aligned as possible. Good alignment helps the blending 
algorithm do a better job.
Here’s how to use this command:
	
1.	 Select two or more photos from your Photo Bin.
	
2.	 Choose Enhance➪Photomerge➪Photomerge Exposure in any of the 
Photo Editor modes.
	
3.	 If you’ve used a tripod or have a done a good job keeping your shots 
aligned, click the Automatic mode tab and then select a Blend mode:
	
•	 Simple Blending: Select the Simple Blending option, and Elements 
automatically blends the two images.
	
•	 Smart Blending: Select the Smart Blending option to access sliders to 
adjust the Highlights, Shadows, and Saturation settings for finer tun­
ing of the resulting images.
	
	 If you mess up things, click the Reset button.
	
4.	 If you feel the need for even more control, click the Manual mode tab.
	
5.	 In Manual mode, choose your first shot from the Photo Bin and drag it 
to the Final window.
	
	 If your other image isn’t already the source image, drag it from the 
Photo Bin to the Source window.
	
6.	 With the Pencil tool, draw over the well-exposed areas you want to 
retain in the source image.
	
	 As you draw, your final image shows the incorporation of those drawn 
areas, as shown in Figure 3-9.

slider.
	
	 Dragging to the right blends less of the source areas into the final image. 
Select the Edge blending option to get an even better blend of the two 
images.
	
9.	 If your photos aren’t aligning correctly, grab the Alignment tool under 
Advanced Options:
	
a.	 With the Alignment tool, click your source image and position the three 
target markers on three key locations.
	
b.	 Do the same on the final image, choosing similar locations.
	
10.	 Click the Align Photos button.
	
	 Again, as with the other Photomerge commands, the more alike your 
starting source images are (similar framing, similar angle, and so on), 
the better the merged result.
	
11.	 If you muck up things too badly, click the Reset button and then start 
at the appropriate step, depending on your mode.
	
	 If you’re in Automatic mode, start again from Step 3. If you’re in Manual 
mode, start again from Step 5.
	
12.	 When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
	
	 The file opens as a new, layered image in Elements. The blended image 
appears on Layer 1. The background is your starting final image. You 
can then flatten the layered file, which retains the appearance of Layer 1. 
Or you can double-click your background to convert it to a layer and 
then delete it by dragging it to the Trash icon in the Layers panel.
Blending Styles with Photomerge Style Match
You can match, or apply, the “style” of one image onto another image with the 
Photomerge Style Match feature. It’s hard to describe in words exactly what 
Adobe defines as style, but basically tonal properties are transferred from one 
image to another. But rather than read a definition of the feature, just spend a 
couple minutes trying this feature to get a feel for what it actually does.
Follow these steps to transfer a style from one image onto another:
	
1.	 Select a photo from your Photo Bin onto which you would like to 
transfer a style.
	
2.	 Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Style Match in any of the Photo Editor 
modes.
	
3.	 Your selected photo appears in the right window as your source 
(after) image, as shown in Figure 3-10.

546
Blending Styles with Photomerge Style Match
Figure 3-10: Copy a style from one image to another.
	
4.	 Drag an image from the Style Bin to the left window to act as your 
sample (Style) image from which your desired style will be 
transferred.
	
5.	 To add more images to the Style Bin, click the green plus sign and 
choose to either add sample images from the Organizer or from your 
hard drive.
	
6.	 Adjust the following sliders:
	
•	 Intensity: Specifies the intensity or strength of the style transfer. Keep 
the number low to blend more of the original image with the styled 
image.
	
•	 Clarity: Specifies how clearly the style transfer appears.
	
•	 Details: Enhances or decreases details in the styled image.
	
	 The results depend on your chosen images, so experiment with the pre­
ceding options to get the desired result.

ouldn’t it be nice if a mentor could sit behind you and walk you 
through the necessary steps every time you encounter a new fea­
ture in a program?
Photoshop Elements doesn’t provide you with a robot mentor to instruct 
you on the best way to perform an edit, but it does offer you the next best 
thing in the form of the Guided panel. In this chapter, we show you how to 
use the Guided panel and describe all it has to offer you.
Understanding Guided Mode
The Guided panel provides you easy control over impor­
tant editing tasks that you perform routinely when 
working on images.
Click the Guided button at the top of the Photo 
Editor window. The Guided workspace opens and 
reveals the panel of available guided edits, shown 
in Figure 4-1.
As shown in Figure 4-1, the Guided panel is divided 
into three categories. Within each category, you will 
find edits that relate to the respective category. Here 
are your choices:
	
✓	Touchups: Here you find the kinds of edits frequently used 
to fix and retouch photos. Cropping, rotating, correcting contrast 
and color, fixing flaws, and sharpening photos are part of this group. 
Elements 12 also offers a new edit — Restore Old Photo.

550
Walking through Touchups
	
✓	Photo Effects: With these edits, you can easily apply 
a variety of different filters that produce many dif­
ferent effects, such as line drawings, old-fashioned 
photos, saturated film, and others. Elements 12 
offers one new edit — Zoom Burst Effect.
	
✓	Photo Play: This category includes edits with sev­
eral effects that are pure fun, such as taking a photo 
and creating a puzzle effect (new to Elements 12), 
turning your image into pop art, creating a reflection 
of your image, and having part of a photo appear as 
if it were jumping out of the frame (out of bounds).
	
Here are few general tips to keep in mind when working 
in Guided mode:
	
✓	In applying any guided edit, choose Unit➪Undo to 
undo a particular step.
	
✓	To reset the particular panel, click the Reset icon 
(blue curved arrow) in the upper right of the 
Guided panel.
	
✓	To view an online video tutorial, click the white 
arrow on a blue square icon located in the upper 
right of the Guided panel.
	
✓	For Help, click the question mark icon located in 
the upper right of the Guided panel.
Walking through Touchups
The edits in this workflow help you perform the kinds 
of basic tasks frequently used in most of your Elements 
editing sessions. When you choose Crop Photo, for 
example, the Crop instructions and options appear in 
the Guided panel with the Crop tool selected and a crop 
frame drawn on the photo. Similar steps are also pro­
vided for straightening a photo. You might use this fea­
ture frequently when scanning photos. Other frequently 
used edits include correcting contrast and color and 
sharpening your images.
Adjusting contrast and color
Adjusting the contrast and color is among the most important and frequent 
edits you make on photos.

panel.

You’ll want to always adjust contrast first and then color. Often, by simply 
adjusting the contrast of your image, you will also fix some color issues 
simultaneously.
Under the Touchups workflow are several edits that involve both contrast 
and color, such as Brightness and Contrast, Lighten and Darken, and 
Enhance Colors. Selecting one of these edits changes the panel view to one 
where you can either click an Auto adjustment 
button or, for more control, move various sliders 
to make adjustments. The fixes you can perform 
here are pretty straightforward; with the help 
offered in the panel, making these kinds of 
adjustments is intuitive and easy.
Using the Levels adjustment
Things get a bit more complicated when you 
start using the Levels adjustment. The Levels 
adjustment is one of the most effective features 
in correcting the contrast of an image. We go 
into quite a bit of detail about Levels in 
Chapter 2 of this minibook. Be sure to read 
that chapter when you want to figure out more 
about using this important dialog box.
	
It’s a good idea to use Levels by making an 
adjustment layers. That way you have maximum 
editing flexibility later. You can find more infor­
mation on creating and using adjustment layers 
in Book VI, Chapter 1.
Creating an adjustment layer and applying set­
tings from the Levels dialog box can be a little 
confusing. The Guided panel, fortunately, breaks 
down the complicated steps into easy-to-follow 
instructions to assist you in making the edits. 
Here’s an overview of how you can edit along 
with help from the panel:
	
1.	 Select the Levels option in the Guided 
panel.
	
	 The panel view changes to the one shown in 
Figure 4-2. Here you find helpful information 
explaining how to use the Levels dialog box 
and what the histograms mean.
Figure 4-2: The Levels panel.

552
Walking through Touchups
	
2.	 Read the information contained in the panel.
	
	 When you start with this edit, we recommend reading all the help infor­
mation before you make the adjustments.
	
3.	 Click the Create Levels Adjustment button.
	
	 The New Layer dialog box opens.
	
4.	 Type a name for the new adjustment layer and then click OK.
	
	 The Levels dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 4-3.
	
5.	 From the information you 
obtained in the Guided panel, 
move the shadows (black trian­
gle), midtones (gray triangle), 
or highlights (white triangle) 
sliders in the Levels dialog box 
to make your corrections.
	
6.	 Click OK to accept the correc­
tions and exit the Levels 
dialog box.
	
	 Or if you’ve mucked things up, 
you can click Reset to start 
again.
	
7.	 Click Done in the Levels panel to get back to the main panel.
Correcting color in the Guided panel
The three best commands you find for color correction in the Guided panel 
help you improve the color in your photos:
	
✓	Enhance Colors: You get sliders to adjust hue, saturation, and lightness.
	
✓	Remove a Color Cast: Use the Eyedropper to sample a medium-gray 
tone, and Elements corrects color in the image. For more information on 
removing color casts, see Chapter 2 of this minibook.
	
✓	Correct Skin Tones: One of the most important color adjustments you 
can make is adjusting skin tones. The Correct Skin Tones panel provides 
you with an Eyedropper tool. Click a person’s skin, and the color is 
adjusted to match that neutral tone for the entire image. You can tweak 
the color for skin tones by moving the sliders in the panel.

Sharpening a photo
An important edit listed under Touchups is Sharpen. This is another edit 
you’ll make frequently when working on your photos in Elements. To get a 
feel for using the Sharpen command in Guided mode, do the following:
	
1.	 Open a photo in Guided mode.
	
2.	 In the Guided panel, in the Touchups workflow, click Sharpen.
	
	 The panel changes to display the instructions and options you have for 
sharpening a photo, as shown in Figure 4-4.
Figure 4-4: See a before-and-after display of the original and edited versions beside each other.
	
3.	 Change the view in the Image window.
	
	 By default, your photo appears in the Image window in a maximized 
After Only view. You can view your photo with a before-and-after view 
where the original photo appears unedited on the left side of the win­
dow and the edits you apply appear on the right side. To create a before-
and-after effect, click the down arrow where you see After Only in the 
upper left of the panel. You can also choose a vertical orientation.

554
Walking through Touchups
	
4.	 Click Auto Fix or adjust the Sharpen slider.
	
	 You have the option of clicking the Auto Fix button, and Elements makes 
a best-guess adjustment to sharpen the image. To manually sharpen the 
image, move the slider left and right.
	
5.	 Click Done at the bottom of the panel to apply the edits.
The advantage you have in using the Guided panel is that Elements offers 
helpful information to guide you through the edits.
	
The unique Perfect Portrait edit, shown in Figure 4-5, walks you through 
numerous steps to enhance your portrait. Start with fixing skin texture, add­
ing clarity by increasing contrast, enhancing facial features by using the 
healing tools, eliminating red-eye, darkening eyebrows, and whitening teeth. 
You’ll end by adding a dewy glow and, if you so desire, putting your portrait 
on a digital diet by using an edit to slim down the person. The process 
sounds complicated, but just follow the steps with this guided edit, and it’s a 
no-brainer. You’re sure to end up with a beauty, such as our mustachioed 
hipster shown in Figure 4-5.

Other commands under the Touchups workflow enable you to perform 
important tasks, such as fixing flaws (Scratches and Blemishes) to resizing 
an image without losing vital content (Recompose). You can find detailed 
information on all these edits throughout the book. This minibook in particu­
lar provides detailed explanations on fixing and enhancing images. Refer to 
the Table of Contents or the index for which book and chapter to find spe­
cific information.
	
The new Restore Old Photo edit enables you to restore your image by walk­
ing through the steps to remove cracks, fix discoloration, remove dust, and 
fix contrast and other flaws.
Enhancing with Photo Effects
Photo effects work like applying filters, which we cover extensively in 
Book VII, Chapters 1 and 2. Whereas the Filter Gallery dialog box provides 
you with many options to apply a filter, the Guided panel offers you filter 
effects and then takes you through steps for adjusting brightness values, 
changing hue and saturation, and making other adjustments to perfect the 
result.
You can choose from these many options:
	
✓	Depth of Field creates a sharp and blurry lens effect (see the next 
section).
	
✓	High Key creates a light-toned image of mostly white and grays. Click 
the Diffuse Glow option to create an even more dreamy photo, as shown 
in Figure 4-6.
	
✓	Line Drawing converts your photos to a pen-and-ink drawing.
	
✓	Lomo Camera Effect creates a cross-processed, vignetted effect.
	
✓	Low Key creates a dramatic, dark toned, chiaroscuro (Italian for “light-
dark”)–type image, as shown in Figure 4-6.
	
✓	Old Fashioned Photo gives your images a vintage, sepia appearance.
	
✓	Orton Effect gives a dreamy quality to your image by softening the focus 
and overexposing the image. (The upcoming section “Orton Effect” 
describes it in detail.)
	
✓	Saturated Slide Film Effect simulates the colors of saturated film used 
in film cameras (as opposed to digital cameras).
	
✓	Tilt-Shift effect creates a miniaturized effect by adjusting the focal plane.

556
Walking through Touchups
	
✓	Vignette Effect creates a darkening or lightening at the corners and out­
side edges around an image.
	
✓	Zoom Burst Effect creates the illusion of motion with focus on the cen­
ter of the image, as shown in Figure 4-6.

Figure 4-6: Apply the new Zoom Burst effect.
Depth of Field effect
This great edit in the Photo Effects workflow changes the appearance of the 
depth of field, which is defined as the areas of sharpness in relation to the 
focal point in your image. This edit is useful when your image has an overly 
busy background and is causing a distraction from your focal point. By mak­
ing the depth of field shallower (blurring the distracting background), your 
focal point becomes more prominent.
To apply this edit, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open a photo in Guided mode.
	
2.	 In the Guided panel, in the Photo Effects edits, click Depth of Field to 
open the panel.

3.	 Click either the Simple or Custom method in the panel.
	
	 Simple adds depth in one step (well, sort of; it consists of three sub­
steps), whereas Custom enables you to define the area you want to keep 
in focus.
	
	 We clicked Custom.
	
4.	 If you chose Custom, define the area you want to keep in focus in the 
Depth of Field-Custom panel.
	
	 We used the Quick Selection Tool to select the moody teenager, as 
shown in Figure 4-7.

5.	 Click the Add Blur button to blur the unselected areas and create a 
shallower depth of field; to increase the blur, drag the slider to the 
right.
	
6.	 Click Done after you’ve achieved your desired depth of field.
Orton Effect
To experiment a little, take a look at the Orton Effect option and follow these 
steps to produce an image with a dreamy appearance:

3.	 Click Add Orton Effect.
	
4.	 Use the sliders to increase the Blur and/or Noise, as shown in Figure 4-8.
	
5.	 Make the photo brighter by adjusting the Brightness slider.
	
6.	 Click Done to accept the effect and return to the main panel.
Playing with Photos
The Photo Play workflow of edits is just plain fun. To apply any of these 
edits, simply open a photo in Guided mode and click your desired effect. 
Then follow the steps explained, and if you like what you see, click Done. If 
you’re just doing a “look and see,” click Cancel to bail out and get back to 
the main Guided panel.
We applied the Pop Art edit to our image of a beautiful lady to get the inter­
esting collage shown in Figure 4-9. Finally, we applied the new Puzzle Effect 
to our image, as shown in Figure 4-10.

A

dobe Photoshop Elements offers a number of creations that you can 
share onscreen or in print. From both the Create and Share panels in 
the Task Pane in the Organizer and from within the Photo Editor Panel Bin 
(for Create only), you have menu choices for producing creations and shar­
ing your media.
In Chapter 3 of this minibook, we look at sharing files for 
screen and web viewing. In this chapter, we talk about cre­
ations designed for print and sharing.
Getting a Handle on Creations
In Chapter 3 of this minibook, we talk about online 
albums, attaching files to e-mails, using photo mail, 
and using online sharing services. All these creations 
offer different output options, such as e-mailing, 
burning files to a disc (Windows), creating HTML or 
PDF documents, as well as printing. You create them all 
using the Share panel.
You create the remaining creations — photo prints, photo 
books, photo collages, photo calendars, greeting cards, and print 
labels — via the Create panel. All these creations are designed for output to 
your printer or for sending files to an online printing service or to friends 
and family.

564
Getting a Handle on Creations
When you observe the Create panel 
in Windows and on the Macintosh, 
you see only one item not supported 
on the Macintosh, as shown in 
Figure 1-1.
	
When you make a creation that will 
ultimately be sent to an online ser­
vice or shared with other users, 
keep in mind that you first must 
select the photos you want in your 
creation. For example, before you 
create a photo book by clicking the 
Photo Book button in the Create 
panel, you need to select photos for 
your book. If you happen to click the 
Photo Book button and nothing hap­
pens, more than likely, you haven’t 
selected any photos.
You can select photos in either the 
Organizer or the Photo Bin in the 
Photo Editor. Note that the Instant 
Movie and DVD with Menu options 
appear only if you have installed 
Premiere Elements.
After selecting photos, click the 
Create button. Elements then opens 
a drop-down menu where options 
are listed for the type of creation 
you want to make. The options for 
Photo Book, Greeting Card, Photo 
Calendar, and Photo Collage all use the same wizard when you click one of 
the respective buttons in the Create panel. The remaining options, Photo 
Prints and Slide Show, use different wizards where options are selected.
Elements offers you some consistency when creating photo books, greeting 
cards, photo calendars, and photo collages. If you know how to set attributes for 
one of these creations, you can easily work with any of the other creation types.
After you make a creation, you can save it as a project that can also be 
added to the Organizer window. Photoshop Elements projects are saved as 
Photo Project Format with a .pse extension. If you want to return to a proj­
ect and make more edits, you can open the .pse file and edit your project. 
You can add .pse files to the Organizer and view them in the Media Browser 
so that they’re easily accessible if you choose to open a project and perform 
more edits.

Creating a Photo Book
You can design the creations you make for printing locally to your desktop 
printer or for uploading to a professional print service. The professional ser­
vices offer you choices for covers, assembly, paper stocks, and so on, as 
well as opportunities to distribute the printed material to friends and family.
Photo books follow a sequence of steps that are the same for other creations 
you make in Elements. To describe completely the process for making a cre­
ation, we start by showing you how to create a photo book.
Follow these steps to create a photo book (the same steps are used for cre­
ating greeting cards, photo calendars, and photo collages):
	
1.	 Select files in the Organizer and click the Create tab. Or, open several 
photos in the Photo Editor, select the open files in the Photo Bin, and 
click the Create tab.
	
	 You begin working with creations following the same procedure. You 
first select files in the Organizer or photos in the Photo Bin in the Photo 
Editor and then click the Create tab in the Organizer Task Pane or Photo 
Editor Panel Bin. Ideally, you might start with an album containing the 
photos you want to use for your photo book. (See Book II, Chapter 3, for 
more on creating albums.) You can then just click the album to display 
the album photos in the Organizer window and easily select all the pho­
tos or select an album directly in the Photo Bin in the Photo Editor.
	
	 To select all photos shown in the Organizer’s Media Browser or the 
Photo Editor Photo Bin, press Ctrl+A (⌘+A on the Mac).
	
2.	 Open the Create drop-down menu and choose Photo Book.
	
	 Whether you’re working in the Organizer or the Photo Editor, the Photo 
Book option is available in the same Create drop-down menu in the 
Panel Bin. When you click the Photo Book menu item, a wizard opens, 
and you can make choices for the output and the design of your cre­
ation. The same wizard opens for other creations, such as greeting 
cards, photo calendars, and photo collages.
	
3.	 Choose an option for outputting your creation.
	
	 In the left pane shown in Figure 1-2, you make a choice for either printing 
your creation or using the Shutterfly online service. For both Print Locally 
and Shutterfly, you have options for choosing the size of your output.
	
4.	 Select a theme.
	
	 In the middle column, choose a theme for the photo book design. When 
you click a theme, the preview pane on the right side of the window dis­
plays a preview of the selected theme. Elements uses an Adobe Flash 
interface where you see photo book pages automatically scroll using the 
selected theme.

566
Creating a Photo Book
Figure 1-2: Select photos and click the Photo Book option to open the Photo Book wizard.
	
	 At this point, click different themes and observe the Preview pane for a 
dynamic display of the respective theme. Take a little time to look over 
all the wonderful options you have for a photo book design.
	
	 The first time you use a Theme or other asset in the Graphics panel, 
Elements downloads the Asset to your computer. The assets are stored 
on Adobe’s website. You must wait until the download finishes before 
you can continue.
	
5.	 Type the number of pages in the Number of Pages text box.
	
	 By default, Elements adds a title page and two additional pages no mat­
ter how many photos you select for your album. Count the total photos 
you intend to use and type the number of photos in the text box. You 
can add or delete pages when you’re in the the Creation wizard.
	
6.	 Click OK and then examine the pages.
	
	 When you click OK, the Create panel changes and displays three buttons 
at the bottom of the panel. As shown in Figure 1-3, the buttons open 
panes for Pages, Layouts, and Graphics. When you open each pane, you 
can make additional edits. By default, when creating photo albums, the 
pane in view is the Pages pane, shown in Figure 1-3. In the Pages pane, 
look over the total number of pages for your photo book. You can scroll 
pages by clicking the left/right arrows at the top of the Image window 
(see Figure 1-3) or by double-clicking pages in the Pages panel.

8.	 Adjust a photo in a frame.
	
	 If you change a layout or add more photos to 
placeholders, or even if you let Elements 
populate a layout, you may want to make 
adjustments for individual photos within 
placeholders.
	
	 To edit a photo within a placeholder, double-
click the photo. A toolbar appears above the 
photo, as shown in Figure 1-5. From left to 
right on the toolbar, you can
	
•	 Zoom in or out of the photo by dragging 
the slider left and right.
	
•	 Rotate the photo by clicking the blue 
icon. (Each mouse click rotates the 
photo 90 degrees.)
	
•	 Get a new photo to place in the frame 
represented by the folder icon.
	
•	 Commit the current operation. You click 
the green check mark to accept your 
edits.
	
•	 Cancel the current operation. Click the 
last icon above the image to cancel your 
edits.
	
	 You can also size a photo within a frame by 
clicking one of the handles on the selected 
image and dragging in to reduce size or out 
to size up. Move the cursor just outside a 
corner handle on a selected frame, and you 
can rotate the image and frame together.
	
	 If you double-click a photo in a 
frame, you can open a context 
menu (right-click or Control-
click a one-button mouse on a 
Macintosh) and choose from 
some transformation options 
that include scaling, perspec­
tive, and distorting the photo. 
Choose a menu command and 
drag a handle to perform the 
operation.
	
	 You can skew an image by 
pressing Ctrl or Option (Mac) 
and dragging a corner handle.

	 To change the background or frames, 
­double-click a background and/or frame in 
the Graphics pane. To add a graphic, click 
and drag the graphic to the Image window 
where a photo page is displayed.
	
10.	 (Optional) Switch to Advanced mode to edit 
images and the layers.
	
	 Click the Advanced Mode button (refer to 
Figure 1-3) to open Advanced mode, where 
you find more editing options, as shown in 
Figure 1-7. You can edit the layers for further 
customization of the photos in your photo 
book. To do so, you need to know a lot about 
working with layers, layer styles, and layer 
effects, as we explain throughout Book VI. 
Also, you have access to the Expert Photo 
Editor Tools panel, where you can apply 
edits to images as well as have full access to 
menu commands.
	
11.	 Click the Basic Mode button if you’re in 
Advanced mode and look over the project.
	
	 Now you’re ready to take the last steps to

Making a Photo Calendar
Getting in Touch with Greeting Cards
In Photoshop Elements, creating greeting cards like the one shown in 
Figure 1-9 is a snap. Here’s how to create a card by using the Greeting Card 
panel:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer and select 
a photo or open a photo in the 
Photo Editor.
	
2.	 Open the Create menu in the 
Panel Bin and select Greeting 
Card.
	
3.	 Follow the same steps as you 
do when creating photo books, 
which we cover in the previous 
section.
	
	 First choose the output source 
(local printer or Shutterfly); 
then choose a theme and click 
OK. Click the Print button at the 
bottom of the wizard to open 
the Print dialog box if printing 
locally on your printer.
When you make creations and use the 
templates provided by Elements, your 
photos automatically are assigned a 
photo frame. In most cases, you’ll 
want to eliminate the frame and use 
one of your own choosing. We talk 
about how to clear photo frames and 
add new frames in a web extra for 
­creating calendars that you can find 
at www.dummies.com/extras/
photoshopelements12.
Making a Photo Calendar
Are you ready to design a personal calendar using your favorite photos? 
Elements helps you design an attractive calendar of the kids, the girls’ soc­
cer team, the Bullhead Moose fraternity, or any other type of activity or 
event you want to work with. Elements makes it easy to create professional-
looking calendars.

Making a Photo Calendar
There’s quite a bit to creating calendars in Elements. For more information 
on creating calendars and also making your own custom calendars, see our 
two web extras at www.dummies.com/extras/photoshopelements12.
Here’s how you create a calendar that can be ordered and professionally 
printed via an online service:
	
1.	 Select photos in the Organizer. Alternately, you can open images in 
the Photo Editor and select the open photos in the Photo Bin.
	
	 For calendars, you might want to select 13 photos — one photo for the 
calendar cover and one photo for each month. You can also choose 12 
photos and use one of the calendar months for the cover photo.
	
2.	 Open the Create drop-down menu in the Panel Bin and click the Photo 
Calendar option.
	
3.	 Choose an output source the same as when choosing a source for 
photo books.
	
4.	 Follow the same steps that we outline in the section “Creating a Photo 
Book,” earlier in this chapter.
When saving creations, you have a choice to save as a Photoshop Elements 
Project (*.pse) or as an Adobe PDF (*.pdf) file. In Figure 1-10, we saved a 
calendar as a PDF document and opened it in Adobe Reader.

Assembling a Photo Collage
To put together a photo collage (see 
Figure 1-11), you first need to select a 
few photos in the Organizer or the 
Photo Bin and then click the Photo 
Collage option in the Create panel.
The Photo Collage wizard opens, and 
you follow the same steps that we 
cover in the earlier section “Creating 
a Photo Book.”
Creating a Slide Show
 ­(Windows Only)
We have to make some choices for 
the amount of coverage we can 
devote to each feature in Photoshop 
Elements. Sometimes it involves 
some trade-offs. Because the process 
for making creations earlier in this 
chapter is vitally important to four creation types, we feel it’s more valuable 
to most readers than a thorough coverage of slide shows, especially because 
Macintosh users can’t use this feature.
That said, this section includes a brief description for many of the toggles, 
switches, and commands that are available for producing slide shows. Most 
of what you find in the Slide Show window is straightforward and intuitive. In 
addition, we address many options from the Slide Show Editor (shown a lit­
tle later in Figure 1-13) in other chapters throughout this book.
If creating slide shows is important to you and you need more details on 
some of the options available, search through the Elements Help system to 
fill in the gaps.
Creating slide shows follows the same initial steps as you find with other 
creations. To create a slide show using the Create panel, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the images you want in the Organizer or Photo Bin, click the 
Create tab, and then click the Slide Show option.
Figure 1-11: Photo collages are a snap to 
create in Elements.

Creating a Slide Show ­(Windows Only) 
	
	 The first thing you see is the 
Slide Show Preferences dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 1-12.
	
	 You make choices in this dia­
log box for setting up your 
slide show — stuff such as set­
ting transition type, adjusting 
transition duration, adding 
music, and adding background 
color.
	
2.	 Choose your slide show settings 
and click OK when you’re 
done.
	
	 The Slide Show Editor opens, as 
shown in Figure 1-13.
	
3.	 Define the attributes, such as 
transitions, artwork from the 
Extras panel, zooms, and time 
codes.

	 To add transitions, click the right-pointing arrow adjacent to the transi­
tion icon appearing between slides and choose the transition effect you 
want from the pop-up menu.
	
	 Other choices you have for creating slide shows include adding graphics 
by dragging items from the Graphics panel and adding text by clicking 
the Text tab in the Extras panel and then double-clicking one of the type 
styles in the Extras panel.
	
4.	 Size, rotate, and perform image editing in the Properties panel.
	
	 The Properties panel offers you editing options that we discuss through­
out this book.
	
5.	 (Optional) Add audio by opening the Add Media menu at the top of 
the dialog box. Choose Audio from Elements Organizer or Audio from 
Folder.
	
	 You can have Elements fit the slide duration to the audio duration. Add 
the audio and click the Fit Slides to Audio button.
	
6.	 Choose an output option.
	
	 Click the Output button at the top of the dialog box (refer to Figure 1-13), 
and the Slide Show Output dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-14.

	 In the dialog box, you have several options from which to choose:
	
•	 Save as a File: Click Save as a File, and in the right pane, you can 
select from two options: Movie File or PDF File.

	 Select Movie File to export the file as a video in WMV or QuickTime 
format. From the Slide Size drop-down menu, choose an option for 
the media size. 
	
	 Select PDF File to export the file as an Adobe PDF document.
	
•	 Burn to Disc: Click Burn to Disc to write a self-running VCD (Video 
CD). Note that if you choose to write a VCD, the image resolution is 
much lower than writing slide shows to DVDs.
	
•	 Edit with Premiere Elements Editor: This option works only if you have 
Adobe Premiere Elements installed on your computer. If you do have 
Premiere Elements, clicking this option opens the slide show in 
Premiere Elements.
	
7.	 Click OK in the dialog box after making the output choice.
	
	 Elements outputs your slide show using the settings you applied.
Working with Photo Prints
When you open the Create panel and click the Photo Prints option, you find 
options for printing files locally on your desktop printer and ordering prints 
from online services.
Printing to your desktop printer
When you click Photo Prints on the Create drop-down menu, the panel dis­
plays options for printing to your local printer or ordering online prints with 
a professional print service (see Figure 1-15).
Click the Local Printer option in the 
Photo Prints panel and the Print dia­
log box opens. This action is no dif­
ferent than choosing File➪Print in 
the Organizer or in the Photo Editor. 
In all cases, the Print dialog box 
opens where you set attributes for 
the print output.
The other options you have for local 
printing are Picture Package and 
Contact Sheet. These options are 
also available in the Print dialog box.
Figure 1-15: The Photo Prints panel.

Chapter 1
Creating Elements 
Projects
Working with Photo Prints
For local printing and the options you can use, see Chapter 2 of this mini­
book, where we thoroughly discuss local printing of individual photos, pic­
ture packages, and contact sheets.
Ordering prints online
You can order prints online by using only the Shutterfly online service. 
When you mouse over Shutterfly, a pop-up box provides some information 
about the service, as shown in Figure 1-15.
When you click Order Prints from Shutterfly, a wizard opens and walks you 
through the steps for setting up an account and ordering prints. You also 
find options for choosing the address or addresses where you want your 
prints to be shipped. You can have one set of prints sent to your address 
and duplicate prints sent to family and friends.
	
Online print services were once the cat’s meow for photo distribution. 
However, in recent years, sharing photos via social services such as Facebook, 
Flickr, Myspace, and Adobe Revel has proven to be much faster and much 
more efficient — and more environmentally conscious. Unless you have a 
good reason for having photo prints, join us in using one of the many social 
service networks that we explain in Chapter 3 of this minibook. The social net­
works are much more efficient and less costly than using a print service.
Printing to Adobe PDF
All the print options you have in Elements can 
be saved as PDF documents. Rather than col­
lect printed paper documents for items such 
as calendars, greeting cards, and photo col­
lages, you can make your creations and save 
to PDF files. You can then share these files on 
your social network connections.
To output a creation to PDF, you need a little 
help from another application. You have two 
choices in Windows:
	✓	Purchase Adobe Acrobat Standard or 
Pro and use the Adobe PDF printer driver 
that’s installed with your program instal­
lation. Simply choose the Adobe PDF from 
the Select Printer drop-down menu in the 
Print dialog box and click OK. Your file is 
then printed to disk as a PDF file.
	✓	Download a free PDF printer driver, such 
as pdf995. You can find several PDF print­
er drivers available for free download by 
searching the Internet. After a driver is in­
stalled, it appears as a printer. You follow 
the same steps as for printing to Adobe 
PDF. Select the printer driver in the Print 
dialog box and click OK, and the file is then 
printed in PDF format.
Macintosh users don’t need to be concerned 
with printer drivers. Output to PDF is built into 
OS X. When you choose File➪Print, click the 
PDF drop-down menu and select Save as PDF. 
Your file is saved as a PDF document that can 
be viewed in the free Adobe Reader software 
or with OS X’s Preview application.

Getting Organized with CD/DVD Labels
Getting Organized with CD/DVD Labels
Another creation option in Elements is a simple, easy way to create CD and 
DVD labels. From the Create panel, choose a menu item for CD Jacket, DVD 
Jacket, or CD/DVD Label from the More Options drop-down list. From tem­
plates provided in the panel, Elements offers you an easy method for print­
ing your personalized labels and jackets for CDs and DVDs.
	
This feature for printing CD/DVD labels is a bit weak in Elements. You may 
need to fiddle around quite a bit to get the images to fit a label. Using some 
templates provided by the label developers is often a much better method 
for printing labels.
Creating a DVD with a Menu
Creating a DVD with a menu is supported in both Windows and on the 
Macintosh; however, you need to have Adobe Premiere Elements installed to 
create a DVD with a menu. In Windows, you can create slide shows and use 
the slide shows when creating a DVD with a menu. On the Macintosh, you 
need movie files that can be created from still images using Adobe Premiere 
Elements, Apple’s iMovie, or Apple’s iPhoto.

e live in an ever-changing world when it comes to technology and 
the way we consume content. When it comes to showing off your 
photos, you have many alternatives to printing pictures. You can, for exam­
ple, show slide shows and photo collections on cellphones, tablet devices, 
laptops, and computer systems. Each of these methods, over time, becomes 
a low-cost alternative to purchasing printers, papers, and inks.
With the advent of the Apple iPad and many more tablet devices, you 
can find some superb mechanisms for displaying photo albums, 
slide shows, and individual pictures. All your data can be 
stored in the cloud (that is, on the Internet by using 
Facebook, Adobe Revel, Flickr, iCloud, and so on), so 
you don’t need to worry about losing precious 
photos.
As you review this chapter, think of printing as a 
last resort for displaying albums of photos. At 
times, though, you may need to print a picture, and 
this chapter is designed to inform you of many 
issues to know if and when you must print a photo.
In this chapter, we talk about options — many 
options — for setting print attributes for printing to your 
own color printer. If you need to, reread this chapter a few 
times just to be certain that you understand the process for 
printing good-quality images. A little time spent here will, we hope, 
save you some headaches down the road.

Getting Images Ready for Printing
Getting Images Ready for Printing
Perhaps the greatest challenge for individuals using programs such as 
Photoshop Elements (and even for the professionals who use its grand­
daddy, Adobe Photoshop) is turning what they see on the monitor into a rea­
sonable facsimile on a printed page. You can find all sorts of books on color 
printing — how to get color right, how to calibrate your equipment, and how 
to create and use color profiles — all for the purpose of getting a good 
match between your computer monitor and your printer. It’s downright dis­
couraging to spend a lot of time tweaking an image so that all the brilliant 
blue colors jump out on your computer monitor, only to find that all those 
blues turn to murky purples when the photo is printed.
If you’ve already read Book III (especially Chapters 2, 3, and 5), you’re ahead 
of the game because you know a little bit about color management, color 
profiles, and printer resolutions. After you check out those chapters, your 
next step is to get to know your printer or your print service center and 
understand how to correctly print your pictures.
The first step toward getting your photos to your desktop printer or to a 
printing service is to prepare each image for optimum output. You have sev­
eral considerations when you’re preparing files, including the ones in this list:
	
✓	Set resolution and size. Before you print a file, use the Image Size dialog 
box (choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size) to set your image size and the 
optimum resolution for your printer. Files that have too much resolution 
can print images that are inferior to files optimized for a printer. See 
your printer’s documentation for recommendations for resolution. As a 
general rule, 300 ppi (pixels per inch) works best for most printers print­
ing on high-quality paper. If you print on plain paper, you often find that 
lower resolutions work just as well or even better.
	
✓	Make all brightness and color corrections before printing. It stands to 
reason that you want to ensure that your pictures appear their best 
before sending them off to your printer. If your monitor is properly cali­
brated, as we discuss in Book III, Chapter 5, you should see a fair repre­
sentation of what your pictures will look like after they’re printed.
	
✓	Decide how color will be managed before you print. You can color-
manage output to your printer in three ways, as we discuss in the next 
section. Know your printer’s profiles and how to use them before you 
start to print your files.
	
✓	Get your printer ready. Finally, when printing to desktop color printers, 
always be certain that your ink cartridges have sufficient ink and that 
the nozzles are clean. Make sure that you use the proper settings for 
paper and ink when you send a file to your printer. Be sure to review the 
manual that came with your printer to know how to perform all the 
steps required to make a quality print.

Setting Print Options
Setting Print Options
As you might expect, you print files from Elements by choosing File➪Print. 
Choose the same menu command from either workspace to open the Print 
dialog box. On the Mac when you choose File➪Print, you are automatically 
switched to the Photo Editor, where all Mac printing is performed.
	
You have only one difference between using the Print dialog box from the 
Organizer and the Print dialog box from the Photo Editor. In the Color 
Management settings in the More Options dialog box, the Organizer doesn’t 
permit you to manage color like you find when using the Photo Editor’s Print 
dialog box. All other options are identical in both dialog boxes.
You have a number of settings to adjust when printing color photos from the 
Photo Editor, as we explain a little later in the section “Printing with Color 
Profiles.” For now, take a look at the different options you have in the print 
dialog boxes that you open from the Organizer and from the Photo Editor.
Printing from the Organizer
You can print photos from either the Organizer or in the Photo Editor in 
Windows. On the Macintosh, you can choose File➪Print in the Organizer, but 
Elements redirects your output to the Photo Editor. For the moment, we skip 
color management and look at settings identical in the Print dialog box from 
the Organizer and the one from the Photo Editor.
You can select one or more images in the Organizer and then choose 
File➪Print. The images selected when you choose the Print command 
appear in a scrollable list, as shown in Figure 2-1. Likewise, you can select 
multiple photos in the Photo Bin in the Photo Editor and print them 
similarly.
Options you have in the Prints dialog box include
	
A.	Image thumbnails: When you select multiple images in the Organizer, all 
the selected images appear in a scrollable window on the left side of the 
dialog box.
	
B.	Scroll bar: When so many photos are selected that they all can’t be 
viewed in the thumbnail list on the left side of the dialog box, you can 
use the scroll bar to see all images.

Using Change Settings
When you click the Change Settings 
button in the Print/Prints dialog box, 
the Change Settings dialog box 
opens for the printer you have 
selected on the Select Printer drop-
down menu. In Figure 2-3, we 
opened the Change Settings dialog 
box for an Epson Stylus T40W 
printer. In this dialog box, you can 
make a few selections for print attri­
butes that may be unique to your 
printer. However, for most desktop 
printers, the options you find in the 
Change Settings dialog box can be 
controlled in the Print/Prints dialog 
box.
Using Printer Properties
Click the Advanced Settings button 
in the Change Settings dialog box 
and you arrive at various settings 
for your printer. This dialog box will 
vary with options and the display 
according to your printer. For an Epson printer, you arrive at the Main tab in 
the Printer Properties where the current ink levels are shown, and you see a 
menu where you can make a choice for the paper you use, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.

The default selection in this dialog box is Printing Choices. The choices 
available for printing your photos include
	
✓	Photo Details: Select the check boxes for the detail items you want to 
have printed in your output below the image.
	
✓	Border: If you select the Thickness check box, you can specify the size 
of the border in the text box and choose a unit of measure in the drop-
down list. Click the color swatch to choose a color for the border.
	
✓	Iron-On Transfer: This option is used for heat transfer material: Mylar, 
Lexjet, and other substrates that require e-down printing — emulsion-
down printing — where the negative and the image are flipped.
	
✓	Trim Guidelines: Select the Print Crop Marks check box to add marks to 
the print to show where the paper needs to be trimmed.
The other two items in the More Options dialog box are Custom Print Size 
and Color Management. Click Custom Print Size, and you can define the 
width and height for custom papers.
Color Management is something we cover in detail later in this chapter in 
the section “Printing with Color Profiles.”
Printing Multiple Images
You have choices in the Organizer or the Photo Editor for choosing a com­
mand for printing multiple images as either a contact sheet or picture pack­
age. When you choose to print a contact sheet or picture package from 
within the Photo Editor, Elements switches you to the Organizer view. You 
continue the action from the Organizer and leave the Photo Editor.
Printing contact sheets
In traditional photography, people used contact sheets to get a print from a 
roll of film. Rather than viewing negatives, a photographer could see a 
thumbnail print of each frame on a roll in a few contact sheets. These con­
tact sheets revealed how the frames would appear when printed.
You can get the same results in Elements by printing contact sheets from a 
collection of photos. By looking over the thumbnails and choosing which 
photos to print at larger sizes, you save money on your printer 
consumables.
To print a contact sheet, do the following:
	
1.	 In Windows, open the Organizer. On the Mac, you need to open the 
Photo Editor.

in the Photo Editor.
	
	 Ctrl-click in Windows (⌘-click on the Mac) to choose multiple photos in a 
noncontiguous selection. You can also sort photos by keyword tags, 
albums, dates, and so on. You then select all the sorted photos by press­
ing Ctrl/⌘+A. For more information on sorting files, see Book II, Chapter 2.
	
3.	 Choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P (⌘+P) and select a printer.
	
	 The Prints dialog box opens in Windows. On the Mac, choose File➪

9.	 Click the Print button (back in the Prints/Print dialog box) to print 
your contact sheet. On the Mac, choose File➪Print to print the newly 
created document.
Printing picture packages
Another option you have for printing multiple photos is picture packages. 
This feature prints multiple copies of the same photo or multiple copies of 
many photos.
A picture package is typically a single sheet of paper with the same photo 
printed at different sizes — something like your class pictures, graduation 
photos, or prom photos. You can choose to print a single picture package 
from one photo selected in the Organizer, or you can select multiple photos 
and print them all as multiple picture packages.
To create a picture package, do the following:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer.
	
2.	 Select a single photo or multiple photos in the Organizer that you 
want to print as a picture package(s).
	
3.	 Choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P.
	
	 The Prints/Print dialog box opens on Windows. On the Mac, you are 
switched to the Photo Editor. Cancel out of the Print dialog box and 
choose File➪Picture Package.

Printing with Color Profiles
All the options we’ve talked about so far in this chapter give you a picture on 
paper, but even if you follow all the steps up to this point to a T, you may 
still not get the color right. To print the most accurate color you can on your 
printer, use printer profiles that are created for every printer, paper, and ink 
set you use.
	
Printer developers create printer profiles for use with the developers’ inks 
and papers. If you decide to modify your printer and use large ink bottles or 
use lower-cost inks from third-party suppliers, the profiles from your printer 
developer aren’t optimized for the change in ink pigments. Likewise, third-
party papers aren’t optimized for the printer profiles shipped by your 
printer developer.
	
To get accurate color when you use inks and papers different from those 
recommended by your printer developer, you may need to develop custom 
profiles for each ink set and each paper. You can search the Internet to find 
several sources of services that create custom profiles for you.
Working with color printer profiles
In Book III, Chapter 5, we talk about creating color profiles for your monitor 
and selecting a color workspace. The final step in a color-managed workflow 
is to convert color from the profile of your color workspace to the color pro­
file of your printer. Basically, this conversion means that the colors you see 
on your monitor in your current workspace are accurately converted to the 
color that your printer can reproduce.
Understanding how Elements uses color profiles
When using the Print dialog box (or the More Options section of the Print 
dialog box), you can manage color in Photoshop Elements in one of three 
ways when it comes time to print your files:
	
✓	Printer Manages Colors: This method permits your printer to decide 
which profile is used when your photo is printed to your desktop color 
printer. Your printer makes this decision according to the paper you 
select as the source paper used to print your photos. If you choose Epson 
Premium Glossy Photo Paper, for example, your printer chooses the pro­
file that goes along with that particular paper. If you choose another 

591
Book IX 
Chapter 2
Getting It Printed
Printing with Color Profiles
paper, your printer chooses a different color profile. This method is auto­
matic, and color profile selection is made when you print your file.
	
✓	Photoshop Elements Manages Color: When you make this choice, color 
management is taken away from your printer and is controlled by 
Elements. You must choose a color profile after making this choice in 
the Print dialog box. Desktop printers that fall in the medium to more 
expensive range often have many color profiles that they can install.
	
✓	No Color Management: You use this choice if you have a color profile 
embedded in one of your pictures. You’ll probably rarely use this option. 
Unless you know how to embed profiles or receive files with embedded 
profiles from other users, don’t make this choice in the Print dialog box.
Each of these options requires you to make a choice about how color is man­
aged. You make choices (as we discuss later in this chapter, when we walk 
you through the steps for printing) about whether to color-manage your out­
put. These selections are all unique to the Print dialog box for your individ­
ual printer.
Understanding your printer’s profiles
A few years ago, we recommended using Epson printers for users who 
wanted to achieve the best color output from desktop printers. The reason 
was that Epson took the lead in color profile development and offered the 
best profiles one could find for these printers.
However, in recent years, we find that color profile support for the best 
printer developers is equally supported. You find excellent results using HP, 
Canon, and Epson printers. These three developers have created support 
and help information as well as good color profiles to support their devices.
You can find a wealth of information on the Internet for using color profiles 
with printers from each of these manufacturers. For starters, take a look at 
the following URLs for more information about printing using color profiles.

Printing to Inkjet Printers
Printing to Inkjet Printers
Printers are installed on your computer with printer drivers that are 
designed to offer you settings and controls for options that are unique to 
your printer. We can’t hope to cover all printers and the variations you find 
with each device.
What we can do is give you a general idea of the printing process by showing 
how it’s done with Epson printers — one of the more popular desktop 
printer manufacturers on the market. This overview gives you a basis for 
understanding the settings you need to adjust when printing color to desk­
top printers and submitting photos to service providers.
	
If you own a different brand of printer or use a service that uses other print­
ers, what’s important to remember in reviewing this section is the process 
involved in printing your files. Regardless of what type of printer you own, 
be aware of when a color profile is used and how color is either managed or 
not managed. You may have different check box selections and menu com­
mands, but the process is the same for any printer printing your photos.
Over the past few years, at least half of the many service-provider trouble­
shooting tech calls coming from clients involved problems with accurate 
color output from Epson and some other inkjet printers. We’re not talking 
about subtle changes between monitor and printer, but huge, monstrous 
color changes on output prints. As it turns out, almost all the strange output 
results originated from just one minor error that occurred when the file 
was set up to print — it involved when and how to manage color in the Print 
dialog box.
	
Color profiles also depend upon the ink being used and the paper stock you 
use. Refilling cartridges with generic ink can (in some cases) result in color 
shifts. Similarly, if the nozzles aren’t clean and delivering ink consistently, 
your results may look very strange.
We’ve come up with settings that enable you to get accurate results without 
stress or frustration. Just remember to use the settings exactly as described, 
and you can achieve superior results with either desktop or professional 
printers.
When you install your printer driver, the installation utility also installs a 
number of color profiles. You can choose the profiles in the Photoshop 
Elements Print dialog box and control all the printing by using the profile 
provided by your printer manufacturer.

593
Book IX 
Chapter 2
Getting It Printed
Printing to Inkjet Printers
	
You can also print from the Organizer (Windows) by selecting one or more 
image thumbnails in the Organizer window and then choosing File➪Print. 
However, printing from the Organizer won’t give you optimum support when 
using color profiles. As a matter of practice, never print from the Organizer’s 
workspace for anything other than contact sheets. You have more control 
using the Photo Editor and more choices for color profile management.
You have two choices for how color profiles are used. You can
	
✓	Choose to let your printer manage color: The profiling selection is auto­
matic, and you don’t have to worry about making other choices in the 
Print dialog boxes.
	
✓	Choose to let Photoshop Elements manage color: In this case, you need 
to choose which color profile and color-management process to use.
	
We’re talking about two very different issues here. One issue is color man­
agement, which ultimately comes down to whether Elements manages your 
color, your printer manages color, or you use no color management at all. 
The other issue is choosing a color profile. Therefore, you have a series of 
combined options to choose from. You can choose a profile and turn color 
management either on or off. Or you can elect not to make a profile choice 
and decide whether color management is on or off. The choices you make 
are critical to getting color right on your output.
All the methods are described in the following sections.
	
When printing with color management and using color profiles, print from 
the Photo Editor only. The Organizer Prints Color Management has fewer 
options than the Photo Editor Print dialog box.
Automatic profile selection for Epson printers
The automatic profile selection method exists, and depending on what 
model of printer you have, you may be required to make this choice.
Your options all depend on whether the printer you buy installs color pro­
files on your computer. If you buy some low-end color printers that cost less 
than $100, the installer software typically doesn’t install color profiles. When 
no profiles are installed, the printer manages the color through built-in pro­
files contained in the printer’s memory.
High-end models (above the $100 price range) often install individual color 
profiles. You might see the profiles for various papers on the Printer Profile 
pop-up menu in the Elements More Options dialog box. If you have one of 

594
Printing to Inkjet Printers
these high-end printers, you might want to choose the profile that matches 
the paper you’re using and let Elements manage the color.
As we discuss in Book III, Chapter 5, you have two choices for your color 
workspace. Those choices are sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). The workspace is 
used to see color on your monitor. We also talk (in Book III, Chapter 5) about 
calibrating your monitor so that the colors you see appear as close to real-
world color as you can get.
When you print a picture, the color from your monitor workspace (either 
sRGB or Adobe RGB [1998]) is converted to your printer color. So, you want 
to fit all the color you see in an sRGB workspace, for example, into the print­
er’s profile so that the print looks as close as possible to what you see on 
your monitor. Elements takes care of this color conversion. The only thing 
you need to worry about is making the right choice for how that conversion 
takes place.
Follow these steps (in the Photo Editor only) to print from the native color 
space:
	
1.	 Open a file in the Photo Editor and choose File➪Print.
	
	 The Print dialog box that opens contains all the settings you need to 
print a file.
	
	 When you want to manage color, print from the Photo Editor and not the 
Organizer.
	
2.	 Select the orientation of your print.
	
	 You can choose either Portrait or Landscape. Select the proper orienta­
tion in the Page Setup in the Prints dialog box. (Refer to Figure 2-4.)
	
3.	 Select your printer from the Select Printer drop-down menu.
	
4.	 Set the print attributes.
	
	 Select the number of copies, position, scaling, and output items you 
want.
	
5.	 Click the More Options button, and in the More Options dialog box, 
choose Color Management on the left.
	
	 In the Color Management area of the More Options dialog box, shown in 
Figure 2-8, you choose how to manage color when you print files.
	
6.	 From the Color Handling drop-down menu, select Printer Manages 
Colors; click OK in the More Options dialog box.
	
	 This choice uses your current workspace color and later converts the 
color from your workspace to the printer output file when you open the 
printer driver dialog box.

9.	 On the Mac, click the Print button after you make your choices in the 
More Options dialog box. 
	
	 The file doesn’t print yet. You need to do the following:
	
a.	 Open the pop-up menu below the Paper Size item and choose Print 
Settings, as shown in Figure 2-10. From the Media Type pop-up menu, 
choose the paper 
for your output.
	
b.	 Open the Print 
Settings pop-up 
menu and 
choose Color 
Management, 
as shown in 
Figure 2-11. Leave 
the default set­
ting at Color 
Controls. (This 
setting is used 
when the printer 
manages color.)
	
	 On the Macintosh, 
click the Print but­
ton, and the file is 
printed.
	
10.	 Set print attributes 
(Windows).
	
	 In our Epson exam­
ple, select Epson 
Premium Glossy (or 
another paper from 
the Type drop-down 
menu that you may 
be using) and then 
click the Best Photo 
radio button. (Refer 
to Figure 2-9.)
	
	 Now, it’s time to 
color-manage 
your file. This step 
is critical in your 
print-production 
workflow.

11.	 Click the Advanced tab.
	
	 The advanced settings in the Printing Properties dialog box open, as 
shown in Figure 2-12.
Figure 2-12: Click the Advanced tab to open advanced settings.
	
12.	 Make your choices in the advanced settings of the Printing Properties 
dialog box.
	
	 Here are the most important choices:
	
•	 Select a paper type. You selected paper already? The drop-down 
menu in the Paper & Quality Options section of the dialog box deter­
mines the application of inks. Select the same paper here as you did 
in Step 10.
	
•	 Turn on color management. Because you’re letting the printer driver 
determine the color, you need to be certain that the Color Controls 
radio button is selected. This setting tells the printer driver to auto­
matically select a printer profile for the paper type you selected.

598
Printing to Inkjet Printers
	
•	 Set the color mode. Don’t use Epson Vivid. This choice produces infe­
rior results on photos. Choose Best Photo, the Epson Standard, or 
Adobe RGB, depending on your printer.
	
	 If you frequently print files using the same settings, you can save your 
settings by clicking the Save Settings button.
	
13.	 To print the photo, click OK and then click OK again in the Prints dia­
log box.
	
	 Your file is sent to your printer. The color is converted automatically 
from your source workspace of sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) to the profile 
the printer driver automatically selects for you.
Selecting a printer profile
Another method for managing color when you’re printing files is to select a 
printer profile from the available list of color profiles installed with your 
printer. Whereas in the preceding section, you used your printer to manage 
color, this time, you let Photoshop Elements manage the color.
The steps in this section are the same as the ones described in the preced­
ing section for printing files for automatic profile selection when you’re set­
ting up the page and selecting a printer. When you choose File➪Print in the 
Photo Editor, you open the Elements Print dialog box. To let Elements han­
dle the color conversion, follow these steps in the Print dialog box:
	
1.	 Open a photo in the Photo Editor, choose File➪Print, and then click 
Color Management in the Print dialog box.
	
2.	 From the Printer Profile drop-down menu in the Color Management 
section of the Print dialog box, select the color profile designed for 
use with the paper you’ve chosen.
	
3.	 Click Printer Preferences in the More Options dialog box.
	
	 The printer’s Properties dialog box opens (refer to Figure 2-9).
	
4.	 In Windows, select the Best Photo radio button, and from the Type 
drop-down menu, select the recommended paper choice. On the 
Macintosh, make your paper choice, as shown in Figure 2-10.
	
	 Custom color profiles are also shipped with guidelines for selecting 
proper paper.
	
5.	 In Windows, click the Advanced button to arrive at the dialog box 
shown in Figure 2-12. On the Macintosh, choose Color Management 
from the pop-up menu to arrive at the same dialog box shown earlier 
in Figure 2-11.

599
Book IX 
Chapter 2
Getting It Printed
Using Online Printing Services
	
	 The paper choice selection is automatically carried over from the previ­
ous Properties dialog box. The one setting you change is in the Color 
Management section.
	
6.	 In Windows, select the ICM (Image Color Management) radio button 
and select the Off (No Color Adjustment) check box, as shown in 
Figure 2-13. On the Macintosh, select the Off (No Color Adjustment) 
radio button.
	
	 Because you selected 
the color profile in 
Step 2 and you’re let­
ting Elements man­
age the color, be 
sure that the Color 
Management feature 
is turned off. If you 
don’t turn off Color 
Management, you 
end up double-­
profiling your print.
	
The choice to manage color or not to manage it is simplified in Photoshop 
Elements. In the Color Management area of the dialog box, a message is 
reported each time you make a selection from the Color Handling drop-down 
menu. Right below Source Space, you see a message asking whether you 
remembered to turn Color Management on or off. Each time you make a 
selection for the Color Handling, pause a moment and read the message. 
This is your reminder that you need to follow the recommendation to prop­
erly handle color.
Using Online Printing Services
In Photoshop Elements 11 and 12, Adobe has partnered with a single service 
provider for ordering prints online. Choose the photos you want to send to 
the Shutterfly service in the Organizer and choose File➪Order Prints➪Order 
Shutterfly Prints. On the Macintosh, choose Adobe Elements 12 Organizer➪
Order Prints➪Order Shutterfly Prints.
The Shutterfly order screen opens. Follow the onscreen instructions for cre­
ating an account and placing an order.

Y

ou shoot photos primarily for two reasons (if you’re not selling them 
for income): to gain personal satisfaction and revel in your own work 
or to share your creations with others.
Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of photography is experienc­
ing the appreciation of family and friends who laugh, cry, 
ooh, and aah when looking at your images.
Photoshop Elements provides you with a number of 
sharing options to get those laughs, cries, oohs, and 
aahs from others. When it comes down to it, the 
sharing of photos just might be one of the best rea­
sons you have for using Photoshop Elements.
In this chapter, we look at the many opportunities 
that Elements provides for sharing photos in your 
living room or across the world.
Getting Familiar with the Elements 
­Sharing Options
Before you delve into making creations for screen viewing, we want to famil­
iarize you with the available options for not only screen images but also 
sharing — particularly online sharing services. You also need to know the 

602
Getting Familiar with the Elements ­Sharing Options
acceptable standards for online hosts, where you eventually send your cre­
ations, and for the devices people are likely to use to view your creations.
Before you choose a sharing activity and ultimately begin work on a cre­
ation, answer these questions we explore in the following sections.
What device(s) are going to display my creations? 
For viewing photos and movies, the device options include computers 
(including desktops, notebooks, and netbooks), handheld devices such as 
mobile phones, tablets such as the Apple iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab, and 
TVs. If you want to make your creations accessible on all devices, the tools 
that you use within Elements and the file format in which you save a creation 
are different from the tools used and file formats you might use for showing 
creations on a TV or on a computer exclusively.
Issues that you need to understand regarding devices and viewing your cre­
ations include the following:
	
✓	Adobe Flash: Some hosts convert your video uploads to Adobe Flash. If 
you want to share photos with iPhone/iPod/iPad users (more than one 
billion and counting), you need to stay away from any host that sup­
ports Flash-only conversions. However, you should check sites regu­
larly. Many sites are transcoding video so that people can view content 
on the widest range of devices that include iPad and iOS, as well as 
Android systems.
	
✓	Storage space: Hosts vary greatly in terms of the amount of space allo­
cated for storing content. If you want to share large video files, you need 
to be certain that the storage host you choose allocates enough storage 
space to permit you to upload your files.
What storage hosts are the most popular? 
From within Photoshop Elements, you can export directly to YouTube and 
Vimeo video sharing for computers, iOS, and Android devices; Adobe Revel; 
SmugMug Gallery; Facebook; Flickr; and Twitter. Some of these providers 
may be new to you. Just be aware that they all perform a similar kind of ser­
vice: Each enables you to upload photos and invite people to see your cre­
ations. The online sharing services that are supported directly in Elements 
include the following:
	
✓	Facebook: Facebook (www.facebook.com) is an online service that’s 
clearly among the most popular worldwide for sharing photos. If 
Facebook were a country and its users were all citizens, it would be the 
third largest country in the world behind China and India. Facebook 
offers you up to 200 photos maximum per album, up to 1024MB for each 
video, and unlimited space for total albums and videos.

603
Book IX
Chapter 3

Getting Familiar with the Elements ­Sharing Options
	
	When you submit videos to Facebook, the videos are transcoded to 
Adobe Flash for viewing on computers but also contain coding for view­
ing on an iPhone/iPod/iPad (see Figure 3-1). The process is transparent 
to the user. You just upload a video in any one of more than a dozen dif­
ferent formats, and anyone with 
any device can view the video. 
Facebook is clearly the leader 
for hosting all your creations.
	
✓	Flickr: Whereas Facebook pro­
vides you with nearly limitless 
opportunity, Flickr (at www.
flickr.com and operated by 
Yahoo!) is much more restric­
tive. Flickr assesses maximum 
storage per user according to 
bandwidth. You can upload only 
so many times, and then you 
have to wait until the next 
month to upload additional pho­
tos. It’s much more limiting than 
other services, and video files 
are restricted to small file sizes. 
You can upgrade to a premium 
account for a fee, but why 
bother when you can get it all 
free with a much better user 
interface on Facebook?
	
✓	Adobe Revel: Adobe Revel 
(www.adoberevel.com) is one of the easiest methods for sharing your 
photos and videos. You can use the free online service to back up, view, 
and share up to 50 uploads per month. You can acquire additional space 
for a membership fee. As this book goes to press, iPhone, iPad, and Mac 
users can download the Revel app from the App Store to edit and access 
images across these devices, too, and Adobe expects to release similar 
support for Windows and Android devices in the near future. See the 
upcoming section “Working with Adobe Revel” for more details.
	
✓	SmugMug Gallery: SmugMug (www.smugmug.com) charges a subscrip­
tion fee starting at $5.00 per month for up to 50MB of photos and videos. 
For your money, SmugMug offers templates that enable you to design a 
website for showing off your images as well as security and privacy fea­
tures if you want to control who can view or save copies of your images.
	
✓	Vimeo: The name comes from video by replacing a d with an m. Vimeo 
(https://vimeo.com) currently has over 65 million unique users per 
month and is rapidly becoming a social media site for video that is sup­
ported on computers, Apple iOS, and Android devices. Vimeo offers free 
video uploads of up to 500MB per week.

✓	YouTube: YouTube (www.youtube.com) offers free unlimited videos 
up to 10 minutes in length and not exceeding 100MB.
	
✓	Twitter: Support for uploading files directly from the Organizer to 
Twitter (https://twitter.com) is a new feature in Elements 12.

services not directly linked to Elements in the Share panel, save your edited 
photos to a folder on your hard drive, open the service’s URL in your web 
browser, and follow the guidelines for the service to upload photos and vid­
eos. In addition to uploading single photos to a service, some of the cre­
ations you might want to share include the following:
	
✓	Slide shows: In Windows, you can create a slide show and choose to 
export the slide show as a movie file (.wmv) or a PDF. On the Macintosh, 
you’re limited to PDF only.

	If you work in Windows, export to .wmv and upload your file to an online 
host. 
	
	If you use Facebook, users of all devices can see your creations on any 
device. If you add audio to a slide show, the audio plays on all devices 
when uploaded to Facebook. If you try to upload the same file to Flickr, 
more often than not, the file size will be too large to host.
	
	On iPhones or iPads, you can view PDFs natively when the files are 
added to your iBooks library. However, GoodReader by Good-iWare LTD 
(http://goodreader.net) is, in our opinion as of this writing, one of 
the best PDF viewers and provides you with many options for viewing 
your Elements creations. GoodReader is available for both iPhone and 
iPad and costs $4.99 — much less than some other PDF viewers you can 
find in the Apple App Store. 
	
✓	Web hosting: If you want to host videos on your own website and make 
the videos accessible to iPhone/iPod/iPad users as well as computer 
users, you need a little help from Adobe Premiere Elements. In Premiere 
Elements, you can export video for Mobile Devices, and the resultant file 
can be viewed on an iPhone/iPod/iPad as well as computers. Also, 
Premiere Elements supports Mac-based services that aren’t available in 
Photoshop Elements, such as slide shows exported as movie files.
Working with Adobe Revel
Adobe Revel is a web hosting service for storing your photos in the cloud, 
where you can view and share your photos on all your devices, such as com­
puters, smartphones, tablets, notebooks, and so on. When you edit a photo 
in Elements or via the tools in the Adobe Revel app (currently only available 
for Apple devices), the photo is automatically updated on all devices.
As of this writing, Adobe Revel is going through many changes and may not 
be fully updated by the time this book is printed. Be sure to check our online 
Web Extras for any updates we might have at www.dummies.com/extras/
photoshopelements12.
In Elements, you can access Adobe Revel from the Import panel on the left 
side of the Organizer or via a link in the Share panel, as follows:
	
✓	In the Import panel, you have the Mobile Albums item appearing below 
the Albums button. You use the Mobile Albums link to sync photos on 
Adobe Revel and your computer. You can download your entire Revel 
library using this link, and the photos appear in the Organizer Media 
Browser. When you edit a photo in Elements or via the Adobe Revel app, 
the edited version is immediately updated in your Revel library.

606
Working with Adobe Revel
	
✓	The Adobe Revel button in the Share panel is used to upload photos to 
your Revel account and share your photos with family and friends. 
	
	It’s important to remember that Mobile Albums is used to download and 
sync photos while the Adobe Revel button in the Share panel is used for 
uploading and sharing photos.
Earlier versions of Elements had support for Photoshop.com and Adobe 
Showcase. These services are being discontinued in favor of Adobe Revel. 
For a limited time, you can migrate your media from other Adobe services to 
Adobe Revel. Be aware that you may or may not be able to access photos 
from Photoshop.com if you created a Photoshop.com account and uploaded 
photos. As of this writing, Adobe permits users to port their Photoshop.com 
library to Adobe Revel. At some point, this option will cease to exist.
When you visit the Adobe Revel website at www.adoberevel.com and log 
in with your Adobe ID and password, you arrive at your Carousel, which dis­
plays all your photo uploads. The Adobe Revel website is limited to viewing 
photos and sharing your photos. As of this writing, there are no provisions 
on the website to edit your photos from within your web browser. On a com­
puter, you must edit photos in Photoshop Elements. On the Mac, you can 
edit photos in Elements or using the Adobe Revel desktop application. On 
iOS devices, you must use the Adobe Revel application for iOS devices to 
edit photos.
Knowing what Adobe Revel offers you
Adobe Revel is more than just a hosting service. You can perform many 
tasks with Adobe Revel, such as the following:
	
✓	Store photos and sync in the cloud: Your photos are safely stored on 
the Adobe Revel website, and you can sync the photos to all your 
devices, such as computer, tablet, and phone.
	
✓	Privacy: As a default, all your photos are uploaded to your private 
account. Only you can see the photos you upload. When you want to 
share the photos, you can share them to the public or to selected users.
	
✓	Photo albums: You can add photos to albums and view the photos 
within a given album in a slide show view.
	
✓	Edit photos: Adobe Revel is the only photo-sharing service that offers 
you Adobe Lightroom performance for editing photos. As of this writing, 
you can edit photos with the Adobe Revel application, which is available 
for mobile devices using iOS and for Macs.

Downloading the Adobe Revel 
applications (Mac only)
In Photoshop Elements, you can upload and download photos through the 
link to Adobe Revel.
The Adobe Revel applications — which you can download for free — enable 
you to edit photos. When you save the edited photos, you can view the new 
edits on all your devices. Here’s where you can find them:
	
✓	For Macs: As of this writing, the Adobe Revel desktop application is 
available only for the Mac. You can download the application directly 
from the Apple App Store or through iTunes.
	
✓	For iOS devices: Adobe Revel can be downloaded to iOS devices for use 
on your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad. These versions provide you with 
sharing and editing features. Your device needs to have iOS version 6 or 
greater.
	
✓	For Android devices: You can download Adobe Revel for Android 
devices; however, as of this writing, Android versions of Adobe Revel 
support sharing photos and don’t offer any editing options. You can 
download Adobe Revel for Android from the Android Market Place, and 
the app requires Android version 2.2.
Windows users, do not despair. Adobe is likely to provide the same options 
with desktop and Android apps as found currently with the iOS and Mac 
desktop apps. Be certain to check the Adobe website regularly at www.
adoberevel.com for new updates and announcements.
Understanding the Adobe Revel interface
Whether you work on a desktop or an iOS device, the Revel applications pro­
vide you with similar features, although you find some slight differences in 
the interfaces. Figure 3-2 shows the Revel interface on an iOS device.
Here are the main features:
	
A.	 Toggle Library Panel: Tap the icon to open the left panel, where you 
can choose between photos downloaded from Photoshop.com and pho­
tos stored in your Adobe Revel Carousel. Think of the Adobe Carousel 
as a library of photos.
	
B.	 Add: On an iOS device, tapping this button opens the Camera Roll on 
your device. (Camera Roll is where the photos you take on your device 
are stored.) You can tap a photo or multiple photos from your camera 
roll and add them to your library. On the desktop version, a dialog box 

608
Working with Adobe Revel
opens, allowing you to 
navigate your hard 
drive and add photos 
stored in folders.
	
C.	 Grid view: The photos 
are viewed as thumb­
nails on a grid similar 
to the Media Browser 
view in Photoshop 
Elements. In the desk­
top application, you 
see Grid appearing in 
the upper-left corner 
of the Adobe Revel 
window.
	
D.	 Track view: This view 
displays the photos 
from top to bottom in a 
single row. Date infor­
mation appears as a 
caption, and you can 
use the pencil icon to 
add the photo as an 
event. In the desktop 
application, you click 
the date to open a dia­
log box where you can 
add event information.
	
E.	 Sort: Two options appear in a drop-down menu: Oldest First and Newest 
First. In the desktop application, you can sort by All Photos by Date, 
Events by Date, Events by Name, and Added By. The Added By option is 
the username for the person who added the photo.
	
F.	 Action menu: This menu provides options for
	
•	 Add to Album: Tap this menu item and tap photos from the thumb­
nails view to add selected photos to an existing album or create a 
new album. In the desktop version, a dialog box opens and allows 
you to navigate your hard drive and add photos from folders to exist­
ing albums.
	
•	 Share Photos: Select the photos that you want to share and you find 
options at the bottom of the window for Email, Facebook, and More. 
When you tap the More button, you find additional options to assign 
a photo to your contacts or copy the photo. In the desktop version,

Working with Adobe Revel
the Share button appears in the upper-left corner of the window adja­
cent to the plus (+) symbol used for adding photos to an album. 
When you tap the Share button, a menu opens that provides options 
for copying the link to paste in an e-mail, viewing an album in a web 
browser, or canceling the process of sharing the photo or album.
	
•	 Save to Camera Roll: This option is available only on iOS devices. 
Choose this option to save a photo to your device’s Camera Roll.
	
•	 Delete Photos: Tap this option to delete the photo from your 
Carousel/Library. On the desktop version, you can Control-click and 
choose Remove Photo from Album.
	
G.	 Photo thumbnails: This view shows all the photos in your Revel account 
for the photos stored in your Carousel or from your Photoshop.com 
download, depending on which item you have selected in the left panel.
	
H.	 Display all photos: By default, this view appears where all photos are 
displayed.
	
I.	 Favorites: This view displays photos that you have marked as Favorites. 
To mark a photo as a Favorite, you need to first tap the photo and 
then tap the Add to Favorites icon represented by a heart shape. On the 
desktop version, you view Favorites by clicking the My Favorites button 
at the top of the left panel. When you click a photo on the desktop ver­
sion, you mark a photo as a Favorite by clicking the star icon at the 
upper right of the window.
	
J.	 Albums: Tap this button to display all albums. In the desktop version, 
the albums are listed in a hierarchical view in the left panel according to 
album name.
	
K.	 Explore view: The Explore view displays your photos in larger thumb­
nail sizes, and you can move the photos around the window by tapping 
and dragging to scroll through them. This view appears only on iOS 
devices.
	
L.	 Share Album: The Share Album button opens a window displaying all 
your albums. When you click an album, you see all the photos within the 
album. To complete the steps to share your album, first click the photos 
in the album; then open the Action menu (item F) and click Share 
Photos. At the bottom of the window, you have options to Email or send 
to Facebook. Click the More button to share photos to your Contacts or 
Copy the photos.
The real power in Adobe Revel is editing photos, which we talk about in the 
next section.

Working with Adobe Revel
Editing a photo with Revel
To edit a photo using Adobe Revel on a Mac or iOS device, do the following:
	
1.	 Log in to your Adobe Revel account.
	
	 Launch the application on your Mac or iOS device. Sign in using your 
e-mail address and password. If you haven’t created an Adobe ID, you 
can choose the option to create a new account. After you log in, you see 
the photos you have in your Carousel (library) or photos you imported 
from a Photoshop.com library.
	
2.	 Tap a photo in iOS or click a photo on the desktop app.
	
	 The view changes to an editing view, where the editing tools are avail­
able, as shown in Figure 3-3.
	
3.	 Make photo edits.
	
	 The tools available include the 
following:
	
A.	 Favorites: On iOS devices, 
the favorites icon is repre­
sented with a heart. On desk­
tops, the favorites icon is a 
star. Tap or click the icon, 
and the photo you’re view­
ing is added to your favorites.
	
B.	 Comment: Tap the Comment icon, and a comments panel opens so 
that you can type a comment.
	
C.	 Slide Show view: The first icon at the lower left of the window is used 
to run a slide show. This icon works if you tap an album. If you have 
a single photo selected, tapping this icon prevents you from swiping 
to change photos. To exit the slide show view, tap anywhere outside 
a photo or press the Esc key on your desktop computer.
	
D.	 Keyboard: Tap this icon, and the keyboard pops up on iOS devices. 
You can type a caption that’s added at the bottom of the photo. In 
the desktop version, a panel opens that provides a number of differ­
ent sharing options.
	
E.	 Edit: Tap this icon to enter editing mode. You have choices for mak­
ing an auto-fix, changing white balance, adjusting exposure and con­
trast, making red-eye corrections, and cropping and rotating a photo. 
The best way to familiarize yourself with the editing tools is to play 
with them and make changes for auto-correction, exposure, contrast, 
cropping, and rotation, if needed. In Figure 3-4, you see a photo tar­
geted for cropping.
	
F.	 Delete: Click the Trash icon to delete a photo.

4.	 Compare your edits with the 
original photo.
	
	 To make a comparison between 
your edits and the original 
photo, keep your finger pressed 
on the Compare icon at the top 
of the window. While your finger 
is pressed on the icon, you see 
the original photo before any 
edits. When you release your 
finger from the icon, you see 
the photo as you have edited it.
	
5.	 Save your edits. 
	
	 Tap the check mark at the 
upper-right corner of the win­
dow to save your edits and 
update the file. When updated, 
the new edited file appears the 
same on all your devices.
	
6.	 Dismiss the editing mode.
	
	 Tap the X icon at the upper-left 
corner and you return to your 
library view. (Refer to Figure 3-2.)
Sharing photos with Adobe Revel
After you make some edits on photos and update them, you can see the new 
edited photos on all your devices as long as they’re connected to the cloud. 
However, the photos are secure, and only you can view them unless you 
decide to share them. 
Share your photos with the following steps:
	
1.	 Select a photo in your library.
	
2.	 Open the Actions drop-down menu (on the Mac) or tap the Action icon 
on an iOS device. 
	
	 The menu you see is different, depending on what system you use. 
	
3.	 Choose a sharing option, as shown in Figure 3-5 for Revel on the Mac, 
or tap Share or Share to Facebook on an iOS device, as shown in 
Figure 3-6.

	 If you want to share your photo via 
Facebook, Twitter, or Flickr, tap the corre­
sponding option. Or tap Share to open a 
pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 3-6. The 
rest of these steps use Facebook as an exam­
ple. You can find details about choosing an 
action from the Mac options at the end of 
this section.
	
4.	 Tap an option for where you want to send 
the file.
	
	 You can e-mail the photo to someone or 
send it to a sharing service. In our example, 
we share to Facebook.
	
	 In the window that opens, you can type a 
title for your photo and identify a location, 
as shown in Figure 3-7. 
	
5.	 Add a title and location.
	
6.	 Tap the Post button to upload the photo to 
your Facebook Timeline.
To share a photo from your desktop Mac, click 
the Action icon to choose a share option. 
However, the choices available to you are very 
different (as of this writing) than those available 
in iOS (refer to Figure 3-5).
You have options to share the selected album or 
photo to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Email the 
photo, Message (SMS), or AirDrop (a local Wi-Fi 
ad hoc Apple service for sharing across all Apple 
devices).
Choose the sharing option you want and follow 
the instructions provided in menus to post your 
photo.
Downloading images from your 
Revel Carousel
Your Revel Carousel contains photos you’ve 
uploaded to your Revel account. If you ever 
lose your photos on your hard drive or just need to access your images 
while you’re away from your computer, you can download all the images in 
your Carousel or just selected photos. In this section, we focus on how to 
download images from Revel into the Elements Organizer.

Working with Adobe Revel
If you want to upload images from 
Elements to your Revel Carousel, 
you can do that in the Elements 
Organizer, too, and we walk you 
through that process in the section 
“Getting a Grip on the Share Panel.”
	
If you used Photoshop.com in an ear­
lier version of Elements, a Photoshop.
com library is added to your Revel 
account when you first log in from the Organizer. This library will exist sepa­
rately from your Carousel, but you can still download all the images it contains. 
Note, however, that Photoshop.com is being discontinued by Adobe Systems. If 
you don’t switch to Revel in time, you may not be able to import photos from 
Photoshop.com when you first create an Adobe Revel account.
Assuming you have photos uploaded to your Adobe Revel account, the pho­
tos exist online. You need to download a photo in order to edit it in the 
Photo Editor.
To download photos from your Revel account to your computer, do the 
following:
	
1.	 Click a library in the Mobile Albums area in the Import panel.
	
	 The Import panel shown in Figure 3-8 displays our Photoshop.com 
library (we converted our Photoshop.com library to Adobe Revel) and 
our Adobe Revel Carousel.
Figure 3-8: Revel libraries are shown in the Import panel.
Figure 3-7: When you’re uploading a photo or 
album to Facebook, a pop-up menu opens.

Getting a Grip on the Share Panel
	
2.	 Select a photo in the Media Browser and choose Edit➪Edit with 
Photoshop Elements Editor. 
	
	 The photo opens in the Photo Editor.
	
	 The Media Browser displays thumbnail images of the photos in your 
Revel libraries, but the photos are hosted online. You need to download 
the photo in order to edit it. As soon as you choose the menu option to 
edit the photo, the photo is downloaded from your Revel account to 
your computer. 
	
You can choose how to sync your media in Photoshop Elements 
Preferences. In the Organizer, press Ctrl+K (Windows) or ⌘+K (Mac) and 
click Adobe Revel. You can turn the automatic sync on and off in this prefer­
ence setting. When the Revel Agent is on, new and edited photos automati­
cally appear in the Media Browser and on all your devices running the 
Adobe Revel app. For more on setting Preferences, see Book I, Chapter 4.
Getting a Grip on the Share Panel
The Create and Share panels are available in both the Organizer and the 
Photo Editor and are used to make choices for assembling creations and 
sharing creations. For this section, we stick to the Share panel; in Chapter 1 
of this minibook, we cover using the Create panel.
The Share panel is almost identical 
in Windows and on the Macintosh. 
The only exception that you find 
in Elements is that Photo Mail is 
restricted to Windows users only. 
In Figure 3-9, you can see the Share 
panel as it appears in Windows (left) 
and on the Macintosh (right).
If you open the Share panel in 
the Photo Editor, the options are 
fewer and you won’t find Email 
Attachments, Vimeo, YouTube, Burn 
Video to DVD Blu-Ray, or PDF Slide 
Show. Only the Organizer displays 
the complete Share options shown 
in Figure 3-9.
Sharing photos with Adobe Revel 
is handled by clicking the button 
labeled Private Web Album.

Getting a Grip on the Share Panel
To share photos, you first select the images you want to share in the 
Organizer. Then click a button in the Share panel.
Sharing Photos on Adobe Revel
To share photos on Adobe Revel, you do the following:
	
1.	 Click the image thumbnails in the Media Browser that you want to 
upload to your Revel account.
	
2.	 Click Share to open the Share panel and click Private Web Album.
	
	 The Private Web Album window opens, as shown in Figure 3-10.
	
3.	 Choose a Library 
and Album or create 
a new album.
	
	 From the Library 
drop-down menu, 
choose the library to 
which you want to 
share. You can 
choose between 
your Photoshop.com 
library or your Revel 
Carousel.
	
	 If you want to share 
photos to an existing 
album, open the 
Album drop-down 
menu and select the 
album you want to 
use. If you want to 
create a new album, click the Plus button and you are prompted to pro­
vide a name for the new album.
	
4.	 Click Start Sharing to upload the photo to your Adobe Revel account.
Uploading files to social media websites
When uploading files to social media websites from Photoshop Elements, 
you are prompted in a dialog box to authorize your account. In the Share 
panel, you then click the button for the social media site where you want to 
post your file. For example, if you select Twitter, the Twitter permission dia­
log box opens, as shown in Figure 3-11.
Click the Authorize button and your default web browser opens, where you 
type your username and password. After completing this step, return to the 
Organizer and click the Authorize button.

Getting a Grip on the Share Panel
Follow the onscreen instructions to 
upload a photo to your Twitter 
account.  
All the social media web sharing fol­
lows the same procedure, where 
you first authenticate an account 
and then proceed to upload photos.
Creating an e-mail 
attachment
Elements makes it easy for you to attach photos to a new e-mail message. 
You can stay in the Organizer, select photos you want to send, and e-mail 
them to friends and family. You don’t have to open your e-mail client and 
search your hard drive to locate the photos you want to attach to an e-mail 
message.
To e-mail photos, select a photo or several photos in the Organizer and click 
Email Attachments in the Share panel. Adjust the size of the images in the 
Share panel and proceed through the steps in the panel to attach the files to 
a new e-mail message.
E-mailing photos is straightforward, and you should intuitively discover how 
easy it is to e-mail photos.
Sending Photo Mail (Windows)
Although similar to sending e-mail attachments, using Photo Mail (only in 
Windows) adds some pizzazz to your e-mail attachments. You can neatly 
organize your photos in a nice layout and then package them together for a 
single e-mail attachment. Here’s how to prepare albums for online viewing:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer (Windows only).
	
2.	 Select photos that you want to use with Photo Mail.
	
3.	 Open the Share panel and choose Photo Mail.
	
4.	 Drag the selected photos to the Photo Mail panel.
	
5.	 Add recipients or bypass this option.
	
	 You can add recipients here or in your mail program. In our example, we 
added recipients, as shown in Figure 3-12.
Figure 3-11: Permission dialog box for Twitter.

Getting a Grip on the Share Panel
	
	 You can bypass adding recipients from your 
Address Book. If no recipients are listed in 
the Select Recipients panel, you can add 
recipient e-mail addresses in the new mes­
sage window in your e-mail client.
	
6.	 Click Next.
	
	 The Stationery & Layouts Wizard opens.
	
7.	 Choose a layout in the Stationery & Layouts 
Wizard and type a caption for each photo, 
as shown in Figure 3-13.
	
8.	 Click Next Step in the Stationery & Layouts 
Wizard.
	
	 The photos are attached to a new e-mail 
message. Use your application switcher 
(press Alt+Tab and select your e-mail client 
to view the e-mail, as shown in Figure 3-14).
	
	 Elements attaches media to a new e-mail 
message. You need to toggle to your e-mail 
client to see the message and send the 
e-mail.
	
	 By default, Elements uses your primary 
e-mail client application (see Figure 3-14), 
which may or may not be the e-mail program 
you use. You can change the default e-mail 
client in Elements by pressing Ctrl+K to 
open the Preferences dialog box when you’re 
in the Organizer, and then clicking Sharing in 
the left pane. From a drop-down menu in the 
Sharing preferences, select the e-mail client 
application that you want Elements to use. In 
Windows, you have only two choices: Use 
Microsoft Outlook or Adobe Email Service. 
On the Macintosh, you likewise have only 
two choices: Use Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail. Unfortunately, if your 
e-mail service is Yahoo! Mail or another web service, you can’t use 
Photo Mail to send photos from Elements.
