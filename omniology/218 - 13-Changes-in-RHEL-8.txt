CHAPTER 1. PREFACE
This document provides an overview of differences between two major versions of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux: RHEL 7 and RHEL 8. It provides a list of changes relevant for evaluating migration to
RHEL 8 rather than an exhaustive list of all alterations.
Capabilities and limits of RHEL 8 as compared to other versions of the system are available in the
Knowledgebase article Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits .
Information regarding the RHEL life cycle is provided in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle
document.
The Package manifest document provides a package listing for RHEL 8.
For details regarding RHEL 8 usage, see the RHEL 8 product documentation .
For guidance regarding an in-place upgrade from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8, see Upgrading to RHEL 8 .
For information about major differences between RHEL 6 and RHEL 7, see the RHEL 7 Migration
Planning Guide.
CHAPTER 1. PREFACE

CHAPTER 2. ARCHITECTURES
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is distributed with the kernel version 4.18, which provides support for the
following architectures:
AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures
The 64-bit ARM architecture
IBM Power Systems, little endian
IBM Z
Make sure you purchase the appropriate subscription for each architecture. For more information, see
Get Started with Red Hat Enterprise Linux - additional architectures . For a list of available subscriptions,
see Subscription Utilization on the Customer Portal.
Note that all architectures are supported by the standard kernel packages in RHEL 8; no kernel-alt
package is needed.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
10

CHAPTER 3. REPOSITORIES
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is distributed through two main repositories:
BaseOS
AppStream
Both repositories are required for a basic RHEL installation, and are available with all RHEL
subscriptions.
Content in the BaseOS repository is intended to provide the core set of the underlying OS functionality
that provides the foundation for all installations. This content is available in the RPM format and is
subject to support terms similar to those in previous releases of RHEL. For a list of packages distributed
through BaseOS, see the Package manifest.
Content in the Application Stream repository includes additional user space applications, runtime
languages, and databases in support of the varied workloads and use cases. Content in AppStream is
available in one of two formats - the familiar RPM format and an extension to the RPM format called
modules. For a list of packages available in AppStream, see the Package manifest.
In addition, the CodeReady Linux Builder repository is available with all RHEL subscriptions. It provides
additional packages for use by developers. Packages included in the CodeReady Linux Builder
repository are unsupported.
For more information about RHEL 8 repositories, see the Package manifest.
CHAPTER 3. REPOSITORIES
11

CHAPTER 4. APPLICATION STREAMS
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 introduces the concept of Application Streams. Multiple versions of user
space components are now delivered and updated more frequently than the core operating system
packages. This provides greater flexibility to customize Red Hat Enterprise Linux without impacting the
underlying stability of the platform or specific deployments.
Components made available as Application Streams can be packaged as modules or RPM packages and
are delivered through the AppStream repository in RHEL 8. Each Application Stream component has a
given life cycle, either the same as RHEL 8 or shorter. For details, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life
Cycle.
Modules are collections of packages representing a logical unit: an application, a language stack, a
database, or a set of tools. These packages are built, tested, and released together.
Module streams represent versions of the Application Stream components. For example, two streams
(versions) of the PostgreSQL database server are available in the postgresql module: PostgreSQL 10
(the default stream) and PostgreSQL 9.6. Only one module stream can be installed on the system.
Different versions can be used in separate containers.
Detailed module commands are described in the Installing, managing, and removing user-space
components document. For a list of modules available in AppStream, see the Package manifest.

CHAPTER 5. INSTALLER AND IMAGE CREATION
5.1. ADD-ONS
5.1.1. OSCAP
The OSCAP add-on is enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
5.1.2. Kdump
The Kdump add-on adds support for configuring kernel crash dumping during installation. This add-on
has full support in Kickstart (using the %addon com_redhat_kdump command and its options), and is
fully integrated as an additional window in the graphical and text-based user interfaces.
5.2. INSTALLER NETWORKING
5.2.1. Device naming scheme
A new network device naming scheme that generates network interface names based on a user-defined
prefix is available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. The net.ifnames.prefix boot option allows the device
naming scheme to be used by the installation program and the installed system. See the 
dracut.cmdline(7) man page for information.
5.3. INSTALLATION IMAGES AND PACKAGES
5.3.1. Unified ISO
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, a unified ISO automatically loads the BaseOS and AppStream
installation source repositories. This feature works for the first base repository that is loaded during
installation. For example, if you boot the installation with no repository configured and have the unified
ISO as the base repository in the graphical user interface (GUI), or if you boot the installation using the 
inst.repo= option that points to the unified ISO.
As a result, the AppStream repository is enabled under the Additional Repositories section of the
Installation Source GUI window. You cannot remove the AppStream repository or change its settings
but you can disable it in Installation Source. This feature does not work if you boot the installation using
a different base repository and then change it to the unified ISO. If you do that, the base repository is
replaced. However, the AppStream repository is not replaced and points to the original file.
5.3.2. Stage2 image
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, multiple network locations of stage2 or Kickstart files can be specified to
prevent installation failure. This update enables the specification of multiple inst.stage2 and inst.ks
boot options with network locations of stage2 and a Kickstart file. This avoids the situation in which the
requested files cannot be reached and the installation fails because the contacted server with the 
stage2 or the Kickstart file is inaccessible.
With this new update, the installation failure can be avoided if multiple locations are specified. If all the
defined locations are URLs, namely HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP, they will be tried sequentially until the
requested file is fetched successfully. If there is a location that is not a URL, only the last specified
location is tried. The remaining locations are ignored.
CHAPTER 5. INSTALLER AND IMAGE CREATION
13

5.3.3. inst.addrepo parameter
Previously, you could only specify a base repository from the kernel boot parameters. In Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 8, a new kernel parameter, inst.addrepo=<name>,<url>, allows you to specify an
additional repository during installation. This parameter has two mandatory values: the name of the
repository and the URL that points to the repository. For more information, see the inst-addrepo usage.
5.3.4. Installation from an expanded ISO
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 supports installing from a repository on a local hard drive. Previously, the
only installation method from a hard drive was using an ISO image as the installation source. However,
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 ISO image might be too big for some file systems; for example, the
FAT32 file system cannot store files larger than 4 GiB. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, you can enable
installation from a repository on a local hard drive; you only need to specify the directory instead of the
ISO image. For example: inst.repo=hd:<device>:<path to the repository>.
For more information about the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 BaseOS and AppStream repositories, see
the Repositories section of this document.
5.4. INSTALLER GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
5.4.1. The Installation Summary window
The Installation Summary window of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 graphical installation has been
updated to a new three-column layout that provides improved organization of graphical installation
settings.
5.5. SYSTEM PURPOSE NEW IN RHEL
5.5.1. System Purpose support in the graphical installation
Previously, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation program did not provide system purpose
information to Subscription Manager. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, you can set the intended purpose
of the system during a graphical installation by using the System Purpose window, or in a Kickstart
configuration file by using the syspurpose command. When you set a system’s purpose, the
entitlement server receives information that helps auto-attach a subscription that satisfies the intended
use of the system.
5.5.2. System Purpose support in Pykickstart
Previously, it was not possible for the pykickstart library to provide system purpose information to
Subscription Manager. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, pykickstart parses the new syspurpose
command and records the intended purpose of the system during automated and partially-automated
installation. The information is then passed to the installation program, saved on the newly-installed
system, and available for Subscription Manager when subscribing the system.
5.6. INSTALLER MODULE SUPPORT
5.6.1. Installing modules using Kickstart
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
14

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the installation program has been extended to handle all modular
features. Kickstart scripts can now enable module and stream combinations, install module profiles, and
install modular packages.
5.7. KICKSTART CHANGES
The folowing sections describe the changes in Kickstart commands and options in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 8.
5.7.1. auth or authconfig is deprecated in RHEL 8
The auth or authconfig Kickstart command is deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because the 
authconfig tool and package have been removed.
Similarly to authconfig commands issued on command line, authconfig commands in Kickstart scripts
now use the authselect-compat tool to run the new authselect tool. For a description of this
compatibility layer and its known issues, see the manual page authselect-migration(7). The installation
program will automatically detect use of the deprecated commands and install on the system the 
authselect-compat package to provide the compatibility layer.
5.7.2. Kickstart no longer supports Btrfs
The Btrfs file system is not supported in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. As a result, the Graphical User
Interface (GUI) and the Kickstart commands no longer support Btrfs.
5.7.3. Using Kickstart files from previous RHEL releases
If you are using Kickstart files from previous RHEL releases, see the Repositories section of the
Considerations in adopting RHEL 8  document for more information about the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
8 BaseOS and AppStream repositories.
5.7.4. Deprecated Kickstart commands and options
The following Kickstart commands and options have been deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
Where only specific options are listed, the base command and its other options are still available and not
deprecated.
auth or authconfig - use authselect instead
device
deviceprobe
dmraid
install - use the subcommands or methods directly as commands
multipath
bootloader --upgrade
ignoredisk --interactive
partition --active
CHAPTER 5. INSTALLER AND IMAGE CREATION
15

reboot --kexec
Except the auth or authconfig command, using the commands in Kickstart files prints a warning in the
logs.
You can turn the deprecated command warnings into errors with the inst.ksstrict boot option, except
for the auth or authconfig command.
5.7.5. Removed Kickstart commands and options
The following Kickstart commands and options have been completely removed in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 8. Using them in Kickstart files will cause an error.
upgrade (This command had already previously been deprecated.)
btrfs
part/partition btrfs
part --fstype btrfs or partition --fstype btrfs
logvol --fstype btrfs
raid --fstype btrfs
unsupported_hardware
Where only specific options and values are listed, the base command and its other options are still
available and not removed.
5.7.6. New Kickstart commands and options
The following commands and options were added in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Beta.
RHEL 8.2 Beta
rhsm
zipl
The following commands and options were added in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
RHEL 8.0
authselect
module
5.8. IMAGE CREATION
5.8.1. Custom system image creation with Image Builder
The Image Builder tool enables users to create customized RHEL images. Image Builder is available in
AppStream in the lorax-composer package.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
16

With Image Builder, users can create custom system images which include additional packages. Image
Builder functionality can be accessed through:
a graphical user interface in the web console
a command line interface in the composer-cli tool.
Image Builder output formats include, among others:
live ISO disk image
qcow2 file for direct use with a virtual machine or OpenStack
file system image file
cloud images for Azure, VMWare and AWS
To learn more about Image Builder, see the documentation title Composing a customized RHEL system
image.

CHAPTER 6. SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT
6.1. NOTABLE CHANGES TO THE YUM STACK
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, installing software is ensured by the new version of the YUM
tool, which is based on the DNF technology (YUM v4).
6.1.1. Advantages of YUM v4 over YUM v3
YUM v4 has the following advantages over the previous YUM v3 used on RHEL 7:
Increased performance
Support for modular content
Well-designed stable API for integration with tooling
For detailed information about differences between the new YUM v4 tool and the previous version YUM
v3 from RHEL 7, see Changes in DNF CLI compared to YUM .
6.1.2. How to use YUM v4
Installing software
YUM v4 is compatible with YUM v3 when using from the command line, editing or creating
configuration files.
For installing software, you can use the yum command and its particular options in the same way as on
RHEL 7.
See more detailed information on Installing software with yum .
Availability of plug-ins
Legacy YUM v3 plug-ins are incompatible with the new version of YUM v4. Selected yum plug-ins and
utilities have been ported to the new DNF back end, and can be installed under the same names as in
RHEL 7. They also provide compatibility symlinks, so the binaries, configuration files and directories can
be found in usual locations.
In the event that a plug-in is no longer included, or a replacement does not meet a usability need, please
reach out to Red Hat Support to request a Feature Enhancement as described in How do I open and
manage a support case on the Customer Portal?
For more information, see Plugin Interface.
Availability of APIs
Note that the legacy Python API provided by YUM v3 is no longer available. Users are advised to
migrate their plug-ins and scripts to the new API provided by YUM v4 (DNF Python API), which is stable
and fully supported. The upstream project documents the new DNF Python API - see the DNF API
Reference.
The Libdnf and Hawkey APIs (both C and Python) are to be considered unstable, and will likely change
during RHEL 8 life cycle.
6.1.3. Availability of YUM configuration file options

6.1.4. YUM v4 features behaving differently
Some of the YUM v3 features may behave differently in YUM v4. If any such change negatively impacts
your workflows, please open a case with Red Hat Support, as described in How do I open and manage a
support case on the Customer Portal?
6.1.4.1. yum list presents duplicate entries
When listing packages using the yum list command, duplicate entries may be presented, one for each
repository where a package of the same name and version resides.
This is intentional, and it allows the users to distinguish such packages when necessary.
For example, if package-1.2 is available in both repo1 and repo2, YUM v4 will print both instances:
[…​]
package-1.2    repo1
package-1.2    repo2
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
26

[…​]
By contrast, the legacy YUM v3 command filtered out such duplicates so that only one instance was
shown:
[…​]
package-1.2    repo1
[…​]
6.1.5. Changes in the transaction history log files
This section summarizes changes in the transaction history log files between RHEL 7 and RHEL 8.
In RHEL 7, the /var/log/yum.log file stores:
Registry of installations, updates, and removals of the software packages
Transactions from yum and PackageKit
In RHEL 8, there is no direct equivalent to the /var/log/yum.log file. To display the information about
the transactions, including the PackageKit and microdnf, use the yum history command.
Alternatively, you can search the /var/log/dnf.rpm.log file, but this log file does not include the
transactions from PackageKit and microdnf, and it has a log rotation which provides the periodic removal
of the stored information.
6.2. NOTABLE RPM FEATURES AND CHANGES
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 is distributed with RPM 4.14. This version introduces many
enhancements over RPM 4.11, which is available in RHEL 7.
Notable features include:
The debuginfo packages can be installed in parallel
Support for weak dependencies
Support for rich or boolean dependencies
Support for packaging files above 4 GB in size
Support for file triggers
New --nopretrans and --noposttrans switches to disable the execution of the %pretrans and 
%posttrans scriptlets respectively.
New --noplugins switch to disable loading and execution of all RPM plug-ins.
New syslog plug-in for logging any RPM activity by the System Logging protocol (syslog).
The rpmbuild command can now do all build steps from a source package directly.
This is possible if rpmbuild is used with any of the -r[abpcils] options.
Support for the reinstall mode.
CHAPTER 6. SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT
27

This is ensured by the new --reinstall option. To reinstall a previously installed package, use the
syntax below:
rpm {--reinstall} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
This option ensures a proper installation of the new package and removal of the old package.
Support for SSD conservation mode.
This is ensured by the new %_minimize_writes macro, which is available in the 
/usr/lib/rpm/macros file. The macro is by default set to 0. To minize writing to SSD disks, set 
%_minimize_writes to 1.
New rpm2archive utility for converting rpm payload to tar archives
See more information about New RPM features in RHEL 8 .
Notable changes include:
Stricter spec-parser
Simplified signature checking the output in non-verbose mode
Improved support for reproducible builds (builds that create an identical package):
Setting build time
Setting file mtime (file modification time)
Setting buildhost
Using the -p option to query an uninstalled PACKAGE_FILE is now optional. For this use case,
the rpm command now returns the same result with or without the -p option. The only use case
where the -p option is necessary is to verify that the file name does not match any Provides in
the rpmdb database.
Additions and deprecations in macros
The %makeinstall macro has been deprecated. To install a program, use the 
%make_install macro instead.
The rpmbuild --sign command has been deprecated.
Note that using the --sign option with the rpmbuild command has been deprecated. To add a
signature to an already existing package, use rpm --addsign instead.

CHAPTER 7. INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
7.1. TIME SYNCHRONIZATION
Accurate timekeeping is important for a number of reasons. In Linux systems, the Network Time 
Protocol (NTP) protocol is implemented by a daemon running in user space.
7.1.1. Implementation of NTP
RHEL 7 supported two implementations of the NTP protocol: ntp and chrony.
In RHEL 8, the NTP protocol is implemented only by the chronyd daemon, provided by the chrony
package.
The ntp daemon is no longer available. If you used ntp on your RHEL 7 system, you might need to
migrate to chrony.
Possible replacements for previous ntp features that are not supported by chrony are documented in
Achieving some settings previously supported by ntp in chrony .
7.1.2. Introduction to chrony suite
chrony is an implementation of NTP, which performs well in a wide range of conditions, including
intermittent network connections, heavily congested networks, changing temperatures (ordinary
computer clocks are sensitive to temperature), and systems that do not run continuously, or run on a
virtual machine.
You can use chrony:
To synchronize the system clock with NTP servers
To synchronize the system clock with a reference clock, for example a GPS receiver
To synchronize the system clock with a manual time input
As an NTPv4(RFC 5905) server or peer to provide a time service to other computers in the
network
For more information about chrony, see Configuring basic system settings.
7.1.2.1. Differences between chrony and ntp
See the following resources for information about differences between chrony and ntp:
Configuring basic system settings
Comparison of NTP implementations
7.1.2.1.1. Chrony applies leap second correction by default
In RHEL 8, the default chrony configuration file, /etc/chrony.conf, includes the leapsectz directive.
The leapsectz directive enables chronyd to:
Get information about leap seconds from the system tz database (tzdata)
CHAPTER 7. INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
29

Set the TAI-UTC offset of the system clock in order that the system provides an accurate
International Atomic Time (TAI) clock (CLOCK_TAI)
The directive is not compatible with servers that hide leap seconds from their clients using a leap smear,
such as chronyd servers configured with the leapsecmode and smoothtime directives. If a client 
chronyd is configured to synchronize to such servers, remove leapsectz from the configuration file.
7.1.3. Additional information
For more information on how to configure NTP using the chrony suite, see Configuring basic system
settings.
7.2. BIND - IMPLEMENTATION OF DNS
RHEL 8 includes BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) in version 9.11. This version of the DNS server
introduces multiple new features and feature changes compared to version 9.10.
New features:
A new method of provisioning secondary servers called Catalog Zones has been added.
Domain Name System Cookies are now sent by the named service and the dig utility.
The Response Rate Limiting feature can now help with mitigation of DNS amplification
attacks.
Performance of response-policy zone (RPZ) has been improved.
A new zone file format called map has been added. Zone data stored in this format can be
mapped directly into memory, which enables zones to load significantly faster.
A new tool called delv (domain entity lookup and validation) has been added, with dig-like
semantics for looking up DNS data and performing internal DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
validation.
A new mdig command is now available. This command is a version of the dig command that
sends multiple pipelined queries and then waits for responses, instead of sending one query and
waiting for the response before sending the next query.
A new prefetch option, which improves the recursive resolver performance, has been added.
A new in-view zone option, which allows zone data to be shared between views, has been added.
When this option is used, multiple views can serve the same zones authoritatively without
storing multiple copies in memory.
A new max-zone-ttl option, which enforces maximum TTLs for zones, has been added. When a
zone containing a higher TTL is loaded, the load fails. Dynamic DNS (DDNS) updates with
higher TTLs are accepted but the TTL is truncated.
New quotas have been added to limit queries that are sent by recursive resolvers to
authoritative servers experiencing denial-of-service attacks.
The nslookup utility now looks up both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses by default.
The named service now checks whether other name server processes are running before
starting up.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
30

When loading a signed zone, named now checks whether a Resource Record Signature’s (RSIG)
inception time is in the future, and if so, it regenerates the RRSIG immediately.
Zone transfers now use smaller message sizes to improve message compression, which reduces
network usage.
Feature changes:
The version 3 XML schema for the statistics channel, including new statistics and a flattened
XML tree for faster parsing, is provided by the HTTP interface. The legacy version 2 XML
schema is no longer supported.
The named service now listens on both IPv6 and IPv4 interfaces by default.
The named service no longer supports GeoIP. Access control lists (ACLs) defined by presumed
location of query sender are unavailable.
7.3. DNS RESOLUTION
In RHEL 7, the nslookup and host utilities were able to accept any reply without the recursion 
available flag from any name server listed. In RHEL 8, nslookup and host ignore replies from name
servers with recursion not available unless it is the name server that is last configured. In case of the last
configured name server, answer is accepted even without the recursion available flag.
However, if the last configured name server is not responding or unreachable, name resolution fails. To
prevent such fail, you can use one of the following approaches:
Ensure that configured name servers always reply with the recursion available flag set.
Allow recursion for all internal clients.
Optionally, you can also use the dig utility to detect whether recursion is available or not.
7.4. PRINTING
7.4.1. Print settings tools
The Print Settings configuration tool, which was used in RHEL 7, is no longer available.
To achieve various tasks related to printing, you can choose one of the following tools:
CUPS web user interface (UI)
GNOME Control center
For more information on print setting tools in RHEL 8, see Deploying different types of servers.
7.4.2. Location of CUPs logs
CUPS provides three kinds of logs:
Error log
Access log
CHAPTER 7. INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
31

Page log
In RHEL 8, the logs are no longer stored in specific files within the /var/log/cups directory, which was
used in RHEL 7. Instead, all three types are logged centrally in systemd-journald together with logs from
other programs.
For more information on how to use CUPS logs in RHEL 8, see Deploying different types of servers.
7.4.3. Additional information
For more information how to configure printing in RHEL 8, see Deploying different types of servers.
7.5. PERFORMANCE AND POWER MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
7.5.1. Notable changes in the recommended Tuned profile
In RHEL 8, the recommended Tuned profile, reported by the tuned-adm recommend command, is
selected based on the following rules:
If the syspurpose role (reported by the syspurpose show command) contains atomic, and at
the same time:
if Tuned is running on bare metal, the atomic-host profile is selected
if Tuned is running in a virtual machine, the atomic-guest profile is selected
If Tuned is running in a virtual machine, the virtual-guest profile is selected
If the syspurpose role contains desktop or workstation and the chassis type (reported by 
dmidecode) is Notebook, Laptop, or Portable, then the balanced profile is selected
If none of the above rules matches, the throughput-performance profile is selected
Note that the first rule that matches takes effect.

CHAPTER 8. SECURITY
8.1. CHANGES IN CORE CRYPTOGRAPHIC COMPONENTS
8.1.1. System-wide cryptographic policies are applied by default
Crypto-policies is a component in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, which configures the core cryptographic
subsystems, covering the TLS, IPsec, DNSSEC, Kerberos protocols, and the OpenSSH suite. It provides
a small set of policies, which the administrator can select using the update-crypto-policies command.
The DEFAULT system-wide cryptographic policy offers secure settings for current threat models. It
allows the TLS 1.2 and 1.3 protocols, as well as the IKEv2 and SSH2 protocols. The RSA keys and Diffie-
Hellman parameters are accepted if larger than 2047 bits.
See the Consistent security by crypto policies in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  article on the Red Hat Blog
and the update-crypto-policies(8) man page for more information.
8.1.2. Strong crypto defaults by removing insecure cipher suites and protocols
The following list contains cipher suites and protocols removed from the core cryptographic libraries in
RHEL 8. They are not present in the sources, or their support is disabled during the build, so applications
cannot use them.
DES (since RHEL 7)
All export grade cipher suites (since RHEL 7)
MD5 in signatures (since RHEL 7)
SSLv2 (since RHEL 7)
SSLv3 (since RHEL 8)
All ECC curves < 224 bits (since RHEL 6)
All binary field ECC curves (since RHEL 6)
8.1.3. Cipher suites and protocols disabled in all policy levels
The following cipher suites and protocols are disabled in all crypto policy levels. They can be enabled
only by an explicit configuration of individual applications.
DH with parameters < 1024 bits
RSA with key size < 1024 bits
Camellia
ARIA
SEED
IDEA
Integrity-only cipher suites
CHAPTER 8. SECURITY
37

TLS CBC mode cipher suites using SHA-384 HMAC
AES-CCM8
All ECC curves incompatible with TLS 1.3, including secp256k1
IKEv1 (since RHEL 8)
8.1.4. Switching the system to FIPS mode
The system-wide cryptographic policies contain a policy level that enables cryptographic modules self-
checks in accordance with the requirements by Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
Publication 140-2. The fips-mode-setup tool that enables or disables FIPS mode internally uses the 
FIPS system-wide cryptographic policy level.
To switch the system to FIPS mode in RHEL 8, enter the following command and restart your system:
# fips-mode-setup --enable
See the fips-mode-setup(8) man page for more information.
8.1.5. TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are deprecated
The TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols are disabled in the DEFAULT system-wide cryptographic policy level.
If your scenario, for example, a video conferencing application in the Firefox web browser, requires using
the deprecated protocols, switch the system-wide cryptographic policy to the LEGACY level:
# update-crypto-policies --set LEGACY
For more information, see the Strong crypto defaults in RHEL 8 and deprecation of weak crypto
algorithms Knowledgebase article on the Red Hat Customer Portal and the update-crypto-policies(8)
man page.
8.1.6. TLS 1.3 support in cryptographic libraries
This update enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 by default in all major back-end crypto libraries.
This enables low latency across the operating system communications layer and enhances privacy and
security for applications by taking advantage of new algorithms, such as RSA-PSS or X25519.
8.1.7. DSA is deprecated in RHEL 8
The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is considered deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
Authentication mechanisms that depend on DSA keys do not work in the default configuration. Note
that OpenSSH clients do not accept DSA host keys even in the LEGACY system-wide cryptographic
policy level.
8.1.8. SSL2 Client Hello has been deprecated in NSS
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2 and earlier allow to start a negotiation with a 
Client Hello message formatted in a way that is backward compatible with the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) protocol version 2. Support for this feature in the Network Security Services ( NSS) library has
been deprecated and it is disabled by default.

38

Applications that require support for this feature need to use the new 
SSL_ENABLE_V2_COMPATIBLE_HELLO API to enable it. Support for this feature may be removed
completely in future releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
8.1.9. NSS now use SQL by default
The Network Security Services (NSS) libraries now use the SQL file format for the trust database by
default. The DBM file format, which was used as a default database format in previous releases, does not
support concurrent access to the same database by multiple processes and it has been deprecated in
upstream. As a result, applications that use the NSS trust database to store keys, certificates, and
revocation information now create databases in the SQL format by default. Attempts to create
databases in the legacy DBM format fail. The existing DBM databases are opened in read-only mode,
and they are automatically converted to the SQL format. Note that NSS support the SQL file format
since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
8.2. SSH
8.2.1. OpenSSH rebased to version 7.8p1
The openssh packages have been upgraded to upstream version 7.8p1. Notable changes include:
Removed support for the SSH version 1 protocol.
Removed support for the hmac-ripemd160 message authentication code.
Removed support for RC4 (arcfour) ciphers.
Removed support for Blowfish ciphers.
Removed support for CAST ciphers.
Changed the default value of the UseDNS option to no.
Disabled DSA public key algorithms by default.
Changed the minimal modulus size for Diffie-Hellman parameters to 2048 bits.
Changed semantics of the ExposeAuthInfo configuration option.
The UsePrivilegeSeparation=sandbox option is now mandatory and cannot be disabled.
Set the minimal accepted RSA key size to 1024 bits.
8.2.2. libssh implements SSH as a core cryptographic component
This change introduces libssh as a core cryptographic component in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. The 
libssh library implements the Secure SHell (SSH) protocol.
Note that libssh does not comply with the system-wide crypto policy.
8.2.3. libssh2 is not available in RHEL 8
The deprecated libssh2 library misses features, such as support for elliptic curves or Generic Security
Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI), and it has been removed from RHEL 8 in favor of 
libssh
CHAPTER 8. SECURITY
39

8.3. RSYSLOG
8.3.1. The default rsyslog configuration file format is now non-legacy
The configuration files in the rsyslog packages now use the non-legacy format by default. The legacy
format can be still used, although mixing current and legacy configuration statements has several
constraints. Configurations carried from previous RHEL releases should be revised. See the 
rsyslog.conf(5) man page for more information.
8.3.2. The imjournal option and configuring system logging with minimized journald
usage
To avoid duplicate records that might appear when journald rotated its files, the imjournal option has
been added. Note that use of this option can affect performance.
Note that the system with rsyslog can be configured to provide better performance as described in the
Configuring system logging without journald or with minimized journald usage  Knowledgebase article.
8.3.3. Negative effects of the default logging setup on performance
The default logging environment setup might consume 4 GB of memory or even more and adjustments
of rate-limit values are complex when systemd-journald is running with rsyslog.
See the Negative effects of the RHEL default logging setup on performance and their mitigations
Knowledgebase article for more information.
8.4. OPENSCAP
8.4.1. OpenSCAP API consolidated
This update provides OpenSCAP shared library API that has been consolidated. 63 symbols have been
removed, 14 added, and 4 have an updated signature. The removed symbols in OpenSCAP 1.3.0 include:
symbols that were marked as deprecated in version 1.2.0
SEAP protocol symbols
internal helper functions
unused library symbols
unimplemented symbols
8.4.2. A utility for security and compliance scanning of containers is not available
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the oscap-docker utility can be used for scanning of Docker containers
based on Atomic technologies. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the Docker- and Atomic-related
OpenSCAP commands are not available. As a result, oscap-docker or an equivalent utility for security
and compliance scanning of containers is not available in RHEL 8 at the moment.
8.5. AUDIT
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
40

8.5.1. Audit 3.0 replaces audispd with auditd
With this update, functionality of audispd has been moved to auditd. As a result, audispd configuration
options are now part of auditd.conf. In addition, the plugins.d directory has been moved under 
/etc/audit. The current status of auditd and its plug-ins can now be checked by running the service 
auditd state command.
8.6. SELINUX
8.6.1. New SELinux booleans
This update of the SELinux system policy introduces the following booleans:
colord_use_nfs
mysql_connect_http
pdns_can_network_connect_db
ssh_use_tcpd
sslh_can_bind_any_port
sslh_can_connect_any_port
virt_use_pcscd
To get a list of booleans including their meaning, and to find out if they are enabled or disabled, install
the selinux-policy-devel package and use:
# semanage boolean -l
8.6.2. SELinux packages migrated to Python 3
The functionality of the libselinux-python package is now provided by the python3-libselinux
package, and the policycoreutils-python has been replaced by the policycoreutils-python-utils and 
python3-policycoreutils packages.
8.7. REMOVED SECURITY FUNCTIONALITY
8.7.1. shadow-utils no longer allow all-numeric user and group names
The useradd and groupadd commands disallow user and group names consisting purely of numeric
characters. The reason for not allowing such names is that this can confuse potentially many tools that
work with user and group names and user and group ids (which are numbers). Please note that the all-
numeric user and group names are deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and their support is
completely removed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
8.7.2. securetty is now disabled by default
Because of the dynamic nature of tty device files on modern Linux systems, the securetty PAM module
has been disabled by default and the /etc/securetty configuration file is no longer included in RHEL.
Since /etc/securetty listed many possible devices so that the practical effect in most cases was to allow
CHAPTER 8. SECURITY
41

by default, this change has only a minor impact. However, if you use a more restrictive configuration, you
need to add a line enabling the pam_securetty.so module to the appropriate files in the /etc/pam.d
directory, and create a new /etc/securetty file.
8.7.3. The Clevis HTTP pin has been removed
The Clevis HTTP pin has been removed from RHEL 8, and the clevis encrypt http sub-command is no
longer available.
8.7.3.1. Coolkey has been removed
The Coolkey driver for smart cards has been removed from RHEL 8, and OpenSC now provides its
functionality.
8.7.3.2. crypto-utils have been removed
The crypto-utils packages have been removed from RHEL 8. You can use tools provided by the 
openssl, gnutls-utils, and nss-tools packages instead.
8.7.3.3. KLIPS has been removed from Libreswan
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, support for Kernel IP Security (KLIPS) IPsec stack has been removed
from Libreswan.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8

CHAPTER 9. NETWORKING
9.1. NETWORKMANAGER
9.1.1. Legacy network scripts support
Network scripts are deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and are no longer provided by default.
The basic installation provides a new version of the ifup and ifdown scripts which call NetworkManager
through the nmcli tool. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, to run the ifup and the ifdown scripts,
NetworkManager must be running.
NOTE
Custom commands in /sbin/ifup-local, ifdown-pre-local and ifdown-local scripts are not
executed.
If any of these scripts are required, the installation of the deprecated network scripts in
the system is still possible with the following command:
~]# yum install network-scripts
The ifup and the ifdown scripts link to the installed legacy network scripts.
Calling the legacy network scripts shows a warning about their deprecation.
9.1.2. NetworkManager supports SR-IOV virtual functions
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, NetworkManager allows configuring the number of virtual functions (VF)
for interfaces that support single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV). Additionally, NetworkManager
allows configuring some attributes of the VFs, such as the MAC address, VLAN, the spoof checking
setting and allowed bitrates. Note that all properties related to SR-IOV are available in the sriov
connection setting. For more details, see the nm-settings(5) man page.
9.1.3. NetworkManager supports a wildcard interface name match for connections
Previously, it was possible to restrict a connection to a given interface using only an exact match on the
interface name. With this update, connections have a new match.interface-name property which
supports wildcards. This update enables users to choose the interface for a connection in a more flexible
way using a wildcard pattern.
9.1.4. NetworkManager supports configuring ethtool offload features
With this enhancement, NetworkManager supports configuring ethtool offload features, and users no
longer need to use init scripts or a NetworkManager dispatcher script. As a result, users can now
configure the offload feature as a part of the connection profile using one of the following methods:
By using the nmcli utility
By editing key files in the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory
By editing the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* files
Note that this feature is currently not supported in graphical interfaces and in the nmtui utility.
CHAPTER 9. NETWORKING
43

9.1.5. NetworkManager now uses the internal DHCP plug-in by default
NetworkManager supports the internal and dhclient DHCP plug-ins. By default, NetworkManager in
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 uses the dhclient and RHEL 8 the internal plug-in. In certain
situations, the plug-ins behave differently. For example, dhclient can use additional settings specified in
the /etc/dhcp/ directory.
If you upgrade from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8 and NetworkManager behaves different, add the following
setting to the [main] section in the /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file to use the 
dhclient plug-in:
[main]
dhcp=dhclient
9.1.6. The NetworkManager-config-server package is not installed by default in
RHEL 8
The NetworkManager-config-server package is only installed by default if you select either the Server
or Server with GUI base environment during the setup. If you selected a different environment, use the 
yum install NetworkManager-config-server command to install the package.
9.2. PACKET FILTERING
9.2.1. nftables replaces iptables as the default network packet filtering framework
The nftables framework provides packet classification facilities and it is the designated successor to the
iptables, ip6tables, arptables, and ebtables tools. It offers numerous improvements in convenience,
features, and performance over previous packet-filtering tools, most notably:
lookup tables instead of linear processing
a single framework for both the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols
rules all applied atomically instead of fetching, updating, and storing a complete rule set
support for debugging and tracing in the rule set (nftrace) and monitoring trace events (in the 
nft tool)
more consistent and compact syntax, no protocol-specific extensions
a Netlink API for third-party applications
Similarly to iptables, nftables use tables for storing chains. The chains contain individual rules for
performing actions. The nft tool replaces all tools from the previous packet-filtering frameworks. The 
libnftables library can be used for low-level interaction with nftables Netlink API over the libmnl library.
The iptables, ip6tables, ebtables and arptables tools are replaced by nftables-based drop-in
replacements with the same name. While external behavior is identical to their legacy counterparts,
internally they use nftables with legacy netfilter kernel modules through a compatibility interface where
required.
Effect of the modules on the nftables rule set can be observed using the nft list ruleset command.
Since these tools add tables, chains, and rules to the nftables rule set, be aware that nftables rule-set
operations, such as the nft flush ruleset command, might affect rule sets installed using the formerly

separate legacy commands.
To quickly identify which variant of the tool is present, version information has been updated to include
the back-end name. In RHEL 8, the nftables-based iptables tool prints the following version string:
$ iptables --version
iptables v1.8.0 (nf_tables)
For comparison, the following version information is printed if legacy iptables tool is present:
$ iptables --version
iptables v1.8.0 (legacy)
9.2.2. Arptables FORWARD is removed from filter tables in RHEL 8
The arptables FORWARD chain functionality has been removed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.
You can now use the FORWARD chain of the ebtables tool adding the rules into it.
9.2.3. Output of iptables-ebtables is not 100% compatible with ebtables
In RHEL 8, the ebtables command is provided by the iptables-ebtables package, which contains an 
nftables-based reimplementation of the tool. This tool has a different code base, and its output
deviates in aspects, which are either negligible or deliberate design choices.
Consequently, when migrating your scripts parsing some ebtables output, adjust the scripts to reflect
the following:
MAC address formatting has been changed to be fixed in length. Where necessary, individual
byte values contain a leading zero to maintain the format of two characters per octet.
Formatting of IPv6 prefixes has been changed to conform with RFC 4291. The trailing part after
the slash character no longer contains a netmask in the IPv6 address format but a prefix length.
This change applies to valid (left-contiguous) masks only, while others are still printed in the old
formatting.
9.2.4. New tools to convert iptables to nftables
This update adds the iptables-translate and ip6tables-translate tools to convert the existing iptables
or ip6tables rules into the equivalent ones for nftables. Note that some extensions lack translation
support. If such an extension exists, the tool prints the untranslated rule prefixed with the # sign. For
example:
| % iptables-translate -A INPUT -j CHECKSUM --checksum-fill
| nft # -A INPUT -j CHECKSUM --checksum-fill
Additionally, users can use the iptables-restore-translate and ip6tables-restore-translate tools to
translate a dump of rules. Note that before that, users can use the iptables-save or ip6tables-save
commands to print a dump of current rules. For example:
| % sudo iptables-save >/tmp/iptables.dump
| % iptables-restore-translate -f /tmp/iptables.dump
| # Translated by iptables-restore-translate v1.8.0 on Wed Oct 17 17:00:13 2018

9.3. CHANGES IN WPA_SUPPLICANT
9.3.1. journalctl can now read the wpa_supplicant log
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, the wpa_supplicant package is built with 
CONFIG_DEBUG_SYSLOG enabled. This allows reading the wpa_supplicant log using the journalctl
utility instead of checking the contents of the /var/log/wpa_supplicant.log file.
9.3.2. The compile-time support for wireless extensions in wpa_supplicant is disabled
The wpa_supplicant package does not support wireless extensions. When a user is trying to use wext
as a command-line argument, or trying to use it on old adapters which only support wireless extensions,
will not be able to run the wpa_supplicant daemon.
9.4. A NEW DATA CHUNK TYPE, I-DATA, ADDED TO SCTP
This update adds a new data chunk type, I-DATA, and stream schedulers to the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP). Previously, SCTP sent user messages in the same order as they were
sent by a user. Consequently, a large SCTP user message blocked all other messages in any stream until
completely sent. When using I-DATA chunks, the Transmission Sequence Number (TSN) field is not
overloaded. As a result, SCTP now can schedule the streams in different ways, and I-DATA allows user
messages interleaving (RFC 8260). Note that both peers must support the I-DATA chunk type.
9.5. NOTABLE TCP FEATURES IN RHEL 8
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is distributed with TCP networking stack version 4.18, which provides higher
performances, better scalability, and more stability. Performances are boosted especially for busy TCP
server with a high ingress connection rate.
Additionally, two new TCP congestion algorithms, BBR and NV, are available, offering lower latency, and
better throughput than cubic in most scenarios.
9.5.1. TCP BBR support in RHEL 8
A new TCP congestion control algorithm, Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip time (BBR) is now
supported in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8. BBR attempts to determine the bandwidth of the
bottleneck link and the Round-trip time (RTT). Most congestion algorithms are based on packet loss
(including CUBIC, the default Linux TCP congestion control algorithm), which have problems on high-
throughput links. BBR does not react to loss events directly, it adjusts the TCP pacing rate to match it
with the available bandwidth. Users of TCP BBR should switch to the fq queueing setting on all the
involved interfaces.
Note that users should explicitly use fq and not fq_codel.
For more details, see the tc-fq man page.
9.6. VLAN-RELATED CHANGES
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
46

9.6.1. IPVLAN virtual network drivers are now supported
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0, the kernel includes support for IPVLAN virtual network drivers. With this
update, IPVLAN virtual Network Interface Cards (NICs) enable the network connectivity for multiple
containers exposing a single MAC address to the local network. This allows a single host to have a lot of
containers overcoming the possible limitation on the number of MAC addresses supported by the peer
networking equipment.
9.6.2. Certain network adapters require a firmware update to fully support 802.1ad
The firmware of certain network adapters does not fully support the 802.1ad standard, which is also
called Q-in-Q or stacked virtual local area networks (VLANs). Contact your hardware vendor on details
how to verify that your network adapter uses a firmware that supports the 802.1ad standard and how to
update the firmware. As a result, with the correct firmware, configuring stacked VLANs on RHEL 8.0
work as expected.
9.7. NETWORK INTERFACE NAME CHANGES
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the same consistent network device naming scheme is used by default as
in RHEL 7. However, certain kernel drivers, such as e1000e, nfp, qede, sfc, tg3 and bnxt_en changed
their consistent name on a fresh installation of RHEL 8. However, the names are preserved on upgrade
from RHEL 7.
9.8. THE -OK OPTION OF THE TC COMMAND REMOVED
The -ok option of the tc command has been removed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. As a workaround,
users can implement code to communicate directly via netlink with the kernel. Response messages
received, indicate completion and status of sent requests. An alternative way for less time-critical
applications is to call tc for each command separately. This may happen with a custom script which
simulates the tc -batch behavior by printing OK for each successful tc invocation.

CHAPTER 10. KERNEL
10.1. RESOURCE CONTROL
10.1.1. Control group v2 available as a Technology Preview in RHEL 8
Control group v2 mechanism is a unified hierarchy control group. Control group v2 organizes
processes hierarchically and distributes system resources along the hierarchy in a controlled and
configurable manner.
Unlike the previous version, control group v2 has only a single hierarchy. This single hierarchy enables
the Linux kernel to:
Categorize processes based on the role of their owner.
Eliminate issues with conflicting policies of multiple hierarchies.
Control group v2 supports numerous controllers:
CPU controller regulates the distribution of CPU cycles. This controller implements:
Weight and absolute bandwidth limit models for normal scheduling policy.
Absolute bandwidth allocation model for real time scheduling policy.
Memory controller regulates the memory distribution. Currently, the following types of memory
usages are tracked:
Userland memory - page cache and anonymous memory.
Kernel data structures such as dentries and inodes.
TCP socket buffers.
I/O controller regulates the distribution of I/O resources.
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) controller limits RDMA/IB specific resources that
certain processes can use. These processes are grouped through the RDMA controller.
Process number controller enables the control group to stop any new tasks from being fork()’d
or clone()’d after a certain limit.
Writeback controller acts as a mechanism, which balances conflicts between I/O and the
memory controllers.
The information above was based on cgroups-v2 online documentation. You can refer to the same link to
obtain more information about particular control group v2 controllers.
10.2. MEMORY MANAGEMENT
10.2.1. 52-bit PA for 64-bit ARM available
With this update, support for 52-bit physical addressing (PA) for the 64-bit ARM architecture is
available. This provides a larger physical address space than previous 48-bit PA.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
48

10.2.2. 5-level page tables x86_64
With Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, existing memory bus had 48/46 bit of virtual/physical memory
addressing capacity, and the Linux kernel implemented 4 levels of page tables to manage these virtual
addresses to physical addresses. The physical bus addressing line put the physical memory upper limit
capacity at 64 TB.
These limits have been extended to 57/52 bit of virtual/physical memory addressing with 128 PiB of
virtual address space (64PB user/64PB kernel) and 4 PB of physical memory capacity.
With the extended address range, the memory management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 adds support
for 5-level page table implementation, to be able to handle the expanded address range. By default
RHEL8 will disable the 5-level page table support even on systems that support this feature. This is due
to a potential performance degradation when using 5 level of page tables if extended virtual or physical
address space is not needed. A boot argument will enable systems with hardware that supports this
feature to use it.
10.3. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND OBSERVABILITY TOOLS
10.3.1. bpftool added to kernel
The bpftool utility that serves for inspection and simple manipulation of programs and maps based on
extended Berkeley Packet Filtering (eBPF) has been added into the Linux kernel. bpftool is a part of the
kernel source tree, and is provided by the bpftool package, which is included as a sub-package of the
kernel package.
10.3.2. eBPF available as a Technology Preview
The extended Berkeley Packet Filtering (eBPF) feature is available as a Technology Preview for both
networking and tracing. eBPF enables the user space to attach custom programs onto a variety of
points (sockets, trace points, packet reception) to receive and process data. The feature includes a new
system call bpf(), which supports creating various types of maps, and also to insert various types of
programs into the kernel. Note that the bpf() syscall can be successfully used only by a user with the 
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, such as a root user. See the bpf(2) man page for more information.
10.3.3. BCC is available as a Technology Preview
BPF Compiler Collection (BCC) is a user space tool kit for creating efficient kernel tracing and
manipulation programs that is available as a Technology Preview in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. BCC
provides tools for I/O analysis, networking, and monitoring of Linux operating systems using the 
extended Berkeley Packet Filtering (eBPF).
10.4. BOOTING PROCESS
10.4.1. How to install and boot custom kernels in RHEL 8
The Boot Loader Specification (BLS) defines a scheme and file format to manage bootloader
configurations for each boot option in a drop-in directory. There is no need to manipulate the individual
drop-in configuration files. This premise is particularly relevant in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because
not all architectures use the same bootloader:
x86_64, aarch64 and ppc64le with open firmware use GRUB2
CHAPTER 10. KERNEL
49

ppc64le with Open Power Abstraction Layer (OPAL) uses Petitboot
s390x uses zipl
Each bootloader has a different configuration file and format that has to be modified when a new kernel
is installed or removed. In the previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux the component that
permitted this work was the grubby utility. However, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 the bootloader
configuration was standardized by implementing the BLS file format, where grubby works as a thin
wrapper around the BLS operations.
10.4.2. Early kdump support in RHEL 8
Previously, the kdump service started too late to register the kernel crashes that occurred in early
stages of the booting process. As a result, the crash information together with a chance for
troubleshooting was lost.
To address this problem, RHEL 8 introduced an early kdump support. To learn more about this
mechanism, see the /usr/share/doc/kexec-tools/early-kdump-howto.txt file. See also What is early
kdump support and how do I configure it?.

11.1.3. Other removed hardware support
11.1.3.1. AGP graphics cards are no longer supported
Graphics cards using the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) bus are not supported in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 8. Use the graphics cards with the PCI Express bus as the recommended replacement.
11.1.3.2. FCoE software removal
CHAPTER 11. HARDWARE ENABLEMENT
59

Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) software has been removed from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
Specifically, the fcoe.ko kernel module is no longer available for creating software FCoE interfaces over
Ethernet adapters and drivers. This change is due to a lack of industry adoption for software-managed
FCoE.
Specific changes to Red Hat Enterprise 8 include:
The fcoe.ko kernel module is no longer available. This removes support for software FCoE with
Data Center Bridging enabled Ethernet adapters and drivers.
Link-level software configuration via Data Center Bridging eXchange (DCBX) using lldpad is no
longer supported for FCoE.
The fcoe-utils tools (specifically fcoemon) is configured by default to not validate DCB
configuration or communicate with lldpad.
The lldpad integration in fcoemon might be permanently disabled.
The libhbaapi and libhbalinux libraries are no longer used by fcoe-utils, and will not undergo
any direct testing from Red Hat.
Support for the following remains unchanged:
Currently supported offloading FCoE adapters that appear as Fibre Channel adapters to the
operating system and do not use the fcoe-utils management tools, unless stated in a separate
note. This applies to select adapters supported by the lpfc FC driver. Note that the bfa driver is
not included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
Currently supported offloading FCoE adapters that do use the fcoe-utils management tools
but have their own kernel drivers instead of fcoe.ko and manage DCBX configuration in their
drivers and/or firmware, unless stated in a separate note. The fnic, bnx2fc, and qedf drivers will
continue to be fully supported in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
The libfc.ko and libfcoe.ko kernel modules that are required for some of the supported drivers
covered by the previous statement.
For more information, see Section 12.2.8, “Software FCoE and Fibre Channel no longer support the
target mode”.
11.1.3.3. The e1000 network driver is not supported in RHEL 8
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the e1000 network driver is not supported. This affects both bare metal
and virtual environments. However, the newer e1000e network driver continues to be fully supported in
RHEL 8.
11.1.3.4. RHEL 8 does not support the tulip driver
With this update, the tulip network driver is no longer supported. As a consequence, when using RHEL 8
on a Generation 1 virtual machine (VM) on the Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor, the "Legacy Network
Adapter" device does not work, which causes PXE installation of such VMs to fail.
For the PXE installation to work, install RHEL 8 on a Generation 2 Hyper-V VM. If you require a RHEL 8
Generation 1 VM, use ISO installation.
11.1.3.5. The qla2xxx driver no longer supports target mode
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
60

Support for target mode with the qla2xxx QLogic Fibre Channel driver has been disabled. The effects
of this change are:
The kernel no longer provides the tcm_qla2xxx module.
The rtslib library and the targetcli utility no longer support qla2xxx.
Initiator mode with qla2xxx is still supported.
CHAPTER 11. HARDWARE ENABLEMENT
61

CHAPTER 12. FILE SYSTEMS AND STORAGE
12.1. FILE SYSTEMS
12.1.1. Btrfs has been removed
The Btrfs file system has been removed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. This includes the following
components:
The btrfs.ko kernel module
The btrfs-progs package
The snapper package
You can no longer create, mount, or install on Btrfs file systems in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. The
Anaconda installer and the Kickstart commands no longer support Btrfs.
12.1.2. XFS now supports shared copy-on-write data extents
The XFS file system supports shared copy-on-write data extent functionality. This feature enables two
or more files to share a common set of data blocks. When either of the files sharing common blocks
changes, XFS breaks the link to common blocks and creates a new file. This is similar to the copy-on-
write (COW) functionality found in other file systems.
Shared copy-on-write data extents are:
Fast
Creating shared copies does not utilize disk I/O.
Space-efficient
Shared blocks do not consume additional disk space.
Transparent
Files sharing common blocks act like regular files.
Userspace utilities can use shared copy-on-write data extents for:
Efficient file cloning, such as with the cp --reflink command
Per-file snapshots
This functionality is also used by kernel subsystems such as Overlayfs and NFS for more efficient
operation.
Shared copy-on-write data extents are now enabled by default when creating an XFS file system,
starting with the xfsprogs package version 4.17.0-2.el8.
Note that Direct Access (DAX) devices currently do not support XFS with shared copy-on-write data
extents. To create an XFS file system without this feature, use the following command:
# mkfs.xfs -m reflink=0 block-device
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 can mount XFS file systems with shared copy-on-write data extents only in
the read-only mode.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
62

12.1.3. The ext4 file system now supports metadata checksums
With this update, ext4 metadata is protected by checksums. This enables the file system to recognize
the corrupt metadata, which avoids damage and increases the file system resilience.
12.1.4. The /etc/sysconfig/nfs file and legacy NFS service names are no longer available
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0, the NFS configuration has moved from the /etc/sysconfig/nfs
configuration file, which was used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, to /etc/nfs.conf.
The /etc/nfs.conf file uses a different syntax. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 attempts to automatically
convert all options from /etc/sysconfig/nfs to /etc/nfs.conf when upgrading from Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7.
Both configuration files are supported in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat recommends that you use
the new /etc/nfs.conf file to make NFS configuration in all versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
compatible with automated configuration systems.
Additionally, the following NFS service aliases have been removed and replaced by their upstream
names:
nfs.service, replaced by nfs-server.service
nfs-secure.service, replaced by rpc-gssd.service
rpcgssd.service, replaced by rpc-gssd.service
nfs-idmap.service, replaced by nfs-idmapd.service
rpcidmapd.service, replaced by nfs-idmapd.service
nfs-lock.service, replaced by rpc-statd.service
nfslock.service, replaced by rpc-statd.service
12.2. STORAGE
12.2.1. The BOOM boot manager simplifies the process of creating boot entries
BOOM is a boot manager for Linux systems that use boot loaders supporting the BootLoader
Specification for boot entry configuration. It enables flexible boot configuration and simplifies the
creation of new or modified boot entries: for example, to boot snapshot images of the system created
using LVM.
BOOM does not modify the existing boot loader configuration, and only inserts additional entries. The
existing configuration is maintained, and any distribution integration, such as kernel installation and
update scripts, continue to function as before.
BOOM has a simplified command-line interface (CLI) and API that ease the task of creating boot
entries.
12.2.2. Stratis is now available
Stratis is a new local storage manager. It provides managed file systems on top of pools of storage with
additional features to the user.
CHAPTER 12. FILE SYSTEMS AND STORAGE
63

Stratis enables you to more easily perform storage tasks such as:
Manage snapshots and thin provisioning
Automatically grow file system sizes as needed
Maintain file systems
To administer Stratis storage, use the stratis utility, which communicates with the stratisd background
service.
Stratis is provided as a Technology Preview.
For more information, see the Stratis documentation: Managing layered local storage with Stratis .
12.2.3. LUKS2 is now the default format for encrypting volumes
In RHEL 8, the LUKS version 2 (LUKS2) format replaces the legacy LUKS (LUKS1) format. The dm-
crypt subsystem and the cryptsetup tool now uses LUKS2 as the default format for encrypted
volumes. LUKS2 provides encrypted volumes with metadata redundancy and auto-recovery in case of a
partial metadata corruption event.
Due to the internal flexible layout, LUKS2 is also an enabler of future features. It supports auto-
unlocking through the generic kernel-keyring token built in libcryptsetup that allow users unlocking of
LUKS2 volumes using a passphrase stored in the kernel-keyring retention service.
Other notable enhancements include:
The protected key setup using the wrapped key cipher scheme.
Easier integration with Policy-Based Decryption (Clevis).
Up to 32 key slots - LUKS1 provides only 8 key slots.
For more details, see the cryptsetup(8) and cryptsetup-reencrypt(8) man pages.
12.2.4. Multiqueue scheduling on block devices
Block devices now use multiqueue scheduling in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. This enables the block layer
performance to scale well with fast solid-state drives (SSDs) and multi-core systems.
The SCSI Multiqueue (scsi-mq) driver is now enabled by default, and the kernel boots with the 
scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=Y option. This change is consistent with the upstream Linux kernel.
Device Mapper Multipath (DM Multipath) requires the scsi-mq driver to be active.
12.2.5. VDO now supports all architectures
Virtual Data Optimizer (VDO) is now available on all of the architectures supported by RHEL 8.
12.2.6. VDO no longer supports read cache
The read cache functionality has been removed from Virtual Data Optimizer (VDO). The read cache is
always disabled on VDO volumes, and you can no longer enable it using the --readCache option of the 
vdo utility.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
64

Red Hat might reintroduce the VDO read cache in a later Red Hat Enterprise Linux release, using a
different implementation.
12.2.7. The dmraid package has been removed
The dmraid package has been removed from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. Users requiring support for
combined hardware and software RAID host bus adapters (HBA) should use the mdadm utility, which
supports native MD software RAID, the SNIA RAID Common Disk Data Format (DDF), and the Intel®
Matrix Storage Manager (IMSM) formats.
12.2.8. Software FCoE and Fibre Channel no longer support the target mode
Software FCoE: NIC Software FCoE target functionality is removed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
8.0.
Fibre Channel no longer supports the target mode. Target mode is disabled for the qla2xxx
QLogic Fibre Channel driver in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0.
For more information, see Section 11.1.3.2, “FCoE software removal”.
12.2.9. The detection of marginal paths in DM Multipath has been improved
The multipathd service now supports improved detection of marginal paths. This helps multipath
devices avoid paths that are likely to fail repeatedly, and improves performance. Marginal paths are
paths with persistent but intermittent I/O errors.
The following options in the /etc/multipath.conf file control marginal paths behavior:
marginal_path_double_failed_time
marginal_path_err_sample_time
marginal_path_err_rate_threshold
marginal_path_err_recheck_gap_time
DM Multipath disables a path and tests it with repeated I/O for the configured sample time if:
the listed multipath.conf options are set,
a path fails twice in the configured time, and
other paths are available.
If the path has more than the configured err rate during this testing, DM Multipath ignores it for the
configured gap time, and then retests it to see if it is working well enough to be reinstated.
For more information, see the multipath.conf man page.
12.2.10. New overrides section of the DM Multipath configuration file
The /etc/multipath.conf file now includes an overrides section that allows you to set a configuration
value for all of your devices. These attributes are used by DM Multipath for all devices unless they are
overwritten by the attributes specified in the multipaths section of the /etc/multipath.conf file for
CHAPTER 12. FILE SYSTEMS AND STORAGE
65

paths that contain the device. This functionality replaces the all_devs parameter of the devices section
of the configuration file, which is no longer supported.
12.2.11. NVMe/FC is fully supported on Broadcom Emulex and Marvell Qlogic Fibre
Channel adapters
The NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) transport type is now fully supported in Initiator mode when
used with Broadcom Emulex and Marvell Qlogic Fibre Channel 32Gbit adapters that feature NVMe
support.
NVMe over Fibre Channel is an additional fabric transport type for the Nonvolatile Memory Express
(NVMe) protocol, in addition to the Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) protocol that was
previously introduced in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Enabling NVMe/FC:
To enable NVMe/FC in the lpfc driver, edit the /etc/modprobe.d/lpfc.conf file and add the
following option:
lpfc_enable_fc4_type=3
To enable NVMe/FC in the qla2xxx driver, edit the /etc/modprobe.d/qla2xxx.conf file and add
the following option:
qla2xxx.ql2xnvmeenable=1
Additional restrictions:
Multipath is not supported with NVMe/FC.
NVMe clustering is not supported with NVMe/FC.
With Marvell Qlogic adapters, Red Hat Enterprise Linux does not support using NVMe/FC and
SCSI/FC on an initiator port at the same time.
kdump is not supported with NVMe/FC.
Booting from Storage Area Network (SAN) NVMe/FC is not supported.
12.2.12. Support for Data Integrity Field/Data Integrity Extension (DIF/DIX)
DIF/DIX is an addition to the SCSI Standard. It remains in Technology Preview for all HBAs and storage
arrays, except for those specifically listed as supported.
DIF/DIX increases the size of the commonly used 512 byte disk block from 512 to 520 bytes, adding the
Data Integrity Field (DIF). The DIF stores a checksum value for the data block that is calculated by the
Host Bus Adapter (HBA) when a write occurs. The storage device then confirms the checksum on
receipt, and stores both the data and the checksum. Conversely, when a read occurs, the checksum can
be verified by the storage device, and by the receiving HBA.
12.2.13. libstoragemgmt-netapp-plugin has been removed
The libstoragemgmt-netapp-plugin package used by the libStorageMgmt library has been removed. It
is no longer supported because:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
66

The package requires the NetApp 7-mode API, which is being phased out by NetApp.
RHEL 8 has removed default support for the TLSv1.0 protocol with the 
TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher, using this plug-in with TLS does not work.
12.3. LVM
12.3.1. Removal of clvmd for managing shared storage devices
LVM no longer uses clvmd (cluster lvm daemon) for managing shared storage devices. Instead, LVM
now uses lvmlockd (lvm lock daemon).
For details about using lvmlockd, see the lvmlockd(8) man page. For details about using
shared storage in general, see the lvmsystemid(7) man page.
For information on using LVM in a Pacemaker cluster, see the help screen for the LVM-activate
resource agent.
For an example of a procedure to configure a shared logical volume in a Red Hat High
Availability cluster, see Configuring a GFS2 file system in a cluster .
12.3.2. Removal of lvmetad daemon
LVM no longer uses the lvmetad daemon for caching metadata, and will always read metadata from
disk. LVM disk reading has been reduced, which reduces the benefits of caching.
Previously, autoactivation of logical volumes was indirectly tied to the use_lvmetad setting in the 
lvm.conf configuration file. The correct way to disable autoactivation continues to be setting 
auto_activation_volume_list in the lvm.conf file.
12.3.3. LVM can no longer manage devices formatted with the GFS pool volume
manager or the lvm1 metadata format.
LVM can no longer manage devices formatted with the GFS pool volume manager or the`lvm1`
metadata format. if you created your logical volume before Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 was introduced,
then this may affect you. Volume groups using the lvm1 format should be converted to the lvm2 format
using the vgconvert command.
12.3.4. LVM libraries and LVM Python bindings have been removed
The lvm2app library and LVM Python bindings, which were provided by the lvm2-python-libs package,
have been removed. Red Hat recommends the following solutions instead:
The LVM D-Bus API in combination with the lvm2-dbusd service. This requires using Python
version 3.
The LVM command-line utilities with JSON formatting; this formatting has been available since
the lvm2 package version 2.02.158.
The libblockdev library, included in AppStream, for C/C++
You must port any applications using the removed libraries and bindings to the D-Bus API before
upgrading to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
CHAPTER 12. FILE SYSTEMS AND STORAGE
67

12.3.5. The ability to mirror the log for LVM mirrors has been removed
The mirrored log feature of mirrored LVM volumes has been removed. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
8 no longer supports creating or activating LVM volumes with a mirrored mirror log.
The recommended replacements are:
RAID1 LVM volumes. The main advantage of RAID1 volumes is their ability to work even in
degraded mode and to recover after a transient failure.
Disk mirror log. To convert a mirrored mirror log to disk mirror log, use the following command: 
lvconvert --mirrorlog disk my_vg/my_lv.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
68

CHAPTER 13. HIGH AVAILABILITY AND CLUSTERS
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, pcs fully supports the Corosync 3 cluster engine and the Kronosnet
(knet) network abstraction layer for cluster communication. When planning an upgrade to a RHEL 8
cluster from an existing RHEL 7 cluster, some of the considerations you must take into account are as
follows:
Application versions: What version of the highly-available application will the RHEL 8 cluster
require?
Application process order: What may need to change in the start and stop processes of the
application?
Cluster infrastructure: Since pcs supports multiple network connections in RHEL 8, does the
number of NICs known to the cluster change?
Needed packages: Do you need to install all of the same packages on the new cluster?
Because of these and other considerations for running a Pacemaker cluster in RHEL 8, it is not possible
to perform in-place upgrades from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8 clusters and you must configure a new cluster in
RHEL 8. You cannot run a cluster that includes nodes running both RHEL 7 and RHEL 8.
Additionally, you should plan for the following before performing an upgrade:
Final cutover: What is the process to stop the application running on the old cluster and start it
on the new cluster to reduce application downtime?
Testing: Is it possible to test your migration strategy ahead of time in a development/test
environment?
The major differences in cluster creation and administration between RHEL 7 and RHEL 8 are listed in
the following sections.
13.1. NEW FORMATS FOR PCS CLUSTER SETUP, PCS CLUSTER NODE ADD AND PCS 
CLUSTER NODE REMOVE COMMANDS
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, pcs fully supports the use of node names, which are now required and
replace node addresses in the role of node identifier. Node addresses are now optional.
In the pcs host auth command, node addresses default to node names.
In the pcs cluster setup and pcs cluster node add commands, node addresses default to the
node addresses specified in the pcs host auth command.
With these changes, the formats for the commands to set up a cluster, add a node to a cluster, and
remove a node from a cluster have changed. For information on these new command formats, see the
help display for the pcs cluster setup, pcs cluster node add and pcs cluster node remove
commands.
13.2. MASTER RESOURCES RENAMED TO PROMOTABLE CLONE
RESOURCES
CHAPTER 13. HIGH AVAILABILITY AND CLUSTERS
69

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 supports Pacemaker 2.0, in which a master/slave resource is no
longer a separate type of resource but a standard clone resource with a promotable meta-attribute set
to true. The following changes have been implemented in support of this update:
It is no longer possible to create master resources with the pcs command. Instead, it is possible
to create promotable clone resources. Related keywords and commands have been changed
from master to promotable.
All existing master resources are displayed as promotable clone resources.
When managing a RHEL7 cluster in the Web UI, master resources are still called master, as
RHEL7 clusters do not support promotable clones.
13.3. NEW COMMANDS FOR AUTHENTICATING NODES IN A CLUSTER
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 incorporates the following changes to the commands used to
authenticate nodes in a cluster.
The new command for authentication is pcs host auth. This command allows users to specify
host names, addresses and pcsd ports.
The pcs cluster auth command authenticates only the nodes in a local cluster and does not
accept a node list
It is now possible to specify an address for each node. pcs/pcsd will then communicate with
each node using the specified address. These addresses can be different than the ones 
corosync uses internally.
The pcs pcsd clear-auth command has been replaced by the pcs pcsd deauth and pcs host 
deauth commands. The new commands allow users to deauthenticate a single host as well as all
hosts.
Previously, node authentication was bidirectional, and running the pcs cluster auth command
caused all specified nodes to be authenticated against each other. The pcs host auth
command, however, causes only the local host to be authenticated against the specified nodes.
This allows better control of what node is authenticated against what other nodes when running
this command. On cluster setup itself, and also when adding a node, pcs automatically
synchronizes tokens on the cluster, so all nodes in the cluster are still automatically
authenticated as before and the cluster nodes can communicate with each other.
Note that these changes are not backward compatible. Nodes that were authenticated on a RHEL 7
system will need to be authenticated again.
13.4. LVM VOLUMES IN A RED HAT HIGH AVAILABILITY
ACTIVE/PASSIVE CLUSTER
When configuring LVM volumes as resources in a Red Hat HA active/passive cluster in RHEL 8, you
configure the volumes as an LVM-activate resource. In RHEL 7, you configured the volumes as an LVM
resource. For an example of a cluster configuration procedure that includes configuring an LVM volume
as a resource in an active/passive cluster in RHEL 8, see Configuring an active/passive Apache HTTP
server in a Red Hat High Availability cluster.
13.5. SHARED LVM VOLUMES IN A RED HAT HIGH AVAILABILITY
ACTIVE/ACTIVE CLUSTER
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
70

In RHEL 8, LVM uses the LVM lock daemon lvmlockd instead of clvmd for managing shared storage
devices in an active/active cluster. This requires that you configure the logical volumes on which you
mount a GFS2 file system as shared logical volumes.
Additionally, this requires that you use the LVM-activate resource agent to manage an LVM volume and
that you use the lvmlockd resource agent to manage the lvmlockd daemon.
For a full procedure for configuring a RHEL 8 Pacemaker cluster that includes GFS2 file systems using
shared logical volumes, see Configuring a GFS2 file system in a cluster .
13.6. GFS2 FILE SYSTEMS IN A RHEL 8 PACEMAKER CLUSTER
In RHEL 8, LVM uses the LVM lock daemon lvmlockd instead of clvmd for managing shared storage
devices in an active/active cluster as described in Section 12.3.1, “Removal of clvmd for managing
shared storage devices”.
To use GFS2 file systems that were created on a RHEL 7 system in a RHEL 8 cluster, you must
configure the logical volumes on which they are mounted as shared logical volumes in a RHEL 8 system,
and you must start locking for the volume group. For an example of the procedure that configures
existing RHEL 7 logical volumes as shared logical volumes for use in a RHEL 8 Pacemaker cluster, see
Migrating a GFS2 file system from RHEL7 to RHEL8 .
CHAPTER 13. HIGH AVAILABILITY AND CLUSTERS
71

CHAPTER 14. SHELLS AND COMMAND-LINE TOOLS
14.1. LOCALIZATION IS DISTRIBUTED IN MULTIPLE PACKAGES
In RHEL 8, locales and translations are no longer provided by the single glibc-common package.
Instead, every locale and language is available in a glibc-langpack-CODE package. Additionally, not all
locales are installed by default, only these selected in the installer. Users must install all further locale
packages that they need separately.
The meta-packages which install extra add-on packages containing translations, dictionaries and locales
for every package installed on the system are called langpacks.
For more information see Installing and using langpacks .
14.2. REMOVED SUPPORT FOR ALL-NUMERIC USER AND GROUP
NAMES
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, the useradd and groupadd commands does not allow you to use
user and group names consisting purely of numeric characters. The reason for not allowing such names
is that this can confuse tools that work with user and group names and user and group ids, which are
numbers.
See more information about Managing users using command-line tools.
14.3. THE NOBODY USER REPLACES NFSNOBODY
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 used the nobody user and group pair with the ID of 99 and the 
nfsnobody user and group pair with the ID of 65534, which is also the default kernel overflow ID.
In RHEL 8, both of these pair have been merged into the nobody user and group pair, which uses the ID
of 65534. The nfsnobody pair is not created in RHEL 8.
This change reduces the confusion about files that are owned by nobody but are not related to NFS.
14.4. VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS
RHEL 8 provides the following version control systems:
Git 2.18, a distributed revision control system with a decentralized architecture.
Mercurial 4.8, a lightweight distributed version control system, designed for efficient handling
of large projects.
Subversion 1.10, a centralized version control system.
Note that the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) and Revision Control System (RCS), available in
RHEL 7, are not distributed with RHEL 8.
14.4.1. Notable changes in Subversion 1.10
Subversion 1.10 introduces a number of new features since the version 1.7 distributed in RHEL 7, as well
as the following compatibility changes:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
72

Due to incompatibilities in the Subversion libraries used for supporting language bindings, 
Python 3 bindings for Subversion 1.10 are unavailable. As a consequence, applications that
require Python bindings for Subversion are unsupported.
Repositories based on Berkeley DB are no longer supported. Before migrating, back up
repositories created with Subversion 1.7 by using the svnadmin dump command. After
installing RHEL 8, restore the repositories using the svnadmin load command.
Existing working copies checked out by the Subversion 1.7 client in RHEL 7 must be upgraded
to the new format before they can be used from Subversion 1.10. After installing RHEL 8, run
the svn upgrade command in each working copy.
Smartcard authentication for accessing repositories using https:// is no longer supported.

CHAPTER 15. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, WEB
SERVERS, DATABASE SERVERS
15.1. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
15.1.1. Notable changes in Python
15.1.1.1. Python 3 is the default Python implementation in RHEL 8
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is distributed with Python 3.6. The package might not be installed by default.
To install Python 3.6, use the yum install python3 command.
Python 2.7 is available in the python2 package. However, Python 2 will have a shorter life cycle and its
aim is to facilitate a smoother transition to Python 3 for customers.
Neither the default python package nor the unversioned /usr/bin/python executable is distributed with
RHEL 8. Customers are advised to use python3 or python2 directly. Alternatively, administrators can
configure the unversioned python command using the alternatives command.
For details, see Using Python in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 .
15.1.1.2. Migrating from Python 2 to Python 3
As a developer, you may want to migrate your former code that is written in Python 2 to Python 3. For
more information on how to migrate large code bases to Python 3, see The Conservative Python 3
Porting Guide.
Note that after this migration, the original Python 2 code becomes interpretable by the Python 3
interpreter and stays interpretable for the Python 2 interpreter as well.
15.1.1.3. Configuring the unversioned Python
System administrators can configure the unversioned python command on the system using the 
alternatives command. Note that the required package, either python3 or python2, needs to be
installed before configuring the unversioned command to the respective version.
To configure the unversioned python command to Python 3 directly, run:
alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3
Use an analogous command if you choose Python 2.
Alternatively, you can configure the unversioned python command interactively:
1. Run the following command:
alternatives --config python
2. Select the required version from the provided list.
To reset this configuration and remove the unversioned python command, run:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
74

alternatives --auto python
WARNING
Additional Python-related commands, such as pip3, do not have configurable
unversioned variants.
15.1.1.4. Python scripts must specify major version in hashbangs at RPM build time
In RHEL 8, executable Python scripts are expected to use hashbangs (shebangs) specifying explicitly at
least the major Python version.
The /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/brp-mangle-shebangs buildroot policy (BRP) script is run automatically when
building any RPM package. This script attempts to correct hashbangs in all executable files. When the
script encounters ambiguous Python hashbangs that do not specify the major version of Python, it
generates errors and the RPM build fails. Examples of such ambiguous hashbangs include:
#! /usr/bin/python
#! /usr/bin/env python
To modify hashbangs in the Python scripts causing these build errors at RPM build time, use the 
pathfix.py script from the platform-python-devel package:
pathfix.py -pn -i %{__python3} PATH ...
Multiple PATHs can be specified. If a PATH is a directory, pathfix.py recursively scans for any Python
scripts matching the pattern ^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\.py$, not only those with an ambiguous hashbang. Add the
command for running pathfix.py to the %prep section or at the end of the %install section.
For more information, see Handling hashbangs in Python scripts.
15.1.1.5. Python binding of the net-snmp package is unavailable
The Net-SNMP suite of tools does not provide binding for Python 3, which is the default Python
implementation in RHEL 8. Consequently, python-net-snmp, python2-net-snmp, or python3-net-snmp
packages are unavailable in RHEL 8.
15.1.1.6. Additional resources
Packaging of Python 3 RPMs
15.1.2. Notable changes in PHP
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is distributed with PHP 7.2. This version introduces the following major
changes over PHP 5.4, which is available in RHEL 7:
PHP uses FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) by default (safe for use with a threaded httpd)

CHAPTER 15. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, WEB SERVERS, DATABASE SERVERS
75

The php_value and php-flag variables should no longer be used in the httpd configuration files;
they should be set in pool configuration instead: /etc/php-fpm.d/*.conf
PHP script errors and warnings are logged to the /var/log/php-fpm/www-error.log file instead
of /var/log/httpd/error.log
When changing the PHP max_execution_time configuration variable, the httpd ProxyTimeout
setting should be increased to match
The user running PHP scripts is now configured in the FPM pool configuration (the /etc/php-
fpm.d/www.conf file; the apache user is the default)
The php-fpm service needs to be restarted after a configuration change or after a new
extension is installed
The zip extension has been moved from the php-common package to a separate package, 
php-pecl-zip
The following extensions have been removed:
aspell
mysql (note that the mysqli and pdo_mysql extensions are still available, provided by php-
mysqlnd package)
memcache
15.1.3. Notable changes in Perl
Perl 5.26, distributed with RHEL 8, introduces the following changes over the version available in RHEL
7:
Unicode 9.0 is now supported.
New op-entry, loading-file, and loaded-file SystemTap probes are provided.
Copy-on-write mechanism is used when assigning scalars for improved performance.
The IO::Socket::IP module for handling IPv4 and IPv6 sockets transparently has been added.
The Config::Perl::V module to access perl -V data in a structured way has been added.
A new perl-App-cpanminus package has been added, which contains the cpanm utility for
getting, extracting, building, and installing modules from the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN) repository.
The current directory . has been removed from the @INC module search path for security
reasons.
The do statement now returns a deprecation warning when it fails to load a file because of the
behavioral change described above.
The do subroutine(LIST) call is no longer supported and results in a syntax error.
Hashes are randomized by default now. The order in which keys and values are returned from a
hash changes on each perl run. To disable the randomization, set the PERL_PERTURB_KEYS
environment variable to 0.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
76

Unescaped literal { characters in regular expression patterns are no longer permissible.
Lexical scope support for the $_ variable has been removed.
Using the defined operator on an array or a hash results in a fatal error.
Importing functions from the UNIVERSAL module results in a fatal error.
The find2perl, s2p, a2p, c2ph, and pstruct tools have been removed.
The ${^ENCODING} facility has been removed. The encoding pragma’s default mode is no
longer supported. To write source code in other encoding than UTF-8, use the encoding’s Filter
option.
The perl packaging is now aligned with upstream. The perl package installs also core modules,
while the /usr/bin/perl interpreter is provided by the perl-interpreter package. In previous
releases, the perl package included just a minimal interpreter, whereas the perl-core package
included both the interpreter and the core modules.
The IO::Socket::SSL Perl module no longer loads a certificate authority certificate from the 
./certs/my-ca.pem file or the ./ca directory, a server private key from the ./certs/server-
key.pem file, a server certificate from the ./certs/server-cert.pem file, a client private key from
the ./certs/client-key.pem file, and a client certificate from the ./certs/client-cert.pem file.
Specify the paths to the files explicitly instead.
15.1.4. Notable changes in Ruby
RHEL 8 provides Ruby 2.5, which introduces numerous new features and enhancements over Ruby 
2.0.0 available in RHEL 7. Notable changes include:
Incremental garbage collector has been added.
The Refinements syntax has been added.
Symbols are now garbage collected.
The $SAFE=2 and $SAFE=3 safe levels are now obsolete.
The Fixnum and Bignum classes have been unified into the Integer class.
Performance has been improved by optimizing the Hash class, improved access to instance
variables, and the Mutex class being smaller and faster.
Certain old APIs have been deprecated.
Bundled libraries, such as RubyGems, Rake, RDoc, Psych, Minitest, and test-unit, have been
updated.
Other libraries, such as mathn, DL, ext/tk, and XMLRPC, which were previously distributed with 
Ruby, are deprecated or no longer included.
The SemVer versioning scheme is now used for Ruby versioning.
15.1.5. Notable changes in SWIG
RHEL 8 includes the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) version 3.0, which provides
CHAPTER 15. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, WEB SERVERS, DATABASE SERVERS
77

numerous new features, enhancements, and bug fixes over the version 2.0 distributed in RHEL 7. Most
notably, support for the C++11 standard has been implemented. SWIG now supports also Go 1.6, PHP 7, 
Octave 4.2, and Python 3.5.
15.1.6. Node.js new in RHEL
Node.js, a software development platform for building fast and scalable network applications in the
JavaScript programming language, is provided for the first time in RHEL. It was previously available only
as a Software Collection. RHEL 8 provides Node.js 10.
15.1.7. Tcl
Tool command language (Tcl) is a dynamic programming language. The interpreter for this language,
together with the C library, is provided by the tcl package.
Using Tcl paired with Tk (Tcl/Tk) enables creating cross-platform GUI applications. Tk is provided by
the tk package.
Note that Tk can refer to any of the the following:
A programming toolkit for multiple languages
A Tk C library bindings available for multiple languages, such as C, Ruby, Perl and Python
A wish interpreter that instantiates a Tk console
A Tk extension that adds a number of new commands to a particular Tcl interpreter
15.1.7.1. Notable changes in Tcl/Tk 8.6
RHEL 8 is distributed with Tcl/Tk version 8.6, which provides multiple notable changes over Tcl/Tk
version 8.5:
Object-oriented programming support
Stackless evaluation implementation
Enhanced exceptions handling
Collection of third-party packages built and installed with Tcl
Multi-thread operations enabled
SQL database-powered scripts support
IPv6 networking support
Built-in Zlib compression
List processing
Two new commands, lmap and dict map are available, which allow the expression of
transformations over Tcl containers.
Stacked channels by script
Two new commands, chan push and chan pop are available, which allow to add or remove
transformations to or from I/O channels.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8

Changes in Tcl/Tk 8.6
If you need to migrate to Tcl/Tk 8.6, see Migrating to Tcl/Tk 8.6 .
15.2. WEB SERVERS
15.2.1. Notable changes in the Apache HTTP Server
The Apache HTTP Server, has been updated from version 2.4.6 to version 2.4.37 between RHEL 7 and
RHEL 8. This updated version includes several new features, but maintains backwards compatibility with
the RHEL 7 version at the level of configuration and Application Binary Interface (ABI) of external
modules.
New features include:
HTTP/2 support is now provided by the mod_http2 package, which is a part of the httpd
module.
systemd socket activation is supported. See httpd.socket(8) man page for more details.
Multiple new modules have been added:
mod_proxy_hcheck - a proxy health-check module
mod_proxy_uwsgi - a Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) proxy
mod_proxy_fdpass - provides support for the passing the socket of the client to another
process
mod_cache_socache - an HTTP cache using, for example, memcache backend
mod_md - an ACME protocol SSL/TLS certificate service
The following modules now load by default:
mod_request
mod_macro
mod_watchdog
A new subpackage, httpd-filesystem, has been added, which contains the basic directory layout
for the Apache HTTP Server including the correct permissions for the directories.
Instantiated service support, httpd@.service has been introduced. See the httpd.service man
page for more information.
A new httpd-init.service replaces the %post script to create a self-signed mod_ssl key pair.
Automated TLS certificate provisioning and renewal using the Automatic Certificate
Management Environment (ACME) protocol is now supported with the mod_md package (for
use with certificate providers such as Let’s Encrypt).
CHAPTER 15. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, WEB SERVERS, DATABASE SERVERS
79

The Apache HTTP Server now supports loading TLS certificates and private keys from
hardware security tokens directly from PKCS#11 modules. As a result, a mod_ssl configuration
can now use PKCS#11 URLs to identify the TLS private key, and, optionally, the TLS certificate
in the SSLCertificateKeyFile and SSLCertificateFile directives.
A new ListenFree directive in the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file is now supported.
Similarly to the Listen directive, ListenFree provides information about IP addresses, ports, or
IP address-and-port combinations that the server listens to. However, with ListenFree, the 
IP_FREEBIND socket option is enabled by default. Hence, httpd is allowed to bind to a nonlocal
IP address or to an IP address that does not exist yet. This allows httpd to listen on a socket
without requiring the underlying network interface or the specified dynamic IP address to be up
at the time when httpd is trying to bind to it.
Note that the ListenFree directive is currently available only in RHEL 8.
For more details on ListenFree, see the following table:
Table 15.1. ListenFree directive’s syntax, status, and modules
Syntax
Status
Modules

MPM
event, worker, prefork,
mpm_winnt, mpm_netware,
mpmt_os2
Other notable changes include:
The following modules have been removed:
mod_file_cache
mod_nss
mod_perl
The default type of the DBM authentication database used by the Apache HTTP Server in
RHEL 8 has been changed from SDBM to db5.
The mod_wsgi module for the Apache HTTP Server has been updated to Python 3. WSGI
applications are now supported only with Python 3, and must be migrated from Python 2.
The multi-processing module (MPM) configured by default with the Apache HTTP Server has
changed from a multi-process, forked model (known as prefork) to a high-performance multi-
threaded model, event.
Any third-party modules that are not thread-safe need to be replaced or removed. To change
the configured MPM, edit the /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-mpm.conf file. See the 
httpd.service(8) man page for more information.
The minimum UID and GID allowed for users by suEXEC are now 1000 and 500, respectively
(previously 100 and 100).
The /etc/sysconfig/httpd file is no longer a supported interface for setting environment
variables for the httpd service. The httpd.service(8) man page has been added for the systemd
service.
Stopping the httpd service now uses a “graceful stop” by default.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
80

The mod_auth_kerb module has been replaced by the mod_auth_gssapi module.
For instructions on deploying, see Setting up the Apache HTTP web server.
15.2.2. The nginx web server new in RHEL
RHEL 8 introduces nginx 1.14, a web and proxy server supporting HTTP and other protocols, with a
focus on high concurrency, performance, and low memory usage. nginx was previously available only as
a Software Collection.
The nginx web server now supports loading TLS private keys from hardware security tokens directly
from PKCS#11 modules. As a result, an nginx configuration can use PKCS#11 URLs to identify the TLS
private key in the ssl_certificate_key directive.
15.2.3. Apache Tomcat has been removed
The Apache Tomcat server has been removed from Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Apache Tomcat is a
servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies. Red Hat recommends
that users requiring a servlet container use the JBoss Web Server.
15.3. PROXY CACHING SERVERS
15.3.1. Varnish Cache new in RHEL
Varnish Cache, a high-performance HTTP reverse proxy, is provided for the first time in RHEL. It was
previously available only as a Software Collection. Varnish Cache stores files or fragments of files in
memory that are used to reduce the response time and network bandwidth consumption on future
equivalent requests. RHEL 8.0 is distributed with Varnish Cache 6.0.
15.3.2. Notable changes in Squid
RHEL 8.0 is distributed with Squid 4.4, a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects. This release provides numerous new features,
enhancements, and bug fixes over the version 3.5 available in RHEL 7.
Notable changes include:
Configurable helper queue size
Changes to helper concurrency channels
Changes to the helper binary
Secure Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP)
Improved support for Symmetric Multi Processing (SMP)
Improved process management
Removed support for SSL
Removed Edge Side Includes (ESI) custom parser
Multiple configuration changes
CHAPTER 15. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, WEB SERVERS, DATABASE SERVERS
81

15.4. DATABASE SERVERS
RHEL 8 provides the following database servers:
MySQL 8.0, a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server
daemon, mysqld, and many client programs.
MariaDB 10.3, a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. For all practical purposes, 
MariaDB is binary-compatible with MySQL.
PostgreSQL 10 and PostgreSQL 9.6, an advanced object-relational database management
system (DBMS).
Redis 5, an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server because
keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Redis is provided for the first time
in RHEL.
Note that the NoSQL MongoDB database server is not included in RHEL 8.0 because it uses the Server
Side Public License (SSPL).
Database servers are not installable in parallel
The mariadb and mysql modules cannot be installed in parallel in RHEL 8.0 due to conflicting RPM
packages.
By design, it is impossible to install more than one version (stream) of the same module in parallel. For
example, you need to choose only one of the available streams from the postgresql module, either 10
(default) or 9.6. Parallel installation of components is possible in Red Hat Software Collections for RHEL
6 and RHEL 7. In RHEL 8, different versions of database servers can be used in containers.
15.4.1. Notable changes in MariaDB 10.3
MariaDB 10.3 provides numerous new features over the version 5.5 distributed in RHEL 7, such as:
Common table expressions
System-versioned tables
FOR loops
Invisible columns
Sequences
Instant ADD COLUMN for InnoDB
Storage-engine independent column compression
Parallel replication
Multi-source replication
In addition, the new mariadb-connector-c packages provide a common client library for MySQL and 
MariaDB. This library is usable with any version of the MySQL and MariaDB database servers. As a
result, the user is able to connect one build of an application to any of the MySQL and MariaDB servers
distributed with RHEL 8.
Other notable changes include:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
82

MariaDB Galera Cluster, a synchronous multi-master cluster, is now a standard part of 
MariaDB.
InnoDB is used as the default storage engine instead of XtraDB.
The mariadb-bench subpackage has been removed.
The default allowed level of the plug-in maturity has been changed to one level less than the
server maturity. As a result, plug-ins with a lower maturity level that were previously working, will
no longer load.
See also Using MariaDB on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 .
15.4.2. Notable changes in MySQL 8.0
RHEL 8 is distributed with MySQL 8.0, which provides, for example, the following enhancements:
MySQL now incorporates a transactional data dictionary, which stores information about
database objects.
MySQL now supports roles, which are collections of privileges.
The default character set has been changed from latin1 to utf8mb4.
Support for common table expressions, both nonrecursive and recursive, has been added.
MySQL now supports window functions, which perform a calculation for each row from a query,
using related rows.
InnoDB now supports the NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED options with locking read statements.
GIS-related functions have been improved.
JSON functionality has been enhanced.
The new mariadb-connector-c packages provide a common client library for MySQL and 
MariaDB. This library is usable with any version of the MySQL and MariaDB database servers.
As a result, the user is able to connect one build of an application to any of the MySQL and 
MariaDB servers distributed with RHEL 8.
In addition, the MySQL 8.0 server distributed with RHEL 8 is configured to use 
mysql_native_password as the default authentication plug-in because client tools and libraries in
RHEL 8 are incompatible with the caching_sha2_password method, which is used by default in the
upstream MySQL 8.0 version.
To change the default authentication plug-in to caching_sha2_password, edit the 
/etc/my.cnf.d/mysql-default-authentication-plugin.cnf file as follows:
[mysqld]
default_authentication_plugin=caching_sha2_password
15.4.3. Notable changes in PostgreSQL
RHEL 8.0 provides two versions of the PostgreSQL database server, distributed in two streams of the 
postgresql module: PostgreSQL 10 (the default stream) and PostgreSQL 9.6. RHEL 7 includes 
PostgreSQL version 9.2.
CHAPTER 15. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, WEB SERVERS, DATABASE SERVERS
83

Notable changes in PostgreSQL 9.6 are, for example:
Parallel execution of the sequential operations: scan, join, and aggregate
Enhancements to synchronous replication
Improved full-text search enabling users to search for phrases
The postgres_fdw data federation driver now supports remote join, sort, UPDATE, and 
DELETE operations
Substantial performance improvements, especially regarding scalability on multi-CPU-socket
servers
Major enhancements in PostgreSQL 10 include:
Logical replication using the publish and subscribe keywords
Stronger password authentication based on the SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanism
Declarative table partitioning
Improved query parallelism
Significant general performance improvements
Improved monitoring and control

CHAPTER 16. COMPILERS AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
16.1. CHANGES IN TOOLCHAIN SINCE RHEL 7
The following sections list changes in toolchain since the release of the described components in
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. See also Release notes for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0 .
16.1.1. Changes in GCC in RHEL 8
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the GCC toolchain is based on the GCC 8.2 release series. Notable
changes since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 include:
Numerous general optimizations have been added, such as alias analysis, vectorizer
improvements, identical code folding, inter-procedural analysis, store merging optimization
pass, and others.
The Address Sanitizer has been improved.
The Leak Sanitizer for detection of memory leaks has been added.
The Undefined Behavior Sanitizer for detection of undefined behavior has been added.
Debug information can now be produced in the DWARF5 format. This capability is experimental.
The source code coverage analysis tool GCOV has been extended with various improvements.
Support for the OpenMP 4.5 specification has been added. Additionally, the offloading features
of the OpenMP 4.0 specification are now supported by the C, C++, and Fortran compilers.
New warnings and improved diagnostics have been added for static detection of certain likely
programming errors.
Source locations are now tracked as ranges rather than points, which allows much richer
diagnostics. The compiler now offers “fix-it” hints, suggesting possible code modifications. A
spell checker has been added to offer alternative names and ease detecting typos.
Security
GCC has been extended to provide tools to ensure additional hardening of the generated code.
Improvements related to security include:
The __builtin_add_overflow, __builtin_sub_overflow, and __builtin_mul_overflow built-in
functions for arithmetics with overflow checking have been added.
The -fstack-clash-protection option has been added to generate additional code guarding
against stack clash.
The -fcf-protection option was introduced to check target addresses of control-flow
instructions for increased program security.
The new -Wstringop-truncation warning option lists calls to bounded string manipulation
functions such as strncat, strncpy, or stpncpy that might truncate the copied string or leave
the destination unchanged.
The -Warray-bounds warning option has been improved to detect out-of-bounds array indices
and pointer offsets better.
CHAPTER 16. COMPILERS AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
85

The -Wclass-memaccess warning option has been added to warn about potentially unsafe
manipulation of objects of non-trivial class types by raw memory access functions such as 
memcpy or realloc.
Architecture and processor support
Improvements to architecture and processor support include:
Multiple new architecture-specific options for the Intel AVX-512 architecture, a number of its
microarchitectures, and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) have been added.
Code generation can now target the 64-bit ARM architecture LSE extensions, ARMv8.2-A 16-
bit Floating-Point Extensions (FPE), and ARMv8.2-A, ARMv8.3-A, and ARMv8.4-A architecture
versions.
Handling of the -march=native option on the ARM and 64-bit ARM architectures has been
fixed.
Support for the z13 and z14 processors of the IBM Z architecture has been added.
Languages and standards
Notable changes related to languages and standards include:
The default standard used when compiling code in the C language has changed to C17 with
GNU extensions.
The default standard used when compiling code in the C++ language has changed to C++14 with
GNU extensions.
The C++ runtime library now supports the C++11 and C++14 standards.
The C++ compiler now implements the C++14 standard with many new features such as variable
templates, aggregates with non-static data member initializers, the extended constexpr
specifier, sized deallocation functions, generic lambdas, variable-length arrays, digit separators,
and others.
Support for the C language standard C11 has been improved: ISO C11 atomics, generic
selections, and thread-local storage are now available.
The new __auto_type GNU C extension provides a subset of the functionality of C++11 auto
keyword in the C language.
The _FloatN and _FloatNx type names specified by the ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015 standard are
now recognized by the C front end.
The default standard used when compiling code in the C language has changed to C17 with
GNU extensions. This has the same effect as using the --std=gnu17 option. Previously, the
default was C89 with GNU extensions.
GCC can now experimentally compile code using the C++17 language standard and certain
features from the C++20 standard.
Passing an empty class as an argument now takes up no space on the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures, as required by the platform ABI. Passing or returning a class with only deleted
copy and move constructors now uses the same calling convention as a class with a non-trivial
copy or move constructor.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
86

The value returned by the C++11 alignof operator has been corrected to match the C _Alignof
operator and return minimum alignment. To find the preferred alignment, use the GNU
extension __alignof__.
The main version of the libgfortran library for Fortran language code has been changed to 5.
Support for the Ada (GNAT), GCC Go, and Objective C/C++ languages has been removed. Use
the Go Toolset for Go code development.

16.1.2. Security enhancements in GCC in RHEL 8
This section decribes in detail the changes in GCC related to security and added since the release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0.
New warnings
These warning options have been added:
Option
Displays warnings for
-Wstringop-truncation
Calls to bounded string manipulation functions such as strncat, strncpy,
and stpncpy that might either truncate the copied string or leave the
destination unchanged.
-Wclass-memaccess
Objects of non-trivial class types manipulated in potentially unsafe ways by
raw memory functions such as memcpy or realloc.
The warning helps detect calls that bypass user-defined constructors or
copy-assignment operators, corrupt virtual table pointers, data members of
const-qualified types or references, or member pointers. The warning also
detects calls that would bypass access controls to data members.
-Wmisleading-
indentation
Places where the indentation of the code gives a misleading idea of the block
structure of the code to a human reader.
-Walloc-size-larger-
than=size
Calls to memory allocation functions where the amount of memory to
allocate exceeds size. Works also with functions where the allocation is

Option
Displays warnings for
Warning improvements
These GCC warnings have been improved:
The -Warray-bounds option has been improved to detect more instances of out-of-bounds
array indices and pointer offsets. For example, negative or excessive indices into flexible array
members and string literals are detected.
The -Wrestrict option introduced in GCC 7 has been enhanced to detect many more instances
of overlapping accesses to objects via restrict-qualified arguments to standard memory and
string manipulation functions such as memcpy and strcpy.
The -Wnonnull option has been enhanced to detect a broader set of cases of passing null
pointers to functions that expect a non-null argument (decorated with attribute nonnull).
New UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
A new run-time sanitizer for detecting undefined behavior called UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer has been
added. The following options are noteworthy:
Option
Check
-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero
Detect floating-point division by zero.
-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow
Check that the result of floating-point type to integer conversions
do not overflow.

16.1.3. Compatibility-breaking changes in GCC in RHEL 8
C++ ABI change in std::string and std::list
The Application Binary Interface (ABI) of the std::string and std::list classes from the libstdc++ library
changed between RHEL 7 (GCC 4.8) and RHEL 8 (GCC 8) to conform to the C++11 standard. The 
libstdc++ library supports both the old and new ABI, but some other C++ system libraries do not. As a
consequence, applications that dynamically link against these libraries will need to be rebuilt. This affects
all C++ standard modes, including C++98. It also affects applications built with Red Hat Developer
Toolset compilers for RHEL 7, which kept the old ABI to maintain compatibility with the system libraries.
GCC no longer builds Ada, Go, and Objective C/C++ code
Capability for building code in the Ada (GNAT), GCC Go, and Objective C/C++ languages has been
removed from the GCC compiler.
To build Go code, use the Go Toolset instead.
16.2. COMPILER TOOLSETS
RHEL 8.0 provides the following compiler toolsets as Application Streams:
Clang and LLVM Toolset 7.0.1, which provides the LLVM compiler infrastructure framework, the
Clang compiler for the C and C++ languages, the LLDB debugger, and related tools for code
analysis. See the Using Clang and LLVM Toolset  document.
Rust Toolset 1.31, which provides the Rust programming language compiler rustc, the cargo
build tool and dependency manager, the cargo-vendor plugin, and required libraries. See the
Using Rust Toolset document.
Go Toolset 1.11.5, which provides the Go programming language tools and libraries. Go is
alternatively known as golang. See the Using Go Toolset document.
16.3. JAVA IMPLEMENTATIONS AND JAVA TOOLS IN RHEL 8
The RHEL 8 AppStream repository includes:
The java-11-openjdk packages, which provide the OpenJDK 11 Java Runtime Environment and
the OpenJDK 11 Java Software Development Kit.
The java-1.8.0-openjdk packages, which provide the OpenJDK 8 Java Runtime Environment
and the OpenJDK 8 Java Software Development Kit.
The icedtea-web packages, which provide an implementation of Java Web Start.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
90

The ant module, providing a Java library and command-line tool for compiling, assembling,
testing, and running Java applications. Ant has been updated to version 1.10.
The maven module, providing a software project management and comprehension tool. Maven
was previously available only as a Software Collection or in the unsupported Optional channel.
The scala module, providing a general purpose programming language for the Java platform. 
Scala was previously available only as a Software Collection.
In addition, the java-1.8.0-ibm packages are distributed through the Supplementary repository. Note
that packages in this repository are unsupported by Red Hat.
16.4. COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES IN GDB
The version of GDB provided in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 contains a number of changes that break
compatibility, especially for cases where the GDB output is read directly from the terminal. The
following sections provide more details about these changes.
Parsing output of GDB is not recommended. Prefer scripts using the Python GDB API or the GDB
Machine Interface (MI).
GDBserver now starts inferiors with shell
To enable expansion and variable substitution in inferior command line arguments, GDBserver now
starts the inferior in a shell, same as GDB.
To disable using the shell:
When using the target extended-remote GDB command, disable shell with the set startup-
with-shell off command.
When using the target remote GDB command, disable shell with the --no-startup-with-shell
option of GDBserver.
Example 16.1. Example of shell expansion in remote GDB inferiors
This example shows how running the /bin/echo /* command through GDBserver differs on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux versions 7 and 8:
On RHEL 7:
$ gdbserver --multi :1234
$ gdb -batch -ex 'target extended-remote :1234' -ex 'set remote exec-file /bin/echo' -ex 
'file /bin/echo' -ex 'run /*'
/*
On RHEL 8:
$ gdbserver --multi :1234
$ gdb -batch -ex 'target extended-remote :1234' -ex 'set remote exec-file /bin/echo' -ex 
'file /bin/echo' -ex 'run /*'
/bin /boot (...) /tmp /usr /var
gcj support removed
CHAPTER 16. COMPILERS AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
91

Support for debugging Java programs compiled with the GNU Compiler for Java (gcj) has been
removed.
New syntax for symbol dumping maintenance commands
The symbol dumping maintenance commands syntax now includes options before file names. As a
result, commands that worked with GDB in RHEL 7 do not work in RHEL 8.
As an example, the following command no longer stores symbols in a file, but produces an error message:
(gdb) maintenance print symbols /tmp/out main.c
The new syntax for the symbol dumping maintenance commands is:
maint print symbols [-pc address] [--] [filename]
maint print symbols [-objfile objfile] [-source source] [--] [filename]
maint print psymbols [-objfile objfile] [-pc address] [--] [filename]
maint print psymbols [-objfile objfile] [-source source] [--] [filename]
maint print msymbols [-objfile objfile] [--] [filename]
Thread numbers are no longer global
Previously, GDB used only global thread numbering. The numbering has been extended to be displayed
per inferior in the form inferior_num.thread_num, such as 2.1. As a consequence, thread numbers in the
$_thread convenience variable and in the InferiorThread.num Python attribute are no longer unique
between inferiors.
GDB now stores a second thread ID per thread, called the global thread ID, which is the new equivalent
of thread numbers in previous releases. To access the global thread number, use the $_gthread
convenience variable and InferiorThread.global_num Python attribute.
For backwards compatibility, the Machine Interface (MI) thread IDs always contains the global IDs.
Example 16.2. Example of GDB thread number changes
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7:
# debuginfo-install coreutils
$ gdb -batch -ex 'file echo' -ex start -ex 'add-inferior' -ex 'inferior 2' -ex 'file echo' -ex start -ex 'info 
threads' -ex 'pring $_thread' -ex 'inferior 1' -ex 'pring $_thread'
(...)

$1 = 2
(...)
$2 = 1
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8:
# dnf debuginfo-install coreutils
$ gdb -batch -ex 'file echo' -ex start -ex 'add-inferior' -ex 'inferior 2' -ex 'file echo' -ex start -ex 'info 
threads' -ex 'pring $_thread' -ex 'inferior 1' -ex 'pring $_thread'

$1 = 1
(...)
$2 = 1
Memory for value contents can be limited
Previously, GDB did not limit the amount of memory allocated for value contents. As a consequence,
debugging incorrect programs could cause GDB to allocate too much memory. The max-value-size
setting has been added to enable limiting the amount of allocated memory. The default value of this
limit is 64 KiB. As a result, GDB in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 will not display too large values, but report
that the value is too large instead.
As an example, printing a value defined as char s[128*1024]; produces different results:
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, $1 = 'A' <repeats 131072 times>
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, value requires 131072 bytes, which is more than max-value-
size
Sun version of stabs format no longer supported
Support for the Sun version of the stabs debug file format has been removed. The stabs format
produced by GCC in RHEL with the gcc -gstabs option is still supported by GDB.
Sysroot handling changes
The set sysroot path command specifies system root when searching for files needed for debugging.
Directory names supplied to this command may now be prefixed with the string target: to make GDB
read the shared libraries from the target system (both local and remote). The formerly available remote:
prefix is now treated as target:. Additionally, the default system root value has changed from an empty
string to target: for backward compatibility.
The specified system root is prepended to the file name of the main executable, when GDB starts
processes remotely, or when it attaches to already running processes (both local and remote). This
means that for remote processes, the default value target: makes GDB always try to load the
debugging information from the remote system. To prevent this, run the set sysroot command before
the target remote command so that local symbol files are found before the remote ones.
HISTSIZE no longer controls GDB command history size
Previously, GDB used the HISTSIZE environment variable to determine how long command history
should be kept. GDB has been changed to use the GDBHISTSIZE environment variable instead. This
variable is specific only to GDB. The possible values and their effects are:
a positive number - use command history of this size,
-1 or an empty string - keep history of all commands,
non-numeric values - ignored.
Completion limiting added
The maximum number of candidates considered during completion can now be limited using the set 
max-completions command. To show the current limit, run the show max-completions command.
The default value is 200. This limit prevents GDB from generating excessively large completion lists and
becoming unresponsive.
As an example, the output after the input p <tab><tab> is:
on RHEL 7: Display all 29863 possibilities? (y or n)
CHAPTER 16. COMPILERS AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
93

on RHEL 8: Display all 200 possibilities? (y or n)
HP-UX XDB compatibility mode removed
The -xdb option for the HP-UX XDB compatibility mode has been removed from GDB.
Handling signals for threads
Previously, GDB could deliver a signal to the current thread instead of the thread for which the signal
was actually sent. This bug has been fixed, and GDB now always passes the signal to the correct thread
when resuming execution.
Additionally, the signal command now always correctly delivers the requested signal to the current
thread. If the program is stopped for a signal and the user switched threads, GDB asks for confirmation.
Breakpoint modes always-inserted off and auto merged
The breakpoint always-inserted setting has been changed. The auto value and corresponding
behavior has been removed. The default value is now off. Additionally, the off value now causes GDB to
not remove breakpoints from the target until all threads stop.
remotebaud commands no longer supported
The set remotebaud and show remotebaud commands are no longer supported. Use the set serial 
baud and show serial baud commands instead.
16.5. COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES IN COMPILERS AND
DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
librtkaio removed
With this update, the librtkaio library has been removed. This library provided high-performance real-
time asynchronous I/O access for some files, which was based on Linux kernel Asynchronous I/O
support (KAIO).
As a result of the removal:
Applications using the LD_PRELOAD method to load librtkaio display a warning about a
missing library, load the librt library instead and run correctly.
Applications using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH method to load librtkaio load the librt library
instead and run correctly, without any warning.
Applications using the dlopen() system call to access librtkaio directly load the librt library
instead.
Users of librtkaio have the following options:
Use the fallback mechanism described above, without any changes to their applications.
Change code of their applications to use the librt library, which offers a compatible POSIX-
compliant API.
Change code of their applications to use the libaio library, which offers a compatible API.
Both librt and libaio can provide comparable features and performance under specific conditions.
Note that the libaio package has Red Hat compatibility level of 2, while librtk and the removed librtkaio
level 1.
For more details, see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/GLIBC223_librtkaio_removal
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8

Sun RPC and NIS interfaces removed from glibc
The glibc library no longer provides Sun RPC and NIS interfaces for new applications. These interfaces
are now available only for running legacy applications. Developers must change their applications to use
the libtirpc library instead of Sun RPC and libnsl2 instead of NIS. Applications can benefit from IPv6
support in the replacement libraries.
The nosegneg libraries for 32-bit Xen have been removed
Previously, the glibc i686 packages contained an alternative glibc build, which avoided the use of the
thread descriptor segment register with negative offsets (nosegneg). This alternative build was only
used in the 32-bit version of the Xen Project hypervisor without hardware virtualization support, as an
optimization to reduce the cost of full paravirtualization. These alternative builds are no longer used and
they have been removed.
make new operator != causes a different interpretation of certain existing makefile syntax
The != shell assignment operator has been added to GNU make as an alternative to the $(shell …​)
function to increase compatibility with BSD makefiles. As a consequence, variables with name ending in
exclamation mark and immediately followed by assignment such as variable!=value are now interpreted
as the shell assignment. To restore the previous behavior, add a space after the exclamation mark, such
as variable! =value.
For more details and differences between the operator and the function, see the GNU make manual.
Valgrind library for MPI debugging support removed
The libmpiwrap.so wrapper library for Valgrind provided by the valgrind-openmpi package has been
removed. This library enabled Valgrind to debug programs using the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
This library was specific to the Open MPI implementation version in previous versions of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux.
Users of libmpiwrap.so are encouraged to build their own version from upstream sources specific to
their MPI implementation and version. Supply these custom-built libraries to Valgrind using the 
LD_PRELOAD technique.
Development headers and static libraries removed from valgrind-devel
Previously, the valgrind-devel sub-package used to include development files for developing custom
valgrind tools. This update removes these files because they do not have a guaranteed API, have to be
linked statically, and are unsupported. The valgrind-devel package still does contain the development
files for valgrind-aware programs and header files such as valgrind.h, callgrind.h, drd.h, helgrind.h,
and memcheck.h, which are stable and well-supported.

CHAPTER 17. IDENTITY MANAGEMENT
17.1. IDENTITY MANAGEMENT PACKAGES ARE INSTALLED AS A
MODULE
In RHEL 8, the packages necessary for installing an Identity Management (IdM) server and client are
distributed as a module. The client stream is the default stream of the idm module, and you can
download the packages necessary for installing the client without enabling the stream.
The IdM server module stream is called DL1 and contains multiple profiles that correspond to the
different types of IdM servers:
server: an IdM server without integrated DNS
dns: an IdM server with integrated DNS
adtrust: an IdM server that has a trust agreement with Active Directory
client: an IdM client
To download the packages in a specific profile of the DL1 stream:
1. Enable the stream:
# yum module enable idm:DL1
2. Switch to the RPMs delivered through the stream:
# yum distro-sync
3. Install the selected profile:
# yum module install idm:DL1/profile
Replace profile with one of the specific profiles defined above.
For details, see Installing packages required for an Identity Management server  and Packages required
to install an Identity Management client.
17.2. ACTIVE DIRECTORY USERS CAN NOW ADMINISTER IDENTITY
MANAGEMENT
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, external group membership allows AD users and groups to access
IdM resources in a POSIX environment with the help of the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD).
The IdM LDAP server has its own mechanisms to grant access control. RHEL 8 introduces an update
that allows adding an ID user override for an AD user as a member of an IdM group. An ID override is a
record describing what a specific Active Directory user or group properties should look like within a
specific ID view, in this case the Default Trust View. As a consequence of the update, the IdM LDAP
server is able to apply access control rules for the IdM group to the AD user.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
96

AD users are now able to use the self service features of IdM UI, for example to upload their SSH keys,
or change their personal data. An AD administrator is able to fully administer IdM without having two
different accounts and passwords.
NOTE
Currently, selected features in IdM may still be unavailable to AD users. For example,
setting passwords for IdM users as an AD user from the IdM admins group might fail.
17.3. SESSION RECORDING SOLUTION FOR RHEL 8 ADDED
A session recording solution has been added to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL 8). A new tlog
package and its associated web console session player enable to record and playback the user terminal
sessions. The recording can be configured per user or user group via the System Security Services
Daemon (SSSD) service. All terminal input and output is captured and stored in a text-based format in a
system journal. The input is inactive by default for security reasons not to intercept raw passwords and
other sensitive information.
The solution can be used for auditing of user sessions on security-sensitive systems. In the event of a
security breach, the recorded sessions can be reviewed as a part of a forensic analysis. The system
administrators are now able to configure the session recording locally and view the result from the RHEL
8 web console interface or from the Command-Line Interface using the tlog-play utility.
17.4. REMOVED IDENTITY MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONALITY
17.4.1. NSS databases not supported in OpenLDAP
The OpenLDAP suite in previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) used the Mozilla Network
Security Services (NSS) for cryptographic purposes. With RHEL 8, OpenSSL, which is supported by the
OpenLDAP community, replaces NSS. OpenSSL does not support NSS databases for storing
certificates and keys. However, it still supports privacy enhanced mail (PEM) files that serve the same
purpose.
17.4.2. Selected Python Kerberos packages have been replaced
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, the python-gssapi package, python-requests-gssapi module,
and urllib-gssapi library have replaced Python Kerberos packages such as python-krbV, python-
kerberos, python-requests-kerberos, and python-urllib2_kerberos. Notable benefits include:
python-gssapi is easier to use than python-kerberos and python-krbV
python-gssapi supports both python 2 and python 3 whereas python-krbV does not
the GSSAPI-based packages allow the use of other Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI)
mechanisms in addition to Kerberos, such as the NT LAN Manager NTLM for backward
compatibility reasons
This update improves the maintainability and debuggability of GSSAPI in RHEL 8.
17.5. SSSD
17.5.1. authselect replaces authconfig
CHAPTER 17. IDENTITY MANAGEMENT
97

In RHEL 8, the authselect utility replaces the authconfig utility. authselect comes with a safer
approach to PAM stack management that makes the PAM configuration changes simpler for system
administrators. authselect can be used to configure authentication methods such as passwords,
certificates, smart cards and fingerprint. authselect does not configure services required to join remote
domains. This task is performed by specialized tools, such as realmd or ipa-client-install.
17.5.2. KCM replaces KEYRING as the default credential cache storage
In RHEL 8, the default credential cache storage is the Kerberos Credential Manager (KCM) which is
backed by the sssd-kcm deamon. KCM overcomes the limitations of the previously used KEYRING,
such as its being difficult to use in containerized environments because it is not namespaced, and to
view and manage quotas.
With this update, RHEL 8 contains a credential cache that is better suited for containerized
environments and that provides a basis for building more features in future releases.
17.5.3. sssctl prints an HBAC rules report for an IdM domain
With this update, the sssctl utility of the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) can print an access
control report for an Identity Management (IdM) domain. This feature meets the need of certain
environments to see, for regulatory reasons, a list of users and groups that can access a specific client
machine. Running sssctl access-report domain_name on an IdM client prints the parsed subset of
host-based access control (HBAC) rules in the IdM domain that apply to the client machine.
Note that no other providers than IdM support this feature.
17.5.4. Local users are cached by SSSD and served through the nss_sss module
In RHEL 8, the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) serves users and groups from the 
/etc/passwd and /etc/groups files by default. The sss nsswitch module precedes files in the 
/etc/nsswitch.conf file.
The advantage of serving local users through SSSD is that the nss_sss module has a fast memory-
mapped cache that speeds up Name Service Switch (NSS) lookups compared to accessing the disk and
opening the files on each NSS request. Previously, the Name service cache daemon (nscd) helped
accelerate the process of accessing the disk. However, using nscd in parallel with SSSD is cumbersome,
as both SSSD and nscd use their own independent caching. Consequently, using nscd in setups where
SSSD is also serving users from a remote domain, for example LDAP or Active Directory, can cause
unpredictable behavior.
With this update, the resolution of local users and groups is faster in RHEL 8. Note that the root user is
never handled by SSSD, therefore root resolution cannot be impacted by a potential bug in SSSD. Note
also that if SSSD is not running, the nss_sss module handles the situation gracefully by falling back to 
nss_files to avoid problems. You do not have to configure SSSD in any way, the files domain is added
automatically.
17.5.5. SSSD now allows you to select one of the multiple smart-card authentication
devices
By default, the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) tries to detect a device for smart-card
authentication automatically. If there are multiple devices connected, SSSD selects the first one it
detects. Consequently, you cannot select a particular device, which sometimes leads to failures.
With this update, you can configure a new p11_uri option for the [pam] section of the sssd.conf
configuration file. This option enables you to define which device is used for smart-card authentication.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
98

For example, to select a reader with the slot id 2 detected by the OpenSC PKCS#11 module, add:
p11_uri = library-description=OpenSC%20smartcard%20framework;slot-id=2
to the [pam] section of sssd.conf.
For details, see the man sssd.conf page.
17.6. REMOVED SSSD FUNCTIONALITY
17.6.1. sssd-secrets has been removed
The sssd-secrets component of the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) has been removed in
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. This is because Custodia, a secrets service provider, is no longer actively
developed. Use other Identity Management tools to store secrets, for example the Identity Management
Vault. :parent-context-of-the-web-console: considerations-in-adopting-RHEL-8

CHAPTER 18. THE WEB CONSOLE
18.1. THE WEB CONSOLE IS NOW AVAILABLE BY DEFAULT
Packages for the RHEL 8 web console, also known as Cockpit, are now part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
default repositories, and can therefore be immediately installed on a registered RHEL 8 system.
In addition, on a non-minimal installation of RHEL 8, the web console is automatically installed and
firewall ports required by the console are automatically open.
A system message has also been added prior to login that provides information about how to enable or
access the web console.
18.2. NEW FIREWALL INTERFACE
The Networking tab in the RHEL 8 web console now includes the Firewall settings. In this section, users
can:
Enable/disable firewall
Add/remove services
For details, see Using the web console for managing firewall .
18.3. SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT
The RHEL 8 web console provides an interface for using Red Hat Subscription Manager installed on your
local system. The Subscription Manager connects to the Red Hat Customer Portal and verifies all
available:
Active subscriptions
Expired subscriptions
Renewed subscriptions
If you want to renew the subscription or get a different one in Red Hat Customer Portal, you do not have
to update the Subscription Manager data manually. The Subscription Manager synchronizes data with
Red Hat Customer Portal automatically.
This paragraph is the assembly introduction. It explains what the user will accomplish by working through
the modules in the assembly and sets the context for the user story the assembly is based on. Can
include more than one paragraph. Consider using the information from the user story.
NOTE
The web console’s Subscriptions page is now provided by the new subscription-manager-
cockpit package.
For details, see Managing subscriptions in the web console .
18.4. BETTER IDM INTEGRATION FOR THE WEB CONSOLE
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Considerations in adopting RHEL 8
100

If your system is enrolled in an Identity Management (IdM) domain, the RHEL 8 web console now uses
the domain’s centrally managed IdM resources by default. This includes the following benefits:
The IdM domain’s administrators can use the web console to manage the local machine.
The console’s web server automatically switches to a certificate issued by the IdM certificate
authority (CA) and accepted by browsers.
Users with a Kerberos ticket in the IdM domain do not need to provide login credentials to
access the web console.
SSH hosts known to the IdM domain are accessible to the web console without manually adding
an SSH connection.
Note that for IdM integration with the web console to work properly, the user first needs to run the ipa-
advise utility with the enable-admins-sudo option in the IdM master system.
18.5. THE WEB CONSOLE IS NOW COMPATIBLE WITH MOBILE
BROWSERS
With this update, the web console menus and pages can be navigated on mobile browser variants. This
makes it possible to manage systems using the RHEL 8 web console from a mobile device.
18.6. THE WEB CONSOLE FRONT PAGE NOW DISPLAYS MISSING
UPDATES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
If a system managed by the RHEL 8 web console has outdated packages or a lapsed subscription, a
warning is now displayed on the web console front page of the system.
18.7. THE WEB CONSOLE NOW SUPPORTS PBD ENROLLMENT
With this update, you can use the the RHEL 8 web console interface to apply Policy-Based Decryption
(PBD) rules to disks on managed systems. This uses the Clevis decryption client to facilitate a variety of
security management functions in the web console, such as automatic unlocking of LUKS-encrypted
disk partitions.
18.8. SUPPORT LUKS V2
In the web console’s Storage tab, you can now create, lock, unlock, resize, and otherwise configure
encrypted devices using the LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) version 2 format.
This new version of LUKS offers:
More flexible unlocking policies
Stronger cryptography
Better compatibility with future changes
18.9. VIRTUAL MACHINES CAN NOW BE MANAGED USING THE WEB
CONSOLE
CHAPTER 18. THE WEB CONSOLE
101

The Virtual Machines page can now be added to the RHEL 8 web console interface, which enables the
user to create and manage libvirt-based virtual machines.
For information about the differences in virtual management features between the web console and the
Virtual Machine Manager, see Differences in virtualization features in Virtual Machine Manager and the
web console.
18.10. INTERNET EXPLORER UNSUPPORTED BY THE WEB CONSOLE
Support for the Internet Explorer browser has been removed from the RHEL 8 web console. Attempting
to open the web console in Internet Explorer now displays an error screen with a list of recommended
browsers that can be used instead.

102

CHAPTER 19. VIRTUALIZATION
19.1. VIRTUAL MACHINES CAN NOW BE MANAGED USING THE WEB
CONSOLE
The Virtual Machines page can now be added to the RHEL 8 web console interface, which enables the
user to create and manage libvirt-based virtual machines (VMs).
In addition, the Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager) application has been deprecated, and may
become unsupported in a future major release of RHEL.
Note, however, that the web console currently does not provide all of the virtual management features
that virt-manager does. For details about the differences in available features between the RHEL 8 web
console and the Virtual Machine Manager, see the Configuring and managing virtualization document.
19.2. THE Q35 MACHINE TYPE IS NOW SUPPORTED BY
VIRTUALIZATION
Red hat Enterprise Linux 8 introduces the support for Q35, a more modern PCI Express-based machine
type. This provides a variety of improvements in features and performance of virtual devices, and
ensures that a wider range of modern devices are compatible with virtualization. In addition, virtual
machines created in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 are set to use Q35 by default.
Note that the previously default PC machine type has become deprecated and may become
unsupported in a future major release of RHEL. However, changing the machine type of existing VMs
from PC to Q35 is not recommended.
Notable differences between PC and Q35 include:
Older operating systems, such as Windows XP, do not support Q35 and will not boot if used on a
Q35 VM.
Currently, when using RHEL 6 as the operating system on a Q35 VM, hot-plugging a PCI device
to that VM in some cases does not work. In addition, certain legacy virtio devices do not work
properly on RHEL 6 Q35 VMs.
Therefore, using the PC machine type is recommended for RHEL 6 VMs.
Q35 emulates PCI Express (PCI-e) buses instead of PCI. As a result, a different device
topology and addressing scheme is presented to the guest OS.
Q35 has a built-in SATA/AHCI controller, instead of an IDE controller.
The SecureBoot feature only works on Q35 VMs.
19.3. REMOVED VIRTUALIZATION FUNCTIONALITY
The cpu64-rhel6 CPU model has been deprecated and removed
The cpu64-rhel6 QEMU virtual CPU model has been deprecated in RHEL 8.1, and has been removed
from RHEL 8.2. It is recommended that you use the other CPU models provided by QEMU and libvirt,
according to the CPU present on the host machine.
IVSHMEM has been disabled
CHAPTER 19. VIRTUALIZATION
103

The inter-VM shared memory device (IVSHMEM) feature, which provides shared memory between
multiple virtual machines, is now disabled in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. A virtual machine configured
with this device will fail to boot. Similarly, attempting to hot-plug such a device device will fail as well.
virt-install can no longer use NFS locations
With this update, the virt-install utility cannot mount NFS locations. As a consequence, attempting to
install a virtual machine using virt-install with a NFS address as a value of the --location option fails. To
work around this change, mount your NFS share prior to using virt-install, or use a HTTP location.
RHEL 8 does not support the tulip driver
With this update, the tulip network driver is no longer supported. As a consequence, when using RHEL 8
on a Generation 1 virtual machine (VM) on the Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor, the "Legacy Network
Adapter" device does not work, which causes PXE installation of such VMs to fail.
For the PXE installation to work, install RHEL 8 on a Generation 2 Hyper-V VM. If you require a RHEL 8
Generation 1 VM, use ISO installation.
LSI Logic SAS and Parallel SCSI drivers are not supported
The LSI Logic SAS driver (mptsas) and LSI Logic Parallel driver (mptspi) for SCSI are no longer
supported. As a consequence, the drivers can be used for installing RHEL 8 as a guest operating system
on a VMWare hypervisor to a SCSI disk, but the created VM will not be supported by Red Hat.
Installing virtio-win no longer creates a floppy disk image with the Windows drivers
Due to the limitation of floppy drives, virtio-win drivers are no longer provided as floppy images. Users
should use the ISO image instead. :context: considerations-in-adopting-RHEL-8

CHAPTER 20. CONTAINERS
A set of container images is available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. Notable changes include:
Docker is not included in RHEL 8.0. For working with containers, use the podman, buildah,
skopeo, and runc tools.
For information on these tools and on using containers in RHEL 8, see Building, running, and
managing containers.
The podman tool has been released as a fully supported feature.
The podman tool manages pods, container images, and containers on a single node. It is built on
the libpod library, which enables management of containers and groups of containers, called
pods.
To learn how to use podman, see Building, running, and managing containers.
In RHEL 8 GA, Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI) are newly available. UBIs replace some of
the images Red Hat previously provided, such as the standard and the minimal RHEL base
images.
Unlike older Red Hat images, UBIs are freely redistributable. This means they can be used in any
environment and shared anywhere. You can use them even if you are not a Red Hat customer.
For UBI documentation, see Building, running, and managing containers.
In RHEL 8 GA, additional container images are available that provide AppStream components,
for which container images are distributed with Red Hat Software Collections in RHEL 7. All of
these RHEL 8 images are based on the ubi8 base image.
Container images ARM for the 64-bit ARM architecture are fully supported in RHEL 8.
The rhel-tools container has been removed in RHEL 8. The sos and redhat-support-tool tools
are provided in the support-tools container. System administrators can also use this image as a
base for building system tools container image.
The support for rootless containers is available as a technology preview in RHEL 8.
Rootless containers are containers that are created and managed by regular system users
without administrative permissions. :context: internationalization

20.2. NOTABLE CHANGES TO INTERNATIONALIZATION IN RHEL 8
RHEL 8 introduces the following changes to internationalization compared to RHEL 7:
Support for the Unicode 11 computing industry standard has been added.
Internationalization is distributed in multiple packages, which allows for smaller footprint
installations. For more information, see Using langpacks.
The glibc package updates for multiple locales are now synchronized with the Common Locale
Data Repository (CLDR). :context: considerations-in-adopting-RHEL-8

tools
RHEL 8.0
The 389-ds-base package in RHEL 7
contains Perl Tools for manipulating the
Directory Server. In RHEL 8, a new set of
tools written in Python is distributed within
the 389-ds-base package. The legacy Perl
Tools have been extracted into a separate
package, 389-ds-base-legacy-tools, but
are deprecated and not recommended for
use.

RHEL 8.0
The apr-util-bdb and apr-util-openssl
packages have been split from apr-util.
These package provides the loadable module
supporting Berkeley DB in the apr_dbm.h
interface, and OpenSSL in the apr_crypto.h
interface, respectively. Both the apr-util-
bdb and apr-util-openssl packages have a
weak dependency from apr-util, so
packages using these APIs should continue to
work without changes.

The authselect utility improves the
configuration of user authentication on RHEL

configuring the operating system’s PAM
stack. To simplify the migration from 
authconfig, the authselect-compat
package is provided with the respective
compatibility command.

The bind-libs-lite libraries have been
moved to the bind-export-libs package,
used by the dhcp-client and dhcp-server
packages. The bind-libs-lite libraries now
contain a subset of bind-libs, which
depends on the bind-libs-lite package. The 
dhcp-server and dhcp-client now depend
on the bind-export-libs package.

The bind-export-devel package provides a

package. Cflags and libraries used for linking
to export libraries should be obtained from
the isc-export-config.sh output. Linking
against the bind-export-libs libraries should
be done using the isc-export-config.sh
parameters.

In RHEL 8, the package providing the Perl
interpreter has been renamed from perl to 
perl-interpreter, while the perl package is
now just a meta-package. Basic language
support modules have been moved to perl-
