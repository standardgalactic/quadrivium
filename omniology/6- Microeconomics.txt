Preface to the Student
E
conomics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” 
So wrote Alfred Marshall, the great 19th-century economist, in his text-
book, Principles of Economics. Although we have learned much about the 
economy since Marshall’s time, this definition of economics is as true 
today as it was in 1890, when the first edition of his text was published.
Why should you, as a student at the beginning of the 21st century, embark on 
the study of economics? There are three reasons.
The first reason to study economics is that it will help you understand the 
world in which you live. There are many questions about the economy that might 
spark your curiosity. Why are apartments so hard to find in New York City? Why 
do airlines charge less for a round-trip ticket if the traveler stays over a Saturday 
night? Why is Leonardo DiCaprio paid so much to star in movies? Why are liv-
ing standards so meager in many African countries? Why do some countries have 
high rates of inflation while others have stable prices? Why are jobs easy to find in 
some years and hard to find in others? These are just a few of the questions that a 
course in economics will help you answer.
The second reason to study economics is that it will make you a more astute 
participant in the economy. As you go about your life, you make many economic 
decisions. While you are a student, you decide how many years to stay in school. 
Once you take a job, you decide how much of your income to spend, how much 
to save, and how to invest your savings. Someday you may find yourself running 
a small business or a large corporation, and you will decide what prices to charge 
for your products. The insights developed in the coming chapters will give you a 
new perspective on how best to make these decisions. Studying economics will 
not by itself make you rich, but it will give you some tools that may help in that 
endeavor.
The third reason to study economics is that it will give you a better understand-
ing of both the potential and the limits of economic policy. Economic questions 
are always on the minds of policymakers in mayors’ offices, governors’ mansions, 
and the White House. What are the burdens associated with alternative forms of 
taxation? What are the effects of free trade with other countries? What is the best 
way to protect the environment? How does a government budget deficit affect 
the economy? As a voter, you help choose the policies that guide the allocation of 
society’s resources. An understanding of economics will help you carry out that 
responsibility. And who knows: Perhaps someday you will end up as one of those 
policymakers yourself. 
Thus, the principles of economics can be applied in many of life’s situations. 
Whether the future finds you reading the newspaper, running a business, or sit-
ting in the Oval Office, you will be glad that you studied economics.

I
n writing this book, I benefited from the input of many talented people. 
­Indeed, the list of people who have contributed to this project is so long, and 
their contributions so valuable, that it seems an injustice that only a single 
name appears on the cover. 
Let me begin with my colleagues in the economics profession. The seven edi-
tions of this text and its supplemental materials have benefited enormously from 
their input. In reviews and surveys, they have offered suggestions, identified 
challenges, and shared ideas from their own classroom experience. I am indebted 
to them for the perspectives they have brought to the text. Unfortunately, the list 
has become too long to thank those who contributed to previous editions, even 
though students reading the current edition are still benefiting from their insights. 
Most important in this process have been Ron Cronovich (Carthage College) 
and David Hakes (University of Northern Iowa). Ron and David, both dedicated 
teachers, have served as reliable sounding boards for ideas and hardworking 
partners with me in putting together the superb package of supplements. 
The following reviewers of the sixth edition provided suggestions for refining 
the content, organization, and approach in the seventh.

The team of editors who worked on this book improved it tremendously. Jane 
Tufts, developmental editor, provided truly spectacular editing—as she always 
does. Mike Worls, economics product director, did a splendid job of oversee-
ing the many people involved in such a large project. Jennifer Thomas, prod-
uct ­development manager; Clara Goosman, content developer; and Elizabeth 
­Beiting-Lipps, associate content developer, were crucial in assembling an exten-
sive and thoughtful group of reviewers to give me feedback on the previous edi-
tion while putting together an excellent team to revise the supplements. ­Colleen 
Farmer, ­senior content project manager, and Katy Gabel, project manager, had 
the patience and dedication necessary to turn my manuscript into this book. 
­Michelle Kunkler, senior art director, gave this book its clean, friendly look. Greg 
­LaFever, the illustrator, helped make the book more visually appealing and the 
economics in it less abstract. Pamela Rockwell, copyeditor, refined my prose, and 
­PreMediaGlobal prepared a careful and thorough index. John Carey, senior mar-
ket development manager, and Robin LeFevre, senior brand manager, worked 
long hours getting the word out to potential users of this book. The rest of the 
Cengage team was also consistently professional, enthusiastic, and dedicated.
I am grateful also to Lisa Mogilanski and Alex Sareyan, two star Harvard un-
dergraduates, who helped me refine the manuscript and check the page proofs for 
this edition. 
As always, I must thank my “in-house” editor, Deborah Mankiw. As the first 
reader of most things I write, she continued to offer just the right mix of criticism 
and encouragement.
Finally, I would like to mention my three children, Catherine, Nicholas, and 
Peter. Their contribution to this book was putting up with a father spending too 
many hours in his study. The four of us have much in common—not least of 
which is our love of ice cream (which becomes apparent in Chapter 4). I am grate-
ful to Nicholas in particular for helping me check the page proofs for this edition. 
In case you didn’t notice, Nick, it was just my way of tricking you into learning a 
bit of economics.

he word economy comes from the Greek word oikonomos, which means “one 
who manages a household.” At first, this origin might seem peculiar. But in 
fact, households and economies have much in common.
A household faces many decisions. It must decide which household members 
do which tasks and what each member receives in return: Who cooks dinner? 
Who does the laundry? Who gets the extra dessert at dinner? Who gets to drive 
the car? In short, a household must allocate its scarce resources (time, dessert, car 
mileage) among its various members, taking into account each member’s abilities, 
efforts, and desires.
Like a household, a society faces many decisions. It must find some way 
to decide what jobs will be done and who will do them. It needs some people 
to grow food, other people to make clothing, and still others to design com-
puter software. Once society has allocated people (as well as land, buildings, 
and machines) to various jobs, it must also allocate the goods and services

INTRODUCTION
they produce. It must decide who will eat caviar and who will eat potatoes. It 
must decide who will drive a Ferrari and who will take the bus.
The management of society’s resources is important because resources are 
scarce. Scarcity means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot 
produce all the goods and services people wish to have. Just as each member of 
a household cannot get everything she wants, each individual in a society cannot 
attain the highest standard of living to which she might aspire.
Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. In most so-
cieties, resources are allocated not by an all-powerful dictator but through the com-
bined choices of millions of households and firms. Economists, therefore, study 
how people make decisions: how much they work, what they buy, how much they 
save, and how they invest their savings. Economists also study how people in-
teract with one another. For instance, they examine how the multitude of buyers 
and sellers of a good together determine the price at which the good is sold and 
the quantity that is sold. Finally, economists analyze forces and trends that affect 
the economy as a whole, including the growth in average income, the fraction of 
the population that cannot find work, and the rate at which prices are rising.
The study of economics has many facets, but it is unified by several central 
ideas. In this chapter, we look at Ten Principles of Economics. Don’t worry if you 
don’t understand them all at first or if you aren’t completely convinced. We ex-
plore these ideas more fully in later chapters. The ten principles are introduced 
here to give you an overview of what economics is all about. Consider this chap-
ter a “preview of coming attractions.”
There is no mystery to what an economy is. Whether we are talking about the 
economy of Los Angeles, the United States, or the whole world, an economy is 
just a group of people dealing with one another as they go about their lives. Be-
cause the behavior of an economy reflects the behavior of the individuals who 
make up the economy, we begin our study of economics with four principles 
about individual decision making.
1-1a Principle 1: People Face Trade-offs
You may have heard the old saying, “There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” 
Grammar aside, there is much truth to this adage. To get something that we like, 
we usually have to give up something else that we also like. Making decisions 
requires trading off one goal against another.
Consider a student who must decide how to allocate her most valuable 
­resource—her time. She can spend all of her time studying economics, spend all 
of it studying psychology, or divide it between the two fields. For every hour she 
studies one subject, she gives up an hour she could have used studying the other. 
And for every hour she spends studying, she gives up an hour that she could 
have spent napping, bike riding, watching TV, or working at her part-time job for 
some extra spending money.
Or consider parents deciding how to spend their family income. They can buy 
food, clothing, or a family vacation. Or they can save some of the family income 
for retirement or for children’s college education. When they choose to spend an 
extra dollar on one of these goods, they have one less dollar to spend on some 
other good.

CHAPTER 1  TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS

When people are grouped into societies, they face different kinds of trade-offs. 
One classic trade-off is between “guns and butter.” The more a society spends 
on national defense (guns) to protect its shores from foreign aggressors, the less 
it can spend on consumer goods (butter) to raise the standard of living at home. 
Also important in modern society is the trade-off between a clean environment 
and a high level of income. Laws that require firms to reduce pollution raise the 
cost of producing goods and services. Because of these higher costs, the firms end 
up earning smaller profits, paying lower wages, charging higher prices, or some 
combination of these three. Thus, while pollution regulations yield the benefit of a 
cleaner environment and the improved health that comes with it, the regulations 
come at the cost of reducing the incomes of the regulated firms’ owners, workers, 
and customers.
Another trade-off society faces is between efficiency and equality. Efficiency 
means that society is getting the maximum benefits from its scarce resources. 
Equality means that those benefits are distributed uniformly among society’s 
members. In other words, efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and 
equality refers to how the pie is divided into individual slices.
When government policies are designed, these two goals often conflict. Con-
sider, for instance, policies aimed at equalizing the distribution of economic 
well-being. Some of these policies, such as the welfare system or unemployment 
insurance, try to help the members of society who are most in need. Others, such 
as the individual income tax, ask the financially successful to contribute more than 
others to support the government. Though they achieve greater equality, these pol-
icies reduce efficiency. When the government redistributes income from the rich to 
the poor, it reduces the reward for working hard; as a result, people work less and 
produce fewer goods and services. In other words, when the government tries to 
cut the economic pie into more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.
Recognizing that people face trade-offs does not by itself tell us what decisions 
they will or should make. A student should not abandon the study of psychology 
just because doing so would increase the time available for the study of econom-
ics. Society should not stop protecting the environment just because environmen-
tal regulations reduce our material standard of living. The poor should not be 
ignored just because helping them distorts work incentives. Nonetheless, people 
are likely to make good decisions only if they understand the options that are 
available to them. Our study of economics, therefore, starts by acknowledging 
life’s trade-offs.
1-1b Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You 
Give Up to Get It
Because people face trade-offs, making decisions requires comparing the costs 
and benefits of alternative courses of action. In many cases, however, the cost of 
an action is not as obvious as it might first appear.
Consider the decision to go to college. The main benefits are intellectual enrich-
ment and a lifetime of better job opportunities. But what are the costs? To answer 
this question, you might be tempted to add up the money you spend on tuition, 
books, room, and board. Yet this total does not truly represent what you give up 
to spend a year in college.
There are two problems with this calculation. First, it includes some things that 
are not really costs of going to college. Even if you quit school, you need a place 
to sleep and food to eat. Room and board are costs of going to college only to 
the extent that they are more expensive at college than elsewhere. Second, this

INTRODUCTION
calculation ignores the largest cost of going to college—your time. When you 
spend a year listening to lectures, reading textbooks, and writing papers, you can-
not spend that time working at a job. For most students, the earnings they give up 
to attend school are the single largest cost of their education.
The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item. When 
making any decision, decision makers should be aware of the opportunity costs 
that accompany each possible action. In fact, they usually are. College athletes 
who can earn millions if they drop out of school and play professional sports are 
well aware that the opportunity cost of their attending college is very high. It is 
not surprising that they often decide that the benefit of a college education is not 
worth the cost.
1-1c Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin
Economists normally assume that people are rational. Rational people systemati-
cally and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given the 
available opportunities. As you study economics, you will encounter firms that 
decide how many workers to hire and how much of their product to manufacture 
and sell to maximize profits. You will also encounter individuals who decide how 
much time to spend working and what goods and services to buy with the result-
ing income to achieve the highest possible level of satisfaction.
Rational people know that decisions in life are rarely black and white but usu-
ally involve shades of gray. At dinnertime, the question you face is not “Should I 
fast or eat like a pig?” More likely, you will be asking yourself “Should I take that 
extra spoonful of mashed potatoes?” When exams roll around, your decision is 
not between blowing them off and studying twenty-four hours a day but whether 
to spend an extra hour reviewing your notes instead of watching TV. Economists 
use the term marginal change to describe a small incremental adjustment to an 
existing plan of action. Keep in mind that margin means “edge,” so marginal 
changes are adjustments around the edges of what you are doing. Rational people 
often make decisions by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.
For example, suppose you are considering calling a friend on your cell phone. 
You decide that talking with her for 10 minutes would give you a benefit that you 
value at about $7. Your cell phone service costs you $40 per month plus $0.50 per 
minute for whatever calls you make. You usually talk for 100 minutes a month, 
so your total monthly bill is $90 ($0.50 per minute times 100 minutes, plus the 
$40 fixed fee). Under these circumstances, should you make the call? You might 
be tempted to reason as follows: “Because I pay $90 for 100 minutes of calling 
each month, the average minute on the phone costs me $0.90. So a 10-­minute 
call costs $9. Because that $9 cost is greater than the $7 benefit, I am going to 
skip the call.” That conclusion is wrong, however. Although the average cost of 
a 10-­minute call is $9, the marginal cost—the amount your bill increases if you 
make the extra call—is only $5. You will make the right decision only by compar-
ing the marginal benefit and the marginal cost. Because the marginal benefit of 
$7 is greater than the marginal cost of $5, you should make the call. This is a prin-
ciple that people innately understand: Cell phone users with unlimited ­minutes 
(that is, minutes that are free at the margin) are often prone to make long and 
frivolous calls.
Thinking at the margin works for business decisions as well. Consider an air-
line deciding how much to charge passengers who fly standby. Suppose that fly-
ing a 200-seat plane across the United States costs the airline $100,000. In this case, 
the average cost of each seat is $100,000/200, which is $500. One might be tempted

to conclude that the airline should never sell a ticket for less than $500. But a ratio-
nal airline can increase its profits by thinking at the margin. Imagine that a plane 
is about to take off with 10 empty seats and a standby passenger waiting at the 
gate is willing to pay $300 for a seat. Should the airline sell the ticket? Of course, 
it should. If the plane has empty seats, the cost of adding one more passenger is 
tiny. The average cost of flying a passenger is $500, but the marginal cost is merely 
the cost of the bag of peanuts and can of soda that the extra passenger will con-
sume. As long as the standby passenger pays more than the marginal cost, selling 
the ticket is profitable.
Marginal decision making can help explain some otherwise puzzling economic 
phenomena. Here is a classic question: Why is water so cheap, while diamonds 
are so expensive? Humans need water to survive, while diamonds are unneces-
sary; but for some reason, people are willing to pay much more for a diamond 
than for a cup of water. The reason is that a person’s willingness to pay for a 
good is based on the marginal benefit that an extra unit of the good would yield. 
The marginal benefit, in turn, depends on how many units a person already has. 
­Water is ­essential, but the marginal benefit of an extra cup is small because water 
is plentiful. By contrast, no one needs diamonds to survive, but because diamonds 
are so rare, people consider the marginal benefit of an extra diamond to be large.
A rational decision maker takes an action if and only if the marginal benefit of 
the action exceeds the marginal cost. This principle explains why people use their 
cell phones as much as they do, why airlines are willing to sell tickets below aver-
age cost, and why people are willing to pay more for diamonds than for water. It 
can take some time to get used to the logic of marginal thinking, but the study of 
economics will give you ample opportunity to practice.
1-1d Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives
An incentive is something (such as a prospect of a punishment or reward) that in-
duces a person to act. Because rational people make decisions by comparing costs 
and benefits, they respond to incentives. You will see that incentives play a central 
role in the study of economics. One economist went so far as to suggest that the 
entire field could be summarized as simply “People respond to incentives. The 
rest is commentary.”
Incentives are crucial to analyzing how markets work. For example, when the 
price of an apple rises, people decide to eat fewer apples. At the same time, apple 
orchards decide to hire more workers and harvest more apples. In other words, a 
higher price in a market provides an incentive for buyers to consume less and an 
incentive for sellers to produce more. As we will see, the influence of prices on the 
behavior of consumers and producers is crucial for how a market economy allo-
cates scarce resources.
Public policymakers should never forget about incentives: Many policies change 
the costs or benefits that people face and, as a result, alter their behavior. A tax on 
gasoline, for instance, encourages people to drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. 
That is one reason people drive smaller cars in Europe, where gasoline taxes are 
high, than in the United States, where gasoline taxes are low. A higher gasoline 
tax also encourages people to carpool, take public transportation, and live closer 
to where they work. If the tax were larger, more people would be driving hybrid 
cars, and if it were large enough, they would switch to electric cars.
When policymakers fail to consider how their policies affect incentives, they 
often end up with unintended consequences. For example, consider public policy 
regarding auto safety. Today, all cars have seat belts, but this was not true fifty

INTRODUCTION
years ago. In the 1960s, Ralph Nader’s book Unsafe at Any Speed generated much 
public concern over auto safety. Congress responded with laws requiring seat 
belts as standard equipment on new cars.
How does a seat belt law affect auto safety? The direct effect is obvious: When 
a person wears a seat belt, the probability of surviving an auto accident rises. But 
that’s not the end of the story because the law also affects behavior by altering in-
centives. The relevant behavior here is the speed and care with which drivers op-
erate their cars. Driving slowly and carefully is costly because it uses the driver’s 
time and energy. When deciding how safely to drive, rational people compare, 
perhaps unconsciously, the marginal benefit from safer driving to the marginal 
cost. As a result, they drive more slowly and carefully when the benefit of in-
creased safety is high. For example, when road conditions are icy, people drive 
more attentively and at lower speeds than they do when road conditions are clear.
Consider how a seat belt law alters a driver’s cost–benefit calculation. Seat belts 
make accidents less costly because they reduce the likelihood of injury or death. 
In other words, seat belts reduce the benefits of slow and careful driving. People 
respond to seat belts as they would to an improvement in road conditions—by 
driving faster and less carefully. The result of a seat belt law, therefore, is a larger 
number of accidents. The decline in safe driving has a clear, adverse impact on 
pedestrians, who are more likely to find themselves in an accident but (unlike the 
drivers) don’t have the benefit of added protection.
At first, this discussion of incentives and seat belts might seem like idle spec-
ulation. Yet in a classic 1975 study, economist Sam Peltzman argued that auto-
safety laws have had many of these effects. According to Peltzman’s evidence, 
these laws produce both fewer deaths per accident and more accidents. He con-
cluded that the net result is little change in the number of driver deaths and an 
increase in the number of pedestrian deaths.
Peltzman’s analysis of auto safety is an offbeat and controversial example of 
the general principle that people respond to incentives. When analyzing any pol-
icy, we must consider not only the direct effects but also the less obvious indirect 
effects that work through incentives. If the policy changes incentives, it will cause 
people to alter their behavior.
The Incentive Effects of Gasoline Prices
From 2005 to 2008 the price of oil in world oil markets skyrocketed, 
the result of limited supplies together with surging demand from robust 
world growth, especially in China. The price of gasoline in the United States 
rose from about $2 to about $4 a gallon. At the time, the news was filled with 
stories about how people responded to the increased incentive to conserve—
sometimes in obvious ways, sometimes in less obvious ways.
Here is a sampling of various stories:
•	 “As Gas Prices Soar, Buyers Are Flocking to Small Cars”
•	 “As Gas Prices Climb, So Do Scooter Sales”
•	 “Gas Prices Knock Bicycles Sales, Repairs into Higher Gear”
•	 “Gas Prices Send Surge of Riders to Mass Transit”
•	 “Camel Demand Up as Oil Price Soars”: Farmers in the Indian state of 
­Rajasthan are rediscovering the humble camel. As the cost of running  
gas-­guzzling tractors soars, even-toed ungulates are making a comeback.
•	 “The Airlines Are Suffering, but the Order Books of Boeing and Airbus Are 
Bulging”: Demand for new, more fuel-efficient aircraft has never been greater.

The first four principles discussed how individuals make decisions. As we go 
about our lives, many of our decisions affect not only ourselves but other people 
as well. The next three principles concern how people interact with one another.
1-2a Principle 5: Trade Can Make 
Everyone Better Off
You may have heard on the news that the Chinese are our competitors in the 
world economy. In some ways, this is true because American and Chinese firms 
produce many of the same goods. Companies in the United States and China 
compete for the same customers in the markets for clothing, toys, solar panels, 
automobile tires, and many other items.
Yet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries. 
Trade between the United States and China is not like a sports contest in which 
one side wins and the other side loses. In fact, the opposite is true: Trade between 
two countries can make each country better off.
To see why, consider how trade affects your family. When a member of your 
family looks for a job, she competes against members of other families who are 
looking for jobs. Families also compete against one another when they go shop-
ping because each family wants to buy the best goods at the lowest prices. In a

INTRODUCTION
Despite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself from 
all other families. If it did, your family would need to grow its own food, make its 
own clothes, and build its own home. Clearly, your family gains much from its abil-
ity to trade with others. Trade allows each person to specialize in the activities she 
does best, whether it is farming, sewing, or home building. By trading with others, 
people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost.
Countries as well as families benefit from the ability to trade with one another. 
Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater va-
riety of goods and services. The Chinese, as well as the French and the Egyptians 
and the Brazilians, are as much our partners in the world economy as they are our 
competitors.
1-2b Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good 
Way to Organize Economic Activity
The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the 1980s 
was one of the last century’s most important changes. Communist countries op-
erated on the premise that government officials were in the best position to allo-
cate the economy’s scarce resources. These central planners decided what goods 
and services were produced, how much was produced, and who produced and 
consumed these goods and services. The theory behind central planning was that 
only the government could organize economic activity in a way that promoted 
economic well-being for the country as a whole.
Most countries that once had centrally planned economies have abandoned the 
system and are instead developing market economies. In a market economy, the 
decisions of a central planner are replaced by the decisions of millions of firms and 
households. Firms decide whom to hire and what to make. Households decide which 
firms to work for and what to buy with their incomes. These firms and households 
interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest guide their decisions.
At first glance, the success of market economies is puzzling. In a market econ-
omy, no one is looking out for the economic well-being of society as a whole. Free 
markets contain many buyers and sellers of numerous goods and services, and 
all of them are interested primarily in their own well-being. Yet despite decentral-
ized decision making and self-interested decision makers, market economies have 
proven remarkably successful in organizing economic activity to promote overall 
economic well-being.
In his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 
economist Adam Smith made the most famous observation in all of economics: 
Households and firms interacting in markets act as if they are guided by an “in-
visible hand” that leads them to desirable market outcomes. One of our goals in 
this book is to understand how this invisible hand works its magic.
As you study economics, you will learn that prices are the instrument with 
which the invisible hand directs economic activity. In any market, buyers look at 
the price when determining how much to demand, and sellers look at the price 
when deciding how much to supply. As a result of the decisions that buyers and 
sellers make, market prices reflect both the value of a good to society and the 
cost to society of making the good. Smith’s great insight was that prices adjust to 
guide these individual buyers and sellers to reach outcomes that, in many cases, 
maximize the well-being of society as a whole.
Smith’s insight has an important corollary: When a government prevents 
prices from adjusting naturally to supply and demand, it impedes the invisible 
hand’s ability to coordinate the decisions of the households and firms that make 
market economy
an economy that 
allocates resources 
through the decentralized 
decisions of many firms 
and households as they 
interact in markets for 
goods and services

up an economy. This corollary explains why taxes adversely affect the allocation 
of resources: They distort prices and thus the decisions of households and firms. It 
also explains the great harm caused by policies that directly control prices, such as 
rent control. And it explains the failure of communism. In communist countries, 
prices were not determined in the marketplace but were dictated by central plan-
ners. These planners lacked the necessary information about consumers’ tastes 
and producers’ costs, which in a market economy is reflected in prices. Central 
planners failed because they tried to run the economy with one hand tied behind 
their backs—the invisible hand of the marketplace.
1-2c Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes 
­Improve Market Outcomes
If the invisible hand of the market is so great, why do we need government? One 
purpose of studying economics is to refine your view about the proper role and 
scope of government policy.
One reason we need government is that the invisible hand can work its magic 
only if the government enforces the rules and maintains the institutions that are 
Adam Smith and the  
Invisible Hand
I
t may be only a coincidence that Adam Smith’s great book The Wealth 
of Nations was published in 1776, the exact year in which American 
revolutionaries signed the Declaration of Independence. But the two docu-
ments share a point of view that was prevalent at the time: Individuals 
are usually best left to their own devices, without the heavy hand of gov-
ernment guiding their actions. This political philosophy provides the intel-
lectual basis for the market economy and for free society more generally.
Why do decentralized market economies work so well? Is it because 
people can be counted on to treat one another with love and kindness? 
Not at all. Here is Adam Smith’s description of how people interact in a 
market economy:
Man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, 
and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. 
He will be more likely to prevail if 
he can interest their self-love in his 
favour, and show them that it is for 
their own advantage to do for him 
what he requires of them. . . . Give 
me that which I want, and you shall 
have this which you want, is the 
meaning of every such offer; and 
it is in this manner that we obtain 
from one another the far greater 
part of those good offices which we 
stand in need of.
It is not from the 
benevolence of the 
butcher, the brewer, or 
the baker that we expect our din-
ner, but from their regard to their own in-
terest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their 
self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but 
of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chooses to depend 
chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow-citizens. . . .
Every individual . . . neither intends to promote the public 
interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. . . . He intends 
only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led 
by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his 
intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no 
part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes 
that of the society more effectually than when he really intends 
to promote it.
Smith is saying that participants in the economy are motivated by self-
interest and that the “invisible hand” of the marketplace guides this 
self-interest into promoting general economic well-being.
Many of Smith’s insights remain at the center of modern economics. 
Our analysis in the coming chapters will allow us to express Smith’s 
conclusions more precisely and to analyze more fully the strengths and 
weaknesses of the market’s invisible hand.

INTRODUCTION
key to a market economy. Most important, market economies need institutions 
to enforce property rights so individuals can own and control scarce resources. 
A farmer won’t grow food if she expects her crop to be stolen; a restaurant won’t 
serve meals unless it is assured that customers will pay before they leave; and 
an entertainment company won’t produce DVDs if too many potential custom-
ers avoid paying by making illegal copies. We all rely on government-provided 
police and courts to enforce our rights over the things we produce—and the invis-
ible hand counts on our ability to enforce our rights.
Yet there is another reason we need government: The invisible hand is ­powerful, 
but it is not omnipotent. There are two broad reasons for a ­government to inter-
vene in the economy and change the allocation of resources that people would 
choose on their own: to promote efficiency or to promote equality. That is, most 
policies aim either to enlarge the economic pie or to change how the pie is divided.
Consider first the goal of efficiency. Although the invisible hand usually leads 
markets to allocate resources to maximize the size of the economic pie, this is not 
always the case. Economists use the term market failure to refer to a situation in 
which the market on its own fails to produce an efficient allocation of resources. 
As we will see, one possible cause of market failure is an externality, which is 
the impact of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander. The classic 
example of an externality is pollution. When the production of a good pollutes 
the air and creates health problems for those who live near the factories, the mar-
ket left to its own devices may fail to take this cost into account. Another possible 
cause of market failure is market power, which refers to the ability of a single 
person or firm (or a small group) to unduly influence market prices. For exam-
ple, if everyone in town needs water but there is only one well, the owner of the 
well is not subject to the rigorous competition with which the invisible hand nor-
mally keeps self-interest in check; she may take advantage of this opportunity by 
­restricting the output of water so she can charge a higher price. In the presence of 
externalities or market power, well-designed public policy can enhance economic 
efficiency.
Now consider the goal of equality. Even when the invisible hand yields efficient 
outcomes, it can nonetheless leave sizable disparities in economic well-being. A 
market economy rewards people according to their ability to produce things that 
other people are willing to pay for. The world’s best basketball player earns more 
than the world’s best chess player simply because people are willing to pay more 
to watch basketball than chess. The invisible hand does not ensure that every-
one has sufficient food, decent clothing, and adequate healthcare. This inequality 
may, depending on one’s political philosophy, call for government intervention. 
In practice, many public policies, such as the income tax and the welfare system, 
aim to achieve a more equal distribution of economic well-being.
To say that the government can improve on market outcomes at times does not 
mean that it always will. Public policy is made not by angels but by a political pro-
cess that is far from perfect. Sometimes policies are designed simply to reward the 
politically powerful. Sometimes they are made by well-intentioned leaders who 
are not fully informed. As you study economics, you will become a better judge of 
when a government policy is justifiable because it promotes efficiency or equality 
and when it is not.

1-3 How the Economy as a Whole Works
productivity
the quantity of goods and 
services produced from 
each unit of labor input
We started by discussing how individuals make decisions and then looked at how 
people interact with one another. All these decisions and interactions together 
make up “the economy.” The last three principles concern the workings of the 
economy as a whole.
1-3a Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living 
Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services
The differences in living standards around the world are staggering. In 2011, the 
average American had an income of about $48,000. In the same year, the average 
Mexican earned about $9,000, the average Chinese about $5,000, and the average 
Nigerian only $1,200. Not surprisingly, this large variation in average income is 
reflected in various measures of quality of life. Citizens of high-income countries 
have more TV sets, more cars, better nutrition, better healthcare, and a longer life 
expectancy than citizens of low-income countries.
Changes in living standards over time are also large. In the United States, 
incomes have historically grown about 2 percent per year (after adjusting for 
changes in the cost of living). At this rate, average income doubles every 35 years. 
Over the past century, average U.S. income has risen about eightfold.
What explains these large differences in living standards among countries and 
over time? The answer is surprisingly simple. Almost all variation in living stan-
dards is attributable to differences in countries’ productivity—that is, the amount 
of goods and services produced by each unit of labor input. In nations where 
workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services per hour, most peo-
ple enjoy a high standard of living; in nations where workers are less productive, 
most people endure a more meager existence. Similarly, the growth rate of a na-
tion’s productivity determines the growth rate of its average income.
The fundamental relationship between productivity and living standards is 
simple, but its implications are far-reaching. If productivity is the primary deter-
minant of living standards, other explanations must be of secondary importance. 
For example, it might be tempting to credit labor unions or minimum-wage laws 
for the rise in living standards of American workers over the past century. Yet the 
real hero of American workers is their rising productivity. As another example, 
some commentators have claimed that increased competition from Japan and 
other countries explained the slow growth in U.S. incomes during the 1970s and 
1980s. Yet the real villain was not competition from abroad but flagging produc-
tivity growth in the United States.
The relationship between productivity and living standards also has profound 
implications for public policy. When thinking about how any policy will affect liv-
ing standards, the key question is how it will affect our ability to produce goods 
and services. To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productivity 
by ensuring that workers are well educated, have the tools they need to produce 
goods and services, and have access to the best available technology.
1-3b Principle 9: Prices Rise When the 
Government Prints Too Much Money
In January 1921, a daily newspaper in Germany cost 0.30 marks. Less than 
two years later, in November 1922, the same newspaper cost 70,000,000 marks. 
All other prices in the economy rose by similar amounts. This episode is one of

The Dismal Science? 
Hardly!
By Robert D. McTeer, Jr.
M
y take on training in economics is that 
it becomes increasingly valuable as you 
move up the career ladder. I can’t imagine a 
better major for corporate CEOs, congress-
men, or American presidents. You’ve learned 
a systematic, disciplined way of thinking that 
will serve you well. By contrast, the economi-
cally challenged must be perplexed about how 
it is that economies work better the fewer 
people they have in charge. Who does the 
planning? Who makes decisions? Who decides 
what to produce? 
For my money, Adam Smith’s invis-
ible hand is the most important thing you’ve 
learned by studying economics. You under-
stand how we can each work for our own self-
interest and still produce a desirable social 
outcome. You know how uncoordinated activ-
ity gets coordinated by the market to enhance 
the wealth of nations. You understand the 
magic of markets and the dangers of tamper-
ing with them too much. You know better what 
you first learned in kindergarten: that you 
shouldn’t kill or cripple the goose that lays 
the golden eggs. . . .
Economics training will help you un-
derstand fallacies and unintended conse-
quences. In fact, I am inclined to define 
economics as the study of how to anticipate 
unintended consequences. . . .
Little in the literature seems more relevant 
to contemporary economic debates than what 
usually is called the broken window fallacy. 
Whenever a government program is justified 
not on its merits but by the jobs it will create, 
remember the broken window: Some teenag-
ers, being the little beasts that they are, toss a 
brick through a bakery window. A crowd gath-
ers and laments, “What a shame.” But before 
you know it, someone suggests a silver lining 
to the situation: Now the baker will have to 
spend money to have the window repaired. This 
will add to the income of the repairman, who 
will spend his additional income, which will 
add to another seller’s income, and so on. You 
know the drill. The chain of spending will mul-
tiply and generate higher income and employ-
ment. If the broken window is large enough, it 
might produce an economic boom! . . .
Most voters fall for the broken window 
fallacy, but not economics majors. They will 
say, “Hey, wait a minute!” If the baker hadn’t 
spent his money on window repair, he would 
have spent it on the new suit he was sav-
ing to buy. Then the tailor would have the 
new income to spend, and so on. The bro-
ken window didn’t create net new spending; 
it just diverted spending from somewhere 
else. The broken window does not create new 
­activity, just different activity. People see 
the activity that takes place. They don’t see 
the activity that would have taken place.
The broken window fallacy is perpetu-
ated in many forms. Whenever job creation or 
retention is the primary objective I call it the 
job-counting fallacy. Economics majors under-
stand the non-intuitive reality that real prog-
ress comes from job destruction. It once took 
90 percent of our population to grow our food. 
Now it takes 3 percent. Pardon me, ­Willie, but 
are we worse off because of the job losses in 
agriculture? The would-have-been farmers are 
now college professors and computer gurus. . . .
So instead of counting jobs, we should 
make every job count. We will occasionally hit 
a soft spot when we have a mismatch of sup-
ply and demand in the labor market. But that 
is temporary. Don’t become a Luddite and de-
stroy the machinery, or become a protectionist 
and try to grow bananas in New York City.

history’s most spectacular examples of inflation, an increase in the overall level of 
prices in the economy.
Although the United States has never experienced inflation even close to that 
of Germany in the 1920s, inflation has at times been an economic problem. Dur-
ing the 1970s, for instance, when the overall level of prices more than doubled, 
President Gerald Ford called inflation “public enemy number one.” By contrast, 
inflation in the first decade of the 21st century ran about 21⁄2 percent per year; at 
this rate, it would take almost 30 years for prices to double. Because high infla-
tion imposes various costs on society, keeping inflation at a low level is a goal of 
­economic policymakers around the world.

What causes inflation? In almost all cases of large or persistent inflation, the 
culprit is growth in the quantity of money. When a government creates large quan-
tities of the nation’s money, the value of the money falls. In Germany in the early 
1920s, when prices were on average tripling every month, the quantity of money 
was also tripling every month. Although less dramatic, the economic history of the 
United States points to a similar conclusion: The high inflation of the 1970s was as-
sociated with rapid growth in the quantity of money, and the low inflation of more 
recent experience was associated with slow growth in the quantity of money.
1-3c Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run 
Trade-off between Inflation and Unemployment
Although a higher level of prices is, in the long run, the primary effect of increas-
ing the quantity of money, the short-run story is more complex and controversial. 
Most economists describe the short-run effects of monetary injections as follows:
•	 Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level of 
spending and thus the demand for goods and services.
•	 Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but in the 
meantime, it also encourages them to hire more workers and produce a larger 
quantity of goods and services.
•	 More hiring means lower unemployment.
This line of reasoning leads to one final economy-wide trade-off: a short-run 
trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
Although some economists still question these ideas, most accept that society 
faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This simply means 
that, over a period of a year or two, many economic policies push inflation and un-
employment in opposite directions. Policymakers face this trade-off regardless of 
whether inflation and unemployment both start out at high levels (as they did in the 
early 1980s), at low levels (as they did in the late 1990s), or someplace in between. 
This short-run trade-off plays a key role in the analysis of the business cycle—the 
irregular and largely unpredictable fluctuations in economic activity, as measured by 
the production of goods and services or the number of people employed.
Policymakers can exploit the short-run trade-off between inflation and un-
employment using various policy instruments. By changing the amount that 
the government spends, the amount it taxes, and the amount of money it prints, 
­policymakers can influence the overall demand for goods and services. Changes 
in demand in turn influence the combination of inflation and unemployment that 
the economy experiences in the short run. Because these instruments of economic 
policy are potentially so powerful, how policymakers should use these instru-
ments to control the economy, if at all, is a subject of continuing debate.
This debate heated up in the early years of Barack Obama’s presidency. In 2008 
and 2009, the U.S. economy, as well as many other economies around the world, 
experienced a deep economic downturn. Problems in the financial system, caused 
by bad bets on the housing market, spilled over into the rest of the economy, 
causing incomes to fall and unemployment to soar. Policymakers responded in 
various ways to increase the overall demand for goods and services. President 
Obama’s first major initiative was a stimulus package of reduced taxes and in-
creased government spending. At the same time, the nation’s central bank, the 
Federal Reserve, increased the supply of money. The goal of these policies was to 
reduce unemployment. Some feared, however, that these policies might over time 
lead to an excessive level of inflation.

You now have a taste of what economics is all about. In the coming chapters, we de-
velop many specific insights about people, markets, and economies. Mastering these 
insights will take some effort, but it is not an overwhelming task. The field of eco-
nomics is based on a few big ideas that can be applied in many different situations.
Throughout this book, we will refer back to the Ten Principles of Economics high-
lighted in this chapter and summarized in Table 1. Keep these building blocks in 
mind: Even the most sophisticated economic analysis is founded on the ten prin-
ciples introduced here.

•	
The fundamental lessons about individual decision 
making are that people face trade-offs among alterna-
tive goals, that the cost of any action is measured in 
terms of forgone opportunities, that rational people 
make decisions by comparing marginal costs and mar-
ginal benefits, and that people change their behavior in 
response to the incentives they face.
•	
The fundamental lessons about interactions among 
people are that trade and interdependence can be mu-
tually beneficial, that markets are usually a good way 
of coordinating economic activity among people, and 
that the government can potentially improve market 
outcomes by remedying a market failure or by promot-
ing greater economic equality.
•	
The fundamental lessons about the economy as a 
whole are that productivity is the ultimate source 
of living standards, that growth in the quantity of 
money is the ultimate source of inflation, and that so-
ciety faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and 
unemployment.

10.	 In what ways is your standard of living different from 
that of your parents or grandparents when they were 
your age? Why have these changes occurred?
11.	 Suppose Americans decide to save more of their in-

Economics is no different. Supply, demand, elasticity, comparative advantage,

PART I	
INTRODUCTION
a combination of theory, case studies, and examples of economics in the news, this 
book will give you ample opportunity to develop and practice this skill.
Before delving into the substance and details of economics, it is helpful to have 
an overview of how economists approach the world. This chapter discusses the 
field’s methodology. What is distinctive about how economists confront a ques-
tion? What does it mean to think like an economist?
2-1 The Economist as Scientist
Economists try to address their subject with a scientist’s objectivity. They ap-
proach the study of the economy in much the same way a physicist approaches 
the study of matter and a biologist approaches the study of life: They devise theo-
ries, collect data, and then analyze these data in an attempt to verify or refute 
their theories.
To beginners, the claim that economics is a science can seem odd. After all, 
economists do not work with test tubes or telescopes. The essence of science, 
however, is the scientific method—the dispassionate development and testing of 
theories about how the world works. This method of inquiry is as applicable to 
studying a nation’s economy as it is to studying the earth’s gravity or a species’ 
evolution. As Albert Einstein once put it, “The whole of science is nothing more 
than the refinement of everyday thinking.”
Although Einstein’s comment is as true for social sciences such as econom-
ics as it is for natural sciences such as physics, most people are not accustomed 
to looking at society through a scientific lens. Let’s discuss some of the ways 
in which economists apply the logic of science to examine how an economy 
works.
2-1a The Scientific Method: Observation, 
Theory, and More Observation
Isaac Newton, the famous 17th-century scientist and mathematician, allegedly be-
came intrigued one day when he saw an apple fall from a tree. This observation 
motivated Newton to develop a theory of gravity that applies not only to an apple 
falling to the earth but to any two objects in the universe. Subsequent testing of 
Newton’s theory has shown that it works well in many circumstances (although, 
as Einstein would later emphasize, not in all circumstances). Because Newton’s 
theory has been so successful at explaining observation, it is still taught in under-
graduate physics courses around the world.
This interplay between theory and observation also occurs in economics. An 
economist might live in a country experiencing rapidly increasing prices and be 
moved by this observation to develop a theory of inflation. The theory might 
assert that high inflation arises when the government prints too much money. 
To test this theory, the economist could collect and analyze data on prices and 
money from many different countries. If growth in the quantity of money were 
completely unrelated to the rate of price increase, the economist would start to 
doubt the validity of this theory of inflation. If money growth and inflation were 
strongly correlated in international data, as in fact they are, the economist would 
become more confident in the theory.
Although economists use theory and observation like other scientists, they face 
an obstacle that makes their task especially challenging: In economics, conducting 
“I’m a social scientist, 
­Michael. That means 
I can’t explain electricity 
or ­anything like that, but if 
you ever want to know 
about people, I’m your man.”

experiments is often impractical. Physicists studying gravity can drop many ob-
jects in their laboratories to generate data to test their theories. By contrast, econo-
mists studying inflation are not allowed to manipulate a nation’s monetary policy 
simply to generate useful data. Economists, like astronomers and evolutionary 
biologists, usually have to make do with whatever data the world happens to 
give them.
To find a substitute for laboratory experiments, economists pay close atten-
tion to the natural experiments offered by history. When a war in the Middle 
East interrupts the flow of crude oil, for instance, oil prices skyrocket around 
the world. For consumers of oil and oil products, such an event depresses living 
standards. For economic policymakers, it poses a difficult choice about how best 
to respond. But for economic scientists, the event provides an opportunity to 
study the effects of a key natural resource on the world’s economies. Through-
out this book, therefore, we consider many historical episodes. These episodes 
are valuable to study because they give us insight into the economy of the past 
and, more important, because they allow us to illustrate and evaluate economic 
theories of the present.
2-1b The Role of Assumptions
If you ask a physicist how long it would take a marble to fall from the top of a 
ten-story building, he will likely answer the question by assuming that the marble 
falls in a vacuum. Of course, this assumption is false. In fact, the building is sur-
rounded by air, which exerts friction on the falling marble and slows it down. Yet 
the physicist will point out that the friction on the marble is so small that its effect 
is negligible. Assuming the marble falls in a vacuum simplifies the problem with-
out substantially affecting the answer.
Economists make assumptions for the same reason: Assumptions can simplify 
the complex world and make it easier to understand. To study the effects of inter-
national trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists of only two 
countries and that each country produces only two goods. In reality, there are nu-
merous countries, each of which produces thousands of different types of goods. 
But by considering a world with only two countries and two goods, we can focus 
our thinking on the essence of the problem. Once we understand international 
trade in this simplified imaginary world, we are in a better position to understand 
international trade in the more complex world in which we live.
The art in scientific thinking—whether in physics, biology, or economics—is 
deciding which assumptions to make. Suppose, for instance, that instead of drop-
ping a marble from the top of the building, we were dropping a beach ball of the 
same weight. Our physicist would realize that the assumption of no friction is 
less accurate in this case: Friction exerts a greater force on a beach ball than on a 
marble because a beach ball is much larger. The assumption that gravity works in 
a vacuum is reasonable for studying a falling marble but not for studying a falling 
beach ball.
Similarly, economists use different assumptions to answer different questions. 
Suppose that we want to study what happens to the economy when the govern-
ment changes the number of dollars in circulation. An important piece of this 
analysis, it turns out, is how prices respond. Many prices in the economy change 
infrequently; the newsstand prices of magazines, for instance, change only once 
every few years. Knowing this fact may lead us to make different assumptions 
when studying the effects of the policy change over different time horizons. For 
studying the short-run effects of the policy, we may assume that prices do not

INTRODUCTION
change much. We may even make the extreme and artificial assumption that all 
prices are completely fixed. For studying the long-run effects of the policy, how-
ever, we may assume that all prices are completely flexible. Just as a physicist 
uses different assumptions when studying falling marbles and falling beach balls, 
economists use different assumptions when studying the short-run and long-run 
effects of a change in the quantity of money.
2-1c Economic Models
High school biology teachers teach basic anatomy with plastic replicas of the hu-
man body. These models have all the major organs—the heart, the liver, the kid-
neys, and so on—which allow teachers to show their students very simply how 
the important parts of the body fit together. Because these plastic models are styl-
ized and omit many details, no one would mistake one of them for a real person. 
Despite this lack of realism—indeed, because of this lack of realism—studying 
these models is useful for learning how the human body works.
Economists also use models to learn about the world, but unlike plastic mani-
kins, their models mostly consist of diagrams and equations. Like a biology teach-
er’s plastic model, economic models omit many details to allow us to see what 
is truly important. Just as the biology teacher’s model does not include all the 
body’s muscles and capillaries, an economist’s model does not include every fea-
ture of the economy.
As we use models to examine various economic issues throughout this book, 
you will see that all the models are built with assumptions. Just as a physicist 
begins the analysis of a falling marble by assuming away the existence of fric-
tion, economists assume away many of the details of the economy that are ir-
relevant for studying the question at hand. All models—in physics, biology, and 
­economics—simplify reality to improve our understanding of it.
2-1d Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram
The economy consists of millions of people engaged in many activities—­buying, 
selling, working, hiring, manufacturing, and so on. To understand how the econ-
omy works, we must find some way to simplify our thinking about all these 
­activities. In other words, we need a model that explains, in general terms, how 
the economy is organized and how participants in the economy interact with one 
another.
Figure 1 presents a visual model of the economy called a circular-flow diagram. 
In this model, the economy is simplified to include only two types of decision 
makers—firms and households. Firms produce goods and services using inputs, 
such as labor, land, and capital (buildings and machines). These inputs are called 
the factors of production. Households own the factors of production and consume 
all the goods and services that the firms produce.
Households and firms interact in two types of markets. In the markets for goods 
and services, households are buyers, and firms are sellers. In particular, households 
buy the output of goods and services that firms produce. In the markets for the fac-
tors of production, households are sellers, and firms are buyers. In these markets, 
households provide the inputs that firms use to produce goods and services. The 
circular-flow diagram offers a simple way of organizing the economic transac-
tions that occur between households and firms in the economy.
The two loops of the circular-flow diagram are distinct but related. The in-
ner loop represents the flows of inputs and outputs. The households sell the 
use of their labor, land, and capital to the firms in the markets for the factors of

production. The firms then use these factors to produce goods and services, which 
in turn are sold to households in the markets for goods and services. The outer 
loop of the diagram represents the corresponding flow of dollars. The households 
spend money to buy goods and services from the firms. The firms use some of the 
revenue from these sales to pay for the factors of production, such as the wages 
of their workers. What’s left is the profit of the firm owners, who themselves are 
members of households.
Let’s take a tour of the circular flow by following a dollar bill as it makes its 
way from person to person through the economy. Imagine that the dollar begins 
at a household, say, in your wallet. If you want to buy a cup of coffee, you take 
the dollar to one of the economy’s markets for goods and services, such as your 
local Starbucks coffee shop. There, you spend it on your favorite drink. When the 
dollar moves into the Starbucks cash register, it becomes revenue for the firm. The 
dollar doesn’t stay at Starbucks for long, however, because the firm uses it to buy 
inputs in the markets for the factors of production. Starbucks might use the dol-
lar to pay rent to its landlord for the space it occupies or to pay the wages of its 
workers. In either case, the dollar enters the income of some household and, once 
again, is back in someone’s wallet. At that point, the story of the economy’s circu-
lar flow starts once again.
The circular-flow diagram in Figure 1 is a very simple model of the economy. 
It dispenses with details that, for some purposes, are significant. A more complex 
and realistic circular-flow model would include, for instance, the roles of gov-
ernment and international trade. (A portion of that dollar you gave to Starbucks 
might be used to pay taxes or to buy coffee beans from a farmer in Brazil.) Yet

INTRODUCTION
these details are not crucial for a basic understanding of how the economy is or-
ganized. Because of its simplicity, this circular-flow diagram is useful to keep in 
mind when thinking about how the pieces of the economy fit together.
2-1e Our Second Model: The Production 
Possibilities Frontier
Most economic models, unlike the circular-flow diagram, are built using the tools 
of mathematics. Here we use one of the simplest such models, called the produc-
tion possibilities frontier, to illustrate some basic economic ideas.
Although real economies produce thousands of goods and services, let’s con-
sider an economy that produces only two goods—cars and computers. Together, 
the car industry and the computer industry use all of the economy’s factors of 
production. The production possibilities frontier is a graph that shows the vari-
ous combinations of output—in this case, cars and computers—that the economy 
can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available 
production technology that firms use to turn these factors into output.
Figure 2 shows this economy’s production possibilities frontier. If the economy 
uses all its resources in the car industry, it produces 1,000 cars and no computers. 
If it uses all its resources in the computer industry, it produces 3,000 computers 
and no cars. The two endpoints of the production possibilities frontier represent 
these extreme possibilities.
More likely, the economy divides its resources between the two industries, pro-
ducing some cars and some computers. For example, it can produce 600 cars and 
2,200 computers, as shown in Figure 2 by point A. Or, by moving some of the fac-
tors of production to the car industry from the computer industry, the economy 
can produce 700 cars and 2,000 computers, represented by point B.

The Production Possibilities Frontier
The production possibilities frontier shows 
the combinations of output—in this case,

produce any combination on or inside the 
frontier. Points outside the frontier are not 
feasible given the economy’s resources. 
The slope of the production possibilities 
frontier measures the opportunity cost 
of a car in terms of computers. This 
­opportunity cost varies, depending on how 
much of the two goods the economy is 
producing.

CHAPTER 2  THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

Because resources are scarce, not every conceivable outcome is feasible. For ex-
ample, no matter how resources are allocated between the two industries, the econ-
omy cannot produce the amount of cars and computers represented by point C.  
Given the technology available for manufacturing cars and computers, the econ-
omy does not have enough of the factors of production to support that level of 
output. With the resources it has, the economy can produce at any point on or 
inside the production possibilities frontier, but it cannot produce at points outside 
the frontier.
An outcome is said to be efficient if the economy is getting all it can from 
the scarce resources it has available. Points on (rather than inside) the produc-
tion possibilities frontier represent efficient levels of production. When the 
economy is producing at such a point, say point A, there is no way to produce 
more of one good without producing less of the other. Point D represents an 
inefficient outcome. For some reason, perhaps widespread unemployment, the 
economy is producing less than it could from the resources it has available: It 
is producing only 300 cars and 1,000 computers. If the source of the inefficiency 
is eliminated, the economy can increase its production of both goods. For ex-
ample, if the economy moves from point D to point A, its production of cars 
increases from 300 to 600, and its production of computers increases from 1,000 
to 2,200.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face 
trade-offs. The production possibilities frontier shows one trade-off that society 
faces. Once we have reached an efficient point on the frontier, the only way of 
producing more of one good is to produce less of the other. When the economy 
moves from point A to point B, for instance, society produces 100 more cars but at 
the expense of producing 200 fewer computers.
This trade-off helps us understand another of the Ten Principles of Economics: 
The cost of something is what you give up to get it. This is called the opportunity 
cost. The production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost of one good 
as measured in terms of the other good. When society moves from point A to 
point B, it gives up 200 computers to get 100 additional cars. That is, at point A, 
the opportunity cost of 100 cars is 200 computers. Put another way, the oppor-
tunity cost of each car is two computers. Notice that the opportunity cost of a 
car equals the slope of the production possibilities frontier. (If you don’t recall 
what slope is, you can refresh your memory with the graphing appendix to this 
chapter.)
The opportunity cost of a car in terms of the number of computers is not con-
stant in this economy but depends on how many cars and computers the economy 
is producing. This is reflected in the shape of the production possibilities frontier. 
Because the production possibilities frontier in Figure 2 is bowed outward, the 
opportunity cost of a car is highest when the economy is producing many cars 
and few computers, such as at point E, where the frontier is steep. When the econ-
omy is producing few cars and many computers, such as at point F, the frontier is 
flatter, and the opportunity cost of a car is lower.
Economists believe that production possibilities frontiers often have this 
bowed shape. When the economy is using most of its resources to make comput-
ers, such as at point F, the resources best suited to car production, such as skilled 
autoworkers, are being used in the computer industry. Because these workers 
probably aren’t very good at making computers, increasing car production by 
one unit will cause only a slight reduction in the number of computers produced.

At point F, the opportunity cost of a car in terms of computers is small, and the 
frontier is relatively flat. By contrast, when the economy is using most of its re-
sources to make cars, such as at point E, the resources best suited to making cars 
are already at work in the car industry. Producing an additional car means mov-
ing some of the best computer technicians out of the computer industry and turn-
ing them into autoworkers. As a result, producing an additional car will mean a 
substantial loss of computer output. The opportunity cost of a car is high, and the 
frontier is steep.
The production possibilities frontier shows the trade-off between the outputs 
of different goods at a given time, but the trade-off can change over time. For 
example, suppose a technological advance in the computer industry raises the 
number of computers that a worker can produce per week. This advance expands 
society’s set of opportunities. For any given number of cars, the economy can now 
make more computers. If the economy does not produce any computers, it can 
still produce 1,000 cars, so one endpoint of the frontier stays the same. But if the 
economy devotes some of its resources to the computer industry, it will produce 
more computers from those resources. As a result, the production possibilities 
frontier shifts outward, as in Figure 3.
This figure illustrates what happens when an economy grows. Society can 
move production from a point on the old frontier to a point on the new frontier. 
Which point it chooses depends on its preferences for the two goods. In this ex-
ample, society moves from point A to point G, enjoying more computers (2,300 
instead of 2,200) and more cars (650 instead of 600).
The production possibilities frontier simplifies a complex economy to highlight 
some basic but powerful ideas: scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity cost, 
and economic growth. As you study economics, these ideas will recur in vari-
ous forms. The production possibilities frontier offers one simple way of thinking 
about them.

to produce more computers for any 
given number of cars. As a result, 
the production possibilities frontier 
shifts outward. If the economy moves 
from point A to point G, then the pro-
duction of both cars and computers 
increases.

2-1f Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
Many subjects are studied on various levels. Consider biology, for example. Mo-
lecular biologists study the chemical compounds that make up living things. Cel-
lular biologists study cells, which are made up of many chemical compounds and, 
at the same time, are themselves the building blocks of living organisms. Evolu-
tionary biologists study the many varieties of animals and plants and how species 
change gradually over the centuries.
Economics is also studied on various levels. We can study the decisions of indi-
vidual households and firms. Or we can study the interaction of households and 
firms in markets for specific goods and services. Or we can study the operation 
of the economy as a whole, which is the sum of the activities of all these decision 
makers in all these markets.
The field of economics is traditionally divided into two broad subfields.  
Microeconomics is the study of how households and firms make decisions and 
how they interact in specific markets. Macroeconomics is the study of economy-
wide phenomena. A microeconomist might study the effects of rent control on 
housing in New York City, the impact of foreign competition on the U.S. auto 
industry, or the effects of compulsory school attendance on workers’ earnings. 
A macroeconomist might study the effects of borrowing by the federal govern-
ment, the changes over time in the economy’s rate of unemployment, or alterna-
tive policies to promote growth in national living standards.
Microeconomics and macroeconomics are closely intertwined. Because 
changes in the overall economy arise from the decisions of millions of indi-
viduals, it is impossible to understand macroeconomic developments without 
considering the associated microeconomic decisions. For example, a macro-
economist might study the effect of a federal income tax cut on the overall pro-
duction of goods and services. But to analyze this issue, he must consider how 
the tax cut affects households’ decisions about how much to spend on goods 
and services.
Despite the inherent link between microeconomics and macroeconomics, the 
two fields are distinct. Because they address different questions, each field has its 
own set of models, which are often taught in separate courses.

2-2 The Economist as Policy Adviser
Often, economists are asked to explain the causes of economic events. Why, 
for example, is unemployment higher for teenagers than for older workers? 
Sometimes, economists are asked to recommend policies to improve economic 
outcomes. What, for instance, should the government do to improve the eco-
nomic well-being of teenagers? When economists are trying to explain the 
world, they are scientists. When they are trying to help improve it, they are 
policy advisers.

INTRODUCTION
2-2a Positive versus Normative Analysis
To help clarify the two roles that economists play, let’s examine the use of lan-
guage. Because scientists and policy advisers have different goals, they use lan-
guage in different ways.
For example, suppose that two people are discussing minimum-wage laws. 
Here are two statements you might hear:
	Polly:	  Minimum-wage laws cause unemployment.
	Norm:	  The government should raise the minimum wage.
Ignoring for now whether you agree with these statements, notice that Polly 
and Norm differ in what they are trying to do. Polly is speaking like a scien-
tist: She is making a claim about how the world works. Norm is speaking like 
a policy adviser: He is making a claim about how he would like to change the 
world.
In general, statements about the world come in two types. One type, such as 
Polly’s, is positive. Positive statements are descriptive. They make a claim about 
how the world is. A second type of statement, such as Norm’s, is normative. 
Normative statements are prescriptive. They make a claim about how the world 
ought to be.
A key difference between positive and normative statements is how we judge 
their validity. We can, in principle, confirm or refute positive statements by exam-
ining evidence. An economist might evaluate Polly’s statement by analyzing data 
on changes in minimum wages and changes in unemployment over time. By con-
trast, evaluating normative statements involves values as well as facts. Norm’s 
statement cannot be judged using data alone. Deciding what is good or bad policy 
is not just a matter of science. It also involves our views on ethics, religion, and 
political philosophy.
Positive and normative statements are fundamentally different, but they are of-
ten intertwined in a person’s set of beliefs. In particular, positive views about how 
the world works affect normative views about what policies are desirable. Polly’s 
claim that the minimum wage causes unemployment, if true, might lead her to 
reject Norm’s conclusion that the government should raise the minimum wage. 
Yet normative conclusions cannot come from positive analysis alone; they involve 
value judgments as well.
As you study economics, keep in mind the distinction between positive and 
normative statements because it will help you stay focused on the task at hand. 
Much of economics is positive: It just tries to explain how the economy works. Yet 
those who use economics often have normative goals: They want to learn how to 
improve the economy. When you hear economists making normative statements, 
you know they are speaking not as scientists but as policy advisers.
2-2b Economists in Washington
President Harry Truman once said that he wanted to find a one-armed economist. 
When he asked his economists for advice, they always answered, “On the one 
hand, . . . . On the other hand, . . . .“
Truman was right in realizing that economists’ advice is not always straight-
forward. This tendency is rooted in one of the Ten Principles of Economics: People 
face trade-offs. Economists are aware that trade-offs are involved in most pol-
icy decisions. A policy might increase efficiency at the cost of equality. It might 
help future generations but hurt current generations. An economist who says 
that all policy decisions are easy or clear-cut is an economist not to be trusted.

CHAPTER 2  THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

Truman was not the only president who relied on the advice of economists. 
Since 1946, the president of the United States has received guidance from the 
Council of Economic Advisers, which consists of three members and a staff of 
a few dozen economists. The council, whose offices are just a few steps from the 
White House, has no duty other than to advise the president and to write the an-
nual Economic Report of the President, which discusses recent developments in the 
economy and presents the council’s analysis of current policy issues.
The president also receives input from economists in many administrative 
departments. Economists at the Office of Management and Budget help formu-
late spending plans and regulatory policies. Economists at the Department of 
the Treasury help design tax policy. Economists at the Department of Labor ana-
lyze data on workers and those looking for work to help formulate labor-market 
policies. Economists at the Department of Justice help enforce the nation’s anti-
trust laws.
Economists are also found outside the administrative branch of government. 
To obtain independent evaluations of policy proposals, Congress relies on the 
advice of the Congressional Budget Office, which is staffed by economists. The 
Federal Reserve, the institution that sets the nation’s monetary policy, employs 
hundreds of economists to analyze economic developments in the United States 
and throughout the world.
The influence of economists on policy goes beyond their role as advisers: Their 
research and writings often affect policy indirectly. Economist John Maynard 
Keynes offered this observation:
The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right 
and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. 
Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves 
to be quite exempt from intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some 
defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distill-
ing their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.
These words were written in 1935, but they remain true today. Indeed, the  
“academic scribbler” now influencing public policy is often Keynes himself.
2-2c Why Economists’ Advice Is Not 
Always Followed
Any economist who advises presidents or other elected leaders knows that his 
recommendations are not always heeded. Frustrating as this can be, it is easy to 
understand. The process by which economic policy is actually made differs in 
many ways from the idealized policy process assumed in economics textbooks.
Throughout this text, whenever we discuss economic policy, we often focus on 
one question: What is the best policy for the government to pursue? We act as if 
policy were set by a benevolent king. Once the king figures out the right policy, he 
has no trouble putting his ideas into action.
In the real world, figuring out the right policy is only part of a leader’s job, 
sometimes the easiest part. After a president hears from his economic advisers 
about what policy is best from their perspective, he turns to other advisers for 
related input. His communications advisers will tell him how best to explain the 
proposed policy to the public, and they will try to anticipate any misunderstand-
ings that might make the challenge more difficult. His press advisers will tell him 
how the news media will report on his proposal and what opinions will likely 
be expressed on the nation’s editorial pages. His legislative affairs advisers will 
“Let’s switch. I’ll make the 
policy, you implement it, 
and he’ll explain it.”

INTRODUCTION
tell him how Congress will view the proposal, what amendments members of 
­Congress will suggest, and the likelihood that Congress will pass some version of 
the president’s proposal into law. His political advisers will tell him which groups 
will organize to support or oppose the proposed policy, how this proposal will 
affect his standing among different groups in the electorate, and whether it will 
affect support for any of the president’s other policy initiatives. After hearing and 
weighing all this advice, the president then decides how to proceed.
Making economic policy in a representative democracy is a messy affair—and 
there are often good reasons why presidents (and other politicians) do not ad-
vance the policies that economists advocate. Economists offer crucial input into 
the policy process, but their advice is only one ingredient of a complex recipe.
Quick Quiz  Give an example of a positive statement and an example of a normative 
statement that somehow relates to your daily life. • Name three parts of government that 
regularly rely on advice from economists.
2-3 Why Economists Disagree
“If all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion.” This 
quip from George Bernard Shaw is revealing. Economists as a group are often 
criticized for giving conflicting advice to policymakers. President Ronald Reagan 
once joked that if the game Trivial Pursuit were designed for economists, it would 
have 100 questions and 3,000 answers.
Why do economists so often appear to give conflicting advice to policymakers? 
There are two basic reasons:
•	 Economists may disagree about the validity of alternative positive theories 
about how the world works.
•	 Economists may have different values and therefore different normative views 
about what government policy should aim to accomplish.
Let’s discuss each of these reasons.
2-3a Differences in Scientific Judgments
Several centuries ago, astronomers debated whether the earth or the sun was at 
the center of the solar system. More recently, meteorologists have debated whether 
the earth is experiencing global warming and, if so, why. Science is an ongoing 
search to understand the world around us. It is not surprising that as the search 
continues, scientists sometimes disagree about the direction in which truth lies.
Economists often disagree for the same reason. Economics is a young science, 
and there is still much to be learned. Economists sometimes disagree because 
they have different hunches about the validity of alternative theories or about the 
size of important parameters that measure how economic variables are related.
For example, economists disagree about whether the government should tax a 
household’s income or its consumption (spending). Advocates of a switch from 
the current income tax to a consumption tax believe that the change would en-
courage households to save more because income that is saved would not be 
taxed. Higher saving, in turn, would free resources for capital accumulation, 
leading to more rapid growth in productivity and living standards. Advocates of 
the current income tax system believe that household saving would not respond

much to a change in the tax laws. These two groups of economists hold different 
normative views about the tax system because they have different positive views 
about saving’s responsiveness to tax incentives.
2-3b Differences in Values
Suppose that Peter and Paula both take the same amount of water from the town 
well. To pay for maintaining the well, the town taxes its residents. Peter has in-
come of $100,000 and is taxed $10,000, or 10  percent of his income. Paula has in-
come of $20,000 and is taxed $4,000, or 20  percent of her income.
Is this policy fair? If not, who pays too much and who pays too little? Does it 
matter whether Paula’s low income is due to a medical disability or to her deci-
sion to pursue an acting career? Does it matter whether Peter’s high income is due 
to a large inheritance or to his willingness to work long hours at a dreary job?
These are difficult questions on which people are likely to disagree. If the town 
hired two experts to study how the town should tax its residents to pay for the 
well, we would not be surprised if they offered conflicting advice.
This simple example shows why economists sometimes disagree about public 
policy. As we know from our discussion of normative and positive analysis, poli-
cies cannot be judged on scientific grounds alone. Sometimes, economists give 
conflicting advice because they have different values. Perfecting the science of 
economics will not tell us whether Peter or Paula pays too much.
2-3c Perception versus Reality
Because of differences in scientific judgments and differences in values, some 
disagreement among economists is inevitable. Yet one should not overstate the 
amount of disagreement. Economists agree with one another to a much greater 
extent than is sometimes understood.
Table 1 contains twenty propositions about economic policy. In surveys of pro-
fessional economists, these propositions were endorsed by an overwhelming ma-
jority of respondents. Most of these propositions would fail to command a similar 
consensus among the public.
The first proposition in the table is about rent control, a policy that sets a legal 
maximum on the amount landlords can charge for their apartments. Almost all 
economists believe that rent control adversely affects the availability and quality 
of housing and is a costly way of helping the neediest members of society. None-
theless, many city governments ignore the advice of economists and place ceilings 
on the rents that landlords may charge their tenants.
The second proposition in the table concerns tariffs and import quotas, two 
policies that restrict trade among nations. For reasons we discuss more fully later 
in this text, almost all economists oppose such barriers to free trade. Nonetheless, 
over the years, presidents and Congress have chosen to restrict the import of cer-
tain goods.
Why do policies such as rent control and trade barriers persist if the experts 
are united in their opposition? It may be that the realities of the political process 
stand as immovable obstacles. But it also may be that economists have not yet 
convinced enough of the public that these policies are undesirable. One purpose 
of this book is to help you understand the economist’s view of these and other 
subjects and, perhaps, to persuade you that it is the right one.

Actual Economists and 
Virtual Realities
For professional economists, video games may be the next frontier.
The Economics of  
Video Games
By Brad Plumer

nflation can be a headache for any central 
banker. But it takes a certain type of econo-
mist to know what to do when a belligerent 
spaceship fleet attacks an interstellar trading 
post, causing mineral prices to surge across 
the galaxy.
Eyjólfur Guðmundsson is just that econo-
mist. Working for the Icelandic company CCP 
Games, he oversees the virtual economy of 
the massively multiplayer video game Eve On-
line. Within this world, players build their own 
spaceships and traverse a galaxy of 7,500 
star systems. They buy and sell raw materi-
als, creating their own fluctuating markets. 
They speculate on commodities. They form 
trade coalitions and banks.
It’s a sprawling economy, with more than 
400,000 players participating in its virtual 
market—more people, in fact, than live in 
Iceland. Inflation, deflation and even reces-
sions can occur. Which is why, from his of-
fice in Reykjavik, Guðmundsson leads a 
team of eight analysts poring over reams of 
data to make sure everything in Eve Online 
is running smoothly. His job bears more than 
a passing resemblance to that of Ben Ber-
nanke, who oversees the U.S. economy from 
the Federal Reserve.
“For all intents and purposes, this is an 
economy that has activity equal to a small 
country in real life,” Guðmundsson says. 
“There’s nothing ‘virtual’ about this world.”
Nowadays, many massively multiplayer 
online video games have become so complex 
that game companies are turning to econo-
mists for help. Without oversight, the games’ 
economies can go badly awry—as when a 
gambling ban triggered a virtual bank run in 
the online world of Second Life in 2007, with 
one bank alone costing players $750,000 in 
real-life money.
But there’s a flip side, too. Just as video 
game designers are in dire need of economic 
advice, many academic economists are keen 
on studying video games. A virtual world, 
after all, allows economists to study con-
cepts that rarely occur in real life, such as 
full-reserve banking, a popular libertarian 
alternative to the current banking system that 
cropped up in Eve Online. The data is richer. 
And it’s easier to run economy-wide experi-
ments in a video game—experiments that, 
for obvious reasons, can’t be run on countries.
That ability to experiment on a massive 
scale, academics say, could revolutionize 
economics.
“Economic theory has come to a dead 
end—the last real breakthroughs were in 
the 1960s,” says Yanis Varoufakis, a Greek 
economist recently hired by the video-game 
company Valve. “But that’s not because we 
stopped being clever. We came up against 
a hard barrier. The future is going to be in 
experimentation and simulation—and video 
game communities give us a chance to do 
all that.”
At least, that’s the dream. The real-
ity, as always, is more complicated. Game 
companies are often wary of meddling 
economists trying to conduct experiments 
that suck the fun out of their virtual worlds. 
And some academics scoff at the notion 
that there’s anything to learn from uni-
verses filled with warlocks and starfleets. 
Game companies and economists may need 
each other. Now if only they could learn to 
share the controller.
In June, Varoufakis announced on his blog 
that he had been hired as an in-house econo-
mist by Valve, the maker of the popular Half-
Life games. Varoufakis wasn’t an obscure 
number-cruncher. From his perch at the Uni-
versity of Athens, he had become famous for 
his trenchant analyses of Greece’s debt woes 
and the euro crisis.
It was clear why Valve was interested. 
The company oversees a network of games 
such as Team Fortress 2 that run on its online 
gaming platform, called Steam.
Valve wanted to link different Steam 
games together so players could trade virtual 
items. As Gabe Newell, the chief executive 
of Valve, explained in an e-mail to Varoufa-
kis: “We are discussing an issue of linking 
economies in two virtual environments (cre-
ating a shared currency), and wrestling with 
some of the thornier problems of balance of 
payments.”
Whom better to ask, Newell figured, than 
an expert on the difficulties that Germany and 
Greece faced after joining the euro?
To date, only two companies—CCP and 
Valve—have gone so far as to hire in-house 
economists. But several academics who study 
virtual worlds say they have consulted with 
game designers.
“If you’re creating a game with 100,000 
users, with things that they can buy and sell, 
you need an economist just to help you tweak 
that system so that it doesn’t spin out of 
control,” says Robert Bloomfield, an econo-
mist who studies virtual worlds at Cornell’s 
Johnson School of Management.

INTRODUCTION
2-4 Let’s Get Going
•	
Economists try to address their subject with a scien-
tist’s objectivity. Like all scientists, they make appro-
priate assumptions and build simplified models to 
understand the world around them. Two simple eco-
nomic models are the circular-flow diagram and the 
production possibilities frontier.
•	
The field of economics is divided into two subfields: 
microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microecono-
mists study decision making by households and firms 
and the interaction among households and firms in the 
marketplace. Macroeconomists study the forces and 
trends that affect the economy as a whole.
•	
A positive statement is an assertion about how the 
world is. A normative statement is an assertion about 
how the world ought to be. When economists make nor-
mative statements, they are acting more as policy ad-
visers than as scientists.
•	
Economists who advise policymakers sometimes offer 
conflicting advice either because of differences in sci-
entific judgments or because of differences in values. 
At other times, economists are united in the advice 
they offer, but policymakers may choose to ignore the 
advice because of the many forces and constraints im-
posed by the political process.

Key Concepts
The first two chapters of this book have introduced you to the ideas and methods 
of economics. We are now ready to get to work. In the next chapter, we start learn-
ing in more detail the principles of economic behavior and economic policy.
As you proceed through this book, you will be asked to draw on many of your 
intellectual skills. You might find it helpful to keep in mind some advice from the 
great economist John Maynard Keynes:
The study of economics does not seem to require any specialized gifts of an 
unusually high order. Is it not … a very easy subject compared with the higher 
branches of philosophy or pure science? An easy subject, at which very few 
excel! The paradox finds its explanation, perhaps, in that the master-economist 
must possess a rare combination of gifts. He must be mathematician, historian, 
statesman, philosopher—in some degree. He must understand symbols and 
speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, 
and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study 
the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of 
man’s nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside his regard. He must be 
purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood; as aloof and incorrupt-
ible as an artist, yet sometimes as near the earth as a politician.
This is a tall order. But with practice, you will become more and more accustomed 
to thinking like an economist.

Graphing: A Brief Review
Many of the concepts that economists study can be expressed with numbers—the 
price of bananas, the quantity of bananas sold, the cost of growing bananas, and 
so on. Often, these economic variables are related to one another: When the price 
of bananas rises, people buy fewer bananas. One way of expressing the relation-
ships among variables is with graphs.
Graphs serve two purposes. First, when developing economic theories, graphs 
offer a way to visually express ideas that might be less clear if described with 
equations or words. Second, when analyzing economic data, graphs provide a 
powerful way of finding and interpreting patterns. Whether we are working with 
theory or with data, graphs provide a lens through which a recognizable forest 
emerges from a multitude of trees.
Numerical information can be expressed graphically in many ways, just as 
there are many ways to express a thought in words. A good writer chooses words 
that will make an argument clear, a description pleasing, or a scene dramatic. An 
effective economist chooses the type of graph that best suits the purpose at hand.
In this appendix, we discuss how economists use graphs to study the mathe­
matical relationships among variables. We also discuss some of the pitfalls that 
can arise in the use of graphical methods.
Graphs of a Single Variable
Three common graphs are shown in Figure A-1. The pie chart in panel (a) shows 
how total income in the United States is divided among the sources of income, 
including compensation of employees, corporate profits, and so on. A slice of 
the pie represents each source’s share of the total. The bar graph in panel (b) com-
pares income for four countries. The height of each bar represents the average

income in each country. The time-series graph in panel (c) traces the rising pro-
ductivity in the U.S. business sector over time. The height of the line shows out-
put per hour in each year. You have probably seen similar graphs in newspapers 
and magazines.
Graphs of Two Variables: The Coordinate System
The three graphs in Figure A-1 are useful in showing how a variable changes 
over time or across individuals, but they are limited in how much they can tell us. 
These graphs display information only about a single variable. Economists are 
often concerned with the relationships between variables. Thus, they need to dis-
play two variables on a single graph. The coordinate system makes this possible.
Suppose you want to examine the relationship between study time and grade 
point average. For each student in your class, you could record a pair of numbers: 
hours per week spent studying and grade point average. These numbers could 
then be placed in parentheses as an ordered pair and appear as a single point on 
the graph. Albert E., for instance, is represented by the ordered pair (25 hours/
week, 3.5 GPA), while his “what-me-worry?” classmate Alfred E. is represented 
by the ordered pair (5 hours/week, 2.0 GPA).
We can graph these ordered pairs on a two-dimensional grid. The first num-
ber in each ordered pair, called the x-coordinate, tells us the horizontal location 
of the point. The second number, called the y-coordinate, tells us the vertical loca-
tion of the point. The point with both an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate of zero 
is known as the origin. The two coordinates in the ordered pair tell us where the 
point is located in relation to the origin: x units to the right of the origin and y 
units above it.
Figure A-2 graphs grade point average against study time for Albert E., Alfred E.,  
and their classmates. This type of graph is called a scatterplot because it plots scat-
tered points. Looking at this graph, we immediately notice that points farther to 
the right (indicating more study time) also tend to be higher (indicating a better 
grade point average). Because study time and grade point average typically move 
in the same direction, we say that these two variables have a positive correlation. 
FIGURE A-2
Using the Coordinate System
Grade point average is measured 
on the vertical axis and study time 
on the horizontal axis. Albert E., 
Alfred E., and their classmates are 
represented by various points. We 
can see from the graph that students 
who study more tend to get higher 
grades.

By contrast, if we were to graph party time and grades, we would likely find that 
higher party time is associated with lower grades; because these variables typi-
cally move in opposite directions, we say that they have a negative correlation. In 
either case, the coordinate system makes the correlation between the two vari-
ables easy to see.
Curves in the Coordinate System
Students who study more do tend to get higher grades, but other factors also 
influence a student’s grades. Previous preparation is an important factor, for in-
stance, as are talent, attention from teachers, even eating a good breakfast. A scat-
terplot like Figure A-2 does not attempt to isolate the effect that studying has on 
grades from the effects of other variables. Often, however, economists prefer look-
ing at how one variable affects another, holding everything else constant.
To see how this is done, let’s consider one of the most important graphs in eco-
nomics: the demand curve. The demand curve traces out the effect of a good’s price 
on the quantity of the good consumers want to buy. Before showing a demand 
curve, however, consider Table A-1, which shows how the number of novels that 
Emma buys depends on her income and on the price of novels. When novels are 
cheap, Emma buys them in large quantities. As they become more expensive, she 
instead borrows books from the library or chooses to go to the movies rather than 
read. Similarly, at any given price, Emma buys more novels when she has a higher 
income. That is, when her income increases, she spends part of the additional in-
come on novels and part on other goods.
We now have three variables—the price of novels, income, and the number of 
novels purchased—which are more than we can represent in two dimensions. To 
put the information from Table A-1 in graphical form, we need to hold one of the 
three variables constant and trace out the relationship between the other two. Be-
cause the demand curve represents the relationship between price and quantity 
demanded, we hold Emma’s income constant and show how the number of nov-
els she buys varies with the price of novels.
Suppose that Emma’s income is $30,000 per year. If we place the number of 
novels Emma purchases on the x-axis and the price of novels on the y-axis, we can 
graphically represent the middle column of Table A-1. When the points that rep-
resent these entries from the table—(5 novels, $10), (9 novels, $9), and so on—are

This table shows the number 
of novels Emma buys at 
various incomes and prices. 
For any given level of income, 
the data on price and quantity

Figures A-3 and A-4.

INTRODUCTION
connected, they form a line. This line, pictured in Figure A-3, is known as Emma’s 
demand curve for novels; it tells us how many novels Emma purchases at any given 
price. The demand curve is downward sloping, indicating that a higher price re-
duces the quantity of novels demanded. Because the quantity of novels demanded 
and the price move in opposite directions, we say that the two variables are nega-
tively related. (Conversely, when two variables move in the same direction, the curve 
relating them is upward sloping, and we say that the variables are positively related.)
Now suppose that Emma’s income rises to $40,000 per year. At any given price, 
Emma will purchase more novels than she did at her previous level of income. 
Just as earlier we drew Emma’s demand curve for novels using the entries from 
the middle column of Table A-1, we now draw a new demand curve using the 
entries from the right column of the table. This new demand curve (curve D2) is 
pictured alongside the old one (curve D1) in Figure A-4; the new curve is a similar 
line drawn farther to the right. We therefore say that Emma’s demand curve for 
novels shifts to the right when her income increases. Likewise, if Emma’s income 
were to fall to $20,000 per year, she would buy fewer novels at any given price 
and her demand curve would shift to the left (to curve D3).
In economics, it is important to distinguish between movements along a curve 
and shifts of a curve. As we can see from Figure A-3, if Emma earns $30,000 per 
year and novels cost $8 apiece, she will purchase 13 novels per year. If the price of 
novels falls to $7, Emma will increase her purchases of novels to 17 per year. The 
demand curve, however, stays fixed in the same place. Emma still buys the same 
number of novels at each price, but as the price falls, she moves along her demand 
curve from left to right. By contrast, if the price of novels remains fixed at $8 but 
her income rises to $40,000, Emma increases her purchases of novels from 13 to 16 
per year. Because Emma buys more novels at each price, her demand curve shifts 
out, as shown in Figure A-4.
FIGURE A-3
Demand Curve
The line D1 shows how Emma’s 
purchases of novels depend 
on the price of novels when 
her income is held constant. 
­Because the price and the 
quantity ­demanded are nega-
tively ­related, the demand curve 
slopes downward.

Shifting Demand Curves
The location of Emma’s demand 
curve for novels depends on 
how much income she earns. 
The more she earns, the more 
novels she will purchase at any 
given price, and the farther to 
the right her demand curve will 
lie. Curve D1 represents Emma’s 
original demand curve when her 
income is $30,000 per year. If 
her income rises to $40,000 
per year, her demand curve 
shifts to D2. If her income 
falls to $20,000 per year, her 
demand curve shifts to D3.

When income increases, the
demand curve shifts to
the right.
When income
decreases, the
demand curve
shifts to the left.
There is a simple way to tell when it is necessary to shift a curve: When a rel-
evant variable that is not named on either axis changes, the curve shifts. Income is on 
neither the x-axis nor the y-axis of the graph, so when Emma’s income changes, 
her demand curve must shift. The same is true for any change that affects Emma’s 
purchasing habits, with the sole exception of a change in the price of novels. If, 
for instance, the public library closes and Emma must buy all the books she wants 
to read, she will demand more novels at each price, and her demand curve will 
shift to the right. Or if the price of movies falls and Emma spends more time at the 
movies and less time reading, she will demand fewer novels at each price, and her 
demand curve will shift to the left. By contrast, when a variable on an axis of the 
graph changes, the curve does not shift. We read the change as a movement along 
the curve.
Slope
One question we might want to ask about Emma is how much her purchasing 
habits respond to price. Look at the demand curve pictured in Figure A-5. If this 
curve is very steep, Emma purchases nearly the same number of novels regard-
less of whether they are cheap or expensive. If this curve is much flatter, the num-
ber of novels Emma purchases is more sensitive to changes in the price. To answer 
questions about how much one variable responds to changes in another variable, 
we can use the concept of slope.
The slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical distance covered to the horizontal 
distance covered as we move along the line. This definition is usually written out 
in mathematical symbols as follows:
slope 5

Dx ,

Calculating the Slope of a Line
To calculate the slope of the  
demand curve, we can look at 
the changes in the x- and y-
coordinates as we move from  
the point (21 novels, $6) to  
the point (13 novels, $8). The 
slope of the line is the ratio of 
the change in the y-coordinate 
(−2) to the change in the  
x-­coordinate (+8), which 
equals −1﻿﻿/4.

where the Greek letter Δ (delta) stands for the change in a variable. In other 
words, the slope of a line is equal to the “rise” (change in y) divided by the “run” 
(change in x). The slope will be a small positive number for a fairly flat upward-
sloping line, a large positive number for a steep upward-sloping line, and a nega-
tive number for a downward-sloping line. A horizontal line has a slope of zero 
because in this case the y-variable never changes; a vertical line is said to have 
an infinite slope because the y-variable can take any value without the x-variable 
changing at all.
What is the slope of Emma’s demand curve for novels? First of all, because the 
curve slopes down, we know the slope will be negative. To calculate a numerical 
value for the slope, we must choose two points on the line. With Emma’s income 
at $30,000, she will purchase 21 novels at a price of $6 or 13 novels at a price of 
$8. When we apply the slope formula, we are concerned with the change between 
these two points; in other words, we are concerned with the difference between 
them, which lets us know that we will have to subtract one set of values from the 
other, as follows:
slope 5

first x-coordinate 2 second x-coordinate 5

Figure A-5 shows graphically how this calculation works. Try computing the 
slope of Emma’s demand curve using two different points. You should get exactly 
the same result, −1/4. One of the properties of a straight line is that it has the same 
slope everywhere. This is not true of other types of curves, which are steeper in 
some places than in others.
The slope of Emma’s demand curve tells us something about how responsive 
her purchases are to changes in the price. A small slope (a number close to zero)

number of novels she buys substantially in response to a price change. A larger 
slope (a number farther from zero) means that Emma’s demand curve is relatively 
steep; in this case, she adjusts the number of novels she buys only slightly in  
response to a price change.
Cause and Effect
Economists often use graphs to advance an argument about how the economy 
works. In other words, they use graphs to argue about how one set of events 
causes another set of events. With a graph like the demand curve, there is no doubt 
about cause and effect. Because we are varying price and holding all other vari-
ables constant, we know that changes in the price of novels cause changes in the 
quantity Emma demands. Remember, however, that our demand curve came 
from a hypothetical example. When graphing data from the real world, it is often 
more difficult to establish how one variable affects another.
The first problem is that it is difficult to hold everything else constant when 
studying the relationship between two variables. If we are not able to hold other 
variables constant, we might decide that one variable on our graph is causing 
changes in the other variable when those changes are actually being caused by a 
third omitted variable not pictured on the graph. Even if we have identified the cor-
rect two variables to look at, we might run into a second problem—reverse causal-
ity. In other words, we might decide that A causes B when in fact B causes A. The 
omitted-variable and reverse-causality traps require us to proceed with caution 
when using graphs to draw conclusions about causes and effects.
Omitted Variables  To see how omitting a variable can lead to a deceptive graph, 
let’s consider an example. Imagine that the government, spurred by public con-
cern about the large number of deaths from cancer, commissions an exhaustive 
study from Big Brother Statistical Services, Inc. Big Brother examines many of the 
items found in people’s homes to see which of them are associated with the risk 
of cancer. Big Brother reports a strong relationship between two variables: the 
number of cigarette lighters that a household owns and the probability that some-
one in the household will develop cancer. Figure A-6 shows this relationship.
What should we make of this result? Big Brother advises a quick policy response. 
It recommends that the government discourage the ownership of cigarette light-
ers by taxing their sale. It also recommends that the government require warning 
labels: “Big Brother has determined that this lighter is dangerous to your health.”
FIGURE A-6
Graph with an Omitted Variable
The upward-sloping curve shows 
that members of households 
with more cigarette lighters are 
more likely to develop cancer. 
Yet we should not conclude that 
ownership of lighters causes 
cancer because the graph does 
not take into account the  
number of cigarettes smoked.

INTRODUCTION
In judging the validity of Big Brother’s analysis, one question is key: Has Big 
Brother held constant every relevant variable except the one under consideration? 
If the answer is no, the results are suspect. An easy explanation for Figure A-6 is 
that people who own more cigarette lighters are more likely to smoke cigarettes 
and that cigarettes, not lighters, cause cancer. If Figure A-6 does not hold constant 
the amount of smoking, it does not tell us the true effect of owning a cigarette 
lighter.
This story illustrates an important principle: When you see a graph used to 
support an argument about cause and effect, it is important to ask whether the 
movements of an omitted variable could explain the results you see.
Reverse Causality  Economists can also make mistakes about causality by mis-
reading its direction. To see how this is possible, suppose the Association of 
American Anarchists commissions a study of crime in America and arrives at 
­Figure A-7, which plots the number of violent crimes per thousand people in ma-
jor cities against the number of police officers per thousand people. The anarchists 
note the curve’s upward slope and argue that because police increase rather than 
decrease the amount of urban violence, law enforcement should be abolished.
If we could run a controlled experiment, we would avoid the danger of reverse 
causality. To run an experiment, we would randomly assign different numbers 
of police to different cities and then examine the correlation between police and 
crime. Figure A-7, however, is not based on such an experiment. We simply ob-
serve that more dangerous cities have more police officers. The explanation for

this may be that more dangerous cities hire more police. In other words, rather 
than police causing crime, crime may cause police. Nothing in the graph itself al-
lows us to establish the direction of causality.
It might seem that an easy way to determine the direction of causality is to 
examine which variable moves first. If we see crime increase and then the police 
force expand, we reach one conclusion. If we see the police force expand and then 
crime increase, we reach the other. Yet there is also a flaw with this approach: 
Often, people change their behavior not in response to a change in their present 
conditions but in response to a change in their expectations of future conditions. 
A city that expects a major crime wave in the future, for instance, might hire more 
police now. This problem is even easier to see in the case of babies and minivans. 
Couples often buy a minivan in anticipation of the birth of a child. The minivan 
comes before the baby, but we wouldn’t want to conclude that the sale of mini-
vans causes the population to grow!
There is no complete set of rules that says when it is appropriate to draw causal 
conclusions from graphs. Yet just keeping in mind that cigarette lighters don’t 
cause cancer (omitted variable) and minivans don’t cause larger families (reverse 
causality) will keep you from falling for many faulty economic arguments.

INTRODUCTION
people provide you and other consumers with the goods and services they pro­
duce because they get something in return. 
In subsequent chapters, we examine how an economy coordinates the activities 
of millions of people with varying tastes and abilities. As a starting point for this 
analysis, in this chapter we consider the reasons for economic interdependence. 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics highlighted in Chapter 1 is that trade can 
make everyone better off. We now examine this principle more closely. What ex­
actly do people gain when they trade with one another? Why do people choose to 
become interdependent?
The answers to these questions are key to understanding the modern global 
economy. Most countries today import from abroad many of the goods and ser­
vices they consume, and they export to foreign customers many of the goods and 
services they produce. The analysis in this chapter explains interdependence not 
only among individuals but also among nations. As we will see, the gains from 
trade are much the same whether you are buying a haircut from your local barber 
or a T-shirt made by a worker on the other side of the globe.
3-1 A Parable for the Modern Economy
To understand why people choose to depend on others for goods and services and 
how this choice improves their lives, let’s look at a simple economy. Imagine that 
there are two goods in the world: meat and potatoes. And there are two people in 
the world—a cattle rancher named Rose and a potato farmer named Frank—each 
of whom would like to eat both meat and potatoes.
The gains from trade are most obvious if Rose can produce only meat and 
Frank can produce only potatoes. In one scenario, Frank and Rose could choose 
to have nothing to do with each other. But after several months of eating beef 
roasted, boiled, broiled, and grilled, Rose might decide that self-sufficiency is 
not all it’s cracked up to be. Frank, who has been eating potatoes mashed, fried, 
baked, and scalloped, would likely agree. It is easy to see that trade would allow 
them to enjoy greater variety: Each could then have a steak with a baked potato or 
a burger with fries.
Although this scene illustrates most simply how everyone can benefit from 
trade, the gains would be similar if Frank and Rose were each capable of produc­
ing the other good, but only at great cost. Suppose, for example, that Rose is able 
to grow potatoes but her land is not very well suited for it. Similarly, suppose that 
Frank is able to raise cattle and produce meat but he is not very good at it. In this 
case, Frank and Rose can each benefit by specializing in what he or she does best 
and then trading with the other person.
The gains from trade are less obvious, however, when one person is better at 
producing every good. For example, suppose that Rose is better at raising cattle and 
better at growing potatoes than Frank. In this case, should Rose choose to remain 
self-sufficient? Or is there still reason for her to trade with Frank? To answer this 
question, we need to look more closely at the factors that affect such a decision.
3-1a Production Possibilities
Suppose that Frank and Rose each work 8 hours per day and can devote this 
time to growing potatoes, raising cattle, or a combination of the two. The table 
in ­Figure 1 shows the amount of time each person requires to produce 1 ounce of

each good. Frank can produce an ounce of potatoes in 15 minutes and an ounce of 
meat in 60 minutes. Rose, who is more productive in both activities, can produce 
an ounce of potatoes in 10 minutes and an ounce of meat in 20 minutes. The last 
two columns in the table show the amounts of meat or potatoes Frank and Rose 
can produce if they devote all 8 hours to producing only that good.
Panel (b) of Figure 1 illustrates the amounts of meat and potatoes that Frank 
can produce. If Frank devotes all 8 hours of his time to potatoes, he produces 
32 ounces of potatoes (measured on the horizontal axis) and no meat. If he de­
votes all his time to meat, he produces 8 ounces of meat (measured on the vertical 
axis) and no potatoes. If Frank divides his time equally between the two activities, 
spending 4 hours on each, he produces 16 ounces of potatoes and 4 ounces of 
meat. The figure shows these three possible outcomes and all others in between.
This graph is Frank’s production possibilities frontier. As we discussed in 
Chapter 2, a production possibilities frontier shows the various mixes of output 
that an economy can produce. It illustrates one of the Ten Principles of Economics in 
Chapter 1: People face trade-offs. Here Frank faces a trade-off between producing 
meat and producing potatoes. 
Figure 1

PART I	
INTRODUCTION
You may recall that the production possibilities frontier in Chapter 2 was 
drawn bowed out. In that case, the rate at which society could trade one good 
for the other depended on the amounts that were being produced. Here, how­
ever, Frank’s technology for producing meat and potatoes (as summarized in 
­Figure 1) allows him to switch between the two goods at a constant rate. When­
ever Frank spends 1 hour less producing meat and 1 hour more producing pota­
toes, he reduces his output of meat by 1 ounce and raises his output of potatoes by 
4 ounces—and this is true regardless of how much he is already producing. As a 
result, the production possibilities frontier is a straight line.
Panel (c) of Figure 1 shows the production possibilities frontier for Rose. If 
Rose devotes all 8 hours of her time to potatoes, she produces 48 ounces of pota­
toes and no meat. If she devotes all her time to meat, she produces 24 ounces of 
meat and no potatoes. If Rose divides her time equally, spending 4 hours on each 
activity, she produces 24 ounces of potatoes and 12 ounces of meat. Once again, 
the production possibilities frontier shows all the possible outcomes.
If Frank and Rose choose to be self-sufficient rather than trade with each other, 
then each consumes exactly what he or she produces. In this case, the production 
possibilities frontier is also the consumption possibilities frontier. That is, without 
trade, Figure 1 shows the possible combinations of meat and potatoes that Frank 
and Rose can each produce and then consume.
These production possibilities frontiers are useful in showing the trade-offs that 
Frank and Rose face, but they do not tell us what Frank and Rose will actually 
choose to do. To determine their choices, we need to know the tastes of Frank and 
Rose. Let’s suppose they choose the combinations identified by points A and B in 
Figure 1. Based on his production opportunities and food preferences, Frank de­
cides to produce and consume 16 ounces of potatoes and 4 ounces of meat, while 
Rose decides to produce and consume 24 ounces of potatoes and 12 ounces of meat.
3-1b Specialization and Trade
After several years of eating combination B, Rose gets an idea and goes to talk to 
Frank:
Rose:	 Frank, my friend, have I got a deal for you! I know how to improve 
life for both of us. I think you should stop producing meat altogether 
and devote all your time to growing potatoes. According to my calcu­
lations, if you work 8 hours a day growing potatoes, you’ll produce 
32 ounces of potatoes. If you give me 15 of those 32 ounces, I’ll give 
you 5 ounces of meat in return. In the end, you’ll get to eat 17 ounces 
of potatoes and 5 ounces of meat every day, instead of the 16 ounces 
of potatoes and 4 ounces of meat you now get. If you go along with 
my plan, you’ll have more of both foods. [To illustrate her point, Rose 
shows Frank panel (a) of Figure 2.]
Frank:	 (sounding skeptical) That seems like a good deal for me. But I don’t 
understand why you are offering it. If the deal is so good for me, it 
can’t be good for you too.
Rose:	 Oh, but it is! Suppose I spend 6 hours a day raising cattle and 
2 hours growing potatoes. Then I can produce 18 ounces of meat and 
12 ounces of potatoes. After I give you 5 ounces of my meat in ex­
change for 15 ounces of your potatoes, I’ll end up with 13 ounces of 
meat and 27 ounces of potatoes, instead of the 12 ounces of meat and 
24 ounces of potatoes that I now get. So I will also consume more of 
both foods than I do now. [She points out panel (b) of Figure 2.]

Frank:	 (after pausing to study the table) These calculations seem correct, but 
I am puzzled. How can this deal make us both better off?
Rose:	 We can both benefit because trade allows each of us to specialize in 
doing what we do best. You will spend more time growing potatoes 
and less time raising cattle. I will spend more time raising cattle and 
less time growing potatoes. As a result of specialization and trade, 
each of us can consume more meat and more potatoes without 
­working any more hours.

INTRODUCTION
Quick Quiz  Draw an example of a production possibilities frontier for Robinson 
Crusoe, a shipwrecked sailor who spends his time gathering coconuts and catching fish. 
Does this frontier limit Crusoe’s consumption of coconuts and fish if he lives by himself? 
Does he face the same limits if he can trade with natives on the island?
3-2 Comparative Advantage: 
The Driving Force of Specialization
Rose’s explanation of the gains from trade, though correct, poses a puzzle: If Rose 
is better at both raising cattle and growing potatoes, how can Frank ever special­
ize in doing what he does best? Frank doesn’t seem to do anything best. To solve 
this puzzle, we need to look at the principle of comparative advantage.
As a first step in developing this principle, consider the following question: In 
our example, who can produce potatoes at a lower cost—Frank or Rose? There are 
two possible answers, and in these two answers lie the solution to our puzzle and 
the key to understanding the gains from trade.
3-2a Absolute Advantage
One way to answer the question about the cost of producing potatoes is to 
compare the inputs required by the two producers. Economists use the term 
­absolute advantage when comparing the productivity of one person, firm, or na­
tion to that of another. The producer that requires a smaller quantity of inputs to 
produce a good is said to have an absolute advantage in producing that good.
In our example, time is the only input, so we can determine absolute advan­
tage by looking at how much time each type of production takes. Rose has an 
absolute advantage both in producing meat and in producing potatoes because 
she requires less time than Frank to produce a unit of either good. Rose needs 
to input only 20 minutes to produce an ounce of meat, whereas Frank needs  
60 minutes. Similarly, Rose needs only 10 minutes to produce an ounce of potatoes, 
whereas Frank needs 15 minutes. Based on this information, we can conclude that 
Rose has the lower cost of producing potatoes, if we measure cost in terms of the 
quantity of inputs.
3-2b Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage
There is another way to look at the cost of producing potatoes. Rather than com­
paring inputs required, we can compare opportunity costs. Recall from Chapter 1 
that the opportunity cost of some item is what we give up to get that item. In 
our example, we assumed that Frank and Rose each spend 8 hours a day work­
ing. Time spent producing potatoes, therefore, takes away from time available for 
producing meat. When reallocating time between the two goods, Rose and Frank 
give up units of one good to produce units of the other, thereby moving along the 
production possibilities frontier. The opportunity cost measures the trade-off be­
tween the two goods that each producer faces.
Let’s first consider Rose’s opportunity cost. According to the table in panel (a)  
of Figure 1, producing 1 ounce of potatoes takes 10 minutes of work. When 
Rose spends those 10 minutes producing potatoes, she spends 10 minutes less 
absolute advantage
the ability to produce a 
good using fewer inputs 
than another producer

up to obtain some item

producing meat. Because Rose needs 20 minutes to produce 1 ounce of meat,  
10 minutes of work would yield 1﻿﻿/﻿﻿2 ounce of meat. Hence, Rose’s opportunity cost 
of producing 1 ounce of potatoes is 1﻿﻿/﻿﻿2 ounce of meat.
Now consider Frank’s opportunity cost. Producing 1 ounce of potatoes takes him 
15 minutes. Because he needs 60 minutes to produce 1 ounce of meat, 15 minutes  
of work would yield 1﻿﻿/﻿﻿4 ounce of meat. Hence, Frank’s opportunity cost of 1 ounce of  
potatoes is 1﻿﻿/﻿﻿4 ounce of meat.
Table 1 shows the opportunity costs of meat and potatoes for the two produc­
ers. Notice that the opportunity cost of meat is the inverse of the opportunity cost 
of potatoes. Because 1 ounce of potatoes costs Rose 1﻿﻿/﻿﻿2 ounce of meat, 1 ounce of 
meat costs Rose 2 ounces of potatoes. Similarly, because 1 ounce of potatoes costs 
Frank 1﻿﻿/﻿﻿4 ounce of meat, 1 ounce of meat costs Frank 4 ounces of potatoes.
Economists use the term comparative advantage when describing the opportu­
nity costs faced by two producers. The producer who gives up less of other goods 
to produce Good X has the smaller opportunity cost of producing Good X and is 
said to have a comparative advantage in producing it. In our example, Frank has 
a lower opportunity cost of producing potatoes than Rose: An ounce of potatoes 
costs Frank only 1﻿﻿/﻿﻿4 ounce of meat, but it costs Rose 1﻿﻿/﻿﻿2 ounce of meat. Conversely, 
Rose has a lower opportunity cost of producing meat than Frank: An ounce of 
meat costs Rose 2 ounces of potatoes, but it costs Frank 4 ounces of potatoes. 
Thus, Frank has a comparative advantage in growing potatoes, and Rose has a 
comparative advantage in producing meat.
Although it is possible for one person to have an absolute advantage in both 
goods (as Rose does in our example), it is impossible for one person to have a 
comparative advantage in both goods. Because the opportunity cost of one good 
is the inverse of the opportunity cost of the other, if a person’s opportunity cost of 
one good is relatively high, the opportunity cost of the other good must be rela­
tively low. Comparative advantage reflects the relative opportunity cost. Unless 
two people have the same opportunity cost, one person will have a comparative 
advantage in one good, and the other person will have a comparative advantage 
in the other good. 
3-2c Comparative Advantage and Trade
The gains from specialization and trade are based not on absolute advantage but 
on comparative advantage. When each person specializes in producing the good 
for which he or she has a comparative advantage, total production in the economy 
rises. This increase in the size of the economic pie can be used to make everyone 
better off.

INTRODUCTION
In our example, Frank spends more time growing potatoes, and Rose spends 
more time producing meat. As a result, the total production of potatoes rises from 
40 to 44 ounces, and the total production of meat rises from 16 to 18 ounces. Frank 
and Rose share the benefits of this increased production. 
We can also look at the gains from trade in terms of the price that each party 
pays the other. Because Frank and Rose have different opportunity costs, they can 
both get a bargain. That is, each of them benefits from trade by obtaining a good 
at a price that is lower than his or her opportunity cost of that good. 
Consider the proposed deal from Frank’s viewpoint. Frank receives 5 ounces 
of meat in exchange for 15 ounces of potatoes. In other words, Frank buys each 
ounce of meat for a price of 3 ounces of potatoes. This price of meat is lower than 
his opportunity cost for an ounce of meat, which is 4 ounces of potatoes. Thus, 
Frank benefits from the deal because he gets to buy meat at a good price. 
Now consider the deal from Rose’s viewpoint. Rose buys 15 ounces of potatoes 
for a price of 5 ounces of meat. That is, the price of potatoes is 1/3 ounce of meat. 
This price of potatoes is lower than her opportunity cost of an ounce of potatoes, 
which is 1﻿﻿/2 ounce of meat. Rose benefits because she gets to buy potatoes at a 
good price.
The story of Rose the rancher and Frank the farmer has a simple moral, which 
should now be clear: Trade can benefit everyone in society because it allows people to 
specialize in activities in which they have a comparative advantage. 
3-2d The Price of the Trade
The principle of comparative advantage establishes that there are gains from 
specialization and trade, but it raises a couple of related questions: What deter­
mines the price at which trade takes place? How are the gains from trade shared 
­between the trading parties? The precise answer to these questions is beyond the 
scope of this chapter, but we can state one general rule: For both parties to gain from 
trade, the price at which they trade must lie between the two opportunity costs.
In our example, Frank and Rose agreed to trade at a rate of 3 ounces of potatoes 
for each ounce of meat. This price is between Rose’s opportunity cost (2 ounces of 
potatoes per ounce of meat) and Frank’s opportunity cost (4 ounces of potatoes 
per ounce of meat). The price need not be exactly in the middle for both parties to 
gain, but it must be somewhere between 2 and 4.
To see why the price has to be in this range, consider what would happen if it 
were not. If the price of meat were below 2 ounces of potatoes, both Frank and 
Rose would want to buy meat, because the price would be below each of their 
opportunity costs. Similarly, if the price of meat were above 4 ounces of potatoes, 
both would want to sell meat, because the price would be above their opportunity 
costs. But there are only two members of this economy. They cannot both be buyers 
of meat, nor can they both be sellers. Someone has to take the other side of the deal.
A mutually advantageous trade can be struck at a price between 2 and 4. In this 
price range, Rose wants to sell meat to buy potatoes, and Frank wants to sell pota­
toes to buy meat. Each party can buy a good at a price that is lower than his or her 
opportunity cost. In the end, each person specializes in the good for which he or 
she has a comparative advantage and is, as a result, better off.

3-3 Applications of Comparative 
Advantage
The principle of comparative advantage explains interdependence and the gains 
from trade. Because interdependence is so prevalent in the modern world, the 
principle of comparative advantage has many applications. Here are two exam­
ples, one fanciful and one of great practical importance.
3-3a Should Tom Brady Mow His Own Lawn?
Tom Brady spends a lot of time running around on grass. One of the most tal­
ented football players of all time, he can throw a pass with a speed and accuracy 
that most casual athletes can only dream of. Most likely, he is talented at other 
physical activities as well. For example, let’s imagine that Brady can mow his 
lawn faster than anyone else. But just because he can mow his lawn fast, does 
this mean he should?
To answer this question, we can use the concepts of opportunity cost and com­
parative advantage. Let’s say that Brady can mow his lawn in 2 hours. In that 
same 2 hours, he could film a television commercial and earn $20,000. By contrast, 
The Legacy of Adam Smith 
and David Ricardo
E
conomists have long understood the gains from trade. Here is how 
the great economist Adam Smith put the argument: 
It is a maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt 
to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The 
tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the 
shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes 
but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one 
nor the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find 
it for their interest to employ their 
whole industry in a way in which 
they have some advantage over their 
neighbors, and to purchase with a 
part of its produce, or what is the 
same thing, with the price of part 
of it, whatever else they have occa-
sion for.
This quotation is from Smith’s 1776 
book An Inquiry into the ­Nature and 
Causes of the Wealth of ­Nations, which 
was a landmark in the analysis of 
trade and economic interdependence.
Smith’s book inspired 
David Ricardo, a million-
aire stockbroker, to become 
an economist. In his 1817 book Prin-
ciples of Political Economy and Taxation, Ricardo 
developed the principle of comparative advantage as we know it today. 
He considered an example with two goods (wine and cloth) and two coun-
tries (England and Portugal). He showed that both countries can gain 
by opening up trade and specializing based on comparative advantage.
Ricardo’s theory is the starting point of modern international 
economics, but his defense of free trade was not a mere academic 
exercise. Ricardo put his beliefs to work as a member of the British 
Parliament, where he opposed the Corn Laws, which restricted the 
import of grain.
The conclusions of Adam Smith and David Ricardo on the gains 
from trade have held up well over time. Although economists often 
disagree on questions of policy, they are united in their support of free 
trade. Moreover, the central argument for free trade has not changed 
much in the past two centuries. Even though the field of economics has 
broadened its scope and refined its theories since the time of Smith 
and Ricardo, economists’ opposition to trade restrictions is still based 
largely on the principle of comparative advantage.

INTRODUCTION
Forrest Gump, the boy next door, can mow Brady’s lawn in 4 hours. In that same 
4 hours, Gump could work at McDonald’s and earn $40. 
In this example, Brady has an absolute advantage in mowing lawns because he 
can do the work with a lower input of time. Yet because Brady’s opportunity cost 
of mowing the lawn is $20,000 and Gump’s opportunity cost is only $40, Gump 
has a comparative advantage in mowing lawns.
The gains from trade in this example are tremendous. Rather than mowing his 
own lawn, Brady should make the commercial and hire Gump to mow the lawn. 
As long as Brady pays Gump more than $40 and less than $20,000, both of them 
are better off.
You’re Dividing the 
Chores Wrong
By Emily Oster
N
o one likes doing chores. In happiness 
surveys, housework is ranked down there 
with commuting as activities that people en-
joy the least. Maybe that’s why figuring out 
who does which chores usually prompts, at 
best, tense discussion in a household and, at 
worst, outright fighting. 
If everyone is good at something differ-
ent, assigning chores is easy. If your part-
ner is great at grocery shopping and you are 
great at the laundry, you’re set. But this isn’t 
always—or even usually—the case. Often 
one person is better at everything. (And let’s 
be honest, often that person is the woman.) 
Better at the laundry, the grocery shopping, 
the cleaning, the cooking. But does that mean 
she should have to do everything?
Before my daughter was born, I both 
cooked and did the dishes. It wasn’t a big deal, 
it didn’t take too much time, and honestly I 
was a lot better at both than my husband. 
His cooking repertoire extended only to eggs 
and chili, and when I left him in charge of the 
dishwasher, I’d often find he had run it “full” 
with one pot and eight forks.
After we had a kid, we had more to do and 
less time to do it in. It seemed like it was time 
for some reassignments. But, of course, I was 
still better at doing both things. Did that mean I 
should do them both?
I could have appealed to the principle of fair-
ness: We should each do half. I could have ap-
pealed to feminism—surveys show that women 
more often than not get the short end of the 
chore stick. In time-use data, women do about 
44 minutes more housework than men (2 hours 
and 11 minutes versus 1 hour and 27 minutes). 
Men outwork women only in the areas of “lawn” 
and “exterior maintenance.” I could have sug-
gested he do more chores to rectify this imbal-
ance, to show our daughter, in the Free To Be You 
and Me style, that Mom and Dad are equal and 
that housework is fun if we do it together! I could 
have simply smashed around the pans in the 
dishwasher while sighing loudly in the hopes he 
would notice and offer to do it himself.
But luckily for me and my husband, I’m an 
economist, so I have more effective tools than 
passive aggression. And some basic economic 
principles provided the answer. We needed to 
divide the chores because it is simply not 
efficient for the best cook and dishwasher 
to do all the cooking and dishwashing. The 
economic principle at play here is increasing 
marginal cost. Basically, people get worse 
when they are tired. When I teach my students 
at the University of Chicago this principle, I 
explain it in the context of managing their 
employees. Imagine you have a good employee 
and a not-so-good one. Should you make the 
good employee do literally everything? 
Usually, the answer is no. Why not? It’s 
likely that the not-so-good employee is better 
at 9 a.m. after a full night of sleep than the 
good employee is at 2 a.m. after a 17-hour 
workday. So you want to give at least a few 
tasks to your worse guy. The same principle 
applies in your household. Yes, you (or your 
spouse) might be better at everything. But 
anyone doing the laundry at 4 a.m. is likely to 
put the red towels in with the white T-shirts. 
Some task splitting is a good idea. How much 
depends on how fast people’s skills decay. 
To “optimize” your family efficiency (every 
economist’s ultimate goal—and yours, too), 
you want to equalize effectiveness on the final

task each person is doing. Your partner does 
the dishes, mows the lawn, and makes the 
grocery list. You do the cooking, laundry, shop-
ping, cleaning, and paying the bills. This may 
seem imbalanced, but when you look at it, you 
see that by the time your partner gets to the 
grocery-list task, he is wearing thin and start-
ing to nod off. It’s all he can do to figure out 
how much milk you need. In fact, he is just 
about as good at that as you are when you get 
around to paying the bills, even though that’s 
your fifth task. 
If you then made your partner also do the 
cleaning—so it was an even four and four—
the house would be a disaster, since he is al-
ready exhausted by his third chore while you 
are still doing fine. This system may well end 
up meaning one person does more, but it is un-
likely to result in one person doing everything. 
Once you’ve decided you need to divide up 
the chores in this way, how should you decide 
who does what? One option would be randomly 
assigning tasks; another would be having each 
person do some of everything. One spousal-ad-
vice website I read suggested you should divide 
tasks based on which ones you like the best. 
None of these are quite right. (In the last case, 
how would anyone ever end up with the job of 
cleaning the bathroom?)
To decide who does what, we need more 
economics. Specifically, the principle of 
comparative advantage. Economists usu-
ally talk about this in the context of trade. 
Imagine Finland is better than Sweden at 
making both reindeer hats and snowshoes. 
But they are much, much better at the hats 
and only a little better at the snowshoes. 
The overall world production is maximized 
when Finland makes hats and Sweden 
makes snowshoes.
We say that Finland has an absolute 
advantage in both things but a compara-
tive advantage only in hats. This principle 
is part of the reason economists value free 
trade, but that’s for another column (and 
probably another author). But it’s also a 
guideline for how to trade tasks in your 
house. You want to assign each person the 
tasks on which he or she has a comparative 
advantage. It doesn’t matter that you have 
an absolute advantage in everything. If you 
are much, much better at the laundry and 
only a little better at cleaning the toilet, you 
should do the laundry and have your spouse 
get out the scrub brush. Just explain that it’s 
efficient!
In our case, it was easy. Other than us-
ing the grill—which I freely admit is the 
husband domain—I’m much, much bet-
ter at ­cooking. And I was only moderately 
better at the dishes. So he got the job of 
cleaning up after meals, even though his 
dishwasher loading habits had already 
come under scrutiny. The good news is 
another economic ­principle I hadn’t even 
counted on was soon in play: learning by 
doing. As people do a task, they improve at 
it. ­Eighteen months into this new arrange-
ment the dishwasher is almost a work of 
art: neat rows of dishes and everything 
carefully screened for “top-rack only” sta-
tus. I, meanwhile, am ­forbidden from get-
ting near the dishwasher. ­Apparently, there 
is a risk that I’ll “ruin it.”

3-3b Should the United States Trade with 
Other Countries?
Just as individuals can benefit from specialization and trade with one another, as 
Frank and Rose did, so can populations of people in different countries. Many 
of the goods that Americans enjoy are produced abroad, and many of the goods 
produced in the United States are sold abroad. Goods produced abroad and sold 
domestically are called imports. Goods produced domestically and sold abroad 
are called exports.

INTRODUCTION
3-4 Conclusion
You should now understand more fully the benefits of living in an inter­
dependent economy. When Americans buy tube socks from China, when resi­
dents of Maine drink orange juice from Florida, and when a homeowner hires 
the kid next door to mow the lawn, the same economic forces are at work. 
The principle of comparative advantage shows that trade can make everyone 
better off.
Having seen why interdependence is desirable, you might naturally ask 
how it is possible. How do free societies coordinate the diverse activities of all 
the people involved in their economies? What ensures that goods and services 
will get from those who should be producing them to those who should be con­
suming them? In a world with only two people, such as Rose the rancher and 
Frank the farmer, the answer is simple: These two people can bargain and al­
locate resources between themselves. In the real world with billions of people, 
the answer is less obvious. We take up this issue in Chapter 4, where we see 
that free societies allocate resources through the market forces of supply and  
demand.
To see how countries can benefit from trade, suppose there are two countries, 
the United States and Japan, and two goods, food and cars. Imagine that the two 
countries produce cars equally well: An American worker and a Japanese worker 
can each produce one car per month. By contrast, because the United States has 
more and better land, it is better at producing food: A U.S. worker can produce 
2 tons of food per month, whereas a Japanese worker can produce only 1 ton of 
food per month. 
The principle of comparative advantage states that each good should be 
produced by the country that has the smaller opportunity cost of producing 
that good. Because the opportunity cost of a car is 2 tons of food in the United 
States but only 1 ton of food in Japan, Japan has a comparative advantage in 
producing cars. Japan should produce more cars than it wants for its own use 
and export some of them to the United States. Similarly, because the opportu­
nity cost of a ton of food is 1 car in Japan but only 1﻿﻿/﻿﻿2 car in the United States, 
the United States has a comparative advantage in producing food. The United 
States should produce more food than it wants to consume and export some to 
Japan. Through specialization and trade, both countries can have more food 
and more cars.
In reality, of course, the issues involved in trade among nations are more com­
plex than this example suggests. Most important among these issues is that each 
country has many citizens with different interests. International trade can make 
some individuals worse off, even as it makes the country as a whole better off. 
When the United States exports food and imports cars, the impact on an ­American 
farmer is not the same as the impact on an American autoworker. Yet, contrary to 
the opinions sometimes voiced by politicians and pundits, international trade is 
not like war, in which some countries win and others lose. Trade allows all coun­
tries to achieve greater prosperity.

Key Concepts
  1.	 Under what conditions is the production possibilities 
frontier linear rather than bowed out?
  2.	 Explain how absolute advantage and comparative 
advantage differ.
  3.	 Give an example in which one person has an absolute 
advantage in doing something but another person has 
a comparative advantage.
  4.	 Is absolute advantage or comparative advantage more 
important for trade? Explain your reasoning using the 
example in your answer to Question 3.
  5.	 If two parties trade based on comparative advantage 
and both gain, in what range must the price of the 
trade lie?
  6.	 Why do economists oppose policies that restrict trade 
among nations?
Questions for Review
•	
Each person consumes goods and services produced 
by many other people both in the United States and 
around the world. Interdependence and trade are de­
sirable because they allow everyone to enjoy a greater 
quantity and variety of goods and services.
•	
There are two ways to compare the ability of two 
­people to produce a good. The person who can pro­
duce the good with the smaller quantity of inputs 
is said to have an absolute advantage in producing the 
good. The person who has the smaller opportunity 
cost of producing the good is said to have a comparative 
advantage. The gains from trade are based on compara­
tive advantage, not absolute advantage.
•	
Trade makes everyone better off because it allows 
­people to specialize in those activities in which they 
have a comparative advantage. 
•	
The principle of comparative advantage applies to 
countries as well as to people. Economists use the prin­
ciple of comparative advantage to advocate free trade 
among countries.

The Market Forces 
of Supply and 
Demand
W
hen a cold snap hits Florida, the price of orange juice rises in supermarkets 
throughout the country. When the weather turns warm in New England 
every summer, the price of hotel rooms in the Caribbean plummets. When 
a war breaks out in the Middle East, the price of gasoline in the United States rises 
and the price of a used Cadillac falls. What do these events have in common? 
They all show the workings of supply and demand.
Supply and demand are the two words economists use most often—and for good 
reason. Supply and demand are the forces that make market economies work. 
They determine the quantity of each good produced and the price at which it 
is sold. If you want to know how any event or policy will affect the economy, 
you must think first about how it will affect supply and demand.
This chapter introduces the theory of supply and demand. It consid-
ers how buyers and sellers behave and how they interact with one another.

PART II	
HOW MARKETS WORK
It shows how supply and demand determine prices in a market economy and 
how prices, in turn, allocate the economy’s scarce resources.
4-1 Markets and Competition
The terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people as they interact with 
one another in competitive markets. Before discussing how buyers and sellers 
behave, let’s first consider more fully what we mean by the terms market and 
competition. 
4-1a What Is a Market?
A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. The buy-
ers as a group determine the demand for the product, and the sellers as a group 
determine the supply of the product. 
Markets take many forms. Some markets are highly organized, such as the 
markets for many agricultural commodities. In these markets, buyers and sellers 
meet at a specific time and place where an auctioneer helps set prices and arrange 
sales.
More often, markets are less organized. For example, consider the market for 
ice cream in a particular town. Buyers of ice cream do not meet together at any one 
time. The sellers of ice cream are in different locations and offer somewhat different 
products. There is no auctioneer calling out the price of ice cream. Each seller posts 
a price for an ice-cream cone, and each buyer decides how much ice cream to buy 
at each store. Nonetheless, these consumers and producers of ice cream are closely 
connected. The ice-cream buyers are choosing from the various ice-cream sellers to 
satisfy their cravings, and the ice-cream sellers are all trying to appeal to the same 
ice-cream buyers to make their businesses successful. Even though it is not as orga-
nized, the group of ice-cream buyers and ice-cream sellers forms a market. 
4-1b  What Is Competition?
The market for ice cream, like most markets in the economy, is highly competi-
tive. Each buyer knows that there are several sellers from which to choose, and 
each seller is aware that his product is similar to that offered by other sellers. As a 
result, the price and quantity of ice cream sold are not determined by any single 
buyer or seller. Rather, price and quantity are determined by all buyers and sellers 
as they interact in the marketplace.
Economists use the term competitive market to describe a market in which 
there are so many buyers and so many sellers that each has a negligible impact 
on the market price. Each seller of ice cream has limited control over the price be-
cause other sellers are offering similar products. A seller has little reason to charge 
less than the going price, and if he charges more, buyers will make their pur-
chases elsewhere. Similarly, no single buyer of ice cream can influence the price of 
ice cream because each buyer purchases only a small amount.
In this chapter, we assume that markets are perfectly competitive. To reach this 
highest form of competition, a market must have two characteristics: (1) The 
goods offered for sale are all exactly the same, and  (2) the buyers and sellers are 
so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market 
price. Because buyers and sellers in perfectly competitive markets must accept the 
price the market determines, they are said to be price takers. At the market price, 
buyers can buy all they want, and sellers can sell all they want.

CHAPTER 4  THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
67
There are some markets in which the assumption of perfect competition ap-
plies perfectly. In the wheat market, for example, there are thousands of farmers 
who sell wheat and millions of consumers who use wheat and wheat products. 
Because no single buyer or seller can influence the price of wheat, each takes the 
market price as given.
Not all goods and services, however, are sold in perfectly competitive markets. 
Some markets have only one seller, and this seller sets the price. Such a seller is 
called a monopoly. Your local cable television company, for instance, may be a mo-
nopoly. Residents of your town probably have only one company from which to 
buy cable service. Still other markets fall between the extremes of perfect competi-
tion and monopoly.
Despite the diversity of market types we find in the world, assuming  
perfect competition is a useful simplification and, therefore, a natural place to 
start. Perfectly competitive markets are the easiest to analyze because everyone 
participating in the market takes the price as given by market conditions. 
Moreover, because some degree of competition is present in most markets, many 
of the lessons that we learn by studying supply and demand under perfect com-
petition apply in more complicated markets as well. 
Quick Quiz  What is a market? • What are the characteristics of a perfectly competi-
tive market?
4-2 Demand
We begin our study of markets by examining the behavior of buyers. To focus our 
thinking, let’s keep in mind a particular good—ice cream.
4-2a The Demand Curve: The Relationship 
between Price and Quantity Demanded
The quantity demanded of any good is the amount of the good that buyers are 
willing and able to purchase. As we will see, many things determine the quantity 
demanded of any good, but in our analysis of how markets work, one determi-
nant plays a central role—the price of the good. If the price of ice cream rose to 
$20 per scoop, you would buy less ice cream. You might buy frozen yogurt in-
stead. If the price of ice cream fell to $0.20 per scoop, you would buy more. This 
relationship between price and quantity demanded is true for most goods in the 
economy and, in fact, is so pervasive that economists call it the law of demand: 
Other things being equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded 
of the good falls, and when the price falls, the quantity demanded rises. 
The table in Figure 1 shows how many ice-cream cones Catherine buys each 
month at different prices of ice cream. If ice cream is free, Catherine eats 12 cones 
per month. At $0.50 per cone, Catherine buys 10 cones each month. As the price 
rises further, she buys fewer and fewer cones. When the price reaches $3.00,  
Catherine doesn’t buy any cones at all. This table is a demand schedule, a 
table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity  
demanded, holding constant everything else that influences how much of the 
good consumers want to buy.
The graph in Figure 1 uses the numbers from the table to illustrate the law 
of demand. By convention, the price of ice cream is on the vertical axis, and the

FIGURE 1
The demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at each price.  
The ­demand curve, which graphs the demand schedule, illustrates how the quantity  
demanded of the good changes as its price varies. Because a lower price increases the  
quantity demanded, the demand curve slopes downward.

Demand curve
quantity of ice cream demanded is on the horizontal axis. The line relating price 
and quantity demanded is called the demand curve. The demand curve slopes 
downward because, other things being equal, a lower price means a greater quan-
tity demanded.
4-2b Market Demand versus Individual Demand
The demand curve in Figure 1 shows an individual’s demand for a product. 
To analyze how markets work, we need to determine the market demand, the sum 
of all the individual demands for a particular good or service.
The table in Figure 2 shows the demand schedules for ice cream of the two 
individuals in this market—Catherine and Nicholas. At any price, Catherine’s de-
mand schedule tells us how much ice cream she buys, and Nicholas’s demand 
schedule tells us how much ice cream he buys. The market demand at each price 
is the sum of the two individual demands.
The graph in Figure 2 shows the demand curves that correspond to these de-
mand schedules. Notice that we sum the individual demand curves horizontally 
to obtain the market demand curve. That is, to find the total quantity demanded 
at any price, we add the individual quantities, which are found on the horizontal 
axis of the individual demand curves. Because we are interested in analyzing how 
markets function, we work most often with the market demand curve. The mar-
ket demand curve shows how the total quantity demanded of a good varies as the 
price of the good varies, while all the other factors that affect how much consum-
ers want to buy are held constant.

4-2c Shifts in the Demand Curve
Because the market demand curve holds other things constant, it need not be sta-
ble over time. If something happens to alter the quantity demanded at any given 
price, the demand curve shifts. For example, suppose the American ­Medical 
­Association discovered that people who regularly eat ice cream live longer, 
healthier lives. The discovery would raise the demand for ice cream. At any given 
price, buyers would now want to purchase a larger quantity of ice cream, and the 
demand curve for ice cream would shift. 
Figure 3 illustrates shifts in demand. Any change that increases the quantity 
demanded at every price, such as our imaginary discovery by the American 
­Medical Association, shifts the demand curve to the right and is called an increase 
in demand. Any change that reduces the quantity demanded at every price shifts 
the demand curve to the left and is called a decrease in demand.
There are many variables that can shift the demand curve. Here are the most 
important.
Income  What would happen to your demand for ice cream if you lost your 
job one summer? Most likely, it would fall. A lower income means that you have 
FIGURE 2
The quantity demanded in a market is the sum of the quantities demanded by all the buyers 
at each price. Thus, the market demand curve is found by adding horizontally the individual 
demand curves. At a price of $2.00, Catherine demands 4 ice-cream cones and Nicholas de-
mands 3 ice-cream cones. The quantity demanded in the market at this price is 7 cones.

HOW MARKETS WORK
less to spend in total, so you would have to spend less on some—and probably 
most—goods. If the demand for a good falls when income falls, the good is called 
a normal good.
Not all goods are normal goods. If the demand for a good rises when income 
falls, the good is called an inferior good. An example of an inferior good might be 
bus rides. As your income falls, you are less likely to buy a car or take a cab and 
more likely to ride a bus.
Prices of Related Goods  Suppose that the price of frozen yogurt falls. The law 
of demand says that you will buy more frozen yogurt. At the same time, you will 
probably buy less ice cream. Because ice cream and frozen yogurt are both cold, 
sweet, creamy desserts, they satisfy similar desires. When a fall in the price of one 
good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called ­substitutes. 
Substitutes are often pairs of goods that are used in place of each other, such 
as hot dogs and hamburgers, sweaters and sweatshirts, and movie tickets and 
DVD ­rentals.
Now suppose that the price of hot fudge falls. According to the law of demand, 
you will buy more hot fudge. Yet in this case, you will likely buy more ice cream 
as well because ice cream and hot fudge are often used together. When a fall in the 
price of one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are called 
complements. Complements are often pairs of goods that are used together, such 
as gasoline and automobiles, computers and software, and peanut butter and jelly. 
Tastes  The most obvious determinant of your demand is your tastes. If you like 
ice cream, you buy more of it. Economists normally do not try to explain people’s 
tastes because tastes are based on historical and psychological forces that are be-
yond the realm of economics. Economists do, however, examine what happens 
when tastes change.
Expectations  Your expectations about the future may affect your demand for a 
good or service today. If you expect to earn a higher income next month, you may

choose to save less now and spend more of your current income buying ice cream. 
If you expect the price of ice cream to fall tomorrow, you may be less willing to buy 
an ice-cream cone at today’s price.
Number of Buyers  In addition to the preceding factors, which influence the 
behavior of individual buyers, market demand depends on the number of these 
buyers. If Peter were to join Catherine and Nicholas as another consumer of ice 
cream, the quantity demanded in the market would be higher at every price, and 
market demand would increase.
Summary  The demand curve shows what happens to the quantity demanded 
of a good when its price varies, holding constant all the other variables that influ-
ence buyers. When one of these other variables changes, the demand curve shifts. 
Table 1 lists the variables that influence how much of a good consumers choose 
to buy. 
If you have trouble remembering whether you need to shift or move along the 
demand curve, it helps to recall a lesson from the appendix to Chapter 2. A curve 
shifts when there is a change in a relevant variable that is not measured on either 
axis. Because the price is on the vertical axis, a change in price represents a move-
ment along the demand curve. By contrast, income, the prices of related goods, 
tastes, expectations, and the number of buyers are not measured on either axis, so 
a change in one of these variables shifts the demand curve.
Variables That Influence Buyers
This table lists the variables that affect 
how much consumers choose to buy of any 
good. Notice the special role that the price 
of the good plays: A change in the good’s 
price represents a movement along the 
demand curve, whereas a change in one of 
the other variables shifts the demand curve.

 Two Ways to Reduce the Quantity of Smoking Demanded
Public policymakers often want to reduce the amount that people 
smoke because of smoking’s adverse health effects. There are two ways 
that policy can attempt to achieve this goal.
One way to reduce smoking is to shift the demand curve for cigarettes and 
other tobacco products. Public service announcements, mandatory health warn-
ings on cigarette packages, and the prohibition of cigarette advertising on televi-
sion are all policies aimed at reducing the quantity of cigarettes demanded at any 
given price. If successful, these policies shift the demand curve for cigarettes to 
the left, as in panel (a) of Figure 4.

If warnings on cigarette packages convince smokers to smoke less, the demand curve 
for cigarettes shifts to the left. In panel (a), the demand curve shifts from D1 to D2. At a 
price of $2.00 per pack, the quantity demanded falls from 20 to 10 cigarettes per day, 
as reflected by the shift from point A to point B. By contrast, if a tax raises the price of 
cigarettes, the demand curve does not shift. Instead, we observe a movement to a different 
point on the demand curve. In panel (b), when the price rises from $2.00 to $4.00, the 
quantity demanded falls from 20 to 12 cigarettes per day, as reflected by the movement 
from point A to point C.

A tax that raises the price
of cigarettes results in a

demand curve.
Alternatively, policymakers can try to raise the price of cigarettes. If the gov-
ernment taxes the manufacture of cigarettes, for example, cigarette companies 
pass much of this tax on to consumers in the form of higher prices. A higher price 
encourages smokers to reduce the numbers of cigarettes they smoke. In this case, 
the reduced amount of smoking does not represent a shift in the demand curve. 
Instead, it represents a movement along the same demand curve to a point with a 
higher price and lower quantity, as in panel (b) of Figure 4.
How much does the amount of smoking respond to changes in the price of 
cigarettes? Economists have attempted to answer this question by studying what 
happens when the tax on cigarettes changes. They have found that a 10 percent 
increase in the price causes a 4 percent reduction in the quantity demanded. Teen-
agers are especially sensitive to the price of cigarettes: A 10 percent increase in the 
price causes a 12 percent drop in teenage smoking.
A related question is how the price of cigarettes affects the demand for illicit 
drugs, such as marijuana. Opponents of cigarette taxes often argue that tobacco 
and marijuana are substitutes so that high cigarette prices encourage marijuana 
use. By contrast, many experts on substance abuse view tobacco as a “gateway 
drug” leading the young to experiment with other harmful substances. Most 
studies of the data are consistent with this latter view: They find that lower ciga-
rette prices are associated with greater use of marijuana. In other words, tobacco 
and marijuana appear to be complements rather than substitutes.

CHAPTER 4  THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND

4-3 Supply
We now turn to the other side of the market and examine the behavior of sellers. 
Once again, to focus our thinking, let’s consider the market for ice cream.
4-3a The Supply Curve: The Relationship 
between Price and Quantity Supplied
The quantity supplied of any good or service is the amount that sellers are will-
ing and able to sell. There are many determinants of quantity supplied, but once 
again, price plays a special role in our analysis. When the price of ice cream is 
high, selling ice cream is profitable, and so the quantity supplied is large. Sell-
ers of ice cream work long hours, buy many ice-cream machines, and hire many 
workers. By contrast, when the price of ice cream is low, the business is less prof-
itable, so sellers produce less ice cream. At a low price, some sellers may even 
choose to shut down, and their quantity supplied falls to zero. This relationship 
between price and quantity supplied is called the law of supply: Other things be-
ing equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the good also 
rises, and when the price falls, the quantity supplied falls as well.
The table in Figure 5 shows the quantity of ice-cream cones supplied each 
month by Ben, an ice-cream seller, at various prices of ice cream. At a price below

$1.00, Ben does not supply any ice cream at all. As the price rises, he supplies 
a greater and greater quantity. This is the supply schedule, a table that shows 
the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied, holding 
constant everything else that influences how much producers of the good want 
to sell.
The graph in Figure 5 uses the numbers from the table to illustrate the law of 
supply. The curve relating price and quantity supplied is called the supply curve. 
The supply curve slopes upward because, other things being equal, a higher price 
means a greater quantity supplied. 
4-3b Market Supply versus Individual Supply
Just as market demand is the sum of the demands of all buyers, market supply 
is the sum of the supplies of all sellers. The table in Figure 6 shows the supply 
schedules for the two ice-cream producers in the market—Ben and Jerry. At any 
price, Ben’s supply schedule tells us the quantity of ice cream that Ben supplies,

The quantity supplied in a market is the sum of the quantities supplied by all the 
­sellers at each price. Thus, the market supply curve is found by adding horizontally 
the individual supply curves. At a price of $2.00, Ben supplies 3 ice-cream cones and 
Jerry supplies 4 ice-cream cones. The quantity supplied in the market at this price is 
7 cones.

CHAPTER 4  THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND

and Jerry’s supply schedule tells us the quantity of ice cream that Jerry supplies. 
The market supply is the sum of the two individual supplies.
The graph in Figure 6 shows the supply curves that correspond to the sup-
ply schedules. As with demand curves, we sum the individual supply curves 
­horizontally to obtain the market supply curve. That is, to find the total quantity 
supplied at any price, we add the individual quantities, which are found on the 
horizontal axis of the individual supply curves. The market supply curve shows 
how the total quantity supplied varies as the price of the good varies, holding 
constant all the other factors beyond price that influence producers’ decisions 
about how much to sell.
4-3c Shifts in the Supply Curve
Because the market supply curve is drawn holding other things constant, when 
one of these factors changes, the supply curve shifts. For example, suppose the 
price of sugar falls. Sugar is an input into the production of ice cream, so the fall in 
the price of sugar makes selling ice cream more profitable. This raises the supply 
of ice cream: At any given price, sellers are now willing to produce a larger quan-
tity. The supply curve for ice cream shifts to the right.
Figure 7 illustrates shifts in supply. Any change that raises quantity supplied at 
every price, such as a fall in the price of sugar, shifts the supply curve to the right 
and is called an increase in supply. Similarly, any change that reduces the quantity 
supplied at every price shifts the supply curve to the left and is called a decrease in 
supply.
There are many variables that can shift the supply curve. Here are some of the 
most important.
Input Prices  To produce their output of ice cream, sellers use various inputs: 
cream, sugar, flavoring, ice-cream machines, the buildings in which the ice cream 
is made, and the labor of workers to mix the ingredients and operate the machines. 
When the price of one or more of these inputs rises, producing ice cream is less 
profitable, and firms supply less ice cream. If input prices rise substantially, a firm 
FIGURE 7
Shifts in the Supply Curve
Any change that raises the quantity 
that sellers wish to produce at any 
given price shifts the supply curve to 
the right. Any change that lowers the 
quantity that sellers wish to produce 
at any given price shifts the supply 
curve to the left.

HOW MARKETS WORK
might shut down and supply no ice cream at all. Thus, the supply of a good is 
negatively related to the price of the inputs used to make the good.
Technology  The technology for turning inputs into ice cream is another deter-
minant of supply. The invention of the mechanized ice-cream machine, for exam-
ple, reduced the amount of labor necessary to make ice cream. By reducing firms’ 
costs, the advance in technology raised the supply of ice cream.
Expectations  The amount of ice cream a firm supplies today may depend on its 
expectations about the future. For example, if a firm expects the price of ice cream 
to rise in the future, it will put some of its current production into storage and sup-
ply less to the market today.
Number of Sellers  In addition to the preceding factors, which influence the 
behavior of individual sellers, market supply depends on the number of these 
sellers. If Ben or Jerry were to retire from the ice-cream business, the supply in the 
market would fall.
Summary  The supply curve shows what happens to the quantity supplied of 
a good when its price varies, holding constant all the other variables that influ-
ence sellers. When one of these other variables changes, the supply curve shifts. 
Table 2 lists the variables that influence how much producers choose to sell of 
a good.
Once again, to remember whether you need to shift or move along the sup-
ply curve, keep in mind that a curve shifts only when there is a change in a 
relevant variable that is not named on either axis. The price is on the vertical 
axis, so a change in price represents a movement along the supply curve. By 
contrast, because input prices, technology, expectations, and the number of sell-
ers are not measured on either axis, a change in one of these variables shifts the 
supply curve.
Variables That Influence Sellers
This table lists the variables that 
affect how much producers choose 
to sell of any good. Notice the 
special role that the price of the 
good plays: A change in the good’s 
price represents a movement along 
the supply curve, whereas a change 
in one of the other variables shifts 
the supply curve.

CHAPTER 4  THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
77
4-4 Supply and Demand Together
Having analyzed supply and demand separately, we now combine them to see 
how they determine the price and quantity of a good sold in a market.
4-4a Equilibrium
Figure 8 shows the market supply curve and market demand curve together. No-
tice that there is one point at which the supply and demand curves intersect. This 
point is called the market’s equilibrium. The price at this intersection is called the 
equilibrium price, and the quantity is called the equilibrium quantity. Here the 
equilibrium price is $2.00 per cone, and the equilibrium quantity is 7 ice-cream 
cones. 
The dictionary defines the word equilibrium as a situation in which various 
forces are in balance—and this also describes a market’s equilibrium. At the equi-
librium price, the quantity of the good that buyers are willing and able to buy exactly 
balances the quantity that sellers are willing and able to sell. The equilibrium price is 
sometimes called the market-clearing price because, at this price, everyone in the 
market has been satisfied: Buyers have bought all they want to buy, and sellers 
have sold all they want to sell. 
The actions of buyers and sellers naturally move markets toward the equilib-
rium of supply and demand. To see why, consider what happens when the mar-
ket price is not equal to the equilibrium price.
Suppose first that the market price is above the equilibrium price, as in panel (a)  
of Figure 9. At a price of $2.50 per cone, the quantity of the good supplied 
(10 cones) exceeds the quantity demanded (4 cones). There is a surplus of the 
good: Suppliers are unable to sell all they want at the going price. A surplus is 
sometimes called a situation of excess supply. When there is a surplus in the ice-
cream market, sellers of ice cream find their freezers increasingly full of ice cream 
they would like to sell but cannot. They respond to the surplus by cutting their 
FIGURE 8
The Equilibrium of Supply 
and Demand
The equilibrium is found 
where the supply and de-
mand curves intersect. At 
the equilibrium price, the 
quantity supplied equals the 
quantity demanded. Here the 
equilibrium price is $2.00: 
At this price, 7 ice-cream 
cones are supplied and 7 ice-
cream cones are demanded.

HOW MARKETS WORK
prices. Falling prices, in turn, increase the quantity demanded and decrease the 
quantity supplied. These changes represent movements along the supply and 
demand curves, not shifts in the curves. Prices continue to fall until the market 
reaches the equilibrium.
Suppose now that the market price is below the equilibrium price, as in panel (b)  
of Figure 9. In this case, the price is $1.50 per cone, and the quantity of the good 
demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. There is a shortage of the good: 
­Demanders are unable to buy all they want at the going price. A shortage is some-
times called a situation of excess demand. When a shortage occurs in the ice-cream 
market, buyers have to wait in long lines for a chance to buy one of the few cones 
available. With too many buyers chasing too few goods, sellers can respond to the 
shortage by raising their prices without losing sales. These price increases cause 
the quantity demanded to fall and the quantity supplied to rise. Once again, these 
changes represent movements along the supply and demand curves, and they 
move the market toward the equilibrium.
Thus, regardless of whether the price starts off too high or too low, the activi-
ties of the many buyers and sellers automatically push the market price toward 
the equilibrium price. Once the market reaches its equilibrium, all buyers and 
sellers are satisfied, and there is no upward or downward pressure on the price. 
How quickly equilibrium is reached varies from market to market depending 
on how quickly prices adjust. In most free markets, surpluses and shortages are 
FIGURE 9
In panel (a), there is a surplus. Because the market price of $2.50 is above the equilibrium 
price, the quantity supplied (10 cones) exceeds the quantity demanded (4 cones). Suppliers 
try to increase sales by cutting the price of a cone, and this moves the price toward its equi-
librium level. In panel (b), there is a shortage. Because the market price of $1.50 is below 
the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded (10 cones) exceeds the quantity supplied  
(4 cones). With too many buyers chasing too few goods, suppliers can take advantage of the 
shortage by raising the price. Hence, in both cases, the price adjustment moves the market 
toward the equilibrium of supply and demand.

only temporary because prices eventually move toward their equilibrium levels. 
­Indeed, this phenomenon is so pervasive that it is called the law of supply and 
demand: The price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quan-
tity demanded for that good into balance.
4-4b Three Steps to Analyzing Changes 
in Equilibrium
So far, we have seen how supply and demand together determine a market’s equi-
librium, which in turn determines the price and quantity of the good that buyers 
purchase and sellers produce. The equilibrium price and quantity depend on the 
position of the supply and demand curves. When some event shifts one of these 
curves, the equilibrium in the market changes, resulting in a new price and a new 
quantity exchanged between buyers and sellers. 
When analyzing how some event affects the equilibrium in a market, we pro-
ceed in three steps. First, we decide whether the event shifts the supply curve, 
the demand curve, or, in some cases, both curves. Second, we decide whether the 
curve shifts to the right or to the left. Third, we use the supply-and-demand dia-
gram to compare the initial and the new equilibrium, which shows how the shift 
affects the equilibrium price and quantity. Table 3 summarizes these three steps. 
To see how this recipe is used, let’s consider various events that might affect the 
market for ice cream.
Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Demand ­
Suppose that one summer the weather is very hot. How does this event affect the 
market for ice cream? To answer this question, let’s follow our three steps.
1.	 The hot weather affects the demand curve by changing people’s taste for 
ice cream. That is, the weather changes the amount of ice cream that people 
want to buy at any given price. The supply curve is unchanged because the 
weather does not directly affect the firms that sell ice cream. 
2.	 Because hot weather makes people want to eat more ice cream, the demand 
curve shifts to the right. Figure 10 shows this increase in demand as a shift 
in the demand curve from D1 to D2. This shift indicates that the quantity of 
ice cream demanded is higher at every price.
3.	 At the old price of $2, there is now an excess demand for ice cream, and this 
shortage induces firms to raise the price. As Figure 10 shows, the increase 
in demand raises the equilibrium price from $2.00 to $2.50 and the equilib-
rium quantity from 7 to 10 cones. In other words, the hot weather increases 
the price of ice cream and the quantity of ice cream sold.

PART II	
HOW MARKETS WORK
Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves  Notice that when hot 
weather increases the demand for ice cream and drives up the price, the quantity 
of ice cream that firms supply rises, even though the supply curve remains the 
same. In this case, economists say there has been an increase in “quantity sup-
plied” but no change in “supply.” 
Supply refers to the position of the supply curve, whereas the quantity supplied 
refers to the amount suppliers wish to sell. In this example, supply does not change 
because the weather does not alter firms’ desire to sell at any given price. Instead, 
the hot weather alters consumers’ desire to buy at any given price and thereby 
shifts the demand curve to the right. The increase in demand causes the equilib-
rium price to rise. When the price rises, the quantity supplied rises. This increase 
in quantity supplied is represented by the movement along the supply curve.
To summarize, a shift in the supply curve is called a “change in supply,” and 
a shift in the demand curve is called a “change in demand.” A movement along a 
fixed supply curve is called a “change in the quantity supplied,” and a movement 
along a fixed demand curve is called a “change in the quantity demanded.”
Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Supply 
Suppose that during another summer, a hurricane destroys part of the sugarcane 
crop and drives up the price of sugar. How does this event affect the market for ice 
cream? Once again, to answer this question, we follow our three steps. 
1.	 The change in the price of sugar, an input for making ice cream, affects the 
supply curve. By raising the costs of production, it reduces the amount of 
ice cream that firms produce and sell at any given price. The demand curve 
does not change because the higher cost of inputs does not directly affect the 
amount of ice cream households wish to buy. 
FIGURE 10
How an Increase in Demand 
­Affects the Equilibrium
An event that raises quantity 
­demanded at any given price 
shifts the demand curve to the 
right. The equilibrium price 
and the equilibrium quantity 
both rise. Here an abnormally 
hot summer causes buyers to 
demand more ice cream. The 
demand curve shifts from D1 to 
D2, which causes the equilib-
rium price to rise from $2.00 
to $2.50 and the equilibrium 
quantity to rise from 7 to 
10 cones.

CHAPTER 4  THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND

2.	 The supply curve shifts to the left because, at every price, the total amount 
that firms are willing and able to sell is reduced. Figure 11 illustrates this de-
crease in supply as a shift in the supply curve from S1 to S2.
3.	 At the old price of $2, there is now an excess demand for ice cream, and this 
shortage causes firms to raise the price. As Figure 11 shows, the shift in the 
supply curve raises the equilibrium price from $2.00 to $2.50 and lowers the 
equilibrium quantity from 7 to 4 cones. As a result of the sugar price increase, 
the price of ice cream rises, and the quantity of ice cream sold falls.
Example: Shifts in Both Supply and Demand  Now suppose that a heat wave 
and a hurricane occur during the same summer. To analyze this combination of 
events, we again follow our three steps. 
1.	 We determine that both curves must shift. The hot weather affects the de-
mand curve because it alters the amount of ice cream that households want 
to buy at any given price. At the same time, when the hurricane drives up 
sugar prices, it alters the supply curve for ice cream because it changes the 
amount of ice cream that firms want to sell at any given price.
2.	 The curves shift in the same directions as they did in our previous analysis: 
The demand curve shifts to the right, and the supply curve shifts to the left. 
Figure 12 illustrates these shifts.
3.	 As Figure 12 shows, two possible outcomes might result depending on the rel-
ative size of the demand and supply shifts. In both cases, the equilibrium price 
rises. In panel (a), where demand increases substantially while supply falls just 
a little, the equilibrium quantity also rises. By contrast, in panel (b), where sup-
ply falls substantially while demand rises just a little, the equilibrium quantity 
falls. Thus, these events certainly raise the price of ice cream, but their impact 
on the amount of ice cream sold is ambiguous (that is, it could go either way).
FIGURE 11
How a Decrease in Supply Affects 
the Equilibrium
An event that reduces quantity sup-
plied at any given price shifts the 
supply curve to the left. The equilib-
rium price rises, and the equilibrium 
quantity falls. Here an increase in 
the price of sugar (an input) causes 
sellers to supply less ice cream. The 
supply curve shifts from S1 to S2, 
which causes the equilibrium price 
of ice cream to rise from $2.00 to 
$2.50 and the equilibrium quantity 
to fall from 7 to 4 cones.

Summary  We have just seen three examples of how to use supply and demand 
curves to analyze a change in equilibrium. Whenever an event shifts the supply 
curve, the demand curve, or perhaps both curves, you can use these tools to pre-
dict how the event will alter the price and quantity sold in equilibrium. Table 4 
shows the predicted outcome for any combination of shifts in the two curves. To

4-5 Conclusion: How Prices Allocate Resources
This chapter has analyzed supply and demand in a single market. Although our 
discussion has centered on the market for ice cream, the lessons learned here ap-
ply in most other markets as well. Whenever you go to a store to buy something, 
you are contributing to the demand for that item. Whenever you look for a job, 
you are contributing to the supply of labor services. Because supply and demand 
are such pervasive economic phenomena, the model of supply and demand is a 
powerful tool for analysis. We will be using this model repeatedly in the follow-
ing chapters.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that markets are 
usually a good way to organize economic activity. Although it is still too early to 
judge whether market outcomes are good or bad, in this chapter we have begun 
to see how markets work. In any economic system, scarce resources have to be 
allocated among competing uses. Market economies harness the forces of supply 
and demand to serve that end. Supply and demand together determine the prices 
of the economy’s many different goods and services; prices in turn are the signals 
that guide the allocation of resources. 
For example, consider the allocation of beachfront land. Because the amount of 
this land is limited, not everyone can enjoy the luxury of living by the beach. Who 
gets this resource? The answer is whoever is willing and able to pay the price. 
The price of beachfront land adjusts until the quantity of land demanded exactly 
balances the quantity supplied. Thus, in market economies, prices are the mecha-
nism for rationing scarce resources.
Similarly, prices determine who produces each good and how much is pro-
duced. For instance, consider farming. Because we need food to survive, it is 
crucial that some people work on farms. What determines who is a farmer and 
who is not? In a free society, there is no government planning agency making 
this decision and ensuring an adequate supply of food. Instead, the allocation of 
workers to farms is based on the job decisions of millions of workers. This decen-
tralized system works well because these decisions depend on prices. The prices 
of food and the wages of farmworkers (the price of their labor) adjust to ensure 
that enough people choose to be farmers.
If a person had never seen a market economy in action, the whole idea might 
seem preposterous. Economies are enormous groups of people engaged in a mul-
titude of interdependent activities. What prevents decentralized decision mak-
ing from degenerating into chaos? What coordinates the actions of the millions of 
people with their varying abilities and desires? What ensures that what needs to 
be done is in fact done? The answer, in a word, is prices. If an invisible hand guides 
market economies, as Adam Smith famously suggested, then the price system is 
the baton that the invisible hand uses to conduct the economic orchestra.

HOW MARKETS WORK
Price Increases after 
Disasters
When a disaster such as a hurricane strikes a region, many goods 
experience an increase in demand or a decrease in supply, putting 
upward pressure on prices. Policymakers often object to these price 
hikes, but this opinion piece endorses the market’s natural response.
In the News
Is Price Gouging  
Reverse Looting?
By John Carney
F
our dollars for a can of coke. Five hundred 
dollars a night for a hotel in downtown 
Brooklyn. A pair of D-batteries for $6.99. 
These are just a few of the examples of 
price hikes I or friends of mine have person-
ally come across in the run-up and aftermath 
of hurricane Sandy. Price gouging, as this is 
often called, is a common occurrence during 
emergencies. 
Price gouging around natural disasters is 
one of the things politicians on the left and 
right agree is a terrible, no good, very bad thing. 
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman 
sent out a press release warning “against 
price inflation of necessary goods and services 
during hurricane Sandy.” New Jersey Governor 
Chris Christie issued a “forceful reminder” that 
price gouging “will result in significant penal-
ties.” Hotlines have been established to allow 
consumers to report gouging. 
New Jersey’s law is very specific. Price 
increases of more than 10 percent during a 
declared state of emergency are considered 
excessive. A New Jersey gas station paid a 
$50,000 fine last year for hiking gasoline 
prices by 16 percent during tropical storm 
Irene. 
New York’s law may be even stricter. 
­According to AG Schneiderman’s release, 
all price increases on “necessary goods and 
items” count as gouging. 
“General Business Law prohibits such 
increase in costs of essential items like 
food, water, gas, generators, batteries and 
flashlights, and services like transportation, 
during natural disasters or other events that 
disrupt the market,” the NY AG release said. 
These laws are built on the quite conven-
tional view that it is unethical for a business 
to take advantage of a disaster in pursuit 
of profits. It just seems wrong for business 
owners to make money on the misery of their 
neighbors. Merchants earning larger profits 
because of a disaster seem to be rewarded for 
doing nothing more than raising their prices. 
 “It’s reverse looting,” a neighbor of mine 
in Brooklyn said about the price of batteries 
at a local electronic store. 
Unfortunately, ethics runs into economics 
in a way that can make these laws positively 
harmful. Price gouging can occur only when 
there is a shortage of the goods in demand. 
If there were no shortage, normal market pro-
cesses would prevent sudden price spikes. 
A deli owner charging $4 for a can of Pepsi 
would discover he was just driving customers 
to the deli a block away, which charges a buck. 
But when everyone suddenly starts buy-
ing batteries or bottles of water for fear of 
a blackout, shortages can arise. Sometimes

Economists use the model of supply and demand to 
analyze competitive markets. In a competitive market, 
there are many buyers and sellers, each of whom has 
little or no influence on the market price.
•	
The demand curve shows how the quantity of a good 
demanded depends on the price. According to the law 
of demand, as the price of a good falls, the quantity 
demanded rises. Therefore, the demand curve slopes 
downward.
•	
In addition to price, other determinants of how much 
consumers want to buy include income, the prices of 
substitutes and complements, tastes, expectations, and 
the number of buyers. If one of these factors changes, 
the demand curve shifts.

The supply curve shows how the quantity of a good 
supplied depends on the price. According to the law 
of supply, as the price of a good rises, the quantity sup-
plied rises. Therefore, the supply curve slopes upward.

CHAPTER 4  THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
85
there simply is not enough of a particular 
good to satisfy a sharp spike in demand. 
And so the question arises: how do we decide 
which customers get the batteries, the gro-
ceries, the gasoline? 
We could hold a lottery. Perhaps people 
could receive a ticket at the grocery store. Win-
ners would get to shop at the usual prices. Los-
ers would just go hungry. Or, more likely, they 
would be forced to buy the food away from the 
lottery winners—at elevated prices no doubt, 
since no one would buy food just to sell it at 
the same price. So the gouging would just pass 
from merchant to lottery winning customer. 
We could have some sort of rationing pro-
gram. Each person could be assigned a por-
tion of the necessary goods according to their 
household need. This is something the U.S. 
resorted to during World War II. The problem 
is that rationing requires an immense amount 
of planning—and an impossible level of 
knowledge. The rationing bureaucrat would 
have to know precisely how much of each 
good was available in a given area and how 
many people would need it. Good luck getting 
that in place as a hurricane bears down on 
your city. 
We could simply sell goods on a first 
come, first serve basis. This is, in fact, what 
anti-gouging laws encourage. The result is 
all too familiar. People hoard goods. Store 
shelves are emptied. And you have to won-
der, why is a first to the register race a fairer 
system than the alternative of market prices? 
Speed seems a poor proxy for justice. 
Allowing prices to rise at times of extreme 
demand discourages overconsumption. Peo-
ple consider their purchases more carefully. 
Instead of buying a dozen batteries (or bottles 
of water or gallons of gas), perhaps they buy 
half that. The result is that goods under ex-
treme demand are available to more custom-
ers. The market process actually results in 
a more equitable distribution than the anti-
gouging laws. 
Once we understand this, it’s easy to see 
that merchants aren’t really profiting from di-
saster. They are profiting from managing their 
prices, which has the socially beneficial effect 
of broadening distribution and discourag-
ing hoarding. In short, they are being justly 
rewarded for performing an important public 
service. 
One objection is that a system of free-
floating, legal gouging would allow the 
wealthy to buy everything and leave the poor 
out altogether. But this concern is overrated. 
For the most part, price hikes during disasters 
do not actually put necessary goods and ser-
vices out of reach of even the poorest people. 
They just put the budgets of the poor under 
additional strain. This is a problem better re-
solved through transfer payments to alleviate 
the household budgetary effects of the prices 
after the fact, rather than trying to control the 
price in the first place…. 
Instead of cracking down on price gougers, 
we should be using our experience of shortages 
during this time of crisis to spark a reform of 
our counter-productive laws. Next time disaster 
strikes, we should hope for a bit more gouging 
and a lot fewer empty store shelves. 
Would you pay $4 for this?

price, the quantity demanded equals the quantity 
supplied. 
•	
The behavior of buyers and sellers naturally drives 
markets toward their equilibrium. When the market 
price is above the equilibrium price, there is a surplus 
of the good, which causes the market price to fall. 
When the market price is below the equilibrium price, 
there is a shortage, which causes the market price to 
rise. 
•	
To analyze how any event influences a market, we use 
the supply-and-demand diagram to examine how the 
event affects the equilibrium price and quantity. To do 
this, we follow three steps. First, we decide whether 
the event shifts the supply curve or the demand curve 
(or both). Second, we decide in which direction the 
curve shifts. Third, we compare the new equilibrium 
with the initial equilibrium.
•	
In market economies, prices are the signals that guide 
economic decisions and thereby allocate scarce re-
sources. For every good in the economy, the price 
ensures that supply and demand are in balance. The 
equilibrium price then determines how much of the 
good buyers choose to consume and how much sellers 
choose to produce.

Elasticity and 
Its Application
I
magine that some event drives up the price of gasoline in the United States. 
It could be a war in the Middle East that disrupts the world supply of oil, a boom-
ing Chinese economy that boosts the world demand for oil, or a new tax on gaso-
line passed by Congress. How would U.S. consumers respond to the higher price?
It is easy to answer this question in broad fashion: Consumers would buy less. 
That follows from the law of demand that we learned in the previous chapter. But 
you might want a precise answer. By how much would consumption of gasoline 
fall? This question can be answered using a concept called elasticity, which we 
develop in this chapter.
Elasticity is a measure of how much buyers and sellers respond to 
changes in market conditions. When studying how some event or policy 
­affects a market, we can discuss not only the direction of the effects but their 
magnitude as well. Elasticity is useful in many applications, as we see toward 
the end of this chapter.

Part II	
How Markets Work
Before proceeding, however, you might be curious about the answer to the 
gasoline question. Many studies have examined consumers’ response to gaso-
line prices, and they typically find that the quantity demanded responds more in 
the long run than it does in the short run. A 10 percent increase in gasoline prices 
­reduces gasoline consumption by about 2.5 percent after a year and about 6 per-
cent after five years. About half of the long-run reduction in quantity demanded 
arises because people drive less, and half arises because they switch to more fuel-
efficient cars. Both responses are reflected in the demand curve and its elasticity.
5-1 The Elasticity of Demand
When we introduced demand in Chapter 4, we noted that consumers usually 
buy more of a good when its price is lower, when their incomes are higher, when 
the prices of its substitutes are higher, or when the prices of its complements are 
lower. Our discussion of demand was qualitative, not quantitative. That is, we 
discussed the direction in which quantity demanded moves but not the size of the 
change. To measure how much consumers respond to changes in these variables, 
economists use the concept of elasticity. 
5-1a The Price Elasticity of Demand 
and Its Determinants
The law of demand states that a fall in the price of a good raises the quantity 
demanded. The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity 
­demanded responds to a change in price. Demand for a good is said to be elastic 
if the quantity demanded responds substantially to changes in the price. Demand 
is said to be inelastic if the quantity demanded responds only slightly to changes 
in the price.
The price elasticity of demand for any good measures how willing consum-
ers are to buy less of the good as its price rises. Because a demand curve reflects 
the many economic, social, and psychological forces that shape consumer prefer-
ences, there is no simple, universal rule for what determines a demand curve’s 
elasticity. Based on experience, however, we can state some rules of thumb about 
what influences the price elasticity of demand.
Availability of Close Substitutes  Goods with close substitutes tend to have more 
elastic demand because it is easier for consumers to switch from that good to others. 
For example, butter and margarine are easily substitutable. A small increase in the 
price of butter, assuming the price of margarine is held fixed, causes the quantity of 
butter sold to fall by a large amount. By contrast, because eggs are a food without a 
close substitute, the demand for eggs is less elastic than the ­demand for butter. A small 
increase in the price of eggs does not cause a sizable drop in the quantity of eggs sold.
Necessities versus Luxuries  Necessities tend to have inelastic demands, where-
as luxuries have elastic demands. When the price of a doctor’s visit rises, people will 
not dramatically reduce the number of times they go to the doctor, ­although they 
might go somewhat less often. By contrast, when the price of sailboats rises, the quan-
tity of sailboats demanded falls substantially. The reason is that most people view 
doctor visits as a necessity and sailboats as a luxury. Whether a good is a necessity or 
a luxury depends not on the intrinsic properties of the good but on the preferences 
of the buyer. For avid sailors with little concern about their health, sailboats might 
be a necessity with inelastic demand and doctor visits a luxury with elastic demand.

CHAPTER 5  ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
91
Definition of the Market   The elasticity of demand in any market depends on 
how we draw the boundaries of the market. Narrowly defined markets tend to 
have more elastic demand than broadly defined markets because it is easier to find 
close substitutes for narrowly defined goods. For example, food, a broad category, 
has a fairly inelastic demand because there are no good substitutes for food. Ice 
cream, a narrower category, has a more elastic demand because it is easy to sub-
stitute other desserts for ice cream. Vanilla ice cream, a very narrow category, has 
a very elastic demand because other flavors of ice cream are almost perfect substi-
tutes for vanilla. 
Time Horizon  Goods tend to have more elastic demand over longer time 
­horizons. When the price of gasoline rises, the quantity of gasoline demanded falls 
only slightly in the first few months. Over time, however, people buy more fuel-
efficient cars, switch to public transportation, and move closer to where they work. 
Within several years, the quantity of gasoline demanded falls more substantially.
5-1b Computing the Price Elasticity of Demand
Now that we have discussed the price elasticity of demand in general terms, let’s 
be more precise about how it is measured. Economists compute the price elastic-
ity of demand as the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the 
percentage change in the price. That is, 
Price elasticity of demand 5
Percentage change in quantity demanded
Percentage change in price
.
For example, suppose that a 10 percent increase in the price of an ice-cream cone 
causes the amount of ice cream you buy to fall by 20 percent. We calculate your 
elasticity of demand as 
Price elasticity of demand 5
20 percent
10 percent 5 2.
In this example, the elasticity is 2, reflecting that the change in the quantity 
­demanded is proportionately twice as large as the change in the price.
Because the quantity demanded of a good is negatively related to its price, 
the percentage change in quantity will always have the opposite sign as the 
percentage change in price. In this example, the percentage change in price is a 
positive 10 percent (reflecting an increase), and the percentage change in quantity 
­demanded is a negative 20 percent (reflecting a decrease). For this reason, price 
elasticities of demand are sometimes reported as negative numbers. In this book, 
we follow the common practice of dropping the minus sign and reporting all price 
elasticities of demand as positive numbers. (Mathematicians call this the absolute 
value.) With this convention, a larger price elasticity implies a greater responsive-
ness of quantity demanded to changes in price.
5-1c The Midpoint Method: A Better Way to 
Calculate Percentage Changes and Elasticities
If you try calculating the price elasticity of demand between two points on a 
­demand curve, you will quickly notice an annoying problem: The elasticity from 
point A to point B seems different from the elasticity from point B to point A. For 
example, consider these numbers:
Point A:
  Price 5 $4
  Quantity 5 120
Point B:
  Price 5 $6
  Quantity 5 80

How Markets Work
Going from point A to point B, the price rises by 50 percent and the quantity falls by 
33 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 33/50, or 0.66. By con-
trast, going from point B to point A, the price falls by 33 percent and the quantity 
rises by 50 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 50/33, or 1.5. This 
difference arises because the percentage changes are calculated from a different base.
One way to avoid this problem is to use the midpoint method for calculating elas-
ticities. The standard procedure for computing a percentage change is to ­divide 
the change by the initial level. By contrast, the midpoint method computes a per-
centage change by dividing the change by the midpoint (or average) of the initial 
and final levels. For instance, $5 is the midpoint between $4 and $6. ­Therefore, ac-
cording to the midpoint method, a change from $4 to $6 is considered a 40 ­percent 
rise because (6 − 4) / 5 × 100 = 40. Similarly, a change from $6 to $4 is considered 
a 40 percent fall.
Because the midpoint method gives the same answer regardless of the direc-
tion of change, it is often used when calculating the price elasticity of demand 
between two points. In our example, the midpoint between point A and point B is:
Midpoint:         Price 5 $5        Quantity 5 100
According to the midpoint method, when going from point A to point B, the price 
rises by 40 percent and the quantity falls by 40 percent. Similarly, when going 
from point B to point A, the price falls by 40 percent and the quantity rises by 40 
percent. In both directions, the price elasticity of demand equals 1. 
The following formula expresses the midpoint method for calculating the price 
elasticity of demand between two points, denoted (Q1, P1) and (Q2, P2):
Price elasticity of demand 5 (Q2 2 Q1)/3(Q2 1 Q1)/24
(P2 2 P1)/3(P2 1 P1)/24 .
The numerator is the percentage change in quantity computed using the mid-
point method, and the denominator is the percentage change in price computed 
using the midpoint method. If you ever need to calculate elasticities, you should 
use this formula.
In this book, however, we rarely perform such calculations. For most of our 
purposes, what elasticity represents—the responsiveness of quantity demanded 
to a change in price—is more important than how it is calculated.
5-1d The Variety of Demand Curves 
Economists classify demand curves according to their elasticity. Demand is con-
sidered elastic when the elasticity is greater than 1, which means the quantity 
moves proportionately more than the price. Demand is considered inelastic when 
the elasticity is less than 1, which means the quantity moves proportionately 
less than the price. If the elasticity is exactly 1, the percentage change in quantity 
equals the percentage change in price, and demand is said to have unit elasticity. 
Because the price elasticity of demand measures how much quantity de-
manded responds to changes in the price, it is closely related to the slope of the 
demand curve. The following rule of thumb is a useful guide: The flatter the de-
mand curve that passes through a given point, the greater the price elasticity of 
demand. The steeper the demand curve that passes through a given point, the 
smaller the price elasticity of demand.
Figure 1 shows five cases. In the extreme case of a zero elasticity, shown in 
panel (a), demand is perfectly inelastic, and the demand curve is vertical. In this

case, regardless of the price, the quantity demanded stays the same. As the elas-
ticity rises, the demand curve gets flatter and flatter, as shown in panels (b), (c), 
and (d). At the opposite extreme, shown in panel (e), demand is perfectly elastic. 
This occurs as the price elasticity of demand approaches infinity and the demand 
curve becomes horizontal, reflecting the fact that very small changes in the price 
lead to huge changes in the quantity demanded.
Finally, if you have trouble keeping straight the terms elastic and inelastic, here’s 
a memory trick for you: Inelastic curves, such as in panel (a) of Figure 1, look like 
the letter I. This is not a deep insight, but it might help you on your next exam.
5-1e Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity 
of Demand
When studying changes in supply or demand in a market, one variable we of-
ten want to study is total revenue, the amount paid by buyers and received by 
sellers of a good. In any market, total revenue is P × Q, the price of the good 
times the quantity of the good sold. We can show total revenue graphically, as in 
­Figure 2. The height of the box under the demand curve is P, and the width is Q. 
The area of this box, P × Q, equals the total revenue in this market. In Figure 2, 
where P = $4 and Q = 100, total revenue is $4 × 100, or $400.
How does total revenue change as one moves along the demand curve? The 
answer depends on the price elasticity of demand. If demand is inelastic, as in 
panel (a) of Figure 3, then an increase in the price causes an increase in total rev-
enue. Here an increase in price from $4 to $5 causes the quantity demanded to fall 
from 100 to 90, so total revenue rises from $400 to $450. An increase in price raises 
P × Q because the fall in Q is proportionately smaller than the rise in P. In other 
A Few Elasticities from  
the Real World
W
e have talked about what elasticity means, what determines it, 
and how it is calculated. Beyond these general ideas, you might 
ask for a specific number. How much, precisely, does the price of a par-
ticular good influence the quantity demanded?
To answer such a question, economists collect data from market 
outcomes and apply statistical techniques to estimate the price elas-
ticity of demand. Here are some price elasticities of demand, obtained 
from various studies, for a range of goods:
Eggs
0.1
Healthcare
0.2
Rice
0.5
Housing
0.7
Beef
1.6
Restaurant Meals
2.3
Mountain Dew
4.4
These kinds of numbers are 
fun to think about, and they 
can be useful when comparing 
markets.
Nonetheless, one should take these estimates with a grain of salt. 
One reason is that the statistical techniques used to obtain them re-
quire some assumptions about the world, and these assumptions might 
not be true in practice. (The details of these techniques are beyond the 
scope of this book, but you will encounter them if you take a course 
in econometrics.) Another reason is that the price elasticity of demand 
need not be the same at all points on a demand curve, as we will see 
shortly in the case of a linear demand curve. For both reasons, you 
should not be surprised if different studies report different price elas-
ticities of demand for the same good.

The impact of a price change on total revenue (the product of price and quantity) depends on 
the elasticity of demand. In panel (a), the demand curve is inelastic. In this case, an ­increase 
in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded that is proportionately smaller, so total 
revenue increases. Here an increase in the price from $4 to $5 causes the quantity demanded 
to fall from 100 to 90. Total revenue rises from $400 to $450. In panel (b), the demand curve 
is elastic. In this case, an increase in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded that is 
proportionately larger, so total revenue decreases. Here an increase in the price from $4 to $5 
causes the quantity demanded to fall from 100 to 70. Total revenue falls from $400 to $350.

words, the extra revenue from selling units at a higher price (represented by area 
A in Figure 3) more than offsets the decline in revenue from selling fewer units 
(represented by area B).
We obtain the opposite result if demand is elastic: An increase in the price 
causes a decrease in total revenue. In panel (b) of Figure 3, for instance, when 
the price rises from $4 to $5, the quantity demanded falls from 100 to 70, so total 
revenue falls from $400 to $350. Because demand is elastic, the reduction in the 
quantity demanded is so great that it more than offsets the increase in the price. 
That is, an increase in price reduces P × Q because the fall in Q is proportionately 
greater than the rise in P. In this case, the extra revenue from selling units at a 
higher price (area A) is smaller than the decline in revenue from selling fewer 
units (area B).
The examples in this figure illustrate some general rules:
•	 When demand is inelastic (a price elasticity less than 1), price and total 
­revenue move in the same direction: If the price increases, total revenue also 
increases.
•	 When demand is elastic (a price elasticity greater than 1), price and total reve-
nue move in opposite directions: If the price increases, total revenue decreases.
•	 If demand is unit elastic (a price elasticity exactly equal to 1), total revenue 
­remains constant when the price changes.
5-1f Elasticity and Total Revenue along 
a Linear Demand Curve
Let’s examine how elasticity varies along a linear demand curve, as shown in 
­Figure 4. We know that a straight line has a constant slope. Slope is defined as 
“rise over run,” which here is the ratio of the change in price (“rise”) to the change 
in quantity (“run”). This particular demand curve’s slope is constant because each 
$1 increase in price causes the same 2-unit decrease in the quantity demanded. 
Even though the slope of a linear demand curve is constant, the elasticity is not. 
This is true because the slope is the ratio of changes in the two variables, whereas 
the elasticity is the ratio of percentage changes in the two variables. You can see this 
by looking at the table in Figure 4, which shows the demand schedule for the lin-
ear demand curve in the graph. The table uses the midpoint method to calculate 
the price elasticity of demand. The table illustrates the following: At points with a 
low price and high quantity, the demand curve is inelastic. At points with a high price and 
low quantity, the demand curve is elastic. 
The explanation for this fact comes from the arithmetic of percentage changes. 
When the price is low and consumers are buying a lot, a $1 price increase and  
2-unit reduction in quantity demanded constitute a large percentage increase in 
the price and a small percentage decrease in quantity demanded, resulting in a 
small elasticity. By contrast, when the price is high and consumers are not buying 
much, the same $1 price increase and 2-unit reduction in quantity demanded con-
stitute a small percentage increase in the price and a large percentage decrease in 
quantity demanded, resulting in a large elasticity.
The table also presents total revenue at each point on the demand curve. These 
numbers illustrate the relationship between total revenue and elasticity. When the 
price is $1, for instance, demand is inelastic and a price increase to $2 raises total 
revenue. When the price is $5, demand is elastic and a price increase to $6 reduces 
total revenue. Between $3 and $4, demand is exactly unit elastic and total revenue 
is the same at these two prices.

The linear demand curve illustrates that the price elasticity of demand need 
not be the same at all points on a demand curve. A constant elasticity is possible, 
but it is not always the case.
5-1g Other Demand Elasticities 
In addition to the price elasticity of demand, economists use other elasticities to 
describe the behavior of buyers in a market. 
The Income Elasticity of Demand  The income elasticity of demand mea-
sures how the quantity demanded changes as consumer income changes. It is cal-
culated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage 
change in income. That is,
Income elasticity of demand 5
Percentage change in quantity demanded
Percentage change in income
.
FIGURE 4
The slope of a linear demand curve is constant, but its elasticity is not. The demand schedule 
in the table was used to calculate the price elasticity of demand by the midpoint method. At 
points with a low price and high quantity, the demand curve is inelastic. At points with a high 
price and low quantity, the demand curve is elastic.

How Markets Work
As we discussed in Chapter 4, most goods are normal goods: Higher income raises 
the quantity demanded. Because quantity demanded and income move in the 
same direction, normal goods have positive income elasticities. A few goods, such 
as bus rides, are inferior goods: Higher income lowers the quantity demanded. 
­Because quantity demanded and income move in opposite directions, inferior 
goods have negative income elasticities.
Even among normal goods, income elasticities vary substantially in size. 
­Necessities, such as food and clothing, tend to have small income elasticities be-
cause consumers choose to buy some of these goods even when their incomes are 
low. Luxuries, such as caviar and diamonds, tend to have large income elasticities 
because consumers feel that they can do without these goods altogether if their 
incomes are too low. 
The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand   The cross-price elasticity of demand  
measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the 
price of another good. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity de-
manded of good 1 divided by the percentage change in the price of good 2. That is,
Cross-price elasticity of demand 5
Percentage change in quantity demanded of good 1
Percentage change in the price of good 2
.
Whether the cross-price elasticity is a positive or negative number depends 
on whether the two goods are substitutes or complements. As we discussed in 
­Chapter 4, substitutes are goods that are typically used in place of one another, such 
as hamburgers and hot dogs. An increase in hot dog prices induces people to grill 
hamburgers instead. Because the price of hot dogs and the quantity of hamburg-
ers demanded move in the same direction, the cross-price elasticity is positive. 
­Conversely, complements are goods that are typically used together, such as comput-
ers and software. In this case, the cross-price elasticity is negative, indicating that 
an increase in the price of computers reduces the quantity of software demanded.

the quantity demanded

5-2 The Elasticity of Supply
When we introduced supply in Chapter 4, we noted that producers of a good 
­offer to sell more of it when the price of the good rises. To turn from qualitative to 
quantitative statements about quantity supplied, we once again use the concept 
of elasticity.
5-2a The Price Elasticity of Supply and 
Its Determinants
The law of supply states that higher prices raise the quantity supplied. The price 
elasticity of supply measures how much the quantity supplied responds to 
changes in the price. Supply of a good is said to be elastic if the quantity supplied 
responds substantially to changes in the price. Supply is said to be inelastic if the 
quantity supplied responds only slightly to changes in the price.
The price elasticity of supply depends on the flexibility of sellers to change the 
amount of the good they produce. For example, beachfront land has an inelastic 
price elasticity of supply
a measure of how much 
the quantity supplied 
of a good responds to a 
change in the price of 
that good, computed as 
the percentage change in 
quantity supplied divided 
by the percentage change 
in price

supply because it is almost impossible to produce more of it. By contrast, manu-
factured goods, such as books, cars, and televisions, have elastic supplies because 
firms that produce them can run their factories longer in response to a higher price.
In most markets, a key determinant of the price elasticity of supply is the time 
period being considered. Supply is usually more elastic in the long run than in 
the short run. Over short periods of time, firms cannot easily change the size of 
their factories to make more or less of a good. Thus, in the short run, the quan-
tity supplied is not very responsive to the price. By contrast, over longer periods, 
firms can build new factories or close old ones. In addition, new firms can enter 
a market, and old firms can exit. Thus, in the long run, the quantity supplied can 
respond substantially to price changes.
5-2b Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply
Now that we have a general understanding about the price elasticity of supply, 
let’s be more precise. Economists compute the price elasticity of supply as the 
percentage change in the quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in 
the price. That is, 
Price elasticity of supply 5
Percentage change in quantity supplied
Percentage change in price
.
For example, suppose that an increase in the price of milk from $2.85 to $3.15 a 
gallon raises the amount that dairy farmers produce from 9,000 to 11,000 gallons 
per month. Using the midpoint method, we calculate the percentage change in 
price as
Percentage change in price 5 (3.15 2 2.85)/3.00 3 100 5 10 percent.
Similarly, we calculate the percentage change in quantity supplied as
Percentage change in quantity supplied 5 (11,000 2 9,000)/10,000 3 100 5 20 percent.
In this case, the price elasticity of supply is 
Price elasticity of supply 5
20 percent
10 percent 5 2.
In this example, the elasticity of 2 indicates that the quantity supplied changes 
proportionately twice as much as the price.
5-2c The Variety of Supply Curves
Because the price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quan-
tity supplied to the price, it is reflected in the appearance of the supply curve. 
­Figure 5 shows five cases. In the extreme case of a zero elasticity, as shown in 
panel (a), supply is perfectly inelastic and the supply curve is vertical. In this case, 
the quantity supplied is the same regardless of the price. As the elasticity rises, 
the supply curve gets flatter, which shows that the quantity supplied responds 
more to changes in the price. At the opposite extreme, shown in panel (e), supply 
is perfectly elastic. This occurs as the price elasticity of supply approaches infinity 
and the supply curve becomes horizontal, meaning that very small changes in the 
price lead to very large changes in the quantity supplied.
In some markets, the elasticity of supply is not constant but varies over the 
supply curve. Figure 6 shows a typical case for an industry in which firms have

How the Price Elasticity of Supply Can Vary
Because firms often have a maximum capacity for 
production, the elasticity of supply may be very high 
at low levels of quantity supplied and very low at high 
levels of quantity supplied. Here an increase in price 
from $3 to $4 increases the quantity supplied from 
100 to 200. Because the 67% increase in ­quantity 
supplied (computed using the midpoint method) is 
larger than the 29% increase in price, the supply 
curve is elastic in this range. By contrast, when the 
price rises from $12 to $15, the quantity supplied 
rises only from 500 to 525. Because the 5% ­increase 
in quantity supplied is smaller than the 22% increase 
in price, the supply curve is inelastic in this range.

factories with a limited capacity for production. For low levels of quantity sup-
plied, the elasticity of supply is high, indicating that firms respond substantially 
to changes in the price. In this region, firms have capacity for production that is 
not being used, such as plants and equipment that are idle for all or part of the 
day. Small increases in price make it profitable for firms to begin using this idle 
­capacity. As the quantity supplied rises, firms begin to reach capacity. Once capac-
ity is fully used, increasing production further requires the construction of new 
plants. To induce firms to incur this extra expense, the price must rise substan-
tially, so supply becomes less elastic.
Figure 6 presents a numerical example of this phenomenon. When the price 
rises from $3 to $4 (a 29 percent increase, according to the midpoint method), the 
quantity supplied rises from 100 to 200 (a 67 percent increase). Because quantity 
supplied changes proportionately more than the price, the supply curve has elas-
ticity greater than 1. By contrast, when the price rises from $12 to $15 (a 22 percent 
increase), the quantity supplied rises from 500 to 525 (a 5 percent increase). In this 
case, quantity supplied moves proportionately less than the price, so the elasticity 
is less than 1.

5-3 Three Applications of Supply, Demand, 
and Elasticity
Can good news for farming be bad news for farmers? Why did OPEC, the interna-
tional oil cartel, fail to keep the price of oil high? Does drug interdiction increase 
or decrease drug-related crime? At first, these questions might seem to have little 
in common. Yet all three questions are about markets, and all markets are subject 
to the forces of supply and demand. Here we apply the versatile tools of supply, 
demand, and elasticity to answer these seemingly complex questions.

How Markets Work
5-3a Can Good News for Farming Be Bad News 
for Farmers?
Imagine yourself as a Kansas wheat farmer. Because you earn all your income 
from selling wheat, you devote much effort to making your land as productive 
as possible. You monitor weather and soil conditions, check your fields for pests 
and disease, and study the latest advances in farm technology. You know that the 
more wheat you grow, the more you will have to sell after the harvest, and the 
higher your income and standard of living will be. 
One day, Kansas State University announces a major discovery. Researchers 
in its agronomy department have devised a new hybrid of wheat that raises the 
amount farmers can produce from each acre of land by 20 percent. How should 
you react to this news? Does this discovery make you better off or worse off than 
you were before?
Recall from Chapter 4 that we answer such questions in three steps. First, we 
examine whether the supply or demand curve shifts. Second, we consider the 
­direction in which the curve shifts. Third, we use the supply-and-demand dia-
gram to see how the market equilibrium changes.
In this case, the discovery of the new hybrid affects the supply curve. Because 
the hybrid increases the amount of wheat that can be produced on each acre of 
land, farmers are now willing to supply more wheat at any given price. In other 
words, the supply curve shifts to the right. The demand curve remains the same 
because consumers’ desire to buy wheat products at any given price is not ­affected 
by the introduction of a new hybrid. Figure 7 shows an example of such a change. 
When the supply curve shifts from S1 to S2, the quantity of wheat sold increases 
from 100 to 110 and the price of wheat falls from $3 to $2.
Does this discovery make farmers better off? As a first cut to answering this 
question, consider what happens to the total revenue received by farmers. Farm-
ers’ total revenue is P × Q, the price of the wheat times the quantity sold. The 
discovery affects farmers in two conflicting ways. The hybrid allows farmers to 
produce more wheat (Q rises), but now each bushel of wheat sells for less (P falls). 
FIGURE 7
An Increase in Supply in the Market for Wheat
When an advance in farm technology increases 
the supply of wheat from S1 to S2, the price 
of wheat falls. Because the demand for wheat 
is inelastic, the increase in the quantity sold 
from 100 to 110 is proportionately smaller 
than the decrease in the price from $3 to $2. 
As a result, farmers’ total revenue falls from 
$300 ($3 × 100) to $220 ($2 × 110).

CHAPTER 5  ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
103
Whether total revenue rises or falls depends on the elasticity of demand. In 
practice, the demand for basic foodstuffs such as wheat is usually inelastic be-
cause these items are relatively inexpensive and have few good substitutes. When 
the demand curve is inelastic, as it is in Figure 7, a decrease in price causes total 
revenue to fall. You can see this in the figure: The price of wheat falls substantially, 
whereas the quantity of wheat sold rises only slightly. Total revenue falls from 
$300 to $220. Thus, the discovery of the new hybrid lowers the total revenue that 
farmers receive from the sale of their crops. 
If farmers are made worse off by the discovery of this new hybrid, one might 
wonder why they adopt it. The answer goes to the heart of how competitive mar-
kets work. Because each farmer is only a small part of the market for wheat, she 
takes the price of wheat as given. For any given price of wheat, it is better to use 
the new hybrid to produce and sell more wheat. Yet when all farmers do this, the 
supply of wheat increases, the price falls, and farmers are worse off. 
This example may at first seem hypothetical, but it helps to explain a major 
change in the U.S. economy over the past century. Two hundred years ago, most 
Americans lived on farms. Knowledge about farm methods was sufficiently prim-
itive that most Americans had to be farmers to produce enough food to feed the 
nation’s population. Yet over time, advances in farm technology increased the 
amount of food that each farmer could produce. This increase in food supply, to-
gether with inelastic food demand, caused farm revenues to fall, which in turn 
encouraged people to leave farming.
A few numbers show the magnitude of this historic change. As recently as 1950, 
10 million people worked on farms in the United States, representing 17 percent 
of the labor force. Today, fewer than 3 million people work on farms, or 2 percent 
of the labor force. This change coincided with tremendous advances in farm pro-
ductivity: Despite the 70 percent drop in the number of farmers, U.S. farms now 
produce more than twice the output of crops and livestock that they did in 1950.
This analysis of the market for farm products also helps to explain a seeming 
paradox of public policy: Certain farm programs try to help farmers by inducing 
them not to plant crops on all of their land. The purpose of these programs is to re-
duce the supply of farm products and thereby raise prices. With inelastic demand 
for their products, farmers as a group receive greater total revenue if they supply 
a smaller crop to the market. No single farmer would choose to leave her land

fallow on her own because each takes the market price as given. But if all farmers 
do so together, they can all be better off.
When analyzing the effects of farm technology or farm policy, it is important to 
keep in mind that what is good for farmers is not necessarily good for society as a 
whole. Improvement in farm technology can be bad for farmers because it makes 
farmers increasingly unnecessary, but it is surely good for consumers who pay 
less for food. Similarly, a policy aimed at reducing the supply of farm products 
may raise the incomes of farmers, but it does so at the expense of consumers.
5-3b Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price 
of Oil High?
Many of the most disruptive events for the world’s economies over the past sev-
eral decades have originated in the world market for oil. In the 1970s, members 
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to raise 
the world price of oil to increase their incomes. These countries accomplished this 
goal by agreeing to jointly reduce the amount of oil they supplied. As a result, the 
price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) rose more than 50 percent from 1973 to 
1974. Then, a few years later, OPEC did the same thing again. From 1979 to 1981, 
the price of oil approximately doubled. 
Yet OPEC found it difficult to maintain such a high price. From 1982 to 1985, 
the price of oil steadily declined about 10 percent per year. Dissatisfaction and 
disarray soon prevailed among the OPEC countries. In 1986, cooperation among 
OPEC members completely broke down, and the price of oil plunged 45 percent. 
In 1990, the price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) was back to where it began 
in 1970, and it stayed at that low level throughout most of the 1990s. (In the first 
decade of the 21st century, the price of oil fluctuated substantially once again, but 
the main driving force was changes in world demand rather than OPEC supply 
restrictions. Early in the decade, oil demand and prices spiked up, in part because 
of a large and rapidly growing Chinese economy. Prices plunged in 2008–2009 as 
the world economy fell into a deep recession and then started rising once again as 
the world economy started to recover.) 
The OPEC episodes of the 1970s and 1980s show how supply and demand can 
behave differently in the short run and in the long run. In the short run, both 
the supply and demand for oil are relatively inelastic. Supply is inelastic because 
the quantity of known oil reserves and the capacity for oil extraction cannot be 
changed quickly. Demand is inelastic because buying habits do not respond im-
mediately to changes in price. Thus, as panel (a) of Figure 8 shows, the short-run 
supply and demand curves are steep. When the supply of oil shifts from S1 to S2, 
the price increase from P1 to P2 is large.
The situation is very different in the long run. Over long periods of time, pro-
ducers of oil outside OPEC respond to high prices by increasing oil exploration 
and by building new extraction capacity. Consumers respond with greater conser-
vation, such as by replacing old inefficient cars with newer efficient ones. Thus, 
as panel (b) of Figure 8 shows, the long-run supply and demand curves are more 
elastic. In the long run, the shift in the supply curve from S1 to S2 causes a much 
smaller increase in the price.
This analysis shows why OPEC succeeded in maintaining a high price of oil 
only in the short run. When OPEC countries agreed to reduce their production 
of oil, they shifted the supply curve to the left. Even though each OPEC member 
sold less oil, the price rose by so much in the short run that OPEC incomes rose. 
By contrast, in the long run, when supply and demand are more elastic, the same

reduction in supply, measured by the horizontal shift in the supply curve, caused 
a smaller increase in the price. Thus, OPEC’s coordinated reduction in supply 
proved less profitable in the long run. The cartel learned that raising prices is eas-
ier in the short run than in the long run.
5-3c Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease 
Drug-Related Crime?
A persistent problem facing our society is the use of illegal drugs, such as heroin, 
cocaine, ecstasy, and methamphetamine. Drug use has several adverse effects. 
One is that drug dependence can ruin the lives of drug users and their families. 
Another is that drug addicts often turn to robbery and other violent crimes to 
obtain the money needed to support their habit. To discourage the use of illegal 
drugs, the U.S. government devotes billions of dollars each year to reducing the 
flow of drugs into the country. Let’s use the tools of supply and demand to exam-
ine this policy of drug interdiction.
Suppose the government increases the number of federal agents devoted to 
the war on drugs. What happens in the market for illegal drugs? As is usual, we 
answer this question in three steps. First, we consider whether the supply or de-
mand curve shifts. Second, we consider the direction of the shift. Third, we see 
how the shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity.
Although the purpose of drug interdiction is to reduce drug use, its direct im-
pact is on the sellers of drugs rather than the buyers. When the government stops 
FIGURE 8
When the supply of oil falls, the response depends on the time horizon. In the short run, 
­supply and demand are relatively inelastic, as in panel (a). Thus, when the supply curve 
shifts from S1 to S2, the price rises substantially. By contrast, in the long run, supply and 
demand are relatively elastic, as in panel (b). In this case, the same size shift in the supply 
curve (S1 to S2) causes a smaller increase in the price.

How Markets Work
some drugs from entering the country and arrests more smugglers, it raises the cost 
of selling drugs and, therefore, reduces the quantity of drugs supplied at any given 
price. The demand for drugs—the amount buyers want at any given price—is not 
changed. As panel (a) of Figure 9 shows, interdiction shifts the supply curve to the 
left from S1 to S2 and leaves the demand curve the same. The equilibrium price of 
drugs rises from P1 to P2, and the equilibrium quantity falls from Q1 to Q2. The fall 
in the equilibrium quantity shows that drug interdiction does reduce drug use.
But what about the amount of drug-related crime? To answer this question, 
consider the total amount that drug users pay for the drugs they buy. Because few 
drug addicts are likely to break their destructive habits in response to a higher 
price, it is likely that the demand for drugs is inelastic, as it is drawn in the fig-
ure. If demand is inelastic, then an increase in price raises total revenue in the 
drug market. That is, because drug interdiction raises the price of drugs propor-
tionately more than it reduces drug use, it raises the total amount of money that 
drug users pay for drugs. Addicts who already had to steal to support their habits 
would have an even greater need for quick cash. Thus, drug interdiction could 
increase drug-related crime. 
Because of this adverse effect of drug interdiction, some analysts argue for al-
ternative approaches to the drug problem. Rather than trying to reduce the sup-
ply of drugs, policymakers might try to reduce the demand by pursuing a policy 
of drug education. Successful drug education has the effects shown in panel (b) of 
FIGURE 9
Drug interdiction reduces the supply of drugs from S1 to S2, as in panel (a). If the 
demand for drugs is inelastic, then the total amount paid by drug users rises, even 
as the amount of drug use falls. By contrast, drug education reduces the demand for 
drugs from D1 to D2, as in panel (b). Because both price and quantity fall, the amount 
paid by drug users falls.

Figure 9. The demand curve shifts to the left from D1 to D2. As a result, the equi-
librium quantity falls from Q1 to Q2, and the equilibrium price falls from P1 to P2. 
Total revenue, P × Q, also falls. Thus, in contrast to drug interdiction, drug educa-
tion can reduce both drug use and drug-related crime.
Advocates of drug interdiction might argue that the long-run effects of this 
policy are different from the short-run effects because the elasticity of demand 
depends on the time horizon. The demand for drugs is probably inelastic over 
short periods because higher prices do not substantially affect drug use by es-
tablished addicts. But demand may be more elastic over longer periods because 
higher prices would discourage experimentation with drugs among the young 
and, over time, lead to fewer drug addicts. In this case, drug interdiction would 
increase drug-related crime in the short run while decreasing it in the long run.

5-4 Conclusion
According to an old quip, even a parrot can become an economist simply by learn-
ing to say “supply and demand.” These last two chapters should have convinced 
you that there is much truth in this statement. The tools of supply and demand 
allow you to analyze many of the most important events and policies that shape 
the economy. You are now well on your way to becoming an economist (or at least 
a well-educated parrot).
•	
The price elasticity of demand measures how much 
the quantity demanded responds to changes in the 
price. Demand tends to be more elastic if close substi-
tutes are available, if the good is a luxury rather than a 
necessity, if the market is narrowly defined, or if buy-
ers have substantial time to react to a price change.
•	
The price elasticity of demand is calculated as the 
percentage change in quantity demanded divided by 
the percentage change in price. If quantity demanded 
moves proportionately less than the price, then the 
elasticity is less than 1 and demand is said to be in-
elastic. If quantity demanded moves proportionately 
more than the price, then the elasticity is greater than 
1 and demand is said to be elastic.
•	
Total revenue, the total amount paid for a good, equals 
the price of the good times the quantity sold. For in-
elastic demand curves, total revenue moves in the same 
direction as the price. For elastic demand curves, total 
revenue moves in the opposite direction as the price.
•	
The income elasticity of demand measures how 
much the quantity demanded responds to changes in 
consumers’ income. The cross-price elasticity of de-
mand measures how much the quantity demanded of 
one good responds to changes in the price of another 
good. 
•	
The price elasticity of supply measures how much the 
quantity supplied responds to changes in the price. 
This elasticity often depends on the time horizon un-
der consideration. In most markets, supply is more 
elastic in the long run than in the short run.
•	
The price elasticity of supply is calculated as the 
percentage change in quantity supplied divided by 
the percentage change in price. If quantity supplied 
moves proportionately less than the price, then the 
elasticity is less than 1 and supply is said to be inelas-
tic. If quantity supplied moves proportionately more 
than the price, then the elasticity is greater than 1 and 
supply is said to be elastic.
•	
The tools of supply and demand can be applied in 
many different kinds of markets. This chapter uses 
them to analyze the market for wheat, the market for 
oil, and the market for illegal drugs.

Supply, Demand, 
and Government 
Policies
E
conomists have two roles. As scientists, they develop and test theories to 
­explain the world around them. As policy advisers, they use their theories to 
help change the world for the better. The focus of the preceding two chapters 
has been scientific. We have seen how supply and demand determine the price of 
a good and the quantity of the good sold. We have also seen how various events 
shift supply and demand and thereby change the equilibrium price and quantity. 
And we have developed the concept of elasticity to gauge the size of these changes.
This chapter offers our first look at policy. Here we analyze various types of 
government policy using only the tools of supply and demand. As you will 
see, the analysis yields some surprising insights. Policies often have effects 
that their architects did not intend or anticipate.
We begin by considering policies that directly control prices. For ex-
ample, rent-control laws dictate a maximum rent that landlords may charge 
tenants. Minimum-wage laws dictate the lowest wage that firms may pay

How Markets Work
workers. Price controls are usually enacted when policymakers believe that the 
market price of a good or service is unfair to buyers or sellers. Yet, as we will see, 
these policies can generate inequities of their own. 
After discussing price controls, we consider the impact of taxes. Policymakers 
use taxes to raise revenue for public purposes and to influence market outcomes. 
Although the prevalence of taxes in our economy is obvious, their effects are not. 
For example, when the government levies a tax on the amount that firms pay their 
workers, do the firms or the workers bear the burden of the tax? The answer is not 
at all clear—until we apply the powerful tools of supply and demand.
6-1 Controls on Prices
To see how price controls affect market outcomes, let’s look once again at the mar-
ket for ice cream. As we saw in Chapter 4, if ice cream is sold in a competitive 
market free of government regulation, the price of ice cream adjusts to balance 
supply and demand: At the equilibrium price, the quantity of ice cream that buy-
ers want to buy exactly equals the quantity that sellers want to sell. To be concrete, 
let’s suppose that the equilibrium price is $3 per cone. 
Some people may not be happy with the outcome of this free-market process. 
The American Association of Ice-Cream Eaters complains that the $3 price is too 
high for everyone to enjoy a cone a day (their recommended daily allowance). 
Meanwhile, the National Organization of Ice-Cream Makers complains that the  
$3 price—the result of “cutthroat competition”—is too low and is depressing the 
incomes of its members. Each of these groups lobbies the government to pass 
laws that alter the market outcome by directly controlling the price of an ice-
cream cone.
Because buyers of any good always want a lower price while sellers want a 
higher price, the interests of the two groups conflict. If the Ice-Cream Eaters are 
successful in their lobbying, the government imposes a legal maximum on the 
price at which ice-cream cones can be sold. Because the price is not allowed to rise 
above this level, the legislated maximum is called a price ceiling. By contrast, if 
the Ice-Cream Makers are successful, the government imposes a legal minimum 
on the price. Because the price cannot fall below this level, the legislated mini-
mum is called a price floor. Let us consider the effects of these policies in turn.
6-1a How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes
When the government, moved by the complaints and campaign contributions of 
the Ice-Cream Eaters, imposes a price ceiling on the market for ice cream, two 
outcomes are possible. In panel (a) of Figure 1, the government imposes a price 
ceiling of $4 per cone. In this case, because the price that balances supply and 
demand ($3) is below the ceiling, the price ceiling is not binding. Market forces 
naturally move the economy to the equilibrium, and the price ceiling has no effect 
on the price or the quantity sold.
Panel (b) of Figure 1 shows the other, more interesting, possibility. In this case, 
the government imposes a price ceiling of $2 per cone. Because the equilibrium 
price of $3 is above the price ceiling, the ceiling is a binding constraint on the mar-
ket. The forces of supply and demand tend to move the price toward the equilib-
rium price, but when the market price hits the ceiling, it cannot, by law, rise any 
further. Thus, the market price equals the price ceiling. At this price, the quantity

of ice cream demanded (125 cones in Figure 1) exceeds the quantity supplied (75 
cones). There is a shortage: 50 people who want to buy ice cream at the going 
price are unable to do so. 
In response to this shortage, some mechanism for rationing ice cream will 
naturally develop. The mechanism could be long lines: Buyers who are willing 
to arrive early and wait in line get a cone, but those unwilling to wait do not. 
­Alternatively, sellers could ration ice-cream cones according to their own personal 
biases, selling them only to friends, relatives, or members of their own racial or 
ethnic group. Notice that even though the price ceiling was motivated by a desire 
to help buyers of ice cream, not all buyers benefit from the policy. Some buyers do 
get to pay a lower price, although they may have to wait in line to do so, but other 
buyers cannot get any ice cream at all.
This example in the market for ice cream shows a general result: When the 
­government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage of the good 
arises, and sellers must ration the scarce goods among the large number of potential buyers. 
The rationing mechanisms that develop under price ceilings are rarely ­desirable. 
Long lines are inefficient because they waste buyers’ time. ­Discrimination accord-
ing to seller bias is both inefficient (because the good does not necessarily go to the 
buyer who values it most highly) and potentially unfair. By contrast, the ­rationing 
mechanism in a free, competitive market is both efficient and impersonal. When 
the market for ice cream reaches its equilibrium, anyone who wants to pay the 
market price can get a cone. Free markets ration goods with prices. 
FIGURE 1
In panel (a), the government imposes a price ceiling of $4. Because the price ceiling is 
above the equilibrium price of $3, the price ceiling has no effect, and the market can reach 
the equilibrium of supply and demand. In this equilibrium, quantity supplied and quantity 
­demanded both equal 100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes a price ceiling of $2. 
Because the price ceiling is below the equilibrium price of $3, the market price equals $2. 
At this price, 125 cones are demanded and only 75 are supplied, so there is a shortage of  
50 cones.

How Markets Work
Lines at the Gas Pump
As we discussed in Chapter 5, in 1973 the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised the price of crude oil in world oil 
markets. Because crude oil is the major input used to make gasoline, the 
higher oil prices reduced the supply of gasoline. Long lines at gas stations 
­became commonplace, and motorists often had to wait for hours to buy only a 
few gallons of gas.
What was responsible for the long gas lines? Most people blame OPEC. Surely, 
if OPEC had not raised the price of crude oil, the shortage of gasoline would not 
have occurred. Yet economists blame U.S. government regulations that limited 
the price oil companies could charge for gasoline.
Figure 2 shows what happened. As shown in panel (a), before OPEC raised the 
price of crude oil, the equilibrium price of gasoline, P1, was below the price ceil-
ing. The price regulation, therefore, had no effect. When the price of crude oil rose, 
however, the situation changed. The increase in the price of crude oil raised the 
cost of producing gasoline, and this reduced the supply of gasoline. As panel (b) 
shows, the supply curve shifted to the left from S1 to S2. In an unregulated market, 
this shift in supply would have raised the equilibrium price of gasoline from P1 
to P2, and no shortage would have resulted. Instead, the price ceiling prevented 
the price from rising to the equilibrium level. At the price ceiling, ­producers were

FIGURE 2
Panel (a) shows the gasoline market when the price ceiling is not binding because the 
equilibrium price, P1, is below the ceiling. Panel (b) shows the gasoline market after 
an increase in the price of crude oil (an input into making gasoline) shifts the supply 
curve to the left from S1 to S2. In an unregulated market, the price would have risen 
from P1 to P2. The price ceiling, however, prevents this from happening. At the binding 
price ceiling, consumers are willing to buy QD, but producers of gasoline are willing to 
sell only QS. The difference between quantity demanded and quantity supplied, QD−QS, 
measures the gasoline shortage.

willing to sell QS, and consumers were willing to buy QD. Thus, the shift in supply 
caused a severe shortage at the regulated price.
Eventually, the laws regulating the price of gasoline were repealed. Lawmakers 
came to understand that they were partly responsible for the many hours ­Americans 
lost waiting in line to buy gasoline. Today, when the price of crude oil changes, 
the price of gasoline can adjust to bring supply and demand into equilibrium. 
Rent Control in the Short Run and the Long Run
One common example of a price ceiling is rent control. In many cities, 
the local government places a ceiling on rents that landlords may charge 
their tenants. The goal of this policy is to help the poor by making hous-
ing more affordable. Economists often criticize rent control, arguing that it is a 
highly inefficient way to help the poor raise their standard of living. One econo-
mist called rent control “the best way to destroy a city, other than bombing.”
The adverse effects of rent control are less apparent to the general population 
because these effects occur over many years. In the short run, landlords have a 
fixed number of apartments to rent, and they cannot adjust this number quickly 
as market conditions change. Moreover, the number of people searching for hous-
ing in a city may not be highly responsive to rents in the short run because people 
take time to adjust their housing arrangements. Therefore, the short-run supply 
and demand for housing are relatively inelastic. 
Panel (a) of Figure 3 shows the short-run effects of rent control on the hous-
ing market. As with any binding price ceiling, rent control causes a shortage.

­Because the supply and demand curves for apartments are more elastic, rent control causes a 
large shortage.

How Markets Work
6-1b How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes
To examine the effects of another kind of government price control, let’s return to 
the market for ice cream. Imagine now that the government is persuaded by the 
pleas of the National Organization of Ice-Cream Makers whose members feel the 
$3 equilibrium price is too low. In this case, the government might institute a price 
floor. Price floors, like price ceilings, are an attempt by the government to main-
tain prices at other than equilibrium levels. Whereas a price ceiling places a legal 
maximum on prices, a price floor places a legal minimum.
When the government imposes a price floor on the ice-cream market, two out-
comes are possible. If the government imposes a price floor of $2 per cone when 
the equilibrium price is $3, we obtain the outcome in panel (a) of Figure 4. In this 
case, because the equilibrium price is above the floor, the price floor is not bind-
ing. Market forces naturally move the economy to the equilibrium, and the price 
floor has no effect.
Panel (b) of Figure 4 shows what happens when the government imposes a 
price floor of $4 per cone. In this case, because the equilibrium price of $3 is below 
Yet because supply and demand are inelastic in the short run, the initial shortage 
caused by rent control is small. The primary effect in the short run is to reduce rents.
The long-run story is very different because the buyers and sellers of rental 
housing respond more to market conditions as time passes. On the supply side, 
landlords respond to low rents by not building new apartments and by failing 
to maintain existing ones. On the demand side, low rents encourage people to 
find their own apartments (rather than living with their parents or sharing apart-
ments with roommates) and induce more people to move into a city. Therefore, 
both supply and demand are more elastic in the long run. 
Panel (b) of Figure 3 illustrates the housing market in the long run. When rent 
control depresses rents below the equilibrium level, the quantity of apartments 
supplied falls substantially, and the quantity of apartments demanded rises sub-
stantially. The result is a large shortage of housing.
In cities with rent control, landlords use various mechanisms to ration housing. 
Some landlords keep long waiting lists. Others give a preference to tenants with-
out children. Still others discriminate on the basis of race. Sometimes apartments 
are allocated to those willing to offer under-the-table payments to building super-
intendents. In essence, these bribes bring the total price of an apartment closer to 
the equilibrium price.
To understand fully the effects of rent control, we have to remember one of 
the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. In 
free markets, landlords try to keep their buildings clean and safe because desir-
able apartments command higher prices. By contrast, when rent control creates 
shortages and waiting lists, landlords lose their incentive to respond to tenants’ 
concerns. Why should a landlord spend money to maintain and improve the 
property when people are waiting to get in as it is? In the end, tenants get lower 
rents, but they also get lower-quality housing.
Policymakers often react to the effects of rent control by imposing additional 
regulations. For example, various laws make racial discrimination in housing ille-
gal and require landlords to provide minimally adequate living conditions. These 
laws, however, are difficult and costly to enforce. By contrast, when rent control 
is eliminated and a market for housing is regulated by the forces of competition, 
such laws are less necessary. In a free market, the price of housing adjusts to elimi-
nate the shortages that give rise to undesirable landlord behavior.

the floor, the price floor is a binding constraint on the market. The forces of sup-
ply and demand tend to move the price toward the equilibrium price, but when 
the market price hits the floor, it can fall no further. The market price equals the 
price floor. At this floor, the quantity of ice cream supplied (120 cones) exceeds the 
quantity demanded (80 cones). Some people who want to sell ice cream at the go-
ing price are unable to. Thus, a binding price floor causes a surplus. 
Just as the shortages resulting from price ceilings can lead to undesirable ra-
tioning mechanisms, so can the surpluses resulting from price floors. The sellers 
who appeal to the personal biases of the buyers, perhaps due to racial or familial 
ties, may be better able to sell their goods than those who do not. By contrast, in 
a free market, the price serves as the rationing mechanism, and sellers can sell all 
they want at the equilibrium price.
FIGURE 4
In panel (a), the government imposes a price floor of $2. Because this is below the 
­equilibrium price of $3, the price floor has no effect. The market price adjusts to balance 
supply and demand. At the equilibrium, quantity supplied and quantity demanded both 
equal 100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes a price floor of $4, which is above 
the equilibrium price of $3. Therefore, the market price equals $4. Because 120 cones are 
­supplied at this price and only 80 are demanded, there is a surplus of 40 cones.

The Minimum Wage
An important example of a price floor is the minimum wage. 
­Minimum-wage laws dictate the lowest price for labor that any employer 
may pay. The U.S. Congress first instituted a minimum wage with the Fair 
Labor Standards Act of 1938 to ensure workers a minimally adequate standard 
of living. In 2012, the minimum wage according to federal law was $7.25 per hour. 
(Some states mandate minimum wages above the federal level.) Most European 
nations have minimum-wage laws as well, sometimes significantly higher than in 
the United States. For example, average income in France is 27 percent lower than

How Markets Work
it is in the United States, but the French minimum wage is 9.40 euros per hour, 
which is about $12 per hour.
To examine the effects of a minimum wage, we must consider the market for 
labor. Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows the labor market, which, like all markets, is sub-
ject to the forces of supply and demand. Workers determine the supply of labor, 
and firms determine the demand. If the government doesn’t intervene, the wage 
normally adjusts to balance labor supply and labor demand.
Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows the labor market with a minimum wage. If the 
minimum wage is above the equilibrium level, as it is here, the quantity of labor 
supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. The result is unemployment. Thus, the 
minimum wage raises the incomes of those workers who have jobs, but it lowers 
the incomes of workers who cannot find jobs. 
To fully understand the minimum wage, keep in mind that the economy con-
tains not a single labor market but many labor markets for different types of 
workers. The impact of the minimum wage depends on the skill and experience 
of the worker. Highly skilled and experienced workers are not affected because 
their equilibrium wages are well above the minimum. For these workers, the min-
imum wage is not binding.
The minimum wage has its greatest impact on the market for teenage labor. 
The equilibrium wages of teenagers are low because teenagers are among the 
least skilled and least experienced members of the labor force. In addition, teenag-
ers are often willing to accept a lower wage in exchange for on-the-job training. 
(Some teenagers are willing to work as “interns” for no pay at all. Because intern-
ships pay nothing, however, the minimum wage does not apply to them. If it did, 
these jobs might not exist.) As a result, the minimum wage is binding more often 
for teenagers than for other members of the labor force.
FIGURE 5
Panel (a) shows a labor market in which the wage adjusts to balance labor supply and 
­labor demand. Panel (b) shows the impact of a binding minimum wage. Because the 
minimum wage is a price floor, it causes a surplus: The quantity of labor supplied 
­exceeds the quantity demanded. The result is unemployment.

CHAPTER 6  SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
119
Many economists have studied how minimum-wage laws affect the teenage 
labor market. These researchers compare the changes in the minimum wage 
over time with the changes in teenage employment. Although there is some de-
bate about how much the minimum wage affects employment, the typical study 
finds that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage depresses teenage employ-
ment between 1 and 3 percent. In interpreting this estimate, note that a 10 per-
cent increase in the minimum wage does not raise the average wage of teenagers 
by 10 percent. A change in the law does not directly affect those teenagers who 
are already paid well above the minimum, and enforcement of minimum-wage 
laws is not perfect. Thus, the estimated drop in employment of 1 to 3 percent is 
significant. 
In addition to altering the quantity of labor demanded, the minimum wage al-
ters the quantity supplied. Because the minimum wage raises the wage that teen-
agers can earn, it increases the number of teenagers who choose to look for jobs. 
Studies have found that a higher minimum wage influences which teenagers are 
employed. When the minimum wage rises, some teenagers who are still attend-
ing high school choose to drop out and take jobs. These new dropouts displace 
other teenagers who had already dropped out of school and who now become 
unemployed. 
The minimum wage is a frequent topic of debate. Economists are about evenly 
divided on the issue. In a 2006 survey of Ph.D. economists, 47 percent favored 
eliminating the minimum wage, while 14 percent would maintain it at its current 
level and 38 percent would increase it. 
 Advocates of the minimum wage view the policy as one way to raise the in-
come of the working poor. They correctly point out that workers who earn the 
minimum wage can afford only a meager standard of living. In 2012, for instance, 
when the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, two adults working 40 hours a week 
for every week of the year at minimum-wage jobs had a total annual income of 
only $30,160, which was less than two-thirds of the median family income in the 
United States. Many advocates of the minimum wage admit that it has some ad-
verse effects, including unemployment, but they believe that these effects are small 
and that, all things considered, a higher minimum wage makes the poor better off.
Opponents of the minimum wage contend that it is not the best way to combat 
poverty. They note that a high minimum wage causes unemployment, encour-
ages teenagers to drop out of school, and prevents some unskilled workers from 
getting the on-the-job training they need. Moreover, opponents of the minimum 
wage point out that it is a poorly targeted policy. Not all minimum-wage workers 
are heads of households trying to help their families escape poverty. In fact, fewer 
than a third of minimum-wage earners are in families with incomes below the 
poverty line. Many are teenagers from middle-class homes working at part-time 
jobs for extra spending money. 
6-1c Evaluating Price Controls
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that markets are 
usually a good way to organize economic activity. This principle explains why 
economists usually oppose price ceilings and price floors. To economists, prices 
are not the outcome of some haphazard process. Prices, they contend, are the re-
sult of the millions of business and consumer decisions that lie behind the supply 
and demand curves. Prices have the crucial job of balancing supply and demand 
and, thereby, coordinating economic activity. When policymakers set prices

How Markets Work
With Venezuelan Food 
Shortages, Some Blame 
Price Controls
By William Neuman
C
ARACAS, Venezuela — By 6:30 a.m., a 
full hour and a half before the store would 
open, about two dozen people were already in 
line. They waited patiently, not for the latest 
iPhone, but for something far more basic: 
groceries. 
“Whatever I can get,” said Katherine 
Huga, 23, a mother of two, describing her 
shopping list. She gave a shrug of resigna-
tion. “You buy what they have.” 
Venezuela is one of the world’s top oil pro-
ducers at a time of soaring energy prices, yet 
shortages of staples like milk, meat and toi-
let paper are a chronic part of life here, often 
turning grocery shopping into a hit or miss 
proposition. 
Some residents arrange their calendars 
around the once-a-week deliveries made to 
government-subsidized stores like this one, 
lining up before dawn to buy a single frozen 
chicken before the stock runs out. Or a couple 
of bags of flour. Or a bottle of cooking oil. 
The shortages affect both the poor and 
the well-off, in surprising ways. A super-
market in the upscale La Castellana neigh-
borhood recently had plenty of chicken and 
cheese—even quail eggs—but not a single 
roll of toilet paper. Only a few bags of coffee 
remained on a bottom shelf. 
Asked where a shopper could get milk on 
a day when that, too, was out of stock, a man-
ager said with sarcasm, “At Chávez’s house.” 
At the heart of the debate is President 
Hugo Chávez’s socialist-inspired government, 
which imposes strict price controls that are 
intended to make a range of foods and other 
goods more affordable for the poor. They are 
often the very products that are the hardest 
to find. 
“Venezuela is too rich a country to have 
this,” Nery Reyes, 55, a restaurant worker, 
said outside a government-subsidized store 
in the working-class Santa Rosalía neighbor-
hood. “I’m wasting my day here standing in 
line to buy one chicken and some rice.” 
Venezuela was long one of the most pros-
perous countries in the region, with sophisti-
cated manufacturing, vibrant agriculture and 
strong businesses, making it hard for many 
residents to accept such widespread scarci-
ties. But amid the prosperity, the gap between 
rich and poor was extreme, a problem that  
Mr. Chávez and his ministers say they are try-
ing to eliminate. 
They blame unfettered capitalism for the 
country’s economic ills and argue that con-
trols are needed to keep prices in check in a 
country where inflation rose to 27.6 ­percent 
last year, one of the highest rates in the world. 
They say companies cause shortages on 
purpose, holding products off the market to 
push up prices. This month, the government 
required price cuts on fruit juice, toothpaste,

the Market

by legal decree, they obscure the signals that normally guide the allocation of 
­society’s resources.
Another one of the Ten Principles of Economics is that governments can some-
times improve market outcomes. Indeed, policymakers are led to control prices 
because they view the market’s outcome as unfair. Price controls are often aimed 
at helping the poor. For instance, rent-control laws try to make housing affordable 
for everyone, and minimum-wage laws try to help people escape poverty.
Yet price controls often hurt those they are trying to help. Rent control may 
keep rents low, but it also discourages landlords from maintaining their buildings 
and makes housing hard to find. Minimum-wage laws may raise the incomes of 
some workers, but they also cause other workers to be unemployed. 
Helping those in need can be accomplished in ways other than controlling 
prices. For instance, the government can make housing more affordable by paying 
a fraction of the rent for poor families. Unlike rent control, such rent subsidies do 
not reduce the quantity of housing supplied and, therefore, do not lead to hous-
ing shortages. Similarly, wage subsidies raise the living standards of the work-
ing poor without discouraging firms from hiring them. An example of a wage

disposable diapers and more than a dozen 
other products. 
“We are not asking them to lose money, 
just that they make money in a rational way, 
that they don’t rob the people,” Mr. Chávez 
said recently. 
But many economists call it a classic 
case of a government causing a problem 
rather than solving it. Prices are set so low, 
they say, that companies and producers 
cannot make a profit. So farmers grow less 
food, manufacturers cut back production 
and retailers stock less inventory. Moreover, 
some of the shortages are in industries, 
like dairy and coffee, where the government 
has seized private companies and is now 
running them, saying it is in the national 
interest. 
In January, according to a scarcity index 
compiled by the Central Bank of Venezuela, 
the difficulty of finding basic goods on store 
shelves was at its worst level since 2008. 
While that measure has eased consider-
ably, many products can still be hard to  
come by. 
Datanálisis, a polling firm that regularly 
tracks scarcities, said that powdered milk, a 
staple here, could not be found in 42 percent 
of the stores its researchers visited in early 
March. Liquid milk can be even harder to find. 
Other products in short supply last month, 
according to Datanálisis, included beef, 
chicken, vegetable oil and sugar. The poll-
ing firm also says that the problem is most 
extreme in the government-subsidized stores 
that were created to provide affordable food 
to the poor…. 
Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch who studies 
the Venezuelan economy, said the govern-
ment might score some political points with 
the new round of price controls. But over 
time, he argued, they will spell trouble for the 
economy. 
“In the medium to long term, this is going 
to be a disaster,” Mr. Rodriguez said. 
The price controls also mean that prod-
ucts missing from store shelves usually show 
up on the black market at much higher prices, 
a source of outrage for many. For government 
supporters, that is proof of speculation. Oth-
ers say it is the consequence of a misguided 
policy…. 
If there is one product that Venezuela 
should be able to produce in abundance it 
is coffee, a major crop here for centuries. 
Until 2009, Venezuela was a coffee exporter, 
but it began importing large amounts of it 
three years ago to make up for a decline in 
production. 
Farmers and coffee roasters say the 
problem is simple: retail price controls keep 
prices close to or below what it costs farmers 
to grow and harvest the coffee. As a result, 
many do not invest in new plantings or fertil-
izer, or they cut back on the amount of land 
used to grow coffee. Making matters worse, 
the recent harvest was poor in many areas. 
A group representing small- to medium-
size roasters said last month that there was 
no domestic coffee left on the wholesale 
­market—the earliest time of year that in-
dustry leaders could remember such supplies 
running out. The group announced a deal with 
the government to buy imported beans to 
keep coffee on store shelves. 
Similar problems have played out with 
other agricultural products under price con-
trols, like lags in production and rising im-
ports for beef, milk and corn. 
Waiting in line to buy chicken and other 
staples, Jenny Montero, 30, recalled how she 
could not find cooking oil last fall and had 
to switch from the fried food she prefers to 
soups and stews. 
“It was good for me,” she said drily, push-
ing her 14-month-old daughter in a stroller.  
“I lost several pounds.”

subsidy is the earned income tax credit, a government program that supplements 
the incomes of low-wage workers.
Although these alternative policies are often better than price controls, they are 
not perfect. Rent and wage subsidies cost the government money and, therefore, 
require higher taxes. As we see in the next section, taxation has costs of its own.

6-2 Taxes
All governments—from the federal government in Washington, D.C., to the ­local 
governments in small towns—use taxes to raise revenue for public projects, such 
as roads, schools, and national defense. Because taxes are such an important pol-
icy instrument, and because they affect our lives in many ways, we return to the

How Markets Work
study of taxes several times throughout this book. In this section, we begin our 
study of how taxes affect the economy.
To set the stage for our analysis, imagine that a local government decides to 
hold an annual ice-cream celebration—with a parade, fireworks, and speeches by 
town officials. To raise revenue to pay for the event, the town decides to place a 
$0.50 tax on the sale of ice-cream cones. When the plan is announced, our two lob-
bying groups swing into action. The American Association of Ice-Cream Eaters 
claims that consumers of ice cream are having trouble making ends meet, and it 
argues that sellers of ice cream should pay the tax. The National Organization of 
Ice-Cream Makers claims that its members are struggling to survive in a competi-
tive market, and it argues that buyers of ice cream should pay the tax. The town 
mayor, hoping to reach a compromise, suggests that half the tax be paid by the 
buyers and half be paid by the sellers.
To analyze these proposals, we need to address a simple but subtle question: 
When the government levies a tax on a good, who actually bears the burden of the 
tax? The people buying the good? The people selling the good? Or if buyers and 
sellers share the tax burden, what determines how the burden is divided? Can the 
government simply legislate the division of the burden, as the mayor is suggest-
ing, or is the division determined by more fundamental market forces? The term 
tax incidence refers to how the burden of a tax is distributed among the various 
people who make up the economy. As we will see, some surprising lessons about 
tax incidence can be learned by applying the tools of supply and demand. 
6-2a How Taxes on Sellers Affect Market Outcomes
We begin by considering a tax levied on sellers of a good. Suppose the lo-
cal government passes a law requiring sellers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 
to the ­government for each cone they sell. How does this law affect the buyers 
and sellers of ice cream? To answer this question, we can follow the three steps 
in ­Chapter 4 for analyzing supply and demand: (1) We decide whether the law 
­affects the supply curve or demand curve. (2) We decide which way the curve 
shifts. (3) We examine how the shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity.
Step One  The immediate impact of the tax is on the sellers of ice cream. Because 
the tax is not levied on buyers, the quantity of ice cream demanded at any given 
price is the same; thus, the demand curve does not change. By contrast, the tax on 
sellers makes the ice-cream business less profitable at any given price, so it shifts 
the supply curve.
Step Two  Because the tax on sellers raises the cost of producing and selling ice 
cream, it reduces the quantity supplied at every price. The supply curve shifts to 
the left (or, equivalently, upward).
In addition to determining the direction in which the supply curve moves, we 
can also be precise about the size of the shift. For any market price of ice cream, 
the effective price to sellers—the amount they get to keep after paying the tax—is 
$0.50 lower. For example, if the market price of a cone happened to be $2.00, the 
effective price received by sellers would be $1.50. Whatever the market price, sell-
ers will supply a quantity of ice cream as if the price were $0.50 lower than it is. 
Put differently, to induce sellers to supply any given quantity, the market price 
must now be $0.50 higher to compensate for the effect of the tax. Thus, as shown 
in Figure 6, the supply curve shifts upward from S1 to S2 by the exact size of the 
tax ($0.50).

CHAPTER 6  SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
123
Step Three  Having determined how the supply curve shifts, we can now com-
pare the initial and the new equilibriums. Figure 6 shows that the equilibrium price 
of ice cream rises from $3.00 to $3.30, and the equilibrium quantity falls from 100 
to 90 cones. Because sellers sell less and buyers buy less in the new equilibrium, the 
tax reduces the size of the ice-cream market. 
Implications  We can now return to the question of tax incidence: Who pays 
the tax? Although sellers send the entire tax to the government, buyers and sellers 
share the burden. Because the market price rises from $3.00 to $3.30 when the tax 
is introduced, buyers pay $0.30 more for each ice-cream cone than they did with-
out the tax. Thus, the tax makes buyers worse off. Sellers get a higher price ($3.30) 
from buyers than they did previously, but what they get to keep after paying the 
tax is only $2.80 ($3.30 − $0.50 = $2.80), compared with $3.00 before the tax was 
implemented. Thus, the tax also makes sellers worse off.
To sum up, this analysis yields two lessons:
•	 Taxes discourage market activity. When a good is taxed, the quantity of the 
good sold is smaller in the new equilibrium.
•	 Buyers and sellers share the burden of taxes. In the new equilibrium, buyers 
pay more for the good, and sellers receive less.
6-2b How Taxes on Buyers Affect Market Outcomes
Now consider a tax levied on buyers of a good. Suppose that our local gov-
ernment passes a law requiring buyers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 to the 
­government for each ice-cream cone they buy. What are the effects of this law? 
Again, we ­apply our three steps.
Step One   The initial impact of the tax is on the demand for ice cream. The sup-
ply curve is not affected because, for any given price of ice cream, sellers have the 
FIGURE 6

When a tax of $0.50 is levied 
on sellers, the supply curve 
shifts up by $0.50 from S1 to 
S2. The equilibrium quantity 
falls from 100 to 90 cones. The 
price that buyers pay rises from 
$3.00 to $3.30. The price that 
sellers receive (after paying the 
tax) falls from $3.00 to $2.80. 
Even though the tax is levied on 
sellers, buyers and sellers share

How Markets Work
same incentive to provide ice cream to the market. By contrast, buyers now have 
to pay a tax to the government (as well as the price to the sellers) whenever they 
buy ice cream. Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve for ice cream. 
Step Two  We next determine the direction of the shift. Because the tax on buyers 
makes buying ice cream less attractive, buyers demand a smaller quantity of ice 
cream at every price. As a result, the demand curve shifts to the left (or, equiva-
lently, downward), as shown in Figure 7.
Once again, we can be precise about the size of the shift. Because of the $0.50 
tax levied on buyers, the effective price to buyers is now $0.50 higher than 
the market price (whatever the market price happens to be). For example, if 
the market price of a cone happened to be $2.00, the effective price to buyers 
would be $2.50. Because buyers look at their total cost including the tax, they 
demand a quantity of ice cream as if the market price were $0.50 higher than it 
actually is. In other words, to induce buyers to demand any given quantity, the 
market price must now be $0.50 lower to make up for the effect of the tax. Thus, 
the tax shifts the demand curve downward from D1 to D2 by the exact size of the 
tax ($0.50). 
Step Three  Having determined how the demand curve shifts, we can now see 
the effect of the tax by comparing the initial equilibrium and the new equilib-
rium. You can see in Figure 7 that the equilibrium price of ice cream falls from 
$3.00 to $2.80, and the equilibrium quantity falls from 100 to 90 cones. Once 
again, the tax on ice cream reduces the size of the ice-cream market. And once 
again, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax. Sellers get a lower price for 
their product; buyers pay a lower market price to sellers than they did previ-
ously, but the effective price (including the tax buyers have to pay) rises from 
$3.00 to $3.30.

CHAPTER 6  SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
125
Implications   If you compare Figures 6 and 7, you will notice a surprising 
conclusion: Taxes levied on sellers and taxes levied on buyers are equivalent. In both 
cases, the tax places a wedge between the price that buyers pay and the price that 
sellers receive. The wedge between the buyers’ price and the sellers’ price is the 
same, ­regardless of whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers. In either case, 
the wedge shifts the relative position of the supply and demand curves. In the new 
equilibrium, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax. The only difference 
between a tax levied on sellers and a tax levied on buyers is who sends the money 
to the government.
The equivalence of these two taxes is easy to understand if we imagine that the 
government collects the $0.50 ice-cream tax in a bowl on the counter of each ice-
cream store. When the government levies the tax on sellers, the seller is required 
to place $0.50 in the bowl after the sale of each cone. When the government levies 
the tax on buyers, the buyer is required to place $0.50 in the bowl every time a 
cone is bought. Whether the $0.50 goes directly from the buyer’s pocket into the 
bowl, or indirectly from the buyer’s pocket into the seller’s hand and then into the 
bowl, does not matter. Once the market reaches its new equilibrium, buyers and 
sellers share the burden, regardless of how the tax is levied.
Can Congress Distribute the Burden of a Payroll Tax?
If you have ever received a paycheck, you probably noticed that taxes 
were deducted from the amount you earned. One of these taxes is called 
FICA, an acronym for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. The federal 
government uses the revenue from the FICA tax to pay for Social Security 
and Medicare, the income support and healthcare programs for the elderly. FICA 
is an example of a payroll tax, which is a tax on the wages that firms pay their 
workers. In 2013, the total FICA tax for the typical worker was 15.3 percent of 
earnings. 
Who do you think bears the burden of this payroll tax—firms or workers? 
When Congress passed this legislation, it tried to mandate a division of the tax 
burden. According to the law, half of the tax is paid by firms, and half is paid by 
workers. That is, half of the tax is paid out of firms’ revenues, and half is deducted 
from workers’ paychecks. The amount that shows up as a deduction on your pay 
stub is the worker contribution.
Our analysis of tax incidence, however, shows that lawmakers cannot so eas-
ily dictate the distribution of a tax burden. To illustrate, we can analyze a pay-
roll tax as merely a tax on a good, where the good is labor and the price is the 
wage. The key feature of the payroll tax is that it places a wedge between the 
wage that firms pay and the wage that workers receive. Figure 8 shows the out-
come. When a payroll tax is enacted, the wage received by workers falls, and the 
wage paid by firms rises. In the end, workers and firms share the burden of the 
tax, much as the legislation requires. Yet this division of the tax burden between 
workers and firms has nothing to do with the legislated division: The division 
of the burden in Figure 8 is not necessarily 50-50, and the same outcome would 
prevail if the law levied the entire tax on workers or if it levied the entire tax 
on firms.
This example shows that the most basic lesson of tax incidence is often over-
looked in public debate. Lawmakers can decide whether a tax comes from the 
case

A Payroll Tax
A payroll tax places a wedge 
between the wage that workers 
receive and the wage that firms 
pay. Comparing wages with and 
without the tax, you can see 
that workers and firms share 
the tax burden. This division of 
the tax burden between workers 
and firms does not depend on 
whether the government levies 
the tax on workers, levies the 
tax on firms, or divides the tax 
equally between the two groups.

buyer’s pocket or from the seller’s, but they cannot legislate the true burden of a 
tax. Rather, tax incidence depends on the forces of supply and demand. 
6-2c Elasticity and Tax Incidence
When a good is taxed, buyers and sellers of the good share the burden of the tax. 
But how exactly is the tax burden divided? Only rarely will it be shared equally. To 
see how the burden is divided, consider the impact of taxation in the two markets 
in Figure 9. In both cases, the figure shows the initial demand curve, the initial 
supply curve, and a tax that drives a wedge between the amount paid by buyers 
and the amount received by sellers. (Not drawn in either panel of the figure is the 
new supply or demand curve. Which curve shifts depends on whether the tax is 
levied on buyers or sellers. As we have seen, this is irrelevant for the incidence 
of the tax.) The difference in the two panels is the relative elasticity of supply  
and demand. 
Panel (a) of Figure 9 shows a tax in a market with very elastic supply and rela-
tively inelastic demand. That is, sellers are very responsive to changes in the price 
of the good (so the supply curve is relatively flat), whereas buyers are not very 
responsive (so the demand curve is relatively steep). When a tax is imposed on a 
market with these elasticities, the price received by sellers does not fall much, so 
sellers bear only a small burden. By contrast, the price paid by buyers rises sub-
stantially, indicating that buyers bear most of the burden of the tax.
Panel (b) of Figure 9 shows a tax in a market with relatively inelastic supply 
and very elastic demand. In this case, sellers are not very responsive to changes 
in the price (so the supply curve is steeper), whereas buyers are very responsive 
(so the demand curve is flatter). The figure shows that when a tax is imposed, the 
price paid by buyers does not rise much, but the price received by sellers falls 
substantially. Thus, sellers bear most of the burden of the tax.
The two panels of Figure 9 show a general lesson about how the burden of a tax 
is divided: A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic.

CHAPTER 6  SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES

Why is this true? In essence, the elasticity measures the willingness of buyers or 
sellers to leave the market when conditions become unfavorable. A small elastic-
ity of demand means that buyers do not have good alternatives to consuming this 
particular good. A small elasticity of supply means that sellers do not have good 
alternatives to producing this particular good. When the good is taxed, the side 
of the market with fewer good alternatives is less willing to leave the market and 
must, therefore, bear more of the burden of the tax.
We can apply this logic to the payroll tax discussed in the previous case study. 
Most labor economists believe that the supply of labor is much less elastic than

Is Divided
In panel (a), the supply curve is 
elastic, and the demand curve is 
inelastic. In this case, the price 
received by sellers falls only 
slightly, while the price paid by 
buyers rises substantially. Thus, 
buyers bear most of the burden 
of the tax. In panel (b), the sup-
ply curve is inelastic, and the 
demand curve is elastic. In this 
case, the price received by sell-
ers falls substantially, while the 
price paid by buyers rises only 
slightly. Thus, sellers bear most 
of the burden of the tax.

How Markets Work
Who Pays the Luxury Tax?
In 1990, Congress adopted a new luxury tax on items such as yachts, 
private airplanes, furs, jewelry, and expensive cars. The goal of the tax 
was to raise revenue from those who could most easily afford to pay. Be-
cause only the rich could afford to buy such extravagances, taxing luxuries 
seemed a logical way of taxing the rich.
Yet, when the forces of supply and demand took over, the outcome was quite 
different from the one Congress intended. Consider, for example, the market for 
yachts. The demand for yachts is quite elastic. A millionaire can easily not buy a 
yacht; he can use the money to buy a bigger house, take a European vacation, or 
leave a larger bequest to his heirs. By contrast, the supply of yachts is relatively 
inelastic, at least in the short run. Yacht factories are not easily converted to al-
ternative uses, and workers who build yachts are not eager to change careers in 
response to changing market conditions. 
Our analysis makes a clear prediction in this case. With elastic demand and 
inelastic supply, the burden of a tax falls largely on the suppliers. That is, a tax 
on yachts places a burden largely on the firms and workers who build yachts be-
cause they end up getting a significantly lower price for their product. The work-
ers, however, are not wealthy. Thus, the burden of a luxury tax falls more on the 
middle class than on the rich.
The mistaken assumptions about the incidence of the luxury tax quickly be-
came apparent after the tax went into effect. Suppliers of luxuries made their con-
gressional representatives well aware of the economic hardship they experienced, 
and Congress repealed most of the luxury tax in 1993.

6-3 Conclusion
The economy is governed by two kinds of laws: the laws of supply and demand 
and the laws enacted by governments. In this chapter, we have begun to see how 
these laws interact. Price controls and taxes are common in various markets in the 
economy, and their effects are frequently debated in the press and among policy-
makers. Even a little bit of economic knowledge can go a long way toward under-
standing and evaluating these policies.
In subsequent chapters, we analyze many government policies in greater de-
tail. We examine the effects of taxation more fully and consider a broader range 
of policies than we considered here. Yet the basic lessons of this chapter will not 
change: When analyzing government policies, supply and demand are the first 
and most useful tools of analysis.
of the payroll tax. In other words, the distribution of the tax burden is far from the 
50-50 split that lawmakers intended.

CHAPTER 6  SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
129
•	
A price ceiling is a legal maximum on the price of 
a good or service. An example is rent control. If the 
price ceiling is below the equilibrium price, then the 
price ceiling is binding, and the quantity demanded 
exceeds the quantity supplied. Because of the result-
ing shortage, sellers must in some way ration the 
good or service among buyers.
•	
A price floor is a legal minimum on the price of a good 
or service. An example is the minimum wage. If the 
price floor is above the equilibrium price, then the 
price floor is binding, and the quantity supplied ex-
ceeds the quantity demanded. Because of the resulting 
surplus, buyers’ demands for the good or service must 
in some way be rationed among sellers.
•	
When the government levies a tax on a good, the equi-
librium quantity of the good falls. That is, a tax on a 
market shrinks the size of the market.
•	
A tax on a good places a wedge between the price 
paid by buyers and the price received by sellers. 
When the market moves to the new equilibrium, buy-
ers pay more for the good and sellers receive less for 
it. In this sense, buyers and sellers share the tax bur-
den. The incidence of a tax (that is, the division of the 
tax burden) does not depend on whether the tax is 
levied on buyers or sellers.
•	
The incidence of a tax depends on the price elasticities 
of supply and demand. Most of the burden falls on the 
side of the market that is less elastic because that side 
of the market cannot respond as easily to the tax by 
changing the quantity bought or sold.

W
hen consumers go to grocery stores to buy their turkeys for Thanksgiv-
ing dinner, they may be disappointed that the price of turkey is as high as 
it is. At the same time, when farmers bring to market the turkeys they have 
raised, they probably wish the price of turkey were even higher. These views are 
not surprising: Buyers always want to pay less, and sellers always want to be paid 
more. But is there a “right price” for turkey from the standpoint of society as a 
whole?
In previous chapters, we saw how, in market economies, the forces of supply 
and demand determine the prices of goods and services and the quantities 
sold. So far, however, we have described the way markets allocate scarce 
resources without directly addressing the question of whether these mar-
ket allocations are desirable. In other words, our analysis has been positive 
(what is) rather than normative (what should be). We know that the price of 
turkey adjusts to ensure that the quantity of turkey supplied equals the

quantity of turkey demanded. But at this equilibrium, is the quantity of turkey 
produced and consumed too small, too large, or just right?
In this chapter, we take up the topic of welfare economics, the study of how 
the allocation of resources affects economic well-being. We begin by examining 
the benefits that buyers and sellers receive from engaging in market transactions. 
We then examine how society can make these benefits as large as possible. This 
analysis leads to a profound conclusion: In any market, the equilibrium of sup-
ply and demand maximizes the total benefits received by all buyers and sellers 
combined.
As you may recall from Chapter 1, one of the Ten Principles of Economics is that 
markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. The study of wel-
fare economics explains this principle more fully. It also answers our question 
about the right price of turkey: The price that balances the supply and demand for 
turkey is, in a particular sense, the best one because it maximizes the total welfare 
of turkey consumers and turkey producers. No consumer or producer of turkeys 
aims to achieve this goal, but their joint action directed by market prices moves 
them toward a welfare-maximizing outcome, as if led by an invisible hand.

7-1a Willingness to Pay
Imagine that you own a mint-condition recording of Elvis Presley’s first album. 
Because you are not an Elvis Presley fan, you decide to sell it. One way to do so is 
to hold an auction.
Four Elvis fans show up for your auction: John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Each 
of them would like to own the album, but there is a limit to the amount that each 
is willing to pay for it. Table 1 shows the maximum price that each of the four 
possible buyers would pay. Each buyer’s maximum is called his willingness to 
pay, and it measures how much that buyer values the good. Each buyer would be 
eager to buy the album at a price less than his willingness to pay, and he would 
refuse to buy the album at a price greater than his willingness to pay. At a price 
equal to his willingness to pay, the buyer would be indifferent about buying the 
good: If the price is exactly the same as the value he places on the album, he 
would be equally happy buying it or keeping his money.

CHAPTER 7  CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
137
To sell your album, you begin the bidding at a low price, say, $10. Because 
all four buyers are willing to pay much more, the price rises quickly. The bid-
ding stops when John bids $80 (or slightly more). At this point, Paul, George, and 
Ringo have dropped out of the bidding because they are unwilling to bid any 
more than $80. John pays you $80 and gets the album. Note that the album has 
gone to the buyer who values it most highly.
What benefit does John receive from buying the Elvis Presley album? In a 
sense, John has found a real bargain: He is willing to pay $100 for the album but 
pays only $80 for it. We say that John receives consumer surplus of $20. Consumer 
surplus is the amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the amount the 
buyer actually pays for it.
Consumer surplus measures the benefit buyers receive from participating in 
a market. In this example, John receives a $20 benefit from participating in the 
auction because he pays only $80 for a good he values at $100. Paul, George, and 
Ringo get no consumer surplus from participating in the auction because they left 
without the album and without paying anything.
Now consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you had two iden-
tical Elvis Presley albums to sell. Again, you auction them off to the four possible 
buyers. To keep things simple, we assume that both albums are to be sold for the 
same price and that no buyer is interested in buying more than one album. There-
fore, the price rises until two buyers are left.
In this case, the bidding stops when John and Paul bid $70 (or slightly higher). 
At this price, John and Paul are each happy to buy an album, and George and 
Ringo are not willing to bid any higher. John and Paul each receive consumer sur-
plus equal to his willingness to pay minus the price. John’s consumer surplus is 
$30, and Paul’s is $10. John’s consumer surplus is higher now than in the previous 
example because he gets the same album but pays less for it. The total consumer 
surplus in the market is $40.
7-1b Using the Demand Curve to Measure 
Consumer Surplus
Consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve for a product. To see 
how they are related, let’s continue our example and consider the demand curve 
for this rare Elvis Presley album.
We begin by using the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers to find 
the market demand schedule for the album. The table in Figure 1 shows the de-
mand schedule that corresponds to Table 1. If the price is above $100, the quantity 
demanded in the market is 0 because no buyer is willing to pay that much. If the 
price is between $80 and $100, the quantity demanded is 1 because only John is 
willing to pay such a high price. If the price is between $70 and $80, the quantity 
demanded is 2 because both John and Paul are willing to pay the price. We can 
continue this analysis for other prices as well. In this way, the demand schedule is 
derived from the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers.
The graph in Figure 1 shows the demand curve that corresponds to this ­demand 
schedule. Note the relationship between the height of the demand curve and the 
buyers’ willingness to pay. At any quantity, the price given by the demand curve 
shows the willingness to pay of the marginal buyer, the buyer who would leave the 
market first if the price were any higher. At a quantity of 4 albums, for instance, the 
demand curve has a height of $50, the price that Ringo (the marginal buyer) is will-
ing to pay for an album. At a quantity of 3 albums, the demand curve has a height 
of $70, the price that George (who is now the marginal buyer) is willing to pay.

PART III	
MARKETS AND WELFARE
Because the demand curve reflects buyers’ willingness to pay, we can also 
use it to measure consumer surplus. Figure 2 uses the demand curve to compute 
consumer surplus in our two examples. In panel (a), the price is $80 (or slightly 
above) and the quantity demanded is 1. Note that the area above the price and 
below the demand curve equals $20. This amount is exactly the consumer surplus 
we computed earlier when only 1 album is sold.
Panel (b) of Figure 2 shows consumer surplus when the price is $70 (or slightly 
above). In this case, the area above the price and below the demand curve equals 
the total area of the two rectangles: John’s consumer surplus at this price is $30 
and Paul’s is $10. This area equals a total of $40. Once again, this amount is the 
consumer surplus we computed earlier.
The lesson from this example holds for all demand curves: The area below the 
demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market. This is 
true because the height of the demand curve measures the value buyers place on 
the good, as measured by their willingness to pay for it. The difference between 
this willingness to pay and the market price is each buyer’s consumer surplus. 
Thus, the total area below the demand curve and above the price is the sum of the 
consumer surplus of all buyers in the market for a good or service.
7-1c How a Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus
Because buyers always want to pay less for the goods they buy, a lower price 
makes buyers of a good better off. But how much does buyers’ well-being rise in 
response to a lower price? We can use the concept of consumer surplus to answer 
this question precisely.
FIGURE 1
The table shows the demand schedule for the buyers (listed in Table 1) of the mint-
condition copy of Elvis Presley’s first album. The graph shows the corresponding demand 
curve. Note that the height of the demand curve reflects the buyers’ willingness to pay.

CHAPTER 7  CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
139
Figure 3 shows a typical demand curve. You may notice that this curve grad-
ually slopes downward instead of taking discrete steps as in the previous two 
­figures. In a market with many buyers, the resulting steps from each buyer 
dropping out are so small that they form, in essence, a smooth curve. Although 
this curve has a different shape, the ideas we have just developed still apply: 
­Consumer surplus is the area above the price and below the demand curve. In 
panel (a), consumer surplus at a price of P1 is the area of triangle ABC.
Now suppose that the price falls from P1 to P2, as shown in panel (b). The con-
sumer surplus now equals the area ADF. The increase in consumer surplus attrib-
utable to the lower price is the area BCFD.
This increase in consumer surplus is composed of two parts. First, those buy-
ers who were already buying Q1 of the good at the higher price P1 are better off 
because they now pay less. The increase in consumer surplus of existing buyers 
is the reduction in the amount they pay; it equals the area of the rectangle BCED. 
Second, some new buyers enter the market because they are willing to buy the 
good at the lower price. As a result, the quantity demanded in the market in-
creases from Q1 to Q2. The consumer surplus these newcomers receive is the area 
of the triangle CEF.
7-1d What Does Consumer Surplus Measure?
Our goal in developing the concept of consumer surplus is to make judgments 
about the desirability of market outcomes. Now that you have seen what con-
sumer surplus is, let’s consider whether it is a good measure of economic 
well-being.
FIGURE 2
In panel (a), the price of the good is $80 and the consumer surplus is $20. In panel (b), the 
price of the good is $70 and the consumer surplus is $40.

PART III	
MARKETS AND WELFARE
Imagine that you are a policymaker trying to design a good economic system. 
Would you care about the amount of consumer surplus? Consumer surplus, the 
amount that buyers are willing to pay for a good minus the amount they actu-
ally pay for it, measures the benefit that buyers receive from a good as the buyers 
themselves perceive it. Thus, consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well-
being if policymakers want to respect the preferences of buyers.
In some circumstances, policymakers might choose to disregard consumer sur-
plus because they do not respect the preferences that drive buyer behavior. For 
example, drug addicts are willing to pay a high price for heroin. Yet we would not 
say that addicts get a large benefit from being able to buy heroin at a low price 
(even though addicts might say they do). From the standpoint of society, willing-
ness to pay in this instance is not a good measure of the buyers’ benefit, and con-
sumer surplus is not a good measure of economic well-being, because addicts are 
not looking after their own best interests.
In most markets, however, consumer surplus does reflect economic well-­being. 
Economists normally assume that buyers are rational when they make deci-
sions. Rational people do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given their 
­opportunities. Economists also normally assume that people’s preferences should 
be respected. In this case, consumers are the best judges of how much benefit they 
receive from the goods they buy.
FIGURE 3
In panel (a), the price is P1, the quantity demanded is Q1, and consumer surplus equals 
the area of the triangle ABC. When the price falls from P1 to P2, as in panel (b), the 
quantity demanded rises from Q1 to Q2 and the consumer surplus rises to the area of the 
triangle ADF. The increase in consumer surplus (area BCFD) occurs in part because exist-
ing consumers now pay less (area BCED) and in part because new consumers enter the 
market at the lower price (area CEF).

CHAPTER 7  CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS

7-2 Producer Surplus
We now turn to the other side of the market and consider the benefits sellers re-
ceive from participating in a market. As you will see, our analysis of sellers’ wel-
fare is similar to our analysis of buyers’ welfare.
7-2a Cost and the Willingness to Sell
Imagine now that you are a homeowner and you want to get your house painted. 
You turn to four sellers of painting services: Mary, Frida, Georgia, and Grandma. 
Each painter is willing to do the work for you if the price is right. You decide to 
take bids from the four painters and auction off the job to the painter who will do 
the work for the lowest price.
Each painter is willing to take the job if the price she would receive exceeds 
her cost of doing the work. Here the term cost should be interpreted as the paint-
ers’ opportunity cost: It includes the painters’ out-of-pocket expenses (for paint, 
brushes, and so on) as well as the value that the painters place on their own time. 
Table 2 shows each painter’s cost. Because a painter’s cost is the lowest price she 
would accept for her work, cost is a measure of her willingness to sell her services. 
Each painter would be eager to sell her services at a price greater than her cost 
and would refuse to sell her services at a price less than her cost. At a price exactly 
equal to her cost, she would be indifferent about selling her services: She would be 
equally happy getting the job or using her time and energy for another purpose.
When you take bids from the painters, the price might start high, but it quickly 
falls as the painters compete for the job. Once Grandma has bid $600 (or slightly 
less), she is the sole remaining bidder. Grandma is happy to do the job for this 
price because her cost is only $500. Mary, Frida, and Georgia are unwilling to do 
the job for less than $600. Note that the job goes to the painter who can do the 
work at the lowest cost.
What benefit does Grandma receive from getting the job? Because she is will-
ing to do the work for $500 but gets $600 for doing it, we say that she receives 
producer surplus of $100. Producer surplus is the amount a seller is paid minus 
the cost of production. Producer surplus measures the benefit sellers receive from 
participating in a market.
Now consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you have two 
houses that need painting. Again, you auction off the jobs to the four painters. To 
keep things simple, let’s assume that no painter is able to paint both houses and 
that you will pay the same amount to paint each house. Therefore, the price falls 
until two painters are left.

MARKETS AND WELFARE
In this case, the bidding stops when Georgia and Grandma each offer to do the 
job for a price of $800 (or slightly less). Georgia and Grandma are willing to do 
the work at this price, while Mary and Frida are not willing to bid a lower price. 
At a price of $800, Grandma receives producer surplus of $300 and Georgia re-
ceives producer surplus of $200. The total producer surplus in the market is $500.
7-2b Using the Supply Curve to Measure 
Producer Surplus
Just as consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve, producer surplus 
is closely related to the supply curve. To see how, let’s continue our example.
We begin by using the costs of the four painters to find the supply schedule 
for painting services. The table in Figure 4 shows the supply schedule that corre-
sponds to the costs in Table 2. If the price is below $500, none of the four painters 
is willing to do the job, so the quantity supplied is zero. If the price is between 
$500 and $600, only Grandma is willing to do the job, so the quantity supplied 
is 1. If the price is between $600 and $800, Grandma and Georgia are willing to 
do the job, so the quantity supplied is 2, and so on. Thus, the supply schedule is 
derived from the costs of the four painters.
The graph in Figure 4 shows the supply curve that corresponds to this supply 
schedule. Note that the height of the supply curve is related to the sellers’ costs. 
At any quantity, the price given by the supply curve shows the cost of the marginal 
seller, the seller who would leave the market first if the price were any lower. At a 
quantity of 4 houses, for instance, the supply curve has a height of $900, the cost 
that Mary (the marginal seller) incurs to provide her painting services. At a quan-
tity of 3 houses, the supply curve has a height of $800, the cost that Frida (who is 
now the marginal seller) incurs.
FIGURE 4
The table shows the supply schedule for the sellers (listed in Table 2) of painting ser-
vices. The graph shows the corresponding supply curve. Note that the height of the  
supply curve reflects the sellers’ costs.

CHAPTER 7  CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS

Because the supply curve reflects sellers’ costs, we can use it to measure pro-
ducer surplus. Figure 5 uses the supply curve to compute producer surplus in our 
two examples. In panel (a), we assume that the price is $600 (or slightly less). In 
this case, the quantity supplied is 1. Note that the area below the price and above 
the supply curve equals $100. This amount is exactly the producer surplus we 
computed earlier for Grandma.
Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows producer surplus at a price of $800 (or slightly less). 
In this case, the area below the price and above the supply curve equals the total 
area of the two rectangles. This area equals $500, the producer surplus we com-
puted earlier for Georgia and Grandma when two houses needed painting.
The lesson from this example applies to all supply curves: The area below the 
price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market. The logic 
is straightforward: The height of the supply curve measures sellers’ costs, and the 
difference between the price and the cost of production is each seller’s producer 
surplus. Thus, the total area is the sum of the producer surplus of all sellers.
7-2c  How a Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus
You will not be surprised to hear that sellers always want to receive a higher price 
for the goods they sell. But how much does sellers’ well-being rise in response to 
a higher price? The concept of producer surplus offers a precise answer to this 
question.
Figure 6 shows a typical upward-sloping supply curve that would arise in a 
market with many sellers. Although this supply curve differs in shape from the 
previous figure, we measure producer surplus in the same way: Producer surplus 
FIGURE 5

is the area below the price and above the supply curve. In panel (a), the price is P1 
and producer surplus is the area of triangle ABC.
Panel (b) shows what happens when the price rises from P1 to P2. Producer sur-
plus now equals the area ADF. This increase in producer surplus has two parts. 
First, those sellers who were already selling Q1 of the good at the lower price P1 
are better off because they now get more for what they sell. The increase in pro-
ducer surplus for existing sellers equals the area of the rectangle BCED. Second, 
some new sellers enter the market because they are willing to produce the good 
at the higher price, resulting in an increase in the quantity supplied from Q1 to Q2. 
The producer surplus of these newcomers is the area of the triangle CEF.
As this analysis shows, we use producer surplus to measure the well-being of 
sellers in much the same way as we use consumer surplus to measure the well-being 
of buyers. Because these two measures of economic welfare are so similar, it is natu-
ral to use them together. And indeed, that is exactly what we do in the next section.
FIGURE 6
In panel (a), the price is P1, the quantity demanded is Q1, and producer surplus equals 
the area of the triangle ABC. When the price rises from P1 to P2, as in panel (b), the 
quantity supplied rises from Q1 to Q2 and the producer surplus rises to the area of the 
triangle ADF. The increase in producer surplus (area BCFD) occurs in part because exist-
ing producers now receive more (area BCED) and in part because new producers enter 
the market at the higher price (area CEF).

7-3 Market Efficiency
Consumer surplus and producer surplus are the basic tools that economists use 
to study the welfare of buyers and sellers in a market. These tools can help us ad-
dress a fundamental economic question: Is the allocation of resources determined 
by free markets desirable?

CHAPTER 7  CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS

7-3a The Benevolent Social Planner
To evaluate market outcomes, we introduce into our analysis a new, hypotheti-
cal character called the benevolent social planner. The benevolent social planner 
is an all-knowing, all-powerful, well-intentioned dictator. The planner wants to 
maximize the economic well-being of everyone in society. What should this plan-
ner do? Should she just leave buyers and sellers at the equilibrium that they reach 
naturally on their own? Or can she increase economic well-being by altering the 
market outcome in some way?
To answer this question, the planner must first decide how to measure the eco-
nomic well-being of a society. One possible measure is the sum of consumer and 
producer surplus, which we call total surplus. Consumer surplus is the benefit that 
buyers receive from participating in a market, and producer surplus is the benefit 
that sellers receive. It is therefore natural to use total surplus as a measure of soci-
ety’s economic well-being.
To better understand this measure of economic well-being, recall how we mea-
sure consumer and producer surplus. We define consumer surplus as
Consumer surplus 5 Value to buyers 2 Amount paid by buyers.
Similarly, we define producer surplus as
Producer surplus 5 Amount received by sellers 2 Cost to sellers.
When we add consumer and producer surplus together, we obtain
Total surplus 5 (Value to buyers 2 Amount paid by buyers)
1 (Amount received by sellers 2 Cost to sellers).
The amount paid by buyers equals the amount received by sellers, so the mid-
dle two terms in this expression cancel each other. As a result, we can write total 
­surplus as
Total surplus 5 Value to buyers 2 Cost to sellers.
Total surplus in a market is the total value to buyers of the goods, as measured by 
their willingness to pay, minus the total cost to sellers of providing those goods.
If an allocation of resources maximizes total surplus, we say that the alloca-
tion exhibits efficiency. If an allocation is not efficient, then some of the potential 
gains from trade among buyers and sellers are not being realized. For example, 
an allocation is inefficient if a good is not being produced by the sellers with low-
est cost. In this case, moving production from a high-cost producer to a low-cost 
producer will lower the total cost to sellers and raise total surplus. Similarly, an 
allocation is inefficient if a good is not being consumed by the buyers who value 
it most highly. In this case, moving consumption of the good from a buyer with a 
low valuation to a buyer with a high valuation will raise total surplus.
In addition to efficiency, the social planner might also care about equality—
that is, whether the various buyers and sellers in the market have a similar level 
of economic well-being. In essence, the gains from trade in a market are like a 
pie to be shared among the market participants. The question of efficiency con-
cerns whether the pie is as big as possible. The question of equality concerns how 
the pie is sliced and how the portions are distributed among members of society. 
In this chapter, we concentrate on efficiency as the social planner’s goal. Keep in 
mind, however, that real policymakers often care about equality as well.

MARKETS AND WELFARE
7-3b Evaluating the Market Equilibrium
Figure 7 shows consumer and producer surplus when a market reaches the equilib-
rium of supply and demand. Recall that consumer surplus equals the area above the 
price and under the demand curve and producer surplus equals the area below the 
price and above the supply curve. Thus, the total area between the supply and de-
mand curves up to the point of equilibrium represents the total surplus in this market.
Is this equilibrium allocation of resources efficient? That is, does it maximize total 
surplus? To answer this question, recall that when a market is in equilibrium, the price 
determines which buyers and sellers participate in the market. Those buyers who 
value the good more than the price (represented by the segment AE on the demand 
curve) choose to buy the good; buyers who value it less than the price (represented by 
the segment EB) do not. Similarly, those sellers whose costs are less than the price (rep-
resented by the segment CE on the supply curve) choose to produce and sell the good; 
sellers whose costs are greater than the price (represented by the segment ED) do not.
These observations lead to two insights about market outcomes:
	 1.	 Free markets allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value them most 
highly, as measured by their willingness to pay.
	 2.	 Free markets allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can produce 
them at the lowest cost.
Thus, given the quantity produced and sold in a market equilibrium, the social 
planner cannot increase economic well-being by changing the allocation of con-
sumption among buyers or the allocation of production among sellers.
But can the social planner raise total economic well-being by increasing or de-
creasing the quantity of the good? The answer is no, as stated in this third insight 
about market outcomes:
	 3.	 Free markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum of con-
sumer and producer surplus.

CHAPTER 7  CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS

Figure 8 illustrates why this is true. To interpret this figure, keep in mind that the 
demand curve reflects the value to buyers and the supply curve reflects the cost 
to sellers. At any quantity below the equilibrium level, such as Q1, the value to the 
marginal buyer exceeds the cost to the marginal seller. As a result, increasing the 
quantity produced and consumed raises total surplus. This continues to be true 
until the quantity reaches the equilibrium level. Similarly, at any quantity beyond 
the equilibrium level, such as Q2, the value to the marginal buyer is less than the 
cost to the marginal seller. In this case, decreasing the quantity raises total sur-
plus, and this continues to be true until quantity falls to the equilibrium level. To 
maximize total surplus, the social planner would choose the quantity where the 
supply and demand curves intersect.
Together, these three insights tell us that the market outcome makes the sum of 
consumer and producer surplus as large as it can be. In other words, the equilib-
rium outcome is an efficient allocation of resources. The benevolent social planner 
can, therefore, leave the market outcome just as she finds it. This policy of leav-
ing well enough alone goes by the French expression laissez faire, which literally 
translates to “leave to do” but is more broadly interpreted as “let people do as 
they will.”
Society is lucky that the planner doesn’t need to intervene. Although it has been 
a useful exercise imagining what an all-knowing, all-powerful, well-­intentioned 
dictator would do, let’s face it: Such characters are hard to come by. Dictators are 
rarely benevolent, and even if we found someone so virtuous, she would lack 
crucial information.
Suppose our social planner tried to choose an efficient allocation of resources 
on her own, instead of relying on market forces. To do so, she would need to 
know the value of a particular good to every potential consumer in the market 
and the cost of every potential producer. And she would need this information 
not only for this market but for every one of the many thousands of markets in 
FIGURE 8
The Efficiency of the Equilibrium Quantity
At quantities less than the equilibrium 
quantity, such as Q1, the value to buyers 
exceeds the cost to sellers. At quantities 
greater than the equilibrium quantity, 
such as Q2, the cost to sellers exceeds 
the value to buyers. Therefore, the mar-
ket equilibrium maximizes the sum of 
producer and consumer surplus.

A Meter So Expensive, It 
Creates Parking Spots
By Michael Cooper and Jo Craven 
McGinty
S
AN FRANCISCO—The maddening quest 
for street parking is not just a tribulation 
for drivers, but a trial for cities. As much as 
a third of the traffic in some areas has been 
attributed to drivers circling as they hunt for 
spaces. The wearying tradition takes a toll 
in lost time, polluted air and, when drivers 
despair, double-parked cars that clog traffic 
even more.
But San Francisco is trying to shorten the 
hunt with an ambitious experiment that aims 
to make sure that there is always at least one 
empty parking spot available on every block 
that has meters. The program, which uses 
new technology and the law of supply and 
demand, raises the price of parking on the 
city’s most crowded blocks and lowers it on 
its emptiest blocks. While the new prices are 
still being phased in—the most expensive 
spots have risen to $4.50 an hour, but could 
reach $6—preliminary data suggests that 
the change may be having a positive effect in 
some areas.
Change can already be seen on a 
stretch of Drumm Street downtown near the 
­Embarcadero and the popular restaurants at 
the Ferry Building. Last summer it was nearly 
impossible to find spots there. But after the 
city gradually raised the price of parking to 
$4.50 an hour from $3.50, high-tech sensors 
embedded in the street showed that spots 
were available a little more often—leaving 
a welcome space the other day for the sil-
ver Toyota Corolla driven by Victor Chew, a 
salesman for a commercial dishwasher com-
pany who frequently parks in the area.
“There are more spots available now,” 
said Mr. Chew, 48. “Now I don’t have to walk 
half a mile.”
San Francisco’s parking experiment is the 
latest major attempt to improve the uneasy re-
lationship between cities and the internal com-
bustion engine—a century-long saga that has 
seen cities build highways and tear them down, 
widen streets and narrow them, and make 
more parking available at some times and 
discourage it at others, all to try to make their 
downtowns accessible but not too congested.
The program here is being closely watched 
by cities around the country. With the help of a

of its 26,800 metered spots to track when and 
where cars are parked. And beginning last 
The Invisible Hand Can

the economy. The task is practically impossible, which explains why centrally 
planned economies never work very well.
The planner’s job becomes easy, however, once she takes on a partner: Adam 
Smith’s invisible hand of the marketplace. The invisible hand takes all the infor-
mation about buyers and sellers into account and guides everyone in the market 
to the best outcome as judged by the standard of economic efficiency. It is, truly, 
a remarkable feat. That is why economists so often advocate free markets as the 
best way to organize economic activity.
Should There Be a Market in Organs?
Some years ago, the front page of the Boston Globe ran the headline 
“How a Mother’s Love Helped Save Two Lives.” The newspaper told the 
story of Susan Stephens, a woman whose son needed a kidney transplant. 
When the doctor learned that the mother’s kidney was not compatible, he pro-
posed a novel solution: If Stephens donated one of her kidneys to a stranger, her 
son would move to the top of the kidney waiting list. The mother accepted the 
deal, and soon two patients had the transplants they were waiting for.

CHAPTER 7  CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS

summer, the city began tweaking its prices 
every two months—giving it the option of 
raising them 25 cents an hour, or lowering 
them by as much as 50 cents—in the hope of 
leaving each block with at least one available 
spot. The city also has cut prices at many of 
the garages and parking lots it manages, to 
lure cars off the street….
The program is the biggest test yet of the 
theories of Donald Shoup, a professor of urban 
planning at the University of California, Los 
Angeles. His 2005 book, “The High Cost of Free 
Parking,” made him something of a cult fig-
ure to city planners—a Facebook group, The 
Shoupistas, has more than a thousand mem-
bers. “I think the basic idea is that we will see 
a lot of benefits if we get the price of curbside 
parking right, which is the lowest price a city 
can charge and still have one or two vacant 
spaces available on every block,” he said.
But raising prices is rarely popular. A 
chapter in Mr. Shoup’s book opens with a quote 
from George Costanza, the “Seinfeld” char-
acter: “My father didn’t pay for parking, my 
mother, my brother, nobody. It’s like going to 
a prostitute. Why should I pay when, if I apply 
myself, maybe I can get it for free?” Some San 
Francisco neighborhoods recently objected to 
a proposal to install meters on streets where 
parking is now free. And raising prices in the 
most desirable areas raises concerns that it 
will make them less accessible to the poor.
That was on the minds of some parkers on 
Drumm Street, where the midday occupancy 
rate on one block fell to 86 percent from 98 
percent after prices rose. Edward Saldate, 55, a 
hairstylist who paid nearly $17 for close to four 
hours of parking there, called it “a big rip-off.”
Tom Randlett, 69, an accountant, said 
that he was pleased to be able to find a spot 
there for the first time, but acknowledged 
that the program was “complicated on the 
social equity level.”
Officials note that parking rates are cut 
as often as they are raised. And Professor 
Shoup said that the program would benefit 
many poor people, including the many San 
Franciscans who do not have cars, because 
all parking revenues are used for mass tran-
sit and any reduction in traffic will speed 
the buses many people here rely on. And he 
imagined a day when drivers will no longer 
attribute good parking spots to luck or karma.
“It will be taken for granted,” he said, 
“the way you take it for granted that when 
you go to a store you can get fresh bananas 
or apples.”

The ingenuity of the doctor’s proposal and the nobility of the mother’s act 
cannot be doubted. But the story raises some intriguing questions. If the mother 
could trade a kidney for a kidney, would the hospital allow her to trade a kidney 
for an expensive, experimental cancer treatment that she could not otherwise af-
ford? Should she be allowed to exchange her kidney for free tuition for her son at 
the hospital’s medical school? Should she be able to sell her kidney so she can use 
the cash to trade in her old Chevy for a new Lexus?
As a matter of public policy, our society makes it illegal for people to sell their 
organs. In essence, in the market for organs, the government has imposed a price 
ceiling of zero. The result, as with any binding price ceiling, is a shortage of the 
good. The deal in the Stephens case did not fall under this prohibition because no 
cash changed hands.
Many economists believe that there would be large benefits to allowing a free 
market in organs. People are born with two kidneys, but they usually need only 
one. Meanwhile, a few people suffer from illnesses that leave them without any 
working kidney. Despite the obvious gains from trade, the current situation is 
dire: The typical patient has to wait several years for a kidney transplant, and 
every year thousands of people die because a compatible kidney cannot be found.

PART III	
MARKETS AND WELFARE
If those needing a kidney were allowed to buy one from those who have two, the 
price would rise to balance supply and demand. Sellers would be better off with 
the extra cash in their pockets. Buyers would be better off with the organ they 
need to save their lives. The shortage of kidneys would disappear.
Such a market would lead to an efficient allocation of resources, but critics of 
this plan worry about fairness. A market for organs, they argue, would benefit the 
rich at the expense of the poor because organs would then be allocated to those 
most willing and able to pay. But you can also question the fairness of the current 
system. Now, most of us walk around with an extra organ that we don’t really 
need, while some of our fellow citizens are dying to get one. Is that fair? 
7-4 Conclusion: Market Efficiency 
and Market Failure
This chapter introduced the basic tools of welfare economics—consumer and 
producer surplus—and used them to evaluate the efficiency of free markets. We 
showed that the forces of supply and demand allocate resources efficiently. That 
is, even though each buyer and seller in a market is concerned only about her own 
welfare, together they are led by an invisible hand to an equilibrium that maxi-
mizes the total benefits to buyers and sellers.
A word of warning is in order. To conclude that markets are efficient, we made 
several assumptions about how markets work. When these assumptions do not 
hold, our conclusion that the market equilibrium is efficient may no longer be 
true. As we close this chapter, let’s consider briefly two of the most important of 
these assumptions.
First, our analysis assumed that markets are perfectly competitive. In actual 
economies, however, competition is sometimes far from perfect. In some markets, 
a single buyer or seller (or a small group of them) may be able to control market 
prices. This ability to influence prices is called market power. Market power can 
cause markets to be inefficient because it keeps the price and quantity away from 
the levels determined by the equilibrium of supply and demand.
Second, our analysis assumed that the outcome in a market matters only to the 
buyers and sellers who participate in that market. Yet sometimes the decisions of 
buyers and sellers affect people who are not participants in the market at all. Pol-
lution is the classic example. The use of agricultural pesticides, for instance, affects 
not only the manufacturers who make them and the farmers who use them but 
many others who breathe air or drink water that has been polluted with these pes-
ticides. When a market exhibits such side effects, called externalities, the welfare 
implications of market activity depend on more than just the value obtained by the 
buyers and the cost incurred by the sellers. Because buyers and sellers may ignore 
these side effects when deciding how much to consume and produce, the equilib-
rium in a market can be inefficient from the standpoint of society as a whole.
Market power and externalities are examples of a general phenomenon called 
market failure—the inability of some unregulated markets to allocate resources effi-
ciently. When markets fail, public policy can potentially remedy the problem and 
increase economic efficiency. Microeconomists devote much effort to studying

when market failure is likely and what sorts of policies are best at correcting mar-
ket failures. As you continue your study of economics, you will see that the tools 
of welfare economics developed here are readily adapted to that endeavor.
Despite the possibility of market failure, the invisible hand of the marketplace 
is extraordinarily important. In many markets, the assumptions we made in this 
chapter work well and the conclusion of market efficiency applies directly. More-
over, we can use our analysis of welfare economics and market efficiency to shed 
light on the effects of various government policies. In the next two chapters, we 
apply the tools we have just developed to study two important policy issues—the 
welfare effects of taxation and of international trade.
•	
Consumer surplus equals buyers’ willingness to pay 
for a good minus the amount they actually pay, and 
it measures the benefit buyers get from participating 
in a market. Consumer surplus can be computed by 
finding the area below the demand curve and above 
the price.
•	
Producer surplus equals the amount sellers receive 
for their goods minus their costs of production, and it 
measures the benefit sellers get from participating in a 
market. Producer surplus can be computed by finding 
the area below the price and above the supply curve.
•	
An allocation of resources that maximizes the sum of 
consumer and producer surplus is said to be efficient. 
Policymakers are often concerned with the efficiency, 
as well as the equality, of economic outcomes.
•	
The equilibrium of supply and demand maximizes 
the sum of consumer and producer surplus. That is, 
the ­invisible hand of the marketplace leads buyers and 
sellers to allocate resources efficiently.
•	
Markets do not allocate resources efficiently in the 
presence of market failures such as market power or 
externalities.

  7.	 The cost of producing flat-screen TVs has fallen over 
the past decade. Let’s consider some implications of 
this fact.
a.	 Draw a supply-and-demand diagram to show the 
effect of falling production costs on the price and 
quantity of flat-screen TVs sold.
b.	 In your diagram, show what happens to consumer 
surplus and producer surplus.
c.	 Suppose the supply of flat-screen TVs is very

costs—consumers or producers of these TVs?
  8.	 There are four consumers willing to pay the following 
amounts for haircuts:
Gloria: $7
Jay: $2
Claire: $8
Phil: $5
There are four haircutting businesses with the follow-
ing costs:
Firm A: $3
Firm B: $6
Firm C: $4
Firm D: $2
Each firm has the capacity to produce only one 
­haircut. For efficiency, how many haircuts should be 
given? Which businesses should cut hair and which 
consumers should have their hair cut? How large is 
the maximum possible total surplus?
  9.	 One of the largest changes in the economy over the 
past several decades is that technological advances 
have reduced the cost of making computers.
a.	 Draw a supply-and-demand diagram to show 
what happened to price, quantity, consumer 
surplus, and producer surplus in the market for 
computers.
b.	 Forty years ago, students used typewriters to pre-
pare papers for their classes; today they use com-
puters. Does that make computers and typewriters 
complements or substitutes? Use a supply-and-
demand diagram to show what happened to price,

in the market for typewriters. Should typewriter 
producers have been happy or sad about the tech-
nological advance in computers?
c.	 Are computers and software complements or sub-

  10.	A friend of yours is considering two cell phone service 
providers. Provider A charges $120 per month for the 
service regardless of the number of phone calls made. 
Provider B does not have a fixed service fee but instead 
charges $1 per minute for calls. Your friend’s monthly 
demand for minutes of calling is given by the equation 
QD = 150 – 50P, where P is the price of a minute.
a.	 With each provider, what is the cost to your friend 
of an extra minute on the phone?
b.	 In light of your answer to (a), how many minutes 
with each provider would your friend talk on the 
phone?
c.	 How much would she end up paying each pro-
vider every month?
d.	 How much consumer surplus would she obtain 
with each provider? (Hint: Graph the demand 
curve and recall the formula for the area of a 
triangle.)
e.	 Which provider would you recommend that your 
friend choose? Why?
11.	 Consider how health insurance affects the quantity 
of healthcare services performed. Suppose that the 
typical medical procedure has a cost of $100, yet a 
person with health insurance pays only $20 out of 
pocket. Her insurance company pays the remaining 
$80. (The insurance company recoups the $80 through 
premiums, but the premium a person pays does not 
depend on how many procedures that person chooses 
to undertake.)
a.	 Draw the demand curve in the market for medical 
care. (In your diagram, the horizontal axis should 
represent the number of medical procedures.) 
Show the quantity of procedures demanded if each 
procedure has a price of $100.
b.	 On your diagram, show the quantity of procedures 
demanded if consumers pay only $20 per proce-
dure. If the cost of each procedure to society is truly 
$100, and if individuals have health insurance as 
just described, will the number of procedures per-
formed maximize total surplus? Explain.
c.	 Economists often blame the health insurance sys-
tem for excessive use of medical care. Given your 
analysis, why might the use of care be viewed as 
“excessive”?
d.	 What sort of policies might prevent this excessive 
use?

The Costs of 
Taxation
T
axes are often a source of heated political debate. In 1776, the anger of the 
American colonists over British taxes sparked the American Revolution. More 
than two centuries later, the American political parties continue to debate the 
proper size and shape of the tax system. Yet no one would deny that some level 
of taxation is necessary. As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., once said, “Taxes are what 
we pay for civilized society.”
Because taxation has such a major impact on the modern economy, we return 
to the topic several times throughout this book as we expand the set of tools we 
have at our disposal. We began our study of taxes in Chapter 6. There we 
saw how a tax on a good affects its price and the quantity sold and how the 
forces of supply and demand divide the burden of a tax between buyers and 
sellers. In this chapter, we extend this analysis and look at how taxes affect 
welfare, the economic well-being of participants in a market. In other words, 
we see how high the price of civilized society can be.

Markets and Welfare
The effects of taxes on welfare might at first seem obvious. The government en-
acts taxes to raise revenue and that revenue must come out of someone’s pocket. 
As we saw in Chapter 6, both buyers and sellers are worse off when a good is 
taxed: A tax raises the price buyers pay and lowers the price sellers receive. Yet to 
understand more fully how taxes affect economic well-being, we must compare 
the reduced welfare of buyers and sellers to the amount of revenue the govern-
ment raises. The tools of consumer and producer surplus allow us to make this 
comparison. Our analysis will show that the cost of taxes to buyers and sellers 
typically exceeds the revenue raised by the government.
FIGURE 1

8-1 The Deadweight Loss of Taxation
We begin by recalling one of the surprising lessons from Chapter 6: The impact of 
a tax on a market outcome is the same whether the tax is levied on buyers or sell-
ers of a good. When a tax is levied on buyers, the demand curve shifts downward 
by the size of the tax; when it is levied on sellers, the supply curve shifts upward 
by that amount. In either case, when the tax is enacted, the price paid by buyers 
rises, and the price received by sellers falls. In the end, the elasticities of supply 
and demand determine how the tax burden is distributed between producers and 
consumers. This distribution is the same regardless of how it is levied.
Figure 1 shows these effects. To simplify our discussion, this figure does not 
show a shift in either the supply or demand curve, although one curve must shift. 
Which curve shifts depends on whether the tax is levied on sellers (the supply 
curve shifts) or buyers (the demand curve shifts). In this chapter, we can keep the 
analysis general and simplify the graphs by not bothering to show the shift. The 
key result for our purposes here is that the tax places a wedge between the price 
buyers pay and the price sellers receive. Because of this tax wedge, the quantity 
sold falls below the level that would be sold without a tax. In other words, a tax on

CHAPTER 8  APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION

a good causes the size of the market for the good to shrink. These results should 
be familiar from Chapter 6.
8-1a How a Tax Affects Market Participants
Let’s use the tools of welfare economics to measure the gains and losses from a tax 
on a good. To do this, we must take into account how the tax affects buyers, sell-
ers, and the government. The benefit received by buyers in a market is measured 
by consumer surplus—the amount buyers are willing to pay for the good minus 
the amount they actually pay for it. The benefit received by sellers in a market 
is measured by producer surplus—the amount sellers receive for the good mi-
nus their costs. These are precisely the measures of economic welfare we used in 
Chapter 7.
What about the third interested party, the government? If T is the size of the tax 
and Q is the quantity of the good sold, then the government gets total tax revenue 
of T × Q. It can use this tax revenue to provide services, such as roads, police, 
and public education, or to help the needy. Therefore, to analyze how taxes affect 
economic well-being, we use the government’s tax revenue to measure the public 
benefit from the tax. Keep in mind, however, that this benefit actually accrues not 
to the government but to those on whom the revenue is spent.
Figure 2 shows that the government’s tax revenue is represented by the rect-
angle between the supply and demand curves. The height of this rectangle is the 
size of the tax, T, and the width of the rectangle is the quantity of the good sold, 
Q. Because a rectangle’s area is its height times its width, this rectangle’s area is 
T × Q, which equals the tax revenue.
Welfare without a Tax  To see how a tax affects welfare, we begin by consider-
ing welfare before the government imposes a tax. Figure 3 shows the supply-and-
demand diagram and marks the key areas with the letters A through F.
Without a tax, the equilibrium price and quantity are found at the intersection 
of the supply and demand curves. The price is P1, and the quantity sold is Q1.

Markets and Welfare
Because the demand curve reflects buyers’ willingness to pay, consumer surplus 
is the area between the demand curve and the price, A + B + C. Similarly, ­because 
the supply curve reflects sellers’ costs, producer surplus is the area between 
the supply curve and the price, D + E + F. In this case, because there is no tax, tax 
revenue equals zero.
Total surplus, the sum of consumer and producer surplus, equals the area 
A + B + C + D + E + F. In other words, as we saw in Chapter 7, total surplus is 
the area between the supply and demand curves up to the equilibrium quantity. 
The first column of the table in Figure 3 summarizes these conclusions.
Welfare with a Tax  Now consider welfare after the tax is enacted. The price paid 
by buyers rises from P1 to PB, so consumer surplus now equals only area A (the 
area below the demand curve and above the buyer’s price). The price received by 
sellers falls from P1 to PS, so producer surplus now equals only area F (the area 
above the supply curve and below the seller’s price). The quantity sold falls from 
Q1 to Q2, and the government collects tax revenue equal to the area B + D.
FIGURE 3
A tax on a good reduces consumer surplus (by the area B + C) and producer surplus (by 
the area D + E). Because the fall in producer and consumer surplus exceeds tax revenue 
(area B + D), the tax is said to impose a deadweight loss (area C + E).

CHAPTER 8  APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION

To compute total surplus with the tax, we add consumer surplus, producer sur-
plus, and tax revenue. Thus, we find that total surplus is area A + B + D + F. The 
second column of the table summarizes these results.
Changes in Welfare  We can now see the effects of the tax by comparing welfare 
before and after the tax is enacted. The third column of the table in Figure 3 shows 
the changes. The tax causes consumer surplus to fall by the area B + C and produc-
er surplus to fall by the area D + E. Tax revenue rises by the area B + D. Not sur-
prisingly, the tax makes buyers and sellers worse off and the government better off.
The change in total welfare includes the change in consumer surplus (which is 
negative), the change in producer surplus (which is also negative), and the change 
in tax revenue (which is positive). When we add these three pieces together, we 
find that total surplus in the market falls by the area C + E. Thus, the losses to buy-
ers and sellers from a tax exceed the revenue raised by the government. The fall in total 
surplus that results when a tax (or some other policy) distorts a market outcome is 
called a deadweight loss. The area C + E measures the size of the deadweight loss.
To understand why taxes impose deadweight losses, recall one of the Ten Prin-
ciples of Economics in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. In Chapter 7, we 
saw that free markets normally allocate scarce resources efficiently. That is, in the 
absence of any tax, the equilibrium of supply and demand maximizes the total 
surplus of buyers and sellers in a market. When the government imposes a tax, 
it raises the price buyers pay and lowers the price sellers receive, giving buyers 
an incentive to consume less and sellers an incentive to produce less. As buyers 
and sellers respond to these incentives, the size of the market shrinks below its 
optimum (as shown in the figure by the movement from Q1 to Q2). Thus, because 
taxes distort incentives, they cause markets to allocate resources inefficiently.
8-1b Deadweight Losses and the Gains from Trade
To get some further insight into why taxes result in deadweight losses, consider 
an example. Imagine that Joe cleans Jane’s house each week for $100. The oppor-
tunity cost of Joe’s time is $80, and the value of a clean house to Jane is $120. Thus, 
Joe and Jane each receive a $20 benefit from their deal. The total surplus of $40 
measures the gains from trade in this particular transaction.
Now suppose that the government levies a $50 tax on the providers of cleaning 
services. There is now no price that Jane can pay Joe that will leave both of them 
better off. The most Jane would be willing to pay is $120, but then Joe would be 
left with only $70 after paying the tax, which is less than his $80 opportunity cost. 
Conversely, for Joe to receive his opportunity cost of $80, Jane would need to pay 
$130, which is above the $120 value she places on a clean house. As a result, Jane 
and Joe cancel their arrangement. Joe goes without the income, and Jane lives in a 
dirtier house.
The tax has made Joe and Jane worse off by a total of $40 because they have 
each lost $20 of surplus. But note that the government collects no revenue from 
Joe and Jane because they decide to cancel their arrangement. The $40 is pure 
deadweight loss: It is a loss to buyers and sellers in a market that is not offset 
by an increase in government revenue. From this example, we can see the ulti-
mate source of deadweight losses: Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent 
­buyers and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade.
The area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves created by the 
tax wedge (area C + E in Figure 3) measures these losses. This conclusion can be 
seen more easily in Figure 4 by recalling that the demand curve reflects the value 
deadweight loss
the fall in total surplus 
that results from a market 
distortion, such as a tax

of the good to consumers and that the supply curve reflects the costs of produc-
ers. When the tax raises the price buyers pay to PB and lowers the price sellers re-
ceive to PS, the marginal buyers and sellers leave the market, so the quantity sold 
falls from Q1 to Q2. Yet as the figure shows, the value of the good to these buyers 
still exceeds the cost to these sellers. At every quantity between Q1 and Q2, the 
situation is the same as in our example with Joe and Jane. The gains from trade—
the difference between buyers’ value and sellers’ cost—are less than the tax. As a 
result, these trades are not made once the tax is imposed. The deadweight loss is 
the surplus that is lost because the tax discourages these mutually advantageous 
trades.

8-2 The Determinants of the Deadweight Loss
What determines whether the deadweight loss from a tax is large or small? The 
answer is the price elasticities of supply and demand, which measure how much 
the quantity supplied and quantity demanded respond to changes in the price.
Let’s consider first how the elasticity of supply affects the size of the dead-
weight loss. In the top two panels of Figure 5, the demand curve and the size of 
the tax are the same. The only difference in these figures is the elasticity of the 
supply curve. In panel (a), the supply curve is relatively inelastic: Quantity sup-
plied responds only slightly to changes in the price. In panel (b), the supply curve 
is relatively elastic: Quantity supplied responds substantially to changes in the

price. Notice that the deadweight loss, the area of the triangle between the supply 
and demand curves, is larger when the supply curve is more elastic.
Similarly, the bottom two panels of Figure 5 show how the elasticity of demand 
affects the size of the deadweight loss. Here the supply curve and the size of the 
tax are held constant. In panel (c), the demand curve is relatively inelastic, and 
the deadweight loss is small. In panel (d), the demand curve is more elastic, and the 
deadweight loss from the tax is larger.
The lesson from this figure is apparent. A tax has a deadweight loss because 
it induces buyers and sellers to change their behavior. The tax raises the price 
FIGURE 5
In panels (a) and (b), the demand curve and the size of the tax are the same, but the price 
elasticity of supply is different. Notice that the more elastic the supply curve, the larger the 
deadweight loss of the tax. In panels (c) and (d), the supply curve and the size of the tax are 
the same, but the price elasticity of demand is different. Notice that the more elastic  
the ­demand curve, the larger the deadweight loss of the tax.

paid by buyers, so they consume less. At the same time, the tax lowers the price 
received by sellers, so they produce less. Because of these changes in behavior, the 
equilibrium quantity in the market shrinks below the optimal quantity. The more 
responsive buyers and sellers are to changes in the price, the more the equilibrium 
quantity shrinks.  Hence, the greater the elasticities of supply and demand, the greater 
the deadweight loss of a tax.
The Deadweight Loss Debate
Supply, demand, elasticity, deadweight loss—all this economic theory 
is enough to make your head spin. But believe it or not, these ideas go to 
the heart of a profound political question: How big should the government 
be? The debate hinges on these concepts because the larger the deadweight 
loss of taxation, the larger the cost of any government program. If taxation entails 
large deadweight losses, then these losses are a strong argument for a leaner gov-
ernment that does less and taxes less. But if taxes impose small deadweight losses, 
then government programs are less costly than they otherwise might be.
So how big are the deadweight losses of taxation? Economists disagree on the 
answer to this question. To see the nature of this disagreement, consider the most 
important tax in the U.S. economy: the tax on labor. The Social Security tax, the 
Medicare tax, and much of the federal income tax are labor taxes. Many state gov-
ernments also tax labor earnings. A labor tax places a wedge between the wage 
that firms pay and the wage that workers receive. For a typical worker, if all forms 
of labor taxes are added together, the marginal tax rate on labor income—the tax on 
the last dollar of earnings—is about 40 percent.
The size of the labor tax is easy to determine, but the deadweight loss of this 
tax is less straightforward. Economists disagree about whether this 40 percent la-
bor tax has a small or a large deadweight loss. This disagreement arises because 
economists hold different views about the elasticity of labor supply.
Economists who argue that labor taxes do not greatly distort market outcomes 
believe that labor supply is fairly inelastic. Most people, they claim, would work 
full-time regardless of the wage. If so, the labor supply curve is almost vertical, 
and a tax on labor has a small deadweight loss.
Economists who argue that labor taxes are highly distorting believe that labor 
supply is more elastic. While admitting that some groups of workers may not 
change the quantity of labor they supply by very much in response to changes 
in labor taxes, these economists claim that many other groups respond more to 
incentives. Here are some examples:
•	 Many workers can adjust the number of hours they work—for instance,  
by working overtime. The higher the wage, the more hours they choose to 
work.
•	 Some families have second earners—often married women with children—
with some discretion over whether to do unpaid work at home or paid work 
in the marketplace. When deciding whether to take a job, these second earners 
compare the benefits of being at home (including savings on the cost of child 
care) with the wages they could earn.
•	 Many of the elderly can choose when to retire, and their decisions are partly 
based on the wage. Once they are retired, the wage determines their incentive 
to work part-time.

8-3 Deadweight Loss and Tax Revenue as Taxes Vary
•	 Some people consider engaging in illegal economic activity, such as the drug 
trade, or working at jobs that pay “under the table” to evade taxes. Economists 
call this the underground economy. In deciding whether to work in the under-
ground economy or at a legitimate job, these potential criminals compare what 
they can earn by breaking the law with the wage they can earn legally.
In each of these cases, the quantity of labor supplied responds to the wage (the 
price of labor). Thus, these workers’ decisions are distorted when their labor earn-
ings are taxed. Labor taxes encourage workers to work fewer hours, second earn-
ers to stay at home, the elderly to retire early, and the unscrupulous to enter the 
underground economy.
The debate over the distortionary effects of labor taxation persists to this day. 
Indeed, whenever you see two political candidates debating whether the govern-
ment should provide more services or reduce the tax burden, keep in mind that 
part of the disagreement may rest on different views about the elasticity of labor 
supply and the deadweight loss of taxation.

Quick Quiz  The demand for beer is more elastic than the demand for milk. Would a 
tax on beer or a tax on milk have a larger deadweight loss? Why?
Taxes rarely stay the same for long periods of time. Policymakers in local, state, 
and federal governments are always considering raising one tax or lowering an-
other. Here we consider what happens to the deadweight loss and tax revenue 
when the size of a tax changes.
Figure 6 shows the effects of a small, medium, and large tax, holding constant the 
market’s supply and demand curves. The deadweight loss—the reduction in total 
surplus that results when the tax reduces the size of a market below the ­optimum—
equals the area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves. For the small 
tax in panel (a), the area of the deadweight loss triangle is quite small. But as the 
size of a tax rises in panels (b) and (c), the deadweight loss grows larger and larger.
Indeed, the deadweight loss of a tax rises even more rapidly than the size of 
the tax. This occurs because the deadweight loss is the area of a triangle, and the 
area of a triangle depends on the square of its size. If we double the size of a tax, 
for instance, the base and height of the triangle double, so the deadweight loss 
rises by a factor of 4. If we triple the size of a tax, the base and height triple, so the 
deadweight loss rises by a factor of 9.
The government’s tax revenue is the size of the tax times the amount of the 
good sold. As the first three panels of Figure 6 show, tax revenue equals the area 
of the rectangle between the supply and demand curves. For the small tax in 
panel (a), tax revenue is small. As the size of a tax increases from panel (a) to 
panel (b), tax revenue grows. But as the size of the tax increases further from panel  
(b) to panel (c), tax revenue falls because the higher tax drastically reduces the 
size of the market. For a very large tax, no revenue would be raised because peo-
ple would stop buying and selling the good altogether.
The last two panels of Figure 6 summarize these results. In panel (d), we see 
that as the size of a tax increases, its deadweight loss quickly gets larger. By con-
trast, panel (e) shows that tax revenue first rises with the size of the tax, but as the 
tax increases further, the market shrinks so much that tax revenue starts to fall.

amount of the tax times the amount of the good sold. In panel (a), a small tax has a 
small deadweight loss and raises a small amount of revenue. In panel (b), a somewhat 
larger tax has a larger deadweight loss and raises a larger amount of revenue. In panel

of the market so much, the tax raises only a small amount of revenue. Panels (d) and (e)

The Laffer Curve and Supply-Side Economics
One day in 1974, economist Arthur Laffer sat in a Washington res-
taurant with some prominent journalists and politicians. He took out a 
napkin and drew a figure on it to show how tax rates affect tax revenue. 
It looked much like panel (e) of our Figure 6. Laffer then suggested that the 
United States was on the downward-sloping side of this curve. Tax rates were so 
high, he argued, that reducing them would actually increase tax revenue.

Most economists were skeptical of Laffer’s suggestion. The idea that a cut in 
tax rates could increase tax revenue was correct as a matter of economic theory, 
but there was more doubt about whether it would do so in practice. There was 
little evidence for Laffer’s view that U.S. tax rates had in fact reached such ex-
treme levels.
Nonetheless, the Laffer curve (as it became known) captured the imagination of 
Ronald Reagan. David Stockman, budget director in the first Reagan administra-
tion, offers the following story:
[Reagan] had once been on the Laffer curve himself. “I came into the Big Money 
making pictures during World War II,” he would always say. At that time the 
wartime income surtax hit 90 percent. “You could only make four pictures and 
then you were in the top bracket,” he would continue. “So we all quit work-
ing after four pictures and went off to the country.” High tax rates caused less 
work. Low tax rates caused more. His experience proved it.
When Reagan ran for president in 1980, he made cutting taxes part of his plat-
form. Reagan argued that taxes were so high that they were discouraging hard 
work. He argued that lower taxes would give people the proper incentive to work, 
which would raise economic well-being and perhaps even tax revenue. Because 
the cut in tax rates was intended to encourage people to increase the quantity of 
labor they supplied, the views of Laffer and Reagan became known as supply-side 
economics.
Economists continue to debate Laffer’s argument. Many believe that subse-
quent history refuted Laffer’s conjecture that lower tax rates would raise tax rev-
enue. Yet because history is open to alternative interpretations, other economists 
view the events of the 1980s as more favorable to the supply siders. To evalu-
ate Laffer’s hypothesis definitively, we would need to rerun history without the 
Reagan tax cuts and see if tax revenues were higher or lower. Unfortunately, that 
experiment is impossible.
Some economists take an intermediate position on this issue. They believe that 
while an overall cut in tax rates normally reduces revenue, some taxpayers may 
occasionally find themselves on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. Other things 
being equal, a tax cut is more likely to raise tax revenue if the cut applies to those 
taxpayers facing the highest tax rates. In addition, Laffer’s argument may be 
more compelling when considering countries with much higher tax rates than the 
United States. In Sweden in the early 1980s, for instance, the typical worker faced 
a marginal tax rate of about 80 percent. Such a high tax rate provides a substan-
tial disincentive to work. Studies have suggested that Sweden would indeed have 
raised more tax revenue if it had lowered its tax rates.
Economists disagree about these issues in part because there is no consensus 
about the size of the relevant elasticities. The more elastic supply and demand are 
in any market, the more taxes distort behavior, and the more likely it is that a tax 
cut will increase tax revenue. There is no debate, however, about the general les-
son: How much revenue the government gains or loses from a tax change cannot 
be computed just by looking at tax rates. It also depends on how the tax change 
affects people’s behavior.

High Tax Rates Won’t 
Slow Growth
By Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez
T
he share of pre-tax income accruing to the 
top 1% of earners in the U.S. has more 
than doubled to about 20% in 2010 from less 
than 10% in the 1970s. At the same time, the 
average federal income tax rate on top earn-
ers has declined significantly. Given the large 
current and projected deficits, should the top 
1% be taxed more? Because U.S. income con-
centration is now so high, the potential tax 
revenue at stake is large.
But will taxable incomes of the top 1% re-
spond to a tax increase by declining so much 
that revenue rises very little or even drops? In 
other words, are we already near or beyond 
the peak of the famous Laffer Curve, the 
­revenue-maximizing tax rate?
The Laffer Curve is used to illustrate the 
concept of taxable income “elasticity,”—i.e., 
that taxable income will change in response 
to a change in the rate of taxation. Top earn-
ers can, of course, move taxable income 
between years to subject them to lower tax 
rates, for example, by changing the timing 
of charitable donations and realized capital 
gains. And some can convert earned income 
into capital gains, and avoid higher taxes in 
other ways. But existing studies do not show 
much change in actual work being done.
According to our analysis of current 
tax rates and their elasticity, the revenue-­
maximizing top federal marginal income tax 
rate would be in or near the range of 50%–
70% (taking into account that individuals face 
additional taxes from Medicare and state and 
local taxes). Thus we conclude that raising the 
top tax rate is very likely to result in revenue 
increases at least until we reach the 50% rate 
that held during the first Reagan administra-
tion, and possibly until the 70% rate of the 
1970s. To reduce tax avoidance opportuni-
ties, tax rates on capital gains and dividends 
should increase along with the basic rate. 
Closing loopholes and stepping up enforce-
ment would further limit tax avoidance and 
evasion.
But will raising top tax rates significantly 
lower economic growth? In the postwar U.S., 
higher top tax rates tend to go with higher eco-
nomic growth—not lower. Indeed, according 
to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau 
of Economic Analysis, GDP annual growth per 
capita (to adjust for population growth) aver-
aged 1.68% between 1980 and 2010 when top 
tax rates were relatively low, while growth av-
eraged 2.23% between 1950 and 1980 when 
top tax rates were at or above 70%.
Neither does international evidence sup-
port a case for lower growth from higher top 
taxes. There is no clear correlation between 
economic growth since the 1970s and top tax-
rate cuts across Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development countries.
For example, from 1970 to 2010, real GDP 
annual growth per capita averaged 1.8% and 
2.03% in the U.S. and the U.K., both of which 
dramatically lowered their top tax rates dur-
ing that period, while it averaged 1.72% and 
1.89% in France and Germany, which kept 
high top tax rates during the period. While 
in no way does this prove that higher top tax 
rates actually encourage growth, there is not 
good evidence from the aggregate data sup-
porting the view that higher rates slow growth.
One cannot evaluate the ultimate growth 
effects of raising more revenue without iden-
tifying what is done with the revenue. If part 
of the revenue is used to reduce the federal 
debt, more of savings go into capital invest-
ment, enhancing growth. The fact that those 
paying higher taxes will reduce their savings 
somewhat does not fully offset this effect as 
some of their higher taxes would come out of 
consumption.
If some of the additional revenue is used 
for public investments with a high return, 
such as education, infrastructure and re-
search, it raises growth further. The neglect of 
public investment over the last few decades 
suggests that the returns could be quite high.
Large losses in efficiency come when 
people are limited in their ability to finance 
good investment opportunities. Surveys 
show difficulty of borrowing as an issue for 
start-ups. And higher education is influ-
enced by the ­finances of parents, and the 
earnings premium for higher education is 
very high. ­Access to investment financing 
is a much bigger issue for low earners than 
for high earners. By the time Bill Gates got 
rich, ­Microsoft was not likely to have trouble 
financing investments. Hence, increasing 
tax rates on the already rich might not hurt 
growth as much as increasing tax rates on 
the soon-to-be rich.
By itself, a suitable increase in the taxa-
tion of top earners will not solve our unsus-
tainable long-term fiscal trajectory. But that 
is no reason not to use this tool to contribute 
to addressing this problem.

The Tax Debate
In 2012, during and after President Obama’s reelection campaign, a prominent policy debate centered 
on whether to increase taxes, particularly on higher-income taxpayers. In these two opinion pieces, 
prominent economists present both sides of the issue.

CHAPTER 8  APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION
167
Taxes Are Much Higher 
Than You Think
By Edward C. Prescott and Lee E. 
Ohanian
P
resident Obama argues that the election 
gave him a mandate to raise taxes on high 
earners, and the White House indicates that 
he won’t compromise on this issue as the so-
called fiscal cliff approaches.
But tax rates are already high—much 
higher than is commonly understood—and 
increasing them will likely further depress the 
economy, especially by affecting the number 
of hours Americans work.
Taking into account all taxes on earnings 
and consumer spending—including federal, 
state and local income taxes, Social Security 
and Medicare payroll taxes, excise taxes, and 
state and local sales taxes—Edward Prescott 
has shown (especially in the Quarterly Review of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 2004) 
that the U.S. average marginal effective tax rate 
is around 40%. This means that if the average 
worker earns $100 from additional output, he 
will be able to consume only an additional $60.
Research by others (including Lee Oha-
nian, Andrea Raffo and Richard Rogerson in 
the Journal of Monetary Economics, 2008, and 
Edward Prescott in the American Economic 
Review, 2002) indicates that raising tax rates 
further will significantly reduce U.S. economic 
activity and by implication will increase tax 
revenues only a little.
High tax rates—on both labor income and 
consumption—reduce the incentive to work by 
making consumption more expensive relative 
to leisure, for example. The incentive to produce 
goods for the market is particularly depressed 
when tax revenue is returned to households 
either as government transfers or transfers-
in-kind—such as public schooling, police and 
fire protection, food stamps, and health care—
that substitute for private consumption.
In the 1950s, when European tax rates 
were low, many Western Europeans, including 
the French and the Germans, worked more 
hours per capita than did Americans. Over 
time, tax rates that affect earnings and 
consumption rose substantially in much of 
Western Europe. Over the decades, these 
have accounted for much of the nearly 30% 
decline in work hours in several European 
­countries—to 1,000 hours per adult per year 
today from around 1,400 in the 1950s.
Changes in tax rates are also important 
in accounting for the increase in the number 
of hours worked in the Netherlands in the late 
1980s, following the enactment of lower mar-
ginal income-tax rates.
In Japan, the tax rate on earnings and 
consumption is about the same as it is in 
the U.S., and the average Japanese worker 
in 2007 (the last nonrecession year) worked 
1,363 hours—or about the same as the 1,336 
worked by the average American.
All this has major implications for the 
U.S. Consider California, which just enacted 
higher rates of income and sales tax. The top 
California income-tax rate will be 13.3%, and 
the top sales-tax rate in some areas may rise 
as high as 10%. Combine these state taxes 
with a top combined federal rate of 44%, plus 
federal excise taxes, and the combined mar-
ginal tax rate for the highest California earn-
ers is likely to be around 60%—as high as in 
France, Germany and Italy.
Higher labor-income and consumption 
taxes also have consequences for entrepre-
neurship and risk-taking. A key factor driving 
U.S. economic growth has been the remark-
able impact of entrepreneurs such as Bill 
Gates of Microsoft, Steve Jobs of Apple, Fred 
Smith of FedEx and others who took substan-
tial risk to implement new ideas, directly and 
indirectly creating new economic sectors and 
millions of new jobs.
Entrepreneurship is much lower in 
­Europe, suggesting that high tax rates and 
poorly designed regulation discourage new 
business creation. The Economist reports 
that between 1976 and 2007 only one conti-
nental ­European startup, Norway’s Renewable 
Energy Corporation, achieved a level of 
­success ­comparable to that of ­Microsoft, 
Apple and other U.S. giants making the 
­Financial Times Index of the world’s 500 larg-
est companies. …
The economy now faces two serious risks: 
the risk of higher marginal tax rates that will 
depress the number of hours of work, and 
the risk of continuing policies such as Dodd-
Frank, bailouts, and subsidies to specific 
industries and technologies that depress pro-
ductivity growth by protecting inefficient pro-
ducers and restricting the flow of resources to 
the most productive users.
If these two risks are realized, the U.S. 
will face a much more serious problem 
than a 2013 recession. It will face a perma-
nent and growing decline in relative living 
standards….
Economic growth requires new ideas and 
new businesses, which in turn require a large 
group of talented young workers who are will-
ing to take on the considerable risk of starting 
a business. This requires undoing the impedi-
ments that stand in the way of creating new 
economic activity—and increasing the after-
tax returns to succeeding.

Markets and Welfare
8-4 Conclusion
In this chapter we have used the tools developed in the previous chapter to fur-
ther our understanding of taxes. One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in 
Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. In 
Chapter 7, we used the concepts of producer and consumer surplus to make this 
principle more precise. Here we have seen that when the government imposes 
taxes on buyers or sellers of a good, society loses some of the benefits of market 
efficiency. Taxes are costly to market participants not only because taxes transfer 
resources from those participants to the government but also because they alter 
incentives and distort market outcomes.
The analysis presented here and in Chapter 6 should give you a good basis for 
understanding the economic impact of taxes, but this is not the end of the story. 
Microeconomists study how best to design a tax system, including how to strike 
the right balance between equality and efficiency. Macroeconomists study how 
taxes influence the overall economy and how policymakers can use the tax system 
to stabilize economic activity and to achieve more rapid economic growth. So as 
you continue your study of economics, don’t be surprised when the subject of 
taxation comes up yet again.
•	
A tax on a good reduces the welfare of buyers and sell-
ers of the good, and the reduction in consumer and 
producer surplus usually exceeds the revenue raised 
by the government. The fall in total surplus—the 
sum of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and tax 
­revenue—is called the deadweight loss of the tax.
•	
Taxes have deadweight losses because they cause buy-
ers to consume less and sellers to produce less, and 
these changes in behavior shrink the size of the market 
below the level that maximizes total surplus. Because 
the elasticities of supply and demand measure how 
much market participants respond to market condi-
tions, larger elasticities imply larger deadweight losses.
•	
As a tax grows larger, it distorts incentives more, and 
its deadweight loss grows larger. Because a tax reduces 
the size of the market, however, tax revenue does not 
continually increase. It first rises with the size of a 
tax, but if the tax gets large enough, tax revenue starts 
to fall.

  4.	 Suppose that the government imposes a tax on 
­heating oil.
a.	 Would the deadweight loss from this tax likely be 
greater in the first year after it is imposed or in the 
fifth year? Explain.
b.	 Would the revenue collected from this tax likely be

  5.	 After economics class one day, your friend suggests 
that taxing food would be a good way to raise revenue 
because the demand for food is quite inelastic. In what 
sense is taxing food a “good” way to raise revenue? In 
what sense is it not a “good” way to raise revenue?
  6.	 Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the late senator from 
New York, once introduced a bill that would levy a

a.	 Do you expect that this tax would raise much 
­revenue? Why or why not?
b.	 Even if the tax would raise no revenue, why might 
Senator Moynihan have proposed it?
  7.	 The government places a tax on the purchase of socks.
a.	 Illustrate the effect of this tax on equilibrium price 
and quantity in the socks market. Identify the fol-
lowing areas both before and after the imposition 
of the tax: total spending by consumers, total rev-
enue for producers, and government tax revenue.
b.	 Does the price received by producers rise or fall? 
Can you tell whether total receipts for producers 
rise or fall? Explain.
c.	 Does the price paid by consumers rise or fall? Can 
you tell whether total spending by consumers 
rises or falls? Explain carefully. (Hint: Think about 
elasticity.) If total consumer spending falls, does 
consumer surplus rise? Explain.
  8.	 This chapter analyzed the welfare effects of a tax on a 
good. Consider now the opposite policy. Suppose that 
the government subsidizes a good: For each unit of the 
good sold, the government pays $2 to the buyer. How 
does the subsidy affect consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, tax revenue, and total surplus? Does a sub-
sidy lead to a deadweight loss? Explain.
  9.	 Hotel rooms in Smalltown go for $100, and 
1,000 rooms are rented on a typical day.
a.	 To raise revenue, the mayor decides to charge 
hotels a tax of $10 per rented room. After the tax 
is imposed, the going rate for hotel rooms rises to 
$108, and the number of rooms rented falls to 900. 
Calculate the amount of revenue this tax raises 
for Smalltown and the deadweight loss of the tax. 
(Hint: The area of a triangle is ½ × base × height.)
b.	 The mayor now doubles the tax to $20. The price 
rises to $116, and the number of rooms rented falls 
to 800. Calculate tax revenue and deadweight loss 
with this larger tax. Are they double, more than 
double, or less than double? Explain.
10.	 Suppose that a market is described by the following 
supply and demand equations:
 QS 5 2P
QD 5 300 2 P
a.	 Solve for the equilibrium price and the equilibrium 
quantity.
b.	 Suppose that a tax of T is placed on buyers, so the 
new demand equation is
QD 5 300 2 (P 1 T)
Solve for the new equilibrium. What happens to 
the price received by sellers, the price paid by buy-
ers, and the quantity sold?
c.	 Tax revenue is T × Q. Use your answer to part (b) 
to solve for tax revenue as a function of T. Graph 
this relationship for T between 0 and 300.
d.	 The deadweight loss of a tax is the area of the 
triangle between the supply and demand curves. 
Recalling that the area of a triangle is ½ × base × 
height, solve for deadweight loss as a function 
of T. Graph this relationship for T between 0 and 
300. (Hint: Looking sideways, the base of the dead-
weight loss triangle is T, and the height is the dif-
ference between the quantity sold with the tax and 
the quantity sold without the tax.)
e.	 The government now levies a tax on this good of 
$200 per unit. Is this a good policy? Why or why 
not? Can you propose a better policy?

Trade
I
f you check the labels on the clothes you are wearing, you will probably find 
that some were made in another country. A century ago, the textile and clothing 
industry was a major part of the U.S. economy, but that is no longer the case. 
Faced with foreign competitors that can produce quality goods at low cost, many 
U.S. firms have found it increasingly difficult to produce and sell textiles and 
clothing at a profit. As a result, they have laid off their workers and shut down 
their factories. Today, most of the textiles and clothing that Americans consume 
are imported.
The story of the textile industry raises important questions for economic 
policy: How does international trade affect economic well-being? Who gains 
and who loses from free trade among countries, and how do the gains com-
pare to the losses? 
Chapter 3 introduced the study of international trade by applying the prin-
ciple of comparative advantage. According to this principle, all countries

can benefit from trading with one another because trade allows each country to 
specialize in doing what it does best. But the analysis in Chapter 3 was incom-
plete. It did not explain how the international marketplace achieves these gains 
from trade or how the gains are distributed among various economic participants.
We now return to the study of international trade and take up these questions. 
Over the past several chapters, we have developed many tools for analyzing 
how markets work: supply, demand, equilibrium, consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, and so on. With these tools, we can learn more about how international 
trade affects economic well-being.
9-1 The Determinants of Trade
Consider the market for textiles. The textile market is well suited to studying the 
gains and losses from international trade: Textiles are made in many countries 
around the world, and there is much world trade in textiles. Moreover, the textile 
market is one in which policymakers often consider (and sometimes implement) 
trade restrictions to protect domestic producers from foreign competitors. We ex-
amine here the textile market in the imaginary country of Isoland. 
9-1a The Equilibrium without Trade
As our story begins, the Isolandian textile market is isolated from the rest of the 
world. By government decree, no one in Isoland is allowed to import or export 
textiles, and the penalty for violating the decree is so large that no one dares try.
Because there is no international trade, the market for textiles in Isoland con-
sists solely of Isolandian buyers and sellers. As Figure 1 shows, the domestic 
price adjusts to balance the quantity supplied by domestic sellers and the quan-
tity demanded by domestic buyers. The figure shows the consumer and producer 
surplus in the equilibrium without trade. The sum of consumer and producer sur-
plus measures the total benefits that buyers and sellers receive from participating 
in the textile market.
FIGURE 1
The Equilibrium without 
­International Trade
When an economy cannot trade 
in world markets, the price 
adjusts to balance domestic 
supply and demand. This figure 
shows consumer and producer 
surplus in an equilibrium

CHAPTER 9  APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
173
Now suppose that, in a political upset, Isoland elects a new president. The 
president campaigned on a platform of “change” and promised the voters bold 
new ideas. Her first act is to assemble a team of economists to evaluate Isolandian 
trade policy. She asks them to report on three questions:
•	 If the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, what will 
happen to the price of textiles and the quantity of textiles sold in the domestic 
textile market? 
•	 Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will the gains 
exceed the losses?
•	 Should a tariff (a tax on textile imports) be part of the new trade policy?
After reviewing supply and demand in their favorite textbook (this one, of 
course), the Isolandian economics team begins its analysis. 
9-1b The World Price and Comparative 
Advantage
The first issue our economists take up is whether Isoland is likely to become a 
textile importer or a textile exporter. In other words, if free trade is allowed, will 
Isolandians end up buying or selling textiles in world markets?
To answer this question, the economists compare the current Isolandian price 
of textiles to the price of textiles in other countries. We call the price prevailing 
in world markets the world price. If the world price of textiles is higher than the 
domestic price, then Isoland will export textiles once trade is permitted. Isolan-
dian textile producers will be eager to receive the higher prices available abroad 
and will start selling their textiles to buyers in other countries. Conversely, if the 
world price of textiles is lower than the domestic price, then Isoland will import 
textiles. Because foreign sellers offer a better price, Isolandian textile consumers 
will quickly start buying textiles from other countries.
In essence, comparing the world price and the domestic price before trade in-
dicates whether Isoland has a comparative advantage in producing textiles. The 
domestic price reflects the opportunity cost of textiles: It tells us how much an Iso-
landian must give up to obtain one unit of textiles. If the domestic price is low, the 
cost of producing textiles in Isoland is low, suggesting that Isoland has a compara-
tive advantage in producing textiles relative to the rest of the world. If the domes-
tic price is high, then the cost of producing textiles in Isoland is high, suggesting 
that foreign countries have a comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
As we saw in Chapter 3, trade among nations is ultimately based on compara-
tive advantage. That is, trade is beneficial because it allows each nation to special-
ize in doing what it does best. By comparing the world price and the domestic 
price before trade, we can determine whether Isoland is better or worse at pro-
ducing textiles than the rest of the world.

Markets and Welfare
9-2 The Winners and Losers from Trade
To analyze the welfare effects of free trade, the Isolandian economists begin with 
the assumption that Isoland is a small economy compared to the rest of the world. 
This small-economy assumption means that Isoland’s actions have little effect on 
world markets. Specifically, any change in Isoland’s trade policy will not affect 
the world price of textiles. The Isolandians are said to be price takers in the world 
economy. That is, they take the world price of textiles as given. Isoland can be an 
exporting country by selling textiles at this price or an importing country by buy-
ing textiles at this price. 
The small-economy assumption is not necessary to analyze the gains and losses 
from international trade. But the Isolandian economists know from experience 
(and from reading Chapter 2 of this book) that making simplifying assumptions is 
a key part of building a useful economic model. The assumption that Isoland is a 
small economy simplifies the analysis, and the basic lessons do not change in the 
more complicated case of a large economy.
9-2a The Gains and Losses of an Exporting Country
Figure 2 shows the Isolandian textile market when the domestic equilibrium price 
before trade is below the world price. Once trade is allowed, the domestic price 
rises to equal the world price. No seller of textiles would accept less than the 
world price, and no buyer would pay more than the world price.

International Trade in an 
­Exporting Country
Once trade is allowed, the 
­domestic price rises to equal the 
world price. The supply curve 
shows the quantity of textiles 
produced domestically, and the 
demand curve shows the quan-
tity consumed ­domestically. 
Exports from Isoland equal the 
difference between the domes-
tic quantity supplied and the 
domestic quantity demanded 
at the world price. Sellers are 
better off (producer surplus 
rises from C to B + C + D), and 
buyers are worse off (consumer 
surplus falls from A + B to A). 
Total surplus rises by an amount

CHAPTER 9  APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
175
After the domestic price has risen to equal the world price, the domestic quan-
tity supplied differs from the domestic quantity demanded. The supply curve 
shows the quantity of textiles supplied by Isolandian sellers. The demand curve 
shows the quantity of textiles demanded by Isolandian buyers. Because the do-
mestic quantity supplied is greater than the domestic quantity demanded, Isoland 
sells textiles to other countries. Thus, Isoland becomes a textile exporter.
Although domestic quantity supplied and domestic quantity demanded differ, 
the textile market is still in equilibrium because there is now another participant 
in the market: the rest of the world. One can view the horizontal line at the world 
price as representing the rest of the world’s demand for textiles. This demand 
curve is perfectly elastic because Isoland, as a small economy, can sell as many 
textiles as it wants at the world price.
Now consider the gains and losses from opening up trade. Clearly, not every-
one benefits. Trade forces the domestic price to rise to the world price. Domestic 
producers of textiles are better off because they can now sell textiles at a higher 
price, but domestic consumers of textiles are worse off because they have to buy 
textiles at a higher price.
To measure these gains and losses, we look at the changes in consumer and 
producer surplus. Before trade is allowed, the price of textiles adjusts to balance 
domestic supply and domestic demand. Consumer surplus, the area between the 
demand curve and the before-trade price, is area A + B. Producer surplus, the 
area between the supply curve and the before-trade price, is area C. Total surplus 
before trade, the sum of consumer and producer surplus, is area A + B + C.
After trade is allowed, the domestic price rises to the world price. Consumer 
surplus is reduced to area A (the area between the demand curve and the world 
price). Producer surplus is increased to area B + C + D (the area between the 
­supply curve and the world price). Thus, total surplus with trade is area A + B + 
C + D.
These welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an ex-
porting country. Sellers benefit because producer surplus increases by the area 
B + D. Buyers are worse off because consumer surplus decreases by the area B. 
Because the gains of sellers exceed the losses of buyers by the area D, total surplus 
in Isoland increases.
This analysis of an exporting country yields two conclusions:
•	 When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter of a good, domestic 
producers of the good are better off, and domestic consumers of the good are 
worse off. 
•	 Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains of 
the winners exceed the losses of the losers.
9-2b The Gains and Losses of an Importing Country
Now suppose that the domestic price before trade is above the world price. Once 
again, after trade is allowed, the domestic price must equal the world price. As 
Figure 3 shows, the domestic quantity supplied is less than the domestic quantity 
demanded. The difference between the domestic quantity demanded and the do-
mestic quantity supplied is bought from other countries, and Isoland becomes a 
textile importer.
In this case, the horizontal line at the world price represents the supply of the 
rest of the world. This supply curve is perfectly elastic because Isoland is a small 
economy and, therefore, can buy as many textiles as it wants at the world price.

Markets and Welfare
Now consider the gains and losses from trade. Once again, not everyone ben-
efits. When trade forces the domestic price to fall, domestic consumers are bet-
ter off (they can now buy textiles at a lower price), and domestic producers are 
worse off (they now have to sell textiles at a lower price). Changes in consumer 
and producer surplus measure the size of the gains and losses. Before trade, con-
sumer surplus is area A, producer surplus is area B + C, and total surplus is area 
A + B + C. After trade is allowed, consumer surplus is area A + B + D, producer 
surplus is area C, and total surplus is area A + B + C + D. 
These welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an im-
porting country. Buyers benefit because consumer surplus increases by the area  
B + D. Sellers are worse off because producer surplus falls by the area B. The gains 
of buyers exceed the losses of sellers, and total surplus increases by the area D.
This analysis of an importing country yields two conclusions parallel to those 
for an exporting country:
•	 When a country allows trade and becomes an importer of a good, domestic 
consumers of the good are better off, and domestic producers of the good are 
worse off. 
•	 Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains of 
the winners exceed the losses of the losers.

International Trade in an Importing 
Country
Once trade is allowed, the domestic 
price falls to equal the world price. 
The supply curve shows the amount 
produced domestically, and the de-
mand curve shows the amount con-
sumed domestically. Imports equal 
the difference between the domestic 
quantity demanded and the domestic 
quantity supplied at the world price. 
Buyers are better off (consumer 
surplus rises from A to A + B + D), 
and sellers are worse off (producer 
surplus falls from B + C to C). Total 
surplus rises by an amount equal to 
area D, indicating that trade raises 
the economic well-being of the coun-
try as a whole.

CHAPTER 9  APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
177
Having completed our analysis of trade, we can better understand one of 
the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: Trade can make everyone better off. 
If Isoland opens its textile market to international trade, the change creates  
winners and losers, regardless of whether Isoland ends up exporting or importing 
textiles. In ­either case, however, the gains of the winners exceed the losses of the 
losers, so the winners could compensate the losers and still be better off. In this 
sense, trade can make everyone better off. But will trade make everyone better off? 
Probably not. In practice, compensation for the losers from international trade is 
rare. ­Without such compensation, opening an economy to international trade is a  
policy that expands the size of the economic pie, while perhaps leaving some  
participants in the economy with a smaller slice.
We can now see why the debate over trade policy is often contentious. ­Whenever 
a policy creates winners and losers, the stage is set for a political battle. ­Nations 
sometimes fail to enjoy the gains from trade because the losers from free trade are 
better organized than the winners. The losers may turn their cohesiveness into po-
litical clout and lobby for trade restrictions such as tariffs or import quotas.
9-2c The Effects of a Tariff
The Isolandian economists next consider the effects of a tariff —a tax on imported 
goods. The economists quickly realize that a tariff on textiles will have no effect 
if Isoland becomes a textile exporter. If no one in Isoland is interested in import-
ing textiles, a tax on textile imports is irrelevant. The tariff matters only if Isoland 
becomes a textile importer. Concentrating their attention on this case, the econo-
mists compare welfare with and without the tariff.
Figure 4 shows the Isolandian market for textiles. Under free trade, the do-
mestic price equals the world price. A tariff raises the price of imported textiles 
above the world price by the amount of the tariff. Domestic suppliers of textiles, 
who compete with suppliers of imported textiles, can now sell their textiles for 
the world price plus the amount of the tariff. Thus, the price of textiles—both im-
ported and domestic—rises by the amount of the tariff and is, therefore, closer to 
the price that would prevail without trade.
The change in price affects the behavior of domestic buyers and sellers. ­Because 
the tariff raises the price of textiles, it reduces the domestic quantity demanded 
from Q1
D to Q2
D and raises the domestic quantity supplied from Q1
S to Q2
S. Thus, the 
tariff reduces the quantity of imports and moves the domestic market closer to its equilib-
rium without trade. 
Now consider the gains and losses from the tariff. Because the tariff raises the 
domestic price, domestic sellers are better off, and domestic buyers are worse off. 
In addition, the government raises revenue. To measure these gains and losses, 
we look at the changes in consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government 
revenue. These changes are summarized in the table in Figure 4. 
Before the tariff, the domestic price equals the world price. Consumer surplus, the 
area between the demand curve and the world price, is area A + B + C + D + E + F. 
Producer surplus, the area between the supply curve and the world price, is area G. 
Government revenue equals zero. Total surplus, the sum of consumer surplus, pro-
ducer surplus, and government revenue, is area A + B + C + D + E + F + G.
Once the government imposes a tariff, the domestic price exceeds the world 
price by the amount of the tariff. Consumer surplus is now area A + B. Producer 
surplus is area C + G. Government revenue, which is the quantity of after-tariff 
imports times the size of the tariff, is the area E. Thus, total surplus with the tariff 
is area A + B + C + E + G.

Markets and Welfare
To determine the total welfare effects of the tariff, we add the change in con-
sumer surplus (which is negative), the change in producer surplus (positive), and 
the change in government revenue (positive). We find that total surplus in the 
market decreases by the area D + F. This fall in total surplus is called the dead-
weight loss of the tariff.
A tariff causes a deadweight loss because a tariff is a type of tax. Like most 
taxes, it distorts incentives and pushes the allocation of scarce resources away 
from the optimum. In this case, we can identify two effects. First, when the 
tariff raises the domestic price of textiles above the world price, it encourages 
domestic producers to increase production from Q1
S to Q2
S. Even though the 
FIGURE 4
A tariff reduces the quantity of imports and moves a market closer to the equilibrium 
that would exist without trade. Total surplus falls by an amount equal to area D + F. 
These two triangles represent the deadweight loss from the tariff.

cost of making these incremental units exceeds the cost of buying them at the 
world price, the tariff makes it profitable for domestic producers to manufac-
ture them nonetheless. Second, when the tariff raises the price that domestic 
textile consumers have to pay, it encourages them to reduce consumption of 
textiles from Q1
D to Q2
D. Even though domestic consumers value these incremen-
tal units at more than the world price, the tariff induces them to cut back their 
purchases. Area D represents the deadweight loss from the overproduction of 
textiles, and area F represents the deadweight loss from the underconsump-
tion of textiles. The total deadweight loss of the tariff is the sum of these two  
triangles.
9-2d The Lessons for Trade Policy
The team of Isolandian economists can now write to the new president:
Dear Madam President,
You asked us three questions about opening up trade. After much hard work, 
we have the answers.
Question: If the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, 
what will happen to the price of textiles and the quantity of textiles sold in the 
domestic textile market? 
Answer: Once trade is allowed, the Isolandian price of textiles will be driven to 
equal the price prevailing around the world. 
Import Quotas: Another  
Way to Restrict Trade
B
eyond tariffs, another way that nations sometimes restrict inter-
national trade is by putting limits on how much of a good can be 
­imported. In this book, we will not analyze such a policy, other than to 
point out the conclusion: Import quotas are much like tariffs. Both tar-
iffs and import quotas reduce the quantity of imports, raise the ­domestic 
price of the good, decrease the welfare of domestic consumers, increase 
the welfare of domestic producers, and cause deadweight losses. 
There is only one difference between these two types of trade 
­restriction: A tariff raises revenue for the government, whereas an im-
port quota creates surplus for those who obtain the licenses to import. 
The profit for the holder of an import license is the difference between 
the domestic price (at which she sells the imported good) and the world 
price (at which she buys it).
Tariffs and import quotas are even more similar if the government 
charges a fee for the import licenses. Suppose the government sets 
the license fee equal to the difference between the domestic price and 
the world price. In this case, all the profit of license holders is paid to 
the government in license 
fees, and the import quota 
works exactly like a tariff. 
Consumer surplus, producer sur-
plus, and government revenue are precisely the 
same under the two policies.
In practice, however, countries that restrict trade with import quo-
tas rarely do so by selling the import licenses. For example, the U.S. 
government has at times pressured Japan to “voluntarily” limit the 
sale of Japanese cars in the United States. In this case, the ­Japanese 
government allocates the import licenses to Japanese firms, and 
the surplus from these licenses accrues to those firms. From the stand-
point of U.S. welfare, this kind of import quota is worse than a U.S. 
tariff on imported cars. Both a tariff and an import quota raise prices, 
restrict trade, and cause deadweight losses, but at least the tariff pro-
duces revenue for the U.S. government rather than profit for foreign 
producers.

Markets and Welfare
If the world price is now higher than the Isolandian price, our price will rise. 
The higher price will reduce the amount of textiles Isolandians consume and 
raise the amount of textiles that Isolandians produce. Isoland will, therefore, 
become a textile exporter. This occurs because, in this case, Isoland has a com-
parative advantage in producing textiles. 
Conversely, if the world price is now lower than the Isolandian price, our 
price will fall. The lower price will raise the amount of textiles that Isolandians 
consume and lower the amount of textiles that Isolandians produce. ­Isoland 
will, therefore, become a textile importer. This occurs because, in this case, 
other countries have a comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
Question: Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will 
the gains exceed the losses?
Answer: The answer depends on whether the price rises or falls when trade 
is allowed. If the price rises, producers of textiles gain, and consumers of tex-
tiles lose. If the price falls, consumers gain, and producers lose. In both cases, 
the gains are larger than the losses. Thus, free trade raises the total welfare of 
Isolandians.
Question: Should a tariff be part of the new trade policy?
Answer: A tariff has an impact only if Isoland becomes a textile importer. In 
this case, a tariff moves the economy closer to the no-trade equilibrium and, 
like most taxes, has deadweight losses. A tariff improves the welfare of do-
mestic producers and raises revenue for the government, but these gains are 
more than offset by the losses suffered by consumers. The best policy, from the 
standpoint of economic efficiency, would be to allow trade without a tariff.
We hope you find these answers helpful as you decide on your new policy. 
Your faithful servants,
Isolandian economics team
9-2e Other Benefits of International Trade
The conclusions of the Isolandian economics team are based on the standard 
analysis of international trade. Their analysis uses the most fundamental tools in 
the economist’s toolbox: supply, demand, and producer and consumer surplus. 
It shows that there are winners and losers when a nation opens itself up to trade, 
but the gains to the winners exceed the losses of the losers. 
The case for free trade can be made even stronger, however, because there are 
several other economic benefits of trade beyond those emphasized in the stan-
dard analysis. Here, in a nutshell, are some of these other benefits:
•	 Increased variety of goods. Goods produced in different countries are not 
exactly the same. German beer, for instance, is not the same as American beer. 
Free trade gives consumers in all countries greater variety from which to 
choose.
•	 Lower costs through economies of scale. Some goods can be produced at low 
cost only if they are produced in large quantities—a phenomenon called econo-
mies of scale. A firm in a small country cannot take full advantage of economies of 
scale if it can sell only in a small domestic market. Free trade gives firms access 
to larger world markets and allows them to realize economies of scale more fully.

The Return of the 
­Protectionist Illusion
By Douglas A. Irwin
W
hen the Great Depression struck in the 
early 1930s, countries imposed high 
tariffs, import quotas and foreign-exchange 
controls in the false hope that they might 
help revive their economies. Instead, these 
beggar-thy-neighbor policies led to a collapse 
in world trade. Today the threat of protection-
ism once again looms across the world. 
In order to prop up the peso, Argentina is 
rationing foreign exchange to sharply limit 
spending on imports, prompting foreign retal-
iation. Brazil has been cracking down on au-
tomobile imports from Argentina and Mexico. 
A steady stream of new antidumping duties 
creates additional obstacles to trade.
Export restrictions have also interrupted 
trade flows: Indonesia and nickel ore, China and 
rare-earth minerals, Tanzania and maize. And 
subtle product regulations are increasingly in-
voked to block imports. Russia ­recently banned 
imports of live animals from the ­European 
Union, ostensibly for health and safety reasons, 
prompting vigorous objections from Brussels. 
In addition to these overt measures, there 
are worrisome proposals on the horizon. The 
EU is considering a “Buy European” initiative 
for public procurement that would mimic, and 
perhaps go well beyond, “Buy American” provi-
sions in U.S. law. These laws give preferences 
for domestic suppliers in government contracts, 
limiting trade and raising prices that taxpayers 
pay for government services. India is consider-
ing mandating preferences for purchases of 
information and ­communications-technology 
equipment, not just for government entities but 
for private firms, as well.
Pascal Lamy, director general of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), says these and other 
measures restricting or potentially restricting 
trade are “now a matter of serious concern.” 
EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht is also 
worried by what he characterizes as “the sharp 
rise in trade-restrictive measures introduced 
over the last eight months.”
G-20 leaders at the recent summit in Los 
Cabos, Mexico, claimed they too were “deeply 
concerned about rising instances of protection-
ism around the world,” and reaffirmed their 
“standstill commitment” to avoid imposing new 
trade restrictions. They pledged to “roll back any 
new protectionist measure that may have arisen, 
including new export restrictions and WTO-in-
consistent measures to stimulate exports.” 
Talk is cheap. Global Trade Alert, a moni-
toring service run by Simon Evenett at the 
University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, points 
out that the G-20 countries themselves have 
been most responsible for the protectionist 
creep. Many trade measures enacted by G-20 
members exploit loopholes in WTO rules. 
Unfortunately, President Obama has pro-
vided no leadership in trying to keep world 
markets open for trade. Out of fear of offend-
ing labor unions and other domestic con-
stituencies, his administration long delayed 
submitting free trade agreements with Ko-
rea, Colombia and Panama for congressional 
approval. Instead of seeking to reinvigorate the 
languishing Doha round of trade negotiations 
at the WTO, it has been almost completely pas-
sive and allowed world-trade policies to drift. 
Congress has also done little to help. 
Senate Republicans and Democrats teamed 
up late last month to maintain import re-
strictions for the sugar industry, defeating 
an amendment from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen  
(D., N.H.) that would have gradually elimi-
nated them. Keeping domestic sugar prices at 
twice the world level helps a few sugar-cane 
and beet farmers at the expense of consum-
ers and taxpayers, while leading to job losses 
in sugar-using industries, such as candy and 
confectionary manufacturing…. 
Any serious march backward toward pro-
tectionism would constitute a major failure of 
economic policy. Experience has shown that, 
once imposed, trade restrictions are very dif-
ficult to remove because vested interests then 
have a stake in perpetuating them. Protec-
tionism also breeds foreign retaliation, mak-
ing barriers doubly difficult to unwind. Now is 
no time to entertain dangerous illusions.

Threats to Free Trade
In the News
In 2012, as the United States and many other nations around the 
world were slowly recovering from a deep recession, trade restrictions 
proved an irresistible temptation to many policymakers.
•	 Increased competition. A company shielded from foreign competitors is more 
likely to have market power, which in turn gives it the ability to raise prices 
above competitive levels. This is a type of market failure. Opening up trade 
fosters competition and gives the invisible hand a better chance to work its 
magic.

Markets and Welfare
•	 Enhanced flow of ideas. The transfer of technological advances around the 
world is often thought to be linked to the trading of the goods that embody 
those advances. The best way for a poor agricultural nation to learn about 
the computer revolution, for instance, is to buy some computers from abroad 
rather than trying to make them domestically. 
Thus, free international trade increases variety for consumers, allows firms to take 
advantage of economies of scale, makes markets more competitive, and facilitates 
the spread of technology. If the Isolandian economists also took these effects into 
account, their advice to their president would be even more forceful.
Quick Quiz  Draw a supply-and-demand diagram for wool suits in the country of Au-
tarka. When trade is allowed, the price of a suit falls from 3 to 2 ounces of gold. In your 
diagram, show the change in consumer surplus, the change in producer surplus, and the 
change in total surplus. How would a tariff on suit imports alter these effects?
9-3 The Arguments for Restricting Trade
The letter from the economics team starts to persuade the new president of Iso-
land to consider allowing trade in textiles. She notes that the domestic price is 
now high compared to the world price. Free trade would, therefore, cause the 
price of textiles to fall and hurt domestic textile producers. Before implementing 
the new policy, she asks Isolandian textile companies to comment on the econo-
mists’ advice.
Not surprisingly, the textile companies oppose free trade in textiles. They be-
lieve that the government should protect the domestic textile industry from 
foreign competition. Let’s consider some of the arguments they might give to sup-
port their position and how the economics team would respond.
“You like protectionism as a ‘working man.’ How 
about as a consumer?”

CHAPTER 9  APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE

What to Expect When 
You’re Free Trading
By Steven E. Landsburg
A
ll economists know that when American 
jobs are outsourced, Americans as a group 
are net winners. What we lose through lower 
wages is more than offset by what we gain 
through lower prices. In other words, the win-
ners can more than afford to compensate 
the losers. Does that mean they ought to? 
Does it create a moral mandate for taxpayer-­
subsidized retraining programs?…
Um, no. Even if you’ve just lost your job, 
there’s something fundamentally churlish 
about blaming the very phenomenon that’s 
­elevated you above the subsistence level 
since the day you were born. If the world owes 
you compensation for enduring the downside 
of trade, what do you owe the world for enjoy-
ing the upside?
I doubt there’s a human being on earth who 
hasn’t benefited from the opportunity to trade 
freely with his neighbors. Imagine what your 
life would be like if you had to grow your own 
food, make your own clothes and rely on your 
grandmother’s home remedies for health care. 
Access to a trained physician might reduce the 
demand for grandma’s home remedies, but—
especially at her age—she’s still got plenty of 
reason to be thankful for having a doctor. 
Some people suggest, however, that it makes 
sense to isolate the moral effects of a single new 
trading opportunity or free trade agreement. 
Surely we have fellow citizens who are hurt by 
those agreements, at least in the limited sense 
that they’d be better off in a world where trade 
flourishes, except in this one instance. What do 
we owe those fellow citizens?
One way to think about that is to ask what 
your moral instincts tell you in analogous sit-
uations. Suppose, after years of buying sham-
poo at your local pharmacy, you discover you 
can order the same shampoo for less money 
on the Web. Do you have an obligation to 
compensate your pharmacist? If you move to 
a cheaper apartment, should you compensate 
your landlord? When you eat at McDonald’s, 
should you compensate the owners of the 
diner next door? Public policy should not be 
designed to advance moral instincts that we 
all reject every day of our lives.
In what morally relevant way, then, might 
displaced workers differ from displaced phar-
macists or displaced landlords? You might 
argue that pharmacists and landlords have 
always faced cutthroat competition and 
therefore knew what they were getting into, 
while decades of tariffs and quotas have led 
manufacturing workers to expect a modicum 
of protection. That expectation led them to 
develop certain skills, and now it’s unfair to 
pull the rug out from under them. 
Once again, that argument does not 
mesh with our everyday instincts. For many 
decades, schoolyard bullying has been a prof-
itable occupation. All across America, bullies 
have built up skills so they can take advan-
tage of that opportunity. If we toughen the 
rules to make bullying unprofitable, must we 
compensate the bullies?
Bullying and protectionism have a lot in 
common. They both use force (either directly or 
through the power of the law) to enrich some-
one else at your involuntary expense. If you’re 
forced to pay $20 an hour to an American for 
goods you could have bought from a Mexican 
for $5 an hour, you’re being extorted. When a 
free trade agreement allows you to buy from 
the Mexican after all, rejoice in your liberation.

Politicians and pundits often say that the government should help 
workers made worse off by international trade by, for example, paying 
for their retraining. In this opinion piece, an economist makes the op-
posite case.
9-3a The Jobs Argument
Opponents of free trade often argue that trade with other countries destroys do-
mestic jobs. In our example, free trade in textiles would cause the price of textiles 
to fall, reducing the quantity of textiles produced in Isoland and thus reducing 
employment in the Isolandian textile industry. Some Isolandian textile workers 
would lose their jobs.
Yet free trade creates jobs at the same time that it destroys them. When Isolan-
dians buy textiles from other countries, those countries obtain the resources to 
buy other goods from Isoland. Isolandian workers would move from the textile

industry to those industries in which Isoland has a comparative advantage. The 
transition may impose hardship on some workers in the short run, but it allows 
Isolandians as a whole to enjoy a higher standard of living.
Opponents of trade are often skeptical that trade creates jobs. They might re-
spond that everything can be produced more cheaply abroad. Under free trade, 
they might argue, Isolandians could not be profitably employed in any industry. 
As Chapter 3 explains, however, the gains from trade are based on comparative 
advantage, not absolute advantage. Even if one country is better than another 
country at producing everything, each country can still gain from trading with the 
other. Workers in each country will eventually find jobs in an industry in which 
that country has a comparative advantage.
9-3b The National-Security Argument
When an industry is threatened with competition from other countries, oppo-
nents of free trade often argue that the industry is vital to national security. For 
example, if Isoland were considering free trade in steel, domestic steel companies 
might point out that steel is used to make guns and tanks. Free trade would allow 
Isoland to become dependent on foreign countries to supply steel. If a war later 
broke out and the foreign supply was interrupted, Isoland might be unable to 
produce enough steel and weapons to defend itself.
Trouble with Trade 
By Paul Krugman
W
hile the United States has long imported 
oil and other raw materials from the 
third world, we used to import manufactured 
goods mainly from other rich countries like 
Canada, European nations and Japan. 
But recently we crossed an important wa-
tershed: we now import more manufactured 
goods from the third world than from other 
advanced economies. That is, a majority of 
our industrial trade is now with countries that 
are much poorer than we are and that pay 
their workers much lower wages.
For the world economy as a whole—and 
especially for poorer nations—growing trade 
between high-wage and low-wage countries 
is a very good thing. Above all, it offers back-
ward economies their best hope of moving up 
the income ladder.
But for American workers the story is 
much less positive. In fact, it’s hard to avoid 
the conclusion that growing U.S. trade with 
third-world countries reduces the real wages 
of many and perhaps most workers in this 
country. And that reality makes the politics of 
trade very difficult.
Let’s talk for a moment about the 
economics.
Trade between high-wage countries tends 
to be a modest win for all, or almost all, con-
cerned. When a free-trade pact made it pos-
sible to integrate the U.S. and Canadian auto 
industries in the 1960s, each country’s in-
dustry concentrated on producing a narrower 
range of products at larger scale. The result 
was an all-round, broadly shared rise in pro-
ductivity and wages.
By contrast, trade between countries at 
very different levels of economic development 
tends to create large classes of losers as well 
as winners. 
Although the outsourcing of some high-
tech jobs to India has made headlines, on 
balance, highly educated workers in the 
United States benefit from higher wages and 
expanded job opportunities because of trade. 
For example, ThinkPad notebook computers 
are now made by a Chinese company, Lenovo, 
but a lot of Lenovo’s research and develop-
ment is conducted in North Carolina. 
Second Thoughts about 
Free Trade
Some economists worry about the impact of trade on the ­distribution 
of income. Even if free trade enhances efficiency, it may reduce 
equality.

CHAPTER 9  APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
185
Economists acknowledge that protecting key industries may be appropri-
ate when there are legitimate concerns over national security. Yet they fear that 
this argument may be used too quickly by producers eager to gain at consumers’ 
expense. 
One should be wary of the national-security argument when it is made by rep-
resentatives of industry rather than the defense establishment. Companies have 
an incentive to exaggerate their role in national defense to obtain protection from 
foreign competition. A nation’s generals may see things very differently. Indeed, 
when the military is a consumer of an industry’s output, it would benefit from 
imports. Cheaper steel in Isoland, for example, would allow the Isolandian mili-
tary to accumulate a stockpile of weapons at lower cost. 
9-3c The Infant-Industry Argument
New industries sometimes argue for temporary trade restrictions to help them 
get started. After a period of protection, the argument goes, these industries will 
mature and be able to compete with foreign firms. 
Similarly, older industries sometimes argue that they need temporary protec-
tion to help them adjust to new conditions. For example, in 2002, President Bush 
imposed temporary tariffs on imported steel. He said, “I decided that imports 
were severely affecting our industry, an important industry.” The tariff, which 
lasted 20 months, offered “temporary relief so that the industry could restructure 
itself.” 
But workers with less formal education 
either see their jobs shipped overseas or find 
their wages driven down by the ripple ef-
fect as other workers with similar qualifica-
tions crowd into their industries and look for 
employment to replace the jobs they lost to 
foreign competition. And lower prices at Wal-
Mart aren’t sufficient compensation.
All this is textbook international econom-
ics: contrary to what people sometimes assert, 
economic theory says that free trade normally 
makes a country richer, but it doesn’t say that 
it’s normally good for everyone. Still, when the 
effects of third-world exports on U.S. wages 
first became an issue in the 1990s, a number 
of economists—myself included—looked at 
the data and concluded that any negative ef-
fects on U.S. wages were modest. 
The trouble now is that these effects may 
no longer be as modest as they were, because 
imports of manufactured goods from the third 
world have grown dramatically—from just 2.5 
percent of G.D.P. in 1990 to 6 percent in 2006. 
And the biggest growth in imports has 
come from countries with very low wages. The 
original “newly industrializing economies” 
exporting manufactured goods—South Ko-
rea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore—paid 
wages that were about 25 percent of U.S. lev-
els in 1990. Since then, however, the sources 
of our imports have shifted to Mexico, where 
wages are only 11 percent of the U.S. level, 
and China, where they’re only about 3 percent 
or 4 percent.
There are some qualifying aspects to this 
story. For example, many of those made-in-
China goods contain components made in 
Japan and other high-wage economies. Still, 
there’s little doubt that the pressure of glo-
balization on American wages has increased.
So am I arguing for protectionism? No. Those 
who think that globalization is always and every-
where a bad thing are wrong. On the contrary, 
keeping world markets relatively open is crucial 
to the hopes of billions of people. 
But I am arguing for an end to the 
finger-wagging, the accusation either of 
not understanding economics or of kowtow-
ing to special interests that tends to be the 
editorial response to politicians who express 
skepticism about the benefits of free-trade 
agreements.
It’s often claimed that limits on trade 
benefit only a small number of Americans, 
while hurting the vast majority. That’s still 
true of things like the import quota on sugar. 
But when it comes to manufactured goods, 
it’s at least arguable that the reverse is true. 
The highly educated workers who clearly ben-
efit from growing trade with third-world econ-
omies are a minority, greatly outnumbered by 
those who probably lose.
As I said, I’m not a protectionist. For the 
sake of the world as a whole, I hope that 
we respond to the trouble with trade not by 
shutting trade down, but by doing things like 
strengthening the social safety net. But those 
who are worried about trade have a point, and 
deserve some respect.

ics at Princeton University and winner of the

Markets and Welfare
Economists are often skeptical about such claims, largely because the infant-­
industry argument is difficult to implement in practice. To apply protection suc-
cessfully, the government would need to decide which industries will eventually 
be profitable and decide whether the benefits of establishing these industries 
­exceed the costs of this protection to consumers. Yet “picking winners” is extraor-
dinarily difficult. It is made even more difficult by the political process, which 
­often awards protection to those industries that are politically powerful. And once 
a powerful industry is protected from foreign competition, the “temporary” pol-
icy is sometimes hard to remove.
In addition, many economists are skeptical about the infant-industry argu-
ment in principle. Suppose, for instance, that an industry is young and unable to 
compete profitably against foreign rivals, but there is reason to believe that the 
industry can be profitable in the long run. In this case, firm owners should be 
willing to incur temporary losses to obtain the eventual profits. Protection is not 
necessary for an infant industry to grow. History shows that start-up firms often 
incur temporary losses and succeed in the long run, even without protection from 
competition.
9-3d The Unfair-Competition Argument
A common argument is that free trade is desirable only if all countries play 
by the same rules. If firms in different countries are subject to different laws 
and regulations, then it is unfair (the argument goes) to expect the firms to 
compete in the international marketplace. For instance, suppose that the gov-
ernment of Neighborland subsidizes its textile industry by giving textile com-
panies large tax breaks. The Isolandian textile industry might argue that it 
should be protected from this foreign competition because Neighborland is 
not competing fairly.
Would it, in fact, hurt Isoland to buy textiles from another country at a subsi-
dized price? Certainly, Isolandian textile producers would suffer, but Isolandian 
textile consumers would benefit from the low price. The case for free trade is the 
same as before: The gains of the consumers from buying at the low price would 
exceed the losses of the producers. Neighborland’s subsidy to its textile indus-
try may be a bad policy, but it is the taxpayers of Neighborland who bear the 
burden. Isoland can benefit from the opportunity to buy textiles at a subsidized 
price. Rather than objecting to the foreign subsidies, perhaps Isoland should send 
Neighborland a thank-you note.
9-3e The Protection-as-a-Bargaining-Chip Argument
Another argument for trade restrictions concerns the strategy of bargaining. 
Many policymakers claim to support free trade but, at the same time, argue that 
trade restrictions can be useful when we bargain with our trading partners. They 
claim that the threat of a trade restriction can help remove a trade restriction 
already imposed by a foreign government. For example, Isoland might threaten 
to impose a tariff on textiles unless Neighborland removes its tariff on wheat. 
If Neighborland responds to this threat by removing its tariff, the result can be 
freer trade.
The problem with this bargaining strategy is that the threat may not work. 
If it doesn’t work, the country faces a choice between two bad options. It can 
carry out its threat and implement the trade restriction, which would reduce

CHAPTER 9  APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
187
Trade Agreements and the World Trade Organization
A country can take one of two approaches to achieving free trade. It 
can take a unilateral approach and remove its trade restrictions on its 
own. This is the approach that Great Britain took in the 19th century and 
that Chile and South Korea have taken in recent years. Alternatively, a country 
can take a multilateral approach and reduce its trade restrictions while other coun-
tries do the same. In other words, it can bargain with its trading partners in an 
attempt to reduce trade restrictions around the world. 
One important example of the multilateral approach is the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which in 1993 lowered trade barriers among the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada. Another is the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT), which is a continuing series of negotiations among many of 
the world’s countries with the goal of promoting free trade. The United States 
helped to found GATT after World War II in response to the high tariffs imposed 
during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Many economists believe that the high 
tariffs contributed to the worldwide economic hardship of that period. GATT 
has successfully reduced the average tariff among member countries from about  
40 percent after World War II to about 5 percent today. 
The rules established under GATT are now enforced by an international insti-
tution called the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO was established in 
1995 and has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. As of 2009, 153 countries 
have joined the organization, accounting for more than 97 percent of world trade. 
The functions of the WTO are to administer trade agreements, provide a forum 
for negotiations, and handle disputes among member countries.
What are the pros and cons of the multilateral approach to free trade? One 
­advantage is that the multilateral approach has the potential to result in freer 
trade than a unilateral approach because it can reduce trade restrictions abroad 
as well as at home. If international negotiations fail, however, the result could be 
more restricted trade than under a unilateral approach.
In addition, the multilateral approach may have a political advantage. In 
most markets, producers are fewer and better organized than consumers—and 
thus wield greater political influence. Reducing the Isolandian tariff on textiles, 
for example, may be politically difficult if considered by itself. The textile com-
panies would oppose free trade, and the buyers of textiles who would benefit 
are so numerous that organizing their support would be difficult. Yet suppose 
that Neighborland promises to reduce its tariff on wheat at the same time that 
­Isoland reduces its tariff on textiles. In this case, the Isolandian wheat farmers, 
who are also politically powerful, would back the agreement. Thus, the multilat-
eral ­approach to free trade can sometimes win political support when a unilateral 
approach cannot.

9-4 Conclusion
Economists and the public often disagree about free trade. In 2008, the Los ­Angeles 
Times asked the American public, “Generally speaking, do you believe that free 
international trade has helped or hurt the economy, or hasn’t it made a differ-
ence to the economy one way or the other?” Only 26 percent of those polled said 
free international trade helped, whereas 50 percent thought it hurt. (The rest 
thought it made no difference or were unsure.) By contrast, most economists sup-
port free international trade. They view free trade as a way of allocating produc-
tion efficiently and raising living standards both at home and abroad. 
Economists view the United States as an ongoing experiment that confirms the 
virtues of free trade. Throughout its history, the United States has allowed unre-
stricted trade among the states, and the country as a whole has benefited from the 
specialization that trade allows. Florida grows oranges, Alaska pumps oil, ­California 
makes wine, and so on. Americans would not enjoy the high standard of living they 
do today if people could consume only those goods and services produced in their 
own states. The world could similarly benefit from free trade among countries.
To better understand economists’ view of trade, let’s continue our parable. 
Suppose that the president of Isoland, after reading the latest poll results, ignores 
the advice of her economics team and decides not to allow free trade in textiles. 
The country remains in the equilibrium without international trade.
Then, one day, some Isolandian inventor discovers a new way to make tex-
tiles at very low cost. The process is quite mysterious, however, and the inventor 
insists on keeping it a secret. What is odd is that the inventor doesn’t need tradi-
tional inputs such as cotton or wool. The only material input he needs is wheat. 
And even more oddly, to manufacture textiles from wheat, he hardly needs any 
labor input at all.
The inventor is hailed as a genius. Because everyone buys clothing, the lower 
cost of textiles allows all Isolandians to enjoy a higher standard of living. ­Workers 
who had previously produced textiles experience some hardship when their fac-
tories close, but they eventually find work in other industries. Some become farm-
ers and grow the wheat that the inventor turns into textiles. Others enter new 
industries that emerge as a result of higher Isolandian living standards. Everyone 
understands that the displacement of workers in outmoded industries is an inevi-
table part of technological progress and economic growth. 
After several years, a newspaper reporter decides to investigate this mysteri-
ous new textiles process. She sneaks into the inventor’s factory and learns that the 
inventor is a fraud. The inventor has not been making textiles at all. Instead, he has 
been smuggling wheat abroad in exchange for textiles from other countries. The 
only thing that the inventor had discovered was the gains from international trade.
When the truth is revealed, the government shuts down the inventor’s opera-
tion. The price of textiles rises, and workers return to jobs in textile factories. ­Living 
standards in Isoland fall back to their former levels. The inventor is jailed and held 
up to public ridicule. After all, he was no inventor. He was just an economist.

  1.	 If a nation that does not allow international trade in 
steel has a domestic price of steel lower than the world 
price, then
a.	 the nation has a comparative advantage in produc-
ing steel and would become a steel exporter if it 
opened up trade.
b.	 the nation has a comparative advantage in produc-
ing steel and would become a steel importer if it 
opened up trade.
c.	 the nation does not have a comparative advantage 
in producing steel and would become a steel ex-

a.	 Domestic production of coffee rises, and Ectenia 
becomes a coffee importer.
b.	 Domestic production of coffee rises, and Ectenia 
becomes a coffee exporter.
c.	 Domestic production of coffee falls, and Ectenia 
becomes a coffee importer.
d.	 Domestic production of coffee falls, and Ectenia 
becomes a coffee exporter.

a.	 producer surplus decreases, but consumer surplus 
and total surplus both increase.
b.	 producer surplus decreases, consumer surplus 
increases, and so the impact on total surplus is

Quick Check Multiple Choice
•	
The effects of free trade can be determined by com-
paring the domestic price without trade to the world 
price. A low domestic price indicates that the country 
has a comparative advantage in producing the good 
and that the country will become an exporter. A high 
domestic price indicates that the rest of the world has 
a comparative advantage in producing the good and 
that the country will become an importer. 
•	
When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter 
of a good, producers of the good are better off, and 
consumers of the good are worse off. When a country 
allows trade and becomes an importer of a good, con-
sumers are better off, and producers are worse off. In 
both cases, the gains from trade exceed the losses.
•	
A tariff—a tax on imports—moves a market closer to 
the equilibrium that would exist without trade and, 
therefore, reduces the gains from trade. Although do-
mestic producers are better off and the government 
raises revenue, the losses to consumers exceed these 
gains.
•	
There are various arguments for restricting trade: 
protecting jobs, defending national security, helping 
infant industries, preventing unfair competition, and 
responding to foreign trade restrictions. Although 
some of these arguments have merit in some cases, 
economists believe that free trade is usually the better 
policy.

corn, and rice. In 2008, the Chinese government, 
concerned that grain exports were driving up food 
prices for domestic consumers, imposed a tax on 
grain exports.
a.	 Draw the graph that describes the market for 
grain in an exporting country. Use this graph 
as the ­starting point to answer the following 
questions.
b.	 How does an export tax affect domestic grain 
prices? 
c.	 How does it affect the welfare of domestic con-
sumers, the welfare of domestic producers, and 
­government revenue?
d.	 What happens to total welfare in China, as mea-
sured by the sum of consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, and tax revenue?
  7.	 Consider a country that imports a good from abroad. 
For each of following statements, state whether it is 
true or false. Explain your answer.
a.	 “The greater the elasticity of demand, the greater 
the gains from trade.”
b.	 “If demand is perfectly inelastic, there are no gains 
from trade.”
c.	 “If demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers do not 
benefit from trade.” 
  8.	 Kawmin is a small country that produces and con-
sumes jelly beans. The world price of jelly beans is 
$1 per bag, and Kawmin’s domestic demand and 
supply for jelly beans are governed by the following 
equations:
Demand: QD = 8 − P
Supply: QS = P,
where P is in dollars per bag and Q is in bags of jelly 
beans.
a.	 Draw a well-labeled graph of the situation in 
­Kawmin if the nation does not allow trade. 
­Calculate the following (recalling that the area of 
a triangle is ½ × base × height): the equilibrium 
price and quantity, consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, and total surplus.
b.	 Kawmin then opens the market to trade. Draw 
another graph to describe the new situation in 
the jelly bean market. Calculate the equilibrium 
price, quantities of consumption and production, 
imports, consumer surplus, producer surplus, and 
total surplus.
c.	 After a while, the Czar of Kawmin responds 
to the pleas of jelly bean producers by placing 
a $1 per bag tariff on jelly bean imports. On a 
graph, show the effects of this tariff. Calculate 
the equilibrium price, quantities of consump-
tion and production, imports, consumer surplus, 
producer surplus, ­government revenue, and total 
surplus.
d.	 What are the gains from opening up trade? 
What are the deadweight losses from restrict-
ing trade with the tariff? Give numerical 
answers.
  9.	 Having rejected a tariff on textiles (a tax on im-
ports), the president of Isoland is now considering 
the same-sized tax on textile consumption (includ-
ing both imported and domestically produced 
textiles).
a.	 Using Figure 4, identify the quantity consumed 
and the quantity produced in Isoland under a 
­textile consumption tax. 
b.	 Construct a table similar to that in Figure 4 for the 
textile consumption tax.
c.	 Which raises more revenue for the government—
the consumption tax or the tariff?  Which has a 
smaller deadweight loss?  Explain.
  10.	Assume the United States is an importer of televi-
sions and there are no trade restrictions. U.S. con-
sumers buy 1 million televisions per year, of which 
400,000 are produced domestically and 600,000 are 
imported. 
a.	 Suppose that a technological advance among 
­Japanese television manufacturers causes the 
world price of televisions to fall by $100. Draw 
a graph to show how this change affects the 
welfare of U.S. consumers and U.S. producers 
and how it affects total surplus in the United 
States.
b.	 After the fall in price, consumers buy 1.2 mil-
lion televisions, of which 200,000 are produced 
domestically and 1 million are imported. Cal-
culate the change in consumer surplus, pro-
ducer surplus, and total surplus from the price 
reduction.
c.	 If the government responded by putting a $100 
tariff on imported televisions, what would this do? 
Calculate the revenue that would be raised and the 
deadweight loss. Would it be a good policy from 
the standpoint of U.S. welfare? Who might support 
the policy? 
d.	 Suppose that the fall in price is attributable not 
to technological advance but to a $100 per televi-
sion subsidy from the Japanese government to 
Japanese industry. How would this affect your 
analysis?

irms that make and sell paper also create, as a by-product of the manufactur-
ing process, a chemical called dioxin. Scientists believe that once dioxin enters 
the environment, it raises the population’s risk of cancer, birth defects, and 
other health problems.
Is the production and release of dioxin a problem for society? In Chapters 4 
through 9, we examined how markets allocate scarce resources with the forces of 
supply and demand, and we saw that the equilibrium of supply and demand is 
typically an efficient allocation of resources. To use Adam Smith’s famous meta-
phor, the “invisible hand” of the marketplace leads self-interested buyers 
and sellers in a market to maximize the total benefit that society derives from 
that market. This insight is the basis for one of the Ten Principles of ­Economics 
in Chapter 1: Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. 
Should we conclude, therefore, that the invisible hand prevents firms in the 
paper market from emitting too much dioxin?

PART IV	
THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Markets do many things well, but they do not do everything well. In this 
­chapter, we begin our study of another of the Ten Principles of Economics: 
­Government action can sometimes improve upon market outcomes. We examine 
why markets sometimes fail to allocate resources efficiently, how government pol-
icies can ­potentially improve the market’s allocation, and what kinds of policies 
are likely to work best. 
The market failures examined in this chapter fall under a general category 
called externalities. An externality arises when a person engages in an activity that 
influences the well-being of a bystander but neither pays nor receives compensa-
tion for that effect. If the impact on the bystander is adverse, it is called a ­negative 
externality. If it is beneficial, it is called a positive externality. In the presence of 
­externalities, society’s interest in a market outcome extends beyond the well- 
being of buyers and sellers who participate in the market to include the well-being 
of bystanders who are affected indirectly. Because buyers and sellers ­neglect the 
external effects of their actions when deciding how much to demand or supply, 
the market equilibrium is not efficient when there are externalities. That is, the 
equilibrium fails to maximize the total benefit to society as a whole. The release of 
dioxin into the environment, for instance, is a negative externality. Self-­interested 
paper firms will not consider the full cost of the pollution they create in their 
production process, and consumers of paper will not consider the full cost of the 
­pollution they contribute to as a result of their purchasing decisions. Therefore, 
the firms will emit too much pollution unless the government prevents or dis-
courages them from doing so.
Externalities come in many varieties, as do the policy responses that try to deal 
with the market failure. Here are some examples:
•	 The exhaust from automobiles is a negative externality because it creates smog 
that other people have to breathe. As a result of this externality, drivers tend to 
pollute too much. The federal government attempts to solve this problem by 
setting emission standards for cars. It also taxes gasoline to reduce the amount 
that people drive.
•	 Restored historic buildings convey a positive externality because people who 
walk or ride by them can enjoy the beauty and the sense of history that these 
buildings provide. Building owners do not get the full benefit of restoration 
and, therefore, tend to discard older buildings too quickly. Many local govern-
ments respond to this problem by regulating the destruction of historic build-
ings and by providing tax breaks to owners who restore them.
•	 Barking dogs create a negative externality because neighbors are disturbed by 
the noise. Dog owners do not bear the full cost of the noise and, therefore, tend 
to take too few precautions to prevent their dogs from barking. Local govern-
ments address this problem by making it illegal to “disturb the peace.”
•	 Research into new technologies provides a positive externality because it cre-
ates knowledge that other people can use. Because inventors cannot capture 
the full benefits of their inventions, they tend to devote too few resources to 
research. The federal government addresses this problem partially through the 
patent system, which gives inventors exclusive use of their inventions for a 
limited time.
In each of these cases, some decision maker fails to take account of the external 
effects of his behavior. The government responds by trying to influence this be-
havior to protect the interests of bystanders.

10-1 Externalities and Market Inefficiency
In this section, we use the tools of welfare economics developed in Chapter 7 to 
examine how externalities affect economic well-being. The analysis shows pre-
cisely why externalities cause markets to allocate resources inefficiently. Later in 
this chapter, we examine various ways in which private individuals and public 
policymakers may remedy this type of market failure.
10-1a Welfare Economics: A Recap
We begin by recalling the key lessons of welfare economics from Chapter 7. To make 
our analysis concrete, we consider a specific market—the market for aluminum. 
Figure 1 shows the supply and demand curves in the market for aluminum. 
Recall from Chapter 7 that the supply and demand curves contain important 
information about costs and benefits. The demand curve for aluminum reflects 
the value of aluminum to consumers, as measured by the prices they are willing 
to pay. At any given quantity, the height of the demand curve shows the willing-
ness to pay of the marginal buyer. In other words, it shows the value to the con-
sumer of the last unit of aluminum bought. Similarly, the supply curve reflects 
the costs of producing aluminum. At any given quantity, the height of the supply 
curve shows the cost to the marginal seller. In other words, it shows the cost to the 
producer of the last unit of aluminum sold.
In the absence of government intervention, the price adjusts to balance the 
supply and demand for aluminum. The quantity produced and consumed in 
the market equilibrium, shown as QMARKET in  Figure 1, is efficient in the sense 
that it maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. That is, the market 
­allocates resources in a way that maximizes the total value to the consumers who 
buy and use aluminum minus the total costs to the producers who make and sell 
aluminum.
FIGURE 1
The Market for Aluminum
The demand curve reflects 
the value to buyers, and the 
­supply curve reflects the costs 
of ­sellers. The equilibrium 
­quantity, QMARKET, maximizes 
the total value to buyers ­minus 
the total costs of ­sellers.  
In the ­absence of ­externalities, 
­therefore, the market 
­equilibrium is efficient.

THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
10-1b Negative Externalities
Now let’s suppose that aluminum factories emit pollution: For each unit of alu-
minum produced, a certain amount of smoke enters the atmosphere. Because this 
smoke creates a health risk for those who breathe the air, it is a negative external-
ity. How does this externality affect the efficiency of the market outcome?
Because of the externality, the cost to society of producing aluminum is larger 
than the cost to the aluminum producers. For each unit of aluminum produced, the 
social cost includes the private costs of the aluminum producers plus the costs to 
those bystanders affected adversely by the pollution. Figure 2 shows the social cost 
of producing aluminum. The social-cost curve is above the supply curve because it 
takes into account the external costs imposed on society by aluminum production. 
The difference between these two curves reflects the cost of the pollution emitted.
What quantity of aluminum should be produced? To answer this question, 
we once again consider what a benevolent social planner would do. The planner 
wants to maximize the total surplus derived from the market—the value to con-
sumers of aluminum minus the cost of producing aluminum. The planner under-
stands, however, that the cost of producing aluminum includes the external costs 
of the pollution.
The planner would choose the level of aluminum production at which the 
­demand curve crosses the social-cost curve. This intersection determines the 
­optimal amount of aluminum from the standpoint of society as a whole. Below 
this level of production, the value of the aluminum to consumers (as measured by 
the height of the demand curve) exceeds the social cost of producing it (as mea-
sured by the height of the social-cost curve). The planner does not produce more 
than this level because the social cost of producing additional aluminum exceeds 
the value to consumers.
Note that the equilibrium quantity of aluminum, QMARKET, is larger than the 
socially optimal quantity, QOPTIMUM. This inefficiency occurs because the market 
equilibrium reflects only the private costs of production. In the market equilib-
rium, the marginal consumer values aluminum at less than the social cost of pro-
ducing it. That is, at QMARKET, the demand curve lies below the social-cost curve.

if being a leading 
manufacturer means 
being a leading polluter,

CHAPTER 10  EXTERNALITIES
199
Thus, reducing aluminum production and consumption below the market equi-
librium level raises total economic well-being.
How can the social planner achieve the optimal outcome? One way would be 
to tax aluminum producers for each ton of aluminum sold. The tax would shift the 
supply curve for aluminum upward by the size of the tax. If the tax accurately re-
flected the external cost of pollutants released into the atmosphere, the new supply 
curve would coincide with the social-cost curve. In the new market equilibrium, 
aluminum producers would produce the socially optimal quantity of aluminum. 
The use of such a tax is called internalizing the externality because it gives 
buyers and sellers in the market an incentive to take into account the external 
effects of their actions. Aluminum producers would, in essence, take the costs of 
pollution into account when deciding how much aluminum to supply because 
the tax would make them pay for these external costs. And, because the market 
price would reflect the tax on producers, consumers of aluminum would have an 
incentive to use a smaller quantity. The policy is based on one of the Ten Principles 
of Economics: People respond to incentives. Later in this chapter, we consider in 
more detail how policymakers can deal with externalities.
10-1c Positive Externalities
Although some activities impose costs on third parties, others yield benefits. For 
example, consider education. To a large extent, the benefit of education is private: 
The consumer of education becomes a more productive worker and thus reaps 
much of the benefit in the form of higher wages. Beyond these private benefits, 
however, education also yields positive externalities. One externality is that a more 
educated population leads to more informed voters, which means better govern-
ment for everyone. Another externality is that a more educated population tends 
to mean lower crime rates. A third externality is that a more educated population 
may encourage the development and dissemination of technological advances, 
leading to higher productivity and wages for everyone. Because of these three pos-
itive externalities, a person may prefer to have neighbors who are well educated. 
The analysis of positive externalities is similar to the analysis of negative exter-
nalities. As Figure 3 shows, the demand curve does not reflect the value to society 
internalizing the 
externality
altering incentives so that 
people take account of the 
external effects of their 
actions

THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
The Lorax Was Wrong: 
Skyscrapers Are Green
By Edward L. Glaeser
I
n Dr. Seuss’s environmentalist fable, “The 
Lorax,” the Once-ler, a budding textile mag-
nate, chops down Truffula to knit “Thneeds.” 
Over the protests of the environmentally 
sensitive Lorax, the Once-ler builds a great 
industrial town that despoils the environment, 
because he “had to grow bigger.” ­Eventually, 
the Once-ler overdoes it, and he chops down 
the last Truffula tree, destroying the source of 
his income. Chastened, Dr. ­Seuss’s industri-
alist turns green, urging a young listener to 
take the last Truffula seed and plant a new 
forest. 
Some of the lessons told by this story are 
correct. From a purely profit-maximizing point 
of view, the Once-ler is pretty inept, because 
he kills his golden goose. Any good manage-
ment consultant would have told him to man-
age his growth more wisely. One aspect of the 
story’s environmentalist message, that bad 
things happen when we overfish a common 
pool, is also correct. 
But the unfortunate aspect of the story 
is that urbanization comes off terribly. The 
forests are good; the factories are bad. Not 
only does the story disparage the remarkable 
benefits that came from the mass produc-
tion of clothing in 19th-century textile towns, 
it sends exactly the wrong message on the 
environment. Contrary to the story’s implied 
message, living in cities is green, while living 
surrounded by forests is brown. 
By building taller and taller buildings, the 
Once-ler was proving himself to be the real 
environmentalist. 
Matthew Kahn, a U.C.L.A. environmen-
tal economist, and I looked across America’s 
metropolitan areas and calculated the carbon 
emissions associated with a new home in 
different parts of the country. We estimated 
expected energy use from driving and public 
transportation, for a family of fixed size and 
income. We added in carbon emissions from 
home electricity and home heating…. 
In almost every metropolitan area, we 
found the central city residents emitted less 
carbon than the suburban counterparts. In 
New York and San Francisco, the average 
urban family emits more than two tons less 
carbon annually because it drives less. In 
Nashville, the city-suburb carbon gap due 
to driving is more than three tons. After all, 
density is the defining characteristic of cities. 
All that closeness means that people need to 
travel shorter distances, and that shows up 
clearly in the data. 
While public transportation certainly uses 
much less energy, per rider, than driving, 
large carbon reductions are possible without 
any switch to buses or rails. Higher-density 
suburban areas, which are still entirely car-
dependent, still involve a lot less travel than 
the really sprawling places. This fact offers 
some hope for greens eager to reduce carbon 
emissions, since it is a lot easier to imagine 
Americans driving shorter distances than giv-
ing up their cars. 
But cars represent only one-third of the 
gap in carbon emissions between New Yorkers 
and their suburbanites. The gap in electricity 
usage between New York City and its suburbs 
is also about two tons. The gap in emissions 
from home heating is almost three tons. All 
told, we estimate a seven-ton difference 
in carbon emissions between the residents 
of Manhattan’s urban aeries and the good 
burghers of Westchester County. Living sur-
rounded by concrete is actually pretty green. 
Living surrounded by trees is not. 
The policy prescription that follows from 
this is that environmentalists should be 
championing the growth of more and taller 
skyscrapers. Every new crane in New York City 
means less low-density development. The 
environmental ideal should be an apartment 
in downtown San Francisco, not a ranch in 
Marin County.
Of course, many environmentalists will 
still prefer to take their cue from Henry ­David 
Thoreau, who advocated living alone in the 
woods. They would do well to remember that 
Thoreau, in a sloppy chowder-cooking mo-
ment, burned down 300 acres of prime 
­Concord woodland. Few Boston merchants did 
as much environmental harm, which suggests 
that if you want to take good care of the envi-
ronment, stay away from it and live in cities.

Harvard University.

of the good. Because the social value is greater than the private value, the social-
value curve lies above the demand curve. The optimal quantity is found where 
the social-value curve and the supply curve  intersect. Hence, the socially opti-
mal quantity is greater than the quantity that the private market would naturally 
reach on its own. 
Once again, the government can correct the market failure by inducing market 
participants to internalize the externality. The appropriate response in the case of 
positive externalities is exactly the opposite to the case of negative externalities. To 
move the market equilibrium closer to the social optimum, a positive externality 
requires a subsidy. In fact, that is exactly the policy the government follows: Edu-
cation is heavily subsidized through public schools and government scholarships.
To summarize: Negative externalities lead markets to produce a larger quantity than 
is socially desirable. Positive externalities lead markets to produce a smaller quantity than 
is socially desirable. To remedy the problem, the government can internalize the external-
ity by taxing goods that have negative externalities and subsidizing goods that have posi-
tive externalities.
Technology Spillovers, Industrial Policy, and Patent Protection
A potentially important type of positive externality is called a technol-
ogy spillover—the impact of one firm’s research and production efforts 
on other firms’ access to technological advance. For example, consider the 
market for industrial robots. Robots are at the frontier of a rapidly changing 
technology. Whenever a firm builds a robot, there is some chance that the firm 
will discover a new and better design. This new design may benefit not only this 
firm but also society as a whole because the design will enter society’s pool of 
technological knowledge. That is, the new design may have positive externalities 
for other producers in the economy.
In this case, the government can internalize the externality by subsidizing the 
production of robots. If the government paid firms a subsidy for each robot pro-
duced, the supply curve would shift down by the amount of the subsidy, and this 
shift would increase the equilibrium quantity of robots. To ensure that the market 
equilibrium equals the social optimum, the subsidy should equal the value of the 
technology spillover.
How large are technology spillovers, and what do they imply for public pol-
icy? This is an important question because technological progress is the key to 
why living standards rise over time. Yet it is also a difficult question on which 
economists often disagree. 
Some economists believe that technology spillovers are pervasive and that the 
government should encourage those industries that yield the largest spillovers. 
For instance, these economists argue that if making computer chips yields greater 
spillovers than making potato chips, the government should encourage the pro-
duction of computer chips relative to the production of potato chips. The U.S. tax 
code does this in a limited way by offering special tax breaks for expenditures on 
research and development. Some nations go further by subsidizing specific in-
dustries that supposedly yield large technology spillovers. Government interven-
tion that aims to promote technology-enhancing industries is sometimes called 
­industrial policy. 
Other economists are skeptical about industrial policy. Even if technol-
ogy spillovers are common, the success of an industrial policy requires that the 
case

government be able to measure the size of the spillovers from different markets. 
This measurement problem is difficult at best. Moreover, without precise mea-
surements, the political system may end up subsidizing industries with the most 
political clout rather than those that yield the largest positive externalities.
Another way to deal with technology spillovers is patent protection. The patent 
laws protect the rights of inventors by giving them exclusive use of their inventions 
for a period of time. When a firm makes a technological breakthrough, it can pat-
ent the idea and capture much of the economic benefit for itself. The patent inter-
nalizes the externality by giving the firm a property right over its ­invention. If other 
firms want to use the new technology, they have to obtain permission from the 
inventing firm and pay it a royalty. Thus, the patent system gives firms a greater 
incentive to engage in research and other activities that ­advance ­technology. 
Quick Quiz  Give an example of a negative externality and a positive externality. Ex-
plain why market outcomes are inefficient in the presence of these externalities.
We have discussed why externalities lead markets to allocate resources ineffi-
ciently but have mentioned only briefly how this inefficiency can be remedied. In 
practice, both public policymakers and private individuals respond to externali-
ties in various ways. All of the remedies share the goal of moving the allocation of 
resources closer to the social optimum. 
This section considers governmental solutions. As a general matter, the govern-
ment can respond to externalities in one of two ways. Command-and-control policies 
regulate behavior directly. Market-based policies provide incentives so that private 
decision makers will choose to solve the problem on their own.
10-2a Command-and-Control Policies: Regulation
The government can remedy an externality by either requiring or forbidding cer-
tain behaviors. For example, it is a crime to dump poisonous chemicals into the 
water supply. In this case, the external costs to society far exceed the benefits to 
the polluter. The government therefore institutes a command-and-control policy 
that prohibits this act altogether. 
In most cases of pollution, however, the situation is not this simple. Despite 
the stated goals of some environmentalists, it would be impossible to prohibit all 
polluting activity. For example, virtually all forms of transportation—even the 
horse—produce some undesirable polluting by-products. But it would not be 
sensible for the government to ban all transportation. Thus, instead of trying to 
eradicate pollution entirely, society has to weigh the costs and benefits to decide 
the kinds and quantities of pollution it will allow. In the United States, the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the government agency with the task of 
developing and enforcing regulations aimed at protecting the environment. 
Environmental regulations can take many forms. Sometimes the EPA dictates a 
maximum level of pollution that a factory may emit. Other times the EPA requires 
that firms adopt a particular technology to reduce emissions. In all cases, to de-
sign good rules, the government regulators need to know the details about spe-
cific industries and about the alternative technologies that those industries could 
adopt. This information is often difficult for government regulators to obtain.

10-2b Market-Based Policy 1: Corrective Taxes 
and Subsidies
Instead of regulating behavior in response to an externality, the government can 
use market-based policies to align private incentives with social efficiency. For 
instance, as we saw earlier, the government can internalize the externality by tax-
ing activities that have negative externalities and subsidizing activities that have 
positive externalities. Taxes enacted to deal with the effects of negative externali-
ties are called corrective taxes. They are also called Pigovian taxes after economist 
Arthur Pigou (1877–1959), an early advocate of their use. An ideal corrective tax 
would equal the external cost from an activity with negative externalities, and an 
ideal corrective subsidy would equal the external benefit from an activity with 
positive externalities.
Economists usually prefer corrective taxes to regulations as a way to deal with 
pollution because they can reduce pollution at a lower cost to society. To see why, 
let us consider an example. 
Suppose that two factories—a paper mill and a steel mill—are each dumping 
500 tons of glop into a river every year. The EPA decides that it wants to reduce 
the amount of pollution. It considers two solutions:
•	 Regulation: The EPA could tell each factory to reduce its pollution to 300 tons 
of glop per year.
•	 Corrective tax: The EPA could levy a tax on each factory of $50,000 for each ton 
of glop it emits. 
The regulation would dictate a level of pollution, whereas the tax would give fac-
tory owners an economic incentive to reduce pollution. Which solution do you 
think is better?
Most economists prefer the tax. To explain this preference, they would first 
point out that a tax is just as effective as a regulation in reducing the overall level 
of pollution. The EPA can achieve whatever level of pollution it wants by setting 
the tax at the appropriate level. The higher the tax, the larger the reduction in pol-
lution. If the tax is high enough, the factories will close down altogether, reducing 
pollution to zero. 
Although regulation and corrective taxes are both capable of reducing pollu-
tion, the tax accomplishes this goal more efficiently. The regulation requires each 
factory to reduce pollution by the same amount. An equal reduction, however, is 
not ­necessarily the least expensive way to clean up the water. It is possible that the 
paper mill can reduce pollution at lower cost than the steel mill. If so, the paper 
mill would respond to the tax by reducing pollution substantially to avoid the 
tax, whereas the steel mill would respond by reducing pollution less and paying 
the tax. 
In essence, the corrective tax places a price on the right to pollute. Just as mar-
kets allocate goods to those buyers who value them most highly, a corrective 
tax allocates pollution to those factories that face the highest cost of reducing it. 
Whatever level of pollution the EPA chooses, it can achieve this goal at the lowest 
total cost using a tax.
Economists also argue that corrective taxes are better for the environment. 
­Under the command-and-control policy of regulation, the factories have no reason 
to reduce emission further once they have reached the target of 300 tons of glop. By 
contrast, the tax gives the factories an incentive to develop cleaner technologies be-
cause a cleaner technology would reduce the amount of tax the factory has to pay.

PART IV	
THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Corrective taxes are unlike most other taxes. As we discussed in Chapter 8, 
most taxes distort incentives and move the allocation of resources away from the 
social optimum. The reduction in economic well-being—that is, in consumer and 
producer surplus—exceeds the amount of revenue the government raises, result-
ing in a deadweight loss. By contrast, when externalities are present, society also 
cares about the well-being of the affected bystanders. Corrective taxes alter incen-
tives that market participants face to account for the presence of externalities and 
thereby move the allocation of resources closer to the social optimum. Thus, while 
corrective taxes raise revenue for the government, they also enhance economic 
efficiency.
Why Is Gasoline Taxed So Heavily?
In many nations, gasoline is among the most heavily taxed goods. The 
gas tax can be viewed as a corrective tax aimed at addressing three nega-
tive externalities associated with driving:
•	 Congestion: If you have ever been stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, you have 
probably wished that there were fewer cars on the road. A gasoline tax keeps 
congestion down by encouraging people to take public transportation, carpool 
more often, and live closer to work. 
•	 Accidents: Whenever people buy large cars or sport-utility vehicles, they may 
make themselves safer but they certainly put their neighbors at risk. Accord-
ing to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a person driving 
a typical car is five times as likely to die if hit by a sport-utility vehicle than if 
hit by another car. The gas tax is an indirect way of making people pay when 
their large, gas-guzzling vehicles impose risk on others. It would induce them 
to take this risk into account when choosing what vehicle to purchase.

10-2c Market-Based Policy 2: 
Tradable Pollution Permits
Returning to our example of the paper mill and the steel mill, let us suppose that, 
despite the advice of its economists, the EPA adopts the regulation and requires 
each factory to reduce its pollution to 300 tons of glop per year. Then one day, 
after the regulation is in place and both mills have complied, the two firms go to 
the EPA with a proposal. The steel mill wants to increase its emission of glop by 
100 tons. The paper mill has agreed to reduce its emission by the same amount if 
the steel mill pays it $5 million. Should the EPA allow the two factories to make 
this deal?
From the standpoint of economic efficiency, allowing the deal is good policy. 
The deal must make the owners of the two factories better off because they are 
voluntarily agreeing to it. Moreover, the deal does not have any external effects 
because the total amount of pollution remains the same. Thus, social welfare is 
enhanced by allowing the paper mill to sell its pollution rights to the steel mill.
The same logic applies to any voluntary transfer of the right to pollute from 
one firm to another. If the EPA allows firms to make these deals, it will, in essence, 
have created a new scarce resource: pollution permits. A market to trade these 
permits will eventually develop, and that market will be governed by the forces 
of supply and demand. The invisible hand will ensure that this new market allo-
cates the right to pollute efficiently. That is, the permits will end up in the hands 
of those firms that value them most highly, as judged by their willingness to pay. 
A firm’s willingness to pay for the right to pollute, in turn, will depend on its cost 
of reducing pollution: The more costly it is for a firm to cut back on pollution, the 
more it will be willing to pay for a permit.
An advantage of allowing a market for pollution permits is that the initial 
­allocation of pollution permits among firms does not matter from the standpoint 
•	 Pollution: Cars cause smog. Moreover, the burning of fossil fuels such as gaso-
line is widely believed to be the primary cause of global warming. Experts dis-
agree about how dangerous this threat is, but there is no doubt that the gas tax 
reduces the threat by reducing the use of gasoline.
So the gas tax, rather than causing deadweight losses like most taxes, actually 
makes the economy work better. It means less traffic congestion, safer roads, and 
a cleaner environment.
How high should the tax on gasoline be? Most European countries impose 
gasoline taxes that are much higher than those in the United States. Many observ-
ers have suggested that the United States should also tax gasoline more heav-
ily. A 2007 study published in the Journal of Economic Literature summarized the 
research on the size of the various externalities associated with driving. It con-
cluded that the optimal corrective tax on gasoline was $2.28 per gallon in 2005 
dollars; after adjusting for inflation, that amount is equivalent to about $2.70 per 
gallon in 2012 dollars. By contrast, the actual tax in the United States in 2012 was 
only about 50 cents per gallon.
The tax revenue from a gasoline tax could be used to lower taxes that distort 
incentives and cause deadweight losses, such as income taxes. In addition, some 
of the burdensome government regulations that require automakers to produce 
more fuel-efficient cars would prove unnecessary. This idea, however, has never 
proven politically popular.

of economic efficiency. Those firms that can reduce pollution at a low cost will sell 
whatever permits they get, and firms that can reduce pollution only at a high cost 
will buy whatever permits they need. As long as there is a free market for the pol-
lution rights, the final allocation will be efficient regardless of the initial allocation.
Reducing pollution using pollution permits may seem very different from us-
ing corrective taxes, but the two policies have much in common. In both cases, 
firms pay for their pollution. With corrective taxes, polluting firms must pay a 
tax to the government. With pollution permits, polluting firms must pay to buy 
the permit. (Even firms that already own permits must pay to pollute: The oppor-
tunity cost of polluting is what they could have received by selling their permits 
on the open market.) Both corrective taxes and pollution permits internalize the 
externality of pollution by making it costly for firms to pollute.
The similarity of the two policies can be seen by considering the market for pol-
lution. Both panels in Figure 4 show the demand curve for the right to pollute. This 
curve shows that the lower the price of polluting, the more firms will choose to 
pollute. In panel (a), the EPA uses a corrective tax to set a price for pollution. In this 
case, the supply curve for pollution rights is perfectly elastic (because firms can 
pollute as much as they want by paying the tax), and the position of the demand 
curve determines the quantity of pollution. In panel (b), the EPA sets a quantity of 
pollution by issuing pollution permits. In this case, the supply curve for pollution 
rights is perfectly inelastic (because the quantity of pollution is fixed by the num-
ber of permits), and the position of the demand curve determines the price of pol-
lution. Hence, the EPA can achieve any point on a given demand curve either by 
setting a price with a corrective tax or by setting a quantity with pollution permits.

In some circumstances, however, selling pollution permits may be better than 
levying a corrective tax. Suppose the EPA wants no more than 600 tons of glop 
dumped into the river. But because the EPA does not know the demand curve for 
pollution, it is not sure what size tax would achieve that goal. In this case, it can 
simply auction off 600 pollution permits. The auction price would yield the ap-
propriate size of the corrective tax.
The idea of the government auctioning off the right to pollute may at first 
sound like a creature of some economist’s imagination. And in fact, that is how 
the idea began. But increasingly, the EPA has used the system as a way to control 
pollution. A notable success story has been the case of sulfur dioxide (SO2), a lead-
ing cause of acid rain. In 1990, amendments to the Clean Air Act required power 
plants to reduce SO2 emissions substantially. At the same time, the amendments 
set up a system that allowed plants to trade their SO2 allowances. Initially, both 
industry representatives and environmentalists were skeptical of the proposal, 
but over time the system has reduced pollution with minimal disruption. Pollu-
tion permits, like corrective taxes, are now widely viewed as a cost-effective way 
to keep the environment clean.
10-2d Objections to the Economic Analysis 
of Pollution
“We cannot give anyone the option of polluting for a fee.” This comment by the 
late Senator Edmund Muskie reflects the view of some environmentalists. Clean 
air and clean water, they argue, are fundamental human rights that should not 
be debased by considering them in economic terms. How can you put a price on 
clean air and clean water? The environment is so important, they claim, that we 
should protect it as much as possible, regardless of the cost.
Economists have little sympathy for this type of argument. To economists, 
good environmental policy begins by acknowledging the first of the Ten Principles 
of Economics in Chapter 1: People face trade-offs. Certainly, clean air and clean wa-
ter have value. But their value must be compared to their opportunity cost—that 
is, to what one must give up to obtain them. Eliminating all pollution is impos-
sible. Trying to eliminate all pollution would reverse many of the technological 
advances that allow us to enjoy a high standard of living. Few people would be 
willing to accept poor nutrition, inadequate medical care, or shoddy housing to 
make the environment as clean as possible.
Economists argue that some environmental activists hurt their own cause by 
not thinking in economic terms. A clean environment can be viewed as simply 
another good. Like all normal goods, it has a positive income elasticity: Rich 
countries can afford a cleaner environment than poor ones and, therefore, usu-
ally have more rigorous environmental protection. In addition, like most other 
goods, clean air and clean water obey the law of demand: The lower the price 
of environmental protection, the more the public will want. The economic ap-
proach of using pollution permits and corrective taxes reduces the cost of envi-
ronmental protection and should, therefore, increase the public’s demand for a 
clean environment.

THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
The Most Sensible Tax 
of All
By Yoram Bauman and Shi-Ling Hsu
O
n Sunday, the best climate policy in the 
world got even better: British Columbia’s 
carbon tax—a tax on the carbon content of all 
fossil fuels burned in the province—­increased 
from $25 to $30 per metric ton of carbon diox-
ide, making it more expensive to pollute. 
This was good news not only for the en-
vironment but for nearly everyone who pays 
taxes in British Columbia, because the carbon 
tax is used to reduce taxes for individuals and 
businesses. Thanks to this tax swap, British 
Columbia has lowered its corporate income 
tax rate to 10 percent from 12 percent, a rate 
that is among the lowest in the Group of 8 
wealthy nations. Personal income taxes for 
people earning less than $119,000 per year 
are now the lowest in Canada, and there are 
targeted rebates for low-income and rural 
households. 
The only bad news is that this is the last 
increase scheduled in British Columbia. In 
our view, the reason is simple: the province is 
waiting for the rest of North America to catch 
up so that its tax system will not become un-
balanced or put energy-intensive industries 
at a competitive disadvantage. 
The United States should jump at the 
chance to adopt a similar revenue-neutral tax 
swap. It’s an opportunity to reduce existing 
taxes, clean up the environment and increase 
personal freedom and energy security. 
Let’s start with the economics. ­Substituting 
a carbon tax for some of our current taxes—on 
payroll, on investment, on businesses and 
on workers—is a no-brainer. Why tax good 
things when you can tax bad things, like emis-
sions? The idea has support from economists 
across the political spectrum, from Arthur B. 
Laffer and N. Gregory Mankiw on the right to 
­Peter Orszag and Joseph E. Stiglitz on the left. 
That’s because economists know that a carbon 
tax swap can reduce the economic drag cre-
ated by our current tax system and increase

10-3 Private Solutions to Externalities
Although externalities tend to cause markets to be inefficient, government action 
is not always needed to solve the problem. In some circumstances, people can 
develop private solutions.
10-3a The Types of Private Solutions
Sometimes the problem of externalities is solved with moral codes and social sanc-
tions. Consider, for instance, why most people do not litter. Although there are 
laws against littering, these laws are not vigorously enforced. Most people choose 
not to litter just because it is the wrong thing to do. The Golden Rule taught to 
most children says, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” This 
moral injunction tells us to take account of how our actions affect other people. In 
economic terms, it tells us to internalize externalities.
Another private solution to externalities involves charities. For example, the 
Sierra Club, whose goal is to protect the environment, is a nonprofit organiza-
tion funded with private donations. As another example, colleges and universities 
receive gifts from alumni, corporations, and foundations in part because educa-
tion has positive externalities for society. The government encourages this private 
solution to externalities through the tax system by allowing an income tax deduc-
tion for charitable donations.
The private market can often solve the problem of externalities by relying on 
the self-interest of the relevant parties. Sometimes the solution takes the form of

long-run growth by nudging the economy away 
from consumption and borrowing and toward 
saving and investment. 
Of course, carbon taxes also lower carbon 
emissions. Economic theory suggests that put-
ting a price on pollution reduces emissions 
more affordably and more effectively than any 
other measure. This conclusion is supported by 
empirical evidence from previous market-based 
policies, like those in the 1990 amendments to 
the Clean Air Act that targeted sulfur dioxide 
emissions. British Columbia’s carbon tax is only 
four years old, but preliminary data show that 
greenhouse gas emissions are down 4.5 percent 
even as population and gross domestic product 
have been growing. Sales of motor gasoline have 
fallen by 2 percent since 2007, compared with a 
5 percent increase for Canada as a whole. 
What would a British Columbia-style 
carbon tax look like in the United States? 
According to our calculations, a British 
­Columbia-style $30 carbon tax would gener-
ate about $145 billion a year in the United 
States. That could be used to reduce individual 
and corporate income taxes by 10 percent, 
and afterward there would still be $35 billion 
left over. If recent budget deals are any guide, 
­Congress might choose to set aside half of that 
remainder to reduce estate taxes (to please 
Republicans) and the other half to offset the 
impacts of higher fuel and electricity prices 
resulting from the carbon tax on low-income 
households through refundable tax credits or 
a targeted reduction in payroll taxes (to please 
Democrats). 
Revenue from a carbon tax would most 
likely decline over time as Americans reduce 
their carbon emissions, but for many years to 
come it could pay for big reductions in existing 
taxes. It would also promote energy conserva-
tion and steer investment into clean technol-
ogy and other productive economic activities. 
Lastly, the carbon tax would actu-
ally give Americans more control over how 
much they pay in taxes. Households and 
businesses could reduce their carbon tax 
payments simply by reducing their use of fos-
sil fuels. ­Americans would trim their carbon 
­footprints—and their tax burdens—by in-
vesting in energy efficiency at home and at 
work, switching to less-polluting vehicles and 
pursuing countless other innovations. All of 
this would be driven not by government man-
dates but by Adam Smith’s invisible hand. 
A carbon tax makes sense whether you 
are a Republican or a Democrat, a climate 
change skeptic or a believer, a conservative or 
a conservationist (or both). We can move past 
the partisan fireworks over global warming by 
turning British Columbia’s carbon tax into a 
made-in-America solution.

integrating different types of businesses. For example, consider an apple grower 
and a beekeeper who are located next to each other. Each business confers a posi-
tive externality on the other: By pollinating the flowers on the trees, the bees help 
the orchard produce apples. At the same time, the bees use the nectar they get 
from the apple trees to produce honey. Nonetheless, when the apple grower is de-
ciding how many trees to plant and the beekeeper is deciding how many bees to 
keep, they neglect the positive externality. As a result, the apple grower plants too 
few trees and the beekeeper keeps too few bees. These externalities could be inter-
nalized if the beekeeper bought the apple orchard or if the apple grower bought 
the beehives: Both activities would then take place within the same firm, and this 
single firm could choose the optimal number of trees and bees. Internalizing exter-
nalities is one reason that some firms are involved in multiple types of businesses.
Another way for the private market to deal with external effects is for the inter-
ested parties to enter into a contract. In the foregoing example, a contract between 
the apple grower and the beekeeper can solve the problem of too few trees and 
too few bees. The contract can specify the number of trees, the number of bees, 
and perhaps a payment from one party to the other. By setting the right number 
of trees and bees, the contract can solve the inefficiency that normally arises from 
these externalities and make both parties better off.
10-3b The Coase Theorem
How effective is the private market in dealing with externalities? A famous result, 
called the Coase theorem after economist Ronald Coase, suggests that it can be 
very effective in some circumstances. According to the Coase theorem, if private

parties can bargain over the allocation of resources at no cost, then the private 
market will always solve the problem of externalities and allocate resources 
efficiently.
To see how the Coase theorem works, consider an example. Suppose that Dick 
owns a dog named Spot. Spot barks and disturbs Jane, Dick’s neighbor. Dick gets 
a benefit from owning the dog, but the dog confers a negative externality on Jane. 
Should Dick be forced to send Spot to the pound, or should Jane have to suffer 
sleepless nights because of Spot’s barking?
Consider first what outcome is socially efficient. A social planner, considering 
the two alternatives, would compare the benefit that Dick gets from the dog to the 
cost that Jane bears from the barking. If the benefit exceeds the cost, it is efficient 
for Dick to keep the dog and for Jane to live with the barking. Yet if the cost ex-
ceeds the benefit, then Dick should get rid of the dog.
According to the Coase theorem, the private market will reach the efficient out-
come on its own. How? Jane can simply offer to pay Dick to get rid of the dog. 
Dick will accept the deal if the amount of money Jane offers is greater than the 
benefit of keeping the dog.
By bargaining over the price, Dick and Jane can always reach the efficient out-
come. For instance, suppose that Dick gets a $500 benefit from the dog and Jane 
bears an $800 cost from the barking. In this case, Jane can offer Dick $600 to get rid 
of the dog, and Dick will gladly accept. Both parties are better off than they were 
before, and the efficient outcome is reached.
It is possible, of course, that Jane would not be willing to offer any price that 
Dick would accept. For instance, suppose that Dick gets a $1,000 benefit from the 
dog and Jane bears an $800 cost from the barking. In this case, Dick would turn 
down any offer below $1,000, while Jane would not offer any amount above $800. 
Therefore, Dick ends up keeping the dog. Given these costs and benefits, how-
ever, this outcome is efficient.
So far, we have assumed that Dick has the legal right to keep a barking dog. 
In other words, we have assumed that Dick can keep Spot unless Jane pays him 
enough to induce him to give up the dog voluntarily. But how different would the 
outcome be if Jane had the legal right to peace and quiet?
According to the Coase theorem, the initial distribution of rights does not mat-
ter for the market’s ability to reach the efficient outcome. For instance, suppose 
that Jane can legally compel Dick to get rid of the dog. Having this right works to 
Jane’s advantage, but it probably will not change the outcome. In this case, Dick 
can offer to pay Jane to allow him to keep the dog. If the benefit of the dog to Dick 
exceeds the cost of the barking to Jane, then Dick and Jane will strike a bargain in 
which Dick keeps the dog.
Although Dick and Jane can reach the efficient outcome regardless of how 
rights are initially distributed, the distribution of rights is not irrelevant: It de-
termines the distribution of economic well-being. Whether Dick has the right to 
a barking dog or Jane the right to peace and quiet determines who pays whom in 
the final bargain. But in either case, the two parties can bargain with each other 
and solve the externality problem. Dick will end up keeping the dog only if his 
benefit exceeds Jane’s cost.
To sum up: The Coase theorem says that private economic actors can potentially solve 
the problem of externalities among themselves. Whatever the initial distribution of rights, 
the interested parties can reach a bargain in which everyone is better off and the outcome 
is efficient.

10-3c Why Private Solutions Do Not Always Work
Despite the appealing logic of the Coase theorem, private individuals on their 
own often fail to resolve the problems caused by externalities. The Coase theorem 
applies only when the interested parties have no trouble reaching and enforcing 
an agreement. In the real world, however, bargaining does not always work, even 
when a mutually beneficial agreement is possible.
Sometimes the interested parties fail to solve an externality problem because 
of transaction costs, the costs that parties incur in the process of agreeing to and 
following through on a bargain. In our example, imagine that Dick and Jane speak 
different languages so that, to reach an agreement, they need to hire a translator. 
If the benefit of solving the barking problem is less than the cost of the transla-
tor, Dick and Jane might choose to leave the problem unsolved. In more realistic 
examples, the transaction costs are the expenses not of translators but of lawyers 
required to draft and enforce contracts.
At other times, bargaining simply breaks down. The recurrence of wars and 
­labor strikes shows that reaching agreement can be difficult and that failing to 
reach agreement can be costly. The problem is often that each party tries to hold 
out for a better deal. For example, suppose that Dick gets a $500 benefit from hav-
ing the dog and Jane bears an $800 cost from the barking. Although it is efficient for 
Jane to pay Dick to find another home for the dog, there are many prices that could 
lead to this outcome. Dick might demand $750, and Jane might offer only $550. As 
they haggle over the price, the inefficient outcome with the barking dog persists.
Reaching an efficient bargain is especially difficult when the number of inter-
ested parties is large, because coordinating everyone is costly. For example, con-
sider a factory that pollutes the water of a nearby lake. The pollution confers a 
negative externality on the local fishermen. According to the Coase theorem, if the 
pollution is inefficient, then the factory and the fishermen could reach a bargain 
in which the fishermen pay the factory not to pollute. If there are many fishermen, 
however, trying to coordinate them all to bargain with the factory may be almost 
impossible.
When private bargaining does not work, the government can sometimes play 
a role. The government is an institution designed for collective action. In this 
­example, the government can act on behalf of the fishermen, even when it is 
­impractical for the fishermen to act for themselves.

10-4 Conclusion
The invisible hand is powerful but not omnipotent. A market’s equilibrium maxi-
mizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. When the buyers and sellers 
in the market are the only interested parties, this outcome is efficient from the 
standpoint of society as a whole. But when there are external effects, such as pol-
lution, evaluating a market outcome requires taking into account the well-being 
of third parties as well. In this case, the invisible hand of the marketplace may fail 
to ­allocate resources efficiently.

PART IV	
THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
In some cases, people can solve the problem of externalities on their own. The 
Coase theorem suggests that the interested parties can bargain among themselves 
and agree on an efficient solution. Sometimes, however, an efficient outcome can-
not be reached, perhaps because the large number of interested parties makes bar-
gaining difficult.
When people cannot solve the problem of externalities privately, the govern-
ment often steps in. Yet even with government intervention, society should not 
abandon market forces entirely. Rather, the government can address the problem 
by requiring decision makers to bear the full costs of their actions. Pollution per-
mits and corrective taxes on emissions, for instance, are designed to internalize the 
externality of pollution. More and more, these are the policies of choice for those 
interested in protecting the environment. Market forces, properly redirected, are 
often the best remedy for market failure.
•	
When a transaction between a buyer and seller directly 
affects a third party, the effect is called an externality. 
If an activity yields negative externalities, such as pol-
lution, the socially optimal quantity in a market is less 
than the equilibrium quantity. If an activity yields posi-
tive externalities, such as technology spillovers, the so-
cially optimal quantity is greater than the equilibrium 
quantity.
•	
Governments pursue various policies to remedy the 
inefficiencies caused by externalities. Sometimes the 
government prevents socially inefficient activity by 
regulating behavior. Other times it internalizes an 
­externality using corrective taxes. Another public policy 
is to issue permits. For example, the government could 
protect the environment by issuing a limited number of 
pollution permits. The result of this policy is largely the 
same as imposing corrective taxes on polluters.
•	
Those affected by externalities can sometimes solve 
the problem privately. For instance, when one business 
imposes an externality on another business, the two 
businesses can internalize the externality by merging. 
Alternatively, the interested parties can solve the prob-
lem by negotiating a contract. According to the Coase 
theorem, if people can bargain without cost, then they 
can always reach an agreement in which resources are 
allocated efficiently. In many cases, however, reaching 
a bargain among the many interested parties is diffi-
cult, so the Coase theorem does not apply.

Club (a steering wheel lock) makes it difficult for a car 
thief to take your car. Lojack (a tracking system) makes 
it easier for the police to catch the car thief who has 
stolen it. Which of these types of protection conveys a

  2.	 Consider the market for fire extinguishers.
a.	 Why might fire extinguishers exhibit positive 
externalities?
b.	 Draw a graph of the market for fire extinguishers, 
labeling the demand curve, the social-value curve, 
the supply curve, and the social-cost curve.
c.	 Indicate the market equilibrium level of output and 
the efficient level of output. Give an intuitive expla-
nation for why these quantities differ. 
d.	 If the external benefit is $10 per extinguisher,

  3.	 A local drama company proposes a new neighbor-
hood theater in San Francisco. Before approving the 
building permit, the city planner completes a study of 
the theater’s impact on the surrounding community.
a.	 One finding of the study is that theaters attract traf-
fic, which adversely affects the community. The city 
planner estimates that the cost to the community 
from the extra traffic is $5 per ticket. What kind of 
an externality is this? Why?
b.	 Graph the market for theater tickets, labeling the 
demand curve, the social-value curve, the supply 
curve, the social-cost curve, the market equilibrium 
level of output, and the efficient level of output. 
Also show the per-unit amount of the externality.
c.	 Upon further review, the city planner uncovers a 
second externality. Rehearsals for the plays tend to 
run until late at night, with actors, stagehands, and 
other theater members coming and going at various 
hours. The planner has found that the increased 
foot traffic improves the safety of the surrounding 
streets, an estimated benefit to the community of $2 
per ticket. What kind of externality is this? Why?
d.	 On a new graph, illustrate the market for the-
ater tickets in the case of these two externalities. 
Again, label the demand curve, the social-value 
curve, the supply curve, the social-cost curve, the 
market equilibrium level of output, the efficient 
level of output, and the per-unit amount of both 
externalities.

Public Goods 
and Common 
Resources
A
n old song lyric maintains that “the best things in life are free.” A moment’s 
thought reveals a long list of goods that the songwriter could have had in 
mind. Nature provides some of them, such as rivers, mountains, beaches, 
lakes, and oceans. The government provides others, such as playgrounds, parks, 
and parades. In each case, people do not pay a fee when they choose to enjoy the 
benefit of the good.
Goods without prices provide a special challenge for economic analysis. Most 
goods in our economy are allocated in markets, in which buyers pay for what they 
receive and sellers are paid for what they provide. For these goods, prices 
are the signals that guide the decisions of buyers and sellers, and these deci-
sions lead to an efficient allocation of resources. When goods are available 
free of charge, however, the market forces that normally allocate resources 
in our economy are absent.

The Economics of the Public Sector
In this chapter, we examine the problems that arise for the allocation of 
­resources when there are goods without market prices. Our analysis will shed 
light on one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: Governments can some-
times improve market outcomes. When a good does not have a price attached 
to it, private markets cannot ensure that the good is produced and consumed in 
the proper amounts. In such cases, government policy can potentially remedy the 
market failure and increase economic well-being.

11-1 The Different Kinds of Goods
How well do markets work in providing the goods that people want? The ­answer 
to this question depends on the good being considered. As we discussed in 
­Chapter 7, a market can provide the efficient number of ice-cream cones: The price 
of ice-cream cones adjusts to balance supply and demand, and this equilibrium 
maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. Yet as we discussed in 
Chapter 10, the market cannot be counted on to prevent aluminum manufacturers 
from polluting the air we breathe: Buyers and sellers in a market typically do not 
take into account the external effects of their decisions. Thus, markets work well 
when the good is ice cream, but they work badly when the good is clean air.
In thinking about the various goods in the economy, it is useful to group them 
according to two characteristics:
•	 Is the good excludable? That is, can people be prevented from using the good?
•	 Is the good rival in consumption? That is, does one person’s use of the good 
reduce another person’s ability to use it?
Using these two characteristics, Figure 1 divides goods into four categories:
1.	 Private goods are both excludable and rival in consumption. Consider an 
ice-cream cone, for example. An ice-cream cone is excludable because it is 
possible to prevent someone from eating one—you just don’t give it to her. 
An ice-cream cone is rival in consumption because if one person eats an 
ice-cream cone, another person cannot eat the same cone. Most goods in the 
economy are private goods like ice-cream cones: You don’t get one unless 
you pay for it, and once you have it, you are the only person who benefits. 
When we analyzed supply and demand in Chapters 4–6 and the ­efficiency 
of markets in Chapters 7–9, we implicitly assumed that goods were both 
excludable and rival in consumption.
2.	 Public goods are neither excludable nor rival in consumption. That is, people 
cannot be prevented from using a public good, and one person’s use of a 
public good does not reduce another person’s ability to use it. For example, 
a tornado siren in a small town is a public good. Once the siren sounds, it is 
impossible to prevent any single person from hearing it (so it is not exclud-
able). Moreover, when one person gets the benefit of the warning, she does 
not reduce the benefit to anyone else (so it is not rival in consumption).
3.	 Common resources are rival in consumption but not excludable. For ex-
ample, fish in the ocean are rival in consumption: When one person catches 
fish, there are fewer fish for the next person to catch. Yet these fish are not an 
excludable good because, given the vast size of an ocean, it is difficult to stop 
fishermen from taking fish out of it.

CHAPTER 11  PUBLIC GOODS AND COMMON RESOURCES
217
4.	 Club goods are excludable but not rival in consumption. For instance, 
­consider fire protection in a small town. It is easy to exclude someone from 
using this good: The fire department can just let her house burn down. Yet 
fire protection is not rival in consumption: Once a town has paid for the 
fire department, the additional cost of protecting one more house is small. 
(We discuss club goods again in Chapter 15, where we see that they are one 
type of a natural monopoly.)
Although Figure 1 offers a clean separation of goods into four categories, 
the boundaries between the categories are sometimes fuzzy. Whether goods 
are excludable or rival in consumption is often a matter of degree. Fish in an 
ocean may not be excludable because monitoring fishing is so difficult, but a 
large enough coast guard could make fish at least partly excludable. Similarly, 
although fish are generally rival in consumption, this would be less true if the 
population of fishermen were small relative to the population of fish. (Think 
of North American fishing waters before the arrival of European settlers.) For 
­purposes of our analysis, however, it will be helpful to group goods into these 
four categories.
In this chapter, we examine goods that are not excludable: public goods and 
common resources. Because people cannot be prevented from using these goods, 
they are available to everyone free of charge. The study of public goods and com-
mon resources is closely related to the study of externalities. For both of these 
types of goods, externalities arise because something of value has no price 
­attached to it. If one person were to provide a public good, such as a tornado 
siren, other people would be better off. They would receive a benefit without 
paying for it—a positive externality. Similarly, when one person uses a common 
­resource such as the fish in the ocean, other people are worse off because there are 
fewer fish to catch. They suffer a loss but are not compensated for it—a negative 
externality. Because of these external effects, private decisions about consumption 
and production can lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, and government 
­intervention can potentially raise economic well-being.

good diminishes other people’s

category.

The Economics of the Public Sector
11-2 Public Goods
To understand how public goods differ from other goods and why they present 
problems for society, let’s consider an example: a fireworks display. This good is 
not excludable because it is impossible to prevent someone from seeing fireworks, 
and it is not rival in consumption because one person’s enjoyment of fireworks 
does not reduce anyone else’s enjoyment of them.
11-2a The Free-Rider Problem
The citizens of Smalltown, U.S.A., like seeing fireworks on the Fourth of July. Each 
of the town’s 500 residents places a $10 value on the experience for a total benefit 
of $5,000. The cost of putting on a fireworks display is $1,000. Because the $5,000 
benefit exceeds the $1,000 cost, it is efficient for Smalltown to have a fireworks 
display on the Fourth of July.
Would the private market produce the efficient outcome? Probably not. Imag-
ine that Ellen, a Smalltown entrepreneur, decided to put on a fireworks display. 
Ellen would surely have trouble selling tickets to the event because her potential 
customers would quickly figure out that they could see the fireworks even with-
out a ticket. Because fireworks are not excludable, people have an incentive to be 
free riders. A free rider is a person who receives the benefit of a good but does not 
pay for it. Because people would have an incentive to be free riders rather than 
ticket buyers, the market would fail to provide the efficient outcome.
One way to view this market failure is that it arises because of an externality. If 
Ellen puts on the fireworks display, she confers an external benefit on those who 
see the display without paying for it. When deciding whether to put on the dis-
play, however, Ellen does not take the external benefits into account. Even though 
the fireworks display is socially desirable, it is not profitable. As a result, Ellen 
makes the privately rational but socially inefficient decision not to put on the 
display.
Although the private market fails to supply the fireworks display demanded 
by Smalltown residents, the solution to Smalltown’s problem is obvious: The lo-
cal government can sponsor a Fourth of July celebration. The town council can 
raise everyone’s taxes by $2 and use the revenue to hire Ellen to produce the 
fireworks. Everyone in Smalltown is better off by $8—the $10 at which residents 
value the fireworks minus the $2 tax bill. Ellen can help Smalltown reach the ef-
ficient outcome as a public employee even though she could not do so as a private 
entrepreneur.
The story of Smalltown is simplified but realistic. In fact, many local govern-
ments in the United States pay for fireworks on the Fourth of July. Moreover, the 
story shows a general lesson about public goods: Because public goods are not 
excludable, the free-rider problem prevents the private market from supplying 
them. The government, however, can potentially remedy the problem. If the gov-
ernment decides that the total benefits of a public good exceed its costs, it can pro-
vide the public good, pay for it with tax revenue, and make everyone better off.
11-2b Some Important Public Goods
There are many examples of public goods. Here we consider three of the most 
important.

National Defense  The defense of a country from foreign aggressors is a ­classic 
example of a public good. Once the country is defended, it is impossible to 
prevent any single person from enjoying the benefit of this defense. Moreover, 
when one person enjoys the benefit of national defense, she does not reduce the 
benefit to anyone else. Thus, national defense is neither excludable nor rival in 
­consumption.
National defense is also one of the most expensive public goods. In 2011, 
the U.S. federal government spent a total of $717 billion on national defense, 
more than $2,298 per person. People disagree about whether this amount is too 
small or too large, but almost no one doubts that some government spending 
for ­national defense is necessary. Even economists who advocate small govern-
ment agree that the national defense is a public good the government should 
provide.
Basic Research  Knowledge is created through research. In evaluating the 
­appropriate public policy toward knowledge creation, it is important to distin-
guish general knowledge from specific technological knowledge. Specific tech-
nological knowledge, such as the invention of a longer-lasting battery, a smaller 
microchip, or a better digital music player, can be patented. The patent gives the 
inventor the exclusive right to the knowledge she has created for a period of time. 
Anyone else who wants to use the patented information must pay the inventor for 
the right to do so. In other words, the patent makes the knowledge created by the 
inventor excludable.

By contrast, general knowledge is a public good. For example, a mathematician 
cannot patent a theorem. Once a theorem is proven, the knowledge is not exclud-
able: The theorem enters society’s general pool of knowledge that anyone can use 
without charge. The theorem is also not rival in consumption: One person’s use of 
the theorem does not prevent any other person from using the theorem.
Profit-seeking firms spend a lot on research trying to develop new products 
that they can patent and sell, but they do not spend much on basic research. Their 
incentive, instead, is to free ride on the general knowledge created by others. As a 
result, in the absence of any public policy, society would devote too few resources 
to creating new knowledge.
The government tries to provide the public good of general knowledge in vari-
ous ways. Government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health and 
the National Science Foundation, subsidize basic research in medicine, mathemat-
ics, physics, chemistry, biology, and even economics. Some people justify gov-
ernment funding of the space program on the grounds that it adds to society’s 
pool of knowledge. Determining the appropriate level of government support for 
these endeavors is difficult because the benefits are hard to measure. Moreover, 
the members of Congress who appropriate funds for research usually have little 
expertise in science and, therefore, are not in the best position to judge what lines 
of research will produce the largest benefits. So, while basic research is surely a 
public good, we should not be surprised if the public sector fails to pay for the 
right amount and the right kinds.
Fighting Poverty  Many government programs are aimed at helping the poor. 
The welfare system (officially called TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families) provides a small income for some poor families. Food stamps (officially 
called SNAP, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) subsidize the purchase 
of food for those with low incomes. And various government housing programs 
make shelter more affordable. These antipoverty programs are financed by taxes 
paid by families that are financially more successful.
Economists disagree among themselves about what role the government 
should play in fighting poverty. We discuss this debate more fully in Chapter 20, 
but here we note one important argument: Advocates of antipoverty programs 
claim that fighting poverty is a public good. Even if everyone prefers living in a 
society without poverty, fighting poverty is not a “good” that private actions will 
adequately provide.
To see why, suppose someone tried to organize a group of wealthy individuals 
to try to eliminate poverty. They would be providing a public good. This good 
would not be rival in consumption: One person’s enjoyment of living in a society 
without poverty would not reduce anyone else’s enjoyment of it. The good would 
not be excludable: Once poverty is eliminated, no one can be prevented from tak-
ing pleasure in this fact. As a result, there would be a tendency for people to free 
ride on the generosity of others, enjoying the benefits of poverty elimination with-
out contributing to the cause.
Because of the free-rider problem, eliminating poverty through private charity 
will probably not work. Yet government action can solve this problem. Taxing the 
wealthy to raise the living standards of the poor can potentially make everyone 
better off. The poor are better off because they now enjoy a higher standard of liv-
ing, and those paying the taxes are better off because they enjoy living in a society 
with less poverty.

Are Lighthouses Public Goods?
Some goods can switch between being public goods and being pri-
vate goods depending on the circumstances. For example, a fireworks 
display is a public good if performed in a town with many residents. Yet 
if performed at a private amusement park, such as Walt Disney World, a fire-
works display is more like a private good because visitors to the park pay for 
admission.
Another example is a lighthouse. Economists have long used lighthouses as an 
example of a public good. Lighthouses mark specific locations along the coast so 
that passing ships can avoid treacherous waters. The benefit that the lighthouse 
provides to the ship captain is neither excludable nor rival in consumption, so 
each captain has an incentive to free ride by using the lighthouse to navigate 
without paying for the service. Because of this free-rider problem, private markets 
usually fail to provide the lighthouses that ship captains need. As a result, most 
lighthouses today are operated by the government.
In some cases, however, lighthouses have been closer to private goods. On 
the coast of England in the 19th century, for example, some lighthouses were 
privately owned and operated. Instead of trying to charge ship captains for the 
­service, however, the owner of the lighthouse charged the owner of the nearby 
port. If the port owner did not pay, the lighthouse owner turned off the light, and 
ships avoided that port.
In deciding whether something is a public good, one must determine who the 
beneficiaries are and whether these beneficiaries can be excluded from using the 
good. A free-rider problem arises when the number of beneficiaries is large and 
exclusion of any one of them is impossible. If a lighthouse benefits many ship cap-
tains, it is a public good. Yet if it primarily benefits a single port owner, it is more 
like a private good.

11-2c The Difficult Job of Cost–Benefit Analysis
So far we have seen that the government provides public goods because the pri-
vate market on its own will not produce an efficient quantity. Yet deciding that 
the government must play a role is only the first step. The government must then 
determine what kinds of public goods to provide and in what quantities.
Suppose that the government is considering a public project, such as building 
a new highway. To judge whether to build the highway, it must compare the total 
benefits of all those who would use it to the costs of building and maintaining it. 
To make this decision, the government might hire a team of economists and engi-
neers to conduct a study, called a cost–benefit analysis, to estimate the total costs 
and benefits of the project to society as a whole.
Cost–benefit analysts have a tough job. Because the highway will be available 
to everyone free of charge, there is no price with which to judge the value of the 
highway. Simply asking people how much they would value the highway is not 
reliable: Quantifying benefits is difficult using the results from a questionnaire, 
and respondents have little incentive to tell the truth. Those who would use the 
highway have an incentive to exaggerate the benefit they receive to get the high-
way built. Those who would be harmed by the highway have an incentive to ex-
aggerate the costs to them to prevent the highway from being built.
The efficient provision of public goods is, therefore, intrinsically more difficult 
than the efficient provision of private goods. When buyers of a private good enter

How Much Is a Life Worth?
Imagine that you have been elected to serve as a member of your lo-
cal town council. The town engineer comes to you with a proposal: The 
town can spend $10,000 to build and operate a traffic light at a town in-
tersection that now has only a stop sign. The benefit of the traffic light is in-
creased safety. The engineer estimates, based on data from similar intersections, 
that the traffic light would reduce the risk of a fatal traffic accident over the life-
time of the traffic light from 1.6 to 1.1 percent. Should you spend the money for 
the new light?
To answer this question, you turn to cost–benefit analysis. But you quickly 
run into an obstacle: The costs and benefits must be measured in the same units 
if you are to compare them meaningfully. The cost is measured in dollars, but 
the ­benefit—the possibility of saving a person’s life—is not directly monetary. To 
make your decision, you have to put a dollar value on a human life.
At first, you may be tempted to conclude that a human life is priceless. After 
all, there is probably no amount of money that you could be paid to voluntarily 
give up your life or that of a loved one. This suggests that a human life has an 
infinite dollar value.
For the purposes of cost–benefit analysis, however, this answer leads to 
nonsensical results. If we truly placed an infinite value on human life, we 
should place traffic lights on every street corner, and we should all drive large 
cars loaded with all the latest safety features. Yet traffic lights are not at ev-
ery corner, and people sometimes choose to pay less for smaller cars without 
safety options such as side-impact air bags or antilock brakes. In both our 
public and private decisions, we are at times willing to risk our lives to save 
some money.
Once we have accepted the idea that a person’s life has an implicit dollar value, 
how can we determine what that value is? One approach, sometimes used by 
courts to award damages in wrongful-death suits, is to look at the total amount of 
money a person would have earned if she had lived. Economists are often critical 
of this approach because it ignores other opportunity costs of losing one’s life.  
It thus has the bizarre implication that the life of a retired or disabled person has 
no value.
A better way to value human life is to look at the risks that people are volun-
tarily willing to take and how much they must be paid for taking them. Mortality 
risk varies across jobs, for example. Construction workers in high-rise buildings 
face greater risk of death on the job than office workers do. By comparing wages 
in risky and less risky occupations, controlling for education, experience, and 
other determinants of wages, economists can get some sense about what value 
people put on their own lives. Studies using this approach conclude that the value 
of a human life is about $10 million.

a market, they reveal the value they place on it through the prices they are will-
ing to pay. At the same time, sellers reveal their costs with the prices they are 
willing to accept. The equilibrium is an efficient allocation of resources because 
it reflects all this information. By contrast, cost–benefit analysts do not have any 
price signals to observe when evaluating whether the government should provide 
a public good and how much to provide. Their findings on the costs and benefits 
of public projects are rough approximations at best.

CHAPTER 11  PUBLIC GOODS AND COMMON RESOURCES
223
Common resources, like public goods, are not excludable: They are available free 
of charge to anyone who wants to use them. Common resources are, however, 
­rival in consumption: One person’s use of the common resource reduces other 
people’s ability to use it. Thus, common resources give rise to a new problem. 
Once the good is provided, policymakers need to be concerned about how much 
it is used. This problem is best understood from the classic parable called the 
Tragedy of the Commons.
11-3a The Tragedy of the Commons
Consider life in a small medieval town. Of the many economic activities that take 
place in the town, one of the most important is raising sheep. Many of the town’s 
families own flocks of sheep and support themselves by selling the sheep’s wool, 
which is used to make clothing.
As our story begins, the sheep spend much of their time grazing on the land 
surrounding the town, called the Town Common. No family owns the land. 
­Instead, the town residents own the land collectively, and all the residents are 
­allowed to graze their sheep on it. Collective ownership works well because land 
is plentiful. As long as everyone can get all the good grazing land they want, the 
Town Common is not rival in consumption, and allowing residents’ sheep to 
graze for free causes no problems. Everyone in the town is happy.
As the years pass, the population of the town grows, and so does the num-
ber of sheep grazing on the Town Common. With a growing number of sheep 
and a fixed amount of land, the land starts to lose its ability to replenish itself. 
­Eventually, the land is grazed so heavily that it becomes barren. With no grass left 
on the Town Common, raising sheep is impossible, and the town’s once prosper-
ous wool industry disappears. Many families lose their source of livelihood.
What causes the tragedy? Why do the shepherds allow the sheep population 
to grow so large that it destroys the Town Common? The reason is that social and 
private incentives differ. Avoiding the destruction of the grazing land depends on 
the collective action of the shepherds. If the shepherds acted together, they could 
reduce the sheep population to a size that the Town Common can support. Yet 
no single family has an incentive to reduce the size of its own flock because each 
flock represents only a small part of the problem.
In essence, the Tragedy of the Commons arises because of an externality. When 
one family’s flock grazes on the common land, it reduces the quality of the land 
available for other families. Because people neglect this negative externality when 
deciding how many sheep to own, the result is an excessive number of sheep.

We can now return to our original example and respond to the town engineer. 
The traffic light reduces the risk of fatality by 0.5 percentage points. Thus, the 
expected benefit from installing the traffic light is 0.005 × $10 million, or $50,000. 
This estimate of the benefit well exceeds the cost of $10,000, so you should 
­approve the project.

The Economics of the Public Sector
If the tragedy had been foreseen, the town could have solved the problem in 
various ways. It could have regulated the number of sheep in each family’s flock, 
internalized the externality by taxing sheep, or auctioned off a limited number of 
sheep-grazing permits. That is, the medieval town could have dealt with the problem 
of overgrazing in the way that modern society deals with the problem of pollution.
In the case of land, however, there is a simpler solution. The town can divide 
the land among town families. Each family can enclose its parcel of land with a 
fence and then protect it from excessive grazing. In this way, the land becomes a 
private good rather than a common resource. This outcome in fact occurred dur-
ing the enclosure movement in England in the 17th century.
The Tragedy of the Commons is a story with a general lesson: When one person 
uses a common resource, she diminishes other people’s enjoyment of it. Because 
of this negative externality, common resources tend to be used excessively. The 
Why You’ll Love Paying 
for Roads That Used to 
Be Free

T
o end the scourge of traffic congestion, 
Julius Caesar banned most carts from the 
streets of Rome during daylight hours. It didn’t 
work—traffic jams just shifted to dusk. Two 
thousand years later, we have put a man on 
the moon and developed garments infinitely 
more practical than the toga, but we seem 
little nearer to solving the congestion problem.
If you live in a city, particularly a large 
one, you probably need little convincing that 
traffic congestion is frustrating and waste-
ful. According to the Texas Transportation 
­Institute, the average American urban trav-
eler lost 38 hours, nearly one full work week, 
to congestion in 2005. And congestion is get-
ting worse, not better; urban travelers in 1982 
were delayed only 14 hours that year.
Americans want action, but unfortunately 
there aren’t too many great ideas about what 
that action might be. As Anthony Downs’s 
excellent book Still Stuck in Traffic: Coping 
With Peak-Hour Traffic Congestion chronicles, 
most of the proposed solutions are too diffi-
cult to implement, won’t work, or both.
Fortunately, there is one remedy which is 
both doable and largely guaranteed to suc-
ceed. In the space of a year or two we could 
have you zipping along the 405 or the LIE 
at the height of rush hour at a comfortable  
55 miles per hour.
There’s just one small problem with this 
silver bullet for congestion: many people 
seem to prefer the werewolf. Despite its mer-
its, this policy, which is known as “congestion 
pricing,” “value pricing,” or “variable toll-
ing,” is not an easy political sell.
For decades, economists and other trans-
portation thinkers have advocated imposing 
tolls that vary with congestion levels on road-
ways. Simply put, the more congestion, the 
higher the toll, until the congestion goes away.
To many people, this sounds like a scheme 
by mustache-twirling bureaucrats and their 
academic apologists to fleece drivers out of 
their hard-earned cash. Why should drivers 
have to pay to use roads their tax dollars have 
already paid for? Won’t the remaining free 
roads be swamped as drivers are forced off 
the tolled roads? Won’t the working-class and 
poor be the victims here, as the tolled routes 
turn into “Lexus lanes”?
And besides, adopting this policy would 
mean listening to economists, and who wants 
to do that?
There’s a real problem with this logic, 
which is that, on its own terms, it makes per-
fect sense (except for the listening to econo-
mists part). Opponents of tolls are certainly 
not stupid, and their arguments deserve seri-
ous consideration. But in the end, their con-
cerns are largely overblown, and the benefits 
of tolling swamp the potential costs.
Unfortunately, it can be hard to con-
vey this because the theory behind tolling 
is somewhat complex and counterintuitive. 
This is too bad, because variable tolling is 
an excellent public policy. Here’s why: the 
basic economic theory is that when you give 
out something valuable—in this case, road

government can solve the problem by using regulation or taxes to reduce con-
sumption of the common resource. Alternatively, the government can sometimes 
turn the common resource into a private good.
This lesson has been known for thousands of years. The ancient Greek philoso-
pher Aristotle pointed out the problem with common resources: “What is com-
mon to many is taken least care of, for all men have greater regard for what is 
their own than for what they possess in common with others.”
11-3b Some Important Common Resources
There are many examples of common resources. In almost all cases, the same 
problem arises as in the Tragedy of the Commons: Private decision makers use 
the common resource too much. Governments often regulate behavior or impose 
fees to mitigate the problem of overuse.
space—for less than its true value, short-
ages result.
Ultimately, there’s no free lunch; instead 
of paying with money, you pay with the effort 
and time needed to acquire the good. Think of 
Soviet shoppers spending their lives in end-
less queues to purchase artificially low-priced 
but exceedingly scarce goods. Then think of 
Americans who can fulfill nearly any consum-
erist fantasy quickly but at a monetary cost. 
Free but congested roads have left us shiver-
ing on the streets of Moscow.
To consider it another way, delay is an 
externality imposed by drivers on their peers. 
By driving onto a busy road and contribut-
ing to congestion, drivers slow the speeds of 
others—but they never have to pay for it, at 
least not directly. In the end, of course, every-
body pays, because as we impose congestion 
on others, others impose it on us. This degen-
erates into a game that nobody can win.
Markets work best when externalities 
are internalized: i.e., you pay for the hassle 
you inflict on others…. Using tolls to help 
internalize the congestion externality would 
somewhat reduce the number of trips made 
on the most congested roads at the peak us-
age periods; some trips would be moved to 
less congested times and routes, and others 
would be foregone entirely. This way we would 
cut down on the congestion costs we impose 
on each other.
Granted, tolls cannot fully cope with 
­accidents and other incidents, which are ma-
jor causes of delay. But pricing can largely 
eliminate chronic, recurring congestion. No 
matter how high the demand for a road, there 
is a level of toll that will keep it flowing freely.
To make tolling truly effective, the price 
must be right. Too high a price drives away 
too many cars and the road does not function 
at its capacity. Too low a price and congestion 
isn’t licked.
The best solution is to vary the tolls in real 
time based on an analysis of current traffic 
conditions. Pilot toll projects on roads (like 
the I-394 in Minnesota and the I-15 in South-
ern California) use sensors embedded in the 
pavement to monitor the number and speeds 
of vehicles on the facility.
A simple computer program then 
­determines the number of cars that should be 
allowed in. The computer then calculates the 
level of toll that will attract that number of 
cars—and no more. Prices are then updated 
every few minutes on electronic message 
signs. Hi-tech transponders and antenna 
­arrays make waiting at toll booths a thing of 
the past.
The bottom line is that speeds are kept 
high (over 45 m.p.h.) so that throughput 
is higher than when vehicles are allowed to 
crowd all at once onto roadways at rush hour, 
slowing traffic to a crawl.
To maximize efficiency, economists would 
like to price all travel, starting with the free-
ways. But given that elected officials have no 
burning desire to lose their jobs, a more realis-
tic option, for now, is to toll just some freeway 
lanes that are either new capacity or underused 
carpool lanes. The other lanes would be left 
free—and congested. Drivers will then have 
a choice: wait or pay. Granted, neither is ideal. 
But right now drivers have no choice at all.
What’s the bottom line here? The state of 
Washington recently opened congestion-priced 
lanes on its State Route 167. The peak toll in the 
first month of operation (reached on the eve-
ning of Wednesday, May 21) was $5.75. I know, 
I know, you would never pay such an exorbitant 
amount when America has taught you that free 
roads are your birthright. But that money bought 
Washington drivers a 27-minute time savings. 
Is a half hour of your time worth $6?
I think I already know the answer, and it is 
“it depends.” Most people’s value of time var-
ies widely depending on their activities on any 
given day. Late for picking the kids up from 
daycare? Paying $6 to save a half hour is an in-
credible bargain. Have to clean the house? The 
longer your trip home takes, the better. ­Tolling 
will introduce a new level of flexibility and free-
dom into your life, giving you the power to tailor 
your travel costs to fit your schedule.

The Economics of the Public Sector
Clean Air and Water  As we discussed in Chapter 10, markets do not adequately 
protect the environment. Pollution is a negative externality that can be remedied with 
regulations or with corrective taxes on polluting activities. One can view this market 
failure as an example of a common-resource problem. Clean air and clean water are 
common resources like open grazing land, and excessive pollution is like excessive 
grazing. Environmental degradation is a modern Tragedy of the ­Commons.
Congested Roads  Roads can be either public goods or common resources. 
If a road is not congested, then one person’s use does not affect anyone else’s use. 
In this case, use is not rival in consumption, and the road is a public good. Yet if 
a road is congested, then use of that road yields a negative externality. When one 
person drives on the road, it becomes more crowded, and other people must drive 
more slowly. In this case, the road is a common resource.
One way for the government to address the problem of road congestion is to 
charge drivers a toll. A toll is, in essence, a corrective tax on the externality of con-
gestion. Sometimes, as in the case of local roads, tolls are not a practical solution 
because the cost of collecting them is too high. But several major cities, including 
London and Stockholm, have found increasing tolls to be a very effective way to 
reduce congestion.
Sometimes congestion is a problem only at certain times of day. If a bridge is 
heavily traveled only during rush hour, for instance, the congestion externality 
is largest during this time. The efficient way to deal with these externalities is 
to charge higher tolls during rush hour. This toll would provide an incentive for 
drivers to alter their schedules, reducing traffic when congestion is greatest.
Another policy that responds to the problem of road congestion, discussed in 
a case study in Chapter 10, is the tax on gasoline. Gasoline is a complementary 
good to driving: An increase in the price of gasoline tends to reduce the quan-
tity of driving demanded. Therefore, a gasoline tax reduces road congestion. A 
gasoline tax, however, is an imperfect solution, because it affects other decisions 
besides the amount of driving on congested roads. For example, the gasoline tax 
discourages driving on uncongested roads, even though there is no congestion 
externality for these roads.
Fish, Whales, and Other Wildlife  Many species of animals are common re-
sources. Fish and whales, for instance, have commercial value, and anyone can 
go to the ocean and catch whatever is available. Each person has little incentive 
to maintain the species for the next year. Just as excessive grazing can destroy the 
Town Common, excessive fishing and whaling can destroy commercially valuable 
marine populations.
Oceans remain one of the least regulated common resources. Two problems 
prevent an easy solution. First, many countries have access to the oceans, so any 
solution would require international cooperation among countries that hold dif-
ferent values. Second, because the oceans are so vast, enforcing any agreement is 
difficult. As a result, fishing rights have been a frequent source of international 
tension among normally friendly countries.
Within the United States, various laws aim to manage the use of fish and other 
wildlife. For example, the government charges for fishing and hunting licenses, 
and it restricts the lengths of the fishing and hunting seasons. Fishermen are often 
required to throw back small fish, and hunters can kill only a limited number of 
animals. All these laws reduce the use of a common resource and help maintain 
animal populations.

Why the Cow Is Not Extinct
Throughout history, many species of animals have been threatened 
with extinction. When Europeans first arrived in North America, more 
than 60 million buffalo roamed the continent. Yet hunting the buffalo was 
so popular during the 19th century that by 1900 the animal’s population had 
fallen to about 400 before the government stepped in to protect the species. In 
some African countries today, the elephant faces a similar challenge, as poachers 
kill the animals for the ivory in their tusks.
Yet not all animals with commercial value face this threat. The cow, for exam-
ple, is a valuable source of food, but no one worries that the cow will soon be 
extinct. Indeed, the great demand for beef seems to ensure that the species will 
continue to thrive.
Why does the commercial value of ivory threaten the elephant, while the com-
mercial value of beef protects the cow? The reason is that elephants are a common 
resource, whereas cows are a private good. Elephants roam freely without any 
owners. Each poacher has a strong incentive to kill as many elephants as she can 
find. Because poachers are numerous, each poacher has only a slight incentive to 
preserve the elephant population. By contrast, cattle live on ranches that are pri-
vately owned. Each rancher makes a great effort to maintain the cattle population 
on her ranch because she reaps the benefit.
Governments have tried to solve the elephant’s problem in two ways. Some 
countries, such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, have made it illegal to kill el-
ephants and sell their ivory. Yet these laws have been hard to enforce, and the 
battle between the authorities and the poachers has become increasingly violent. 
Meanwhile, elephant populations have continued to dwindle. By contrast, other 
countries, such as Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, have made el-
ephants a private good by allowing people to kill elephants, but only those on 
their own property. Landowners now have an incentive to preserve the species 
on their own land, and as a result, elephant populations have started to rise. With 
private ownership and the profit motive now on its side, the African elephant 
might someday be as safe from extinction as the cow.

The Economics of the Public Sector
11-4 Conclusion: The Importance of 
Property Rights
In this and the previous chapter, we have seen there are some “goods” that 
the market does not provide adequately. Markets do not ensure that the air we 
breathe is clean or that our country is defended from foreign aggressors. Instead, 
societies rely on the government to protect the environment and to provide for the 
national defense.
The problems we considered in these chapters arise in many different 
­markets, but they share a common theme. In all cases, the market fails to allo-
cate resources efficiently because property rights are not well established. That 
is, some item of value does not have an owner with the legal authority to 
control it. For example, although no one doubts that the “good” of clean air 
or national defense is valuable, no one has the right to attach a price to it and 
profit from its use. A factory pollutes too much because no one charges the 
factory for the pollution it emits. The market does not provide for national 
defense because no one can charge those who are defended for the benefit 
they receive.
When the absence of property rights causes a market failure, the 
­government can potentially solve the problem. Sometimes, as in the sale of 
­pollution permits, the solution is for the government to help define prop-
erty rights and thereby unleash market forces. Other times, as in restricted 
­hunting seasons, the solution is for the government to regulate private 
­behavior. Still other times, as in the provision of national defense, the solu-
tion is for the government to use tax revenue to supply a good that the mar-
ket fails to supply. In all cases, if the policy is well planned and well run, it 
can make the allocation of resources more efficient and thus raise economic 
well-being.
•	
Goods differ in whether they are excludable and 
whether they are rival in consumption. A good is 
excludable if it is possible to prevent someone from 
using it. A good is rival in consumption if one per-
son’s use of the good reduces others’ ability to use 
the same unit of the good. Markets work best for pri-
vate goods, which are both excludable and rival in 
consumption. Markets do not work as well for other 
types of goods.
•	
Public goods are neither rival in consumption nor 
­excludable. Examples of public goods include fire-
works displays, national defense, and the creation 
of fundamental knowledge. Because people are not 
charged for their use of the public good, they have 
an incentive to free ride, making private provision of 
the good untenable. Therefore, governments provide 
public goods, basing their decision about the quantity 
of each good on cost–benefit analysis.
•	
Common resources are rival in consumption but not 
excludable. Examples include common grazing land, 
clean air, and congested roads. Because people are not 
charged for their use of common resources, they tend 
to use them excessively. Therefore, governments use 
various methods to limit the use of common resources.

public TV station, but he never sends any money to 
support the station during its fund-raising drives.
a.	 What name do economists have for people like 
Charlie?
b.	 How can the government solve the problem caused 
by people like Charlie?
c.	 Can you think of ways the private market can solve 
this problem? How does the existence of cable TV 
alter the situation?
  4.	 Wireless, high-speed Internet is provided for free in 
the airport of the city of Communityville.
a.	 At first, only a few people use the service. What 
type of a good is this and why?
b.	 Eventually, as more people find out about 
the ­service and start using it, the speed of the 
­connection begins to fall. Now what type of a good 
is the wireless Internet service?
c.	 What problem might result and why? What is one 
possible way to correct this problem?

a.	 Within the dorm room, is the showing of a movie a 
public good? Why or why not?
b.	 If it costs $8 to rent a movie, how many ­movies 
should the roommates rent to maximize total 
surplus?
c.	 If they choose the optimal number from part 
(b) and then split the cost of renting the ­movies 
equally, how much surplus does each person 
­obtain from watching the movies?
d.	 Is there any way to split the cost to ensure that 
­everyone benefits? What practical problems does 
this solution raise?
e.	 Suppose they agree in advance to choose the 
­efficient number and to split the cost of the 
­movies equally. When Judd is asked his willing-
ness to pay, will he have an incentive to tell the 
truth? If so, why? If not, what will he be tempted 
to say?
f.	 What does this example teach you about the 
­optimal provision of public goods?
  6.	 Some economists argue that private firms will not 
undertake the efficient amount of basic scientific 
research.
a.	 Explain why this might be so. In your answer, 
­classify basic research in one of the categories 
shown in Figure 1.
b.	 What sort of policy has the United States adopted 
in response to this problem?
c.	 It is often argued that this policy increases the tech-
nological capability of American producers relative 
to that of foreign firms. Is this argument consistent 
with your classification of basic research in part (a)? 
(Hint: Can excludability apply to some potential 
beneficiaries of a public good and not others?)
  7.	 There is often litter along highways but rarely in 
people’s yards. Provide an economic explanation for 
this fact.
  8.	 The nation of Wiknam has five million residents 
whose only activities are producing and consuming 
fish. They produce fish in two ways. Each person 
who works on a fish farm raises 2 fish per day. Each 
­person who goes fishing in one of the nation’s many 
lakes catches X fish per day. X depends on N, the 
­number of residents (in millions) fishing in the lakes. 
In ­particular, if N million people fish in the lakes, each 
catches X = 6 − N fish. Each resident is attracted to 
the job that pays more fish, so in equilibrium the two 
jobs must offer equal pay.
a.	 Why do you suppose that X, the productivity of each 
fisherman, falls as N, the number of fishermen, rises? 
What economic term would you use to describe the 
fish in the town lakes? Would the same ­description 
apply to the fish from the farms? Explain.
b.	 The town’s Freedom Party thinks every individual 
should have the right to choose between fishing in 
the lake and farming without government interfer-
ence. Under its policy, how many of the residents 
would fish in the lakes and how many would work 
on fish farms? How many fish are produced?
c.	 The town’s Efficiency Party thinks Wiknam should 
produce as many fish as it can. To achieve this goal, 
how many of the residents should fish in the lakes 
and how many should work on the farms? (Hint: 
Create a table that shows the number of fish pro-
duced—on farms, from the lake, and in total—for 
each N from 0 to 5.)
d.	 The Efficiency Party proposes achieving its goal by 
taxing each person fishing in the lake by an amount 
equal to T fish per day. It will then distribute the 
proceeds equally among all Wiknam residents. (Fish 
are assumed to be divisible, so these rebates need 
not be whole numbers.) Calculate the value of T that 
would yield the outcome you derived in part (c).

e.	 Compared with the Freedom Party’s hands-off 
policy, who benefits and who loses from the 
­imposition of the Efficiency Party’s fishing tax?
  9.	 Many transportation systems, such as the Washington, 
D.C., Metro (subway), charge higher fares during rush 
hours than during the rest of the day. Why might they 
do this?
  10.	High-income people are willing to pay more than 
lower-income people to avoid the risk of death. For 
­example, they are more likely to pay for safety features 
on cars. Do you think cost–benefit analysts should 
take this fact into account when evaluating public 
projects? Consider, for instance, a rich town and a 
poor town, both of which are considering the installa-
tion of a traffic light. Should the rich town use a higher 
dollar value for a human life in making this decision?

The Design of 
the Tax System
A
l “Scarface” Capone, the notorious 1920s gangster and crime boss, was never 
convicted for his many violent crimes. Yet, eventually, he did go to jail—for 
tax evasion. He had neglected to heed Ben Franklin’s observation that “in this 
world nothing is certain but death and taxes.”
When Franklin made this claim in 1789, the average American paid less than  
5 percent of his income in taxes, and that remained true for the next hundred 
years. Over the course of the 20th century, however, taxes became ever more 
important in the life of the typical U.S. citizen. Today, all taxes taken together—­
including personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, 
sales taxes, and property taxes—use up more than a quarter of the average 
­American’s income. In many European countries, the tax bite is even larger.
Taxes are inevitable because we as citizens expect our government to pro-
vide us with various goods and services. The previous two chapters shed light 
on one of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: The government can

sometimes improve market outcomes. When the government remedies an exter-
nality (such as air pollution), provides a public good (such as national defense), or 
regulates the use of a common resource (such as fish in a public lake), it can raise 
economic well-being. Yet these activities are costly. For the government to perform 
these and its many other functions, it needs to raise revenue through taxation.
We began our study of taxation in earlier chapters, where we saw how a tax 
on a good affects supply and demand for that good. In Chapter 6, we saw that 
a tax reduces the quantity sold in a market, and we examined how the burden 
of a tax is shared by buyers and sellers depending on the elasticities of supply 
and demand. In Chapter 8, we examined how taxes affect economic well-being. 
We learned that taxes cause deadweight losses: The reduction in consumer and pro-
ducer surplus resulting from a tax exceeds the revenue raised by the government.
In this chapter, we build on these lessons to discuss the design of a tax system. 
We begin with a financial overview of the U.S. government. When thinking about 
the tax system, it is useful to know some basic facts about how the U.S. govern-
ment raises and spends money. We then consider the fundamental principles of 
taxation. Most people agree that taxes should impose as small a cost on society 
as possible and that the burden of taxes should be distributed fairly. That is, the 
tax system should be both efficient and equitable. As we will see, however, stating 
these goals is easier than achieving them.

government has grown substantially over the past century. In 1902, the govern-
ment collected 7 percent of total income; in recent years, government has collected 
almost 30 percent. In other words, as the economy’s income has grown, the gov-
ernment’s revenue from taxation has grown even more.
Table 1 compares the tax burden for several major countries, as measured by 
the government’s tax revenue as a percentage of the nation’s total income. The 
United States has a low tax burden compared to most other advanced economies. 
Many European nations have much higher taxes, which finance a more gener-
ous social safety net, including more substantial income support for the poor and 
­unemployed and universal government-provided healthcare.

The overall size of government tells only part of the story. Behind the total 
dollar figures lie thousands of individual decisions about taxes and spending. 
To ­understand the government’s finances more fully, let’s look at how the total 
breaks down into some broad categories.
12-1a The Federal Government
The U.S. federal government collects about two-thirds of the taxes in our econ-
omy. It raises this money in a number of ways, and it finds even more ways to 
spend it.
Receipts  Table 2 shows the receipts of the federal government in 2011. Total 
receipts that year were $2,520 billion, a number so large that it is hard to compre-
hend. To bring this astronomical number down to earth, we can divide it by the 
size of the U.S. population, which was about 312 million in 2011. We then find that 
the average American paid $8,077 to the federal government.

Part IV	
The Economics of the Public Sector
The largest source of revenue for the federal government is the individual 
­income tax. As April 15 approaches each year, almost every American family fills 
out a tax form to determine how much income tax it owes the government. Each 
family is required to report its income from all sources: wages from working, 
­interest on savings, dividends from corporations in which it owns shares, profits 
from any small businesses it operates, and so on. The family’s tax liability (how 
much it owes) is then based on its total income.
A family’s income tax liability is not simply proportional to its income. Instead, 
the law requires a more complicated calculation. Taxable income is computed as 
total income minus an amount based on the number of dependents (primarily 
children) and minus certain expenses that policymakers have deemed “deduct-
ible” (such as mortgage interest payments, state and local tax payments, and 
charitable giving). Then the tax liability is calculated from taxable income using a 
schedule such as the one shown in Table 3.
This table presents the marginal tax rate—the tax rate applied to each additional 
dollar of income. Because the marginal tax rate rises as income rises, higher-­
income families pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes. Note that each 
tax rate in the table applies only to income within the associated range, not to a 
person’s entire income. For example, a person with an income of $1 million still 
pays only 10 percent of the first $8,925. (Later in this chapter we discuss the con-
cept of the marginal tax rate more fully.)
Almost as important to the federal government as the individual income tax 
are payroll taxes. A payroll tax is a tax on the wages that a firm pays its work-
ers. Table 2 calls this revenue social insurance taxes because the revenue from these 
taxes is earmarked to pay for Social Security and Medicare. Social Security is an 
income-support program designed primarily to maintain the living standards of 
the elderly. Medicare is the government health program for the elderly. Table 2 
shows that the average American paid $2,904 in social insurance taxes in 2011.
Next in magnitude, but much smaller than either individual income taxes or 
social insurance taxes, is the corporate income tax. A corporation is a business set 
up to have its own legal existence, distinct and separate from its owners. The 
government taxes each corporation based on its profit—the amount the corpora-
tion receives for the goods or services it sells minus the costs of producing those 
goods or services. Notice that corporate profits are, in essence, taxed twice. They

This table shows the marginal tax rates for 
an unmarried taxpayer. The taxes owed by a 
taxpayer depend on all the marginal tax rates 
up to his income level. For example, a taxpayer 
with income of $25,000 pays 10 percent  
of the first $8,925 of income, and then  
15 percent of the rest.

are taxed once by the corporate income tax when the corporation earns the prof-
its; they are taxed a second time by the individual income tax when the corpora-
tion uses its profits to pay dividends to its shareholders. In part to compensate 
for this double taxation, policymakers have decided to tax dividend income at 
lower rates than other types of income: In 2013, the top marginal tax rate on 
dividend income was only 20 percent (plus a 3.8 percent Medicare tax), com-
pared with the top tax rate on ordinary income of 39.6 percent (plus the same  
3.8 percent).
The last category, labeled “other” in Table 2, makes up 9 percent of receipts. 
This category includes excise taxes, which are taxes on specific goods like gasoline, 
cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages. It also includes various small items, such as 
estate taxes and customs duties.
Spending  Table 4 shows the spending of the federal government in 2011. Total 
spending was $3,757 billion, or $12,042 per person. This table also shows how the 
federal government’s spending was divided among major categories.
The largest category in Table 4 is for income security, a category that includes 
a variety of transfer payments. A transfer payment is a government payment not 
made in exchange for a good or service. Such payments include the Social ­Security 
income of the elderly and disabled, unemployment insurance payments made to 
workers who have lost their jobs, and welfare payments to the poor. This category 
made up about a third of spending by the federal government in 2011. The federal 
government pays some of this money to state and local governments, which ad-
minister the programs under federal guidelines.
The second largest category of spending is on health programs. This category 
includes Medicare (the government’s health plan for the elderly), Medicaid (the 
federal health program for the poor), and spending on medical research, such as 
that conducted through the National Institutes of Health. Total health spending 
makes up about a quarter of the federal budget.
The next largest category of spending is national defense. This includes both 
the salaries of military personnel and the purchases of military equipment such 
as guns, fighter jets, and warships. Spending on national defense fluctuates over 
time as international tensions and the political climate change. Not surprisingly, 
spending on national defense rises substantially during wars.

The Economics of the Public Sector
Next on the list is net interest. When a person borrows from a bank, the bank 
requires the borrower to pay interest for the loan. The same is true when the gov-
ernment borrows from the public. The more indebted the government, the larger 
the amount it must spend in interest payments.
The “other” category in Table 4 consists of many less expensive functions of 
government. It includes, for example, the federal court system, the space pro-
gram, farm-support programs, housing credit programs, as well as the salaries of 
members of Congress and the president.
You might have noticed that total receipts of the federal government shown in 
Table 2 fall short of total spending shown in Table 4 by more than $1 trillion. In 
such a situation, the government is said to run a budget deficit. When receipts 
exceed spending, the government is said to run a budget surplus. The govern-
ment finances a budget deficit by borrowing from the public. That is, it sells gov-
ernment debt to the private sector, including both investors in the United States 
and those abroad. When the government runs a budget surplus, it uses the excess 
receipts to reduce its outstanding debts.

The Fiscal Challenge Ahead
From 2009 to 2012, the U.S. federal government ran budget deficits that 
exceeded $1 trillion every year, the largest budget shortfalls since World 
War II. These large budget deficits were due primarily to the deep recession 
the economy was experiencing at the time. Recessions tend to increase govern-
ment spending and reduce government revenue. Indeed, as the economy started 
to recover, the budget deficit started to shrink.
Yet this short-term increase in the deficit is only the tip of an ominous iceberg: 
Long-term projections of the government’s budget show that, under current law, 
the government will spend vastly more than it will receive in tax revenue in the 
decades ahead. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP, the total income 
in the economy), taxes are projected to be about constant. But government spend-
ing as a percentage of GDP is projected to rise substantially over the next several 
decades.
One reason for the rise in government spending is that Social Security and 
Medicare provide significant benefits for the elderly, who are a growing percent-
age of the overall population. Over the past half century, medical advances and 
lifestyle improvements have greatly increased life expectancy. In 1950, a 65-year-
old man could expect to live for another 13 years; now he can expect to live an-
other 17 years. The life expectancy of a 65-year-old woman has risen from 16 years 
in 1950 to 20 years today. At the same time, people are having fewer children. In 
1950, the typical woman had three children. Today, the number is about two. As a 
result of smaller families, the labor force is growing more slowly now than it has 
in the past.
Panel (a) of Figure 2 shows the demographic shift that is arising from the com-
bination of longer life expectancy and lower fertility. In 1950, the elderly popula-
tion equaled about 14 percent of the working-age population. Now the elderly 
are about 21 percent of the working-age population, and that figure will rise to 
about 40 percent over the next 50 years. Turning those numbers on their head, 
this means that in 1950 there were about 7 working-age people for every elderly 
person, whereas in 2050 there will be only 2.5. As a result, there will be fewer 
workers paying taxes to support the government benefits that each elderly person 
receives.

(b) Spending on Social Security and health programs
A second, related trend that will affect government spending in the decades 
ahead is the rising cost of healthcare. The federal government provides healthcare 
to the elderly through the Medicare system and to the poor through Medicaid. 
And once the health insurance reform passed in 2010 is fully implemented, the 
government will start providing subsidies for health insurance to many families 
with low to moderate incomes. As the cost of healthcare increases, government 
spending on these programs will increase as well.
Policymakers have proposed various ways to stem the rise in healthcare costs, 
such as reducing the burden of lawsuits on the healthcare system, encouraging 
more competition among healthcare providers, promoting greater use of infor-
mation technology, and providing better incentives to doctors to choose more 
cost-­effective treatments. Many health economists, however, believe that such 
measures will have only a limited impact on reducing the government’s health-
care expenditures. They argue that the main reason for rising healthcare costs is 
medical advances that provide new, better, but often expensive ways to extend 
and improve our lives. So even if these reforms are worth pursuing, spending on 
healthcare programs will nonetheless continue to rise.
Panel (b) of  Figure 2 shows government spending on Social Security and 
health programs as a percentage of GDP. Spending on these programs has risen 
from less than 1 percent in 1950 to more than 10 percent today. The combination of 
a growing elderly population and rising healthcare costs is expected to continue 
the trend.
How our society will handle these spending increases is an open question. 
Simply increasing the budget deficit is not feasible. A budget deficit just pushes 
the cost of government spending onto a future generation of taxpayers, who will

inherit a government with greater debts. In the long run, the government needs to 
pay for what it spends.
Some economists believe that to pay for these commitments, we will need to 
raise taxes substantially as a percentage of GDP. If so, the long-term trend we 
saw in Figure 1 will continue. Spending on Social Security and health programs 
is expected to rise by about 10 percentage points of GDP. Because taxes are now 
30 percent of GDP, paying for these benefits would require approximately a one-
third increase in all taxes.
Other economists believe that such high tax rates would impose too great a cost 
on younger workers. They believe that policymakers should reduce the promises 
now being made to the elderly of the future and that, at the same time, people 
should be encouraged to take a greater role in caring for themselves as they age. 
This might entail raising the normal retirement age, while giving people more 
incentive to save during their working years to prepare for their own retirement 
and health costs.
It is likely that the final resolution will involve a combination of measures. No 
one can dispute that resolving this debate is one of the great challenges ahead. 
12-1b State and Local Governments
State and local governments collect about 40 percent of all taxes paid. Let’s look at 
how they obtain tax revenue and how they spend it.
Receipts  Table 5 shows the receipts of U.S. state and local governments. Total 
receipts for 2011 were $2,064 billion, or $6,615 per person. The table also shows 
how this total is broken down into different kinds of taxes.
The two most important taxes for state and local governments are sales taxes 
and property taxes. Sales taxes are levied as a percentage of the total amount spent 
at retail stores. Every time a customer buys something, he pays the storekeeper 
an extra amount that the storekeeper remits to the government. (Some states ex-
clude certain items that are considered necessities, such as food and clothing.) 
­Property taxes are levied as a percentage of the estimated value of land and struc-
tures and are paid by property owners. Together, these two taxes make up more 
than 40 ­percent of all receipts of state and local governments.

State and local governments also levy individual and corporate income taxes. 
In many cases, state and local income taxes are similar to federal income taxes. 
In other cases, they are quite different. For example, some states tax income from 
wages less heavily than income earned in the form of interest and dividends. 
Some states do not tax income at all.
State and local governments also receive substantial funds from the federal gov-
ernment. To some extent, the federal government’s policy of sharing its revenue 
with state governments redistributes funds from high-income states (which pay 
more taxes) to low-income states (which receive more benefits). Often, these funds 
are tied to specific programs that the federal government wants to subsidize.
Finally, state and local governments receive much of their receipts from various 
sources included in the “other” category in Table 5. These include fees for fishing 
and hunting licenses, tolls from roads and bridges, and fares for public buses and 
subways.
Spending  Table 6 shows the total spending of state and local governments in 
2011 and its breakdown among the major categories.
By far the biggest single expenditure for state and local governments is educa-
tion. Local governments pay for the public schools, which educate most students 
from kindergarten through high school. State governments contribute to the sup-
port of public universities. In 2011, education accounted for about a third of the 
spending of state and local governments.
The second largest category of spending is for health programs, such as 
­Medicaid, followed by spending on public order and safety, which includes the 
police, firefighters, courts, and prisons. Next come income security programs, the 
building and maintenance of roads and highways, and interest on state and local 
government debt. The “other” category in Table 6 includes the many additional 
services provided by state and local governments, such as libraries, garbage and 
snow removal, and the maintenance of public parks and playgrounds.

12-2 Taxes and Efficiency
Now that we have seen how various levels of the U.S. government raise and 
spend money, let’s consider how one might evaluate its tax policy and design a 
tax system. The primary aim of a tax system is to raise revenue for the govern-
ment, but there are many ways to raise any given amount of money. When choos-
ing among the many alternative tax systems, policymakers have two objectives: 
efficiency and equity.
One tax system is more efficient than another if it raises the same amount of 
revenue at a smaller cost to taxpayers. What are the costs of taxes to taxpayers? 
The most obvious cost is the tax payment itself. This transfer of money from the 
taxpayer to the government is an inevitable feature of any tax system. Yet taxes 
also impose two other costs, which well-designed tax policy tries to avoid or, at 
least, minimize:
•	 The deadweight losses that result when taxes distort the decisions that people 
make;
•	 The administrative burdens that taxpayers bear as they comply with the tax 
laws.
An efficient tax system is one that imposes small deadweight losses and small 
administrative burdens.

city would just raise my taxes!”

CHAPTER 12  THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM
243
12-2a Deadweight Losses
One of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people respond to incentives, and this 
includes incentives provided by the tax system. If the government taxes ice cream, 
people eat less ice cream and more frozen yogurt. If the government taxes hous-
ing, people live in smaller houses and spend more of their income on other things. 
If the government taxes labor earnings, people work less and enjoy more leisure.
Because taxes distort incentives, they entail deadweight losses. As we first dis-
cussed in Chapter 8, the deadweight loss of a tax is the reduction in economic 
well-being of taxpayers in excess of the amount of revenue raised by the govern-
ment. The deadweight loss is the inefficiency that a tax creates as people allocate 
resources according to the tax incentive rather than the true costs and benefits of 
the goods and services that they buy and sell.
To recall how taxes cause deadweight losses, consider an example. Suppose 
that Joe places an $8 value on a pizza and Jane places a $6 value on it. If there is no 
tax on pizza, the price of pizza will reflect the cost of making it. Let’s suppose that 
the price of pizza is $5, so both Joe and Jane choose to buy one. Both consumers 
get some surplus of value over the amount paid. Joe gets consumer surplus of $3, 
and Jane gets consumer surplus of $1. Total surplus is $4.
Now suppose that the government levies a $2 tax on pizza and the price of 
pizza rises to $7. (This occurs if supply is perfectly elastic.) Joe still buys a pizza, 
but now he has consumer surplus of only $1. Jane now decides not to buy a pizza 
because its price is higher than its value to her. The government collects tax rev-
enue of $2 on Joe’s pizza. Total consumer surplus has fallen by $3 (from $4 to $1). 
Because total surplus has fallen by more than the tax revenue, the tax has a dead-
weight loss. In this case, the deadweight loss is $1.
Notice that the deadweight loss comes not from Joe, the person who pays the 
tax, but from Jane, the person who doesn’t. The reduction of $2 in Joe’s surplus 
exactly offsets the amount of revenue the government collects. The deadweight 
loss arises because the tax causes Jane to alter her behavior. When the tax raises 
the price of pizza, Jane is worse off, and yet there is no offsetting revenue to the 
government. This reduction in Jane’s welfare is the deadweight loss of the tax.
Should Income or Consumption Be Taxed?
When taxes induce people to change their behavior—such as induc-
ing Jane to buy less pizza—the taxes cause deadweight losses and make 
the allocation of resources less efficient. As we have already seen, much 
government revenue comes from the individual income tax. In a case study in 
­Chapter 8, we discussed how this tax discourages people from working as hard 
as they otherwise might. Another inefficiency caused by this tax is that it discour-
ages people from saving.
Consider a person 25 years old who is considering saving $1,000. If he puts 
this money in a savings account that earns 8 percent and leaves it there, he will 
have $21,720 when he retires at age 65. Yet if the government taxes one-fourth of 
his ­interest income each year, the effective interest rate is only 6 percent. After 
40 years of earning 6 percent, the $1,000 grows to only $10,290, less than half of 
what it would have been without taxation. Thus, because interest income is taxed, 
saving is much less attractive.
Some economists advocate eliminating the current tax system’s disincentive to-
ward saving by changing the basis of taxation. Rather than taxing the amount of

12-2b Administrative Burden
If you ask the typical person on April 15 for an opinion about the tax system, 
you might get an earful (perhaps peppered with expletives) about the headache 
of filling out tax forms. The administrative burden of any tax system is part of the 
inefficiency it creates. This burden includes not only the time spent in early April 
filling out forms but also the time spent throughout the year keeping records for 
tax purposes and the resources the government has to use to enforce the tax laws.
Many taxpayers—especially those in higher tax brackets—hire tax lawyers 
and accountants to help them with their taxes. These experts in the complex tax 
laws fill out the tax forms for their clients and help them arrange their affairs in a 
way that reduces the amount of taxes owed. This behavior is legal tax avoidance, 
which is different from illegal tax evasion.
Critics of our tax system say that these advisers help their clients avoid 
taxes by abusing some of the detailed provisions of the tax code, often dubbed 
­“loopholes.” In some cases, loopholes are congressional mistakes: They arise from 
ambiguities or omissions in the tax laws. More often, they arise because Congress 
has chosen to give special treatment to specific types of behavior. For example, 
the U.S. federal tax code gives preferential treatment to investors in municipal 
bonds because Congress wanted to make it easier for state and local governments 
to borrow money. To some extent, this provision benefits states and localities; and 
to some extent, it benefits high-income taxpayers. Most loopholes are well known 
income that people earn, the government could tax the amount that people spend. 
Under this proposal, all income that is saved would not be taxed until the saving 
is later spent. This alternative system, called a consumption tax, would not distort 
people’s saving decisions.
Various provisions of current law already make the tax system a bit like a con-
sumption tax. Taxpayers can put a limited amount of their income into special 
savings accounts, such as Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plans, and 
this income and the accumulated interest it earns escape taxation until the money 
is withdrawn at retirement. For people who do most of their saving through these 
retirement accounts, their tax bill is, in effect, based on their consumption rather 
than their income.
European countries tend to rely more on consumption taxes than does the 
United States. Most of them raise a significant amount of government revenue 
through a value-added tax, or a VAT. A VAT is like the retail sales tax that many 
U.S. states use. But rather than collecting all of the tax at the retail level when the 
consumer buys the final good, the government collects the tax in stages as the 
good is being produced (that is, as value is added by firms along the chain of 
production).
Various U.S. policymakers have proposed that the tax code move further in 
the direction of taxing consumption rather than income. In 2005, economist Alan 
Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered this advice to a presi-
dential commission on tax reform: “As you know, many economists believe that 
a consumption tax would be best from the perspective of promoting economic 
growth—particularly if one were designing a tax system from scratch—because 
a consumption tax is likely to encourage saving and capital formation. However, 
getting from the current tax system to a consumption tax raises a challenging set 
of transition issues.”

by those in Congress who make tax policy, but what looks like a loophole to one 
taxpayer may look like a justifiable tax deduction to another.
The resources devoted to complying with the tax laws are a type of deadweight 
loss. The government gets only the amount of taxes paid. By contrast, the tax-
payer loses not only this amount but also the time and money spent document-
ing, computing, and avoiding taxes.
The administrative burden of the tax system could be reduced by simplifying 
the tax laws. Yet simplification is often politically difficult. Most people are ready 
to simplify the tax code by eliminating the loopholes that benefit others, but few 
are eager to give up the loopholes that they benefit from themselves. In the end, 
the complexity of the tax law results from the political process as various taxpay-
ers with their own special interests lobby for their causes.
12-2c Marginal Tax Rates versus Average Tax Rates
When discussing the efficiency and equity of income taxes, economists distin-
guish between two notions of the tax rate: the average and the marginal. The 
­average tax rate is total taxes paid divided by total income. The marginal tax rate 
is the amount that taxes increase from an additional dollar of income.
For example, suppose that the government taxes 20 percent of the first $50,000 
of income and 50 percent of all income above $50,000. Under this tax, a person 
who makes $60,000 pays a tax of $15,000: 20 percent of the first $50,000 (0.20 × 
$50,000 = $10,000) plus 50 percent of the next $10,000 (0.50 × $10,000 = $5,000). 
For this person, the average tax rate is $15,000/$60,000, or 25 percent. But the mar-
ginal tax rate is 50 percent. If the taxpayer earned an additional dollar of income, 
that dollar would be subject to the 50 percent tax rate, so the amount the taxpayer 
would owe to the government would rise by $0.50.
The marginal and average tax rates each contain a useful piece of information. If 
we are trying to gauge the sacrifice made by a taxpayer, the average tax rate is more 
appropriate because it measures the fraction of income paid in taxes. By contrast, 
if we are trying to gauge how much the tax system distorts incentives, the mar-
ginal tax rate is more meaningful. One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 
is that rational people think at the margin. A corollary to this principle is that the 
marginal tax rate measures how much the tax system discourages people from 
working. If you are thinking of working an extra few hours, the marginal tax rate 
determines how much the government takes of your additional earnings. It is the 
marginal tax rate, therefore, that determines the deadweight loss of an income tax.
12-2d Lump-Sum Taxes
Suppose the government imposes a tax of $4,000 on everyone. That is, everyone 
owes the same amount, regardless of earnings or any actions that a person might 
take. Such a tax is called a lump-sum tax.
A lump-sum tax shows clearly the difference between average and marginal 
tax rates. For a taxpayer with income of $20,000, the average tax rate of a $4,000 
lump-sum tax is 20 percent; for a taxpayer with income of $40,000, the average tax 
rate is 10 percent. For both taxpayers, the marginal tax rate is zero because no tax 
is owed on an additional dollar of income.
A lump-sum tax is the most efficient tax possible. Because a person’s decisions 
do not alter the amount owed, the tax does not distort incentives and, therefore, 
does not cause deadweight losses. Because everyone can easily compute the 
amount owed and because there is no benefit to hiring tax lawyers and accoun-
tants, the lump-sum tax imposes a minimal administrative burden on taxpayers.

If lump-sum taxes are so efficient, why do we rarely observe them in the real 
world? The reason is that efficiency is only one goal of the tax system. A lump-sum 
tax would take the same amount from the poor and the rich, an outcome most 
people would view as unfair. To understand the tax systems that we ­observe, we 
must therefore consider the other major goal of tax policy: equity.

12-3 Taxes and Equity
Ever since American colonists dumped imported tea into Boston harbor to protest 
high British taxes, tax policy has generated some of the most heated debates in 
American politics. The heat is rarely fueled by questions of efficiency. Instead, it 
arises from disagreements over how the tax burden should be distributed. ­Senator 
Russell Long once mimicked the public debate with this ditty:
Don’t tax you.
Don’t tax me.
Tax that fella behind the tree.
Of course, if we are to rely on the government to provide some of the goods and 
services we want, taxes must fall on someone. In this section, we consider the 
­equity of a tax system. How should the burden of taxes be divided among the 
population? How do we evaluate whether a tax system is fair? Everyone agrees 
that the tax system should be equitable, but there is much disagreement about 
how to judge the equity of a tax system.
12-3a The Benefits Principle
One principle of taxation, called the benefits principle, states that people 
should pay taxes based on the benefits they receive from government ser-
vices. This principle tries to make public goods similar to private goods. It 
seems fair that a person who often goes to the movies pays more in total for 
movie tickets than a person who rarely goes. Similarly, a person who gets 
great benefit from a public good should pay more for it than a person who 
gets little benefit.
The gasoline tax, for instance, is sometimes justified using the benefits prin-
ciple. In some states, revenues from the gasoline tax are used to build and main-
tain roads. Because those who buy gasoline are the same people who use the 
roads, the gasoline tax might be viewed as a fair way to pay for this government 
service.
The benefits principle can also be used to argue that wealthy citizens should 
pay higher taxes than poorer ones. Why? Simply because the wealthy benefit 
more from public services. Consider, for example, the benefits of police protection 
from theft. Citizens with much to protect benefit more from police than do those 
with less to protect. Therefore, according to the benefits principle, the wealthy 
should contribute more than the poor to the cost of maintaining the police force. 
The same argument can be used for many other public services, such as fire pro-
tection, national defense, and the court system.

It is even possible to use the benefits principle to argue for antipoverty pro-
grams funded by taxes on the wealthy. As we discussed in Chapter 11, people 
may prefer living in a society without poverty, suggesting that antipoverty pro-
grams are a public good. If the wealthy place a greater dollar value on this pub-
lic good than members of the middle class do, perhaps just because the wealthy 
have more to spend, then according to the benefits principle, they should be taxed 
more heavily to pay for these programs.
12-3b  The Ability-to-Pay Principle
Another way to evaluate the equity of a tax system is called the ability-to-pay 
principle, which states that taxes should be levied on a person according to how 
well that person can shoulder the burden. This principle is sometimes justified by 
the claim that all citizens should make an “equal sacrifice” to support the govern-
ment. The magnitude of a person’s sacrifice, however, depends not only on the 
size of his tax payment but also on his income and other circumstances. A $1,000 
tax paid by a poor person may require a larger sacrifice than a $10,000 tax paid by 
a rich one.
The ability-to-pay principle leads to two corollary notions of equity: vertical 
equity and horizontal equity. Vertical equity states that taxpayers with a greater 
ability to pay should contribute a larger amount. Horizontal equity states that 
taxpayers with similar abilities to pay should contribute the same amount. These 
notions of equity are widely accepted, but applying them to evaluate a tax system 
is rarely straightforward.
Vertical Equity  If taxes are based on ability to pay, then richer taxpayers should 
pay more than poorer taxpayers. But how much more should the rich pay? Much 
of the debate over tax policy concerns this question.
Consider the three tax systems in Table 7. In each case, taxpayers with higher 
incomes pay more. Yet the systems differ in how quickly taxes rise with income. 
The first system is called proportional because all taxpayers pay the same fraction 
of income. The second system is called regressive because high-income taxpayers 
pay a smaller fraction of their income, even though they pay a larger amount. The 
third system is called progressive because high-income taxpayers pay a larger 
fraction of their income.
Which of these three tax systems is most fair? There is no obvious answer, and 
economic theory does not offer any help in trying to find one. Equity, like beauty, 
is in the eye of the beholder.

How the Tax Burden Is Distributed
Much debate over tax policy concerns whether the wealthy pay their 
fair share. There is no objective way to make this judgment. In evaluating 
the issue for yourself, however, it is useful to know how much families with 
different incomes pay under the current tax system.
Table 8 presents some data on how federal taxes are distributed among income 
classes. These figures are for 2009, the most recent year available as this book was 
going to press, and were tabulated by the Congressional Budget Office. They in-
clude all federal taxes—individual income taxes, payroll taxes, corporate income 
taxes, and excise taxes—but not state and local taxes. When calculating a house-
hold’s tax burden, the CBO allocates corporate income taxes to the owners of cap-
ital and payroll taxes to workers.
To construct the table, households are ranked according to their income and 
placed into five groups of equal size, called quintiles. The table also presents data 
on the richest 1 percent of Americans. The second column of the table shows the 
average income of each group. Income includes both market income (income that 
households have earned from their work and savings) and transfer payments from 
government programs, such as Social Security and welfare. The poorest one-fifth of 
households had average income of  $23,500, and the richest one-fifth had average 
income of $223,500. The richest 1 percent had average income of over $1.2 million.
The third column of the table shows total taxes as a percentage of income. 
As you can see, the U.S. federal tax system is progressive. The poorest fifth of 
households paid 1.0 percent of their incomes in taxes, and the richest fifth paid 
23.2 ­percent. The top 1 percent paid 28.9 percent of their incomes.
The fourth and fifth columns compare the distribution of income and the dis-
tribution of taxes. The poorest quintile earned 5.1 percent of all income and paid  
0.3 percent of all taxes. The richest quintile earned 50.8 percent of all income and 
paid 67.9 percent of all taxes. The richest 1 percent (which, remember, is 1﻿﻿﻿/20 the 
size of each quintile) earned 13.4 percent of all income and paid 22.3 percent of all 
taxes.
These numbers on taxes paid are a good starting point for understanding how 
the burden of government is distributed, but they give an incomplete picture. 
Money flows not only from households to the government in the form of taxes but 
also from the government back to households in the form of transfer payments. 
In some ways, transfer payments are the opposite of taxes. Including transfers as 
negative taxes substantially changes the distribution of the tax burden. The richest

CHAPTER 12  THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM

quintile of households still pays about one-quarter of its income to the govern-
ment, even after transfers are subtracted, and the top 1 percent still pays almost 
30 percent. By contrast, the average tax rate for the poorest quintile becomes a 
sizeable negative number. That is, typical households in the bottom of the income 
distribution receive substantially more in transfers than they pay in taxes. The 
lesson is clear: To understand fully the progressivity of government policies, one 
must take account of both what people pay and what they receive.
Finally, it is worth noting that the numbers in Table 8 are a bit out of date. In 
late 2012, the U.S. Congress passed and President Obama signed a tax bill that 
increased taxes significantly from those that prevailed previously, particularly for 
taxpayers at the top of the income distribution. For individuals earning taxable 
income more than $400,000 and couples earning more than $450,000, the marginal 
income tax rate was increased from 35 to 39.6 percent. As a result, the tax system in 
place for 2013 and beyond is more progressive than the one shown in the table. 
Horizontal Equity  If taxes are based on ability to pay, then similar taxpayers 
should pay similar amounts of taxes. But what determines if two taxpayers are 
similar? Families differ in many ways. To evaluate whether a tax code is horizon-
tally equitable, one must determine which differences are relevant for a family’s 
ability to pay and which differences are not.
Suppose the Smith and Jones families each have income of $100,000. The Smiths 
have no children, but Mr. Smith has an illness that results in medical expenses of 
$40,000. The Joneses are in good health, but they have four children. Two of the 
Jones children are in college, generating tuition bills of $60,000. Would it be fair 
for these two families to pay the same tax because they have the same income? 
Would it be fair to give the Smiths a tax break to help them offset their high medi-
cal expenses? Would it be fair to give the Joneses a tax break to help them with 
their tuition expenses?
There are no easy answers to these questions. In practice, the U.S. tax code is 
filled with special provisions that alter a family’s tax obligations based on its spe-
cific circumstances.
12-3c Tax Incidence and Tax Equity
Tax incidence—the study of who bears the burden of taxes—is central to evaluat-
ing tax equity. As we first saw in Chapter 6, the person who bears the burden of 
a tax is not always the person who gets the tax bill from the government. Because 
taxes alter supply and demand, they alter equilibrium prices. As a result, they 
affect people beyond those who, according to statute, actually pay the tax. When 
evaluating the vertical and horizontal equity of any tax, it is important to take 
these indirect effects into account.
Many discussions of tax equity ignore the indirect effects of taxes and are based 
on what economists mockingly call the flypaper theory of tax incidence. According 
to this theory, the burden of a tax, like a fly on flypaper, sticks wherever it first 
lands. This assumption, however, is rarely valid.
For example, a person not trained in economics might argue that a tax on 
­expensive fur coats is vertically equitable because most buyers of furs are wealthy. 
Yet if these buyers can easily substitute other luxuries for furs, then a tax on furs 
might only reduce the sale of furs. In the end, the burden of the tax will fall more 
on those who make and sell furs than on those who buy them. Because most 
workers who make furs are not wealthy, the equity of a fur tax could be quite dif-
ferent from what the flypaper theory indicates.

The Blur Between 
Spending and Taxes
By N. Gregory Mankiw
S
hould the government cut spending or 
raise taxes to deal with its long-term 
­fiscal imbalance? As President Obama’s 
deficit commission rolls out its final report in 
the coming weeks, this issue will most likely 
­divide the political right and left. But, in many 
ways, the question is the wrong one. The dis-
tinction between spending and taxation is 
­often murky and sometimes meaningless.
Imagine that there is some activity—say, 
snipe hunting—that members of Congress 
want to encourage. Senator Porkbelly pro-
poses a government subsidy. “America needs 
more snipe hunters,” he says. “I propose 
that every time an American bags a snipe, 
the federal government should pay him or 
her $100.”
“No, no,” says Congressman Blowhard. 
“The Porkbelly plan would increase the size of 
an already bloated government. Let’s instead 
reduce the burden of taxation. I propose that 
every time an American tracks down a snipe, 
the hunter should get a $100 credit to reduce 
his or her tax liabilities.”
To be sure, government accountants may 
treat the Porkbelly and Blowhard plans differ-
ently. They would likely deem the subsidy to 
be a spending increase and the credit to be a 
tax cut. Moreover, the rhetoric of the two poli-
ticians about spending and taxes may appeal 
to different political bases.
But it hardly takes an economic genius to 
see how little difference there is between the 
two plans. Both policies enrich the nation’s 
snipe hunters. And because the government 
must balance its books, at least in the long 
run, the gains of the snipe hunters must come 
at the cost of higher taxes or lower govern-
ment benefits for the rest of us.
Economists call the Blowhard plan a 
“tax expenditure.” The tax code is filled 
with them—although not yet one for snipe 
hunting. Every time a politician promises 
a “targeted tax cut,” he or she is probably 
­offering up a form of government spending in 
disguise.
Erskine B. Bowles and Alan K. Simpson, 
the chairmen of President Obama’s deficit re-
duction commission, have taken at hard look 
at these tax expenditures—and they don’t 
like what they see. In their draft proposal, 
released earlier this month, they proposed 
doing away with tax expenditures, which to-
gether cost the Treasury over $1 trillion a year.
Such a drastic step would allow Mr. Bowles 
and Mr. Simpson to move the budget toward fis-
cal sustainability, while ­simultaneously reduc-
ing all income tax rates. Under their plan, the 
top tax rate would fall to 23 percent from the 
35 percent in today’s law (and the 39.6 percent 
currently advocated by Democratic leadership).
This approach has long been the basic 
recipe for tax reform. By broadening the tax 
base and lowering tax rates, we can increase 
government revenue and distort incentives 
less. That should command widespread ap-
plause across the ideological spectrum. 
Unfortunately, the reaction has been less 
enthusiastic.
Pundits on the left are suspicious of any 
plan that reduces marginal tax rates on the 
rich. But, as Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson 
point out, tax expenditures disproportionately

Who Pays the Corporate Income Tax?
The corporate income tax provides a good example of the importance 
of tax incidence for tax policy. The corporate tax is popular among voters. 
After all, corporations are not people. Voters are always eager to have their 
taxes reduced and have some impersonal corporation pick up the tab.
But before deciding that the corporate income tax is a good way for the gov-
ernment to raise revenue, we should consider who bears the burden of the cor-
porate tax. This is a difficult question on which economists disagree, but one 
thing is certain: People pay all taxes. When the government levies a tax on a cor-
poration, the corporation is more like a tax collector than a taxpayer. The burden 
of the tax ultimately falls on people—the owners, customers, or workers of the 
corporation.
Many economists believe that workers and customers bear much of the burden 
of the corporate income tax. To see why, consider an example. Suppose that the 
case

benefit those at the top of the economic lad-
der. According to their figures, tax expendi-
tures increase the after-tax income of those in 
the bottom quintile by about 6 percent. Those 
in the top 1 percent of the income distribution 
enjoy about twice that gain. Progressives who 
are concerned about the gap between rich 
and poor should be eager to scale back tax 
expenditures.
Pundits on the right, meanwhile, are sus-
picious of anything that increases govern-
ment revenue. But they should recognize that 
tax expenditures are best viewed as a hidden 
form of spending. If we eliminate tax expen-
ditures and reduce marginal tax rates, as 
Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson propose, we are 
essentially doing what economic conserva-
tives have long advocated: cutting spending 
and taxes.
Yet another political problem is that each 
tax expenditure has its own political constitu-
ency. If Congressman Blowhard ever got his 
way, the snipe hunters of the world would 
surely fight to keep their tax break.
One major tax expenditure that the 
Bowles–Simpson plan would curtail or elimi-
nate is the mortgage interest deduction. 
Without doubt, many homeowners and the 
real estate industry will object. But they won’t 
have the merits on their side.
This subsidy to homeownership is neither 
economically efficient nor particularly equi-
table. Economists have long pointed out that 
tax subsidies to housing, together with the 
high taxes on corporations, cause too much of 
the economy’s capital stock to be tied up in 
residential structures and too little in corpo-
rate capital. This misallocation of resources 
results in lower productivity and reduced real 
wages.
Moreover, there is nothing particularly ig-
noble about renting that deserves the scorn of 
the tax code. But let’s face it: subsidizing ho-
meowners is the same as penalizing renters. 
In the end, someone has to pick up the tab.
There are certain tax expenditures that I 
like. My personal favorite is the deduction for 
charitable giving. It encourages philanthropy 
and, thus, private rather than governmental 
solutions to society’s problems.
But I know that solving the long-term fis-
cal problem won’t be easy. Everyone will have 
to give a little, and perhaps even more than a 
little. I am willing to give up my favorite tax 
expenditure if everyone else is willing to give 
up theirs.
The Bowles–Simpson proposal is not per-
fect, but it is far better than the status quo. 
The question ahead is whether we can get 
Senator Porkbelly and Congressman Blowhard 
to agree.

U.S. government decides to raise the tax on the income earned by car companies. 
At first, this tax hurts the owners of the car companies, who receive less profit. 
But over time, these owners will respond to the tax. Because producing cars is less 
profitable, they invest less in building new car factories. Instead, they invest their 
wealth in other ways—for example, by buying larger houses or by building fac-
tories in other industries or other countries. With fewer car factories, the supply 
of cars declines, as does the demand for autoworkers. Thus, a tax on corporations 
making cars causes the price of cars to rise and the wages of autoworkers to fall.
The corporate income tax shows how dangerous the flypaper theory of tax in-
cidence can be. The corporate income tax is popular in part because it appears 
to be paid by rich corporations. Yet those who bear the ultimate burden of the 
tax—the customers and workers of corporations—are often not rich. If the true 
incidence of the corporate tax were more widely known, this tax might be less 
popular among voters.

12-4 Conclusion: The Trade-off between 
Equity and Efficiency
Almost everyone agrees that equity and efficiency are the two most important 
goals of a tax system. But these two goals often conflict, especially when equity 
is judged by the progressivity of the tax system. People disagree about tax policy 
often because they attach different weights to these goals.
The recent history of tax policy shows how political leaders differ in their 
views on equity and efficiency. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 
1980, the marginal tax rate on the earnings of the richest Americans was 50 per-
cent. On interest income, the marginal tax rate was 70 percent. Reagan argued 
that such high tax rates greatly distorted economic incentives to work and save. 
In other words, he claimed that these high tax rates cost too much in terms of 
economic efficiency. Tax reform was, therefore, a high priority of his administra-
tion. Reagan signed into law large cuts in tax rates in 1981 and then again in 1986. 
When Reagan left office in 1989, the richest Americans faced a marginal tax rate 
of only 28 percent.
The pendulum of political debate swings both ways. When Bill Clinton ran for 
president in 1992, he argued that the rich were not paying their fair share of taxes. 
In other words, the low tax rates on the rich violated his view of vertical equity. 
In 1993, President Clinton signed into law a bill that raised the tax rates on the

richest Americans to about 40 percent. When George W. Bush ran for president, 
he ­reprised many of Reagan’s themes, and as president he reversed part of the 
Clinton tax increase, reducing the highest tax rate to 35 percent. Barack Obama 
pledged during the 2008 presidential campaign that he would raise taxes on high-
income households, and starting in 2013 the top marginal tax rate was back at 
about 40 percent.
Economics alone cannot determine the best way to balance the goals of effi-
ciency and equity. This issue involves political philosophy as well as econom-
ics. But economists have an important role in this debate: They can shed light 
on the trade-offs that society inevitably faces when designing the tax system and 
can help us avoid policies that sacrifice efficiency without any benefit in terms 
of equity.
•	
The U.S. government raises revenue using various 
taxes. The most important taxes for the federal govern-
ment are individual income taxes and payroll taxes for 
social insurance. The most important taxes for state and 
local governments are sales taxes and property taxes.
•	
The efficiency of a tax system refers to the costs it im-
poses on taxpayers. There are two costs of taxes be-
yond the transfer of resources from the taxpayer to the 
government. The first is the deadweight loss that arises 
as taxes alter incentives and distort the allocation of 
resources. The second is the administrative burden of 
complying with the tax laws.
•	
The equity of a tax system concerns whether the tax 
burden is distributed fairly among the population. 
According to the benefits principle, it is fair for people 
to pay taxes based on the benefits they receive from the 
government. According to the ability-to-pay principle, 
it is fair for people to pay taxes based on their capa-
bility to handle the financial burden. When evaluating 
the equity of a tax system, it is important to remember 
a lesson from the study of tax incidence: The distribu-
tion of tax burdens is not the same as the distribution 
of tax bills.
•	
When considering changes in the tax laws, policymak-
ers often face a trade-off between efficiency and equity. 
Much of the debate over tax policy arises because peo-
ple give different weights to these two goals.

T
he economy is made up of thousands of firms that produce the goods and 
services you enjoy every day: General Motors produces automobiles, General 
Electric produces lightbulbs, and General Mills produces breakfast cereals. 
Some firms, such as these three, are large; they employ thousands of workers and 
have thousands of stockholders who share in the firms’ profits. Other firms, such 
as the local barbershop or café, are small; they employ only a few workers and are 
owned by a single person or family.
In previous chapters, we used the supply curve to summarize firms’ production 
decisions. According to the law of supply, firms are willing to produce and 
sell a greater quantity of a good when the price of the good is higher, and this 
response leads to a supply curve that slopes upward. For analyzing many 
questions, the law of supply is all you need to know about firm behavior.
In this chapter and the ones that follow, we examine firm behavior in 
more detail. This topic will give you a better understanding of the decisions

FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
behind the supply curve. In addition, it will introduce you to a part of economics 
called industrial organization—the study of how firms’ decisions about prices and 
quantities depend on the market conditions they face. The town in which you 
live, for instance, may have several pizzerias but only one cable television com-
pany. This raises a key question: How does the number of firms affect the prices in 
a market and the efficiency of the market outcome? The field of industrial organi-
zation ­addresses exactly this question.
Before turning to these issues, we need to discuss the costs of production. All 
firms, from Delta Air Lines to your local deli, incur costs as they make the goods 
and services that they sell. As we will see in the coming chapters, a firm’s costs 
are a key determinant of its production and pricing decisions. In this chapter, we 
define some of the variables that economists use to measure a firm’s costs, and we 
consider the relationships among these variables.
A word of warning: This topic is dry and technical. To be honest, one might 
even call it boring. But this material provides a crucial foundation for the fascinat-
ing topics that follow.
13-1 What Are Costs?
We begin our discussion of costs at Caroline’s Cookie Factory. Caroline, the owner 
of the firm, buys flour, sugar, chocolate chips, and other cookie ingredients. She 
also buys the mixers and ovens and hires workers to run this equipment. She then 
sells the cookies to consumers. By examining some of the issues that Caroline 
faces in her business, we can learn some lessons about costs that apply to all firms 
in an economy.
13-1a Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Profit
We begin with the firm’s objective. To understand the decisions a firm makes, we 
must understand what it is trying to do. It is conceivable that Caroline started her 
firm because of an altruistic desire to provide the world with cookies or, perhaps, 
out of love for the cookie business. More likely, Caroline started her business to 
make money. Economists normally assume that the goal of a firm is to maximize 
profit, and they find that this assumption works well in most cases.
What is a firm’s profit? The amount that the firm receives for the sale of its 
output (cookies) is called its total revenue. The amount that the firm pays to buy 
inputs (flour, sugar, workers, ovens, and so forth) is called its total cost. Caroline 
gets to keep any revenue that is not needed to cover costs. Profit is a firm’s total 
revenue minus its total cost:
Profit = Total revenue − Total cost.
Caroline’s objective is to make her firm’s profit as large as possible.
To see how a firm goes about maximizing profit, we must consider fully how to 
measure its total revenue and its total cost. Total revenue is the easy part: It equals 
the quantity of output the firm produces times the price at which it sells its output. 
If Caroline produces 10,000 cookies and sells them at $2 a cookie, her total revenue 
is $20,000. The measurement of a firm’s total cost, however, is more subtle.
13-1b Costs as Opportunity Costs
When measuring costs at Caroline’s Cookie Factory or any other firm, it is im-
portant to keep in mind one of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: The 
total revenue
the amount a firm 
receives for the sale of  
its output

CHAPTER 13  THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
261
cost of something is what you give up to get it. Recall that the opportunity cost of 
an item refers to all those things that must be forgone to acquire that item. When 
economists speak of a firm’s cost of production, they include all the opportunity 
costs of making its output of goods and services.
While some of a firm’s opportunity costs of production are obvious, others are 
less so. When Caroline pays $1,000 for flour, that $1,000 is an opportunity cost 
because Caroline can no longer use that $1,000 to buy something else. Similarly, 
when Caroline hires workers to make the cookies, the wages she pays are part of 
the firm’s costs. Because these opportunity costs require the firm to pay out some 
money, they are called explicit costs. By contrast, some of a firm’s opportunity 
costs, called implicit costs, do not require a cash outlay. Imagine that Caroline 
is skilled with computers and could earn $100 per hour working as a program-
mer. For every hour that Caroline works at her cookie factory, she gives up $100 
in ­income, and this forgone income is also part of her costs. The total cost of 
­Caroline’s business is the sum of her explicit and implicit costs.
The distinction between explicit and implicit costs highlights an important dif-
ference between how economists and accountants analyze a business. Economists 
are interested in studying how firms make production and pricing decisions. 
­Because these decisions are based on both explicit and implicit costs, economists 
include both when measuring a firm’s costs. By contrast, accountants have the job 
of keeping track of the money that flows into and out of firms. As a result, they 
measure the explicit costs but usually ignore the implicit costs.
The difference between the methods of economists and accountants is easy to 
see in the case of Caroline’s Cookie Factory. When Caroline gives up the oppor-
tunity to earn money as a computer programmer, her accountant will not count 
this as a cost of her cookie business. Because no money flows out of the business 
to pay for this cost, it never shows up on the accountant’s financial statements. 
An economist, however, will count the forgone income as a cost because it will 
affect the decisions that Caroline makes in her cookie business. For example, if 
Caroline’s wage as a computer programmer rises from $100 to $500 per hour, she 
might decide that running her cookie business is too costly and choose to shut 
down the factory to become a full-time computer programmer.
13-1c The Cost of Capital as an Opportunity Cost
An important implicit cost of almost every business is the opportunity cost of the 
financial capital that has been invested in the business. Suppose, for instance, that 
Caroline used $300,000 of her savings to buy her cookie factory from its previous 
owner. If Caroline had instead left this money deposited in a savings account that 
pays an interest rate of 5 percent, she would have earned $15,000 per year. To 
own her cookie factory, therefore, Caroline has given up $15,000 a year in interest 
income. This forgone $15,000 is one of the implicit opportunity costs of Caroline’s 
business.
As we have already noted, economists and accountants treat costs differently, 
and this is especially true in their treatment of the cost of capital. An economist 
views the $15,000 in interest income that Caroline gives up every year as an im-
plicit cost of her business. Caroline’s accountant, however, will not show this 
$15,000 as a cost because no money flows out of the business to pay for it.
To further explore the difference between the methods of economists and 
­accountants, let’s change the example slightly. Suppose now that Caroline did 
not have the entire $300,000 to buy the factory but, instead, used $100,000 of her 
own savings and borrowed $200,000 from a bank at an interest rate of 5 percent. 
­Caroline’s accountant, who only measures explicit costs, will now count the 
explicit costs
input costs that require 
an outlay of money by 
the firm
implicit costs
input costs that do not 
require an outlay of 
money by the firm	 THETPRT

FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
$10,000 interest paid on the bank loan every year as a cost because this amount 
of money now flows out of the firm. By contrast, according to an economist, the 
­opportunity cost of owning the business is still $15,000. The opportunity cost 
equals the interest on the bank loan (an explicit cost of $10,000) plus the forgone 
interest on savings (an implicit cost of $5,000).
13-1d Economic Profit versus Accounting Profit
Now let’s return to the firm’s objective: profit. Because economists and accoun-
tants measure costs differently, they also measure profit differently. An econo-
mist measures a firm’s economic profit as the firm’s total revenue minus all the 
­opportunity costs (explicit and implicit) of producing the goods and services sold. 
An accountant measures the firm’s accounting profit as the firm’s total revenue 
minus only the firm’s explicit costs.
Figure 1 summarizes this difference. Notice that because the accountant 
­ignores the implicit costs, accounting profit is usually larger than economic profit. 
For a business to be profitable from an economist’s standpoint, total revenue must 
cover all the opportunity costs, both explicit and implicit.
Economic profit is an important concept because it is what motivates the firms 
that supply goods and services. As we will see, a firm making positive economic 
profit will stay in business. It is covering all its opportunity costs and has some rev-
enue left to reward the firm owners. When a firm is making economic losses (that 
is, when economic profits are negative), the business owners are failing to earn 
enough revenue to cover all the costs of production. Unless conditions change, 
the firm owners will eventually close down the business and exit the industry. 
To ­understand business decisions, we need to keep an eye on economic profit.

13-2 Production and Costs
Firms incur costs when they buy inputs to produce the goods and services that 
they plan to sell. In this section, we examine the link between a firm’s production 
process and its total cost. Once again, we consider Caroline’s Cookie Factory.
In the analysis that follows, we make an important simplifying assumption: 
We assume that the size of Caroline’s factory is fixed and that Caroline can vary 
the quantity of cookies produced only by changing the number of workers she 
employs. This assumption is realistic in the short run but not in the long run. That 
is, Caroline cannot build a larger factory overnight, but she can do so over the 
next year or two. This analysis, therefore, describes the production decisions that 
­Caroline faces in the short run. We examine the relationship between costs and 
time horizon more fully later in the chapter.
13-2a The Production Function
Table 1 shows how the quantity of cookies produced per hour at Caroline’s fac-
tory depends on the number of workers. As you can see in the first two columns, 
if there are no workers in the factory, Caroline produces no cookies. When there 
is 1 worker, she produces 50 cookies. When there are 2 workers, she produces 90 
cookies and so on. Panel (a) of Figure 2 presents a graph of these two columns 
of numbers. The number of workers is on the horizontal axis, and the number 
of cookies produced is on the vertical axis. This relationship between the quan-
tity of inputs (workers) and quantity of output (cookies) is called the production 
­function.

PART V	
FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
One of the Ten Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that rational 
people think at the margin. As we will see in future chapters, this idea is the key 
to understanding the decisions a firm makes about how many workers to hire 
and how much output to produce. To take a step toward understanding these 
decisions, the third column in the table gives the marginal product of a worker. 
The marginal product of any input in the production process is the increase in 
the quantity of output obtained from one additional unit of that input. When the 
number of workers goes from 1 to 2, cookie production increases from 50 to 90, 
so the marginal product of the second worker is 40 cookies. And when the num-
ber of workers goes from 2 to 3, cookie production increases from 90 to 120, so 
the marginal product of the third worker is 30 cookies. In the table, the marginal 
product is shown halfway between two rows because it represents the change in 
output as the number of workers increases from one level to another.
Notice that as the number of workers increases, the marginal product declines. 
The second worker has a marginal product of 40 cookies, the third worker has a 
marginal product of 30 cookies, and the fourth worker has a marginal product of 20 
FIGURE 2
The production function in panel (a) shows the relationship between the number of 
workers hired and the quantity of output produced. Here the number of workers hired 
(on the horizontal axis) is from the first column in Table 1, and the quantity of output 
produced (on the vertical axis) is from the second column. The production function gets 
flatter as the number of workers increases, reflecting diminishing marginal product. 
The total-cost curve in panel (b) shows the relationship between the quantity of output 
produced and total cost of production. Here the quantity of output produced (on the 
horizontal axis) is from the second column in Table 1, and the total cost (on the vertical 
axis) is from the sixth column. The total-cost curve gets steeper as the quantity of out-
put increases because of diminishing marginal product.

cookies. This property is called diminishing marginal product. At first, when only 
a few workers are hired, they have easy access to Caroline’s kitchen equipment. As 
the number of workers increases, additional workers have to share equipment and 
work in more crowded conditions. Eventually, the kitchen is so crowded that the 
workers start getting in each other’s way. Hence, as more workers are hired, each 
additional worker contributes fewer additional cookies to total production.
Diminishing marginal product is also apparent in Figure 2. The production 
function’s slope (“rise over run”) tells us the change in Caroline’s output of cook-
ies (“rise”) for each additional input of labor (“run”). That is, the slope of the pro-
duction function measures the marginal product of a worker. As the number of 
workers increases, the marginal product declines, and the production function 
becomes flatter.
13-2b From the Production Function to 
the Total-Cost Curve
The last three columns of Table 1 show Caroline’s cost of producing cookies. 
In this example, the cost of Caroline’s factory is $30 per hour, and the cost of a 
worker is $10 per hour. If she hires 1 worker, her total cost is $40 per hour. If she 
hires 2 workers, her total cost is $50 per hour, and so on. With this information, 
the table now shows how the number of workers Caroline hires is related to the 
quantity of cookies she produces and to her total cost of production.
Our goal in the next several chapters is to study firms’ production and pricing 
decisions. For this purpose, the most important relationship in Table 1 is between 
quantity produced (in the second column) and total cost (in the sixth column). 
Panel (b) of Figure 2 graphs these two columns of data with the quantity pro-
duced on the horizontal axis and total cost on the vertical axis. This graph is called 
the total-cost curve.
Now compare the total-cost curve in panel (b) with the production function 
in panel (a). These two curves are opposite sides of the same coin. The total-cost 
curve gets steeper as the amount produced rises, whereas the production func-
tion gets flatter as production rises. These changes in slope occur for the same 
reason. High production of cookies means that Caroline’s kitchen is crowded with 
many workers. Because the kitchen is crowded, each additional worker adds less 
to production, reflecting diminishing marginal product. Therefore, the production 
function is relatively flat. But now turn this logic around: When the kitchen is 
crowded, producing an additional cookie requires a lot of additional labor and 
is thus very costly. Therefore, when the quantity produced is large, the total-cost 
curve is relatively steep.

production and pricing decisions in future chapters. To see how these related 
measures are derived, we consider the example in Table 2. This table presents cost 
data on Caroline’s neighbor—Conrad’s Coffee Shop.
The first column of the table shows the number of cups of coffee that Conrad 
might produce, ranging from 0 to 10 cups per hour. The second column shows 
Conrad’s total cost of producing coffee. Figure 3 plots Conrad’s total-cost curve. 
The quantity of coffee (from the first column) is on the horizontal axis, and total 
cost (from the second column) is on the vertical axis. Conrad’s total-cost curve has 
a shape similar to Caroline’s. In particular, it becomes steeper as the quantity pro-
duced rises, which (as we have discussed) reflects diminishing marginal product.
13-3a Fixed and Variable Costs
Conrad’s total cost can be divided into two types. Some costs, called fixed costs, 
do not vary with the quantity of output produced. They are incurred even if the 
firm produces nothing at all. Conrad’s fixed costs include any rent he pays be-
cause this cost is the same regardless of how much coffee he produces. Similarly, 
if Conrad needs to hire a full-time bookkeeper to pay bills, regardless of the quan-
tity of coffee produced, the bookkeeper’s salary is a fixed cost. The third column 
in Table 2 shows Conrad’s fixed cost, which in this example is $3.00.

CHAPTER 13  THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
267
Some of the firm’s costs, called variable costs, change as the firm alters the 
quantity of output produced. Conrad’s variable costs include the cost of coffee 
beans, milk, sugar, and paper cups: The more cups of coffee Conrad makes, the 
more of these items he needs to buy. Similarly, if Conrad has to hire more workers 
to make more cups of coffee, the salaries of these workers are variable costs. The 
fourth column of the table shows Conrad’s variable cost. The variable cost is 0 if 
he produces nothing, $0.30 if he produces 1 cup of coffee, $0.80 if he produces 2 
cups, and so on.
A firm’s total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs. In Table 2, total cost in 
the second column equals fixed cost in the third column plus variable cost in the 
fourth column.
13-3b Average and Marginal Cost
As the owner of his firm, Conrad has to decide how much to produce. One issue 
he will want to consider when making this decision is how the level of production 
affects his firm’s costs. Conrad might ask his production supervisor the following 
two questions about the cost of producing coffee:
•	 How much does it cost to make the typical cup of coffee?
•	 How much does it cost to increase production of coffee by 1 cup?
These two questions might seem to have the same answer, but they do not. Both 
answers are important for understanding how firms make production decisions.
To find the cost of the typical unit produced, we divide the firm’s costs by the 
quantity of output it produces. For example, if the firm produces 2 cups of coffee 
per hour, its total cost is $3.80, and the cost of the typical cup is $3.80/2, or $1.90. 
Total cost divided by the quantity of output is called average total cost. Because 
total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs, average total cost can be expressed 
FIGURE 3
Conrad’s Total-Cost Curve
Here the quantity of output 
­produced (on the horizontal 
axis) is from the first column 
in Table 2, and the total cost 
(on the vertical axis) is from the 
second column. As in Figure 2, 
the total-cost curve gets steeper 
as the quantity of output in-
creases because of diminishing 
marginal product.

FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
as the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. Average fixed cost is 
the fixed cost divided by the quantity of output, and average variable cost is the 
variable cost divided by the quantity of output.
Average total cost tells us the cost of the typical unit, but it does not tell us 
how much total cost will change as the firm alters its level of production. The last 
column in Table 2 shows the amount that total cost rises when the firm increases 
production by 1 unit of output. This number is called marginal cost. For exam-
ple, if Conrad increases production from 2 to 3 cups, total cost rises from $3.80 to 
$4.50, so the marginal cost of the third cup of coffee is $4.50 minus $3.80, or $0.70. 
In the table, the marginal cost appears halfway between any two rows because it 
represents the change in total cost as quantity of output increases from one level 
to another.
It may be helpful to express these definitions mathematically:
Average total cost = Total cost/Quantity
ATC = TC/Q,
and
Marginal cost = Change in total cost/Change in quantity
MC = ΔTC/ΔQ.
Here Δ, the Greek letter delta, represents the change in a variable. These equa-
tions show how average total cost and marginal cost are derived from total cost. 
­Average total cost tells us the cost of a typical unit of output if total cost is divided evenly 
over all the units produced. Marginal cost tells us the increase in total cost that arises from 
producing an additional unit of output. As we will see more fully in the next chapter, 
business managers like Conrad need to keep in mind the concepts of average total 
cost and marginal cost when deciding how much of their product to supply to the 
market.
13-3c Cost Curves and Their Shapes
Just as in previous chapters we found graphs of supply and demand useful when 
analyzing the behavior of markets, we will find graphs of average and marginal 
cost useful when analyzing the behavior of firms. Figure 4 graphs Conrad’s costs 
using the data from Table 2. The horizontal axis measures the quantity the firm 
produces, and the vertical axis measures marginal and average costs. The graph 
shows four curves: average total cost (ATC), average fixed cost (AFC), average 
variable cost (AVC), and marginal cost (MC).
The cost curves shown here for Conrad’s Coffee Shop have some features 
that are common to the cost curves of many firms in the economy. Let’s examine 
three features in particular: the shape of the marginal-cost curve, the shape of the 
­average-total-cost curve, and the relationship between marginal and average total 
cost.
Rising Marginal Cost  Conrad’s marginal cost rises as the quantity of out-
put produced increases. This upward slope reflects the property of diminishing 
marginal product. When Conrad produces a small quantity of coffee, he has few 
workers, and much of his equipment is not used. Because he can easily put these 
idle ­resources to use, the marginal product of an extra worker is large, and the 
average fixed cost

quantity of output

CHAPTER 13  THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION

­marginal cost of an extra cup of coffee is small. By contrast, when Conrad pro-
duces a large quantity of coffee, his shop is crowded with workers, and most of his 
equipment is fully utilized. Conrad can produce more coffee by adding workers, 
but these new workers have to work in crowded conditions and may have to wait 
to use the equipment. Therefore, when the quantity of coffee produced is already 
high, the marginal product of an extra worker is low, and the marginal cost of an 
extra cup of coffee is large.
U-Shaped Average Total Cost  Conrad’s average-total-cost curve is U-shaped, 
as shown in Figure 4. To understand why, remember that average total cost is the 
sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. Average fixed cost always de-
clines as output rises because the fixed cost is spread over a larger number of units. 
Average variable cost typically rises as output increases because of diminishing 
marginal product.
Average total cost reflects the shapes of both average fixed cost and average 
variable cost. At very low levels of output, such as 1 or 2 cups per hour, average 
total cost is very high. Even though average variable cost is low, average fixed 
cost is high because the fixed cost is spread over only a few units. As output in-
creases, the fixed cost is spread over more units. Average fixed cost declines, rap-
idly at first and then more slowly. As a result, average total cost also declines until 
the firm’s output reaches 5 cups of coffee per hour, when average total cost is 
$1.30 per cup. When the firm produces more than 6 cups per hour, however, the 
increase in average variable cost becomes the dominant force, and average total 
cost starts rising. The tug of war between average fixed cost and average variable 
cost generates the U-shape in average total cost.

Conrad’s Average-Cost and Marginal-
Cost Curves
This figure shows the average to-
tal cost (ATC), average fixed cost 
(AFC), average variable cost (AVC), 
and marginal cost (MC) for Conrad’s 
Coffee Shop. All of these curves 
are obtained by graphing the data 
in Table 2. These cost curves show 
three features that are typical of 
many firms: (1) Marginal cost rises 
with the quantity of output. (2) The 
average-total-cost curve is U-shaped. 
(3) The marginal-cost curve crosses 
the average-total-cost curve at the 
minimum of average total cost.

PART V	
FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
The bottom of the U-shape occurs at the quantity that minimizes average total 
cost. This quantity is sometimes called the efficient scale of the firm. For Conrad, 
the efficient scale is 5 or 6 cups of coffee per hour. If he produces more or less than 
this amount, his average total cost rises above the minimum of $1.30. At lower 
levels of output, average total cost is higher than $1.30 because the fixed cost is 
spread over so few units. At higher levels of output, average total cost is higher 
than $1.30 because the marginal product of inputs has diminished significantly. 
At the efficient scale, these two forces are balanced to yield the lowest average 
total cost.
The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost  If you 
look at Figure 4 (or back at Table 2), you will see something that may be surprising 
at first. Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost is falling. 
Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total cost is rising. This 
feature of Conrad’s cost curves is not a coincidence from the particular numbers 
used in the example: It is true for all firms.
To see why, consider an analogy. Average total cost is like your cumulative 
grade point average. Marginal cost is like the grade you get in the next course you 
take. If your grade in your next course is less than your grade point average, your 
grade point average will fall. If your grade in your next course is higher than 
your grade point average, your grade point average will rise. The mathematics of 
­average and marginal costs is exactly the same as the mathematics of average and 
marginal grades.
This relationship between average total cost and marginal cost has an im-
portant corollary: The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at its 
­minimum. Why? At low levels of output, marginal cost is below average total 
cost, so average total cost is falling. But after the two curves cross, marginal 
cost rises above average total cost. For the reason we have just discussed, av-
erage total cost must start to rise at this level of output. Hence, this point of 
intersection is the minimum of average total cost. As you will see in the next 
chapter, minimum average total cost plays a key role in the analysis of competi-
tive firms.
13-3d Typical Cost Curves
In the examples we have studied so far, the firms have exhibited diminishing 
marginal product and, therefore, rising marginal cost at all levels of output. 
This simplifying assumption was useful because it allowed us to focus on the 
key features of cost curves that are useful in analyzing firm behavior. Yet actual 
firms are usually more complicated than this. In many firms, marginal product 
does not start to fall immediately after the first worker is hired. Depending on 
the production process, the second or third worker might have a higher mar-
ginal product than the first because a team of workers can divide tasks and work 
more productively than a single worker. Firms exhibiting this pattern would ex-
perience increasing marginal product for a while before diminishing marginal 
­product set in.
Figure 5 shows the cost curves for such a firm, including average total cost 
(ATC), average fixed cost (AFC), average variable cost (AVC), and marginal cost 
(MC). At low levels of output, the firm experiences increasing marginal prod-
uct, and the marginal-cost curve falls. Eventually, the firm starts to experience 
diminishing marginal product, and the marginal-cost curve starts to rise. This 
combination of increasing then diminishing marginal product also makes the 
­average-variable-cost curve U-shaped.

Despite these differences from our previous example, the cost curves shown in 
Figure 5 share the three properties that are most important to remember:
•	 Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output.
•	 The average-total-cost curve is U-shaped.
•	 The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum 
of average total cost.

Cost Curves for a Typical Firm
Many firms experience increas-

As a result, they have cost 
curves shaped like those in this

a while before starting to rise.

13-4 Costs in the Short Run and in the Long Run
We noted earlier in this chapter that a firm’s costs might depend on the time hori-
zon under consideration. Let’s examine more precisely why this might be the case.
13-4a The Relationship between Short-Run 
and Long-Run Average Total Cost
For many firms, the division of total costs between fixed and variable costs de-
pends on the time horizon. Consider, for instance, a car manufacturer such as 
Ford Motor Company. Over a period of only a few months, Ford cannot adjust the 
number or sizes of its car factories. The only way it can produce additional cars is 
to hire more workers at the factories it already has. The cost of these factories is, 
therefore, a fixed cost in the short run. By contrast, over a period of several years, 
Ford can expand the size of its factories, build new factories, or close old ones. 
Thus, the cost of its factories is a variable cost in the long run.	 THETPRT

272 
PART V	
FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
Because many decisions are fixed in the short run but variable in the long run, 
a firm’s long-run cost curves differ from its short-run cost curves. Figure 6 shows 
an example. The figure presents three short-run average-total-cost curves—for a 
small, medium, and large factory. It also presents the long-run average-total-cost 
curve. As the firm moves along the long-run curve, it is adjusting the size of the 
factory to the quantity of production.
This graph shows how short-run and long-run costs are related. The long-run 
average-total-cost curve is a much flatter U-shape than the short-run average- 
total-cost curve. In addition, all the short-run curves lie on or above the long-run 
curve. These properties arise because firms have greater flexibility in the long run. 
In essence, in the long run, the firm gets to choose which short-run curve it wants 
to use. But in the short run, it has to use whatever short-run curve it has, based on 
decisions it has made in the past.
The figure shows an example of how a change in production alters costs over 
different time horizons. When Ford wants to increase production from 1,000 to 
1,200 cars per day, it has no choice in the short run but to hire more workers at its 
existing medium-sized factory. Because of diminishing marginal product, aver-
age total cost rises from $10,000 to $12,000 per car. In the long run, however, Ford 
can expand both the size of the factory and its workforce, and average total cost 
returns to $10,000.
How long does it take a firm to get to the long run? The answer depends on 
the firm. It can take a year or more for a major manufacturing firm, such as a car 
company, to build a larger factory. By contrast, a person running a coffee shop can 
buy another coffee maker within a few days. There is, therefore, no single answer 
to the question of how long it takes a firm to adjust its production facilities.
13-4b Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
The shape of the long-run average-total-cost curve conveys important informa-
tion about the production processes that a firm has available for manufacturing a 
good. In particular, it tells us how costs vary with the scale—that is, the size—of a 
firm’s operations. When long-run average total cost declines as output increases,

CHAPTER 13  THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION

there are said to be economies of scale. When long-run average total cost rises as 
output increases, there are said to be diseconomies of scale. When long-run aver-
age total cost does not vary with the level of output, there are said to be constant 
returns to scale. As we can see in Figure 6, Ford has economies of scale at low 
levels of output, constant returns to scale at intermediate levels of output, and 
diseconomies of scale at high levels of output.
What might cause economies or diseconomies of scale? Economies of scale of-
ten arise because higher production levels allow specialization among workers, 
which permits each worker to become better at a specific task. For instance, if 
Ford hires a large number of workers and produces a large number of cars, it can 
reduce costs using modern assembly-line production. Diseconomies of scale can 
arise because of coordination problems that are inherent in any large organization. 
The more cars Ford produces, the more stretched the management team becomes, 
and the less effective the managers become at keeping costs down.
This analysis shows why long-run average-total-cost curves are often U-shaped. 
At low levels of production, the firm benefits from increased size because it can 
take advantage of greater specialization. Coordination problems, meanwhile, are 
not yet acute. By contrast, at high levels of production, the benefits of specializa-
tion have already been realized, and coordination problems become more severe 
as the firm grows larger. Thus, long-run average total cost is falling at low levels 
of production because of increasing specialization and rising at high levels of pro-
duction because of the increasing prevalence of coordination problems.

Lessons from  
a Pin Factory
 J
ack of all trades, master of none.” This well-known adage sheds 
light on the nature of cost curves. A person who tries to do every-
thing usually ends up doing nothing very well. If a firm wants its work-
ers to be as productive as they can be, it is often best to give each 
worker a limited task that she can master. But this organization of work 
is possible only if a firm employs many workers and produces a large 
quantity of output.
In his celebrated book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the 
Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described a visit he made to a pin fac-
tory. Smith was impressed by the specialization among the workers and 
the resulting economies of scale. He wrote,
One man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a 
fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to 
make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on 
is a peculiar business; to whiten it is another; it is even a trade by 
itself to put them into paper.
Smith reported that because 
of this specialization, the pin  
factory produced thousands of pins per worker 
every day. He conjectured that if the workers had chosen to work sepa-
rately, rather than as a team of specialists, “they certainly could not each 
of them make twenty, perhaps not one pin a day.” In other words, because 
of specialization, a large pin factory could achieve higher output per 
worker and lower average cost per pin than a small pin factory.
The specialization that Smith observed in the pin factory is preva-
lent in the modern economy. If you want to build a house, for instance, 
you could try to do all the work yourself. But most people turn to a 
builder, who in turn hires carpenters, plumbers, electricians, painters, 
and many other types of workers. These workers focus their training and 
experience in particular jobs, and as a result, they become better at 
their jobs than if they were generalists. Indeed, the use of specialization 
to achieve economies of scale is one reason modern societies are as 
prosperous as they are.

13-5 Conclusion
The purpose of this chapter has been to develop some tools to study how firms 
make production and pricing decisions. You should now understand what econo-
mists mean by the term costs and how costs vary with the quantity of output a 
firm produces. To refresh your memory, Table 3 summarizes some of the defini-
tions we have encountered.
By themselves, a firm’s cost curves do not tell us what decisions the firm will 
make. But they are a key component of that decision, as we will see in the next 
chapter.

•	
The goal of firms is to maximize profit, which equals 
total revenue minus total cost.
•	
When analyzing a firm’s behavior, it is important to 
­include all the opportunity costs of production. Some 
of the opportunity costs, such as the wages a firm pays 
its workers, are explicit. Other opportunity costs, such 
as the wages the firm owner gives up by working at 
the firm rather than taking another job, are implicit. 
Economic profit takes both explicit and implicit costs 
into account, whereas accounting profit considers only 
explicit costs.
•	
A firm’s costs reflect its production process. A typical 
firm’s production function gets flatter as the quantity 
of an input increases, displaying the property of dimin-
ishing marginal product. As a result, a firm’s ­total-cost 
curve gets steeper as the quantity produced rises.

Questions for Review
•	
A firm’s total costs can be divided between fixed costs 
and variable costs. Fixed costs are costs that do not 
change when the firm alters the quantity of output 
produced. Variable costs are costs that change when 
the firm alters the quantity of output produced.
•	
From a firm’s total cost, two related measures of cost 
are derived. Average total cost is total cost divided by 
the quantity of output. Marginal cost is the amount by 
which total cost rises if output increases by 1 unit.
•	
When analyzing firm behavior, it is often useful to 
graph average total cost and marginal cost. For a 
typical firm, marginal cost rises with the quantity of 
output. Average total cost first falls as output ­increases 
and then rises as output increases further. The 
­marginal-cost curve always crosses the average-total-
cost curve at the minimum of average total cost.
•	
A firm’s costs often depend on the time horizon con-
sidered. In particular, many costs are fixed in the short 
run but variable in the long run. As a result, when the 
firm changes its level of production, average total cost 
may rise more in the short run than in the long run.

Firms in 
Competitive 
Markets
I
f your local gas station raised its price for gasoline by 20 percent, it would see 
a large drop in the amount of gasoline it sold. Its customers would quickly 
switch to buying their gasoline at other gas stations. By contrast, if your local 
water company raised the price of water by 20 percent, it would see only a small 
­decrease in the amount of water it sold. People might water their lawns less often 
and buy more water-efficient showerheads, but they would be hard-pressed to re-
duce water consumption greatly and would be unlikely to find another supplier. 
The difference between the gasoline market and the water market is that many 
firms supply gasoline to the local market, but only one firm supplies water. 
As you might expect, this difference in market structure shapes the pricing 
and production decisions of the firms that operate in these markets.
In this chapter, we examine the behavior of competitive firms, such as 
your local gas station. You may recall that a market is competitive if each buyer 
and seller is small compared to the size of the market and, therefore, has little

ability to influence market prices. By contrast, if a firm can influence the market 
price of the good it sells, it is said to have market power. Later in the book, we ex-
amine the behavior of firms with market power, such as your local water company.
Our analysis of competitive firms in this chapter sheds light on the decisions 
that lie behind the supply curve in a competitive market. Not surprisingly, we 
find that a market supply curve is tightly linked to firms’ costs of production. Less 
obvious, however, is the question of which among a firm’s many types of cost—
fixed, variable, average, and marginal—are most relevant for its supply decisions. 
We see that all these measures of cost play important and interrelated roles.
14-1 What Is a Competitive Market?
Our goal in this chapter is to examine how firms make production decisions in 
competitive markets. As a background for this analysis, we begin by reviewing 
what a competitive market is.
14-1a The Meaning of Competition
A competitive market, sometimes called a perfectly competitive market, has two 
characteristics:
•	 There are many buyers and many sellers in the market.
•	 The goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same.
As a result of these conditions, the actions of any single buyer or seller in the mar-
ket have a negligible impact on the market price. Each buyer and seller takes the 
market price as given.
As an example, consider the market for milk. No single consumer of milk can 
influence the price of milk because each buys a small amount relative to the size 
of the market. Similarly, each dairy farmer has limited control over the price be-
cause many other sellers are offering milk that is essentially identical. Because 
each seller can sell all he wants at the going price, he has little reason to charge 
less, and if he charges more, buyers will go elsewhere. Buyers and sellers in com-
petitive markets must accept the price the market determines and, therefore, are 
said to be price takers.
In addition to the previous two conditions for competition, a third condition is 
sometimes thought to characterize perfectly competitive markets:
•	 Firms can freely enter or exit the market.
If, for instance, anyone can decide to start a dairy farm, and if any existing dairy 
farmer can decide to leave the dairy business, then the dairy industry satisfies this 
condition. Much of the analysis of competitive firms does not need the assump-
tion of free entry and exit because this condition is not necessary for firms to be 
price takers. Yet, as we see later in this chapter, when there is free entry and exit 
in a competitive market, it is a powerful force shaping the long-run equilibrium.
14-1b The Revenue of a Competitive Firm
A firm in a competitive market, like most other firms in the economy, tries to max-
imize profit (total revenue minus total cost). To see how it does this, we first con-
sider the revenue of a competitive firm. To keep matters concrete, let’s consider a 
specific firm: the Vaca Family Dairy Farm.

CHAPTER 14  FIRMS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
281
The Vaca Farm produces a quantity of milk, Q, and sells each unit at the market 
price, P. The farm’s total revenue is P × Q. For example, if a gallon of milk sells 
for $6 and the farm sells 1,000 gallons, its total revenue is $6,000.
Because the Vaca Farm is small compared to the world market for milk, it takes 
the price as given by market conditions. This means, in particular, that the price 
of milk does not depend on the number of gallons that the Vaca Farm produces 
and sells. If the Vacas double the amount of milk they produce to 2,000 gallons, 
the price of milk remains the same, and their total revenue doubles to $12,000. As 
a result, total revenue is proportional to the amount of output.
Table 1 shows the revenue for the Vaca Family Dairy Farm. The first two col-
umns show the amount of output the farm produces and the price at which it sells 
its output. The third column is the farm’s total revenue. The table assumes that 
the price of milk is $6 a gallon, so total revenue is $6 times the number of gallons.
Just as the concepts of average and marginal were useful in the preceding 
chapter when analyzing costs, they are also useful when analyzing revenue. To 
see what these concepts tell us, consider these two questions:
•	 How much revenue does the farm receive for the typical gallon of milk?
•	 How much additional revenue does the farm receive if it increases production 
of milk by 1 gallon?
The last two columns in Table 1 answer these questions.
The fourth column in the table shows average revenue, which is total revenue 
(from the third column) divided by the amount of output (from the first column). 
Average revenue tells us how much revenue a firm receives for the typical unit 
sold. In Table 1, you can see that average revenue equals $6, the price of a gallon 
of milk. This illustrates a general lesson that applies not only to competitive firms 
but to other firms as well. Average revenue is total revenue (P × Q) divided by the 
quantity (Q). Therefore, for all types of firms, average revenue equals the price of the good.

The fifth column shows marginal revenue, which is the change in total rev-
enue from the sale of each additional unit of output. In Table 1, marginal revenue 
equals $6, the price of a gallon of milk. This result illustrates a lesson that applies 
only to competitive firms. Total revenue is P × Q, and P is fixed for a competitive 
firm. Therefore, when Q rises by 1 unit, total revenue rises by P dollars. For com-
petitive firms, marginal revenue equals the price of the good.

price of its output and its total revenue?
14-2 Profit Maximization and the Competitive 
Firm’s Supply Curve
The goal of a firm is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue minus total 
cost. We have just discussed the competitive firm’s revenue, and in the preceding 
chapter, we discussed the firm’s costs. We are now ready to examine how a com-
petitive firm maximizes profit and how that decision determines its supply curve.
14-2a A Simple Example of Profit Maximization
Let’s begin our analysis of the firm’s supply decision with the example in Table 2. 
In the first column of the table is the number of gallons of milk the Vaca Family 
Dairy Farm produces. The second column shows the farm’s total revenue, which 
is $6 times the number of gallons. The third column shows the farm’s total cost. 
Total cost includes fixed costs, which are $3 in this example, and variable costs, 
which depend on the quantity produced.
The fourth column shows the farm’s profit, which is computed by subtracting 
total cost from total revenue. If the farm produces nothing, it has a loss of $3 (its 
fixed cost). If it produces 1 gallon, it has a profit of $1. If it produces 2 gallons, it 
has a profit of $4 and so on. Because the Vaca family’s goal is to maximize profit, 
it chooses to produce the quantity of milk that makes profit as large as possible. In 
this example, profit is maximized when the farm produces either 4 or 5 gallons of 
milk, for a profit of $7.
There is another way to look at the Vaca Farm’s decision: The Vacas can find 
the profit-maximizing quantity by comparing the marginal revenue and marginal 
cost from each unit produced. The fifth and sixth columns in Table 2 compute 
marginal revenue and marginal cost from the changes in total revenue and total 
cost, and the last column shows the change in profit for each additional gallon 
produced. The first gallon of milk the farm produces has a marginal revenue of 
$6 and a marginal cost of $2; hence, producing that gallon increases profit by $4 
(from −$3 to $1). The second gallon produced has a marginal revenue of $6 and a 
marginal cost of $3, so that gallon increases profit by $3 (from $1 to $4). As long as 
marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, increasing the quantity produced raises 
profit. Once the Vaca Farm has reached 5 gallons of milk, however, the situation 
changes. The sixth gallon would have a marginal revenue of $6 and a marginal 
cost of $7, so producing it would reduce profit by $1 (from $7 to $6). As a result, 
the Vacas would not produce beyond 5 gallons.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that rational people think at 
the margin. We now see how the Vaca Family Dairy Farm can apply this principle. 
If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost—as it is at 1, 2, or 3 gallons—the 	OfI

283
Vacas should increase the production of milk because it will put more money in their 
pockets (marginal revenue) than it takes out (marginal cost). If marginal revenue is 
less than marginal cost—as it is at 6, 7, or 8 gallons—the Vacas should decrease pro-
duction. If the Vacas think at the margin and make incremental adjustments to the 
level of production, they end up producing the profit-maximizing quantity.
14-2b The Marginal-Cost Curve and the Firm’s 
Supply Decision
To extend this analysis of profit maximization, consider the cost curves in ­Figure 1. 
These cost curves have the three features that, as we discussed in the previous 
chapter, are thought to describe most firms: The marginal-cost curve (MC) is up-
ward sloping. The average-total-cost curve (ATC) is U-shaped. And the marginal-
cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum of average total 
cost. The figure also shows a horizontal line at the market price (P). The price line 
is horizontal because a competitive firm is a price taker: The price of the firm’s 
output is the same regardless of the quantity that the firm decides to produce. 
Keep in mind that, for a competitive firm, the firm’s price equals both its average 
revenue (AR) and its marginal revenue (MR).
We can use Figure 1 to find the quantity of output that maximizes profit. Imag-
ine that the firm is producing at Q1. At this level of output, the marginal-revenue 
curve is above the marginal-cost curve, showing that marginal revenue is greater 
than marginal cost. This means that if the firm were to raise production by 1 unit, 
the additional revenue (MR1) would exceed the additional cost (MC1). Profit, 
which equals total revenue minus total cost, would increase. Hence, if marginal 
revenue is greater than marginal cost, as it is at Q1, the firm can increase profit by 
increasing production.

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
A similar argument applies when output is at Q2. In this case, the marginal-cost 
curve is above the marginal-revenue curve, showing that marginal cost is greater than 
marginal revenue. If the firm were to reduce production by 1 unit, the costs saved 
(MC2) would exceed the revenue lost (MR2). Therefore, if marginal revenue is less 
than marginal cost, as it is at Q2, the firm can increase profit by reducing production.
Where do these marginal adjustments to production end? Regardless of whether 
the firm begins with production at a low level (such as Q1) or at a high level (such 
as Q2), the firm will eventually adjust production until the quantity produced 
reaches QMAX. This analysis yields three general rules for profit maximization:
•	 If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, the firm should increase its 
output.
•	 If marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue, the firm should decrease its 
output.
•	 At the profit-maximizing level of output, marginal revenue and marginal cost 
are exactly equal.
These rules are the key to rational decision making by any profit-maximizing 
firm. They apply not only to competitive firms but, as we will see in the next 
chapter, to other types of firms as well.
We can now see how the competitive firm decides what quantity of its good 
to supply to the market. Because a competitive firm is a price taker, its marginal 
revenue equals the market price. For any given price, the competitive firm’s

profit-maximizing quantity of output is found by looking at the intersection of the 
price with the marginal-cost curve. In Figure 1, that quantity of output is QMAX.
Suppose that the price prevailing in this market rises, perhaps because of an in-
crease in market demand. Figure 2 shows how a competitive firm responds to the 
price increase. When the price is P1, the firm produces quantity Q1, the quantity 
that equates marginal cost to the price. When the price rises to P2, the firm finds 
that marginal revenue is now higher than marginal cost at the previous level of 
output, so the firm increases production. The new profit-maximizing quantity is 
Q2, at which marginal cost equals the new, higher price. In essence, because the firm’s 
marginal-cost curve determines the quantity of the good the firm is willing to supply at 
any price, the marginal-cost curve is also the competitive firm’s supply curve. There are, 
however, some caveats to that conclusion, which we examine next.
14-2c The Firm’s Short-Run Decision to Shut Down
So far, we have been analyzing the question of how much a competitive firm will 
produce. In certain circumstances, however, the firm will decide to shut down 
and not produce anything at all.
Here we need to distinguish between a temporary shutdown of a firm and the 
permanent exit of a firm from the market. A shutdown refers to a short-run de-
cision not to produce anything during a specific period of time because of cur-
rent market conditions. Exit refers to a long-run decision to leave the market. The 
short-run and long-run decisions differ because most firms cannot avoid their 
fixed costs in the short run but can do so in the long run. That is, a firm that shuts 
down temporarily still has to pay its fixed costs, whereas a firm that exits the mar-
ket does not have to pay any costs at all, fixed or variable.
For example, consider the production decision that a farmer faces. The cost of 
the land is one of the farmer’s fixed costs. If the farmer decides not to produce any 
crops one season, the land lies fallow, and he cannot recover this cost. When making 
the short-run decision of whether to shut down for a season, the fixed cost of land is 
said to be a sunk cost. By contrast, if the farmer decides to leave farming altogether, 
he can sell the land. When making the long-run decision of whether to exit the mar-
ket, the cost of land is not sunk. (We return to the issue of sunk costs shortly.)
FIGURE 2
Marginal Cost as the Competi-

to P2 leads to an increase in the

any given price, it is the firm’s

Part V	
Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
Now let’s consider what determines a firm’s shutdown decision. If the firm 
shuts down, it loses all revenue from the sale of its product. At the same time, it 
saves the variable costs of making its product (but must still pay the fixed costs). 
Thus, the firm shuts down if the revenue that it would earn from producing is less than its 
variable costs of production.
A bit of mathematics can make this shutdown rule more useful. If TR stands 
for total revenue and VC stands for variable cost, then the firm’s decision can be 
written as
Shut down if TR , VC.
The firm shuts down if total revenue is less than variable cost. By dividing both 
sides of this inequality by the quantity Q, we can write it as
Shut down if TR/Q , VC/Q.
The left side of the inequality, TR/Q, is total revenue P × Q divided by quantity 
Q, which is average revenue, most simply expressed as the good’s price, P. The 
right side of the inequality, VC/Q, is average variable cost, AVC. Therefore, the 
firm’s shutdown rule can be restated as
Shut down if P , AVC.
That is, a firm chooses to shut down if the price of the good is less than the ­average 
variable cost of production. This criterion is intuitive: When choosing to produce, 
the firm compares the price it receives for the typical unit to the average vari-
able cost that it must incur to produce the typical unit. If the price doesn’t cover 
the ­average variable cost, the firm is better off stopping production altogether. 
The firm still loses money (because it has to pay fixed costs), but it would lose 
even more money by staying open. The firm can reopen in the future if conditions 
change so that price exceeds average variable cost.
We now have a full description of a competitive firm’s profit-maximizing strat-
egy. If the firm produces anything, it produces the quantity at which marginal 
cost equals the good’s price, which the firm takes as given. Yet if the price is less 
than average variable cost at that quantity, the firm is better off shutting down 
temporarily and not producing anything. These results are illustrated in Figure 3. 
The competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve 
that lies above average variable cost.
14-2d Spilt Milk and Other Sunk Costs
Sometime in your life you may have been told, “Don’t cry over spilt milk,” or 
“Let bygones be bygones.” These adages hold a deep truth about rational decision 
making. Economists say that a cost is a sunk cost when it has already been com-
mitted and cannot be recovered. Because nothing can be done about sunk costs, 
you should ignore them when making decisions about various aspects of life, 
­including business strategy.
Our analysis of the firm’s shutdown decision is one example of the irrelevance 
of sunk costs. We assume that the firm cannot recover its fixed costs by tempo-
rarily stopping production. That is, regardless of the quantity of output supplied 
(even if it is zero), the firm still has to pay its fixed costs. As a result, the fixed 
costs are sunk in the short run, and the firm should ignore them when decid-
ing how much to produce. The firm’s short-run supply curve is the part of the 
sunk cost

been committed and 
cannot be recovered	OfI

marginal-cost curve that lies above average variable cost, and the size of the fixed 
cost does not matter for this supply decision.
The irrelevance of sunk costs is also important when making personal deci-
sions. Imagine, for instance, that you place a $15 value on seeing a newly released 
movie. You buy a ticket for $10, but before entering the theater, you lose the ticket. 
Should you buy another ticket? Or should you now go home and refuse to pay a 
total of $20 to see the movie? The answer is that you should buy another ticket. 
The benefit of seeing the movie ($15) still exceeds the opportunity cost (the $10 for 
the second ticket). The $10 you paid for the lost ticket is a sunk cost. As with spilt 
milk, there is no point in crying about it.

Near-Empty Restaurants and Off-Season Miniature Golf
Have you ever walked into a restaurant for lunch and found it almost 
empty? Why, you might have asked, does the restaurant even bother to 
stay open? It might seem that the revenue from so few customers could not 
possibly cover the cost of running the restaurant.
In making the decision of whether to open for lunch, a restaurant owner must 
keep in mind the distinction between fixed and variable costs. Many of a restau-
rant’s costs—the rent, kitchen equipment, tables, plates, silverware, and so on—
are fixed. Shutting down during lunch would not reduce these costs. In other 
words, these costs are sunk in the short run. When the owner is deciding whether 
to serve lunch, only the variable costs—the price of the additional food and the 
wages of the extra staff—are relevant. The owner shuts down the restaurant at 
lunchtime only if the revenue from the few lunchtime customers fails to cover the 
restaurant’s variable costs.
An operator of a miniature-golf course in a summer resort community faces a 
similar decision. Because revenue varies substantially from season to season, the 
firm must decide when to open and when to close. Once again, the fixed costs—
the costs of buying the land and building the course—are irrelevant in making 
this short-run decision. The miniature-golf course should be open for business 
only during those times of year when its revenue exceeds its variable costs.

14-2e The Firm’s Long-Run Decision 
to Exit or Enter a Market
A firm’s long-run decision to exit a market is similar to its shutdown decision. If 
the firm exits, it will again lose all revenue from the sale of its product, but now it 
will save not only its variable costs of production but also its fixed costs. Thus, the 
firm exits the market if the revenue it would get from producing is less than its total costs.
We can again make this criterion more useful by writing it mathematically. If 
TR stands for total revenue, and TC stands for total cost, then the firm’s exit rule 
can be written as
Exit if TR , TC.
The firm exits if total revenue is less than total cost. By dividing both sides of this 
inequality by quantity Q, we can write it as
Exit if TR/Q , TC/Q.
We can simplify this further by noting that TR/Q is average revenue, which 
equals the price P, and that TC/Q is average total cost, ATC. Therefore, the firm’s 
exit rule is
Exit if P , ATC.
That is, a firm chooses to exit if the price of its good is less than the average total 
cost of production.
A parallel analysis applies to an entrepreneur who is considering starting a firm. 
He will enter the market if starting a firm would be profitable, which occurs if the 
price of the good exceeds the average total cost of production. The entry rule is
Enter if P . ATC.
The rule for entry is exactly the opposite of the rule for exit.
We can now describe a competitive firm’s long-run profit-maximizing strat-
egy. If the firm produces anything, it chooses the quantity at which marginal cost 
equals the price of the good. Yet if the price is less than the average total cost at 
that quantity, the firm chooses to exit (or not enter) the market. These results are 
illustrated in Figure 4. The competitive firm’s long-run supply curve is the portion of its 
marginal-cost curve that lies above average total cost.
14-2f Measuring Profit in Our Graph 
for the Competitive Firm
As we study exit and entry, it is useful to analyze the firm’s profit in more detail. 
Recall that profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total cost (TC):
Profit 5 TR 2 TC.
We can rewrite this definition by multiplying and dividing the right side by Q:
Profit 5 (TR/Q 2 TC/Q) 3 Q.	OfI

CHAPTER 14  FIRMS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
289
But note that TR/Q is average revenue, which is the price, P, and TC/Q is average 
total cost, ATC. Therefore,
Profit 5 (P 2 ATC) 3 Q.
This way of expressing the firm’s profit allows us to measure profit in our graphs.
Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows a firm earning positive profit. As we have already 
discussed, the firm maximizes profit by producing the quantity at which price 
equals marginal cost. Now look at the shaded rectangle. The height of the rect-
angle is P − ATC, the difference between price and average total cost. The width 
of the rectangle is Q, the quantity produced. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 
(P − ATC) × Q, which is the firm’s profit.
Similarly, panel (b) of Figure 5 shows a firm with losses (negative profit). In this 
case, maximizing profit means minimizing losses, a task accomplished once again 
by producing the quantity at which price equals marginal cost. Now consider the 
shaded rectangle. The height of the rectangle is ATC − P, and the width is Q. The 
area is (ATC − P) × Q, which is the firm’s loss. Because a firm in this situation is 
not making enough revenue on each unit to cover its average total cost, it would 
choose to exit the market in the long run.

the number of firms can change as old firms exit the market and new firms enter. 
Both cases are important, for each applies to a specific time horizon. Over short 
periods of time, it is often difficult for firms to enter and exit, so the assumption of 
a fixed number of firms is appropriate. But over long periods of time, the number 
of firms can adjust to changing market conditions.
14-3a The Short Run: Market Supply with a Fixed 
Number of Firms
Consider first a market with 1,000 identical firms. For any given price, each firm 
supplies a quantity of output so that its marginal cost equals the price, as shown in 
panel (a) of Figure 6. That is, as long as price is above average variable cost, each 
firm’s marginal-cost curve is its supply curve. The quantity of output supplied to 
the market equals the sum of the quantities supplied by each of the 1,000 individual 
firms. Thus, to derive the market supply curve, we add the quantity supplied by each 
firm in the market. As panel (b) of Figure 6 shows, because the firms are identical, the 
quantity supplied to the market is 1,000 times the quantity supplied by each firm.
14-3b The Long Run: Market Supply with Entry and Exit
Now consider what happens if firms are able to enter or exit the market. Let’s 
suppose that everyone has access to the same technology for producing the good 
and access to the same markets to buy the inputs for production. Therefore, all 
current and potential firms have the same cost curves.
Decisions about entry and exit in a market of this type depend on the incen-
tives facing the owners of existing firms and the entrepreneurs who could start 
new firms. If firms already in the market are profitable, then new firms will have 
an incentive to enter the market. This entry will expand the number of firms, 
FIGURE 5
The area of the shaded box between price and average total cost represents the firm’s 
profit. The height of this box is price minus average total cost (P − ATC), and the 
width of the box is the quantity of output (Q). In panel (a), price is above average total 
cost, so the firm has positive profit. In panel (b), price is less than average total cost, 
so the firm incurs a loss.

increase the quantity of the good supplied, and drive down prices and profits. 
Conversely, if firms in the market are making losses, then some existing firms will 
exit the market. Their exit will reduce the number of firms, decrease the quantity 
of the good supplied, and drive up prices and profits. At the end of this process of 
entry and exit, firms that remain in the market must be making zero economic profit.
Recall that we can write a firm’s profit as
Profit 5 (P 2 ATC) 3 Q.
This equation shows that an operating firm has zero profit if and only if the 
price of the good equals the average total cost of producing that good. If price is 
above average total cost, profit is positive, which encourages new firms to enter. 
If price is less than average total cost, profit is negative, which encourages some 
firms to exit. The process of entry and exit ends only when price and average total cost 
are driven to equality.
This analysis has a surprising implication. We noted earlier in the chapter that 
competitive firms maximize profits by choosing a quantity at which price equals 
marginal cost. We just noted that free entry and exit force price to equal average total 
cost. But if price is to equal both marginal cost and average total cost, these two mea-
sures of cost must equal each other. Marginal cost and average total cost are equal, 
however, only when the firm is operating at the minimum of average total cost. 
Recall from the preceding chapter that the level of production with lowest average 
total cost is called the firm’s efficient scale. Therefore, in the long-run equilibrium of a 
competitive market with free entry and exit, firms must be operating at their efficient scale.
Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows a firm in such a long-run equilibrium. In this fig-
ure, price P equals marginal cost MC, so the firm is maximizing profit. Price also 
equals average total cost ATC, so profit is zero. New firms have no incentive to 
enter the market, and existing firms have no incentive to leave the market.
FIGURE 6
In the short run, the number of firms in the market is fixed. As a result, the market ­supply 
curve, shown in panel (b), reflects the individual firms’ marginal-cost curves, shown in 
panel (a). Here, in a market of 1,000 firms, the quantity of output supplied to the market is 
1,000 times the quantity supplied by each firm.

Part V	
Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
From this analysis of firm behavior, we can determine the long-run supply 
curve for the market. In a market with free entry and exit, there is only one price 
consistent with zero profit—the minimum of average total cost. As a result, the 
long-run market supply curve must be horizontal at this price, as illustrated by 
the perfectly elastic supply curve in panel (b) of Figure 7. Any price above this 
level would generate profit, leading to entry and an increase in the total quantity 
supplied. Any price below this level would generate losses, leading to exit and 
a decrease in the total quantity supplied. Eventually, the number of firms in the 
market adjusts so that price equals the minimum of average total cost, and there 
are enough firms to satisfy all the demand at this price.
14-3c Why Do Competitive Firms Stay in Business 
If They Make Zero Profit?
At first, it might seem odd that competitive firms earn zero profit in the long run. 
After all, people start businesses to make a profit. If entry eventually drives profit 
to zero, there might seem to be little reason to stay in business.
To understand the zero-profit condition more fully, recall that profit equals to-
tal revenue minus total cost and that total cost includes all the opportunity costs 
of the firm. In particular, total cost includes the time and money that the firm 
owners devote to the business. In the zero-profit equilibrium, the firm’s revenue 
must compensate the owners for these opportunity costs.
Consider an example. Suppose that, to start his farm, a farmer had to invest  
$1 million, which otherwise he could have deposited in a bank and earned $50,000 
a year in interest. In addition, he had to give up another job that would have paid 
him $30,000 a year. Then the farmer’s opportunity cost of farming includes both 
the interest he could have earned and the forgone wages—a total of $80,000. Even 
if his profit is driven to zero, his revenue from farming compensates him for these 
opportunity costs.
FIGURE 7
In the long run, firms will enter or exit the market until profit is driven to zero. As a ­result, 
price equals the minimum of average total cost, as shown in panel (a). The number of 
firms adjusts to ensure that all demand is satisfied at this price. The long-run market 
­supply curve is horizontal at this price, as shown in panel (b).

Keep in mind that accountants and economists measure costs differently. As 
we discussed in the previous chapter, accountants keep track of explicit costs but 
not implicit costs. That is, they measure costs that require an outflow of money 
from the firm, but they do not include the opportunity costs of production that 
do not involve an outflow of money. As a result, in the zero-profit equilibrium, 
economic profit is zero, but accounting profit is positive. Our farmer’s accoun-
tant, for instance, would conclude that the farmer earned an accounting profit of 
$80,000, which is enough to keep the farmer in business.
14-3d A Shift in Demand in the Short Run 
and Long Run
Now that we have a more complete understanding of how firms make supply 
decisions, we can better explain how markets respond to changes in demand. 
­Because firms can enter and exit in the long run but not in the short run, the re-
sponse of a market to a change in demand depends on the time horizon. To see 
this, let’s trace the effects of a shift in demand over time.
Suppose the market for milk begins in a long-run equilibrium. Firms are earn-
ing zero profit, so price equals the minimum of average total cost. Panel (a) of 
­Figure 8 shows this situation. The long-run equilibrium is point A, the quantity 
sold in the market is Q1, and the price is P1.
Now suppose scientists discover that milk has miraculous health benefits. As 
a result, the quantity of milk demanded at every price increases, and the demand 
curve for milk shifts outward from D1 to D2, as in panel (b) of Figure 8. The short-
run equilibrium moves from point A to point B; as a result, the quantity rises from 
Q1 to Q2, and the price rises from P1 to P2. All of the existing firms respond to 
the higher price by raising the amount they produce. Because each firm’s supply 
curve ­reflects its marginal-cost curve, how much each firm increases production 
is ­determined by the marginal-cost curve. In the new short-run equilibrium, the 
price of milk exceeds average total cost, so the firms are making positive profit.
Over time, the profit generated in this market encourages new firms to enter. 
Some farmers may switch to producing milk instead of other farm products, for 
example. As the number of firms grows, the quantity supplied at every price in-
creases, the short-run supply curve shifts to the right from S1 to S2, as in panel (c) 
of Figure 8, and this shift causes the price of milk to fall. Eventually, the price 
is driven back down to the minimum of average total cost, profits are zero, and 
firms stop entering. Thus, the market reaches a new long-run equilibrium, point C. 
The price of milk has returned to P1, but the quantity produced has risen to Q3. 
Each firm is again producing at its efficient scale, but because more firms are in 
the dairy business, the quantity of milk produced and sold is higher.
14-3e Why the Long-Run Supply Curve 
Might Slope Upward
So far, we have seen that entry and exit can cause the long-run market supply curve 
to be perfectly elastic. The essence of our analysis is that there are a large number 
of potential entrants, each of which faces the same costs. As a result, the long-run 
market supply curve is horizontal at the minimum of average total cost. When the 
demand for the good increases, the long-run result is an increase in the number of 
firms and in the total quantity supplied, without any change in the price.
There are, however, two reasons that the long-run market supply curve might 
slope upward. The first is that some resources used in production may be available 
only in limited quantities. For example, consider the market for farm products.

FIGURE 8
The market starts in a long-run equilibrium, shown as point A in panel (a). In this equilibrium, 
each firm makes zero profit, and the price equals the minimum average total cost. Panel (b) 
shows what happens in the short run when demand rises from D1 to D2. The equilibrium goes from 
point A to point B, price rises from P1 to P2, and the quantity sold in the market rises from Q1 to 
Q2. Because price now exceeds average total cost, each firm now makes a profit, which over time 
encourages new firms to enter the market. This entry shifts the short-run supply curve to the right 
from S1 to S2, as shown in panel (c). In the new long-run equilibrium, point C, price has returned 
to P1 but the quantity sold has increased to Q3. Profits are again zero, and price is back to the 
minimum of average total cost, but the market has more firms to satisfy the greater demand.

CHAPTER 14  FIRMS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
295
Anyone can choose to buy land and start a farm, but the quantity of land is lim-
ited. As more people become farmers, the price of farmland is bid up, which raises 
the costs of all farmers in the market. Thus, an increase in demand for farm prod-
ucts cannot induce an increase in quantity supplied without also inducing a rise in 
farmers’ costs, which in turn means a rise in price. The result is a long-run market 
supply curve that is upward sloping, even with free entry into farming.
A second reason for an upward-sloping supply curve is that firms may have dif-
ferent costs. For example, consider the market for painters. Anyone can enter the 
market for painting services, but not everyone has the same costs. Costs vary in 
part because some people work faster than others and in part because some people 
have better alternative uses of their time than others. For any given price, those 
with lower costs are more likely to enter than those with higher costs. To increase 
the quantity of painting services supplied, additional entrants must be encouraged 
to enter the market. Because these new entrants have higher costs, the price must 
rise to make entry profitable for them. Thus, the long-run market supply curve for 
painting services slopes upward even with free entry into the market.
Notice that if firms have different costs, some firms earn profit even in the 
long run. In this case, the price in the market reflects the average total cost of the 
­marginal firm—the firm that would exit the market if the price were any lower. 
This firm earns zero profit, but firms with lower costs earn positive profit. Entry 
does not eliminate this profit because would-be entrants have higher costs than 
firms already in the market. Higher-cost firms will enter only if the price rises, 
making the market profitable for them.
Thus, for these two reasons, a higher price may be necessary to induce a larger 
quantity supplied, in which case the long-run supply curve is upward sloping 
rather than horizontal. Nonetheless, the basic lesson about entry and exit remains 
true. Because firms can enter and exit more easily in the long run than in the short run, 
the long-run supply curve is typically more elastic than the short-run supply curve.
Quick Quiz  In the long run with free entry and exit, is the price in a market equal to 
marginal cost, average total cost, both, or neither? Explain with a diagram.
14-4 Conclusion: Behind the Supply Curve
We have been discussing the behavior of profit-maximizing firms that supply 
goods in perfectly competitive markets. You may recall from Chapter 1 that one 
of the Ten Principles of Economics is that rational people think at the margin. This 
chapter has applied this idea to the competitive firm. Marginal analysis has given 
us a theory of the supply curve in a competitive market and, as a result, a deeper 
understanding of market outcomes.
We have learned that when you buy a good from a firm in a competitive mar-
ket, you can be assured that the price you pay is close to the cost of producing that 
good. In particular, if firms are competitive and profit maximizing, the price of a 
good equals the marginal cost of making that good. In addition, if firms can freely 
enter and exit the market, the price also equals the lowest possible average total 
cost of production.
Although we have assumed throughout this chapter that firms are price takers, 
many of the tools developed here are also useful for studying firms in less com-
petitive markets. We now turn to examining the behavior of firms with market 
power. Marginal analysis will again be useful, but it will have quite different im-
plications for a firm’s production decisions and for the nature of market outcomes.	hpe IRMSINOMPETITIVEMARETS

Questions for Review
  1.	 What are the main characteristics of a competitive 
market?
  2.	 Explain the difference between a firm’s revenue and 
its profit. Which do firms maximize?
  3.	 Draw the cost curves for a typical firm. Explain how 
a competitive firm chooses the level of output that 
­maximizes profit. At that level of output, show on 
your graph the firm’s total revenue and total costs.
  4.	 Under what conditions will a firm shut down 
­temporarily? Explain.
  5.	 Under what conditions will a firm exit a market? 
Explain.
  6.	 Does a competitive firm’s price equal its marginal cost 
in the short run, in the long run, or both? Explain.
  7.	 Does a competitive firm’s price equal the minimum of 
its average total cost in the short run, in the long run, 
or both? Explain.
  8.	 Are market supply curves typically more elastic in the 
short run or in the long run? Explain.
•	
Because a competitive firm is a price taker, its revenue 
is proportional to the amount of output it produces. 
The price of the good equals both the firm’s average 
revenue and its marginal revenue.
•	
To maximize profit, a firm chooses a quantity of out-
put such that marginal revenue equals marginal cost. 
­Because marginal revenue for a competitive firm 
equals the market price, the firm chooses quantity so 
that price equals marginal cost. Thus, the firm’s mar-
ginal-cost curve is its supply curve.
•	
In the short run when a firm cannot recover its fixed 
costs, the firm will choose to shut down temporarily if 
the price of the good is less than average variable cost. 
In the long run when the firm can recover both fixed 
and variable costs, it will choose to exit if the price is 
less than average total cost.
•	
In a market with free entry and exit, profit is driven 
to zero in the long run. In this long-run equilibrium, 
all firms produce at the efficient scale, price equals the 
minimum of average total cost, and the number of firms 
adjusts to satisfy the quantity demanded at this price.
•	
Changes in demand have different effects over dif-
ferent time horizons. In the short run, an increase 
in ­demand raises prices and leads to profits, and a 
­decrease in demand lowers prices and leads to losses. 
But if firms can freely enter and exit the market, then in 
the long run, the number of firms adjusts to drive the 
market back to the zero-profit equilibrium.

f you own a personal computer, it probably uses some version of Windows, 
the operating system sold by the Microsoft Corporation. When Microsoft first 
­designed Windows many years ago, it applied for and received a copyright 
from the government. The copyright gives Microsoft the exclusive right to make 
and sell copies of the Windows operating system. If a person wants to buy a copy 
of Windows, she has little choice but to give Microsoft the approximately $100 
that the firm has decided to charge for its product. Microsoft is said to have a 
­monopoly in the market for Windows.
Microsoft’s business decisions are not well described by the model of firm 
behavior we developed in the previous chapter. In that chapter, we analyzed 
competitive markets, in which many firms offer essentially identical prod-
ucts, so each firm has little influence over the price it receives. By contrast, a 
monopoly such as Microsoft has no close competitors and, therefore, has the

power to influence the market price of its product. Whereas a competitive firm is 
a price taker, a monopoly firm is a price maker.
In this chapter, we examine the implications of this market power. We will see 
that market power alters the relationship between a firm’s costs and the price at 
which it sells its product. A competitive firm takes the price of its output as given 
by the market and then chooses the quantity it will supply so that price equals 
marginal cost. By contrast, a monopoly charges a price that exceeds marginal cost. 
This result is clearly true in the case of Microsoft’s Windows. The marginal cost of 
Windows—the extra cost that Microsoft incurs by printing one more copy of the 
program onto a CD—is only a few dollars. The market price of Windows is many 
times its marginal cost.
It is not surprising that monopolies charge high prices for their products. 
­Customers of monopolies might seem to have little choice but to pay whatever 
the monopoly charges. But if so, why does a copy of Windows not cost $1,000? 
Or $10,000? The reason is that if Microsoft were to set the price that high, fewer 
people would buy the product. People would buy fewer computers, switch to 
other operating systems, or make illegal copies. A monopoly firm can control the 
price of the good it sells, but because a high price reduces the quantity that its cus-
tomers buy, the monopoly’s profits are not unlimited.
As we examine the production and pricing decisions of monopolies, we also 
consider the implications of monopoly for society as a whole. Monopoly firms, 
like competitive firms, aim to maximize profit. But this goal has very different 
ramifications for competitive and monopoly firms. In competitive markets, self-
interested consumers and producers reach an equilibrium that promotes ­general 
economic well-being, as if guided by an invisible hand. By contrast, because 
­monopoly firms are unchecked by competition, the outcome in a market with a 
monopoly is often not in the best interest of society.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can 
sometimes improve market outcomes. The analysis in this chapter sheds more 
light on this principle. As we examine the problems that monopolies raise for 
society, we discuss the various ways in which government policymakers might 
respond to these problems. The U.S. government, for example, keeps a close 
eye on Microsoft’s business decisions. In 1994, it blocked Microsoft from buying 
­Intuit, a leading seller of personal finance software, on the grounds that combin-
ing the two firms would concentrate too much market power. Similarly, in 1998, 
the U.S. Department of Justice objected when Microsoft started integrating its 
Internet browser into its Windows operating system, claiming that this addition 
would extend the firm’s market power into new areas. In recent years, regulators 
in the United States and abroad have shifted their focus to firms with growing 
market power, such as Google and Samsung, but they also continue to monitor 
­Microsoft’s compliance with the antitrust laws.

not have close substitutes. The fundamental cause of monopoly is barriers to entry: 
A monopoly remains the only seller in its market because other firms cannot enter 
the market and compete with it. Barriers to entry, in turn, have three main sources:
•	 Monopoly resources: A key resource required for production is owned by a 
single firm.	OfI

•	 Government regulation: The government gives a single firm the exclusive right 
to produce some good or service.
•	 The production process: A single firm can produce output at a lower cost than 
can a larger number of firms.
Let’s briefly discuss each of these.
15-1a Monopoly Resources
The simplest way for a monopoly to arise is for a single firm to own a key ­resource. 
For example, consider the market for water in a small town in the Old West. If 
dozens of town residents have working wells, the competitive model discussed 
in the preceding chapter describes the behavior of sellers. As a result of the com-
petition among water suppliers, the price of a gallon is driven to equal the mar-
ginal cost of pumping an extra gallon. But if there is only one well in town and 
it is impossible to get water from anywhere else, then the owner of the well has 
a monopoly on water. Not surprisingly, the monopolist has much greater market 
power than any single firm in a competitive market. In the case of a necessity like 
water, the monopolist can command quite a high price, even if the marginal cost 
of pumping an extra gallon is low.
A classic example of market power arising from the ownership of a key 
­resource is DeBeers, the South African diamond company. Founded in 1888 by 
Cecil Rhodes, an English businessman (and benefactor for the Rhodes scholar-
ship), ­DeBeers has at times controlled up to 80 percent of the production from 
the world’s diamond mines. Because its market share is less than 100 percent, 
­DeBeers is not exactly a monopoly, but the company has nonetheless exerted sub-
stantial influence over the market price of diamonds.
Although exclusive ownership of a key resource is a potential cause of monop-
oly, in practice monopolies rarely arise for this reason. Economies are large, and 
resources are owned by many people. Indeed, because many goods are traded 
internationally, the natural scope of their markets is often worldwide. There are, 
therefore, few examples of firms that own a resource for which there are no close 
substitutes.
15-1b Government-Created Monopolies
In many cases, monopolies arise because the government has given one person 
or firm the exclusive right to sell some good or service. Sometimes the monopoly 
arises from the sheer political clout of the would-be monopolist. Kings, for exam-
ple, once granted exclusive business licenses to their friends and allies. At other 
times, the government grants a monopoly because doing so is viewed to be in the 
public interest.
The patent and copyright laws are two important examples. When a phar-
maceutical company discovers a new drug, it can apply to the government for 
a ­patent. If the government deems the drug to be truly original, it approves the 
patent, which gives the company the exclusive right to manufacture and sell the 
drug for 20 years. Similarly, when a novelist finishes a book, she can copyright it. 
The copyright is a government guarantee that no one can print and sell the work 
without the author’s permission. The copyright makes the novelist a monopolist 
in the sale of her novel.
The effects of patent and copyright laws are easy to see. Because these laws 
give one producer a monopoly, they lead to higher prices than would occur under 
competition. But by allowing these monopoly producers to charge higher prices 
and earn higher profits, the laws also encourage some desirable behavior. Drug 
“Rather than a 
­monopoly, we like to 
consider ourselves ‘the 
only game in town.’”

companies are allowed to be monopolists in the drugs they discover to encour-
age research. Authors are allowed to be monopolists in the sale of their books to 
encourage them to write more and better books.
Thus, the laws governing patents and copyrights have benefits and costs. The 
benefits of the patent and copyright laws are the increased incentives for creative 
activity. These benefits are offset, to some extent, by the costs of monopoly ­pricing, 
which we examine fully later in this chapter.
15-1c Natural Monopolies
An industry is a natural monopoly when a single firm can supply a good or 
­service to an entire market at a lower cost than could two or more firms. A natu-
ral monopoly arises when there are economies of scale over the relevant range of 
output. Figure 1 shows the average total costs of a firm with economies of scale. In 
this case, a single firm can produce any amount of output at the least cost. That is, 
for any given amount of output, a larger number of firms leads to less output per 
firm and higher average total cost.
An example of a natural monopoly is the distribution of water. To provide 
­water to residents of a town, a firm must build a network of pipes throughout the 
town. If two or more firms were to compete in the provision of this service, each 
firm would have to pay the fixed cost of building a network. Thus, the average 
total cost of water is lowest if a single firm serves the entire market.
We saw other examples of natural monopolies when we discussed public 
goods and common resources in Chapter 11. We noted that club goods are exclud-
able but not rival in consumption. An example is a bridge used so infrequently 
that it is never congested. The bridge is excludable because a toll collector can 
prevent someone from using it. The bridge is not rival in consumption because 
use of the bridge by one person does not diminish the ability of others to use it. 
Because there is a large fixed cost of building the bridge and a negligible marginal 
cost of additional users, the average total cost of a trip across the bridge (the total 
cost divided by the number of trips) falls as the number of trips rises. Hence, the 
bridge is a natural monopoly.
When a firm is a natural monopoly, it is less concerned about new entrants erod-
ing its monopoly power. Normally, a firm has trouble maintaining a monopoly

Economies of Scale as a Cause of Monopoly
When a firm’s average-total-cost curve 
­continually declines, the firm has what is 
called a natural monopoly. In this case, when 
­production is divided among more firms, each 
firm produces less, and average total cost rises. 
As a result, a single firm can produce any given 
amount at the least cost.

position without ownership of a key resource or protection from the government. 
The monopolist’s profit attracts entrants into the market, and these entrants make 
the market more competitive. By contrast, entering a market in which another 
firm has a natural monopoly is unattractive. Would-be entrants know that they 
cannot achieve the same low costs that the monopolist enjoys because, after entry, 
each firm would have a smaller piece of the market.
In some cases, the size of the market is one determinant of whether an industry 
is a natural monopoly. Again, consider a bridge across a river. When the popula-
tion is small, the bridge may be a natural monopoly. A single bridge can satisfy 
the entire demand for trips across the river at lowest cost. Yet as the population 
grows and the bridge becomes congested, satisfying the entire demand may 
­require two or more bridges across the same river. Thus, as a market expands, a 
natural ­monopoly can evolve into a more competitive market.

15-2 How Monopolies Make Production and Pricing Decisions
Now that we know how monopolies arise, we can consider how a monopoly firm 
decides how much of its product to make and what price to charge for it. The 
analysis of monopoly behavior in this section is the starting point for evaluating 
whether monopolies are desirable and what policies the government might pur-
sue in monopoly markets.
15-2a Monopoly versus Competition
The key difference between a competitive firm and a monopoly is the monopoly’s 
ability to influence the price of its output. A competitive firm is small relative to 
the market in which it operates and, therefore, has no power to influence the price 
of its output. It takes the price as given by market conditions. By contrast, because 
a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, it can alter the price of its good by 
adjusting the quantity it supplies to the market.
One way to view this difference between a competitive firm and a monopoly 
is to consider the demand curve that each firm faces. When we analyzed profit 
maximization by competitive firms in the preceding chapter, we drew the market 
price as a horizontal line. Because a competitive firm can sell as much or as little 
as it wants at this price, the competitive firm faces a horizontal demand curve, as 
in panel (a) of Figure 2. In effect, because the competitive firm sells a product with 
many perfect substitutes (the products of all the other firms in its market), the 
­demand curve that any one firm faces is perfectly elastic.
By contrast, because a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, its demand 
curve is the market demand curve. Thus, the monopolist’s demand curve slopes 
downward for all the usual reasons, as in panel (b) of Figure 2. If the monopolist 
raises the price of its good, consumers buy less of it. Looked at another way, if the 
monopolist reduces the quantity of output it produces and sells, the price of its 
output increases.
The market demand curve provides a constraint on a monopoly’s ability to 
profit from its market power. A monopolist would prefer, if it were possible, to 
charge a high price and sell a large quantity at that high price. The market demand 	hpe l

curve makes that outcome impossible. In particular, the market demand curve 
­describes the combinations of price and quantity that are available to a monopoly 
firm. By adjusting the quantity produced (or equivalently, the price charged), the 
monopolist can choose any point on the demand curve, but it cannot choose a 
point off the demand curve.
What price and quantity of output will the monopolist choose? As with com-
petitive firms, we assume that the monopolist’s goal is to maximize profit. Because 
the firm’s profit is total revenue minus total costs, our next task in ­explaining 
­monopoly behavior is to examine a monopolist’s revenue.
15-2b A Monopoly’s Revenue
Consider a town with a single producer of water. Table 1 shows how the monopo-
ly’s revenue might depend on the amount of water produced.
The first two columns show the monopolist’s demand schedule. If the monop-
olist produces 1 gallon of water, it can sell that gallon for $10. If it produces 2 gal-
lons, it must lower the price to $9 to sell both gallons. If it produces 3 gallons, it 
must lower the price to $8. And so on. If you graphed these two columns of num-
bers, you would get a typical downward-sloping demand curve.
The third column of the table presents the monopolist’s total revenue. It equals the 
quantity sold (from the first column) times the price (from the second column). The 
fourth column computes the firm’s average revenue, the amount of ­revenue the firm 
receives per unit sold. We compute average revenue by taking the number for total 
revenue in the third column and dividing it by the quantity of output in the first 
column. As we discussed in the previous chapter, average revenue always equals 
the price of the good. This is true for monopolists as well as for competitive firms.
The last column of Table 1 computes the firm’s marginal revenue, the amount 
of revenue that the firm receives for each additional unit of output. We compute 
FIGURE 2
Because competitive firms are price takers, they in effect face horizontal demand 
curves, as in panel (a). Because a monopoly firm is the sole producer in its market, 
it faces the downward-sloping market demand curve, as in panel (b). As a result, the 
monopoly has to accept a lower price if it wants to sell more output.

marginal revenue by taking the change in total revenue when output increases by 
1 unit. For example, when the firm is producing 3 gallons of water, it receives ­total 
revenue of $24. Raising production to 4 gallons increases total revenue to $28. 
Thus, marginal revenue from the sale of the fourth gallon is $28 minus $24, or $4.
Table 1 shows a result that is important for understanding monopoly behavior: 
A monopolist’s marginal revenue is always less than the price of its good. For ­example, 
if the firm raises production of water from 3 to 4 gallons, it will increase total 
revenue by only $4, even though it will be able to sell each gallon for $7. For a 
monopoly, marginal revenue is lower than price because a monopoly faces a 
downward-sloping demand curve. To increase the amount sold, a monopoly firm 
must lower the price it charges to all customers. Hence, to sell the fourth gallon of 
­water, the monopolist will get $1 less revenue for each of the first 3 gallons. This 
$3 loss accounts for the difference between the price of the fourth gallon ($7) and 
the marginal revenue of that fourth gallon ($4).
Marginal revenue for monopolies is very different from marginal revenue for 
competitive firms. When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, this action has 
two effects on total revenue (P × Q):
•	 The output effect: More output is sold, so Q is higher, which tends to increase 
total revenue.
•	 The price effect: The price falls, so P is lower, which tends to decrease total 
revenue.
Because a competitive firm can sell all it wants at the market price, there is no 
price effect. When it increases production by 1 unit, it receives the market price for

that unit, and it does not receive any less for the units it was already selling. That 
is, because the competitive firm is a price taker, its marginal revenue equals the 
price of its good. By contrast, when a monopoly increases production by 1 unit, it 
must reduce the price it charges for every unit it sells, and this cut in price reduces 
revenue on the units it was already selling. As a result, a monopoly’s marginal 
revenue is less than its price.
Figure 3 graphs the demand curve and the marginal-revenue curve for a mo-
nopoly firm. (Because the firm’s price equals its average revenue, the demand 
curve is also the average-revenue curve.) These two curves always start at the 
same point on the vertical axis because the marginal revenue of the first unit sold 
equals the price of the good. But for the reason we just discussed, the monopo-
list’s marginal revenue on all units after the first is less than the price of the good. 
Thus, a monopoly’s marginal-revenue curve lies below its demand curve.
You can see in Figure 3 (as well as in Table 1) that marginal revenue can even 
become negative. Marginal revenue is negative when the price effect on revenue 
is greater than the output effect. In this case, when the firm produces an extra unit 
of output, the price falls by enough to cause the firm’s total revenue to decline, 
even though the firm is selling more units.
15-2c Profit Maximization
Now that we have considered the revenue of a monopoly firm, we are ready to 
examine how such a firm maximizes profit. Recall from Chapter 1 that one of the 
Ten Principles of Economics is that rational people think at the margin. This lesson 
is as true for monopolists as it is for competitive firms. Here we apply the logic of 
marginal analysis to the monopolist’s decision about how much to produce.
Figure 4 graphs the demand curve, the marginal-revenue curve, and the cost 
curves for a monopoly firm. All these curves should seem familiar: The demand 
and marginal-revenue curves are like those in Figure 3, and the cost curves are 
like those we encountered in the last two chapters. These curves contain all the 
information we need to determine the level of output that a profit-maximizing 
monopolist will choose.
FIGURE 3
Demand and Marginal-Revenue 
Curves for a Monopoly
The demand curve shows how the 
quantity affects the price of the good. 
The marginal-revenue curve shows 
how the firm’s revenue changes when 
the quantity increases by 1 unit. 
­Because the price on all units sold 
must fall if the monopoly increases 
production, marginal revenue is 
­always less than the price.

CHAPTER 15  MONOPOLY
307
Suppose, first, that the firm is producing at a low level of output, such as Q1. 
In this case, marginal cost is less than marginal revenue. If the firm increased pro-
duction by 1 unit, the additional revenue would exceed the additional costs, and 
profit would rise. Thus, when marginal cost is less than marginal revenue, the 
firm can increase profit by producing more units.
A similar argument applies at high levels of output, such as Q2. In this case, 
marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue. If the firm reduced produc-
tion by 1 unit, the costs saved would exceed the revenue lost. Thus, if mar-
ginal cost is greater than marginal revenue, the firm can raise profit by reducing 
production.
In the end, the firm adjusts its level of production until the quantity reaches 
QMAX, at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Thus, the monopolist’s 
profit-maximizing quantity of output is determined by the intersection of the marginal-
revenue curve and the marginal-cost curve. In Figure 4, this intersection occurs at 
point A.
You might recall from the previous chapter that competitive firms also choose 
the quantity of output at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In follow-
ing this rule for profit maximization, competitive firms and monopolies are alike. 
But there is also an important difference between these types of firms: The mar-
ginal revenue of a competitive firm equals its price, whereas the marginal revenue 
of a monopoly is less than its price. That is,
For a competitive firm: P = MR = MC.
For a monopoly firm:    P > MR = MC.
The equality of marginal revenue and marginal cost determines the profit-­
maximizing quantity for both types of firm. What differs is how the price is 
­related to marginal revenue and marginal cost.
FIGURE 4
Profit Maximization for a Monopoly
A monopoly maximizes profit by 
choosing the quantity at which 
­marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost (point A). It then uses the

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
How does the monopoly find the profit-maximizing price for its product? 
The demand curve answers this question because the demand curve relates the 
amount that customers are willing to pay to the quantity sold. Thus, after the 
­monopoly firm chooses the quantity of output that equates marginal revenue and 
marginal cost, it uses the demand curve to find the highest price it can charge for 
that quantity. In Figure 4, the profit-maximizing price is found at point B.
We can now see a key difference between markets with competitive firms and 
markets with a monopoly firm: In competitive markets, price equals marginal cost. In 
monopolized markets, price exceeds marginal cost. As we will see in a moment, this 
finding is crucial to understanding the social cost of monopoly.
15-2d A Monopoly’s Profit
How much profit does a monopoly make? To see a monopoly firm’s profit in a 
graph, recall that profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total costs (TC):
Profit = TR − TC.
We can rewrite this as
Profit = (TR/Q − TC/Q) × Q.
TR/Q is average revenue, which equals the price, P, and TC/Q is average total 
cost, ATC. Therefore,
Profit = (P − ATC) × Q.
This equation for profit (which also holds for competitive firms) allows us to mea-
sure the monopolist’s profit in our graph.
Consider the shaded box in Figure 5. The height of the box (the segment BC) 
is price minus average total cost, P − ATC, which is the profit on the typical unit 
Why a Monopoly Does Not 
Have a Supply Curve
Y
ou may have noticed that we have analyzed the price in a monopoly 
market using the market demand curve and the firm’s cost curves. 
We have not made any mention of the market supply curve. By contrast, 
when we analyzed prices in competitive markets beginning in ­Chapter 4, 
the two most important words were always supply and demand.
What happened to the supply curve? Although monopoly firms make 
decisions about what quantity to supply (in the way described in this 
chapter), a monopoly does not have a supply curve. A supply curve 
tells us the quantity that firms choose to supply at any given price. This 
concept makes sense when we are analyzing competitive firms, which 
are price takers. But a monopoly firm is a price maker, not a price taker. 
It is not meaningful to ask what amount such a firm would produce at 
any price because the firm 
sets the price at the same 
time as it chooses the quan-
tity to supply.
Indeed, the monopolist’s decision about how much to supply is 
impossible to separate from the demand curve it faces. The shape 
of the demand curve determines the shape of the marginal-revenue 
curve, which in turn determines the monopolist’s profit-maximizing 
quantity. In a competitive market, supply decisions can be ana-
lyzed without knowing the demand curve, but that is not true in 
a ­monopoly market. Therefore, we never talk about a monopoly’s 
­supply curve.

Monopoly Drugs versus Generic Drugs
According to our analysis, prices are determined differently in 
­monopolized markets and competitive markets. A natural place to test 
this theory is the market for pharmaceutical drugs because this market takes 
on both market structures. When a firm discovers a new drug, patent laws give 
the firm a monopoly on the sale of that drug. But eventually, the firm’s patent 
runs out, and any company can make and sell the drug. At that time, the market 
switches from being monopolistic to being competitive.
What should happen to the price of a drug when the patent runs out? Figure 6 
shows the market for a typical drug. In this figure, the marginal cost of produc-
ing the drug is constant. (This is approximately true for many drugs.) During the 
life of the patent, the monopoly firm maximizes profit by producing the quantity 
at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost and charging a price well above 
marginal cost. But when the patent runs out, the profit from making the drug 
should encourage new firms to enter the market. As the market becomes more 
competitive, the price should fall to equal marginal cost.
Experience is, in fact, consistent with our theory. When the patent on a drug 
expires, other companies quickly enter and begin selling so-called generic prod-
ucts that are chemically identical to the former monopolist’s brand-name product. 
And just as our analysis predicts, the price of the competitively produced generic 
drug is well below the price that the monopolist was charging.
The expiration of a patent, however, does not cause the monopolist to lose all 
its market power. Some consumers remain loyal to the brand-name drug, per-
haps out of fear that the new generic drugs are not actually the same as the drug 
case

For example, one of the most widely used antidepressants is the drug fluox-

expired in 2001, a consumer today has the choice between the original drug, sold 
under the brand name Prozac, and a generic version of the same medicine. Prozac 
sells for about three times the price of generic fluoxetine. This price differential 
can persist because some consumers are not convinced that the two pills are per-
fect substitutes. 
Quick Quiz  Explain how a monopolist chooses the quantity of output to produce and 
the price to charge.
Is monopoly a good way to organize a market? We have seen that a monopoly, 
in contrast to a competitive firm, charges a price above marginal cost. From the 
standpoint of consumers, this high price makes monopoly undesirable. At the 
same time, however, the monopoly is earning profit from charging this high price. 
From the standpoint of the owners of the firm, the high price makes monopoly 
very desirable. Is it possible that the benefits to the firm’s owners exceed the costs 
imposed on consumers, making monopoly desirable from the standpoint of soci-
ety as a whole?
We can answer this question using the tools of welfare economics. Recall from 
Chapter 7 that total surplus measures the economic well-being of buyers and 
sellers in a market. Total surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer 
­surplus. Consumer surplus is consumers’ willingness to pay for a good minus 	OfI

the amount they actually pay for it. Producer surplus is the amount producers 
receive for a good minus their costs of producing it. In this case, there is a single 
producer—the monopolist.
You can probably guess the result of this analysis. In Chapter 7, we concluded 
that the equilibrium of supply and demand in a competitive market is not only a 
natural outcome but also a desirable one. The invisible hand of the market leads 
to an allocation of resources that makes total surplus as large as it can be. ­Because 
a monopoly leads to an allocation of resources different from that in a competi-
tive market, the outcome must, in some way, fail to maximize total economic 
well-being.
15-3a The Deadweight Loss
We begin by considering what the monopoly firm would do if it were run by a 
­benevolent social planner. The social planner cares not only about the profit 
earned by the firm’s owners but also about the benefits received by the firm’s 
consumers. The planner tries to maximize total surplus, which equals producer 
surplus (profit) plus consumer surplus. Keep in mind that total surplus equals the 
value of the good to consumers minus the costs of making the good incurred by 
the monopoly producer.
Figure 7 analyzes how a benevolent social planner would choose the 
­monopoly’s level of output. The demand curve reflects the value of the good to 
consumers, as measured by their willingness to pay for it. The marginal-cost curve 
reflects the costs of the monopolist. Thus, the socially efficient quantity is found where 
the demand curve and the marginal-cost curve intersect. Below this quantity, the value 
FIGURE 7
The Efficient Level of Output
A benevolent social planner 
­maximizes total surplus in the 
­market by choosing the level of 
­output where the demand curve and  
the marginal-cost curve intersect.  
Below this level, the value of the good 
to the marginal buyer (as reflected  
in the demand curve) ­exceeds  
the ­marginal cost of making the  
good. Above this level, the value  
to the marginal buyer is less than  
the marginal cost.

of an extra unit to consumers exceeds the cost of providing it, so increasing out-
put would raise total surplus. Above this quantity, the cost of producing an extra 
unit exceeds the value of that unit to consumers, so decreasing output would raise 
total surplus. At the optimal quantity, the value of an extra unit to consumers 
­exactly equals the marginal cost of production.
If the social planner were running the monopoly, the firm could achieve this 
efficient outcome by charging the price found at the intersection of the demand 
and marginal-cost curves. Thus, like a competitive firm and unlike a profit-­
maximizing monopoly, a social planner would charge a price equal to marginal 
cost. Because this price would give consumers an accurate signal about the cost of 
producing the good, consumers would buy the efficient quantity.
We can evaluate the welfare effects of monopoly by comparing the level of out-
put that the monopolist chooses to the level of output that a social planner would 
choose. As we have seen, the monopolist chooses to produce and sell the quantity 
of output at which the marginal-revenue and marginal-cost curves intersect; the 
social planner would choose the quantity at which the demand and marginal-cost 
curves intersect. Figure 8 shows the comparison. The monopolist produces less than 
the socially efficient quantity of output.
We can also view the inefficiency of monopoly in terms of the monopolist’s 
price. Because the market demand curve describes a negative relationship 
­between the price and quantity of the good, a quantity that is inefficiently low is 
equivalent to a price that is inefficiently high. When a monopolist charges a price 
above marginal cost, some potential consumers value the good at more than its 
marginal cost but less than the monopolist’s price. These consumers do not buy 
the good. Because the value these consumers place on the good is greater than the 
cost of providing it to them, this result is inefficient. Thus, monopoly pricing pre-
vents some mutually beneficial trades from taking place.
The inefficiency of monopoly can be measured with a deadweight loss trian-
gle, as illustrated in Figure 8. Because the demand curve reflects the value to con-
sumers and the marginal-cost curve reflects the costs to the monopoly producer, 
FIGURE 8
The Inefficiency of Monopoly
Because a monopoly charges a 
price above marginal cost, not all 
consumers who value the good at 
more than its cost buy it. Thus, 
the quantity produced and sold by 
a monopoly is below the socially 
­efficient level. The deadweight 
loss is represented by the area of 
the triangle between the demand 
curve (which reflects the value 
of the good to consumers) and 
the ­marginal-cost curve (which 
reflects the costs of the monopoly 
producer).

the area of the deadweight loss triangle between the demand curve and the 
­marginal-cost curve equals the total surplus lost because of monopoly pricing. It 
is the ­reduction in economic well-being that results from the monopoly’s use of its 
market power.
The deadweight loss caused by monopoly is similar to the deadweight loss 
caused by a tax. Indeed, a monopolist is like a private tax collector. As we saw 
in Chapter 8, a tax on a good places a wedge between consumers’ willingness to 
pay (as reflected by the demand curve) and producers’ costs (as reflected by the 
supply curve). Because a monopoly exerts its market power by charging a price 
above marginal cost, it creates a similar wedge. In both cases, the wedge causes 
the quantity sold to fall short of the social optimum. The difference between the 
two cases is that the government gets the revenue from a tax, whereas a private 
firm gets the monopoly profit.
15-3b The Monopoly’s Profit: A Social Cost?
It is tempting to decry monopolies for “profiteering” at the expense of the public. 
And indeed, a monopoly firm does earn a profit by virtue of its market power. 
­According to the economic analysis of monopoly, however, the firm’s profit is not 
in itself necessarily a problem for society.
Welfare in a monopolized market, like all markets, includes the welfare of both 
consumers and producers. Whenever a consumer pays an extra dollar to a pro-
ducer because of a monopoly price, the consumer is worse off by a dollar and the 
producer is better off by the same amount. This transfer from the consumers of the 
good to the owners of the monopoly does not affect the market’s total ­surplus—
the sum of consumer and producer surplus. In other words, the monopoly profit 
itself represents not a reduction in the size of the economic pie but merely a big-
ger slice for producers and a smaller slice for consumers. Unless consumers are 
for some reason more deserving than producers—a normative judgment about 
equity that goes beyond the realm of economic efficiency—the monopoly profit is 
not a social problem.
The problem in a monopolized market arises because the firm produces and 
sells a quantity of output below the level that maximizes total surplus. The 
deadweight loss measures how much the economic pie shrinks as a result. This 
­inefficiency is connected to the monopoly’s high price: Consumers buy fewer units 
when the firm raises its price above marginal cost. But keep in mind that the profit 
earned on the units that continue to be sold is not the problem. The problem stems 
from the inefficiently low quantity of output. Put differently, if the high ­monopoly 
price did not discourage some consumers from buying the good, it would raise 
producer surplus by exactly the amount it reduced consumer surplus, leaving 
­total surplus the same as could be achieved by a benevolent social planner.
There is, however, a possible exception to this conclusion. Suppose that a 
­monopoly firm has to incur additional costs to maintain its monopoly position. 
For example, a firm with a government-created monopoly might need to hire lob-
byists to convince lawmakers to continue its monopoly. In this case, the monopoly 
may use up some of its monopoly profits paying for these additional costs. If so, 
the social loss from monopoly includes both these costs and the deadweight loss 
resulting from reduced output.

output that maximizes total surplus? How does this difference relate to the concept of dead-
weight loss?	hpe l

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
15-4 Price Discrimination
So far, we have been assuming that the monopoly firm charges the same price to 
all customers. Yet in many cases, firms sell the same good to different customers 
for different prices, even though the costs of producing for the two customers are 
the same. This practice is called price discrimination.
Before discussing the behavior of a price-discriminating monopolist, we should 
note that price discrimination is not possible when a good is sold in a competi-
tive market. In a competitive market, many firms are selling the same good at the 
market price. No firm is willing to charge a lower price to any customer because 
the firm can sell all it wants at the market price. And if any firm tried to charge a 
higher price to a customer, that customer would buy from another firm. For a firm 
to price discriminate, it must have some market power.
15-4a A Parable about Pricing
To understand why a monopolist would price discriminate, let’s consider an 
example. Imagine that you are the president of Readalot Publishing Company. 
Readalot’s best-selling author has just written a new novel. To keep things simple, 
let’s imagine that you pay the author a flat $2 million for the exclusive rights to 
publish the book. Let’s also assume that the cost of printing the book is zero (as it 
would be, for example, for an e-book). Readalot’s profit, therefore, is the revenue 
from selling the book minus the $2 million it has paid to the author. Given these 
assumptions, how would you, as Readalot’s president, decide the book’s price?
Your first step is to estimate the demand for the book. Readalot’s marketing 
department tells you that the book will attract two types of readers. The book will 
appeal to the author’s 100,000 die-hard fans who are willing to pay as much as 
$30. In addition, the book will appeal to about 400,000 less enthusiastic readers 
who will pay up to $5.
If Readalot charges a single price to all customers, what price maximizes 
profit? There are two natural prices to consider: $30 is the highest price Readalot 
can charge and still get the 100,000 die-hard fans, and $5 is the highest price it 
can charge and still get the entire market of 500,000 potential readers. Solving 
Readalot’s problem is a matter of simple arithmetic. At a price of $30, Readalot 
sells 100,000 copies, has revenue of $3 million, and makes profit of $1 million. At 
a price of $5, it sells 500,000 copies, has revenue of $2.5 million, and makes profit 
of $500,000. Thus, Readalot maximizes profit by charging $30 and forgoing the 
­opportunity to sell to the 400,000 less enthusiastic readers.
Notice that Readalot’s decision causes a deadweight loss. There are 400,000 
readers willing to pay $5 for the book, and the marginal cost of providing it to 
them is zero. Thus, $2 million of total surplus is lost when Readalot charges 
the higher price. This deadweight loss is the inefficiency that arises whenever a 
­monopolist charges a price above marginal cost.
Now suppose that Readalot’s marketing department makes a discovery: These 
two groups of readers are in separate markets. The die-hard fans live in Australia, 
and the other readers live in the United States. Moreover, it is hard for readers in 
one country to buy books in the other.
In response to this discovery, Readalot can change its marketing strategy and 
increase profits. To the 100,000 Australian readers, it can charge $30 for the book. 
To the 400,000 American readers, it can charge $5 for the book. In this case, rev-
enue is $3 million in Australia and $2 million in the United States, for a total

of $5 million. Profit is then $3 million, which is substantially greater than the 
$1 ­million the company could earn charging the same $30 price to all customers. 
Not surprisingly, Readalot chooses to follow this strategy of price discrimination.
The story of Readalot Publishing is hypothetical, but it describes accurately 
the business practice of many publishing companies. Textbooks, for example, are 
­often sold at a lower price in Europe than in the United States. Even more impor-
tant is the price differential between hardcover books and paperbacks. When a 
publisher has a new novel, it initially releases an expensive hardcover edition and 
later ­releases a cheaper paperback edition. The difference in price between these 
two editions far exceeds the difference in printing costs. The publisher’s goal is 
just as in our example. By selling the hardcover to die-hard fans and the paperback 
to less enthusiastic readers, the publisher price discriminates and raises its profit.
15-4b The Moral of the Story
Like any parable, the story of Readalot Publishing is stylized. Yet also like any 
parable, it teaches some general lessons. In this case, three lessons can be learned 
about price discrimination.
The first and most obvious lesson is that price discrimination is a rational 
strategy for a profit-maximizing monopolist. That is, by charging different prices 
to different customers, a monopolist can increase its profit. In essence, a price-­
discriminating monopolist charges each customer a price closer to her willingness 
to pay than is possible with a single price.
The second lesson is that price discrimination requires the ability to separate 
customers according to their willingness to pay. In our example, customers were 
separated geographically. But sometimes monopolists choose other differences, 
such as age or income, to distinguish among customers.
A corollary to this second lesson is that certain market forces can prevent firms 
from price discriminating. In particular, one such force is arbitrage, the process 
of buying a good in one market at a low price and selling it in another market 
at a higher price to profit from the price difference. In our example, if ­Australian 
bookstores could buy the book in the United States and resell it to Australian 
readers, the arbitrage would prevent Readalot from price discriminating, because 
no ­Australian would buy the book at the higher price.
The third lesson from our parable is the most surprising: Price discrimination 
can raise economic welfare. Recall that a deadweight loss arises when Readalot 
charges a single $30 price because the 400,000 less enthusiastic readers do not end 
up with the book, even though they value it at more than its marginal cost of 
­production. By contrast, when Readalot price discriminates, all readers get the 
book, and the outcome is efficient. Thus, price discrimination can eliminate the 
inefficiency inherent in monopoly pricing.
Note that in this example the increase in welfare from price discrimination 
shows up as higher producer surplus rather than higher consumer surplus. 
­Consumers are no better off for having bought the book: The price they pay 
­exactly equals the value they place on the book, so they receive no consumer 
surplus. The entire increase in total surplus from price discrimination accrues to 
Readalot Publishing in the form of higher profit.
15-4c The Analytics of Price Discrimination
Let’s consider a bit more formally how price discrimination affects economic wel-
fare. We begin by assuming that the monopolist can price discriminate perfectly. 
Perfect price discrimination describes a situation in which the monopolist knows 	hpe l

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
exactly each customer’s willingness to pay and can charge each customer a differ-
ent price. In this case, the monopolist charges each customer exactly her willing-
ness to pay, and the monopolist gets the entire surplus in every transaction.
Figure 9 illustrates producer and consumer surplus with and without price dis-
crimination. To keep things simple, this figure is drawn assuming constant per 
unit costs—that is, marginal cost and average total cost are constant and equal. 
Without price discrimination, the firm charges a single price above marginal cost, 
as shown in panel (a). Because some potential customers who value the good at 
more than marginal cost do not buy it at this high price, the monopoly causes a 
deadweight loss. Yet when a firm can perfectly price discriminate, as shown in 
panel (b), each customer who values the good at more than marginal cost buys 
the good and is charged her willingness to pay. All mutually beneficial trades take 
place, no deadweight loss occurs, and the entire surplus derived from the market 
goes to the monopoly producer in the form of profit.
In reality, of course, price discrimination is not perfect. Customers do not 
walk into stores with signs displaying their willingness to pay. Instead, firms 
price discriminate by dividing customers into groups: young versus old, week-
day versus weekend shoppers, Americans versus Australians, and so on. Unlike 
those in our parable of Readalot Publishing, customers within each group differ 
in their willingness to pay for the product, making perfect price discrimination 
impossible.
How does this imperfect price discrimination affect welfare? The analysis of 
these pricing schemes is complicated, and it turns out that there is no general 
FIGURE 9
Panel (a) shows a monopoly that charges the same price to all customers. Total surplus 
in this market equals the sum of profit (producer surplus) and consumer surplus. Panel 
(b) shows a monopoly that can perfectly price discriminate. Because consumer surplus 
equals zero, total surplus now equals the firm’s profit. Comparing these two panels, you 
can see that perfect price discrimination raises profit, raises total surplus, and lowers 
consumer surplus.

answer to this question. Compared to the monopoly outcome with a single price, 
imperfect price discrimination can raise, lower, or leave unchanged total surplus 
in a market. The only certain conclusion is that price discrimination raises the 
monopoly’s profit; otherwise, the firm would choose to charge all customers the 
same price.
15-4d Examples of Price Discrimination
Firms in our economy use various business strategies aimed at charging differ-
ent prices to different customers. Now that we understand the economics of price 
­discrimination, let’s consider some examples.
Movie Tickets  Many movie theaters charge a lower price for children and sen-
ior citizens than for other patrons. This fact is hard to explain in a competitive 
market. In a competitive market, price equals marginal cost, and the marginal cost 
of providing a seat for a child or senior citizen is the same as the marginal cost of 
providing a seat for anyone else. Yet the differential pricing is easily explained 
if movie theaters have some local monopoly power and if children and senior 
­citizens have a lower willingness to pay for a ticket. In this case, movie theaters 
raise their profit by price discriminating.
Airline Prices  Seats on airplanes are sold at many different prices. Most airlines 
charge a lower price for a round-trip ticket between two cities if the traveler stays 
over a Saturday night. At first, this seems odd. Why should it matter to the air-
line whether a passenger stays over a Saturday night? The reason is that this rule 
­provides a way to separate business travelers and leisure travelers. A passenger on 
a business trip has a high willingness to pay and, most likely, does not want to stay 
over a Saturday night. By contrast, a passenger traveling for personal reasons has 
a lower willingness to pay and is more likely to be willing to stay over a Saturday 
night. Thus, the airlines can successfully price discriminate by charging a lower 
price for passengers who stay over a Saturday night.
Discount Coupons  Many companies offer discount coupons to the public in 
newspapers, magazines, or online. A buyer simply has to clip the coupon to get 
$0.50 off her next purchase. Why do companies offer these coupons? Why don’t 
they just cut the price of the product by $0.50?
The answer is that coupons allow companies to price discriminate. Companies 
know that not all customers are willing to spend time clipping coupons. Moreover, 
the willingness to clip coupons is related to the customer’s willingness to pay for 
the good. A rich and busy executive is unlikely to spend her time clipping dis-
count coupons out of the newspaper, and she is probably willing to pay a higher 
price for many goods. A person who is unemployed is more likely to clip coupons 
and to have a lower willingness to pay. Thus, by charging a lower price only to 
those customers who clip coupons, firms can successfully price discriminate.
Financial Aid  Many colleges and universities give financial aid to needy 
­students. One can view this policy as a type of price discrimination. Wealthy 
­students have greater financial resources and, therefore, a higher willingness to 
pay than needy students. By charging high tuition and selectively offering ­financial 
aid, schools in effect charge prices to customers based on the value they place on 
­going to that school. This behavior is similar to that of any price-discriminating 
­monopolist.

Quantity Discounts  So far in our examples of price discrimination, the 
­monopolist charges different prices to different customers. Sometimes, however, 
monopolists price discriminate by charging different prices to the same customer 
for different units that the customer buys. For example, many firms offer lower 
prices to customers who buy large quantities. A bakery might charge $0.50 for 
each donut but $5 for a dozen. This is a form of price discrimination because the 
customer pays a higher price for the first unit bought than for the twelfth. Quantity 
discounts are often a successful way of price discriminating because a customer’s 
willingness to pay for an additional unit declines as the customer buys more units.
Misconceptions 101: 
Why College Costs 
Aren’t Soaring
By Evan Soltas
C
onventional wisdom suggests that U.S. 
colleges and universities have become 
sharply more expensive in recent years.
“When kids do graduate, the most daunt-
ing challenge can be the cost of college,” 
President Barack Obama said in his 2012 
State of the Union address. “We can’t just 
keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll 
run out of money.”
At first, the view that the cost of college 
is rising appears to have data on its side. 
­Published tuition prices and fees at colleges 
have risen three times faster than the rate of 
Consumer Price Index inflation since 1978, 
­according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. . . .
Real tuition and fees have increased, to 
be sure, but hardly as significantly as the 
media often report or the data suggest at 
face value. The inflation-adjusted net price 
of college has risen only modestly over the 
last two decades, according to data from the 
­College Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges.
What has happened is a shift toward price 
discrimination—offering multiple prices for 
the same product. Universities have offset 
the increase in sticker price for most families 
through an expansion of grant-based finan-
cial aid and scholarships. That has caused 
the BLS measure to rise without increasing 
the net cost.
Wealthier families now pay more than 
ever to send their children to college. But for 
much of the middle class, the real net cost 
of college has not changed significantly; for 
much of the poor, the expansion of aid has 
­increased the accessibility and affordability 
of a college education. . . .
The nation’s most selective institutions 
are leading the trend toward income-based 
price discrimination. For example, at Harvard 
University, the majority of students receive 
­financial aid: In 2012, one year of undergrad-
uate education had a sticker price of $54,496 
and came with an average grant of roughly 
$41,000.
In other words, the cost burden of college 
has become significantly more progressive 
since the 1990s. Students from wealthier 
families not only now pay more for their own 
educations but also have come to heavily 
subsidize the costs of the less fortunate.

15-5 Public Policy toward Monopolies
We have seen that monopolies, in contrast to competitive markets, fail to allocate 
resources efficiently. Monopolies produce less than the socially desirable quantity 
of output and charge prices above marginal cost. Policymakers in the government 
can respond to the problem of monopoly in one of four ways:
•	 By trying to make monopolized industries more competitive.
•	 By regulating the behavior of the monopolies.
•	 By turning some private monopolies into public enterprises.
•	 By doing nothing at all.
15-5a Increasing Competition with Antitrust Laws
If Coca-Cola and PepsiCo wanted to merge, the deal would be closely examined 
by the federal government before it went into effect. The lawyers and economists 
in the Department of Justice might well decide that a merger between these two 
large soft-drink companies would make the U.S. soft-drink market substantially 
less competitive and, as a result, would reduce the economic well-being of the 
country as a whole. If so, the Department of Justice would challenge the merger in 
court, and if the judge agreed, the two companies would not be allowed to merge. 
It is precisely this kind of challenge that prevented software giant Microsoft from 
buying Intuit in 1994.
The government derives this power over private industry from the antitrust 
laws, a collection of statutes aimed at curbing monopoly power. The first and most 
important of these laws was the Sherman Antitrust Act, which Congress passed 
in 1890 to reduce the market power of the large and powerful “trusts” that were 
viewed as dominating the economy at the time. The Clayton Antitrust Act, passed 
in 1914, strengthened the government’s powers and authorized private lawsuits. 
As the U.S. Supreme Court once put it, the antitrust laws are “a comprehensive 
charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered competition 
as the rule of trade.”
The antitrust laws give the government various ways to promote competition. 
They allow the government to prevent mergers, such as our hypothetical merger 
between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. They also allow the government to break up 
companies. For example, in 1984, the government split up AT&T, the large tele-
communications company, into eight smaller companies. Finally, the antitrust 
laws prevent companies from coordinating their activities in ways that make mar-
kets less competitive.
Antitrust laws have costs as well as benefits. Sometimes companies merge not to 
reduce competition but to lower costs through more efficient joint production. These 
benefits from mergers are sometimes called synergies. For example, many U.S. banks 
have merged in recent years and, by combining operations, have been able to ­reduce 
administrative staff. If antitrust laws are to raise social welfare, the government 
must be able to determine which mergers are desirable and which are not. That is, it 
must be able to measure and compare the social benefit from synergies with the social 
costs of reduced competition. Critics of the antitrust laws are skeptical that the gov-
ernment can perform the necessary cost–benefit analysis with sufficient accuracy.
15-5b Regulation
Another way the government deals with the problem of monopoly is by regulat-
ing the behavior of monopolists. This solution is common in the case of natural 
“But if we do merge with 
Amalgamated, we’ll have 
enough resources to fight 
the antitrust violation 
caused by the merger.”

monopolies, such as water and electric companies. These companies are not al-
lowed to charge any price they want. Instead, government agencies regulate their 
prices.
What price should the government set for a natural monopoly? This question 
is not as easy as it might at first appear. One might conclude that the price should 
equal the monopolist’s marginal cost. If price equals marginal cost, customers will 
buy the quantity of the monopolist’s output that maximizes total surplus and the 
allocation of resources will be efficient.
There are, however, two practical problems with marginal-cost pricing as a reg-
ulatory system. The first arises from the logic of cost curves. By definition, natural 
monopolies have declining average total cost. As we first discussed in Chapter 13, 
when average total cost is declining, marginal cost is less than average total cost. 
This situation is illustrated in Figure 10, which shows a firm with a large fixed cost 
and then constant marginal cost thereafter. If regulators were to set price equal to 
marginal cost, that price would be less than the firm’s average total cost and the 
firm would lose money. Instead of charging such a low price, the monopoly firm 
would just exit the industry.
Regulators can respond to this problem in various ways, none of which is 
­perfect. One way is to subsidize the monopolist. In essence, the government picks 
up the losses inherent in marginal-cost pricing. Yet to pay for the subsidy, the gov-
ernment needs to raise money through taxation, which involves its own dead-
weight losses. Alternatively, the regulators can allow the monopolist to charge a 
price higher than marginal cost. If the regulated price equals average total cost, 
the monopolist earns exactly zero economic profit. Yet average-cost pricing 
leads to deadweight losses because the monopolist’s price no longer reflects the 
­marginal cost of producing the good. In essence, average-cost pricing is like a tax 
on the good the monopolist is selling.
FIGURE 10
Marginal-Cost Pricing for a 
Natural Monopoly
Because a natural monopoly 
has declining average total 
cost, marginal cost is less than 
average total cost. Therefore, 
if regulators require a natural 
­monopoly to charge a price 
equal to marginal cost, price 
will be below average total cost, 
and the monopoly will lose 
money.

CHAPTER 15  MONOPOLY
321
The second problem with marginal-cost pricing as a regulatory system (and 
with average-cost pricing as well) is that it gives the monopolist no ­incentive 
to reduce costs. Each firm in a competitive market tries to reduce its costs 
­because lower costs mean higher profits. But if a regulated monopolist knows 
that regulators will reduce prices whenever costs fall, the monopolist will 
not benefit from lower costs. In practice, regulators deal with this problem 
by ­allowing monopolists to keep some of the benefits from lower costs in the 
form of higher profit, a practice that requires some departure from marginal-
cost pricing.
15-5c Public Ownership
The third policy used by the government to deal with monopoly is public own-
ership. That is, rather than regulating a natural monopoly that is run by a pri-
vate firm, the government can run the monopoly itself. This solution is common 
in many European countries, where the government owns and operates utilities 
such as telephone, water, and electric companies. In the United States, the gov-
ernment runs the Postal Service. The delivery of ordinary first-class mail is often 
thought to be a natural monopoly.
Economists usually prefer private to public ownership of natural monopolies. 
The key issue is how the ownership of the firm affects the costs of production. 
Private owners have an incentive to minimize costs as long as they reap part of 
the benefit in the form of higher profit. If the firm’s managers are doing a bad job 
of keeping costs down, the firm’s owners will fire them. By contrast, if the govern-
ment bureaucrats who run a monopoly do a bad job, the losers are the customers 
and taxpayers, whose only recourse is the political system. The bureaucrats may 
become a special-interest group and attempt to block cost-reducing reforms. Put 
simply, as a way of ensuring that firms are well run, the voting booth is less reli-
able than the profit motive.
15-5d Doing Nothing
Each of the foregoing policies aimed at reducing the problem of monopoly has 
drawbacks. As a result, some economists argue that it is often best for the gov-
ernment not to try to remedy the inefficiencies of monopoly pricing. Here is the 
assessment of economist George Stigler, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in 
industrial organization:
A famous theorem in economics states that a competitive enterprise economy 
will produce the largest possible income from a given stock of resources. No 
real economy meets the exact conditions of the theorem, and all real economies 
will fall short of the ideal economy—a difference called “market failure.” In 
my view, however, the degree of “market failure” for the American economy 
is much smaller than the “political failure” arising from the imperfections of 
economic policies found in real political systems.
As this quotation makes clear, determining the proper role of the government in 
the economy requires judgments about politics as well as economics.

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
15-6 Conclusion: The Prevalence 
of Monopolies
This chapter has discussed the behavior of firms that have control over the prices 
they charge. We have seen that these firms behave very differently from the com-
petitive firms studied in the previous chapter. Table 2 summarizes some of the 
key similarities and differences between competitive and monopoly markets.
From the standpoint of public policy, a crucial result is that a monopolist pro-
duces less than the socially efficient quantity and charges a price above marginal 
cost. As a result, a monopoly causes deadweight losses. In some cases, these inef-
ficiencies can be mitigated through price discrimination by the monopolist, but 
other times, they call for policymakers to take an active role.
How prevalent are the problems of monopoly? There are two answers to this 
question.
In one sense, monopolies are common. Most firms have some control over the 
prices they charge. They are not forced to charge the market price for their goods 
because their goods are not exactly the same as those offered by other firms. 
A Ford Taurus is not the same as a Toyota Camry. Ben and Jerry’s ice cream is 
not the same as Breyer’s. Each of these goods has a downward-sloping demand 
curve, which gives each producer some degree of monopoly power.
Yet firms with substantial monopoly power are rare. Few goods are truly unique. 
Most have substitutes that, even if not exactly the same, are similar. Ben and Jerry 
can raise the price of their ice cream a little without losing all their sales, but if they 
raise it a lot, sales will fall substantially as their customers switch to other brands.
In the end, monopoly power is a matter of degree. It is true that many firms 
have some monopoly power. It is also true that their monopoly power is usually 
limited. In such a situation, we will not go far wrong assuming that firms operate 
in competitive markets, even if that is not precisely the case.

CHAPTER 15  MONOPOLY
323
•	
A monopoly is a firm that is the sole seller in its mar-
ket. A monopoly arises when a single firm owns a 
key resource, when the government gives a firm the 
­exclusive right to produce a good, or when a single 
firm can supply the entire market at a lower cost than 
many firms could.
•	
Because a monopoly is the sole producer in its mar-
ket, it faces a downward-sloping demand curve for 
its product. When a monopoly increases production 
by 1 unit, it causes the price of its good to fall, which 
reduces the amount of revenue earned on all units pro-
duced. As a result, a monopoly’s marginal revenue is 
always below the price of its good.
•	
Like a competitive firm, a monopoly firm maximizes 
profit by producing the quantity at which marginal 
revenue equals marginal cost. The monopoly then sets 
the price at which that quantity is demanded. Unlike a 
competitive firm, a monopoly firm’s price exceeds its 
marginal revenue, so its price exceeds marginal cost.
•	
A monopolist’s profit-maximizing level of output is 
­below the level that maximizes the sum of consumer 
and producer surplus. That is, when the monopoly 
charges a price above marginal cost, some consumers 
who value the good more than its cost of production 
do not buy it. As a result, monopoly causes dead-
weight losses similar to those caused by taxes.
•	
A monopolist can often increase profits by charging 
different prices for the same good based on a buyer’s 
willingness to pay. This practice of price discrimina-
tion can raise economic welfare by getting the good 
to some consumers who otherwise would not buy 
it. In the extreme case of perfect price discrimina-
tion, the deadweight loss of monopoly is completely 
eliminated and the entire surplus in the market goes 
to the monopoly producer. More generally, when 
price discrimination is imperfect, it can either raise or 
lower welfare compared to the outcome with a single 
­monopoly price.
•	
Policymakers can respond to the inefficiency of 
­monopoly behavior in four ways. They can use the 
­antitrust laws to try to make the industry more compet-
itive. They can regulate the prices that the ­monopoly 
charges. They can turn the monopolist into a govern-
ment-run enterprise. Or, if the market failure is deemed 
small compared to the inevitable ­imperfections of poli-
cies, they can do nothing at all.

the country of Wiknam, and as the story begins, 
­international trade in soccer balls is prohibited. 
The ­following equations describe the monopolist’s 
­demand, marginal revenue, total cost, and marginal 
cost:
Demand: P = 10 − Q
Marginal Revenue: MR = 10 − 2Q
Total Cost: TC = 3 + Q + 0.5Q2
Marginal Cost: MC = 1 + Q
where Q is quantity and P is the price measured in 
Wiknamian dollars.
a.	 How many soccer balls does the monopolist 
­produce? At what price are they sold? What is the 
monopolist’s profit?
b.	 One day, the King of Wiknam decrees that hence-
forth there will be free trade—either imports or 
­exports— of soccer balls at the world price of $6. 
The firm is now a price taker in a competitive 
­market. What happens to domestic production 
of soccer balls? To domestic consumption? Does 
­Wiknam export or import soccer balls?
c.	 In our analysis of international trade in Chapter 9, a 
country becomes an exporter when the price with-
out trade is below the world price and an importer 
when the price without trade is above the world 
price. Does that conclusion hold in your answers to 
parts (a) and (b)? Explain.
d.	 Suppose that the world price was not $6 but, 
instead, happened to be exactly the same as the 
­domestic price without trade as determined in part (a). 
Would allowing trade have changed ­anything in

Demand: P = 1,000 − 10Q
Total Revenue: TR = 1,000Q − 10Q2
Marginal Revenue: MR = 1,000 − 20Q
Marginal Cost: MC = 100 + 10Q
where Q indicates the number of copies sold and P is 
the price in Ectenian dollars.
a.	 Find the price and quantity that maximize the 
­company’s profit.
b.	 Find the price and quantity that would maximize 
social welfare.
c.	 Calculate the deadweight loss from monopoly.
d.	 Suppose, in addition to the costs above, the director 
of the film has to be paid. The company is consider-
ing four options:
	
i.	
a flat fee of 2,000 Ectenian dollars.
	
ii.	 50 percent of the profits.
	
iii.	 150 Ectenian dollars per unit sold.
	
iv.	 50 percent of the revenue.
For each option, calculate the profit-maximizing price 
and quantity. Which, if any, of these ­compensation 
schemes would alter the deadweight loss from 
­monopoly? Explain.
11.	 Many schemes for price discriminating involve some 
cost. For example, discount coupons take up the time 
and resources of both the buyer and the seller. This 
question considers the implications of costly price

ou walk into a bookstore to buy a book to read during your next vacation. On 
the store’s shelves you find a Sue Grafton mystery, a Stephen King thriller, a 
David McCullough history, a Stephenie Meyer vampire romance, and many 
other choices. When you pick out a book and buy it, what kind of market are you 
participating in?
On the one hand, the market for books seems competitive. As you look over the 
shelves at your bookstore, you find many authors and many publishers vying for 
your attention. A buyer in this market has thousands of competing products from 
which to choose. And because anyone can enter the industry by writing and 
publishing a book, the book business is not very profitable. For every highly 
paid novelist, there are hundreds of struggling ones.
On the other hand, the market for books seems monopolistic. Because 
each book is unique, publishers have some latitude in choosing what price to 
charge. The sellers in this market are price makers rather than price takers.

And indeed, the price of books greatly exceeds marginal cost. The price of a typi-
cal hardcover novel, for instance, is about $25, whereas the cost of printing one 
additional copy of the novel is less than $5.
The market for novels fits neither the competitive nor the monopoly model. 
Instead, it is best described by the model of monopolistic competition, the subject 
of this chapter. The term “monopolistic competition” might at first seem to be an 
oxymoron, like “jumbo shrimp.” But as we will see, monopolistically competitive 
industries are monopolistic in some ways and competitive in others. The model 
describes not only the publishing industry but also the market for many other 
goods and services.
16-1 Between Monopoly and Perfect Competition
The previous two chapters analyzed markets with many competitive firms and 
markets with a single monopoly firm. In Chapter 14, we saw that the price in a 
perfectly competitive market always equals the marginal cost of production. We 
also saw that, in the long run, entry and exit drive economic profit to zero, so the 
price also equals average total cost. In Chapter 15, we saw how monopoly firms 
can use their market power to keep prices above marginal cost, leading to a posi-
tive economic profit for the firm and a deadweight loss for society. Competition 
and monopoly are extreme forms of market structure. Competition occurs when 
there are many firms in a market offering essentially identical products; monop-
oly occurs when there is only one firm in a market.
Although the cases of perfect competition and monopoly illustrate some 
­important ideas about how markets work, most markets in the economy include 
elements of both these cases and, therefore, are not completely described by either 
of them. The typical firm in the economy faces competition, but the competition 
is not so rigorous that it makes the firm a price taker like the firms analyzed in 
Chapter 14. The typical firm also has some degree of market power, but its mar-
ket power is not so great that the firm can be described exactly by the monopoly 
model presented in Chapter 15. In other words, many industries fall somewhere 
between the polar cases of perfect competition and monopoly. Economists call 
this situation imperfect competition.
One type of imperfectly competitive market is an oligopoly, a market with only a 
few sellers, each offering a product that is similar or identical to the products offered 
by other sellers in the market. Economists measure a market’s domination by a small 
number of firms with a statistic called the concentration ratio, which is the percentage 
of total output in the market supplied by the four largest firms. In the U.S. economy, 
most industries have a four-firm concentration ratio under 50 percent, but in some 
industries, the biggest firms play a more dominant role. Highly concentrated indus-
tries include the market for electric lamp bulbs (which has a concentration ratio of 
75 percent), breakfast cereal (80 percent), aircraft manufacturing (81 percent), house-
hold laundry equipment (98 percent), and cigarettes (98 percent). These industries 
are best described as oligopolies. In the next chapter we see that the small number of 
firms in oligopolies makes strategic interactions among them a key part of the analy-
sis. That is, in choosing how much to produce and what price to charge, each firm in 
an oligopoly is concerned not only with what its competitors are doing but also with 
how its competitors would react to what it might do.
A second type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic 
competition. This describes a market structure in which there are many firms selling 
oligopoly
a market structure in which 
only a few sellers offer similar 
or identical products

a market structure in which 
many firms sell products that 
are similar but not identical

CHAPTER 16  MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION

products that are similar but not identical. In a monopolistically competitive market, 
each firm has a monopoly over the product it makes, but many other firms make 
similar products that compete for the same customers.
To be more precise, monopolistic competition describes a market with the 
following attributes:
•	 Many sellers: There are many firms competing for the same group of customers.
•	 Product differentiation: Each firm produces a product that is at least slightly 
different from those of other firms. Thus, rather than being a price taker, each 
firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve.
•	 Free entry and exit: Firms can enter or exit the market without restriction. Thus, the 
number of firms in the market adjusts until economic profits are driven to zero.
A moment’s thought reveals a long list of markets with these attributes: books, 
DVDs, computer games, restaurants, piano lessons, cookies, clothing, and so on.
Monopolistic competition, like oligopoly, is a market structure that lies between the 
extreme cases of perfect competition and monopoly. But oligopoly and monopolis-
tic competition are quite different. Oligopoly departs from the perfectly competitive 
ideal of Chapter 14 because there are only a few sellers in the market. The small num-
ber of sellers makes rigorous competition less likely and strategic interactions among 
them vitally important. By contrast, a monopolistically competitive market has many 
sellers, each of which is small compared to the market. It departs from the perfectly 
competitive ideal because each of the sellers offers a somewhat different product.
Figure 1 summarizes the four types of market structure. The first question to ask 
about any market is how many firms there are. If there is only one firm, the mar-
ket is a monopoly. If there are only a few firms, the market is an oligopoly. If there 
are many firms, we need to ask another question: Do the firms sell identical or dif-
ferentiated products? If the many firms sell differentiated products, the market is 
monopolistically competitive. If the many firms sell identical products, the market 
is perfectly competitive.

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
Because reality is never as clear-cut as theory, at times you may find it hard 
to decide what structure best describes a market. There is, for instance, no 
magic number that separates “few” from “many” when counting the num-
ber of firms. (Do the approximately dozen companies that now sell cars in the 
United States make this market an oligopoly, or is the market more compet-
itive? The answer is open to debate.) Similarly, there is no sure way to de-
termine when products are differentiated and when they are identical. (Are 
different brands of milk really the same? Again, the answer is debatable.) 
When analyzing actual markets, economists have to keep in mind the lessons 
learned from studying all types of market structure and then apply each lesson 
as it seems appropriate.
Now that we understand how economists define the various types of market 
structure, we can continue our analysis of each of them. In this chapter we exam-
ine monopolistic competition. In the next chapter we analyze oligopoly.
Quick Quiz  Define oligopoly and monopolistic competition and give an example 
of each.
16-2 Competition with Differentiated Products
To understand monopolistically competitive markets, we first consider the deci-
sions facing an individual firm. We then examine what happens in the long run 
as firms enter and exit the industry. Next, we compare the equilibrium under 
monopolistic competition to the equilibrium under perfect competition that we 
examined in Chapter 14. Finally, we consider whether the outcome in a monopo-
listically competitive market is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole.
16-2a The Monopolistically Competitive Firm 
in the Short Run
Each firm in a monopolistically competitive market is, in many ways, like a mo-
nopoly. Because its product is different from those offered by other firms, it faces 
a downward-sloping demand curve. (By contrast, a perfectly competitive firm 
faces a horizontal demand curve at the market price.) Thus, the monopolistically 
competitive firm follows a monopolist’s rule for profit maximization: It chooses 
to produce the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost and 
then uses its demand curve to find the price at which it can sell that quantity.
Figure 2 shows the cost, demand, and marginal-revenue curves for two typical 
firms, each in a different monopolistically competitive industry. In both panels 
of this figure, the profit-maximizing quantity is found at the intersection of the 
marginal-revenue and marginal-cost curves. The two panels in this figure show 
different outcomes for the firm’s profit. In panel (a), price exceeds average total 
cost, so the firm makes a profit. In panel (b), price is below average total cost. In 
this case, the firm is unable to make a positive profit, so the best the firm can do is 
to minimize its losses.
All this should seem familiar. A monopolistically competitive firm chooses its 
quantity and price just as a monopoly does. In the short run, these two types of 
market structure are similar.
16-2b The Long-Run Equilibrium
The situations depicted in Figure 2 do not last long. When firms are making prof-
its, as in panel (a), new firms have an incentive to enter the market. This entry

Monopolistic competitors, like monopolists, maximize profit by producing the quantity at 
which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm in panel (a) makes a profit because, 
at this quantity, price is above average total cost. The firm in panel (b) makes losses  
because, at this quantity, price is less than average total cost.

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
increases the number of products from which customers can choose and, therefore, 
reduces the demand faced by each firm already in the market. In other words, profit 
­encourages entry, and entry shifts the demand curves faced by the incumbent firms 
to the left. As the demand for incumbent firms’ products falls, these firms experi-
ence declining profit.
Conversely, when firms are making losses, as in panel (b), firms in the mar-
ket have an incentive to exit. As firms exit, customers have fewer products from 
which to choose. This decrease in the number of firms expands the demand faced 
by those firms that stay in the market. In other words, losses encourage exit, and 
exit shifts the demand curves of the remaining firms to the right. As the demand 
for the remaining firms’ products rises, these firms experience rising profits (that 
is, declining losses).
This process of entry and exit continues until the firms in the market are mak-
ing exactly zero economic profit. Figure 3 depicts the long-run equilibrium. Once 
the market reaches this equilibrium, new firms have no incentive to enter, and 
existing firms have no incentive to exit.
Notice that the demand curve in Figure 3 just barely touches the average- 
total-cost curve. Mathematically, we say the two curves are tangent to each other. 
These two curves must be tangent once entry and exit have driven profit to zero. 
Because profit per unit sold is the difference between price (found on the demand 
curve) and average total cost, the maximum profit is zero only if these two curves 
touch each other without crossing. Also note that this point of tangency occurs at 
the same quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. That these two 
points line up is not a coincidence: It is required because this particular quantity 
maximizes profit and the maximum profit is exactly zero in the long run.
To sum up, two characteristics describe the long-run equilibrium in a monopo-
listically competitive market:
•	 As in a monopoly market, price exceeds marginal cost. This conclusion arises 
because profit maximization requires marginal revenue to equal marginal cost 
A Monopolistic Competitor in  
the Long Run
In a monopolistically competitive  
market, if firms are making profits, new 
firms enter, and the demand curves for 
the incumbent firms shift to the left. 
Similarly, if firms are making losses, 
some of the firms in the market exit 
and the demand curves of the remain-
ing firms shift to the right. Because of 
these shifts in demand, monopolistically 
competitive firms eventually find them-
selves in the long-run equilibrium shown 
here. In this long-run equilibrium, price 
equals average total cost and each firm 
earns zero profit.

and because the downward-sloping demand curve makes marginal revenue 
less than the price.
•	 As in a competitive market, price equals average total cost. This conclusion 
arises because free entry and exit drive economic profit to zero.
The second characteristic shows how monopolistic competition differs from 
monopoly. Because a monopoly is the sole seller of a product without close 
substitutes, it can earn positive economic profit, even in the long run. By con-
trast, ­because there is free entry into a monopolistically competitive market, the 
­economic profit of a firm in this type of market is driven to zero.
16-2c Monopolistic versus Perfect Competition
Figure 4 compares the long-run equilibrium under monopolistic competition 
to the long-run equilibrium under perfect competition. (Chapter 14 discussed 
the equilibrium with perfect competition.) There are two noteworthy differ-
ences between monopolistic and perfect competition: excess capacity and the 
markup.
Excess Capacity  As we have just seen, the process of entry and exit drives each 
firm in a monopolistically competitive market to a point of tangency between its 
demand and average-total-cost curves. Panel (a) of Figure 4 shows that the quantity 
of output at this point is smaller than the quantity that minimizes average total cost. 
Thus, under monopolistic competition, firms produce on the downward-sloping 
Panel (a) shows the long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive market, and 
panel (b) shows the long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market. Two differences 
are notable. (1) The perfectly competitive firm produces at the efficient scale, where aver-
age total cost is minimized. By contrast, the monopolistically competitive firm produces at 
less than the efficient scale. (2) Price equals marginal cost under perfect competition, but 
price is above marginal cost under monopolistic competition.

portion of their average-total-cost curves. In this way, monopolistic competition 
contrasts starkly with perfect competition. As panel (b) of Figure 4 shows, free 
entry in competitive markets drives firms to produce at the minimum of average 
total cost.
The quantity that minimizes average total cost is called the efficient scale of the 
firm. In the long run, perfectly competitive firms produce at the efficient scale, 
whereas monopolistically competitive firms produce below this level. Firms are 
said to have excess capacity under monopolistic competition. In other words, a 
monopolistically competitive firm, unlike a perfectly competitive firm, could 
­increase the quantity it produces and lower the average total cost of production. 
The firm forgoes this opportunity because it would need to cut its price to sell the 
additional output. It is more profitable for a monopolistic competitor to continue 
operating with excess capacity.
Markup over Marginal Cost  A second difference between perfect competition 
and monopolistic competition is the relationship between price and marginal cost. 
For a perfectly competitive firm, such as the one shown in panel (b) of Figure 4, 
price equals marginal cost. For a monopolistically competitive firm, such as the 
one shown in panel (a), price exceeds marginal cost because the firm always has 
some market power.
How is this markup over marginal cost consistent with free entry and zero 
profit? The zero-profit condition ensures only that price equals average total cost. 
It does not ensure that price equals marginal cost. Indeed, in the long-run equilib-
rium, monopolistically competitive firms operate on the declining portion of their 
average-total-cost curves, so marginal cost is below average total cost. Thus, for 
price to equal average total cost, price must be above marginal cost.
In this relationship between price and marginal cost, we see a key behavioral 
difference between perfect competitors and monopolistic competitors. ­Imagine 
that you were to ask a firm the following question: “Would you like to see 
­another customer come through your door ready to buy from you at your current 
price?” A perfectly competitive firm would answer that it didn’t care. Because 
price ­exactly equals marginal cost, the profit from an extra unit sold is zero. By 
contrast, a monopolistically competitive firm is always eager to get another cus-
tomer. Because its price exceeds marginal cost, an extra unit sold at the posted 
price means more profit.
According to an old quip, monopolistically competitive markets are those in 
which sellers send Christmas cards to the buyers. Trying to attract more custom-
ers makes sense only if price exceeds marginal cost.
16-2d Monopolistic Competition and 
the Welfare of Society
Is the outcome in a monopolistically competitive market desirable from the stand-
point of society as a whole? Can policymakers improve on the market outcome? 
In previous chapters we evaluated markets from the standpoint of efficiency—
that is, whether society is getting the most it can out of its scarce resources. We 
learned that competitive markets lead to efficient outcomes, unless there are ex-
ternalities, whereas monopoly markets lead to deadweight losses. Monopolisti-
cally competitive markets are more complex than either of these polar cases, so 
evaluating welfare in these markets is a more subtle exercise.
One source of inefficiency is the markup of price over marginal cost. Because 
of the markup, some consumers who value the good at more than the marginal

CHAPTER 16  MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
337
cost of production (but less than the price) will be deterred from buying it. 
Thus, a monopolistically competitive market has the normal deadweight loss of 
­monopoly pricing.
This outcome is undesirable compared with the efficient quantity that arises 
when price equals marginal cost, but policymakers don’t have an easy way to 
fix the problem. To enforce marginal-cost pricing, they would need to regulate 
all firms that produce differentiated products. Because such products are so com-
mon in the economy, the administrative burden of such regulation would be 
overwhelming.
Moreover, regulating monopolistic competitors entails all the problems of 
regulating natural monopolies. In particular, because monopolistic competitors 
are making zero profits already, requiring them to lower their prices to equal 
­marginal cost would cause them to make losses. To keep these firms in business, 
the government would need to help them cover these losses. Rather than raise 
taxes to pay for these subsidies, policymakers often decide it is better to live with 
the inefficiency of monopolistic pricing.
Another way in which monopolistic competition may be socially inefficient is 
that the number of firms in the market may not be “ideal.” That is, there may 
be too much or too little entry. One way to think about this problem is in terms of 
the externalities associated with entry. Whenever a new firm considers entering 
the market with a new product, it takes into account only the profit it would make. 
Yet its entry would also have the following two effects that are external to the firm:
•	 The product-variety externality: Because consumers get some consumer surplus 
from the introduction of a new product, entry of a new firm conveys a positive 
externality on consumers.
•	 The business-stealing externality: Because other firms lose customers and profits 
from the entry of a new competitor, entry of a new firm imposes a negative 
externality on existing firms.
Thus, in a monopolistically competitive market, there are positive and negative 
externalities associated with the entry of new firms. Depending on which exter-
nality is larger, a monopolistically competitive market could have either too few 
or too many products.
Both of these externalities are closely related to the conditions for monopolis-
tic competition. The product-variety externality arises because new firms offer 
products that differ from those of the existing firms. The business-stealing exter-
nality arises because firms post a price above marginal cost and, therefore, are 
always eager to sell additional units. Conversely, because perfectly competitive 
firms produce identical goods and charge a price equal to marginal cost, neither 
of these externalities exists under perfect competition.
In the end, we can conclude only that monopolistically competitive markets 
do not have all the desirable welfare properties of perfectly competitive markets. 
That is, the invisible hand does not ensure that total surplus is maximized under 
monopolistic competition. Yet because the inefficiencies are subtle, hard to mea-
sure, and hard to fix, there is no easy way for public policy to improve the market 
outcome.

In the News
If the Shoe Doesn’t Fit
By Joel Waldfogel
L
ast week, Nike unveiled a shoe designed spe-
cifically for American Indians. The sneaker 
has both a native-theme design and—more 
importantly—a wider shape to accommodate 
the distinctly shaped feet of American Indians. 
With diabetes and related conditions near epi-
demic levels in some tribes, American Indian 
leaders were happy to welcome this comfort-
able product. If anything, what seems odd is 
that it took so long. After all, free-market econ-
omists have told us for decades that we should 
rely on market decisions, not the government, 
to meet our needs, because it’s the market that 
satisfies everyone’s every desire.
And yet it turns out that it’s the Indians’ long 
wait for a good sneaker that’s typical. For small 
groups with preferences outside the norm, the 
market often fails to deliver, as I ­argue in my 
new book, The Tyranny of the ­Market: Why You 
Can’t Always Get What You Want.
John Stuart Mill pointed out that voting 
gives rise to a tyranny of the majority. If we 
vote on what color shirts to make—or whether 
to make wide or narrow shoes—then the 
majority gets what it prefers, and the minor-
ity does not. The market, on the other hand, 
is supposed to work differently. As Milton 
­Friedman eloquently put it in 1962, “the char-
acteristic feature of action through political 
channels is that it tends to require or enforce 
substantial conformity. The great advantage 
of the market is that it permits wide diversity. 
Each man can vote, as it were, for the color of 
tie he wants and get it; he does not have to 
see what color the majority wants and then, if 
he is in the minority, submit.” This is a won-
derful argument. Except that for many prod-
ucts and for many people, it’s wrong.
Two simple conditions that prevail in 
many markets mean that individual taste 
alone doesn’t determine individual satis-
faction. These conditions are (1) big setup 
costs and (2) preferences that differ across 
groups; when they’re present, an individual’s 
satisfaction is a function of how many peo-
ple share his or her tastes. In other words, 
in these cases, markets share some of the 
­objectionable features of government. They 
give bigger groups more and better options.
In my research, I’ve discovered that this 
phenomenon is widespread. Ten years ago, I 
started studying radio-station listening pat-
terns. I noticed that people listened to the 
radio more in metro areas of the United States 
with relatively large populations. This is not 
terribly surprising. In larger cities, more sta-
tions can attract enough listeners and adver-
tising revenue to cover their costs and stay on 
the air. With more to choose from on the dial, 
residents tune in more. So, in this situation 
of high fixed costs (each station needs a fol-
lowing to keep broadcasting), people help one 
another by making more options viable.
But who benefits whom? When I looked at 
black and white listeners separately, I noticed 
something surprising. Blacks listen more in cities

16-3 Advertising
It is nearly impossible to go through a typical day in a modern economy without 
being bombarded with advertising. Whether you are surfing the Internet, post-
ing on Facebook, reading a newspaper, watching television, or driving down the 
highway, some firm will try to convince you to buy its product. Such behavior is a 
natural feature of monopolistic competition (as well as some oligopolistic indus-
tries). When firms sell differentiated products and charge prices above marginal 
cost, each firm has an incentive to advertise to attract more buyers to its particular 
product.
The amount of advertising varies substantially across products. Firms that sell 
highly differentiated consumer goods, such as over-the-counter drugs, perfumes, 
soft drinks, razor blades, breakfast cereals, and dog food, typically spend between 
10 and 20 percent of revenue on advertising. Firms that sell industrial products, 
such as drill presses and communications satellites, typically spend very little on 
advertising. And firms that sell homogeneous products, such as wheat, peanuts, 
and crude oil, spend nothing at all.

CHAPTER 16  MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
339
For the economy as a whole, about 2 percent of total firm revenue is spent on 
advertising. This spending takes many forms, including ads on websites, televi-
sion, radio, and billboards, and in newspapers, magazines, the yellow pages, and 
direct mail.
16-3a The Debate over Advertising
Is society wasting the resources it devotes to advertising? Or does advertising 
serve a valuable purpose? Assessing the social value of advertising is difficult and 
often generates heated argument among economists. Let’s consider both sides of 
the debate.
The Critique of Advertising  Critics of advertising argue that firms advertise 
to manipulate people’s tastes. Much advertising is psychological rather than infor-
mational. Consider, for example, the typical television commercial for some brand 
of soft drink. The commercial most likely does not tell the viewer about the prod-
uct’s price or quality. Instead, it might show a group of happy people at a party on 
a beach on a beautiful sunny day. In their hands are cans of the soft drink. The goal 
of the commercial is to convey a subconscious (if not subtle) message: “You too can

with larger black populations, and whites listen 
more in cities with larger white populations. 
Black listening does not increase where there’s 
a higher white population, and white listening 
does not increase with a higher black population. 
Which means that while overall people help each 
other by increasing the number of stations on the 
dial, blacks do not help whites, and whites do not 
help blacks. Similar patterns arise for Hispanics 
and non-Hispanics.
A closer look at the data—­necessary only 
because I’m a middle-aged white ­economist—
showed why this was happening. Blacks and 
whites don’t listen to the same radio stations. 
The black-targeted formats account for about 
two-thirds of black listening and only 3 ­percent 
of white listening. Similarly, the formats 
that ­attract the largest white audiences, like 
­country, attract almost no blacks. This means 
that if you dropped Larry the Cable Guy and a 
few thousand of his friends from a helicopter 
(with parachutes) into a metro area, you’d 
create more demand for country and perhaps 
album-rock stations, which would be nice for 
white listeners. But the influx wouldn’t help 
black listeners at all.
In this example, different population 
groups don’t help each other, but they don’t 
hurt each other, either. Sometimes, though, 
the effect that groups have on each other 
through the market is actually negative. 
­Industries like daily newspapers offer essen-
tially one product per market. Because the 
­paper can be pitched to appeal to one group 
or another, the larger one group is, the less 
the product is tailored to anyone else. This is 
the tyranny of the majority translated almost 
literally from politics into markets.
This brings us back to Nike’s new shoe. 
Foot Locker is full of options that fit me 
and most other Americans. But American 
­Indians make up just 1.5 percent of the U.S. 
population, and with feet on average three 
sizes wider, they need different-sized shoes. 
If we had all voted in a national election on 
whether the Ministry of Shoes should make 
wide or typical-width shoes, we surely would 
have chosen the latter. That’s why Friedman 
condemned government allocation. And yet 
the market made the same choice. If Nike’s 
announcement looks like a solution to this 
problem of ignored minority preference, it re-
ally isn’t. The company took too many years 
to bring the shoe on line, and according to 
the Associated Press, the new sneaker “rep-
resents less of a financial opportunity than a 
goodwill and branding effort.”
The tyranny of the market arises else-
where. With drug development costs near  
$1 billion, if you are going to be sick, hope 
that your disease is common enough to attract 
the interest of drug makers. If you want to fly 
from your town to Chicago, hope that your city 
is big enough to fill a plane every day.
When you’re not so lucky, you benefit when 
the government steps in on your behalf, with 
subsidies for research on drugs for rare dis-
eases or for air service to small locales. For 
a generation, influential economists have 
argued for letting the market decide a wide 
array of questions, to protect your freedom to 
choose whatever you want. This is true—if 
everyone agrees with you.

have many friends and be happy, if you drink our product.” Critics of advertising 
argue that such a commercial creates a desire that otherwise might not exist.
Critics also argue that advertising impedes competition. Advertising often tries 
to convince consumers that products are more different than they truly are. By 
increasing the perception of product differentiation and fostering brand loyalty, 
advertising makes buyers less concerned with price differences among similar 
goods, thereby making the demand for a particular brand less elastic. When a 
firm faces a less elastic demand curve, it can increase its profits by charging a 
larger markup over marginal cost.
The Defense of Advertising  Defenders of advertising argue that firms use ad-
vertising to provide information to customers. Advertising conveys the prices of 
the goods offered for sale, the existence of new products, and the locations of retail 
outlets. This information allows customers to make better choices about what to 
buy and, thus, enhances the ability of markets to allocate resources efficiently.
Defenders also argue that advertising fosters competition. Because advertising 
allows customers to be more fully informed about all the firms in the market, cus-
tomers can more easily take advantage of price differences. Thus, each firm has 
less market power. In addition, advertising allows new firms to enter more easily 
because it gives entrants a means to attract customers from existing firms.
Over time, policymakers have come to accept the view that advertising can 
make markets more competitive. One important example is the regulation of ad-
vertising for certain professions, such as lawyers, doctors, and pharmacists. In the 
past, these groups succeeded in getting state governments to prohibit advertis-
ing in their fields on the grounds that advertising was “unprofessional.” In recent 
years, however, the courts have concluded that the primary effect of these restric-
tions on advertising was to curtail competition. They have, therefore, overturned 
many of the laws that prohibit advertising by members of these professions.
Advertising and the Price of Eyeglasses
What effect does advertising have on the price of a good? On the one 
hand, advertising might make consumers view products as being more 
different than they otherwise would. If so, it would make markets less com-
petitive and firms’ demand curves less elastic, and this would lead firms to 
charge higher prices. On the other hand, advertising might make it easier for con-
sumers to find the firms offering the best prices. In this case, it would make mar-
kets more competitive and firms’ demand curves more elastic, which would lead 
to lower prices.
In an article published in the Journal of Law and Economics in 1972, economist 
Lee Benham tested these two views of advertising. In the United States during the 
1960s, the various state governments had vastly different rules about advertising 
by optometrists. Some states allowed advertising for eyeglasses and eye examina-
tions. Many states, however, prohibited it. For example, the Florida law read as 
follows:
It is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to … advertise either directly 
or indirectly by any means whatsoever any definite or indefinite price or credit 
terms on prescriptive or corrective lens, frames, complete prescriptive or cor-
rective glasses, or any optometric service…. This section is passed in the inter-
est of public health, safety, and welfare, and its provisions shall be liberally 
construed to carry out its objects and purposes.

Professional optometrists enthusiastically endorsed these restrictions on 
advertising.
Benham used the differences in state law as a natural experiment to test the 
two views of advertising. The results were striking. In those states that prohib-
ited advertising, the average price paid for a pair of eyeglasses was $33, or $248 
in 2012 dollars. In states that did not restrict advertising, the average price was 
$26, or $196 in 2012 dollars. Thus, advertising reduced average prices by more 
than 20 percent. In the market for eyeglasses, and probably in many other mar-
kets as well, advertising fosters competition and leads to lower prices for con-
sumers. 
16-3b Advertising as a Signal of Quality
Many types of advertising contain little apparent information about the product 
being advertised. Consider a firm introducing a new breakfast cereal. The firm 
might saturate the airwaves with advertisements showing some actor eating the 
cereal and exclaiming how wonderful it tastes. How much information does the 
advertisement really provide?
The answer is more than you might think. Defenders of advertising argue that 
even advertising that appears to contain little hard information may in fact tell 
consumers something about product quality. The willingness of the firm to spend 
a large amount of money on advertising can itself be a signal to consumers about 
the quality of the product being offered.
Consider the problem facing two firms—Post and Kellogg. Each company 
has just come up with a recipe for a new cereal, which it would sell for $3 a box. 
To keep things simple, let’s assume that the marginal cost of making cereal is 
zero, so the $3 is all profit. Each company knows that if it spends $10 million 
on advertising, it will get 1 million consumers to try its new cereal. And each 
company knows that if consumers like the cereal, they will buy it not once but 
many times.
First consider Post’s decision. Based on market research, Post knows that its 
cereal tastes like shredded newspaper with sugar on top. Advertising would 
sell one box to each of 1 million consumers, but consumers would quickly learn 
that the cereal is not very good and stop buying it. Post decides it is not worth 
spending $10 million on advertising to get only $3 million in sales. So it does not 
bother to advertise. It sends its cooks back to the test kitchen to develop another 
recipe.
Kellogg, on the other hand, knows that its cereal is great. Each person who tries 
it will buy a box a month for the next year. Thus, the $10 million in advertising 
will bring in $36 million in sales. Advertising is profitable here because Kellogg 
has a good product that consumers will buy repeatedly. Thus, Kellogg chooses to 
advertise.
Now that we have considered the behavior of the two firms, let’s consider the 
behavior of consumers. We began by asserting that consumers are inclined to try 
a new cereal that they see advertised. But is this behavior rational? Should a con-
sumer try a new cereal just because the seller has chosen to advertise it?
In fact, it may be completely rational for consumers to try new products that 
they see advertised. In our story, consumers decide to try Kellogg’s new cereal 
because Kellogg advertises. Kellogg chooses to advertise because it knows that 
its cereal is quite good, while Post chooses not to advertise because it knows that 
its cereal is not good at all. By its willingness to spend money on advertising, 
Kellogg signals to consumers the quality of its cereal. Each consumer thinks,

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
quite ­sensibly, “Boy, if the Kellogg Company is willing to spend so much money 
advertising this new cereal, it must be really good.”
What is most surprising about this theory of advertising is that the content of 
the advertisement is irrelevant. Kellogg signals the quality of its product by its 
willingness to spend money on advertising. What the advertisements say is not as 
important as the fact that consumers know ads are expensive. By contrast, cheap 
advertising cannot be effective at signaling quality to consumers. In our example, 
if an advertising campaign cost less than $3 million, both Post and Kellogg would 
use it to market their new cereals. Because both good and bad cereals would be 
advertised, consumers could not infer the quality of a new cereal from the fact 
that it is advertised. Over time, consumers would learn to ignore such cheap 
advertising.
This theory can explain why firms pay famous actors large amounts of money 
to make advertisements that, on the surface, appear to convey no information at 
all. The information is not in the advertisement’s content but simply in its exis-
tence and expense.
16-3c Brand Names
Advertising is closely related to the existence of brand names. In many markets, 
there are two types of firms. Some firms sell products with widely recognized 
brand names, while other firms sell generic substitutes. For example, in a typi-
cal drugstore, you can find Bayer aspirin on the shelf next to generic aspirin. In a 
typical grocery store, you can find Pepsi next to less familiar colas. Most often, the 
firm with the brand name spends more on advertising and charges a higher price 
for its product.
Just as there is disagreement about the economics of advertising, there is dis-
agreement about the economics of brand names. Let’s consider both sides of the 
debate.
Critics argue that brand names cause consumers to perceive differences that do 
not really exist. In many cases, the generic good is almost indistinguishable from 
the brand-name good. Consumers’ willingness to pay more for the brand-name 
good, these critics assert, is a form of irrationality fostered by advertising. Econo-
mist Edward Chamberlin, one of the early developers of the theory of monopo-
listic competition, concluded from this argument that brand names were bad for 
the economy. He proposed that the government discourage their use by refusing 
to enforce the exclusive trademarks that companies use to identify their products.
More recently, economists have defended brand names as a useful way for 
consumers to ensure that the goods they buy are of high quality. There are two 
related arguments. First, brand names provide consumers with information about 
quality when quality cannot be easily judged in advance of purchase. Second, 
brand names give firms an incentive to maintain high quality because firms have a 
financial stake in maintaining the reputation of their brand names.
To see how these arguments work in practice, consider a famous brand name: 
McDonald’s hamburgers. Imagine that you are driving through an unfamiliar 
town and want to stop for lunch. You see a McDonald’s and a local restaurant 
next to it. Which do you choose? The local restaurant may in fact offer better food 
at lower prices, but you have no way of knowing that. By contrast, McDonald’s 
offers a consistent product across many cities. Its brand name is useful to you as a 
way of judging the quality of what you are about to buy.
The McDonald’s brand name also ensures that the company has an incen-
tive to maintain quality. For example, if some customers were to become ill from

bad food sold at a McDonald’s, the news would be disastrous for the company.  
McDonald’s would lose much of the valuable reputation that it has built up with 
years of expensive advertising. As a result, it would lose sales and profit not just 
in the outlet that sold the bad food but in its many outlets throughout the country. 
By contrast, if some customers were to become ill from bad food at a local restau-
rant, that restaurant might have to close down, but the lost profits would be much 
smaller. Hence, McDonald’s has a greater incentive to ensure that its food is safe.
The debate over brand names thus centers on the question of whether con-
sumers are rational in preferring brand names to generic substitutes. Critics 
argue that brand names are the result of an irrational consumer response to 
­advertising. Defenders argue that consumers have good reason to pay more for 
brand-name products because they can be more confident in the quality of these 
products.

16-4 Conclusion
Monopolistic competition is true to its name: It is a hybrid of monopoly and 
competition. Like a monopoly, each monopolistic competitor faces a downward-­
sloping demand curve and, as a result, charges a price above marginal cost. As in 
a perfectly competitive market, there are many firms, and entry and exit drive the 
profit of each monopolistic competitor toward zero in the long run. Table 1 sum-
marizes these lessons.
Because monopolistically competitive firms produce differentiated prod-
ucts, each firm advertises to attract customers to its own brand. To some extent, 
­advertising manipulates consumers’ tastes, promotes irrational brand loyalty, and 
impedes competition. To a larger extent, advertising provides information, estab-
lishes brand names of reliable quality, and fosters competition.
The theory of monopolistic competition seems to describe many markets in the 
economy. It is somewhat disappointing, therefore, that the theory does not yield 
simple and compelling advice for public policy. From the standpoint of the eco-
nomic theorist, the allocation of resources in monopolistically competitive mar-
kets is not perfect. Yet from the standpoint of a practical policymaker, there may 
be little that can be done to improve it.

•	
A monopolistically competitive market is character-
ized by three attributes: many firms, differentiated 
products, and free entry.
•	
The long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically competi-
tive market differs from that in a perfectly ­competitive 
market in two related ways. First, each firm in a 
­monopolistically competitive market has excess ­capacity. 
That is, it chooses a quantity that puts it on the down-
ward-sloping portion of the average-total-cost curve. 
Second, each firm charges a price above ­marginal cost.
•	
Monopolistic competition does not have all the 
­desirable properties of perfect competition. There is 
the standard deadweight loss of monopoly caused by 
the markup of price over marginal cost. In addition, 
the number of firms (and thus the variety of products) 
can be too large or too small. In practice, the ability of 
policymakers to correct these inefficiencies is limited.
•	
The product differentiation inherent in monopolistic 
competition leads to the use of advertising and brand 
names. Critics of advertising and brand names argue 
that firms use them to manipulate consumers’ tastes 
and to reduce competition. Defenders of advertising 
and brand names argue that firms use them to inform 
consumers and to compete more vigorously on price 
and product quality.

Oligopoly
I
f you go to a store to buy tennis balls, you will probably come home with one 
of four brands: Wilson, Penn, Dunlop, or Spalding. These four companies make 
almost all the tennis balls sold in the United States. Together these firms deter-
mine the quantity of tennis balls produced and, given the market demand curve, 
the price at which tennis balls are sold.
The market for tennis balls is an example of an oligopoly. The essence of an oli-
gopolistic market is that there are only a few sellers. As a result, the actions of any 
one seller in the market can have a large impact on the profits of all the other sell-
ers. Oligopolistic firms are interdependent in a way that competitive firms 
are not. Our goal in this chapter is to see how this interdependence shapes 
the firms’ behavior and what problems it raises for public policy.

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
The analysis of oligopoly offers an opportunity to introduce game theory, the 
study of how people behave in strategic situations. By “strategic” we mean a situ-
ation in which a person, when choosing among alternative courses of action, must 
consider how others might respond to the action she takes. Strategic thinking is 
crucial not only in checkers, chess, and tic-tac-toe but also in many business deci-
sions. Because oligopolistic markets have only a small number of firms, each firm 
must act strategically. Each firm knows that its profit depends not only on how 
much it produces but also on how much the other firms produce. In making its 
production decision, each firm in an oligopoly should consider how its decision 
might affect the production decisions of all the other firms in the market.
Game theory is not necessary for understanding competitive or monopoly 
­markets. In a market that is either perfectly competitive or monopolistically com-
petitive, each firm is so small compared to the market that strategic interactions 
with other firms are not important. In a monopolized market, strategic interactions 
are absent because the market has only one firm. But, as we will see, game theory 
is useful for understanding oligopolies and many other situations in which a small 
number of players interact with one another. Game theory helps explain the strate-
gies that people choose, whether they are playing tennis or selling tennis balls.

17-1 Markets with Only a Few Sellers
Because an oligopolistic market has only a small group of sellers, a key feature of 
oligopoly is the tension between cooperation and self-interest. The oligopolists 
are best off when they cooperate and act like a monopolist—producing a small 
quantity of output and charging a price above marginal cost. Yet because each 
­oligopolist cares only about its own profit, there are powerful incentives at work 
that hinder a group of firms from maintaining the cooperative outcome.
17-1a A Duopoly Example
To understand the behavior of oligopolies, let’s consider an oligopoly with 
only two members, called a duopoly. Duopoly is the simplest type of oligopoly. 
­Oligopolies with three or more members face the same problems as duopolies, so 
we do not lose much by starting with the simpler case.
Imagine a town in which only two residents—Jack and Jill—own wells that 
produce water safe for drinking. Each Saturday, Jack and Jill decide how many 
gallons of water to pump, bring the water to town, and sell it for whatever price 
the market will bear. To keep things simple, suppose that Jack and Jill can pump 
as much water as they want without cost. That is, the marginal cost of water 
equals zero.
Table 1 shows the town’s demand schedule for water. The first column shows 
the total quantity demanded, and the second column shows the price. If the two 
well owners sell a total of 10 gallons of water, water goes for $110 a gallon. If they 
sell a total of 20 gallons, the price falls to $100 a gallon. And so on. If you graphed 
these two columns of numbers, you would get a standard downward-sloping 
­demand curve.
The last column in Table 1 shows the total revenue from the sale of water. 
It equals the quantity sold times the price. Because there is no cost to pumping 
water, the total revenue of the two producers equals their total profit.

CHAPTER 17  OLIGOPOLY
349
Let’s now consider how the organization of the town’s water industry affects 
the price of water and the quantity of water sold.
17-1b Competition, Monopolies, and Cartels
Before considering the price and quantity of water that would result from the 
­duopoly of Jack and Jill, let’s discuss briefly what the outcome would be if the 
water market were either perfectly competitive or monopolistic. These two polar 
cases are natural benchmarks.
If the market for water were perfectly competitive, the production decisions 
of each firm would drive price equal to marginal cost. Because we have assumed 
that the marginal cost of pumping additional water is zero, the equilibrium price 
of water under perfect competition would be zero as well. The equilibrium quan-
tity would be 120 gallons. The price of water would reflect the cost of producing 
it, and the efficient quantity of water would be produced and consumed.
Now consider how a monopoly would behave. Table 1 shows that total profit 
is maximized at a quantity of 60 gallons and a price of $60 a gallon. A profit-
maximizing monopolist, therefore, would produce this quantity and charge this 
price. As is standard for monopolies, price would exceed marginal cost. The ­result 
would be inefficient, because the quantity of water produced and consumed 
would fall short of the socially efficient level of 120 gallons.
What outcome should we expect from our duopolists? One possibility is that 
Jack and Jill get together and agree on the quantity of water to produce and the 
price to charge for it. Such an agreement among firms over production and price 
is called collusion, and the group of firms acting in unison is called a cartel. 
Once a cartel is formed, the market is in effect served by a monopoly and we 
can ­apply our analysis from Chapter 15. That is, if Jack and Jill were to collude, 
they would agree on the monopoly outcome because that outcome maximizes the 
­total profit that they can get from the market. Our two producers would produce

a ­total of 60 gallons, which would be sold at a price of $60 a gallon. Once again, 
price ­exceeds marginal cost, and the outcome is socially inefficient.
A cartel must agree not only on the total level of production but also on the 
amount produced by each member. In our case, Jack and Jill must agree on how to 
split the monopoly production of 60 gallons. Each member of the cartel will want 
a larger share of the market because a larger market share means larger profit. 
If Jack and Jill agreed to split the market equally, each would produce 30 gallons, 
the price would be $60 a gallon, and each would get a profit of $1,800.
Market Talk
By Alistair Lindsay
M
ost companies have antitrust compli-
ance policies. They typically—and quite 
rightly—identify a number of things that 
­officers and employees should not do, on pain 
of criminal liability, eye-watering fines and 
unlimited damages actions. All make clear 
that companies must not agree with their 
competitors to fix prices. This is a bright-line 
rule. But it raises an important question: Can 
companies coordinate price increases without 
infringing the cartel rules?
In markets where competitors need to 
publish their prices to win business—for 
­example, many retail markets—it is perfectly 
lawful to shadow a rival’s increases, so long 
as each seller acts entirely independently in 
setting its charges. The very definition of an 
oligopoly is a market involving a small num-
ber of suppliers that set their own commercial 
strategies but take account of their competi-
tors. One competitor may emerge as a leader, 
with others taking their cue on when to raise 
prices and by how much.
When prices are privately negotiated—as 
in many industrials markets—it is common 
for a customer to volunteer information about 
a rival’s prices to obtain leverage: “You’ve 
quoted £100 per ton, but X is offering £95 
and I’m going to them unless you can do 
­better.” A company that receives this infor-
mation obtains valuable intelligence about 
what its rivals are charging, but it does not 
infringe cartel rules. . . .
Companies also sometimes signal to one 
another in their communications with inves-
tors, whether deliberately or not. A competi-
tor which informs the markets, say, that it 
expects a price war to end in February is 
providing relevant information to actual and 
potential owners of its stock. But of course its 
rivals read the same reports and can change 
their strategies accordingly. So a statement 
to the market can serve as just as much of 
a signal to competitors as a statement made 
during a cartel meeting. . . .
Signaling through investor communica-
tions raises difficult questions for cartel 
enforcement. The enforcers want to protect 
consumers from the adverse effects of bla-
tant signaling, but not at the price of ­losing 
transparency in financial markets. For 
­example, it is highly relevant to an investor to 
know an airline’s predicted growth of per-mile 
passenger revenue for the next quarter. But a 
rival airline might use the announced figure 
as a benchmark when setting its own fares 
for the next quarter.
As things stand, cartel authorities have 
focused their efforts in such situations on 
blocking mergers in markets where signaling 
is prevalent, arguing that consolidation in such 
markets can further dampen competition by 
making coordination easier or more successful. 
However, they have not taken high-profile ­action 
alleging cartel infringements against compa-
nies for announcements made to investors.
If there is no justification for a ­particular 
announcement other than to signal to 
­competitors, cartel authorities should seek 
to intervene. For in this case the public 
­announcement is analytically the same as a 
private discussion directly with the rivals, and 
there is scope for consumers to be seriously 
harmed. But most announcements do serve 
­legitimate purposes, such as keeping ­investors 
informed. In these cases, intervention by the 
cartel authorities seems too complex, given the 
disparate policy objectives in play.

CHAPTER 17  OLIGOPOLY
351
17-1c The Equilibrium for an Oligopoly
Oligopolists would like to form cartels and earn monopoly profits, but that is 
­often impossible. Squabbling among cartel members over how to divide the profit 
in the market can make agreement among members difficult. In addition, anti-
trust laws prohibit explicit agreements among oligopolists as a matter of public 
policy. Even talking about pricing and production restrictions with competitors 
can be a criminal offense. Let’s therefore consider what happens if Jack and Jill 
decide separately how much water to produce.
At first, one might expect Jack and Jill to reach the monopoly outcome on their 
own, because this outcome maximizes their joint profit. In the absence of a bind-
ing agreement, however, the monopoly outcome is unlikely. To see why, imagine 
that Jack expects Jill to produce only 30 gallons (half of the monopoly quantity). 
Jack would reason as follows:
“I could produce 30 gallons as well. In this case, a total of 60 gallons of water 
would be sold at a price of $60 a gallon. My profit would be $1,800 (30 gallons × 
$60 a gallon). Alternatively, I could produce 40 gallons. In this case, a total of 
70 ­gallons of water would be sold at a price of $50 a gallon. My profit would be 
$2,000 (40 gallons × $50 a gallon). Even though total profit in the market would 
fall, my profit would be higher, because I would have a larger share of the market.”
Of course, Jill might reason the same way. If so, Jack and Jill would each bring 
40 gallons to town. Total sales would be 80 gallons, and the price would fall to $40. 
Thus, if the duopolists individually pursue their own self-interest when deciding 
how much to produce, they produce a total quantity greater than the monopoly 
quantity, charge a price lower than the monopoly price, and earn total profit less 
than the monopoly profit.
Although the logic of self-interest increases the duopoly’s output above the 
monopoly level, it does not push the duopolists all the way to the competitive 
­allocation. Consider what happens when each duopolist produces 40 gallons. The 
price is $40, and each duopolist makes a profit of $1,600. In this case, Jack’s self-
interested logic leads to a different conclusion:
“Right now, my profit is $1,600. Suppose I increase my production to 50 ­gallons. 
In this case, a total of 90 gallons of water would be sold, and the price would be 
$30 a gallon. Then my profit would be only $1,500. Rather than increasing pro-
duction and driving down the price, I am better off keeping my production at 
40 gallons.”
The outcome in which Jack and Jill each produce 40 gallons looks like some 
sort of equilibrium. In fact, this outcome is called a Nash equilibrium. (It is named 
­after economic theorist John Nash, whose life was portrayed in the book and 
movie A Beautiful Mind.) A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which economic 
actors interacting with one another each choose their best strategy given the strat-
egies the others have chosen. In this case, given that Jill is producing 40 gallons, 
the best strategy for Jack is to produce 40 gallons. ­Similarly, given that Jack is 
producing 40 gallons, the best strategy for Jill is to produce 40 gallons. Once they 
reach this Nash equilibrium, neither Jack nor Jill has an incentive to make a differ-
ent decision.
This example illustrates the tension between cooperation and self-interest. 
­Oligopolists would be better off cooperating and reaching the monopoly outcome. 
Yet because they pursue their own self-interest, they do not end up reaching the 
monopoly outcome and maximizing their joint profit. Each oligopolist is tempted 
to raise production and capture a larger share of the market. As each of them tries 
to do this, total production rises, and the price falls.

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
At the same time, self-interest does not drive the market all the way to the 
competitive outcome. Like monopolists, oligopolists are aware that increasing 
the amount they produce reduces the price of their product, which in turn affects 
profits. Therefore, they stop short of following the competitive firm’s rule of pro-
ducing up to the point where price equals marginal cost.
In summary, when firms in an oligopoly individually choose production to maximize 
profit, they produce a quantity of output greater than the level produced by monopoly and 
less than the level produced by perfect competition. The oligopoly price is less than the 
­monopoly price but greater than the competitive price (which equals marginal cost).
17-1d How the Size of an Oligopoly Affects 
the Market Outcome
We can use the insights from this analysis of duopoly to discuss how the size of 
an oligopoly is likely to affect the outcome in a market. Suppose, for instance, 
that John and Joan suddenly discover water sources on their property and join 
Jack and Jill in the water oligopoly. The demand schedule in Table 1 remains the 
same, but now more producers are available to satisfy this demand. How would 
an increase in the number of sellers from two to four affect the price and quantity 
of water in the town?
If the sellers of water could form a cartel, they would once again try to maxi-
mize total profit by producing the monopoly quantity and charging the monopoly 
price. Just as when there were only two sellers, the members of the cartel would 
need to agree on production levels for each member and find some way to enforce 
the agreement. As the cartel grows larger, however, this outcome is less likely. 
Reaching and enforcing an agreement becomes more difficult as the size of the 
group increases.
If the oligopolists do not form a cartel—perhaps because the antitrust laws 
­prohibit it—they must each decide on their own how much water to produce.  
To see how the increase in the number of sellers affects the outcome, consider  
the ­decision facing each seller. At any time, each well owner has the option to 
raise production by one gallon. In making this decision, the well owner weighs 
the following two effects:
•	 The output effect: Because price is above marginal cost, selling one more gallon 
of water at the going price will raise profit.
•	 The price effect: Raising production will increase the total amount sold, which 
will lower the price of water and lower the profit on all the other gallons sold.
If the output effect is larger than the price effect, the well owner will increase pro-
duction. If the price effect is larger than the output effect, the owner will not raise 
production. (In fact, in this case, it is profitable to reduce production.) Each oli-
gopolist continues to increase production until these two marginal effects exactly 
balance, taking the other firms’ production as given.
Now consider how the number of firms in the industry affects the marginal 
analysis of each oligopolist. The larger the number of sellers, the less each seller 
is concerned about her own impact on the market price. That is, as the oligopoly 
grows in size, the magnitude of the price effect falls. When the oligopoly grows 
very large, the price effect disappears altogether. That is, the production deci-
sion of an individual firm no longer affects the market price. In this extreme case, 
each firm takes the market price as given when deciding how much to produce. It 
­increases production as long as price is above marginal cost.

CHAPTER 17  OLIGOPOLY
353
We can now see that a large oligopoly is essentially a group of competitive 
firms. A competitive firm considers only the output effect when deciding how 
much to produce: Because a competitive firm is a price taker, the price effect is 
­absent. Thus, as the number of sellers in an oligopoly grows larger, an oligopolistic 
­market looks more and more like a competitive market. The price approaches marginal cost, 
and the quantity produced approaches the socially efficient level.
This analysis of oligopoly offers a new perspective on the effects of interna-
tional trade. Imagine that Toyota and Honda are the only automakers in ­Japan, 
Volkswagen and BMW are the only automakers in Germany, and Ford and 
­General Motors are the only automakers in the United States. If these nations pro-
hibited international trade in autos, each would have an auto oligopoly with only 
two members, and the market outcome would likely depart substantially from 
the competitive ideal. With international trade, however, the car market is a world 
market, and the oligopoly in this example has six members. Allowing free trade 
increases the number of producers from which each consumer can choose, and 
this increased competition keeps prices closer to marginal cost. Thus, the theory 
of oligopoly provides another reason, in addition to the theory of comparative 
advantage discussed in Chapter 3, why all countries can benefit from free trade.
Quick Quiz  If the members of an oligopoly could agree on a total quantity to produce, 
what quantity would they choose? • If the oligopolists do not act together but instead make 
production decisions individually, do they produce a total quantity more or less than in your 
answer to the previous question? Why?
17-2 The Economics of Cooperation
As we have seen, oligopolies would like to reach the monopoly outcome. ­Doing 
so, however, requires cooperation, which at times is difficult to establish and 
maintain. In this section we look more closely at the problems that arise when 
cooperation among actors is desirable but difficult. To analyze the economics of 
cooperation, we need to learn a little about game theory.
In particular, we focus on a “game” called the prisoners’ dilemma, which pro-
vides insight into why cooperation is difficult. Many times in life, people fail to 
cooperate with one another even when cooperation would make them all better 
off. An oligopoly is just one example. The story of the prisoners’ dilemma con-
tains a general lesson that applies to any group trying to maintain cooperation 
among its members.
17-2a The Prisoners’ Dilemma
The prisoners’ dilemma is a story about two criminals who have been captured by 
the police. Let’s call them Bonnie and Clyde. The police have enough evidence to 
convict Bonnie and Clyde of the minor crime of carrying an unregistered gun, so 
that each would spend a year in jail. The police also suspect that the two criminals 
have committed a bank robbery together, but they lack hard evidence to convict 
them of this major crime. The police question Bonnie and Clyde in separate rooms 
and offer each of them the following deal:
“Right now, we can lock you up for 1 year. If you confess to the bank robbery 
and implicate your partner, however, we’ll give you immunity and you can go 
free. Your partner will get 20 years in jail. But if you both confess to the crime, we

won’t need your testimony and we can avoid the cost of a trial, so you will each 
get an intermediate sentence of 8 years.”
If Bonnie and Clyde, heartless bank robbers that they are, care only about their 
own sentences, what would you expect them to do? Figure 1 shows their choices. 
Each prisoner has two strategies: confess or remain silent. The sentence each pris-
oner gets depends on the strategy he or she chooses and the strategy chosen by 
his or her partner in crime.
Consider first Bonnie’s decision. She reasons as follows: “I don’t know what 
Clyde is going to do. If he remains silent, my best strategy is to confess, since then 
I’ll go free rather than spending a year in jail. If he confesses, my best strategy is 
still to confess, since then I’ll spend 8 years in jail rather than 20. So, regardless of 
what Clyde does, I am better off confessing.”
In the language of game theory, a strategy is called a dominant strategy if 
it is the best strategy for a player to follow regardless of the strategies pursued 
by other players. In this case, confessing is a dominant strategy for Bonnie. She 
spends less time in jail if she confesses, regardless of whether Clyde confesses or 
remains silent.
Now consider Clyde’s decision. He faces the same choices as Bonnie, and he 
reasons in much the same way. Regardless of what Bonnie does, Clyde can reduce 
his jail time by confessing. In other words, confessing is also a dominant strategy 
for Clyde.
In the end, both Bonnie and Clyde confess, and both spend 8 years in jail. This 
outcome is a Nash equilibrium: Each criminal is choosing the best strategy avail-
able, given the strategy the other is following. Yet, from their standpoint, the out-
come is terrible. If they had both remained silent, both of them would have been 
better off, spending only 1 year in jail on the gun charge. Because each pursues his 
or her own interests, the two prisoners together reach an outcome that is worse 
for each of them.
You might have thought that Bonnie and Clyde would have foreseen this sit-
uation and planned ahead. But even with advanced planning, they would still 
run into problems. Imagine that, before the police captured Bonnie and Clyde, 
the two criminals had made a pact not to confess. Clearly, this agreement would 
make them both better off if they both lived up to it, because they would each 
spend only 1 year in jail. But would the two criminals in fact remain silent, simply

because they had agreed to? Once they are being questioned separately, the logic 
of self-interest takes over and leads them to confess. Cooperation between the two 
prisoners is difficult to maintain, because cooperation is individually irrational.
17-2b Oligopolies as a Prisoners’ Dilemma
What does the prisoners’ dilemma have to do with markets and imperfect compe-
tition? It turns out that the game oligopolists play in trying to reach the monop-
oly outcome is similar to the game that the two prisoners play in the prisoners’ 
dilemma.
Consider again the choices facing Jack and Jill. After prolonged negotiation, the 
two suppliers of water agree to keep production at 30 gallons so that the price will 
be kept high and together they will earn the maximum profit. After they agree on 
production levels, however, each of them must decide whether to cooperate and 
live up to this agreement or to ignore it and produce at a higher level. Figure 2 
shows how the profits of the two producers depend on the strategies they choose.
Suppose you are Jack. You might reason as follows: “I could keep production 
at 30 gallons as we agreed, or I could raise my production and sell 40 ­gallons. 
If Jill lives up to the agreement and keeps her production at 30 gallons, then I earn 
profit of $2,000 by selling 40 gallons and $1,800 by selling 30 gallons. In this case, 
I am better off with the higher-level production. If Jill fails to live up to the agree-
ment and produces 40 gallons, then I earn $1,600 by selling 40 gallons and $1,500 
by selling 30 gallons. Once again, I am better off with higher production. So, 
­regardless of what Jill chooses to do, I am better off reneging on our agreement 
and producing at the higher level.”
Producing 40 gallons is a dominant strategy for Jack. Of course, Jill reasons in 
exactly the same way, and so both produce at the higher level of 40 gallons. The 
result is the inferior outcome (from Jack and Jill’s standpoint) with low profits for 
each of the two producers.
This example illustrates why oligopolies have trouble maintaining monop-
oly profits. The monopoly outcome is jointly rational, but each oligopolist has 
an ­incentive to cheat. Just as self-interest drives the prisoners in the prisoners’ 
­dilemma to confess, self-interest makes it difficult for the oligopolists to maintain 
the cooperative outcome with low production, high prices, and monopoly profits.
FIGURE 2

Jill, the profit that each earns

OPEC and the World Oil Market
Our story about the town’s market for water is fictional, but if we 
change water to crude oil, and Jack and Jill to Iran and Iraq, the story is 
close to being true. Much of the world’s oil is produced by a few countries, 
mostly in the Middle East. These countries together make up an oligopoly. 
Their decisions about how much oil to pump are much the same as Jack and Jill’s 
decisions about how much water to pump.
The countries that produce most of the world’s oil have formed a cartel, called 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As originally formed 
in 1960, OPEC included Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. By 1973, 
eight other nations had joined: Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, the United Arab Emir-
ates, Algeria, Nigeria, Ecuador, and Gabon. These countries control about three-
fourths of the world’s oil reserves. Like any cartel, OPEC tries to raise the price of 
its product through a coordinated reduction in quantity produced. OPEC tries to 
set production levels for each of the member countries.
The problem that OPEC faces is much the same as the problem that Jack and 
Jill face in our story. The OPEC countries would like to maintain a high price for 
oil. But each member of the cartel is tempted to increase its production to get a 
larger share of the total profit. OPEC members frequently agree to reduce produc-
tion but then cheat on their agreements.
OPEC was most successful at maintaining cooperation and high prices in the 
period from 1973 to 1985. The price of crude oil rose from $3 a barrel in 1972 to 
$11 in 1974 and then to $35 in 1981. But in the mid-1980s, member countries began 
arguing about production levels, and OPEC became ineffective at maintaining 
­cooperation. By 1986 the price of crude oil had fallen back to $13 a barrel.
In recent years, the members of OPEC have continued to meet regularly, but 
they have been less successful at reaching and enforcing agreements. As a result, 
fluctuations in oil prices have been driven more by the natural forces of sup-
ply and demand than by the cartel’s artificial restrictions on production. While 
this lack of cooperation among OPEC nations has reduced the profits of the oil-­
producing nations below what they might have been, it has benefited consumers 
around the world.

17-2c Other Examples of the Prisoners’ Dilemma
We have seen how the prisoners’ dilemma can be used to understand the problem 
facing oligopolies. The same logic applies to many other situations as well. Here 
we consider two examples in which self-interest prevents cooperation and leads 
to an inferior outcome for the parties involved.
Arms Races  In the decades after World War II, the world’s two superpowers—
the United States and the Soviet Union—were engaged in a prolonged competi-
tion over military power. This topic motivated some of the early work on game 
theory. The game theorists pointed out that an arms race is much like the prison-
ers’ dilemma.
To see why, consider the decisions of the United States and the Soviet Union 
about whether to build new weapons or to disarm. Each country prefers to have 
more arms than the other because a larger arsenal would give it more influence in 
world affairs. But each country also prefers to live in a world safe from the other 
country’s weapons.

CHAPTER 17  OLIGOPOLY
357
Figure 3 shows the deadly game. If the Soviet Union chooses to arm, the United 
States is better off doing the same to prevent the loss of power. If the Soviet Union 
chooses to disarm, the United States is better off arming because doing so would 
make it more powerful. For each country, arming is a dominant strategy. Thus, 
each country chooses to continue the arms race, resulting in the inferior outcome 
with both countries at risk.
Throughout the Cold War era from about 1945 to 1991, the United States and 
the Soviet Union attempted to solve this problem through negotiation and agree-
ments over arms control. The problems that the two countries faced were similar 
to those that oligopolists encounter in trying to maintain a cartel. Just as oligopo-
lists argue over production levels, the United States and the Soviet Union argued 
over the amount of arms that each country would be allowed. And just as cartels 
have trouble enforcing production levels, the United States and the Soviet Union 
each feared that the other country would cheat on any agreement. In both arms 
races and oligopolies, the relentless logic of self-interest drives the participants 
toward the noncooperative outcome, which is worse for both parties.
Common Resources  In Chapter 11 we saw that people tend to overuse common 
resources. One can view this problem as an example of the prisoners’ ­dilemma.
Imagine that two oil companies—Exxon and Texaco—own adjacent oil fields. 
Under the fields is a common pool of oil worth $12 million. Drilling a well to 
­recover the oil costs $1 million. If each company drills one well, each will get half 
of the oil and earn a $5 million profit ($6 million in revenue minus $1 million in 
costs).
Because the pool of oil is a common resource, the companies will not use it 
­efficiently. Suppose that either company could drill a second well. If one company 
has two of the three wells, that company gets two-thirds of the oil, which yields 
a profit of $6 million. The other company gets one-third of the oil, for a profit of 
$3 million. Yet if each company drills a second well, the two companies again split 
the oil. In this case, each bears the cost of a second well, so profit is only $4 million 
for each company.

Figure 4 shows the game. Drilling two wells is a dominant strategy for each 
company. Once again, the self-interest of the two players leads them to an inferior 
outcome.
17-2d The Prisoners’ Dilemma and the Welfare 
of Society
The prisoners’ dilemma describes many of life’s situations, and it shows that 
­cooperation can be difficult to maintain, even when cooperation would make 
both players in the game better off. Clearly, this lack of cooperation is a problem 
for those involved in these situations. But is lack of cooperation a problem from 
the standpoint of society as a whole? The answer depends on the circumstances.
In some cases, the noncooperative equilibrium is bad for society as well as the 
players. In the arms-race game in Figure 3, both the United States and the Soviet 
Union end up at risk. In the common-resources game in Figure 4, the extra wells 
dug by Texaco and Exxon are pure waste. In both cases, society would be better 
off if the two players could reach the cooperative outcome.
By contrast, in the case of oligopolists trying to maintain monopoly profits, lack 
of cooperation is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole. The monopoly 
outcome is good for the oligopolists, but it is bad for the consumers of the product. 
As we first saw in Chapter 7, the competitive outcome is best for society because it 
maximizes total surplus. When oligopolists fail to cooperate, the quantity they pro-
duce is closer to this optimal level. Put differently, the invisible hand guides markets 
to allocate resources efficiently only when markets are competitive, and markets are 
competitive only when firms in the market fail to cooperate with one another.
Similarly, consider the case of the police questioning two suspects. Lack of 
cooperation between the suspects is desirable, for it allows the police to convict 
more criminals. The prisoners’ dilemma is a dilemma for the prisoners, but it can 
be a boon to everyone else.
17-2e Why People Sometimes Cooperate
The prisoners’ dilemma shows that cooperation is difficult. But is it impossible? 
Not all prisoners, when questioned by the police, decide to turn in their partners 
in crime. Cartels sometimes manage to maintain collusive arrangements, despite

the incentive for individual members to defect. Very often, players can solve the 
prisoners’ dilemma because they play the game not once but many times.
To see why cooperation is easier to enforce in repeated games, let’s return to 
our duopolists, Jack and Jill, whose choices were given in Figure 2. Jack and Jill 
would like to agree to maintain the monopoly outcome in which each produces 
30 gallons. Yet, if Jack and Jill are to play this game only once, neither has any 
incentive to live up to this agreement. Self-interest drives each of them to renege 
and choose the dominant strategy of 40 gallons.
Now suppose that Jack and Jill know that they will play the same game every 
week. When they make their initial agreement to keep production low, they can 
also specify what happens if one party reneges. They might agree, for instance, 
that once one of them reneges and produces 40 gallons, both of them will produce 
40 gallons forever after. This penalty is easy to enforce, for if one party is produc-
ing at a high level, the other has every reason to do the same.
The threat of this penalty may be all that is needed to maintain cooperation. 
Each person knows that defecting would raise his or her profit from $1,800 to 
$2,000. But this benefit would last for only one week. Thereafter, profit would fall 
to $1,600 and stay there. As long as the players care enough about future profits, 
they will choose to forgo the one-time gain from defection. Thus, in a game of 
repeated prisoners’ dilemma, the two players may well be able to reach the coop-
erative outcome.
The Prisoners’ Dilemma Tournament
Imagine that you are playing a game of prisoners’ dilemma with a 
­person being “questioned” in a separate room. Moreover, imagine that 
you are going to play not once but many times. Your score at the end of the 
game is the total number of years in jail. You would like to make this score as 
small as possible. What strategy would you play? Would you begin by confessing 
or remaining silent? How would the other player’s actions affect your subsequent 
decisions about confessing?
Repeated prisoners’ dilemma is a complicated game. To encourage cooperation, 
players must penalize each other for not cooperating. Yet the strategy ­described 
earlier for Jack and Jill’s water cartel—defect forever as soon as the other player 
defects—is not very forgiving. In a game repeated many times, a strategy that 
allows players to return to the cooperative outcome after a period of noncoopera-
tion may be preferable.
To see what strategies work best, political scientist Robert Axelrod held a tour-
nament. People entered by sending computer programs designed to play repeated 
prisoners’ dilemma. Each program then played the game against all the other pro-
grams. The “winner” was the program that received the fewest total years in jail.
The winner turned out to be a simple strategy called tit-for-tat. According to 
tit-for-tat, a player should start by cooperating and then do whatever the other 
player did last time. Thus, a tit-for-tat player cooperates until the other player 
defects; then she defects until the other player cooperates again. In other words, 
this strategy starts out friendly, penalizes unfriendly players, and forgives them if 
warranted. To Axelrod’s surprise, this simple strategy did better than all the more 
complicated strategies that people had sent in.
The tit-for-tat strategy has a long history. It is essentially the biblical strategy of 
“an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” The prisoners’ dilemma tournament sug-
gests that this may be a good rule of thumb for playing some of the games of life.

17-3 Public Policy toward Oligopolies
Quick Quiz  Tell the story of the prisoners’ dilemma. Write down a table showing the 
prisoners’ choices and explain what outcome is likely. • What does the prisoners’ dilemma 
teach us about oligopolies?
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can some-
times improve market outcomes. This principle applies directly to oligopolistic 
markets. As we have seen, cooperation among oligopolists is undesirable from 
the standpoint of society as a whole because it leads to production that is too low 
and prices that are too high. To move the allocation of resources closer to the ­social 
­optimum, policymakers should try to induce firms in an oligopoly to compete 
rather than cooperate. Let’s consider how policymakers do this and then ­examine 
the controversies that arise in this area of public policy.
17-3a Restraint of Trade and the Antitrust Laws
One way that policy discourages cooperation is through the common law. 
­Normally, freedom of contract is an essential part of a market economy. Businesses 
and households use contracts to arrange mutually advantageous trades. In doing 
this, they rely on the court system to enforce contracts. Yet, for many centuries, 
judges in England and the United States have deemed agreements among com-
petitors to reduce quantities and raise prices to be contrary to the public good. 
They have therefore refused to enforce such agreements.
The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 codified and reinforced this policy:
Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
­nations, is declared to be illegal. . . . Every person who shall monopolize, or 
­attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any person or persons to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or 
with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on convic-
tion thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or 
by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the 
discretion of the court.
The Sherman Act elevated agreements among oligopolists from unenforceable 
contracts to criminal conspiracies.
The Clayton Act of 1914 further strengthened the antitrust laws. According to 
this law, if a person could prove that she was damaged by an illegal arrangement 
to restrain trade, that person could sue and recover three times the damages she 
sustained. The purpose of this unusual rule of triple damages is to encourage  
private lawsuits against conspiring oligopolists.
Today, both the U.S. Justice Department and private parties have the authority 
to bring legal suits to enforce the antitrust laws. As we discussed in ­Chapter 15, 
these laws are used to prevent mergers that would lead to excessive market power 
in any single firm. In addition, these laws are used to prevent oligopolists from 
acting together in ways that would make their markets less competitive.

CHAPTER 17  OLIGOPOLY
361
An Illegal Phone Call
Firms in oligopolies have a strong incentive to collude in order to 
­reduce production, raise price, and increase profit. The great 18th-­century 
economist Adam Smith was well aware of this potential market failure. In 
The Wealth of Nations he wrote, “People of the same trade seldom meet together, 
but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some diversion 
to raise prices.” 
To see a modern example of Smith’s observation, consider the following ­excerpt 
of a phone conversation between two airline executives in the early 1980s. The 
call was reported in the New York Times on February 24, 1983. Robert ­Crandall was 
president of American Airlines, and Howard Putnam was president of ­Braniff 
Airways, a major airline at the time.
Crandall:  I think it’s dumb as hell . . . to sit here and pound the @#$% out of each 
other and neither one of us making a #$%& dime.
Putnam:  Do you have a suggestion for me?
Crandall:  Yes, I have a suggestion for you. Raise your $%*& fares 20 percent. 
I’ll raise mine the next morning.
Putnam:  Robert, we . . .
Crandall:  You’ll make more money, and I will, too.
Putnam:  We can’t talk about pricing!
Crandall:  Oh @#$%, Howard. We can talk about any &*#@ thing we want to talk 
about.
Putnam was right: The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits competing executives 
from even talking about fixing prices. When Putnam gave a tape of this conversa-
tion to the Justice Department, the Justice Department filed suit against Crandall.
Two years later, Crandall and the Justice Department reached a settlement in 
which Crandall agreed to various restrictions on his business activities, including 
his contacts with officials at other airlines. The Justice Department said that the 
terms of settlement would “protect competition in the airline industry, by pre-
venting American and Crandall from any further attempts to monopolize passen-
ger airline service on any route through discussions with competitors about the 
prices of airline services.”

17-3b Controversies over Antitrust Policy
Over time, much controversy has centered on what kinds of behavior the anti-
trust laws should prohibit. Most commentators agree that price-fixing agreements 
among competing firms should be illegal. Yet the antitrust laws have been used 
to condemn some business practices whose effects are not obvious. Here we con-
sider three examples.
Resale Price Maintenance  One example of a controversial business practice 
is resale price maintenance. Imagine that Superduper Electronics sells Blu-ray disc 
players to retail stores for $100. If Superduper requires the retailers to charge cus-
tomers $150, it is said to engage in resale price maintenance. Any retailer that 
charged less than $150 would violate its contract with Superduper.

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
At first, resale price maintenance might seem anticompetitive and, therefore, 
detrimental to society. Like an agreement among members of a cartel, it prevents 
the retailers from competing on price. For this reason, the courts have at times 
viewed resale price maintenance as a violation of the antitrust laws.
Yet some economists defend resale price maintenance on two grounds. First, 
they deny that it is aimed at reducing competition. To the extent that Superduper 
Electronics has any market power, it can exert that power through the wholesale 
price, rather than through resale price maintenance. Moreover, Superduper has 
no incentive to discourage competition among its retailers. Indeed, because a car-
tel of retailers sells less than a group of competitive retailers, Superduper would 
be worse off if its retailers were a cartel.
Second, economists believe that resale price maintenance has a legitimate goal. 
Superduper may want its retailers to provide customers a pleasant showroom and 
a knowledgeable sales force. Yet, without resale price maintenance, some custom-
ers would take advantage of one store’s service to learn about the Blu-ray player’s 
special features and then buy the item at a discount retailer that does not provide 
this service. To some extent, good service is a public good among the retailers 
that sell Superduper products. As we discussed in Chapter 11, when one person 
provides a public good, others are able to enjoy it without paying for it. In this 
case, discount retailers would free ride on the service provided by other retailers, 
leading to less service than is desirable. Resale price maintenance is one way for 
Superduper to solve this free-rider problem.
The example of resale price maintenance illustrates an important principle: 
Business practices that appear to reduce competition may in fact have legitimate purposes. 
This principle makes the application of the antitrust laws all the more difficult. 
The economists, lawyers, and judges in charge of enforcing these laws must deter-
mine what kinds of behavior public policy should prohibit as impeding competi-
tion and reducing economic well-being. Often that job is not easy.
Predatory Pricing  Firms with market power normally use that power to raise 
prices above the competitive level. But should policymakers ever be concerned 
that firms with market power might charge prices that are too low? This question 
is at the heart of a second debate over antitrust policy.
Imagine that a large airline, call it Coyote Air, has a monopoly on some route. 
Then Roadrunner Express enters and takes 20 percent of the market, leaving Coy-
ote with 80 percent. In response to this competition, Coyote starts slashing its 
fares. Some antitrust analysts argue that Coyote’s move could be anticompetitive: 
The price cuts may be intended to drive Roadrunner out of the market so Coyote 
can recapture its monopoly and raise prices again. Such behavior is called preda-
tory pricing.
Although predatory pricing is a common claim in antitrust suits, some econo-
mists are skeptical of this argument and believe that predatory pricing is rarely, 
if ever, a profitable business strategy. Why? For a price war to drive out a rival, 
prices have to be driven below cost. Yet if Coyote starts selling cheap tickets at 
a loss, it had better be ready to fly more planes, because low fares will attract 
more customers. Roadrunner, meanwhile, can respond to Coyote’s predatory 
move by cutting back on flights. As a result, Coyote ends up bearing more than 
80 percent of the losses, putting Roadrunner in a good position to survive the 
price war. As in the old Roadrunner–Coyote cartoons, the predator suffers more 
than the prey.

CHAPTER 17  OLIGOPOLY
363
Economists continue to debate whether predatory pricing should be a concern 
for antitrust policymakers. Various questions remain unresolved. Is predatory 
pricing ever a profitable business strategy? If so, when? Are the courts capable of 
telling which price cuts are competitive and thus good for consumers and which 
are predatory? There are no simple answers.
Tying  A third example of a controversial business practice is tying. Suppose 
that Makemoney Movies produces two new films—The Avengers and Hamlet. If 
­Makemoney offers theaters the two films together at a single price, rather than 
separately, the studio is said to be tying its two products.
When the practice of tying movies was challenged, the Supreme Court banned 
it. The court reasoned as follows: Imagine that The Avengers is a blockbuster, 
whereas Hamlet is an unprofitable art film. Then the studio could use the high 
demand for The Avengers to force theaters to buy Hamlet. It seemed that the studio 
could use tying as a mechanism for expanding its market power.
Many economists are skeptical of this argument. Imagine that theaters are will-
ing to pay $20,000 for The Avengers and nothing for Hamlet. Then the most that a 
theater would pay for the two movies together is $20,000—the same as it would 
pay for The Avengers by itself. Forcing the theater to accept a worthless movie as 
part of the deal does not increase the theater’s willingness to pay. Makemoney 
cannot increase its market power simply by bundling the two movies together.
Why, then, does tying exist? One possibility is that it is a form of price discrimi-
nation. Suppose there are two theaters. City Theater is willing to pay $15,000 for 
The Avengers and $5,000 for Hamlet. Country Theater is just the opposite: It is will-
ing to pay $5,000 for The Avengers and $15,000 for Hamlet. If Makemoney charges 
separate prices for the two films, its best strategy is to charge $15,000 for each film, 
and each theater chooses to show only one film. Yet if Makemoney offers the two 
movies as a bundle, it can charge each theater $20,000 for the movies. Thus, if dif-
ferent theaters value the films differently, tying may allow the studio to increase 
profit by charging a combined price closer to the buyers’ total willingness to pay.
Tying remains a controversial business practice. The Supreme Court’s argu-
ment that tying allows a firm to extend its market power to other goods is not 
well founded, at least in its simplest form. Yet economists have proposed more 
elaborate theories for how tying can impede competition. Given our current eco-
nomic knowledge, it is unclear whether tying has adverse effects for society as a 
whole.
The Microsoft Case
The most important and controversial antitrust case in recent years has 
been the U.S. government’s suit against the Microsoft Corporation, filed 
in 1998. Certainly, the case did not lack drama. It pitted one of the world’s 
richest men (Bill Gates) against one of the world’s most powerful regula-

operating system. The government claimed that Microsoft was bundling these 
two products together to expand its market power in computer operating systems 
into the unrelated market of Internet browsers. Allowing Microsoft to incorpo-
rate such products into its operating system, the government argued, would deter 
other software companies from entering the market and offering new products.
Microsoft responded by pointing out that putting new features into old prod-
ucts is a natural part of technological progress. Cars today include CD players 
and air conditioners, which were once sold separately, and cameras come with 
built-in flashes. The same is true with operating systems. Over time, Microsoft 
has added many features to Windows that were previously stand-alone products. 
This has made computers more reliable and easier to use because consumers can 
be confident that the pieces work together. The integration of Internet technology, 
Microsoft argued, was the natural next step.
One point of disagreement concerned the extent of Microsoft’s market power. 
Noting that more than 80 percent of new personal computers used a Microsoft 
operating system, the government argued that the company had substantial mo-
nopoly power, which it was trying to expand. Microsoft replied that the software 
market is always changing and that Microsoft’s Windows was constantly being 
challenged by competitors, such as the Apple Mac and Linux operating systems. 
It also argued that the low price it charged for Windows—about $50, or only 
3 percent of the price of a typical computer—was evidence that its market power 
was severely limited.
Like many large antitrust suits, the Microsoft case became a legal morass. In 
November 1999, after a long trial, Judge Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft had 
great monopoly power and that it had illegally abused that power. In June 2000, 
after hearings on possible remedies, he ordered that Microsoft be broken up into 
two companies—one that sold the operating system and one that sold applica-
tions software. A year later, an appeals court overturned Jackson’s breakup order 
and handed the case to a new judge. In September 2001, the Justice Department 
announced that it no longer sought a breakup of the company and wanted to set-
tle the case quickly.
A settlement was finally reached in November 2002. Microsoft accepted some 
restrictions on its business practices, and the government accepted that a browser 
would remain part of the Windows operating system. But the settlement did not 
end Microsoft’s antitrust troubles. In recent years, the company has contended 
with several private antitrust suits, as well as suits brought by the European 
Union alleging a variety of anticompetitive behaviors.

17-4 Conclusion
Oligopolies would like to act like monopolies, but self-interest drives them to-
ward competition. Where oligopolies end up on this spectrum depends on the 
number of firms in the oligopoly and how cooperative the firms are. The story of 
the prisoners’ dilemma shows why oligopolies can fail to maintain cooperation, 
even when cooperation is in their best interest.

CHAPTER 17  OLIGOPOLY
365
The College Sports 
­Cartel
By Joe Nocera
T
wice a year in Vienna, the members of 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
­Countries gather to decide on the short-term 
direction of oil prices. Sometimes, O.P.E.C. 
agrees to cut back on oil production, pushing 
up the price of oil. Other times, it decides to 
boost production. Always, the goal is to fix the 
price of oil, rather than allow it to be set by the 
competitive marketplace. Indeed, collusion 
and price-fixing are the main reasons cartels 
exist—and why they are illegal in America.
Yet, in Indianapolis a few weeks from 
now, a home-grown cartel will hold its 
­annual meeting, where it, too, will be work-
ing to collude and fix prices. This cartel is 
the National Collegiate Athletic Association. 
The N.C.A.A. would have you believe that it is 
the great protector of amateur athletics, pre-
venting college athletes from being tainted 
by the river of money pouring over college 
sports.
In fact, the N.C.A.A.’s real role is to over-
see the collusion of university athletic depart-
ments, whose goal is to maximize revenue 
and suppress the wages of its captive labor 
force, a k a the players. . . .
Sports leagues can’t exist without at least 
some collusion. As Andy Schwarz, an econo-
mist and litigation consultant, puts it, “If 
steel companies got together to decide when 
and where to produce steel, that would violate 
the antitrust laws. But if sports teams in a 
league get together to decide when and where 
to play games, that’s generally allowed.” 
­Major League Baseball has long had an an-
titrust exemption; other professional leagues 
have salary caps, which are legal because 
they have been agreed to by the players.
The N.C.A.A. has neither an antitrust 
­exemption nor a player’s union to negotiate 
with. In other words, it lacks some of the legal 
protections that shield professional sports from 
antitrust suits. What it has, instead, is a work 
force full of young adults dreaming of becoming 
pros and willing to sign any document, no mat-
ter how onerous, if it will help them reach that 
goal. The document the N.C.A.A. forces them to 
sign completely 
stacks the deck 
against them.
Recently, 
Mark Emmert, 
the president 
of the N.C.A.A., 
tried to make 
the rules a tad 
less onerous. He 
got the N.C.A.A. 
board of direc-
tors to approve 
an ­optional 
$2,000 stipend 
as well as a four-year scholarship instead of 
the current one-year deal for players.
And how did the cartel react to these 
modest changes? It rose up in revolt. 
Enough universities signed an override peti-
tion to temporarily ice the new stipend. The 
same thing happened with the four-year 
scholarship.
A lawyer in Fort Worth, Christian Dennie, 
who specializes in sports law, got ahold of an 
internal N.C.A.A. document outlining some of 
the objections. One is especially worth repeat-
ing: “The new coach may have a completely 
different style of offense/defense that the stu-
dent athlete no longer fits into,” wrote Indiana 
State. Four-year scholarships might mean 
that the school would be stuck with “some-
one that is of no ‘athletic’ usefulness to the 
program.” Thus does at least one school show 
how it truly views its “student athletes.” . . .
How can it be that the N.C.A.A. can ­define 
amateurism in one moment as allowing a 
$2,000 stipend and in the next moment as 
forbidding such a stipend? How can it jus-
tify rolling back a change that would truly 
help student athletes, such as the four-year 
scholarship, simply because coaches want 
to continue to have life-or-death power over 
their charges? How can the labor force that 
generates so much money for everyone else be 
kept in shackles by the N.C.A.A.?
The N.C.A.A. claims it has the legal right 
to do all the above and more. And maybe it 
does. But it certainly would be worthwhile to 
see someone challenge its cartel behavior in 
court. The inevitable rollback of the $2,000 
stipend and the four-year scholarship would 
be an awfully good place to start.

Part V	
Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
Policymakers regulate the behavior of oligopolists through the antitrust laws. 
The proper scope of these laws is the subject of ongoing controversy. Although price 
fixing among competing firms clearly reduces economic welfare and should be ille-
gal, some business practices that appear to reduce competition may have ­legitimate 
if subtle purposes. As a result, policymakers need to be careful when they use the 
substantial powers of the antitrust laws to place limits on firm behavior.
•	
Oligopolists maximize their total profits by forming a 
cartel and acting like a monopolist. Yet, if oligopolists 
make decisions about production levels individually, 
the result is a greater quantity and a lower price than 
under the monopoly outcome. The larger the number 
of firms in the oligopoly, the closer the quantity and 
price will be to the levels that would prevail under per-
fect competition.
•	
The prisoners’ dilemma shows that self-interest can 
prevent people from maintaining cooperation, even 
when cooperation is in their mutual interest. The logic 
of the prisoners’ dilemma applies in many situations, 
including arms races, common-resource problems, and 
oligopolies.
•	
Policymakers use the antitrust laws to prevent oli-
gopolies from engaging in behavior that reduces 
competition. The application of these laws can be con-
troversial, because some behavior that can appear to 
reduce competition may in fact have legitimate busi-
ness purposes.

  1.	 A large share of the world supply of diamonds comes 
from Russia and South Africa. Suppose that the mar-
ginal cost of mining diamonds is constant at $1,000 per 
diamond and the demand for diamonds is described 
by the following schedule:
Price
Quantity
$8,000
5,000 diamonds

a.	 If there were many suppliers of diamonds, what 
would be the price and quantity?
b.	 If there were only one supplier of diamonds, what 
would be the price and quantity?
c.	 If Russia and South Africa formed a cartel, what 
would be the price and quantity? If the countries 
split the market evenly, what would be South 
­Africa’s production and profit? What would 
happen to South Africa’s profit if it increased its 
­production by $1,000 while Russia stuck to the 
­cartel agreement?
d.	 	Use your answers to part (c) to explain why cartel 
agreements are often not successful.
  2.	 The New York Times (Nov. 30, 1993) reported that “the 
inability of OPEC to agree last week to cut production 
has sent the oil market into turmoil . . . [leading to] the 
lowest price for domestic crude oil since June 1990.”
a.	 Why were the members of OPEC trying to agree to 
cut production?
b.	 Why do you suppose OPEC was unable to agree on 
cutting production? Why did the oil market go into 
“turmoil” as a result?
c.	 The newspaper also noted OPEC’s view “that 
producing nations outside the organization, like 
Norway and Britain, should do their share and 
cut production.” What does the phrase “do their 
share” suggest about OPEC’s desired relationship 
with Norway and Britain?
  3.	 This chapter discusses companies that are oligopolists 
in the market for the goods they sell. Many of the 
same ideas apply to companies that are oligopolists in 
the market for the inputs they buy.
a.	 If sellers who are oligopolists try to increase the 
price of goods they sell, what is the goal of buyers 
who are oligopolists?
b.	 Major league baseball team owners have an 
­oligopoly in the market for baseball players. What 
is the owners’ goal regarding players’ salaries? 
Why is this goal difficult to achieve?
c.	 Baseball players went on strike in 1994 because 
they would not accept the salary cap that the own-
ers wanted to impose. If the owners were already 
colluding over salaries, why did they feel the need 
for a salary cap?

Nash equilibrium for one person, it might be worse 
for the other.
c.	 even if cooperation is better than the Nash equilib-
rium, each person might have an incentive not to

you will receive one combined grade. You each want 
to receive a good grade, but you also want to avoid 
hard work. In particular, here is the situation:

gives each of you 40 units of happiness.
•	 If only one of you works hard, you both get a B, 
which gives each of you 30 units of happiness.
•	 If neither of you works hard, you both get a D,

conversation between the presidents of American  
Airlines and Braniff Airways. Let’s analyze the game 
between the two companies. Suppose that each  
company can charge either a high price for tickets or  
a low price. If one company charges $300, it earns  
low profit if the other company also charges $300 and 
high profit if the other company charges $600. On the 
other hand, if the company charges $600, it earns very 
low profit if the other company charges $300 and  
medium profit if the other company also charges $600.
a.	 	Draw the decision box for this game.

hen you finish school, your income will be determined largely by what kind 
of job you take. If you become a computer programmer, you will earn more 
than if you become a gas station attendant. This fact is not surprising, but it 
is not obvious why it is true. No law requires that computer programmers be paid 
more than gas station attendants. No ethical principle says that programmers are 
more deserving. What then determines which job will pay you the higher wage?
Your income, of course, is a small piece of a larger economic picture. In 2012, 
the total income of all U.S. residents was about $15 trillion. People earned this 
income in various ways. Workers earned about two-thirds of it in the form 
of wages and fringe benefits. The rest went to landowners and to the owners 
of capital—the economy’s stock of equipment and structures—in the form 
of rent, profit, and interest. What determines how much goes to workers? 
To landowners? To the owners of capital? Why do some workers earn higher 
wages than others, some landowners higher rental income than others, and

PART VI	
THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
some capital owners greater profit than others? Why, in particular, do computer 
programmers earn more than gas station attendants?
The answers to these questions, like most in economics, hinge on supply and 
demand. The supply and demand for labor, land, and capital determine the prices 
paid to workers, landowners, and capital owners. To understand why some peo-
ple have higher incomes than others, therefore, we need to look more deeply at 
the markets for the services they provide. That is our job in this and the next two 
chapters.
This chapter provides the basic theory for the analysis of factor markets. As 
you may recall from Chapter 2, the factors of production are the inputs used to 
produce goods and services. Labor, land, and capital are the three most important 
factors of production. When a computer firm produces a new software program, 
it uses programmers’ time (labor), the physical space on which its offices are lo-
cated (land), and an office building and computer equipment (capital). Similarly, 
when a gas station sells gas, it uses attendants’ time (labor), the physical space 
(land), and the gas tanks and pumps (capital).
In many ways factor markets resemble the markets for goods and services we 
analyzed in previous chapters, but they are different in one important way: The 
demand for a factor of production is a derived demand. That is, a firm’s ­demand for 
a factor of production is derived from its decision to supply a good in ­another mar-
ket. The demand for computer programmers is inseparably linked to the ­supply 
of computer software, and the demand for gas station attendants is ­inseparably 
linked to the supply of gasoline.
In this chapter, we analyze factor demand by considering how a competitive, 
profit-maximizing firm decides how much of any factor to buy. We begin our 
analysis by examining the demand for labor. Labor is the most important factor of 
production, because workers receive most of the total income earned in the U.S. 
economy. Later in the chapter, we will see that our analysis of the labor market 
also applies to the markets for the other factors of production.
The basic theory of factor markets developed in this chapter takes a large step 
toward explaining how the income of the U.S. economy is distributed among 
workers, landowners, and owners of capital. Chapter 19 builds on this analysis 
to examine in more detail why some workers earn more than others. Chapter 20 
examines how much income inequality results from the functioning of factor 
markets and then considers what role the government should and does play in 
­altering the income distribution.

Labor markets, like other markets in the economy, are governed by the forces of 
supply and demand. This is illustrated in Figure 1. In panel (a), the supply and 
demand for apples determine the price of apples. In panel (b), the supply and 
­demand for apple pickers determine the price, or wage, of apple pickers.
As we have already noted, labor markets are different from most other mar-
kets because labor demand is a derived demand. Most labor services, rather than 
­being final goods ready to be enjoyed by consumers, are inputs into the produc-
tion of other goods. To understand labor demand, we need to focus on the firms 
that hire the labor and use it to produce goods for sale. By examining the link 
between the production of goods and the demand for labor to make those goods, 
we gain insight into the determination of equilibrium wages.

CHAPTER 18  THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION

18-1a The Competitive Profit-Maximizing Firm
Let’s look at how a typical firm, such as an apple producer, decides what quantity 
of labor to demand. The firm owns an apple orchard and each week must decide 
how many apple pickers to hire to harvest its crop. After the firm makes its hir-
ing decision, the workers pick as many apples as they can. The firm then sells the 
apples, pays the workers, and keeps what is left as profit.
We make two assumptions about our firm. First, we assume that our firm is 
competitive both in the market for apples (where the firm is a seller) and in the 
market for apple pickers (where the firm is a buyer). A competitive firm is a price 
taker. Because there are many other firms selling apples and hiring apple pickers, 
a single firm has little influence over the price it gets for apples or the wage it pays 
apple pickers. The firm takes the price and the wage as given by market condi-
tions. It only has to decide how many apples to sell and how many workers to hire.
Second, we assume that the firm is profit maximizing. Thus, the firm does not 
directly care about the number of workers it has or the number of apples it pro-
duces. It cares only about profit, which equals the total revenue from the sale of 
apples minus the total cost of producing them. The firm’s supply of apples and its 
demand for workers are derived from its primary goal of maximizing profit.
18-1b The Production Function and the Marginal 
Product of Labor
To make its hiring decision, the firm must consider how the size of its workforce 
affects the amount of output produced. In other words, it must consider how 
the number of apple pickers affects the quantity of apples it can harvest and sell. 
­Table 1 gives a numerical example. In the first column is the number of workers. 
In the second column is the quantity of apples the workers harvest each week.
FIGURE 1
The basic tools of supply and demand apply to goods and to labor services. Panel (a) shows

PART VI	
THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
These two columns of numbers describe the firm’s ability to produce. Recall 
that economists use the term production function to describe the relationship 
between the quantity of inputs used in production and the quantity of output 
from production. Here the “input” is the apple pickers and the “output” is the 
apples. The other inputs—the trees themselves, the land, the firm’s trucks and 
tractors, and so on—are held fixed for now. This firm’s production function shows 
that if the firm hires 1 worker, that worker will pick 100 bushels of apples per 
week. If the firm hires 2 workers, the 2 workers together will pick 180 bushels per 
week. And so on.
Figure 2 graphs the data on labor and output presented in Table 1. The number 
of workers is on the horizontal axis, and the amount of output is on the vertical 
axis. This figure illustrates the production function.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that rational 
people think at the margin. This idea is the key to understanding how firms de-
cide what quantity of labor to hire. To take a step toward this decision, the third 
column in Table 1 gives the marginal product of labor, the increase in the amount 
of output from an additional unit of labor. When the firm increases the number of 
workers from 1 to 2, for example, the amount of apples produced rises from 100 to 
180 bushels. Therefore, the marginal product of the second worker is 80 bushels.
Notice that as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor 
declines. That is, the production process exhibits diminishing marginal product. 
At first, when only a few workers are hired, they can pick the low-hanging fruit. 
As the number of workers increases, additional workers have to climb higher up 
the ladders to find apples to pick. Hence, as more and more workers are hired, 
each additional worker contributes less to the production of apples. For this rea-
son, the production function in Figure 2 becomes flatter as the number of workers 
rises.

18-1c The Value of the Marginal Product 
and the Demand for Labor
Our profit-maximizing firm is concerned not about apples themselves but rather 
about the money it can make by producing and selling them. As a result, when 
deciding how many workers to hire to pick apples, the firm considers how much 
profit each worker would bring in. Because profit is total revenue minus total 
cost, the profit from an additional worker is the worker’s contribution to revenue 
minus the worker’s wage.
To find the worker’s contribution to revenue, we must convert the marginal 
product of labor (which is measured in bushels of apples) into the value of the mar-
ginal product (which is measured in dollars). We do this using the price of apples. 
To continue our example, if a bushel of apples sells for $10 and if an ­additional 
worker produces 80 bushels of apples, then the worker produces $800 of revenue.
The value of the marginal product of any input is the marginal product of 
that input multiplied by the market price of the output. The fourth column in 
Table 1 shows the value of the marginal product of labor in our example, assum-
ing the price of apples is $10 per bushel. Because the market price is constant for 
a competitive firm while the marginal product declines with more workers, the 
value of the marginal product diminishes as the number of workers rises. Econo-
mists sometimes call this column of numbers the firm’s marginal revenue product: 
It is the extra revenue the firm gets from hiring an additional unit of a factor of 
production.
Now consider how many workers the firm will hire. Suppose that the market 
wage for apple pickers is $500 per week. In this case, as you can see in Table 1, 
the first worker that the firm hires is profitable: The first worker yields $1,000 in 
revenue, or $500 in profit. Similarly, the second worker yields $800 in additional 
revenue, or $300 in profit. The third worker produces $600 in additional revenue,

how an input into production

the property of diminishing

THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
or $100 in profit. After the third worker, however, hiring workers is unprofitable. 
The fourth worker would yield only $400 of additional revenue. Because the 
worker’s wage is $500, hiring the fourth worker would mean a $100 reduction in 
profit. Thus, the firm hires only three workers.
It is instructive to consider the firm’s decision graphically. Figure 3 graphs the 
value of the marginal product. This curve slopes downward because the mar-
ginal product of labor diminishes as the number of workers rises. The ­figure 
also ­includes a horizontal line at the market wage. To maximize profit, the firm 
hires workers up to the point where these two curves cross. Below this level 
of ­employment, the value of the marginal product exceeds the wage, so hiring 
­another worker would increase profit. Above this level of employment, the value 
of the marginal product is less than the wage, so the marginal worker is unprofit-
able. Thus, a competitive, profit-maximizing firm hires workers up to the point at which 
the value of the marginal product of labor equals the wage.
Having explained the profit-maximizing hiring strategy for a competitive firm, 
we can now offer a theory of labor demand. Recall that a firm’s labor-demand 
curve tells us the quantity of labor that a firm demands at any given wage. We 
have just seen in Figure 3 that the firm makes that decision by choosing the quan-
tity of labor at which the value of the marginal product equals the wage. As a 
result, the value-of-marginal-product curve is the labor-demand curve for a competitive, 
profit-maximizing firm.
18-1d What Causes the Labor-Demand Curve to Shift?
We now understand that the labor-demand curve reflects the value of the mar-
ginal product of labor. With this insight in mind, let’s consider a few of the things 
that might cause the labor-demand curve to shift.
The Output Price  The value of the marginal product is marginal product times 
the price of the firm’s output. Thus, when the output price changes, the value of 
the marginal product changes, and the labor-demand curve shifts. An increase in 
FIGURE 3
The Value of the Marginal 
­Product of Labor
This figure shows how the value 
of the marginal product (the 
marginal product times the 
price of the output) depends 
on the number of workers. 
The curve slopes downward 
­because of diminishing marginal 
product. For a competitive, 
profit-maximizing firm, this 
value-of-marginal-product curve 
is also the firm’s labor-demand 
curve.

the price of apples, for instance, raises the value of the marginal product of each 
worker who picks apples and, therefore, increases labor demand from the firms 
that supply apples. Conversely, a decrease in the price of apples reduces the value 
of the marginal product and decreases labor demand.
Technological Change  Between 1960 and 2012, the output a typical U.S. 
­worker produced in an hour rose by 192 percent. Why? The most important reason 
is technological progress: Scientists and engineers are constantly figuring out new 
and better ways of doing things. This has profound implications for the ­labor mar-
ket. Technological advance typically raises the marginal product of labor, which 
in turn increases the demand for labor and shifts the labor-demand curve to the 
right.
It is also possible for technological change to reduce labor demand. The inven-
tion of a cheap industrial robot, for instance, could conceivably reduce the mar-
ginal product of labor, shifting the labor-demand curve to the left. Economists 
call this labor-saving technological change. History suggests, however, that most 
technological progress is instead labor-augmenting. Such technological advance 
­explains persistently rising employment in the face of rising wages: Even though 
wages (adjusted for inflation) increased by 152 percent in the last half century, 
firms nonetheless increased the amount of labor they employed by 88 percent.
Input Demand and Output 
Supply: Two Sides of the 
Same Coin
I
n Chapter 14, we saw how a competitive, profit-maximizing firm 
­decides how much of its output to sell: It chooses the quantity of out-
put at which the price of the good equals the marginal cost of produc-
tion. We have just seen how such a firm decides how much labor to hire: 
It chooses the quantity of labor at which the wage equals the value of 
the marginal product. Because the production function links the quan-
tity of inputs to the quantity of output, you should not be surprised to 
learn that the firm’s decision about input demand is closely linked to its 
decision about output supply. In fact, these two decisions are two sides 
of the same coin.
To see this relationship more fully, let’s consider how the marginal 
product of labor (MPL) and marginal cost (MC) are related. Suppose 
an additional worker costs $500 and has a marginal product of 50 
bushels of apples. In this case, producing 50 more bushels costs $500; 
the marginal cost of a bushel is $500/50, or $10. More generally, if W 
is the wage, and an extra unit of labor produces MPL units of output, 
then the marginal cost of a unit of output is MC = W /MPL.
This analysis shows that diminishing marginal product is closely 
related to increasing marginal cost. When our apple orchard grows 
crowded with workers, each additional worker adds less to the produc-
tion of apples (MPL falls). Similarly, when the apple firm is producing 
a large quantity of apples, the orchard is already crowded with ­workers, 
so it is more costly to pro-
duce an additional bushel 
of apples (MC rises).
Now consider our criterion for profit 
­maximization. We determined earlier that a profit-maximizing firm 
chooses the quantity of labor so that the value of the marginal product 
(P × MPL) equals the wage (W ). We can write this mathematically as
P × MPL = W.
If we divide both sides of this equation by MPL, we obtain
P = W /MPL.
We just noted that W/MPL equals marginal cost, MC. Therefore, we 
can substitute to obtain
P = MC.
This equation states that the price of the firm’s output equals the mar-
ginal cost of producing a unit of output. Thus, when a competitive firm 
hires labor up to the point at which the value of the marginal product 
equals the wage, it also produces up to the point at which the price equals 
marginal cost. Our analysis of labor demand in this chapter is just another 
way of looking at the production decision we first saw in Chapter 14.

The Supply of Other Factors  The quantity available of one factor of production 
can affect the marginal product of other factors. A fall in the supply of ladders, for 
instance, will reduce the marginal product of apple pickers and thus the demand 
for apple pickers. We consider this linkage among the factors of production more 
fully later in the chapter.

18-2 The Supply of Labor
Having analyzed labor demand in detail, let’s turn to the other side of the mar-
ket and consider labor supply. A formal model of labor supply is included in 
­Chapter 21, where we develop the theory of household decision making. Here we 
discuss briefly and informally the decisions that lie behind the labor-supply curve.
18-2a The Trade-off between Work and Leisure
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that people face trade-offs. 
Probably no trade-off is more obvious or more important in a person’s life than the 
trade-off between work and leisure. The more hours you spend working, the fewer 
hours you have to watch TV, enjoy dinner with friends, or pursue your favorite 
hobby. The trade-off between labor and leisure lies behind the labor-supply curve.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that the cost of something is what 
you give up to get it. What do you give up to get an hour of leisure? You give up 
an hour of work, which in turn means an hour of wages. Thus, if your wage is $15 
per hour, the opportunity cost of an hour of leisure is $15. And when you get a 
raise to $20 per hour, the opportunity cost of enjoying leisure goes up.
The labor-supply curve reflects how workers’ decisions about the labor-leisure 
trade-off respond to a change in that opportunity cost. An upward-sloping labor-
supply curve means that an increase in the wage induces workers to increase the 
quantity of labor they supply. Because time is limited, more work means less lei-
sure. That is, workers respond to the increase in the opportunity cost of leisure by 
taking less of it.
It is worth noting that the labor-supply curve need not be upward sloping. 
Imagine you got that raise from $15 to $20 per hour. The opportunity cost of 
leisure is now greater, but you are also richer than you were before. You might 
­decide that with your extra wealth you can now afford to enjoy more leisure. That 
is, at the higher wage, you might choose to work fewer hours. If so, your labor-
supply curve would slope backward. In Chapter 21, we discuss this possibility in 
terms of conflicting effects on your labor-supply decision (called the income and 
substitution effects). For now, we ignore the possibility of backward-sloping labor 
supply and assume that the labor-supply curve is upward sloping.
18-2b What Causes the Labor-Supply Curve to Shift?
The labor-supply curve shifts whenever people change the amount they want to 
work at a given wage. Let’s now consider some of the events that might cause 
such a shift.

working five days a 
week, fifty weeks a year

Changes in Tastes  In 1950, 34 percent of women were employed at paid jobs 
or looking for work. In 2012, the number had risen to 58 percent. There are many 
explanations for this development, but one of them is changing tastes, or attitudes 
toward work. Sixty years ago, it was the norm for women to stay at home and 
raise children. Today, the typical family size is smaller, and more mothers choose 
to work. The result is an increase in the supply of labor.
Changes in Alternative Opportunities  The supply of labor in any one labor 
market depends on the opportunities available in other labor markets. If the wage 
earned by pear pickers suddenly rises, some apple pickers may choose to switch 
occupations, causing the supply of labor in the market for apple pickers to fall.
Immigration  Movement of workers from region to region, or country to coun-
try, is another important source of shifts in labor supply. When immigrants come 
to the United States, for instance, the supply of labor in the United States increases, 
and the supply of labor in the immigrants’ home countries falls. In fact, much of 
the policy debate about immigration centers on its effect on labor supply and, 
thereby, equilibrium wages in the labor market.
Quick Quiz  Who has a greater opportunity cost of enjoying leisure—a janitor or a brain 
surgeon? Explain. Can this help explain why doctors work such long hours?
18-3 Equilibrium in the Labor Market
So far we have established two facts about how wages are determined in competi-
tive labor markets:
•	 The wage adjusts to balance the supply and demand for labor.
•	 The wage equals the value of the marginal product of labor.
At first, it might seem surprising that the wage can do both of these things at once. 
In fact, there is no real puzzle here, but understanding why there is no puzzle is 
an important step toward understanding wage determination.
Figure 4 shows the labor market in equilibrium. The wage and the quantity 
of labor have adjusted to balance supply and demand. When the market is in 
this equilibrium, each firm has bought as much labor as it finds profitable at the 
equilibrium wage. That is, each firm has followed the rule for profit maximiza-
tion: It has hired workers until the value of the marginal product equals the wage. 
Hence, the wage must equal the value of the marginal product of labor once it has 
brought supply and demand into equilibrium.
This brings us to an important lesson: Any event that changes the supply or ­demand 
for labor must change the equilibrium wage and the value of the marginal product by the 
same amount because these must always be equal. To see how this works, let’s consider 
some events that shift these curves.
18-3a Shifts in Labor Supply
Suppose that immigration increases the number of workers willing to pick apples. 
As Figure 5 shows, the supply of labor shifts to the right from S1 to S2. At the ini-
tial wage W1, the quantity of labor supplied now exceeds the quantity demanded.

PART VI	
THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
This surplus of labor puts downward pressure on the wage of apple pickers, and 
the fall in the wage from W1 to W2 in turn makes it profitable for firms to hire more 
workers. As the number of workers employed in each apple orchard rises, the 
marginal product of a worker falls, and so does the value of the marginal product. 
In the new equilibrium, both the wage and the value of the marginal product of 
labor are lower than they were before the influx of new workers.
An episode from Israel, studied by MIT economist Joshua Angrist, illustrates 
how a shift in labor supply can alter the equilibrium in a labor market. During 
FIGURE 5
A Shift in Labor Supply
When labor supply increases 
from S1 to S2, perhaps because 
of an immigration of new work-
ers, the equilibrium wage falls 
from W1 to W2. At this lower 
wage, firms hire more labor, so 
employment rises from L1 to L2. 
The change in the wage reflects 
a change in the value of the 
marginal product of labor: With 
more workers, the added output 
from an extra worker is smaller.

most of the 1980s, many thousands of Palestinians regularly commuted from their 
homes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to jobs in Israel, primarily 
in the construction and agriculture industries. In 1988, however, political ­unrest 
in these occupied areas induced the Israeli government to take steps that, as a 
by-product, reduced this supply of workers. Curfews were imposed, work per-
mits were checked more thoroughly, and a ban on overnight stays of Palestinians 
in Israel was enforced more rigorously. The economic impact of these steps was 
exactly as theory predicts: The number of Palestinians with jobs in Israel fell by 
half, while those who continued to work in Israel enjoyed wage increases of about 
50 percent. With a reduced number of Palestinian workers in Israel, the value of 
the marginal product of the remaining workers was much higher.
18-3b Shifts in Labor Demand
Now suppose that an increase in the popularity of apples causes their price to 
rise. This price increase does not change the marginal product of labor for any 
given number of workers, but it does raise the value of the marginal product. With 
a higher price for apples, hiring more apple pickers is now profitable. As Figure 6 
shows, when the demand for labor shifts to the right from D1 to D2, the equilib-
rium wage rises from W1 to W2, and equilibrium employment rises from L1 to 
L2. Once again, the wage and the value of the marginal product of labor move 
together.
This analysis shows that prosperity for firms in an industry is often linked to 
prosperity for workers in that industry. When the price of apples rises, apple pro-
ducers make greater profit, and apple pickers earn higher wages. When the price 
of apples falls, apple producers earn smaller profit, and apple pickers earn lower 
wages. This lesson is well known to workers in industries with highly volatile 
prices. Workers in oil fields, for instance, know from experience that their earn-
ings are closely linked to the world price of crude oil.
FIGURE 6
A Shift in Labor Demand
When labor demand increases 
from D1 to D2, perhaps because 
of an increase in the price of 
the firm’s output, the equilib-
rium wage rises from W1 to W2, 
and employment rises from L1 
to L2. The change in the wage 
reflects a change in the value of 
the marginal product of labor: 
With a higher output price, the 
added output from an extra 
worker is more valuable.

THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
Q: What can you tell us about the size of 
the immigrant population in the United States?
A: Immigrants make up about 13 percent 
of the overall population, which means about 
40 million foreign-born live in the United 
States. The commonly accepted estimate for 
the undocumented portion of the foreign-
born population is 11 million. Immigrants 
come from all parts of the world, but we’ve 
seen big changes in their origins. In the 
1950s and 1960s, 75 percent of immigrants 
were from Europe. Today, about 80 percent 
are from Latin America and Asia. Inflows 
are also much larger today, with 1 million 
to 2 million newcomers entering each year. 
Still, 2010–2011 immigration was below 
the levels experienced prior to the Great 
Recession of 2007–2009, when the housing 
bust led to a significant decline in illegal 
immigration.
What’s interesting about the United 
States is how our economy has been able to 
absorb immigrants and put them to work. 
U.S. immigrants are much more likely to be 
working compared with immigrants in other 
developed countries. This is partly because we 
don’t set high entry-level wages or have cum-
bersome hiring and firing rules. In this type of 
flexible system, there are more job openings. 
Workers have more opportunities. Of course, 
entry-level wages are also lower, but immi-
grants at least get their foot in the door.
Being in the workforce allows immigrants 
to interact with the rest of society. They learn 
the language faster, pay taxes and become 
stakeholders.
Q: Where do immigrants fit into the U.S. 
economy?
A: U.S. immigrants are diverse in eco-
nomic terms. We rely on them to fill both high- 
and low-skilled jobs. Some immigrants do 
medium-skilled work, but more than anything 
else they’re found on the low and the high 
ends of the education distribution.
The economic effects of immigration are 
different depending on which group you’re 
talking about. We have an extremely impor-
tant group of high-skilled immigrants. We 
rely on them to fill high-level jobs in health, 
science, technology, and engineering. Each 
year, over one-third of Ph.D.s in science and 
engineering is awarded to students who were

From these examples, you should now have a good understanding of how 
wages are set in competitive labor markets. Labor supply and labor demand 
­together determine the equilibrium wage, and shifts in the supply or demand 
curve for labor cause the equilibrium wage to change. At the same time, profit 
maximization by the firms that demand labor ensures that the equilibrium wage 
always equals the value of the marginal product of labor.
Productivity and Wages
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that our standard 
of living depends on our ability to produce goods and services. We can 
now see how this principle works in the market for labor. In particular, our 
analysis of labor demand shows that wages equal productivity as measured by 
the value of the marginal product of labor. Put simply, highly productive workers 
are highly paid, and less productive workers are less highly paid.
This lesson is key to understanding why workers today are better off than work-
ers in previous generations. Table 2 presents some data on growth in productivity

born abroad. Moreover, research shows that 
foreign-born workers in STEM fields [science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics] 
are more innovative and entrepreneurial than 
their U.S.-born counterparts.
High-skilled immigration has many 
economic benefits—it boosts productivity 
growth and contributes positively to gov-
ernment finances. People tend to focus on 
­undocumented or low-skilled immigrants 
when discussing immigration and often do 
not recognize the tremendous contributions of 
high-skilled immigrants.
Q: What about the low-skilled 
immigration?
A: With low-skilled immigration, the eco-
nomic benefits of the added labor, such as 
lower prices for consumers, have to be bal-
anced against the fiscal impact, which is 
likely negative. The fiscal impact is the dif-
ference between what families contribute in 
taxes and what they use up in the form of 
publicly provided services.
What makes the fiscal issue more difficult 
is the distribution of the burden. The federal 
government reaps much of the revenue from 
immigrants who work and pay employment 
taxes. State and local governments realize 
less of that benefit and have to pay more of 
the costs associated with low-skilled immi-
gration—usually health care and educational 
expenses.
Q: Does it matter whether the immigration 
is legal or not?
A: Illegal immigration has helped fuel the 
U.S. economy for many years. Five percent of 
the U.S. workforce is made up of unauthorized 
workers; the outcome of decades of robust 
labor demand and, until recently, lax enforce-
ment. Nevertheless, from an economic per-
spective, it makes more sense to differentiate 
among immigrants of various skill levels than 
it does to focus on legal status.
The economic benefits of low-skilled im-
migrants aren’t typically going to depend on 
how they entered the United States. Illegal 
immigrants may pay less in taxes, but they’re 
also ineligible for public programs. So being 
illegal doesn’t mean these immigrants have 
a worse fiscal impact. In fact, a low-skilled 
illegal immigrant likely creates less fiscal 
burden than a low-skilled legal immigrant 
because the undocumented get almost no 
government benefits.
Q: How does immigration affect jobs and 
earnings for the native-born population?
A: Labor economists have looked long 
and hard at this question, namely how 
immigration has affected the wages of Ameri-
cans, particularly the low-skilled who lack 
a high school degree. The reason we worry 
about this is that the real wages of less-­
educated U.S. men have been falling since 
the late 1970s.
The studies tend to show that little of 
the decline is due to immigration. The con-
sensus seems to be that wages overall are 
about 1 to 3 percent lower today as a result 
of immigration, although some scholars 
find larger effects for low-skilled workers. 
Still, labor economists think it’s a bit of a 
puzzle that they haven’t been able to sys-
tematically identify larger adverse wage 
effects.
The reason may be the way the economy 
is constantly adjusting to the inflow of immi-
grants. On a geographical basis, for example, 
a large influx of immigrants into an area 
tends to encourage an inflow of capital or a 
change in technology or production processes 
which puts new workers to use. So you have 
an increase in labor supply, but you also have 
an increase in labor demand, and the wage 
effects are ameliorated.

Growth in real wages is measured as the annualized change in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector divided by the implicit price deflator for 
that sector. These productivity data measure average productivity—the quantity of output divided by the quantity of labor—rather than marginal productivity, 
but average and marginal productivity are thought to move closely together.

and growth in real wages (that is, wages adjusted for inflation). From 1959 to 2012, 
productivity as measured by output per hour of work grew about 2.1 percent per 
year. Real wages grew at 1.8 percent—almost the same rate. With a growth rate of 
2 percent per year, productivity and real wages double about every 35 years.
Productivity growth varies over time. Table 2 also shows the data for three 
shorter periods that economists have identified as having very different pro-
ductivity experiences. Around 1973, the U.S. economy experienced a significant 
slowdown in productivity growth that lasted until 1995. The cause of the produc-
tivity slowdown is not well understood, but the link between productivity and 
real wages is exactly as standard theory predicts. The slowdown in productivity 
growth from 2.8 to 1.4 percent per year coincided with a slowdown in real wage 
growth from 2.8 to 1.1 percent per year.
Productivity growth picked up again around 1995, and many observers hailed 
the arrival of the “new economy.” This productivity acceleration is most often 
­attributed to the spread of computers and information technology. As theory pre-
dicts, growth in real wages picked up as well. From 1995 to 2012, productivity 
grew by 2.3 percent per year, and real wages grew by 1.9 percent per year.
The bottom line: Both theory and history confirm the close connection between 
productivity and real wages. 
Quick Quiz  How does an immigration of workers affect labor supply, labor demand, 
the marginal product of labor, and the equilibrium wage?
Monopsony
O
n the preceding pages, we built our analysis of the labor market 
with the tools of supply and demand. In doing so, we assumed that 
the labor market was competitive. That is, we assumed that there were 
many buyers and sellers of labor, so each buyer or seller had a negli-
gible effect on the wage.
Yet imagine the labor market in a small town dominated by a single, 
large employer. That employer can exert a large influence on the going 
wage, and it may well use that market power to alter the outcome. Such 
a market in which there is a single buyer is called a monopsony.
A monopsony (a market with one buyer) is in many ways similar 
to a monopoly (a market with one seller). Recall from Chapter 15 that 
a monopoly firm produces less of the good than would a competitive 
firm; by reducing the quantity offered for sale, the monopoly firm moves 
along the product’s demand curve, raising the price and also its profits. 
Similarly, a monopsony 
firm in a labor market 
hires fewer workers than 
would a competitive firm; by reducing 
the number of jobs available, the monopsony 
firm moves along the labor supply curve, reducing the wage it pays and 
raising its profits. Thus, both monopolists and monopsonists reduce 
economic activity in a market below the socially optimal level. In both 
cases, the existence of market power distorts the outcome and causes 
deadweight losses.
This book does not present the formal model of monopsony because 
monopsonies are rare. In most labor markets, workers have many pos-
sible employers, and firms compete with one another to attract workers. 
In this case, the model of supply and demand is the best one to use.

18-4 The Other Factors of Production: Land and Capital
We have seen how firms decide how much labor to hire and how these deci-
sions determine workers’ wages. At the same time that firms are hiring work-
ers, they are also deciding about other inputs to production. For example, our

apple-producing firm might have to choose the size of its apple orchard and the 
number of ladders for its apple pickers. We can think of the firm’s factors of pro-
duction as falling into three categories: labor, land, and capital.
The meaning of the terms labor and land is clear, but the definition of capital is 
somewhat tricky. Economists use the term capital to refer to the stock of equip-
ment and structures used for production. That is, the economy’s capital represents 
the accumulation of goods produced in the past that are ­being used in the present 
to produce new goods and services. For our apple firm, the capital stock includes 
the ladders used to climb the trees, the trucks used to transport the apples, the 
buildings used to store the apples, and even the trees themselves.
18-4a Equilibrium in the Markets for Land and Capital
What determines how much the owners of land and capital earn for their contri-
bution to the production process? Before answering this question, we need to dis-
tinguish between two prices: the purchase price and the rental price. The purchase 
price of land or capital is the price a person pays to own that factor of production 
indefinitely. The rental price is the price a person pays to use that factor for a lim-
ited period of time. It is important to keep this distinction in mind because, as we 
will see, these prices are determined by somewhat different economic forces.
Having defined these terms, we can now apply the theory of factor demand that 
we developed for the labor market to the markets for land and capital. ­Because 
the wage is the rental price of labor, much of what we have learned about wage 
determination applies also to the rental prices of land and capital. As ­Figure 7 
­illustrates, the rental price of land, shown in panel (a), and the rental price of capi-
tal, shown in panel (b), are determined by supply and demand. Moreover, the 
demand for land and capital is determined just like the demand for labor. That 
FIGURE 7
Supply and demand determine the compensation paid to the owners of land, as shown in 
panel (a), and the compensation paid to the owners of capital, as shown in panel (b). The 
­demand for each factor, in turn, depends on the value of the marginal product of that factor.

PART VI	
THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
is, when our apple-producing firm is deciding how much land and how many 
ladders to rent, it follows the same logic as when deciding how many workers 
to hire. For both land and capital, the firm increases the quantity hired until the 
value of the factor’s marginal product equals the factor’s price. Thus, the demand 
curve for each factor reflects the marginal productivity of that factor.
We can now explain how much income goes to labor, how much goes to land-
owners, and how much goes to the owners of capital. As long as the firms ­using the 
factors of production are competitive and profit-maximizing, each factor’s rental 
price must equal the value of the marginal product for that factor. Labor, land, and 
capital each earn the value of their marginal contribution to the production process.
Now consider the purchase price of land and capital. The rental price and the 
purchase price are related: Buyers are willing to pay more for a piece of land or 
capital if it produces a valuable stream of rental income. And as we have just seen, 
the equilibrium rental income at any point in time equals the value of that factor’s 
marginal product. Therefore, the equilibrium purchase price of a piece of land or 
capital depends on both the current value of the marginal product and the value 
of the marginal product expected to prevail in the future.
18-4b Linkages among the Factors of Production
We have seen that the price paid for any factor of production—labor, land, or 
­capital—equals the value of the marginal product of that factor. The marginal 
product of any factor, in turn, depends on the quantity of that factor that is avail-
able. Because of diminishing marginal product, a factor in abundant supply has 
a low marginal product and thus a low price, and a factor in scarce supply has a 
What Is Capital Income?
L
abor income is an easy concept to understand: It is the paycheck that 
workers get from their employers. The income earned by capital, how-
ever, is less obvious.
In our analysis, we have been implicitly assuming that households 
own the economy’s stock of capital—ladders, drill presses, warehouses, 
and so on—and rent it to the firms that use it. Capital income, in this 
case, is the rent that households receive for the use of their ­capital. 
This assumption simplified our analysis of how capital owners are 
compensated, but it is not entirely realistic. In fact, firms usually own 
the capital they use, and therefore, they receive the earnings from this 
capital.
These earnings from capital, however, are paid to households even-
tually in a variety of forms. Some of the earnings are paid in the form of 
interest to those households that have lent money to firms. Bondholders 
and bank depositors are two examples of recipients of interest. Thus, 
when you receive interest on your bank account, that income is part of 
the economy’s capital income.
In addition, some of the earnings from capital are paid to house-
holds in the form of dividends. Dividends are payments by a firm to 
the firm’s stockholders. 
A stockholder is a person 
who has bought a share in 
the ownership of the firm and, there-
fore, is entitled to share in the firm’s profits.
A firm does not have to pay out all its earnings to households in 
the form of interest and dividends. Instead, it can retain some earnings 
within the firm and use these earnings to buy additional capital. Unlike 
dividends, these retained earnings do not yield a direct cash payment 
to the firm’s stockholders, but the stockholders benefit from them none-
theless. Because retained earnings increase the amount of capital the 
firm owns, they tend to increase future earnings and, thereby, the value 
of the firm’s stock.
These institutional details are interesting and important, but they 
do not alter our conclusion about the income earned by the owners of 
capital. Capital is paid according to the value of its marginal prod-
uct, regardless of whether this income is transmitted to households in 
the form of interest or dividends or whether it is kept within firms as 
­retained earnings.

high marginal product and a high price. As a result, when the supply of a factor 
falls, its equilibrium price rises.
When the supply of any factor changes, however, the effects are not limited 
to the market for that factor. In most situations, factors of production are used 
together in a way that makes the productivity of each factor depend on the quan-
tities of the other factors available for use in the production process. As a result, 
when some event changes the supply of any one factor of production, it will typi-
cally affect not only the earnings of that factor but also the earnings of all the fac-
tors as well.
For example, suppose a hurricane destroys many of the ladders that workers 
use to pick apples from the orchards. What happens to the earnings of the vari-
ous factors of production? Most obviously, when the supply of ladders falls, the 
equilibrium rental price of ladders rises. Those owners who were lucky enough to 
avoid damage to their ladders now earn a higher return when they rent out their 
ladders to the firms that produce apples.
Yet the effects of this event do not stop at the ladder market. Because there are 
fewer ladders with which to work, the workers who pick apples have a smaller 
marginal product. Thus, the reduction in the supply of ladders reduces the 
­demand for the labor of apple pickers, and this shift in demand causes the equi-
librium wage to fall.
This story shows a general lesson: An event that changes the supply of any factor of 
production can alter the earnings of all the factors. The change in earnings of any fac-
tor can be found by analyzing the impact of the event on the value of the marginal 
product of that factor.
The Economics of the Black Death
In 14th-century Europe, the bubonic plague wiped out about one-third 
of the population within a few years. This event, called the Black Death, 
provides a grisly natural experiment to test the theory of factor markets that 
we have just developed. Consider the effects of the Black Death on those who 
were lucky enough to survive. What do you think happened to the wages earned 
by workers and the rents earned by landowners?
To answer this question, let’s examine the effects of a reduced population on 
the marginal product of labor and the marginal product of land. With a smaller 
supply of workers, the marginal product of labor rises. (This is diminishing mar-
ginal product working in reverse.) Thus, we would expect the Black Death to raise 
wages.
Because land and labor are used together in production, a smaller supply of 
workers also affects the market for land, the other major factor of production in 
medieval Europe. With fewer workers available to farm the land, an additional 
unit of land produced less additional output. In other words, the marginal prod-
uct of land fell. Thus, we would expect the Black Death to lower rents.
In fact, both predictions are consistent with the historical evidence. Wages 
­approximately doubled during this period, and rents declined 50 percent or more. 
The Black Death led to economic prosperity for the peasant classes and reduced 
incomes for the landed classes.

THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
18-5 Conclusion
This chapter explained how labor, land, and capital are compensated for the 
roles they play in the production process. The theory developed here is called the 
­neoclassical theory of distribution. According to the neoclassical theory, the amount 
paid to each factor of production depends on the supply and demand for that 
factor. The demand, in turn, depends on that particular factor’s marginal produc-
tivity. In equilibrium, each factor of production earns the value of its marginal 
contribution to the production of goods and services.
The neoclassical theory of distribution is widely accepted. Most economists 
­begin with the neoclassical theory when trying to explain how the U.S. economy’s 
$15 trillion of income is distributed among the economy’s various members. In the 
following two chapters, we consider the distribution of income in more detail. As 
you will see, the neoclassical theory provides the framework for this discussion.
Even at this point, you can use the theory to answer the question that began 
this chapter: Why are computer programmers paid more than gas station atten-
dants? It is because programmers can produce a good of greater market value 
than can gas station attendants. People are willing to pay dearly for a good com-
puter game, but they are willing to pay little to have their gas pumped and their 
windshield washed. The wages of these workers reflect the market prices of the 
goods they produce. If people suddenly got tired of using computers and ­decided 
to spend more time driving, the prices of these goods would change, and so 
would the equilibrium wages of these two groups of workers.
•	
The economy’s income is distributed in the markets 
for the factors of production. The three most important 
factors of production are labor, land, and capital.
•	
The demand for factors, such as labor, is a derived 
demand that comes from firms that use the factors 
to produce goods and services. Competitive, profit-­
maximizing firms hire each factor up to the point 
at which the value of the factor’s marginal product 
equals its price.
•	
The supply of labor arises from individuals’ trade-off 
between work and leisure. An upward-sloping labor-
supply curve means that people respond to an increase 
in the wage by working more hours and enjoying less 
leisure.
•	
The price paid to each factor adjusts to balance the sup-
ply and demand for that factor. Because factor demand 
reflects the value of the marginal product of that factor, 
in equilibrium each factor is compensated according to 
its marginal contribution to the production of goods 
and services.
•	
Because factors of production are used together, the 
marginal product of any one factor depends on the 
quantities of all factors that are available. As a result, 
a change in the supply of one factor alters the equilib-
rium earnings of all the factors.

Earnings and 
Discrimination
I
n the United States today, the typical physician earns about $200,000 a year, the 
typical police officer about $60,000, and the typical fast-food cook about $20,000. 
These examples illustrate the large differences in earnings that are so common 
in our economy. The differences explain why some people live in mansions, ride 
in limousines, and vacation on the French Riviera, while other people live in small 
apartments, ride the bus, and vacation in their own backyards.
Why do earnings vary so much from person to person? Chapter 18, which 
developed the basic neoclassical theory of the labor market, offers an answer to 
this question. There we saw that wages are governed by labor supply and 
labor demand. Labor demand, in turn, reflects the marginal productivity of 
labor. In equilibrium, each worker is paid the value of her marginal contri-
bution to the economy’s production of goods and services.
This theory of the labor market, though widely accepted by economists, is 
only the beginning of the story. To understand the wide variation in earnings

The Economics of Labor Markets
that we observe, we must go beyond this general framework and examine more 
precisely what determines the supply and demand for different types of labor. 
That is our goal in this chapter.
19-1 Some Determinants of Equilibrium Wages
Workers differ from one another in many ways. Jobs also have differing charac-
teristics—both in terms of the wages they pay and in terms of their nonmonetary 
attributes. In this section, we consider how the characteristics of jobs and workers 
affect labor supply, labor demand, and equilibrium wages.
19-1a Compensating Differentials
When a worker is deciding whether to take a job, the wage is only one of many 
job attributes that the worker takes into account. Some jobs are easy, fun, and safe, 
while others are hard, dull, and dangerous. The better the job as gauged by these 
nonmonetary characteristics, the more people there are who are willing to do the 
job at any given wage. In other words, the supply of labor for easy, fun, and safe 
jobs is greater than the supply of labor for hard, dull, and dangerous jobs. As a 
result, “good” jobs will tend to have lower equilibrium wages than “bad” jobs.
For example, imagine you are looking for a summer job in a local beach com-
munity. Two kinds of jobs are available. You can take a job as a beach-badge 
checker, or you can take a job as a garbage collector. The beach-badge checkers 
take leisurely strolls along the beach during the day and check to make sure the 
tourists have bought the required beach permits. The garbage collectors wake up 
before dawn to drive dirty, noisy trucks around town to pick up garbage. Which 
job would you want? Most people would prefer the beach job if the wages were 
the same. To induce people to become garbage collectors, the town has to offer 
higher wages to garbage collectors than to beach-badge checkers.
Economists use the term compensating differential to refer to a difference in 
wages that arises from nonmonetary characteristics of different jobs. Compensat-
ing differentials are prevalent in the economy. Here are some examples:
•	 Coal miners are paid more than other workers with similar levels of ­education. 
Their higher wage compensates them for the dirty and ­dangerous nature 
of coal mining, as well as the long-term health problems that coal ­miners 
experience.
•	 Workers who work the night shift at factories are paid more than similar 
workers who work the day shift. The higher wage compensates them for 
­having to work at night and sleep during the day, a lifestyle that most people 
find undesirable.
•	 Professors are paid less than lawyers and doctors, who have similar amounts 
of education. The higher wages of lawyers and doctors compensate them for 
missing out on the great intellectual and personal satisfaction that professors’ 
jobs offer. (Indeed, teaching ­economics is so much fun that it is surprising that 
economics professors are paid ­anything at all!)
19-1b Human Capital
As we discussed in the previous chapter, the word capital usually refers to an econ-
omy’s stock of equipment and structures. The capital stock includes the farmer’s 
compensating differential
a difference in wages 
that arises to offset 
the nonmonetary 
characteristics of 
different jobs

I could make more money 
if I left public service for 
the private sector, but, on 
the other hand, I couldn’t 
chop off heads.”

tractor, the manufacturer’s factory, and the teacher’s chalkboard. The essence of 
capital is that it is a factor of production that itself has been produced.
There is another type of capital that, while less tangible than physical capital, 
is just as important to the economy’s production. Human capital is the accumula-
tion of investments in people. The most important type of human capital is educa-
tion. Like all forms of capital, education represents an expenditure of resources 
at one time to raise productivity in the future. But unlike an investment in other 
forms of capital, an investment in education is tied to a specific person, and this 
linkage is what makes it human capital.
Not surprisingly, workers with more human capital earn more on average 
than those with less human capital. College graduates in the United States, for 
example, earn almost twice as much as those workers who end their education 
with a high school diploma. This large difference has been documented in many 
countries around the world. It tends to be even larger in less developed countries, 
where educated workers are in scarce supply.
From the perspective of supply and demand it is easy to see why educa-
tion raises wages. Firms—the demanders of labor—are willing to pay more for 
highly educated workers because these workers have higher marginal products. 
­Workers—the suppliers of labor—are willing to pay the cost of becoming edu-
cated only if there is a reward for doing so. In essence, the difference in wages 
between highly educated workers and less educated workers may be considered 
a compensating differential for the cost of becoming educated.

investments in people, 
such as education and 
on-the-job training
The Increasing Value of Skills
“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.” Like many adages, this 
one is not always true, but it has been in recent years. Many studies have 
documented that the earnings gap between workers with high skills and 
workers with low skills has increased over the past several decades.
Table 1 presents data on the average earnings of college graduates and of high 
school graduates without any additional education. These data show the increase 
in the financial reward from education. In 1975, a man on average earned 42 per-
cent more with a college degree than without one; by 2011, this figure had risen to 
75 percent. For a woman, the reward for attending college rose from a 35 percent 
increase in earnings in 1975 to an 81 percent increase in 2011. The incentive to stay 
in school is as great today as it has ever been.
Why has the gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers wid-
ened in recent years? No one knows for sure, but economists have proposed two 
­hypotheses to explain this trend. Both hypotheses suggest that the demand for 
skilled labor has risen over time relative to the demand for unskilled labor. The 
shift in demand has led to a corresponding change in the wages of both groups, 
which in turn has led to greater inequality.
The first hypothesis is that international trade has altered the relative demand 
for skilled and unskilled labor. In recent years, the amount of trade with other 
countries has increased substantially. As a percentage of total U.S. production of 
goods and services, imports have risen from 5 percent in 1970 to 18 percent in 
2011, and exports have risen from 6 percent in 1970 to 14 percent in 2011. Because 
unskilled labor is plentiful and cheap in many foreign countries, the United States 
tends to import goods produced with unskilled labor and export goods produced 
with skilled labor. Thus, when international trade expands, the domestic demand 
for skilled labor rises and the domestic demand for unskilled labor falls.

Regardless of the Cost, 
College Still Matters
By Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney
A
s America continues its recovery from 
the Great Recession, there is an ongoing 
­debate in the media and among policymakers 
about the value of a college degree in today’s 
economic climate. One issue that is receiving 
a significant amount of attention is the rising 
cost of college. Indeed, tuition has increased 
by almost 50 percent in the last 30 years, 
prompting some people to ask whether col-
lege is still worth the price of admission.
In this month’s analysis, The Hamilton 
Project confirms its previous findings that the 
returns to college attendance are much higher 
than other investments, such as stocks, bonds, 
and real estate. We also find that the returns 
to college have been largely constant over the 
last 35 years, indicating that the rising tuition 
costs have been offset by the increased earn-
ings premium for college graduates. . . .
In most respects, a college degree has 
never been more valuable. Recent college 
graduates earn more money and have an 
easier time finding employment than their 
peers who only have a high school diploma. 
What may be less intuitive is that these gaps 
have been growing in recent years. A young 
college graduate earned about $4,000 more 
per year in the 1980s, adjusting for inflation, 
than someone of the same age who did not 
attend college (averaged across the entire 
population, not just those in the workforce). 
Over the last three decades, that figure has 
climbed to $12,000 per year.
Differences in employment rates between 
college graduates and non-graduates have 
not demonstrated as clear of a trend over 
this period, with one key exception. In recent 
years—particularly in the aftermath of the 
Great Recession—college has become an 
increasingly important determinant of one’s 
employment status. Today, a college graduate 
is almost 20 percentage points more likely to 
be employed than someone with only a high 
school diploma. This “employment gap” 
­between college and high school graduates is 
the largest in our nation’s history. . . .
While the evidence is clear about the life-
long value of more education, skeptics are 
increasingly pointing to rising tuition costs to 
claim that college is not as sound of an invest-
ment as it once was. And it is true that tuition 
has increased significantly over the past few 
decades. In 1980, it cost an average of about 
Higher Education as  
an Investment
Is a college degree a good investment compared with, say, stocks and 
bonds? According to the Hamilton Project, a research effort run by a 
prominent Washington think tank, the answer is a resounding “yes.”

CHAPTER 19  EARNINGS AND DISCRIMINATION

$56,000 (adjusting for inflation) to attend a 
university for four years. This figure includes 
tuition, fees, and the “opportunity cost,” or 
­income one foregoes to attend school instead 
of holding a job. (This figure excludes room 
and board: one must eat and sleep whether 
she is in college or not.) In 2010, four years 
of college cost more than $82,000, a nearly 
50 percent increase over that 30-year period.
This increase in tuition is based on calcu-
lations from the National Center for Education 
Statistics but it may overstate the rise in the 
costs of college. First, this rise in tuition does 
not account for recent increases in financial 
aid. Thus, while the sticker price of college 
may have gone up, it is unclear to what extent 
the cost to students and their families has 
increased. Indeed, according to the College 
Board, the actual cost of a four-year degree 
has remained relatively constant over the last 
15 years.
Regardless of the magnitude of the exact 
increase in tuition, a sole focus on the cost of 
college is misleading because it only tells half 
of the story. Specifically, the monetary benefits 
of a college degree have increased dramati-
cally over the last few decades. An individual 
who entered college in 1980 could expect to 
earn about $260,000 more over the course 
of her life compared to someone who received 
only a high school diploma. In contrast, for 
someone starting college in 2010, the expected 
lifetime increase in earnings relative to a high 
school graduate was more than $450,000. 
These estimates are adjusted both for inflation 
and the fact that most of this additional in-
come will come much later in a graduate’s life.
Even if we assume that all students ac-
tually pay tuition at the published rates, 
the bottom line is this: while college may be 
50 percent more expensive now than it was 30 
years ago, the increase to lifetime earnings 
that a college degree brings is 75 percent 
higher. In short, the cost of college is grow-
ing, but the benefits of college—and, by ex-
tension, the cost of not going to college—are 
growing even faster.
The returns to an investment in a college 
education, therefore, are high. The Hamilton 
Project estimated that investing in a four-year 
degree yields a return of above 15 ­percent. 
While this is down slightly from almost 
18 ­percent in the late ’90s, attending college 
­remains one of the best ways one can invest 
her money. The return to college is more than 
double the average return over the last 60 years 
experienced in the stock market (6.8 percent), 
and more than five times the return to invest-
ments in corporate bonds (2.9 percent), gold 
(2.3 percent), long-term government bonds 
(2.2 percent), or housing (0.4 percent).
The cost of college can be daunting for 
many families, but it is precisely because 
college is such a sound investment that 
there is an important role for government to 
ensure that loan programs are plentiful and 
accessible. The nation and the economy are 
strengthened when college attendance is 
­determined by students’ abilities, not their 
families’ financial background. Indeed, it is 
not just the direct recipients of these loans 
that benefit from the increased number of 
Americans who are able to go to college. One 
recent study showed that even individuals 
with only a high school diploma earn more 
when they live in cities populated with more 
college graduates. More education is not just 
good for individuals; it’s a good investment 
for the broader community. 
Source: The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, 
October 5, 2012.
The second hypothesis is that changes in technology have altered the relative 
demand for skilled and unskilled labor. Consider, for instance, the introduction 
of computers. Computers raise the demand for skilled workers who can use the 
new machines and reduce the demand for the unskilled workers whose jobs are 
replaced by the computers. For example, many companies now rely more on com-
puter databases, and less on filing cabinets, to keep business records. This change 
raises the demand for computer programmers and reduces the demand for filing 
clerks. Thus, as more firms use computers, the demand for skilled labor rises and 
the demand for unskilled labor falls.
Economists have found it difficult to gauge the validity of these two hypothe-
ses. It is possible that both are true: Increasing international trade and technologi-
cal change may share responsibility for the increasing income inequality we have 
observed in recent decades. In the next chapter, we discuss the issue of increasing 
inequality in more detail. 
19-1c Ability, Effort, and Chance
Why do major league baseball players get paid more than minor league play-
ers? Certainly, the higher wage is not a compensating differential. Playing in the 
major leagues is not a less pleasant job than playing in the minor leagues; in fact, 
the opposite is true. The major leagues do not require more years of schooling or

The Economics of Labor Markets
more experience. To a large extent, players in the major leagues earn more just 
because they have greater natural ability.
Natural ability is important for workers in all occupations. Because of heredity 
and upbringing, people differ in their physical and mental attributes. Some peo-
ple are strong, others weak. Some people are smart, others less so. Some people 
are outgoing, others awkward in social situations. These and many other personal 
characteristics determine how productive workers are and, therefore, play a role 
in determining the wages they earn.
Closely related to ability is effort. Some people work hard; others are lazy. We 
should not be surprised to find that those who work hard are more productive 
and earn higher wages. To some extent, firms reward workers directly by pay-
ing people based on what they produce. Salespeople, for instance, are often paid 
a percentage of the sales they make. At other times, hard work is rewarded less 
directly in the form of a higher annual salary or a bonus.
Chance also plays a role in determining wages. If a person attended a trade 
school to learn how to repair televisions with vacuum tubes and then found this 
skill made obsolete by the invention of solid-state electronics, she would end up 
earning a low wage compared to others with similar years of training. The low 
wage of this worker is due to chance—a phenomenon that economists recognize 
but do not shed much light on.
How important are ability, effort, and chance in determining wages? It is hard 
to say because these factors are difficult to measure. But indirect evidence sug-
gests that they are very important. When labor economists study wages, they 
relate a worker’s wage to those variables that can be measured, such as years of 
schooling, years of experience, age, and job characteristics. All these measured 
variables affect a worker’s wage as theory predicts, but they account for less than 
half of the variation in wages in our economy. Because so much of the variation in 
wages is left unexplained, omitted variables, including ability, effort, and chance, 
must play an important role.
The Benefits of Beauty
People differ in many ways, one of which is physical attractiveness. 
The actor Ryan Gosling, for instance, is a handsome man. In part for this 
reason, his movies attract large audiences. Not surprisingly, the large audi-
ences mean a large income for Mr. Gosling.
How prevalent are the economic benefits of beauty? Labor economists Daniel 
Hamermesh and Jeff Biddle tried to answer this question in a study published in 
the December 1994 issue of the American Economic Review. Hamermesh and ­Biddle 
examined data from surveys of individuals in the United States and Canada. The 
interviewers who conducted the survey were asked to rate each respondent’s 
physical appearance. Hamermesh and Biddle then examined how much the 
wages of the respondents depended on the standard determinants—education, 
experience, and so on—and how much they depended on physical appearance.
Hamermesh and Biddle found that beauty pays. People who are deemed more 
attractive than average earn 5 percent more than people of average looks, and 
people of average looks earn 5 to 10 percent more than people considered less 
­attractive than average. Similar results were found for men and women.
What explains these differences in wages? There are several ways to interpret 
the “beauty premium.”

19-1d An Alternative View of Education: Signaling
Earlier we discussed the human-capital view of education, according to which 
schooling raises workers’ wages because it makes them more productive. 
Although this view is widely accepted, some economists have proposed an alter-
native theory, which emphasizes that firms use educational attainment as a way 
of sorting between high-ability and low-ability workers. According to this alter-
native view, when people earn a college degree, for instance, they do not become 
more productive, but they do signal their high ability to prospective employers. 
Because it is easier for high-ability people to earn a college degree than it is for 
low-ability people, more high-ability people get college degrees. As a result, it is 
rational for firms to interpret a college degree as a signal of ability.
The signaling theory of education is similar to the signaling theory of 
­advertising discussed in Chapter 16. In the signaling theory of advertising, the 
advertisement itself contains no real information, but the firm signals the qual-
ity of its product to consumers by its willingness to spend money on advertising. 
In the signaling theory of education, schooling has no real productivity benefit, 
but the worker signals her innate productivity to employers by her willingness to 
spend years at school. In both cases, an action is being taken not for its intrinsic 
benefit but because the willingness to take that action conveys private informa-
tion to someone observing it.
Thus, we now have two views of education: the human-capital theory and 
the signaling theory. Both views can explain why more educated workers tend 
to earn more than less educated workers. According to the human-capital view, 
education makes workers more productive; according to the signaling view, edu-
cation is correlated with natural ability. But the two views have radically different 
predictions for the effects of policies that aim to increase educational attainment. 
According to the human-capital view, increasing educational levels for all workers 
would raise all workers’ productivity and thereby their wages. According to the 
signaling view, education does not enhance productivity, so raising all ­workers’ 
educational levels would not affect wages.
Most likely, the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. The benefits 
to education are probably a combination of the productivity-enhancing effects of 
human capital and the productivity-revealing effects of signaling. The relative 
size of these two effects is an open question.
One interpretation is that good looks are themselves a type of innate ability 
determining productivity and wages. Some people are born with the physical 
­attributes of a movie star; other people are not. Good looks are useful in any job in 
which workers present themselves to the public—such as acting, sales, and wait-
ing on tables. In this case, an attractive worker is more valuable to the firm than 
an unattractive worker. The firm’s willingness to pay more to attractive workers 
reflects its customers’ preferences.
A second interpretation is that reported beauty is an indirect measure of other 
types of ability. How attractive a person appears depends on more than just 
­heredity. It also depends on dress, hairstyle, personal demeanor, and other attri-
butes that a person can control. Perhaps a person who successfully projects an 
­attractive image in a survey interview is more likely to be an intelligent person 
who succeeds at other tasks as well.
A third interpretation is that the beauty premium is a type of discrimination, a 
topic to which we return later. 
Good looks pay.

The Economics of Labor Markets
19-1e The Superstar Phenomenon
Although most actors earn little and often take jobs as waiters to support them-
selves, Leonardo DiCaprio earns millions of dollars for each film he makes. 
­Similarly, while most people who play tennis do it for free as a hobby, Maria 
Sharapova earns millions on the pro tour. DiCaprio and Sharapova are superstars 
in their fields, and their great public appeal is reflected in astronomical incomes.
Why do DiCaprio and Sharapova earn so much? It is not surprising that 
incomes differ within occupations. Good carpenters earn more than mediocre car-
penters, and good plumbers earn more than mediocre plumbers. People vary in 
ability and effort, and these differences lead to differences in income. Yet the best 
carpenters and plumbers do not earn the many millions that are common among 
the best actors and athletes. What explains the difference?
To understand the tremendous incomes of DiCaprio and Sharapova, we must 
examine the special features of the markets in which they sell their services. 
Superstars arise in markets that have two characteristics:
•	 Every customer in the market wants to enjoy the good supplied by the best 
producer.
•	 The good is produced with a technology that makes it possible for the best 
producer to supply every customer at low cost.
If Leonardo DiCaprio is the best actor around, then everyone will want to see 
his next movie; seeing twice as many movies by an actor half as talented is not a 
good substitute. Moreover, it is possible for everyone to enjoy a performance by 
­Leonardo DiCaprio. Because it is easy to make multiple copies of a film, DiCaprio 
can provide his service to millions of people simultaneously. Similarly, because 
tennis matches are broadcast on television, millions of fans can enjoy the extraor-
dinary athletic skills of Maria Sharapova.
We can now see why there are no superstar carpenters and plumbers. Other 
things being equal, everyone prefers to employ the best carpenter, but a carpenter, 
unlike a movie actor, can provide her services to only a limited number of cus-
tomers. Although the best carpenter will be able to command a somewhat higher 
wage than the average carpenter, the average carpenter will still be able to earn a 
good living.
19-1f Above-Equilibrium Wages: Minimum-Wage Laws, 
Unions, and Efficiency Wages
Most analyses of wage differences among workers are based on the equilibrium 
model of the labor market—that is, wages are assumed to adjust to balance labor 
supply and labor demand. But this assumption does not always apply. For some 
workers, wages are set above the level that brings supply and demand into equi-
librium. Let’s consider three reasons this might be so.
One reason for above-equilibrium wages is minimum-wage laws, as we first 
saw in Chapter 6. Most workers in the economy are not affected by these laws 
because their equilibrium wages are well above the legal minimum. But for some 
workers, especially the least skilled and experienced, minimum-wage laws raise 
wages above the level they would earn in an unregulated labor market.
A second reason that wages might rise above their equilibrium level is the mar-
ket power of labor unions. A union is a worker association that bargains with 
employers over wages and working conditions. Unions often raise wages above 
the level that would prevail in their absence perhaps because they can threaten

to withhold labor from the firm by calling a strike. Studies suggest that union 
workers earn about 10 to 20 percent more than similar, nonunion workers.
A third reason for above-equilibrium wages is suggested by the theory of 
efficiency wages. This theory holds that a firm can find it profitable to pay high 
wages because doing so increases the productivity of its workers. In particular, 
high wages may reduce worker turnover, increase worker effort, and raise the 
quality of workers who apply for jobs at the firm. If this theory is correct, then 
some firms may choose to pay their workers more than they would normally earn.
Above-equilibrium wages, whether caused by minimum-wage laws, unions, 
or efficiency wages, have similar effects on the labor market. In particular, push-
ing a wage above the equilibrium level raises the quantity of labor supplied and 
reduces the quantity of labor demanded. The result is a surplus of labor, or unem-
ployment. The study of unemployment and the public policies aimed to deal with 
it is usually considered a topic within macroeconomics, so it goes beyond the 
scope of this chapter. But it would be a mistake to ignore these issues completely 
when analyzing earnings. Although most wage differences can be understood 
while maintaining the assumption of equilibrium in the labor market, above-­
equilibrium wages play a role in some cases.

19-2 The Economics of Discrimination
Another source of differences in wages is discrimination. Discrimination occurs 
when the marketplace offers different opportunities to similar individuals who 
differ only by race, ethnic group, sex, age, or other personal characteristics. 
­Discrimination reflects some people’s prejudice against certain groups in society. 
Discrimination is an emotionally charged topic that often generates heated debate, 
but economists try to study the topic objectively to separate myth from reality.
19-2a Measuring Labor-Market Discrimination
How much does discrimination in labor markets affect the earnings of different 
groups of workers? This question is important, but answering it is not easy.
There is no doubt that different groups of workers earn substantially different 
wages, as Table 2 demonstrates. The median black man in the United States is paid

21 percent less than the median white man, and the median black woman is paid 
11 percent less than the median white woman. The differences by sex are also sig-
nificant. The median white woman is paid 25 percent less than the median white 
man, and the median black woman is paid 15 percent less than the median black 
man. Taken at face value, these differentials look like evidence that employers dis-
criminate against blacks and women.
Yet there is a potential problem with this inference. Even in a labor market 
free of discrimination, different people have different wages. People differ in the 
amount of human capital they have and in the kinds of work they are able and 
willing to do. The wage differences we observe in an economy are, to some extent, 
attributable to the determinants of equilibrium wages we discussed in the preced-
ing section. Simply observing differences in wages among broad groups—whites 
and blacks, men and women—does not prove that employers discriminate.
Consider, for example, the role of human capital. In 2011, among men age 25 
and older, 32 percent of the white population had a college degree, compared with 
18 percent of the black population. Among women age 25 and older, 31 percent of 
the white population had a college degree, compared with 21 percent of the black 
population. Thus, at least some of the difference between the wages of whites and 
the wages of blacks can be traced to differences in educational attainment.
Moreover, human capital may be more important in explaining wage differ-
entials than years of schooling suggest. Historically, public schools in predomi-
nantly black areas have been of lower quality—as measured by expenditure, class 
size, and so on—than public schools in predominantly white areas. If we could 
measure the quality as well as the quantity of education, the differences in human 
capital among these groups would seem even larger.
Human capital acquired in the form of job experience can also help explain 
wage differences. In particular, women are more likely to interrupt their careers 
to raise children. Among the population aged 25 to 34 (when many people have 
small children at home), only 75 percent of women are in the labor force, com-
pared to 90 percent of men. As a result, female workers, especially at older ages, 
tend to have less job experience than male workers.
Yet another source of wage differences is compensating differentials. Men 
and women do not always choose the same type of work, and this fact may help 
explain some of the earnings differential between men and women. For exam-
ple, women are more likely to be secretaries, and men are more likely to be truck 
drivers. The relative wages of secretaries and truck drivers depend in part on the 
working conditions of each job. Because these nonmonetary aspects are hard to 
measure, it is difficult to gauge the practical importance of compensating differen-
tials in explaining the wage differences that we observe.
In the end, the study of wage differences among groups does not establish any 
clear conclusion about the prevalence of discrimination in U.S. labor markets. 
Most economists believe that some of the observed wage differentials are attribut-
able to discrimination, but there is no consensus about how much. The only con-
clusion about which economists are in consensus is a negative one: Because the 
differences in average wages among groups in part reflect differences in human 
capital and job characteristics, they do not by themselves say anything about how 
much discrimination there is in the labor market.
Of course, differences in human capital among groups of workers may also 
reflect a kind of discrimination. The less rigorous curriculums historically offered 
to female students, for instance, can be considered a discriminatory practice. 
­Similarly, the inferior schools historically available to black students may be

traced to prejudice on the part of city councils and school boards. But this kind of 
discrimination occurs long before the worker enters the labor market. In this case, 
the disease is political, even if the symptom is economic.
Is Emily More Employable than Lakisha?
Although measuring the extent of discrimination from labor-market 
outcomes is hard, some compelling evidence for the existence of such dis-
crimination comes from a creative “field experiment.” Economists Marianne 
Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan answered more than 1,300 help-wanted 
ads run in Boston and Chicago newspapers by sending in nearly 5,000 fake résu-
més. Half of the résumés had names that were common in the African-American 
community, such as Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones. The other half had names 
that were more common among the white population, such as Emily Walsh and 
Greg Baker. Otherwise, the résumés were similar. The results of this experiment 
were published in the American Economic Review in September 2004.
The researchers found large differences in how employers responded to the two 
groups of résumés. Job applicants with white names received about 50 ­percent 
more calls from interested employers than applicants with African-American 
names. The study found that this discrimination occurred for all types of employ-
ers, including those who claimed to be an “Equal Opportunity Employer” in their 
help-wanted ads. The researchers concluded that “racial discrimination is still a 
prominent feature of the labor market.”

19-2b Discrimination by Employers
Let’s now turn from measurement to the economic forces that lie behind dis-
crimination in labor markets. If one group in society receives a lower wage than 
another group, even after controlling for human capital and job characteristics, 
who is to blame for this differential?
The answer is not obvious. It might seem natural to blame employers for dis-
criminatory wage differences. After all, employers make the hiring decisions that 
determine labor demand and wages. If some groups of workers earn lower wages 
than they should, then it seems that employers are responsible. Yet many econ-
omists are skeptical of this easy answer. They believe that competitive, market 
economies provide a natural antidote to employer discrimination. That antidote is 
called the profit motive.
Imagine an economy in which workers are differentiated by their hair color. 
Blondes and brunettes have the same skills, experience, and work ethic. Yet 
because of discrimination, employers prefer to hire workers with brunette hair. 
Thus, the demand for blondes is lower than it otherwise would be. As a result, 
blondes earn a lower wage than brunettes.
How long can this wage differential persist? In this economy, there is an easy 
way for a firm to beat out its competitors: It can hire blonde workers. By hiring 
blondes, a firm pays lower wages and thus has lower costs than firms that hire 
brunettes. Over time, more and more “blonde” firms enter the market to take 
advantage of this cost advantage. The existing “brunette” firms have higher costs 
and, therefore, begin to lose money when faced with the new competitors. These 
losses induce the brunette firms to go out of business. Eventually, the entry of 
blonde firms and the exit of brunette firms cause the demand for blonde workers

to rise and the demand for brunette workers to fall. This process continues until 
the wage differential disappears.
Put simply, business owners who care only about making money are at an 
advantage when competing against those who also care about discriminating. As 
a result, firms that do not discriminate tend to replace those that do. In this way, 
competitive markets have a natural remedy for employer discrimination.
Segregated Streetcars and the Profit Motive
In the early 20th century, streetcars in many southern cities were seg-
regated by race. White passengers sat in the front of the streetcars, and 
black passengers sat in the back. What do you suppose caused and main-
tained this discriminatory practice? And how was this practice viewed by the 
firms that ran the streetcars?
In a 1986 article in the Journal of Economic History, economic historian Jennifer 
Roback looked at these questions. Roback found that the segregation of races on 
streetcars was the result of laws that required such segregation. Before these laws 
were passed, racial discrimination in seating was rare. It was far more common to 
segregate smokers and nonsmokers.
Moreover, the firms that ran the streetcars often opposed the laws requiring 
racial segregation. Providing separate seating for different races raised the firms’ 
costs and reduced their profits. One railroad company manager complained to the 
city council that, under the segregation laws, “the company has to haul around a 
good deal of empty space.”
Here is how Roback describes the situation in one southern city:
The railroad company did not initiate the segregation policy and was not at all 
eager to abide by it. State legislation, public agitation, and a threat to arrest the 
president of the railroad were all required to induce them to separate the races 
on their cars…. There is no indication that the management was motivated 
by belief in civil rights or racial equality. The evidence indicates their primary 
­motives were economic; separation was costly…. Officials of the company may 
or may not have disliked blacks, but they were not willing to forgo the profits 
necessary to indulge such prejudice.
The story of southern streetcars illustrates a general lesson: Business owners 
are usually more interested in making profits than in discriminating against a par-
ticular group. When firms engage in discriminatory practices, the ultimate source 
of the discrimination often lies not with the firms themselves but elsewhere. In 
this particular case, the streetcar companies segregated whites and blacks because 
discriminatory laws, which the companies opposed, required them to do so.

19-2c Discrimination by Customers and Governments
The profit motive is a strong force acting to eliminate discriminatory wage dif-
ferentials, but there are limits to its corrective abilities. Two important limiting 
factors are customer preferences and government policies.
To see how customer preferences for discrimination can affect wages, consider 
again our imaginary economy with blondes and brunettes. Suppose that restau-
rant owners discriminate against blondes when hiring waiters. As a result, blonde 
waiters earn lower wages than brunette waiters. In this case, a restaurant can open 
up with blonde waiters and charge lower prices. If customers care only about the

407
quality and price of their meals, the discriminatory firms will be driven out of 
business, and the wage differential will disappear.
On the other hand, it is possible that customers prefer being served by bru-
nette waiters. If this discriminatory preference is strong, the entry of blonde res-
taurants need not succeed in eliminating the wage differential between brunettes 
and blondes. That is, if customers have discriminatory preferences, a competitive 
market is consistent with a discriminatory wage differential. An economy with 
such discrimination would contain two types of restaurants. Blonde restaurants 
hire blondes, have lower costs, and charge lower prices. Brunette restaurants hire 
brunettes, have higher costs, and charge higher prices. Customers who did not 
care about the hair color of their waiters would be attracted to the lower prices at 
the blonde restaurants. Bigoted customers would go to the brunette restaurants 
and would pay for their discriminatory preference in the form of higher prices.
Another way for discrimination to persist in competitive markets is for the 
government to mandate discriminatory practices. If, for instance, the government 
passed a law stating that blondes could wash dishes in restaurants but could not 
work as waiters, then a wage differential could persist in a competitive market. 
The example of segregated streetcars in the previous case study is one example of 
government-mandated discrimination. Similarly, before South Africa abandoned 
its formal policy of racial segregation called apartheid in 1990, blacks were pro-
hibited from working in some jobs. Discriminatory governments pass such laws 
to suppress the normal equalizing force of free and competitive markets.
To sum up: Competitive markets contain a natural remedy for employer discrimina-
tion. The entry of firms that care only about profit tends to eliminate discriminatory wage 
differentials. These wage differentials persist in competitive markets only when customers 
are willing to pay to maintain the discriminatory practice or when the government man-
dates it.
Discrimination in Sports
As we have seen, measuring discrimination is often difficult. To deter-
mine whether one group of workers is discriminated against, a researcher 
must correct for differences in the productivity between that group and 
other workers in the economy. Yet in most firms, it is difficult to measure a 
­particular worker’s contribution to the production of goods and services.
One type of firm in which such measurements are easier is the sports team. 
Professional teams have many objective measures of productivity. In baseball, for 
instance, we can measure a player’s batting average, the frequency of home runs, 
the number of stolen bases, and so on.
Studies of sports teams suggest that racial discrimination has, in fact, been 
common and that much of the blame lies with customers. One study, published in 
the Journal of Labor Economics in 1988, examined the salaries of basketball players 
and found that black players earned 20 percent less than white players of compa-
rable ability. The study also found that attendance at basketball games was larger 
for teams with a greater proportion of white players. One interpretation of these 
facts is that, at least at the time of the study, customer discrimination made black 
players less profitable than white players for team owners. In the presence of such 
customer discrimination, a discriminatory wage gap can persist, even if team 
owners care only about profit.
A similar situation once existed for baseball players. A study using data from 
the late 1960s showed that black players earned less than comparable white

players. Moreover, fewer fans attended games pitched by blacks than games 
pitched by whites, even though black pitchers had better records than white 
pitchers. Studies of more recent salaries in baseball, however, have found no evi-
dence of discriminatory wage differentials.
Another study, published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1990, exam-
ined the market prices of old baseball cards. This study found similar evidence 
of discrimination. The cards of black hitters sold for 10 percent less than the cards 
of comparable white hitters, and the cards of black pitchers sold for 13 percent 
less than the cards of comparable white pitchers. These results suggest customer 
­discrimination among baseball fans.

The Difference be-
tween Men and Women, 
Revisited: It’s about 
Competition
By Hal R. Varian
G
ender differences are a topic of endless 
discussion for parents, teachers and 
­social scientists. . . . A noteworthy case in 
point is a recent National Bureau of Economic 
­Research working paper by a Stanford econo-
mist, Muriel Niederle, and Lise Vesterlund, a 
University of Pittsburgh economist, titled, “Do 
Women Shy Away From Competition? Do Men 
Compete Too Much?”
It is widely noted that women are not well 
represented in high-paying corporate jobs, 
or in mathematics, science and engineering 
jobs. As the authors observe, the “standard 
economic explanations for such occupational 
differences include preferences, ability and 
discrimination.”
To this list the authors add a new factor: 
attitudes toward competitive environments. 
If men prefer more competitive environments 
than women, then there will be more men 
represented in areas where competition is 
intense.
Of course, discussions of gender differ-
ences of any sort can only be statements about 
averages; it is clear that there are women who 
thrive in competitive environments and men 
who do not. Furthermore, ­attitudes toward 
competition may be ingrained or a result of 
factors like social stereotyping.
Is there any evidence that the hypothesis 
is true? Do men really prefer more competi-
tive environments than women? One could 
cite anecdote after anecdote, but the authors 
took a much more direct approach: they ran 
an experiment.
By using an experiment, the authors were 
able to determine not only whether men and 
women differ in their willingness to compete, 
but more important, whether they differ in 
their willingness to compete conditioned on 
their actual performance.
The economists asked 80 subjects, 
­divided into groups of two women and 
two men, to add up sets of five two-digit

In competitive markets, workers earn a wage equal to the value of their marginal 
contribution to the production of goods and services. There are, however, many 
things that affect the value of the marginal product. Firms pay more for work-
ers who are more talented, more diligent, more experienced, and more educated

numbers for five minutes. The subjects per-
formed the task first on a piece-rate basis 
(50 cents for each correct answer) and then 
as a tournament (the person with the most 
correct ­answers in each group received $2 
per ­correct answer, while other participants 
received nothing). Note that a subject with a 
25 percent chance of being a winner in the 
tournament received the same average pay-
ment as in the piece-rate system.
All participants were told how many 
problems they got right, but not their relative 
­performance. After completing the two tasks, 
the subjects were asked to choose whether 
they preferred a piece-rate system or a tour-
nament for the third set of problems.
There were several interesting findings in 
this experiment. First, there were no differences 
between men and women in their ­performance 
under either compensation system. Despite 
this, twice as many men ­selected the tourna-
ment as women (75 ­percent versus 35 percent).
Even if one accounts for performance 
by comparing only men and women with the 
same number of correct answers, the women 
have a 38 percent lower probability of choos-
ing the tournament compensation.
Why were the men much more likely to 
choose the tournament? Perhaps it was ­because 
they felt more confident about their abilities. The 
data support this hypothesis, with 75 ­percent of 
the men believing that they won their four-player 
tournament, while 43 percent of the women 
thought they were best in their group.
Though both groups were overconfident 
about their performance, the men were much 
more so…. The results of this experiment 
are consistent with the finding by a ­Berkeley 
­finance professor, Terry Odean, that men 
trade stocks excessively, apparently because 
they (wrongly) feel that they have exceptional 
ability to pick winners. Women trade less, but 
do better on average, because they are more 
likely to follow a buy-and-hold strategy.
The authors summarized their experimental 
results by saying, “From a payoff-maximizing 
perspective, high-performing women enter the 
tournament too rarely, and low-performing men 
enter the tournament too often.” The low-per-
forming men and the high-­performing women 
are both hurt by this behavior but, in this 
experiment at least, the costs to the women 
who did not choose the tournament when they 
should have ­exceeded the costs to the men who 
should have avoided the tournament.
One should not read too much into one 
study. But if it is really true that women choose 
occupations that involve less competition, 
then one may well ask why. ­Sociobiologists 
may suggest that such differences come 
from genetic propensities; ­sociologists may 
argue for differences in ­social roles and 
­expectations; developmental psychologists 
may emphasize child-rearing practices. What-
ever the cause, Ms. Niederle and Ms. Vester-
lund have certainly raised a host of ­interesting 
and important questions.

because these workers are more productive. Firms pay less to those workers 
against whom customers discriminate because these workers contribute less to 
revenue.
The theory of the labor market we have developed in the last two chapters 
explains why some workers earn higher wages than other workers. The theory 
does not say that the resulting distribution of income is equal, fair, or desirable in 
any way. That is the topic we take up in Chapter 20.
•	
Workers earn different wages for many reasons. To 
some extent, wage differentials compensate workers 
for job attributes. Other things being equal, workers in  
hard, unpleasant jobs are paid more than workers 
in easy, pleasant jobs.
•	
Workers with more human capital are paid more than 
workers with less human capital. The return to accu-
mulating human capital is high and has increased over 
the past several decades.
•	
Although years of education, experience, and job 
­characteristics affect earnings as theory predicts, there 
is much variation in earnings that cannot be explained 
by things that economists can measure. The unex-
plained variation in earnings is largely attributable to 
natural ability, effort, and chance.
•	
Some economists have suggested that more educated 
workers earn higher wages not because education 
raises productivity but because workers with high 
natural ability use education as a way to signal their 
high ability to employers. If this signaling theory is 
correct, then increasing the educational attainment of 
all ­workers would not raise the overall level of wages.

The Economics of Labor Markets
Questions for Review
  1.	 Why are coal miners paid more than other workers 
with similar amounts of education?
  2.	 In what sense is education a type of capital?
  3.	 How might education raise a worker’s wage without 
raising the worker’s productivity?
  4.	 What conditions lead to highly compensated 
­superstars? Would you expect to see superstars in 
dentistry? In music? Explain.
  5.	 Give three reasons a worker’s wage might be above 
the level that balances supply and demand.
  6.	 What difficulties arise in deciding whether a group of 
workers has a lower wage because of discrimination?
  7.	 Do the forces of economic competition tend to exacer-
bate or ameliorate discrimination based on race?
  8.	 Give an example of how discrimination might persist 
in a competitive market.
•	
Wages are sometimes pushed above the level that 
brings supply and demand into balance. Three rea-
sons for above-equilibrium wages are minimum-wage 
laws, unions, and efficiency wages.
•	
Some differences in earnings are attributable to dis-
crimination based on race, sex, or other factors. 
­Measuring the amount of discrimination is difficult, 
however, because one must correct for differences in 
human capital and job characteristics.
•	
Competitive markets tend to limit the impact of dis-
crimination on wages. If the wages of a group of work-
ers are lower than those of another group for reasons 
not ­related to marginal productivity, then nondiscrimi-
natory firms will be more profitable than discriminatory 
firms. Profit-maximizing behavior, therefore, can ­reduce 
discriminatory wage differentials. Discrimination per-
sists in competitive markets, however, if customers are 
willing to pay more to discriminatory firms or if the 
government passes laws requiring firms to discriminate.

CHAPTER 19  EARNINGS AND DISCRIMINATION
411
  1.	 College students sometimes work as summer interns 
for private firms or the government. Many of these 
positions pay little or nothing.
a.	 What is the opportunity cost of taking such a job?
b.	 Explain why students are willing to take these jobs.
c.	 If you were to compare the earnings later in life 
of workers who had worked as interns and those 
who had taken summer jobs that paid more, what 
would you expect to find?
  2.	 As explained in Chapter 6, a minimum-wage law 
distorts the market for low-wage labor. To reduce this 
distortion, some economists advocate a two-tiered 
minimum-wage system, with a regular minimum 
wage for adult workers and a lower, “subminimum” 
wage for teenage workers. Give two reasons a single 
minimum wage might distort the labor market for 
teenage workers more than it would the market for 
adult workers.
  3.	 A basic finding of labor economics is that workers 
who have more experience in the labor force are paid 
more than workers who have less experience (holding 
constant the amount of formal education). Why might 
this be so? Some studies have also found that experi-
ence at the same job (called job tenure) has an extra 
positive influence on wages. Explain why this might 
occur.
  4.	 At some colleges and universities, economics 
­professors receive higher salaries than professors in 
some other fields.
a.	 Why might this be true?
b.	 Some other colleges and universities have a policy 
of paying equal salaries to professors in all fields. 
At some of these schools, economics professors 
have lighter teaching loads than professors in 
some other fields. What role do the differences in 
­teaching loads play?
  5.	 Imagine that someone offered you a choice: You 
could spend 4 years studying at the world’s best 
­university, but you would have to keep your atten-
dance there a secret. Or you could be awarded an 
­official ­degree from the world’s best university, but 
you couldn’t actually attend. Which choice do you 
think would enhance your future earnings more? What 
does your answer say about the debate over ­signaling 
­versus human capital in the role of education?
  6.	 When recording devices were first invented more than 
100 years ago, musicians could suddenly supply their 
music to large audiences at low cost. How do you 
suppose this development affected the income of the 
best musicians? How do you suppose it affected the 
income of average musicians?
  7.	 A current debate in education is whether teachers 
should be paid on a standard pay scale based solely 
upon their years of training and teaching experience, 
or whether part of their salary should be based upon 
their performance (called “merit pay”).
a.	 Why might merit pay be desirable?
b.	 Who might be opposed to a system of merit pay?
c.	 What is a potential challenge of merit pay?
d.	 A related issue: Why might a school district decide 
to pay teachers significantly more than the salaries 
offered by surrounding districts?
  8.	 When Alan Greenspan (who would later become 
chairman of the Federal Reserve) ran an economic 
consulting firm in the 1960s, he primarily hired female 
economists. He once told the New York Times, 
“I always valued men and women equally, and I 
found that because others did not, good women 
economists were cheaper than men.” Is Greens-
pan’s behavior profit-maximizing? Is it admirable or 
­despicable? If more employers were like Greenspan, 
what would happen to the wage differential between 
men and women? Why might other economic consult-
ing firms at the time not have followed Greenspan’s 
business strategy?
  9.	 This chapter considers the economics of discrimina-
tion by employers, customers, and governments. 
Now consider discrimination by workers. Suppose 
that some brunette workers do not like working with 
blonde workers. Can this worker discrimination ex-
plain lower wages for blonde workers? If such a wage 
differential existed, what would a profit-maximizing 
entrepreneur do? If there were many such entrepre-
neurs, what would happen over time?

Income Inequality 
and Poverty
T
he great British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once summarized 
alternative economic systems as follows: “The inherent vice of capitalism 
is the unequal sharing of blessings. The inherent virtue of socialism is the 
equal sharing of miseries.” Churchill’s quip draws attention to two important 
facts. First, nations that use market mechanisms to allocate resources usu-
ally achieve greater prosperity than those that do not. This is the result of 
Adam Smith’s invisible hand in action. Second, the prosperity that market 
economies produce is not shared equally. Incomes can differ greatly between 
those at the top and those at the bottom of the economic ladder. The gap 
between rich and poor is a fascinating and important topic of study—for 
the comfortable rich, for the struggling poor, and for the aspiring and 
worried middle class.
From the previous two chapters, you should have some understanding 
about why different people have different incomes. A person’s earnings

The Economics of Labor Markets
depend on the supply and demand for that person’s labor, which in turn depend 
on natural ability, human capital, compensating differentials, discrimination,  
and so on. Because labor earnings make up about two-thirds of the total  
income in the U.S. economy, the factors that determine wages are also largely 
responsible for determining how the economy’s total income is distributed 
among the various members of society. In other words, they determine who 
is rich and who is poor.
In this chapter, we discuss the distribution of income—a topic that raises some 
fundamental questions about the role of economic policy. One of the Ten Principles 
of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can sometimes improve market out-
comes. This possibility is particularly important when considering the distribu-
tion of income. The invisible hand of the marketplace acts to allocate resources 
efficiently, but it does not necessarily ensure that resources are allocated fairly. As 
a result, many economists—though not all—believe that the government should 
redistribute income to achieve greater equality. In doing so, however, the govern-
ment runs into another of the Ten Principles of Economics: People face trade-offs. 
When the government enacts policies to make the distribution of income more 
equal, it distorts incentives, alters behavior, and makes the allocation of resources 
less efficient.
Our discussion of the distribution of income proceeds in three steps. First,  
we assess how much inequality there is in our society. Second, we consider  
some different views about what role the government should play in altering 
the distribution of income. Third, we discuss various public policies aimed at 
helping society’s poorest members.
20-1 The Measurement of Inequality
We begin our study of the distribution of income by addressing four questions of 
measurement:
•	 How much inequality is there in our society?
•	 How many people live in poverty?
•	 What problems arise in measuring the amount of inequality?
•	 How often do people move between income classes?
These measurement questions are the natural starting point from which to discuss 
public policies aimed at changing the distribution of income.
20-1a U.S. Income Inequality
Imagine that you lined up all the families in the economy according to their 
annual income. Then you divided the families into five equal groups: the  
bottom fifth, the second fifth, the middle fifth, the fourth fifth, and the top fifth. 
Table 1 shows the income ranges for each of these groups, as well as for the top 
5 percent. You can use this table to find where your family lies in the income 
distribution.
For examining differences in the income distribution over time, economists 
find it useful to present the income data as in Table 2. This table shows the share 
of total income that each group of families received in selected years. In 2011, the 
bottom fifth of all families received 3.8 percent of all income, and the top fifth of 
“As far as I’m concerned, 
they can do what they 
want with the minimum 
wage, just as long as 
they keep their hands off 
the maximum wage.”

all families received 48.9 percent of all income. In other words, even though the 
top and bottom fifths include the same number of families, the top fifth has more 
than twelve times as much income as the bottom fifth.
The last column in the table shows the share of total income received by the 
very richest families. In 2011, the top 5 percent of families received 21.3 percent  
of all income, which was greater than the total income of the poorest 
40 percent.
Table 2 also shows the distribution of income in various years beginning in 
1935. At first glance, the distribution of income appears to have been remarkably 
stable over time. Throughout the past several decades, the bottom fifth of families 
has received about 4 to 5 percent of income, while the top fifth has received about 
40 to 50 percent of income. Closer inspection of the table reveals some trends in 
the degree of inequality. From 1935 to 1970, the distribution gradually became 
more equal. The share of the bottom fifth rose from 4.1 to 5.5 percent, and the

share of the top fifth fell from 51.7 percent to 40.9 percent. In more recent years, 
this trend has reversed itself. From 1970 to 2011, the share of the bottom fifth fell 
from 5.5 percent to 3.8 percent and the share of the top fifth rose from 40.9 to 
48.9 percent.
In Chapter 19, we discussed some explanations for this recent rise in inequality. 
Increases in international trade with low-wage countries and changes in technol-
ogy have tended to reduce the demand for unskilled labor and raise the demand 
for skilled labor. As a result, the wages of unskilled workers have fallen relative 
to the wages of skilled workers, and this change in relative wages has increased 
inequality in family incomes.
20-1b Inequality around the World
How does the amount of inequality in the United States compare to that in other 
countries? This question is interesting, but answering it is problematic. For some 
countries, data are not available. Even when they are, not every country collects 
data in the same way; for example, some countries collect data on individual in-
comes, whereas other countries collect data on family incomes, and still others 
collect data on expenditure rather than income. As a result, whenever we find a 
difference between two countries, we can never be sure whether it reflects a true 
difference in the economies or merely a difference in the way data are collected.
With this warning in mind, consider Figure 1, which compares inequality in 
the twenty-five most populous countries. The inequality measure is the ratio of

the income received by the richest fifth of the population to the income of the 
poorest fifth. The most equality is found in Japan, where the top fifth receives  
3.4 times as much income as the bottom fifth. The least equality is found in South 
Africa, where the top group receives 20.1 times as much income as the bottom 
group. All countries have significant disparities between rich and poor, but the 
degree of inequality varies substantially around the world.
When countries are ranked by inequality, the United States ends up with a bit 
more inequality than the typical country. The United States has greater income 
disparity than most other economically advanced countries, such as Japan and 
Germany. But the United States has a more equal income distribution than some 
developing countries, such as South Africa and Brazil.
20-1c The Poverty Rate
A commonly used gauge of the distribution of income is the poverty rate. The 
poverty rate is the percentage of the population whose family income falls below 
an absolute level called the poverty line. The poverty line is set by the federal 
government at roughly three times the cost of providing an adequate diet. This 
line is adjusted every year to account for changes in the level of prices, and it de-
pends on family size.
To get some idea about what the poverty rate tells us, consider the data for 
2011. In that year, the median family in the United States had an income of 
$60,974, and the poverty line for a family of four was $23,021. The poverty rate 
was 15.0 ­percent. In other words, 15.0 percent of the U.S. population were mem-
bers of families with incomes below the poverty line for their family size.
Figure 2 shows the poverty rate since 1959, when the official data begin. 
You can see that the poverty rate fell from 22.4 percent in 1959 to a low of 
11.1 ­percent in 1973. This decline is not surprising, because average income 
in the economy (adjusted for inflation) rose more than 50 percent during this 
­period. Because the poverty line is an absolute rather than a relative standard, 
more families are pushed above the poverty line as economic growth pushes 
the entire income distribution upward. As John F. Kennedy once put it, a rising 
tide lifts all boats.

Part VI	
The Economics of Labor Markets
Since the early 1970s, however, the economy’s rising tide has left some boats 
behind. Despite continued growth in average income, the poverty rate has not 
declined below the level reached in 1973. This lack of progress in reducing pov-
erty in recent decades is closely related to the increasing inequality we saw in 
Table 2. Although economic growth has raised the income of the typical family, 
the increase in inequality has prevented the poorest families from sharing in this 
greater economic prosperity.
Poverty is an economic malady that affects all groups within the population, 
but it does not affect all groups with equal frequency. Table 3 shows the poverty 
rates for several groups, and it reveals three striking facts:
•	 Poverty is correlated with race. Blacks and Hispanics are about three times 
more likely to live in poverty than are whites.
•	 Poverty is correlated with age. Children are more likely than average to be 
members of poor families, and the elderly are less likely than average to be 
poor.
•	 Poverty is correlated with family composition. Families headed by a female 
adult without a spouse present are about five times as likely to live in poverty 
as families headed by a married couple.
These three facts have described American society for many years, and they show 
which people are most likely to be poor. These effects also work together: Among 
black and Hispanic children in female-headed households, about half live in 
poverty.
20-1d Problems in Measuring Inequality
Although data on the income distribution and the poverty rate give us some 
idea about the degree of inequality in our society, interpreting these data is not 
always straightforward. The data are based on households’ annual ­incomes. 
What people care about, however, is not their incomes but their ability to

CHAPTER 20  INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY

maintain a good standard of living. For at least three reasons, data on the in-
come distribution and the poverty rate give an incomplete picture of inequality 
in living standards.
In-Kind Transfers  Measurements of the distribution of income and the pov-
erty rate are based on families’ money income. Through various government 
programs, however, the poor receive many nonmonetary items, including food 
stamps, housing vouchers, and medical services. Transfers to the poor given in 
the form of goods and services rather than cash are called in-kind transfers. Stan-
dard measurements of the degree of inequality do not take account of these in-
kind transfers.
Because in-kind transfers are received mostly by the poorest members of so-
ciety, the failure to include in-kind transfers as part of income greatly affects the 
measured poverty rate. According to a study by the Census Bureau, if in-kind 
transfers were included in income at their market value, the number of families in 
poverty would be about 10 percent lower than the standard data indicate.
The Economic Life Cycle  Incomes vary predictably over people’s lives. 
A young worker, especially one in school, has a low income. Income rises as the 
worker gains maturity and experience, peaks at around age 50, and then falls 
sharply when the worker retires at around age 65. This regular pattern of income 
variation is called the life cycle.
Because people can borrow and save to smooth out life cycle changes in in-
come, their standard of living in any year depends more on lifetime income than 
on that year’s income. The young often borrow, perhaps to go to school or to buy 
a house, and then repay these loans later when their incomes rise. People have 
their highest saving rates when they are middle-aged. Because people can save 
in anticipation of retirement, the large declines in incomes at retirement need not 
lead to similar declines in the standard of living. This normal life cycle pattern 
causes inequality in the distribution of annual income, but it does not necessarily 
represent true inequality in living standards.
Transitory versus Permanent Income  Incomes vary over people’s lives 
not only because of predictable life cycle variation but also because of ran-
dom and transitory forces. One year a frost kills off the Florida orange crop, 
and Florida orange growers see their incomes fall temporarily. At the same 
time, the Florida frost drives up the price of oranges, and California orange 
growers see their incomes temporarily rise. The next year the reverse might 
happen.
Just as people can borrow and save to smooth out life cycle variation in income, 
they can also borrow and save to smooth out transitory variation in income. To 
the extent that a family saves in good years and borrows (or depletes its savings) 
in bad years, transitory changes in income need not affect its standard of living. 
A family’s ability to buy goods and services depends largely on its permanent 
income, which is its normal, or average, income.
To gauge inequality of living standards, the distribution of permanent in-
come is more relevant than the distribution of annual income. Many econo-
mists believe that people base their consumption on their permanent income; 
as a result, inequality in consumption is one gauge of inequality of permanent 
income. Because permanent income and consumption are less affected by tran-
sitory changes in income, they are more equally distributed than is current 
income.

The Economics of Labor Markets
Alternative Measures of Inequality
A 2008 study by Michael Cox and Richard Alm of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Dallas shows how different measures of inequality lead to dra-
matically different results. Cox and Alm compared American households in 
the top fifth of the income distribution to those in the bottom fifth to see how 
far apart they are.
According to Cox and Alm, the richest fifth of U.S. households in 2006 had an 
average income of $149,963, while the poorest fifth had an average income of $9,974. 
Thus, the top group had about 15 times as much income as the bottom group.
The gap between rich and poor shrinks a bit if taxes are taken into account. 
Because the tax system is progressive, the top group paid a higher percentage of 
its income in taxes than did the bottom group. Cox and Alm found that the richest 
fifth had 14 times as much after-tax income as the poorest fifth.
The gap shrinks more substantially if one looks at consumption rather than in-
come. Households having an unusually good year are more likely to be in the top 
group and are likely to save a high fraction out of their incomes. Households having 
an unusually bad year are more likely to be in the bottom group and are more likely 
to consume out of their savings. According to Cox and Alms, the consumption of 
the richest fifth was only 3.9 times as much as the consumption of the poorest fifth.
The consumption gap becomes smaller still if one corrects for differences in the 
number of people in the household. Because larger families are more likely to have 
two earners, they are more likely to find themselves near the top of the income 
distribution. But they also have more mouths to feed. Cox and Alms reported that 
households in the top fifth had an average of 3.1 people, while those in the bottom 
fifth had an average of 1.7 people. As a result, consumption per person in the richest 
fifth of households was only 2.1 times consumption per person in the poorest fifth.
These data show that inequality in material standards of living is much smaller 
than inequality in annual income. 
20-1e Economic Mobility
People sometimes speak of “the rich” and “the poor” as if these groups consisted 
of the same families year after year. In fact, this is not at all the case. Economic 
mobility, the movement of people between income classes, is significant in the 
U.S. economy. Movements up the income ladder can be due to good luck or hard 
work, and movements down the ladder can be due to bad luck or laziness. Some 
of this mobility reflects transitory variation in income, while some reflects more 
persistent changes in income.
Because family income changes over time, temporary poverty is more common 
than the poverty rate suggests, but persistent poverty is less common. In a typical  
10-year period, about one in four families falls below the poverty line in at least 1 year. 
Yet fewer than 3 percent of families are poor for 8 or more years. Because it is likely that  
the temporarily poor and the persistently poor face different problems, policies  
that aim to combat poverty need to distinguish between these groups.
Another way to gauge economic mobility is the persistence of economic suc-
cess from generation to generation. Economists who have studied this topic find 
that having an above-average income carries over from parents to children, but 
the persistence is far from perfect, indicating substantial mobility among income 
classes. If a father earns 20 percent above his generation’s average income, his son 
will most likely earn 8 percent above his generation’s average income. There is 
only a small correlation between the income of a grandfather and the income of 
his grandson.

One result of this intergenerational economic mobility is that the U.S. economy 
is filled with self-made millionaires (as well as with heirs who have squandered the 
fortunes they inherited). According to one study, about four out of five millionaires 
made their money on their own, often by starting and building a business or by 
climbing the corporate ladder. Only one in five millionaires inherited his fortune.
Quick Quiz  What does the poverty rate measure? • Describe three potential problems 
in interpreting the measured poverty rate.
20-2 The Political Philosophy of Redistributing Income
We have just seen how the economy’s income is distributed and have considered some 
of the problems in interpreting measured inequality. This discussion was positive in the 
sense that it merely described the world as it is. We now turn to the normative question 
facing policymakers: What should the government do about economic inequality?
This question is not just about economics. Economic analysis alone cannot tell us 
whether policymakers should try to make our society more egalitarian. Our views on 
this question are, to a large extent, a matter of political philosophy. Yet because the gov-
ernment’s role in redistributing income is central to so many debates over economic 
policy, here we digress from economic science to consider a bit of political philosophy.
20-2a Utilitarianism
A prominent school of thought in political philosophy is utilitarianism. The 
founders of utilitarianism are the English philosophers Jeremy Bentham 
(1748–1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). To a large extent, the goal of utilitar-
ians is to apply the logic of individual decision making to questions concerning 
morality and public policy.
The starting point of utilitarianism is the notion of utility—the level of hap-
piness or satisfaction that a person receives from his circumstances. Utility is a 
measure of well-being and, according to utilitarians, is the ultimate objective of 
all public and private actions. The proper goal of the government, they claim, is to 
maximize the sum of utility achieved by everyone in society.
The utilitarian case for redistributing income is based on the assumption of 
diminishing marginal utility. It seems reasonable that an extra dollar of income 
provides a poor person with more additional utility than an extra dollar would 
provide to a rich person. In other words, as a person’s income rises, the extra well-
being derived from an additional dollar of income falls. This plausible assump-
tion, together with the utilitarian goal of maximizing total utility, implies that the 
government should try to achieve a more equal distribution of income.
The argument is simple. Imagine that Peter and Paul are the same, except that  
Peter earns $80,000 and Paul earns $20,000. In this case, taking a dollar from ­Peter to 
pay Paul will reduce Peter’s utility and raise Paul’s utility. But because of ­diminishing 
marginal utility, Peter’s utility falls by less than Paul’s utility rises. Thus, this redistri-
bution of income raises total utility, which is the utilitarian’s objective.
At first, this utilitarian argument might seem to imply that the govern-
ment should continue to redistribute income until everyone in society has 
exactly the same income. Indeed, that would be the case if the total amount of 
income—$100,000 in our example—were fixed. But in fact, it is not. Utilitar-
ians reject complete equalization of incomes because they accept one of the Ten 
Principles of Economics presented in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives.

Part VI	
The Economics of Labor Markets
To take from Peter to pay Paul, the government must pursue policies that redis-
tribute income. The U.S. federal income tax and welfare system are examples. Under 
these policies, people with high incomes pay high taxes, and people with low incomes 
receive income transfers. These income transfers are phased out: As a person earns 
more, he receives less from the government. Yet when the government uses higher 
income taxes and phased-out transfers to take away additional income a person might 
earn, both Peter and Paul have less incentive to work hard. As they work less, society’s 
income falls, and so does total utility. The utilitarian government has to balance the 
gains from greater equality against the losses from distorted incentives. To maximize 
total utility, therefore, the government stops short of making society fully egalitarian.
A famous parable sheds light on the utilitarian’s logic. Imagine that Peter and 
Paul are thirsty travelers trapped at different places in the desert. Peter’s oasis has 
a lot of water; Paul’s has only a little. If the government could transfer water from 
one oasis to the other without cost, it would maximize total utility from water by 
equalizing the amount in the two places. But suppose that the government has 
only a leaky bucket. As it tries to move water from one place to the other, some of 
the water is lost in transit. In this case, a utilitarian government might still try to 
move some water from Peter to Paul, depending on the size of Paul’s thirst and 
the size of the bucket’s leak. But with only a leaky bucket at its disposal, a utilitar-
ian government will stop short of trying to reach complete equality.
20-2b Liberalism
A second way of thinking about inequality might be called liberalism. Philoso-
pher John Rawls develops this view in his book A Theory of Justice. This book was 
first published in 1971, and it quickly became a classic in political philosophy.
Rawls begins with the premise that a society’s institutions, laws, and policies 
should be just. He then takes up the natural question: How can we, the members of 
society, ever agree on what justice means? It might seem that every person’s point 
of view is inevitably based on his particular circumstances—whether he is talented 
or less talented, diligent or lazy, educated or less educated, born to a wealthy fam-
ily or a poor one. Could we ever objectively determine what a just society would be?
To answer this question, Rawls proposes the following thought experiment. 
Imagine that before any of us is born, we all get together in the beforelife (the 
pre-birth version of the afterlife) for a meeting to design the rules that will gov-
ern society. At this point, we are all ignorant about the station in life each of us 
will end up filling. In Rawls’s words, we are sitting in an “original position” be-
hind a “veil of ignorance.” In this original position, Rawls argues, we can choose 
a just set of rules for society because we must consider how those rules will affect 
every person. As Rawls puts it, “Since all are similarly situated and no one is able 
to design principles to favor his particular conditions, the principles of justice are 
the result of fair agreement or bargain.” Designing public policies and institu-
tions in this way allows us to be objective about what policies are just.
Rawls then considers what public policy designed behind this veil of ignorance 
would try to achieve. In particular, he considers what income distribution a person 
would consider fair if that person did not know whether he would end up at the 
top, bottom, or middle of the distribution. Rawls argues that a person in the origi-
nal position would be especially concerned about the possibility of being at the bot-
tom of the income distribution. In designing public policies, therefore, we should 
aim to raise the welfare of the worst-off person in society. That is, rather than maxi-
mizing the sum of everyone’s utility, as a utilitarian would do, Rawls would maxi-
mize the minimum utility. Rawls’s rule is called the maximin criterion.

CHAPTER 20  INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY
423
Because the maximin criterion emphasizes the least fortunate person in soci-
ety, it justifies public policies aimed at equalizing the distribution of income. By 
transferring income from the rich to the poor, society raises the well-being of the 
least fortunate. The maximin criterion would not, however, lead to a completely 
egalitarian society. If the government promised to equalize incomes completely, 
people would have no incentive to work hard, society’s total income would 
fall substantially, and the least fortunate person would be worse off. Thus, the 
maximin criterion still allows disparities in income because such disparities can 
improve incentives and thereby raise society’s ability to help the poor. Nonethe-
less, because Rawls’s philosophy puts weight on only the least fortunate mem-
bers of society, it calls for more income redistribution than does utilitarianism.
Rawls’s views are controversial, but the thought experiment he proposes has much 
appeal. In particular, this thought experiment allows us to consider the redistribution 
of income as a form of social insurance. That is, from the perspective of the original 
position behind the veil of ignorance, income redistribution is like an insurance pol-
icy. Homeowners buy fire insurance to protect themselves from the risk of their house 
burning down. Similarly, when we as a society choose policies that tax the rich to 
supplement the incomes of the poor, we are all insuring ourselves against the possi-
bility that we might have been members of poor families. Because people dislike risk, 
we should be happy to have been born into a society that provides us this insurance.
It is not at all clear, however, that rational people behind the veil of ignorance 
would truly be so averse to risk as to follow the maximin criterion. Indeed, be-
cause a person in the original position might end up anywhere in the distribution 
of outcomes, he might treat all possible outcomes equally when designing public 
policies. In this case, the best policy behind the veil of ignorance would be to max-
imize the average utility of members of society, and the resulting notion of justice 
would be more utilitarian than Rawlsian.
20-2c Libertarianism
A third view of inequality is called libertarianism. The two views we have consid-
ered so far—utilitarianism and liberalism—both view the total income of society 
as a shared resource that a social planner can freely redistribute to achieve some 
social goal. By contrast, libertarians argue that society itself earns no income—
only individual members of society earn income. According to libertarians, the 
government should not take from some individuals and give to others to achieve 
any particular distribution of income.
For instance, philosopher Robert Nozick writes the following in his famous 
1974 book Anarchy, State, and Utopia:
We are not in the position of children who have been given portions of pie by 
someone who now makes last minute adjustments to rectify careless cutting. 
There is no central distribution, no person or group entitled to control all the re-
sources, jointly deciding how they are to be doled out. What each person gets, 
he gets from others who give to him in exchange for something, or as a gift. In a 
free society, diverse persons control different resources, and new holdings arise 
out of the voluntary exchanges and actions of persons.
Whereas utilitarians and liberals try to judge what amount of inequality is  
desirable in a society, Nozick denies the validity of this very question.
The libertarian alternative to evaluating economic outcomes is to evaluate the process 
by which these outcomes arise. When the distribution of income is achieved unfairly—
for instance, when one person steals from another—the government has the right and

duty to remedy the problem. But as long as the process determining the distribution of 
income is just, the resulting distribution is fair, no matter how unequal.
Nozick criticizes Rawls’s liberalism by drawing an analogy between the distri-
bution of income in society and the distribution of grades in a course. Suppose you 
were asked to judge the fairness of the grades in the economics course you are now 
taking. Would you imagine yourself behind a veil of ignorance and choose a grade 
distribution without knowing the talents and efforts of each student? Or would 
you ensure that the process of assigning grades to students is fair without regard 
for whether the resulting distribution is equal or unequal? For the case of grades at 
least, the libertarian emphasis on process over outcomes is compelling.
Libertarians conclude that equality of opportunities is more important than 
equality of incomes. They believe that the government should enforce individual 
rights to ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to use his talents and 
achieve success. Once these rules of the game are established, the government has 
no reason to alter the resulting distribution of income.

20-3 Policies to Reduce Poverty
As we have just seen, political philosophers hold various views about what role 
the government should take in altering the distribution of income. Political debate 
among the larger population of voters reflects a similar disagreement. Despite these 
continuing debates, most people believe that, at the very least, the government 
should try to help those most in need. According to a popular metaphor, the gov-
ernment should provide a “safety net” to prevent any citizen from falling too far.
Poverty is one of the most difficult problems that policymakers face. Poor 
families are more likely than the overall population to experience homelessness, 
drug dependence, health problems, teenage pregnancy, illiteracy, unemployment, 
and low educational attainment. Members of poor families are both more likely 
to commit crimes and more likely to be victims of crimes. Although it is hard to 
separate the causes of poverty from the effects, there is no doubt that poverty is 
associated with various economic and social ills.
Suppose that you were a policymaker in the government and your goal was to 
reduce the number of people living in poverty. How would you achieve this goal? 
Here we examine some of the policy options that you might consider. Each of 
these options helps some people escape poverty, but none of them is perfect, and 
deciding upon the best combination to use is not easy.
20-3a Minimum-Wage Laws
Laws setting a minimum wage that employers can pay workers are a perennial 
source of debate. Advocates view the minimum wage as a way of helping the 
working poor without any cost to the government. Critics view it as hurting those 
it is intended to help.
The minimum wage is easily understood using the tools of supply and demand, as 
we first saw in Chapter 6. For workers with low levels of skill and experience, a high 
minimum wage forces the wage above the level that balances supply and demand. It 
therefore raises the cost of labor to firms and reduces the quantity of labor that those

425
firms demand. The result is higher unemployment among those groups of workers 
affected by the minimum wage. Those workers who remain employed benefit from a 
higher wage, but those who might have been employed at a lower wage are worse off.
The magnitude of these effects depends crucially on the elasticity of labor demand. 
Advocates of a high minimum wage argue that the demand for unskilled labor is rel-
atively inelastic so that a high minimum wage depresses employment only slightly. 
Critics of the minimum wage argue that labor demand is more elastic, especially in 
the long run when firms can adjust employment and production more fully. They also 
note that many minimum-wage workers are teenagers from middle-class families so 
that a high minimum wage is imperfectly targeted as a policy for helping the poor.
20-3b Welfare
One way for the government to raise the living standards of the poor is to supple-
ment their incomes. The primary way the government does this is through the 
welfare system. Welfare is a broad term that encompasses various government 
programs. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a program that 
assists families with children and no adult able to support the family. In a typical 
family receiving such assistance, the father is absent and the mother is at home 
raising small children. Another welfare program is Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI), which provides assistance to the poor who are sick or disabled. Note that for 
both of these welfare programs, a poor person cannot qualify for assistance sim-
ply by having a low income. He must also establish some additional “need,” such 
as small children or a disability.
A common criticism of welfare programs is that they create incentives for peo-
ple to become “needy.” For example, these programs may encourage families to 
break up, for many families qualify for financial assistance only if the father is 
absent. The programs may also encourage illegitimate births, for many poor, sin-
gle women qualify for assistance only if they have children. Because poor, single 
mothers are such a large part of the poverty problem and because welfare pro-
grams seem to raise the number of poor, single mothers, critics of the welfare sys-
tem assert that these policies exacerbate the very problems they are supposed to 
cure. As a result of these arguments, the welfare system was revised in a 1996 law 
that limited the amount of time recipients could stay on welfare.
How severe are these potential problems with the welfare system? No one 
knows for sure. Proponents of the welfare system point out that being a poor, 
single mother on welfare is a difficult existence at best, and they are skeptical 
that many people would be encouraged to pursue such a life if it were not thrust 
upon them. Moreover, trends over time do not support the view that the decline 
of the two-parent family is largely a symptom of the welfare system, as the sys-
tem’s critics sometimes claim. Since the early 1970s, welfare benefits (adjusted 
for inflation) have declined, yet the percentage of children living with only one 
parent has risen.
20-3c Negative Income Tax
Whenever the government chooses a system to collect taxes, it affects the dis-
tribution of income. This is clearly true in the case of a progressive income tax, 
whereby high-income families pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes 
than do low-income families. As we discussed in Chapter 12, equity across  
income groups is an important criterion in the design of a tax system.
Many economists have advocated supplementing the income of the poor using 
a negative income tax. According to this policy, every family would report its 
welfare

The Economics of Labor Markets
income to the government. High-income families would pay a tax based on their 
incomes. Low-income families would receive a subsidy. In other words, they 
would “pay” a “negative tax.”
For example, suppose the government used the following formula to compute 
a family’s tax liability:
Taxes owed = (1/3 of income) − $10,000.
In this case, a family that earned $60,000 would pay $10,000 in taxes and a fam-
ily that earned $90,000 would pay $20,000 in taxes. A family that earned $30,000 
would owe nothing. And a family that earned $15,000 would “owe” −$5,000. In 
other words, the government would send this family a check for $5,000.
Under a negative income tax, poor families would receive financial assis-
tance without having to demonstrate need. The only qualification required to 
receive assistance would be a low income. Depending on one’s point of view, 
this feature can be either an advantage or a disadvantage. On the one hand, 
a negative income tax does not encourage illegitimate births and the breakup 
of families, as critics of the welfare system believe current policy does. On the 
other hand, a negative income tax would subsidize not only the unfortunate 
but also those who are simply lazy and, in some people’s eyes, undeserving of 
government support.
One actual tax provision that works much like a negative income tax is the 
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This credit allows poor working families to  
receive income tax refunds greater than the taxes they paid during the year.  
Because the EITC applies only to the working poor, it does not discourage  
recipients from working, as other antipoverty programs may. For the same  
reason, however, it also does not help alleviate poverty due to unemployment, 
sickness, or other inability to work.
20-3d In-Kind Transfers
Another way to help the poor is to provide them directly with some of the goods 
and services they need to raise their living standards. For example, charities pro-
vide the needy with food, clothing, shelter, and toys at Christmas. The government 
gives poor families food stamps, which are government vouchers that can be used 
to buy food at stores; the stores then redeem the vouchers for money. The govern-
ment also gives many poor people healthcare through a program called Medicaid.
Is it better to help the poor with these in-kind transfers or with direct cash pay-
ments? There is no clear answer.
Advocates of in-kind transfers argue that such transfers ensure that the poor 
get what they need most. Among the poorest members of society, alcohol and 
drug addiction is more common than it is in society as a whole. By providing the 
poor with food and shelter, society can be more confident that it is not helping to 
support such addictions. This is one reason in-kind transfers are more politically 
popular than cash payments to the poor.
Advocates of cash payments, on the other hand, argue that in-kind transfers 
are inefficient and disrespectful. The government does not know what goods and 
services the poor need most. Many of the poor are ordinary people down on their 
luck. Despite their misfortune, they are in the best position to decide how to raise 
their own living standards. Rather than giving the poor in-kind transfers of goods

CHAPTER 20  INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY

20-3e Antipoverty Programs and Work Incentives
Many policies aimed at helping the poor can have the unintended effect of dis-
couraging the poor from escaping poverty on their own. To see why, consider the 
following example. Suppose that a family needs an income of $20,000 to maintain 
a reasonable standard of living. And suppose that, out of concern for the poor, the 
government promises to guarantee every family that income. Whatever a family 
earns, the government makes up the difference between that income and $20,000. 
What effect would you expect this policy to have?
The incentive effects of this policy are obvious: Any person who would make 
under $20,000 by working has little incentive to find and keep a job. For every 
dollar that the person would earn, the government would reduce the income 
supplement by a dollar. In effect, the government taxes 100 percent of additional 
earnings. An effective marginal tax rate of 100 percent is surely a policy with a 
large deadweight loss.
The adverse effects of this high effective tax rate can persist over time. A person 
discouraged from working loses the on-the-job training that a job might offer. In 
addition, his children miss the lessons learned by observing a parent with a full-
time job, and this may adversely affect their own ability to find and hold a job.
Although the antipoverty program we have been discussing is hypothetical, 
it is not as unrealistic as might first appear. Welfare, Medicaid, food stamps, 
and the EITC are all programs aimed at helping the poor, and they are all tied to 
family income. As a family’s income rises, the family becomes ineligible for 
these programs. When all these programs are taken together, it is common for 
families to face effective marginal tax rates that are very high. Sometimes the 
effective marginal tax rates even exceed 100 percent so that poor families are 
worse off when they earn more. By trying to help the poor, the government  
discourages those families from working. According to critics of antipov-
erty programs, these programs alter work attitudes and create a “culture of 
poverty.”
It might seem that there is an easy solution to this problem: Reduce benefits to 
poor families more gradually as their incomes rise. For example, if a poor family 
loses 30 cents of benefits for every dollar it earns, then it faces an effective mar-
ginal tax rate of 30 percent. This effective tax reduces work effort to some extent, 
but it does not eliminate the incentive to work completely.
The problem with this solution is that it greatly increases the cost of programs 
to combat poverty. If benefits are phased out gradually as a poor family’s income 
rises, then families just above the poverty level will also be eligible for substan-
tial benefits. The more gradual the phase-out, the more families are eligible, and 
the more the program costs. Thus, policymakers face a trade-off between burden-
ing the poor with high effective marginal tax rates and burdening taxpayers with 
costly programs to reduce poverty.
There are various other ways to reduce the work disincentive of antipoverty 
programs. One is to require any person collecting benefits to accept a govern-
ment-provided job—a system sometimes called workfare. Another possibility is to 
provide benefits for only a limited period of time. This route was taken in the 
1996 welfare reform bill, which imposed a 5-year lifetime limit on welfare recipi-
ents. When President Clinton signed the bill, he explained his policy as follows:  
“Welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life.”

The Economics of Labor Markets

Combating Inequality 
May Require  
Broader Tax
By Eduardo Porter
R
arely have we experienced such a conflu-
ence of arguments in favor of raising taxes 
on the rich. After a hard-won re-election fought 
mainly over taxes and spending, President 
Obama arguably has a mandate from voters 
to tap the wealthy to address our budget woes.
What’s more, raising more money from the 
wealthy might go a long way toward right-
ing our lopsided economy—which delivered 
93 percent of our income growth in the first 
two years of the economic recovery to the rich-
est 1 percent of families, and only 7 percent 
to the rest of us.
Yet while raising more taxes from the 
winners in the globalized economy is a 
start, and may help us dig out of our imme-
diate fiscal hole, it is unlikely to be enough 
to address our long-term needs. The expe-
rience of many other developed countries 
suggests that paying for a government that 
could help the poor and the middle class 
cope in our brave new globalized world will 
require more money from the middle class 
itself.
Many Americans may find this hard to 
believe, but the United States already has 
one of the most progressive tax systems in 
the developed world, according to several 
studies, raising proportionately more rev-
enue from the wealthy than other advanced 
countries do. Taxes on American households 
do more to redistribute resources and reduce 
inequality than the tax codes of most other 
rich nations.
But taxation provides only half the pic-
ture of public finance. Despite the progres-
sivity of our taxes, according to a study of 
public finances across the industrial coun-
tries in the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development, we also have 
one of the least effective governments at 
combating income inequality. There is one 
main reason: our tax code does not raise 
enough money.
This paradox underscores two crucial 
lessons we could learn from the experience 
of our peers around the globe. The first is 
that the government’s success at combat-
ing income inequality is determined less 
by the progressivity of either the tax code 
or the benefits than by the amount of tax 
revenue that the government can spend 
on programs that benefit the middle class 
and the poor.
The second is that very progressive tax 
codes are not very effective at raising money. 
The corollary—suggested by Peter Lindert of 
the University of California, Davis in his 2004 
book “Growing Public”—is that insisting 
on highly progressive taxes that draw most 
revenue from the rich may result in more in-
equality than if we relied on a flatter, more 
“regressive” tax schedule to raise money 
from everybody and pay for a government that 
could help every American family attain a de-
cent standard of living.
Consider government aid for families. 
According to the O.E.C.D. study, our Tem-
porary Assistance for Needy Families is the 
most progressive program of cash benefits 
for families among 22 advanced countries, 
accurately targeted to serve the poor.
But American family cash benefits are 
the least effective at reducing inequality. The 
reason is that they are so meager. The entire 
budget for cash assistance for families in 
the United States amounts to one-tenth of 
1 percent of the nation’s economic output. 
The average across the O.E.C.D. nations is 
11 times bigger. Even including tax breaks 
and direct government services, we spend a 
much smaller share of our economic output 
International Differences in 
Income Redistribution
Many nations have more generous social safety nets than the United 
States, but they also have very different tax systems.
20-4 Conclusion
People have long reflected on the distribution of income in society. Plato, the an-
cient Greek philosopher, concluded that in an ideal society the income of the rich-
est person would be no more than four times the income of the poorest person. 
Although the measurement of inequality is difficult, it is clear that our society has 
much more inequality than Plato recommended.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that govern-
ments can sometimes improve market outcomes. There is little consensus, how-
ever, about how this principle should be applied to the distribution of income.

on family assistance than almost any other 
advanced nation.
The same pattern can be found across a 
range of government programs. The reason 
is always the same: their relatively small 
size. Over all, government cash benefits in 
the United States—including pensions, dis-
ability, unemployment insurance and the 
like—contribute about 10 percent to house-
hold income, on average, according to the 
study. The average across industrial nations 
is twice that.
Our budget reveals a core philosophical 
difference with other advanced countries. In 
the big-government social democracies like 
those of Western Europe, government is ex-
pected to guarantee a set of universal public 
services—from health care to child care to 
pensions—that are considered basic rights 
of citizenry. To pay for this minimum welfare 
package, everybody is expected to contribute 
proportionately into the pot.
Government in the United States has a 
different goal. Benefits are narrower. Social 
Security and Medicare follow a universal ser-
vice template, but only for older Americans. 
Other social spending is aimed carefully to 
benefit the poor. Financed through a more 
progressive tax code, it looks more like char-
ity than a universal right. On top of that, our 
philosophical stance virtually ensures a small 
government.
Progressive taxes make it hard to raise 
money because they distort people’s behavior.  
They encourage taxpayers to reduce their 
tax liability rather than to increase their 
pretax income. High corporate taxes encour-
age companies to avoid them. High taxes on 
capital income also encourage avoidance 
and capital flight. High income tax rates 
on top earners can discourage work and 
investment, too. So trying to raise a lot of 
money with our progressive tax code would 
probably not achieve the goal and could 
damage economic growth.
Big-government social democracies, 
by contrast, rely on flatter taxes to finance 
their public spending, like gas taxes and 
value-added taxes on consumption. The 
Nordic countries, for instance, have very 
low tax rates on capital income relative to 
income from work. And they have relatively 
high taxes on consumption. In Denmark, 
consumption tax revenue amounts to about 
11 percent of the nation’s economy. In the 
United States, sales taxes and excise taxes 
on cigarettes and other items amount to 
roughly 4 percent.
Liberal Democrats have long opposed 
them because they fall much more heavily on 
the poor, who spend a larger share of their in-
comes than the rich. But these taxes have one 
big positive feature: they are difficult to avoid 
and produce fewer disincentives to work or 
invest. That means they can be used to raise 
much more revenue.
Public finances are under strain today on 
both sides of the Atlantic, as governments 
struggle to cope with our long global reces-
sion and the aging of the baby boom genera-
tion. In Southern Europe, the pressure to pare 
back universal welfare systems is intense. In 
the United States, political leaders on both 
sides of the partisan divide have realized 
that even our relatively meager package of 
social goods cannot be sustained with our 
slim tax take.
But the United States has one option 
that most of Europe’s flailing economies do 
not. Its tax revenue is so low, comparatively, 
that it has more space to raise it. A more 
efficient, flatter tax schedule would allow 
us to do so without hindering economic 
activity.
Bruce Bartlett, a tax expert who served in 
the administrations of Ronald Reagan and 
George H. W. Bush, told me last week that he 
thought federal tax revenue could increase 
to 22 percent of the nation’s economic out-
put, well above its historical average of 
18.5 percent, without causing economic 
harm. If President Obama tries to go down 
this road, however, he may have to build a 
flatter tax code.
“We should reform the tax system, no 
question,” William Gale, a tax policy expert 
at the Brookings Institution and co-director 
of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, wrote 
in an e-mail. “We are going to need to move 
beyond the current set of tax instruments to 
raise the needed revenues—a VAT and/or 
a carbon tax seem like the obvious ways to 
go.” And Mr. Bartlett also pointed out: “We 
can’t get all the revenue we need from the 
rich. Eventually, everyone will have to pay 
more.”

Philosophers and policymakers today do not agree on how much income inequal-
ity is desirable, or even whether public policy should aim to alter the distribution 
of income. Much of public debate reflects this disagreement. Whenever taxes are 
raised, for instance, lawmakers argue over how much of the tax hike should fall 
on the rich, the middle class, and the poor.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people face trade-offs. This prin-
ciple is important to keep in mind when thinking about economic inequality. Poli-
cies that penalize the successful and reward the unsuccessful reduce the incentive 
to succeed. Thus, policymakers face a trade-off between equality and efficiency. The 
more equally the pie is divided, the smaller the pie becomes. This is the one lesson 
concerning the distribution of income about which almost everyone agrees.

The Economics of Labor Markets
•	
Data on the distribution of income show a wide dispar-
ity in U.S. society. The richest fifth of families earns more 
than twelve times as much income as the poorest fifth.
•	
Because in-kind transfers, the economic life cycle, 
transitory income, and economic mobility are so 
important for understanding variation in income, it 
is difficult to gauge the degree of inequality in our 
society using data on the distribution of income in a 
single year. When these other factors are taken into 
account, they tend to suggest that economic well-
being is more equally distributed than is annual 
income.
•	
Political philosophers differ in their views about the 
role of government in altering the distribution of in-
come. Utilitarians (such as John Stuart Mill) would 
choose the distribution of income to maximize the sum 
of utility of everyone in society. Liberals (such as John 
Rawls) would determine the distribution of income as 
if we were behind a “veil of ignorance” that prevented 
us from knowing our stations in life. Libertarians (such 
as Robert Nozick) would have the government enforce 
individual rights to ensure a fair process but then not 
be concerned about inequality in the resulting distribu-
tion of income.
•	
Various policies aim to help the poor—minimum-
wage laws, welfare, negative income taxes, and in-
kind transfers. While these policies help some families 
escape poverty, they also have unintended side effects. 
Because financial assistance declines as income rises, 
the poor often face very high effective marginal tax 
rates, which discourage poor families from escaping 
poverty on their own.

hen you walk into a store, you are confronted with thousands of goods that 
you might buy. Because your financial resources are limited, however, you 
cannot buy everything that you want. You therefore consider the prices of 
the various goods offered for sale and buy a bundle of goods that, given your 
­resources, best suits your needs and desires.
In this chapter, we develop a theory that describes how consumers make deci-
sions about what to buy. Thus far in this book, we have summarized consumers’ 
decisions with the demand curve. As we have seen, the demand curve for a good 
reflects consumers’ willingness to pay for it. When the price of a good rises, 
consumers are willing to pay for fewer units, so the quantity demanded 
falls. We now look more deeply at the decisions that lie behind the demand 
curve. The theory of consumer choice presented in this chapter provides a 
more complete understanding of demand, just as the theory of the competi-
tive firm in Chapter 14 provides a more complete understanding of supply.

TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face 
trade-offs. The theory of consumer choice examines the trade-offs that people face 
in their role as consumers. When a consumer buys more of one good, she can 
­afford less of other goods. When she spends more time enjoying leisure and less 
time working, she has lower income and can afford less consumption. When she 
spends more of her income in the present and saves less of it, she must accept a 
lower level of consumption in the future. The theory of consumer choice exam-
ines how consumers facing these trade-offs make decisions and how they respond 
to changes in their environment.
After developing the basic theory of consumer choice, we apply it to three 
questions about household decisions. In particular, we ask:
•	 Do all demand curves slope downward?
•	 How do wages affect labor supply?
•	 How do interest rates affect household saving?
At first, these questions might seem unrelated. But as we will see, we can use the 
theory of consumer choice to address each of them.
21-1 The Budget Constraint: What the Consumer Can Afford
Most people would like to increase the quantity or quality of the goods they con-
sume—to take longer vacations, drive fancier cars, or eat at better restaurants. 
People consume less than they desire because their spending is constrained, or 
­limited, by their income. We begin our study of consumer choice by examining 
this link between income and spending.
To keep things simple, we examine the decision facing a consumer who buys 
only two goods: pizza and Pepsi. Of course, real people buy thousands of dif-
ferent kinds of goods. Assuming there are only two goods greatly simplifies the 
problem without altering the basic insights about consumer choice.
We first consider how the consumer’s income constrains the amount she 
spends on pizza and Pepsi. Suppose the consumer has an income of $1,000 per 
month and she spends her entire income on pizza and Pepsi. The price of a pizza 
is $10, and the price of a liter of Pepsi is $2.
The table in Figure 1 shows some of the many combinations of pizza and Pepsi 
that the consumer can buy. The first row in the table shows that if the consumer 
spends all her income on pizza, she can eat 100 pizzas during the month, but she 
would not be able to buy any Pepsi at all. The second row shows another possible 
consumption bundle: 90 pizzas and 50 liters of Pepsi. And so on. Each consump-
tion bundle in the table costs exactly $1,000.
The graph in Figure 1 illustrates the consumption bundles that the consumer 
can choose. The vertical axis measures the number of liters of Pepsi, and the 
horizontal axis measures the number of pizzas. Three points are marked on this

B, the consumer buys no pizza and consumes 500 liters of Pepsi. At point C, the 
consumer buys 50 pizzas and 250 liters of Pepsi. Point C, which is exactly at the 
middle of the line from A to B, is the point at which the consumer spends an equal 
amount ($500) on pizza and Pepsi. These are only three of the many combinations 
of pizza and Pepsi that the consumer can choose. All the points on the line from A

bundles that the consumer can afford. In this case, it shows the trade-off between 
pizza and Pepsi that the consumer faces.
The slope of the budget constraint measures the rate at which the consumer 
can trade one good for the other. Recall that the slope between two points is 
­calculated as the change in the vertical distance divided by the change in the hori-
zontal distance (“rise over run”). From point A to point B, the vertical distance is 
500 ­liters, and the horizontal distance is 100 pizzas. Thus, the slope is 5 liters per 
pizza. (Actually, because the budget constraint slopes downward, the slope is a 
negative number. But for our purposes we can ignore the minus sign.)
Notice that the slope of the budget constraint equals the relative price of the two 
goods—the price of one good compared to the price of the other. A pizza costs five 
times as much as a liter of Pepsi, so the opportunity cost of a pizza is 5 liters of 
Pepsi. The budget constraint’s slope of 5 reflects the trade-off the market is offer-
ing the consumer: 1 pizza for 5 liters of Pepsi.

21-2 Preferences: What the Consumer Wants
Our goal in this chapter is to see how consumers make choices. The budget

choices, however, depend not only on her budget constraint but also on her pref-
erences regarding the two goods. Therefore, the consumer’s preferences are the 
next piece of our analysis.
21-2a Representing Preferences with 
Indifference Curves
The consumer’s preferences allow her to choose among different bundles of pizza 
and Pepsi. If you offer the consumer two different bundles, she chooses the bun-
dle that best suits her tastes. If the two bundles suit her tastes equally well, we say 
that the consumer is indifferent between the two bundles.
Just as we have represented the consumer’s budget constraint graphically, 
we can also represent her preferences graphically. We do this with indifference 
curves. An indifference curve shows the various bundles of consumption that 
make the consumer equally happy. In this case, the indifference curves show the 
combinations of pizza and Pepsi with which the consumer is equally satisfied.
Figure 2 shows two of the consumer’s many indifference curves. The consumer 
is indifferent among combinations A, B, and C because they are all on the same 
curve. Not surprisingly, if the consumer’s consumption of pizza is reduced, say, 
from point A to point B, consumption of Pepsi must increase to keep her equally 
happy. If consumption of pizza is reduced again, from point B to point C, the 
amount of Pepsi consumed must increase yet again.
The slope at any point on an indifference curve equals the rate at which the 
consumer is willing to substitute one good for the other. This rate is called the 
marginal rate of substitution (MRS). In this case, the marginal rate of substitution 
measures how much Pepsi the consumer requires to be compensated for a one-
unit reduction in pizza consumption. Notice that because the indifference curves 
are not straight lines, the marginal rate of substitution is not the same at all points 
on a given indifference curve. The rate at which a consumer is willing to trade 
one good for the other depends on the amounts of the goods she is ­already con-
suming. That is, the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade pizza for Pepsi 
depends on whether she is hungrier or thirstier, which in turn depends on how 
much pizza and Pepsi she is consuming.
The consumer is equally happy at all points on any given indifference curve, 
but she prefers some indifference curves to others. Because she prefers more

The Consumer’s Preferences
The consumer’s preferences are represented with 
indifference curves, which show the ­combinations 
of pizza and Pepsi that make the consumer equally 
satisfied. Because the consumer prefers more of 
a good, points on a higher indifference curve (I2 
here) are preferred to points on a lower indiffer-
ence curve (I1). The marginal rate of substitution 
(MRS) shows the rate at which the consumer is 
willing to trade Pepsi for pizza. It measures the 
quantity of Pepsi the consumer must be given in 
exchange for 1 pizza.

consumption to less, higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones. In 
Figure 2, any point on curve I2 is preferred to any point on curve I1.
A consumer’s set of indifference curves gives a complete ranking of the 
­consumer’s preferences. That is, we can use the indifference curves to rank any 
two bundles of goods. For example, the indifference curves tell us that point D is 
preferred to point A because point D is on a higher indifference curve than point 
A. (That conclusion may be obvious, however, because point D offers the con-
sumer both more pizza and more Pepsi.) The indifference curves also tell us that 
point D is preferred to point C because point D is on a higher indifference curve. 
Even though point D has less Pepsi than point C, it has more than enough extra 
pizza to make the consumer prefer it. By seeing which point is on the higher indif-
ference curve, we can use the set of indifference curves to rank any combination 
of pizza and Pepsi.
21-2b Four Properties of Indifference Curves
Because indifference curves represent a consumer’s preferences, they have certain 
properties that reflect those preferences. Here we consider four properties that 
describe most indifference curves:
•	 Property 1: Higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones. People usually 
prefer to consume more goods rather than less. This preference for greater 
quantities is reflected in the indifference curves. As Figure 2 shows, higher 
­indifference curves represent larger quantities of goods than lower indiffer-
ence curves. Thus, the consumer prefers being on higher indifference curves.
•	 Property 2: Indifference curves are downward sloping. The slope of an indifference 
curve reflects the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute one good 
for the other. In most cases, the consumer likes both goods. Therefore, if the 
quantity of one good is reduced, the quantity of the other good must increase 
for the consumer to be equally happy. For this reason, most indifference curves 
slope downward.
•	 Property 3: Indifference curves do not cross. To see why this is true, suppose 
that two indifference curves did cross, as in Figure 3. Then, because point 
A is on the same indifference curve as point B, the two points would make 
the ­consumer equally happy. In addition, because point B is on the same 
FIGURE 3
The Impossibility of Intersecting 
Indifference Curves
A situation like this can 
never happen. According to 
these ­indifference curves, the 
­consumer would be equally 
satisfied at points A, B, and C, 
even though point C has more of 
both goods than point A.

­indifference curve as point C, these two points would make the consumer 
equally happy. But these conclusions imply that points A and C would also 
make the consumer equally happy, even though point C has more of both 
goods. This contradicts our assumption that the consumer always prefers 
more of both goods to less. Thus, indifference curves cannot cross.
•	 Property 4: Indifference curves are bowed inward. The slope of an indifference 
curve is the marginal rate of substitution—the rate at which the consumer is 
willing to trade off one good for the other. The marginal rate of substitution 
usually depends on the amount of each good the consumer is ­currently  
consuming. In particular, because people are more willing to trade away 
goods that they have in abundance and less willing to trade away goods 
of which they have little, the indifference curves are bowed inward. As an 
­example, consider Figure 4. At point A, because the consumer has a lot of 
Pepsi and only a little pizza, she is very hungry but not very thirsty. To induce 
the consumer to give up 1 pizza, she has to be given 6 liters of Pepsi: The 
marginal rate of substitution is 6 liters per pizza. By contrast, at point B, the 
consumer has little Pepsi and a lot of pizza, so she is very thirsty but not very 
hungry. At this point, she would be willing to give up 1 pizza to get 1 liter of 
Pepsi: The marginal rate of substitution is 1 liter per pizza. Thus, the bowed 
shape of the indifference curve reflects the consumer’s greater willingness to 
give up a good that she already has in large quantity.
21-2c Two Extreme Examples of Indifference Curves
The shape of an indifference curve tells us about the consumer’s willingness to 
trade one good for the other. When the goods are easy to substitute for each other, 
the indifference curves are less bowed; when the goods are hard to substitute, 
the indifference curves are very bowed. To see why this is true, let’s consider the 
extreme cases.
FIGURE 4
Bowed Indifference Curves
Indifference curves are usu-
ally bowed inward. This shape 
­implies that the marginal rate of 
­substitution (MRS) depends on 
the quantity of the two goods the 
consumer is consuming. At point A, 
the consumer has little pizza and 
much Pepsi, so she requires a lot of 
extra Pepsi to induce her to give up 
one of the pizzas: The marginal rate 
of substitution is 6 liters of Pepsi 
per pizza. At point B, the consumer 
has much pizza and little Pepsi, so 
she requires only a little extra Pepsi 
to induce her to give up one of the 
pizzas: The marginal rate of substi-
tution is 1 liter of Pepsi per pizza.

CHAPTER 21  THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE

Perfect Substitutes  Suppose that someone offered you bundles of nickels and 
dimes. How would you rank the different bundles?
Most likely, you would care only about the total monetary value of each bun-
dle. If so, you would always be willing to trade 2 nickels for 1 dime, regardless of 
the number of nickels and dimes in the bundle. Your marginal rate of substitution 
between nickels and dimes would be a fixed number—2.
We can represent your preferences over nickels and dimes with the indiffer-
ence curves in panel (a) of Figure 5. Because the marginal rate of substitution is 
constant, the indifference curves are straight lines. In this extreme case of straight 
indifference curves, we say that the two goods are perfect substitutes.
Perfect Complements  Suppose now that someone offered you bundles of shoes. 
Some of the shoes fit your left foot, others your right foot. How would you rank 
these different bundles?
In this case, you might care only about the number of pairs of shoes. In other 
words, you would judge a bundle based on the number of pairs you could assem-
ble from it. A bundle of 5 left shoes and 7 right shoes yields only 5 pairs. Getting 1 
more right shoe has no value if there is no left shoe to go with it.
We can represent your preferences for right and left shoes with the indifference 
curves in panel (b) of Figure 5. In this case, a bundle with 5 left shoes and 5 right 
shoes is just as good as a bundle with 5 left shoes and 7 right shoes. It is also just 
as good as a bundle with 7 left shoes and 5 right shoes. The indifference curves, 
therefore, are right angles. In this extreme case of right-angle indifference curves, 
we say that the two goods are perfect complements.
In the real world, of course, most goods are neither perfect substitutes (like 
nickels and dimes) nor perfect complements (like right shoes and left shoes). 
More typically, the indifference curves are bowed inward, but not so bowed that 
they become right angles.

21-3 Optimization: What the Consumer Chooses
Quick Quiz  Draw some indifference curves for pizza and Pepsi. Explain the four prop-
erties of these indifference curves.
The goal of this chapter is to understand how a consumer makes choices. We have 
the two pieces necessary for this analysis: the consumer’s budget constraint (how 
much she can afford to spend) and the consumer’s preferences (what she wants to 
spend it on). Now we put these two pieces together and consider the consumer’s 
decision about what to buy.
21-3a The Consumer’s Optimal Choices
Consider once again our pizza and Pepsi example. The consumer would like to 
end up with the best possible combination of pizza and Pepsi for her—that is, 
the combination on her highest possible indifference curve. But the consumer 
must also end up on or below her budget constraint, which measures the total 
resources available to her.
Figure 6 shows the consumer’s budget constraint and three of her many indif-
ference curves. The highest indifference curve that the consumer can reach (I2 in 
the figure) is the one that just barely touches her budget constraint. The point 
at which this indifference curve and the budget constraint touch is called the 
­optimum. The consumer would prefer point A, but she cannot afford that point 
because it lies above her budget constraint. The consumer can afford point B, but 
that point is on a lower indifference curve and, therefore, provides the consumer 
less satisfaction. The optimum represents the best combination of pizza and Pepsi 
available to the consumer.
Notice that, at the optimum, the slope of the indifference curve equals the 
slope of the budget constraint. We say that the indifference curve is tangent to 
the ­budget constraint. The slope of the indifference curve is the marginal rate of 
FIGURE 6
The Consumer’s Optimum
The consumer chooses the point on 
her budget constraint that lies on the 
­highest indifference curve. At this point, 
called the optimum, the marginal rate of 
­substitution equals the relative price of 
the two goods. Here the highest indiffer-
ence curve the consumer can reach is I2. 
The consumer prefers point A, which lies 
on indifference curve I3, but she cannot 
afford this bundle of pizza and Pepsi. 
By contrast, point B is affordable, but 
­because it lies on a lower indifference 
curve, the consumer does not prefer it.

substitution between pizza and Pepsi, and the slope of the budget constraint is 
the relative price of pizza and Pepsi. Thus, the consumer chooses consumption of the 
two goods so that the marginal rate of substitution equals the relative price.
In Chapter 7, we saw how market prices reflect the marginal value that con-
sumers place on goods. This analysis of consumer choice shows the same result in 
another way. In making her consumption choices, the consumer takes as given the 
relative price of the two goods and then chooses an optimum at which her mar-
ginal rate of substitution equals this relative price. The relative price is the rate at 
which the market is willing to trade one good for the other, whereas the ­marginal 
rate of substitution is the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one good 
for the other. At the consumer’s optimum, the consumer’s valuation of the two 
goods (as measured by the marginal rate of substitution) equals the ­market’s 
­valuation (as measured by the relative price). As a result of this consumer optimi-
zation, market prices of different goods reflect the value that consumers place on 
those goods.
Utility: An Alternative Way to 
Describe Preferences and 
Optimization
W
e have used indifference curves to represent the consumer’s pref-
erences. Another common way to represent preferences is with the 
concept of utility. Utility is an abstract measure of the satisfaction or 
happiness that a consumer receives from a bundle of goods. Econo-
mists say that a consumer prefers one bundle of goods to another if one 
provides more utility than the other.
Indifference curves and utility are closely related. Because the con-
sumer prefers points on higher indifference curves, bundles of goods on 
higher indifference curves provide higher utility. Because the consumer 
is equally happy with all points on the same indifference curve, all 
these bundles provide the same utility. You can think of an indifference 
curve as an “equal-utility” curve.
The marginal utility of any good is the increase in utility that the 
consumer gets from an additional unit of that good. Most goods are 
assumed to exhibit diminishing marginal utility: The more of the good 
the consumer already has, the lower the marginal utility provided by an 
extra unit of that good.
The marginal rate of substitution between two goods depends on 
their marginal utilities. For example, if the marginal utility of good X is 
twice the marginal utility of good Y, then a person would need 2 units of 
good Y to compensate for losing 1 unit of good X, and the marginal rate 
of substitution equals 2. More generally, the marginal rate of substitu-
tion (and thus the slope of the indifference curve) equals the marginal 
utility of one good divided by the marginal utility of the other good.
Utility analysis provides another way to describe consumer optimi-
zation. Recall that, at the consumer’s optimum, the marginal rate of 
substitution equals the 
ratio of prices. That is,
MRS = PX / PY.
Because the marginal rate of substitution equals the ratio of marginal 
utilities, we can write this condition for optimization as
MUX / MUY = PX / PY.
Now rearrange this expression to become
MUX / PX = MUY / PY.
This equation has a simple interpretation: At the optimum, the marginal 
utility per dollar spent on good X equals the marginal utility per dol-
lar spent on good Y. (Why? If this equality did not hold, the consumer 
could increase utility by spending less on the good that provided lower 
marginal utility per dollar and more on the good that provided higher 
marginal utility per dollar.)
When economists discuss the theory of consumer choice, they some-
times express the theory using different words. One economist might 
say that the goal of the consumer is to maximize utility. Another econo-
mist might say that the goal of the consumer is to end up on the high-
est possible indifference curve. The first economist would conclude that 
at the consumer’s optimum, the marginal utility per dollar is the same 
for all goods, whereas the second would conclude that the indifference 
curve is tangent to the budget constraint. In essence, these are two 
ways of saying the same thing.

21-3b How Changes in Income Affect the 
Consumer’s Choices
Now that we have seen how the consumer makes a consumption decision, let’s 
examine how this decision responds to changes in the consumer’s income. To be 
specific, suppose that income increases. With higher income, the consumer can 
afford more of both goods. The increase in income, therefore, shifts the budget 
constraint outward, as in Figure 7. Because the relative price of the two goods has 
not changed, the slope of the new budget constraint is the same as the slope of the 
initial budget constraint. That is, an increase in income leads to a parallel shift in 
the budget constraint.
The expanded budget constraint allows the consumer to choose a better com-
bination of pizza and Pepsi, one that is on a higher indifference curve. Given the 
shift in the budget constraint and the consumer’s preferences as represented by 
her indifference curves, the consumer’s optimum moves from the point labeled 
“initial optimum” to the point labeled “new optimum.”
Notice that, in Figure 7, the consumer chooses to consume more Pepsi and more 
pizza. The logic of the model does not require increased consumption of both 
goods in response to increased income, but this situation is the most common. 
As you may recall from Chapter 4, if a consumer wants more of a good when her 
income rises, economists call it a normal good. The indifference curves in Figure 7 
are drawn under the assumption that both pizza and Pepsi are normal goods.
Figure 8 shows an example in which an increase in income induces the con-
sumer to buy more pizza but less Pepsi. If a consumer buys less of a good when 
her income rises, economists call it an inferior good. Figure 8 is drawn under the 
assumption that pizza is a normal good and Pepsi is an inferior good.
Although most goods are normal goods, there are some inferior goods in the 
world. One example is bus rides. As income increases, consumers are more likely 
FIGURE 7

inferior good.
21-3c How Changes in Prices Affect the 
Consumer’s Choices
Let’s now use this model of consumer choice to consider how a change in the 
price of one of the goods alters the consumer’s choices. Suppose, in particular, 
that the price of Pepsi falls from $2 to $1 per liter. It is no surprise that the lower 
price expands the consumer’s set of buying opportunities. In other words, a fall in 
the price of any good shifts the budget constraint outward.
Figure 9 considers more specifically how the fall in price affects the budget con-
straint. If the consumer spends her entire $1,000 income on pizza, then the price of 
Pepsi is irrelevant. Thus, point A in the figure stays the same. Yet if the consumer 
spends her entire income of $1,000 on Pepsi, she can now buy 1,000 rather than 
only 500 liters. Thus, the end point of the budget constraint moves from point B 
to point D.
Notice that in this case the outward shift in the budget constraint changes 
its slope. (This differs from what happened previously when prices stayed the 
same but the consumer’s income changed.) As we have discussed, the slope of 
the ­budget constraint reflects the relative price of pizza and Pepsi. Because the 
price of Pepsi has fallen to $1 from $2, while the price of pizza has remained $10, 
the consumer can now trade a pizza for 10 rather than 5 liters of Pepsi. As a result, 
the new budget constraint has a steeper slope.
How such a change in the budget constraint alters the consumption of both 
goods depends on the consumer’s preferences. For the indifference curves drawn 
in this figure, the consumer buys more Pepsi and less pizza.
FIGURE 8
An Inferior Good
A good is inferior if the

pizza but less Pepsi.

21-3d Income and Substitution Effects
The impact of a change in the price of a good on consumption can be decomposed 
into two effects: an income effect and a substitution effect. To see what these two 
effects are, consider how our consumer might respond when she learns that the 
price of Pepsi has fallen. She might reason in the following ways:
•	 “Great news! Now that Pepsi is cheaper, my income has greater purchasing 
power. I am, in effect, richer than I was. Because I am richer, I can buy both 
more pizza and more Pepsi.” (This is the income effect.)
•	 “Now that the price of Pepsi has fallen, I get more liters of Pepsi for every 
pizza that I give up. Because pizza is now relatively more expensive, I should 
buy less pizza and more Pepsi.” (This is the substitution effect.)
Which statement do you find more compelling?
In fact, both of these statements make sense. The decrease in the price of Pepsi 
makes the consumer better off. If pizza and Pepsi are both normal goods, the 
consumer will want to spread this improvement in her purchasing power over 
both goods. This income effect tends to make the consumer buy more pizza and 
more Pepsi. Yet at the same time, consumption of Pepsi has become less expensive 
­relative to consumption of pizza. This substitution effect tends to make the con-
sumer choose less pizza and more Pepsi.
Now consider the result of these two effects working at the same time. The 
consumer certainly buys more Pepsi because the income and substitution effects 
both act to increase purchases of Pepsi. But it is ambiguous whether the consumer 
buys more pizza, because the income and substitution effects work in opposite 
­directions. This conclusion is summarized in Table 1.
FIGURE 9
A Change in Price
When the price of Pepsi 
falls, the consumer’s budget 
constraint shifts outward 
and changes slope. The 
consumer moves from the 
initial ­optimum to the new 
optimum, which changes 
her purchases of both pizza 
and Pepsi. In this case, the 
­quantity of Pepsi consumed 
rises, and the quantity of 
pizza consumed falls.

CHAPTER 21  THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE

We can interpret the income and substitution effects using indifference curves. 
The income effect is the change in consumption that results from the movement to a higher 
indifference curve. The substitution effect is the change in consumption that results from 
being at a point on an indifference curve with a different marginal rate of substitution.
Figure 10 shows graphically how to decompose the change in the consumer’s 
decision into the income effect and the substitution effect. When the price of 
Pepsi falls, the consumer moves from the initial optimum, point A, to the new 
optimum, point C. We can view this change as occurring in two steps. First, the 
consumer moves along the initial indifference curve, I1, from point A to point B. 
The consumer is equally happy at these two points, but at point B, the marginal

rate of substitution reflects the new relative price. (The dashed line through point 
B is parallel to the new budget constraint and thus reflects the new relative price.) 
Next, the consumer shifts to the higher indifference curve, I2, by moving from 
point B to point C. Even though point B and point C are on different indiffer-
ence curves, they have the same marginal rate of substitution. That is, the slope of 
the indifference curve I1 at point B equals the slope of the indifference curve I2 at 
point C.
The consumer never actually chooses point B, but this hypothetical point is 
useful to clarify the two effects that determine the consumer’s decision. Notice 
that the change from point A to point B represents a pure change in the marginal 
rate of substitution without any change in the consumer’s welfare. Similarly, 
the change from point B to point C represents a pure change in welfare without 
any change in the marginal rate of substitution. Thus, the movement from A to B 
shows the substitution effect, and the movement from B to C shows the income 
effect.
21-3e Deriving the Demand Curve
We have just seen how changes in the price of a good alter the consumer’s budget 
constraint and, therefore, the quantities of the two goods that she chooses to buy. 
The demand curve for any good reflects these consumption decisions. Recall that 
a demand curve shows the quantity demanded of a good for any given price. We 
can view a consumer’s demand curve as a summary of the optimal decisions that 
arise from her budget constraint and indifference curves.
For example, Figure 11 considers the demand for Pepsi. Panel (a) shows that 
when the price of a liter falls from $2 to $1, the consumer’s budget constraint shifts 
outward. Because of both income and substitution effects, the consumer increases 
FIGURE 11
Panel (a) shows that when the price of Pepsi falls from $2 to $1, the consumer’s 
­optimum moves from point A to point B, and the quantity of Pepsi consumed rises from 
250 to 750 liters. The demand curve in panel (b) reflects this relationship between the 
price and the quantity demanded.

that results from this consumer’s decisions. In this way, the theory of consumer 
choice provides the theoretical foundation for the consumer’s demand curve.
It may be comforting to know that the demand curve arises naturally from the 
theory of consumer choice, but this exercise by itself does not justify developing 
the theory. There is no need for a rigorous, analytic framework just to establish 
that people respond to changes in prices. The theory of consumer choice is, how-
ever, useful in studying various decisions that people make as they go about their 
lives, as we see in the next section.

21-4 Three Applications
Now that we have developed the basic theory of consumer choice, let’s use it to 
shed light on three questions about how the economy works. These three ques-
tions might at first seem unrelated. But because each question involves household 
decision making, we can address it with the model of consumer behavior we have 
just developed.
21-4a Do All Demand Curves Slope Downward?
Normally, when the price of a good rises, people buy less of it. This usual behav-
ior, called the law of demand, is reflected in the downward slope of the demand 
curve.
As a matter of economic theory, however, demand curves can sometimes slope 
upward. In other words, consumers can sometimes violate the law of demand 
and buy more of a good when the price rises. To see how this can happen, consider 
Figure 12. In this example, the consumer buys two goods—meat and potatoes. 
Initially, the consumer’s budget constraint is the line from point A to point B. The 
optimum is point C. When the price of potatoes rises, the budget constraint shifts 
inward and is now the line from point A to point D. The optimum is now point E. 
Notice that a rise in the price of potatoes has led the consumer to buy a larger 
quantity of potatoes.
Why is the consumer responding in a seemingly perverse way? In this exam-
ple, potatoes are a strongly inferior good. When the price of potatoes rises, the 
consumer is poorer. The income effect makes the consumer want to buy less meat 
and more potatoes. At the same time, because the potatoes have become more 
expensive relative to meat, the substitution effect makes the consumer want to 
buy more meat and fewer potatoes. In this particular case, however, the income 
effect is so strong that it exceeds the substitution effect. In the end, the consumer 
responds to the higher price of potatoes by buying less meat and more potatoes.
Economists use the term Giffen good to describe a good that violates the law 
of demand. (The term is named for economist Robert Giffen, who first noted this 
possibility.) In this example, potatoes are a Giffen good. Giffen goods are inferior 
goods for which the income effect dominates the substitution effect. Therefore, 
they have demand curves that slope upward.

The Search for Giffen Goods
Have any actual Giffen goods ever been observed? Some historians 
suggest that potatoes were a Giffen good during the Irish potato ­famine 
of the 19th century. Potatoes were such a large part of people’s diet that 
when the price of potatoes rose, it had a large income effect. People responded 
to their reduced living standard by cutting back on the luxury of meat and buying 
more of the staple food of potatoes. Thus, it is argued that a higher price of pota-
toes actually raised the quantity of potatoes demanded.
A recent study by Robert Jensen and Nolan Miller has produced similar but 
more concrete evidence for the existence of Giffen goods. These two economists 
conducted a field experiment for five months in the Chinese province of Hunan. 
They gave randomly selected households vouchers that subsidized the purchase 
of rice, a staple in local diets, and used surveys to measure how consumption 
of rice responded to changes in the price. They found strong evidence that poor 
households exhibited Giffen behavior. Lowering the price of rice with the subsidy 
voucher caused households to reduce their consumption of rice, and removing 
the subsidy had the opposite effect. Jensen and Miller wrote, “To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first rigorous empirical evidence of Giffen behavior.”
Thus, the theory of consumer choice allows demand curves to slope upward, 
and sometimes that strange phenomenon actually occurs. As a result, the law 
of demand we first saw in Chapter 4 is not completely reliable. It is safe to say, 
­however, that Giffen goods are very rare.

21-4b How Do Wages Affect Labor Supply?
So far, we have used the theory of consumer choice to analyze how a person 
­allocates income between two goods. We can use the same theory to analyze how 
a person allocates time. People spend some of their time enjoying leisure and

some of it working so they can afford to buy consumption goods. The essence of 
the time-allocation problem is the trade-off between leisure and consumption.
Consider the decision facing Carrie, a freelance software designer. Carrie is 
awake for 100 hours per week. She spends some of this time enjoying leisure—
riding her bike, watching television, and studying economics. She spends the 
rest of this time at her computer developing software. For every hour she works 
developing software, she earns $50, which she spends on consumption goods—
food, clothing, and music downloads. Her wage ($50) reflects the trade-off Carrie 
faces between leisure and consumption. For every hour of leisure she gives up, 
she works one more hour and gets $50 of consumption.
Figure 13 shows Carrie’s budget constraint. If she spends all 100 hours enjoy-
ing leisure, she has no consumption. If she spends all 100 hours working, she 
earns a weekly consumption of $5,000 but has no time for leisure. If she works a 
normal 40-hour week, she enjoys 60 hours of leisure and has weekly consumption 
of $2,000.
Figure 13 uses indifference curves to represent Carrie’s preferences for con-
sumption and leisure. Here consumption and leisure are the two “goods” ­between 
which Carrie is choosing. Because Carrie always prefers more leisure and more 
consumption, she prefers points on higher indifference curves to points on lower 
ones. At a wage of $50 per hour, Carrie chooses a combination of consumption 
and leisure represented by the point labeled “optimum.” This is the point on the 
budget constraint that is on the highest possible indifference curve, I2.
Now consider what happens when Carrie’s wage increases from $50 to $60 per 
hour. Figure 14 shows two possible outcomes. In each case, the budget constraint, 
shown in the left graphs, shifts outward from BC1 to BC2. In the process, the bud-
get constraint becomes steeper, reflecting the change in relative price: At the higher 
wage, Carrie earns more consumption for every hour of leisure that she gives up.
Carrie’s preferences, as represented by her indifference curves, determine how 
her choice regarding consumption and leisure responds to the higher wage. In 
both panels, consumption rises. Yet the response of leisure to the change in the 
wage is different in the two cases. In panel (a), Carrie responds to the higher wage 
by enjoying less leisure. In panel (b), Carrie responds by enjoying more leisure.

Because hours worked equal total hours available minus hours of leisure, any change 
in leisure implies an opposite change in the quantity of labor supplied. In panel (a), 
when the wage rises, consumption rises and leisure falls, resulting in a labor-supply 
curve that slopes upward. In panel (b), when the wage rises, both consumption and 
leisure rise, resulting in a labor-supply curve that slopes backward.

and work more, so the labor-supply curve slopes upward. In panel (b), a higher 
wage induces Carrie to enjoy more leisure and work less, so the labor-supply 
curve slopes “backward.”
At first, the backward-sloping labor-supply curve is puzzling. Why would a 
person respond to a higher wage by working less? The answer comes from con-
sidering the income and substitution effects of a higher wage.
Consider first the substitution effect. When Carrie’s wage rises, leisure ­becomes 
more costly relative to consumption, and this encourages Carrie to substitute 
away from leisure and toward consumption. In other words, the substitution 
­effect induces Carrie to work more in response to higher wages, which tends to 
make the labor-supply curve slope upward.
Now consider the income effect. When Carrie’s wage rises, she moves to a 
higher indifference curve. She is now better off than she was. As long as consump-
tion and leisure are both normal goods, she tends to want to use this increase in 
well-being to enjoy both higher consumption and greater leisure. In other words, 
the income effect induces her to work less, which tends to make the labor-supply 
curve slope backward.
In the end, economic theory does not give a clear prediction about whether an 
increase in the wage induces Carrie to work more or less. If the substitution effect 
is greater than the income effect for Carrie, she works more. If the income effect is 
greater than the substitution effect, she works less. The labor-supply curve, there-
fore, could be either upward or backward sloping.
Income Effects on Labor Supply: Historical Trends, Lottery Winners, 
and the Carnegie Conjecture
The idea of a backward-sloping labor-supply curve might at first seem 
like a mere theoretical curiosity, but in fact it is not. Evidence indicates that 
the labor-supply curve, considered over long periods, does in fact slope back-
ward. A hundred years ago, many people worked six days a week. Today, five-day 
workweeks are the norm. At the same time that the length of the workweek has 
been falling, the wage of the typical worker (adjusted for inflation) has been rising.
Here is how economists explain this historical pattern: Over time, advances in 
technology raise workers’ productivity and, thereby, the demand for labor. This 
increase in labor demand raises equilibrium wages. As wages rise, so does the re-
ward for working. Yet rather than responding to this increased incentive by work-
ing more, most workers choose to take part of their greater prosperity in the form 
of more leisure. In other words, the income effect of higher wages dominates the 
substitution effect.
Further evidence that the income effect on labor supply is strong comes from 
a very different kind of data: winners of lotteries. Winners of large prizes in the 
lottery see large increases in their incomes and, as a result, large outward shifts in 
their budget constraints. Because the winners’ wages have not changed, however, 
the slopes of their budget constraints remain the same. There is, therefore, no sub-
stitution effect. By examining the behavior of lottery winners, we can isolate the 
income effect on labor supply.
The results from studies of lottery winners are striking. Of those winners who 
win more than $50,000, almost 25 percent quit working within a year and another 
9 percent reduce the number of hours they work. Of those winners who win more 
than $1 million, almost 40 percent stop working. The income effect on labor sup-
ply of winning such a large prize is substantial.

TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
Similar results were found in a 1993 study, published in the Quarterly ­Journal of 
Economics, of how receiving a bequest affects a person’s labor supply. The study 
found that a single person who inherits more than $150,000 is four times as likely 
to stop working as a single person who inherits less than $25,000. This find-
ing would not have surprised the 19th-century industrialist Andrew ­Carnegie. 
­Carnegie warned that “the parent who leaves his son enormous wealth gener-
ally deadens the talents and energies of the son, and tempts him to lead a less 
­useful and less worthy life than he otherwise would.” That is, Carnegie viewed 
the ­income effect on labor supply to be substantial and, from his paternalistic per-
spective, ­regrettable. During his life and at his death, Carnegie gave much of his 
vast fortune to charity. 
21-4c How Do Interest Rates Affect 
Household Saving?
An important decision that every person faces is how much income to consume 
today and how much to save for the future. We can use the theory of consumer 
choice to analyze how people make this decision and how the amount they save 
depends on the interest rate their savings will earn.
Consider the decision facing Saul, a worker planning for retirement. To keep 
things simple, let’s divide Saul’s life into two periods. In the first period, Saul is 
young and working. In the second period, he is old and retired. When young, 
Saul earns $100,000. He divides this income between current consumption and 
saving. When he is old, Saul will consume what he has saved, including the inter-
est that his savings have earned.
Suppose the interest rate is 10 percent. Then for every dollar that Saul saves 
when young, he can consume $1.10 when old. We can view “consumption when 
young” and “consumption when old” as the two goods that Saul must choose 
­between. The interest rate determines the relative price of these two goods.
Figure 15 shows Saul’s budget constraint. If he saves nothing, he con-
sumes $100,000 when young and nothing when old. If he saves everything, he

consumes nothing when young and $110,000 when old. The budget constraint 
shows these and all the intermediate possibilities.
Figure 15 uses indifference curves to represent Saul’s preferences for consump-
tion in the two periods. Because Saul prefers more consumption in both periods, 
he prefers points on higher indifference curves to points on lower ones. Given 
his preferences, Saul chooses the optimal combination of consumption in both 
­periods of life, which is the point on the budget constraint that is on the highest 
possible indifference curve. At this optimum, Saul consumes $50,000 when young 
and $55,000 when old.
Now consider what happens when the interest rate increases from 10 percent 
to 20 percent. Figure 16 shows two possible outcomes. In both cases, the budget 
constraint shifts outward and becomes steeper. At the new, higher interest rate, 
Saul gets more consumption when old for every dollar of consumption that he 
gives up when young.
The two panels show the results given different preferences by Saul. In both 
cases, consumption when old rises. Yet the response of consumption when young 
to the change in the interest rate is different in the two cases. In panel (a), Saul 
responds to the higher interest rate by consuming less when young. In panel (b), 
Saul responds by consuming more when young.
Saul’s saving is his income when young minus the amount he consumes when 
young. In panel (a), an increase in the interest rate reduces consumption when 
young, so saving must rise. In panel (b), an increase in the interest rate induces 
Saul to consume more when young, so saving must fall.
FIGURE 16
In both panels, an increase in the interest rate shifts the budget constraint outward. In 
panel (a), consumption when young falls, and consumption when old rises. The result is an 
­increase in saving when young. In panel (b), consumption in both periods rises. The result is 
a ­decrease in saving when young.

The case shown in panel (b) might at first seem odd: Saul responds to an 
­increase in the return to saving by saving less. Yet this behavior is not as peculiar 
as it might seem. We can understand it by considering the income and substitu-
tion effects of a higher interest rate.
Consider first the substitution effect. When the interest rate rises, consumption 
when old becomes less costly relative to consumption when young. Therefore, the 
substitution effect induces Saul to consume more when old and less when young. 
In other words, the substitution effect induces Saul to save more.
Now consider the income effect. When the interest rate rises, Saul moves to a 
higher indifference curve. He is now better off than he was. As long as consump-
tion in both periods consists of normal goods, he tends to want to use this increase 
in well-being to enjoy higher consumption in both periods. In other words, the 
income effect induces him to save less.
The result depends on both the income and substitution effects. If the substi-
tution effect of a higher interest rate is greater than the income effect, Saul saves 
more. If the income effect is greater than the substitution effect, Saul saves less. 
Thus, the theory of consumer choice says that an increase in the interest rate could 
either encourage or discourage saving.
This ambiguous result is interesting from the standpoint of economic theory, 
but it is disappointing from the standpoint of economic policy. It turns out that 
an important issue in tax policy hinges in part on how saving responds to inter-
est rates. Some economists have advocated reducing the taxation of interest and 
other capital income. They argue that such a policy change would raise the after-
tax ­interest rate that savers can earn and thereby encourage people to save more. 
Other economists have argued that because of offsetting income and substitution 
effects, such a tax change might not increase saving and could even reduce it. 
Unfortunately, research has not led to a consensus about how interest rates affect 
saving. As a result, there remains disagreement among economists about whether 
changes in tax policy aimed to encourage saving would, in fact, have the intended 
effect.
21-5 Conclusion: Do People Really Think 
This Way?
The theory of consumer choice describes how people make decisions. As we have 
seen, it has broad applicability. It can explain how a person chooses between pizza 
and Pepsi, work and leisure, consumption and saving, and so on.
At this point, however, you might be tempted to treat the theory of consumer 
choice with some skepticism. After all, you are a consumer. You decide what to 
buy every time you walk into a store. And you know that you do not decide by 
writing down budget constraints and indifference curves. Doesn’t this knowledge 
about your own decision making provide evidence against the theory?
The answer is no. The theory of consumer choice does not try to present a lit-
eral account of how people make decisions. It is a model. And as we first dis-
cussed in Chapter 2, models are not intended to be completely realistic.

CHAPTER 21  THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE
457
The best way to view the theory of consumer choice is as a metaphor for how 
consumers make decisions. No consumer (except an occasional economist) goes 
through the explicit optimization envisioned in the theory. Yet consumers are 
aware that their choices are constrained by their financial resources. And given 
those constraints, they do the best they can to achieve the highest level of satisfac-
tion. The theory of consumer choice tries to describe this implicit, psychological 
process in a way that permits explicit, economic analysis.
Just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the test of a theory is in its 
­applications. In the last section of this chapter, we applied the theory of consumer 
choice to three practical issues about the economy. If you take more advanced 
courses in economics, you will see that this theory provides the framework for 
much additional analysis.
•	
A consumer’s budget constraint shows the possible 
combinations of different goods she can buy given 
her income and the prices of the goods. The slope of 
the budget constraint equals the relative price of the 
goods.
•	
The consumer’s indifference curves represent her 
preferences. An indifference curve shows the various 
­bundles of goods that make the consumer equally 
happy. Points on higher indifference curves are pre-
ferred to points on lower indifference curves. The slope 
of an indifference curve at any point is the consumer’s 
marginal rate of substitution—the rate at which the 
consumer is willing to trade one good for the other.
•	
The consumer optimizes by choosing the point on her 
budget constraint that lies on the highest indifference 
curve. At this point, the slope of the indifference curve 
(the marginal rate of substitution between the goods) 
equals the slope of the budget constraint (the relative 
price of the goods), and the consumer’s valuation 
of the two goods (measured by the marginal rate of 
substitution) equals the market’s valuation (measured 
by the relative price).
•	
When the price of a good falls, the impact on the con-
sumer’s choices can be broken down into an income 
effect and a substitution effect. The income effect is 
the change in consumption that arises because a lower 
price makes the consumer better off. The substitution 
effect is the change in consumption that arises because 
a price change encourages greater consumption of the 
good that has become relatively cheaper. The income 
effect is reflected in the movement from a lower to a 
higher indifference curve, whereas the substitution 
­effect is reflected by a movement along an indifference 
curve to a point with a different slope.
•	
The theory of consumer choice can be applied in many 
situations. It explains why demand curves can poten-
tially slope upward, why higher wages could either 
increase or decrease the quantity of labor supplied, 
and why higher interest rates could either increase or 
decrease saving.

Frontiers of 
Microeconomics
E
conomics is a study of the choices that people make and the resulting 
­interactions they have with one another. This study has many facets, as we 
have seen in the preceding chapters. Yet it would be a mistake to think that 
all the facets we have seen make up a finished jewel, perfect and unchanging. 
Like all scientists, economists are always on the lookout for new areas to study 
and new phenomena to explain. This final chapter on microeconomics offers an 
assortment of three topics at the discipline’s frontier to show how economists are 
trying to expand their understanding of human behavior and society.
The first topic is the economics of asymmetric information. In many different 
situations, some people are better informed than others, and the ­imbalance 
in information affects the choices they make and how they deal with one 
­another. Thinking about this asymmetry can shed light on many aspects of 
the world, from the market for used cars to the custom of gift giving.

Topics for Further Study
The second topic we examine in this chapter is political economy. Throughout 
this book, we have seen many examples in which markets fail and government 
policy can potentially improve matters. But “potentially” is a necessary qualifier: 
Whether this potential is realized depends on how well our political institutions 
work. The field of political economy uses the tools of economics to understand 
the functioning of government.
The third topic in this chapter is behavioral economics. This field brings some of 
the insights from psychology into the study of economic issues. It offers a view of 
human behavior that is more subtle and complex than the one found in conven-
tional economic theory, a view that may be more realistic.
This chapter covers a lot of ground. To do so, it offers not full helpings of these 
three topics but, instead, a taste of each. One goal of this chapter is to show a few 
of the directions economists are heading in their effort to expand knowledge of 
how the economy works. Another is to whet your appetite for more courses in 
economics.
22-1 Asymmetric Information
“I know something you don’t know.” This statement is a common taunt among 
children, but it also conveys a deep truth about how people sometimes interact 
with one another. Many times in life, one person knows more about what is going 
on than another. A difference in access to knowledge that is relevant to an interac-
tion is called an information asymmetry.
Examples abound. A worker knows more than his employer about how much 
effort he puts into his job. A seller of a used car knows more than the buyer about 
the car’s condition. The first is an example of a hidden action, whereas the second 
is an example of a hidden characteristic. In each case, the uninformed party (the 
employer, the car buyer) would like to know the relevant information, but the 
­informed party (the worker, the car seller) may have an incentive to conceal it.
Because asymmetric information is so prevalent, economists have devoted 
much effort in recent decades to studying its effects. Let’s discuss some of the 
­insights that this study has revealed.
22-1a Hidden Actions: Principals, Agents, 
and Moral Hazard
Moral hazard is a problem that arises when one person, called the agent, is 
­performing some task on behalf of another person, called the principal. If the prin-
cipal cannot perfectly monitor the agent’s behavior, the agent tends to ­undertake 
less effort than the principal considers desirable. The phrase moral hazard refers to 
the risk, or “hazard,” of inappropriate or otherwise “immoral” behavior by the 
agent. In such a situation, the principal tries various ways to encourage the agent 
to act more responsibly.
The employment relationship is the classic example. The employer is the prin-
cipal, and the worker is the agent. The moral-hazard problem is the temptation 
of imperfectly monitored workers to shirk their responsibilities. Employers can 
respond to this problem in various ways:
•	 Better monitoring. Employers may plant hidden video cameras to record work-
ers’ behavior. The aim is to catch irresponsible actions that might occur when 
supervisors are absent.

CHAPTER 22  FRONTIERS OF MICROECONOMICS
463
•	 High wages. According to efficiency-wage theories (discussed in Chapter 19), 
some employers may choose to pay their workers a wage above the level that 
balances supply and demand in the labor market. A worker who earns an 
above-equilibrium wage is less likely to shirk because if he is caught and fired, 
he might not be able to find another high-paying job.
•	 Delayed payment. Firms can delay part of a worker’s compensation, so if the 
worker is caught shirking and is fired, he suffers a larger penalty. One example 
of delayed compensation is the year-end bonus. Similarly, a firm may choose 
to pay its workers more later in their lives. Thus, the wage increases that 
workers get as they age may reflect not just the benefits of experience but also 
a response to moral hazard.
Employers can use any combination of these various mechanisms to reduce the 
problem of moral hazard.
There are also many examples of moral hazard beyond the workplace.

Corporate Management
M
uch production in the modern economy takes place within corpora-
tions. Like other firms, corporations buy inputs in markets for the 
factors of production and sell their output in markets for goods and 
­services. Also like other firms, they are guided in their decisions by the 
objective of profit maximization. But a large corporation has to deal with 
some issues that do not arise in, say, a small family-owned business.
What is distinctive about a corporation? From a legal standpoint, a 
corporation is an organization that is granted a charter recognizing it as 
a separate legal entity, with its own rights and responsibilities ­distinct 
from those of its owners and employees. From an economic standpoint, 
the most important feature of the corporate form of organization is the 
separation of ownership and control. One group of people, called the 
shareholders, own the corporation and share in its profits. Another 
group of people, called the managers, are employed by the corporation 
to make decisions about how to deploy the corporation’s resources.
The separation of ownership and control creates a principal-agent 
problem. In this case, the shareholders are the principals and the man-
agers are the agents. The chief executive officer and other managers, 
who are in the best position to know the available business opportuni-
ties, are charged with the task of maximizing profits for the sharehold-
ers. But ensuring that they carry out this task is not always easy. The 
managers may have goals of their own, such as taking life easy, having 
a plush office and a private jet, throwing lavish parties, or presiding 
over a large business empire. The managers’ goals may not always 
­coincide with the shareholders’ goal of profit maximization.
The corporation’s board of directors is responsible for hiring 
and firing the top management. The board monitors the managers’ 
performance, and it designs 
their compensation pack-
ages. These packages often 
include incentives aimed at aligning the 
interests of shareholders with the interests of 
management. ­Managers might be given bonuses based on performance 
or options to buy the company’s stock, which are more valuable if the 
company performs well.
Note, however, that the directors are themselves agents of the 
shareholders. The existence of a board overseeing management only 
shifts the principal-agent problem. The issue then becomes how to 
ensure that the board of directors fulfills its own legal obligation of 
acting in the best interest of the shareholders. If the directors ­become 
too friendly with management, they may not provide the required 
oversight.
The corporation’s principal-agent problem became big news around 
2005. The top managers of several prominent companies, such as 
­Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom, were found to be engaging in activities 
that enriched themselves at the expense of their shareholders. In these 
cases, the actions were so extreme as to be criminal, and the corporate 
managers were not just fired but also sent to prison. Some shareholders 
sued directors for failing to monitor management sufficiently.
Fortunately, criminal activity by corporate managers is rare. But in 
some ways, it is only the tip of the iceberg. Whenever ownership and 
control are separated, as they are in most large corporations, there is an 
inevitable tension between the interests of shareholders and the inter-
ests of management.

because the homeowner bears the cost of the extinguisher while the insurance 
company receives much of the benefit. A family may live near a river with a high 
risk of flooding because the family enjoys the scenic views, while the govern-
ment bears the cost of disaster relief after a flood. Many regulations are aimed at 
addressing the problem: An insurance company may require homeowners to buy 
fire extinguishers, and the government may prohibit building homes on land with 
high risk of flooding. But the insurance company does not have perfect informa-
tion about how cautious homeowners are, and the government does not have per-
fect information about the risk that families undertake when choosing where to 
live. As a result, the problem of moral hazard persists.
22-1b Hidden Characteristics: Adverse Selection 
and the Lemons Problem
Adverse selection is a problem that arises in markets in which the seller knows 
more about the attributes of the good being sold than the buyer does. In such 
a situation, the buyer runs the risk of being sold a good of low quality. That is, 
the “selection” of goods sold may be “adverse” from the standpoint of the unin-
formed buyer.
The classic example of adverse selection is the market for used cars. Sellers of 
used cars know their vehicles’ defects while buyers often do not. Because owners 
of the worst cars are more likely to sell them than are the owners of the best cars, 
buyers are apprehensive about getting a “lemon.” As a result, many people avoid 
buying vehicles in the used car market. This lemons problem can explain why a 
used car only a few weeks old sells for thousands of dollars less than a new car 
of the same type. A buyer of the used car might surmise that the seller is getting 
rid of the car quickly because the seller knows something about it that the buyer 
does not.
A second example of adverse selection occurs in the labor market. According 
to another efficiency-wage theory, workers vary in their abilities, and they may 
know their own abilities better than do the firms that hire them. When a firm cuts 
the wage it pays, the more talented workers are more likely to quit, knowing they 
are better able to find other employment. Conversely, a firm may choose to pay an 
above-equilibrium wage to attract a better mix of workers.
A third example of adverse selection occurs in markets for insurance. For 
­example, buyers of health insurance know more about their own health prob-
lems than do insurance companies. Because people with greater hidden health 
problems are more likely to buy health insurance than are other people, the price 
of health insurance reflects the costs of a sicker-than-average person. As a result, 
people in average health may observe the high price of insurance and decide not 
to buy it.
When markets suffer from adverse selection, the invisible hand does not neces-
sarily work its magic. In the used car market, owners of good cars may choose to 
keep them rather than sell them at the low price that skeptical buyers are willing 
to pay. In the labor market, wages may be stuck above the level that balances sup-
ply and demand, resulting in unemployment. In insurance markets, buyers with 
low risk may choose to remain uninsured because the policies they are ­offered 
fail to reflect their true characteristics. Advocates of government-provided health 
insurance sometimes point to the problem of adverse selection as one reason not 
to trust the private market to provide the right amount of health insurance on 
its own.

22-1c Signaling to Convey Private Information
Although asymmetric information is sometimes a motivation for public policy, it 
also motivates some individual behavior that otherwise might be hard to explain. 
Markets respond to problems of asymmetric information in many ways. One of 
them is signaling, which refers to actions taken by an informed party for the sole 
purpose of credibly revealing his private information.
We have seen examples of signaling in previous chapters. As we saw in 
­Chapter 16, firms may spend money on advertising to signal to potential custom-
ers that they have high-quality products. As we saw in Chapter 20, students may 
earn college degrees merely to signal to potential employers that they are high-
ability individuals, rather than to increase their productivity. These two ­examples 
of signaling (advertising, education) may seem very different, but ­below the 
surface, they are much the same: In both cases, the informed party (the firm, 
the student) uses the signal to convince the uninformed party (the customer, the 
­employer) that the informed party is offering something of high quality.
What does it take for an action to be an effective signal? Obviously, it must 
be costly. If a signal were free, everyone would use it and it would convey no 
information. For the same reason, there is another requirement: The signal must 
be less costly, or more beneficial, to the person with the higher-quality product. 
­Otherwise, everyone would have the same incentive to use the signal and the sig-
nal would reveal nothing.
Consider again our two examples. In the advertising case, a firm with a good 
product reaps a larger benefit from advertising because customers who try the 
product once are more likely to become repeat customers. Thus, it is rational for 
the firm with a good product to pay for the cost of the signal (advertising), and it 
is rational for the customer to use the signal as a piece of information about the 
product’s quality. In the education case, a talented person can get through school 
more easily than a less talented one. Thus, it is rational for the talented person to 
pay for the cost of the signal (education), and it is rational for the employer to use 
the signal as a piece of information about the person’s talent.
The world is replete with instances of signaling. Magazine ads sometimes 
­include the phrase “as seen on TV.” Why does a firm selling a product in a maga-
zine choose to stress this fact? One possibility is that the firm is trying to convey 
its willingness to pay for an expensive signal (a spot on television) in the hope 
that you will infer that its product is of high quality. For the same reason, gradu-
ates of elite schools are always sure to put that fact on their résumés.

Gifts as Signals
A man is debating what to give his girlfriend for her birthday. 
“I know,” he says to himself, “I’ll give her cash. After all, I don’t know her 
tastes as well as she does, and with cash, she can buy anything she wants.” 
But when he hands her the money, she is offended. Convinced he doesn’t really 
love her, she breaks off the relationship.
What’s the economics behind this story?
In some ways, gift giving is a strange custom. As the man in our story suggests, 
people typically know their own preferences better than others do, so we might 
expect everyone to prefer cash to in-kind transfers. If your employer substituted 
merchandise of his choosing for your paycheck, you would likely object to this 
case

22-1d Screening to Uncover Private Information
When an informed party takes actions to reveal private information, the phenom-
enon is called signaling. When an uninformed party takes actions to induce the 
­informed party to reveal private information, the phenomenon is called screening.
Some screening is common sense. A person buying a used car may ask that it 
be checked by an auto mechanic before the sale. A seller who refuses this request 
reveals his private information that the car is a lemon. The buyer may decide to 
offer a lower price or to look for another car.
Other examples of screening are more subtle. For example, consider a firm that 
sells car insurance. The firm would like to charge a low premium to safe drivers 
and a high premium to risky drivers. But how can it tell them apart? Drivers know 
whether they are safe or risky, but the risky ones won’t admit it. A driver’s history is 
one piece of information (which insurance companies in fact use), but because of the 
intrinsic randomness of car accidents, history is an imperfect indicator of future risk.
The insurance company might be able to sort out the two kinds of drivers by 
offering different insurance policies that would induce the drivers to separate 
themselves. One policy would have a high premium and cover the full cost of 
any accidents that occur. Another policy would have low premiums but would 
have, say, a $1,000 deductible. (That is, the driver would be responsible for the 
first $1,000 of damage, and the insurance company would cover the remaining 
risk.) Notice that the deductible is more of a burden for risky drivers because they 
are more likely to have an accident. Thus, with a large enough deductible, the 
low-premium policy with a deductible would attract the safe drivers, while the 
high-premium policy without a deductible would attract the risky drivers. Faced 
with these two policies, the two kinds of drivers would reveal their private infor-
mation by choosing different insurance policies.
22-1e Asymmetric Information and Public Policy
We have examined two kinds of asymmetric information: moral hazard and 
­adverse selection. And we have seen how individuals may respond to the prob-
lem with signaling or screening. Now let’s consider what the study of asymmetric 
­information suggests about the proper scope of public policy.
means of payment. But your reaction is very different when someone who (you 
hope) loves you does the same thing.
One interpretation of gift giving is that it reflects asymmetric information and 
signaling. The man in our story has private information that the girlfriend would 
like to know: Does he really love her? Choosing a good gift for her is a signal of 
his love. Certainly, the act of picking out a gift, rather than giving cash, has the 
right characteristics to be a signal. It is costly (it takes time), and its cost depends 
on private information (how much he loves her). If he really loves her, choosing 
a good gift is easy because he is thinking about her all the time. If he doesn’t love 
her, finding the right gift is more difficult. Thus, giving a gift that suits the girl-
friend is one way for him to convey the private information of his love for her. 
Giving cash shows that he isn’t even bothering to try.
The signaling theory of gift giving is consistent with another observation: 
­People care most about the custom when the strength of affection is most in 
question. Thus, giving cash to a girlfriend or boyfriend is usually a bad move. 
But when college students receive a check from their parents, they are less often 
­offended. The parents’ love is less likely to be in doubt, so the recipient probably 
won’t interpret the cash gift as a signal of lack of affection. 
“Now we’ll see how 
much he loves me.”

CHAPTER 22  FRONTIERS OF MICROECONOMICS
467
The tension between market success and market failure is central in microeco-
nomics. We learned in Chapter 7 that the equilibrium of supply and demand is 
efficient in the sense that it maximizes the total surplus that society can obtain 
in a market. Adam Smith’s invisible hand seemed to reign supreme. This con-
clusion was then tempered with the study of externalities (Chapter 10), public 
goods (Chapter 11), imperfect competition (Chapters 15 through 17), and poverty 
(Chapter 20). In those chapters, we saw that government can sometimes improve 
market outcomes.
The study of asymmetric information gives us a new reason to be wary of 
markets. When some people know more than others, the market may fail to put 
­resources to their best use. People with high-quality used cars may have trou-
ble selling them because buyers will be afraid of getting a lemon. People with 
few health problems may have trouble getting low-cost health insurance because 
­insurance companies lump them together with those who have significant (but 
hidden) health problems.
Asymmetric information may call for government action in some cases, but 
three facts complicate the issue. First, as we have seen, the private market can 
sometimes deal with information asymmetries on its own using a combination 
of signaling and screening. Second, the government rarely has more information 
than the private parties. Even if the market’s allocation of resources is not ideal, it 
may be the best that can be achieved. That is, when there are information asym-
metries, policymakers may find it hard to improve upon the market’s admittedly 
imperfect outcome. Third, the government is itself an imperfect institution—a 
topic we take up in the next section.
22-2 Political Economy
Quick Quiz  A person who buys a life insurance policy pays a certain amount per year 
and receives for his family a much larger payment in the event of his death. Would you 
­expect buyers of life insurance to have higher or lower death rates than the average person? 
How might this be an example of moral hazard? Of adverse selection? How might a life 
­insurance company deal with these problems?
As we have seen, markets left on their own do not always reach a ­desirable 
­allocation of resources. When we judge the market’s outcome to be either 
­inefficient or inequitable, there may be a role for the government to step in and 
­improve the situation. Yet before we embrace an activist government, we need to 
consider one more fact: The government is also an imperfect institution. The field 
of political economy (sometimes called the field of public choice) uses the methods 
of economics to study how government works.
22-2a The Condorcet Voting Paradox
Most advanced societies rely on democratic principles to set government policy. 
When a city is deciding between two locations to build a new park, for example, 
we have a simple way to choose: The majority gets its way. Yet for most policy 
issues, the number of possible outcomes far exceeds two. A new park could be 
placed in many possible locations. In this case, as the 18th-century French ­political 
theorist Marquis de Condorcet famously noted, democracy might run into some 
problems trying to choose the best outcome.

For example, suppose there are three possible outcomes, labeled A, B, and C, 
and there are three voter types with the preferences shown in Table 1. The mayor 
of our town wants to aggregate these individual preferences into preferences for 
society as a whole. How should he do it?
At first, he might try some pairwise votes. If he asks voters to choose first 
­between B and C, voter types 1 and 2 will vote for B, giving B the majority. If he 
then asks voters to choose between A and B, voter types 1 and 3 will vote for A, 
giving A the majority. Observing that A beats B, and B beats C, the mayor might 
conclude that A is the voters’ clear choice.
But wait: Suppose the mayor then asks voters to choose between A and C. In 
this case, voter types 2 and 3 vote for C, giving C the majority. That is, under 
­pairwise majority voting, A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A. Normally, we ­expect 
preferences to exhibit a property called transitivity: If A is preferred to B, and B 
is preferred to C, then we would expect A to be preferred to C. The Condorcet 
­paradox is that democratic outcomes do not always obey this property. Pairwise 
voting might produce transitive preferences for society in some cases, but as our 
example in the table shows, it cannot be counted on to do so.
One implication of the Condorcet paradox is that the order in which things are 
voted on can affect the result. If the mayor suggests choosing first between A and 
B and then comparing the winner to C, the town ends up choosing C. But if the 
voters choose first between B and C and then compare the winner to A, the town 
ends up with A. And if the voters choose first between A and C and then compare 
the winner to B, the town ends up with B.
The Condorcet paradox teaches two lessons. The narrow lesson is that when 
there are more than two options, setting the agenda (that is, deciding the order in 
which items are voted on) can have a powerful influence over the outcome of a 
democratic election. The broad lesson is that majority voting by itself does not tell 
us what outcome a society really wants.
22-2b Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem
Since political theorists first noticed Condorcet’s paradox, they have spent much 
energy studying existing voting systems and proposing new ones. For example, 
as an alternative to pairwise majority voting, the mayor of our town could ask 
each voter to rank the possible outcomes. For each voter, we could give 1 point 
for last place, 2 points for second to last, 3 points for third to last, and so on. The 
outcome that receives the most total points wins. With the preferences in Table 1, 
outcome B is the winner. (You can do the arithmetic yourself.) This voting method

is called a Borda count for the 18th-century French mathematician and political 
theorist who devised it. It is often used in polls that rank sports teams.
Is there a perfect voting system? Economist Kenneth Arrow took up this ques-
tion in his 1951 book Social Choice and Individual Values. Arrow started by defining 
what a perfect voting system would be. He assumes that individuals in society 
have preferences over the various possible outcomes: A, B, C, and so on. He then 
assumes that society wants a voting system to choose among these outcomes that 
satisfies several properties:
•	 Unanimity: If everyone prefers A to B, then A should beat B.
•	 Transitivity: If A beats B, and B beats C, then A should beat C.
•	 Independence of irrelevant alternatives: The ranking between any two ­outcomes 
A and B should not depend on whether some third outcome C is also available.
•	 No dictators: There is no person who always gets his way, regardless of 
­everyone else’s preferences.
These all seem like desirable properties of a voting system. Yet Arrow proved, 
mathematically and incontrovertibly, that no voting system can satisfy all these prop-
erties. This amazing result is called Arrow’s impossibility theorem. 
The mathematics needed to prove Arrow’s theorem is beyond the scope of this 
book, but we can get some sense of why the theorem is true from a couple of 
examples. We have already seen the problem with the method of majority rule. 
The Condorcet paradox shows that majority rule fails to produce a ranking of out-
comes that always satisfies transitivity.
As another example, the Borda count fails to satisfy the independence of 
­irrelevant alternatives. Recall that, using the preferences in Table 1, outcome B wins 
with a Borda count. But suppose that suddenly C disappears as an alternative. 
If the Borda count method is applied only to outcomes A and B, then A wins. (Once 
again, you can do the arithmetic on your own.) Thus, eliminating ­alternative C 
changes the ranking between A and B. This change occurs because the result of the 
Borda count depends on the number of points that A and B ­receive, and the num-
ber of points depends on whether the irrelevant alternative, C, is also available.
Arrow’s impossibility theorem is a deep and disturbing result. It doesn’t say 
that we should abandon democracy as a form of government. But it does say that 
no matter what voting system society adopts for aggregating the preferences of its 
members, it will in some way be flawed as a mechanism for social choice.
22-2c The Median Voter Is King
Despite Arrow’s theorem, voting is how most societies choose their leaders and 
public policies, often by majority rule. The next step in studying government is 
to examine how governments run by majority rule work. That is, in a democratic 
­society, who determines what policy is chosen? In some cases, the theory of dem-
ocratic government yields a surprisingly simple answer.
Let’s consider an example. Imagine that society is deciding how much money 
to spend on some public good, such as the army or the national parks. Each voter 
has his own most preferred budget, and he always prefers outcomes closer to his 
most ­preferred value to outcomes farther away. Thus, we can line up voters from 
those who prefer the smallest budget to those who prefer the largest. Figure 1 is 
an ­example. Here there are 100 voters, and the budget size varies from zero to 
$20 billion. Given these preferences, what outcome would you expect democracy 
to produce?

According to a famous result called the median voter theorem, majority rule 
will produce the outcome most preferred by the median voter. The median voter is 
the voter exactly in the middle of the distribution. In this example, if you take the 
line of voters ordered by their preferred budgets and count 50 voters from either 
end of the line, you will find that the median voter wants a budget of $10 billion. 
By contrast, the average preferred outcome (calculated by adding the preferred 
outcomes and dividing by the number of voters) is $9 billion, and the modal out-
come (the one preferred by the greatest number of voters) is $15 billion.
The median voter rules the day because his preferred outcome beats any other 
proposal in a two-way race. In our example, more than half the voters want  
$10 billion or more, and more than half want $10 billion or less. If someone proposes,  
say, $8 billion instead of $10 billion, everyone who prefers $10 billion or more 
will vote with the median voter. Similarly, if someone proposes $12 billion instead 
of $10 billion, everyone who wants $10 billion or less will vote with the median 
voter. In either case, the median voter has more than half the voters on his side.
What about the Condorcet voting paradox? It turns out that when the voters 
are picking a point along a line and each voter aims for his own most preferred 
point, the Condorcet paradox cannot arise. The median voter’s most preferred 
outcome beats all challengers.
One implication of the median voter theorem is that if two political parties 
are each trying to maximize their chance of election, they will both move their 
positions toward the median voter. Suppose, for example, that the Democratic 
Party advocates a budget of $15 billion, while the Republican Party advocates a 
budget of $10 billion. The Democratic position is more popular in the sense that 
$15 ­billion has more proponents than any other single choice. Nonetheless, the 
Republicans get more than 50 percent of the vote: They will attract the 20 vot-
ers who want $10 billion, the 15 voters who want $5 billion, and the 25 voters 
who want zero. If the Democrats want to win, they will move their platform 
toward the median voter. Thus, this theory can explain why the parties in a 
two-party system are similar to each other: They are both moving toward the 
median voter.

Another implication of the median voter theorem is that minority views are 
not given much weight. Imagine that 40 percent of the population want a lot of 
money spent on the national parks and 60 percent want nothing spent. In this 
case, the median voter’s preference is zero, regardless of the intensity of the 
­minority’s view. Such is the logic of democracy. Rather than reaching a compro-
mise that takes into account everyone’s preferences, majority rule looks only to 
the person in the exact middle of the distribution.
22-2d Politicians Are People Too
When economists study consumer behavior, they assume that consumers buy the 
bundle of goods and services that gives them the greatest level of satisfaction. 
When economists study firm behavior, they assume that firms produce the quan-
tity of goods and services that yields the greatest level of profits. What should 
they assume when they study people involved in the practice of politics?
Politicians also have objectives. It would be nice to assume that political lead-
ers are always looking out for the well-being of society as a whole, that they are 
aiming for an optimal combination of efficiency and equality. Nice, perhaps, but 
not realistic. Self-interest is as powerful a motive for political actors as it is for con-
sumers and firm owners. Some politicians, motivated by a desire for reelection, 
are willing to sacrifice the national interest to solidify their base of voters. Others 
are motivated by simple greed. If you have any doubt, you should look at the 
world’s poor nations, where corruption among government officials is a common 
impediment to economic development.
This book is not the place to develop a theory of political behavior. But when 
thinking about economic policy, remember that this policy is made not by a 
­benevolent king (or even by benevolent economists) but by real people with their 
own all-too-human desires. Sometimes they are motivated to further the national 
interest, but sometimes they are motivated by their own political and financial 
ambitions. We shouldn’t be surprised when economic policy fails to resemble the 
ideals derived in economics textbooks.

22-3 Behavioral Economics
Economics is a study of human behavior, but it is not the only field that can make 
that claim. The social science of psychology also sheds light on the choices that 
people make in their lives. The fields of economics and psychology usually pro-
ceed independently, in part because they address a different range of questions. 
But recently, a field called behavioral economics has emerged in which econo-
mists are making use of basic psychological insights. Let’s consider some of these 
insights here.
22-3a People Aren’t Always Rational
Economic theory is populated by a particular species of organism, sometimes 
called Homo economicus. Members of this species are always rational. As firm own-
ers, they maximize profits. As consumers, they maximize utility (or equivalently,

pick the point on the highest indifference curve). Given the constraints they face, 
they rationally weigh all the costs and benefits and always choose the best pos-
sible course of action.
Real people, however, are Homo sapiens. Although in many ways they resemble 
the rational, calculating people assumed in economic theory, they are far more 
complex. They can be forgetful, impulsive, confused, emotional, and shortsighted. 
These imperfections of human reasoning are the bread and butter of psycholo-
gists, but until recently, economists have neglected them.
Herbert Simon, one of the first social scientists to work at the boundary of 
­economics and psychology, suggested that humans should be viewed not as 
­rational maximizers but as satisficers. Rather than always choosing the best course 
of ­action, they make decisions that are merely good enough. Similarly, other econ-
omists have suggested that humans are only “near rational” or that they exhibit 
“bounded rationality.”
Studies of human decision making have tried to detect systematic mistakes 
that people make. Here are a few of the findings:
•	 People are overconfident. Imagine that you were asked some numerical ques-
tions, such as the number of African countries in the United Nations, the 
height of the tallest mountain in North America, and so on. Instead of being 
asked for a single estimate, however, you were asked to give a 90 percent 
confidence interval—a range such that you were 90 percent confident the true 
number falls within it. When psychologists run experiments like this, they find 
that most people give ranges that are too small: The true number falls within 
their intervals far less than 90 percent of the time. That is, most people are too 
sure of their own abilities.
•	 People give too much weight to a small number of vivid observations. Imagine that 
you are thinking about buying a car of brand X. To learn about its reliability, 
you read Consumer Reports, which has surveyed 1,000 owners of car X. 
Then you run into a friend who owns car X, and he tells you that his car is a 
lemon. How do you treat your friend’s observation? If you think rationally, 
you will realize that he has only increased your sample size from 1,000 to 
1,001, which does not provide much new information. But because your 
friend’s story is so vivid, you may be tempted to give it more weight in your 
decision making than you should.
•	 People are reluctant to change their minds. People tend to interpret evidence to 
confirm beliefs they already hold. In one study, subjects were asked to read 
and evaluate a research report on whether capital punishment deters crime. 
After reading the report, those who initially favored the death penalty said 
they were surer in their view, and those who initially opposed the death 
­penalty also said they were surer in their view. The two groups interpreted 
the same evidence in exactly opposite ways.
Think about decisions you have made in your own life. Do you exhibit some of 
these traits?
A hotly debated issue is whether deviations from rationality are important for 
understanding economic phenomena. An intriguing example arises in the study 
of 401(k) plans, the tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts that some firms 
offer their workers. In some firms, workers can choose to participate in the plan 
by filling out a simple form. In other firms, workers are automatically enrolled

and can opt out of the plan by filling out a simple form. It turns out many more 
workers participate in the second case than in the first. If workers were perfectly 
rational maximizers, they would choose the optimal amount of retirement sav-
ing, regardless of the default offered by their employer. In fact, workers’ behavior 
appears to exhibit substantial inertia. Understanding their behavior seems easier 
once we abandon the model of rational man.
Why, you might ask, is economics built on the rationality assumption when 
psychology and common sense cast doubt on it? One answer is that the assump-
tion, even if not exactly true, may be true enough that it yields reasonably ­accurate 
models of behavior. For example, when we studied the differences between com-
petitive and monopoly firms, the assumption that firms rationally maximize profit 
yielded many important and valid insights. Incorporating complex psychological 
deviations from rationality into the story might have added realism, but it also 
would have muddied the waters and made those insights harder to find. ­Recall 
from Chapter 2 that economic models are not meant to replicate reality but are 
supposed to show the essence of the problem at hand as an aid to understanding.
Another reason economists so often assume rationality may be that economists 
are themselves not rational maximizers. Like most people, they are overconfident 
and they are reluctant to change their minds. Their choice among alternative theo-
ries of human behavior may exhibit excessive inertia. Moreover, economists may 
be content with a theory that is not perfect but is good enough. The model of 
­rational man may be the theory of choice for a satisficing social scientist.
Left-Digit Bias
You may have noticed that prices often end in .99. In some ways, 
this phenomenon is odd. Why charge $4.99, instead of an even $5.00? If 
people were truly rational, sellers wouldn’t have a good reason to focus on 
prices ending in .99. But in fact, it turns out that sellers are smart for using this 
approach to pricing. Various studies suggest that buyers are excessively sensitive 
to a price’s left-most digit. Even though $4.99 is only one penny less than $5.00, 
buyers may not perceive it that way. Because adding the extra penny changes the 
left-most digit from a 4 to a 5, the change may exert a surprisingly large impact on 
consumer behavior. An irrational focus on the left-most digit is called left-digit bias.
In one study, participants were given the choice of buying two different pens, a 
cheap one and a better, more expensive one. When the pens were priced at $2.00 
and $3.99, 44 percent bought the higher-priced pen. When the prices were $1.99 
and $4.00, only 18 percent bought the more expensive one. Such a large change in 
behavior in response to such tiny changes in the prices seems hard to square with 
standard models of rationality. But it is easier to understand if one imagines a 
consumer that focuses excessively on the left-most digit. To such a consumer, the 
prices would look like $2 and $3 in the first scenario and $1 and $4 in the second, 
and so the changes from the first to the second scenario would appear larger than 
they really are.
Another study of left-digit bias examined how the number of miles on a used 
car’s odometer affected the price at which the car sold. The study examined data 
on millions of used cars sold at auction. Not surprisingly, cars that had been 
driven more miles sold for less. But the effect was not smooth. For example, when 
the odometer reading increased from 78,000 to 79,000 (leaving the left-most digit 
the same), the price of the car fell by about $10. But when the odometer reading

22-3b People Care about Fairness
Another insight about human behavior is best illustrated with an experiment 
called the ultimatum game. The game works like this: Two volunteers (who are 
otherwise strangers to each other) are told that they are going to play a game and 
could win a total of $100. Before they play, they learn the rules. The game begins 
with a coin toss, which is used to assign the volunteers to the roles of player A and 
player B. Player A’s job is to propose a division of the $100 prize between himself 
and the other player. After player A makes his proposal, player B decides whether 
to accept or reject it. If he accepts it, both players are paid according to the pro-
posal. If player B rejects the proposal, both players walk away with nothing. In 
either case, the game then ends.
Before proceeding, stop and think about what you would do in this situation. 
If you were player A, what division of the $100 would you propose? If you were 
player B, what proposals would you accept?
Conventional economic theory assumes in this situation that people are ratio-
nal wealth maximizers. This assumption leads to a simple prediction: Player A 
should propose that he gets $99 and player B gets $1, and player B should accept 
the proposal. After all, once the proposal is made, player B is better off accepting 
it as long as he gets something out of it. Moreover, because player A knows that 
accepting the proposal is in player B’s interest, player A has no reason to offer him 
more than $1. In the language of game theory (discussed in Chapter 17), the 99–1 
split is the Nash equilibrium.
Yet when experimental economists ask real people to play the ultimatum 
game, the results differ from this prediction. People in player B’s role usually 
­reject proposals that give them only $1 or a similarly small amount. Anticipating 
this, ­people in the role of player A usually propose giving player B much more 
than $1. Some people will offer a 50−50 split, but it is more common for player A 
to propose giving player B an amount such as $30 or $40, keeping the larger share 
for himself. In this case, player B usually accepts the proposal.
What’s going on here? The natural interpretation is that people are driven in 
part by some innate sense of fairness. A 99−1 split seems so wildly unfair to many 
people that they reject it, even to their own detriment. By contrast, a 70−30 split 
is still unfair, but it is not so unfair that it induces people to abandon their normal 
self-interest.
Throughout our study of household and firm behavior, the innate sense of fair-
ness has not played any role. But the results of the ultimatum game suggest that 
perhaps it should. For example, in Chapters 18 and 19, we discussed how wages 
were determined by labor supply and labor demand. Some economists have sug-
gested that the perceived fairness of what a firm pays its workers should also 
enter the picture. Thus, when a firm has an especially profitable year, workers 
(like player B) may expect to be paid a fair share of the prize, even if the standard 
equilibrium does not dictate it. The firm (like player A) might well decide to give 
increased from 79,000 to 80,000 (increasing the left-most digit), the price fell by 
$210. The prices of used cars jumped down at every 10,000 mile mark, when the 
left-most digit on the odometer changed.
When looking at either prices or odometers, buyers seem to be irrationally 
­influenced by the left-most digit.

workers more than the equilibrium wage for fear that the workers might other-

22-3c People Are Inconsistent over Time
Imagine some dreary task, such as doing your laundry, shoveling snow off your 
driveway, or filling out your income tax forms. Now consider the following 
questions:
1.	 Would you prefer (A) to spend 50 minutes doing the task right now or (B) to 
spend 60 minutes doing the task tomorrow?
2.	 Would you prefer (A) to spend 50 minutes doing the task in 90 days or (B) to 
spend 60 minutes doing the task in 91 days?
When asked questions like these, many people choose B for question 1 and A for 
question 2. When looking ahead to the future (as in question 2), they minimize 
the amount of time spent on the dreary task. But faced with the prospect of doing 
the task immediately (as in question 1), they choose to put it off.
In some ways, this behavior is not surprising: Everyone procrastinates from 
time to time. But from the standpoint of the theory of rational man, it is puzzling. 
Suppose that in response to question 2, a person chooses to spend 50 minutes in 
90 days. Then, when the 90th day arrives, we allow him to change his mind. In 
­effect, he then faces question 1, so he opts for doing the task the next day. But why 
should the mere passage of time affect the choices he makes?
Many times in life, people make plans for themselves, but then they fail to fol-
low through. A smoker promises himself that he will quit, but within a few hours 
of smoking his last cigarette, he craves another and breaks his promise. A per-
son trying to lose weight promises that he will stop eating dessert, but when the 
waiter brings the dessert cart, the promise is forgotten. In both cases, the desire 
for instant gratification induces the decision maker to abandon his past plans.
Some economists believe that the consumption–saving decision is an impor-
tant instance in which people exhibit this inconsistency over time. For many peo-
ple, spending provides a type of instant gratification. Saving, like passing up the 
cigarette or the dessert, requires a sacrifice in the present for a reward in the dis-
tant future. And just as many smokers wish they could quit and many overweight 
individuals wish they ate less, many consumers wish they saved more of their 
income. According to one survey, 76 percent of Americans said they were not sav-
ing enough for retirement.
An implication of this inconsistency over time is that people should try to find 
ways to commit their future selves to following through on their plans. A smoker 
trying to quit may throw away his cigarettes, and a person on a diet may put a 
lock on the refrigerator. What can a person who saves too little do? He should find 
some way to lock up his money before he spends it. Some retirement accounts, 
such as 401(k) plans, do exactly that. A worker can agree to have some money 
taken out of his paycheck before he ever sees it. The money is deposited in an 
­account that can be used before retirement only with a penalty. Perhaps that is one 
reason these retirement accounts are so popular: They protect people from their 
own desires for instant gratification.

that of the rational individual of conventional economic theory.

Can Brain Science 
­Improve Economics?
Some scholars believe that studying the biology of the brain may  
improve our understanding of economic behavior.
In the News
The Neuroeconomics 
Revolution
By Robert J.Shiller
E
conomics is at the start of a revolution 
that is traceable to an unexpected source: 
medical schools and their research facilities. 
Neuroscience—the science of how the brain, 
that physical organ inside one’s head, really 
works—is beginning to change the way we 
think about how people make decisions. These 
findings will inevitably change the way we 
think about how economies function. In short, 
we are at the dawn of “neuroeconomics.”
Efforts to link neuroscience to econom-
ics have occurred mostly in just the last few 
years, and the growth of neuroeconomics is 
still in its early stages. But its nascence fol-
lows a pattern: revolutions in science tend to 
come from completely unexpected places. A 
field of science can turn barren if no funda-
mentally new approaches to research are on 
the horizon. Scholars can become so trapped 
in their methods—in the language and as-
sumptions of the accepted approach to their 
discipline—that their research becomes re-
petitive or trivial.
Then something exciting comes along 
from someone who was never involved with 
these methods—some new idea that attracts 
young scholars and a few iconoclastic old 
scholars, who are willing to learn a different 
science and its different research methods. At 
a certain moment in this process, a scientific 
revolution is born.
The neuroeconomic revolution has passed 
some key milestones quite recently, nota-
bly the publication last year of neurosci-
entist Paul Glimcher’s book Foundations of 
­Neuroeconomic Analysis—a pointed variation 
on the title of Paul Samuelson’s 1947 clas-
sic work, Foundations of Economic Analysis, 
which helped to launch an earlier revolution 
in economic theory. And Glimcher himself now 
holds an appointment at New York Universi-
ty’s economics department (he also works at 
NYU’s Center for Neural Science).
To most economists, however, Glimcher 
might as well have come from outer space. 
After all, his doctorate is from the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania School of Medicine’s 
neuroscience department. Moreover, neuro-
economists like him conduct research that 
is well beyond their conventional colleagues’ 
intellectual comfort zone, for they seek to ad-
vance some of the core concepts of economics 
by linking them to specific brain structures.
Much of modern economic and finan-
cial theory is based on the assumption that 
people are rational, and thus that they sys-
tematically maximize their own happiness, 
or as economists call it, their “utility.” When 
Samuelson took on the subject in his 1947 
book, he did not look into the brain, but relied 
instead on “revealed preference.” People’s 
objectives are revealed only by observing their 
economic activities. Under Samuelson’s guid-
ance, generations of economists have based 
their research not on any physical structure 
underlying thought and behavior, but only on 
the assumption of rationality.
As a result, Glimcher is skeptical of pre-
vailing economic theory, and is seeking a 
physical basis for it in the brain. He wants 
22-4 Conclusion
This chapter has examined the frontier of microeconomics. You may have noticed 
that we have sketched out ideas rather than fully developing them. This is no ac-
cident. One reason is that you might study these topics in more detail in advanced 
courses. Another reason is that these topics remain active areas of research and, 
therefore, are still being fleshed out.
To see how these topics fit into the broader picture, recall the Ten Principles of 
Economics from Chapter 1. One principle states that markets are usually a good 
way to organize economic activity. Another principle states that governments can 
sometimes improve market outcomes. As you study economics, you can more

to transform “soft” utility theory into “hard” 
utility theory by discovering the brain mecha-
nisms that underlie it.
In particular, Glimcher wants to identify 
brain structures that process key elements 
of utility theory when people face uncertainty: 
“(1) subjective value, (2) probability, (3) the 
product of subjective value and probability 
(expected subjective value), and (4) a neuro-
computational mechanism that selects the 
element from the choice set that has the 
highest ‘expected subjective value’. . . .”
While Glimcher and his colleagues have 
uncovered tantalizing evidence, they have yet 
to find most of the fundamental brain struc-
tures. Maybe that is because such structures 
simply do not exist, and the whole utility-
maximization theory is wrong, or at least 
in need of fundamental revision. If so, that 
finding alone would shake economics to its 
foundations.
Another direction that excites neuroscien-
tists is how the brain deals with ambiguous 
situations, when probabilities are not known, 
and when other highly relevant information is 
not available. It has already been discovered 
that the brain regions used to deal with prob-
lems when probabilities are clear are different 
from those used when probabilities are un-
known. This research might help us to under-
stand how people handle uncertainty and risk 
in, say, financial markets at a time of crisis.
John Maynard Keynes thought that most 
economic decision-making occurs in ambigu-
ous situations in which probabilities are not 
known. He concluded that much of our busi-
ness cycle is driven by fluctuations in “ani-
mal spirits,” something in the mind—and 
not understood by economists.
Of course, the problem with economics is 
that there are often as many interpretations of 
any crisis as there are economists. An economy 
is a remarkably complex structure, and fath-
oming it depends on understanding its laws, 
regulations, business practices and customs, 
and balance sheets, among many other  
details.
Yet it is likely that one day we will know 
much more about how economies work —or fail 
to work—by under-
standing better the 
physical structures 
that underlie brain 
functioning. Those 
structures—­networks 
of neurons that com-
municate with each 
other via axons and 
dendrites—­underlie 
the familiar anal-
ogy of the brain to a 
­computer—­networks 
of transistors that 
communicate with each other via electric 
wires. The economy is the next analogy: a net-
work of people who communicate with each 
other via electronic and other connections.
The brain, the computer, and the economy: 
all three are devices whose purpose is to solve 
fundamental information problems in coordi-
nating the activities of individual units—the 
neurons, the transistors, or individual people. 
As we improve our understanding of the prob-
lems that any one of these devices solves—and 
how it overcomes obstacles in doing so—we 
learn something valuable about all three.
Mr. Shiller is an economics professor at 
Yale University.

fully appreciate the truth of these principles as well as the caveats that go with 
them. The study of asymmetric information should make you more wary of mar-
ket outcomes. The study of political economy should make you more wary of 
government solutions. And the study of behavioral economics should make you 
wary of any institution that relies on human decision making, including both the 
market and the government.
If there is a unifying theme to these topics, it is that life is messy. Information 
is imperfect, government is imperfect, and people are imperfect. Of course, you 
knew this long before you started studying economics, but economists need to 
understand these imperfections as precisely as they can if they are to explain, and 
perhaps even improve, the world around them.

Quick Check Multiple Choice
•	
In many economic transactions, information is asym-
metric. When there are hidden actions, principals may 
be concerned that agents suffer from the problem of 
moral hazard. When there are hidden characteris-
tics, buyers may be concerned about the problem of 
adverse selection among the sellers. Private markets 
sometimes deal with asymmetric information with sig-
naling and screening.
•	
Although government policy can sometimes improve 
market outcomes, governments are themselves imper-
fect institutions. The Condorcet paradox shows that 
majority rule fails to produce transitive preferences for 
society, and Arrow’s impossibility theorem shows that 
no voting system will be perfect. In many situations, 
democratic institutions will produce the outcome 
­desired by the median voter, regardless of the prefer-
ences of the rest of the electorate. Moreover, the indi-
viduals who set government policy may be motivated 
by self-interest rather than the national interest.
•	
The study of psychology and economics reveals that 
human decision making is more complex than is 
­assumed in conventional economic theory. People are 
not always rational, they care about the fairness of 
­economic outcomes (even to their own detriment), and 
they can be inconsistent over time.

  8.	 Five roommates are planning to spend the weekend 
in their dorm room watching movies, and they are 
debating how many movies to watch. Here is their 
willingness to pay:

Buying a DVD costs $15, which the roommates split 
equally, so each pays $3 per movie.
a.	 What is the efficient number of movies to watch 
(that is, the number that maximizes total surplus)?
b.	 From the standpoint of each roommate, what is the 
preferred number of movies?
c.	 What is the preference of the median roommate?
d.	 If the roommates held a vote on the efficient out-
come versus the median voter’s preference, how 
would each person vote? Which outcome would 
get a majority?
e.	 If one of the roommates proposed a different 
­number of movies, could his proposal beat the 
­winner from part (d) in a vote?
f.	 Can majority rule be counted on to reach efficient 
outcomes in the provision of public goods?
  9.	 Two ice-cream stands are deciding where to set 
up along a 1-mile beach. The people are uniformly 
­located along the beach, and each person sitting on 
the beach buys exactly 1 ice-cream cone per day from 
the nearest stand. Each ice-cream seller wants the 
­maximum number of customers. Where along the 
beach will the two stands locate? Of which result in 
this chapter does this outcome remind you?
10.	 The government is considering two ways to help the 
needy: giving them cash or giving them free meals at 
soup kitchens.
a.	 Give an argument, based on the standard theory of 
the rational consumer, for giving cash.
b.	 Give an argument, based on asymmetric informa-
tion, for why the soup kitchen may be better than 
the cash handout.
c.	 Give an argument, based on behavioral economics, 
for why the soup kitchen may be better than the 
cash handout.
