Photoshop Elements 4 Just the Steps For Dummies

W
elcome to Adobe Photoshop Elements 4. This new version of
Photoshop Elements has an abundant number of tools and com-
mands to satisfy all your digital photo editing needs. Whether you’re a
novice, a serious amateur, or a professional photographer, Photoshop
Elements 4 Just the Steps For Dummies has something for you.
About This Book
This book cuts all the fluff out of a computer book and takes you right
to steps to produce an effect, task, or job. The book is not linear.
However, in some cases you might need to move around a little to
understand one concept before moving to another. Each series of steps
is defined with headings to simplify your task of searching for a specific
item and finding similar tasks related to a particular concept. Be certain
to look back at the Table of Contents when you aren’t certain where to
find one task or another.
Whenever you want to get something done with this book, simply fol-
low this method:
1.
Pick the task. Glance over the Table of Contents to find a cate-
gory you want to explore — something like working with layers,
which we cover in Chapter 8.
2.
Find it fast. This is easy because the chapters are designed with
coverage of similar items within each chapter. Look over the head-
ings listed in the Table of Contents to find a specific task within a
given chapter.
3.
Get it done. Mimic each step and look at the accompanying fig-
ures to help you thoroughly understand a given task.
Why You Need This Book
Adobe Photoshop Elements is a true bargain. Although you pay far less
for Elements than its bigger sibling, Photoshop, you acquire a sophisti-
cated program with many complex tools and methods for producing
Conventions used

➟We use the ➪symbol for menu commands. This
tells you to follow the path to select a menu
command. Something like Image➪Resize➪
Image Size instructs you to click the Image
menu, move the cursor down to the Resize com-
mand, and choose Image Size from the Resize
submenu. When you select this particular menu
command, the Image Size dialog box opens.

Introduction

results. The user documentation and help guides don’t suffi-
ciently describe all that you can do with the program. What’s
more, to find a specific solution, you might need to wade
through a lot of text to describe a method you want to use in
your workflow.
This book eliminates background descriptions and detailed
text explanations and takes you directly to a series of steps to
produce precisely what you want to do with a photo. It isn’t a
sit down seven-course meal; it’s more like a fast food restau-
rant that satisfies your appetite for knowledge immediately.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into five parts. The following sections
introduce each one.
Part I: Acquiring and Organizing Images
The first thing you need to know about working in Photoshop
Elements is how to get photos into your computer. This first
section describes acquiring photos from a variety of sources
including digital cameras, digital scanners, mobile phones,
CD/DVD ROMs, and media storage devices. If you have a great
number of photos you copy to your hard drive, you’ll want to
find out all the organization opportunities provided by
Photoshop Elements that we cover in this part.
Part II: Fixing Photos
Just about any photo you acquire from any source requires
you to enhance the images for brightness controls, color bal-
ance, removal of dust and scratches, and other anomalies you
might find. Look to this part to discover the best way to make
image enhancements.
Part III: Editing Techniques
Whether it be applying an effect, merging photos, adding
some text to a photograph, or a host of other edits you want
to apply to your photos, this part covers it all.
Part IV: Outputting Photos
You take a photo with a digital camera, scan a photo on your
scanner, or acquire a photo from another source and make
edits to the photo. When you finish editing an image, the
next logical step is to show the image either on screen or in a
print. This part covers preparing images for screen viewing in
slide shows, on Web browsers, or with other screen viewers.
This part also covers printing your files locally on your own
desktop printer or prepping and sending them to a commer-
cial photo lab printer.
Part V: Working with Creations
Photoshop Elements 4 is really two programs in one package:
The original photo editor that was simply Photoshop Elements
prior to version 3 and the former Adobe Photoshop Album
program. Photoshop Album is fully integrated in Photoshop
Elements 4, where you find tools and commands to help you
create cards, calendars, slide shows, TV videodiscs, and more.
This section covers all the marvelous features for assembling a
number of different creations.
Get Ready To
Glance over the Table of Contents to locate the task you want
to perform in Photoshop Elements. You don’t need to grasp
any background information. Just jump into the series of steps
that defines a solution for a project you want to complete.

Getting Familiar
with Photoshop
Elements
P
hotoshop Elements is like having two programs in the same pack-
age: an image editor and an image organizer. Its many features can
make moving around the program’s workspaces a challenge until you
get familiar with the user interface.
Throughout your work in Photoshop Elements, you will continually
move among the workspaces. For editing your pictures, you can choose
to open one of two editing workspaces. When you want to create proj-
ects and organize photos, you move to another workspace.
This chapter helps you become familiar with moving around the various
workspaces that Elements provides and covers some basic methods for
viewing your pictures in one of Elements’ two editors. By getting a grasp
on how to edit a picture and how to perform one of the organizing
tasks, you will be able to work much faster and more efficiently. This
chapter helps by giving you a solid understanding about how to begin
your work in Photoshop Elements.

Chapter 1: Getting Familiar with Photoshop Elements

Acquiring Photos
You’re likely to acquire pictures from one of three main sources. If
you have a digital camera, you’ll want to open photos that are
stored on a media card. If you have a digital scanner, you’ll want to
scan pictures you get processed at a photo lab. If you receive files from
other users, you’ll want to copy the pictures to your hard drive and
open them. Photoshop Elements supports all three of these methods
for acquiring photos when you’re working in either an editing mode
or the Organizer.
The workspace you use dictates the options you have for acquiring
images. If you work in an editing mode, you can open files in either
editor (Standard Edit or Quick Edit). If you work in the Organizer,
you acquire photos that are added to the Organizer catalog where you
can see thumbnail previews of the acquired images.
This chapter explains how to get your photos from a variety of sources
into Photoshop Elements.

From the Files of Type drop-down list, shown in Figure
2-1, select the file types to import. Your choices include
Media Files (photos, video, audio), PDF Files (*.pdf),
and All Files (photos, video, sound, and PDFs).
You can see a file’s type at a glace in the Organizer window. On an
image thumbnail, a tiny filmstrip icon represents a video file. The
speaker icon indicates a sound file. An Adobe Acrobat PDF icon indi-
cates that the file is a PDF.
5.
Select the Get Photos from Subfolders check box if you
want to add photos in nested folders to the Organizer.
6.
Click Get Photos, and the files are added to a new
Organizer window, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Scan a Photo
1.
Be certain your scanner is properly configured according
to the user guide that shipped with your scanner.
2.
Open the Organizer and choose File➪Get Photos➪From
Scanner. The Get Photos from Scanner dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 2-3.
3.
Select your scanner from the Scanner drop-down list,
and select a file format from the Save As drop-down list.
4.
If you like, select the Automatically Fix Red Eyes check
box and click OK to open your scanner program.
When you click OK and open your scanner, Photoshop Elements is
no longer in control. You scanner program takes on the responsibil-
ity for scanning images, and most likely your scanner program
won’t match Figure 2-4. However, many of the controls discussed
here are typically found on most scanners. 
5.
Select the output dimensions for your scan. Be certain
the width and height are set properly for the desired
output size.
6.
Select a resolution that’s appropriate for your output. 
Generally, choose 72 ppi (pixels per inch) if you want to show the
image on-screen or on the Web. Choose 300 ppi if you’re printing
using a desktop or commercial printer.
7.
Preview the scan. Be certain the entire photo appears
in the preview area. Most scanner programs support 
previewing.

puter has a slot to accommodate your type of media
card. If you have a USB card reader, attach the USB cable
to your computer and card reader and insert your media
card. If you have neither a slot in your computer nor a
card reader, attach a USB cable from your camera to
your computer. (You can use any one of these methods.)
3.
By default, Windows interrupts your procedure for acquir-
ing images in Elements. When the Removable Disk dialog
box appears, as shown in Figure 2-8, click Cancel.
4.
From the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos➪From

and type a base name in the text box. For example, you
might want to change default digital camera files from
names such as IMG_001.jpg, IMG_002.jpg, and
so on to a more descriptive name. You might use an
event, an assignment, or a location for a base name. For
example, if you use a base name such as Egypt,
Elements would name the files Egypt001.jpg,
Egypt002.jpg, and so on.

check box below a thumbnail preview. Elements adds
check marks to all the photos.
10.
Click Get Photos. Elements copies photos to your hard
drive. You can watch the progress in the dialog box
shown in Figure 2-10. Be patient and let Elements copy
all the files.
11.
After copying is complete, the Delete Files on Device
dialog box opens. Click Yes if you want to remove the
copied files from your media storage device. Otherwise,
click No.
If you want to be certain you won’t lose your data, keep the files on
your media card and burn a CD from your desktop. After you copy
the files to a CD, you can delete them from your media card. Later,
after you rename files and organize them on your hard drive in
Elements, you can create a backup CD from within Elements and toss
away the first CD. Because CDs are so inexpensive, a little extra cau-
tion ensures that you won’t lose data due to a hard drive failure.
12.
When Elements finishes copying files, a new Organizer
window opens, showing only the files copied to your
hard drive, as shown in Figure 2-11.

Open Camera Raw Files
1.
Select a file saved in Camera Raw format in the
Organizer window.
Some medium-grade and all the higher-end cameras save files in
both JPEG and Camera Raw. When shooting images with your digi-
tal camera, if you have a choice, use the Camera Raw format, which
most often renders a better image than JPEG format.
If your camera shot both JPEG and Camera Raw and you aren’t sure
which file is the Camera Raw file, open the Properties palette, shown
in Figure 2-11, by choosing Window➪Properties (or press Alt+Enter)
and look at the selected image’s filename. In Figure 2-12, the
.CR2 extension indicates a Camera Raw file.
2.
From the Edit drop-down list on the Shortcuts bar, select
Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode, as shown in Figure 2-12.
The Camera Raw window (an Elements plug-in) opens.
3.
From the White Balance drop-down list, select the appro-
priate setting. For example, if you took the photo in day-
light, select Daylight. A preview of the selected setting
appears in the Camera Raw window, shown in Figure 2-13.

Also in the Camera Raw plug-in window (Figure 2-13),
make other adjustments from the settings controls you
have for Exposure, Shadows, Brightness, Contrast, and
Saturation by moving the slider for each control. As you
adjust each item, the preview shows you the results of
the changes.
5.
Click Open to open the file in the editor you want to
use. When you click Open, the file is processed with the
settings you made in the Camera Raw window.
The advantage of Camera Raw is that it captures and saves all pos-
sible data with the image. So if you shoot an image outdoors, you
can process the image by selecting Shade, Cloudy, Daylight, or
other White Balance option. Also, after you adjust an image, you
can return to the Camera Raw image, select the Camera Raw
Defaults option from the Settings drop-down list, and then process
the image with different settings.

Changing Image
Attributes
W
hatever edits you perform in Elements, you need to constantly
be aware of image attributes. When you know specifics about
your images (such as color mode, dimensions, image resolution,
and so on) you can make edits and change image attributes to
create quality images. Not knowing an image’s attributes or chang-
ing attributes inappropriately can lead to degraded images of poor
quality.
In addition to knowing image attributes, you need to make color deci-
sions for the kind of output you want. You manage color in Photoshop
Elements by embedding color profiles suited for screen/Web viewing
and for color printing. You need to know what profiles to use for a
specific output, how to embed color profiles in images, and how to
finesse color profiles not supported by Elements so that you can make
decisions for all your editing jobs.
In this chapter, you find out how to assess image attributes, change
images from one color mode to another, and work with color profiles
for various output results.

Change Image Bit Depth
1.
Open a 16-bit image in Standard Edit mode.
Almost all high-end digital cameras, many medium-priced digital
cameras, and almost all digital scanners can capture 16-bit images.
A 16-bit image provides more image data and often captures high-
lights (the light areas) and shadows (the dark areas) better than
lower-bit images. But when an image is in 16-bit mode, many edit-
ing features aren’t available in Elements. To use many different
menu commands, you need to change the image mode from a 16-
bit image to an 8-bit image.
2.
Click Layer to open the layers menu.
3.
Notice the Layer menu commands are all grayed out
(see Figure 3-5).
Layer commands are unavailable when you’re working with 16-bit
images. If the commands are accessible, you know your image is
not 16-bit.
4.
Click outside the menu to close it.
5.
Choose Image➪Mode➪8 Bits/Channel to convert the
image (see Figure 3-6). After converting the image, the
Layer menu commands become available.
If the 8 Bits/Channel menu command is available, you’re working
on a 16-bit image. If the command is grayed out, the image is 8-bit.

Convert to Grayscale
1.
Open an RGB color image in Standard edit mode.
2.
Convert to 8-bit mode if the image is a 16-bit image.
3.
Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪Hue/Saturation.
4.
Click OK in the New Layer dialog box, and the
Hue/Saturation dialog box opens (see Figure 3-7).
Elements provides you a direct conversion from RGB color to
grayscale by choosing Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. Using an adjust-
ment layer often results in a slightly better image with a little more
detail shown in shadow areas.
5.
Click the Saturation slider and drag it to the far-left side
of the dialog box to desaturate the image.
6.
Click OK, and the image appears as a grayscale image
(see Figure 3-8).
You can save the file after adding an adjustment layer and return
to the color layer by hiding or deleting the adjustment layer. When
the adjustment layer is shown, you can print the image as
grayscale. Hiding the adjustment layer returns the view to the color
image, and you can print the file as a color photo.

Convert to Bitmap
1.
Open an RGB image in Standard Edit mode.
2.
Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale.
To convert to grayscale, you can use an adjustment layer instead,
as we explain earlier in “Convert to Grayscale.” If you do use an
adjustment layer, you need to flatten the layers before proceeding
with the steps we outline here.
3.
Choose Image➪Mode➪Bitmap to open the Bitmap dia-
log box.
4.
Select a method from the Use drop-down list (see
Figure 3-9). Your choices are:
• 50% Threshold: This method takes all pixels above
the 128 gray level and converts them to white. All
pixels with gray values between 0 and 127 are con-
verted to black. The result is strong black and white
contrast.
• Pattern Dither: This method converts a picture by
organizing the gray levels into geometric configura-
tions of black and white dots. The result appears like
a pattern of dots.
• Diffusion Dither: This conversion method creates a
diffused appearance in the image. Because of the
arrangement of the dots, the image appears almost
grayscale, but the pixel values are only black and
white.
5.
Click OK to convert your image.

Note that the bitmap mode is not the same as the Bitmap (.bmp) file
format. Bitmap mode is a color mode containing only two colors —
black and white.

Organizing Images
T
he Photoshop Elements Organizer is your central workplace. From
the Organizer, you can quickly locate images stored on CD-ROMs,
DVDs, memory cards, external hard drives, and your local computer
hard drive. 
After you add image thumbnails to the Organizer, you have many
options for sorting, searching, and locating files by a number of differ-
ent criteria. The more you know about how to manage all your files
in the Organizer, the faster and more efficient you become in all your
editing tasks.
In this chapter, you discover how to sort images, create different catalogs
and collections, tag images, and how to find files by using collections,
tags, and other search criteria.

Sort Images by Date
1.
Open the Organizer to a catalog that contains images.
2.
Choose View➪Arrangement➪Date (Oldest First), as
shown in Figure 4-1.
3.
Choose Window➪Organize Bin to close the bin.
Alternatively, you can click the left arrow for the
Organize Bin in the lower-right corner of the Organizer
window.
By default, the Organize Bin on the right side of the Organizer win-
dow is open. This bin is helpful when organizing photos in
Collections and adding tags to images for the purposes of sorting
your photos. If you just want to view your photos according to date
order, closing the bin provides more thumbnail viewing room in the
Organizer window.
4.
At the top of the Organize Bin, move the left slider
toward the middle. The date range appears below the
slider and across the Organizer window. As you move
the slider, you narrow the date range, which hides
thumbnail images that are outside that range.
5.
Move the right slider toward the center of the date line.
6.
Move the center slider to rest atop one of the vertical
bars on the date line, as shown in Figure 4-2.
As you move the cursor across the dateline, a ToolTip reports the
month that the image was shot. You can narrow your search for
photos by dragging the end sliders and the center slider to view
only photos taken within a given month and year.

Figure 4-3: The Catalog dialog box
By default, Photoshop Elements puts all the files you acquire in the
Organizer in one catalog file. As you import more files, the catalog
grows, and the number of files in a single catalog can become over-
whelming and hard to manage. As an alternative, you can create dif-
ferent catalogs to organize photos by dates, events, clients, or whatever
category you choose. This makes finding individual photos much easier.

to images within collections. As an example, assume you photograph
weddings as a profession or hobby. You might create a catalog for
all weddings you shot in a given year. Within the catalog, you might
create a collection for each wedding. Within a collection, you might
create tags for photos taken during the bride dressing, the groom

Saving and Undoing
Edits
M
any Elements features exist to help you wow your friends and
loved ones with stunning photos and graphics. Saving and undo-
ing are not among them. But whether you want to make simple auto-
matic corrections or create composites layered with special effects, you
won’t get far if you don’t know how to undo and save your edits.
That’s not to say that Elements doesn’t offer a variety of sophisticated
features for undoing and saving. It does. You can do a simple undo or
save, just as you can in almost any other application. The Undo History
palette, however, lists all your edits in one handy, easy to see place, so
you can travel back in an image’s editing history. Similarly, you can do a
simple save or experiment and compare different versions of an image
by saving version sets. Elements also helps you with the very important
task of backing up your photos and creations to help you prevent losing
your data.

Undo Multiple Edits
1.
In either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode or in the
Organizer, choose Edit➪Undo (see Figure 5-1), or click
the Undo button on the Shortcuts bar.
2.
Repeat Step 1 until you get the image to your desired
state. 
3.
If you went too far in Step 2, choose Edit➪Redo or click
the Redo button on the Shortcuts bar.
4.
To cancel an undo or redo, simply hold down the Esc
key until the progress stops.
Note that how many undos or redos you can muster will depend on
your RAM. If you don’t have enough, you may limit your ability to
undo and redo.

Use the Undo History Palette
1.
In Standard Edit mode only, choose Window➪Undo
History to bring up the Undo History palette, shown in
Figure 5-2. 
2.
As you work, the operations and edits that changed pix-
els are recorded and saved, as states, in the Undo
History palette. 
3.
To undo one or more edits, select your desired state in
the palette. Your image then reverts back to how it
looked after that edit.
4.
You can then start working from that state. Note that all
states after the state you chose in Step 3 are discarded as
soon as you continue working.
5.
To revert back to the original state of the image, select
the thumbnail at the top of the palette.
The Undo History palette stores 50 history states by default. Older
states (at the top of the palette) are deleted as you perform new
operations. You can change the number of history states that
Elements stores via the General Preferences. Be aware that, when
you close your image, none of your states are saved.

3.
For Format, choose your desired file format.
4.
Select the Include in Organizer check box if you want.
This option is available for some file formats and, if
selected, will include the saved file in your catalog so
that it displays in the Photo Browser.
5.
With the Include in Organizer check box selected, you

Save a Version Set
1.
Do either of the following steps:
• Select a file in the Organizer. Choose Enhance➪Auto
Smart Fix. Elements automatically puts the original
photo and the edited copy together in a version set,
as shown in Figure 5-4.
• Edit a photo in Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode.
Choose File➪Save As. Select the Save In Version Set
with Original check box.
A version set contains the original photo and all its edited versions,
as shown in Figure 5-5. Instead of being stored randomly through-
out the Photo Browser, version sets keep the original and edited
versions of an image together in a visual stack. This makes finding
all iterations of an image a snap.
In the Organizer, you can delete individual photos from a version
set by choosing Edit➪Version Set➪Remove Item(s) from Version
Set. In turn, you can convert the version set to individual photos so
that each image appears separately by choosing Edit➪Version
Set➪Convert Version Set to Individual Items.

Quick Fixing 
Images
B
eing able to quickly fix your digital images is a much coveted fea-
ture of Elements and one you’ll likely use often. Elements is chock
full of tools and commands to take care of any color, contrast, and clar-
ity problems. Don’t worry. You don’t have to be a digital imaging expert
to use these tools. Tasks such as improving your image’s contrast, cor-
recting red eye, adjusting skin tones or fixing the highlight and shadow
areas of your image are as easy as one or two mouse clicks.
In this chapter, you discover how to employ all the quick fixes to
improve the quality of your digital photos. We start with the Auto
Fixes and then move on to working in Quick Fix mode. If your image
needs a little more help, we show you how to employ manual fixes,
which provide you with more controls for fine-tuning your corrections.

Improve Overall with Auto Smart Fix
1.
Open a file in Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode or in
the Organizer or Slide Show editor.
In the Organizer, you can apply the command to several images
simultaneously.
2.
Choose Enhance➪Auto Smart Fix. The lighting, shadow
and highlight detail, and color balance should all be
improved, as shown in Figure 6-1.
If this fix didn’t improve your image to your liking, try the Adjust
Smart Fix command, which we describe later in this chapter. This
command is similar to the Auto Smart Fix, but provides you with
sliders that let you control the amount of correction applied to the
image. Or try applying fixes to just a selection in your image, which
sometimes creates better results.
Fix Contrast with Auto Levels
1.
Open a file in either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode.
2.
Choose Enhance➪Auto Levels. The overall contrast
of your image should be improved, with highlights
appearing lighter and shadows appearing darker, as
shown in Figure 6-2.
Occasionally Auto Levels will improve the contrast, but may, in turn,
produce an unwanted colorcast (trace of color). Undo the command
and try the Auto Contrast command instead. Still not working? Move
onto the Levels command, which we explain later in this chapter.

Chapter 6: Quick Fixing Images

Adjust Contrast with Auto Contrast
1.
Open a file in either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode.
2.
Choose Enhance➪Auto Contrast. The overall contrast of
your image should be improved without any adjustment
to its color.
Although the Auto Contrast command might not do as good a job at
fixing contrast as Auto Levels, it shouldn’t introduce any color casts.
The Auto Contrast command works especially well on hazy images,
such as the one shown in Figure 6-3.
Remove Color Casts with Auto Color
Correction
1.
Open a file in either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode.
2.
Choose Enhance➪Auto Color Correction.
You can use the Auto Color Correction command to remove a color
cast or balance the color in an image, as shown in Figure 6-4. It can
come in handy in correcting oversaturated or undersaturated colors
in your photos as well.

Edit with Quick Fix
1.
Select one or more images in the Organizer and choose
Edit➪Go to Quick Fix or click the Quick Fix button on
the Shortcuts bar. If you are in Standard Edit mode,
click the Quick Fix button in the top right of the appli-
cation window. And if you’re already in Quick Fix
mode, just choose File➪Open and grab an image.
2.
Select a preview option from the View drop-down list.
Before and After is always a good choice (see Figure 6-5).
3.
If necessary, crop your image by using the Crop tool in
the Tools palette.
4.
Click the Rotate Left or Rotate Right buttons to rotate
your image in 90 degree increments, if necessary.
5.
Got red eye? Use the Red Eye tool to remove the red
from the eyes of your loved ones. Or click the Auto but-
ton under Red Eye Fix in the General Fixes palette on
the right of the application window.
6.
Additionally, click the Auto button to apply any needed
automatic fixes, such as Auto Smart Fix, Auto Levels,
Auto Contrast, and Auto Color. You can also find these
commands under the Enhance menu.

7.
If the auto fixes weren’t successful, try using the adjust-
ment sliders for Smart Fix (under General Fixes),
Contrast (under Lighting), and Color. Here is a brief
description of each adjustment:
• Lighten Shadows: Lightens the darker areas of an
image.
• Darken Highlights: Darkens the lighter areas of
an image.
• Midtone Contrast: Adjusts the contrast of the mid-
dle, or gray, values, as shown in Figure 6-6.
• Saturation: Adjusts the richness of the colors.
• Hue: Changes all colors, or hue, in the image.
• Temperature: Makes the color warmer (red) or
cooler (blue).
• Tint: Makes the color more green or more magenta.
8.
Sharpen your image by clicking the Auto button in the
Sharpen palette. Or, for more control, manually drag the
Amount slider.
Quick Fix mode is a slimmed down version of Standard Edit mode,
providing the bare essentials in editing tools. You might find that it
meets of all your editing needs and you never have to visit
Standard Edit mode. Note that you can apply all these fixes to just
selected portions of your image. Grab the Selection Brush or Magic
Selection Brush tools to make your desired selections first.

Erase Red Eye with Auto Red Eye Fix
1.
Open a file in need of red eye correction (see Figure 6-7)
in either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode or in the
Organizer or Slide Show editor. In the Organizer, you can
apply this command to several images simultaneously. 
2.
Choose Enhance➪Auto Red Eye Fix, and your image
looks more like the one shown in Figure 6-8.
Red eye occurs when a person or animal looks directly into the
flash. Setting your digital camera to red-eye prevention mode
should help to eliminate red-eye when you shoot. To eliminate red
eye after the fact, use the new Auto Red Eye Fix, which is designed
to automatically detect and eliminate red eye in an image.
Occasionally, however, it doesn’t do the job, and you’ll have to
break out the Red Eye Removal tool.
To correct yellow eyes in animals, break out the Color
Replacement tool and paint with black.
Click with the Red Eye Removal Tool
1.
Open a file in either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode.
2.
Select the Red Eye Removal tool from the Tools palette.
3.
Click the red portion of the eye in your image to darken
the pupil while retaining the tonal textures of the eye.
4.
If you’re dissatisfied with the results, adjust one or both
of the following settings found on the Options bar:
• Pupil Size: Use the slider to increase or decrease the
size of the pupil.
• Darken Pupil: Use the slider to darken or lighten the
color of the pupil.

ment, move the sliders to further refine the amount of
correction for your shadows, highlights, and midtones.
5.

ments and exit the dialog box.
Try and coax out more detail in the dark and light areas of your

Adjust Brightness and Contrast
1.

that needs an overall adjustment in brightness and con-
trast (see Figure 6-11).
2.
Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Brightness/Contrast. 
3.
Select the Preview check box in the dialog box.

Adjust the brightness and/or contrast by moving the
sliders to the right or left.
5.
When you’re happy, click OK to apply the final adjust-
ments and exit the dialog box. Figure 6-12 shows an
improved image.
The Brightness and Contrast command adjusts all the areas of your
image equally. It doesn’t take into account images that have good
highlights and midtones and only need the shadows lightened, or
vice versa. So although you might fix one problem, you might intro-
duce a new problem that wasn’t there before. If you want to use
this adjustment, make a selection of your problem areas first. Or,
better yet, use the more sophisticated Shadows/Highlights or Levels
adjustments to correct contrast.

Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode (see Figure 6-13).
2.
Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels. The Levels
dialog box displays a histogram, which shows how the
pixels of the image are distributed at each of the 256
available brightness levels.
3.
Move the black triangle to the right to darken the shad-
ows in the image. Move it to the left to lighten the shad-
ows. You can also enter values of 0 to 255 in the Input
Levels boxes.
4.
Move the white triangle to the left to lighten the high-
lights in the image. Move it to the right to darken the
highlights.
5.
Move the gray triangle to the left to lighten the mid-
tones in the image. Move it to the right to darken the
midtones.
6.
If you need to reduce the contrast in your image, adjust
the sliders under Output Levels. Moving the black triangle
to the right reduces contrast in the shadows and lightens
the image. Moving the white triangle to the left reduces
the contrast in the highlights and darkens the image.
7.
When you’re happy, click OK to apply the final adjust-
ments and exit the dialog box.
Although a little more complex, the Levels adjustment is the true
king in the realm of contrast adjustments. Know it, use it, and the
contrast of your images will be much improved as a result, as shown
in Figure 6-14.

Color Variations dialog box appears, offering thumb-
nails of various color variations and a large Before and
After adjustment thumbnail of your image.
3.
Select your desired tonal range or color intensity, 
as follows:
• Shadows, Midtones, Highlights: Adjusts the dark,
middle or light areas in the image. Usually, correcting
the Midtones greatly improves the color.
• Saturation: Adjusts the intensity, or richness, of the
colors. 
4.
Drag the Adjust Color slider to specify the amount of
adjustment. Drag right to increase and left to decrease.
5.
If you selected a tonal area in Step 3, adjust your color
by clicking the Increase or Decrease (color) thumbnails.
You might need to click more than once. Watch the After
thumbnail. Remember to decrease the offending color.
6.
If you selected Saturation in Step 3, click the Less
Saturation or More Saturation buttons to decrease or
increase it.
7.
If you’ve mucked things up, click Undo (or the Before
image). Color Variations graciously supports multiple
levels of undo. To start over, click Reset Image. And to
bail out completely, click Cancel.
8.
When you attain your desired color, click OK to apply
the adjustments and exit the dialog box. Figure 6-23
shows how we adjusted colors in the photo of the
young girl.

You can use Color Variations as a way to eliminate color casts in  images,
such as those old family photos that have faded and turned green.
Remove Color Cast and Auto Color Correction, which we describe earlier
in this chapter, can also help with this task.

Defringe to Remove Colored Halos
1.
In Standard Edit mode, copy and paste a selection into a
new or existing layer. Or drag and drop a selection onto
a new document.
2.
Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Defringe Layer.
3.
In the Defringe dialog box, enter a value for the number
of pixels that need to be converted. Start with a value of
1 or 2. If that doesn’t work, go for a higher number.
4.
If you’re happy with the defringing, click OK to apply
the adjustment and exit the dialog box.
When compositing multiple images into a single document, you usu-
ally make selections and place them on layers. Sometimes when
you pluck elements from their original backgrounds, the edges con-
tain stray background-colored pixels, creating a colored halo. The
Defringe command replaces the halo color with the color of neigh-
boring pixels, as shown in Figure 6-24.

f we could be so lucky that every shot we took was perfect in every
way, we might stroll by Elements with our elitist noses up in the air.
But even the best photographers among us occasionally need a helping
hand or two. Fortunately, Elements has multiple helping hands to assist
you in your refining, retouching, and repairing tasks. Along with the
steps provided in Chapter 10, you find plenty of tools and methods to
take care of most of the common photographic problems, such as incor-
rect color, wrong orientation and scale, and crooked photos with dis-
tracting backgrounds and dust and scratches. In this chapter, you also
find out how you can repair annoying little defects to further improve
the quality of your precious images. From dodging and burning shad-
ows and highlights to breaking out the Healing tools to zap blemishes
and wrinkles, we give you the instructions on using an arsenal of repair
tools.

Crop an Image
1.
Select the Crop tool from the Tools palette in either
Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode.
2.
Specify your Aspect Ratio option on the Options bar.
• No Restriction: Enables you to freely crop the image
as desired.
• Photo Ratio: Retains the original aspect ratio of the
image when you crop.
• Preset sizes: Choose from a variety of common
photo sizes.
• Width and Height: Specify a desired final width
and height.
3.
Drag the portion of the image you want to retain and
release your mouse button, as shown in Figure 7-1.
4.
Adjust the cropping marquee by dragging the handles of
the crop marquee bounding box. 
5.
Move the entire bounding box by positioning your
mouse inside the marquee and dragging.
6.
To rotate the bounding box, move your mouse outside
the marquee until you see a curved arrow. Then drag
with this cursor to rotate.
7.
When the marquee marks the cropping just the way you
want it, double-click inside the bounding box or click
the green Commit button next to the marquee.
You can also crop an image by creating a selection with any of the
selection tools and then choosing Image➪Crop command in either
Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode. 
Figure 7-1: Cropping your image is an easy way to improve 
a photo’s composition
Be aware that when cropping an image, Elements retains the original
resolution of the file, unless you specify otherwise in the Options bar.
Therefore, in order to keep your image at the same resolution while
eliminating portions of your photo, the program must resample the file.
It is important that you have enough resolution so that the effects of the
resampling aren’t overly degrading. This is especially critical when
choosing a larger preset size. See Chapter 3 for more information on
resolution.

Straighten an Image
1.
Open an image that isn’t quite straight (see Figure 7-2)
and select the Straighten tool from the Tools palette in
Standard Edit mode only.
2.
Specify your settings from the Canvas Options in the
Options bar: 
• Grow Canvas to Fit: Rotates the image and increases
the size of the canvas to fit the image area.
• Crop to Remove Background: Trims background
canvas outside the image area.
• Crop to Original Size: Rotates your image without
trimming any background canvas.
3.
Select Rotate All Layers if applicable.
4.
With the Straighten tool, draw a line in your image
to represent the new straight edge. Elements then
straightens your image, as shown in Figure 7-3. If you
chose a cropping option in Step 2, the image is cropped
as well.
You can also straighten your images using two commands under the
Image menu, in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode. To automat-
ically straighten an image without cropping, which leaves the canvas
remaining around the image, choose Image➪Rotate➪Straighten
Image. To automatically straighten and crop the image simultane-
ously, choose Image➪Rotate➪Straighten and Crop Image.

Remove Dust and Scratches
1.
In Standard Edit mode, open an image with specks of
dust or scratches (see Figure 7-8) and choose Filter➪
Noise➪Dust & Scratches.
2.
Adjust the preview zoom by clicking the plus and minus
buttons until your desired area is in view.
3.
Specify your desired Radius by dragging the Radius
slider or entering a value from 1 to 100 pixels. The
Radius value determines the size of the area analyzed
for dissimilar pixels. The higher the radius, the blurrier
the effect.
4.
Specify your desired Threshold by dragging the slider or
entering a value of 0 to 255 levels. The Threshold value
determines how much contrast between the pixels must
be present before pixels are deleted. If you set the value
to 0, Elements analyzes all pixels for dust and scratches.
Figure 7-9 shows the results.
The Dust & Scratches filter hides dust and scratches — which fall
into the general imaging category of “noise” — by looking for and
changing dissimilar pixels. You can apply the filter to the whole
image or to just the defective areas. Try to find a happy compro-
mise between eliminating the noise and blurring the image.

Clone and Repair with
the Clone Stamp
1.
Select the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools palette in
Standard Edit mode.
2.
In the Options bar, choose a brush from the Brush
Presets drop-down palette. If necessary, adjust the
brush tip diameter with the Size slider.
Be sure to choose a brush that is appropriate for the element you’re
trying to clone or the flaw you’re trying to retouch. Larger objects
require a larger brush, and vice versa.
3.
Choose a blend mode and opacity percentage from the
Options bar. For most jobs, Normal works best.
4.
Select or deselect the Aligned option. With Aligned
selected, the source from which you’re cloning moves as
you move your cursor. If you want to clone continu-
ously from the same source location, deselect Aligned.
5.
Choose Sample All Layers to clone from all the visi-
ble layers. If left deselected, you clone only from the
active layer.
6.
Alt+click the portion of your image that you want to
clone. This is your source.
7.
Release the Alt key and click the area where you want
your clone to appear. Or drag over the area you are
repairing, if it’s a bit larger than your brush. 
Figure 7-10: Watch the crosshair when cloning to ensure your source is accurate
PhotoSpin
As you drag (in Step 7), Elements displays a crosshair icon along with
your Clone Stamp cursor. The crosshair is your clone source, while the
cursor is your clone destination. As you move the mouse, the crosshair
moves as well, providing a reference to the area of your image that
you’re cloning from, as shown in Figure 7-10.

Zap Small Flaws with the
Spot Healing Brush
1.
Select the Spot Healing Brush tool from the Tools
palette in Standard Edit mode.
2.
In the Options bar, click the Brush Preset picker and
select a desired diameter and hardness for your brush
tip from the drop-down palette. Be sure to choose a
brush that is a little larger than the flawed area you’re
fixing.
3.
Choose a blend mode from the Options bar. For most
jobs, Normal works best.
4.
Choose a type from the Options bar:
• Proximity Match: Samples and uses the pixels
around the edge of the selection to fix the flaw.
• Create Texture: Uses all the pixels in the selection to
create a texture to repair the flaw.
5.
Choose Sample All Layers to heal an image using all the
visible layers. If left unselected, you heal from the active
layer only.
6.
Click or drag the area you want to fix. 
The quick and easy Spot Healing Brush is great for small imperfec-
tions, such as the moles shown in Figure 7-11, which are removed
in Figure 7-12. The Spot Healing Brush doesn’t require you to speci-
fy a sampling source. It takes a sample from around the flawed
area. For larger repairs, break out the Healing Brush and try out
the next task.

chosen from the Pattern picker drop-down palette.
5.
Select or deselect the Aligned option in the Options bar.
When Aligned is selected, the source location of the
healing moves when you move your cursor. When
Aligned is deselected, the source pixels are applied from
your initial sampling point every time.
6.
Select Sample All Layers in the Options bar to heal an
image using all visible layers. If deselected, you heal
from the active layer only.
7.
Find an area on your image that you want to use as your
source to repair your flaw. Establish your sampling
point by Alt+clicking that area.
8.
Release the Alt key and then click or drag over your
flawed area. 
Using the appropriate brush size for the flaw you’re repairing is
important in creating a realistic result. We also recommend leaving
Aligned selected (in Step 5) for most retouching jobs. Figure 7-13

Making Selections
A
side from achieving correct color in Photoshop Elements, making
selections is one of the most important skills you need to develop.
Selections isolate areas of an image so that you can edit, clone, copy,
adjust brightness and color, apply effects, and do almost any editing
task to just that area. Unless you want to globally apply an edit to an
entire image, making selections is likely to be part of every editing ses-
sion you perform in Elements.
Unlike vector art programs, where you can click an object to select it,
photographs are made up of pixels. To isolate a foreground item or a
background in a photo, you need to surround all the pixels that com-
prise the item you want to select. Doing so isn’t always an easy task,
especially when the colors between items are similar in value.
Fortunately, Photoshop Elements provides you many different tools and
methods you can use to create accurate and precise selections. Knowing
when to use one tool over another is an important consideration each
time you go about selecting areas in an image. Additionally, you’ll want
to learn all the selection methods Photoshop Elements provides because
many editing sessions require you to use several selection tools in com-
bination to create precise selections. 
In this chapter, you discover how to use many different selection tools
and employ methods that help you make accurate selections.

Make an Elliptical Selection
1.
Open a file in Standard Edit mode.
2.
Click the Rectangular Marquee tool, hold down the
mouse button, and from the pop-up menu, choose
Elliptical Marquee Tool (see Figure 8-3). Or use the key-
board shortcut Shift+M.
All the keyboard shortcuts for selecting tools work the same way.
Press the keyboard shortcut for a tool to select it. Press Shift plus
the shortcut to select other tools hidden underneath a tool. The
arrow in the lower-right indicates more tools are available. When a
tool is selected, you can also select tools that were hidden under it
from the Options bar.
3.
Click and drag to create an elliptical marquee around
the area you want to select. You might need to toggle
back and forth between moving and sizing the marquee
to create a perfect selection, like the one shown in
Figure 8-4.
4.
To move the marquee, hold down the spacebar and click
and drag the marquee.
5.
Size the Elliptical Marquee by releasing the spacebar
and drag the mouse out or in to resize the selection.

Select the Lasso tool in the Tools palette. Or press L.
3.
Drag the mouse around the area you want to select
(trace the area), as shown in Figure 8-5.
4.
Return to the point of origin and release the mouse 
button.
5.
Zoom in on the selected area by pressing Ctrl++ (plus).
The more you can zoom in on an area, the more precisely you can

to your selection (see Figure 8-6). To remove part of the
selection, press Alt and trace the selection area you want
to remove.
When you press Shift with the Lasso tool selected, a plus (+) sym-
bol appears next to the Lasso icon. Pressing Alt changes the plus
symbol to a minus (-) symbol. As you polish a selection by using the
Lasso tool and modifier keys, these symbols let you know whether
you will add to or subtract from a selection.

2.
Select the Magic Wand tool in the Tools palette.
Use the Magic Wand for selections in images with tones that blend
gradually or vary greatly. Magic Wand selections are also handy
when you want to select similar tones in different areas of an
image.
3.
Set the tolerance level on the Options bar.
The tolerance level determines the range of tones selected when
you click. A higher tolerance tells Elements to select more tones. As
the number decreases, Elements selects fewer tones. If on your first
attempt, the tool selects too much or too little color, change the
Tolerance value on the Options bar and click again to create another
selection. 
4.
Click in an area you want to select.
5.
Press Shift and click to add more to your selection.
Continue Shift+clicking to add more to the selected area
(see Figure 8-9).

Getting Creative
with Layers
I
t isn’t mandatory that you delve into the world of layers, which you
venture into via Standard Edit mode, but they can sure make your
life a lot easier. The benefits of using layers are numerous. First of all,
they offer a lot of flexibility. You can do things to layers that you can’t
do to a background, such as adjust the transparency. They are especially
useful when creating composites from multiple images; put each of
your images on a separate layer and you can edit each layer independ-
ently of the others.
Secondly, they give you more freedom to experiment. Duplicate your
image to a layer and try out a certain technique. If things go awry, sim-
ply delete that layer. Your original image remains intact. They also offer
you additional creative muscle. You can apply special effects such as
layer effects and styles. You can also change the way the colors in your
layers interact by applying various blend modes.
Finally, even if all you want to do is adjust color or contrast, you’re better
off using a special kind of layer called an adjustment layer. Adjustment
layers offer endless editability and hover above your image and don’t
muck with the pixels at all.
This chapter gives you everything you need to know about layers. Give
them a try. They’ll make your digital imaging life more productive, not
to mention more fun.

Convert a Background into a Layer
1.
Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers palette.
2.
Double-click Background in the Layers palette (see
Figure 9-1) or choose Layer➪New➪Layer from
Background.
3.
Name the layer or leave it with the default name of
Layer 0. You can also specify additional layer options,
if desired.
4.
Click OK and your background transforms into a layer
(see Figure 9-2).
Layers created from images are referred to as regular layers or
image layers. There are also type layers, shape layers, adjustment
layers, and fill layers. Adjustment and fill layers are described later
in this chapter. Type layers are explained in Chapter 10. We cover
shape layers in Chapter 11.
When you create a new file with background contents of white or a
color, scan an image into Elements, or open a file from a CD or from
a digital camera, you have a file with just a background. An image
contains only one background, and you can’t do much to it besides
paint on it and make basic adjustments. When you create a new
image with transparent background contents, the image is created
with a single layer, not a background.

Create a New Layer in an Existing File
1.
Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers palette.
2.
Do one of the following:
• Choose the Create a New Layer icon at the top of the
Layers palette.
• Choose New Layer from the Layers palette pop-up
menu.
• Choose Layer➪New➪Layer.
3.
If you create a layer by using either menu command,
name your layer, set options in the dialog box, and
click OK.
Think of blank layers (see Figure 9-3) as digital sheets of acetate.
You can layer graphics, photos, or type on different sheets. Any
area without an image is transparent. You can stack the sheets one
on top of the other to create a combined image, rearrange the
sheets’ order, and add or delete sheets.
Get Contents on a Layer
1.
After you create a new layer, make a selection on the
Background or on another layer. This selection can be in
the same image or in another image. Note that you can
choose Select➪All to select the whole Background or
layer.
2.
Choose Edit➪Copy or Edit➪Cut. Cut removes the selec-
tion and leaves a transparent hole (if it’s a layer) or your
background color (if it’s a Background).
3.
Select the blank layer in the Layers palette and choose
Edit➪Paste. Your selection appears on the layer (see

and Layer via Cut Commands
1.
Make a selection on a layer or Background within the
same image only.
2.
Choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy or Layer via Cut
(see Figure 9-5). Remember that cutting removes the
selection and leaves a hole.
3.
Elements automatically creates a new layer and puts the
copied or cut selection on the layer.
Drag and Drop a Layer between Files
1.
In your source image, choose a layer in the Layers
palette. If you want only a portion of the layer, make
your desired selection.
2.
Select the Move tool from the Tools palette.
3.
Place your Move tool cursor somewhere within the
selection marquee. Drag and drop the layer onto your
destination image (see Figure 9-6). 
Dragging and dropping layers is more efficient than copying and
pasting because it bypasses the Clipboard. The Clipboard is a tem-
porary storage area on your computer for copied or cut data.
Storing data uses computer memory. Therefore, by keeping your
Clipboard clear, Photoshop operates more efficiently.

in Figure 9-17. When using painting tools, the blend modes affect
the way the color of the paint interacts with the color on the layer
to which it is applied. Blend modes do not directly affect the pixels
of the layer and can be edited or removed without harming your
image.
Create an Adjustment Layer
1.
Open an image that needs color or contrast correction.
If you have multiple layers, keep in mind that the
adjustment layer affects only the layers below it.
An adjustment layer is a special type of layer used for adjusting color
and contrast. With adjustment layers, you do not apply your correc-
tions directly on the image. Instead, they hover above the image on
their own layer, keeping your original image layers intact. Using an
adjustment layer also enables you to edit or delete the adjustment
at any time. 
2.
Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon at the top of the
Layers palette (see Figure 9-18).
3.
From the drop-down list, choose your desired 
adjustment.
4.
Specify the options of your specific adjustment. For
details on image adjustments, see Chapter 6.

Chapter 9: Getting Creative with Layers

5.
Click OK. The adjustment layer, with a corresponding
layer mask, appears in the Layers palette, as shown in
Figure 9-19.
6.
If desired, you can adjust the Opacity and blend mode
of the adjustment layer to reduce or change the effect of
the adjustment, respectively. We left the default Opacity
and blend mode, as shown in Figure 9-20.
7.
To edit the adjustment layer, simply double-click the
adjustment layer in the Layers palette or choose
Layer➪Layer Content Options.
8.
To switch to a different kind of adjustment, choose
Layer➪Change Layer Content and select another type of
adjustment.
9.
To delete the adjustment layer, drag it to the trash icon
in the Layers palette.
When you create an adjustment layer, you also create a layer mask
at the same time. A layer mask is like a second sheet of acetate that
enables you to selectively apply the adjustment to the layers below
it when you paint on the mask with white, black, and various
shades of gray. By default, the layer mask is white, which allows the
adjustment to affect all the layers below. If you paint with black,
those areas under the black will not be affected by the adjustment.
If you paint with a shade of gray, those areas will be partially
affected by the adjustment. Note that you can use the Brush, Pencil,
and Gradient tools. If you have an active selection before you cre-
ate an adjustment layer, the adjustment affects only the area within
the selection marquee.

actual image pixels

Create a Fill Layer
1.
Open an image that would look good with a frame or
border. You can also use a blank document.
2.
Make a selection for your frame or border with the
Rectangular Marquee tool. Remember, if you don’t have
a selection in your image, the fill layer will cover your
entire image.
3.
Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers
palette. From the drop-down list, choose a solid-color,
gradient, or pattern fill.
4.
Specify your options, depending on the fill type you
chose in Step 3:
• Solid Color: Choose your desired color from the
Color Picker.
• Gradient: Click the downward-pointing arrow to
choose a preset gradient from the drop-down palette
or click the gradient preview to display the Gradient
Editor and create your own gradient.
• Pattern: Choose a pattern from the drop-down
palette. Enter a value to scale your pattern if neces-
sary. Check Snap to Origin to position the origin of
the pattern with the documents window. Choose the
Link with Layer option to specify that the pattern
moves with the fill layer if you move it.
5.
Click OK. The fill layer, with a corresponding layer
mask, appears in the Layers palette (see Figure 9-21).

6.
If desired, you can adjust the Opacity and blend mode
of the fill layer to reduce or change the effect of the fill,
respectively.
7.
To edit the fill layer, simply double-click the adjustment
layer in the Layers palette or choose Layer➪
Layer Content Options.
8.
To switch to a different kind of fill, choose Layer➪
Change Layer Content and select another type of fill.
9.
To delete the fill layer, drag it to the trash icon in the
Layers palette.
Fill layers allow you to add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a
pattern. We added a solid color to the border in Figure 9-22. Fill
layers also include layer masks, which enable you to selectively
show and hide portions of the fill layer by painting on the mask
with black, white, and gray.

Apply a Layer Effect
1.
Select your image layer or type layer in the Layers
palette. If you are applying the effect to just a selection,
make the selection before to applying the effect.
2.
Choose Window➪Styles and Effects.
3.
Choose Effects from the drop-down list at the top left of
the palette.
4.
Choose your desired category of effects from the drop-
down list at the top right of the palette:
• All: Shows all the effects.
• Frames: Includes effects that enhance the edges of
the layer or selection.
• Image Effects: Includes a wide variety of effects to
make your image appear as though it were snowing,
made of lizard skin or neon tubes, or painted with
oil pastels.
• Text Effects: These effects enhance your type with
shadows, spray paint, metal, or confetti. Note that
when an effect is applied to type, it becomes simplified
and looses its editability.
• Textures: Includes textured effects such as bricks
and rust.
5.
In the Effects palette, double-click your desired effect
or drag the effect onto the image. In Figure 9-23, we
applied Quadrant Colors to the image.
Figure 9-23: Add pizzazz to your layers by adding an effect
Specific effects can be applied to a selection, layer, or type. The names
of those effects are followed by the label (Selection),
(Layer), or (Type). Be forewarned that some effects auto-
matically create a duplicate of the selected layer, and other effects work
only on flattened images. Unfortunately, you cannot preview how the
effect will look on your image or type, nor do you have any options to
specify.

Apply a Layer Style
1.
Select your image or type layer in the Layers palette.
2.
Choose Window➪Styles and Effects.
3.
Choose Layer Styles from the drop-down list at the top
left of the palette.
4.
Choose your desired library of styles from the drop-
down list at the top right of the palette:
• Bevels: Adds a three-dimensional edge on the outside
or inside edges of the layer. Emboss gives a raised or
punched appearance. Adjust the lighting angle,
shadow distance, size of the glow and bevel, and
bevel direction. The Use Global Light option applies
the same lighting angle for all styles, ensuring a con-
sistent light source.
• Drop and Inner Shadows: Choose from regular
shadows or ones that include noise, neon, or out-
lines. Adjust the lighting angle and shadow distance.
• Outer and Inner Glows: Adds a soft halo on the out-
side or inside edges of your layer. Adjust by changing
lighting angle, shadow distance, and the size of the
glow.
• Visibility: Click Show, Hide, or Ghosted to either dis-
play, hide, or partially show the layer. The Layer Style
remains fully displayed.
• Complex and others: The remaining Layer Styles are
a mix of different effects. You can customize all these
Layer Styles by adjusting their various settings.
5.
In the Layer Styles palette, double-click your desired
effect or drag the effect onto the image. The style, with
its default settings, is applied to the layer. You can apply
multiple styles — one style from each library — to a
single layer. Figure 9-24 shows the Rose Impressions
style applied to our type.
Figure 9-24: Give depth to your layer by adding a layer style
To edit the style’s settings, either double-click the florin in the Layers
palette or choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Style Settings.
Unlike filters, Layer Styles don’t permanently alter your layer’s pixels.
So you can edit or even delete them if you’re dissatisfied with the
results.

lthough Elements is a virtual wizard when it comes to organizing,
sharing, and even repairing your images, it doesn’t stop there.
Elements is also a full-fledged drawing and painting program. If you’re
in a free-form mood, grab the Brush or Pencil tool, select a color, and
take a swipe at the canvas. If you’re feeling more restrained, the shape
tools enable you to draw precise shapes of all sorts. If your artistic 
ability is somewhat lacking, it doesn’t matter. Elements offers plenty
of preset brushes and shapes that require only a couple clicks of the
mouse to use.
This chapter gives you all you need to know about the world of drawing
and painting. And practicing your artistic side offers an added bonus.
Many of Elements’ selection and editing tools (in Standard Edit mode)
involve brush tips and the technique of painting. So what you do here,
you can also use elsewhere in your digital imaging tasks.

marks in a stroke. The higher the value, the higher the
number of brush marks and the farther apart they are.
• Angle: If you’ve created a brush with an oval stroke
by adjusting the roundness, this option controls the
angle of that oval brush stroke. 
• Roundness: Determines whether your brush stroke
creates more of a circle or an oval. A setting of 100%
is circular. The lower the percentage, the more oblong
your brush stroke becomes.
• Keep These Settings for All Brushes: You can lock in
these brush dynamics by selecting this option.

Create a Custom Brush
1.
With the Brush tool selected, choose a preset brush
from the Brush drop-down palette on the Options bar.
2.
Modify the brush to your liking by adjusting the options.
3.
Choose Save Brush from the pop-up menu on the Brush
drop-down palette.
4.
Name the brush and click OK. The new brush shows up at
the bottom of the Brush Preset Picker drop-down palette.
You can also create a custom brush from all or part of an image (see
Figure 11-8). Simply select all or part of your image with any selection
tool. Choose Edit➪Define Brush or Edit➪Define Brush from Selection.
Name the brush and click OK. Note, however, that if you define a brush
from a selection containing color, the brush won’t retain the color, but
instead will be grayscale.
Create a Painting with the
Impressionist Brush
1.
Select the Impressionist Brush from the Tools palette.
The Impressionist Brush tool enables you to give your image a
painterly quality (see Figure 11-9). Copy your image to a new layer
before you experiment. That way if you’re not happy, you can
delete the duplicate layer and return to your original image.
2.
Set the brush options on the Options bar. (We explain the

3.
Drag on your image and paint with your brush.
Fill a Selection with Color
1.
On a new layer, create a selection by using any of
Elements’ selection tools or methods. 
2.
Choose Edit➪Fill Selection. Note that if you don’t have
an active selection, the command will say Fill Layer, and
your entire layer is filled with color or a pattern.
3.
In the dialog box, choose your desired fill from the Use
pop-up menu. Select Foreground or Background color,
Color, Black, 50% Gray, White, or Pattern. If you select
Color, the Color Picker appears for you to set your
desired color. If you select Pattern, choose your desired
pattern from the Custom Pattern drop-down palette. 
4.
Select whether to Preserve Transparency. If you select
this option, you fill only the portions of the selection
that contain pixels. Although you can select Blend
Modes and an Opacity percentage in the dialog box, we
recommend making these setting adjustments on the
layer in the Layer palette, because you have more editing
flexibility. 
5.
Click OK to exit the dialog box and apply the fill to the
selection, as shown in Figure 11-10.
Figure 11-10: Fill a selection or an entire layer with color or a pattern
If you can’t quite get the element you want with the Brush or Pencil tool,
try making a selection and filling it. Any selection you make can be filled,
or stroked, with color. Filling adds a color or a pattern to the entire selec-
tion, whereas stroking applies color to just the selection border edge.
Bypass the Fill dialog box by using a handy keyboard shortcut. To fill
with the foreground color, press Alt+Backspace. To fill with the back-
ground color, press Ctrl+Backspace.

are the same as those found in the Fill dialog box, as we
explain earlier in “Fill a Selection with Color.” Unique
options are as follows:
• Tolerance: Specifies how similar in color a pixel must
be before it is selected and then filled. The lower the
value, the more similar the color must be.
• Anti-Alias: Smooths the edges between the filled and
unfilled areas.
• Contiguous: Selects and fills only pixels that are
touching within your selection. If deselected, pixels
are selected and filled wherever they lie within your
image.
• Use All Layers: Select this option and Elements fills
similar pixels on any visible layer. If deselected,
Elements fills only on the active layer.
3.
Click the area you want to select and fill. If things go
awry, choose Edit➪Undo and try again. In Figure 11-13,
we put our fill on a separate layer and set the Blend
mode to Color so the tones of the apple would show
through the color.

When you create a shape in Elements, you’re creating a vector-based
element. Vector shapes are created via a mathematical formula instead
of by square pixels. The shapes are comprised of paths, which are made
up of lines, curves, and anchor points. Because vector shapes are math-
based, you can resize them without any loss of quality. Shapes reside on
a shape layer.

T
he Filters menu in Photoshop Elements hosts a variety of menu
commands that enable you to apply fine art effects to your images
and distort them in many different ways. The Filters menu offers you
some essential tools for improving your photographs.
If you know nothing about image editing, you can open a photo in
Standard Edit mode, select a filter, and wow your friends and family
with dazzling effects. Filters are fun, easy to use, and produce spectacu-
lar results.
Also on the Filter menu, you find some essential tools for improving
your images, such as the sharpening filters, the photo filter, a filter to
remove dust and scratches, options for changing lighting in a photo,
and more.
In this chapter, you find out how to use filters and apply the effects to

In the Unsharp Mask dialog box (see Figure 12-12), you
have options for
• Amount: Depending on the resolution of your image,
enter an amount that does not produce an over-
sharpened appearance. For 300 ppi (pixel per inch)
images, use an amount of 200.
• Radius: Divide the resolution by the Amount to
determine the Radius value. For a 300 ppi image
with an Amount of 200, the radius would be 1.5.
• Tolerance: The lower the Tolerance setting, the more
sharpening is applied to the image. For general pho-
tography, use a Tolerance of 4. For portraits, use a
Tolerance of 7 or 8.
Note that the values suggested here are starting points for sharp-
ening images. Much depends on the content of your photos and the
resolution. Experiment by changing values and observing results.
Over-sharpening is easy to see on your monitor and you’ll notice
image degradation when applying too much sharpening. If you
over-sharpen an image, revert to the last save and try again with a
lower amount and radius.
4.
Click OK, and the image is sharpened. In Figure 12-13
you can see an image before and after sharpening.

Preparing Images for
Screen Viewing
W
hatever edits you make to an image, your first task is to deter-
mine the output. When you edit images for screen viewing, the
image requirements for resolution and dimensions can be substantially
different than when editing images you intend to print.
When it comes time to save your files, you need to know which file 
formats to use. For Web graphics, you have two choices: JPEG and GIF.
For other screen views, you need to be certain that the image file format
is compatible with the program you intend to use to display the photos
on-screen.
In addition to preparing static images for screen viewing, Photoshop
Elements also offers you some options for saving files with animated
effects. 
In this chapter, we show you how to save files for Web hosting and how
to take a sneak preview at files you prepare for animation.

Save a JPEG Image for the Web
1.
Open an image in Standard Edit mode.
2.
Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size to open the Image
Size dialog box shown in Figure 13-1.
When you prepare an image for Web hosting, size and sample the
image to a 100-percent size at 72 ppi (pixels per inch). Web browsers
can display images only at 72 ppi. If you save a photo at 144 ppi,
the Web browser doubles the size of the image, thereby reducing the
resolution to 72 ppi.
3.
Select the Resample Image check box and edit the Width
or Height value for a size you want displayed on a Web
page. Change the Resolution to 72 and click OK.
Don’t increase resolution by using the Image Size dialog box. If
your file is too small, you need to go back to an original image,
reshoot the photo, or rescan the image. Upsizing images can
degrade them with obvious distortion.
4.
Choose File➪Save for Web.

Chapter 13: Preparing Images for Screen Viewing

5.
In the Save For Web dialog box (see Figure 13-2), make
choices for the exported file. Among the choices you
need to make are:
• Format: Click the down arrow on the drop-down list
below Preset and select JPEG for the file format.
• Quality: Open the next drop-down list below the file
format selection and choose a Quality. In this example,
we selected Medium. As you make Quality choices,
you can see the results in the right preview image in
the Save For Web dialog box. Your objective is to get
the best image quality with the smallest file size. If you
can lower Quality without showing image degradation,
use the lower settings and the file will be smaller.
• Observe the download time: Below the image pre-
view in the right pane, you can see how long the
image takes to download from the Web to a com-
puter with a 28.8 baud modem. Most users today
will have higher speed connections, so if the amount
of time doesn’t appear extraordinary (10 minutes or
more), you can be assured the file size isn’t going to
overburden a user viewing your Web page.
6.
Click OK, and the Save Optimized As dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 13-3. Navigate to the folder you want
to use for your Web images, type a name for the file in
the File Name text box, and click Save.

for more on changing image sizes).
3.
Choose File➪Save For Web.
4.
Make adjustments for saving a GIF format in the Save For
Web dialog box (see Figure 13-4). Your choices include:
• Format: Select GIF for the file format.
• Colors: Select the number of colors from options
in the Color drop-down list or type a value in the
Colors text box. The range of values is from 1 to 256.
As you reduce the number of colors, Elements dithers
the image to simulate color transitions. As the pre-
view in the right panel reflects your chosen settings,
increase the number of colors if the dithering is so
strong that it degrades the image appearance.
• Transparency: Select the Transparency check box if
you have a file that contains transparency and you
want to preserve the transparent areas.
• Check the download time: Below the image preview
in the right pane, you can see how long the image
takes to download from the Web to a computer with
a 28.8 baud modem. Be certain the download time is
satisfactory.
5.
Click OK, and the Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
6.
Locate the folder where you want to save your image
and type a name in the File Name text box.
7.
Click Save, and the file is saved in GIF format.
Figure 13-4: The Save For Web dialog box
GIF format is best used with files that have a lot of common color or
very few colors. Continuous tone photographs with a wide range of col-
ors are best saved as JPEG. GIF is advantageous when fewer colors are
saved with the image. Saving files with fewer colors results in smaller
file sizes, and smaller files download more quickly from the Web to a
user’s computer.

Printing Images
P
rinting your photos is an inevitable task you’ll perform routinely in
Photoshop Elements. Whether you print your photos on your own
desktop color printer or prepare files for output at professional photo
labs, the preparation of your images is the same. Among some important
considerations for producing good-quality prints are file optimization,
correct color balance, and using appropriate color printer profiles.
In this chapter, we cover all the steps needed to print photos to your own
desktop color printer and how to handle color profiling for output at
commercial photo labs.

Set Up a Color Printer Profile
1.
Open either the Organizer or Standard Edit mode.
2.
Choose Edit➪Color Settings.
3.
Select the Always Optimize for Printing radio button
(see Figure 14-1).
Unless you know that your printer requires another color profile, you
can use the default Adobe RGB (1998) color profile for most print-
ing. In some cases, you’ll want to use a custom color profile, or you
might use a photo center whose lab equipment performs best when
using the sRGB color profile. The equipment or the photo lab you
use dictates these variances. When you select the radio button for
Always Optimize for Printing, the printer uses the Adobe RGB color
profile. Selecting the Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens
radio button embeds the sRGB color profile in your document. 
4.
Open a file in Standard Edit mode.
5.
Choose File➪Save As.
6.
Type a filename in the File Name text box.
7.
Select the check box for ICC Profile: Adobe RGB (1998)
(see Figure 14-2).
8.
Select TIFF (*.TIF, *.TIFF) from the Format drop-down list.
If you save files for output at photo labs, be certain to ask the lab
what profile to use and what file format to select. Many photo labs
might prefer sRGB for the color profile and they might want you to
submit JPEG format.
9.
Click Save, and the file is saved with the Adobe RGB
profile embedded in the document.
If you switch back and forth between screen images and photos for
output to a printer, you can select the Allow Me to Choose option in
the Color Settings dialog box. When you open files, you can choose
a suitable profile to use to convert color.

7.
Select a paper type.
Many color printers let you select a paper type, such as Plain Paper,
Photo Quality Ink Jet, Matte, Glossy, Canvas, and so on. Always
make the proper paper selection. If you select the wrong paper
type, your print might have noticeable problems, such as poor color
saturation, colors out of balance, inks bleeding, and so on.
8.
Select an orientation (Portrait for vertical prints or
Landscape for horizontal prints).
9.
Make other adjustments as needed for your particular
printer and click OK.
You have to set printer properties before you actually print your
document. If you follow the steps here, you can now move to the
Print dialog box and print your document. As an alternative to vis-
iting the Page Setup dialog box, you can instead open print prop-
erties in the Print dialog box by clicking the Properties button.

Create a border around the document to avoid clipping the image
and to ensure that any text added to slides is clearly visible on a TV
screen. The border represents the unsafe area (not TV-safe, that is —
not in view on a TV monitor). The border helps you judge the distance
between the edge of the TV monitor and the objects (such as text)
you want to add to your slides. When adding text, try to provide
ample space away from the outside border so the text doesn’t crowd
the edge of the screen.

Create an HTML Photo Gallery
1.
In the Organizer, select the photos that you want to use
as a photo gallery for a Web page.
The HTML Photo Gallery feature in Elements performs several tasks.
From the photos you select, Elements creates thumbnail images and
prepares a Web page where the images are assembled in a design
you select from template options. The thumbnail images on the
main Web page are linked to individual pages where larger photos
appear, respective to the thumbnail you click on the main page.
Elements does all the Web page creation for you from the HTML
Photo Gallery wizard.
2.
Click Create on the Shortcuts bar.
3.
Select HTML Photo Gallery to open the Adobe HTML
Photo Gallery wizard (see Figure 16-17).

made for Thumbnails and Large Photos. The main Web page where
the mini thumbnails appear is saved as index.html. When
uploading the files, be certain to copy all files and folders and keep
the directory paths the same. In other words, keep all files in the
folders where Elements created them and upload the files and fold-
ers to your Web site.
11.
Open your Web browser to preview the HTML files.
12.
Choose File➪Open in your Web browser and navigate
to the folder containing your Web Photo Gallery. Select
