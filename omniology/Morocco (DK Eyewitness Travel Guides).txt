orocco’s varied geography, 
multicultural atmosphere 
and rich history make it 
a fascinating country. Its towns 
offer a striking contrast of ancient 
kasbahs, mosques and souks 
and modern architecture, with a 
mix of Berber, Arab and African 
peoples. Most major cities are on 
or near the coast in the north; the 
Atlas mountains run like a spine 
from southwest to northeast, 
separating the urban centres 
from the desert. The landscape 
includes beaches, mountains, 
lakes, forests and desert. These 
pages offer a brief overview to 
help you plan your visit.
DISCOVERING MOROCCO
CASABLANCA
• Splendid Art Deco heritage
• The second-largest mosque 
in the world
• Bustling Old Medina
• Strolling around the 
Quartier Habous
Expanded by the French 
from the 1920s onwards, 
Casablanca is now the  
financial capital of Morocco 
and its biggest city.  
Architecturally, the city offers 
an interesting combination  
of Art Deco and the more 
restrained Moorish styles. 
Some of the city’s most 
impressive Art Deco buildings 
can be found in and around 
the Place des Nations Unies 
and the Boulevard  
Mohammed V (see pp98–9) 
in the heart of the new town.
 The colossal Mosque of 
Hassan II (see pp102–3), on 
the seafront, is the second 
biggest in the world, after 
RABAT
• Oudaïa Kasbah fortress
• The majestic Mausoleum  
of Mohammed V
• Impressive Chellah Necropolis
• Ancient artifacts at the 
Musée Archéologique
Morocco’s administrative and 
political capital, Rabat is the 
country’s second-largest city 
after Casablanca. It has a 
relaxed, though cosmopolitan, 
ambience. With its ancient 
ramparts, palace, mosque 
and gardens, the 12th- 
century Oudaïa Kasbah  
(see pp68–9) is the main 
attraction, followed by the 
17th-century medina to the 
south, with its colourful 
souks. Other must-sees are 
the splendid Mausoleum of 
Mohammed V (see pp74–5), 
the Chellah Necropolis (see 
pp80–81) and the impressive 
collections in the Musée 
Archéologique (see pp78–9).
NORTHERN ATLANTIC 
COAST
• Sandy beaches and forests
• Birdwatching at Moulay 
Bousselham
• Lixus’s Phoenician ruins
• Neolithic and Roman sites
The coastline between  
Rabat and Tangier boasts 
some of the finest unspoilt 
beaches in the country, as 
well as lush forests and 
lagoons. The motorway  
follows the coastline,  
offering tempting glimpses  
of the sea. You can see  
cork-oak trees in the Forest 
of Mamora (see p87) and, in 
December and January, 
migratory birds at the Merja 
Zerga lagoon near Moulay 
Bousselham (see p90).
 Morocco was shaped by 
waves of invaders, including 
the Phoenicians, Romans, 
Spanish, Portuguese and 
Dutch. The Roman ruins  
at Thamusida (see p87),  
the ancient Phoenician  
city of Lixus (see pp90–91) 
and the Portuguese town  
of Asilah (see p91) are all 
worth a visit.

This area also features some 
fascinating structures from a 
much earlier time, such as 
the Neolithic stone circle  
at M’Soura (see p91).

SOUTHERN ATLANTIC 
COAST
• Portuguese history at 
El-Jadida
• Surfing at Oualidia
• Beautiful Essaouira
• Hiking around Imouzzer 
des Ida Outanane
This coastline has some 
beautiful deserted beaches 
interspersed with fortified 
towns dating back to the 
period of the Portuguese 
occupation. The region is 
undergoing a period of  
revitalization, with plans for 
hundreds of new hotels  
and apartments.
 El-Jadida (see pp114–15) is 
a small town with a fort and 
a fascinating Portuguese-built 
cistern. Just to the east is the 
impressive 18th-century  
Kasbah Boulaouane (see 
pp112–13), located in the 
heart of a region famous for 
falconry and wine-making.
 Oualidia (see p115) has 
made a name for itself thanks 
to the quality of its oysters.  
It is also a famous surfing 
centre, as is the pretty town 
of Essaouira (see pp120–21). 
Visitors to the city should not 
miss its labyrinthine medina, 
harbour and ramparts.
In the foothills of the High 
Atlas, the Imouzzer des Ida 
Outanane (see pp126–7) 
offers good hiking among 
waterfalls and argan trees.
MEDITERRANEAN 
COAST AND THE RIF
• Riffian towns and villages
• Ceuta and Melilla’s Spanish 
connection
• Holy Chefchaouen
• Birdwatching around the 
Moulouya Estuary
This coast has some beauti- 
ful beaches around Ceuta, 
developing into rocky cliffs 
further towards Melilla. 
Inland, the Rif mountains 
(see pp154–5) run from west 
to east; myriad villages nestle 
among their low hills, with 
higher summits to the east.
 The area has a strong 
Spanish feel, with Ceuta 
(see p147) and Melilla (see 
pp158–9) being Spanish 
territories. More interesting 
are the cities of Tetouan 
(see pp148–9), with its 
successive settlements by the 
Jews, Moors and Spaniards, 
and the holy town of 
Chefchaouen (see pp150–51), 
with its steep, narrow streets 
and limewashed buildings.
 Nature lovers should head 
to the Moulouya Estuary (see 
p159), where a reserve plays 
host to a great variety of birds.
TANGIER
• Tangier’s literary heritage 
and the Café de Paris
• The Dar el-Makhzen palace 
in the Kasbah
• Shopping at the colourful 
Fondouk Chejra
As the main port linking 
Europe and Africa, Tangier 
has a bustling cosmopolitan 
atmosphere. The writers and 
artists who have visited over 
the centuries – from Samuel 
Pepys to William Burroughs, 
from Eugène Delacroix to 
Henri Matisse – have helped 
establish the city’s liberal  
and bohemian credentials.
 The Place de France and 
Place de Faro (see p139) are 
adjacent squares. Famous 
artists and writers would 
gather here, at places like the 
Café de Paris, to sip drinks 
and enjoy the views over  
The typical white-and-indigo 
buildings of Chefchaouen
the medina and the harbour.
The medina is located to the 
northeast of the city, and the 
Kasbah (see p132) is at its 
northern end, along with the 
Dar el-Makhzen palace-
museum and the Kasbah 
Mosque. The Grand Socco 
(Place du 9 Avril 1947) 
(see p138) provides the link 
between the medina and  
the Ville Nouvelle; it hosts  
a busy street market at night.
 The bustling Fondouk 
Chejra (see p138) is like 
an Oriental bazaar packed 
with weavers’ workshops.
the mosque in Mecca, while 
the Old Medina (see p100), 
still surrounded by ramparts, 
gives an idea of the city’s 
humble origins as a tiny  
port. A colourful market is 
held here daily. There is also 
a fishing harbour and a large 
modern port (see p100) with 
excellent fish restaurants.
 With its flower-lined streets 
and souks, the Quartier 
Habous (see p106), also 
known as the New Medina, 
is a pleasant place for a stroll.

MARRAKECH
• Bustling Place Jemaa el-Fna
• The vast Koutoubia Mosque
• Peaceful city gardens
• Grand palaces and museums
Marrakech, the red-walled 
city that gave Morocco its 
name, is set on a plain 
between the Atlas mountains 
and the Sahara. Its origins 
MIDDLE ATLAS
• Mountains, forests and lakes
• Trekking in Jbel Tazzeka 
National Park
• The spectacular Cascades 
d’Ouzoud
This region occupies the 
central area of Morocco and 
features several fortified 
ancient towns. Most visitors, 
however, will be drawn to its 
unspoilt landscape of peaks, 
valleys, lakes and lush forests.
 Good bases from which to 
explore the area include Taza 
(see p210), one of the oldest 
towns in Morocco; Imouzzer 
du Kandar (see p211), with its 
troglodytic dwellings; Ifrane 
(see p212), with its distinctly 
French feel; and Berber-style 
Azrou (see p212).
 With its caverns and gorges, 
Jbel Tazzeka National Park 
(see p210), on the east side of 
the range, offers some spec-
tacular scenery. At the south-
west end of the Middle Atlas, 
the Cascades d’Ouzoud (see 
p221) are worth visiting – not 
just for the waterfall, but also 
for the macaque monkeys 
that have made their home 
in the surrounding fig trees.
MEKNÈS AND VOLUBILIS
• The monumental Bab 
Mansour el-Aleuj arch
• The splendid Mausoleum  
of Moulay Ismaïl
• Moroccan arts at the  
Musée Dar Jamaï
• Ancient ruins at Volubilis
Moulay Ismaïl is to be  
credited for the lavish  
architecture of Meknès (see 
pp186–201), which he built 
as his imperial capital in the 
17th century. The fabulous 
gate of Bab Mansour el-Aleuj 
(see p189) leads to the  
kasbah, which contains the 
finest buildings in the city, 
such as the Mausoleum of 
Moulay Ismaïl (see pp194–5) 
and the Dar el-Makhzen 
royal complex (see pp192–3).
 The medina features many 
fascinating souks, with cloth 
merchants, metalworkers, 
cobblers and a Berber carpet 
bazaar. Other sights include 
the Grand Mosque (see p188) 
and the Musée Dar Jamaï 
(see pp190–91), a museum 
of Moroccan arts with a fine 
Andalusian garden.
 Dating from the 3rd century 
BC, Volubilis (see pp202–5) is 
worth visiting for its extensive 
Roman ruins, including the 
Arch of Caracalla, the  
Basilica and the Capitol,  
as well as the remains of 
Roman houses and mosaics.
FÈS
• World Heritage Site status
• Mosques and medersas
• Workshops and tanneries 
around Place el-Saffarine
• Shopping in the souks
The oldest city in Morocco, 
Fès is also the country’s  
religious and cultural capital. 
Its old town, Fès el-Bali, is a 
UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
It features a rich architectural 
tapestry of fortresses, city 
gates and ramparts; mosques 
and medersas (theological 
schools); palaces and gardens; 
and souks and workshops.
 Visitors should not miss 
the intricately decorated 
14th-century Bou Inania  
Medersa (see pp172–3) and 
El-Attarine Medersa (see 
p171), considered pinnacles 
of Moorish architecture; the 
Karaouiyine Mosque (see 
pp176–7); the Tanners’  
Quarter (see p175) and the 
souks (see p167); and the 
Fondouk el-Nejjarine (see 
p167), a former caravanserai.
 Museums include the 
Musée Dar el-Batha (see 
pp168–9), of interest as 
much for its building and its 
fine Andalusian garden as for 
its collections of local crafts.

OUARZAZATE AND THE 
SOUTHERN OASES
• Ancient towns and ksour
• Camel-riding over the dunes
• Film studios at Ouarzazate
• Scenic kasbahs at Skoura
This region is sandwiched 
between the High Atlas 
mountains to the north and 
the Sahara to the south. 
Ancient towns and ksour 
(fortified villages) are scattered 
along the main roads that 
follow the Draa, Dadès  
and Tafilalt valleys, usually 
featuring crumbling kasbahs, 
markets and workshops. 
Because of its trading history, 
this region has been occupied 
by Berber, Arabs and black 
Moroccans, who still remain.
 You will need several  
days with a guide and a 
four-wheel-drive vehicle to 
explore the region’s gorges, 
including the impressive 
Todra gorge (see p274), and 
longer if you want to get to 
the Sahara and ride a camel 
over the Erg Chebbi dunes 
near Merzouga (see p281). 
Trekkers and rock-climbers 
will also find plenty to keep 
them entertained.
 Less energetic travellers 
may wish to visit the film 
studios at Ouarzazate (see 
p264), or the palm groves 
and beautiful kasbahs at 
Skoura (see p272).
SOUTHERN MOROCCO 
AND WESTERN SAHARA
• Activities on Agadir beach
• Boundless expanses of 
sand dunes
• Birdwatching at Souss 
Massa National Park
• Guelmim’s camel souk
The town of Agadir (see 
pp286–7) was destroyed by 
an earthquake in 1960 and 
has since been rebuilt as the 
main package-holiday resort 
of Morocco. It has modern 
architecture, big hotels, a 
wide range of activities  
and a large sandy bay.
 Agadir is a good base  
for trips to the Souss plains 
to the east, the Anti-Atlas 
mountains to the southeast 
and the disputed territory of 
the Western Sahara to the 
south. The most popular 
excursions are to Taroudannt 
(see p288), with its great 
ramparts and lively souks; 
Tafraoute (see p293) in the 
Ameln Valley, with its lunar 
landscape; Souss Massa 
National Park (see p292),  
for birdwatching; and 
Guelmim (see p294), 
renowned for its camel  
souk and the mysterious 
“blue men” of the desert.
HIGH ATLAS
• Hiking in the Jebel Toubkal 
Massif
• Berber dwellings
• Skiing and mountain-biking
The highest mountain range 
in North Africa runs west– 
east from Jebel Toubkal (see 
p249) – the highest peak at 
4,167 m (13,676 ft) – to Jbel 
Ayachi, towering above the 
Ziz gorges. There are few 
roads here, and the terrain is 
harsh, though every possible 
patch of land is irrigated and 
given over to growing crops 
and grazing livestock.
 This region is the  
mountain stronghold of  
the Berbers, and here it is 
possible to observe their 
subsistence lifestyle. The  
28 villages of the remote  
Aït Bouguemez valley (see 
pp254–7) consist of pisé 
houses made from sun-
baked earth and straw and 
fortified tighremts, larger 
dwellings usually occupied 
by the village chief.
 Oukaïmeden (see p248) is a 
small ski resort that also acts 
as a good base for summer 
mountain-biking and hiking.
were as a staging post on  
the spice route, and the  
bustle of its souks reflects the 
commercial soul of the city.
 On the central square, 
Place Jemaa el-Fna (see 
p234), food-sellers vie for 
your attention, along with 
snake-charmers, jugglers, 
performing monkeys, henna-
painters and professional  
storytellers. The minaret  
of the huge Koutoubia 
Mosque (see pp236–7), built 
in 1147, watches over all.
 Beautiful green spaces  
on the outskirts of the city – 
such as the Menara, Aguedal 
and Majorelle gardens and 
La Palmeraie (see pp242–3) – 
provide a tranquil counter-
point to the general bustle, 
while the Palais Bahia (see 
pp234–5) and the Dar Si Saïd 
Museum (see pp240–41) 
offer a fascinating insight into 
the architecture, culture and 
crafts of this imperial city.

Putting Morocco on the Map
Morocco has many faces. It is situated on the African continent and has  
traces of African heritage. But its climate and varied topography, its historical 
association with Andalusian Spain, and its wish to join the European Union 
give it a European facet. In the distant past it belonged to the indigenous  
Berbers. To the Arabs and Muslims who have held Morocco since the 7th  
century, it is known as Maghreb el-Aqsa – the westernmost country of the 
Muslim world. Morocco has 33,750,000 inhabitants, almost 40 per cent of 
whom are under 15 years old. The population is unevenly distributed over  
the country’s 710,850 sq km (274,388 sq miles), being concentrated along  
the Atlantic coast and in the Rif and the High Atlas mountains.

Morocco is a country that is unique 
in the Muslim world. Its richly diverse 
culture has been shaped by 3,000 
years of history, by ethnic 
groups whose roots go far 
back in time, and also by 
its geographical location, 
with the Atlantic Ocean to 
the west, sub-Saharan Africa 
to the south, Europe to the 
north and the Mediterra-
nean countries to the east.
The Moroccan people are torn  
bet ween the lure of modernity on the 
one hand and a profound desire for 
Islamic reform on the other. 
With events such as the 
death in 1999 of Morocco’s 
sovereign, Hassan II,  
and the enthronement of 
his son and successor, 
Mohammed VI, as well  
as the establishment of a 
left-wing coalition govern-
ment and the problems  
that that government faces 
regarding the economy  
and freedom of the press, Morocco 
today stands on the threshold of a 
challenging new phase in its history.
A PORTRAIT OF MOROCCO
M
orocco is like a tree whose roots lie in Africa but whose 
leaves breathe in European air. This is the metaphor  
that King Hassan II (1929–99) used to describe a country 
that is both profoundly traditional and strongly drawn to the  
modern world. It is this double-sided, seemingly contradictory  
disposition that gives Morocco its cultural richness.

AN EVOLVING SOCIETY
Since the 1950s, Morocco has under-
gone profound social change. Tradi-
tional tribal cohesion  
has been replaced by 
the European-style 
nuclear family,  
polygamy has be-
come distinctly rare, 
a money-based econo-
my is now the norm, 
and the notion of indi-
viduality has emerged. 
These changes have been 
accompanied by a 
growth in the urban popu-
lation and by the rise of a 
bi-cultural elite, with a tradi-
tional background and a  
European outlook. With an 
unusually large percentage of 
young people, Moroccan society is un-
mistakably breaking away from the 
past. However, Morocco still faces the 
challenge of resolving the difficulties 
that sharp contradictions in its social, 
political and economic life present.
Since gaining independence from 
France in 1956, Morocco has made 
attempts to tackle three major  
scourges: illiteracy, unemployment 
and poverty. The government has 
increased spending on education at all 
levels and education is compulsory, 
but many children – particularly girls 
in rural areas – do not attend school. 
Country-wide literacy rates are  
estimated at 39 per cent among 
women and 64 per cent among men, 
but the female literacy rate in rural 
areas is only 10 per cent.
BERBER CULTURE
With its mixed Berber and Arab 
population, Morocco has, 
however, successfully main-
tained ethnic and cultural sta-
bility and equality between 
the Berber and Arabic lan-
guages. Although Tamazight, 
the Berber language, is not 
spoken or taught in schools, 
it is one of the languages 
heard on Moroccan radio 
and television. The move-
ment to promote Berber language and 
culture through the medium of news-

papers, concerts and other cultural 
events is dynamic, as are efforts to en-
courage the wider use of the language 
and to nurture respect for the rich 
Berber culture.
Pilot projects, such as the con-
struction of mosques, wells, roads and 
schools, have been undertaken in the 
southern Souss region, funded by 
money sent back by Berbers of  
southern Morocco working abroad.
THE STATUS OF WOMEN
Women today work in all sectors – as 
political delegates and ambassadors, 
airline pilots, company directors and 
royal advisers; they are also 
Olympic champions, writers, 
publishers, active militants and 
journalists. Thus they have a se-
cure place in Moroccan society.
In the space of 30 years, the 
status and position of women 
has radically changed. The 
constitution of 10 March 1972, 
which granted women the right 
to vote and to be elected, was 
the first of these changes. In 
1994, 77 women were elected 
to the Chamber of Representa-
tives. However, the highly  
militant feminist associations 
were still not entirely satisfied. 
They demanded the abolition 
of the mudawwana – a statute of 1957 
that dominates the lives of Moroccans 
and prevented women from being 
treated as fully fledged adults. Moves 
to raise the status of women made in 
March 1999 were met by opposition 
and incited the wrath of the Minister 
of Religious Affairs, the ulemas 
(councils) and Parliament’s Islamic 
deputies. In 2005, following years of 
resistance from religious bodies, 
Morocco’s king introduced a new 
mudawwana, which has 
improved the status 
of women.
POLITICAL 
CHANGE
Until the death 
of Hassan II in 
1999, Morocco 
was ruled by a 
distant and auto-
cratic king. The 
effect of the attempted coups d’état of 
1971 and 1972 was to encourage the 
Moroccan authorities to control the 
wheels of government even more 
tightly. Driss Basri, then Minister of the 
Interior, was responsible for this 
clamp-down.

At the end of his reign, Hassan II began 
to relax his authoritarian grip on 
power by involving the left wing in the 
country’s government. In February 
1998, a government of national 
unity, led by the Socialist leader 
Abderrahmane Youssoufi, was 
formed, although in the years 
since, its success is deemed to 
have been limited.
Since 1999, Mohammed VI has 
ushered in a new style of govern-
ment. Underlying his political  
approach are a willingness to listen 
more closely to his people and a 
commitment to countering Islamic  
radicals. He also won popular support 
for sacking Driss Basri, Minister of  
the Interior. Brushing aside protocol, 
he has publicly presented his  
new wife and has ordered the  
setting-up of royal commissions to look 
into economic development, the  
problem of the Western Sahara,  
employment and education.
For the September 2002 parliamentary 
election, Morocco had more than 20  
parties, many of which had been  
specially formed. This led to the  
success of the Islamic Party of 
Justice and Development (PJD), 
the third political party in the  
country after the Socialist 
Party (USFP) and the  
Istiqual Party, the principal 
opposition party to the  
coalition government. The 
terrorist bombs of May  
2003 in Casablanca, which 
killed 43 people, brought 
instability to the country, halting the 
progress of democratization started by  
Mohammed VI. However, parliamentary 
elections were again held in 2007.
A VARIED ECONOMY
Morocco’s geographical location, at 
the nexus between Africa and Europe, 
brings it considerable economic 
advantage, especially in the fields of 
tourism, agriculture and the  
textile industry. Moreover, the exten-
sive oil-fields that have been  
discovered in Morocco are large 
enough to supply the country’s 
domestic needs for 35 years.  
Fishing and hydroelectric power  
are Morocco’s other two natural 
resources. The economy also benefits 
from the influx of funds sent back by

Moroccans working abroad. Some  
US $2,000 million are sent back to 
Morocco each year.
The arrival of multinational compa-
nies has transformed telecommunica-
tions and has led to an explosion in 
the use of mobile phones. The number 
of computers has also risen.
Nevertheless, the Moroccan econ-
omy is handicapped in several ways: 
agriculture is dependent on rainfall, 
the education system is inadequate, 
energy costs are prohibitively high, 
and sparse investment is made in the 
population. In 1999, the number of 
people living in poverty stood at  
5 million. Every year, almost 460,000 
rural emigrants swell the poor ghettos 
in the towns and cities. For a number 
of reasons, the economic reforms 
introduced by the government of 
national unity have not had the antic-
ipated effect. Morocco is being 
encouraged by the World Bank to  
liberalize its economy, boost exports 
and devalue its currency.
The country has a positive image in 
Europe, and relations are being con-
solidated. Free trade between Morocco 
and the EU is projected for 2010. The 
arrangement depends on Morocco 
putting in place a solid financial and 
technological infrastructure.
The country is in need of moderniza-
tion, although the evolution of true 
democracy is likely to be slow. This is 
a key policy since the slow progress 
of reforms is encouraging young people 
to emigrate. Under Mohammed VI 
there has been economic liberalization 
but time will tell whether he will suc-
ceed in significantly reducing poverty 
and unemployment, controlling Islamic 
radicals and abolishing illiteracy.

MOUNTAIN FORESTS & HIGH STEPPES
Forests grow in the Rif, the Middle Atlas  
and the western High Atlas, at altitudes  
of 1,400–2,500 m (4,600–8,200 ft), where 
annual rainfall is 650 mm–2,000 mm  
(25–78 in). The varied vegetation here 
includes Atlas cedar, maritime pine and 
holm-oak. The high steppes, covered  
with low, thorny vegetation, are 
found at altitudes over 2,700 m 
(8,860 ft) in the High Atlas 
(see p218–19).
ARID COASTAL REGIONS & DESERT
The rocky coastal lowlands between Safi  
and Agadir has an annual rainfall ranging 
from 40 to 150 mm (1.5 to 6 in). Vegetation, 
which is adapted to saline conditions, consists 
of sparse shrubs, mostly acacia. Further south 
is the desert with ergs (sand dunes) and the 
stony hammada.
The lammergeier 
builds its nest on 
rocky outcrops. It  
is a scavenger but 
sometimes also kills 
its prey by knocking 
it off high rocks 
with a strong flap  
of its wing.

The golden eagle is seen 
mostly in the moun-
tains, where it preys  
on jackals, bustards 
and small mammals.

southwestern Morocco (see p127)
With a mountain range exceeding  
a height of 4,000 m (13,130 ft)  
and a coastline stretching from the 
Mediterranean to the Atlantic, Morocco 
has a varied topography. In environ-
ments ranging from arid scrublands  
to cedar forests and high mountains, 
plant life comprises over 4,000 species 
adapted to extreme conditions. The 
coast is visited by migratory birds while the  
mountains are the habitat of Barbary sheep and  
birds of prey, including the lammergeier (see p219).
The bald ibis, 
almost extinct, is 
found in the Souss 
Massa National 
Park (see p292), a 
fertile exception to 
the arid littoral.

THE MACAQUE  
OR BARBARY APE
The macaque is North Africa’s only monkey. 
Three-quarters of the population lives in the 
cedar forests of the Middle Atlas, up to an 
altitude of 2,000 m (6,565 ft). Macaques are 
also found in the Rif, the High Atlas and on 
the Rock of Gibraltar. The animals live in 
colonies of 10 to 30 individuals, consisting 
of adults and young monkeys of both sexes. 
In summer, they feed on caterpillars, acorns, 
mushrooms and asphodel bulbs. In winter, 
their diet consists of grasses, cedar leaves 
and sometimes bark.

DRY WOODLAND
Almost all the low-lying and middle-altitude 
regions on the northern side of the Atlas are 
covered by dry woodland. Annual rainfall 
here ranges from 350 mm to 800 mm (14 in 
to 31 in) and snowfall is occasional. Trees 
include holm-oak, cork oak (pictured above) 
and kermes oak, olive, Barbary thuya, and 
Aleppo and maritime pine.
SCRUB & STEPPE
Southeastern Morocco consists of steppes 
covered in esparto grass and artemisia. On 
the high plateaux, on the southern slopes of 
the High Atlas and on part of the Anti-Atlas 
annual rainfall ranges from 100 mm to  
300 mm (4 in to 12 in) and snow is rare. 
Trees include Atlas pistachio, juniper and ash.

The Urban Architecture of Morocco
The history of urban architecture in Morocco goes 
back more than 1,000 years. The Karaouiyine  
Mosque in Fès was built in 857 by the first Idrissid 
rulers of Morocco (see p46), who founded the city. 
From the age of the Idrissids until the 20th century,  
a succession of many different architectural styles has 
produced a rich architectural heritage. The artistic 
conventions and styles of each period shed light  
on the secular and religious life of the rulers and  
people who lived in those times.

THE ALMORAVIDS (11TH–12TH C.)
It was under the Almoravids that the Moorish 
style developed in Morocco, which was then 
the centre of an Ibero-Maghrebian empire. 
Andalusian elements included the horseshoe 
arch and the lobed arch, Kufic script, which 
was often used in conjunction with floral  
decoration, the scrolling acanthus-leaf motif 
and the use of decorative plasterwork.
THE ALMOHADS (12TH–13TH C.)
The Almohads, under whom the Ibero-
Maghrebian empire reached its apogee, 
established an architectural style 
that later dynasties were to  
emulate. The Koutoubia Mosque 
in Marrakech, the Hassan II 
Mosque in Casablanca and 
grand monumental gateways 
each exemplify this style.

THE MERINIDS (13TH–15TH C.)
The Merinids used the same building techniques and 
mostly the same architectural forms as those of the  
preceding period. They were, however, the greatest 
builders of medersas (see pp172–3), those peculiarly 
Moroccan masterpieces of architecture. They also  
displayed a remarkable aptitude for exquisite  
architectural ornamentation.

Andalusian traditions that had taken root in Morocco.

THE MODERN ERA
During the French Protectorate, in the early 20th century,  
Nouvelles Villes (modern towns) were built outside the medinas, 
whose traditional layout (see pp26–7) thus was spared from 
development. A Neo-Moorish style evolved in many towns, while 
Art Deco was predominant in the city of Casablanca (see p101).
The Casablanca Post 
Office (1918–20) has  
a loggia decorated 
with zellij tilework.  
The interior is in  
Art Deco style.
The royal mausoleum, in Marrakech,  
is a magnificent building. It was  
completed in the 16th century by  
the sultan Ahmed el-Mansour.
The Mausoleum of Moulay  
Ismaïl (see pp194–5) is  
designed in a style similar  
to that of the Saadian Tombs.

I N T R O D U C I N G  M O R O C C O

Almost all Morocco’s medinas have the 
same layout. The typical medina (meaning 
“town” in Arabic) consists of a densely 
packed urban conglomeration enclosed 
within defensive walls set with lookout 
towers. The tangle of narrow winding 
streets and countless alleyways turns the 
layout of a medina into a labyrinth. The 
centre of the medina is cut through by 
wide avenues running between the main 
gateways and by other main streets,  
which, as a defensive measure, are either angled  
or closed off by houses or projecting walls.
THE LAYOUT OF A MEDINA
Despite their apparent chaos,  
medinas are laid out according to 
certain set considerations. The 
mosque is always located at the 
heart. Other features include 
the separation of different 
religious and ethnic  
groups, the distinction 
between home and the workplace, 
and the location of activities according  
to a social and commercial hierarchy. Every 
medina is laid out according to these factors.
Open-air souks, like the basket souk in 
Marrakech, are markets where  
specialist crafts and other products are 
sold. Souks are also the regular  
meeting places of city people and  
visiting country-dwellers.
The monumental gateway, a fortified entrance 
flanked by projecting crenellated towers, leads 
into the medina. Bab el-Chorfa in Fès is a  
particularly splendid example.

QUARTERS
The quarters of a medina are no more than loosely 
defined areas. A quarter, or hawma, is really just a 
communal space consisting of several small streets 
and alleyways, and it is the 
focus of the inhabitants’  
material and spiritual life. Each 
quarter has a communal oven,  
a hammam (steam bath), a 
Koranic school, and a grocer’s 
shop, which is always located 
in one of the smaller streets. 
The shop sells such basic 
necessities as vegetables,  
fruit, oil, coal, sugar, spices  
and other foods. There are  
no shops selling luxury  
goods in quarters like these.

Workshops in the 
souks, like the dyers’ 
souk in Marrakech,

tiny. The craftsman  
has only just enough 
space to make and  
sell his products.
The grand mosque  
is the central point 
of the city.
Sturdy defensive walls 
protect the medina.
The souk for  
valuable items  
is located next  
to the mosque.
Craftsmen, like the tanners of Fès, work 
together in parts of the medina known as 
souk, kissaria or fondouk. Their location, 
from the centre to the periphery, depends  
on the craft’s rarity and its pollution level.
The patio, or riad, like this one  
in Essaouira, is the focal point  
of a building. The rooms are 
arranged around the courtyard, 
which often contains a fountain.

LEATHERWORK
Leatherworking has always been a major industry in  
Morocco, particularly in Fès, Meknès, Rabat, Salé and  
Marrakech. The leather-
workers and tanners of 
Marrakech and Fès, whose 
numerous workshops fill 
the picturesque quarters  
of the medina, are those 
with the most illustrious 
reputation. Tanners first 
clean the hide – either 
sheepskin or goatskin – and then dye it red, yellow or 
orange. Gold-leaf decoration may also be applied. The 
leatherworkers then fashion the material into utilitarian or 
decorative objects such as pouffes, handbags, babouches 
(slippers) and desk sets.
WOODWORK
The traditional craft of woodworking is centred mostly in 
Essaouira, Fès, Meknès, Salé, Marrakech and Tetouan. The 
many different kinds of wood used by Moroccan wood-
workers and cabinet-makers come from the forests of the 
Atlas and the Rif. Cedar and walnut are used mostly by  
cabinet-makers, who are highly skilled makers of carved  
or studded doors, and also in the construction of wooden 
ceilings. Ebony and citrus wood are used for marquetry  
and veneering. Thuya, with its beautiful rosewood hue,  
can be made into elegant furniture and decorative objects.
The custom of producing utilitarian objects  
that are visually pleasing and enlivened with 
decoration is a deeply rooted tradition among 
Moroccan craftsmen. They inject beauty into the 
humblest of materials, from leather, wood and 
clay, to copper and wool. The importance given 
to decoration is often so great that it sometimes 
takes precedence over the object to which it is applied.  
The endless interplay of arabesques, interlacing patterns, 
beguiling floral motifs and intricate inscriptions are an  
integral part of traditional Moroccan life.

CARPETS 
Carpets are a ubiquitous part of the furnishings of the 
Moroccan home (see p348). City-made carpets, woven 
mostly in Rabat and Médiouna, are characterized by 
bright colours and a pattern consisting of a rectangular 
field on a red background, framed by bands of edging 
and with geometric motifs. Symmetry is a central feature 
of carpets made in Rabat. Village carpets, which are 
either woven or knotted, are 
produced in the Middle and 
High Atlas, in Marrakech and  
in Haouz. They have more 
imaginative patterns, such as 
animal, plant and architectural 
motifs, which the weavers 
(mostly women) themselves 
devise. Weaving and knotting 
techniques vary according to 
region, and the various types 
of village carpets are referred 
to by their place of origin, 
such as Middle Atlas, High 
Atlas, Haouz or Marrakech.
POTTERY
Decorated pottery is an integral part of 
everyday domestic life. Jugs, dishes 
and bowls are seen in every  
Moroccan kitchen and living  
room. Fès, one of the 
most important centres 
of pottery production, is 
renowned for its pottery – 
blue and white and multi-
coloured on a white base. 
Safi, whose potting  
industry is more recent, 
produces pieces characterized by shimmering  
colours. Local tradition dictates shape, colour, glaze 
and type of decoration. Meknès and Salé are two 
other important centres of pottery manufacture.

COPPER AND BRASS
Copper and brass are metals that  
lend themselves to being cut, 
hammered, embossed,  
inlaid and engraved. The 
repertoire of the Moroccan  
coppersmith ranges from the 
humblest domestic objects to 
the most ostentatious, such as 
inlaid or panelled doors, trays 
and chandeliers. This craft 
reveals a highly developed skill 
and a love of intricate detail,  
and follows an ancient tradition.

Morocco’s official religion is the orthodox, or  
Sunni, sect of Islam. It is based on the Koran  
and the Sunna, in which the words and deeds of the 
Prophet Mohammed are recorded. It is this religion, 
which was introduced to Morocco in the 7th century, 
that underpins both the country’s law and its faith. 
Islam is also the unifying force in the daily life of 
every Moroccan, whose duty it is to respect the  
Five Pillars of Islam. These are chahada (profession  
of faith), salat (prayer), zakat (ritual almsgiving), 
Ramadan (fasting) and hadj (the pilgrimage to 
Mecca). The king of Morocco is both the country’s 
secular and spiritual leader. On his accession to the 
throne in 1999, Mohammed VI strongly reaffirmed  
this double prerogative.
The Islamic Faith in Morocco
Ritual ablutions 
must be performed 
before prayers. The 
courtyards of 
mosques always 
contain fountains 
and basins, with 
hammams (steam-
baths) nearby. The 
Islamic faith places 
great importance 
on personal 
cleanliness.

KORAN IN MAGHREBI SCRIPT
The Koran, the holy pronouncements 
of Allah dictated to the Prophet 
Mohammed, is central to Islamic  
faith. Islamic calligraphy, a major art 
form in the Muslim world, is highly  
stylized and combines perfect  
legibility with visual harmony  
and colourful illumination.
Maghrebi calligraphy,  
characteristic of North  
Africa, is derived from the 
more austere Kufic script.

FRIDAY PRAYERS
The five daily prayers (salat) 
form part of the five obligations,  
or “pillars”, of Islam that are 
incumbent on Muslims. The 
faithful are required to come  
to the mosque for the midday 
prayers that are said every  
Friday. On this day devoted  
to Allah they also hear a  
sermon delivered by the  
khotba, or preacher. The 
gathering at Friday prayers  
also reinforces the sense of 
belonging that Muslims  
have in their community.
ISLAMIC FESTIVALS
The Muslim calendar is based 
on the lunar year, which is a  
little shorter than the solar year 
(see p41). The ninth month, 
Ramadan, is a time of fasting. 
Aïd el-Fitr, or Aïd es-Seghir, 
marks the end of Ramadan, and 
at Aïd el-Adha, or Aïd el-Kebir, 
a sheep is sacrificed in memory 
of the sacrifice of Abraham. 
Mouloud commemorates the 
birth of the Prophet Mohammed.
Daily prayer consists of a series of recitations 
and prostrations. Kneeling in rows, on a  
strictly egalitarian basis, the faithful face the 
direction of Mecca. This direction is called 
qibla, and it is symbolized by the mihrab, a 
niche in the wall of the mosque. The imam, 
who leads the prayers, kneels in front.
Muslim prayer beads consist 
of a string of 33 or 99 beads 
separated by markers. Muslims 
use the beads to recite the 99 
names or attributes of Allah.

Two out of every three Moroccans are, in  
cultural and linguistic terms, Berber. Thought 
to be the descendants of people of mixed  
origins – including Oriental, Saharan and  
European – the Berbers settled in Morocco  
at different times, and they do not make up  
a homogeneous race. By finding refuge in 
mountainous regions, they survived several 
successive invasions – those of the civilizations of the 
Mediterranean basin, of the Arabs, then, much later, 
those of the French and the Spaniards. The Berbers still 
speak several dialects and maintain distinct cultural  
traditions. They are renowned for their trading activities 
and for the strength of their tribal and family ties.
Veils of many colours 
cover the women of  
the Tiznit region.
Young girls do 
not wear veils. 
Only when they 
reach adulthood 
do girls cover 
their face.

the top of the head, 
as their mothers do.
The hendira,  
a striped cape 
woven on a 
simple loom, 
is the typical 
overgarment 
worn by Berber 
women.
The grand souk at the 
moussem of Imilchil  
is both a social and a 
commercial gathering.  
It is an opportunity for 
Berbers from all over  
the Atlas Mountains to 
buy all that they need  
for the year ahead.
Henna patterns, which Berber women paint on 
themselves, give protection against supernatural 
forces. Besides keeping evil spirits away, they are 
supposed to purify and beautify the wearer. On feast 
days, women decorate their hands and their feet.
The fouta is a rectangular 
piece of fabric with red 
and white stripes. It is 
worn with a conical straw 
hat by women of the Rif.

BERBER TRIBES
Although Berber 
tribal structure is 
complex, three 
groups, each  
with their own  
histories, can  
be identified.  
The Sanhaja, 
nomadic herdsmen 
originating from 
the south, inhabit 
the central and 
eastern High  
Atlas, the Middle 
Atlas and the Rif. They speak the  
dialects of the Tamazight group.  
The Masmouda, settled farmers,  
live mostly in the western High  
Atlas and the Anti-Atlas, and they 
speak the Chleuh dialect. It was a 
Masmoudian tribe that founded the 
Almohad empire in the 12th century.
 The Zenets are hunters and herds-
men who came from the East and  
settled in eastern Morocco. They 
speak the dialect of the Znatiya 
group. They founded the Merinid 
dynasty in the 13th century.
RELIGIOUS MOUSSEMS
For Berber women, religious moussems 
(see pp38–41) are occasions when they 
sometimes travel far from home. This is an 
opportunity for them to meet other women,  
to sing and dance, and to get away from  
their everyday chores.
This amber and 
silver necklace, 
from the 
Taliouine region 
of the Anti-  
Atlas, is part  
of the attire  
traditionally worn 
on feast days.
The jellaba, an 
ankle-length 
robe with long 
sleeves and a 
hood, is worn 
over a wide-
sleeved shirt  
by Berber men  
of the Atlas 
mountains. The 
turban is also 
part of Berber 
men’s tradition-
al attire.

A mule is a prized possession among the 
Berbers. It is used as a beast of burden, to 
carry such heavy loads as fodder, sacks  
of grain and containers of water.
The situla, a 
copper vessel  
of distinctive 
shape, is  
used by the 
women of  
the Igherm 
region in the 
Anti-Atlas to

Two thousand years ago, at the time  
of the Phoenician, Carthaginian 
and Roman invasions, the first 
horses to be used in Morocco 
were cross-bred with Mongolian 
stock. The Arab horse was intro-
duced to Morocco by the Arab 
conquest in the 7th century and, 
used in war, it played an important 
part in the establishment of Islam here. Today,  
owning horses is considered to be a sign of wealth 
in rural areas. Horses are shown off at festivals, 
especially in the performance of fantasias (displays 
of horsemanship), and are also used in daily life.
STUDS
There are national studs in  
Meknès, El-Jadida, Marrakech, 
Oujda and Bouznika. Their  
purpose is to promote the breed-
ing of horses and to produce 
horses for racing, for equestrian 
sports and for fantasias. In  
Morocco today there are  
180,000 horses, 550,000 mules 
and 1 million donkeys. To en-
courage horse-breeding, stallions 
are made available to breeders 
free of charge to cover their 
mares. On average, 15,000 mares 
are put to a stallion and 5,000 
foals are registered every year.
Tall embroidered leather  
boots and loose white short 
breeches are worn by riders  
in a fantasia.
Horse harness, brightly coloured  
and made of sumptuous materials,  
is made by skilled and specialized 
craftsmen. The severe bit allows the 
rider to stop abruptly and steer his 
mount deftly. The blinkers protect the 
horses’ eyes from sand and smoke.
The Barb, a type of horse used  
by the Berbers before the arrival of 
the Arabs, is strong, compact and 
capable of covering long distances.
Thoroughbreds are  
used for racing. The  
racing season runs  
from September to May.

FANTASIAS
Fantasias are displays of horsemanship 
that are performed according to precise 
rules. Galloping at full speed down a 
course 200 m (650 ft) long, the riders 
whirl their guns in the air and, at a 
signal from their leader, fire them  
in unison.
The fantasia saddle,  
with typically elaborate 
decoration, consists of  
a wooden framework 
sheathed in goatskin. It is 
covered in embroidered 
silk and rests on several 
layers of woven saddle-
cloths decorated with 
pompoms. The high  
pommel and back 
restraint keep the rider 
securely in place.
Fantasia horses, 
which are at least 
four years old, are 
Barb or Arabian 
Barb stallions.
The pure-bred Arab was introduced to 
Morocco in the 7th century. Its elegance and 
beauty, as well as its capacity for endurance, 
make it one of the world’s best-loved horses.
The Arabian Barb, an agile and robust horse, was 
produced by crossbreeding Arabs and Barbs in the 
7th century. It is a saddle horse particularly well  
suited to the fantasia.
The mule, a robust beast 
of burden, is more 
widely used than the 
horse. Here, its 
owner perches on 
a pack-saddle 
made out of 
thick blankets.
At the moussem of Sidi Abdallah Amghar, 
in El-Jadida, horses are bathed in the sea 
at dawn. Later in the day, in the fierce 
August heat, they will perform the  
galloping charges of the fantasia.
Large stirrups made of sheet 
metal or leather are attached  
to the saddle by stirrup-leathers.

This golden diadem from Fès 
consists of hinged plates that 
are decoratively pierced  
and set with many 
precious 
stones.
Traditional dress indicates the wearer’s 
geographical origin and social status.  
Berber women wrap themselves in 
rectangular pieces of fabric, secured by 
a brooch and a belt, while the men wear 
a jellaba and a burnous against the cold. 
In towns, the elegant kaftan, a long garment 
with buttons down the front, has become 
standard formal wear for women, who 
increasingly often dress in the Western style. Jewel-
lery has long been made by Jewish craftsmen. Berber 
jewellery is made of silver, sometimes with the addi-
tion of coral and amber; necklaces, bracelets and 
brooches may simply be decorative, or may be a status 
symbol or an heirloom. Gold, sometimes inlaid with 
precious stones, is the material of city-made jewellery.
Zemmour women of the  
Middle Atlas wear a belt in  
the form of a long plaited  
and twisted cord decorated 
with pompoms.
Cherbils, velvet slippers 
embroidered with gold 
thread, elegantly curved 
and with pointed toes, 
 are an essential part of a 
woman’s feast-day dress.
Berber women, on feast days, 
don more elaborate headwear. 
The shape often indicates the 
wearer’s status, either as a 
married woman or as an 
unmarried girl.
The shape of the 
sleeves and of the 
neck-opening  
varies from one 
kaftan to the next.

KAFTANS
The women’s kaftan, an ankle-length,  
tunic-like garment, collarless and with  
wide sleeves, is always made of such fine 
fabric as silk, satin, velvet or brocade. It  
is often worn with a mansourya, a light, 
transparent overgarment made of silk  
that sets off the kaftan. The garments  
are secured at the waist by a wide belt 
embroidered with silk and gold thread.
Embroidery, decorating kaftans, belts and 
jellabas, is an integral part of women’s  
clothing. The patterns, such as geometric, 
floral and animal motifs, the colours and  
the materials used are different in every city.
Coral, amber and 
shells, combined 
with silver, are 
strung together to 
make attractive 
necklaces, which 
are worn proudly 
by Berber women.
This young bride 
wears a kaftan  
and, over it, a  
luxuriant veil, which  
is traditional in Fès.
For special  
occasions, women 
may wear a gold or 
silver belt. Silver is 
most usually worked 
by being liquefied 
and poured into a 
mould, but it may 
also be beaten into 
sheets, cut to shape, 
and then incised  
or engraved.
Tiny buttons made 
of silk or gold 
thread are sewn 
down the front of 
the kaftan.
Gold lace
In rural areas, older men  
still wear a voluminous  
jellaba with pointed hood. 
The garment is made of 
handwoven woollen cloth, 
which is either of one colour 
or with patterned stripes.

uslim feast days, agricultural 
festivals and moussems  
(pilgrimage-festivals) 
punctuate the Moroccan year. 
Because the Muslim calendar 
is lunar, the dates of religious 
festivals are never fixed. After 
the harvests of early summer 
and during the autumn, lively 
festivals at which the local 
produce is fêted are held in 
every region of the country. 
More than 600 moussems take 
place each year in Morocco; 
besides the pilgrimage to the 
tomb of a saint, there is large 
regional souk, singing and 
dancing, and sometimes a  
fantasia. The month of Ramadan 
is a major religious occasion; 
then, the inactivity of the  
daylight hours, when fasting 
is required, is followed by 
joyful night-time festivities.
SPRING
If rainfall is not scarce, 
spring in Morocco is a  
remarkable season. In the 
space of a few days, the  
dry ochre earth becomes  
carpeted in flowers of every 
hue and the mountainsides 
are flushed with the pale 
green of new barley. The 
high peaks, however, are  
still covered in snow. In the 
Saharan south, spring is 
much like summer. It is al-
ready warm enough to swim 
in the Mediterranean and off 
the southern Atlantic coast.

SUMMER
In summer the only parts of 
the country that are spared 
high temperatures are the 
coasts, which are cooled by 
sea breezes, and the Atlas 
mountains. This is not the 
best time to tour the inner 
countryside or visit inland 
towns and cities. In the  
Saharan south, the sky 
becomes leaden with the 
heat, and elsewhere the 
medinas are stifling. Despite 
this, the start of summer is 
marked by many festivals.

WINTER
The best time to explore 
Morocco’s Saharan region is 
in the winter. The days are 
sunny and the sky is a deep 
blue but the nights are cold. 
On the coasts, the tempera-
ture remains mild. By contrast, 
the valleys of the High Atlas 
can receive heavy snowfalls 
and may be inaccessible. In 
February, the almond trees  
of the Tafraoute valley are 
covered in blossom. Few  
festivals take place in winter.

RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS
The dates of Muslim festivals are set according to the lunar calendar of the Hegira (the 
beginning of the Muslim era in 622). The Muslim year is 10 or 11 days shorter than that 
of the Gregorian calendar. Religious festivals also take place 11 days earlier each year  
in relation to the Western calendar. Guided by the phases of the moon, the religious 
authorities wait until the last moment before deciding on the exact date of each festival.
Moharem: Muslim New Year.
Achoura: traditional almsgiving (zakat) to the poor; presents are also given to children.
Mouloud (aïd al-wawlid): anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Mohammed. Many 
moussems also take place at the same time as Mouloud, and their dates are therefore different 
each year. Among the most important are the moussem of Moulay Brahim, near Marrakech, 
that of Moulay Abdessalam ben Mchich, in the north, the moussem of Sidi Mohammed 
ben Aïssa, of Sidi Ali ben Hamdouch, the 
Candle Festival in Salé and the moussem 
of Moulay Abdelkader Jilali.
Ramadan: practising Muslims fast for  
a month, eating only after sunset.
Aïd es-Seghir (“the small festival”), also 
known as Aïd el-Fitr: festival marking  
the end of the 30-day fast of Ramadan.
Aïd el-Kebir (“the grand festival”), also 
known as Aïd el-Adha: this festival,  
taking place 68 days after Aïd es-Seghir, 
commemorates the day when, by divine 
order, Abraham prepared to sacrifice his 
son Isaac, when Allah interceded by  
providing a ram in place of the child. 
Every household sacrifices a sheep  
and shares the meat at a family meal.

The Climate of Morocco
Bordered by the Atlantic and the  
Mediterranean, joined to the African  
continent by the Sahara, and diagonally 
bisected by the long mountain chain of  
the High and Middle Atlas, Morocco does 
not have a uniform climate. It is cooled by 
moist northwesterly winds and seared by 
hot, dry southeasterlies such as the chergui. 
In summer, conditions are those of a hot  
arid zone. In winter, which is very mild 
except in the mountains, conditions switch 
to those of a temperate coastal zone. Water 
is in relatively short supply everywhere and 
agriculture, involving about 40 per cent of 
the economically active population, is  
acutely dependent on adequate rainfall.

orocco is an ancient kingdom. It came under the influence 
of Carthage and Rome, but its origins are Berber, Arab and 
African. Since the arrival of Islam in the 7th century, the 
country has been an independent power, and at times an empire. The 
only Arab country not to have fallen to the Ottomans, it entered the 
modern era under the Alaouite dynasty at the end of the colonial period.
For 40,000 years Morocco has been 
a bridge between the East, Africa 
and Europe. Archaeological finds 
and rock engravings prove that it 
was settled in the remote past. 
but little is known of the first 
Berbers, who may have 
come from the east.
 The Phoenicians, fearless 
navigators, established tra-
ding posts – such as Russaddir 
(Melilla) and Lixus (Larache) – 
along the Moroccan coast. 
They also introduced iron-
working and the cultiva-
tion of vines.
 In the 5th century BC, 
Hanno, a naval commander 
from Carthage (in modern 
Tunisia), set out to explore 
the Atlantic coast westwards, 
and soon the trading posts 
were taken over and de- 
veloped by Carthage. Under 
their influence, the Berber tribes 
eventually joined forces and estab-
lished the kingdom of Mauretania.
 In 146 BC, having destroyed 
Carthage, the Romans extended their 
control westwards over the northern 
half of Morocco. Emperor Augustus 
made Tingis (Tangier) a Roman city. 
In 25 BC, the kingdom of Mauretania 
was entrusted to Juba II, king of 
Numidia. A Berber ruler who had 
been Romanized and educated, he 
married the daughter of 
Antony and Cleopatra. 
Ptolemy, Juba’s son and 
heir, was murdered in 
AD 40 on the orders  
of Emperor Caligula. 
Emperor Claudius later 
annexed the kingdom, 
dividing it into Mauretania 
Caesariensis (west Algeria) 
and Mauretania Tingitana 
(Morocco). The Romans esta-
blished few new towns here, 
but developed the existing 
ones, among them Tangier, 
Volubilis, Lixus, Banasa, Sala 
and Thamusida. The southern 
frontier lay at the level of 
Rabat. In the 3rd century, 
however, Christianity began 
to spread and Roman domina-
tion was severely diminished.
 The Vandals, whose king Genseric 
(428–77) conquered North Africa, fol-
lowed by the Byzantines, maintained 
a lasting presence only at a few points 
along the Mediterranean coast.  
Religious unrest and local uprisings 
gradually extinguished the hold of 
all the ancient civilizations.

THE HISTORY OF MOROCCO

I N T R O D U C I N G  M O R O C C O
4 6
ARRIVAL OF ISLAM
From the end of the 7th century, a 
new set of invaders, and with them  
a new religion, began to make its mark 
on Morocco. The Arabs had started  
to expand their rule westwards, and 
in 681 there was a first attempt into 
Morocco. But the true conqueror of 
Morocco was Moussa ibn Nosaïr, who, 
active from 705, brought the territory 
from Tangier to the Draa valley under 
the control of the Ummayyad caliph 
in Damascus. With some resistance, 
Islam was introduced to the Berber 
population. Quickly rallying a mainly 
Berber army, Moussa then turned his 
attention to Europe, initiating the con-
quest of Spain in 711.
 Reacting against their haughty Arab 
overlords, the Berbers of the Maghreb 
rebelled against them and, usually but 
not always, against Islam. Battles with 
troops sent from the East continued for 
more than 30 years, from 739 to 772. 
Petty kingdoms were formed and the 
western Maghreb kept the power of 
the caliphs at bay.
THE IDRISSID DYNASTY 
(789–926)
Meanwhile, Islam 
divided itself into 
two main sects: 
Sunni and Shia. In 
786, the Sunnite Ummayad 
caliph crushed the Shi’ite 
Muslims. One of them, Idriss 
ibn Abdallah, escaped the 
massacre and was received in 
Morocco as a prestigious reli-
gious leader. In 789, the 
Aouraba, a Berber tribe in 
Volubilis, made him their 
leader. Idriss I carved out a 
small kingdom, and set about 
building a new city, Fès. He 
died soon afterwards, probably poi-
soned by an envoy of the caliph. His 
son, Idriss II (793–828), succeeded him 
and made Fès the Idrissid capital. The 
Idrissids are considered to be the 
founding dynasty and the first of 
Morocco’s seven ruling dynasties.
 Fès soon became densely populated 
and a prestigious religious centre. At 
the death of Idriss II, the kingdom was 
divided between his two sons, then 
between their descendants. They were 
unable to prevent the simultaneous 
attacks of the two powerful rivals of 
the Abbassid caliph, the Shi’ites of 
Tunisia and Egypt, and the Ummayyad 
caliphs of Córdoba in Andalusia – 
Sunnis who for long fought over Fès 
and the allegiance of the Berber tribes.
THE ALMORAVIDS (1062–1147)
An unexpected push came from the 
south. A tribe of nomadic Sanhadja 
Berbers, based in present-day  
Mauritania and converts to Islam in 
the 9th century, were to give rise to a 
powerful new empire. The 
tribe’s headman, Yahia  
ibn Ibrahim, invited a 
holy man to preach 
the Islamic faith to 
his people. A forti-
fied camp, or ribat, 
was built on the 
705 Moussa ibn Nosaïr  
conquers Morocco.

estuary of the Senegal river. In 1054, 
“the people of the ribat” (the al 
Mourabitoun, or Almoravids), fighters 
for a pure Islamic state, launched a 
holy war northward as far as the Atlas. 
The founder of the Almoravid empire 
was Youssef ibn Tachfin (1061–1107), 
who proclaimed himself Leader of 
the Faithful. Having founded Marra-
kech, which became Morocco’s  
second capital, in 1062, he conquered 
the country as far north as Tangier 
and in 1082 as far east as Algiers.
 In Al-Andalus (Andalusia), the fall of 
the Umayyad caliphate of Córdoba in 
1031 led to the creation of taifas, 
small Muslim principalities. Alfonso 
VI, King of Castile and León, led the 
Christian Reconquest, taking Toledo 
in 1085. In response to a call for aid 
from the taifas, Youssef ibn Tachfin 
crossed the strait and routed Alfonso 
VI’s forces at the Battle of Badajoz in 
1086. He soon extended his empire 
as far north as Barcelona. In the 
south, Almoravid influence stretched 
to the Senegal and the Niger (1076).
 The empire was unified by the 
orthodox, Sunni branch of Islam. On 
the death of Youssef ben Tachfine, 
his son Ali, whose mother was an 
Andalusian Christian, succeeded him. 
During his long reign (1107–43) the 
refined culture of Andalusia took  
hold in Morocco, although the empire 
itself was in decline. More Andalusian 
than Moroccan, the last Almoravids fled 
to Spain to escape a new rebellion 
from the south, that of the Almohads.

Morocco and Al-Andalus
For almost eight centuries – from  
711, when Tariq ibn Ziyad and  
his Berber forces crossed the Straits  
of Gibraltar to reach Spain, to the  
fall of the Nasrid kingdom of  
Granada in 1492 – the Iberian 
peninsula was partly under  
Muslim control. Muslim territory, 
known as Al-Andalus (the Land of the Vandals), 
was at times a melting pot of Muslims, Jews 
and Mozarabs (Christians adopting an Islamic 
lifestyle), philosophers, traders, scientists and 
poets. This gave birth to the most illustrious 
civilization of the late Middle Ages.

Irrigation
Under the Umayyad caliphs and their Berber  
successors, irrigation in Andalusia underwent  
a dramatic advance. The introduction of the 
noria, a waterwheel for the mechanical extraction 
of water – shown here in a 13th-century  
manuscript – was to change, permanently,  
the method of water distribution in Spain.

King Boabdil’s Farewell
Painted by the Orientalist  
Alfred Dehodencq (1822–82), 
this famous scene from Spanish 
history is redolent with nostalgia 
but is probably spurious. It 
depicts the fall of the last Moorish 
kingdom in Andalusia, that of 
the Nasrids of Granada, in 1492. 
Al-Andalus was to acquire a 
mythical aura in the minds of  
the Moorish communities who 
fled the Iberian peninsula during 
the Reconquest. In architecture, 
daily life, cuisine, music and 
vocabulary, Andalusian culture 
lives on in Moroccan towns  
cities to this day.

MINARETS
After the end of the  
independant Cordoban 
caliphate, Almoravids and 
Almohads directly controlled 
Al-Andalus, where their  
monumental architecture  
flourished. The architectural 
heritage of Al-Andalus, above 
all of religious architecture,  
is a clear expression of  
Andalusian culture. The  
striking similarity between the 
minarets of the three mosques 
built by the Almohads in  
Marrakech, Rabat and Seville 
demonstrates the unity of the 
Almohad architectural style.

JUDAISM IN MOROCCO
Inscriptions in Hebrew dating from the Roman period show that there 
has been a Jewish community in Morocco since antiquity. It was 
involved chiefly in agriculture, stock-farming and trade. Judaism  
flourished thanks to the conversion of the Berber tribes and to the 
immigration of Jews fleeing from the east and from Spain. When Fès 
was founded, a Jewish community settled there, and scholars and 
rabbis travelled throughout the country. Although strictures imposed 
by the Almoravids and Almohads caused some Jews to emigrate, 
they flourished once again under the Merinids and Wattasids, who 
welcomed thousands of Jews expelled from Spain after 1492. The 
Alaouite sultans also protected them. Although their numbers are 
reduced, Jews hold certain influential positions in Morocco today.

THE ALMOHADS AND THE APOGEE  
OF THE WESTERN MUSLIM EMPIRE
In 1125, after a life devoted to study 
and to travelling in the Muslim world, 
Ibn Toumart, a Berber man of letters, 
settled in Tin Mal, a narrow valley in 
the High Atlas. A religious puritan 
driven by the doctrine of unity, he de- 
clared himself the 
mahdi (messiah) 
and, in opposition to 
the increasingly de- 
cadent Almoravids, 
began preaching 
moral reform. On 
his death, his succes-
sor Abd el-Moumen 
assumed the title of 
Leader of the Faith-
ful. In 1146–7 he 
took control of the 
main cities of the 
Almoravid empire, 
including Marra-
kech, Fès and the great cities of  
Al-Andalus. Now the leader of the 
greatest empire that ever existed in the 
Muslim west, he went about central-
izing it and reorganizing its army, 
administration and economy. He 
imposed taxes and land surveys, cre-
ated a navy, founded universities and 
enlisted the support of the great Arab 
dynasties. With such thinkers as Ibn 
Tufaïl and Averroës (see p231), intel-
lectual life flourished. In 1162, Abd el-
Moumen, founder of the Almohad 
dynasty, proclaimed himself caliph. 
The dynasty was at its peak during his 
reign, and that of his grandson Yacoub 
el-Mansour (“the Victorious”, 1184–99).
 But over the following decades the 
dynasty declined. The combined  
forces of the Spanish Christian princes 
inflicted a heavy defeat on Mohammed 
el-Nasser at the Battle of Las Navas de 
Tolosa. With the fall of Córdoba in 
1236 and of Seville in 1248, the Mus-
lims lost Spain, with only the small 
Nasrid kingdom of Granada surviving 
until 1492. The last Almohad sultans, 
who were reduced to the Maghreb, 
were challenged by dissidents: the 
Hafsids – Almohads who established 
their own dynasty (1228–1574) in 
Tunisia and western 
Algeria – and the 
Abdelwadid Berbers 
in Tlemcen in 1236.
 In the south, the 
Almohads lost con-
trol of Saharan trade 
routes, while at the 
very heart of the  
kingdom, the Meri-
nids, the Almohads’ Berber allies of 
the high plateaux, defied their author-
ity. The cycle described by the great 
Maghrebi historian Ibn Khaldoun (see 
p181), in which over the centuries 
simple nomads wrench power from 
corrupt city-dwellers, and who are 
themselves overthrown, began again.
 The age of the Almohads, a period 
of unequalled splendour, has left a 
lasting impression on Morocco: a form 
of Islam that is both spiritual and pre-
cisely defined, a makhzen (central

power) to control tribal self-determi-
nation, and a great urban Moorish 
civilization that is still in evidence.
THE MERINIDS (1248–1465)
Under the Merinids, Morocco was 
gradually reduced to the territory that 
it covers today. Unsuccessful on the 
battlefield, the Merinids were, however, 
inspired builders, and during their rule 
a brilliant urban civilization came into 
being. Led by Abou Yahia, these Zenet 
Berber nomads took control of the 
major cities and fertile plains from 
1248, although it was not until 1269 
that they conquered Marrakech, thus 
putting an end to the Almohad  
dynasty. Fès, which had been made 
capital by Abou Yacoub Youssef, expe-
rienced a new phase of expansion.
 Despite some minor victories, the 
Merinids were unsuccessful in their 
attempts to reconquer territory on the 
Iberian peninsula. In 1415, the Portu-
guese, led by Henry the Navigator, 
took Ceuta. However, Abou el-Hassan 
(the “Black Sultan”) managed to re-
establish temporary order and unity in 
the Maghreb. He and his successor, 
Abou Inan, were great rulers and great 
builders. But crises of succession grad-
ually undermined their authority, and 
the Wattasids, another Zenet Berber 
dynasty, started taking over power 
from 1420 and ruled solely 1465–1549. 
With the 15th century began the slow 
decline of Moroccan power: fortune 
now favoured the Europeans.

GEOGRAPHY
Geography was a favourite discipline 
with Arabs in the early Middle Ages. Ibn 
Battuta (c.1300–c.1370), who was born  
in Tangier and studied in Damascus, took 
the art of the rihla – encyclopedic travel 
writing – to its height. Towards the end 
of his life he dictated an entertaining 
account of his travels over almost 30 
years. He visited the holy cities of Arabia, 
was a minister in the 
Maldives, a merch-
ant in India and 
China, and explored 
Indonesia and the 
Persian Gulf. Having 
returned to the 
Maghreb, he  
travelled through  
the kingdoms of 
sub-Saharan Africa.

THE TWO SHORFA DYNASTIES
Since the time of Idriss I,  
the shorfa (the plural form 
of sherif) – Arabs of high 
social standing who are 
descendants of the Prophet 
Mohammed – have always 
played an important part in 
the social and political life  
of Morocco. Putting an end 
to Berber rule, they emerged 
from the south and governed Morocco 
from the 16th century to the present 
day. Because of their social origins, 
these two final dynasties, the Saadians 
and the Alaouites, are known as the

(1525–1659)
At the beginning of the 16th 
century, the encroachment of 
Christian armies on Moroccan 
soil stimulated a vigorous 
renewal of religious fervour. 
From 1509, supporters of 
the movement of resistance 
against the Europeans found a 
leader in El-Kaïm, sherif of the Beni 
Saad, an Arab tribe from the Draa 
valley. Boldly leading the campaign 
for the reconquest of the Portuguese 
enclaves and for the seizure 
of power, they took control 
of the Souss, of Marrakech 
(1525), which was to become 
their capital, and of Fès (1548), 
ousting the last Wattasid sultans.
 The Saadians stepped onto the stage 
of international relations; in 1577, 
France even appointed a Moroccan 
consul. To help counter the threat of 
the Turks, who had settled in Algiers, 
Mohammed ech-Cheikh requested the 
support of Madrid, whose attention 
was then focused on the Americas 
rather than the Maghreb. The 
Ottomans had Mohammed 
assassinated in 1557, but 
did not conquer Morocco.
The Saadians traded with 
Europe and drew up  
treaties with England and the 
Netherlands. From the  
Moriscos, the last Spanish 
Muslims, they received the 
final heritage of Al-Andalus.
 Once the Saadians had retaken  
Agadir (1541), only Mazagan (El- 
Jadida), Tangier and Ceuta remained 
in Portuguese hands. Portugal’s 
“Moroccan dream” was extinguished 
at the Battle of the Three Kings in 1578, 
when two rival Saadian sultans and 
Dom Sebastião, the young king 
of Portugal, all died at Ksar el-
Kebir (see p92). His uncle, Philip 
II of Spain, swiftly annexed the 
Portuguese kingdom.
 Saadian prosperity culmi-
nated with Ahmed el-Mansour, 
(1578–1603) whose conquests 
secured control of Saharan 
trade, and who set up the  
makhzen (a central administra-
tion). Gold from Mali and slaves 
reached Marrakech. Political and 
religious links with western 
Africa, and the presence 
of African folk culture 
brought here by slaves, 
made a mark on Morocco 
that can still be seen today.
 Like their preceding dynasties, the 
Saadians declined as the result of  
ambition and disputed succession. In 
the distant Tafilalt, the ascetic shorfa, 
descendants of Ali, cousin of the 
Prophet, revolted against the deca-
dence of Saadian rule under Moulay 
Sherif, and seized control of the 
region, which they held until 1664.

ALAOUITE GREATNESS 
AND EXTERNAL THREATS
The Alaouite dynasty, 
the seventh and  
present ruling dynasty, 
has given the country 
some rulers of great 
stature. During its 
long reign, each ruler 
concentrated on bring-
ing stability to the 
country and on count-
ering the threat of 
imperialist powers. It 
took ten years for 
Moulay Rachid (1664– 
72), founder of the dynasty, to bring 
the country under his control. The long 
and glorious reign of his younger  
bro ther, Moulay Ismaïl (1672–1727), 
mar ked Morocco’s final apogee (see 
pp54–5). He transferred the capital 
from Fès to Meknès, imposed central 
authority in the remotest corners of 
the country, recaptured Mehdya,  
Tangier and Larache from the Europe-
ans, and maintained relations with the 
courts of Europe.
 After a period of instability, his 
grandson, Sidi Mohammed ben Abd-
allah, restored order, expelled the  
Portuguese from Ma-
zagan and founded 
Mogador (Essaouira) 
to facilitate trade with 
Europe. Under Moulay 
Yazid and Moulay 
Sliman, epidemics, 
uprisings and diplo-
matic isolation caused 
the country to with-
draw into itself. Mou-
lay Abderrahman, 
another great ruler, 
attempted to mod-
ernize the country, 
but was frustrated by  
European colonial expansion. He was 
defeated by the French at Isly in 1844.
 Moulay Abderrahman and his succes- 
sors, Mohammed IV and Hassan I, 
were forced to concede commercial 
and consular privileges to Britain, 
France and Spain. In 1860, Spain took 
control of Tetouan. Hassan I, a dynamic 
ruler, attempted to balance the  
influence of these rivals, but the Con-
ference of Madrid of 1880 sanctioned 
the intervention of foreign powers in 
Morocco. On his death, the country 
was stable and the dynasty’s prestige 
intact, but Morocco was weakened.

The Great Age of Moulay Ismaïl
Moulay Ismaïl, of partial Saharan parentage and a 
man of phenomenal vitality, stamped his authority  
on Morocco during a long and brilliant reign. Ruling 
for 55 years (1672–1727), he was a contemporary of 
Louis XIV. He made Meknès his capital and main-
tained a powerful army, recruited tens of thousands 
of men for the Black Guard, and modernized the  
artillery. With these forces, he was able to overcome 
rebellious tribes and bring temporary peace to the 
country. He wrenched from European control several 
fortresses, including Tangier and Larache. He also 
exchanged ambassadors with the French court.

In conflict with Spain, Moulay Ismaïl  
sought an alliance with France in order  
to vanquish the fortresses that Spain held  
in Morocco. Once in France, the sultan’s 
ambassador, Hadj Tenim, concluded a 
treaty of Franco-Moroccan friendship in 
1682. Morocco then became an important 
trading partner for European countries.
Black Guard
Moulay Ismaïl greatly expanded the army, 
which consisted of three contingents: units 
provided by the tribes, Christian renegades 
and abid, black slaves and mercenaries, 
whose exclusive duty was to protect the sultan. 
This latter regiment led to the formation of 
the famous Black Guard, which still exists.

AUDIENCE GIVEN  
BY MOULAY ISMAÏL
As depicted in this painting in the Palace  
of Versailles by M. P. Denis (1663–1742), 
Louis XIV, the Sun King, sent an  
ambassador to Meknès in 1689. The  
ambassador, the Chevalier François  
Pidou de Saint-Olon, was received with  
full honours. For 20 years, Louis XIV and 
Moulay Ismaïl exchanged embassies,  
but relations between them soured  
when France declined to engage in  
conflict with Spain.
THE ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE  
OF MOULAY ISMAÏL
Moulay Ismaïl’s achievements as a builder 
are most clearly seen in Meknès. This was 
formerly a small town overshadowed by 
the prestigious city of Fès, but the sultan 
transformed it into Morocco’s fourth 
imperial city. It was enclosed by a double 
line of defensive walls and was described 
by some as the Versailles of Morocco. 
Next to the medina, the sultan built a  
kasbah, an extensive architectural complex 
enclosed within its own walls. This was 
the seat of power and of administration, 
consisting of several palaces, mosques, 
garrisons and studs, cisterns and stores 
for water. It was the ideal imperial city.
Anne Marie  
de Bourbon
So as to strengthen 
his links with 
Europe, Moulay 
Ismaïl sent a request 
to Louis XIV for the 
hand of the  
princess, the 
French king’s 
cousin, in  
marriage. His 
request was  
not granted.
The Sultan’s Mausoleum
(see pp194–5), which was built in the 
17th century, was completely restored 
by Mohammed V in 1959. The clocks 
in the burial chamber were presented 
as gifts by Louis XIV.
Bab el- 
Berdaïne, 
the Gate of 
the Pack-
Saddle  
Makers (see p188), takes its name from 
the pack-saddle market held nearby. In 
the 17th century, Meknès was enclosed 
by triple walls with imposing gates.

Large-scale 
building projects 
undertaken by 
Moulay Ismaïl, 
such as the Dar 
el-Ma, shown  
here (see p193), 
called for an 
army of crafts-
men. These were 
recruited from 
other tribes, Christian prisoners and 
slaves. Contemporary writers record 
that the cruel sultan supervised the 
work himself, passing a death sentence 
on the slowest workers.

EUROPEAN DOMINATION
When Moulay Abdel Aziz, a weak 
ruler, ascended the throne in 1894, 
France already had an imperial  
presence in Algeria and Tunisia. The 
French now aimed to secure a free 
hand in Morocco, parallel with  
Britain’s designs in Egypt and those of 
Italy in Libya. After controversial  
fiscal reform, Moulay Abdel Aziz  
entered into heavy debt with France. 
Meanwhile, the French military  
administration in Algeria gradually 
pushed back the frontier with  
Morocco, which was to lead to a long-
drawn-out conflict. When Kaiser  
Wilhelm II of Germany arrived in  
Tangier in March 1905 to claim his 
share, the “Moroccan question” took 
o n  a n o t h e r  d i m e n s i o n .  T h e  
Conference of Algeciras of 1906, 
in which all the interested powers 
took part, forcibly opened 
Morocco to international trade, 
and assigned France and Spain 
as administrators.
 In 1907, various incidents 
provided the French forces 
with the pretext to move 
into Oujda and Casablanca. 
In the same year, Abdel 
Aziz was deposed by his  
brother Moulay Hafidh, who  
attempted to resist but was  
forced to yield. Numerous up-
risings led the French to  
impose a protectorate, through 
the Treaty of Fès in 1912.  
Moulay Hafidh was then  
replaced by his half-brother, 
Moulay Youssef.
 What was called “pacific-
ation” at the time continued 
until 1934: it took French  
forces 22 years to bring the whole 
country under control. In the Rif, a 
state of war persisted up until 1926. 
Abd el-Krim Khattabi, a brilliant strate-
gist and organizer, defeated the  
Spanish at Anoual in 1921, proclaimed  
a republic in 1922, and long held  
out against the forces of the Spanish 
and French colonial powers, led by 
Francisco Franco and Philippe Pétain 
respectively. He left the country and 
died in exile in Cairo in 1963.
 Marshal Hubert Lyautey, an excep-
tional man who was made France’s 
first resident-general in Morocco in 
1912, played a decisive role in the 
imposition of French rule. He installed 
the capital in Rabat, and worked to 
promote the country’s economic 
development, but firmly  
refused to consider assimil-
ation, a process by which 
colonies were modelled 
on the mother country. 
The country’s traditional 
infrastructure was left 
intact and town plan-
ners safeguarded  
the imperial cities.

sef, who was then 18,

THE FIGHT FOR ISTIQLAL
Morocco was divided into 
two zones: a French zone, 
covering the largest part of 
the country, and a Spanish 
zone, in the north and 
south. Tangier was an  
international free city.
 The French Protectorate 
was both beneficial and detrimental to 
Morocco. The country’s infrastructure 
was modernized, its mineral resources 
were exploited and the most fertile 
land turned over to agriculture. The 
population of Casablanca, the econo-
mic capital, doubled every ten years,  
and the city became a major port.
 The administration of Lyautey’s 13 
successors, however, was increasingly 
direct, so that the role of the local 
makhzen became redundant. Colonial 
ideology triumphed in the 1930s. When 
France imposed a Berber dahir, giving 
Berber areas a separate legal system, 
the effect was to divide the country.
 World War II justified the Moroccan 
people’s desire for freedom. In 1942, 
the Allies arrived in Morocco and  
President Roosevelt pledged the sultan 
his support. Showing a progressively 
higher profile, Mohammed V drew a 
following of young nationalists, who 
set up the Istiqlal (Independence) 
Party. The Manifesto of Independence 
called on the sultan to head a move-
ment for independence, a challenge 
that he formally accepted in a speech 
in Tangier in 1947. The power struggle 
with Paris lasted almost a decade. In 
1951, the French authorities supported 
the rebellion of El-Glaoui, 
the pasha of Marrakech (see 
p253). The sultan refused  
to abdicate but the French 
deposed him in 1953, re-
placing him with the elderly 
Ben Arafa. The royal family 
were forced into exile but 
the fight for independence 
gained momentum.
International opinion no 
longer supported the colo-
nial powers, and the United 
Nations took over the 
Moroccan question. After 
negotiations with France, the deposed 
sultan made his triumphant return from 
exile as King Mohammed V, with  
Hassan, the heir apparent, at his side. 
The Protectorate ended in 1956, and in 
1958 Tangier and the Spanish enclave  
of Tarfaya were restored to the kingdom. 
Independence had been won, although 
national unity was still to be achieved.

POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN 
CONTEMPORARY MOROCCO
In the rest of the Arab world monar-
chies were replaced by authoritarian 
republican regimes (as in Iraq, Egypt, 
Yemen and Tunisia). In Morocco, 
however, Mohammed V’s patriotic 
sentiment united the country behind 
a monarchy that has long-established 
roots and that ensures its unity and  
stability. A pious and outward-looking 
Muslim, the king encouraged the 
emancipation of women, the educa-
tion of his people, and agrarian  
reform. During this period, Morocco, 
unlike neighbouring countries, em-
braced political pluralism (albeit in a 
tightly controlled form) and relative 
economic liberalism, choices that were 
decisive for its future. In 1958, having 
broken away from Istiqlal, the progres-
sive wing of the nationalist movement 
founded a left-wing party – the Union 
Nationale des Forces Populaires, the 
future USFP – with Abderrahim 
Bouabid and Mehdi Ben Barka.
 The king also had to contend with 
the impatience of nationalist sentiment, 
which believed that the country should 
engage in armed conflict to regain all 
Saharan territory and that it should 
give military aid to Algeria, which was 
still fighting its war for independence.
 Mohammed V died suddenly, after 
an operation, in 1961. His eldest son, 
Moulay Hassan, who had been closely 
associated with power for many years, 
succeeded him as Hassan II. A skilled 
politician, he was to witness political 
as well as social change in his country, 
in the course of a reign lasting 38 
years. It was, however, often marked 
by unrest and mixed success.

THE NATIONAL QUESTION
The question of the reintegration of Moroccan  
territory is a long-standing theme in contemporary 
Moroccan politics. At issue is the western Sahara, 
an area of 266,000 sq km (102,700 sq miles),  
from which Spain withdrew in 1975. In November 
that year Hassan II launched a Green March to 
win back this mineral-rich territory. The Polisario 
Front, an armed movement supported by Algeria, 
meanwhile fought for the territory’s indepen-
dence. Open conflict raged until 1988, when  
both sides accepted a plan drawn up by the  
United Nations, with consideration for the area’s 
Sahraoui population. Since 1991, a referendum 
on the issue has been continually postponed 
because of lack of agreement on voters’ lists.

T H E  H I S T O R Y  O F  M O R O C C O

On the international front, Hassan II 
firmly steered Morocco in the direction 
of the Western world, despite some-
times stormy relations with Paris, and 
even spoke of the country joining the 
European Union. He pursued policies 
that were distinctive in the Muslim 
world, leading the Al Qods Committee 
in Jerusalem and encouraging recon-
ciliation between Israel and the  
Palestinians. By contrast, deep-seated 
caution marked his relations with 
neighbouring Algeria, which had 
gained independence in 1962. Disputes 
over the border between the two 
countries led to the outbreak of war 
in 1963. Algiers also supported the 
Polisario Front, and the border 
was closed on several occasions.
 On the domestic front, sup-
ported by General Oufkir, Dlimi 
then Driss Basri, Hassan II alter-
nated liberalizing policies with 
repression. The first constitution, 
drawn up in 1962 and followed 
by parliamentary elections in 
1963, failed to unify the country. 
A new constitution was drawn 
up in 1970. Two coups d’état, 
attempted by a faction close to 
the king, both failed. Social 
unrest caused by poverty  
mar ked the following years, as  
public life returned to normal. 
When a new constitution was drawn 
up in 1996, the time had come for a less 
autocratic style of government.
 After parliamentary elections in 1997, 
Hassan II opened the doors to political 
change. Abderrahmane Youssoufi, a 
political opponent who had been 
imprisoned and exiled, was instructed 
to form a broad coalition government 
around the Socialist Union, and wisely 
brought in thoroughgoing reforms to 
modernize the country.
 The king died suddenly in 1999, and 
was succeeded by his eldest son, 
Mohammed VI. Born in 1963, he enjoys 
great popularity because of his youth. 
He has addressed human rights issues, 
has allowed remaining exiles to return, 
takes a close interest in the northern 
provinces that were neglected by his 
father, and had Driss Basri, the all-
powerful Minister of the Interior,  
removed from office. Fundamental  
problems such as underdevelopment,  
illiteracy, poverty and social inequality 
still remain. After the terrorist bombs 
of 2003, the King proclaimed “the end 
of the era of indulgence”, and limited 
human rights and freedom of the press.

Morocco at a Glance
From the Mediterranean coast to the High Atlas, 
beyond which the country stretches out into the 
boundless expanses of the Sahara Desert, Morocco 
forms a gigantic semicircle facing onto the Atlantic. 
Its major towns and cities, the focus of the country’s 
economic and political activity, are located along the 
Atlantic seaboard from Tangier to Agadir and from 
Fès to Rabat. Topography, climate and history have 
together created a multifaceted country which offers 
everything from beaches, high mountain valleys and 
fertile agricultural land with almond and peach trees 
to majestic mountains and an extensive desert dotted 
with oases and palm groves. In secret medinas, in 
labyrinthine souks, or at the foot of Almohad and 
Merinid minarets, traders and craftsmen can be  
seen continuing ancient artistic traditions.
The South is a varied 
region of deserts, oases, 
mountains and coastline. 
The architecture and the 
colours of the houses in 
Tafraoute, in the 
Anti-Atlas, are highly  
distinctive (see p293).
Casablanca is renowned 
for its Art Deco architecture. 
It also boasts the richly  
decorated Hassan II Mosque 
(see pp102–3).
Essaouira, a 
strikingly white 
town that appears 
to rise up out of 
the water, is also  
a surfer’s dream 
location (see 
pp120–25).

The Gate of the Ambassadors at the Dar el-Makhzen (Royal Palace) in Rabat
Archaeological excavations of the 
Merinid necropolis at Chellah (see 
pp80–81) have shown that this area 
was occupied by the Romans, and even 
earlier too. Much later, around 1150, 
Abd el-Moumen, the first ruler of 
the Almohad dynasty, chose to 
establish a permanent camp 
here and ordered a small 
imperial residence to be 
built on the site of a for-
mer ribat (fortified 
monastery).
The caliph Yacoub el-Mansour then 
embarked on the construction of a 
great and splendid city that was to be 
known as Ribat el-Fath (Camp of  
Victory), in celebration of his victory 
over Alfonso VIII of Castile at the  
Battle of Alarcos in 1195. On the death 
of the caliph in 1199, work on this 
ambitious project ceased: although 
the city gates and walls had been com-
pleted, the Hassan Mosque and its 
minaret (see p49) were unfinished. 
The Almohads’ defeat at the Battle of 
Las Navas de Tolosa  
in 1212 weakened 
their power and led 
to the city’s decline.
In 1610, Philip III 
of Spain expelled from his 
kingdom the remaining Moors, 
who fled to the cities of the  
Maghreb. Among them were a 
large colony of emigrants from  
Andalusia who settled in Rabat.
Rabat became the capital of a minor 
and relatively autonomous coastal 
republic. Funds brought by the  
Andalusian refugees were put to 
equipping a flotilla of privateers that 
preyed on European shipping. The 
“Republic of Bou Regreg”, as it was 
known, was then annexed to the she-
rif’s kingdom in 1666, although piracy 
was not brought to an end until the 
mid-19th century.
In 1912 Marshal Lyautey (see p56) 
made Rabat the political and  
administrative capital of Morocco. Its 
population now exceeds 1.5 million.
F
acing onto the Atlantic Ocean, Rabat is an attractive city of 
domes and minarets, sweeping terraces, wide avenues and 
green spaces. It is markedly more pleasant than some other 
Moroccan cities and is also undergoing fundamental change. Facing 
Salé, its ancient rival, across Wadi Bou Regreg, Rabat is the political, 
administrative and financial capital of Morocco, the country’s main 
university town and its second-largest metropolis after Casablanca.

Exploring Rabat
Rabat has four main areas of 
interest. In the north is the 
picturesque Oudaïa Kasbah, 
which is partly enclosed by 
ramparts dating from the 
Almohad period. The medina, 
which contains the city’s 
souks, is bounded to the west 
by Almohad ramparts and to 
the south by the 17th-century 
Andalusian Wall, which runs 
parallel to Boulevard Hassan II. 
Avenue Mohammed V is the 
new town’s busy central north– 
south axis, with residential blocks 
dating from the Protectorate 
(1912–56). In the northeast stands 
the Hassan Tower and Mausoleum 
of Mohammed V. In the Merinid 
necropolis at Chellah, to the south, 
are vestiges of the Roman town of Sala.

GETTING AROUND
The main sights of Rabat 
are easily reachable on 
foot. The city’s many  
one-way streets, however, 
make driving difficult. It is 
best to park on Boulevard 
Hassan II, since parking 
spaces are hard to find in 
the city centre. Although 
Rabat is served by a bus 
and tram network, it is 
often more practical to 
travel around the city in a 
petit taxi, which is only a 
little more expensive.

The kasbah takes its name from the 
Oudaïas, an Arab tribe with a warrior past 
that was settled here by Moulay Ismaïl 
(1672–1727) to protect the city from the 
threat of rebel tribes. Part of the city walls 
that surround this “fortress”, built on the 
top of a cliff, and Bab Oudaïa, the gate 
that pierces it, date from the Almohad 
period (1147–1248). On Rue Jamaa, the 
main thoroughfare of this picturesque  
district, stands the El-Atika Mosque, built in the 
12th century and the oldest mosque in Rabat.

City Walls 1
In the north of the city. Accessible via 
Place du Souk el-Ghezel and Place de 
l’Ancien Sémaphore.
Separated from the medina by 
the Place du Souk el-Ghezel, 
the Oudaïa Kasbah is  
defended by thick ramparts. 
These were built mostly by 
the Almohads in the 12th  
century, and were restored 
and remodelled in the 17th 
and 18th centuries  
by the Moriscos 
(see p68) and the 
Alaouite kings.
 Most of the 
Almohad walls 
facing onto the 
sea and running 
inland survive. 
The walls  
surrounding the 
Andalusian Garden 
date from the reign 
of Moulay Rachid 
(founder of the 
Alaouite dynasty).  
The Hornacheros (Andalusian 
emigrants) who occupied the 
kasbah and rebuffed attacks 
from both sea and land 
rebuilt the curtain wall  
in several places and  
constructed the Pirates’ 
Tower, whose inner stairway 
leads down to the river. They 
also pierced the walls of the 
old Almohad towers with 
embrasures to hold cannons. 
A complex system of under-
ground passages leading  
from within the kasbah  
to the exterior beyond  
the walls was also dug.
Bab Oudaïa 2
Oudaïa Kasbah. The gate leads to the 
kasbah from Place du Souk el-Ghezel.
Towering above the cliffs  
that line the Bou Regreg,  
and dominating Rabat’s  
medina is Bab Oudaïa, which 
is the main entrance into the 
kasbah. This monumental city 
gate, built in dressed stone of 
red ochre, is considered 
to be one of the  
finest examples  
of Almohad 
architecture. But 
the particular 
design and  
conception of 
this gateway, 
built by Yacoub 
el-Mansour in 
1195, make it more 
of a decorative  
feature than a 
piece of military 
defence work. 
Flanked by two towers, it  
is crowned by a horseshoe 
arch. The inner and outer 
façades are decorated with 
rich ornamentation carved in 
relief into the stone, starting 
at the opening of the arch 
and continuing in several tiers 
as far up as the base of the 
parapet. Above the arch,  
two bands with interlacing 
lozenges are outlined with 
floral decoration. Both sides 
of the gate are crowned by  
a band of calligraphy.

In the 17th century, Moulay 
Ismaïl built a small palace 
within the kasbah. This 
became the residence of the 
first Alaouite sultans while 
they were based in Rabat,  
as an inscription on the 
wooden lintels of the central 
patio indicates: “Unfailing  
fortune and brilliant victory  
to our lord Smaïl, leader  
of the faithful.” The palace 
was completely restored  
and slightly altered in 1917, 
during the Protectorate,  
and has undergone further 
phases of restoration, as well 
as a renovation since then.
 The palace as it is today 
consists of a main building 
arranged around an arcaded 
courtyard. The four sides of 
the courtyard lead off into 
large rectangular rooms  
with marble floors and  
geometrically coffered  
ceilings. The surrounding 
buildings include a prayer 
room for private workship,  
a hammam (steam bath)  
and a tower. A beautiful  
garden laid out in the  
Andalusian style gives  
the palace the status of  
a princely residence.

Stylized seashell

The city walls are built of 
rough-hewn stone covered 
with a thick coating of ochre 
plaster. They are set with 
imposing towers and  
bastions, which are more 
numerous along the stretch  
of the walls facing the sea 
and the river. Standing 8 to  
10 m (26 to 33 ft) high, and 
having an average thickness 
of 2.50 m (8 ft), the walls are 
surmounted by a rampart 
walk bordered by a low  
parapet; part of the rampart 
walk survives.
 This sturdy building and 
sophisticated military con-
struction defended the pirates’ 
nest and withstood almost all 
attacks from European forces.
Oudaïa Palace was also a 
defensive feature and a  
tribunal. Today, the gatehouse 
serves as an exhibition hall.

A convenient place to start

named because of the market 
that once took place here. 
This was also the place where 
Christian prisoners were once

fine carpets made in the city

Thursday morning.
 Rue Hadj Daoui, just

Since 1915, the palace

Oudaïa. On display here are 
carpets and copperwork, 
astrolabes (for measuring the 
altitude of stars) dating from

and collections of ceramics 
and of musical instruments. 
One room in the museum

Moroccan interior, with sofas 
covered in sumptuous gold-
embroidered silk fabrics  
made in Fès. Another room  
is devoted to the traditional 
dress of the region between 
the Rif and the Sahara.
 The museum also contains

Raised in memory of Mohammed V, the

namese architect Vo Toan and built with 
the help of 400 Moroccan craftsmen. The 
group of buildings that make up the 
mausoleum of Mohammed V include a 
mosque and a museum devoted to the 
history of the Alaouite dynasty. The mausoleum 
itself, in white Italian marble, stands on a platform

Running southwest from  
Rue du Souk es-Sebat, Rue 
Souïka (Little Souk Street) is 
the main artery through the 
medina and also its most  
lively thoroughfare. Lined 
with all manner of small 
shops selling clothes, shoes, 
food, radios and cassettes, 
with restaurants and with 
spice merchants, the street 
throngs with people several 
times a day.

Between Bab el-Had and Place

In the 17th century, the  
Moriscos – Muslim refugees 
from Andalusia – found the 
medina undefended and so 
encircled it with a defensive 
wall. Named after its builders, 
the Andalusian Wall stands 
about 5 m (16 ft) high and 
runs in a straight line for 
more than 1,400 m (4,595 ft) 
from Bab el-Had (Sunday 
Gate) in the west to the borj 
(small fort) of Sidi Makhlouf 
in the east. Boulevard Hassan 
II runs parallel to it. During 
the Protectorate, a stretch of 
the walls about 100 m (328 ft) 
long, and including Bab el-

¢ to the public.
For more than eight centuries, 
the Hassan Tower has stood 
on the hill overlooking Wadi 
Bou Regreg. Best seen as  
one approaches Rabat by  
the bridge from Salé, it is  
one of the city’s most  
prestigious monuments and  
a great emblem of Rabat.
 It is the unfinished minaret 
of the Hassan Mosque, built 
by Yacoub el-Mansour in 
about 1196. The construction 
of this gigantic mosque, of 
dimensions quite out of  
proportion to the population 
of Rabat at the time, suggests 
that the Almohad ruler  
intended to make Rabat  
between the 13th and the 
16th centuries and remodelled 
and restored on several  
occasions during the Alaouite 
period. The mosque’s most 
prominent feature is the  
minaret, rising to a height of 
33 m (109 ft) and completed 
in 1939. It is built of ashlars 
(blocks of hewn stone),  
decorated with dressed  
stone, and pierced with  
openings in the shape of 
lobed or intersecting arches.
 Opposite the mosque is a 
fountain with a pediment of 
intersecting arches, built in 
the 14th century, during the 
reign of the Merinid sultan 
Abou Fares Abdelaziz. Further 
along the street, on the corner 
of Rue Sidi Fatah, is the  
Moulay Sliman Mosque, or 
Jamaa el-Souika. It was built 
in about 1812 on the orders 
of Moulay Sliman, on the site 
of an earlier place of worship.
Tben, was destroyed to allow 
easier access to a market.
 The walls are set with  
towers placed at intervals of 
some 35 m (115 ft) and are 
topped by a rampart walk. 
This is protected by a parapet 
that the Andalusians pierced 
with numerous narrow slits 
known as loopholes.
 To the east of the walls  
they built the Bastion  
Sidi Makhlouf, a small, 
irregular fort which  
consists of a platform 
resting on solid  
foundations, with a 
tower close by. They 
also built embrasures 
over two of the Almo-
had gates, Bab el-Alou 
and Bab el-Had.
 Bab el-Had was  
once the main  
gateway into the 
medina. Dating 
from the Almohad 
period (1147–1248), 
it was rebuilt by Moulay  
Sliman in 1814. On the side 
facing Boulevard Misr, one  
of gate’s two pentagonal  
towers stands close to the 
Almohad walls, which  
probably date from 1197.
 Bab el-Had contains  
several small chambers  
which were intended to 
accommodate the soldiers 
who were in charge of the 
guard, the armouries and  
the billetting of the troops.

During the 44 years of the

extensive area enclosed

his new imperial capital.
An alternative interpretation  
is that the Almohads were  
attempting to rival the  
magnificent Great Mosque  
of Córdoba, the former capital 
of the Islamic kingdom in the 
West (see pp48–9). Either 
way, after the death of Yacoub 
el-Mansour in 1199, the un-
finished mosque fell into dis-
repair. All but the mosque’s 
minaret was destroyed by  
an earthquake in 1755.
 The Hassan Mosque was 
built to a huge rectangular 
plan 183 m (600 ft) by 139 m 
(456 ft); the Great Mosque of 
Córdoba was just 175 m  
(574 ft) by 128 m (420 ft).  
It was the largest religious 
building in the Muslim West, 
in size inferior only to the 
mosque of Samarra in Iraq.
A great courtyard lay at the 
foot of the tower, while the 
huge columned prayer hall 
was divided into 21 avenues 
separated by lines of gigantic 
columns crowned with  
capitals. Remains of these 
imposing stone columns  
survive and still convey an 
impression of infinite grandeur.
 The minaret, a square-sided 
tower about 16 m (52 ft) wide 
and 44 m (144 ft) high, was to 
have surpassed the height of 
the Koutoubia Mosque (see 
pp236–7) and the Giralda in 
Seville (see pp48–9), but it 
was never completed. Accord-
ing to Almohad custom, it 
would have reached 80 m 
(262 ft), including the lantern. 
Even unfinished it seems 
huge. Each of its four sides is 
decorated with blind lobed 
Laying out wide boulevards

which was built by Sidi 
Mohammed in the 18th  
century. The avenue is lined 
with residential blocks in the 
Hispano-Maghrebi style. They 
were built by the administr-
ation of the Protectorate, as 
were the Bank of Morocco, 
the post office, the parliament 
building and the railway  
station. The Bank of Morocco 
also houses the Musée de la

finally, the Aterian culture of 
around 40,000–20,000 BC.

SALA-CHELLAH AND 
ISLAMIC ARCHAEOLOGY
The site of Sala-Chellah (see 
pp80–81) is that of  
a Mauretanian and 
Roman town which 
flourished up to 
the 4th century AD 
and which in the 
13th century 
became a royal 
necropolis under 
the Merinids.
 The collection  
of implements  
and other objects 
(including pottery and oil 
lamps) displayed on the 
upper floor of the museum 
traces the history of the site. 
Particularly striking exhibits 
include the bronze bust of 
Juba II (52 BC–AD 23) which 
was discovered in Volubilis 
and probably came from 
Egypt. An Early Christian  
altar, a Byzantine censer  
and an ivory figure of the 
Good Shepherd show the 
presence of Christianity in 
Morocco from the 3rd to  
the 8th centuries.

TEMPORARY EXHIBITIONS
The space on the ground 
floor reserved for temporary 
exhibitions illustrates the 
results of archaeological 
investigations in Morocco, 
using photographs, graphics, 
models, sculpture and various 
other objects.
 A map of Morocco in  
the lobby shows the  
various archaeological 
sites that have been 
discovered to date, 
and the methods 
used to excavate 
them are explained. 
The reconstruction  
of a mosaic from  
Volubilis is laid out on 
the floor of the room 
opposite. The marble 
statue in the centre  
of the room, dating 
from AD 25–40, is 
that of Ptolemy,  
king of Mauretania 
Tingitana and the son 
and successor of Juba 
II and Cleopatra Selene,  
who was assassinated by the 
Roman emperor Caligula.
PREHISTORIC CULTURES
Also on the ground floor is  
a collection of stone artifacts 
relating to the earliest cultures 
and civilizations. Exhibits 
include altars and stelae 
carved with inscrip-
tions, sarcophagi, 
stone arrowheads, 
pebble tools,  
pottery, polished 
stones, axes and 
swords, fragments 
of tombs and 
mouldings, as well 
as rock carvings.

The most extensive collection of archaeological artifacts 
in the country is housed in the Musée Archéologique. 
The museum building was constructed in the 1930s, to 
house the Antiquities Services. The initial prehistoric 
and pre-Islamic collections, consisting of objects dis-
covered by archaeologists working in Volubilis, Banasa 
and Thamusida, were put on public display for the first 
time in 1930–32. The addition of further material from 
Volubilis in 1957 considerably enlarged the museum’s 
collections, raising it to the status of a national  
museum. The displays present the collections according 
to theme. These range from the prehistoric period up 
to the findings of recent archaeological excavations.

excavated. The displays  
of objects that have been 
unearthed include coins,  
pottery made in Sijilmassa 
and other ceramics, notably  
a 14th-century dish from  
Belyounech, as well as frag-
ments of carved plaster and 
sugar-loaf moulds from 
Chichaoua.
PRE-ISLAMIC 
CIVILIZATIONS
Artifacts uncovered during 
excavations at Volubilis, 
Banasa, Thamusida, Sala and 
Mogador are arranged by 
theme, illustrating 
in an  
informative 
fashion the 
most salient 
aspects of both 
pre-Roman 
Morocco  
(Mauretanian  
civilization) and 
Roman Morocco 
(Mauretania  
Tingitana). A range  
of objects show the 
extent of trade  
relations between Morocco 
and the Mediterranean world, 
particularly Carthage; and 
public and private life is  
illustrated through everyday 
objects, including the taps 
that were used in public 
baths, fragments of terracotta 
piping, and cooking utensils 
such as plates, dishes, glasses 
and knives. A section on the 
Roman army includes a  
military diploma from Banasa, 
certificates of good conduct 
engraved on bronze plaques 
and military decorations.
 The collection of white  
marble sculpture includes the 
Head of a Berber Youth from 
Volubilis carved during the 
reign of Augustus, a Sphinx 
from a votive throne, and a 
Sleeping Silenus from 
Volubilis. There are also  
figures of Roman gods such 
as Venus, Bacchus and Mars, 
and of Egyptian deities such 
as Isis and Anubis.
 A particularly impressive 
part of the museum’s displays 
is the collection of antique 
bronzes which come mainly 
from Volubilis and which 
demonstrate the 
wealth enjoyed 
by Morocco’s 
Roman towns. A 
well-preserved 
bust of Cato 
the Younger; 
this 1st-century 
sculpture discovered 
in the House of Venus 
was imported into 
Morocco.
Ephebe Crowned 
with Ivy is, without 
a doubt, the star 
piece in the collection. The 
naked ephebe (young soldier 
in training) wears a crown of 
delicate ivy and is depicted  
in a standing position. The 
stance suggests that in his  
left hand he held a torch;  
this type of representation, 
known as a “lampadophore”, 
together with the classicism  
of the statue, are typical of 
sculpture of the 1st century.
The Dog of Volubilis, found 
on the site in 1916 in the 
vicinity of the triumphal arch, 
dates from the reign of  
Hadrian (early 2nd century) 
and was also made outside 
Morocco. The position of the 
dog, which is clearly designed 
to be accompanied by a 
human figure (undoubtedly 
Diana), suggests that it was 
made to decorate a fountain 
in public baths. The Lustral 
Ephebe, also discovered in 
Volubilis in 1929, brings to 
mind the Lustral Dionysus 
of Praxiteles, preserved in  
a museum in Dresden, in 
Germany, and known  
through numerous copies. 
Finally, the bust of Juba II 
which dates from 25 BC was 
probably imported from Egypt.

complex is of interest in its own right. 
The méchouar (assembly place) and

An extensive complex 
enclosed within its own walls, 
the Dar el-Makhzen (royal 
palace) is inhabited by about 
2,000 people. Built on the  
site of an 18th-century royal 
residence, the current palace 
was completed in 1864, but 
was constantly enlarged 
thereafter; today, it even 
includes a racecourse.
 The palace now houses the 
offices of the Moroccan govern-
ment, the Supreme Court, the 
prime minister’s offices, the 
ministry of the Habous 
(responsible for religious 
organizations), and the El-Fas 
Mosque. The méchouar, a 
place of public assembly, is 
the venue for major gathe-
rings, including the bayaa,  
a ceremony at which senior 
government ministers swear 
The entrance to the necro-
polis itself is marked by an 
imposing Almohad gate with 
a horseshoe arch flanked by 
two towers. Above the arch  
is a band of Kufic calligraphy 
with the name of its builder, 
Abou el-Hassan, and the date 
1339. On the left, inside a 
former guardhouse, there is  
a café. Through the gate, a 
stepped walkway leads to a 
terrace offering spectacular 
views of the Bou Regreg  
valley, the Merinid necropolis 
and the remains of the  
Roman town of Sala Colonia, 
which are surrounded by  
lush vegetation.
 It was Abou Yacoub 
Youssef, the first Merinid  
caliph, who chose this as the 
site of a mosque and the  
burial place of his wife, Oum 
el-Izz, in 1284. Abou Yacoub 
Youssef died in Algeciras in 
1286, and his body was 
brought back to the necro-
polis. His two successors, 
Abou Yacoub, who died in 
1307, and Abou Thabit, who 
died in 1308, were also laid  
to rest here. The burial  
complex was completed  
by the sultan Abou Saïd 
(1310–31) and his son Abou 
el-Hassan (1331–51), and was 
later embellished by Abou 
Inan. The walls around the 
necropolis, which have the 
ochre tones typical of the 
earth stone of Rabat, were 
built by Abou el-Hassan, who 
probably reconstructed the 
existing Roman walls. In 1500, 
Leo Africanus recorded the 
existence of 30 Merinid tombs.
 Situated within the walls of 
the necropolis are the ruins  
of the mosque built by Abou

Traditionally, the king would 
reside in the former harem 
though Mohammed VI stays 
in his own private residence.
 Besides private buildings, 
the palace also includes an 
extensive garden, immaculate-
ly kept and planted with  
various species of trees and 
with flowers in formal beds.

that surrounded it. To the 
right behind the mihrab is  
the koubba (shrine) of Abou 
Yacoub Youssef.
 Opposite the koubba,  
the Mausoleum of Abou  
el-Hassan, the Black Sultan 
and the last Merinid ruler to 
be buried here, in 1351, lies 
alongside the walls. His  
funerary stele is still in place. 
Also to be seen here is the 
koubba of his wife, who  
died in 1349. Named Chams 
el-Doha (which can be  
translated as “light of the 
dawn”), she was a Christian 
who converted to Islam. She 
was the mother of Abou Inan 
(see p51), one of the most 
illustrious Merinid rulers.
Her accomplishments 
include the building of 
the Bou Inania Medersa 
in Fès (see pp172–3).
 Also within the walls  
of the necropolis was  
a zaouia, a religious 
institution that functioned 
simultaneously as a 
mosque, a centre of 
learning and a hostel for 
pilgrims and students 
(some of the cells can 
still be made out). Built 
by Abou el-Hassan, the 
zaouia is designed and 
decorated like the  
medersas in Fès, and  
it is thought that it may 
have been even more 
luxuriously appointed. 
Abou el-Hassan covered 
the upper part of the 
minaret with a decorative 
design of white, black, green 
and blue zellij tilework, 
which is still visible today.
 The necropolis at Chellah 
was abandoned at the end of 
the Merinid dynasty, and in 
the course of the following 
centuries was ransacked  
several times. It was largely 
destroyed by the earthquake 
of 1755. Vegetation invaded 
the stonework and colonies 
of storks built their nests in 
the trees and on the minarets, 
giving the place a super-
natural atmosphere,  
particularly at sunset.
 The necropolis has become 
the subject of much folklore 
and many legends, as can be 
seen from the large number

mosque) are also believed to 
bring good fortune to barren 
women. These supplicants 
feed them eggs, symbols of 
fertility, which are offered  
for sale by young boys in

Although it attracts far fewer tourists 
than the interior or the imperial cities, 
the Moroccan coastline from Rabat to 
Tangier has much to offer visitors. It 
has not undergone the high level of 
development that has transformed 
the coastal area from Rabat to 
Casablanca and the south. 
Nevertheless, this region is 
no less characteristic of 
the modern, vibrant and 
outward-looking coun-
try that Morocco has 
become. For 250 km 
(155 miles), the ocean seems omni-
present, as roads and motorways often 
skirt the coastline and the beaches. 
For motorists following the coastal 
roads, the ocean may suddenly come 
into sight at an estuary or over a dune. 
The road follows roughly the course 
of a Roman road linking Sala Colonia 
(known today as 
Chellah, see pp80–81) 
and Banasa, Lixus 
and Tangier. This is 
the heart of one of 
e a r l i e s t  r e g i o n s  o f  
Morocco in which towns and 
cities were established.
The ocean has shaped the  
history of the coastal towns:  
occupied from Phoenician times and 
into the Roman period, they have 
attracted pirates, invaders and Anda-
lusian, Spanish and French occupiers, 
each of whom left their mark. It is also 
the ocean that gives the region its  
gentle, moist climate (strawberries, 
bananas and tomatoes are grown in 
greenhouses) and that drives industry 
and port activity from Kenitra to  
Tangier, where a new port has been 
built to handle cargo bound for Europe.
NORTHERN ATLANTIC COAST
M
orocco’s Northern Atlantic coast offers extensive beaches of 
soft fine sand, lagoons, winter havens for migratory birds, 
and forests that are highly prized by hunters. But to explore 
it is also to travel back in time, since the heritage of the Phoenicians 
and the Romans, the corsairs, the Portuguese and the Spanish, as well 
as of the colonial epoch is present alongside the new prosperity 
brought by agriculture, port activity, trade and tourism.

Exploring the Northern Atlantic Coast
Agriculture in the region of Kenitra
Travelling along Morocco’s Atlantic coast between Salé and Tangier 
reveals a natural paradise of sea, forests, lagoons, hunting and fishing 
within sight of beaches that appear to stretch to infinity. The coast is 
punctuated by ancient sites: Thamusida, nestling in a bend of Wadi 
Sebou; Banasa, set a little way back from the sea, in the fertile plain 
of the Rharb; and Lixus, standing on a promontory opposite Larache, 
on the estuary of the Loukkos. From Salé to Tangier, a succession of 
small walled towns with interesting monuments bears testament to a 
rich history: Mehdya, whose kasbah dominates the final meanders  
of Wadi Sebou; Moulay Bousselham, with its attractive lagoon and 
beach protected by the tomb of the eponymous saint, which draws 
numerous pilgrims; Asilah, where walls pierced by mysteriously 
screened windows enclose narrow, secretive streets; Larache, a 
charmingly Andalusian town; and Tangier, which looks over the 
Straits of Gibraltar towards Spain and Europe.

GETTING AROUND
A motorway (with toll) provides a direct 
link between Rabat and Tangier. Even 
when driving on a motorway, care should 
be taken: animals or people may try to 
cross unexpectedly. The N1 goes further 
inland, reaching the coast at Asilah.  
A bus service running from Rabat  
and Tangier provides transport 
to and from most places.

Founded in about the 11th 
century, Salé was fortified and 
embellished at the end of the 
13th century by the Merinids. 
They built a medersa, a 
mosque, a medical school 
and a magnificent aqueduct, 
which can still be seen from 
the road to Kenitra. During 
the Middle Ages, Salé was a 
busy port, used by traders 
from the northern Mediterra-
nean, and in 1609 it provided 
sanctuary for refugees from 
Andalusia. Salé shared the 
lucrative business of  
privateering with its neigh-
bour and rival Rabat (see 
pp64–81), with which it 
came into conflict. When  
piracy was brought to an  
end in the 18th century, the 
town went into decline.
 In the 20th century,  
however, Salé found prosper-
ity once more, as a major  
centre of the crafts industry.
 At the entrance to the town 
(from the direction  
of Rabat) stands the 
13th-century Bab el-
Mrisa (Gate of the 
Sea). This was the 
entrance to the  
maritime arsenal  
built by Yacoub  
el-Mansour, and a 
canal linking Wadi 
Bou Regreg to the 
harbour passed 
through it.
 Within the town, 
near Rue Bab el-
Khebbaz, the main 
street through the 
medina, are the  
Kissaria and souks, both filled 
with craftsmen and traders. 
Nearby are the Grand Mosque 
and the medersa. A doorway 
framed by a horseshoe arch 
and covered with a carved 
wooden porch leads into the 
medersa. Built during the 
reign of the Merinid ruler 
Abou el-Hassan, it is notable 
for its central tower surround-
ed by a colonnaded gallery 
covered in zellij tilework and 
carved plaster and wood.  
The mihrab has a decorated 
wooden ceiling.
 The Seamen’s 
Cemetery, in the 
northeast of the 
town, is dotted 
with the mara-
bouts (shrines) of 
such holy men as 
Sidi ben Achir. In 
the 16th century, 
he was credited 
with the power to 
calm the waves so

Established in 1913 in the 
early days of the French  
Protectorate, from 1933 to 
1955 this town was known  
as Port-Lyautey. Nowadays, 
Kenitra consists of distinct 
districts: residential areas with 
villas, a European-style town 
centre and poorer suburbs.
 In the harbour, on the right 
bank of Wadi Sebou, regional 
produce from the Rharb (such 
as citrus fruit, cork, cotton, 
cereals and pulp 
for papermaking)

Moulay Ismaïl (see p53) at 
the end of the 17th century.
 The kasbah which stands on 
the plateau, dominating the

the Spanish, and its moated

The small town of Moulay 
Bousselham is a coastal resort 
that is very popular with 
Moroccans. The mosque  
and the tomb of Moulay 
Bousselham tower above the 
ocean and the Merja Zerga 
lagoon. As the burial place of 
Moulay Bousselham, the 10th-
century holy man, it is also  
a major place of pilgrimage, 
attracting many followers in 
late June and early July.
 The life of the holy man  
is wreathed in legends  
associated with the ocean  
and its perils. The Moulay 
Bousselham sandbar is, 
indeed, highly dangerous:  
the waves come crashing in 
over the reefs and onto the 
beach. The waters of the 
lagoon are calmer; boat trips 
are organized to see the  
thousands of birds – herons, 
pink flamingoes, gannets and 
sheldrake – that come to the 
lagoon on their migrations in 
December and January. Boat 
trips around the lagoon depart 
from the small fishing harbour.
Loukkos. In the 16th century 
it was used as a base by  
corsairs from Algiers and  
Turkey, and was subject  
to reprisals by Portuguese 
forces from Asilah. The town 
passed to Spain in 1610, and 
was then taken by Moulay 
Ismaïl at the end of the 17th 
century. During the Spanish 
Protectorate (1911–56) 
Larache was held by Spain.
 The medina is reached  
from Place de la Libération,  
a very Spanish plaza, and 
through Bab el-Khemis, a 
brick-built gate roofed with 
glazed tiles. In the fabrics 
souk – the kissaria (socco 
de la alcaicería) – a market 
offers a wide range of goods. 
Narrow streets lined with 
houses with floral decoration 
lead down towards the  
harbour. Bab el-Kasba  
separates the southern edge 
of the fabrics souk from Rue 
Moulay el-Mehdi, a street  
covered with overhead arches 
that leads to an octagonal 
minaret and a terrace over-
looking the meandering  
Wadi Loukkos, salt-marshes 
and the Lixus promontory.
 Not far from Lixus is the 
Château de la Cigogne 
(Stork’s Castle), a fortress  
that was built in 1578 by  
the Saadian rulers and then 
remodelled by the Spanish  
in the 17th century. It is 
closed to the public.
 It is pleasant to stroll along 
the seafront – the “balcony  
of the Atlantic”. Nearby is  
the Moorish market. Finally, 
in the Catholic Cemetery, the 
tomb of the French writer 
Jean Genet (1910–86) can be 
found, lying facing the ocean.

This ancient site, which  
commands a view of the 
ocean, of Wadi Loukkos and 
of Larache, is to become one 
of UNESCO’s World Heritage 
Sites. According to legend, 
this is where one of the 
Labours of Hercules –  
picking the golden apples  
in the Garden of the  
Hesperides – took place. 
The ancient Roman writer 
Plinius, writing in the 7th 
century BC, described Lixus 
as the most ancient  
Phoenician colony in the 
western Mediterranean.
 In the 7th century BC the 
Phoenicians established a 
trading post here, serving as  
a stage on the Gold Route. 
After it had been taken by 
the Romans between 40 and 
45 AD, Lixus became a colo-

This small Andalusian-style 
town is enclosed within  
ramparts. The narrow streets 
are paved or limed, and lined 
with houses fronted by  
balconies with restrained 
mashrabiyya, and with blue- 
or green-painted woodwork.
 The Criquia jetty, northwest 
of the town, overlooks a tiny 
cemetery with tombstones 
covered in glazed tiles. At the 
foot of the square tower on 
Place Ibn Khaldoun stands 
Bab el-Bahr (Gate of the Sea). 
On the opposite side of the 
square, Bab Homar (Gate  
of the Land), with the Portu-
guese royal coat of arms, 
leads out from the ramparts 
and into the new town.
 In summer, the Centre 
Hassan II des Rencontres

Established by the  
Phoenicians, Asilah was an 
important town in Maure-
tania’s pre-Roman period 
(when coins were minted 
here), and also under the 
Romans. It was captured by 
the Portuguese in 1471 and 
became a centre of trade  
with connections to the  
Mediterranean countries. The 
town came under Moroccan 
control in 1691, during the 
reign of Moulay Ismaïl.
 At the end of the 19th  
century, Raissouli, a pretender 
to power and a brigand, 
extortioner and kidnapper, 
made Asilah his base. In 
1906, taking advantage of the 
intrigues that surrounded the 
sovereign, Abdul Aziz, he 
assumed the mantle of pasha 
then that of governor of the 
Jebala. He built himself a  
palace facing the sea, from 
which he was expelled by  
the Spanish in 1924.

wall built around the city at 
that time reduced its inhabited

 The vats in which meat and 
fish were salted and garum 
made – Morocco’s major 
industry in Roman times –  
can be seen around the edges 
of the site. In the amphi-
theatre, with its circular arena, 
public games took place.
 The Acropolis above the 
town has its own walls; only 
on the western side, where 
there is a sheer drop, do they 
coincide with the town walls. 
An apsidal building, preceded 
by an atrium with a cistern, 
has been excavated. The 
Great Temple (1st century 
BC–1st century AD), to the 
south, features an arcaded 
area (courtyard). The cella, 
where the god dwelt, on the 
axis of the peristyle, backs 
onto an apsidal wall; opposite 
is a large semicircular apse 
with a mosaic floor.
Perhaps the burial place of an 
important local ruler, it consists 
of 200 monolithic standing

area about 55 m (180 ft) in 
circumference. Unique in the 
Maghreb and the Sahara, by 
its sheer size this monument 
is reminiscent of those seen  
in Spain. The type of pottery 
decorated with impressions  
of cardium shells and bronze 
weapons, which excavations 
have brought to light, are also 
identical to Spanish examples.

The town takes its name from 
a great fortress which, during 
the Almoravid and Almohad 
periods, controlled the road 
leading to the ports along the 
Straits of Gibraltar.
 It was at Wadi el-Makhazin 
nearby that the Battle of the 
Three Kings took place in 
1578. The conflict has been 
described as the “last crusade 
undertaken by the Christians 
of the Mediterranean”. It was 
instigated by the Saadian  
sultan El-Mutawakkil, who, 
having been driven from 
Morocco, was zealous for  
a crusade. In alliance with 
Sebastião I, king of Portugal, 
he made a bid to win back 
his kingdom. Sebastião,  
El-Mutawakkil and their 
opponent, the Saadian sultan 
Abd el-Malik (who was  
victorious over the invaders), 
all died in the battle. Moulay 
Ahmed, brother of Abd  
el-Malik, succeeded him, 
becoming known not only  
as Ahmed el-Mansour (“the 
Victorious”) but also as 
Ahmed el-Dhebi (“the  
Golden”), because of the  
ransom that he exacted.
 Ksar el-Kebir is, today,  
a sizeable country town. A 
particularly large souk is held 
here on Sundays: goods on 
offer include the produce of 
local market gardens, as well 
as that of the area’s olive 
plantations and citrus groves.

Banasa r
Road map D2. 103 km (64 miles) 
northeast of Rabat on the N1 or 
Rabat-Tangier freeway (Kenitra 
North exit).
This ancient town, an inland 
port on Wadi Sebou and the 
most developed in  
Mauretania Tingitana, was a 
centre of ceramic production 
from the 3rd century and  
during the 1st century BC.  
A Roman colony from 33  
to 25 BC, Banasa was a  
prosperous and bustling  
commercial town until the 
end of the 3rd century AD.
 The entrance to the town, 
through a vaulted gateway, 
leads to the basilica and the 
paved and arcaded forum. 
South of the forum rises the 
capitol, where several altars 
stand before the temple’s five 
cellae (chambers). In the  
public baths to the west, the 
various rooms for the Roman 
ritual of bathing – robing 
rooms, a caldarium and tepi-
darium (hot and warm rooms) 
with underfloor heating, and 
frigidarium (cold room) can 
be distinguished. Wall paint-
ings and a brick floor paved 
in a herringbone pattern can 
be made out in another bath-
house at a lower level.
 A famous document 
engraved on bronze was  
discovered at Banasa. Known 
as the Banasa Table, it was 
an edict by which Caracalla 
granted the province relief 
from taxes in return for lions, 
elephants and other animals 
that the emperor desired for 
public spectacles in Rome.
 From the N1 or freeway, 
Banasa is reached by taking 
the R413, then, 3 km (2 miles) 
before Souk Tleta du Rharb, 
by turning off onto the P4234. 
As it approaches the site, the 
road is reduced to a track.

During the reigns of Juba II and 
Ptolemy, kings of Mauretania 
who ruled under the aegis of 
Rome, towns were established  
in Morocco. Under Roman con-
trol, they developed either into 
coloniae (colonies such as Lixus 
and Banasa) or municipiae (free 
towns such as Sala and Volubilis).
 The inhabitants, who grew 
prosperous through the cultivation of 
the land, endowed their towns with 
such civic features as forums, basilicas, 
capitols and triumphal arches. Adapting 
to the Roman way of life, they built 
houses with columned courtyards 
and mosaic floors in the Roman 
style, and imported bronze sculp-
tures from Egypt and Italy and 
pottery from Etruria. Public and 
private baths fulfilled the desire 
for personal cleanliness and 
also acted as places in which to 
socialize. The arcades along the 
decumanus maximus (main thorough- 
fare) were filled with shops, while  
cottage industries were established 
around the edges of the town.

Roman Towns in Morocco

As Rome imposed political unity,  
so Roman artistic influence spread 
throughout the Maghreb.
Mauretania’s cities 
were centres of trade and 
administration, as well  
as garrison towns. As in 
Rome, the focal point was 
the forum (a market place 
and public area) and the 
basilica, simultaneously a 
monetary exchange, law 
court and meeting place. 
The capitol was the city’s 
religious centre.

ROMAN RULE
Juba II was made king of 
Mauretania by Augustus. 
After Ptolemy’s death, the 
province was administered 
by Rome under Claudius. 
Triumphal arches were built 
during the reigns of Com-
modius and Caracalla. In 
the late 3rd century, under 
Diocletian, the country  
was administered with  
the province of Spain.

Casablanca’s Hassan II Mosque, seen from the sea
In the 7th century, Casablanca was no 
more than a small Berber settlement 
clinging to the slopes of the Anfa hills. 
However, for strategic and commercial 
reasons, it was already attracting the 
attention of foreign powers. In 1468, 
the town was sacked by the  
Portuguese, who wrought 
wholesale destruction on 
the city’s privateer ships. 
Then, in the 18th cen-
tury, with the sultanate  
of Sidi Mohammed ben 
Abdallah, Dar el-Beïda 
(meaning “White House” – “Casa  
Blanca” in Spanish) acquired a new  
significance. This was thanks to its 
harbour, which played a pivotal role 
in the sugar, tea, wool and corn mar-
kets of the Western world. But it was 
in the 20th century, under the French  
Protectorate (see pp56–7), that 
Casablanca underwent the most  
profound change. 
Against expert advice,  
Marshal Lyautey,  
the first resident-
governor, proceeded 
with plans to make  
Casablanca the country’s  
economic hub. To realize this 
vision, he hired the services of 
town planners and modernized the 
port. For almost 40 years, the most 
innovative architects worked on this 
huge building project. Casablanca 
continued to expand even after inde-
pendence. Futuristic high-rise buil-
dings and a colossal mosque sending 
its laser beams towards Mecca once 
again expressed the city’s forward-
l o o k i n g  s p i r i t .  W i t h  a b o u t  
3.5 million inhabitants, Casablanca is, 
today, one of the four largest metro-
polises on the African continent, and 
its port is the busiest in Morocco.
CASABLANCA
S
traddling east and west, Casablanca, the commercial and 
financial capital of Morocco, is a baffling metropolis where  
tradition and modernity co-exist. A city where skyscrapers stand 
in stark contrast to the small shops of the medina, with its narrow, 
winding streets, this is where the prosperous rub shoulders with paupers.

Exploring Casablanca
The centre of the new town (Ville 
Nouvelle) revolves around two 
focal points: the Place des Nations 
Unies and the Place Mohammed V, 
squares that are lined with fine 
1930s buildings. To the north, the 
old medina is still enclosed within 
ramparts, while the Parc de la Ligue 
Arabe, Casablanca’s green lung, 
extends to the southeast. Further out, 
towards the west, is the residential  
district of Anfa and the coastal resort of 
Aïn Diab. The Boulevard de la Corniche 
leads to the monumental Hassan II 
Mosque. The Quartier Habous, a modern 
medina built in the 1920s, also features 
some interesting architecture.

GETTING AROUND
Allow at least one day to explore  
Casablanca. The old medina and the new 
town, with their fine architectural herit-
age, are best seen on foot. By contrast, 
the Quartier Habous and the Hassan II  
Mosque can be reached only by motor-
ized transport. Parking is not a problem 
as there are many car parks. It is also  
possible to travel around Casablanca 
by bus or petit taxi. Bus and 
tram routes serve both  
the city centre and 
outlying districts.

Place des Nations 
Unies 1
South of the old medina.
At the beginning of the 20th 
century, this was still no more 
than a market square, a place 
which, by evening, would 
become the haunt of  
storytellers and snake  
charmers. Today, it  
is the heart of the 
new town, a hub 
where major  
thoroughfares 
converge.
 When the square 
was laid out in 
1920, it was known 
as Place de France, 
but was later 
renamed. Beneath the arcades 
of 1930s apartment blocks are 
rows of brasserie terraces and 
souvenir shops. In the  
northeast corner of the 
square, the clocktower,  
which dates from 1910, was 
demolished in 1940 and then 
rebuilt to an identical design. 
At the time that it was built, 
the clock symbolized colonial 
rule, indicating to the  
population that it should  
now keep in time with an 
industrial society.

memories of Humphrey  
Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, 
stars of the famous film  
Casablanca, made in 1943  
by Michael Curtiz, hang on

Avenue des Forces 
Armées Royales 2
South of the old medina, running 
between Place Oued el-Makhazine 
and Place Zellaga.
Lined with high-rise buildings, 
major hotels such as the  
Sheraton and Royal Mansour, 
with airline offices and travel 
agents and the 
towering, futur-
istic glass building 
of Omnium Nord 
Africain (ONA), this 
avenue marks the 
boundary of the 
commercial district. 
Further develop-
ment is planned  
for its continuation 
towards the Mosque of  
Hassan II.
Boulevard 
Mohammed V 3
Running from Place des Nations 
Unies to Boulevard Hassan Seghir.
Running through the city like 
a spine, this boulevard links 
Place des Nations Unies with 
the railway station in the east 
of the city. When it was built 
in 1915, it was intended to be 
the major artery through the 
commercial heart of Casa-
blanca. On both sides,  
covered arcades house  
shops and restaurants.
 A raised strip sections off 
traffic and widens into a 
square level with the Central 
Market. The high-rise  
buildings here are notable for 
their façades, which feature 
loggias, columns, zellij tile-
balconies, which was the first 
of Morocco’s Art Deco hotels 
and is one of the square’s  
finest buildings. In 1934, the 
11-storey Moretti Milone 
apartment block, at the corner 
of Boulevard Houphouët 
Boigny, was the first high- 
rise building in central  
Casablanca. Boulevard  
Houphouët Boigny, lined  
with shops and restaurants, 
runs from the square to the 
port. At the end, on the right, 
the marabout of Sidi Belyout, 
patron saint and protector of 
Casablanca, stands in stark 
contrast to the neighbouring 
residential buildings.

Place  
Mohammed V 4
North of the Parc de la Ligue Arabe.
Exemplifying the architecture 
of the Protectorate, this 
square, the administrative 
heart of Casablanca,  
combines the monumentality 
of French architecture with 
Moorish sobriety. This is the 
location of the Préfecture, the 
law courts, the 
central post office, 
banks and cultural 
organizations.
 The Préfecture 
(by M. Boyer, 
1937), over which 
towers a Tuscan-
style campanile  
50 m (164 ft) high, 
stands on the southeastern 
side of the square. Its  
buildings are set around  
three courtyards, each with  
a tropical garden. The central 
stairway is framed by two 
huge paintings by Jacques 
Majorelle (see p243) depicting 
the festivities of a moussem 
and the performance of the 
ahwach, a Berber dance.
 Behind stands the Palais 
de Justice (law courts, 
designed by J. Marrast and 
completed in 1922). The 
strong verticality of the  
Moorish doorway, with  
its awning of green tiles,  
contrasts with the horizontal 
lines of the arcaded gallery, 
which are emphasized by  
a carved frieze running the 
length of the building.
 Two buildings set slightly 
back abut the façade of the 
law courts on either side. On 
the right is the Consulat de 
France (French Consulate, by 
A. Laprade, 1916), whose  
gardens contain an equestrian 
statue of Marshal Lyautey, by 
Cogné (1938), which stood in 
the centre of the square until 
Moroccan independence. On 
the left, in the northeastern 
corner, is the Cercle Militaire 
(by M. Boyer). To the north is 
the Post Office (A. Laforgue, 
1920), fronted by an open 
arcade decorated 
with zellij tile-
work and semi-
circular arches, 
which leads 
through to an  
Art Deco central 
hall within.
 Opposite, 
along Rue de 
Paris, a small area of greenery 
where people like to stroll 
gives a more picturesque feel 
to the square, in the centre  
of which is a monumental 
fountain dating from 1976. 
At certain times of day, the 
fountain plays music and 
gives light displays.
work and geometric carvings. 
Peculiar to the buildings of 
this period is the mixture of 
styles – Art Deco, on the one 
hand, seen in white façades 
of simple design, and the  
typically Moroccan, more  
decorative style on the other. 
Among the finest of these 
buildings are three residential 
blocks: the Glaoui (designed 
by M. Boyer, 1922), on the 
corner of Rue El-Amraoui  
Brahim; the Bessonneau 
(H. Bride, 1917), opposite  
the market; and the Asayag 
(M. Boyer, 1932), at the  
corner of Boulevard Hassan 
Seghir. The latter, very  
innovatory at the time it was 
built, is five storeys high and 
has three towers set around a 
central hub. From the fourth 
storey upwards, terraces 
extend the studio apartments. 
Buildings at numbers 47, 67 
and 73 are also fine examples, 
with overhanging loggias and 
rounded balconies.
 Another particular feature  
of Boulevard Mohammed V  
is its covered arcades, which 
are similar to the shopping 
arcades built during the same 
period (the 1920s) along the 
Champs-Élysées in Paris. 
Among the most interesting  
of these arcades is the  
Passage du Glaoui, which 
links Boulevard Mohammed V 
to Rue Allal ben-Abdallah.  
Lit by prismatic lamps, the 
arcade is punctuated by  
glass rotundas. Passage 
Sumica, opposite Passage 
du Glaoui, is closer to the  
Art Deco style. This runs 
through to Rue du Prince 
Moulay Abdallah, which 
The Palais de Justice, built in the Moorish style in 1922
also contains some notable 
1930s apartment blocks. This 
pedestrianized street is very 
popular with shoppers.
 In Rue Mohammed el-Quori, 
off Boulevard Mohammed V, 
stands the Rialto. This reno-
vated cinema is renowned  
for its fine ornamentation, 
stained-glass windows and  
Art Deco lighting.

South of Place Mohammed V 
(between Boulevard Rachidi and 
Boulevard Mohammed Zerktouni).
Laid out by the architect  
A. Laprade in 1919, this huge 
garden incorporates café  
terraces and is a popular 
place for a stroll. Avenues 
lined with impressively tall 
palm trees, ficus, arcades  
and pergolas frame some 
stunning formal flowerbeds. 
The streets surrounding the 
park, including Rue d’Alger, 
Rue du Parc and Boulevard 
Moulay-Youssef, contain Art 
Nouveau and Art Deco houses.
 Northwest of the park 
stands the Église du Sacré-
Cœur, built in 
1930–52 by 
Paul Tournon.

glass windows depict scenes 
from the life of the Virgin 
against motifs taken from 
Moroccan carpets. They are the 
work of G. Loire, a master-
craftsman from Chartres.

Between Boulevard des Almohades 
and Place des Nations Unies.
At the beginning of the 20th 
century, Casablanca consisted 
only of the old medina, which 
itself comprised no more than 
a few thousand inhabitants. 
The walls around the old 
town were 
originally 
pierced by 
four gates, 
two of which 
survive today. 
Bab Marra-
kech and Bab 
el-Jedid, on

side, face onto

daily market, with jewellers, 
barbers, public letter-writers 
and so on, stretches out along 
the length of the walls.
 Opposite the fishing  
harbour is the sqala, a 
fortified bastion built in  
the 18th century, during  
the reign of Sidi Mohammed 
ben Abdallah. Behind the  
bastion, the marabout 
(shrine) with a double  
crown of merlons contains 
the Tomb of Sidi Allal 
el-Kairouani, who became 
Casablanca’s first patron  
saint in 1350. Bab el-Marsa 
(Gate of the Sea), which 
opens onto Boulevard des 
Almohades, also dates from 
the 18th century. It was at  
this spot that the French  
disembarked in July 1907.
To the southwest is the Villa

ary Moroccan paintings.

A cannon in the sqala, facing 
the port and onto the ocean
is one of the largest artificial 
ports in the world. A groyne 
protects it from the pounding 
of the ocean that destroyed 
several earlier constructions. 
With its long piers, one of 
which stretches for more  
than 3 km (2 miles), the  
port is equipped with ultra-
modern commercial, fishing 
and leisure facilities.
 Access to the port complex 
is via the fishing harbour. On 
the seafront in the port itself, 
as well as along the avenue 
leading down to it, some 
excellent fish restaurants are 
to be found (see pp331–2).
 A marina covering a wide 
area and incorporating hotels, 
restaurants and shops is  
planned to open here in 2012.

In 1907, when innovative architects 
set to work to create buildings in a 
range of contemporary styles,  
Casablanca began to look like a 
huge building site. In the early 
1920s, numerous teams of architects 
were working in the city. Whatever 
the style, avant-garde tendencies 
were often counterbalanced by 
the traditional Moroccan style.
 Thus, as the architects drew  
on the repertoire of Neo- 
Classicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco, 
which were fashionable at the time, 
they also took inspiration from the 
Moorish style that Europeans  
found so fascinating. Towards the 
end of the 1920s and into the early 
1930s, a new taste for simplicity 
became apparent. Emphasizing 
shape and outline at the expense of 
decoration, this gave prominence  
to the interplay of convex and  
concave shapes, and to  
balconies and bow windows. 
Another significant factor was 
the expectations of the colonial 
population and of European  
speculators: lifts, bathrooms, kitchens 
and parking areas appeared.

FAÇADES
The façades of residential blocks were 
encrusted with putti, fruit, flowers and 
pilasters and featured roofs covered in 
green tiles, stucco and zellij tilework. 
Colonial houses, in the suburbs, were 
built in a style that was a cross be-
tween a grand Parisian town house and 
a Moroccan-style seaside residence.
Wrought-iron balconies, like this one  
from the Darius Boyer House, are typical 
of the Art Nouveau ironwork that often 
graced French windows and 
balconies.
This building has an elegantly  
classical appearance, with decoration 
consisting of columns, belvederes and 
a dome with Art Nouveau motifs.
1930s architecture  
features traditional 
Moorish elements, 
including semicircular 
arches and decoration 
in the form of carved 
stucco.
Mosaic decoration on the  
law courts consists of multi-
coloured zellij tilework in 
geometric shapes overlying a 
frieze of stucco carved with 
inscriptions.

With a prayer hall that can accommodate 25,000, the  
Hassan II Mosque is the second-largest religious building 
in the world after the mosque in Mecca. The complex 
covers 9 hectares (968,774 sq ft), two-thirds of it being 
built over the sea. The minaret, the lighthouse of  
Islam, is 200 m (656 ft) high, and two laser beams 
reaching over a distance of 30 km (18.5 miles) shine in 
the direction of Mecca. The building was designed by 
Michel Pinseau, 35,000 craftsmen worked on it, and it 
opened in 1993. With carved stucco, zellij tilework, a 
painted cedar ceiling and marble, onyx and travertine cladding, it is 
a monument to Moroccan architectural virtuosity and craftsmanship.

Quartier Habous 
(New Medina) 9
In the southeast of the city centre, 
near Boulevard Victor Hugo.
In the 1930s, in order to 
address the problem of an 
expanding urban population 
and to prevent Casablanca’s 
underprivileged citizens from 
being forced to settle in  
insalubrious quarters, French 
town planners laid out a new 
medina (Nouvelle Medina). 
Land to the south of the  
existing city centre earmarked 
for this development was 
given over to the Habous, the 
administration of religious 
foundations, hence the  
new town’s name.
 This new town – which did 
not, however, forestall the 
later development of shanty 
towns – was built in the  
traditional Arab style at the 
same time as obeying modern 
town planning and public 
health regulations. It contains 
public areas, such as a market, 
shops, mosques, a kissaria 
and baths, as well as private 
dwellings (arranged around  
a courtyard separated from 
the street by a solid wall).
 The new medina is another 
facet of colonial town plan-
ning during the Protectorate, 
and its flower-filled, arcaded 
streets offer the opportunity 
for a stroll in a scenic quarter 
of the city. While the most 
modest houses are located 
around the market, the finest 
are set around the mosque.
 Northeast of the medina are 
the copper and brass Souk 
and Chez Bennis, Casablanca’s 
most famous patisserie, which 
sells pastries known as cornes 
de gazelle (gazelles’ horns), 
fritters and pastilla. There 
are also shops specializing  
in curios and collectors’  
items, and they can be good 
places to find Art Deco 
objects. A wide range of 
Moroccan rugs and carpets  
is also on sale at the weekly 
auction in the carpet souk.
 Northwest of the Quartier 
Habous is the Mahakma du 
Pacha, a formal tribunal and 
today one of the city’s eight 
préfectures (administrative 
headquarters). The building 
(by A. Cadet, 1952), which 
centres around a tall tower 
and two courtyards, is a fine 
example of the adaptation of 
traditional Arab architecture 
to modern needs. The  
traditional Arabic decoration 
of its 64 rooms is the work  
of Moroccan craftsmen: it 
consists of carved stucco and 
zellij tilework on the walls, 
carved cedarwood panels  
on the ceiling and wrought 
iron on the doors.
 The Royal Palace, on the 
fringes of the Quartier des 
Habous and set in extensive 
Mediterranean gardens, was 
built in the 1920s by the  
Pertuzio brothers, whose aim 
was to create a luxuriously 
appointed yet modern dwelling.

Dominated by its two towers, 
which rise to a height of

complex is proof and symbol 
of the city’s economic  
importance. Built by Ricardo 
Bofill and Elie Mouyal, it 
comprises offices, shopping 
malls and a hotel. By its  
outward appearance no less 
than in its infrastructure, the 
building signals the economic 
role that Casablanca plays  
on both the national and 
international stage.

Corniche  
d’Aïn Diab e
West of the Mosque of Hassan II.
The Corniche d’Aïn  
Diab has been an 
upmarket part of  
Casablanca since the 
1920s. Running from 
the El-Hank Lighthouse 
(built in 1916) in the east,  
to the marabout of Sidi 
Abderrahman in the west,  
this coastal avenue is lined 
with a succession of tidal 
swimming pools, hotels,  
Under the impression that  
the location was to be the 
White House in Washington, 
they failed to prevent it from 
going ahead.
 During the meeting,  
President Roosevelt  
also formally pledged  
his support to Sultan 
Mohammed V in his aim 
to obtain independence 
from France, thus opening 
new avenues for Morocco 
in the postwar period.
Anfa w
Northwest of the city.
Occupying a hill that  
overlooks Casablanca from 
the northwest, Anfa is a  
residential quarter with  
wide flower-lined avenues 
where luxurious homes  
with terraces, swimming 
pools and lush gardens  
bring to mind Beverly Hills. 
Since the 1930s, villas in a 
great variety of styles have 
been built here, and they 
constitute a catalogue of  
successive architectural  
styles and fashions.
 It was at the Hôtel d’Anfa, 
now demolished, that the  
historic meeting between  
US president Franklin D.  
Roosevelt and British prime 
minister Winston Churchill 
took place in January 1943, 
during World War II, at which 
the date of the Allied landings 
in Normandy was decided. 
Although they got wind of  
the meeting, the Germans 
were misled by the literal 
translation of “Casablanca”. 
Mohammedia r
28 km (17 miles) northeast of 
Casablanca. £ @
At the beginning of the 20th 
century, Mohammedia  
(formerly called Fedala)  
was nothing more than a 
kasbah. This changed in 
the 1930s, when its port 
began to receive oil tank-
ers. Today, petroleum 
accounts for 16 per cent  
of all Moroccan port traf-
fic. Although the flaming 
chimneys of the refineries 
blight the landscape, this 
town of 150,000 habit-
ants, now part of greater 
Casablanca, is still  
residential. It has a golf 
course, a casino and a 
yacht club. Its fine  
beaches and friendly 
atmosphere have 
helped to turn Moham-
media also into an 
upmarket coastal resort 
for wealthy Moroccans.
 A visit to the kasbah and 
the fish market can be fol-
lowed by a stroll along the 
seafront. From the port, the 
clifftop walk offers fine views 
of the sea and Mohammedia.
restaurants, fashionable night-
clubs and an institute of 
thalassotherapy.
 The earliest establishments 
to be built here – with the 
needs of a wealthy clientèle 
in mind – opened in the 
1930s, one of them being  
La Réserve, a restaurant with 
panoramic views. It was built 
in 1934, right over the sea, 
and rests on piles driven into 
the sand. It is currently closed 
while it changes management.
 At the foot of the hill of 
Anfa, near the Palais Ibn 
Séoud, the foundation of 
the same name houses a 
mosque and one of the most 
comprehensive libraries on 
the African continent. At the 
western end of the Corniche, 
3 km (2 miles) further on,  
the Marabout of Sidi Abder-
rahman, perched on a rock, 
is accessible only at low tide. 
It attracts Muslim pilgrims  
suffering from nervous  
disorders and those who have 
had evil spells cast on them.

Morocco’s southern Atlantic coastal 
area contains many smaller towns and 
resorts, which are especially attractive 
to those who wish to escape the fre-
netic activity of the imperial cities.
This region, more than almost 
any other part of Morocco, has 
always had contact with the 
outside world. The Phoeni-
cians, then the Romans, 
established trading posts 
here. The Portuguese 
and the Spanish built 
military strongholds 
and centres of trade along the coast, 
whose topography also made it a haven 
for pirates. Fortified towns like El-Jadida, 
Safi and, most especially, Essaouira bear 
witness to the Spanish and Portuguese 
contribution to Morocco’s history. Under 
the French Protectorate, the region 
became the country’s economic and 
administrative centre. Today, this stretch 
of coastline is industrial 
and visibly oriented 
toward the modern 
world: most of the 
country’s phosphate 
is produced here, the  
industry attracting a large  
workforce from the interior.
The entire coastline, punctuated 
by scenic viewpoints over the ocean, 
is ideal for bird-watching and palaeon-
tology. Gourmets will also enjoy  
Oualidia’s famous oysters.
The road, excellent from Casablanca 
to Essaouira, passes stunningly beauti-
ful deserted beaches that are ideal for 
surfing. It winds on to Agadir, the great 
sardine-processing port and Morocco’s 
most popular coastal destination. The 
wild landscape is dominated by the 
curious argan tree, with goats climbing 
in its branches (see p127). It produces 
the highly prized argan oil.

SOUTHERN ATLANTIC COAST
L
ike the whole of Morocco’s Atlantic coastline, the area south of 
Casablanca is of variable interest to visitors. It is, however, 
worth the detour, as much for the architecture of the fortified 
towns built by the Portuguese, such as El-Jadida and Essaouira, as for 
the breathtaking coastal scenery. In addition, there is also the coastal 
resort of Oualidia, which has a very safe beach.

 This part of Morocco’s Atlantic coastline is punctuated 
by the fortified towns of Azemmour, El-Jadida, Safi and 
Essaouira, which were established by the Portuguese in 
the 15th and 16th centuries. The road running inland from 
Settat to Boulaouane crosses a stunningly beautiful plateau, 
carved out of the landscape by Wadi Oum er-Rbia (Mother 
of Spring), where all the colours of the splendid Doukkala 
region can be seen. Further south, the road leading to 
Agadir offers interesting tours up into the lower foothills of 
the High Atlas. In the 1970s, the most accessible part of the 
foothills was given the name Paradise Valley. The well-
marked road that winds between luxuriant cascades 
provides points of departure for hikes in the 
mountains, and it eventually leads to Imouzzer 
des Ida Outanane, a quiet summer resort. 
Exploring the Southern Atlantic Coast
 GETTING AROUND 
 A motorway runs between Casablanca 
and El-Jadida, which is a distance of 
99 km (62 miles). From here, the N1 
is the quickest route to Agadir. This 
major road goes inland from El-Jadida 
as far as Essaouira, 360 km (224 miles) 
from Casablanca, and runs near or 
actually on the coast for the 165 km 
(103 miles) between Essaouira and 
Agadir. The R301, a minor road that 
is more scenic because it follows the 
coast, runs between El-Jadida and 
Essaouira, passing through Oualidia 
and Safi, 241 km (150 miles) from 
Casablanca. A motorway and the N9 
run inland from Casablanca towards 
Settat (and Marrakech). From Settat, 
the R316 leads to Kasbah Boulaouane, 
from where it is easy to rejoin the 
coast road.

A crossroads between north 
and south, Settat is the capital 
of a province with some 
850,000 inhabitants. It is the 
economic hub of the Chaouia, 
a coastal plain that is known as 
Morocco’s grainstore. While the 
north of the region is famous 
for its fertile agricultural land, 
the southern part is given 
over to livestock (chaoui 
means “breeder of sheep”).
 When Moulay Ismaïl built 
the Kasbah Ismaïla, at the  
end of the 17th century, the 
security and stability of the 
region – which was traversed 
by major caravan routes – 
was strengthened. The sultan 
would stay in the kasbah on 
his travels between Fès and 
Marrakech. Vestiges of the 
building can still be seen  
in the modern town.
 Today, Settat offers little of 
interest to tourists. However, 
under the aegis of Driss Basri, 
a native of the region and 
Minister of the Interior for 
almost 20 years, it stood as a 
model of urban development 
in the 1990s. The merits of this 
distinction can be seen from 
Place Hassan II, in the town 
centre, in the arrangement of 
open spaces and of pedestrian 
and shopping areas, and in 
buildings combining Art Deco 
and Moorish styles.
Kasbah 
Boulaouane 2
Road map C3.
Located in a meander of  
Wadi Oum er-Rbia, this  
kasbah stands on a promon-
tory in the heart of a forested 
area covering 3,000 hectares 
(7,400 acres). It was apparent-
ly built by the Almohads, who 
made it an imperial stopping 
place on the road running 
along the coast and inland to 
Fès. At the beginning of the 
16th century, it was the scene 
of a battle that halted the 
advance of the Portuguese 
towards the interior. Moulay 
Ismaïl revitalized the village 
by choosing to build a  
kasbah here in 1710 – in  
an attempt to pacify and  
control the region.
 The stone-built fortress is 
encircled by a crenellated 
wall set with bastions and 
pierced by an angled gate 
with three pointed arches. 
Above the gate is an  
inscription with the name of 
Moulay Ismaïl and the date  
of the kasbah’s foundation.
 This gate, which accom-
modated sentries, is the  
only point of entry into the 
fortress. It leads through to 
the sultan’s palace, which  
is built around a central 
courtyard with mosaic  
decoration. Beside the  
palace, a square tower  
about 10 m (33 ft) high,  
and now disfigured by  
cracks, afforded a vantage 
point over the surrounding 
territory. Disused vaulted 
armouries were used for  
storing food supplies. The 
mosque, with five aisles,  
is in a very bad state of  
preservation. Next to it is the 
tomb of a saint named Sidi 
Mancar, whom the region’s 
inhabitants still revere today, 
since he is believed to have 
the power to cure paralysis 
and sterility.
 Ceaselessly battered by the 
elements, the kasbah has  
suffered deterioration over 
the centuries. It was declared 
a historic monument in 1922. 
A restoration programme has 
been under way since 1995,

BOULAOUANE WINE
Connoisseurs consider that the wine known 
as Gris de Boulaouane, a rosé with an orange 
tint, is one of the best Moroccan wines.  
Although the Romans successfully 
exploited the soil and climate of 
Mauretania Tingitana to grow vines, 
the establishment of Islam in the 
Maghreb did not further the  
upkeep of the vineyards. Under 
the French Protectorate, the  
vineyards were revived, and in 
1956 wine production passed  
into state control. The state-
owned company that marketed Gris de Boulaouane collapsed, however, and 
the quality of the wine deteriorated. The French company Castel retook control 
of Moroccan wine production in the 1990s: the old vines were dug up and new 
stock planted, this time Cabernet-Sauvignon, Merlot, Cinsault, Syrah and 
Grenache gris. Today, Moroccan vineyards cover 350 hectares (865 acres) in the 
district of Boulaouane, the Doukkala region, the foothills of the Atlas and along 
the Atlantic coast. The vines are planted in sand, the heat of which prevents 
the development of phylloxera. The grapes are hand-harvested at the end of 
August and the wine, bottled in France, is exported mostly to Europe.

come here. The narrow white 
streets of the medina are  
peppered with architectural 
features recalling the former 
Portuguese presence – the 
style of the doors being  
particularly prominent in this 
respect. The town also has a 
tradition of Portuguese-style 
embroidery, which features 
dragons and lions depicted

Entry into the old town is 
through a gateway that leads 
to Place Mohammed ben-
Abdallah. The walls were 
originally fortified with five 
bastions but only four of 
these were rebuilt after the 
Portuguese had destroyed the 
town as they escaped Sidi 
Mohammed in 1769. The  
rampart walk leads to the 
Bastion de l’Ange, which 
commands a panoramic  
view over the old town. The 
Bastion de St Sébastien was 
once the seat of the Inquisi-
tion’s tribunal and the prison.
+ Medina
The main street leads to the 
sea gate (Porta do Mar), from 
where there is access to the 
rampart walk. This gate, now 
blocked in, once linked the 
town to the seashore.  
Halfway along the main  
street is the entrance to the 
Citerne Portugaise, originally 
an underground arsenal, 
which is one of El-Jadida’s 
most interesting sights and 
should not be missed.
 The mellah has a deserted 
air: most of the Jewish  
community emigrated to  
Israel in the early 1950s.
El-Jadida 4
The Portuguese settled here in 1502 and built a fort  
that they named Mazagan. In time, the town became a 
major centre of trade, and ships from Europe and the 
East anchored here to take on provisions. In 1769, the 
sultan Sidi Mohammed expelled the Portuguese, who 
dynamited it as they fled. It was resettled by local Arab 
tribes and a large Jewish community from Azemmour  
at the beginning of the 19th century. The town was 
then known as El-Jadida (The New One), but  
temporarily reassumed its original name – Mazagan –

The Portuguese built this underground “cistern”  
in 1514. First an arsenal, then an armoury, it 
came to be used as a cistern only  
in 1541. The reflection of the 
columns and the vaulting on 
the water is an unreal 
and mysterious 
sight.
A well, 3.5 m (11.5 ft)  
across, was sunk through  
the central span, allowing  
daylight to enter.
The vaults  
rest on five lines  
of columns.
The cistern takes the  
form of a square 34 m by  
33 m (111 ft by 108 ft).
The 25 pillars  
are reflected in the  
stagnant water.

The origins of this fishing  
village lie in a 12th-century 
Almohad settlement which was 
then known as Tit. The old 
site’s impressive ruins can still 
be seen today, together with a 
minaret dating from the same 
period as that of the Koutoubia 
Mosque in Marrakech (see 
pp236–7). The settlement was, 
at that time, a ribat, or fortified 
monastery, built around the 
cult of the saint Moulay 
Abdallah, whose purpose was 
to guard the coast. It became a 
busy port, but was destroyed 
in the early 16th century to 
prevent the Portuguese, who 
were at Azemmour, from  
taking it. The fishing industry 
revived the village, which then 
assumed the name of the saint 
in whose honour it was esta-
blished. The moussem held 
here in August is renowned 
for its fantasias (see p35).
Environs
From the coast road leading 
south from Moulay Abdallah 
you can see the huge installa-
tions of the mineral Port de 
Jorf Lasfar, the largest port 
in Africa. Built in the 1980s,  
it has a chemical complex 
and petrol refinery.
Oualidia 6
Road map B3. * 3,000. @ ( Sat.
This small coastal resort  
takes its name from the sultan 
El-Oualid, who built a kasbah 
here in 1634. The rather  
unattractive town centre leads 
through to a stunningly  
beautiful beach on the edge 
of a lagoon. Swimming is safe 
here but on either side, the 
sea is rough and foaming. 
This is one of the beaches on 
the Atlantic coast that is good 
for surfing, particularly for 
beginners. Among the sum-
mer villas here is the resi-
dence built for Mohammed V.
 The town is an important 
centre of the oyster industry. 
A visit to the oyster farms 
(parcs à huitres), particularly 
Oyster Farm N° 7 – including 
the opportunity to sample 
some oysters – is a pleasant 
way to pass some time. The 
Ostrea restaurant and hotel is 
also located here.

clifftop leads to Cap 
Beddouza, and on to Safi.
OUALIDIA OYSTERS
Lovers of seafood hold Oualidia oysters in especially high 
esteem. The species of edible oyster that is raised in the 
local oyster farms is related to those from the Marennes-
Oléron region of France, 
which were imported in the 
1950s. Oyster Farm No. 7, 
which was set up in 1992 
in the lagoon here, is one 
of the most modern in 
Morocco. The oysters and 
other shellfish that are 
farmed here are raised 
according to stringent  
European health and 
hygiene regulations.

# 9am–1pm & 3–6pm daily. &
This former armoury, in the 
Manueline Gothic style, was 
converted into a cistern after 
the citadel was enlarged in 
1541. It was then constantly 
fed by fresh water so as to 
guarantee the town’s water 
supply in the event of a  
prolonged siege. Rediscovered 
by chance in 1916 when a 
shopkeeper was knocking 
down a wall to enlarge his 
shop, it has fascinated many 
artists as well as visitors. Orson 
Welles used it as a location 
for certain scenes of his film 
Othello, released in 1952.

An important Moroccan port 
since the 16th century, the 
town of Safi is today an 
industrial centre and a major 
sardine-processing port. It 
owes its importance to the 
growth of the fishing industry 
and to the processing and 
export of phosphates, as well 
as to its pottery. A rapidly 
expanding town, Safi has an 
interesting medina as well as 
traces of its Portuguese history.
P Medina
The area covered by the 
medina takes the form of a 
triangle whose widest side 
faces onto the coast. Rue du 
Souk, lined with shops and 
workshops, leads to Bab 
Chaaba (Gate of the Valley). 
Near the Grand Mosque, 
south of the medina, is  
the Portuguese Chapel, 
originally the choir of 
Safi’s cathedral, built by 
the Portuguese in 1519.

This small fortress, also 
known as the Château 
de la Mer, overlooks 
the sea. It was built by the 
Portuguese at the beginning 
of the 16th century, and 
served as a residence for the 
governor, then for the sultans 
in the 17th century. On the 
esplanade are cannons cast in 
Spain, Portugal and Holland.

known as the Kechla, encloses 
a mosque and garden dating 
from the 18th and 19th centu-
ries. Since 1990 the Kechla 
has housed the Musée 
National de la Céramique, 
which contains displays  
of traditional and modern 
ceramics, including blue-
on-white wares made in 
Safi, pottery from Fès and 
Meknès, and pieces by 
Boujmaa Lamali 
(1890–1971).
P Colline des Potiers
In the Bab Chaaba 
district, craftsmen can 
be seen making the ceramic 
wares that have made Safi 
famous. Finished pieces are 
displayed and offered for sale 
in commercial showrooms and 
visitors can follow the various 
stages of pottery production 
at the training school.

This kasbah forms part of a 
system of fortified outposts 
that Moulay Ismaïl (see 
pp54–5) established along the 
main routes of communication 
so as to control the region 
and accommodate travellers.
 The kasbah is encircled by 
an outer wall, within which 
stand a mosque and various 
buildings, now in ruins. An 
inner wall, set with square 
towers and reinforced by a 
dry moat, surrounds a court-
yard that is lined with shops, 
various houses and a chapel.
Chiadma Region 9
Road map B3–4.
The territory of the Chiadma, 
in the provinces of Safi and 
Essaouira, is inhabited by 
Regraga Berbers. They are 
descended from seven saint 
apostles of Islam, who, during 
a journey to Mecca, were 
directed by the Prophet 
Mohammed to convert the 
Maghreb to Islam. In spring,  
a commemorative pilgrimage 
is made, ending at the small 
village of Ha Dra.
 A souk, one of the most 
authentic markets in the  
area, takes place in Ha  
Dra on Sunday mornings. 
Grain, spices, animals and a 
wide range of goods, mostly 
food, are offered for sale.

Sardine fishing in Essaouira uses 
swivel nets. In spite of their expert 
knowledge of the sea bed, the  
fishermen often have to repair 
damaged nets when they return  
to harbour every day.
Small trawlers, many of them made of wood, as well as 
motorized dinghies, ply the coastal waters as far out to sea 
as the edge of the Continental Shelf. Their catches consist of 
many different species of fish.
Sea Fishing in Morocco
The eateries in 
Essaouira’s  
harbour invite 
customers to  
select a plateful  
of fish and eat it 
on the spot. Many 
such establish-
ments are to be 
found in the  
port, at the exit 
from the sqala.
Crates of fish are packed ready for sale. Sar-
dines are the most important catch, but other fish, 
including hake and grey mullet, are also on offer.
Consernor, the  
canning company, 
is one of Safi’s 
major industries.  
It revitalized the 
local economy  
in the 1920s.
The fish market at Agadir, one of the 
largest sardine ports in the world, was 
modernized only a few years ago. Every 
day, an auction of almost 250 different 
kinds of fish takes place here.
The Moroccan coastline, which is  
more than 3,500 km (2,175 miles) 
long, faces both the Atlantic Ocean 
and the Mediterranean Sea, and gives 
the country access to some of the  
richest fishing grounds in the world – 
with some 240 species of fish.  
Morocco brings in the largest catches 
of fish in the whole of Africa. Its pre-
eminence is due especially to  
sardines, of which Morocco is the  
largest processor and exporter in the 
world. Coastal fishing has created a 
major canning industry, too. The 
Moroccan sea fishing industry  
employs some 200,000 people and 
exports bring in US $600 million per 
year. Modern fishing methods,  
however, have not completely  
replaced traditional ways.

With the brilliant whiteness of its lime-
washed walls and the sight of women 
enveloped in voluminous haiks, 
Essaouira, formerly Mogador, is a quint-
essentially Moroccan town and one of 
the most enchanting places in the  
country. By virtue of its location on this stretch of the 
Atlantic coast, where trade winds prevail almost all 
year-round, the town enjoys a particularly pleasant 
climate. It is a prime location for surfing, but has 
managed to escape mass tourism. A mecca for  
hippies during the 1970s, it is still an artists’ town  
and is very fashionable with independent travellers.
Exploring Essaouira
In the 7th century BC, the 
Phoenicians founded a base 
on the site where Essaouira 
now stands, and in the 1st 
century BC Juba II made it a 
centre of the manufacture of 
purple dye. The Portuguese 
established a trading and  
military bridgehead here in 
the 15th century, and 
named it Mogador. 
The town itself,  
however, was not built 
until around 1760, by 
the Alaouite sultan Sidi 
Mohammed ben Ab-
dallah (Mohammed III), 
who had decided to 
set up a naval base 
here. The town, the 
harbour and the  
fortifications, in the 
style of European  
fortresses, were  
designed and built  
by Théodore Cornut,  
a renowned French  
architect who had 
worked for Louis XV.
+ Ramparts
On the side facing the sea, 
the outer walls, which have 
bevelled crenellations, were 
designed to give protection 
from naval attack and are  
thus typical of European  
fortifications. By contrast,  
the inner walls, which have 
square crenellations and are 
similar to the fortifications 
around Marrakech, are Islamic 
in style. These are built in 
stone and roughcast with  
a facing of earth. The walls 
are pierced by gates – Bab 
Sebaa on the southern side, 
Bab Marrakech on the eastern 
side and Bab Doukkala on 
the northeastern side – that 
lead into the medina.
+ Sqalas
Two sqalas (sea bastions) 
were built to protect the 
town: the Sqala de la Ville, 
in the northwest, and the 
Sqala du Port, in the south.
 The Sqala de la Ville con-
sists of a crenellated platform 
featuring a row of Spanish 
cannons and defended at its 
northern end by the North 
Bastion. This was built by 
Théodore Cornut on the site 
of the Castello Real, a citadel 
constructed by the Portuguese 
in about 1505. The esplanade 
(where scenes from Orson 
Welles’ film Othello were shot 
in 1949) commands a view of 
the ocean and the Îles Purpu-
raires. A covered passage 
leads from the bastion to  
the former munitions stores, 
which now house marquetry 
workshops.
Port
Sqala du Port. # daily. &
The Porte de la Marine, lead-
ing to the docks, is crowned 
by a classical triangular pedi-
ment and dominated by two 
imposing towers flanked by 
four turrets. The rectangular 
Sqala du Port is surmounted 
by battlements.
 From the 18th century, 40 
per cent of Atlantic sea traffic 
passed through Essaouira. It 
became known as the Port of 
Timbuctu, being the destina-
tion of caravans from sub-
Saharan Africa bringing goods 
for export to Europe. Once

sardine ports, Essaouira now 
provides a living for no more 
than 500 to 600 families. But it 
still has its traditional ship-
yard, where vessels are made 
out of wood. Visitors can also 
watch the fish auction and 
sample freshly grilled sardines.
P Medina
The layout of Essaouira is 
unusual because it was 
planned before the town was 
developed. It was laid out by 
the French architect Cornut, 
who, between 1760 and 1764, 
built the Sqala de la Ville and 
the Sqala du Port, endowing 
them with fortifications and 
outer and inner walls.
 As elsewhere in Morocco, 
the medina in Essaouira is  
a labyrinth of narrow streets; 
the town itself, by contrast, 
has straight, wide streets laid 
out at right angles to one 
another and cut by gateways. 
The Grand Mosque is situated 
in the heart of the medina. 
Further north, the market, 
Souk Jdid, is divided into four 
by the intersection of two 
thoroughfares: there is a  
daily souk for fish, spices  
and grains, and a souk for 
second-hand and collectable 
items, known as joutia.

MARQUETRY
Essaouira’s cabinet- 
makers were already 
renowned in antiquity,  
and the town has 
remained the capital of 
marquetry ever since.  
Tradition dictates that  
the artistically skilled  
part of the work (from  
the construction of a  
piece to its decoration)  
be done by men. Women 
and children are given  
the task of polishing the 
finished items.
THE THUYA 
GNARL
This excrescence, 
which grows on  
certain trees,  
particularly  
the thuya, is very 
sought after by  
cabinet-makers for  
its veined and  
speckled appearance.
Working with Thuya
Craftsmen apply all their ingenuity and 
imagination to produce novel shapes.
The high sheen of this bread 
box is produced by  
polishing the surface with 
methylated spirit and 
gum arabic. Linseed oil 
feeds the wood and  
prevents it from  
developing cracks.
The decoration of this 
dish is based on a 
geometric  
scheme. The  
border pattern 
consists of an 
inlay of  
alternating  
pieces of ebony 
and citron wood.
The thuya gnarl is  
separated from the trunk.
Thuya, a highly prized wood with a 
delicious perfume, grows abundantly 
in the region of Agadir and Essaouira, 
and has been the source of that latter’s 
prosperity. Thuya is a very dense 
hardwood, and almost every part of 
the tree apart from the branches can 
be used: the trunk, with its relatively 
light-coloured wood; the stump, used 
for making small objects; and the 
gnarl, a rare excrescence streaked 
with brown and pink. The gnarl is 
polished, inlaid with decorative motifs 
in citron wood, mother-of-pearl or 
ebony and sometimes with threads of 
silver or copper, or slivers of camel 
bone. It is used to make such items as 
coffee tables, caskets, small statues, 
boxes in all shapes and sizes, trays 
and jewellery. The country’s best 
marquetry craftsmen can be seen 
working at this traditional craft in the 
former munitions stores beneath 
Essaouira’s ramparts.

P Former Mellah
From Bab Doukkala, accessible via 
Rue Mohammed Zerktouni. 
 Controlled access.
Having risen to prominence 
and prosperity in the 18th  
and 19th centuries, the Jewish 
community in Essaouira came 
to hold an important  
economic position in the 
town, and Jewish jewellers 
acquired wide renown.
 The town’s former Jewish 
quarter is no longer inhabited 
by Jews, but on Rue Darb 
Laalouj the former houses  
of Jewish businessmen can 
still be seen; they are now 
converted into shops. In  
contrast to Muslim houses, 
they are fronted by balconies 
opening onto the street and 
some have lintels with 
inscriptions in Hebrew.
 Rue Mohammed Zerktouni, 
the main street in the quarter, 
has a very lively market.  
Leaving by Bab Doukkala, 
you will pass the austere  
Jewish cemetery, which is 
worth a visit. (The keys are 
available on request from  
the caretaker.)
R Église Notre-Dame
Avenue El-Moukaouama, south of 
the post office. 5 8:30am Mon–Sat, 
10am Sun. Tel (0524) 47 58 95.
This Catholic church stands 
outside the walls of the  
medina, on the road leading 
to the beach. It is the only 
church in the country where 
the bells are rung on Sundays 
to summon the faithful to 
mass at 11am.
 Most of the church furnish-
ings are made of thuya wood. 
On an alternating basis, the 
services here are said in one 
of four languages: French, 
English, Dutch or German.
} Beach
Essaouira’s beach, to the 
south of the town centre, is 
known as one of the finest  
in Morocco. All through the 
summer, the trade winds  
keep this part of the coast 
surprisingly cool. At times, 
however, the gusty winds  
are so strong that they  
drive people to seek  
shelter in the medina.
 At the estuary of 
Wadi Qsob, on the  
far side of the beach, 
vestiges of the system 
of defences built on  
a rocky promontory 
by the sultan Sidi 
Mohammed are  
visible. Although  
they have  
crumbled, thick  
walls can still be made out.
 By following the wadi 
upstream, after a tumbled-
down bridge, you reach the 
village of Diabet. It is also 
accessible via the road to 
Agadir, turning off to the  
right after 7 km (4 miles). An 
interesting sight here are the 
ruins of Dar Soltane 
Mahdounia, a palace built by 
Sidi Mohammed ben Abdallah 
in the 18th century and now 
almost completely engulfed in 
sand. It inspired Jimi Hendrix 
(who lived in Diabet for  
several years) to write the 
song Castles in the Sand.
 Surfers will particularly 
enjoy the many beaches each 
side of Essaouira. Thanks to 
the enterprise of dynamic 
local associations, Morocco is 
about to become one of the 
top destinations for surfers 
and windsurfers. (The Océan 
Vagabond café is a good 
place to hire surfing  
equipment.) The windiest 
time of year in the Essaouira 
area, and therefore the best 
time for surfing and  
windsurfing here, is from 
April to September.  
However, while the air,  
at 20–30 °C 
(68–86 °F),  
is always 
pleasantly warm, the  
water is always a very cool 
16–18 °C (61–64 °F).
 South of Essaouira, at  
Cap Sim (beyond Diabet) 
and at Sidi Kaouki, and 
to the north, at Moulay 
Bouzerktoun, the waves are 
very strong, and safe only 
for experienced surfers.
 Also to the south, at  
Tafelney (beyond the village 
of Smimou), there is a  
magnificent bay where the 
water is warmer. In spite of 
the constant gusty wind, it is 
easier to get into the water on 
the beach at Essaouira, as the 
waves are much gentler.

in Nice, since 1988, Damgaard 
devoted his energies to the art 
produced in Essaouira, opening 
his own art gallery in the 
medina until he retired in 
2006. On display is the work  
of artists from the humblest 
walks of life. Among the best 
known are Mohammed Tabal, 
a Gnaoua painter who has 
become known as “the trance 
painter”, Zouzaf, Ali Maïm-
oune, Rachid Amarlouch 
and Fatima Ettalbi.  
Others to be discov-
ered include the 
expressionist Ali, 
whose style is mid-
way between naive 
and Brutalist. All of 
them draw their  
inspiration from 
Essaouira’s cultural  
variety, and reflect the  
traditions of different schools. 
In recent years, many exhibi-
tions and other projects, in 
Morocco and throughout the 
world, have been devoted to 
the painters of Essaouira.

This small ethnographic  
museum is laid out in a  
19th-century house that was  
a former pasha’s resi-
dence and the town 
hall during the  
Protectorate. It  
contains fine displays 
of ancient crafts and of 
weapons and jewellery. 
There are also instruments 
and accessories used by 
religious brotherhoods, 
Moorish musical instru-
ments and some stun-
ning examples of Berber 
and Jewish costumes 
in silk, velvet and  
flannel. Carpets  
illustrating the tradi-
tional weaving of local 
tribes are also exhibited.
Environs
On the Îles Purpuraires, visible 
across the bay from Essaouira, 
is a bird sanctuary where gulls 
and the rare Eleonora’s falcon, 
a threatened species, and 
other birds can be seen.
 Phoenician, Attic and Ionian 
amphorae discovered on the 
Île de Mogador, the main 
island, and now in the  
Musée Archéologique in 
Rabat (see pp78–9), prove that 
trade was taking place here 
from the 7th century BC. In 
the 1st century BC, Juba II 
(see p45), founder of Volu-
bilis, set up a centre for the 
production of purple dye, 
from which the islands take 
their name. Purple dye, highly 
prized by the Romans, was 
obtained from the murex, a 
mollusc. The ruins of a  
prison, built in the 19th  
century by the sultan Moulay 
el-Hassan, are also visible.
 Some 12 km (7.5 miles) 
south of Essaouira, the  
splendid beach at Sidi 
Kaouki is very popular 
with surfers. A mausoleum, 
which appears to rise up out 
of the water, contains the 
tomb of a marabout (holy 
man) who, according to  
legend, had the power to 
cure barren women. An  
annual pilgrimage, with  
many devotees, takes  
place here in mid-August.

Art gallery of Frederic Damgaard, the great discoverer of artistic talent

Essaouira, a town imbued with art and 
culture, is home to a group of  
painters known as “free artists”, 
each of whom has his or her 
own unique style. Their talents 
have won recognition abroad 
and their work has been shown 
in many European art galleries. 
Using bright colours, their naive 
or “tribal” art is inspired by the myths, 
Arab-Berber history and African  
origins of Moroccan popular culture. 
These self-taught painters are also 
woodcarvers, sailors and builders, 
and they have in common an un-
conditional love of their town. 
Arabesques, geometric designs, 
dots, stippling and a swarm of 
objects, animals and human  
figures populate their poetic world.

The Painters of Essaouira
MOHAMMED TABAL
A leading figure in 
Essaouira’s artistic circles, 
Mohammed Tabal draws 
inspiration from his Gnaoui 
ancestry – from the ritual 
of spiritual possession and 
from the trances that form 
part of the rites of this 
popular brotherhood of 
African origin. His paint-
ings are splashed with 
bright, contrasting colours 
and feature a multitude of 
tiny details, such as naive 
motifs rich in symbolism.
Ali Maïmoune paints tree-filled worlds that are 
populated by terrifying monsters, animals and 
fantastic warriors.
Abdallah Elatrach is inspired by scenes of daily 
life in the souks and by the traditions of various 
brotherhoods whose rituals involve trance.
Detail of a 
work by Tabal
Mohammed Tabal’s paintings are imbued with mysticism.

Road map B4. ( Thu in Tamanar, 
Fri in Arba des Ida Outrhouma, 10 km 
(6 km) south of Tamanar.
The small town of Tamanar, 
which extends along its one 
main street, is a regional 
administrative centre and, 
effectively, the capital of the 
argan industry. It is at the heart 
of Haha territory, home to a 
sedentary yet dynamic Berber 
population which was self-
governing in the 15th century.
 On the way out of the  
village, near Café Argane, is a 
store selling locally produced 
argan oil. The highly organi-
zed women who run it show 
the fruits of their labour in a 
friendly atmosphere and sell 
their products in a cooperative.
Environs
Between Smimou (where 
there is a picturesque souk on 
Sundays) and Tamanar, a small 
sign saying “Tafadna” indicates 
the route to Tafelney. Two-
thirds along this road, the 
landscape takes on a majestic 
beauty. The road comes to a 
sudden stop at a magnificent 
bay, where fishermen can 
often be seen mending their 
nets on the beach.
 To the left, a huddle of 
identical shanty houses are 
home to thousands of birds. 
To those with a taste for 
remote spots, the strange 
beauty of this place will  
have a strong appeal.

the Hôtel des Cascades  
(see p307).
This tour follows a very scenic river valley with 
many natural swimming pools surrounded by palm 
trees. From Agadir, a winding road leads to the  
village of Imouzzer, set on a hilltop in the foothills 
of the High Atlas. It is the heart of the territory of 
the Ida Outanane, a confederation 
of Berbers whose traditional 
speciality is gathering 
honey. Despite the 
exodus from the country 
into the towns, many 
women – dressed in 
brightly coloured robes – 
can still be seen at work 
on the hillsides.

THE ARGAN TREE
The argan (Argania sideroxylon) is North Africa’s 
weirdest tree. It is interesting not only in its own 
right, but is also important ecologically and  
economically. This tenacious, twisted tree, which 
never grows higher than 6 m (19.5 ft), has a  
multitude of uses. Being a very hard wood, it is 
ideal for making charcoal. It is also used to feed animals 
(camels and goats find the leaves and fruit delectable), and  
to make argan oil, which is extracted from the kernal. The 
vitamin-rich oil has a wide range of applications, according  
to the degree to which it is 
refined. It is used in cosmetics 
for what are thought to be its 
hydrating and anti-ageing 
properties, and in medicine to 
combat arteriosclerosis, chicken 
pox and rheumatism. Argan oil 
also has culinary uses – a few 
drops are enough to bring out 
the flavour of salads and tajines 
– and is used as fuel for lamps.

you can see curious signs  
saying “Banana Village” and 
“Paradise Valley” – names that 
were originally given by those 
who followed in the footsteps 
of Jimi Hendrix in the 1970s.

The elegant whitewashed façade of Tangier’s Ancien Palais du Mendoub, built in 1929
The history of Tangier has been shaped 
by the sea and by its strategic location on 
the Straits of Gibraltar. The Phoenicians 
established a port here in the 8th cen-
tury, and it was later settled by the 
Carthaginians. In 146 BC, Tangier, 
known as Tingis, became a 
Roman town and the capital of 
Mauretania, to which it gave 
the name Tingitana. In 711, 
Arab and Berber forces 
gathered here to conquer 
Spain. By the 14th centu-
ry, the town was trading 
with Marseilles, Genoa, Venice and 
Barcelona. Tangier was captured by the 
Portuguese in 1471, by the Spanish 
(1578–1640) and then the English, who 
were expelled from the city by Moulay 
Ismaïl in 1684. In the 19th century, 
Morocco was the object of dispute bet-
ween European nations. When, in 1905, 
Kaiser Wilhelm II denounced the 
entente cordiale between France and 
Britain, the stage was 
set for Tangier’s trans-
formation into an 
international city. 
This was sealed by 
the Treaty of Algeciras 
(1906), after which the diplo-
matic corps in Tangier took over 
Morocco’s political, financial and 
fiscal affairs. When colonial rule 
was established in 1912, Spain took 
control of the northern part of the coun-
try. Tangier, however, remained under 
international administration. This was 
the city’s heyday. Its image as a romantic 
and sensuously exotic place was made in 
literature and on the big screen.
After independence in 1956, Tangier 
was returned to Morocco, but suffered 
political ostracism. However, the city 
became industrialized, and new dis-
tricts sprang up. Mohammed VI now 
includes it in his royal visits, and this 
has given a boost to the city.
Locals relaxing in the Café du Grand Socco in the Ville Nouvelle district of Tangier
TANGIER
O 
nce an international city, Tangier has a special character that 
sets it apart from other Moroccan cities. It has drawn artists 
and writers, from Henri Matisse to Paul Bowles and writers of 
the Beat generation. Tangier’s port, dominated by the medina, is the 
main link between Africa and Europe. With a new road linking Tangier 
to Rabat and the construction of a new port, the city continues to expand.

Exploring Tangier
The best overview of the city is from the vantage point of the 
Colline du Charf or Colline de Bella-Vista, to the southeast. 
While the historic heart of Tangier is the medina, the soul  
of the city is the kasbah, which has a palace-museum,  
narrow streets, gateways and a seafront  
promenade. In the evening, when it is  
wise not to linger in the medina, visitors  
who explore Ville Nouvelle (New Town), 
along Avenue Pasteur and Avenue 
Mohammed V, will come across the 
Spanish custom of the paseo (evening 
promenade). Alternatively, the cafés 
on Place de France and Place de Faro 
offer relaxing views of the port and  
the Straits of Gibraltar, and, in clear  
conditions, a sight of the lights  
along the coast of Spain.

Parking is available in Ville Nouvelle, on  
Place du 9 Avril 1947 (Grand Socco) or on the 
Plateau du Marshan. The medina and kasbah 
must be explored on foot. The only practical 
use for cars and taxis is for reaching the  
Colline du Charf and Colline de Bella-Vista, 
the Plateau du Marshan and La Montagne, or 
for a trip along the bay, from the port to the 
edge of the wooded hills before Cap Malabata.

Kasbah 1
From the Marshan, accessible via Bab 
el-Kasbah; from the medina, via Rue 
Ben Raissouli and Bab el-Assa; from 
the Grand Socco, via Rue d’Italie and 
Rue de la Kasbah.
The kasbah was built on the 
site of the Roman settlement. 
Its present appearance dates 
from the Portuguese period 
and that of Moulay Ismaïl (see 
pp54–5). With its quiet streets 
and friendly inhabitants, it has 
a special character, and its 
walls and gates command 
stunning views over the  
strait, the bay and the city.
 Place de la Kasbah was  
once the méchouar where 
the sultan or his pashas held 
public audiences. It is also  
the location of the Dar El-
Makhzen, the former palace 
that is now a museum (see 
below) and of the Kasbah 
Mosque, whose octagonal 
minaret is clad in coloured 
tiles. Its present form dates 
from the 19th century; the 
mendoub led Friday prayers 
here. Also on the square is 
the Dar ech-Chera, the former 
tribunal, fronted by an arcade 
of three white marble  
columns. The large fig tree 
growing against the wall of 
an elegant house is supposed 
to be the place where Samuel 
Pepys wrote about Tangier in 
his diary in the 17th century.
 Bab el-Assa (Gate of Basti-
nado) leads from the square 
to the medina. It was set at an 
angle so as to make it more 
difficult to attack. The gate 
gets its name from the basti-
nado (caning the soles of the 
feet) that was once the  
punishment of criminals. In 
the lobby, between the two 
porches, stands a fountain 
decorated with mosaics,  
stuccowork and woodcarving. 
Gnaouas, distantly related  
to those of Marrakech and 
Essaouira, regularly perform 
music and dance here. In the 
evening, audiences can talk 
with them about their musical 
traditions and their repertoire.

Tangier from the British  
settlers in 1664. The palace

several times in the 17th and

The Grand Mosque, built  
on the site of a Portuguese 
cathedral, probably also over-
lies a former Roman temple 
dedicated to Hercules. Dating 
from the reign of Moulay 
Ismaïl, it was enlarged in  
1815 by Moulay Sliman. 
Mohammed V led Friday 
prayers here on 11 April  
1947, during a visit to Tangier, 
when he also made a historic 
speech in the Mendoubia 
Gardens (see p138). Opposite 
the mosque, the state primary 
school (established by  
nationalists during the  
French Protectorate) is a 
former Merinid medersa  
that was remodelled in  
the 18th century.
 Nearby, the Borj el-Hadjoui 
commands a view of the port 
and a pair of Armstrong  
cannons, each weighing  
20 tonnes. They were  
purchased from the  
British in Gibraltar, 
but were never 
used.
 From the borj, 
Rue Dar el-Baroud 
leads to the Hôtel 
Continental, located 
opposite the port 
and one of  
Tangier’s oldest 
hotels. The build-
ing’s architectural 
style, its Andalusian-style 
lounges and its open terraces 
give this establishment great 
appeal. Its patrons have 
included writers and painters 
– among them Edgar Degas – 
and film producers.

Accessible via Rue Es-Siaghine or

Known today as the Souk 
Dakhli, the Petit Socco  
probably corresponds to the 
area on which the forum of 
Roman Tingis once stood. It 
was a country souk, where 
people would come to buy 
food, and with the  
arrival of the  
Europeans at the 
end of the 19th 
century it became 
the pulsing heart of 
the medina. This 
was where business 
was done; diplo-
mats, businessmen 
and bankers, whose 
offices were located 
around the square 
or in the close vicinity, could 
be seen in the cafés, hotels, 
casinos and cabarets of the 
Petit Socco. The Fuentes, a 
café-restaurant and hotel, now 
gives but a faint impression of 
these halcyon days. From the 
1950s, the hub of city life 
shifted to Ville Nouvelle, leav-
ing the Petit Socco to a few 
writers, and to idlers, smokers 
of kif and shady traffickers.

and stone tools, ceramics,  
terracotta figurines and  
Phoenician silver jewellery.
 The Voyage of Venus, a 
Roman mosaic from Volubilis 
(see pp202–5), is displayed 
in the museum’s courtyard. 
Reproductions of several 
famous bronzes from the 
Musée Archéologique in 
Rabat (see pp78–9) are also 
on display. One room is 
devoted to Morocco’s major 
archaeological sites. On the 
upper floor, the prehistory 
and history of Tangier and its 
environs, from the Neolithic 
period to its occupation by 
foreign powers, are presented 
through displays of grave 
goods, pottery and coins.
 Adjacent to the palace is  
the Andalusian Garden.

This street was once the

marked today by Bab Fahs. 
Lined with cafés and bazaars, 
the street is as lively now as it 
must have been in antiquity.
 The small administrative 
building at No. 47, with a 
courtyard planted with orange 
trees, was from 1860 to 1923 
the residence of the naib, the

The elegant interior courtyard of the American Legation
at No. 51, was built by the 
Spanish government, work 
beginning in 1880. It was 
used by the whole city’s 
Christian community, as well 
as by foreign diplomats. It is 
now used for social activities.
 Further up the street, on  
the left, is Rue Touahine, 
which is lined with jewellers’ 
shops and which leads to  
the Fondation Lorin, an 
arts centre in a disused  
synagogue. On display here 
are newspapers, photographs, 
posters and plans relating to 
the political, sporting, musical 
and social history of Tangier 
since the 1930s. Temporary 
exhibitions of paintings also 
take place here.

The American Legation  
consists of a suite of rooms 
that originally formed part of 
the residence that Moulay  
Sliman presented to the United 
States in 1821, and which 
served as the US Consulate for 
the next 140 years. Another 
suite, on several floors  
looking out onto a garden, 
was presented by a Jewish 
family: the doors, windows 
and ceilings were decorated 
by craftsmen from Fès.
 The rooms contain engra-
vings of Gibraltar and Tangier, 
old maps, and paintings (by 
Brayer, Mohammed ben Ali 
Rbati, James McBey, Claudio 
Bravo and others), which 
were given to the legation  
by Margarite McBey, wife of 
James McBey and a resident 
of Tangier. Through photo-
graphs, early editions and 
recordings, a room devoted  
to Paul Bowles gives an  
overview of the writer’s life 
and work during the years that 
he lived in Tangier. A refer-
ence library is also available 
for the use of scholars and 
specialists on North Africa.

Artists and Writers in Tangier
Paul Morand, a  
diplomat and writer, 
and also a great 
traveller, wrote 
Hécate et ses chiens 
in Tangier in 1955. 
A unique atmos-
phere pervades this 
short novel on the 
subject of couples: 
“In Africa, the first 
thing you learn is to 
live life as it comes.”
At the beginning of the 20th century, 
many writers from Europe and the 
United States came to Tangier, most of 
them settling here more or less per-
manently. Drawn not only by the  
climate, they also came in search of 
stimulation and spiritual wellbeing, 
and in particular sought the  
atmosphere, freedom and sense of 
adventure that the city seemed to 
project. Tangier’s exotic reputation as 
a den of traffickers and spies, and  
of drugs, sex and dissipation was also 
a powerful draw.
PAINTERS
The light, architecture and  
inhabitants of Tangier have inspired 
many European and American 
painters. Discovered by Eugène 
Delacroix at the end of the 19th 
century, the city later became the 
subject of paintings by Georges 
Clairin, Jacques Majorelle, James 
Wilson Morrice, Kees Van Dongen, 
Claudio Bravo and the Expressionist 
painter Henri Matisse.
Mohammed Choukri, born in the Rif in 1935, 
was a friend of Jean Genet and Tennessee  
Williams. Discovered by Paul Bowles, he came  
to fame in the 1980s with For Bread Alone.
Paul Bowles,  
who came  
to Tangier for 
the first time  
in 1931 on  
the advice of 
Gertrude Stein, 
settled there  
permanently in 
1947. He died  
in 1999.
WRITERS
In the wake of Paul Bowles 
came writers and musicians  
of the Beat, Rock and Hippie 
generations. Tennessee Williams 
arrived in 1949, followed by 
Truman Capote, who came  
to Tangier “to escape from 
himself”. William Burroughs 
lived here for longer than all 
other foreign writers, finding 
Tangier a city where “throbbed 
the heartbeat of the world”.
Henri Matisse (1869–1954) was one of the greatest  
Fauvist painters. His Odalisque à la Culotte Grise is 
typical of his work.
Eugène Delacroix  
(1798–1863) discovered 
Morocco in 1832.  
The experience of  
visiting the country 
marked a turning 
point in his career. 
Orientalism was then 
to inspire his work for 
the rest of his life.

Grand Socco 
(Place du

The link between the  
medina and Ville Nouvelle, 
Place du Grand Socco was 
renamed Place du 9 Avril 
1947 in memory of the  
speech that Mohammed V 
made in support of indepen-
dence. The square comes to 
life in the evenings, when  
vendors spread out their wares 
– extensive displays of a huge 
variety of second-hand goods 
– on the ground. A colourful 
market, where peasant women 
in striped foutas and wide-
brimmed straw hats come  
to sell fruit and fowl, takes 
place above the square,  
near the Anglican Church  
of St Andrew, at the far  
end of Rue d’Angleterre.
 The minaret of the Mosque 
of Sidi Bou Abib (1917), 
decorated with polychrome 
tiles, overlooks the square 
from the southwest. Near  
Bab Fahs, a double gateway 
leading into the medina, are 
the grounds of the Mendou-
bia. This was the residence of 
the mendoub when Tangier 
was under international 
administration (1923–56).

The buzzing atmosphere in 
Fondouk Chejra, known as 
the Poor People’s Souk or 
Weavers’ Souk, is that of an 
Oriental bazaar. Above the 
shops on the ground floor, 
the rooms that were once 
used by travellers and passing 
tradesmen have been con-
verted into weavers’ work-
shops, where the white and 
red fabric that is typical of  
the Rif is produced. The  
original layout of the former 
fondouk, or caravanserai, is 
difficult to make out, the  
central courtyard having  
been much altered.
Rue de la Liberté w
This street runs from Place du 
9 Avril 1947 (or Grand Socco) 
to Ville Nouvelle. It was  
formerly known as Rue de 
Fès, then as Rue du Statut,  
its current name dating from 
the beginning of Moroccan 
independence. The French 
Consulate, which is set in  
the centre of a pleasant and 
attractive park, dates from 
1929; the classical arcade of the 
façade is offset by decoration 
in the Moorish style.
 In the Galerie Delacroix, 
housed in the French Cultural 
Institute next door, temporary 
exhibitions are organized by 
the Institut Français. The

British population in Tangier, 
the church of St Andrew  
was completed in 1894.  
The interior is a curious  
mixture of styles, in which the 
Moorish style predominates.
 The lobed arch at the en-
trance to the choir, and the 
ceiling above the altar, which 
is decorated with a quotation 
from the Gospel in Arabic, 
are of particular interest.  
The belltower, in the shape  
of a minaret, overlooks the 
cemetery. Among those  
buried here are Walter Harris, 
a journalist and correspond-
ent for The Times, and Sir 
Harry McLean, a military  
adviser to the sultans.
 A plaque at the west end  
of the church commemorates 
Emily Kean: she came to  
Tangier in the 19th century, 
married the Cherif of  
Ouezzane and devoted her 
life to the welfare of the  
people of northern Morocco.

the avenue, while the villa at 
No. 27 houses the Great 
Synagogue. The Librairie des 
Colonnes, the bookshop at 
No. 54, has lost some of its 
former prestige and import-
ance. All the writers in  
Tangier, whether visitors or 
residents, regularly patronized 
this bookshop, which stocks 
most available books on  
Tangier. Lectures and signing 
sessions are still held here.
 The Gran Teatro Cervantes

remained a hub of city life.
 Very near Place de France,

Portuguese town twinned 
with Tangier in 1984),  
complete with cannons. It is 
one of the few places to have

developers. It offers a view of

1929, was used mostly for  
receptions. It was acquired

Rue Mohammed Tazi (in a narrow 
street opposite the football stadium, 
leading towards the sea).
The café opened in 1921, and 
neither the furniture nor the 
décor seem to have changed 
since then. Assorted tables 
and rush matting are laid out 
on terraces rising in tiers from 
the edge of the cliff, offering 
a breathtaking view of the 
strait. Writers and singers, 
from Paul Bowles to William 
Burroughs and from the 
Beatles to the Rolling Stones, 
have come here,  
seeking out Tangier’s 
young generation or 
the company of local 
fishermen. People 
come here to smoke 
and drink mint tea, 
which is probably 
brewed exactly as  
it was in 1921.
Quartier du 
Marshan u
Rue Mohammed Tazi, Rue Assad Ibn 
Farrat, Avenue Hassan II (western part 
of the kasbah).
Located west of the kasbah, 
the Quartier du Marshan was 
developed from the late 
19th to the early 20th 
century. Being removed 
from the bustle of 
the medina and of 
Ville Nouvelle, it 
was an attractive 
residential location, 
The Bay of Tangier, a grand crescent that is some-
times likened to the Baie des Anges in Nice or to 
Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro, stretches for almost  
4 km (2.5 miles) from the edge of the port round to 
the residential districts and resort areas and to the 
first spurs of land that mark its eastern extremity. 
The proximity of the city and the rivers that flow 
into it unfortunately make this the most polluted 
beach in Morocco. For swimming and sunbathing,  
it is better to make for the beaches between Cap 
Spartel and the Grottes d’Hercule and beyond, or  
for the coves of Cap Malabata, or, further east, the 
beaches at Sidi Khankroucht and Ksar es-Seghir.
Beaches around Tangier
1 Between Cap Spartel 
and the Grottes d’Hercule 
are many attractive little 
bays separated by rocky 
outcrops.
2 Between Tangier and 
Cap Spartel, small coves are 
reachable on foot from the 
Perdicaris Belvedere. The 
walk down passes through 
mimosa and woods of 
umbrella pine.

and high officals and the 
shorfa of Ouezzane built their 
palaces and grand villas here 
in the late 19th century. The 
Italian Consulate (Rue Assad 
Ibn Farrat), rebuilt in 1916 
and with walls covered in  
zellij tilework, housed 
Garibaldi in 1849–50. The 
former palace of the sultan 
Moulay Hafid, in Moorish 
style, became the Palais 
des Institutions

Between the port and Cap 
Malabata, the bay forms a 
beach-lined semicircle.  
Avenue d’Espagne, which 
runs along the bay, is lined 
with hotels, from small guest-
houses to large modern  
establishments. Dotted with

the boats and the ochre, 
green and orange of the nets, 
the small fishing harbour is a 
colourful sight, and the fresh-
ly caught fish that is offered 
makes a delicious meal.
 It was on Avenue d’Espagne 
that Bernardo Bertolucci shot 
scenes for his 1990 film The 
Sheltering Sky. Many literary 
works, by William Burroughs 
and others, took shape in the 
small guesthouses here. The 
French philosopher Michel 
Foucault would stay at the 
Hôtel Cecil, while Samuel 
Beckett preferred the Solazur.
8 At Ksar es-Seghir, 
33 km (20 miles) along 
a road with beautiful 
scenery, a splendid 
beach stretches out in 
front of woods and 
groves from which 
emerge the ruins of 
Almohad, Merinid and 
Portuguese buildings.
4 The beach at Mrissa, 
beneath Cap Malabata, 
has fine, soft sand and  
is well sheltered by stands 
of pine.
5 Plage des Amiraux has 
developed in front of the  
elegant houses of a small, 
newly created village.
6 The double beach at Sidi 
Khankroucht, at Km 18, beneath 
shaded hills, is clean and  
pleasant. Chez Hassan is a  
small, friendly restaurant here.
7 Wadi Aliane is an attractive 
sandy beach with a small resort 
complex that is still in the process 
of being built.

them, at the foot of the hill, 
can be seen Plaza Toro, 
whose bullrings are now used 
for public functions. Further 
north is the Syrian Mosque, 
with a style of minaret rarely 
seen in the Maghreb.
 The mosque-like building 
on the hill was a café during 
Tangier’s international period. 
A favourite form of relaxation 
for the inhabitants of Tangier 
is to stroll on the hill or sit 
and gaze out over the strait.

In the southeast of the city.
A hill rising to a height of 
about 100 m (328 ft), the

 The panorama stretches from 
Cap Malabata in the east to La 
Montagne, which rises over 
the old town to the west. From 
here the beach appears as a 
strip lining the bay, and the 
white, densely packed medina 
seems to cling to the hillside 
as it slopes down towards the 
port, while the high-rise 
blocks of Ville Nouvelle stand 
along its wide avenues. Poor-

A brightly painted wooden door in Chefchaouen
Inaccessible and intricately partitioned, 
the Rif reaches a height of 2,452 m 
(8,047 ft) at Jbel Tidirhin, in the central 
part of the mountain range, then tails 
away eastwards towards the Moulouya 
estuary and the Algerian border. The 
northwestern Rif is a region of 
low mountains and hills dotted 
with villages, while the central 
part consists of lofty sum-
mits and enclosed valleys. 
To the east, what is 
regarded as the real Rif 
gently slopes away.
All Riffians fiercely defend their cul-
tural identity. The Spanish, to whom 
the region fell when Morocco was divi-
ded under the French Protectorate, 
came face to face with this intransi-
gence during the uprisings of 1921–6 
and were soundly defeated at Anoual 
in 1921 (see p56). The 
history of the Rif and 
its coastline is closely 
linked to that of 
Spain. For Morocco, 
the Mediterranean became 
a bridgehead for the conquest 
of Spain. From the 15th century, 
the Portuguese occupation, follo-
wed by that of the Spanish, cut 
Morocco off from the Mediterranean 
and accelerated its decline. Spain still 
maintains a foothold in Ceuta and 
Melilla, and on a few rocky islets. 
Morocco has worked for closer co- 
operation with Spain and Europe to 
tackle problems of illegal trafficking 
and emigration here. The new port of 
Tanger Méditerranée, opened in 2007, 
and the new airport, are dramatically 
changing Tangier and Ceuta.

T
he great mountainous crescent of the Rif forms a natural bar-
rier across northern Morocco. Its proud Berber-speaking 
inhabitants haughtily guard their traditions and indepen-
dence, and historically the Rif has always resisted conquest. The Rif, 
today, is friendly and welcoming, with sandy Mediterranean coves 
and beaches, many of them with a backdrop of majestic cliffs.

Exploring the Mediterranean 
Coast & the Rif
 Stretching from the land of the Jebala in the west to Morocco’s eastern 
frontier, the Rif presents a great variety of landscapes. Here are high, steep 
valleys where almond trees blossom and oleanders flower, mountain roads 
that command wild and magnificent vistas, forests of cedar, fir and oak, and 
villages and isolated houses with pitched tin roofs. Between Ceuta and Cabo 
Negro, the coast is punctuated by 
sweeping beaches of golden 
sand and, from Wadi Laou 
to Al-Hoceima and Saïdia, by 
more secluded bays beneath 
rocky cliffs. The medinas of 
Tetouan and Chefchaouen 
are among the most 
picturesque in Morocco.

 GETTING AROUND 
 Air links to the region arrive in Tangier, 
Al-Hoceima, Melilla and Oujda. Once there, it 
is better to hire a car rather than use  grands 
taxis . Having your own means of transport 
gives you the freedom to stop off at 
secluded beaches and seek out the high 
valleys. In this mountainous environment, 
the roads are sometimes in a bad 
state of repair, and there are 
often roadworks, particularly 
along the arterial routes.

Cap Spartel 1
Road map D1. 14 km (9 miles) west 
of Tangier.
From Tangier, the road  
leading to Cap Spartel runs 
through La Montagne, the 
city’s western suburb, which 
is bathed in the perfume of 
eucalyptus and mimosa. Long 
walls surround the residences 
of Moroccan, Kuwaiti and 
Saudi kings and princes and 
the luxury villas dating from 
the golden age of Tangier’s 
international period. Beyond 
stretch forests of holm-oak, 
cork oak, umbrella pine,  
mastic-tree, broom and  
heather, which all flourish 
here, watered by the highest 
rainfall in Morocco.
 At the cape, the most  
northwesterly point of Africa, 
is the promontory known in 
antiquity as Cape Ampelusium 
or Cape of the Vines, and a 
lighthouse dating from 1865. 
From beneath the lighthouse, 
there is a breathtaking view 
of the ocean where the  
Mediterranean and Atlantic 
meet, and on clear days you 
can see the strait and coast of 
Spain from Cape Trafalgar to 
the Rock of Gibraltar.
these caves knapped stones 
here and quarried millstones 
for use in oil presses. The 
opening to the caves, facing 
onto the sea, is a cleft shaped 
like a reversed map of Africa.
 According to legend, Hercules 
slept here before performing 
one of his 12 labours – pick-
ing the golden apples in the 
Garden of the Hesperides. 
The location of the legendary 
garden belonging to these 
nymphs of darkness and 
guarded by the dragon  
with 100 heads is said to  
be further south, near Lixus.
 The best time to visit the 
caves is in the late afternoon, 
after which the light of the 
setting sun can be enjoyed 
from the cafés nearby.  
Further south, beneath the 
level of the caves, are the 
Ruins of Cotta (1st century 
BC to 3rd century AD). With 
vats for salting fish, making 
garum and producing purple 
dye, this was one of the  
largest industrial centres of 
the Punic-Mauretanian period.
Cap Malabata 3
Road map D1. 12 km (7.5 miles) 
east of Tangier.
The route out of Tangier 
skirts an area of large  
tourist hotels and continues 
eastwards round the curve  
of the bay. Soon after a tiny 
estuary, at the edge of the 
road, are the remains of a 
16th-century fortress, from 
which Moroccan soldiers 
could watch and attack the 
Portuguese, Spanish and  
English occupiers of Tangier. 
Nearby, white crenellated 
walls surround the lush and 
extensive grounds of the  
Villa Harris. It was once the 
residence of Walter Harris 
(1866–1953), a flamboyant 
journalist and diplomatic  
correspondent for The Times. 
He chronicled life in Tangier 
for many years from 1892.
 The road ascending the hills 
passes through magnificent 
pine forests and by many 
small coves where there are 
cafés which, like Café Ryad, 
have an old-world charm.  
Just before the cape, a  
strange building appears. 
Conceived in the medieval 
style, it was the work of a 
whimsical Italian, who left  
it unfinished in the 1930s.
 The view from Cap Malabata 
is stunning, especially in the 
morning, looking westwards 
over the city and suburbs of 
Tangier and across to the 
Straits of Gibraltar, and  
eastwards to Jbel Moussa, 
which rises over Ceuta.

Ksar es-Seghir 4
Road map D1. 33 km (20 miles) east 
of Tangier. * 8,800. ( Sat.
A town with a small fishing 
harbour and a fine beach, 
Ksar es-Seghir faces the  
Spanish town of Tarifa across 
the Straits of Gibraltar. The 
souk that takes place here on 
Saturdays is filled with women 
of the Rif, conspicuous in 
their white, red-striped foutas.
 Since the 17th century,  
forts have stood on this well-
sheltered spot on an estuary, 
and it was from here that 
Moroccan troops set sail for 
Spain. The Almohads made it 
an important centre of ship-
building and skilled crafts. 
The remains of buildings in  
a small forest are those of a 
town built by the Merinids in 
the 14th century. The circular 
walls that surround it are  
unusual, but were obviously 
preferred to the customary 
square plan by the town’s 
Muslim builders; the gateway 
facing the sea is the best- 
preserved. The Portuguese, 
who held the town from  
1458 to 1549, strengthened  
it with new fortifications  
that reached to the sea.

Standing on a narrow isthmus 
between Monte Hacho and 
the mainland, Ceuta occupies 
a favourable location  
opposite Gibraltar. The  
Rock of Gibraltar and  
Monte Hacho are the two  
legendary Pillars of Hercules.
 From the 12th century 
onwards, the town was  
visited by traders from Genoa, 
Pisa, Marseilles and Catalonia. 
In 1415, Ceuta became a  
Portuguese enclave, then 
passed to Spain in 1578. 
Today, it is an important  
garrison town. Its livelihood 
depends mainly on the tax-
free trade that its status as a 
free port allows. Ceuta (like 
Melilla) is a self-governing 
town within the Spanish state. 
Morocco views the Spanish 
presence as anachronistic and 
claims sovereignty.
 The 12-km  
(7.5-mile) circuit of 
Monte Hacho (part 
of it accessible by 
road) affords views 
over the town, the 
mountains and 
coast of the Rif and 
Gibraltar, especially 
from the lighthouse 
at Punto Almina. 
The Castillo del 
Desnarigado, a 
fortress that is now a military 
museum, encloses the Ermita 
de San Antonio. This chapel 
draws a large pilgrimage on 
13 June each year.
 The Plaza de Africa is, in 
architectural terms, the centre 
of the town, where the main 
public buildings are concen-
trated. The cathedral, whose 
present appearance dates 
from the 18th century, stands 
on the site of a Grand Mosque. 
Religious paintings and objects 
are displayed in its museum.
 Nuestra Señora de Africa 
(the Church of Our Lady of 
Africa) was built in the early 
18th century, also on the site 
of a mosque, in an arresting 
Baroque style. On the high 
altar stands a statue of the  
Virgin, patroness of Ceuta, 
who is believed to have saved 
the town from an epidemic of 
plague in the 16th century. 
The cathedral treasury  
contains some fine paintings, 
banners and 17th-century  
illuminated books.
 The Ayuntamiento (town 
hall), built in 1929, is of inter-
est to visitors for the paintings 
that it contains by Mariano 
Bertuchi, an artist active  
during the colonial period.
 The Museo Municipal 
(Archaeological Museum) is 
laid out above underground 
passages dug in the 16th and 
17th centuries to supply the 
town with water. The displays 
include Neolithic, Carthagin-
ian and Roman pottery, 
including amphorae, as  
well as coins and armour.
 Through maps, photographs 
and visual displays, the Museo 
de la legión documents the 
activities of the Spanish  
Foreign Legion and its efforts 
in 1921–6 to subdue the Rif 
uprising and the rebel leader 
Abdel Krim. The legion, 
formed in 1920, suffered  
serious losses during this war.

In the words of Arab poets, Tetouan is a white dove, 
“the sister of Fès”, “the little Jerusalem” or “the daughter 
of Granada”. The town, built partly on the slopes of 
Jbel Dersa, was inhabited by Jewish refugees from  
Granada in the 15th century, then by Moors from Anda-
lusia in the 17th century. The town’s Andalusian heritage 
can be seen in its medina, and also in its culinary traditions, 
as well as in its music and in the craft of embroidery. 
From the 15th to the 18th centuries, Tetouan was a lively 
centre of privateering, then of thriving trade with Europe, 
becoming a sort of city-state comparable to Florence or 
to Venice at the time of the doges. In the 18th century, 
the town was the diplomatic capital of Morocco. The 
Spanish, who held it from 1860 to 1862, made it their 
capital during the Protectorate, building a new town  
on the west side of the old Andalusian medina.
P Ville Nouvelle
Place Moulay el-Mehdi and 
Boulevard Mohammed V.
It is on Place Moulay el-
Mehdi – which is sometimes 
still referred to by the town’s 
inhabitants as Place Primo 
(after the Spanish politician 
José Primo de Rivera) – that 
the Spanish colonial archi-
tecture of Ville Nouvelle  
(New Town) is at its most  
eloquent. With a main post 
office, bank and church 
(1926), the square looks like 
any other central town square 
in Spain. Elegant homes with 
doors, windows and balconies 
with Moorish-style ornamen-
tation can be seen on  
Boulevard Mohammed V, the 
town’s principal thoroughfare.
 Place Hassan II links Ville 
Nouvelle and the medina. 
Modern tiling has replaced 
the old mosaic decoration of 
the royal palace that stands 
on the side of the square 
nearest the medina. Both the 
boulevard and the square 
come to life in the evenings 
with the paseo (promenade), 
a Spanish custom that is more 
deeply ingrained in Tetouan 
than elsewhere.
E Musée Archéologique
Boulevard El-Jazaïr, near Place El-Jala. 
# Mon–Fri pm only. &
The rooms of the  
Archaeological  
Museum contain  
objects dating from 
the Roman period that 
were discovered at 
Volubilis, Lixus and 
Thamuda, a Roman 
site on the outskirts of 
present-day Tetouan 
(on the road to  
Chef chaouen).  
Mosaics, including a  
depiction of the Three Graces 
of classical mythology, as  
well as pottery, coins, bronzes 
and other pieces, are dis-
played. The most interesting 
exhibits – such as ancient  
inscriptions, mosaic floors and 
Muslim funerary stelae with 
the Star of David – are laid 
out in the garden.
P Medina
Entry through Place Hassan II, then via 
Rue Ahmed Torres to the southeast.
Tetouan’s medina, now a 
World Heritage Site, is the 
most strongly Andalusian of all 
Moroccan medinas. Emigrants 
from Spain who arrived in the 
15th and 17th centuries 
implanted their architectural 
traditions here, including a 
taste for wrought-iron decor-
ation and a liking for doors 
with elaborate metal fittings.
 The aroma of spices, freshly 
sawn wood and kesra (bread) 
fills the medina’s narrow 
streets, squares and souks, 
which bustle with carpenters, 
slipper-makers, drapers, tan-
ners and sellers of second-
hand goods. Rue El-Mokadem 
(between Place Souk el-Fouqui 
and Place Gharsa el-Kebira) is 
the street most densely packed 
with shops, but also one of

the most noteworthy for its 
impressive white buildings and 
its paving. Sellers of fabrics 
and pottery fill the small shady 
square where the El-Houts 
Souk takes place. It leads to

Jewish quarter, where the  
balconied houses have large 
windows, wrought-iron gates 
and arcaded façades.

# 9am–noon & 2–6pm Wed–Mon.
Occupying a bastion built in 
1828, the museum is laid out 
in an Andalusian palace with 
a garden, a fountain clad in 
zellij tilework, and red-tiled 
awnings, typical of buildings 
in Tetouan. The furniture, the 
craftsman-made pieces, the 
costumes and musical instru-
ments illustrate the town’s  
traditions. Tetouani rooms, 
with marriage scenes (such as 
putting together the trousseau 
and presenting the bride), 
have also been convincingly 
re-created.
 The Craft School, near the 
museum, opposite Bab Oqla, 
occupies a residence built  
in 1928 in Moorish style.  
Specializing in local traditions, 
the school teaches leather-
work, pottery, mosaic- 
making, carpet-weaving and 
decorative plasterwork. The 
students’ work is displayed  
in a domed exhibition hall.
TETOUAN’S JEWS
A large Jewish community, expelled from Spain 
at the end of the Christian Reconquest, settled in 
Tetouan, thrived here and reached its height in 
the 16th century. Like the many Muslims who 
had also arrived from Spain, these Jews  
cherished the memory of Andalusia as a lost  
paradise. On feast days, they would listen to 
Andalusian music and don Andalusian costume 
and jewellery.
 Exploiting their contacts in Gibraltar, Antwerp, 
Amsterdam and London, Tetouan’s Jews played a 
central role in the economic life of the town and 
through them it became an important trade link 
with the West. At the beginning of the 19th  
century, subjected to violence and heavily taxed, 
the Jews repaired to a quarter of their own, the 
judería. Marginalized in professional and social 
life, many Jews left to settle in Melilla, Gibraltar 
or Iran, and also in Latin America. Despite an 
improvement in their situation under Spanish 
rule, the Jewish community – which still counted 
some 3,000 people in 1960 – continued to shrink 
progressively after independence, many leaving 
for Israel. By the early 1990s, there were no  
more than 200 Jews remaining in Tetouan.

The white town of Chefchaouen nestles in the hollow 
of the two mountains – ech-Chaoua (The Horns) – 
from which it takes its name. Steep narrow streets  
with white and indigo limewashed buildings, small 
squares, ornate fountains and houses with elaborately 
decorated doorways and red tile roofs make this a 
delightful town. It was founded in 1471 by Idrissid 
shorfa, descendants of the Prophet Mohammed, as  
a stronghold in the fight against the Portuguese. 
Chefchaouen, esteemed as a holy town, has eight 
mosques and several zaouias and marabouts.
P Place Uta el-Hammam
The square is the heart of the 
old town and the focal point 
on which all the streets of the 
medina converge. It is lined 
with trees, and paved with 
stones and pebbles, and in 
the centre stands a four-sided 
fountain decorated with arches 
and crowned by a pavilion of 
green tiles. With shops and 
cafés, this is an ideal place  
for a relaxed stroll.
U Grand Mosque
Place Uta el-Hammam.  
¢ to non-Muslims.
The Grand Mosque was 
founded probably in the 16th 
century and has been re- 
modelled several times since. 
The later minaret, which dates 
from the 17th century, is  
distinctive in being octagonal. 
It is decorated with three tiers 
of plain and lobed arches on 
a painted ochre background. 
The uppermost tier is  
decorated with zellij tilework.
P Fondouk
Corner of Place Uta el-Hammam and 
Rue Al-Andalus.
The fondouk still serves the 
purpose for which it was 
originally built. About 50 
rooms, arranged around the 
courtyard, still accommodate 
travellers and passing traders.
 It is a building of strikingly 
simple design, with a gallery 
of semicircular arches lining 
the pebble-paved 
courtyard. The  
only contrast to  
this simplicity is 
provided by the 
main entrance;  
the doorway is  
surmounted by  
an awning and 
framed by a broken 
horseshoe arch  
surrounded by 
interlacing arches.
P Kasbah and Museum
West corner of Place Uta el-Hammam. 
# Wed–Mon. ¢ Tue & Fri pm. &
The kasbah, with crenellated 
walls of red beaten earth and 
ten bastions, is the essential 
heart of the town. The  
fortress was begun in the 15th 
century by Moulay Ali ben 
Rachid, and was completed 
by Moulay Ismaïl in the 17th 
century, as was the residence 
within. The kasbah’s plan and 
architectural style show Anda-
lusian influence. A pleasant 
garden with fountains is laid 
out within, from where there 
is a good view of the walls 
and the rampart walk. The 
Musée Ethnographique  
(Ethnographic Museum)  
occupies the residence  
built in the garden. This  
is a traditional Moroccan 
house with a courtyard and 
gallery on the first floor. The 
museum contains displays of 
pottery, armour, embroidery, 
costume, musical instruments, 
palanquins and painted 
wooden chests.
P Medina
A small street running 
between the kasbah and  
the Grand Mosque leads  
to the Souïka district. This  
is the oldest district of 
Chefchaouen, and the  
town’s finest houses, with 
carved and decorated doors, 
are found here. The name 
souïka, meaning “little  
market”, comes from the  
district’s kissaria, where  
there are many small shops 
along its narrow streets.
 The medina contains more 
than 100 weavers’ workshops.

This district is 
reached from 
the northwestern 
corner of Place 
Uta el-Hammam, 
leaving the  
fondouk on the 
left. The Quartier 
Al-Andalus 
received the 
second wave  
of immigrants – 
Muslims and 
Jews expelled from Spain – 
who arrived in 1492, after  
the fall of Granada.
 Here, the houses, painted 
white, green or blue, have 
decorated doors and  
wrought-iron railings at some 
of their windows. They follow 
the steep gradient of the  
terrain, which makes for 
many exterior stairways and 
entrances at various levels.

as well as for the red and 
white striped fabrics worn  
by the women of the Jebala,  
a tribe of the mountainous 
western Rif. One such  
weaver’s workshop is located 
in Rue Ben Dibane, identifi-
able by an exterior stairway.
 One of the most distinctive

 Beyond is the spring of Ras 
el-Ma, which is now enclosed 
by a building. The presence 
of this underground spring 
was the reason why the town 
was established here. It 
accounts for the town’s lush 
gardens, and the water also 
powers the mills. Steps  
leading towards the metalled 
road run alongside the wash-
houses, then the mills, whose 
origins go back to the arrival 
of the Andalusian refugees.
 The route then leads to  
the bridge across Wadi Laou, 
which is built in the form  
of a semicircular arch with 
bevelled buttresses. With  
its cascades, wash-houses  
and cafés, this is one of  
the most pleasant quarters  
of Chefchaouen.

A large market town,  
Ouezzane spreads out over 
the slopes of Jbel Bou Hillal, 
in a landscape of extensive 
olive groves and plantations 
of fig trees fed by abundant 
springs. It is important for its 
textiles (jellabas and carpets) 
and olive oil.
 In the 15th century, the 
town, which was populated 
by Andalusians, also counted 
many Jews among its inhabi-
tants. It began to prosper in 
the 18th and 19th centuries 
under the influence of the 
Idrissid shorfa. In 1727, a 
descendant of Idriss II esta-
blished the religious brother-
hood of the Taïbia, whose 
influence spread throughout 
Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. 
In the 19th century, the shorfa 
played a prominent religious 
and political role in Morocco. 
The sherif of Ouezzane’s poli-
cy of openness also assisted 
trade relations with France. 
The Zaouia (or Green 
Mosque) and, with its zellij-
covered minaret, the Mosque 
of Moulay Abdallah Cherif,

This ancient fishing and  
trading port, seat of the  
emirate of Nokour during the 
Middle Ages, was long the 
object of dispute between 
European traders. The modern 
town was founded by General 
Sanjurjo in 1926, at the  
place where the 
Spanish  
garrison 
landed, 
and was 
known 
initially as 
Villa Sanjurjo.
 The town’s 
location is one of the most 
beautiful along Morocco’s 
Mediterranean coast.  
Whitewashed houses line

the first few hours in the day, 
only women may go there.

Bou Ayach, large market 
towns on the road out of  
Al-Hoceima, have a slightly 
unreal appearance, created  
by residential blocks painted

pinks. The towns come to  
life for only a few weeks  
of the year, when emigrant 
workers based in Germany 
and Holland return.

The Rif 9
This region is well known for its atmospheric 
and beautiful medinas but, covering an area of 
some 30,000 sq km (11,580 sq miles), it offers 
much else besides. Among its natural wonders 
are high mountains, capes, gorges and rock  
formations. The country souks held weekly in 
Riffian towns and villages provide the opportu-
nity to come into contact with local people as 
they go about their daily business. In July, the 
moussem of Jbel Alam, one of Morocco’s best-
known pilgrimages, takes place: the object is the 
tomb of Moulay Abdesselam ben Mchich, a 
highly venerated Sufi mystic who died in 
1228. In the environs of Chefchaouen, 
ramblers and those with four-wheel-
drive vehicles can visit one of the 
rare collective granaries of the 
western Rif at Akrar d’El-Kelaa, and 
the nature reserve at Talassemtane, 
where the fir forests are protected.

Sovereign Spanish town.  
Road map E1. 167 km (104 miles) 
east of El-Hoceima and 153 km  
(95 miles) northwest of Oujda.  
* 70,000. @ n Tourist and 
information office near Plaza de Toros;

Festival of Spain (early Jul); Our Lady 
of Victory (early Sep).
Although about 40 per cent  
of the population of the  
Spanish town of Melilla is 
Moroccan, the way of life 
here is still very Andalusian.
 It was once a Carthaginian, 
then a Roman, trading post. 
Located on the road from Fès 
and being the destination of 
caravans from Sijilmassa and 
the Sahara, Melilla became a 
busy port during the Middle 
Ages. The town has been in 
Spanish hands since 1497.
 Under the Protectorate, 
Melilla underwent rapid 
development thanks to its  
status as a free zone. However, 
Moroccan independence and 
the closure of the border with 
Algeria cut it off from the  
hinterland. The town is now 
experiencing a difficult  
period. Consumer demand in 
this Spanish town means that 
tax-free goods find a ready 
market. This has contributed 
to a thriving illegal trade, 
which in turn creates the 
appearance of prosperity.
 Set on a rocky peninsula 
and enclosed within 16th- 
and 17th-century walls, the 
fortress-like Medina Sidonia 
district constitutes the upper 
town. The Puerta de la  
Marina leads through to a 
tracery of alleys, vaulted  
passages, steps and several 
small squares, some with a 
chapel or church. The Puerta 
de Santiago leads through to 
Plaza de Armas, west of the 
old town.

Concepción, in the northwest

the backs of women and  
children. The goods are then 
disposed of in broad daylight 
in two huge markets in Nador.

Nador, is the foremost fishing 
port on the Mediterranean 
coast, and it also has modern 
naval dockyards.
of the old town, contains 
some fine Baroque altarpieces; 
on the high altar stands an 
18th-century statue of Our 
Lady of Victory, patron saint 
of Melilla. Passing behind the 
church and following the 
ramparts, you will come to 
the Musée Municipal (Town 
Museum). Here, Melilla’s 
Phoenician, Carthaginian and 
Roman periods are represented 
by ceramics, coins and brace-
lets that were discovered in 
the vicinity of the town.

With wide avenues, shops, a 
multitude of cafés, restaurants 
and hotels, banks and  
residential blocks, Nador, 
somewhat unexpectedly,  
has all the trappings of a 
major town. It is, indeed, 
enjoying great prosperity.
 Nador’s dramatic economic 
growth has been fuelled both 
by its traditional industries, 
such as metallurgy (its metal-
processing complex is  
supplied with iron ore from 
the Rif and anthracite from 
Jerada) and by new ones, 
namely textiles, chemicals  
and electrics. The waves of 
emigration that have affected 
the whole of the eastern Rif 
have also contributed  
significantly to Nador’s  
development. While  
immigrants here are key 
investors and consumers, 
funds sent home by workers 
from abroad have swelled the 
town’s economy.
 Nador’s location, 13 km  
(8 miles) from the Spanish 
enclave of Melilla, also 
accounts for the town’s  
prosperity, through illegal 
trafficking. Through well- 
oiled channels, goods cross 
the border at many points, 
including Beni Enzar, the  
border post nearest Melilla. 
Here, small consignments are 
transported across the border 
several times a day, packed in

The whole area between the 
Bou Areg lagoon and the 
estuary of Wadi Moulouya is  
a rich and fascinating nature 
reserve. A great variety of 
birds – dunlin, plover,  
oystercatcher, little egret,  
redshank, black-tailed godwit 
and flamingoes, terns, and 
different species of gulls – 
come to spend the winter in 
this marshy area. The dunes 
are home to woodcock,  
plovers, herons and storks.
 The vegetation in this area 
is equally diverse: spurge and 
sea holly grow on the dunes, 
while glasswort, reeds and 
rushes cover the marshes, 
which are the habitat of  
dragonflies, grasshoppers  
and sand spiders.

KIF
Until relatively recent times, the cultivation of kif  
(cannabis) was the preserve of a few tribes around 
Ketama. Kif plantations have multiplied and are now 
found in several provinces between Chefchaouen and 
Al-Hoceima. Once grown only in the high valleys of 
the central Rif, the plant is today also cultivated on the 
slopes of low-lying valleys. Growing Cannabis sativa, 
“the curative herb”, as well as Indian hemp, is highly 
lucrative and underpins the entire economy of the Rif. 
Although growing and smoking it (which are traditional in the region) are tolerated on a 
localized basis, its commercial exploitation is illegal. This has given rise to a major smuggling 
trade, which the Moroccan authorities are fighting with financial assistance from the Euro-
pean Union. The proposed solution is to introduce alternative crops and to open up the Rif 
by building a coastal road from Tangier to Saïdia, passing through Ceuta and Al-Hoceima.

At the northern extremity  
of the fertile Triffa plain, an 
agricultural and wine-growing 
area, is the little town of  
Saïdia, located on the Wadi 
Kiss estuary. For the last  
20 km (12 miles) before it 
reaches the sea, this river 
constitutes the border bet-
ween Morocco and Algeria.
 Saïdia is a coastal resort  
with a fine beach edged with 
mimosa and eucalyptus, the 
reason behind the town’s 
name “Blue Pearl”. In summer 
the beach is crowded with 
Moroccan tourists. A folk arts 
festival is held at the Palais  
du Festival on Boulevard 
Mohammed V in August.
 Saïda is also home to a 
modern resort that overlooks 
a marina and accommodates 
more than 1,000 guests.

to explore, being small 
enough to wander about in 
without becoming disoriented. 
Rue el-Mazouzi, a major axis, 
crosses the medina from west

P6012 from Berkane to Taforalt. It follows the course 
of Wadi Zegzel as the river winds through deep  
gorges and along valleys and hillsides. Many of the 
caves that have been hollowed out of the cliffs by the 
action of water, such as the Grotte du Chameau and 
Grotte de Tghasrout, contain impressive stalactites  
and stalagmites. Continuing along this road offers 
breathtaking views of the mountains and the Angad 
plain, and of almond groves, villages and isolated 
marabouts. Road P6017 then road N2 lead back to

(2,955 ft), Figuig  
consists of seven  
villages, or ksour, 
spread out in a vast 
palm plantation that 
covers almost 20 sq km

left bank, which was known as El-Alya 
(High Town). In 818, these two cities, 
each within their own walls, received 
hundreds of Muslim families who 
had been expelled from  
Córdoba. Soon afterwards, 
some 300 refugee families 
from Kairouan, in Tunisia, 
found asylum in El-Alya, 
which then became 
known as Karaouiyine, 
after them. Within a few years, thanks to 
these two communities, the two towns 
became the centre of the Arabization and 
Islamization of Morocco.
In the mid-11th century, the Almoravids 
united the two towns, building a wall 
around them. The Almohads took the 
city in 1145, after a long siege. Fès  
then became the country’s foremost 
cultu ral and economic metropolis, 
thanks in large part to 
the founding of its 
university. In 1250, 
the Merinids raised 
Fès to the status of 
imperial capital and en- 
dowed it with prestigious 
buildings. To the west of the old 
town they established a new royal 
city, Fès el-Jedid (New Fès).  
Conquered by the Alaouites in 1666, 
Fès was spur ned by Moulay Ismaïl, 
who chose Meknès as his capital. The 
city’s decline continued until the early 
20th century.
When the Protectorate was establish-
ed in 1912, a Ville Nouvelle (New 
Town) was built. After independence 
this was filled by the prosperous citizens 
of the old medina, while the country 
people, rootless and poor, crowded 
into the old town. However, UNESCO’s 
ongoing restoration programme has 
saved the historic city of Fès el-Bali.
FÈS
The rooftops of the Karaouiyine Quarter, Fès el-Bali
L
ocated between the fertile lands of the Saïs and the forests of the 
Middle Atlas, Fès is the oldest of Morocco’s imperial cities. It is the 
embodiment of the country’s history and its spiritual and religious 
capital, and has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. 
Morocco’s third-largest city, it consists of Fès el-Bali, the historic centre; 
Fès el-Jedid, the imperial city of the Merinids; and, located further south, 
the modern districts created under the Protectorate.

Exploring Fès
Seen from the summit of the hill of the Merinid 
tombs, Fès appears as a compact and tightly woven 
urban fabric. Enclosed within its defensive walls,  
Fès el-Bali, the historic medina, is a sea of rooftops 
from which emerge minarets and domes. Wadi Fès 
separates the two historic entities: the Andalusian 
Quarter to the east, and the Karaouiyine Quarter  
to the west. Fès el-Jedid (see pp180–83) is built on  
a height south of the medina. Notable features here 
include the royal palace and the former Jewish  
quarter. The Ville Nouvelle (New Town), dating  
from the Protectorate, lies further south.

GETTING AROUND
Both Fès el-Bali and Fès el-Jedid can be explored only  
on foot since the labyrinthine layout of these quarters is 
unsuitable for motorized traffic. Parking is available near 
Bab Boujeloud or Bab el-Ftouh, or on Place des Alaouites. 
Buses (often very crowded) run between Ville Nouvelle 
and both Fès el-Bali and Fès el-Jedid. It is best to take  
a petit taxi (see p374). Petits taxis can be found near  
the post office, at Bab Boujeloud and in the vicinity  
of the large hotels.

Merinid Tombs 1
North of the medina, on the hill of 
the Merinid tombs.
Standing among olive trees, 
cacti and blue agaves, the 
16th-century ruins that  
overlook Fès el-Bali are those 
of a Merinid palace and necro-
polis. Ancient chroniclers  
recorded that these tombs 
elicited wonderment because 
of their magnificent marble 
and the splendour of their 
coloured epitaphs. Today, the 
tombs are very dilapidated, 
and the area is popular with 
petty thieves, but it offers an 
impressive view of 
the city. The view 
from the terrace  
of the Hôtel Les 
Mérinides (see p310) 
is equally fine.
 The stretch of wall 
immediately beneath 
the hill is the oldest part of 
the medina’s defences. Parts 
of the curtain wall date from 
the Almohad period (12th 
century), notably Borj 
Kaoukeb, near which the  
lepers’ quarter was once 
located. The tombs overlook 
a tiered cemetery which 
stretches as far as Bab Guissa, 
an Almohad gateway dating 
from the 13th century.
Musée des Armes 2
Borj Nord. Tel (0535) 64 75 66. 
# Tue–Sun. &
Borj Nord was built in 1582, 
on the orders of the Saadian 
sultan Ahmed el-Mansour 
(1578–1603). From its vantage 
point over the city, the  
fortress both defended and 
controlled Fès el-Bali. In 1963 
the collection of weapons 
from the Musée Dar el-Batha 
(see pp168–9) was transferred 
here to create the Museum  
of Arms. Much of the collec-
tion, comprising more than 
8,000 pieces, comes from the  
Makina, the arsenal built by 
Moulay Hassan I at the end 
of the 19th century, 
although it was 
enriched by  
donations from  
various Alaouite 
sultans.
 Some 1,000 pieces of weap-
onry are exhibited in 16 
rooms, in a chronological  
display running from pre-
history to the first half of the 
20th century. Moroccan weap-
ons are well represented and 
demonstrate the technical 
knowledge of Moroccan 
craftsmen. There is also an 
interesting collection of weap-
ons from all over the world.
Bab Boujeloud 3
Place du Pacha el-Baghdadi.
Enclosed within high walls, 
the large Place Pacha el-
Baghdadi links the medina 
and Fès el-Jedid. On one  
side of the square stands  
Bab Boujeloud. Built in 1913, 
this fine monumental gate is 
the principal entrance into 
Fès el-Bali.
 With the development of 
heavy artillery, the fortified 
gates of Fès lost their  
effectiveness as defences and 
came to be seen as decorative 
buildings, contributing to the 
city’s prestige and helping to 
justify the levy of city taxes.
 Bab Boujeloud, built in the 
Moorish style, consists of 
three perfectly symmetrical 
horseshoe arches. A rich  
decorative scheme consisting 
of geometric patterns, calli-
graphy, interlaced floral motifs 
and glazed tilework of many 
colours, with blue predomi-
nating, graces the façade. 
From this entranceway the  
silhouette of the minaret of 
the Bou Inania Medersa can 
be glimpsed on the left.
Rue Talaa Kebira 4
Reached via Bab Boujeloud.
This thoroughfare, whose 
name means “Great Climb” 
and which is partly covered 
by a cane canopy, is lined 
with small shops along  
almost its entire length. It is 
continued by the Ras Tiyalin 
and Aïn Allou souks and by 
spice markets. The street 
passes the kissaria and ends

The Souks 5
The souks of Fès el-Bali 
spread out beyond the Ech 
Cherabliyine Mosque.
 The location of each souk 
reflects a hierarchy dictated 
by the value placed on the 
various goods on offer in 
each of them. Makers and 
sellers are grouped together 
according to the products that 
they offer. Every type of craft 
has its own street, or part of a 
street, around the Karaouiyine 
Mosque, which has resulted 
in a logical but relatively 
complex layout. While the  
El-Attarine Souk sells spices, 
there is also a Slipper Souk 
and a Henna Souk, which is 
laid out in an attractive  
shaded square planted with 
arbuses. A plaque records  
that the Sidi Frijthe maristan, 
which was the largest mental 
asylum in the Merinid empire, 
once stood on this square. 
Built by Abou Yacoub 
Youssef (1286–1307), it also 
functioned as a hospital for 
storks. It was still in existence 
in 1944. In the 16th century, 
Leo Africanus, known today 
for his accounts of his travels, 
worked there as a clerk for 
two years.
 The kissaria, near the 
Zaouia of Moulay Idriss, 
marks the exact centre of the 
souks. This is a gridwork of 
covered streets where shops 
selling luxury goods are  
especially conspicuous. Some 
of the fine silks and brocades, 
high-quality kaftans and  
jewellery on offer here supply 
the international market.
at the Karaouiyine Mosque 
(see pp176–7). Running 
parallel to it at its southern 
end is another important 
street, Rue Talaa Seghira 
(“Short Climb”), which joins 
up with Rue Talaa Kebira at 
Aïn Allou. These streets are 
the two principal cultural  
and economic thoroughfares 
of Fès el-Bali. The city’s  
most important buildings  
are located here.
 Opposite the Bou Inania 
Medersa (see pp172–3) stands 
Dar el-Magana (House of the 
Clock), built by the ruler 
Abou Inan in 1357. It contains 
a water-clock built by Fassi 
craftsmen during the Merinid 
period. It is currently under-
going restoration.
 Not far from here, level 
with a covered passage in  
the Blida Quarter, is the 
Zaouia el-Tijaniya, containing 
the tomb of Ahmed el-Tijani, 
master of Tariqa el-Tijaniya 
(The Way), a doctrine that 
spread widely throughout the 
Maghreb and sub-Saharan 
Africa. Further on are three 
musical instrument work-
shops. Makers of stringed 
instruments have almost  
completely disappeared from 
Fès; the only remaining  
practitioner is a craftsman in 
Rue Talaa Seghira, opposite 
Dar Mnebhi, who still makes 
ouds (lutes) by traditional 
methods. Beyond is the skin-
dressers’ fondouk, which 
contains leather workshops.
 Across the Bou Rous bridge 
stands the Ech Cherabliyine 
Mosque (Mosque of the 
Slipper-Makers). Built by  
the Merinid sultan Abou el-
Hassan, it is distinguished  
by its elegant minaret.

Not far from the Henna Souk, 
the impressive Fondouk el-
Nejjarine, with an elegant 
fountain, is one of the most 
renowned buildings in Fès. 
Built by the amine (provost) 
Adeyel in the 18th century, 
this former caravanserai  
provided food, rest and  
shelter to the traders in  
luxury goods arriving from 
the interior. Classed as a  
historic monument in 1916,  
it is now one of UNESCO’s 
World Heritage Sites. Its  
restoration formed part of the 
preservation programme  
carried out on the whole 
medina. The fondouk’s three 
floors house the privately run 
Musée du Bois (Museum of 
Wood). The displays include 
carved doors from the mag-
nificent Bou Inania Medersa 
(see pp172–3).

The palace of Dar el-Batha was begun 
between 1873 and 1875 by Moulay  
el-Hassan, and was completed by Moulay 
Abdel Aziz in 1897. The location of the 
palace was an area of neglected gardens, 
which had been irrigated by a river. The 
sultan, who wanted to make the palace a 
residence worthy of being used for official 
receptions, added an imposing courtyard covered with 
coloured tiles and featuring a large fountain. He also 
laid out a large and very fine Andalusian garden. 
Despite many later alterations, the traditional Moorish 
features of this relatively recent building have survived.
EXPLORING THE 
COLLECTIONS OF THE 
MUSÉE DAR EL-BATHA
In 1914, the Orientalist 
Alfred Bel made the first 
bequest to the future 
ethnographic musem 
which, by royal 
decree, became 
the museum of 
local crafts 
(Musée des Arts 
et des Traditions) 
in 1915.
 Today, the  
permanent  
exhibition, which fills 
12 rooms, consists 
of more than 500 
objects selected 
from the 5,000 that the  
museum has acquired. They 
are shown in two large  
sections. The ethnographic 
section, featuring the arts and 
crafts of Fès and the rural 
crafts of neighbouring areas, 
fills the first eight rooms. The 
archaeological section is laid 
out in the four remaining 
rooms. Particularly notable  
is the display tracing the 
development of architecture 
in Fès, from the Idrissid  
period to that of the Alaouites.
manuscript copies of the 
Koran made on parchment  
in the 16th to 18th centuries; 
prayer books by the Sufi 
scholar El-Jazouli; and impor-
tant manuscripts written in 
the Andalusian cursive 
style of calligraphy, 
which was widely 
used in Morocco 
in the 8th and 
9th centuries. 
Examples of  
illuminated  
calligraphy with 
geometric decora-
tive motifs, as  
well as other  
exhibits, highlight  
the role that Fès 
played in the 
development  
and diffusion of learning.

BOOKS AND 
MANUSCRIPTS
Room 1 contains some 
extremely fine leather-bound 
books dating from the 11th 
century. Their embossed and 
gold-painted decoration is a 
tradition peculiar to Fès that 
stayed alive until the 17th 
century. Also on display are 
CERAMICS
The original location of the 
potters’ souk, next to the 
Karaouiyine Mosque, is proof 
of the respect and repute in 
which the makers of the 
famous Fès blue and white 
ware were held. As well as 
this pottery, Room 2 contains 
dishes and jebbana (tradi-
tional earthenware vessels)  
with polychrome decoration 
in blue, green, yellow and 
brown over a white tin glaze, 
or with sboula (herringbone) 
or chebka (scale) motifs. 
Some of the dishes with  
green motifs displayed in 
Case 11 are examples of 
zarghmil, the famous  
“centipede” style of decora-
tion characteristic of Fès.
LEATHERWORK
The exhibits in Room 3  
include a fragment of a 13th-
century candelabra from the 
Karaouiyine Mosque, 
alms measures made 
in Fès in the 14th to 
18th centuries, some 
fine astrolabes and 
a number of  
instruments for 
determining the 
times of day at 
which prayers are 
to be said, for indi-
cating the direction of  
Mecca and for tracking  
the lunar calendar.
 There are also lamps,  
writing tables and a medicine 
bowl decorated with verses 
from the Koran and formulae; 
various equipment for use in 
the hammam and for brewing 
and drinking tea; and a fine 
18th-century tray embellished 
with a complex geometric 
pattern. Each of these pieces 
demonstrates the consummate 
skill and exceptional creativity 
of the craftsmen of Fès, who 
in making them fulfilled the 
religious, scientific and  
symbolic needs of their time.
WOOD, EMBROIDERY 
AND WEAVING
The furniture in Room 4, 
including chests and sets of 
shelves, shows both the range 
of woods used (cedar, thuya, 
almond, walnut, ebony, citron 
and mahogany) and a range

RURAL CRAFTS
Objects of everyday life from 
various regions of Morocco 
are exhibited in Room 6:  
pottery made by the women 
of the Rif, carpets from the 
Middle Atlas, and fine Berber 
jewellery, such as brooches, 
pectorals, necklaces, finger 
rings and bracelets. All these 
show the skills and  
inventiveness of Moroccan 
craftsmen and craftswomen.

A display of doors fills  
Room 7. Doors from ordinary 
houses and large palace doors 
carved and decorated with 
patterns of nails are shown 
with a selection of door locks 
from houses in Fès.
THE ART OF ZELLIJ
Room 9 is devoted to zellij 
tilework made in Fès from  
the 14th to the 18th centuries 
and among the finest of its 
kind.
 One of the exhibits, a 
remarkable panel from the 
Bou Inania Medersa, perfectly 
exemplifies this brilliant  
tradition of architectural  
decoration in Morocco. The 
rich aesthetic vocabulary of 
this art form brings to life 
plain surfaces with a lively 
play of patterns and colours.
MONUMENTAL 
WOODCARVING
The displays in Rooms 10  
and 11 trace the evolution of 
monumental woodcarving in 
Fès from the 9th century to 
the present day. Among the 
most interesting pieces are a 
lintel from the Karaouiyine 
Mosque (877) and the monum-

Arabic Calligraphy
Islam traditionally forbids all  
figurative representation, and 
since the 8th century this pro-
hibition has encouraged the use of 
calligraphy in Arabic civilization. 
Decorative writing became an art 
form that was used not only for 
manuscripts but also to decorate 
buildings. Islamic calligraphy is closely 
connected to the revelation of the 
Koran: the word of God is to be trans-
cribed in a beautiful script far finer than 
secular writing. Writing out not only 
the Koran, but also the 99 names of 
Allah is considered to be a very pious 
undertaking. The importance  
of this art form in Islamic  
civilization is shown by the 
carved, painted or tiled friezes 
that decorate the walls and 
domes of mosques and  
medersas, as well as by the 
thousands of scientific, literary 
and religious calligraphic manuscripts 
preserved in public and private libraries. 
Maghrebi script, used in the Maghreb, in 
Andalusia and in the Sudan, is derived 
from Kufic script, which is named after 
the town of Kufa, in Iraq, where this 
style of writing originated.
Cursive script, like this 
example from the Bou  
Inania Medersa, may appear 
in the form of carved zellij 
work. Calligraphic friezes, 
often with a religious content, 
were made both for public 
buildings and private houses.
Decorative details, 
like this one from 
an anonymous 
manuscript of a 
musical score, 
shows that  
calligraphy was 
sometimes more 
ornamental than 
purely functional.

Hassan II Mosque.
This illuminated manuscript 
of a hadih, recording the 
words and deeds of the 
Prophet Mohammed, is in 
Maghrebi script. With gold 
and bright colours,  
illumination enriches both 
religious and secular  
manuscripts. The finest  
illuminated manuscripts  
are preserved in the  
Royal Library in Rabat.
INKWELLS
Used for calligraphy 
and for illumination, 
inkwells were made  
in the shape of a 
koubba, the shrine  
of a Muslim saint.
The compartments  
in these mejma inkwells were designed to hold the inks of different  
colours that were used for illumination.

MANUSCRIPTS AND FRIEZES
Quotations from the Koran are 
omnipresent in manuscripts 
and calligraphic friezes. 
Calligraphy appears in all 
dimensions and on a great 
variety of surfaces. Maghrebi 
script is characterized by  
rounded letters combined with 
slender descenders and ascenders.
This detail from an illuminated manuscript in  
Maghrebi script, produced in Rabat in the 8th century, 
features plant motifs.

Zaouia of Moulay 
Idriss II 8
¢ to non-Muslims. Glimpses 
possible through the open doors.
The Zaouia of Moulay Idriss 
II, containing the tomb of  
the second Idrissid ruler  
(considered to be the founder 
of Fès) is the most venerated 
shrine in Morocco. Built in 
the centre of the city at the 
beginning of the 18th century, 
during the reign of Moulay 
Ismaïl, the building was 
restored in the mid-19th  
century. The pyramidal dome 
that covers the saint’s tomb 
and its polychrome minaret 
give it a majestic silhouette. 
The courtyard of the mosque 
contains a fountain which 
consists of a white marble 
basin on a shaft, richly deco-
rated with zellij tilework.
 The horm, the perimeter 
wall around the zaouia, is 
also holy. The narrow streets 
leading to the shrine are barred 
at mid-height by a wooden 
beam that is supposed to pre-
vent the passage of beasts of 
burden. The horm also made 
the shrine an inviolable place, 
so that in the past outlaws 
would find sanctuary here.
 At the end of each summer, 
during a moussem lasting two 
to three days, this place of 
pilgrimage attracts not only 
the inhabitants of Fès but also 
people from the surrounding 
countryside and mountain-
dwellers from distant tribes. 
They all come to receive a 
blessing and baraka (“bene-
ficient force”). The motley 
crowd of the faithful is made 
up of pilgrims and beggars,  
as well as nougat, candle and 
incense sellers whose goods 
are used as tomb offerings.

The El-Attarine Medersa 
(Medersa of the Spice  
Sellers) stands in the neigh-
bourhood of the Karaouiyine 
Mosque and the El-Attarine 
Souk. With the Bou Inania 
Medersa (see pp172–3), it 
is considered to be one of  
the wonders of Moorish  
architecture. It was built 
between 1323 and 1325 by 
the Merinid sultan Abou  
Saïd Othman, and has all  
the elements specific to a 
medieval Muslim school.
The highly decorated entrance 
leads through to a courtyard 
paved with zellij tilework in a 
two-colour pattern of brown 
and white, and enclosing an 
ablutions fountain. A cladding 
of polychrome tiles covers the 
base of the courtyard’s four 
interior walls and its columns. 
A door with fine decoration 
and exquisite fittings leads 
from the courtyard to the 
prayer hall, which contains a 
mihrab. The prayer hall has a 
highly decorated ceiling, walls 
featuring luxuriant stuccowork 
and zellij work, and lintels 
with epigraphic decoration.
 The students’ rooms, look-
ing onto the courtyard from 
the upper floor, have wind-
ows fronted by turned wood-
en railings. The terrace offers 
a view of the rooftops of Fès 
el-Bali and the courtyard of 
the Karaouiyine Mosque.
El-Cherratine 
Medersa 0
Rue El-Cherratine. &
Located southeast of the  
Karaouiyine Mosque, in  
Rue el-Cherratine (Street of 
the Ropemakers), this medersa 
was built by Moulay Rachid, 
the first Alaouite sultan, in 
1670. Although it is structurally 
similar to the Merinid  
medersas, it is less elaborately 
decorated. Adding to the 
building’s austerity are the 
high, narrow residential units 
known as douiras, which 
stand in three corners of the 
courtyard. The tiny cells inside 
were for the use of students.
 Entry into the medersa is 
through beautiful double 
doors cased in engraved 
bronze. The doors open onto 
a passageway with a fine 
carved and painted wooden 
ceiling, which in turn leads  
to the Moorish courtyard.

This is the largest and most sumptuously 
decorated medersa ever built by the 
Merinids. Constructed between 1350 
and 1355 by the sultan Abou Inan, it  
is the only medersa in Morocco that 
has a minbar (pulpit) and a minaret. A 
mosque, cathedral, students’ residence 
and school combined, its functions 
have determined its architectural  
complexity. The one-storey building, on a rectangular 
plan, is arranged around a square Moorish courtyard 
paved with marble and onyx, and surrounded on three 
sides by a cloister. It is one of the few Islamic religious 
buildings that is open to non-Muslims.

THE MOROCCAN MEDERSA
The medersa was both a cultural and a reli-
gious establishment. It was primarily a resi-
dential college, designed for local students 
from the town or city and especially for 
those from the immediate or more distant 
rural areas, but also for anyone who came 
in search of learning. It was an extension of 
the great university-mosque, an institution once restricted 
to the study of religion, law, science and even the arts. It 
was finally a place of prayer and reflection. The medersas 
of Fès, home to the greatest scholars in the country, were 
the most highly esteemed in Morocco.

The Tanneries of Fès
Often located near watercourses, 
and usually some distance from 
residential quarters because of  
the unpleasant odours that they 
produced, tanneries made a  
substantial contribution to a city’s 
economy. Tanning is a craft with 
traditions that go back thousands 
of years. The process turns  
animal hides into soft, rot-proof 
leather. Once tanned, the hides 
are passed on to leatherworkers.
The dried hides are rinsed in generous  
quantities of water. They are then softened  
by being steeped in baths of fatty solutions.
The tanned hides are hung out to dry on the 
terraces of the medina, as here, or in other parts 
of Fès, such as the Bab el-Guissa cemetery. The 
roofs of houses and the hillsides around the  
city may also be used as drying areas.
Natural pigments, obtained from certain  
plants and minerals, are still used by  
Moroccan craftsmen to colour the hides.  
However, chemical dyes are also used today.
Dyed leather is used to make many types  
of useful and decorative objects, such as 
embroidered bags, babouches, pouffes and 
clothing. These goods are offered for sale in  
the numerous souks in the medina of Fès.
Vats, some of which have been in use for cen-
turies, are used for soaking skins after the hair 
and flesh have been removed. The tanning 
solution that turns them into leather is obtained 
from the bark of pomegranate or mimosa.
STAGES IN THE TANNING PROCESS
In Fès, the tanneries (chouaras) are located 
near Wadi Fès. The hides of sheep, goats, 
cows and camels undergo several processes 
– including the removal of hair and flesh, 
followed by soaking in vats, then by drying 
and rinsing – before they are ready to be 
dyed and handed over to leatherworkers.

Tanners’ Quarter w
North of Place el-Seffarine.
The Chouara, or Tanners’ 
Quarter, has been located 
near Wadi Fès since the  
Middle Ages. Its dyeing vats, 
in the midst of houses in the 
Blida quarter, are best seen 
from neighbouring terraces. 
Although pervaded by an 
unpleasantly strong smell, this 
is the most lively and pictur-
esque of all the souks in Fès.
Place el-Seffarine e
Fès is the most important  
centre for the production of 
brassware and silverware in 
Morocco. The workshops of 
brass-workers and copper-
smiths that line Place el- 
Seffarine have been here for 
centuries. The pretty fountain 
with fleur-de-lis decoration is 
worth a look. It was probably 
built by French convicts in 
the 16th century.
 North of the square is the 
14th-century Karaouiyine 
Library, which was set up 
on the orders of the sultan 
Abou Inan. It was used by  
the greatest Moorish men  
of learning, including the  
philosopher and doctor Ibn 
Rushd, known as Averroës 
(see p231), the philosopher 
Ibn Tufayl, the historian  
Ibn Khaldoun and the  
16th-century traveller Leo 
Africanus. The manuscripts 
that once formed part of the 
library’s collection have been 
transferred to the Royal 
Library in Rabat.
The El-Seffarine Medersa, 
opposite the Karaouiyine 
Library, was built in 1280  
and is the oldest medersa in 
Morocco that is still in use. 
The El-Mesbahiya Medersa, 
also north of the square, was 
built by the Merinid sultan 
Abou el Hassan in 1346. Further 
on, on the right, is the 16th-
century Tetouani Fondouk, 
which accommodated traders 
and students from Tetouan.
 Place el-Seffarine leads to

by the Andalusians who lived 
in the Karaouiyine Quarter. Its 
present appearance dates from 
the reign of the Almohad ruler 
Mohammed el-Nasser (13th 
century). The Merinids added 
a fountain in 1306 and funded 
the establishment of a library 
here in 1416. Non-Muslims 
can only admire the building 
from the exterior; notable are 
the great north entrance, with 
a carved cedar awning, and 
the domed Zenet minaret.

of the Alaouite ruler Sidi 
Mohammed ben Abdallah. 
Outside the ramparts, on a

The Andalusian Quarter

better provided with water. 
Nevertheless, this part of the 
city, which is quieter and 
more residential, has monu-
ments that are worth a visit.
 The El-Sahrij Medersa, built 
in 1321 takes its name from 
the large water basin in one 
of the courtyards. This is con-
sidered to be the third-finest 
medersa in Fès after the Bou 
Inania and the El-Attarine 
medersas. The Mausoleum 
of Sidi Bou Ghaleb, in the 
street of that name, is that of 
a holy man from Andalusia 
who lived and taught in Fès 
in the 12th century.

Established in 859, the Karaouiyine Mosque is one of 
the oldest and most illustrious mosques in the western 
Muslim world. The first university to be established in 
Morocco, it was frequented by such learned men as 
Ibn Khaldoun (see p181), Ibn el-Khatib, Averroës (see 
p231) and even Pope Sylvester II (909–1003). Named 
after the quarter in which it was built – that of  
refugees from Kairouan, in Tunisia – it was founded 
by Fatima bint Mohammed el-Fihri, a religious woman 
from Kairouan, who donated her worldly riches for its 
construction. It is still considered to be one of the 
main spiritual and intellectual centres of Islam and 
remains the seat of the Muslim university of Fès.

minaret, are designed for 
prayer and for teaching  
the Koran. Zaouias are 
sanctuaries where religious 
brotherhoods gather. The 
mosque, which stands both 
as a civic and a social  
symbol, is simultaneously  
a place of worship, a  
university, a tribunal, an

and a friendly meeting 
place. The call to prayer  
is given 
by the

Fès el-Jedid, meaning New Fès or White Fès, was built 
in 1276 by Merinid princes as a stronghold against  
the permanent threat of the rebellious Fassis, and as  
a vantage point from which to survey their activities  
in the old town. Surrounded by ramparts, Fès el-Jedid 
was primarily a kasbah, and its political and military 
role predominated over the civic functions of a true 
Islamic town. It was the administrative centre of 
Morocco up to 1912.
 Fès el-Jedid consists of several distinct units. In the 
west is the royal palace, and other buildings associated 
with it, and the Moulay Abdallah Quarter. In the south 
is the mellah, or Jewish quarter, a maze of dark,  
narrow streets. In the east are the Muslim quarters.
P Dar el-Makhzen
¢ to the public.
This palatial complex in the 
centre of Fès el-Jedid is  
surrounded by high walls  
and covers more than 80 ha 
(195 acres). It was the main 
residence of the sultan, 
together with his guard and 
his retinue of servants. It was 
also where dignitaries of the 
makhzen (central govern-
ment) came to carry out  
their duties. Part of the palace 
is still used by the king of 
Morocco when he comes  
to stay in Fès.
 The main entrance to  
the complex, on the huge 
Place des Alaouites, is  
particularly imposing. Its  
magnificent Moorish gateway, 
which is permanently closed, 
is richly ornamented. The 
exquisitely engraved bronze 
doors are fitted with fine 
bronze knockers.
 The walls enclose a  
disparate ensemble of  
buildings: palaces arranged 
around courtyards or large 
patios, as well as official 
buildings, notably the Dar  
el-Bahia, where Arab summit 
meetings are held; the Dar 
Ayad el-Kebira, built in the 
18th century by Sidi  
Mohammed ben Abdallah; 
administrative and military 
buildings; and gardens, 
including the enclosed  
Lalla Mina Gardens.
 The complex also  
includes a mosque and  
a medersa, which was 
built in 1320 by the 
Merinid prince Abou 
Saïd Othman. There  
is also a menagerie.

Detail of Bab Segma, north of  
the old méchouar
that once led to the former 
méchouar. On the southern 
side is the monumental  
Bab el-Semarine (Gate of  
the Farriers). This is a  
monumental vaulted gateway, 
beneath which a souk for all 
sorts of food takes place; the 
stalls are laid out in the  
old Merinid grain stores.
 The two gates are  
connected by Grande Rue  
de Fès el-Jedid, the main 
north–south artery through 
the city. The street, covered 
by a cane canopy at its  
northern extremity, is lined 
with an almost continuous 
succession of shops. This  
congested thoroughfare is the 
economic centre of the royal 
city. At intervals it is flanked 
by quiet residential quarters 
with a maze-like layout like 
that of all Muslim towns.
 On the western side of  
the street, a small quarter 
huddles around the Lalla el-
Azhar Mosque (Mosque of  
the Lady Flower), which was 
built by the Merinid sultan 
Abou Inan in 1357. On the 
eastern side are the humble

(Red Mosque) with a 14th-
century minaret, and Jama  
el-Beïda (White Mosque).

IBN KHALDOUN
Abderrahman Ibn  
Khaldoun was born in 
Tunis in 1332 into a  
family of great scholars.
In about 1350 he came  
to Fès, which at the  
time was the leading  
intellectual centre in the 
Maghreb, and became 
diplomatic secretary to  
the sultan Abou Inan.
He taught in Cairo, where 
he died in 1406. His 
extensive writings include 
Discourse on Universal 
History. He is considered 
to be the founder of  
sociology, and is without 
a doubt one  
of the greatest 
historians of  
all time.

P Mellah
Accessible via Place des Alaouites  
or Bab el-Mellah.
Bab el-Semarine, then Bab el-
Mellah leads into the mellah, 
the Jewish quarter of Fès. The 
name mellah probably comes 
from the Arabic word for 
“salt”, the terrain on which 
the quarter grew up.
 This quarter, thought to  
be the first Jewish enclave  
to be established in Morocco, 
was originally located in the 
northern part of Fès el-Bali, in 
the El-Yahoudi Quarter next 
to the Karaouiyine district.
In the early 13th century the 
Merinid rulers moved it near 
the palace, to the site of a 
former kasbah that was once 
occupied by the sultan’s  
Syrian archers. The rulers of 
Fès had undertaken to protect 
the Jewish community, in 
return for an annual levy  
collected by the state treasury. 
The Jewish quarter’s new 
location afforded the  
inhabitants greater security.
 With its souks, workshops, 
schools, synagogues and a 
cemetery, the quarter  
flourished, providing the  
Jewish community with  
strong social cohesion and 
unrivalled opportunities for 
social advancement. Like the 
Muslims elsewhere, most of 
the Jews in the district were 
grouped according to their 
craft speciality. Thus Leo  
Africanus mentioned metal-
working, recording that only 
the Jews worked with gold 
and silver. Today, the Jews  
of Fès have left to settle in 
Casablanca or have emigrated 
abroad, to Israel in particular.
 Exploring the mellah 
reveals a striking contrast  
with the Muslim quarters.  
In architectural terms it is 
another world, the buildings 
being higher, narrower and 
more closely spaced. The 
present boundaries of the 
Jewish quarter were  
established only at the end  
of the 18th century, during 
the time of the Alaouite sultan 
Moulay Yazid, and the space 
available was small. As a 
result, the inhabitants were 
forced to build two-storey 
houses around tiny court-
yards, and space to move 
around in is very restricted.
P Rue des Mérinides and 
Rue Boukhessissat
Accessible via Bab el-Semarine or 
Place des Alaouites. Jewellery Souk 
# from 9am Sat–Thu.
A central rectilinear axis, lined 
with various workshops and a 
kissaria, divides the mellah 
into two. All the commercial 
activity in the quarter takes 
place in this street, which  
was once the economic and 
spiritual centre of the mellah. 
Rue des Mérinides cuts 
through the jewellery souk, 
where Jewish goldsmiths 
could once be seen at work.
 Rue Boukhessissat  
separates the mellah from  
the Dar el-Makhzen. With 
some luxury residences, this 
was once the aristocratic  
area. The design of the  
houses here is the most  
unified and harmonious  
in the mellah. The rows  
of houses open onto the 
street, each house having  
a workshop on the ground 
floor. The upper storeys are 
fronted by the generously 
proportioned, finely carved 
wooden balconies that are 
characteristic of the Jewish 
architecture of Fès.
u Danan Synagogue
Rue Der el-Feran Teati. # 9am–5pm 
daily. No entrance fee but a small 
contribution is requested.  
Jewish Cemetery ¢ Sat.
The 17th-century synagogue, 
the property of a family of 
rabbis from Andalusia, looks 
as if it has been squeezed in 
between the houses in the 
mellah. The interior is divided 
into four aisles. A trap door in 
the aisle on the far right 
opens onto a stairway that 
leads down to a mikve – a 
bath for ritual purification 
where the faithful were 
cleansed of their sins. Above 
this fourth aisle is the azara, 
the women’s gallery, which

Bab Segma, the Merinid gate, 
and Bab el-Seba. It is here 
that the population gathered 
at sunset to watch dancers, 
musicians and storytellers. 
The Petit Méchouar, the 
smallest of the three, links the 
Méchouar de Bab Dekaken 
and Dar el-Makhzen. It can 
be reached through Bab el-
Seba (Gate of the Lion), 
which once defended the 
entrance to the palace.
 On Avenue des Français, 
just south of Bab el-Seba, a 
narrow street on the right, 
reachable through an opening 
in the wall, leads, after about 
150 m (165 yards), to a large 
noria (waterwheel) built in 
1287 by the Andalusians. The 
Makina was an arsenal, esta-
blished by Moulay el-Hassan  
in 1855 with the help of  
Italian officers. It was built on 
the west side of the Méchouar 
de Bab Dekaken. Having  
fallen into disuse, the Makina 
offers an overall view of the 
synagogue. It is worth going 
out onto the terrace for a 
sweeping view of the mellah, 
and of the white tombs of the 
Jewish cemetery below.
P The Méchouars
Méchouars are wide, walled 
parade grounds used on  
ceremonial military occasions. 
Processions and ceremonies, 
such as acts of allegiance and 
the acknowledgment of the 
royal right to rule, are also 
performed here. There are 
three such esplanades in  
Fès. The Grand Méchouar,  
in the northwest, also known 
as the Méchouar de Bab  
Boujat, is an extensive parade 
ground. The Méchouar de  
Bab Dekaken (Gate of the 
Benches), or Vieux Méchouar, 
in the northeast, is a  
rectangular esplanade with 
the high ramparts of the 
Makina on one side. It links 
was restored. It is now  
used as a concert hall  
and conference venue.
P Kasbah Cherarda
North of the town, accessible via 
Bab Segma.
Once known as the Kasbah 
el-Khmis (Thursday Fort), 
after the El-Khmis Souk which 
took place along the northern 
and eastern walls, this kasbah 
was built by Moulay Rachid in 
the 17th century. Its present 
name is derived from a former 
kasbah built nearby by a 
Cherarda caid (chief) to 
defend his tribe’s grain stores. 
With Bab Segma and Bab 
Dekaken, the kasbah formed 
a system of fortifications that 
controlled the road to Meknès 
and Tangier, and protected 
Fès el-Jedid and the inter-
section with Fès el-Bali.
 Enclosed within crenellated 
walls set with sturdy square 
towers, the kasbah has two 
monumental gateways, one 
on the western and the other 
on the eastern side. The  
kasbah now contains a  
hospital and an annexe of  
the Karaouiyine university. 
Beneath the walls on the 
southern and western sides, 
in an area where Almoravid 
and Almohad grain stores 
once stood, are the tombs of 
the Bab el-Mahrouk cemetery. 
Among them the small  
Mausoleum of Sidi Boubker 
el-Arabi can be seen.

MEKNÈS & VOLUBILIS
Located between the fertile plain of 
the Rarb and the Middle Atlas, Meknès 
and Volubilis lie at the heart of an agri-
cultural area that has been Morocco’s 
grain store since ancient times. The 
historical importance of the two  
c i t i e s  c a n  b e  c l e a r l y  
seen in the ruins of Volubilis, 
capital of Mauretania  
Tingitana and the most 
important archaeological 
site in Morocco, as well 
as in the grandeur of 
the Moorish buildings 
in Meknès.
From the time of its foundation in 
the tenth century to the arrival of the 
Alaouites in the 17th century, Meknès 
was no more than a small town over-
shadowed by Fès, its neighbour and 
rival. It was not until the reign of 
Moulay Ismaïl (see pp54–5), which 
began in 1672, that Meknès first rose 
to the rank of imperial 
city. With tireless 
energy, the sultan 
set about building 
gates, ramparts, 
mosques and palaces. 
This ambitious building pro-
gramme continued throughout his 
reign and involved robbing the 
ruins of Volubilis (see pp 202–5) 
and the Palais el-Badi in Marrakech 
(see p235). After 50 years, work was 
still not completed. Although the sul-
tan’s impatience was often a hin-
drance, he reinvigorated palace 
architecture.
Today, Meknès is the fifth-largest city 
in Morocco, with a population of 
550,000. It is a dynamic economic 
centre, renowned for its olives, wine 
and mint tea. The imperial city stands 
alongside the new town, on the banks 
of Wadi Boufekrane.

Exploring Meknès
Three well-defined quarters –  
the medina, the imperial city 
and Ville Nouvelle (the  
New Town) – make up the 
city of Meknès. The medina  
is a densely packed quarter. 
The kasbah, or imperial  
city, contains the finest  
of the lavish buildings  
constructed by Moulay 
Ismaïl. Ville Nouvelle is 
located on the east bank  
of Wadi Boufekrane.

Grand Mosque 3
Rue des Souk es Sebbat, Meknès. 
# daily. ¢ to non-Muslims.
The Grand Mosque, which 
stands near the souks and  
the Bou Inania Medersa, was 
established in the 12th cen-
tury during the reign of the 
Almoravids. It was remodel-
led in the 14th century. The 
main façade is pierced by an 
imposing doorway with a 
carved awning. The green-
glazed terracotta tiles of the 
roof and of the 18th-century 
minaret are particularly  
striking, the bright sunlight 
giving them an almost  
translucent appearance.
 The Palais el-Mansour, a 
sumptuous 19th-century resi-
dence in Rue Karmouni, has 
been converted into a carpet 
and souvenir bazaar.
Souks and Kissaria 2
Rue des Souks, Meknès. # daily.
A network of small covered 
or open streets lined with 
shops and workshops, the 
souks are a fascinating en- 
capsulation of the 17th- and 
18th-century Moroccan urban 
environment. Rue des Souks, 
near Bab Berrima, is filled 
with hardware merchants 
(akarir), corn chandlers  
(bezzazine), and fabric sellers 
(serrayriya), while metalsmiths 
(haddadin) are to be found 
in the old Rue des Armuriers.

Encircling the medina, Meknès.
Protected by three stretches  
of wall that together amount to 
about 40 km (25 miles), the 
medina has the appearance  
of a sturdy fortress set with 
elegant gates. Bab el-Berdaïne 
(Gate of the Pack-Saddle-
Makers), on the northern side, 
was built by Moulay Ismaïl.
It is flanked by protruding 
square towers crowned by 
merlons, and stylized flowers 
in zellij tilework decorate its 
exterior façade. West of the 
gate, the walled cemetery 
contains one of the most 
highly venerated mausoleums 
in Morocco – that of Sidi 
Mohammed ben Aïssa,  
founder of the brotherhood  
of the Aïssaoua (see p198).
 On the southern side of the 
cemetery stands Bab el-Siba 
(Gate of Anarchy) and Bab el-
Jedid (New Gate, although in 
fact it is one of the oldest in 
Meknès). Further south is Bab 
Berrima, which leads into the 
medina’s principal souks. To 
the west stands Bab el-Khemis 
(Thursday Gate), which once 
led into the mellah, now non-
existent. The remarkable  
decoration of the gate’s 
façade is on a par with  
that of Bab el-Berdaïne.
 The layout of the medina,  
a medieval labyrinth, is  
identical to that of the other 
imperial cities. There are a 
few main thoroughfares.
Rue Karmouni, which runs 
through the quarter from 
north to south links Bab  
el-Berdaïne with the spiritual 
and economic heart of the 
Bab el-Berdaïne, one of the gates into the medina of Meknès
Minaret of the En-Nejjarine Mosque, 
the Mosque of the Carpenters

Mosque in Meknès
medina. Rue des Souks runs 
from Bab Berrima, in the 
west, also to the heart of  
the medina. Several smaller 
streets radiate from this  
centre, which is marked  
by the Grand Mosque and  
the Bou Inania Medersa.
Bab Berrima leads through  
to Souk En-Nejjarine, the  
Carpenters’ Souk, which is 
next to that of the brass and 
coppersmiths, and to the  
Cobblers’ Souk (sebbat).
 The En-Nejjarine Mosque, 
built by the Almohads in the 
12th century, was restored  
by Mohammed ben Abdallah 
in about 1756, when it was 
given a new minaret. Set  
back from the En-Nejjarine 
Souk, in the Ed-Dlala Kissaria, 
is the location of a Berber 
souk. Every day from 3pm  
to 4pm, the mountain- 
dwellers of the Middle Atlas 
come to sell carpets and  
blankets here at auction.

before the imperial city, it 
pierces the walls of the  
kasbah and leads through to 
Place Lalla Aouda and the Dar 
el-Kebira Quarter (see p192).
 Of monumental proportions 
and distinguished for its  
decoration, Bab Mansour el-
Aleuj is held to be the finest 
gate in Meknès, or even  
in Morocco. It was 
begun by the sultan 
Moulay Ismaïl in 
about 1672, when 
the building of the 
kasbah, his first 
project, was under 
way. The gate was 
completed during  
the reign of his son, 
Moulay Abdallah, in 
1732. The gate stands 
about 16 m (52 ft) high, while 
the arch has a span of 8 m 
(26 ft) wide and is surmounted 
by a pointed horseshoe arch.

SACRED SNAKES
Expelled from Meknès by the sultan in the 16th century, Sidi 
Mohammed ben Aïssa, founder of the Aïssaoua brotherhood 
(see p198), and his disciples fled to the desert. Famished, 
they ate whatever they could find – snakes, scorpions and 
cactus leaves. Ever since, the 
cobra has been the Aïssaoua’s 
mascot, and no member ever 
kills one. Being immune to 
their venom, the Aïssaoua 
are often called upon to rid 
villages of the dangerous 
reptiles. Cobras also feature 
in the Aïssaouas’ religious  
rituals, in which participants 
fall into a trance-like state.
lacing motifs is carved in 
relief on a background of  
predominantly green mosaics 
and tiles. The cornerpieces 
are filled with sgraffito floral 
decoration incised into dark-
glazed terracotta. The gate is 
framed by protruding towers 
built in the style of loggias. 
Temporary exhibitions are 
sometimes held here.
 Place el-Hedime (Square of 
Ruins) links the medina and 
the kasbah. It was laid out  
on the ruins of the Merinid 
kasbah that Moulay Ismaïl 
razed to make space for the 
palaces, water tanks, gardens, 
stables, arsenals and forts with 
which he planned to surround 
himself. The square has been 
restored and is now lined with 
modern residential buildings 
that are not in keeping with 
its historic character. Nearby, 
to the left of the square, is a 
covered food market.
Bou Inania 
Medersa 4
Rue des Souks es Sebbat, Meknès. 
# 8am–noon, 3–6pm daily. &
This Koranic school opposite 
the Grand Mosque was  
established by the Merinid 
sultans in the 14th century. 
The building is divided into 
two unequal parts with a  
long corridor between them. 
On the eastern side is the 
medersa proper, while on the 
western side is an annexe for 
ablutions (now no longer in 
use). The main entrance is 
crowned by a flat-sided dome 
and faced with horseshoe 
arches with delicate stucco-
work decoration.
 A corridor leads to a beauti-
ful courtyard in the centre of 
which is a pool. While three 
sides of the courtyard are 
lined with a gallery, the 
fourth opens onto the prayer 
hall. The green-tiled awnings, 
the sophisticated decoration 
of carved wood, stuccowork 
and colourful zellij tilework, 
as well as the mosaic-
like tiled floor make 
the whole courtyard 
an entrancing sight.
 The prayer hall, 
with carved stucco 
decoration and an 
elegant mihrab within 
a horseshoe arch, 
remains unaltered. 
Students’ cells fill the 
rest of the ground 
floor and the upper floor. The 
terrace offers a fine view of 
the medina and the Grand 
Mosque next to the medersa.

med Belarbi el-Jamaï, who was a grand 
vizier of Moulay el-Hassan in 1873–4. The 
sophisticated architecture of the palace 
includes painted wooden cornices. a green- 
tiled roof and a courtyard with two pools and zellij  
tilework. There is also an Andalusian garden planted 
with tall cypresses. Covering 2,845 sq m (30,600 sq ft), 
the palace also has several annexes and outbuildings.

EXPLORING THE MUSEUM 
OF MOROCCAN ARTS
Before it was converted  
into a regional ethno-
graphic museum, this 
palace incorporated a 
mosque, a garden, a 
menzah (pavilion),  
a courtyard, a small 
house, a kitchen and  
a hammam. Of the 
2,000-plus objects 
in the museum’s 
collection, some 
670 are on display.

CERAMICS
Ceramics from Fès and 
Meknès are displayed in 
Room 2. Fassi potters attained 
unprecedented renown for 
their famous blue and white 
ware. Two kinds of blue  
pigment were used: a pale 
blueish-grey, which was  
in use up until the mid-
19th century, and a clear 
blue with a violet tinge 
that was obtained  
by more recent  
industrial means.
 The Fassi potting 
industry probably 
goes back to the 
10th or 11th  
century. That of 
Meknès, by con-
trast, is much more 
recent, having 
been imported  
from Fès in about  
the 18th century. 
Three colours – 
brown, green and  
yellow – were used.
 Before the pottery 
was decorated, it was 
fired in a kiln and 
was then covered 
in white glaze.  
The potter would 
decorate this  
surface with elegant motifs  
of Moorish inspiration.

CARPETS
The museum’s richest section 
is that devoted to  
carpets, which fill  
Room 4. Most of the 
carpets and kilims on 
display come from  
the High and Middle 
Atlas. Among the latter, 
the most noteworthy 
pieces are those made 
by two Berber tribes, 
the Zemmour and the 
Beni M’Guild. Tradi-
tions of craftsmanship 
are still alive among 
these tribes today – a 
relatively rare phenomenon  
in Morocco – and carpets  
similar to those on display 
here are still being made.
 Meknès carpets are  
characterized by a mixture  
of bright colours forming  
geometric patterns. This  
section of the museum also 
includes a fine collection of 
beautiful gold-thread  
embroidery, another craft  
speciality that has brought 
Meknès renown.

GALLERY GUIDE
The eight exhibition rooms on the ground floor are 
arranged around the garden. Room 1 contains a display of 
carved and painted wood; Rooms 2 and 3 are devoted to 
ceramics; Room 4 to carpets and embroidery; Room 5 to 
kaftans and belts; Room 6 to jewellery; and Rooms 7 and  
8 to the art of damascening (see p191). On the upper floor, 
the reconstruction of a traditional Moroccan room can be 
seen. The museum has undergone renovation and its  
collections are now effectively displayed.
WOODWORK
Room 1, on the ground  
floor, contains examples  
of architectural features in 
wood – pieces of carved  
and painted wood that were 
used in the building or  
decoration of the palaces  
and town houses of Meknès.
 The exhibits also include a 
17th-century minbar (pulpit) 
that originally stood in the 
Grand Mosque in Meknès.

METALWORK
While ceramics 
reached their apogee in  
Fès, the craftsmen of Meknès 
were distinguished masters  
of the art of damascening. 
The technique consists of 
covering a metallic surface 
with a patterned filigree of 
gold, silver or copper. There 
are some particularly fine  
damascened vases in Rooms  
7 and 8. The craft is still very 
much alive in Meknès today, 
and some exquisite damas-
cened pieces can be found  
in the souks of the old town.
JEWELLERY
Jewellery from several  
regions of Morocco is  
displayed in Room 6.
Particular prominence  
is given to Berber jewellery.
 Metalworking is a  
traditional craft that was once 
widespread throughout the 
country, and was particularly 
associated with Jewish crafts-
men. Moroccan jewellery, 
which is typically made of 
gold or silver and sometimes 
set with precious or semi- 
precious stones, is made by 
age-old techniques. It forms 
an integral part of different 
types of dress (see pp36–7) 
and the way that it is worn  
THE MOROCCAN ROOM
As in other ethnographic 
museums in the country,  
this museum features a  
reconstruction of a traditional 
Moroccan room. On the 
upper floor, it has walls  
covered with zellij tilework 
and a carved wooden domed 
ceiling. It is furnished with 
pieces from various houses 
and palaces in Meknès.

COSTUMES
The costumes of 
town- and city- 
dwellers, especially 
the kaftan (see 
pp36–7), is the theme 
of Room 5. The brightly 
coloured kaftan, a long 
robe worn by women 
on special occasions, 
is the quintessential 
garment of city- 
dwellers. Kaftans were often 
embroidered with silk, silver 
or gold thread, as was the 
belt (mdamma) worn with 
the kaftan. Wealthy women 
might even wear a belt made 
of silver or solid gold. The 
mdamma now forms part of a 
young townswoman’s dowry.
is highly significant.  
Jewellery also once  
indicated the wearer’s 
geographical origin 
or tribal identity.
 
Modern copies  
of Berber jewellery 
can be seen today  
on offer in the souks.

EMBROIDERY
Embroidery is a time-honoured craft practised by the  
townswomen of Morocco. Young girls start to learn  
embroidery from childhood, being taught either in  
their homes or in a workshop, and always under the  
supervision of a teacher (maalma). Fès, Meknès, 
Marrakech, Rabat, Salé, Tetouan, Chefchaouen and  
Azemmour are the main centres of embroidery. Each town 
has its own characteristic colours, 
stitches and repertoire of motifs. Fès 
embroidery is characterized by tree-
like motifs, often depicted in a single 
colour. That of Salé alternates cross 
stitch and satin stitch. In Meknès 
embroidery (terz el-meknassi), 
motifs are peppered over the fabric, 
and bright colours are used to  
decorate tablecloths and scarves.

The first major place of wor-

three doorways. Two on the

the former méchouar (parade 
ground) and a smaller one,

filled with shanty dwellings.
 The Mausoleum of Moulay 
Ismaïl, the Lalla Aouda Mosque 
and a monumental gate near 
Bab Bou Ameïr are the last 
surviving vestiges of the 
ostentatiously grand complex 
that the sultan had envisaged.
 The second complex, which 
is now in complete ruins, was 
the Dar el-Medrasa. The palace 
comprised suites of residential 
rooms, some of which were 
used exclusively by the sultan 
and his harem.

Behind Place Lalla Aouda (between 
Bab Moulay and the Lalla Aouda 
Mosque), Meknès.
This quarter forms part of 
what is known as the Imperial 
City, or the Kasbah of Moulay 
Ismaïl. Covering an area four 
times as large as that of the 
medina, the whole quarter is 
in keeping with the grand 
ambitions of this enterprising 
sultan. Protected by a double 
line of walls and monumental 
angled gates, the Imperial 
City has the appearance of an 
impregnable ksar (fortified 
village). It contains wide  
avenues and large squares, 
palaces with attractive pools 
and extensive gardens,  
as well as administrative 
buildings enclosed within 
their own ramparts.
 The Imperial City comprises 
three palatial complexes: Dar 
el-Kebira, Dar el-Medrasa and 
Ksar el-Mhanncha. Dar el-
Kebira, the Quarter of the 
Large House, is located south-
east of the medina. It was the 
first palatial complex of the 
Imperial City that Moulay 
Ismaïl ordered to be built,  
in about 1672. It stands  
near Place Lalla Aouda,  
probably on the site of the 
former Almohad kasbah.
The complex was cut off  
from the urban bustle by  
a double wall and by Place 
el-Hedime (see p189).
 Each palace in Dar el-Kebira 
contained a harem, reception 
rooms, hammams, kitchens, 
armouries, ovens and mosques.

 Behind the pavilion are the 
former underground storage 
areas that were converted into 
the Christian Prison, or Habs 
Qara. The prisoners – probably 
Europeans captured by the 
corsairs of Rabat – were made 
to work on the sultan’s hercu-
lean building projects. Chroni-
clers recorded that thousands 
of convicts were incarcerated 
in these underground galleries, 
which were later partly 
destroyed by an earthquake.

THE ROYAL CITIES
The creation of royal cities in the Islamic world dates from 
the late 8th century. The Almohads, the Merinids and the 
Alaouites under Moulay Ismaïl continued this tradition, and 
it spread throughout the Maghreb, where it survived until 
recently. The royal city is an 
architectural complex built  
to protect the king and his 
courtiers. Several palaces and 
other buildings were needed to 
accommodate all the members 
of the royal household. Water 
tanks were built to irrigate the 
many gardens and to supply  
the baths and hammams of  
the harem. Designed both for 
royal receptions and for the 
king’s private life, the royal  
city was architecturally the  
most sophisticated and most 
sumptuous component of a 
great urban centre.

sq ft) and its purpose was to 
supply water to the palace 
and the Imperial City,  
including its mosques,  
hammams, gardens and 
orchards. The women of the 
harem, so it is said, would sail 
on it in their pleasure boats.

huge barrel-vaulted building 
contains 15 rooms, each with 
a noria (water wheel) once 
worked by horses to draw 
underground water by means 
of scoops. The terraces offer  
a fine view of the city.
 Dar el-Ma gives access to 
Heri es-Souani, the so-called 
Grainstore Stables, which are 
considered to be one of the 
sultan’s finest creations. This 
monumental building, with 29 
aisles, was designed for storing 
grain. The thick walls, as well 
as a network of underground 
passages, maintained the  
temperature inside the grain-
store at a low and constant 
level. The ceilings collapsed 
during the earthquake of 1755.

(see pp238–9). The mausoleum was built in the 17th 
century and was remodelled in the 18th and 20th  
centuries. The wife of Moulay Ismaïl and his son, Moulay 
Ahmed al-Dahbi, as well as the sultan Moulay Abder-
rahman (1822–59), are laid to rest in the burial chamber, 
which is decorated with stuccowork and mosaics.

THE AÏSSAOUA
This brotherhood came into being 
in the 16th century. Its beliefs are 
based on the teachings of Sidi 
Mohammed ben Aïssa, a mystic 
who was born in the 15th century. 
Through El-Jazouli, the holy man 
of Marrakech, it is connected to 
Chadhiliya, the great Sufi “way” 
that spread throughout the Muslim 
world. The Aïssaoua brotherhood 
exists in Meknès (see p189) and 
Fès, and also in Algeria.
The pilgrimage to Sidi Ahmed  
Ou Mghanni takes place near  
Imilchil, in the territory of the  
Aït Haddidou. It is known as the 
Marriage Fair, as many betrothals 
are made on this occasion.
Like the Hamadcha, the Aïssaoua are a  
popular brotherhood because of some of their  
practices. During their moussem (festival) they  
perform long-drawn-out and impressive rituals, 
called hadras, which are accompanied by singing, 
dancing and drumming. These rituals may  
send them into a trance or lead followers to  
perform orgies of self-mutilation.
In Morocco, the Islamic faith of law-makers (fkihs)  
and learned men (ulema) coexists with popular forms 
of religion, in which the cult of saints and the role of 
brotherhoods (known as tariqas, meaning “ways”)  
are prominent. Many followers of these religions are 
craftsmen and traders, who gather to perform spiritualist 
rites (zikrs), involving singing, dancing and music, 
according to the teaching of their respective founder. 
These religions are connected to those of Eastern  
mystics, and they have spread well beyond the  
boundaries of Morocco. This spiritualist branch of  
Islam is widely known as Sufism, after the rough  
woollen garment (suf) worn by certain ascetics.
The Mausoleum of Sidi Mohammed ben 
Aïssa, in Meknès, contains the tomb of the 
holy man who founded the Aïssaoua “way”.
The spectacular ceremonies  
of the Aïssaoua, involving 
banners, drums and incense, 
have always made a deep 
impression on foreigners in 
Morocco. This scene, entitled 
Les Aïssaouas, was painted by 
Georges Clairin (1843–1919).
The Aïssaoua  
are always dressed 
in white. They have 
a fear of black.

TOMBS OF HOLY MEN
Followers gather eagerly in order to make pilgrimages to 
the many tombs of holy men (marabouts) so as to seek a 
blessing (baraka). These small mausoleums, which are often 
covered with a white dome known as a koubba, 
can be seen throughout the country. Some of 
the more important shrines – or zaouias 
– are the seat of a religious brother-
hood and, besides the tomb of the 
holy man, consist of buildings in 
which pilgrims are accommodated and religious instruction given. 
Once a year, certain pilgrimages take the form of moussems, great 
gatherings that are simultaneously joyous occasions, festivals for  
the performance of traditional shows and commercial fairs.
The moussem of Moulay Abdallah, near El-
Jadida, can draw up to 150,000 visitors and 
a huge tent city springs up on the site.
During the moussem of Moulay Idriss II in  
Fès, the various guilds of craftsmen, such as 
tanners, shoemakers, blacksmiths, brass-founders 
and coppersmiths, as here, process through the 
medina, bringing gifts and sacrifices to the 
zaouia (shrine) of this highly venerated holy man.
The moussem in Guelmim, a town on the  
caravan route on the edge of the Sahara (see 
p294), takes place each June in honour of the 
holy man Sidi el-Ghazi. Attended by the  
Reguibat, nomads known as the “blue men”, 
this is also when a major camel fair takes place.

Culminating in Jbel Zerhoun, 
which rises to a height of 
1,118 m (3,670 ft), the massif 
forms part of an extensive 
range of hills bordering the 
southern side of the Rif and 
running from the region of 
Meknès to the environs of 
Taza in the east.
 This pre-Riffian terrain,  
consisting mostly of clay  
and marl, is very susceptible 
to fluvial erosion. As a result, 
a few outcrops of harder 
limestone and sandstone  
have emerged, one of which 
is Jbel Zerhoun, whose  
gorges, peaks and cliffs have 
all been created by erosion.
 Water is abundant here, and 
the Romans tapped the springs 
to supply Volubilis. Large  
villages grew up on the hill-
sides, along the line of springs 
and at the foot of the massif. 
While fig trees, orange trees 
and olive trees grow on the 
higher slopes, corn and

The most spectacular sight of 
Moulay Idriss is from the scenic 
route from Volubilis to Nzala 
des Beni Ammar, which runs 
above the more frequently 
used N13. In a superb setting, 
the bright white town clings 
to two rocky outcrops bet-
ween which rises the Tomb  
of Idriss I, conspicuous with 
its green-tiled roof.
 Fleeing the persecution  
of the Abbassid caliphs of 
Baghdad, Idriss found a 
haven in Oualili (Volubilis). A 
descendant of Ali, son-in-law 
of the Prophet Mohammed, 
he founded the first Arab-
Muslim dynasty in Morocco. 
He died in 791 and was  
buried in the town that now 
bears his name. It was not 
until the 16th century that the 
town began to prosper, and it 
was still in the process of de-
veloping in the 17th century, 
during the reign of Moulay  
Ismaïl (see pp54–5). The latter 
Moulay Idriss, clinging to an outcrop of rock
endowed it with defensive 
walls and a monumental gate, 
as well as Koranic schools, 
fountains and a new dome  
for the mausoleum.
 The Tomb of Idriss I is closed 
to non-Muslims, and a wooden 
beam across the entrance 
marks this as sacred ground,

COUNTRY SOUKS
At daybreak, hundreds of country people travelling on foot, 
on donkeys or in heavily laden trucks make their way to a 
site where tents and stalls are being set up. Around 850 
country souks – named after the day on which they take 
place – are held every week in Morocco, drawing people 
from up to 10 km (6 miles) around. On an area of open 
ground, alleys between the stalls form according to a well-
defined plan. The pattern on which the goods are laid out 
is similar to that of the economic layout of a medina. In  
the centre are such prized goods as fabric and clothing,  
followed by basketwork, carpets and blankets; on the 
periphery are second-hand items, scrap metal, 
humble traders such as cobblers and hair-
dressers, and also food stalls. Beyond, various 
livestock markets are laid out in separate areas.
 Souks allow townspeople to buy agricultural 
produce and craft items brought in by country 
people, who in turn stock up with groceries, 
sugar, tea and fruit. They provide services, 
entertainment and food, but also attract  
charlatans and storytellers. The civic autho-
rities also use souks to set up temporary  
registry offices, post offices and health  
centres. Permanent shops that may appear  
on the site of a weekly souk sometimes  
lead to the establishment of a new town.

Volubilis o
The ancient town of Volubilis backs on to a triangular 
spur jutting out from the Zerhoun Massif. The site was 
settled and began to prosper under the Mauretanian 
kings, from the 3rd century BC to AD 40. Temples from 
this period, as well as a strange tumulus, have been un-
covered. When Mauretania was annexed by the Roman 
emperor Claudius in AD 45, Volubilis was raised to the 
status of municipia (free town), becoming one of the 
most important cities in Tingitana. The public buildings 
in the northeastern quarter date from the 1st century, 
and those around the forum from the 2nd century. 
After Rome withdrew from Mauretania in the 3rd  
century, the city declined. It was inhabited by Christians 
but had been Islamicized when Idriss I arrived in 788.

Oil Press
The reconstruction of an  
oil press near the House of 
Orpheus shows how this 
device worked in Roman 
times. The olives were 
crushed in a cylindrical vat  
by the action of a millstone 
fixed to a vertical axis. The 
resulting pulp was emptied 
into rush or esparto baskets 
laid beneath planks of wood 
on which pressure was  
exerted by means of a beam 
that acted as a lever. The oil 
ran out along channels and 
into purification tanks set  
up outside. Water poured  
into the tanks forced the  
The House of Orpheus
Located in the southern  
quarter of the city, the House 
of Orpheus is remarkable not

slightly sunken square pool 
that is decorated with a mosaic

is paved with the Orpheus 
Mosaic, the largest of the  
circular mosaics that have 
been discovered in Volubilis. 
A richly dressed Orpheus is 
depicted charming a lion, an 
elephant and other animals 
with his lyre. The house also 
has an oil press with  
purification tanks, as well as 
private areas. These have  
further rooms paved with 
mosaics in geometric patterns 
and bath suites with hypo-
causts (underfloor heating).
The ancient site of Volubilis was known from the  
18th century, but it was not until the late 19th  
century that it was first investigated. Excavations 
resumed in 1915, and have continued almost uninter-
rupted since, although extensive areas still remain to 
be investigated. Although Volubilis is not as large as 
some other Roman towns, it shows how thoroughly 
romanized Mauretania Tingitana had become. This is 
seen in the public buildings and sophisticated town 
houses within the 2nd-century walls, which enclose an 
area of more than 400,000 sq m (99 acres). The site, a 
pre-existing settlement on which the Romans imposed 
their way of life, features baths, oil presses, bakeries, 
aqueducts, drains and shops that evoke the inhabitants’ 
daily lives. Well signposted, Volubilis is easy to explore.

Like the other major public

forum dates from the early

point of public life and 
administration, as well as a 
meeting place where business 
was done. It is continued on

emblem of victory, flutters  
in the background, behind 
the horseman.
House of the Dog and House 
of the Ephebe
The House of the Dog, behind 
the triumphal arch on the 
western side, is laid out to a 
typical Roman plan. A double 
doorway opens onto a lobby 
leading through to the atrium. 
This room, which is lined on 
three sides by a colonnade, 
contains a pool and leads in 
turn to a large dining room, or 
triclinium. In 1916, a bronze 
statue of a dog (see p79) was 
discovered in one of the 
rooms off the triclinium.
 Opposite the House 
of the Dog stands  
the House of the 
Ephebe, where a 
beautiful statue of 
an ivy-wreathed 
ephebe (youth in 
military training) was 
found in 1932. It is 
now in the Musée 
Archéologique in 
Rabat (see pp78–9).
Triumphal Arch and 
Decumanus Maximus
According to the inscription 
that it bears, the triumphal 
arch was erected in AD 217 by 
the governor Marcus Aurelius 
Sebastenus in honour of  
Caracalla and his mother Julia 
Domna. The statues that  
originally filled the niches in 
the arch were surmounted  
by busts of Caracalla and his 
mother within medallions. 
Above the inscription, at the 
top of the monument, ran  
a frieze and a band, and the 
whole was crowned by a 
chariot drawn by six horses.
 The arch, which stands over 
8 m (26 ft) high, was recons-
tructed in 1933. It faces west 
onto the plain and east onto 
the decumanus maximus. 
This main axis through the 
city, 400 m (1,312 ft) long  
and 12 m (39 ft) wide, leads 
from the triumphal arch in  
the southwest to the gateway 
known as Tangier Gate in  
the northeast.
 Parallel with the decumanus 
maximus, and a few metres 
away on its southern side,  
ran an aqueduct, substantial 
parts of which survive. This 
brought water from the Aïn 
Ferhana, a spring 1 km (0.6 
mile) east-southeast of Volu-
bilis, on Jbel Zerhoun, to the 
city’s baths and fountains. The 
largest of these fountains can 
be seen between the basilica 
and the triumphal arch.
Aristocratic Quarter
Fine houses, such as the  
elegant House of the  
Columns, House of the Knight 
and House of the Labours of 
Hercules, constituted the  
aristocratic quarter. The 
House of Dionysus and  
the Four Seasons, and the 
House of the Bathing 
Nymphs, have high-quality 
mosaics. The Gordian 
Palace, named after 
Emperor Gordian III 
(238–44) and  
probably the  
residence of the 
Roman governor,  
is notable for the  
12 columns that  
front it and the 
horseshoe-shaped 
pool with almost 
perfectly semicircular outlines.
Cortège of Venus
Busts of Cato the Younger 
(see p79) and Juba II were 
found south of the decumanus. 
The mosaic depicting the 
Cortège of Venus, which 
paved the triclinium, is dis-
played in the Museum of 
Moroccan Crafts and Antiquities 
in Tangier (see pp132–3). 
Some of the mosaics have 
motifs very similiar to those 
seen in Berber carpets today.
Autumn, from the 
Four Seasons
On the eastern side of the 
forum, a short flight of steps 
and three semicircular arches 
leads into the basilica. This 
was the meeting place of the 
curia (senate), as well as the 
commercial exchange and  
tribunal, and somewhere to 
take a stroll. On the capitol, 
south of the basilica, public 
rites in honour of Jupiter, 
Juno and Minerva were 
performed.
House of the Athlete
The athlete that gives this 
house its name is the  
desultor, or chariot jumper, 
who took part in the Olympic 
Games. He would leap from 
his horse or his chariot in the

The Cascades d’Ouzoud, a spectacular waterfall in the Middle Atlas
The mountains of the Middle Atlas are 
traversed by one of the main routes 
through to southern Morocco, running 
from Fès to the Tafilalt. Unless they 
take their time, travellers on this road 
will remain sadly ignorant of the 
beauty and serenity of the 
region’s landscapes.
This mountain chain north-
east of the Atlas is  
350 km (217 miles) long, 
and is delimited on its 
eastern side by Tazzeka 
National Park, whose terrain is scarred 
with caves and gorges. South of Sefrou, 
forests of cedar, holm-oak and cork 
oak form a patchwork with the bare 
volcanic plateaux and small lakes  
brimming with fish.
The Oum er-Rbia rises in the heart of 
the mountains. The longest river in 
Morocco, it runs for 600 km (375 miles) 
before reaching the Atlantic.
To the west, the  
Middle Atlas abuts the 
foothills of the High 
Atlas. Here, the  
Cascades d’ Ouzoud 
crash down 100 m (328 ft) to 
the bottom of a natural chasm 
wreathed in luxuriant vegetation. 
Nicknamed the Switzerland of 
Morocco, the Middle Atlas also features 
some exquisitely scenic small towns at 
mid-altitude. Ifrane, which has stone-
built chalets with red-tiled roofs, 
Azrou, a resort on the slopes of a cedar 
plantation, and Imouzzer du Kandar 
are among the most attractive; they also 
serve as bases for hikes and tours in 
the mountains. A tour of the lakes takes 
in the wild and arid mountain land-
scape, which is populated only by 
Berbers. Forest roads darkened by 
towering stands of cedar are patrolled 
by peaceable macaques.
MIDDLE ATLAS
A 
wild region of rare beauty, the Middle Atlas is surprisingly 
 little visited. The great cedar forests that cover the mountain 
 sides between deep valleys stretch as far as the eye can see. 
Bordered by the fertile plain of the Saïs and the cities of Fès and 
Meknès, the mountainous heights of the Middle Atlas are the territory 
of Berber tribes, whose population is thinly scattered in the area.

Exploring the Middle Atlas
 A varied landscape characterizes the Middle Atlas. The 
eastern part receives scant rainfall and is thus only sparsely 
covered with vegetation, but above the deep valleys rise 
Jbel Bou Naceur and Jbel Bou Iblane: reaching a height 
of 3,340 m (10,962 ft) and 3,190 m (10,470 ft) respectively, 
these are the highest peaks of the Middle Atlas. In the thinly 
populated central high plateaux between Azrou and 
Timhadit, lakes (known as  dayet or  aguelmame ) fill the 
craters of extinct volcanoes and are surrounded by forests. 
The western part receives the highest rainfall and arable 
areas have attracted denser populations. Here, plateaux 
and valleys are covered in forests of cedar, cork oak and 
maritime pine. From December, peaks over 2,000 m 
(6,564 ft) are covered with snow. The Middle Atlas is 
the territory of the semi-nomadic Beni M’Gild and Zaïana.

 GETTING AROUND 
 The major roads between Fès 
and Khenifra and between Fès 
and Midelt are in a reasonably 
good state of repair. By 
contrast, the minor roads are 
narrow and the distances that 
they cover are long because 
the terrain is hilly; they can be 
impassable in winter. These 
minor roads are, however, the 
only means of exploring the 
Middle Atlas. In the eastern part 
of the mountains, many tracks 
lead to small isolated lakes.

Taza, between the Rif and the Middle Atlas, on the route towards eastern Morocco
In the middle of a valley of 
almond, cherry and fig trees 
are the Cascades de Ras el-
Oued (falls which only flow 
between November and 
April). The winding road 
crosses the fertile plateau  
of the Chiker, a punch-bowl 
which at certain times of year 
becomes a small lake (dayet) 
fed by underground water.
 Beyond Bab Taka, a moun-
tain pass at an altitude of 
1,540 m (5,054 ft), a narrow 
track leads over 9 km (5.5 
miles) to the summit of Jbel 
Tazzeka. The peak, at an  
altitude of 1,980 m (6,498 ft), 
supports a television mast. 
There is a fine view north 
over the mountains of the Rif, 
west over the plain of Fès  
and south to the higher foot-
hills of the Middle Atlas and 
the snow peaks of the Jbel 
Boulblanc. The road then 
winds through the Wadi Zireg 
gorge. Caves in the cliffs here 
are used by local shepherds.

Located on the route between 
Fès and Oujda, in the lower 
foothills of the Rif and the 
Middle Atlas, the town of 
Taza is a stopping-place that 
seldom figures on the tourist 
route. It is, however, one of 
the oldest towns in Morocco.
 Taza was founded in the 
8th century by the Meknassa, 
a Berber tribe, and was regu-
larly seized by sultans who 
wished to establish their 
authority before going on to 
take Fès. The old town, built 
on a rocky hill, overlooks the 
new town, 3 km (2 miles) 
below, which the French 
began to build in 1920. The  
3-km (2-mile) walls surround-
ing the medina date mostly 
from the 12th century, the 
Almohad period, and were 
restored on several occasions, 
notably by the Merinids in  
the 14th century. Moulay 
Ismaïl, of the Alaouite  
dynasty, embellished the 
town and heightened its  
role as a military stronghold 
on the eastern frontier.
 The Andalusian Mosque, 
with a 12th-century minaret, 
stands at the entrance of the 
medina, from where the main 
street runs through to the 
Grand Mosque. Founded by 
the Almohad sultan Abd el-
Moumen in 1135, this is one 
of the oldest mosques in

Road map E2. 22 km (13.5 miles) 
southwest of Taza.
This natural chasm, which was 
first explored in 1934, is open 
to visitors, although sturdy 
walking boots are necessary. 
A flight of 500 slippery steps 
leads down to the cave. It  
is 180 m (590 ft) deep and 
contains galleries and halls 
filled with fascinating  
stalactites, stalagmites and 
other curious formations. The 
adjacent Chiker Caves are 
open only to speleologists.
The town is bisected 
by Wadi Aggaï, 
which irrigates the 
surrounding fertile 
plain. Four bridges 
link the two parts  
of the town. South  
of the wadi is the 
mellah, the former 
Jewish quarter, a  
district of narrow 
winding streets. 
North of the wadi is 
the old medina, with 
its souks centred 
around the Grand Mosque 
and the zaouia of Sidi Lahcen 
Lyoussi, who became patron 
saint of Sefrou in the 18th 
century. On the north side of 
the town, outside the ramparts, 
is a crafts centre where  
leather goods, pottery and 
wrought-iron items are made.
 The Cherry Festival, marking 
the end of the cherry harvest 
in June, is a major event in 
the town, which is surrounded 
by cherry orchards. The festi-
val goes on for several days, 
and the major event is a grand 
procession marked by the  
coronation of the Cherry Queen. 
Folk dancers and musicians 
from the Middle Atlas, Fès

natural caves in the cliff face 
containing tombs that are 
venerated by Muslims and

Built by the French, the small 
hillside town of Imouzzer du 
Kandar overlooks the Saïss 
plain, which abuts the  
plateaux of the Middle Atlas. 
At an altitude of 1,345 m 
(4,414 ft), the town is  
pleasantly cool in summer, 
providing a welcome respite 
from the heat of Fès and 
Meknès. Many Moroccans 
come here for the weekend.
 The dilapidated kasbah of 
the Aït Serchouchène, where 
the souk takes place, contains 
troglodytic dwellings, of which 
there are many in the region. 
The caves were dug into the 
hillside and, in times gone by, 
protected Berbers from attacks 
by their enemies. Some are 
still inhabited. Steps or just a 
slope lead up to the entrance. 
The openings – no more than 
a small door and a few  
ventilation holes – are small 
so as to keep out the cold, 
and the spartan interiors have 
neither water nor electricity.

_ Cherry Festival (Jun); Moussem

This ancient town has always 
stood in the shadow of Fès, 
the imperial capital. It takes 
its name from the Ahel 
Sefrou, a Berber tribe that 
was converted to Judaism 
2,000 years ago, and that  
was then Islamicized by  
Idriss I in the 8th century.  
In the 12th century, trade 
with the Sahara brought 
Sefrou prosperity. A century 
later, it became home to a 
large colony of Jews who  
had fled from the Tafilalt and 
southern Algeria. In 1950, a 
third of Sefrou’s population 
was Jewish. The majority of 
Jews emigrated to Israel in 
1967, and the town’s popu-
lation is now mostly Muslim.
 Sefrou is surrounded by 
crenellated ramparts pierced 
by nine gates. These ochre 
pisé walls have been restored 
on several occasions.

A shallow bowl surrounded 
by cedar forests, the  
Mischliffen is the crater of an 
extinct volcano. The villages 
here are outnumbered by the 
tents of the shepherds who 
bring their flocks for summer 
grazing. A small winter sports 
resort (also called Mischliffen) 
has also been set up, at an 
altitude of 2,000 m (6,564 ft), 
among the trees. The resort’s 
facilites, which consist of just 
two ski-lifts, are, however, 
relatively basic.
During the Protectorate the 
town became a health resort, 
and highly reputed treatment 
centres are still found here. It 
is also the departure point for 
tours of the cedar forests and 
plateaux. The lakes in the 
vicinity offer fishing for trout, 
pike and roach (a permit is 
compulsory).

Established in 1929 during  
the Protectorate, Ifrane is a 
small, noticeably clean town 
with a European rather than a 
Moroccan character. Located at 
an altitude of 1,650 m (5,415 ft), 
it is cool in summer and may 
be snow-bound from Decem-
ber to March. On the descent 
into the valley, a green-roofed 
palace, the King’s summer 
residence, comes into view. 
Al-Akhawaya University,  
inaugurated by Hassan II  
in 1995, has contributed  
considerably to the 
town’s development.
 Ifrane serves as 
the departure point 
for many tours, 
including a trip  
to the waterfalls 
known as the  
Cascades des 
Vierges, 3 km (2 miles) west 
(follow the signs to Source

of Ifrane, which is surrounded 
by caves and koubbas.

A large outcrop of volcanic 
rock at the entrance to the 
town gave Azrou (meaning 
“rock” in Berber) its name. At 
an altitude of 1,250 m (4102 ft), 
it is located at the 
crossroads of routes 
linking Meknès and 
Erfoud, and Fès 
and Marrakech.
The town nestles 
in the centre of a 
geological basin, 
with Jbel Hebri to 
the southeast. It is circled by a 
dense belt of cedar and holm-
oak, where the Beni M’Gild, 
the most prominent Berber 
tribe in the region, once came 
to spend their summers. 
These nomadic pastoralists 
from the Sahara gradually 
adopted a sedentary lifestyle 
and founded the town.
 Azrou is still a regional mar-
ket town, with a large weekly 
souk. At the crafts centre 
(opposite the police station) 
items made of cedar, thuya, 
walnut and juniper are on 
sale, as are wrought-iron 
objects and the renowned 
carpets, with geometric motifs 
on a red background, made 
by the Beni M’Gild.

Lakes Tour 9
Three attractive lakes – Dayet Aoua, Dayet Ifrah  
and Dayet Hachlaf – lie 9 km (6.5 miles) south of 
Imouzzer du Kandar. A turning off road N8 leads to 
Dayet Aoua, which formed in a natural depression. 
The narrow road running along it leads to Dayet 
Ifrah, surrounded by a cirque of mountains, and on 
to Dayet Hachlaf. Beyond a forestry hut, a track on 
the right leads to the Vallée des Roches (Valley of 
the Rocks). Ducks, grey herons, cranes, egrets, birds 
of prey and dragonflies populate these arid expanses.
Dayet Aoua 1
This lake sits in a 
natural depression 
surrounded by hills. 
It sometimes remains 
dry for several years 
in a row and this is 
due to persistent 
drought and the fact 
that the water table 
has been tapped to 
irrigate orchards in 
the area.
Dayet Ifrah 3
Surrounded by a natural 
amphitheatre of hills, this is 
one of the largest lakes in the 
area. Shepherds set up their 
tents on the lakeshore, and 
two hamlets face each other 
across the water, their white 
minarets rising up into the sky.
Vallée des Roches 4
A track on the right, 
beyond the forestry hut, 
leads to these outcrops  
of limestone, strangely 
shaped by erosion, and  
to caves inhabited by bats.

Continuing along track P7231 
in the direction of the Ifrane-
Mischliffen road, a rough track 
branching off to the right leads 
to this circle of rocks which, 
shaped by natural forces, 
have the appearance of ruins.
Bird  
sanctuary 2
When the lakes 
are full, the area 
becomes a  
nature reserve for 
many species of 
birds. It attracts waders 
– such as avocets, cattle 
egrets, grey herons and 
crested coots – wildfowl, 
birds of prey – such as  
red kites and kestrels –  
and swallows.

In the folds of the arid hills 
and on the banks of the Oum 
er-Rbia stand houses painted 
in the carmine red that is  
typical of Khenifra. Until the 
17th century, the town was 
the rallying point of the  
Zaïane tribe, which resisted 
attempts by the French to 
pacify the region. In the 18th 
century Moulay Ismaïl asserted 
his authority by building im-
posing kasbahs in which armies 
were garrisoned. The livestock 
market here is one of the few 
interesting aspects of the town.

A winding road runs above 
the valley of the Oum er-Rbia, 
then leads down to the wadi. 
The river’s sources – more 
than 40 springs – form  
cascades that crash down  
the limestone cliffs, joining  
to form the Oum er-Rbia,  
the longest river in Morocco. 
The springs can be explored 
via a footpath.

With Jbel Hayane rising above, 
it is surrounded by rugged hills

THE LIONS OF THE ATLAS
Before World War I, the roaring of lions in the Moroccan 
Atlas could be heard at dusk and during the night. The last 
Atlas lion was killed in 1922. During the Roman period, 
lions were plentiful in North Africa. They flourished in 
Tunisia as recently as the 17th century, although by 1891 
not one remained. In Algeria, the last lion was killed in 
1893, about 100 km (60 miles) south of Constantine. The 
lions of the Atlas were large, with a thick mane, which  
was very dark or almost 
black. Because the 
genetic make-up of the 
Atlas lion is known, it 
should be possible to 
bring this extinct sub-
species back to life. 
With this end in view, a 
breeding programme is 
under way, using lions 
bred in circuses and in 
zoos, most particularly 
the zoo in Rabat.

The focal point of this former 
garrison town is, predictably, 
the kasbah, which was built 
by Moulay Ismaïl in the 1600s. 
So as to subdue rebellious 
tribes, Moulay Ismaïl made his 
son governor of the province. 
The latter built a second  
kasbah, contiguous with the 
one that his father had built. 
A double line of walls thus 
surrounds the town, enclosing 
two dilapidated mosques, the 
former governor’s palace and 
grain stores. Below the town, 
a ten-span bridge crosses 
Wadi Oum er-Rbia.
OLIVES AND OLIVE OIL
Olive groves are a common sight around 
Meknès and Beni Mellal and in the Rif. The 
gnarled and knotty olive tree survives in 
poor soil, taking root in rough and uneven 
ground. Olive oil is extracted by time- 
honoured methods. In the autumn, the 
green, black and violet-tinged olives are  
harvested, the mixture of all three  
determining the flavour and aroma of the oil. 
A heavy grindstone turned by donkeys 
grinds the olives, 
crushing both the flesh 
and the kernel. The 
resulting dark-hued 
pulp is emptied into 
large, shallow, circular 
porous containers 
placed beneath the oil 
press. The oil seeps out 
and runs into vats, where, mixed with water, it floats to the surface, 
free of debris. A whole 5 kg (11 lb) of olives makes just 1 litre  
(1.76 pints) of oil. On the colourful stalls in the souks, the different 
kinds of olives are piled up into pyramids; there are green olives with 
herbs, violet-hued olives with a sharp taste, piquant olives spiced with 
red peppers, olives with bitter orange, crushed black olives that have 
been sun-dried and steeped in oil, and olives for making tajine.

of all Morocco’s forested areas.
From the high peaks down to altitudes 
above 600 m (1,970 ft), the climate is 
permanently moist. Annual precipitation 
ranges from 650 mm (25 in) in the 
eastern Grand Atlas to over 2 m  
(80 in) in the Rif, and snowfall is  
often heavy. The vegetation in this 
band is particularly luxuriant, and many forests 
thrive in this well-watered environment. These 
consist mostly of cedar, cork oak, deciduous  
oak, evergreen holm-oak and, in the Rif,  
Moroccan pine.

The argan (see p127) is  
a small tree that grows  
exclusively in southwestern 
Morocco. Argan nuts are a 
favourite food of goats, which 
climb up into the branches to 
reach them. Oil extracted from 
the kernels is used in foods, in 
cosmetics and as a tonic.
Forests of Atlas cedar are impressive for 
their sheer size, and the trees for their beauty, 
their majestic appearance and their height, 
which can exceed 50 m (164 ft).
Aleppo pine, which grows  
naturally in the mountains, is 
planted almost everywhere since  
its timber is used for a wide range 
of purposes.
Wild olive can be

They include the golden eagle, 
Bonelli’s eagle, bald eagle, the 
huge lammergeier, Egyptian  
vulture, partridge, Moussier’s  
redstart and the rare crimson-
winged finch, which nests only at 
altitudes above 2,800 m (9,190 ft).
HIGH-ALTITUDE VEGETATION
At altitudes above 2,700 m (8,860 ft), the  
mountains consist of cold and arid steppe, which 
is often covered in snow. No trees grow here but 
there are abundant streams. The low-growing 
vegetation, including some endemic 
species, is varied and forms  
a covering of spiny, 
cushion-like clumps.

The holy town of Boujad, 
which is filled with koubbas 
(tombs) and shrines, is set  
in the Tadla plain, on the  
caravan route that once ran 
between Marrakech and Fès. 
It was established in the 16th 
century by Sidi Mohammed 
ech-Cherki, patron saint of 
Tadla, who built an important 
zaouia here. The saint and 
his descendants, bearers of 
baraka (blessing, luck or 
good fortune) from one  
generation to the next, have 
always been highly venerated 
by the Beni Meskin and  
Seguibat, local Berber  
tribespeople. In 1785,  
sultan Sidi Mohammed ben 
Abdallah, who was resentful 
of this power, razed the town, 
including the zaouia. The 
latter was rebuilt in the 19th 
century and is still inhabited 
by the saint’s descendants.
 The tombs of the saintly 
dynasty can be seen around 
the market square in the north 
of the town. The largest, the 
Koubba of Sidi Othman, is 
open to visitors. There are 
many other mausoleums here, 
most notably that of the sheik 
Mohammed ech-Cherki, which 
is closed to non-Muslims. On 
a promontory outside Boujad, 
in the direction of Oued Zem 
on the northern side of the 
town, stand five white koubbas, 
to which crowds of pilgrims 
come for annual gatherings.

The modern town of Beni 
Mellal lies at the foot of the 
Middle Atlas, on the edge  
of the great Tadla plain, 
where cereals are ex-
tensively cultivated. 
Although it is devoid 
of any obvious  
appeal, it is still  
a convenient  
stopping-place.
 Inhabited by  
Berbers and Jews 
well before the arrival 
of Islam, the town 
was known succes-
sively as Day, Kasba  
Belkouche and Beni Mellal.  
In the 13th century, it stood 
on the border between the 
kingdoms of Fès and  
Marrakech, which were  
the object of bitter dispute 
between the Merinid and 
Almohad dynasties. In 1680 
Moulay Ismaïl built a kasbah 
here, which was restored on 
several occasions.
 The town is surrounded by 
orange groves (oranges from 
Beni Mellal are renowned), 
and olive groves stretch to  
the horizon. Beetroot and 
sugarcane have replaced 
bananas as cultivated crops. 
All are unusually well  
watered thanks to the

The Bin el-Ouidane reservoir, at the foot of the High Atlas
here is 285 m (935 ft) long 
and 133 m (436 ft) high and 
the reservoir, with a surface 
area of 380,000 sq m (94 
acres), is the largest lake  
in Morocco. Fed by Wadi  
el-Abid and Wadi Ahansalt,  
it irrigates the intensively  
culvitated Tadla plain, while 
the hydroelectric generator 
provides a quarter of  
Morocco’s electricity. The  
turquoise waters of the lake, 
which are broken by spits of 
land and small islands, are 
surrounded by red hills,  
and the lakeshore is dotted 
with a few isolated houses.
 Watersports and fishing  
are permitted on the lake  
and Wadi el-Abid is suitable 
for kayaking and rafting in 
spring, when the water level 
is sufficiently high. A track 
leading from the lake ends  
at a rock formation known as 
La Cathédrale. This rock, with 
a covering of red soil and a 
setting among Aleppo pines, 
is well known to abseilers.

The garden of the Villa Majorelle
Marrakech was founded in 1062 by 
Almoravids from the Sahara. These 
warrior monks soon carved out an 
empire that stretched from Algiers to 
Spain. In 1106, Ali ben Youssef hired 
craftsmen from Andalusia to build  
a palace and a mosque in the 
capital. He also raised ram-
parts around the city and 
installed khettaras (under-
ground canals), an inge-
nious irrigation system 
that brought water to its 
great palm grove.
The Almohads took the city in 1147. 
Abd el-Moumen built the Koutoubia, 
a masterpiece of Moorish architecture, 
and his successor was responsible for 
building the kasbah. But the Almohad 
dynasty collapsed, to the benefit of the 
Merinids of Fès, and 
for over 200 years 
Marrakech stagnated. 
It was not until the 
16th century that the 
city was reinvigorated by 
the arrival of the Saadians, 
most notably by the wealthy 
Ahmed el-Mansour. The Saadian 
Tombs, the Ben Youssef Medersa 
and the remains of the Palais el-Badi 
mark this golden age. In 1668,  
Marrakech fell to the Alaouites, who 
made Fès, then Meknès, their capital.
In the 20th century, Marrakech 
embraced the modern age with the 
creation of the Quartier Guéliz, built 
during the Protectorate. Visitors conti-
nue to flock to this magical city, and 
tourism is central to its economy today.

S
uch is the importance of Marrakech that it gave its name to 
Morocco. For more than two centuries, this Berber city at the 
point of interchange between the Sahara, the Atlas and the  
Anti-Atlas was the hub of a great empire, and the achievements of 
illustrious builders can be seen within the city’s walls. It is the capital 
of the great South and, although it is now only Morocco’s third city 
after Casablanca and Rabat, its fabulous palaces and luxuriant palm 
grove continue to hold a powerful fascination for visitors.

Exploring Marrakech
The rich history of Marrakech is reflected in  
its various quarters. The medina, above which 
rises the minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque, the 
emblem of the city, corresponds to the old town. 
Place Jemaa el-Fna, the hub of all activity, is  
its heart. Within the ramparts are the souks 
(north of Place Jemaa el-Fna), the kasbah  
and the mellah (the Jewish quarter). Guéliz, 
in the northwest, is the new town 
laid out by Marshal Lyautey under 
the Protectorate. It is filled with  
Western-style offices, businesses and a 
residential area. Avenue Mohammed V 
is the district’s main thoroughfare. 
Extending Guéliz in the southwest  
is Hivernage, a verdant quarter with 
many hotels that also dates from the 
Protectorate. The district is bordered 
on its western side by the Menara 
Gardens, and on its eastern side  
by the walls of the medina.

GETTING 
AROUND
The only way 
to explore the 
souks and the 
medina is on 
foot. The ramparts 
and most other  
features of interest to 
visitors can be reached 
by car, though parking 
can be difficult. A very 
pleasant and inexpensive 
way of travelling around the 
city is by yellow petit taxi or 
horse-drawn carriage. It is wise  
to agree in advance the fare for  
your journey. Petits taxis and carriages 
can be hired mainly in Guéliz (on Avenue 
Mohammed V, near the central market and the 
large hotels) and around Place Jemaa el-Fna, 
near the central police station.

Rue Amesfah, near the Mosque of 
Ben Youssef.
As its name – meaning  
“Drink and Admire” –  
suggests, this Saadian fount- 
ain is one of the most beauti- 
ful in the medina. It was built 
during the reign of Ahmed  
el-Mansour (1578–1603), and 
it is shaded by a carved cedar 
awning with coloured zellij 
tilework and inscriptions in 
cursive and Kufic script 
engraved into the wood.
 In a town like Marrakech, 
located at the head of pre-
Saharan valleys, water was  
a very precious commodity. 
An underground network  
of channels supplied the 
mosques and the houses and 
fed the fountains. Obeying 
the precepts of the Koran, 
according to which water 
must be given to the thirsty, 
many of the leading citizens 
of Marrakech financed the 
building of fountains.

From Bab el-Khemis, Rue  
Sidi Rhalem leads to the

sanctuary is a focal point for 
the pilgrimage of the Regraga 
(the Seven Saints), which was 
instituted by Moulay Ismaïl so 
as to obtain forgiveness for 
his depredations in Marrakech.
 Sidi bel Abbès (1130–1205) 
is the city’s most highly  
venerated patron saint. A  
disciple of the famous Cadi 
Ayad, he devoted his life to 
preaching and to caring for

North of the medina (near Rue Dar

Pilgrimage on Fri.
After Bab Taghzout, if  
you follow Rue de Bab 
Taghzout, then take the 
first right, and then go right 
again, you will reach this 
zaouia, which also features 
in the Regraga pilgrimage 
(see p38). The mausoleum 
dates from the Saadian  
period and was remodelled 
in the late 18th century  
during the reign of Sidi 
Mohammed ben Abdallah.
Sidi Mohammed ben  
Slimane el-Jazouli, another 
venerated mystic, founded 
Moroccan Sufism in the  
15th century. Under the 
Wattasids, this religion 
spread to every level of the 
population. A champion of 
the holy war against the  
Portuguese and a politically 
influential figure, this holy 
man attracted thousands of 
followers; his reputedly occult 
powers even worried the sultan.
South of the zaouia is the  
El-Mjadlia Souk, the Passe-
menterie Souk, built in a  
covered alley during the  
reign of Sidi Mohammed ben 
Abderrahman, at the end of 
the 19th century. Going from 
here towards the centre of the 
medina, you will pass Bab 
Taghzout, an Almoravid gate 
that has been integrated into 
the surrounding architecture.
and defending the weak and 
the blind. Because of him, it 
was said throughout Morocco 
that Marrakech was the only 
city where a blind man could 
eat his fill. To this day, the 
gifts of pilgrims are distributed 
to the poor and the blind.
 In 1605, the Saadian sultan 
Abou Faris raised a mauso-
leum for the saint in the  
hope of curing his epilepsy. 
Moulay Ismaïl added a dome 
in the 18th century and the 
mausoleum was given its 
present appearance by Sidi 
Mohammed ben Abdallah a 
few years later.
 The zaouia also includes a 
mosque, a hammam, a home 
for the blind, a small market, 
an abattoir and a cemetery.

The Ramparts of Marrakech
Skirting the Guéliz and Hivernage 
quarters on their eastern side, the  
ramparts completely encircle the  
medina. From the time of its founda-
tion, Marrakech was defended by  
sturdy walls set with forts. Although 
their outline has hardly altered from 
the time of the Almoravids, they were 
extended to the south by the Almohads 
and to the north by the Saadians in  
the 16th century. These pisé walls are 
19 km (12 miles) long, up to 2 m (6 ft) 
thick and up to 9 m (30 ft) high. Some 
of the monumental gates that pierce 
them are very fine examples of Moorish 
architecture. The best time to walk 
around the ramparts is in the early 
morning or just before sunset. Their 
warm ochre colour changes according 
to the time of day and the intensity of 
the light. In the evening, they take on 
an almost rust-coloured hue.
THE GATES
Bab Aghmat and Bab Aylen, 
on the eastern side of the 
ramparts, date from the 12th 
century, and are relatively 
plain. Bab ed-Debbagh, dating 
from the same period, opens 
onto the tanners’ quarter.
On the northern side stands 
Bab el-Khemis and on the 
southern, Bab el-Robb (1308). 
The latter takes its name from 
a grape liqueur in which the 
city once did a brisk trade. 
Bab el-Jedid, on the western 
side, leads to La Mamounia 
hotel (see p234).
Bab el-Khemis was remodelled after  
the Almoravid period (1147–1269).  
An open-air market is held outside the 
gate on Thursdays. The tomb of the 
Seven Saints is a small dome-topped 
building dedicated to a marabout.
These lower pisé walls, which are just high enough to 
close a harem off from a house or a garden, or to shield 
a sanctuary from prying eyes, were not built for  
defensive purposes.
The ramparts of Marrakech, 
which date from the 12th century, 
are the most impressive city walls 
in Morocco. The well-preserved 
defences encircle the old town, 
with its palaces and gardens.
Bab Agnaou (see p239), whose 
name is derived from the Berber 
for “hornless black ram”, is one 
of the finest gates in Marrakech. 
It is carved in an ochre stone 
with tinges of pink. It once led 
into the Almohad palace.

The Souks 8
The souks of Marrakech are among the  
most fascinating in the Maghreb.  
Arranged according to the individual 
nature of the goods on offer, they are laid 
out in the narrow streets north and east of 
Place Jemaa el-Fna. On the map shown 
here, the area marked in orange denotes the historic 
heart of the souks, which stretches from the Ben 
Youssef Mosque in the north to the Souk Smarine in 
the south. Many of the souks are known by the name 
of whatever is sold here. Today a very wide range of 
goods, from fabric to jewellery and slippers, is on  
offer. Leatherwork is particularly prominent. Around 
this commercial hub are the crafts traditionally  
associated with country people, such as blacksmithing, 
saddle-making and basketry. Because of rank odours, 
the tanneries are banished to the edge of the city.

Zellij tilework in the Ben Youssef Medersa
Musée de 
Marrakech 5
Place ben Youssef. Tel (0524) 44 18 
93. # 9am–6pm daily. &
This museum is laid out in 
the Dar Menebhi, a palace 
built at the end of the 19th 
century by the grand vizier of 
Sultan Moulay Mehdi Hassan. 
The building is in the style of 
a traditional Moorish house.
 The decorated door – 
which, as in many Moorish 
houses, is the only opening  
in the otherwise featureless 
external walls – leads through 
to an open courtyard with 
zellij tilework and three 
marble basins in the centre. 
The courtyard gives access  
to the rooms on the ground 
and upper floors.
 The museum’s collection is 
displayed in two wings. One 
contains contemporary art, 
Orientalist paintings and a 
series of original engravings 
of Moroccan subjects.
 The second wing contains  
a rather haphazard display  
of objects: coins from the 
Idrissid period of the 9th  
century to that of the Alaouites 
in the present day; illumina-
ted copies of the Koran, 
including a 12th-century  
Chinese example and a 19th-
century book of Sufi prayers; 
southern Moroccan jewellery; 
Tibetan dress, 17th- and 18th-
century ceramics; and some 
fine decorated Berber doors.
praising Moulay Abdallah. 
The mihrab is decorated with 
verses from the Koran in  
calligraphic script and is lit  
by 24 windows decorated 
with a tracery of plasterwork.
Ben Youssef 
Medersa 4
Place ben Youssef (in the medina). 
Tel (0524) 44 18 93. # 9am–6pm 
daily. &
This Koranic school is not 
only one of the finest but  
also one of the largest in the 
Maghreb, with a capacity for 
up to 900 students.
 It was founded 
by the Merinid 
sultan Abou el-
Hassan in the 
mid-14th  
century, and was 
rebuilt by the 
Saadian sultan 
Moulay Abdallah 
in the 16th  
century. This 
fact is recorded 
by the inscrip-
tions carved into 
the lintel above 
the entrance, 
together with 
the date, 1564.
 The medersa takes its name 
from the Almoravid mosque 
of Ali ben Youssef to which  
it was once attached. For four 
centuries this mosque was  
the focal point of worship  
in the medina, and with the 
medersa it constituted an 
important centre of religion.
 Architecturally, and with  
its sumptous decoration, it  
is on a par with the Merinid 
medersas, particularly the  
Bou Inania Medersa of Fès 
(see pp172–3). By building 
it, Moulay Abdallah was 
expressing his desire to 
restore to Marrakech the  
Zellij tilework in the courtyard of 
the Musée de Marrakech
prestige of an imperial capital 
and simultaneously to affirm 
his devotion to Allah.
 Covering an area of some 
1,720 sq m (18,514 sq ft), this 
harmoniously proportioned 
medersa appears as it was 
originally designed, with no 
later alteration. The dome, 
decorated with exquisite  
stalactites within, can be seen 
from the street. The main 
entrance, a bronze door 
topped by a 
carved cedar 
lintel, opens 
onto a mosaic-
paved corridor, 
which in turn 
leads to the 
courtyard. This 
masterpiece of 
Moorish design 
is paved with 
white marble 
and has an 
ablutions pool 
in the centre. 
The walls are 
decorated with 
zellij tilework 
below and carved plaster 
above. A double tier of  
galleries supported on thick 
columns lines both sides of 
the courtyard. The students’ 
cells on the ground and 
upper floors opened onto  
the courtyard. Those that are 
shielded from daylight are 
arranged around seven  
smaller interior courtyards.
 A magnificently ornate 
doorway leads through to the 
large prayer hall. The room  
is crowned by a pyramidal 
cedar dome and divided into

This brick-built dome is the 
only example of Almoravid 
architecture in Marrakech. 
Built by Ali ben Youssef in 
1106, originally it formed part 
of a richly decorated mosque 
that was demolished by the 
Almohads. Miraculously 
spared, the rectangular pavi-
lion was rediscovered in  
1948. It contained an ablu-
tions pool fed by three reser-
voirs. While the exterior is 
decorated with chevrons and 
pointed arches in relief, the 
interior is graced by scalloped 
and horseshoe arches and  
floral ornamentation. These 
elements anticipate the full-
blown artistic creativity of 
Islamic architecture.
AVERROËS
Born in Córdoba in 1126, Averroës (Ibn Rushd) was one of 
the most renowned Muslim scholars of his day. Like other 
men of learning at the time, his knowledge encompassed 
medicine, law, philosophy, astronomy and theology. Born 
into an important Cordoban family, he was the grandson  
of an imam at the Great Mosque in Granada. Under the 
patronage of Abou Yacoub Youssef, Averroës divided his 
time between Seville, Córdoba and 
Marrakech. He took the place of his 
friend and teacher, the famous  
physician Abubacer (Ibn Tufayl). 
Basing his approach on his own 
reading of Aristotle, he promoted a 
rationalist, rather than an esoteric, 
interpretation of the Koran. This 
brought him condemnation from 
Córdoba. However, he was soon 
rehabilitated by the Almohad 
ruler Yacoub el-Mansour, who 
gave him asylum in Marrakech 
until his death in December 1198.

 The minaret, which is 
crowned by a gallery with 
merlons, is of strikingly  
simple design. The adjacent 
Mouassine Fountain consists 
of three large drinking 
troughs for animals and a 
fourth for people. The  
fountain is enclosed within  
a portico with decorative  
stuccowork and carved  
wooden lintels.

East of Gueliz (off the southern 
extremity of Avenue Mohammed V).
For centuries, this unique and 
extraordinary square has been 
the nerve centre of Marrakech 
and the symbol of the city. 
Although it is in fact no more 
than an irregular space 
devoid of a harmonious 
ensemble of buildings, it is  
of interest to visitors mainly 
because it is a show-
case of traditional 
Morocco. UNESCO 
has declared it a 
World Heritage Site.
 It has a gruesome 
past: until the 19th 
century, criminals 
on whom the 
death sentence 
had been passed 
were beheaded 
here. Sometimes 
up to 45 people were exe-
cuted on a single day, their 
heads being pickled and sus-
pended from the city gates.
 No traces are left of this 
today. A large market is held 
in the mornings, and medicinal 
plants, freshly squeezed orange 
juice as well as all kinds of 
nuts and confectionery.
 From sunset, the life and 
bustle on the square reaches 
its peak. It becomes the arena 
of a gigantic, multifaceted 
open-air show. As the air fills 
with smoke from grilling meat 
and the aroma of spices, the 
square fills with musicians, 
dancers, storytellers, show-
men, tooth-pullers, fortune-
tellers and snake-charmers, 
who each draw a crowd of 
astonished onlookers.

This palace, whose name 
means “Palace of the  
Favourite”, was built by two 
powerful grand viziers – Si 
Moussa, vizier of Sultan Sidi 
Mohammed ben Abder-
rahman, and his son Ba 
Ahmed, vizier of Moulay 
Abdelaziz – at the end of  
the 19th century.
 The palace complex con-
sists of two parts, each built 
at different times. The older 
part, built by Si Moussa, con-
tains apartments arranged 
around a marble-paved court-
yard. It also has an open 
courtyard with cypresses, 
orange trees and jasmine, 
with two star-shaped pools.
 The newer part, built by  
Ba Ahmed, is a huge palace 
without a unified plan. It  
consists of luxurious  
apartments looking onto 
courtyards planted with trees. 
So as to make it easier for the 
obese master of the house to 
move around, almost all the 
apartments were located on 
the ground floor. The main

marble and zellij tilework. It 
is surrounded by a gallery of 
finely fluted columns, while 
three fountains with bowls 
stand in the centre. This 
courtyard, once used by the 
viziers’ concubines, faces the 
main reception room. It has  
a cedar ceiling painted with 
arabesques. The decoration  
of the palace apartments  
and of the council chamber  
is equally splendid.
 Ba Ahmed hired the best 
craftsmen in the kingdom  
to build and decorate this  
palace. It is decked out with 
highly prized materials, such 
as marble from Meknès,  
cedar from the Middle Atlas 
and tiles from Tetouan. Not 
surprisingly, Marshal Lyautey 
chose to live here during  
the Protectorate.
 Maison Tiskiwin, at No. 8 
Rue de la Bahia, houses the 
Bert Flint Museum. This 
charming residence with a 
courtyard is an example of  
a traditional 19th-century  
Marrakech house. Here, Bert 
Flint, a Dutch anthropologist 
who fell in love with Morocco 
and settled here in the 1950s, 
amassed a collection of folk art 
and artifacts from the Souss 
valley and the Saharan region 
(see pp283–96). Exhibits 
include jewellery and daggers 
from the Anti-Atlas, pottery 
from the Rif and carpets from

on 4 August 1578 (see p52), 
Ahmed el-Mansour, “the 
Golden”, ordered a luxurious 
palace to be built near his  
private apartments. It was to 
be used for receptions and 
audiences with foreign em-
bassies. Its construction was 
financed by the Portuguese 
whom he had defeated in  
battle, and work continued 
until his death in 1603.

This splendid tower in pink

is 70 m (230 ft) high and 
its proportions obey the 
canons of Almohad archi-
tecture: its height equals 
five times its width.
Detail of the East  
Side of the Minaret
Each side of the minaret 
has a different decorative 
scheme. Common to all, 
with variations, are floral 
motifs, inscriptions, bands 
of moulded terracotta and, 
as here, windows with  
festooned arches.
Entrance to the  
Koutoubia Courtyard
This restrained and simple 
entrance follows the design of 
most gateways to important 
Moroccan buildings: a  
horseshoe arch with  
moulded arcature.
The interior of  
the minaret 
contains six 
superimposed 
rooms.
In about 1147, to mark his victory over the Almoravids, 
the Almohad sultan Abd el-Moumen set about building 
one of the largest mosques in the Western Muslim world. 
The minaret, a masterpiece of Islamic architecture, was 
completed during the reign of Yacoub el-Mansour, grand-
son of Abd el-Moumen. It later served as the model for 
the Giralda in Seville, as well as for the Hassan Tower in 
Rabat (see p76). The “Booksellers’ Mosque” takes its name 
from the manuscripts souk that once took place around it. 
The interior of the minaret contains a ramp used to carry 
building materials up to the summit. The mosque has been 
restored to reveal the original pink colour of the brickwork.

Kasbah Mosque y
Rue de la Kasbah, near Bab Agnaou. 
¢ to non-Muslims.
Built by Yacoub el-Mansour 
(1184–99), the Kasbah 
Mosque is the only other 
Almohad building besides 
Bab Agnaou to survive in 
Marrakech. Its distinctive  
minaret, a beautiful stone  
and brick construction in 
shades of ochre, was used  
as a model by later builders. 
Successive remodelling in the 
16th and 17th centuries has 
robbed the mosque of its 
original appearance. Even  
so, it is not without interest.
 Built to a rectangular plan, 
77m (253 ft) long by 71 m 
(233 ft) wide, the mosque 
consists of a prayer hall and 
five interior courtyards sepa-
rated by arcades. The 80-m 
(263-ft) long façade is topped 
by crenellations and denti-
culate merlons. According to 
Almohad custom, the minaret 
is devoid of ornamentation  
up to the height of the walls. 
Above this, it has restrained 
decoration and is crowned  
by an attractive terracotta 
frieze. Turquoise tiles  
moulded with a magnificent 
pattern of interlaced lozenges 
almost completely cover the 
four faces of the minaret.
 Two-fifths of the tower  
are taken up by the lantern, 
which is crowned by three 
spheres. These are made of 
brass, but legend has it that 
they are made of gold, hence 
their popular name, the  
Golden Apples.

Although they were neglected 
for more than two centuries, 
the tombs of the Saadian 
dynasty constitute some of 
the finest examples of Islamic 
architecture in Morocco. Their 
style is in complete contrast 
to the simplicity of Almohad 
architecture, as the Saadian 
princes lavished on funerary 
architecture the same ostenta-
tion and magnificence that 
they gave to other buildings.
 A necropolis existed here 
during the Almohad period 
(1145–1248), continuing in 
use during the reign of the 
Merinid sultan Abou el-Hassan 
(1331–51). The Saadian Tombs 
themselves date from the late 
16th to the 18th centuries. Out 
of respect for the dead, and 
even though he had been at 
pains to erase all traces of his 
predecessors, the Alaouite 
sultan Moulay Ismaïl raised a 
wall round the main entrance.
 It was not until 1917 that 
the tombs were made acces-
sible to the public. They

three funerary rooms laid out

When Sidi Mohammed ben 
Abdallah arrived in Marrakech 
in the 18th century, he found 
the Almohad and Saadian  
palaces in a state of ruin.  
On an extensive area within 
the kasbah that he enclosed 
within bastioned walls, he 
ordered a royal palace,  
Dar el-Makhzen, to be  
built, next to the ruins  
of the Palais el-Badi.
 Sidi Mohammed’s building 
project is notable because, 
unlike the design of other 
palaces in Marrakech, it took 
into account the perspective 
and dimensions of the terrain.
 Restored countless times, 
Dar el-Makhzen consists of 
several groups of buildings: 
the Green Palace (el-Qasr  
el-Akhdar), the Nile Garden 
(Gharsat el-Nil) and the main 
house (el-Dar el-Kubra), as 
well as outbuildings and  
several pavilions (menzah) 
set in the park. The palace is 
still a royal residence today.

remarkable dome with  
stalactites. Of carved cedar 
with gold-leaf decoration, it  
is supported by 12 columns 
of Carrara marble. The walls 
are completely covered – the 
lower part by a graceful inter-
lacing pattern of glazed tiles, 
and the upper part by a  
profusion of stuccowork.
 In the centre of the room  
lie Ahmed el-Mansour and  
his successors. The ivory- 
coloured marble tombstones 
are covered with arabesques 
and inscriptions arranged on 
two levels: above are verses 
from the Koran, and below a 
framed epitaph in verse. The 
third room, known as the  
Hall of the Three Niches,  
has an equally sumptuous 
decorative scheme. It contains 
the tombs of young princes.
 The second mausoleum, a 
green-roofed building, has 
more modest proportions.  
It consists of a room with  
two loggias and a prayer hall. 
A cedar lintel carved with 
inscriptions links the columns 
of the loggias. In the prayer 
hall, the dome hung with  
stalactites is a splendid sight.

gives the gate a dignified and

intricate plasterwork and carved or painted wooden 
domes, the decoration alone is worth the visit.

THE PALACE
Following Islamic tradition, 
the palace is enclosed within 
solid walls and consists of a 
two-storey central building 
arranged around courtyards 
with graceful arcades. It also 
has an Andalusian garden, 
with a pavilion and fountain 
in the centre.
 The sumptuous Reception 
Room on the upper floor is  
a jewel of Moorish design. 
The cedar dome and the 
walls, with zellij tilework  
and a stuccowork frieze,  
are a mesmerizing sight.
 The room contains a wood-
en candelabrum, a cedar sofa 
and benches covered with 
colourful fabric. From the  
topmost floor there is a  
view over the medina and 
towards the High Atlas.
THE COLLECTIONS
Converted into a museum  
in 1932, Dar Si Saïd houses  
a fine collection of carpets, 
doors, chests, weapons, 
ceramics, costume and  
jewellery illustrating the skill 
of the craftsmen of southern 
Morocco, particularly of the 
High Atlas, the Tafilalt, the 
Anti-Atlas, the Souss and  
the Tensift.
 Also on display are a few 
archaeological pieces and 
architectural fragments from 
Fès. The museum’s collections 
are laid out thematically on 
three levels.

doors consist of a single 
panel of oak, almond wood, 
poplar or walnut. Some of 
them are decorated with 
applied relief patterns of 
wood cut to geometrical 
shapes. Others are decorated 
with engraved or  
painted motifs. 
As these doors 
were made by 
craftsmen work-
ing in isolation 
in a rural  
environment,  
they are unique 
pieces, each one 
different from the next.
 At the end of the corridor  
a splendid basin for ritual 
ablutions is on display. The 
basin was carved from a  
single block of marble in 
Andalusia in the late 10th  
or early 11th century. The 
decoration features three  
tiers of ornament: floral 
motifs, four-legged creatures 
and heraldic eagles.
 The next room contains a 
display of antique children’s 
carriages and swings.
JEWELLERY
Located to the left of the 
entrance, the room in which 
jewellery is displayed holds  
a collection of headdresses 
typical of southern Morocco 
as well as earrings, diadems, 
finger rings, necklaces, fibulas 
(pin-like brooches), bracelets 
and anklets.
 These pieces are engraved,

compound) or enamelled, and 
are set with polished gems, 
shells, coral, amber or coins.
 Geometric shapes such  
as rectangles, triangles,  
lozenges, circles, crosses 
and zigzags are the  
principal Berber motifs. 
Some have a symbolic 
meaning: for  
example, motifs 
arranged in sets  
of five refer to  
the fingers of one 
hand, symbolizing 
life, creativity and 
representing a lucky 
charm. Arabesques 
and floral motifs, 
by contrast,  
belong to the  
Moorish canon of 
decorative motifs.
 Mastered by Jewish metal-
workers, these various styles 
led to the creation of  
jewellery inspired both  
by city and rural traditions.
POTTERY
The room on the right  
of the entrance contains a  
display of everyday objects 
consisting mostly of pottery 
from Amizmiz, stone oil 
lamps from Taroudannt, 
amphorae, pitchers, storage 
jars, churns, cooking pots  
and various dishes. These 
pieces, most of which are 
made of terracotta, have 
incised, relief or painted 
decoration.
 
Two major regional 
types of pottery can be 
seen in this room. One  
is from Safi (see p118), 
a continuation of the 
Fassi tradition and 
characterized by 
restrained polychrome 
decoration, often on  
a white ground. The 
other is from Tame-
groute (see p269), 
south of Zagora,  
typified by glazed 
monochrome ware 
in which green 
predominates.
CARPETS
The upper floor is devoted to 
village carpets, most notably 
those from the Tensift and 
Boujad. The display includes 
antique carpets and thick 
woollen blankets (hanbel) 
in which madder-red  
predominates. The latter  
are loosely woven so as  
to retain more warmth.
 The display continues in  
the second courtyard with 
carpets from the High Atlas. 
These include Glaoui and 
Ouaouzguite carpets, which 
are both embroidered, woven 
and knotted and which  
feature bright colours. Carpets 
from Chichaoua, with a red or 
rosewood background, display 
a variety of motifs: geometric 
patterns including zigzags, 
chevrons and squares; animal 
motifs depictings snakes, 
scorpions and camels; and 
motifs derived from everyday 
objects such as teapots and 
combs. Certain motifs are 
based on tribal tattoos.
 The more unusual figure  
of a horseman was brought 
from the Sudan by slaves who 
worked in local plantations.
WOODWORK
The interesting collection of 
woodwork displayed in the 
second courtyard includes 
house doors, house frontages 
and delicate mashrabiyya 
(screenwork), some of it 
painted in bright colours. 
These architectural elements, 
most of them carved in cedar, 
originate from old houses  
and shops in Marrakech.  
The beautiful pieces in wood 
and marble dating from the 
Saadian period (16th century) 
are not to be missed.
COSTUME
The corridor leading to the 
exit contains a display of 
boots and burnouses worn by 
the shepherds of the Siroua 
mountains. Made of black 
wool, they are decorated with 
motifs worked in cotton or in 
silk. Such garments are still 
worn today, although the 
workmanship is less refined.
GALLERY GUIDE
The building has three storeys. The exhibition rooms on  
the ground floor open onto the riad. Beyond the entrance, 
large-scale pieces such as wooden doors and chests are 
displayed. Left of the entrance is the jewellery room, and  
on the right of it are displays of everyday objects. Next 
comes the pottery room. The room at the far end of the 
garden contains brass and copper, and in the second 
courtyard is a display of woodwork. The reception room  
is on the first floor and village carpets on the second. The  
corridor leading to the exit displays the traditional costume 
of the Ouzguita tribe. Changes are currently being made 
to the gallery and some collections may not be on display.

A welcome haven of  
coolness and shade, this 
imperial garden, covering 
almost 90 ha (220 acres) and 
enclosed within pisé walls, 
is filled mostly with olive 
and fruit trees. In the 12th 
century, an enormous pool 
was dug in the centre of  
the garden to serve as a  
reservoir for the Almohad 
sultans. In the 19th century, 
Moulay Abderrahman  
refurbished the garden and 
built the pavilion with a 
green-tiled pyramidal roof. 
This attractive building was 
used by the sultans for their 
romantic meetings. It is said 
that every morning one of 
them would toss into the 
water the concubine that he 
had chosen the night before. 
The ground floor is fronted 
by three arches opening 
onto the pool. The upper 
floor has a large balustered 
balcony on its north side.
 Although the interior  
decoration is plain, the 
building’s overall  
conception and 
location are  
remarkable, and  
the view from any 
point within, with 
the peaks of the 
Atlas as a back-
drop, is quite 
unforgettable.
Alaouite sultans Moulay 
Abderrahman and Sidi 
Mohammed ben Abdallah 
restored the gardens and the 
pavilions. So as to provide 
irrigation, they also  
diverted the course  
of Wadi Ourika. 
Gates were also 
built into the  
surrounding wall.
 While the public 
have free access to 
the gardens, the 
pavilions, on the 
northern side, are  
for the exclusive use 
of the king’s guests. 
Dar el-Hana, the  
largest pool, located south  
of the garden, dates from the 
Almohad period. The terrace 
of the small Saadian pavilion 
that stands next to it  
commands  
stunning views  
in two opposite 
directions:  
northwards across

JACQUES MAJORELLE
The painter Jacques Majorelle 
was born in Nancy, in north-
eastern France, in 1886. The 
son of the renowned cabinet-
maker Louis Majorelle, one of 
the leading figures of the École 
de Nancy, he was raised in the 
artistic milieu of Art Nouveau. 
He seemed destined to follow 
in his father’s footsteps. However, after studying at the 
École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Majorelle decided to devote 
himself to painting. He travelled to Spain, Italy and Egypt. 
Recovering from health problems, he went to Morocco in 
1919 and fell in love with its intense light. Aided by Marshal 
Lyautey, he settled in Marrakech, in his now-famous villa. 
Finding fascination in the souks, kasbahs and villages of 
the High Atlas, he stayed in Morocco until his death in 1962.
La Palmeraie h
On the road to Casablanca, 22 km 
(14 miles) north of Marrakech. This 
interesting tour, 22.5 km (14 miles) 
long, can be made by car or horse-
drawn carriage.
Legend has it that, after  
eating dates brought back 
from the Sahara, the soldiers 
of the 11th-century Almoravid 
sultan Youssef ben Tachfine 
spat out the stones around 
their encampment. The stones 
are supposed to have germi-
nated and led to the creation 
of La Palmeraie (Palm Grove) 
in Marrakech.
 Covering an area of some 
120 sq km (46 sq miles), the 
grove consists of fields, gardens 
and orchards irrigated by 
ditches and wells supplied by 
khettaras. Although it contains 
150,000 trees, the agricultural 
function of the grove is being 
pared away by the advance of 
buildings and the greed of 
developers who are making 
inroads into it by building 
desirable residences here.

This wonderful garden is  
like a small paradise in  
the heart of Ville Nouvelle 
(the new town). In 1923, 
Jacques Majorelle (see above) 
fell in love with Morocco  
and built himself a splendid 
Moorish villa, which he called 
Bou Safsaf, in Marrakech. He 
designed the patterns of the 
zellij tilework, painted the 
front door, and decorated the 
interior in tones of deep blue, 
green and dark red. Around 
the house he laid out a  
Villa Majorelle, the painter’s

La Palmeraie (Palm Grove) in Marrakech, with 150,000 trees

bars, pavement cafés and  
chic shops.
 Despite the number of 
modern buildings, a few  
vestiges of the European 
architecture introduced by  
the French remain. A notable 
example of this style, known 
as “Mauresque”, is the  
Renaissance Café, on Place 
Abdel Moumen ben Ali. It is 
decorated in typical 1950s 
style and has a dining area on 
the top floor with panoramic

Majorelle’s request, the archi-
tect Sinoir built an Art Deco 
studio with pergolas and bright 
blue walls. The garden, which 
is separate from the house, 
opened to the public in 1947.
 The house was later bought 
by Yves Saint-Laurent, the 
famous couturier, and Pierre 
Bergé. Skilfully restored, the 
garden is divided by four 
walkways that cross each 
other to create parterres of 
brightly coloured tropical 
flowers. Besides yucca, bou-
gainvillea, bamboo, laurel, 
geraniums, hibiscus and 
cypresses, the garden has 
over 400 varieties of palm  
tree and 1,800 species of  
cactus. Water lilies grow in a 
pool bordered by papyrus.
 The studio has been con-
verted into a small museum 
that contains a selection of 
Moroccan crafts such as antique 
carpets, Fassi ceramics and 
Berber doors, and some 40 
engravings of the villages and 
kasbahs of the Atlas executed 
by Jacques Majorelle.

Muleteer with heavily laden beast in a village in the High Atlas
Extending from the plains of the  
Atlantic seaboard to Morocco’s border 
with Algeria, the High Atlas forms an 
impregnable barrier some 800 km 
(500 miles) long and, in certain places, 
100 km (60 miles) wide. Consisting 
of great massifs rising to heights 
of 3,000–4,000 m (10,000– 
13,000 ft), and steep valleys, 
desolate rocky plains and 
deep narrow canyons, 
the High Atlas has 
played a decisive role in 
the history of Morocco.
From earliest times these mountains 
have been a place of refuge for  
populations fleeing from invaders. For 
centuries, nomads forced northwards 
by the desertification of the Sahara 
have come into conflict with the  
sedentary mountain-dwelling tribes, 
disputing possession of prized pasture.
This tumultuous feudal past led to the 
development of a  
strikingly beautiful 
form of fortified 
architecture. Today,  
although the Berbers no 
longer need to guard their 
safety, they still live in  
tighremts, old patriarchal houses 
with thick walls. Hamlets built of 
pisé still cling to mountainsides, while 
every last plot of land is used to grow 
barley, corn, maize, turnips, lucerne 
and potatoes – crops that can be  
cultivated at high altitudes. The  
Berbers channel river water to irrigate 
small squares of land and graze their 
flocks of sheep and goats, which they 
raise for milk, butter and wool.
Sometimes isolated by snowfall in 
winter, the Berbers of the High Atlas 
live and work by the seasons, the  
constant round of labour punctuated 
by various festivals.

HIGH ATLAS
L
ittle-known because of its relative inaccessibility, the High Atlas 
makes up the largest massif in the Atlas chain. It is also the 
highest mountain range in North Africa. In this geographical 
isolation Berber culture and identity prospered. Over the centuries, the 
tribes established their own economic and social framework, and a 
unique collective way of life, based on blood ties and solidarity.

Exploring the High Atlas
 Crowned with high peaks, the chain of the High 
Atlas culminates in the west in Jbel Toubkal. At 
4,167 m (13,676 ft), this is the highest peak in North 
Africa, with pisé villages nestling on its lower slopes. 
In the centre, Jbel M’Goun, at 4,068 m (13,351 ft), 
rises over the Tessaout, Aït Bouguemez and Aït Bou 
Oulli valleys. The only channels of communication 
between these valleys are mule trails and high 
passes. On the banks of the  wadi that snakes along 
the valley bottoms, villages cluster around fortified 
houses, punctuating expanses of cultivated land. 
The eastern end of the High Atlas is marked by the 
imposing outline of Jbel Ayachi, 3,737 m (12,265 ft) 
high. Here high desert plateaux stretch to the 
horizon. From late spring to early autumn they 
are filled with flocks of grazing sheep.

 GETTING AROUND 
 With the High Atlas forming 
an imposing east-to-west 
barrier, the most westerly 
north-to-south route in this 
region is the R203. Running 
from Marrakech, it crosses 
the Tizi-n-Test Pass and 
leads to Taroudannt and 
Agadir. South-east of 
Marrakech, another road, 
the N9, via the Tizi-n-Tichka 
Pass, leads to Ouarzazate. 
In the central stretch of the 
mountain chain, there is no 
road over the High Atlas for 
200 km (124 miles). Only 
a track, which is often 
impassable in winter, crosses 
the lake-filled plateau to 
reach the Dadès valley. On 
the eastern side, a road from 
Fès runs along the Middle 
and High Atlas, leading via 
Midelt to the Tafilalt valley.

_ Moussem of Setti Fatma (mid-Aug).
The trip to the Ourika valley, 
68 km (42 miles) southeast of 
Marrakech, offers a pleasant 
tour of the lower foothills of 
the Atlas. Beyond the village 
of Tnine-de-l’Ourika, the 
valley, through which flows 
the Ourika, becomes verdant. 
The largest souk in the valley 
takes place in the village on 
Mondays.
 All along the road that  
follows the course of the 
wadi, small houses, cafés, 
grocery shops and small 
hotels cling to the hillside. 
Gardens and plots of culti-
vated land shaded by many 
fruit trees are laid out along 
the valley bottom. The Ourika 
river is occasionally subject to 
sudden and devastating  
flooding, such as in August 
1995, when many houses 
were swept away.
 Beyond Arhbalou, at an  
altitude of 1,500 m (4,923 ft), 
the valley narrows and gently 
rises. The road comes to an 
end at Setti Fatma, a good 
starting point for hikes. Seven 
waterfalls flow down the 
rocky scree above the village. 
The first of these is easy to 
reach by walking up the 
course of the wadi. The walk 
up to the others is over more 
uneven ground, and some 
climbing is involved, so that 
you will need strong walking 
boots. From that vantage 
point there is a superb  
view over Setti Fatma.
 The village may also be 
used as the starting point for 
longer hikes to Jbel Toubkal 
and Yagour Plateau, whose 
peak is well known for the 
hundreds of rock engravings 
that can be seen here.
 The tomb of Setti Fatma is 
the focus of a moussem that 
takes place in the village in 
mid-August. This religious  
pilgrimage is also an occasion 
when Berbers from a wide 
area can gather together.

A ski resort in winter and 
base for mountain hikes in 
summer, Oukaïmeden is a 
haven of fresh air, just over 
one hour from Marrakech. 
Wadi Ourika, irrigating a valley of 
fruit tree plantations
The resort is easily reached 
on a road that forks off to  
the right at the village of  
Arhbalou, with the Ourika 
valley on the left. Shaded by 
olive, oak and walnut trees, 
the road then winds upwards 
in a series of hairpin bends 
through a stony landscape.
 The chalets and winter 
sports facilities are in the  
village itself, encircled by 
mountain peaks: Jbel Oukaï-
meden, rising to a height of 
3,273 m (10,742 ft), Jbel  
Ouhattar, at 3,258 m (10,693 ft), 
and Jbel Angour, at 3,614 m 
(11,861 ft). The great Oukaï-
meden plateau is carpeted in 
pasture, the grazing of which 
is controlled by tradition.
 From November to April, if 
the snow is sufficiently deep, 
a chair lift – the highest in 
North Africa – runs up to the 
summit of Jbel Oukaïmeden, 
while several ski lifts allow 
beginners to practise on the 
lower slopes. The resort also 
offers long-distance and 
cross-country skiing.
 Rock engravings can be 
seen in the village and on  
the plateau. Dating from the 
Bronze Age, they depict 
mainly daggers, halbards, 
shields and humans.
 About 2 km (1 mile) from 
the resort, the site of a trans-
mission mast at an altitude of 
2,740 m (8,993 ft) commands 
a magnificent view of the 
Atlas and the plain where 
Marrakech is located. In sum-
mer, Oukaïmeden is also the 
starting point for mountain 
hikes, particularly up to the 
Tizi-n-Ouaddi Pass, the beau-
tiful village of Tacheddirt, and 
to Imlil and the Tizi-n-Test.

Tour of the Jbel Toubkal Massif 3
Jbel Toubkal 5
You can climb to the top at 
the end of winter: it offers 
breathtaking views over the 
whole of the High Atlas.
As well as the opportunity to climb to the top of 
Jbel Toubkal, at 4,167 m (13,676 ft) the highest  
peak in the Atlas, the Jbel Toubkal massif offers 
great scope for hikes lasting several days. Climbing 
Toubkal is not particularly difficult, but the fact that 
it is a high-altitude hike over rough terrain should 
be taken into account. From the Toubkal Refuge, 
the summit of Jbel Toubkal can be reached in about 
four hours. For the finest view over the High Atlas, 
it is best to reach the summit in the late morning.
Lepiney Hut 8
Located at the start 
of the hike up the 
Azzaden valley and 
across the Tazarhart 
plateau, at 3,000 m 
(9,846 ft), the hut is 
used by seasoned 
hikers and rock 
climbers.
Toubkal Refuge 4
This is the last stopping 
place before the summit of 
Jbel Toubkal. The refuge,

The village of Magdaz, built on an outcrop of rock
places, was built by the 
French in the 1930s.
 Just before Ouirgane, a 
small road to the right leads 
to Amizmiz, a pretty village 
with a ruined kasbah, set in 
the midst of olive trees. The 
souk here is renowned for 
Berber pottery made in the 
village itself. Ouirgane is a 
resort whose coolness in  
summer makes it popular 
with the inhabitants of  
Marrakech. A few salt mines 
are still worked here.
 As the road climbs further 
up to the Tizi-n-Test Pass, 
snaking through red, almost 
purple terrain, the landscape 
becomes more wild. Starting 
from Ijoukak, keen 
hikers can reach the 
Agoundis valley,

In an isolated setting at the 
foot of the Atlas, 10 km  
(6 miles) beyond Ijoukak on 
the Tizi-n-Test Pass road, the 
Mosque of Tin Mal situated 
uphill from the  
village, is the last 
remaining sign  
of the Almohad 
conquest in the 
12th century.
 Tin Mal, once a 
fortified holy town, 
was founded by the 
theologian Ibn Toumart 
in 1125. From here, he 
fomented a holy war 
against the Almoravids 
and was recognized as a  
religious leader by the Berber 
tribes of the High Atlas.
 In 1276, the town was sacked 
and pillaged by the Merinids. 
Only the sumptuous mosque 
was left standing. It was built 
in 1153 by Abd el-Moumen, 
Ibn Toumart’s successor  
and the first Almohad ruler.

With an interesting red- 
walled kasbah, Asni is the 
first large village on the  
road from Marrakech to the 
Tizi-n-Test Pass. Attractive 
orchards surround the village 
and there are many mule 
tracks leading up to the  
plateaux in its vicinity.
 From this small settlement, 
a metalled road leads to the 
village of Imlil, which is the 
starting point for hikes to Jbel 
Toubkal (see p249).
Environs
The very popular moussem 
at Moulay Brahim, 5 km (3 
miles) from Asni, takes place 
one to two weeks after the 
festival of Mouloud (see p41). 
Moroccans ascribe to the saint 
Moulay Brahim the power to 
cure barren women. Pilgrims 
come to lay their gifts before 
his tomb and to hang small 
pieces of fabric from the 
shrubs here. When one of 
these fragments falls from  
the shrub, the woman who 
hung it may expect a child.

About 5 km (3 miles) along 
the road running down  
from the Tizi-n-Tichka Pass, 
towards Ouarzazate, a narrow 
metalled minor road leads off 
to the left. It drops down into 
a steep valley, and 20 km  
(12 miles) further on reaches 
the kasbah of Telouet.
 This was one of the princi-
pal residences of Al-Thami  
el-Glaoui, pasha of Marrakech, 
whose fiefdom covered a 
large part of the High Atlas. 
El-Glaoui served the sultan, 
then switched to the French 
in 1912. His opposition to 
Sultan Mohammed V cost  
him dear, for on his death  
his family was exiled and his  
possessions dispersed.
 Thus it was that Telouet, a 
town with an illustrious past, 
has been the victim of neglect 
since 1956. The glazed tiles 
are disintegrating, the lookout 
towers crumbling, the walls 
cracking and the windows 
shattered. Most of the rooms 
are inaccessible since the  
roof has fallen in.
 However, low-ceilinged, 
bare-walled corridors lead  
to two reception rooms that 
have miraculously survived 
the passage of time. They  
are vestiges of the opulence 
treasured by El-Glaoui. The 
Andalusian-style rooms have 
engraved stuccowork, painted 
cedar ceilings and doors, and 
colourful zellij tilework. Day-
light entering through a glass-
covered dome and a small 
window framed with decora-
tive wrought iron lights the 
rooms from dawn to sunset.
Environs
From Telouet, a narrow, 
winding metalled road offers 
a picturesque route to the  
village of Aït Benhaddou (see 
p265). In this fertile valley, 
planted with palm, fig and  
olive trees, and irrigated by 
Wadi Ounila, kasbahs signal 
the past importance of El-
Glaoui’s fiefdom. The attrac-
tive village of Anemiter, 
standing at the head of the 
Ounila valley some 11 km  
(9 miles) from Telouet, is  
unusually well preserved.

Built by the French in the 
1920s, this winding road  
runs through a landscape  
that is, by turn, arid, mineral-
rich environments and fertile 
valleys. Pisé villages, in tones 
of red or grey, huddle at the 
foot of hillsides.
 The first pass, Tizi-n-Aït 
Imger, at an altitude of 1,470 m 
(4,825 ft), offers a panoramic 
view of the Atlas chain. Here, 
the road is lined with stalls 
selling pottery, mineral rocks 
and stones whose colours are 
a little too bright to be natural.
 From here up to the Tizi-n-
Tichka Pass – which, at an 
altitude of 2,260 m (7,417 ft), 
is the highest road pass in 
Morocco – crops gradually 
give way to a landscape of 
bare red soil. The mountains 
become more rounded and 
the houses are built higher, 
with more decoration,  
anticipating those of the 
Moroccan south. The  
impressive fortified grainstore 
on the way out of Igherm-n-
Ougdal is open to visitors.
The mosque has been 
restored and as a UNESCO 
World Heritage Site, it is one 
of the few religious buildings 
in Morocco that is open to 
non-Muslims. Its high walls 
and sturdy towers give it a 
fortress-like look.
Beyond Agouim, on the other 
side of the wadi, stands the 
restored kasbah at El-Mdint, 
its towers decorated with relief 
patterns. Palm trees come into 
view, and a wide stony desert 
plain with tones of pink and 
beige leads to Ouarzazate.

Aït Bouguemez Valley 9
The wide, flat Aït Bouguemez valley  
is flanked by a landscape of high,  
arid hilltops. This is the domain of  
the Aït Bouguemez tribe, who are  
settled farmers. The tribe is thought  
to be the oldest-established in the 
region. The valley is covered in  
meticulously tilled plots of land  
surrounded by ditches, and walnut 
trees grow in undulating fields of  
barley and corn. On the dry slopes, 
pisé hamlets cluster around tighremts, old fortified 
houses. The valley is the starting point for hikes 
through spectacular scenery up to the massif of  
Jbel M’Goun. There are 28 villages scattered along 
the valley between Agouti and Zaouïa Oulemsi.
Zaouïa

Perched on the summit of a 
pointed hill, in the centre of 
the Aït Bouguemez valley, 
Sidi Moussa granary has

UNESCO’s World Heritage list. 
It is reached by a steep path 
from the village of Timit.
 This collective granary, one 
of three in the region, is a 
sturdy circular building with 
incorporated watch towers.
 In the interior, which is lit 
by sparse loop-hole windows, 
a spiral staircase leads to the 
two upper floors. In the half-
light, compartments arranged 
along the walls can be made 
out. This was where the inha-
bitants kept their possessions.
 Sidi Moussa, the holy man 
renowned for his good deeds 
and his powers as a healer, is 
buried here. Sterile women of 
the Aït Bouguemez valley and 
from more distant valleys visit 
the shrine, where they spend

flat roof of the house serving as a terrace for the 
inhabitants of the house above. Looking down onto 
the river and the village’s communal land, these cube-
like houses catch the warmth of the rising sun and  
are adapted to the rigours of the climate. Houses in  
the valley bottom are built of pisé, raw earth dug at 
the spot where the house is to be built, mixed with 
water and sometimes straw. In villages at altitudes 
above 2,200 m (7,220 ft), dry stone is used, since  
pisé is unsuited to cold and wet conditions.

 Zaouïa Ahansal, 
consisting of some 
old tighremts and 
the tomb of its 
founder, Saïd 
Ahansal, dates  
from the 14th  
century, when the 
marabout movement loomed 
large in the history of this 
mountain region. Zaouias 
(sanctuaries set up around  
the tombs of marabouts, 
holy figures and the leaders 
of brotherhoods) were then 
protected holy places, where 
pilgrims and the needy found 
refuge. In exchange for the 
protection given by the 
marabout, the Berbers 
maintained the land around 
the zaouia, were taught 
Arabic and received Koranic 
instruction.
 Heedless of the power of 
the sultans, the leaders of 
some zaouias controlled the 
lives of the mountain people, 
settling disputes over land 
ownership and imposing their 
will. Zaouïa Ahansal was a 
major influence on the local 
Berber populations, but the 
descendants of Saïd Ahansal 
came into conflict with the 
fiefs of the caids of the High 
Atlas. They held out against 
the French until 1934.

On its eastern end, the  
chain of the High Atlas 
descends as if it had  
been crushed, forming a 
desert plateau surrounded 
by rolling mountains. 
Imilchil is at the heart 
of this sparsely  
populated region – 
the territory of the  
Aït Haddidou.
 This group of 
semi-nomadic 
shepherds came 
originally from 
Boumalne du Dadès, located 
in the high Dadès valley, 
where some of them still live. 
They arrived in Morocco  
during the centuries  
immediately after the  
introduction of Islam, and 
there is evidence of their 
presence in the Boumalne du 
Dadès region durng the 11th 
century. For several years 
they were in conflict with the 
powerful Aït Atta tribe in  
disputes over pasture, then 
settled in the Assif Melloul 
valley in the 17th century.
 The village of Imilchil is 
dominated by a sumptuously 
decorated kasbah. Its towers 
have a curious feature: the 
angles of the crenellation are 
set with finials resembling 
inverted cooking pots. This 
decorative device is also  
related to superstitious belief, 
as it gives protection against 
lightning and the “evil eye” 
and is a symbol of prosperity.
Although Imilchil is remote, 
its claim to fame is the annual 
Marriage Fair, a moussem at 
which women may choose a 
fiancé and many pilgrims and 
traders from the mountains 
gather. It takes place at the 
end of September at a spot 
known as Aït Haddou 
Ameur, some 20 km  
(13 miles) from Imilchil. 
Arriving on foot, by 
truck or by mule, all 
the tribes of the area 
flock to this great 
yearly commercial, 
social and religious 
gathering. The  
pilgrims throng 
around the pisé 
walls of the shrine 
of Sidi Ahmed ou Mghanni, a 
venerated holy 
man, to present 
their offerings.
 The origin of the 
Marriage Fair goes 
back to the story of 
two lovers, Hadda 
and Moha, members 
of rival tribes who 
were kept apart by 
their parents. Their 
tears created two 
lakes, Iseli, “the 
fiancé”, and Tiselit, 
“the fiancée”, on 
the Plateau des Lacs 
(see below). Ever 
since, young girls 
who come to the 
moussem with their 
family may converse 
freely with men 
from other tribes, 
although they must 
be accompanied  
by a sister or a  
female friend. 
Lake Tiselit, on the Plateau des Lacs, near Imilchil
Young couples who wish  
to can visit the tent of the 
adouls (lawyers) and sign a 
betrothal agreement. These 
unions are often engineered 
by the respective families 
ahead of the moussem.
 The event, which for some 
years has attracted crowds of 
tourists, has lost some of its 
authenticity. The presentation 
and parade of the couples and 
the evenings of folk dance 
and song are but a superficial 
aspect of what is a great com-
mercial and religious gathering.
 The colourful tents of the 
great souk spread out across 
the wide plateau. Traders sell 
basketry, cooking utensils, 
blankets and handwoven  
carpets, metalware, clothing, 
basic foodstuffs, and other 
items. On the hillside, herds 
of cows and camels and 
flocks of sheep await buyers.
 The Plateau des Lacs can be 
reached either by following a 
long track that runs from El-
Ksiba, crossing narrow gorges 
and undulating passes, or on a 
surfaced road via Rich, further 
east. This mineral-rich environ-
ment, at an altitude of 2,000– 
3,500 m (6,500–11,500 ft), is 
dotted with isolated tighremts, 
and a splash of colour is  
provided by the emerald 
waters of lakes Tiselit and Iseli. 
In summer, sheep are brought 
to the lush pasture here.

non-nomadic peasants. Many of 
them have a completely self- 
sufficient lifestyle, and in certain 
valleys mule tracks are the only 
channel of communication with 
the outside world. The inhabit-
ants of these remote valleys live 
by the pattern of the seasons and 
the round of work in the fields. 
In the autumn, the men till the 
soil with a wooden plough and buy 
and sell goods and produce at the 
weekly souk. In winter, the women 
collect water from the river, 
gather wood and weave thick 
woollen blankets. In spring, 
the men dig and maintain vital 
irrigation channels. In summer, 
the women harvest and thresh the 
grain, while the men winnow 
barley on threshing floors.
FAMILY FESTIVALS
The daily life of the  
Berber women of the 
High Atlas is enlivened 
by family festivals. The 
women, dressed in  
dazzling clothes, dance 
the ahwach or the 
ahidous, according to 
the region, while the 
men intone chants as 
they beat out a regular 
rhythm on their bendir.

At the Marriage Fair in Imilchil, the raïs, the dance leader of 
this folk troupe, beats out the rhythm on his bendir, a kind  
of tambourine, with his right hand.
This weaver from Abachkou, 
in the Aït Bou Oulli valley, 
washes, cards and spins 
sheep’s wool. She weaves  
the yarn into cloth to  
make white capes, which  
are then decorated with  
pieces of metal.
Men come to the souk at Imilchil to buy and sell livestock and  
to stock up with vital supplies for the winter.

The history of Morocco is closely linked 
to this region bordering the Sahara 
desert, the birthplace of the great  
Moroccan dynasties. In the 11th century, 
Almoravid warriors, who came from the 
Sahara, set out from the south to 
extend their empire from Senegal 
to Spain. In the 16th century, 
the Saadians, who came from 
Arabia, left the Draa valley 
to conquer Morocco.  
Lastly, the Alaouites, the 
dynasty that holds power 
in Morocco today, settled in the Tafilalt 
region in the 13th century.
Trade in gold, salt and slaves between 
black Africa and Morocco melded the 
local populations, so that Arabs, Berbers 
and Haratines, descendants of ancient 
black populations, lived side by side. 
Life here centres on 
three great wadis, the 
Draa, the Dadès and 
the Ziz. These rivers 
have created stunning 
landscapes, carving gorges 
and canyons out of the sides of the 
High Atlas and Anti-Atlas. The date 
palm that brings welcome shade to 
small plots of corn and barley accounts 
for the region’s wealth. The palm groves 
are punctuated by hundreds of kasbahs 
and ksour. These fortified villages and 
houses protected the sedentary popu-
lations against attack from nomadic  
tribes. Many of them are still inhabited 
today, although they are slowly crum-
bling. The desert begins south of the 
oases. Every year, aided by drought, it 
encroaches further on arable land.

T
his fascinating region begins at the southern edge of the  
High Atlas, where desert and mountains meet. The stony  
desert is broken by green oases where shade-giving date palms 
grow in profusion. Cut by steep canyons and studded with arid hills, 
it is criss-crossed by wadis right up to the edge of the Sahara. Here, the 
light is intensely bright and the colours sumptuously rich.

Exploring Ouarzazate 
and the Southern Oases
 The Draa Valley, south of Ouarzazate, and the Tafilalt valley, 
south of Er-Rachidia, are the two great routes to the Sahara. 
The valleys are interconnected by the Dadès valley, which 
covers 120 km (75 miles) between Ouarzazate and Boumalne 
du Dadès. It cuts through a desert plateau at an average 
altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 m (3,282 to 4,923 ft), set between 
the High Atlas on its northern side and the foothills of Jbel 
Sarhro on its southern side. Other valleys, irrigated by  wadis 
flowing down from the Atlas, impinge on the Dadès valley. 
Negotiable on foot or by four-wheel-drive vehicle, they give 
access to the interior of the High Atlas. Exploring this region, 
experiencing the scenic oases and visiting the most 
interesting  ksour , takes at least a week.

 GETTING AROUND 
 Roads in a good state of repair run between Ouarzazate 
and Zagora, Er-Rachidia and Erfoud. However, distances 
are great, and the mountainous terrain and passes to be 
negotiated must be taken into account. Although certain 
tracks can be followed only in a four-wheel-drive vehicle, 
an ordinary car is sufficient to drive major 
roads. Buses and  grands taxis from 
Ouarzazate cover the whole region.

A former garrison town of the 
French Foreign Legion, Ouar-
zazate was founded in 1928, 
having been chosen by the 
French as a strategic base 
from which to pacify the 
South. Located at an altitude 
of 1,160 m (3,807 ft) at the 
intersection of the Draa and 
Dadès valleys, with the  
Agadir region to the west,  
it is on the main route 
between the mountains  
and the desert. It is also a 
good base from which to  
visit Aït Benhaddou and  
the Skoura palm grove.
 Ouarzazate is a peaceful 
provincial town with wide 
streets, many hotels and 
municipal gardens. Avenue 
Mohammed V, the only main 
street, crosses the town and 
leads to the Dadès valley.
 About 6 km (4 miles) out-
side Ouarzazate, off the road 
to Marrakech, are the Atlas 
Film Studios, surrounded by 
high pisé walls that look as  
if they are defended by giant 
Hollywood-style, pseudo-
Egyptian figures. The studios, 
which cover 30,000 sq m 
(322,920 sq ft) of desert,  
provide the livelihood 
of a considerable 
portion of the 
population of 
Ouarzazate.
For a century, 
hundreds of  
films have been 
shot in this 
region, including 
Bertolucci’s The Sheltering 
Sky (1990) and Scorsese’s 
Kundun (1997). On the other 
side of the town, opposite the 
Taourirt Kasbah, are the 
Andromeda Italian film studios.

Ouarzazate’s only historic 
building, the Taourirt Kasbah 
stands as a monument to 
Glaoui expansionism. At  
the beginning of the 20th 
century, the Glaoui family 
were the lords of the South 
and controlled access to the 
High Atlas. They were the 
first to collaborate with the 
French in the expansion of 
the latter’s rule in the South.
 Begun in the 18th century 
and renovated in the 19th, the 
kasbah has been undergoing 
restoration from time to time 
since 1994. It once housed the 
large Glaoui family, together 
with their servants.
The façade, con-
sisting of high 
smooth earth 
walls, is pitted 
and decorated 
with geometric 
patterns in  
negative relief.
 Inside, a maze 
of staircases at every level of 
the building leads to rooms  
of various sizes lit by low 
windows. The larger rooms 
have plasterwork decoration 
featuring floral and geometric 
motifs, and colourfully painted 
wooden ceilings. There are 
also some tiny rooms with 
low rush-matted ceilings, 
doorless arches, red-tiled 
floors and white walls.

Environs
About 10 km (6 miles) to the 
south is the Finnt Oasis, with 
fine pisé ksour. A little further 
on is the El-Mansour Eddahbi 
Dam, fed by the Dadès and 
Ouarzazate rivers, which join 
to form the Draa. The dam 
provides water for the golf 
course, the Draa’s palm groves 
and electricity for the valley. 
About 7 km (4 miles) north-
west of Ouarzazate is the 
majestic Tiffoul toute Kasbah, 
offering fine views from its 
terrace. It was converted into 
a hotel in the 1960s to provide 
rooms during the shooting of 
David Lean’s Lawrence of 
Arabia. It is now a restaurant.

Stretching for over 100 km 
(60 miles), Jbel Sarhro is a 
wild and inhospitable region 
that is still off the tourist 
track. It is separated from  
the main Anti-Atlas chain by 
the Draa valley to the west 
and from the High Atlas by 
Wadi Dadès to the north.

Backing onto a pinkish  
sandstone hill, the ksar of 
Aït Benhaddou stands on  
the left bank of Wadi Mellah. 
It is reached on foot from the 
newly established village on 
the opposite bank. The wadi 
is usually dry, except in  
winter and spring.
 The picturesque village of 
Aït Benhaddou, which has 
often been used as a film 
location, can be explored 
without a guide. It was once 
fortified and has a now-
ruined igherm (communal 
granary). Built near water  
and arable land, in a place 
safe from foreign attack, it 
contains an impressive group 
of ochre pisé kasbahs.
 Since the village was  
made a UNESCO World  
Heritage Site, some of its  
kasbahs have undergone  
restoration to their upper  
sections. The kasbahs’ crenel-
lated towers are decorated

Next to the kasbah is a former 
Berber village, which probably 
predates the kasbah. It is in-
habited by a busy population. 
In the narrow winding streets 
of the ksar (fortified village), 
you will find an Internet café,

serves as a carpet shop, and

jewellery and pottery, all at 
relatively high prices.

relief, creating a play of light 
and shadow. Behind the kas-
bahs stand plain earth houses. 
Today, the ksar is inhabited 
by fewer than ten families.
 Beyond Aït Benhaddou, a 
minor road leads to the 
ruined fortress of Tamdaght, 
once a kasbah inhabited by 
the Glaoui. Its towers are now 
inhabited by nesting storks. 
The road continues to Telouet,

the most important tribe in 
southern Morocco. This semi-
nomadic people never bowed 
to the power of the sultans, 
and they were the last to resist 
the French at the Battle of Bou 
Gafer in 1933. They live in 
ksour, but take to tents for part 
of the year, when they drive 
livestock to seasonal pastures.
 Jbel Sarhro is a region of 
sheer rockfaces, plateaux and 
blackish rocky escarpments. 
The rugged territory is crossed 
from north to south by tracks, 
which are best driven in a 
four-wheel-drive vehicle 
(routes are seldom signposted).
 At the Baha Kasbah in 
Nekob guides can be hired 
for hikes and tours in four-
wheel-drive vehicles. The 
route from Nekob to the Tizi 
n’Tazazert Pass, at 2,200 m 
(7,220 ft), is difficult, but the 
spot known as Bab N’Ali is 
worth the visit for some strik-
ing needle-like volcanic rock 
formations. The track to Boul-
mane du Dadès crosses the 
Vallée des Oiseaux (Valley 
of Birds), which is home to 
over 150 species of birds.

The Kasbah
Kasbahs (tighremt in Berber) have long fulfilled  
the role of fortified castles, being places of refuge 
from attack for people and animals, and affording 
protection from the cold and other threats to safety. 
A lordly residence or family dwelling, the kasbah is 
an imposing edifice built to a square plan. While 
kasbahs in the mountain valleys are thick-set, those 
in the southern oases have a taller, more slender 
outline. At the four corners are towers crowned  
with merlons rising above the height of the walls.

miles) between Ouarzazate and 
Zagora on road N9. ( Thu in Agdz.
Rock engravings discovered 
near Tinzouline show that the 
Draa valley was inhabited by 
warriors from prehistoric 
times. The valley, where 
buildings are in a good state 
of preservation, contains a 
wealth of ksour and kasbahs.
 The road between Ouarza-
zate and Agdz crosses the 
desert plateaux of Jbel Tifern-
ine. Beyond Aït Saoun, hills 
of black rock give way to 
steep canyons as the road 
climbs towards the Tizi-n-
Tinififft Pass, at 1,660 m 
(5,448 ft). To the north appear 
the foothills of the High Atlas 
and to the east, Jbel Sarhro.
 Agdz, an unassuming town 
on the edge of a palm grove, 
is convenient for a short stop. 
Between Agdz and Zagora, 
the road follows a string of 
oases. Villages have grown  
up around the old kasbahs, 
on the edge of the road and 
in the palm grove.
 About 6 km (4 miles) from 
Agdz, a track branching off to 
the left leads to the majestic 
ksar of Tamnougalt, which 
once controlled access to the 
trade routes of the Draa  
valley. The interior reveals 
some striking frescoes, which 
were painted in pale colours 
for the shooting of a film.
 Continuing along the left 
bank of the Draa, the track 
leads to the pisé village of 
Tamnougalt, with narrow, 
partly covered streets. Visitors 
wishing to see the old kasbah 
may like to bring a torch, 
which is useful for viewing its 
superb painted ceilings. Tam-
nougalt, which is currently 
undergoing restoration, also 
has a former mellah (Jewish 
quarter) with a synagogue.
 Back on the Draa valley 
road, the elegant Timiderte 
Kasbah comes into view on 
the left bank of the wadi,

looks black since it is covered 
with volcanic stone. A little 
further on, a track to the left 
leads to Foum-Rjam, one of 
the largest prehistoric necro-
polises in the Maghreb.
Tumuli mark thousands

of Tamegroute, and off to the 
left, are the Tinfou Dunes, an 
isolated ridge of sand rising 
a haven of peace on the edge 
of the desert. In the former 
mellah, the mosque stands 
next to the abandoned  
synagogue. Amazraou is 
inhabited by Arabs, Haratines 
and Berbers, who  
continue the Jewish 
tradition of making 
silver jewellery. By 
following a footpath 
from the La Fibule 
hotel, the summit of  
Jbel Zagora can be 
reached in one hour.
It is crowned by a  
military post and  
commands a breath-
taking view of the valley. The 
remains of walls indicate the 
presence of the Almoravids  
in the 11th century.
 Two hotels, the Kasba 
Asmaa and La Fibule, offer 
tours in four-wheel-drive  
vehicles or on camels. Lasting 
from a day to two weeks, the 
tours take in the Chigaga 
dunes south of Mhamid, and 
Foum-Zguid, west of Zagora.

Road map C4. @ from Ouarzazate 
and Tinerhir. ( Mon.
The small sleepy town of 
Skoura is surrounded by  
an impressive palm grove, 
which was laid out in the 
12th century by the Almohad 
sultan Yacoub el-Mansour. 
The most beautiful kasbahs in 
southern Morocco are to be 
found here. Some of these are 
still partially inhabited, and 
some are attached to private 
houses. Many of Skoura’s 
inhabitants, however, have 
moved into the breeze-block 
villages that line the road.
 The Ben Morro Kasbah 
stands on the left of the road 
above Skoura. It was built in 
the 17th century and, now 
completely restored, has been 
converted into a guesthouse. 
The entrance to the palm 
grove is on the other side of 
Wadi Amerhidil. The grove 
can be explored only on foot, 
by bicycle or on mule-back. 
The grove is irrigated by  
khettaras (underground 
channels) and wells  
dug at regular  
intervals. Ruined  
kasbahs stand among 
palm trees, fig trees, 
birch and tamarisk – 
whose tannin-rich 
flowers are used  
in the processing  
of skins. The most 
imposing is Amerhidil 
Kasbah, which was 
once owned by the 
Glaoui family and 
which dominates the 
wadi. The restored 
interior is now open  
to visitors. The kasbahs of  
Aït Sidi el-Mati, Aït Souss,  
El-Kebbaba and Dar Aïchil  
are also worth a visit.
 Further east, Aït Abou, 
built in 1863 and the oldest 
kasbah in the palm grove,  
has six storeys and walls  
25 m (82 ft) high. Its out-
buildings have been turned  
into a small short-stay gîte.
An orchard with pome-
granate, apple, pear, fig,  
quince and olive trees  
provides the necessary  
shade for growing crops.
 Twenty-five kilometres  
(15 miles) northeast of Skoura 
is the village of Toundout, 
where there are some highly 
decorated kasbahs. The 
Marabout of Sidi M’Barek 
served as a stronghold where 
the semi-nomadic people 
stored their crops, under  
the protection of the saint.
 A little way beyond Skoura, 
towards El-Kelaa M’Gouna, 
unexpected plantations of 
grasses imported from  
Australia in the 1990s help  
to preserve a little moisture  
in the arid ground.

This town, whose name 
means “fortress”, is located  
at an altitude of 1,450 m 
(4,759 ft), in the heart of rose 
country. In the 10th century, 
pilgrims returning from Mecca 
brought Rosa damascena 
back with them to Morocco. 
These peppery-scented  
flowers have developed a 
resistance to the cold and  
dry conditions in which  
they are now grown.
Each spring, rose-picking  
produces 3,000 to 4,000 
tonnes of petals. The harvest 
is taken to two local  
distillation factories. One of 
them, in El-Kelaa M’Gouna,  
is laid out in a kasbah, and  
it is open to visitors in April 
and May. While a proportion 
of the roses is used to make 
rosewater for local distribu-
tion, the rest is processed  
and exported for use in the 
perfume industry.
 The Rose Festival takes 
place after the harvest and is 
attended by all the inhabitants 
of the valleys of the Dadès. 
Accompanied by a bendir (a 
tambourine), young girls from 
El-Kelaa M’Gouna perform a 
sinuous dance, their long hair 
braided with coloured wool.
 On the road out of the 
town is a craft cooperative 
with about 30 workshops. 
Daggers are made here, the 
craftsmen continuing a Jewish 
tradition of making sheaths 
and dagger handles out of 
cedar or camel bone. The 
steel blades are made in the 
mountain village of Azlague, 
not far from El-Kelaa M’Gouna.

This lively town, the region’s 
administrative centre, lies 
midway between the Draa 
valley and the Tafilalt. Built 
on a rocky outcrop, it has an 
elongated layout. On its 
northern and southern sides  
it is bordered by a lush palm 
grove laid out at the foot of 
arid hills and containing  
dozens of ksour and kasbahs.
 With several silver mines  
in the vicinity, Tinerhir is a 
wealthy town known for its 
silver jewellery. To the west 
stands a kasbah once owned 
by the Glaoui and 
now in a state of 
disrepair. To the 
southeast is Aït el-
Haj Ali, the former

houses make an 
interesting architect-

stretches a palm 
grove irrigated  
by Wadi Todra.
 About 2 km  
(1 mile) from the bridge 
across the wadi, on the 
road to the Todra Gorge, 
a viewing platform commands 
a stunning view. Here, guides 
with camels offer their  
services. However, visitors 
need no assistance to walk 
down into the palm grove 
and follow the network of 
shady paths that lead through

MOROCCO’S ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE
The vestiges of a past age and  
of unique ways of life, kasbahs, 
ksour and granaries – all of them 
built of earth – are the victims  
of neglect. The kasbahs are 
crumbling, the ruins of once- 
luxurious residences are  
abandoned and clay walls slowly 
disappear into the ground. The 
Moroccan government seems 
indifferent to the unique value 
and interest of these buildings. 
Aside from sparse and sporadic 
activity, action to protect  
Morocco’s architectural heritage 
goes little further than listing its 
monuments and drawing up conservation programmes that 
produce no concrete results. The only active conservation 
in Morocco is that resulting from European initiatives. 
Besides the uncompleted restoration of the ksar at Aït  
Benhaddou, funded by UNESCO, that of the granary at 
Igherm-n-Ougdal, on the road to the Tizi-n-Tichka Pass, 
and of the Taourirt kasbah in Ouarzazate, the small number 
of kasbahs in the Dadès valley that have been restored 
were saved by private funding. Private initiative is also 
responsible for the skilful restoration of the Ben Morro  
kasbah and Aït Abou kasbah in Skoura and the Hôtel Tom-
bouctou in Tinerhir. Unfortunately, most of the Glaoui fort-
resses in the valleys of the Atlas are being left to their fate.

Southern and eastern Morocco have 
many oases. Their existence depends 
on the presence of water, which is 
either supplied by rivers flowing down 
from the mountains or provided by an 
underground water table. Underground 
water rises naturally at the foot of  
dunes or is pumped by artesian wells or along 
underground channels known as khettaras, some 
of them covering considerable distances. This 
accounts for the fact that the oases are strung out  
in a line along the Dadès, Draa and Ziz valleys.
Jerboa, or

Seguias are man-made channels that 
criss-cross the oasis, bringing water 
to the crops and trees. Clay plugs are 
sometimes used to divert the water 
along particular routes.
Crops such as tomatoes, 
carrots and lettuce, as well as 
fruit trees such as fig and  
apricot, thrive in the shade  
provided by the palm trees.
Irrigation is produced by khettaras, 
underground channels that bring 
water to the oasis. Here, the water is 
either drawn from a well or is simply 
forced to the surface by gravity.  
The exact amount of water needed 
for each crop is provided by seguias.

30 to 100 kg (66 to 220 lb) 
of dates a year. They are 
harvested in autumn.
The Southern and Eastern Oases
IRRIGATION IN THE OASES
Set in particularly hostile surroundings, oases 
are a very fragile ecological environment that 
survives thanks only to ceaseless human  
intervention. Many dams are built to control 
the flow of water in the wadis, which, when 
they are in flood, can devastate the plantations 
in the oases in a few hours. Khettaras and 
seguias must be regularly cleared.

are sunk to dig and then

visible on the surface.
Work in the fields 
is done by women,  
who carry out all  
stages in the cultivation 
of cereals and various 
kinds of vegetables.
At Tinerhir, many seguias

the oases. Toads frequent the banks of the water-
courses, geckos and lizards cling to stone walls and 
the trunks of trees, and scorpions hide under stones. 
During the night, jackals occasionally approach places 
of human habitation. The fennec, horned viper and 
herbivorous lizard rarely venture beyond the dunes 
and rocks where they were born.

On the border between  
the High and Middle Atlas, 
Midelt is considered to be 
part of southern Morocco. 
The small villages on each 
side of the road leading out 
of the town consist of  
traditional buildings that are 
very similar to those typical  
of southern Morocco. While, 
at the beginning of the 20th 
century, Midelt was no more 
than a modest ksar, under 
the Protectorate it became  
a French garrison town.
 Located at the foot of Jbel 
Ayachi, which rises to a 
height of 3,737 m (12,264 ft), 
Midelt is the starting point  
for tours. At an altitude of 
1,500 m (4,923 ft), the town 
enjoys a continental climate – 
very cold in winter and very 
hot in summer.
Beautiful Middle Atlas carpets, 
as well as fossils and mineral 
stones, are on sale in Souk 
Jedid. There is also a work-
shop in Kasbah Myriem, on 
the road to Tattiouine, where 
carpets, blankets and high-
quality embroidery are pro-
duced. It used to be run by 
Franciscan nuns who taught 
the local Berber women these 
handicrafts, thus ensuring an 
income for many families.

whose impressive red cliffs  
jut into the Atlas. Two fine 
ksour, Ifri and Amzrouf, 
both surrounded by palm 
trees, stand here.
 The Hassan-Addakhil dam, 
contained by a thick dyke of 
red earth, demarcates the lower 
foothills of the Atlas. Built in 
1970, it irrigates the Tafilalt 
and Ziz valleys and provides 
electricity for Er-Rachidia.
KSOUR IN THE OASES
The Ziz valley is ksar country. The ksar (plural ksour) 
was developed originally as a communal stronghold  
for sedentary populations, to protect them against the 
incursions of bandits and nomadic tribes that raided  
the oases when the harvests had been brought in.
The defensive design of these  
fortified villages is connected to 
this warlike past. The ksar usually 
overlooks the oasis. Originally,  
the ksar consisted of no more 
than a central alley with family 
houses on each side. Over time,  
it expanded to become a village, 
with a mosque, a medersa and 
granaries. Built of pisé and earth 
bricks in its upper part, every ksar 
bears the individual stamp of its 
builders, who devised elaborate 
incised geometric patterns.

As a result of its strategic 
location between northern 
and southern Morocco, and 
between the Atlantic seaboard 
and Figuig and the Algerian 
border, Er-Rachidia became 
the main town in the province. 
Here the palm groves of the 
Ziz and Tafilalt begin, and the 
town also stands at the start 
of the road to the south. Er-
Rachidia, also an administrative 
and military centre, was built 
by the French in the early 
20th century, when it was 
known as Ksar es-Souk. Its 
present name was bestowed 
in 1979 in memory of Moulay 
Rachid, the first of the Alaouites 
to overthrow Saadian rule in 
1666. Many ksour here were 
abandoned after 1960, when 
the Ziz broke its banks,  
causing serious floods and 
washing land away.
 Although they are busy, the 
town’s perfectly straight, grid-
like streets hold scant appeal.

This small town on the edge 
of the Sahara marks the end 
of the metalled road and the 
start of tracks into the desert. 
To the east is the Hammada 
du Guir, a stony desert  
notorious for its violent 
sandstorms.
 Rissani, built close to the 
ruins of Sijilmassa, was once 
the capital of the Tafilalt.  
Sijilmassa is said to have been 
founded in 757–8 as an  
independent kingdom, 
becoming a major stopping 
place on the trans-Saharan 
caravan routes. Over the  
centuries, it became prosper-
ous from trade in gold, slaves, 
salt, weapons, ivory and  
renowned for their fruit. Un-
fortunately, and despite care, 
for a century the trees have 
suffered from Bayoud palm 
sickness – caused by a micro-
scopic fungus – and the  
effects of excessive drought, 
both of which can kill them.
 The October date harvest in 
the palm grove is a spectacular 
sight. Each owner climbs to 
the top of his tree and, as the 
grove resonates to the sound 
of machetes, bunches of dates 
crash to the ground, falling in 
large orange heaps (they turn 
brown as they ripen).
 Symbols of happiness and 
prosperity, dates figure in many 
rituals, and in birth, wedding 
and burial ceremonies.

_ Date Festival (Oct).
Before the development of 
the town began in 1930, the 
French had set up a military 
post here to watch over the 
Tafilalt valley. The Berber 
tribes put up a long-drawn-
out resistance to the  
establishment of French rule, 
and the valley was one of  
the last parts of southern 
Morocco to surrender.
 Erfoud’s checkerboard lay-
out is a vestige of this military 
past. This peaceful town, with 
an extensive palm grove, is 
the base for tours of the dunes 
of the Erg Chebbi. From the 
top of the eastern borj, a 
small bastion 3 km (2 miles) 
southeast of Erfoud, the view 
takes in a wide swathe of 
desert and palm groves.
 In October, the souk at 
Erfoud overflows with dates 
of every variety. This is also 
when the three-day Date  
Festival, at the end of the date 
harvest, takes place. Both a 
religious and a secular event, 
the festival attracts local 
tribes. It begins with prayers 
at the mausoleum of Moulay 
Ali Cherif in Rissani, 17 km 
(11 miles) to the south, and 
continues with processions of 
people dressed in traditional 
costume and with folk dances.
 Polished marble containing 
fossils is Erfoud’s other main 
source of income. The cutting 
workshops, the Usine de 
Marmar, is open to visitors. 
The road is also bordered with 
many small craters – the tops 
of shafts down to khettaras.

spices, reaching its peak in 
the 13th and 14th centuries. 
However, religious dissent 
and the instability of the rival 
tribes that regularly launched 
raids on the city led to its 
destruction. The first town 
had a pisé wall on stone 
foundations pierced by eight 
gates, and contained a palace, 
fine houses, public baths and 
many gardens. A few vestiges 
of these emerge from the 
sand just west of Rissani.
 The Rissani Souk is one of 
the most famous in the area. 
Donkeys, mules, sheep and 
goats are enclosed in corrals. 
Stalls are piled with shining 
pyramids of dates, as well as 
with vegetables and spices. 
Beneath roofs made of palm-
matting and narrow pisé 
alleyways, jewellery, daggers, 
carpets, woven palm fibre 
baskets, pottery and fine local 
leather items, made 
from goat skins 
tanned with tam-
arisk bark, are laid 
out for sale.

(1.5 miles) stands 
the Mausoleum of 
Moulay Ali Cherif, 
where the father of 
Moulay er-Rachid, founder of 
the Alaouite dynasty, is laid to 
rest. The mausoleum was 
rebuilt in 1955, after it was 
damaged by a serious flood-

Road map E4. 53 km (33 miles)

The small Saharan oasis of 
Merzouga, much damaged by 
floods in 2006, is famous for 
its location at the foot of the 
Erg Chebbi Dunes. These 
photogenic dunes, which rise  
up out of the stony, sandy 
desert, extend for 30 km  
(19 miles), and reach a  
maximum height of 250 m 
(820 ft). At sunrise or dusk, 
the half-light gives the sand  
a fascinating range of colours.
 Although they are nearer  
to Rissani, Merzouga and the 
Erg Chebbi dunes are easier 
to reach from Erfoud. The 
services of a guide are not 
necessary, except when high 
winds whip up the sand. 
From Erfoud, going in the 
direction of Taouz, the  
metalled road degenerates 
into a track after 16 km  
(10 miles). Beyond the 
Auberge Derkaoua, visitors 
should follow the line of  
telegraph poles. The 
dunes come into 
view on the left. At 
Merzouga, camel 
drivers offer one-
hour to two-day  
tours of the dunes.
Dayet Srji, a small 
lake west of the  
village, sometimes 
fills with water  
during the winter, 
after sudden rainfall. 
It attracts hundreds  
of pink flamingoes, 
storks and other 
migratory birds.

was built in 1900 for 
the elder brother of 
Sultan Moulay  
Hassan, who was 
made governor of 
the Tafilalt. The 
monumental 
entrance, with elab-
orate decoration in 
its upper part, opens

Six thousand years ago, hunters forced 
northwards by the desertification of 
the Sahara moved into southwestern 
Morocco, as shown by the thousands 
of rock engravings that have been  
discovered in the Anti-Atlas. The 
Arab conquest in the 7th  
century inaugurated the age 
of the independent king-
doms. An important point 
for trans-Saharan trade 
between Morocco and 
Timbuctu, the Atlantic 
coast was coveted from 
the 15th century by the Portuguese 
and the Spaniards, who eventually 
colonized it in the late 19th century, 
re-naming it Río de Oro (Golden River).
When Spain withdrew from western 
Sahara in 1975, King Hassan II  
initiated the Green March during 
which 350,000 civilians reasserted 
Morocco’s claim to 
the region (see p58).
The great Souss 
plain, east of Agadir, 
lies at the heart of this 
isolated region. The com-
mercially grown fruit and vege-
tables here are irrigated by the 
underground waters of Wadi 
Souss, and the surrounding argan trees 
provide food for herds of black goats. 
To the south, the Anti-Atlas is the final 
mountainous barrier before the  
Sahara. Its almost surreal geological 
folds, shaped by erosion, alternate 
with verdant oases. Stone-built  
villages, often with an agadir  
(fortified granary), cluster along wadis 
or at the foot of mountains. Further 
south, the wide deserted beaches are 
sometimes cut off by lagoons that 
attract thousands of migratory birds.
SOUTHERN MOROCCO  
& WESTERN SAHARA
T
he vast southwestern region of Morocco embraces a variety  
of spectacular landscapes. The fertile Souss plain, an area  
dotted with oases and extensive stony deserts, is bordered by 
the rugged mountains of the Anti-Atlas. On the southern Atlantic 
coast, sheer cliffs give way to large areas of dunes linking Morocco to 
the Sahara and the republic of Mauritania.

Exploring Southern Morocco 
and Western Sahara
 All roads heading into the deep South begin at 
Agadir, Morocco’s foremost coastal resort. To the east 
lies the great Souss plain, which stretches north as far 
as the High Atlas and south as far as the Anti-Atlas. 
This mountain chain of rocky peaks and stony 
plateaux culminates on its eastern side in Jbel Siroua, 
a remarkable volcanic massif that reaches a height of 
3,304 m (10,844 ft), and whose western side, pitted 
with isolated valleys, slopes down towards the 
Atlantic. The resort of Agadir is linked to Tafraoute 
to the southeast, and to the numerous oases on the 
Saharan slopes of the Anti-Atlas. The road south links 
Agadir with the Saharan provinces, which start at the 
coastal town of Tarfaya. The focal points of human 
life in the Sahara are a few large towns surrounded 
by banks of dunes stretching to infinity.

 GETTING AROUND 
 Although the network of roads has 
improved considerably over recent 
years, the roads that cross the Anti-
Atlas between Igherm and Tata, 
and between Tiznit and Tafraoute, 
are long and tiring to drive, as they 
are narrow and follow the contours 
of the mountainside. By contrast, 
the 650 km (404 miles) between 
Agadir and Laayoune are relatively 
easy to cover, except when there 
are sandstorms. When travelling 
through the Saharan provinces it 
is extremely unwise to leave the 
road because landmines laid during 
the war between Morocco and 
the Polisario Front in the 1970s 
are still in place. The border with 
Mauritania can be crossed easily, 
as long as the required formalities 
are observed.

Agadir, the regional capital of the South beyond the  
Atlas, draws thousands of visitors a year. Its gentle  
climate – temperatures range from 7 °C to 20 °C (45 °F to 
68 °F) in January, the coolest month – together with its 
sheltered beach and hotels make it Morocco’s second 
tourist city after Marrakech. Having been completely 
rebuilt in the 1960s after the terrible earthquake that 
destroyed the city, Agadir has none of the charm of  
traditional Moroccan towns, although its wide-open  
spaces and its modernity appeal to many holiday- 
makers. The industrial quarter consists of oil storage 
tanks and cement works, as well as factories where fish  
is canned (Agadir is Morocco’s foremost fishing port)  
and where fruit from the fertile Souss plain is processed.
} Beach
South of the city, the  
sheltered beach, in a bay with 
9 km (6 miles) of fine sand, is 
Agadir’s main attraction,  
offering some of the safest 
swimming off Morocco’s 
Atlantic coast. However, 
although the city enjoys 300 
day of sunshine a year, it is 
often shrouded in mist in the 
morning. Sailboards, jet-skis 
and water scooters can be 
hired on the beach, and rides, 
on horses or camels, are also 
on offer. Many cafés, hotels 
and restaurants line the beach.
P Old Kasbah
At an altitude of 236 m  
(775 ft), the hilltop ruins of 
the kasbah, within restored 
ramparts, offer a stunning 
view of Agadir and the bay. 
The kasbah was built in 1540 
by Mohammed ech-Cheikh,  
to keep the Portuguese  
fortress under surveillance.
It was restored in 1752 by 
Moulay Abdallah and  
accommodated a garrison  
of renegade Christians and 
Turkish mercenaries.

AGADIR’S HISTORY
The origins of Agadir are  
not fully known. In 1505, a 
Portuguese merchant built a 
fortress north of the present 
city. This was acquired by 
King Manuel I of Portugal 
and converted into a garrison. 
By then, Agadir had become a 
port of call on the sea routes 
to the Sudan and Guinea. A 
century of prosperity began in 
1541, when the Portuguese were expelled by the Saadians. 
The Souss fell under the control of a Berber kingdom in the 
17th century, but Moulay Ismaïl later reconquered the region. 
In 1760, Sidi Mohammed ben Abdallah sealed the city’s fate 
when he closed its harbour and opened one in Essaouira. 
In 1911 Agadir was the object of a dispute between the 
French and the Germans relating to its strategic location. 
On 29 February 1960 an earthquake destroyed the city.

takes place in the fish

Taroudannt 2
80 km (50 miles) east of Agadir.  
* 36,000. @ from Casablanca, 
Agadir, Marrakech & Ouarzazate, or 
grands taxis; Thu & Sun. ( Berber 
souk daily. _ Moussem (Aug).
Enclosed within red-ochre 
ramparts and encircled  
by orchards, orange groves 
and olive trees, Taroudannt 
has all the appeal of an old 
Moroccan fortified town. It 
was occupied by the 
Almoravids in 1056 and in  
the 16th century became the 
capital of the Saadians, who 
used it as a base from which 
to attack the Portuguese in 
Agadir. Although the Saadians 
eventually chose Marrakech 
as their capital, they made 
Taroudannt wealthy through 
the riches of the Souss plain, 
which included sugar cane, 
cotton, rice and indigo.
 Under the Alaouites, the 
town resisted royal control, 
forming an alliance with 
Ahmed ibn Mahrez, the dissi-
dent nephew of Moulay 
Ismaïl. The latter regained 
control of the region by  
massacring the inhabitants.
 Taroudannt is a generally 
peaceful town, except during 
the annual olive harvest when 
it is enlivened by itinerant 
pickers. On its two main 
squares, Place Assarag and 
Place Talmoklate, horse-
drawn carriages can be hired 
for a tour of the ramparts, 
which are 7 km (4 miles) 
long. Set with bastions and 
pierced by five gates, they are 
in a remarkably good state of 
preservation, a part of them 
dating from the 18th century.
 The souks, between the  
two squares, are the town’s 
main attraction. The daily 
Berber market sells spices, 
vegetables, clothing, house-
hold goods, pottery and other 
items. In the Arab souk the 
emphasis is on handicrafts: 
terracotta, wrought iron, brass 
and copper, pottery, leather 
goods, carpets and Berber 
jewellery of a type once made 
by Jews can be seen. Carvings 
in chalky white stone are a 
speciality of Taroudannt.
 Outside the ramparts is a 
small tannery, which is open 
to visitors. Its shop sells goat-
skin and camel-hide sandals, 
lambskin rugs, soft leather 
bags, belts and slippers.
Environs
The peaks of the western 
High Atlas – particularly  
Jbel Aoulime, at a height of 
3,555 m (11,667 ft) – can be 
reached via road 7020, north 
of the town. About 37 km  
(23 miles) southeast of  
Taroudannt, the imposing 
Tioute Kasbah dominates the 
palm grove. This was the 
location for the film Ali Baba 
and the Forty Thieves, made 
by Jacques Becker in 1954.
A restaurant adjacent to the 
kasbah rather spoils the site. 
On the banks of Wadi Souss, 
which attracts migratory birds, 
stands the older Freija kasbah, 
now uninhabited.
 Between Taroudannt and 
Ouarzazate, the road (N10) 
passes through landscape of 
wild beauty. Plains covered 
with argan trees give way to 
the volcanic massif of Jbel  
Siroua, which bristles with 
peaks and where soft geol-
ogical folds alternate with 
rocky plateaux.
 Taliouine, a town between 
two mountain chains at an 
altitude of 1,180 m (3,873 ft), 
has a stately kasbah once 
owned by the Glaoui (see p57). 
Though dilapidated, it is still 
inhabited. The town is the 
centre of the world’s biggest 
saffron-growing area. In 
Tazenakht, 85 km (53 miles) 
east of Taliouine, beneath

ksour stand in the great Tata 
Palm Grove, where Berber 
and Arabic are spoken.
 Crossing Wadi Tata, which 
irrigates the grove, the road 
leads to Agadir-Lehne, where a 
stone koubba stands below a 
spring. Some 4 km (2.5 miles) 
further on are the Messalite 
caves, which are inhabited 
sporadically by shepherds.
Igherm, 94 km (58 miles) 
southeast of Taroudannt, is a 
large mountain village at an 
altitude of 1,800 m (5,908 ft). 
It is the base of the Ida  
Oukensous tribe, renowned 
for the daggers and guns that 
they make. The houses here 
are built of pink stone, their 
windows outlined in blue.

SAFFRON FROM TALIOUINE
Saffron (Crocus sativus) is a bulbed herbaceous plant that 
belongs to the iris family. It grows at altitudes of 1,200 to 
2,000 m (4,000 to 6,600 ft), in slightly chalky soil. Almost  
6 sq km (2.3 sq miles) of saffron fields around Taliouine 
are cultivated by families, each of which tends its own plot 
of land. The bulbs are planted in September at a density of 
7,500 per 1,000 sq m (10,760 sq ft), and the mauve flowers 
appear at the end of October. Harvesting takes place before 
sunrise and goes on for 15 to 20 days. It is a delicate  
process, involving the separation of the red stigmas that 
contain the colorant from the plant. After drying, 100,000 
flowers produce 1 kg (2.2 lb) of saffron, and just 1 gram  
(a tiny pinch) is enough to colour 7 litres (12 pints) of liquid. 
The precious powder is then poured into airtight boxes  
and stored away from daylight to preserve its flavour. 
Good-quality saffron is sold in the form of whole filaments. 
Saffron is used in food, as a dye for carpets and pottery, and 
for dyeing the hair and hands of brides. It is also a medicinal 
plant that is thought to aid digestion and calm toothache.

where river and sea water 
meet, where tides ebb and 
flow, and where winter  
temperatures are mild, attracts 
hundreds of migratory birds.
 The reed beds on the banks 
of the wadi are inhabited by 
greater flamingoes from the 
Camargue, in southern 
France, and from Spain, as 
well as godwit, turnstone, 
snipe, dunlin, coots, grey 
heron and many other  
species. The primary purpose 
of creating the park was to 
preserve the bald ibis, a  
species threatened with 
extinction. Morocco is home 
to half the world’s population 
of this curious bird, which  
has a pink featherless head.

At an altitude of 1,200 m

in the heart of a stunning  
valley of the Anti-Atlas. It is 
surrounded by a cirque of 
granite whose colours at the 
end of the day 
change from ochre 
to pink. The palm 
groves here are 
lush and, for the 
brief period of 
their flowering – 
two weeks in

almond trees are 
covered with 
clouds of pink and

MONK SEALS
The largest colony of monk seals (Monachus monachus) in 
the Mediterranean area is found along the Atlantic coast, in 
the very south of Morocco. In 1995, 200 seals still existed 
here but half the colony was destroyed by disease in 1998, 
and it faces a very uncertain future. This brown seal can 
grow to a length of 3 m (10 ft) and weigh up to 300 kg 
(660 lb). During the 20th century 
it has disappeared from the 
Canary Islands archipelago, 
Madeira and most of the islands 
of the Mediterranean. Today, it  
is still to be found in the Black 
Sea and on the Bulgarian and 
Turkish coasts, and it may still 
survive in Sicily and Sardinia.

 About 4 km (2.5 miles)  
further north is the fertile 
Ameln Valley, carpeted with 
orchards and with olive and 
almond trees. It is dotted with 
26 Berber villages perching on 
the mountain side, above which 
runs a precipitous mountain 
chain culminating in Jbel

The Nomad’s Tent
The khaïma, or nomad’s tent, seen on 
the desert plateaux of the High Atlas, 
outside the towns of Zagora and 
Guelmim, is the moveable 
home of shepherds who 
travel to provide their flocks 
with seasonal grazing. The 
sturdy tent is easy to set  
up and gives protection 
against the heat. The brown fabric  
is woven from goat or camel hair.  
It consists of flijs, strips 40 to 60 cm  
(16 to 24 in) wide, sewn together  
edge to edge. It rests on a ridgepole 
supported on two vertical 
wooden poles. The interior 
of the tent is divided into 
two. One side, with basic 
cooking equipment and a 
loom, is for the women. The 
other side, separated by a screen, is 
reserved for the men and for visitors.
Driving animals to seasonal pastures occurs in 
Morocco’s more arid regions. In summer, the nomads 
take their herds and flocks up to the high pastures  
of the Atlas, returning to the south in winter.
The nomad’s tent is set up on level ground. In summer, the 
covering is laid over the poles in such a way as to allow air  
to circulate freely. In winter, the sides are drawn together  
and are insulated with long woollen blankets and carpets.
Nomadic Berber women card 
wool before spinning it into 
yarn. Using a loom unchanged 
since ancient times, they weave 
blankets and lengths of cloth.
These nomads, portrayed in a century-old 
photograph, lived in a way which hasn’t 
changed much to this day. Nomads still 
travel from one source of water to another.
Nomads are rarely seen 
because they mostly  
frequent mountain or 
desert environments  
that are remote from  
civilization. However, for  
a few weeks of the year, 
some of them settle in an 
oasis. Their tents are very 
simply furnished, with  
little more than thick, 
heavy carpets and wooden 
chests where the women 
keep their most prized  
possessions. The hospitality 
of the nomads is legendary.

n Morocco, choosing a hotel  
depends primarily on its location 
and on the services that you  
require during your stay. Hotels are 
graded according to an official sys-
tem of classification that is now 
usually much more reliable than it 
once was, although at the cheaper 
end of the spectrum standards may 
be somewhat below European  
expectations. There are hotels in a wide 
range of price bands, so that visitors will 
have no difficulty in finding accom-
modation to suit their budget. Luxury  
hotels are becoming increasingly  
numerous, as are guesthouses, 
many of which are in riads (houses 
with patios). In the low season, 
prices are often negotiable, even  
in the smartest establishments. Be-
ware of travelling without having 
made prior reservations, however, 
since at certain times of the year 
accommodation is almost impos-
sible to find. For those with smaller bud-
gets, youth hostels and guest rooms are 
attractive alternatives so long as visitors 
observe the ground rules.
CHOOSING A HOTEL
The location of your hotel, 
especially in large towns  
and cities, is an important  
criterion. It is usually best to 
stay somewhere near the old 
town, where the main tourist 
sites are often found. The  
disadvantage of such a loca-
tion, however, is that the 
hotel is noisy and unlikely to 
offer parking. If you would 
like more space, especially a 
garden – and many gardens 
also have a swimming pool – 
it is best to choose a hotel  
on the edge of the old town 
or in a modern quarter.
 Smaller towns rarely offer 
high-class accommodation, 
especially in the South. Here, 
your choice of hotel should 
be governed by your itine-
rary. In the South, most  
places of interest to tourists 
are not in the towns them-
selves but along the roads 
between them, so that rather 
standard of accommodation 
that they offer.
 As a general rule, four- and 
five-star hotels are well equip-
ped, with satellite television, 
telephone, en-suite bathrooms 
and room service, as well as 
many other features such as  
a restaurant, swimming pool, 
sports centre and hammam. 
Two- and three-star hotels are 
comfortable and clean, with 
private bath or shower. The 
small one-star hotels, or  
hotels without classification, 
are often quite basic and  
may not be very clean. It is 
advisable to ask to see the 
room before you decide.
 Although most ungraded 
hotels do not deserve to be 
listed, some are, in fact, very 
comfortable establishments.  
It is only reluctance on the 
part of their owners to do  
the necessary paperwork  
that prevents them from  
being listed.

where to stay in relation to 
the distance you intend to 
cover each day.
CLASSIFICATION OF 
HOTELS AND SERVICES
The Moroccan Ministry of 
Tourism has devised an  
official system of classification 
for hotels. Accordingly, hotels 
are graded on a scale of one 
to five stars, with two sub- 
categories, A and B. In prin-
ciple, each grade corresponds 
to certain standards of com-
fort, as well as criteria such as 
the size of the establishment.
 Once bearing little relation 
to reality, the system by 
which stars are awarded was 
recently overhauled. Although 
some hotels may still be over-
ambitiously graded, many 
have been downgraded to 
reflect more accurately the

PRICES
By law, prices for accom-
modation must be shown  
in the reception area as  
well as in the rooms, and  
this requirement is widely  
fulfilled. Be aware, however, 
that advertised prices rarely 
include tax (ranging from 1 to 
25 dirhams, according to the 
town and the hotel) and that 
they do not include breakfast.
 The average price of a single 
room in a small one-star or 
unlisted hotel is 150 dirhams. 
A two- or three-star establish-
ment will charge 250 to 400 
dirhams, and a three-star  
category-A hotel or a four-star 
hotel 400 to 1,000 dirhams. The 
numerous five-star hotels charge 
1,200 dirhams, and some of 
them over 2,000 dirhams. There 
is no official upper limit.
 Prices vary according to the 
season, and it is not unusual 
to see prices double around 
the holiday periods at the end 
of the year and in spring, and 
during the summer in the 
coastal resorts. Prices also 
vary according to the number 
of people renting the room. 
For example, for a child or a 
third adult sharing a room, a 
supplement will be charged, 
though usually with a  
reduction of 5 to 50 per cent.
 The reliable Kenzi hotel 
chain, which has hotels all 
over Morocco, gives discounts 
when reservations are made 
in several of their establish-
ments, and also in the low 
season. Information about 
hotels is available from the 
Fédération Nationale de 
l’Industrie Hôtelière in 
Casablanca.
NEGOTIATING  
A LOWER PRICE
Negotiating a lower price for 
a hotel room is quite common 
practice, and it bears results. 
At slack times, it is possible  
to obtain reductions of up  
to 30 per cent. However, it  
is a waste of time trying to 
negotiate at the peak of the 
high season, or in the very 
smart hotels, such as the  
La Mamounia in Marrakech.
RESERVATIONS
During the high seasons,  
and particularly over  
the spring and end-of-year 
holiday periods, the crowds 
of holiday-makers can be 
unexpectedly large. This is 
also true of coastal resorts 
during the summer. At such 
The Kasbah Asmaa Hôtel in Zagora (see p319), with a pleasant swimming 
pool and palm trees giving welcome shade
The Auberge Kasbah Derkaoua (see p318), on the track to Merzouga
times, in small towns that 
have a limited number of 
hotels (particularly in the 
South) it can be quite  
impossible to find a room. 
This can also happen in 
towns with a much larger 
choice of hotels, such as  
Marrakech or Fès.
 At these busy times, it is 
essential to make a reserva-
tion in advance. This can  
be done at a travel agency, 
through a tour operator  
covering Morocco or by  
contacting hotels directly. 
When making a direct  
booking, you will be asked  
to quote the number of your 
credit card so as to confirm 
the reservation. Doing this  
is usually quite safe, even 
though it is best to deal only 
with large establishments or 
with hotels belonging to a 
reputable chain.
 One consequence of the 
European-style hotel manage-
ment that has taken root in 
Morocco is the practice of 
overbooking. Put simply, the 
hotel accepts more reserva-
tions than it has rooms so as 
to compensate for any cancel-
lations. Unfortunately, if you 
happen to be a victim of this 
practice, there is little that you 
can do. The best way to try to 
avoid this happening is to pay

CHAIN AND  
LUXURY HOTELS
Such leading international 
hotel chains as Hyatt and  
Le Méridien have many estab-
lishments in Morocco. The 
Ibis group manages several 
hotels belonging to the  
Moussafir chain. The Mahd 
Salam chain owns hotels 
throughout the country built 
in the traditonal Moroccan 
architectural style. Discounts 
are available when you book 
in advance through the Mahd 
Salam chain and also through 
the Kenzi chain in Paris.
 There is a large number  
of luxury hotels in Morocco. 
Although many of them are 
modern, the country also 
boasts a few old legendary 
establishments, such as  
La Mamounia in Marrakech 
(see p316), which, although 
it has lost some of its appeal 
as a result of the most recent 
phase of renovation, still has 
a great atmosphere. The  
Sofitel Jamaï Palais in Fès 
(see p310), converted from a 
former palace, is not only an 
architectural marvel but has a 
unique location above the 
medina. The El-Minzah in 
Tangier (see p308) looks like 
something from a film set 
and, although it is showing  
its age, is still one of  
Morocco’s great hotels.
Often, when travelling in the 
Atlas, visitors will be offered 
accommodation, rather than 
be left to camp in the open. 
In such cases, you may be 
offered space in a living room, 
or on the roof of a pisé house, 
which can be a magical  
experience. The owner of the 
house (often the village chief) 
will steadfastly refuse money, 
and will even invite you to 
share a meal. You can always 
offer a gift, or deal with the 
women of the house, who 
will often accept remuneration 
or a present for their children.
YOUTH HOSTELS
There are several youth  
hostels in Morocco, and these 
make it possible to stay in the 
country for a minimal cost. 
However, most youth hostels 
are not centrally located and 
are quite basic, although they 
are usually clean. If you do 
not have an international 
Youth Hostel Association 
membership card, you may 
be asked to pay a little extra. 
The easiest way to obtain a 
card is to join your country’s 
youth hostel association, such 
as the YHA in Britain or the 
HI-AYH in the United States. 
Information in Morocco is 
available from the Fédération 
Royale Marocaine des  
Auberges de Jeunesse in 
Casablanca.
UNMARRIED COUPLES
It is as well to know that in 
Morocco strict rules apply  
to the accommodation of  
couples. A Muslim cannot 
sleep with a woman if the 
couple are not married. Some 
hoteliers respect scrupulously 
CAMPSITES
Campsites can be 
found in every large 
town, and they are 
very numerous on 
the Atlantic and  
Mediterranean coasts. 
As a general rule, 
standards of cleanli-
ness in campsites 
leave much to be 
desired, and it is not 
safe to leave property 
unattended in tents. 
Staying in a campsite 
in Morocco is also 
something that best 
suits those who are 
not too fussy about 
hygiene and facilities.
 
Finding your own 
place to set up camp 
outside official sites  
is not officially 
unlawful, but it  
is definitely not  
recommended for reasons of 
personal safety and because 
the authorities do not like 
tourists camping anywhere 
they please.
GUESTHOUSES
In small seaside villages, 
where it is sometimes very 
difficult to find accom-
modation, many Moroccans 
offer rooms to let in their 
own houses. Comforts are 
often basic and, before 
accepting the room, it is  
wise to check the cleanliness 
of the bedclothes and that  
toilets and washing facilities 
are in working order.
 Guesthouse accommodation 
can be a useful option when 
you are staying for a few days 
away from the large tourist 
coastal resorts.

this ruling. Allowances are 
normally made for Western 
couples, however, except by 
particularly strict hotel keepers.
DISABLED VISITORS
Apart from certain recently 
built hotels, no establishment 
in Morocco is equipped for 
disabled visitors. Nevertheless, 
Moroccans are very well  
disposed to anyone needing 
help, so that people with  
disabilities will be pleasantly 
surprised at the thoughtful-
ness and helpfulness that  
they encounter in Morocco.
RIADS
The literal translation of the 
Arabic word riad is “garden”. 
Thus a riad should consist, 
theoretically, of a garden 
planted with trees. By  
extension, the word riad is 
applied to all old houses that 
have at least a patio or court-
yard. These old-style Moroccan 
houses can be found in the 
medinas, and many have 
become available to visitors, 
especially in Marrakech, Fès 
and Essaouira.
 These traditional residences 
each have their own parti-
cular architectural design  
While some riads are run by 
people who have only a vague 
idea of the hotel business, others 
are out of the ordinary. Into 
this category come La Villa des 
Orangers and La Maison Arabe, 
both in Marrakech (see p316). 
These riads will delight those 
who love old buildings as 
well as visitors who expect  
a high standard of service.
 Riads can be booked 
through Riads au Maroc, 
Marrakech-Medina and 
Fès Medina Morocco (US 
based). Of the agencies that 
handle the booking of riads, 
however, not all are reputable, 
some of them merely making 
the most of the popularity of 
this type of accommodation.
and have usually been very 
well restored. Converted into 
guesthouse accommodation, 
they are very pleasant places 
to stay in, particularly because 
they are quiet and because of 
their often excellent location. 
By contrast to a large inter-
national hotel, staying in a  
riad is usually an experience 
that will transport you to 
another age.
 Either individual rooms or 
the whole riad can be rented, 
and many also offer breakfast 
and an evening meal. No  
official grading applies to this 
type of accommodation, and 
standards, service and prices 
vary widely according to the 
individual riad.

n Morocco, cooking is an 
integral part of the art of 
living. Since this is also a 
country with a large number 
of restaurants, the choice of 
what and where to eat is  
boundless. Prices vary widely 
from one place to the next 
and from one town to the next, and tip-
ping is still a well-entrenched custom. 
Although restaurant opening hours  
are similar to those of Western Europe, 
they may change during Ramadan.  
Religious strictures also mean 
that establishments serving 
alcohol are relatively rare and 
tightly regulated.
Restaurants span the full 
range, from the smartest, 
with international cuisine, to 
the more modest, which offer 
delicious Moroccan dishes. Finally, 
there are the little stalls that are found 
on every street corner or on the quay 
in harbours, which serve freshly cooked 
fish and other succulent treats.
TYPES OF RESTAURANT
In large towns and cities in 
Morocco you will find every 
kind of restaurant. At one end 
of the scale are modest street 
stalls and small bistros; at the 
other are classic restaurants 
and prestigious gastronomic 
establishments. Athough, in 
this bracket, French and  
Italian establishments pre-
dominate, these restaurants 
enable you to sample  
specialities from all over the 
world. Fast-food outlets are 
also becoming ubiquitous, 
particularly in city centres.
 In medium-sized towns,  
the choice is more limited, 
with relatively basic establish-
ments offering mostly local 
specialities. In small seaside 
towns, fish restaurants are 
particularly numerous.
 Restaurants serving typically 
Moroccan food are, in fact, 
comparatively rare. They can 
be roughly divided into two 
types: “tourist” restaurants, 
which cater for groups and 
restaurants like to serve their 
customers outdoors, setting 
out tables in a quiet and 
pleasantly shaded courtyard, 
in the corner of a garden or 
even on the pavement  
outside the restaurant.
MOROCCAN  
SPECIALITIES
Although Morocco is well 
provided with restaurants 
offering international  
specialities, it is essential  
to sample Moroccan cuisine 
(see pp324–5), which is by  
far the best food that is  
served in the country.
 A traditional Moroccan meal 
begins with a large number of 
starters, consisting of salad, or 
vegetables flavoured with  
different kinds of spices. Then 
follows the main course, often 
couscous or tajine(see p325).
 Tajine is a kind of stew made 
with fish, chicken, beef or 
lamb, and may include prunes 
or almonds. There is a great 
variety of tajines, which differ 
according to the region, and it 
is hardly an exaggeration to say 
which sometimes put on 
shows such as fantasias  
(see pp34–5), and higher-class 
restaurants, such as those in 
Fès or Marrakech. These are 
more like tables d’hôte in old 
traditional residences. The 
prices that they charge are 
higher (400 to 600 dirhams in 
the most renowned establish-
ments), but you will enjoy a 
more refined cuisine and a 
more authentic atmosphere.
 Given the pleasantly warm 
climate in Morocco, many

that there are almost as many 
variations as there are cooks. 
All, however, are prepared 
and served in a terracotta  
dish with a conical lid; this 
cooking vessel is called a 
tajine, hence the dish’s name.
 Moroccan desserts,  
especially milk pastilla, are 
mouth-watering. Meals are 
usually eaten with mint tea, 
although more and more  
restaurants now offer wine.
OPENING HOURS  
AND RESERVATIONS
In most restaurants, lunch is 
served between noon and 
3pm and dinner between 7pm 
and 10.30pm. However, during 
the fast of Ramadan (see p41), 
many restaurants, especially 
the less expensive ones, will 
not open at lunchtime.
 In very fashionable restau-
rants, particularly those in the 
centre of the largest towns 
and cities, it is advisable  
for large parties to make a 
reservation, especially on 
Thursdays, Fridays and  
on Saturday evenings.
 Reservation is absolutely 
essential for the tables d’hôte 
in Marrakech and Fès. Here  
it is often necessary to reserve 
several days in advance, since 
space can be limited, as  
can the number of sittings 
each evening.
PRICES AND TIPPING
Prices vary widely according 
to a restaurant’s quality. They 
may range from 60 dirhams 
for a basic meal to about  
200 dirhams for a meal with 
wine in a classic establish-
ment, and between 250 and 
600 dirhams in a high-class 
restaurant. Prices are higher 
served alcohol in an  
unlicensed restaurant since 
not serving alcohol may be 
the manager’s deliberate  
policy. During Ramadan, 
some restaurants that  
normally serve alcohol  
close or stop serving it.
DRESS
Even though it is the  
custom to eat out of doors, 
Moroccans usually dress  
quite smartly when they go 
out to eat. Restaurants never 
insist on a particular type of 
dress. The only exception  
is in a few very high-class 
establishments, where  
gentlemen will be expected 
to wear a tie, or where ties 
will be lent. It is best to avoid 
too relaxed a style of dress, 
and very revealing clothes, 
such as beachwear, are likely 
to be considered offensive.
STREET STALLS
Stalls selling cheap food  
are seen everywhere in 
Morocco. Typical dishes  
are soup, skewered meat  
or fish and sandwiches.
 At dusk, Place Jemaa el- 
Fna in Marrakech (see p234) 
turns into a huge open-air 
restaurant. In coastal towns 
and villages, usually on the 
quays of harbours where  
fishing boats come in, trestle 
tables serving freshly cooked 
seafood are often set up.
 Although the food served 
from stalls is usually fresh, it 
is best to single out those that 
are the most popular with 
Moroccans. This is the best 
indication of good quality.
in large towns and cities and 
in places that attract many 
foreign visitors, such as  
Casablanca, Agadir and  
Marrakech. Prices given  
on menus usually include 
service and tax, so that 
unpleasant surprises are rare.
 Tipping is a widely  
accepted custom in Morocco. 
It is customary to give 5 to  
10 per cent of the bill. The tip 
should be in cash, and should 
be left on the table when you 
leave the restaurant. Do not 
add it to the total when you 
pay by cheque or bankers’ 
card since the waiters will  
not receive it.
ALCOHOLIC DRINKS
Morocco is a Muslim country 
where stringent laws apply  
to the sale of alcohol.  
However, most restaurants 
from a certain level upwards 
have a license to serve  
alcohol, as do Moroccan  
restaurants with a largely 
Western clientele.
 Unlicensed restaurants  
may sometimes serve wine 
discreetly. Visitors should  
not, however, insist on being

MOROCCAN DISHES AND SPECIALITIES
A restaurant meal in Morocco will  
typically start with a full-flavoured 
soup, such as harira, a comforting 
soup of diced lamb, lentils and 
chickpeas with tomato, onion, 
coriander and parsley, or a 
selection of vibrant salads.  
A tagine is a common main 
course, served with flat bread 
(matlouh). The meat and  
vegetables are flavoured with 
saffron, garlic, coriander and cumin. 
Garnishes include olives, eggs, mint 
and preserved lemons. Another main 
course is couscous. Made with vegetables, chicken, lamb, 
merguez, rabbit, or even fish, it is usually served with a 
hot sauce made from harissa and tomato purée.
The Flavours of Morocco
From the indigenous, rural Berber people come the basics 
of Moroccan cuisine, such as couscous, but Moroccan 
food owes much to influences from neighbouring lands. 
In the 1600s the Arabs introduced bread, pulses and  
spices, notably chickpeas (garbanzos), cinnamon,  
ginger, saffron and tumeric, from their empire in the 
East. In the 11th century Bedouin tribes brought dates 
and milk from their wandering flocks. The Arabs 
returned from Andalusia with produce such as olives 
and lemons, and, later, tomatoes and peppers from  
the Americas.
T R A V E L L E R S ’  N E E D S

Harira, a meal-like soup, is a 
dish traditionally served at 
sunset during Ramadan, in 
order to break the fast.
MEAT
Lamb is the cornerstone of 
Moroccan cookery, and is 
found in the form of grills, 
merguez (thin, spicy red  
sausages) and brochettes 
(skewers); in tagines or a 
couscous; and roasted whole 
on a spit with aromatics as 
the traditional m’choui.  
You will also find beef on 
the menu, usually served as 
kebabs, as well as rabbit, 
served as a couscous or  
tagine. Chicken and turkey 
are also readily available. 
Pigeon is more rarely on the 
menu these days, but is still 
a feature of b’stilla. This 
extravagant pie, a speciality 
of Fès, is made with tissue-
thin warkha pastry. Offal, 
such as brains, heart, liver 
and tripe, are also popular.
FISH & SEAFOOD
Morocco has long coasts on 
the Atlantic and the Medi-
terranean, which provide  
a wide variety of seafood.  
Fish such as bream and bass 
are typically marinated in a 
garlicky, spicy mixture called 
chermoula, and are usually 
cooked whole. They may 
also be served stuffed, with 
an almond crust, as steaks or 
brochettes, or as fishcakes,

VEGETABLES
Morocco has many inventive 
and refreshing salad dishes. 
Often served as a starter, they 
include mezgaldi, which 
combines onions with  
saffron, ginger, cinnamon, 
sugar and celery. Aubergines 
(eggplants) are ubiquitous, 
served as a salad, fried or 
stuffed. Combinations of 
tomatoes, green peppers, hot 
red or sweet red peppers 
and red onions, all add  
colour and flavour to the 
table. Olives and their oil are 
abundant, and nutty argan oil 
is widely used. (Goats adore 
the outer pulp of the nut, 
and can be seen “grazing” in 
the branches of argan trees.)
FRUIT
Most Moroccan meals end 
with a dish of fruit, often a 
simple sliced-orange salad, 
sprinkled with cinnamon and 
orange-flower water, and 
sometimes chopped dates 
and almonds. Other common 
fruits include peaches, figs, 
melons, bananas, plums, 
pomegranates and all types 
of citrus fruits. Lemons,  
preserved in brine, add 
piquancy to many dishes.
SPICES & FLAVOURINGS
Key Moroccan spices include 
aniseed, black pepper, cay-
enne, cardamom, cinnamon, 
coriander, cumin, ginger, 
paprika, parsley, saffron and 
turmeric. Three spice blends 
are important: chermoula, 
for marinades; harissa, a hot 
red pepper condiment; and 
ras el hanout (“top of the 
shop”), a blend of over 20 
spices, used in tagines.

What to Drink in Morocco
Green mint tea is the national drink in Morocco. 
It is served several times a day at home, in the 
office, in shops and on café terraces. Moroccans 
are also very fond of coffee, which is usually 
served with milk but may sometimes be  
flavoured with cinnamon, orange-flower water 
or a few grains of pepper. Freshly squeezed 
orange juice is delicious, as are all fruit juices – 
cherry, grape and pomegranate being the most 
widely available choices. Although the Koran 
forbids the consumption of alcohol, fairly good-
quality wines are produced in Morocco, and 
these can be bought in certain shops.

COLD DRINKS
Although lemonade and cola  
are sold on every street corner, 
freshly squeezed orange juice  
is the real Moroccan speciality.  
It is absolutely delicious, so  
long as it is served undiluted. 
The sweet, juicy and famously 
flavoursome Moroccan oranges 
can be seen laid 
out for sale  
everywhere, piled 
up in glossy  
pyramids on  
barrows and on market stalls. 
On Place Jemaa el-Fna in  
Marrakech (see p234), they  
are almost a sideshow in  
themselves. Almond milk, 
banana milk, apple juice  
and pomegranate juice are  
also popular drinks.
TEA
Known for 3,000 years in China, green tea, 
with long fine leaves, reached Morocco in 
1854. It was introduced by the British, and 
immediately became popular in every  
Moroccan home. All over Morocco, from  
the sophisticated town house to the simple 
nomad’s tent, green mint tea has become  
the national drink. This thirst-
quenching drink, which is made 
with varying amounts of sugar 
and mint, is a symbol of hospi-
tality, and it is considered very 
ill-mannered to refuse it.
 The tea ceremony is almost 
always performed in front  
of guests and according to 
immutable rules. Mint tea  
is always served in small,  
slender glasses decorated with 
a gold or coloured filigree  
pattern. The tea leaves are 
rinsed in the scalded teapot so as to remove 
their excessive bitterness. Whole mint leaves, 
complete with stems, are then added,  
together with large lumps of sugar, which 
prevent the leaves from rising to the surface. 
After being left for a few minutes to infuse, a 
little tea is poured into a glass and returned 
to the pot. This is repeated several times. 
The host finally tastes the tea, which will  
not be served to guests until  
it is deemed to be perfect.

COFFEE
Although it is less widely drunk than tea, 
Moroccans are also fond of coffee, which 
they like to drink very strong. It is accceptable 
to ask for a little boiling water with which to 
dilute it. Unless you request otherwise, your 
coffee will automatically be served with milk. 
A black coffee is a qahwa kahla; a noss noss 
is half coffee and half milk; and café cassé 
consists of more coffee than milk.

MINERAL WATER
Although the tap water in towns is safe to 
drink, it tastes strongly of chlorine. Mineral 
water – such as Sidi Ali and Sidi Harazem, 
which are still, and Oulmès and San Pellegrino, 
which are sparkling – is much more palatable.
MOROCCAN WINES
Wine has been produced in Morocco  
since Roman times, and local wine  
production was encouraged during the  
Protectorate. The country has three major 
wine-producing areas: around Oujda, in the 
northeast, in the Fès and Meknès area, and 
in the west, between Rabat and Casablanca.
 The most popular wines include red and 
white Médaillon, red, white and rosé Siroua, 
and the higher-quality wines produced by 
the winemakers Celliers de Meknès: Merlot 
and Cabernet Sauvignon; Sémillant, a fruity, 
dry white wine, and two rosé wines – Gris 
de Guerouane and Gris de Boulaouane.  
Also produced are Aït Soual, Vieux-Papes, 
Oustalet, Valpierre, Chaud-Soleil and Spécial 
BEER AND SPIRITS
All kinds of imported alcoholic drinks can  
be purchased in supermarkets. Flag Spéciale 
is a light ale brewed in Tangier and  
Casablanca. Stork is brewed in Casablanca. 
Mahia is a Moroccan fig distillation, 40 per 
cent proof. The sale of  
wine and other alcohol is 
forbidden to Muslims during 
Ramadan and after 7.30pm.

out according to the type of goods 
that they sell. Traders are friendly 
and always ready to please their 
customers. The rich and diverse 
range of Moroccan crafts can be 
found in the country’s souks and 
markets, as well as at cooperative 
craft outlets and specialist shops, and 
are also offered for sale by the roadside 
along tourist routes.
OPENING HOURS
Country souks take place  
only in the morning. Grocers’ 
shops, local supermarkets and 
butchers’ shops are open 
every weekday from 8am  
to 9pm, although they close 
for about two hours in the 
middle of the day. Some may 
also open on Sundays, when 
different opening hours apply. 
Friday is theoretically a day  
of rest for Muslims; however, 
business goes on as normal, 
although some larger shops 
close in the middle of the 
day. During Ramadan,  
grocers’ shops open late in 
the morning, close for part  
of the day and then open 
from the evening until very 
late. Shops run by Jews close 
on Saturdays (the Sabbath). In 
large towns and cities, clothes 
shops and fabric shops open 
from 9am to noon and from 
3pm to 7pm. They do not 
open on Sundays. The  
hypermarkets that have 
sprung up in some large 
towns are open from 9am  
to 9pm seven days a week.
METHODS OF PAYMENT
Credit cards are accepted  
only in large towns and cities 
and in modern shops. Some 
shopkeepers will add a  
percentage as tax onto the 
total automatically if you 
choose this form of payment. 
Also, credit card slips can be 
pre-dated or printed twice 
without your knowing. It  
is best, therefore, to carry  
sufficient amounts of cash 
before setting off on a  
shopping spree.
FOOD STORES
All towns are very well pro-
vided with grocers’ shops. In 
villages, the grocer’s is the 
only place, apart from the 
weekly souk, where people 
can buy provisions and  
essential items.
 These shops are usually no 
bigger than a large cupboard. 
They are fitted with shelves 
from floor to ceiling, and 
offer all kinds of foods and 
household goods. It is wise  
to avoid buying perishable 
items such as yoghurt and 
milk, since there is no  
guarantee that they are  
fresh. In butchers’ shops, 
what is on offer is neither 
labelled nor priced. Fruit and 
vegetable shops, dairies and 
bakers are found only in large 
towns. Although French bread 
was introduced during the 
Protectorate, Moroccans  
prefer kesra, a round loaf 
baked at home or in the local 
communal oven.
 A few charcuteries, selling 
cooked meats, have appeared 
in Casablanca, Rabat and  
Marrakech but they are 
geared to an exclusively  
Western clientele, pork  
being forbidden to Muslims. 
By using a local supermarket, 
you can check the sell-by

essential everyday items.

they are marked, that is). 
Imported foods can also  
be bought in supermarkets.
 Hypermarket chains  
were set up in Morocco  
several years ago. There  
are branches of Marjane  
in Casablanca, Rabat,  
Marrakech and Agadir.
MARKETS
All large towns have several 
markets that supply fresh  
fruit and vegetables to the 
population every day of the 
year. In every market there is 
a fresh herb stall and a spice 
and olive stall. Household 
utensils, basketry and craft 
items are also on sale.
 In the harbours along  
the Atlantic coast, particularly 
in the towns of Oualidia,  
Safi, Essaouira and Agadir,  
the fruits of the daily  
catch – such as sole,  
sardines, perch, shrimps, 
squid and oysters – can  
be eaten on the spot.
SOUKS
For foreign visitors, souks  
are lively and authentic 
expressions of rural life in 
Morocco (see p201), offering 
the opportunity to see a  
fascinating and genuine 
aspect of the country. Taking 
place once a week, souks  
are the focus of economic, 
social and administrative life 
in Morocco’s rural areas. 
Country people come from 
miles around to stock up  
on supplies or to exchange 
agricultural produce (such as 
fruit, vegetables, eggs, butter 
and cereals) or craft items 
(such as pottery and carpets) 
for tea, oil, sugar and spices. 
Also on offer are plastic  
utensils and clothing made  
of synthetic fabrics, along 
with chickens, sheep and 
sometimes mules.
 In the medinas of Rabat, 
Fès, Marrakech and Tarou-
dannt, souks take place 
almost daily. Their location 
and layout are dictated by the 
nature of what they offer. 
More oriented towards tourists 
than are the country souks, 
they offer a huge range of 
craft items from all over 
Morocco. Fassi glazed pottery 
is by no means identical to 
that made in Salé or Safi, and 
it differs from the Berber  
pottery of the Rif or that 
made in Tamegroute. Thuya 
wood (see p122) is a  
speciality of Essaouira; 
Ouaouzguite carpets are 
renowned in Tazenakht; and 
El-Kelaa M’Goun is famous 
for its daggers.
HOW TO BARGAIN
In Morocco, bargaining is  
not so much a custom as a 
duty. Every self-respecting 
Moroccan uses this method, 
even when buying vegetables 
in the souk or renting a hotel 
room. In craft shops, no  
prices are marked and the 
shopkeeper considers it quite 
natural that potential clients 
should bargain over 
the price. When a 
potential customer 
shows an interest, the 
shop-owner will quote 
an initial price, which 
often bears no relation 
to the real price of the 
object in question but 
which tests the buyer’s 
willingness to make a 
counter-offer.
 In order to bargain 
effectively, it is

important to know  
the value of what you wish  
to buy or at least to have a 
price in mind beyond which 
you will not go. By contrast, 
if you refuse to raise your 
offer sufficiently to allow  
the seller to make a profit,  
he will not pursue the  
transaction. The real purpose 
of bargaining is to obtain the 
desired object while feigning 
indifference. This is why  
bargaining takes time and 
should be a subtle game 
between buyer and seller.
FORGERIES
Souks in medinas and in 
Morocco’s major tourist  
centres offer “authentic” 
goods of dubious quality and 
origin, and for very inflated 
prices. You are advised to  
be on your guard against 
goods that, contrary to what 
the seller may assure you,  
are often no more than  
skilfully concocted and  
very convincing forgeries.

What to Buy in Morocco
Souks in Morocco present the visitor with a 
vast choice of jewellery, leather goods, 
wrought-iron work, brass and copper, 
pottery, carpets, basketry and fabrics. 
But the quantity, colours and sheer 
diversity of the items on offer can  
be bewildering and it can be difficult  
to distinguish quality pieces from inferior ones. Before 
deciding to buy, it is best to take some time to compare 
what is on offer in different shops. Country craft items 
offered for sale in markets are genuine and utilitarian, 
ranging from the baskets carried by donkeys and combs 
for carding wool to terracotta coolers for keeping milk 
or dried meat fresh.
CERAMICS
The place of origin of ceramics  
can be identified by their colours 
and decoration. Pottery from  
Fès is the most refined, that  
from Salé is glazed in pale colours, 
and that from Safi features  
polychrome colours and Berber 
motifs. Recently, potters have been 
devising new designs, such as that 
on the vase shown on the left.
WOOD AND STONE CARVING
Fès, Tetouan and Azrou are renowned for their carved cedar. In 
Essaouira, craftsmen work with thuya wood (see p122), making 
boxes in various shapes, statues, trays, frames and other pieces. 
In Taroudannt, objects are carved from soft stone, and in  
Erfoud trinkets and other small items are fashioned from marble.

CLOTHING
Jellabas, loose-fitting hooded cloaks with  
long sleeves, and gandouras, tunics with 
short sleeves, can be purchased in souks. 
Burnouses, hooded woollen cloaks, are seen 
in rural areas. Embroi-
dered silk belts, tradi-
tionally made in Fès, 
are highly sought-after 
but are increasingly 
difficult to find.
SILVER
Silver is the predominant material of Berber  
jewellery. The most common items are brooches, 
which Berber women wear in pairs, to secure 
their veils at each shoulder. The shape and  
decoration of brooches varies  
according to the region.
METALWARE
Wrought iron, brown-hued copper, bright yellow brass 
(a mixture of copper and zinc) and nickel silver (a  
mixture of copper, zinc and nickel) are the main  
materials used in  
Moroccan metalware. 
The finest pieces are 
engraved or damas-
cened (inlaid with 
contrasting metal).

Moroccan Carpets
There are as many different types of carpets 
in Morocco as there are tribal traditions. 
Moroccan carpets can, however, be divided 
into two main groups: Berber carpets 
and city carpets. The former are 
either knotted or woven; they are 
pleasingly unrefined and each one 
is unique. Their wool, which the 
women weave into simple or 
complex patterns, their harmonious 
colours, their shape and size, and also their 
patterns, vary from one region to another. 
City carpets, influenced by Oriental tradi-
tions, are finer. Symbols of luxury, they 
grace the living rooms of wealthy houses.

The fringe, at one end of the

Atlas, featuring a combination of strict  
geometric and random motifs. These  
carpets are well suited to use in tents or for 
covering the beaten earth floors of houses.
Carpet from the High Atlas, in which woven 
bands alternate with knotted bands. The  
well-ordered geometric motifs feature  
lozenges, triangles and broken lines.
CARPET WEAVING
After the men have 
sheared the sheep in 
the spring, the women 
wash the wool and 
carefully pick over it.  
It is then carded, a 
process by which the 
strands are untangled 
by brushing with comb-
like implements. Next, the wool is spun 
into yarn with a small spindle. Either in its 
natural colour or after it has been dyed, the 
wool is then ready to be woven. Berber 
women knot carpets on large, rudimentary 
looms consisting of two wooden vertical 
and two horizontal planks. The warp is set 
up by threading vertical strands vertically 
on the loom. These determine the length 
and thickness of the carpet. The weft (the 
horizontal threads) are threaded by hand 
between the strands of the warp, the 
weaver working row by row, pressing  
the weave together with an iron comb.
BERBER CARPETS
Most of the carpets made in Tazenaght and  
Taliouine, in the High Atlas, are made by the 
Ouaouzguite tribe. These carpets are typically 
long, narrow and supple, and thus well suited  
to use in the interiors of kasbahs in the Atlas.

CITY CARPETS
Woven in Rabat, Salé and Casablanca, city  
carpets are perfectly symmetrical. They  
feature floral and geometric motifs and  
are edged with borders of differing widths.
Mediouna carpets, made in Casablanca, feature 
shades of brick red or soft pink, and always have 
a lozenge-shaped or star-shaped central motif.
Haouz carpets, made in 
Marrakech, are knotted. 
They are characterized by  
a background scattered 
with naive motifs.
Middle Atlas carpets have 
a woollen pile. The exact 
outlines of the pattern can 
be seen only on their 
smooth side.
Dyes are traditionally 
obtained from vegetable 
extracts but are now very 
often supplemented by 
synthetic dyes.
BUYING A CARPET
Colour and pattern are the primary con-
siderations when buying a carpet. Then 
come the material, the carpet’s softness, 
the density of the weave or knotting,  
and condition. A good-quality carpet  
has clearly defined motifs and perfectly 
straight edges. The value of a carpet is 
based on the number of knots per row 
and the density of the warp and weft. 
Some carpets have up to 380,000 knots 
per square metre (11 sq ft) and official 
price bands per square metre apply.  
Carpets checked by the Ministry of Crafts 
are hallmarked with the date that they 
were checked, their provenance and their 
quality. An orange label indicates extra-
superior quality; a blue label, superior 
quality; a yellow label, medium quality, 
and green label, ordinary quality. Once  
the carpet has been unrolled in front of 
you, you can start to bargain (see p345).

ost nightlife in Morocco 
takes place in the large  
towns and cities. Inter-
national tourism and the 
desire for modernity on the 
part of the younger gene-
ration have both contributed 
to the development of cen-
tres of culture and entertainment. These 
are often the best places to meet young 
Moroccans. The number of fashionable 
bars and nightclubs is increasing, 
too, while Morocco’s thriving 
cultural life ensures a wide 
variety of entertainment.  
Certain private art galleries 
showcase the country’s artis-
tic talent. The many feast days 
and moussems (pilgrimage 
festivals) provide opportunities to 
watch shows that are more authentically 
Moroccan than those aimed at tourists.
CINEMAS
Taking up the threads 
of the movie culture 
that the country 
enjoyed in the 1950s, 
when Moroccans had 
the privilege of seeing 
early screenings of 
many American  
productions, Moroccan 
cinemas are enjoying a 
new lease of life as is, 
to a certain extent, the 
new Moroccan film 
industry. Authentically 
restored auditoriums 
dating from the 1940s 
have reopened,  
particularly in  
Casablanca. The main 
cinemas in Rabat are 
the Renaissance and 
the Salle du 7eme 
Art. In Casablanca there are 
the Rialto, the Lynx and the 
new Megarama; in Fès the 
Empire and the Rex; and, 
in Marrakech, the Colisée 
and the new Megarama. 
In Tangier, the leading  
cinemas are Le Paris and 
the Rif with the new 
Cinémathèque de Tanger.

Casablanca’s cinemas
But if you don’t understand 
French or Arabic, this might 
not be your first choice of 
entertainment since almost  
all films are dubbed in 
French, or are in Arabic.
 Daily local newspapers  
provide information on  
what is showing, or you  
can phone the cinemas  
themselves. The cultural  
institutes in various cities 
(see p352) are also good 
sources of information.
THEATRES
Morocco is not well endowed 
with theatres. They are found 
only in the cities, and  
productions are usually  
limited and irregular.  
Nevertheless, foreign  
theatrical companies perform 
in Morocco, and efforts are 
being made to launch the 
Moroccan theatre, which  
is still in its infancy.
 Although theatre listings  
are usually given in the  
daily press, it is best to  
obtain information directly 
from the theatres or from  
cultural institutions.
INFORMATION SOURCES
Scanning the entertainment 
section of various newspapers 
(entitled “Spectacles” in 
Francophone publications)  
is the best way of checking 
what’s on, even though they 
give such information only 
very irregularly.
 The main daily newspapers 
are El-Bayane, Le Matin du 
Sahara, L’Opinion and 
Libération. Weeklies include 
Le Magazine and Tel Quel. 
Monthly magazines, such  
as Femmes du Maroc and 
Citadine, or the fortnightly 
Medina, carry listings of 
cultural events. These  
publications are available 
from kiosks as well as in  
most tobacconists.
 There are no good sources 
of entertainment information 
available in English.

FEAST DAYS AND 
FESTIVALS
Prominent among the many 
feast days that punctuate the 
year (see pp38–41) are the 
moussems. These large popular 
gatherings usually focus on the 
tomb of a saint (see pp198–9), 
and are spectacular shows with 
traditional dance performances.
 Certain festivals, such as the 
Marrakech Folk Festival in June, 
draw dancers and musicians 
from all over Morocco, and 
the Gnaoua Music Festival in 
Essaouira, also in June, offers 
high-quality performances. 
Other festivals include the 
Sacred World Music Festival 
held in Fès in June and the 
Rabat Cultural Festival in July. 
Fantasias (pp34–5) are typically 
high-spirited Moroccan shows. 
They are performed most 
famously at the moussem of 
Moulay Abdallah, which takes 
place near El-Jadida in August.
 The types of dances vary be-
tween the different Berber and 
rural tribes. Often performed 
are the ahouach of the High 
Atlas and Ouarzazate, and the 
ahidou of the Middle Atlas, in 
which men and women take 
part. The guedra, a dance from 
the Guelmim and Sahara, is 
performed by one woman 
within a circle of musicians.
SHOWS AND CONCERTS
Large hotels often organize 
Moroccan evenings giving  
visitors a chance to see 
authentic popular perfor-
mances of music and dance.
 Certain restaurants also  
put on performances of folk 
dance in the evenings. At 
Chez Ali in Marrakech, on 
certain evenings guests are 
served their meal in a tent 
while a fantasia is performed.

Those interested in hearing 
Moroccan music can choose 
between raï, which has 
roots in Bedouin music  
and whose star performer is 
Cheb Amrou; Gnaoua music, 
which Mustapha Baqbou has 
taken to many European jazz 
festivals; and the nostalgic 
chants of Andalusian music. 
Many such concerts are 
organized by various cultural 
institutes. Ask the local tourist 
office for information.

CULTURAL CENTRES
Among the most dynamic  
cultural centres in Morocco 
are the French Cultural 
Institutes, which are found 
in major cities. These  
organize a wide-ranging  
programme, including exhi-
bitions, film festivals high- 
lighting the work of particular 
directors, as well as concerts 
and theatrical performances. 
The remarkably well laid-  
out Institut Français de 
Marrakech even has an 
amphitheatre for open-air 
performances. The Spanish 
Instituto Cervantes and the 
German Goethe Institut also 
contribute to the promotion 
of the artistic activity of the 
multiple cultures that coexist 
in Morocco.
 These centres are good 
places to meet Moroccans 
who have an interest in 
Europe. Programmes in the 
form of a bimonthly pamphlet 
are available on the premises. 
The British Council in Rabat 
also organizes an interesting 
range of events.
ART GALLERIES
Since the Dane Frederic 
Damgaard (see p124), 
opened an art gallery in 
Essaouira in 1988, the artistic 
world in Morocco has 
enjoyed a new dynamism. 
Galleries exhibit the work  
of painters from far and  
wide, including, for example, 
that of the well-known  
“free artists of Essaouira” 
(see p125).
 Galleries in Casablanca 
include the Villa des Arts, 
an extensive showcase of 
Moroccan artistic creativity 
The Villa des Arts in Casablanca
of Gueliz’s villas. In Essaouira, 
Fès, Ouarzazate, Rabat and 
Tangier, it is mostly in hotel 
bars that music can be heard. 
The best approach is to 
obtain information directly 
from the various bars and 
hotels themselves.
NIGHTCLUBS
Except in Casablanca,  
Rabat and Marrakech, most 
nightclubs in Morocco are 
located within hotels. In 
Rabat, one of the most  
fashionable discos is 
L’Amnesia. In Casablanca, 
nightclubs are concentrated 
around Aïn-Diab. They 
include La Bodega and the 
Carré Rouge. Theatro at Hôtel 
Essaadi in Marrakech has 
a good reputation, as does  
Le Flamingo in Agadir.
 While discos and nightclubs 
are relatively empty on week-
day nights, all are filled to 
capacity at weekends and 
during school holidays.
 Some close at about 3am  
or 4am. Others stay open 
until dawn, particularly in 
Marrakech, Agadir and other 
large tourist centres.
CASINOS
Gambling is severely frowned 
on by Islam, so that there are 
very few casinos in Morocco. 
The casino in La Mamounia, 
the famous hotel in  
Marrakech (see p314), is 
easily the most prestigious.
 If you decide to spend 
the evening in a casino,  
dress smartly. A jacket is 
essential, and jeans, track-
suits and trainers are  
definitely not acceptable.

PIANO BARS
Places where traditional 
Moroccan music can be heard 
are relatively few. However, 
piano bars in large hotels  
and jazz clubs offer the oppor-
tunity of hearing European 
and North American bands.
 The Amstrong Jazz Bar 
and the Villa Fandango in 
Casablanca, for example, are 
very fashionable. Marrakech 
has several modish venues 
such as the huge Al Anbar, 
whose restaurant contains 
several hundred tables and 
has live orchestras, and the 
Montecristo, which is more 
intimate and is located in one 
Painting by Mohammed Tabal, one 
of Essaouira’s “free artists”
over the last 50 years, and in 
Marrakech the Matisse Arts 
Gallery and Dar Bellarj.

orocco’s mostly warm climate 
and great topographical diver-
sity make it suitable for all  
sorts of sports and outdoor activities. 
The natural environment, often on  
a majestic scale, readily lends itself  
to horseback riding, trekking, bird- 
watching and, in winter, skiing. In areas 
suitably developed for the purpose,  
the Moroccan landscape is also a par-
adise for golfers.
The Atlantic coast is internationally 
renowned for surfing and sailboarding. 
More recently, thalassotherapy (thera-
peutic treatment using sea water and 
marine products) has also developed, 
and thalassotherapy centres continue 
to burgeon in the major tourist centres.
SPORTS & OUTDOOR 
ACTIVITIES
HORSEBACK RIDING
Thanks to the impulse  
provided by King Hassan II, 
horseback riding has become 
very popular in Morocco. 
Many equestrian centres  
have been established, and  
an International Equestrian 
Week takes place every  
year in Dar es-Salam, near 
Rabat, where the Fédération 
Royale Marocaine des Sports 
Equestres is based.
 Most horseback riding is 
organized by clubs and large 
hotels, mainly those in Agadir, 
Marrakech and Ouarzazate. 
All equestrian centres are 
staffed by instructors with 
state-approved qualifications.
SKIING
Although not primarily a winter 
sports destination, Morocco has 
several high-altitude resorts, 
including Ifrane (see p212), 
near Fès, and Oukaïmeden (see 
p248), 60 km (37 miles) from 
Marrakech. Oukaïmeden can 
be reached by grand taxi for a 
one-way fare of about 400 
dirhams. Although the resort is 
small, it is equipped with all 
the necessary facilities, includ-
ing ski-lifts located near where 
ski equipment is hired.  
Hiring equipment for a day 
costs about 250 dirhams. Skiers 
can sleep in one of several 
gîtes. These elegant rest-houses 
are built in a combined  
European and traditional 
Moroccan style. There are not 
many areas of the country that 
are suitable for skiing, so this 
remains a marginal activity in 
Morocco. Mountain resorts 
offer a diverse range of  
activities, however, including 
hang gliding, hiking and  
trekking (see pp356–7). 
Fédération Royale Marocaine 
de Ski et Montagne can 
provide further information.
GOLF
Many overseas travel agents 
offer packaged golfing  
holidays. There are over 20 
golf links in Morocco. Many 
are pleasant and popular. In  
addtion, there are the royal golf 
courses (which are open to the 
public) and numerous private 
courses, often forming part of 
hotel complexes, particularly in 
Agadir and Marrakech.
 In April, the height of the 
holiday season, visitors are 
advised to book in advance 
so as to avoid a long wait.  
A handicap is theoretically 
required although in practice 
this is always overlooked.
There are some excellent golf 
coaches in Morocco, and their 
services can be hired for much

less than in Europe and the 
US. The low cost of tuition, 
combined with an often  
outstanding natural environ-
ment, are ideal conditions for 
an introduction to the sport. 
Further information can be 
obtained from the Fédération 
Royale Marocaine de Golf.
TENNIS
Almost all the large hotels 
have tennis courts. The major 
towns and cities are also well 
provided with tennis clubs. 
Most of them have beaten 
earth courts, of which the 
condition can vary. Around 
the courts it is not unusual to 
see young Moroccans, who 
readily offer their services as 
ball boys or tennis partners. 
Many are good players.
BIRD-WATCHING
Morocco offers many  
excellent opportunities for 
bird-watching, and many  
travellers, particularly Britons 
and Americans, tailor their 
visit around this interest.
 The country has a small 
number of bird sanctuaries, 
the most important of them 
being at Souss Massa, south 
of Agadir (see p292), and at 
Moulay Bousselham, north  
of Rabat (see p90). The latter 
attracts large numbers of 
migratory birds, including 
some rare species.
 Unfortunately, these areas 
are being threatened by the 
massive urban development 
that is spreading along the 
Moroccan coastline, despite 
the efforts of associations  
for the protection of birds.
OFF-ROAD DRIVING
Morocco is an excellent  
country for off-road activities, 
either in a four-wheel-drive 
vehicle or on a motorbike. 
The good network of tracks, 
even near large towns, means 
that the hinterland is always 
within easy reach.
 It is, however, advisable to 
check your route thoroughly 
and preferable to travel in 
groups of two or more  
vehicles, since breaking down 
in a remote spot can be a real 
problem. Some areas, parti-
cularly in southern Morocco, 
near the border with Mauri-
tania, are patrolled by the army 
and may be set with land 
mines. It is unwise to venture 
into this territory without the 
help of a reliable guide.
 In Marrakech and Ouarzazate 
quad bikes and go-karts can 
be hired and Wilderness 
Wheels (see p357) organizes 
all-inclusive motorcycle 
excursions into the High Atlas 
mountains and the desert.
WATERSPORTS
For surfers, certain spots 
along Morocco’s Atlantic  
coast are among the best in 
the world. Essaouira and its 
environs are the best-known 
locations, and these are 
Morocco’s windsurfing and 
surfing centres, particularly in 
summer. Most of these places 
are, however, suitable only  
for experienced surfers.  
Strong winds, currents  
and the high Atlantic waves 
are not safe for beginners.
 The best surfing beaches are 
also on the Atlantic coast. In 
summer, the beaches between 
Agadir and Essaouira are  
overrun by surfers from all 
over the world. A particularly 
popular beach is La Madrague, 
near Taghazout, 20 km  
(12 miles) north of Agadir. 
There is also a surfing centre, 
Club Mistral, in Essaouira.
 For less strenuous water-
sports, there are also some 
very fine beaches all along the 
Atlantic and Mediterranean 
coasts. On the Mediterranean 
coast, sailing boats and jet-skis 
can be hired.
 Information on water- 
skiing, which is also available, 
can be obtained from the 
Fédération Royale Marocaine 
de Jet Ski et Ski Nautique.

In the space of a few years, Morocco has 
become a paradise for hikers. The country’s 
spectacular and varied landscape offers  
great scope for hikers and trekkers of all 
abilities. However, any hiking or trekking 
expedition requires preparation. It is  
essential to take proper equipment, and basic safety 
precautions must be observed. Options are many – 
whether to go on an organized or an independent  
trek, and whether or not to have porters: luggage  
carried by mule, camel or vehicle. The most important 
decision is the choice of route through Morocco’s 
numerous and highly diverse geographical regions.
BASIC SAFETY 
PRECAUTIONS
The first consideration is  
your physical condition. You 
must be able to withstand the 
sometimes arduous demands 
of a long trek. Do not venture 
even a little way off the  
beaten track without a  
reliable guide, or unless you 
are on a well-organized trek. 
Never set off alone, and if 
you are not part of an organ-
ized party, inform your next 
of kin or your country’s 
embassy of your intended 
date of return so that  
emergency aid can be sent  
if necessary. The cost of 
mountain rescue in the more 
remote regions of Morocco  
is very high. Check your  
personal insurance to see 
whether it will cover you  
for this type of risk.
 By far the best option is to 
let a specialist agency arrange 
your hike or trek. This may 
be a Western tour operator or 
one of the specialist agencies 
in Morocco. Using their  
infrastructure and logistics 
will give you peace of mind.
EQUIPMENT
The most important piece of 
equipment is a good pair of 
walking boots. Even though 
ordinary trainers may be  
quite adequate for a short 
walk on even ground, a 
strong pair of walking boots 
is essential for longer and 
more demanding walking 
over rough ground.
 As for clothing, strong, 
lightweight fabrics are the 
best choice. Although it rarely 
rains in Morocco, it is prudent 
to pack a rainproof garment 
as well as a few warm 
clothes, since temperatures 
drop quickly at high altitudes. 
Finally, even for a short walk, 
always take enough water, 
and something to eat.
 A first-aid kit is also  
necessary. The minimum that 
it should contain is treatment 
for minor cuts and blisters. 
More adequate first-aid  
equipment will also include 
anti-venom treatment, insect 
repellent, antihistamine 
for allergies, aspirins 
and sunblock cream.
 For nights in a tent 
or in the open air, 
a good-quality 
body-hugging 
sleeping bag is 
recommended. 
Check carefully 
its insulating 
properties, but 
bear in mind 
that you will 
still need a 
light mattress

popular activity in Morocco

to insulate you from cold or 
wet ground.
 Finally, it is the small things 
that can be the most useful. 
Head lamps, for example, 
give you light while also  
leaving your hands free. Also 
remember to pack water- 
purifying tablets, so that  
you can drink from springs 
and refreshing mountain 
streams along the way.
TYPES OF HIKING
Some hikes are organized 
with the advantage of using 
animals to carry equipment. 
Hikes with mules take place 
in the Atlas, a region where 
this animal is particularly at 
home. Further south, camels 
are used to carry luggage  
and food supplies. Caravans 
of camels are a common  
sight here, particularly  
south of Zagora.
 It is also possible to go on 
combined treks, alternating 
walking with mountain  
biking, or with canoeing or 
rafting. Vehicle-assisted treks 
allow greater distances to be

covered. More luggage can 
also be carried, which means 
that camping can be much 
more comfortable.
POPULAR ROUTES
The main regions of Morocco 
that are most suitable for  
trekking and hiking are the 
Atlantic coast; the Middle 
Atlas, High Atlas and Atlantic 
slopes of the Atlas; Jbel  
Sirwa and Jbel Sarhro; the  
valleys of Wadi Draa, Wadi 
Dadès and Wadi Tafilalet;  
and the Saharan provinces  
of the South.
 In the High Atlas, Jbel 
Toubkal, which reaches a 
height of 4,167 m (13,676 ft), 
is the highest point in North 
Africa (see p249). The 
mountain offers great scope 
for hikes. The summit can  
be reached in two days and 
climbing it does not require  
a high level of experience  
as a mountaineer. The only 
disadvantage is the fact that 
this is where most hikers 
come in the high season,  
so you will not be alone.  
The Club Alpin Français 
manages five refuges on  
Jbel Toubkal.
 In the central High Atlas, 
the Aït Bouguemez valley 
(see pp254–7) offers a very 
fine itinerary. The route is not 
very demanding and passes 
through a striking variety of 
different landscapes. This 
expedition to the deep heart 
of Berber country takes five 
to six days, and the starting 
point is Demnate, four hours’ 
drive from Marrakech.
 On the other side of the 
Atlas, there are hikes that 
combine Jbel Sarhro, the  
foothills at the edge of the 
Sahara, and the sublime 
Dadès gorge (see p273), 
one of the great attractions  
of the Moroccan South.
 Many camel treks take  
place southwest of Zagora, 
their ultimate destination 
being Mhamid and Iriki, 
where the first dunes of the 
immense Sahara can be seen. 
Further east, towards Erfoud 
(see p280), the spectacular 
Merzouga dunes (see p281) 
offer many possibilities for 
hikes and camel rides through 
unforgettable scenery.
MARATHON DES SABLES
This long-distance race takes 
place in the Ouarzazate 
region every year. About  
700 competitors from all over 
the world take part. The route 
covers 230 km (143 miles) 
and the race lasts seven days. 
Each competitor carries his  
or her own food and equip-
ment. The Marathon des 
Sables is considered to be  
the most demanding race  
of its kind in the world.

orocco, a country with a 
wide range of attractions, 
receives a large number of 
visitors. Much of its economic 
success is due to tourism. The 
country has a good tourism infra-
structure and tourist offices, both 
at home and abroad. Moroccan 
hotels have undergone major 
restructuring and many regions have 
significantly increased their capacity to 
accommodate visitors. The major 
museums and historic monuments 
have been reorganized so as to 
be seen to their best advantage 
by the maximum number of  
visitors. Customs formalities are 
minimal and while French is the 
most widely spoken foreign lan-
guage, at least the bigger hotels 
and restaurants and all tourist offices 
have English-speaking staff.
WHEN TO GO
Morocco is a relatively  
large country with a varied 
climate, ranging from the  
arid, desert conditions of  
the south to the Mediterran-
ean climate of the north  
(see pp42–3).
 The peak of the tourist  
season in the South, is in 
spring, from March to mid-
May, and, to a lesser extent, 
in the early autumn, in  
September and October.  
At those times, visitors  
can enjoy many hours of  
sunshine and almost no rain.
 Summer is the best time to 
visit the Mediterranean and 
Atlantic coasts. The South  
and the Centre, where the 
heat is then intense, are  
best avoided. Even when  
the winters are mild they are 
still very cold, and snowfall  
at high altitude, which can 
close passes, may interfere 
with your itinerary.
RESERVATIONS
Morocco is a fashionable  
tourist destination, and the 
publicity campaigns that are 
mounted to advertise its 
town’s principal features of 
interest, and the addresses  
of hotels and restaurants.  
Official guides are also  
usually available. The  
Délégations Générales and 
Syndicats d’Initiative are  
open from 8:30am to noon 
and from 2:30pm to 6:30pm. 
During Ramadan and in  
summer, in the busiest towns 
and cities they are open  
continuously from 9am to 
5pm. Before leaving home, 
you may also wish to contact 
the Moroccan tourist office in 
your own country.
ENTRY CHARGES AND 
OPENING HOURS
An entry charge 
(usually about  
10 to 20 dirhams) 
is made for 
museums and 
historic sites  
and buildings. 
When entry  
is free, it is  
customary to give the care-
taker a tip equal to the  
average value of an  
entry ticket.
 Opening hours can be  
irregular. Tourist sites are  
generally open from 9am  
to noon and from 3 to 6pm. 
However, these times may 
change during Ramadan and 
at times of the year when  
the heat is very intense. The 
opening of smaller sites  
sometimes depends on the 
goodwill of the caretaker.
PASSPORTS AND VISAS
Citizens of the European 
Union, Swiss nationals and 
citizens of the United States, 
Canada, Australia and New 
attractions are effective in 
attracting large numbers of 
visitors. Some 3 million  
tourists visit Morocco  
each year.
 Most months 
are busy  
and hotel  
reservations  
have become 
essential. It is  
best to arrange 
your visit several 
months in 
advance, so as to be able to 
use the most direct flights  
and the most convenient 
schedules, and particularly  
if you want to reserve a  
room in smaller hotels and 
guesthouses, which have 
more character and which  
get booked up quickly.
TOURIST INFORMATION
All the major tourist centres  
in Morocco have a branch of 
the Office National Marocain 
du Tourisme (ONMT), which 
often goes under the name 
“Délégation Générale du  
Tourisme”. Smaller towns have 
a Syndicat d’Initiative (tourist 
bureau). These bureaux  
provide information on the

Zealand need a valid passport 
to visit Morocco. A passport, 
which should be valid for at 
least six months after the date 
of your arrival, allows you  
to stay in Morocco for three 
months. If this period is 
exceeded, the authorities 
react strictly and at the  
very least will escort you  
back to the frontier.
 If you intend to stay in 
Morocco for more than three 
months, you will need to 
obtain a visa. Information on 
entry formalities is available 
from the Moroccan Consulate 
in your home country.
 The border with Algeria  
is closed, but visas for  
Mauritania can be obtained 
quickly in Casablanca.
CUSTOMS
During your flight to  
Morocco, or when you  
arrive at the border, you will 
be handed a customs  
declaration form which  
you should fill in and hand 
over at passport control.  
You are legally entitled to 
bring into the country  
200 cigarettes, 75 cl of  
alcohol and small quantities 
of photographic material and 
video equipment.
 Drugs, firearms and porno-
graphic material are strictly 
prohibited. Permission must 
be obtained to bring in  
hunting weapons.
 Importing a vehicle for  
a limited period is possible 
but the formalities are very 
lengthy. The vehicle should 
be registered in your exact 
first name and surname.
LANGUAGE
The official language is  
Arabic, which is spoken  
by almost all Moroccans. 
French, a vestige of the  
Protectorate, is also very 
widely used, at least in large 
towns. It is less current in 
country areas, except among 
older people. In the South, 
Berber is widely spoken, 
especially in rural and  
mountainous areas.
 Because of the city’s  
proximity to Spain, Spanish  
is widely understood in  
Tangier, and is spoken in the 
Spanish enclaves. German is 
most often heard in Agadir, 
which attracts large numbers 
of Germans. English is  
spoken only by those  
closely involved in the  
tourist industry, such as 
guides and certain staff  
in the larger hotels.

Etiquette
Moroccans are very friendly people. You will have 
many opportunities to talk to them, and may even  
be invited into their homes. However, Morocco is  
a Muslim country, and certain conventions must be 
observed to avoid inadvertently causing offence.  
It is especially important to dress appropriately,  
not to take photographs of Moroccans without their 
permission, and to avoid certain sensitive subjects in 
conversation. If you are invited into the home of a 
Moroccan family, it is as well to be aware of certain 
points of etiquette. Respecting a few simple rules will 
be appreciated by your naturally hospitable hosts.
HOSPITALITY
Among Moroccans, hospitality 
is more than a tradition; it is 
an honour. After just a few 
minutes of conversation,  
traders in the souks and 
country people in the  
remotest regions of the Atlas 
may well invite you into their 
homes to drink a glass of tea 
or share a meal. It is difficult 
to decline these invitations, 
and a refusal may be  
interpreted as an offence.
 When you enter a house, 
take your shoes off if shoes 
have already been left near 
the door; this is a sign of 
respect towards your host.  
It is often the men who will 
invite you in, although you 
are sure to see the women  
of the house as well, in which 
case avoid being over-familiar. 
Accepting an invitation from a 
trader in a souk puts you 
under no obligation to buy 
anything from him. Finally, 
even if you are invited in by 
Moroccans of very modest 
means, never offer to pay for 
your meal. Offering a small 
gift is a far better and more 
acceptable way of thanking 
your hosts.
SHARING A MEAL
If you are invited to share  
a meal in the home of a 
Moroccan family, be prepared 
to be plied with copious  
helpings of food. As with 
other invitations, it is difficult 
to refuse first, let alone  
second, helpings of food.
 People usually eat with 
their fingers, with the  
additional aid of a piece of 
bread. If you cannot master 
the technique, you will be 
given eating implements. 
When eating, you should  
use your right hand since the 
left hand, used for personal 
hygiene, is traditionally  
considered to be impure.
 A Moroccan meal invariably 
ends with mint tea. It is not 
unusual to drink three or  
four glasses of this very  
sweet infusion. Again, the 
offer is very hard to refuse.
PHOTOGRAPHY
You can take photographs 
almost anywhere in  
Morocco. In some museums, 
a supplementary fee is 
charged if you want to take 
photographs, and in others 
photography is forbidden.
 Avoid taking pictures of 
military or official buildings 
since this may result in your 
film being confiscated and 
your being questioned at 
length about what you were 
trying to photograph.
 Before turning the lens  
on anyone, always ask the 
person’s permission, since 
Moroccans have an ingrained 
suspicion of any type of image. 
Bear in mind that anyone 
who agrees to your photo-
graphing them may ask you 
for a little money, especially 
in the major tourist spots.
MUSLIM CUSTOMS
Islam is a state religion, and 
the king of Morocco is the 
leader of the faithful. It is  
thus considered very bad 
form to criticize religion. It is 
also ill-mannered to disturb 
someone while they are at 
prayer, whether by speaking 
to them or by taking a  
photograph of them.
 It is above all during  
Ramadan that certain rules 
must be obeyed. The fast of 
Ramadan is strictly observed 
in Morocco. Although non-
Muslims may eat, drink and 
Mint tea served to guests, one aspect of Moroccan hospitality

smoke whenever they please, 
they should avoid doing so  
in public. Lastly, couples in 
the street must behave with 
decorum; they should not  
kiss in public, for example.
VISITING MOSQUES
All mosques, except the 
Grand Mosque in Casablanca 
and the old Tin Mal Mosque, 
are closed to non-Muslims. 
When visiting these mosques, 
remove your shoes and 
behave in a respectful  
manner, appropriate to the 
holy nature of the building.
 Never insist on being  
admitted to a mosque and  
do not try to see inside it by 
peeping through the door. 
Acting like this is likely to  
be considered sacrilegious.
DRESS
Attitudes towards 
dress have changed 
significantly in  
Morocco, so that,  
in large towns and  
cities, it is far from 
unusual to see  
Moroccan women  
in Western-style  
dress. Even so, scanty 
clothing should not 
be worn when 
exploring traditional 
quarters of towns or 
venturing into the 
country. Very short 
skirts, shorts and 
clothes that leave the 
shoulders or chest 
bare are likely to 
cause deep offence  
to Moroccans. For 
women, wearing a 
headscarf may help 
avoid unwanted attention. 
Women going topless, on the 
beach or in the swimming 
pool, is severely frowned on. 
Nudity is strictly forbidden in 
Morocco, and nudists run the 
risk of being arrested.
THE MONARCHY
Since the accession of 
Mohammed VI, attitudes 
towards the monarchy are 
now much more relaxed. You 
may even hear Moroccans 
openly criticizing the king. 
Even so, the subject of the 
monarchy is surrounded  
by a great deal of taboo in 
Morocco. As a general rule, 
do not express too trenchant 
an opinion on the subject and 
never show disrespect 
towards the king’s image, 
which can be seen hanging  
in all shops and public places. 
Lastly, be aware that the 
Moroccans are very patriotic 
and that any discussion of 
their country can quickly 
become heated.
BARGAINING
You may bitterly disappoint  
a trader if you do not show a 
willingness to indulge in the 
ritual of bargaining, another 
Moroccan custom.
 Bargaining revolves around 
the considerable difference 
between the price quoted by 
the buyer and that offered  
by the seller and the slow 
process by which both sides 
arrive at a mutually fair figure.
 When bargaining, you 
should keep smiling since  
the whole process is  
treated as a game.

SMOKING
Public places very rarely  
have no-smoking areas.  
However, smoking is now 
prohibited in most buses  
and modern cinemas.
 Except in large towns and 
cities, where attitudes have 
changed, it may still be con-
sidered shocking for women 
to smoke in public. Smoking 
kif (marijuana) is technically 
illegal, and it is best to avoid 
any contact with dealers.

hospital or clinic you wish  
to go, otherwise you will be 
taken automatically to the 
nearest public hospital. In 
remote regions, the only  
way of reaching a hospital  
is to hire a taxi.
PHARMACIES
All pharmacies in Morocco 
are denoted by a sign in the 
form of a crescent. Duty  
pharmacies are open on  
Sundays, and their address  
is posted in the window of 
pharmacies that are closed.  
In large towns and cities,  
duty pharmacies stay open 
round the clock.
 Pharmacies have helpful, 
knowledgeable staff who are 
able to give advice on minor 
health problems. Certain  
medicines that can only be 
obtained on prescription in 
Europe are available over the 
counter in Morocco.
FOOD AND WATER
Many visitors to Morocco  
suffer from stomach upsets, 
which are often caused by  
the change of diet. Avoid 
drinking tap water, especially 
in rural areas, and keep to 
bottled mineral water (see 
p327). Make sure that the 
bottle is opened in front of 
you. Do not add ice to 
any drink and avoid 
diluted fruit juices.
 On hikes and treks 
take water-purifying 
tablets to make spring 
water safe to drink. 
Alternatively, boil the 
water for 20 minutes.
 Be wary of salads and raw 
vegetables, and of unpeeled 
fruit and vegetables. They 
should be washed carefully. 
Food prepared at street stalls 
is another potential hazard. 
Although it is usually safe,  
Crime in Morocco is no worse than else-
where and most visitors will experience  
no serious problems. The fact that the  
police have a high-profile presence  
contributes to this degree of personal  
safety. As in any other country, a few basic 
precautions should be taken so as to avoid 
the attentions of pickpockets. Visitors  
should also be aware that drug-taking,  
especially in the north of the country, is  
one of the prime threats to personal safety. The best 
policy is to have nothing whatsoever to do with drugs, 
however mild. While the standard of Morocco’s  
public hospitals is uneven, private clinics are very 
expensive. It is advisable to take out health insurance 
in your own country before you leave.
Health and Security
VACCINATIONS AND 
MINOR HEALTH RISKS
No vaccinations are required 
for visitors entering Morocco, 
except for those coming from 
a country where yellow fever 
exists. However, vaccination 
against hepatitis A and B and 
typhoid is advised. Visiting 
certain regions of southern 
Morocco in summer carries  
a slight risk of exposure to 
malaria; anti-malaria pills  
are available locally.
 However long you plan to 
stay in Morocco, and where-
ver you intend to go, take a 
first-aid kit with you. It  
should include gauze,  
bandages, antiseptic and 
syringes, particularly if you 
intend to spend any time in 
sparsely inhabited rural areas.
 To prevent sunstroke, drink 
plenty of water, wear a hat 
and use a sunblock with a 
high UV-protection factor.
MEDICAL CARE
Although most public  
hospitals in Morocco have 
excellent specialist doctors, 
they are underfunded and 
lacking in equipment.  
Standards of hygiene are  
also unsatisfactory.
 If you have the option, 
choose a private clinic. 
Although these are 
expensive, standards  
of care are close to 
European ones. Your 
country’s embassy or 
consulate will provide  
a list of approved  
doctors and hospitals.
EMERGENCIES
In the case of accidents that 
occur in the home or on the 
public highway, the fire  
brigade is the first to attend 
the scene. Its ambulances are 
usually run by the Moroccan 
Red Crescent and they are 
marked “ambulance”.
 In the case of medical 
emergencies that  
occur in the street, 
SAMU ambulances 
will take you to 
the nearest  
hospital. Tell the 
ambulance or taxi 
driver to which (private)

as long as it is freshly cooked, 
people with delicate stomachs 
are advised to resist it.
 Fortunately, Moroccans  
like their meat well cooked. 
This destroys such parasites 
as tapeworms, which are  
rampant in Morocco.
INSECTS
There are no particularly 
harmful insects in Morocco, 
but scorpions, snakes,  
cockroaches and spiders are 
common in the countryside. 
Check your clothes and shoes 
before dressing, particularly 
when camping in rural areas.
 If you are bitten by a snake 
or spider or stung by a  
scorpion, apply a suction 
pump to the wound. These 
devices are sold in phar-
macies all over the country.
 Mosquitoes can be par-
ticularly bad in desert oases. 
An effective mosquito repel-
lent is es sen tial, especially  
in summer.
SERIOUS ILLNESS
Being careful about what  
you eat should stop you  
contracting cholera. In case  
of serious diarrhoea that  
persists after taking ordinary 
medication, consult a doctor 
without delay.
 Stray animals – especially 
dogs, which roam the streets 
of large towns during the 
night – may carry rabies. If 
you are bitten, it is essential 
to seek first aid immediately.
 Although the authorities 
deny it, sexually transmitted 
diseases such as AIDS are 
spreading in Morocco. The 
use of condoms (which are 
available in all pharmacies)  
is strongly advised.
PERSONAL SAFETY
Violence is rare throughout 
Morocco, and it is safe to go 
anywhere with no great risk 
to personal safety. Serious 
theft and burglary are not a 
widespread problem; this is 
because of the large number 
of caretakers who supplement 
the work of the police and act 
as an effective deterrent.
 However, pickpockets with 
finely honed techniques are 
likely to patrol the souks, and 
unwary tourists are the most 
likely targets. If you are the 
victim of theft, report it  
immediately at the nearest 
police station. If you intend  
to make an insurance claim, 
ask to be given a copy of the 
police record of the incident; 
this should be written in 
French rather than Arabic.
POLICE
Policemen are omnipresent 
both in towns and cities and 
on the roads in Morocco,  
and they have considerable 
powers. Uniformed police 
officers, traffic police on the 
roads and numerous plain-
clothes officers are present 
everywhere.
 The Moroccan police,  
who once had a reputation 
for corruption, have adopted 
a very courteous attitude in 
their dealings with tourists.
 In the case of more serious 
problems, you should contact 
your country’s consulate 
(see p361) as soon as 
possible. The consulate  
will give you advice and 
assistance in dealing with  
the finer details of the  
Moroccan legal system.

Banking and Currency
Moroccan currency cannot be  
obtained abroad. On your arrival  
in the country, you will find many 
exchange offices where you can easily 
obtain dirhams. With an international 
banker’s card you will also be able to 
draw money from automatic cash  
dispensers, as well as over the counter  
in banks that do not have ATMs. In 
country areas it can sometimes be difficult to change 
foreign currency, and shopkeepers and traders are  
seldom able to give change for high-denomination  
banknotes. It is also useful to keep a collection of  
coins for small purchases.
BANKS
Morocco’s main banks  
are Banque Marocaine du 
Commerce Extérieur (BMCE), 
Banque Marocaine du  
Commerce et de l’Industrie 
(BMCI), Attijariwafa Bank 
and Crédit du Maroc. Most 
of them either have  
agreements with certain  
large international banks, 
such as Citibank and the 
French bank Société 
Générale, or are their 
subsidiaries. There are 
branches throughout  
the country.  
Small towns  
usually have  
only one bank, and 
there are no banks at 
all in rural areas.
 Banks are open  
continuously from 
8am to about 4pm, 
Monday to Friday 
including Ramadan.
AUTOMATIC CASH 
DISPENSERS
In large towns, automatic 
cash dispensers (ATMs)  
are becoming increasingly 
easy to find. Most have 
instructions in several  
languages, and a notice  
or sticker lists those cards – 
Visa, Eurocard and  
MasterCard – that are 
accepted.
 Some dispensers give cash 
only against accounts that  
are held in Morocco and  
may swallow your inter-
national card if you insert it 
by mistake. Cash dispensers 
give out dirhams, and there 
is often an upper limit to  
individual withdrawals.  
The machines do not always 
work properly, and it is  
advisable to withdraw  
money during bank opening 
hours so that you can  
retrieve your card imme-
diately in the event of  
any problems arising.
 Banks in Morocco charge 
commission for foreign cash 
withdrawals, usually bet-
ween 4.50 and 7 dirhams, 
regardless of how much is 
withdrawn. Obtain informa-
tion on charges from your 
bank and avoid  
making  
frequent 
withdrawals  
of small amounts.
If the cash dispenser 
fails to work,  
most banks will  
issue cash over  
the counter to  
holders of a  
banker’s card.
BUREAUX DE CHANGE
Bureaux de change can be 
found in almost all banks,  
in hotels with a grading  
of three stars and upwards, 
and at airports. The  
exchange rate is uniform  
and variations in the  
commission charged are  
unusual. To avoid queueing, 
it is often best to change 
money at a hotel. While 
exchange offices in hotels 
and airports are open  
almost permanently, those 
attached to a bank have  
the same opening hours  
as the bank’s.
 When changing money,  
you will usually be asked  
to show your passport. All 
foreign currencies are  
accepted, but the euro and 
the dollar are the preferred 
currencies. Worn and torn 
banknotes are not accepted 
as a matter of policy. In the 
major tourist centres, money-
changers may offer you their

services in the street at a  
preferential rate, but it is  
best to decline the offer.
 You can change back  
any dirhams that you have 
over at the end of your  
stay, although the exchange 
rate will be poor and,  
unlike dollars and euros, 
pounds sterling are not 
always available.
CREDIT CARDS
Most reasonably comfortable 
hotels (usually those with  
a rating of three stars and 
above), as well as main-
stream restaurants in large  
towns, and certain stores 
(usually those in the most 
upmarket bracket) accept 
credit cards for payments.
TRAVELLER’S CHEQUES
The safest way of carrying 
money when travelling is  
still in the form of traveller’s 
cheques (in sterling, euros or 
dollars). Traveller’s cheques 
are accepted at almost all 
exchange offices and in  
most large hotels.
CURRENCY
The Moroccan unit of  
currency is the dirham (Dh  
in its abbreviated form), which 
is divided into 100 centimes. 
Banknotes are issued in the 
following denominations: 20, 
50, 100 and 200 dirhams. Coins 
are issued in denominations of 
5, 10, 20 and 50 centimes, and 
of 1, 2, 5 and 10 dirhams.
Coins
Coins come in denominatons of 
5, 10, 20 and 50 centimes and of 
1, 2, 5 and 10 dirhams. While 
centime coins are not widely used, 
1-dirham coins are handy, espec-
ially for paying someone to guard 
your car and for occasional tips.
Notes and coins are inscribed 
in French and Arabic. In rural 
areas and in souks it is very 
difficult to obtain change for 
large-denomination notes. 
Always carry small change to 
cover ordinary purchases.
 Both banknotes and coins 
bear the likeness of King 
Mohammed VI or of his father 
Hassan II. It is considered 
sacrilegious to tear or damage 
them. Any coin or banknote 
where the sovereign’s portrait 
is defaced in any way may 
even be refused.
 In some areas, especially  
in the countryside, prices are 
given in riales (or reales) 
instead of in centimes. One 
rial equals 5 centimes, but it 
is a purely conceptual unit:  
there are no rial coins.
Banknotes
Banknotes are issued in denominations 
of 20 dirhams, 50 dirhams, 100 dirhams 
and 200 dirhams.

Communications
Morocco’s telephone network is  
run by national operators Maroc  
Télécom, Meditel and Wana. The  
network has developed significantly 
and provides an efficient service, 
despite occasional problems. The  
use of mobile telephones is  
widespread. Postal services are generally  
reliable, although deliveries can be subject to  
long delays. Moroccan television is fighting a  
losing battle against satellite channels and foreign  
programmes. Newspapers, many of which are  
in French, cover current affairs both in Morocco  
and on the international stage.
PUBLIC TELEPHONES
Public phone boxes, which 
are relatively rare, are usually 
located outside post offices, 
markets and bus stations. 
Coin-operated telephones  
are still relative-
ly common, and 
they take coins 
up to a denomi-
nation of  
5 dirhams. 
Because of the 
number of coins 
needed, it is not 
practical to make 
international calls  
from a coin-operated  
telephone. Such calls are best 
made from a card-operated 
telephone. Phonecards are 
available at post offices and  
in tobacconists, which are  
indicated by a blue and  
white sign with three  
interlinked rings.
 With some telephones,  
an illegal card rental system 
applies. The cardholder 
inserts the phonecard for you, 
noting the number of existing 
units on the card. You make 
the call, and then pay the  
cost (based on the difference 
between the number of units 
on the card before and after 
your call). Calls made by this 
method are more expensive 
but obviate the need to buy  
a whole card.
PUBLIC TELEPHONE 
CENTRES
The number of small public 
telephone centres, known  
as téléboutiques, has mush-
roomed in Morocco. These 
centres are run either by  
private operators or by one of 
the three national operators. 
They house plastic phone 
boxes or kiosks (which are 
usually a sandy colour) with 
card-operated, coin-operated 
or metered  
telephones.  
The cards that 
are sold here 
often only work 
in telephones  
in the centre 
from which  
the card was 
bought or in  
telephones owned by the  
relevant operator. Faxes can 
also usually be sent and 
received in these public  
telephone centres.
MOBILE PHONES
Almost everyone, it seems, 
has a mobile phone in  
Morocco. The three  
competing network  
operators – Méditel, Maroc 
Télécom and Wana – are 
locked in a fierce price war. 
The network is excellent and 
mobile phones can be used in 
even the most remote regions 
of the country.
 Most European network 
operators have arrangements 
with one or other of the two 
Moroccan network operators, 
so that visitors can use their 
mobile phones in Morocco 
(but bear in mind that calls 
will be expensive).
 Mobile-phone users may 
also buy a prepaid SIM card 
from either of the Moroccan 
network operators. For a 
modest charge (no more  
than about 200 dirhams), you 
are provided with a Moroccan 
number through which 
national and international 
calls can be made at a more 
favourable rates.
USEFUL DIALLING 
CODES
• Telephone numbers 
consist of ten digits, and 
the country is  
divided into two zones 
(052 and 053). 
– Casablanca zone:  
0522 + 6 digits 
– Rabat zone:  
0537 + 6 digits 
– Marrakech zone:  
0524 + 6 digits 
– Fès zone:  
0535 + 6 digits.
• Always dial ten digits, 
whether calling from 
one zone to another or 
within a single zone.
• To call Morocco from 
abroad: dial 00 212  
+ nine digits (the ten-
digit number minus the 
initial 0).
• To dial internationally: 
dial 00 + country code + 
telephone number.

INTERNET CAFES
In large towns, it is  
increasingly common to find 
Internet cafés. Here, you can 
pick up and send e-mail and 
surf the Internet. Charges  
vary widely between different 
cybercafés, and are calculated 
according to the time spent 
on line.
POSTAL SERVICE
Morocco’s postal service has  
a reputation for being very 
slow. This is often borne out 
by reality, especially in the 
case of international mail.
 There are post offices in  
all sizeable towns. Here, you 
can buy stamps, send letters 
and parcels and cash, or send 
postal orders. Stamps are also 
However, if you  
have something 
urgent to send, it is 
better to use a private 
company such as  
DHL Worldwide 
Express or Globex 
(Federal Express). It 
is also best to post 
letters at a central 
post office rather  
than use one of the 
yellow street postboxes as 
collections can be unreliable.
POSTE RESTANTE
Most post offices provide  
a poste restante service, and 
this system works well in 
Morocco. Mail should bear 
the first name and surname  
of the recipient, as well as  
the name of the town. You 
will need some form of  
identification when collecting 
mail from a poste restante. 
The service is free of charge.
NEWSPAPERS
Morocco has many daily 
newspapers in Arabic and in 
French. The major leading 
newspapers in French are Le 
Matin du Sahara, L’Opinion, 
Libération and El-Bayane. 
Several weekly magazines, 
such as Le Journal, Tel Quel 
and Demain, or the quarterly 
publications such as Medina, 
Femmes du Maroc 
and Citadine were 
launched in recent 
years. They have 
given a new voice to 
the Moroccan press, 
which is usually 
quite conservative.
 French newspa-
pers like Le Monde 
and Le Figaro 
are printed in  
Casablanca at the 
same time as in 
France. English-language 
newspapers are available in 
Tangier, Agadir, Casablanca 
and Marrakech. Outside large 
towns you often find outdated 
daily newspapers on sale.
TELEVISION AND RADIO
Morocco has two television 
channels: Radio Télévision 
Marocaine (RTM), the public 
national channel that  
broadcasts in Arabic and in 
French, and 2M, a privately 
run channel that also  
broadcasts in both languages, 
although programmes in 
French predominate.
 Both the Moroccan televi-
sion channels are, however, 
severely rivalled by the spread 
of satellite dishes, which  
provide access to  
a huge number of 
international chan-
nels. Most  
households, as well 
as upmarket hotels, 
have satellite dishes.
 Broadcasts in  
English are obtain-
able only via  
satellite (mostly 
CNN and BBC). 
Around Tangier,  
it is also possible to tune in  
to broadcasts in English  
from Gibraltar.
 After many years of state 
monopoly (by RTM and Médi 
1), Moroccan radio has been 
liberalised and private stations 
such as Aswat and Radio 
Atlantic have been set up. It is 
also possible to tune into some 
European stations, including 
BBC World Service (on MHz 
15,070) and Voice of America.

he easiest way to reach 
Morocco is by air. The 
country is served by 
many regular flights from most 
major European cities and less 
frequent flights from North 
America. Internal flights link 
Morocco’s major cities. During the high 
tourist season, many charter flights  
are also available. Getting to Morocco 
by train or bus can be cheaper 
than travelling by air, but for 
most visitors the journey  
overland by these means is  
far too long to be practicable. 
It is also possible to reach 
Morocco by car and ship. 
Using your own car also saves the cost 
of hiring one on arrival in Morocco, 
which can be quite expensive.
ARRIVING BY AIR
Morocco has ten international 
airports. The busiest are those 
at Casablanca, Marrakech and 
Agadir. Royal Air Maroc (RAM), 
the national carrier, provides 
many links between Morocco 
and Europe, including  
departures from provincial  
cities, and a less frequent 
service between North  
America and Casablanca.
 RAM provides flights from 
London Heathrow to  
Casablanca, Marrakech,  
Ouarzazate and Agadir, and 
from London Stansted to  
Marrakech. EasyJet serves 
Tangier, Marrakech and  
Agadir from London Gatwick. 
Ryanair flies to Marrakech 
from London Luton and to  
Fès via Frankfurt. Air Arabia 
flies to Casablanca from  
London Stansted four times 
each week.  
 From North America, RAM 
flies three times a week from 
Montreal and New York JFK 
to Casablanca. From other 
North American cities, the best 
links are via London or Paris.
 There are no direct flights 
to Morocco from Australia or 
New Zealand. Connections 
can be made either via  
Singapore to Casablanca  
or via Dubai to Casablanca,  
or by flying to London.
 During the high tourist  
season, many charter flights 
supplement scheduled  
services. Most charter flights 
serve Marrakech, Agadir and 
Ouarzazate. As part of the 
“Open Sky„ agreement, low 
cost airlines can now fly to 
Marrakech. As well as Ryanair, 
these include EasyJet, Aigle 
Azur, Corsair and Jet4You.
 Many tour operators offer 
economical package deals 
including flights and accom-
modation in hotels, villas or 
resorts. The deals may also 
include guided tours, desert 
trips, activity and sporting 
holidays, and trekking.  
Specialist tour operators offer 
all this and can  
provide tailor-made 
arrangements.
CASABLANCA 
AIRPORT
Mohammed V Airport 
in Casablanca is 
Morocco’s main air-
port, both in terms of 
its size and of the 
volume of traffic that it  
handles. Most international 
flights arrive in and depart 
from Casablanca, and many 
flights serving other cities in 
Morocco touch down here. 
Internal flights to smaller  
airports – at Agadir, Marrakech, 
Ouarzazate, Fès, Oujda and 
Essaouira – also depart from 
Mohammed V Airport. The 
airport is located about 30 km 
(19 miles) south of the city 
centre, and is served by  
efficient bus and train services.
MARRAKECH AIRPORT
Rebuilt and considerably 
enlarged, Marrakech-Ménara 
Airport is now able to handle 
a large volume of flights and 
passengers. Located not  
more than a few kilometres 
southwest of the city centre,  
it is very easy to reach by bus 
or taxi. Charter flights make 
up most of its traffic, although 
it also handles many  
scheduled flights.
AIRPORT LINKS
Mohammed V Airport, outside 
Casablanca, is served by bus 
and train links (there is one 
train service every hour).  
By contrast, the only way  
of reaching certain other  
airports is by taxi from the 
town centre. Only the grands

taxis are 
permitted to wait 
for passengers at 
airports. The fact 
that they hold a 
monopoly allows them to 
charge relatively high fares, 
and they are unwilling to  
bargain. Airports are well  
provided with car-hire  
companies, and if you plan to 
travel around during your 
stay, hiring a car from the  
airport means, of course, that 
you will not need to use a taxi.
 To reach an airport from  
a city centre, you can hire a 
grand taxi.
ARRIVING BY CAR  
AND FERRY
Several ferry companies  
provide various sea links 
between Spain and Morocco, 
including the Spanish  
Transmediterrànea and the 
Moroccan Comarit. Their UK 
agent Southern Ferries has 
schedules and prices. The 
crossing from Algeciras, in 
Spain, to Tangier or Ceuta 
(the Spanish enclave in 
Morocco) takes about two 
hours but boarding can be 
very slow, especially in  
summer, when Moroccans 
working abroad return home.
 Ferry tickets can be  
purchased in advance or at 
the time of travel. In either 
case, the time spent queuing 
is the same. The adult fare is 
about 40 euros (£25). Taking 
a car across costs between 
about 90 and 180 euros (£56 
and £112), depending on its 
size. Most travellers take the 
ferry from Algeciras to  
Tangier, since 
services from 
here are more 
frequent, but 
there are also 
ferry links to Tangier and  
to Melilla from Málaga and 
Almerìa; to Ceuta from  
Málaga; and to Tangier  
from Gibraltar.
 In Spain, you need to collect 
an exit form before boarding. 
On leaving Morocco, you 
need to fill in an embarkation 
form and have this and your 
passport stamped before 
boarding the ferry.
ARRIVING BY TRAIN
Travelling by train means  
a long but scenic journey. 
From London, take the  
Eurostar to Paris, from where 
there is a daily TGV service to 
Algeciras, in Spain, changing 
at Irún, on the Spanish  
border. This is run by the 
French SNCF, but tickets 
(including Eurostar) can be 
bought at European Rail Ltd 
and Rail Europe. Holders of 
an InterRail card, which 
allows travel in 29 European 
countries (Spain, Portugal and 
Morocco are treated as a  
single zone), can break their 
journey anywhere they wish.
 The fare from Paris to  
Algeciras is about 155 euros 
(£97). Avoid train services  
that go via Barcelona, as  
links between Catalonia and 
Algeciras are poor. It is better 
to use a service that goes via 
Madrid. From Algeciras, there 
are ferry services to Tangier 
and to Ceuta (see Arriving by 
Car and Ferry, left).

ROAD SIGNS
The international system 
applies to road signs in 
Morocco, most of which have 
wording in Arabic and French. 
In large towns, direction signs 
are sparse, so that  
it is inadvisable to 
set out without a 
map or reliable 
instructions.
 Signage on  
motorways and 
major roads is  
usually good.  
Lighting,  
however, is normally 
non-existent, except  
on the approaches to 
large towns.
TRAFFIC HAZARDS
Negotiating local  
traffic is difficult  
mainly because of  
the great variety of 
vehicles that use the 
roads. As a general 
rule, avoid driving  
at night, when carts 
and bicycles with  
no lights are a real 
hazard. In towns, the rules of 
the road are not meticulously 
observed at night. Be  
particularly careful about 
pedestrians crossing roads 
and even motorways.
 Indicator lights are rarely 
used, and you will find that 
you must try to anticipate 
changes of direction of  
vehicles in your vicinity. 
Many major roads often have 
two carriageways, which can 
make overtaking hazardous. 
On mountain roads, taxis  
and buses are often driven 
somewhat dangerously. 
Sound your horn when  
driving into a blind bend.
ROADS AND TRACKS
Morocco’s relatively dense 
road network is undergoing 
constant improvements.  
So as to reap the benefit of 
the latest new streches of 
road, buy the most up-to- 
date road map.
 The well-developed  
road network in northern 
Morocco is gradually being 
supplemented by motorways, 
which are very pleasant to 
use as they do not carry 
many trucks. The road  
network in southern Morocco 
is less dense and the few 
minor roads in the region are 
often in a bad state of repair.
 In the South and in the 
Atlas mountains, metalled 
roads serve most places of 
interest to tourists, and they 
are complemented by a  
relatively good network of 
tracks. A four-wheel-drive 
vehicle is essential for  
journeys in these regions.
DRIVING IN TOWNS
The volume of traffic in 
large towns and cities  
can be considerable, 
and the increasing 
number of vehicles 
on the roads leads to 
multiple jams and 
bottlenecks, which 
are aggravated by  
the flotilla of bicycles 
and mopeds that also 
impede traffic flow.
 Although it is  
possible to drive into 
most medinas (the old 
areas of towns), their 
The best way of travelling around Morocco, 
and of exploring the country’s historic sites 
and natural environment in areas not 
served by local public transport, is by 
car. The imperfect road network is  
constantly being improved, and the 
number of metalled roads means  
that a four-wheel-drive vehicle is  
not essential, even in the South. A greater hazard is 
Moroccan driving standards, even though visitors will 
soon become used to them. There are a large number 
of car-hire companies in Morocco. Do not, however, 
assume that they all offer an identical service.
Travelling by Car in Morocco
RULES OF THE ROAD
The Moroccan highway  
code is based on that of 
France, so you must usually 
give way to the right. At 
roundabouts, you should give 
way to cars already 
on the roundabout.
 In general,  
Moroccan drivers 
obey traffic lights, 
perhaps because 
most junctions are 
patrolled by a  
gendarme or 
policeman.
 The speed limits are 40  
or 60 kmh (25 or 37 mph)  
in built-up areas, 100 kmh  
(60 mph) on the open road 
and 120 kmh (74 mph) on  
the motorway. In the 
approach to towns, drivers 
will sometimes see signs  
giving different speed limits; 
when in doubt, keep to  
40 kmh (25 mph), since 
speed traps are common  
on these stretches of road. 
Fines for speeding and other 
traffic offences were recently 
raised, and are now set at  
300 to 600 dirhams.

narrow streets and many  
dead ends can make  
circulation difficult. It is  
usually far more pleasurable 
to explore them on foot.
DRIVING IN  
THE COUNTRY
When driving on minor roads 
in rural areas, you should 
look out for animals, such as 
donkeys and flocks of sheep 
or goats. Wandering freely 
without human supervision, 
they may step into the road 
without warning.
 The many trucks and buses 
that use the roads may slow 
your progress considerably, 
and overtaking,  
particularly in the 
mountains, is  
difficult. Passing  
on narrow roads  
is often hazardous. 
Slow down and hug 
the hard shoulder so 
as to reduce the risk 
of collision.
FUEL
Service stations are found  
at fairly frequent intervals 
along roads in Morocco, even 
in the most remote areas. 
Although four-star petrol  
(gas) and diesel are widely 
available, unleaded petrol  
is rarely sold outside large 
towns. Irregular deliveries  
to service stations in rural 
areas may mean that they  
run out of fuel. Wherever  
you are, you should fill up 
before starting a long journey.
 Self-service is uncommon; 
you should wait for the atten-
dant to arrive and then pay 
him in cash, including a tip.
PARKING
In large towns and cities, an 
attendant wearing a small 
brass badge is assigned to 
every pavement. He will help 
you to park, will watch your 
car in your absence and will 
help you manoeuvre out of 
your parking place.
 Payment for this service  
varies according to how long 
the car is parked, and is at the 
driver’s discretion; allow 1 to 
2 dirhams for a short stay 
(even lasting no more than a 
few minutes) and 5 dirhams 
for several hours’ parking. If 
you want to park for a longer 
period (overnight, for exam-
ple), it is advisable to come to 
an agreement with the attend-
ant before leaving your vehicle. 
The advantage of this system 
is that car theft and break-ins 
are virtually non-existent. 
Parking meters are common 
in major cities.
CAR HIRE
Large towns and airports are 
well provided with car-hire 
companies, not all of which 
offer the same service. When 
hiring a car for an extended 
period, it is best to use 
an international  
car-hire company 
(such as Hertz, Avis 
or Europcar) or a 
Moroccan firm  
(such as Thrifty or 
First-Car) with an 
extensive network 
and reliable insur-
ance and breakdown 
assistance. On payment of a 
supplement, the hire vehicle 
may be dropped off at a dif-
ferent place from where it 
was picked up. Check the 
terms of the agreement, espe-
cially clauses relating to insur-
ance and cover in case of 
accident or theft. Also check 
the state of the vehicle and 
ask for any damage to be 
noted before you drive off.
 Car hire in Morocco is quite 
expensive. Charges (excluding 
collision damage waiver) are 
about 600 dirhams per day  
for a Class A car (such as a 
Renault Logan) and 1,900 
dirhams for a four-wheel- 
drive vehicle. There is usually 
a wide range of cars to 
choose from.
IN CASE OF ACCIDENT
If you are involved in a road 
accident, you should wait for 
the police to arrive. They will 
usually arrive quickly and  
will arbitrate in case of any 
disagreement. Official  
statement forms similar to 
those used in Europe are 
available at tobacconists.

The most important historic sites in 
Morocco’s towns and cities are often 
located in the medinas, where, in a 
maze of narrow streets and frequent 
dead-ends, the only practical way of 
getting around is on foot. But because 
many hotels are located in the modern 
quarters of towns, visitors will  
frequently need to takes buses or taxis. Although buses 
are an inexpensive means of getting around in a town, 
visitors may be baffled by the way that they work and 
the routes that they follow. Petits taxis offer a greater 
degree of flexibility at relatively little cost. In some towns 
the services of a guide are virtually indispensable to save 
spending too much time working out a route, but others 
are much more straightforward to navigate.
BY BUS
All large towns in Morocco 
are served by a wide network 
of bus lines linking their  
various districts. It can,  
however, be difficult to find 
the bus that you need since 
the destination is often given 
only in Arabic. For visitors, 
the most useful routes are 
those running between the 
new town (ville nouvelle) and 
the medina. Bus fares are 
cheap (3 to 4 dirhams) and 
tickets are purchased on 
board from the driver. Be sure 
to carry some small change.
BY GRAND TAXI
The most frequent journeys 
made by grands taxis, many 
of which are Mercedes and 
which seat up to six pas-
sengers, are those between 
towns and cities (see p377). 
They are also useful if you 
are a large party, are weighed 
down with luggage or want to 
explore the countryside be-
yond the town, although they 
won’t leave until they are full.
 Grands taxis are not fitted 
with meters, so the fare for 
your journey must be agreed 
according to mileage and the 
length of time that you hire  
it. The charge for hiring a 
grand taxi for a whole day 
will be about 500 dirhams.
 Grands taxis often wait  
outside large hotels, and  
they should not be mistaken 
for petits taxis, which are 
cheaper and which are  
used for shorter runs.
BY PETIT TAXI
These vehicles are identifiable 
by their colour, which is  
different in every town, and 
by the words “petit taxi” on 
the roof. They are prohibited 
by law from going beyond 
built-up areas and can only 
be hired for short trips.
 The use of meters is  
becoming more common. 
You should always ask for  
the meter to be switched on, 
and be prepared to round up 
the usually modest amount 
that is shown at the end of 
your journey. The usual fare 
for a short journey by petit 
taxi during the day is about 
10–20 dirhams. At night a  
50 per cent surcharge is added 
to the amount shown on the 
meter. Taxi fares are paid in 
cash, and it is important to 
have a good supply of small 
change as drivers are rarely 
able to give change for a  
100- or 200-dirham banknote.
 Petits taxis usually take up 
to three people (two in the 
back and one in front). They 
make frequent stops along 
the way to pick up other  
passengers going in the same 
direction. This should reduce 
the cost of the journey.
 It is better to ask to be 
taken to a specific restaurant, 
hotel or historic building, 
rather than name the relevant 
street. Although most drivers 
have a good knowledge of 
the town in which they work, 
they navigate by landmarks 
rather than street names.

towns, it is unusual to wait 
for very long. There are no 
radio taxi firms, but some 
drivers have mobile phones 
and will give you their card.
 If your journey entails  
driving along a track, the fare 
will automatically increase.  
In this case, the full amount 
should be agreed with the 
driver beforehand.
ON FOOT
Moroccan towns, and their 
medinas in particular, are  
typically very poorly sign-
posted for pedestrians. A  
street map is therefore useful. 
You can also ask your way,  
in return for a few words of 
thanks in French or, if the 
person takes you there, a few 
dirhams. Town centres are 
easy to explore on foot and 
best appreciated at a relaxed 
pace, especially if you have 
time to enjoy the maze of  
narrow streets. Cars, mopeds 
and bicycles take little heed 
of pedestrians, and you 
should take special care  
when crossing the street.
 Streets in towns throughout 
Morocco are very safe. There 
are, of course, insalubrious 
quarters, although these are 
rarely frequented by tourists. 
In tourist spots, an obvious 
police presence together 
with large numbers of 
people (both Moroccans 
and visitors) is the best 
guarantee of safety. In 
small crowded streets 
where pickpockets may 
operate, take special care 
of personal possessions.
BY BICYCLE  
OR MOPED
In the major tourist  
centres, particularly  
Marrakech and Agadir, 
bicycles and mopeds  
can be hired. The level 
terrain in these two cities 
makes cycling here quite 
easy. Mopeds and  
bicycles are an ideal 
means of getting around 
the old quarters, where the 
streets are narrow. However, 
a degree of  
caution is called 
for, since car 
drivers show  
little consider-
ation to other 
road-users.
 Bicycle attend-
ants, who can  
be found where 
there is a con-
centration of  
parked cycles  
and mopeds, are 
worth using. Charges range 
from 1 to 2 dirhams for a few 
hours to 10 dirhams for a 
night. Lock your bicycle or 
moped even if an attendant  
is guarding it.
BY CARRIAGE
Horse-drawn carriages are 
found mainly in Marrakech. 
Hiring one costs more than  
a petit taxi, but they can  
be a fun way of getting 
around towns. In Marrakech, 
the largest carriage “rank” is 
at the foot of the Koutoubia 
Mosque.
GUIDES
The bogus guides who were 
once so ubiquitous in tourist 
spots have become more  
discreet since measures were 
taken to clamp down on  
anyone without an official 
card acting as a guide.
 Even if you have a street 
map, you will find some towns 
very confusing to explore. 
The services of a guide may 
be necessary on your first  
day in a certain town or city, 
particularly in the largest 
medinas, like that of Fès.
 
Official guides are identi-
fiable by the cards 
that they carry, 
almost always 
pinned to their 
clothing. These 
cards are issued  
by the Ministry of 
Tourism and bear  
an identity photo-
graph of the holder.
Official guides can 
be requested at 
tourist information 
offices, and also by 
hotels (in which case make 
sure they carry the card). 
They also often wait near 
hotels and major historic 
buildings. Specify which 
buildings and other features 
you wish to see, and whether 
or not you wish to be taken 
into shops. The fees are fixed 
by the government, but 
always agree the fee with  
the guide beforehand.

The Moroccan rail network 
(ONCF) links the towns and  
cities of northern Morocco, the 
southernmost town with a rail 
link being Marrakech. Trains are 
clean and reliable, and journey 
times depend on the number of stops along the route. 
The rail network is complemented by long-distance bus 
services, which are run either by public or by private 
companies, and which are cheaper than the train. 
Whatever your chosen means of transport, you should 
check beforehand the various timetables and any stops 
that may seriously lengthen your journey. Grands taxis 
(see p374) are a swift means of travelling from one 
town to another, but their fares are not fixed and  
bargaining is a matter of course. The best way to travel 
between principal cities is often on a domestic flight.
THE RAIL NETWORK
Run by the Office National 
des Chemins de Fer (ONCF), 
the Moroccan rail network, 
while very good, is not  
very extensive. It covers just 
1,700 km (1,056 miles) and 
serves mainly the northern 
part of the country, linking 
Tangier, Oujda, Rabat, Casa-
blanca, Fès, Marrakech and 
El-Jadida. Plans to extend  
the railways southwards,  
particularly to Agadir, are 
under way. The Atlas, how-
ever, is an insuperable barrier.
 Services are frequent, since 
trains are the preferred means 
of transport for ordinary  
people. A separate rail network 
is used for transporting phos-
phates, of which Morocco is 
the world’s largest producer.
 Casablanca and Rabat have 
several railway stations,  
located in different districts 
but served by the same line.
TRAINS
With a few exceptions, 
Moroccan trains are  
relatively modern. Those 
known as Trains Navettes 
Rapides, or TNR (express 
shuttles), and referred to  
as “Aouita” after a famous 
Moroccan Olympic runner, 
link Casablanca and Rabat  
in 50 minutes, Mohammed V 
Airport and Casablanca in  
40 minutes, and Rabat and 
Kenitra in 30 minutes.  
The service is  
frequent at 
peak times.
Trains 
known  
as Trains  
Rapides  
Climatisés (air-conditioned 
express trains) cover the 
longer distances between 
Casablanca, Fès, Oujda,  
Tangier and Marrakech, and 
are identified by names such 
as Koutoubia and Hassan. 
They are air-conditioned  
and soundproofed and have 
proper toilets. On the most 
heavily used route (from 
Casablanca to Marrakech,  
Fès and Tangier), there is  
a service at least every two 
hours, and it is possible to 
make the round trip from 
Casablanca to Tangier and 
back again in a single day.
 For long journeys, the  
compartments on night  
trains can be converted into 
couchettes. Second class, 
which is air-conditioned, is 
very comfortable. The toilets 
are located at the end of the 
coach and are reasonably 
clean. On-board catering 
services are rather basic.  
Vendors walk up and down 
the coaches offering cakes, 
confectionery, drinks and 
sometimes sandwiches.
TRAIN TICKETS  
AND FARES
The cheapest way to buy  
a train ticket is at a railway 
station. Passengers must have 
a ticket valid for the relevant 
class of seat and type of train. 
If you reserve a couchette or 
a bed in a sleeper, you must 
be able to show the ticket for 
the relevant supplement.
You can purchase a ticket 
without booking a seat six 
days in advance, a combined 
train and bus ticket one 
month in advance, and

T R A V E L  I N F O R M A T I O N

a ticket with a bed booked  
on a sleeper two months in 
advance. You can break your 
journey so long as you collect 
a form (bulletin d’arrêt) at the 
station where you alighted. 
This form makes your ticket 
valid for an extra five days.
 If you have to board a train 
without having bought a ticket 
at the station ticket office, ask 
for a boarding ticket (ticket 
d’accès), which is issued free 
of charge at the entrance to the 
platform, or tell the inspector 
before you board the train. A 
ticket bought on the train is 
always more expensive than 
one bought from a station 
ticket office before boarding.
 The train is a relatively 
inexpensive means of getting 
around. A second-class ticket 
on an express train from 
Casablanca to Marrakech or 
Fès costs about 125 dirhams, 
and from Marrakech to  
Tangier about 250 dirhams. 
There are various concessions 
for families, young people 
and groups, and season  
tickets are also available, 
although these are  
economical only for regular 
travel on a particular route.
COACHES
Many coach (bus) companies 
operate in Morocco. The best 
known is CTM, the national 
company that runs services 
between towns in Morocco 
and also abroad. Two private 
companies, SATCOMA SATAS 
and Supratours, also cover 
long-distance routes. Coaches  
are comfortable and air- 
conditioned, and are very 
convenient, especially in the 
South. They depart from bus 
stations, which are usually 
well signposted. A combined 
train and Supratours coach 
will take you from Casablanca 
to Dakhla in the far south.
 It is advisable to buy your 
ticket, and thus reserve a seat, 
at least 24 hours in advance 
since coaches are often fully 
booked at time of departure. 
Luggage is checked in ahead 
of departure and is carried  
in the hold. Make sure that 
yours has been loaded.
 Many small local coach 
companies also operate in 
Morocco, although the  
comfort of their buses is  
often minimal and journey 
times painfully long.
GRANDS TAXIS
This is the most flexible way 
of travelling from one town 
to another. Grands taxis are 
mostly found at bus stations, 
parked according to their 
destination.
 Grands taxis are not fitted 
with meters, and fares must 
be agreed by bargaining. The 
main factors involved are the 
length of the journey and 
how many people are to be 
carried. If the taxi is full  
(with seven or perhaps eight 
people), each person’s fare 
will be only slightly higher 
than for the same journey 
made by bus.
 If you do not wish to share 
the taxi, expect to pay the 
equivalent that the driver 
would receive for a fully 
loaded car. This allows you 
the option of a tailor-made 
route. Any stops along the 
way, to visit places of  
interest, should be agreed 
beforehand, since they will 
lengthen the journey time 
and add to the fare.
DOMESTIC FLIGHTS
The most economical way  
of making longer journeys 
between Morocco’s largest 
cities is often on one of the 
internal flights provided by 
Royal Air Maroc, especially 
to Agadir or Ouarzazate,  
neither of which has a rail 
link. The one-way fare  
to either place is about  
700 dirhams, although prices 
may vary according to the 
time of year. Regional 
Airlines also operates 
internal flights.
