“Products today aren’t designed like they were even just a few years 
ago. This breezy, easy-to-read guide walks you through modern 
product design as it’s practiced in the field by some of today’s best 
designers. Both an overview of the field and a handy how-to guide, 
this book has something for everyone working to make products 
people love.”
DAN SAFFER, AUTHOR OF MICROINTERACTIONS
“In a quickly changing space, Scott Hurff shares an informed, 
actionable perspective.”
RANDY J. HUNT, VP DESIGN, ETSY
“Scott’s new book connects the world of fast, startup-driven, 
design-for-mobile thinking with the traditional world of comparatively 
slower, “do-it-the-right-way” design and brand thinking. The new 
world of digital product design is interminably evolving, so this book 
is a great 2015 snapshot of the way modern digital designers needs 
to act and behave as more like explorers rather than conservators. 
Keep in mind that in 2016, 2017, and beyond, however, we should 
expect even more change to the field of digital product design—so 
I look forward to the future editions of Scott’s work as a historian 
of sorts in a rapidly evolving present-tense that gets old the very 
moment it ships.”

Acknowledgments
This book is almost two years in the making and was made possible by 
a countless number of people. 
My heartfelt gratitude to Mary and Angela for introducing me into 
the O’Reilly family and for keeping me on deadline. Instrumental in 
both the early days and the daily grind of writing was Cynthia. Many 
thanks to Jeff, Mike (x2), Chris, Dan G., Brian, Jason C., Noah, Anton, 
Amy, Alex, Andrew, Dan S., John, Hannah, and Jason, who read early 
drafts. You each got me into the mindset and across the finish line. 
I’m also grateful for every person who agreed to be interviewed for the 
book—your knowledge will echo for a long while. And, finally, a huge 
thanks to Mom and Dad for hammering home the importance of writ­
ing from my youngest days.

Products Are for Customers
Product design is not just about shipping.
It’s not just about being original.
It’s not just about making things beautiful or stylish.
And it’s not just about making something easy to use.
Product design is about creating something that’s right for your cus­
tomer by completely understanding what they feel, what they think, 
and what they want.
But, ultimately, designing a product means designing something that 
sells. 
Because that’s why a product exists in the first place.
This isn’t a new notion. “The purpose of the enterprise is to create 
a customer,” wrote legendary organizational expert Peter Drucker in 
The Practice of Management.* And he wrote that almost 50 years ago.
Maybe you’re reading this book because you or your team have been 
stuck in the ship-pivot-ship loop of death, and can’t figure out how to 
get out of it.
Perhaps you’re reading this book because your team wants more 
“design-minded solutions,” and you’re in an ancillary design role.
Or you might’ve been intrigued by the money. It’s hard not to be. The 
number of designer-led companies that have raised money or have 
been acquired in the past few years is only rising.†

xii  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Whether it’s for survival, adaptation, or vanity—or none of the above—
I’m glad you’re here. 
You’re going to learn how to ignore all of the noise. 
You’re going to learn how to create products that sell. 
Creating a successful digital product is the ultimate realization of cre­
ativity, hard work, and leadership. We too easily forget that products 
are made by people, for people. 
The result is that the how of building a product has become mystified, 
detached from the what of a product. 
That’s because the way that successful products are built is a competi­
tive advantage for all companies, from the largest—like Facebook and 
LinkedIn—to the smallest up-and-coming startups you haven’t even 
heard of yet. 
Overnight successes are rare. Successful products aren’t happy acci­
dents, as we’re led to believe. And most of them are too often made 
sloppily and without good practices. 
So how do you create a product that sells? 
I’ll promise you that it doesn’t begin with devouring biographies of 
mythologized figures, repeating the phrase “if you build it, they will 
come,” or thinking that if we just get it out there, we’ll know what to build 
next. 
Let’s talk about why this is the book for you.
Why This Book Is for You
The dopamine rush is as clear as yesterday. 
I was a founding team member of a Kleiner Perkins–backed online 
video startup, leading product. 
And we were adding one million users a day. 
These stats seemed to validate that people loved the product I helped 
to create. 
But the party didn’t last. We rode a wave of hope to over 20 million reg­
istrations until traffic died, interest waned, and the product was shut 
down in November 2013.

vinced to sign up for something they didn’t want. And what led us to 
believe that this was real success. 
The experience left me hungry to know how the best products are 
made. It led me to examine how product designers work, how they cre­
ate products people want, crave, can’t live without—and how they do it 
over and over again.
One might chalk up this anecdote to not achieving the exalted “product/
market fit,” after which one might encourage me to “fail faster” by 
“pivoting” into a new idea. After that, we’d then turn around and “val­
idate” the idea and tweak accordingly.
But this process also led me to wonder—what if this framework was 
flawed? What if we didn’t have to launch products with prayer and 
carefully planned viral loops, only to keep praying as we dove into the 
next pivot? 
This Book Is For You
This book is written for anyone who wants to be better at creating 
digital products. Because when we learn to improve the how of doing 
things, everybody benefits when we put it into practice. 
My goal is to show you how to create successful digital products, 
regardless of the industry in which you operate. I’ve interviewed more 
than 30 product leaders, studied the history of how products came to 
be made, and pulled out the repeatable processes and strategies they 
used to win.
You’ll find my interviews with these experienced product designers at 
the end of each chapter. All, however, have been truncated for brevity. 
You’ll be able to read all interviews in their entirety at http://scotthurff.
com/dppl/interviews.
In these Q&A sessions, you’ll learn about how these accomplished 
product designers work. How they grind through creative dry spells. 
Where they seek inspiration, and how they work through product chal­
lenges with their teams. And better yet, you’ll learn the repeatable pro­
cesses they use to churn out products that people use again and again.

At the end, you’ll see how products like Medium, Twitter, and 
Squarespace—along with many others—are created and improved. 
Their workflows and processes are here for you to dissect, and to apply 
immediately.
We’ll see how they come up with early gems of product ideas, the meth­
ods they use to gut-check those gems, and how this research affects 
the actual product design. 
Then, we’ll step into their heads as they design, prototype, iterate, and 
test the actual product. We’ll hear about how they gather customer 
feedback and use it to stack the odds in their favor when they finally 
launch.
That being said, the techniques in this book are useful for anyone, 
whether you’re a solo entrepreneur, startup worker, or a member of a 
larger organization experiencing any of the following challenges: 
•	 Products built with a head-in-the-clouds mentality that results in 
a launch that finds no customers. 
•	 Projects that are plagued by last-minute changes, not-fully-considered 
flows, or technology that can’t deliver on the product’s promise. 
•	 Customers who are confused about how to use a product that was 
just launched, despite it seeming “obvious” to the team. 
•	 Fear that you’re falling behind, not learning fast enough, and not 
offering enough creative ideas. 
•	 An ability to recognize “good design,” but a tendency to get caught 
up in the details, second-guessing design decisions and forgetting 
the entire purpose of the product: putting the customer first, not 
second to the user interface convention of the moment. 
When you’re finished with this book, my goal is for you to take away 
the following:
•	 Understand how the products you use on a daily basis came to life. 
Jump inside the minds of highly effective product designers in 
top companies to learn how great products get made. Apply these 
workflows immediately to your own. 
•	 Learn simpler ways of discovering and interpreting customer pain 
or joy, and how you can use this as a vision to guide your team 
through the messy product creation process.

 PREFACE   |  xv
•	 Take away the pain of designing interfaces across different form 
factors—mobile, desktop, tablet, web, TV, cars—by learning about 
user flow, epicenter design, state awareness, and primary actions. 
•	 Discover the latest psychological research being used by prod­
uct designers to create habit-forming and emotionally engaging 
experiences. 
I’m not going to pretend that everything in this book is novel, original, 
or has never been done before. That’s, in fact, the point. The reason 
this book exists is because I wanted to find product designers actually 
doing the work. They’re the ones who’ve taken the various popular 
models and methods and actually turned them into something real. 
Here, you’ll read about how the real work is done.
What’s in the Book
Creating a new product is like taking a photo.
The picture you want to capture is right in front of you, but you’re not 
sure which zoom setting will bring your subject’s crisp lines, sharp 
angles, and stark detail into the frame. So you turn the lens back and 
forth, gradually settling on the zoom that’s right for the lens and for 
the photo. 
Of course, the subject in front of you could be moving—smiles and 
facial expressions, leaves blowing in the wind, wildlife running out 
of frame. So you do your best to capture the best possible story in one 
frame, adapting to the realities on the ground.
Building a product has similar challenges. This is a process that starts 
out with a clear goal and stated target, but will probably be forced to 
adapt its angle and scope along the way. Even so, you try to find the 
best possible solution to meet your goals and satisfy a customer. 
But we’re not the first ones to face the challenges of creating products 
for other human beings. That’s why we’re going to examine the past 
so we can design the future.

THE PRODUCT CREATION MODEL
The process of creating a product is messy. But I’ve tried to break this 
complex creation process down into four basic steps. These steps pro­
vide the framework for the chapters in this book (Figure P-1):
1.	
Hunt and synthesize
2.	
Build
3.	
Test and level up
4.	
Launch, monitor, and start over
You’ll be seeing this a lot throughout the book, so let’s explore what it 
means for a second.
Hunt and synthesize 
Products begin and end with the pain and joy of your customers. 
Coming up with product ideas that’ll work is really the search for these 
two traits in your target audience. Doing the hard, laborious, unfor­
giving work of searching for pain and joy among your target audience 
guarantees you’ll discover a need that is being underfulfilled or over­
looked by your competitors. 
In Chapter 1, you’ll trace the origins of modern digital product design 
to the 20th century’s earliest pioneers of product creation: Lillian 
Gilbreth, Henry Dreyfuss, and Neil McElroy. Each conducted pains­
taking, extensive customer research in the field and used it to shape 
the products they made.
In Chapter 2, you’ll learn why the act of uncovering people’s pain is at 
the source of product success. You’ll discover how to analyze custom­
ers in their natural habitats, and learn about the Pain Matrix, which 
helps you understand how different types of products create a variety 
of emotional responses in their customers. 
FIGURE P-1

model captures the 
four basic steps of 
creating a product, 
despite it being a

 PREFACE   |  xvii
The next step is to take this research and to make it consumable by your 
team. You’ll need to convince them of the right path, so in Chapter 3, 
you’ll discover how to rally people around your cause while deciding 
what product to build. Who’s in the room together? How much do they 
know about the pains you’ve found? What evidence should you bring 
to the table? And how do you frame the discussion? Here, you’ll learn 
how to home in on the customer’s need as a foundation, and guide the 
process by which a product is built upon this foundation. You’ll see 
how the findings of your customer research should be vetted with your 
team, learn meeting techniques that get results, and discover how to 
keep people on task and engaged after the first meeting is over. 
Build
Don’t design the logo first. Don’t design the marketing site first. 
Design the product’s interface first. 
Designing the product’s interface starts with actually writing the 
interface, creating and analyzing user flows, building prototypes to 
externalize your ideas, and evolving the interface on top of the proto­
type. As you approach product launch, this phase will bring your prod­
uct more into focus as fidelity increases from testing feedback. 
Mapping out every screen with the prewritten copy helps identify the 
major problems of user flows early on. It also requires you to think 
ahead about what types of data are required and when, forcing you to 
build data collection steps into these flows. This is what we’ll examine 
in Chapter 4, where we’ll also explore the various techniques product 
designers use for creating user flows. Sketching? Wireframing? How 
do you express each possible state? The takeaway is that there’s no one 
perfect way to do this. The goal is, as a famous stormtrooper once said, 
to “move along now,” and get something working as quickly as possi­
ble without having to juggle all of the product’s variables in your head. 
Clarity and communication are paramount. 
Product design thrives on the power of prototyping and externalizing 
the ideas in your head to visuals for your team, clients, and potential 
customers. You’ll learn about this in Chapter 5. The importance of this 
early lower-fidelity work increases as we enter this next phase of the 
design process. Your earlier investment in this foundation serves as 
a guide for what you’ll be doing next. Once the copywriting has been 
www.it-ebooks.info

xviii  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
roughed out and the user flows mapped, the goal in this phase should 
be to get something working as quickly as possible—working being the 
operative word. 
Chapter 6 examines the mechanics of interface design. You’ll learn 
about the five base states of every product’s screen and how to design 
for them, while incorporating essential user interface principles. Here, 
you’ll also come to understand the delicate transition that occurs when 
moving from a rough prototype and into more high-fidelity screens. 
Next, you’ll see what it takes to design across different form factors—
mobile, web, desktop, TV, watch—and how to optimize for human 
hands. 
But simulated prototypes and static mock-ups aren’t the only things 
that make up a user interface and create memorable product experi­
ences. Chapter 7 will help you tap into the psychology of the experi­
ence. We’re all human and we’re not immune to emotion. How can 
products tap into that emotion? How can emotion be used to create 
powerful feedback loops that draw your customers into the experi­
ence, and keep them coming back for more? 
You’ll also learn why transitions, animations, personality, and positive 
reinforcement are essential to the psychological impact of your prod­
uct. And you’ll see the power of infusing your product with personal­
ity and the various ways that this personality can shine through (copy­
writing, characters, art, inside jokes). You’ll also learn how to design 
transitions and animations that match the personality of your product. 
Finally, you’ll see why it’s essential to examine your product’s flows to 
create powerful feedback and engagement loops. Beyond alleviating 
your customer’s pain, how do you make people want to use your prod­
uct? What psychological underpinnings should you keep in mind? 
Test and level up
Creating a product is a long road of refinement before each release. 
And refinement comes from real feedback and critiques of prototypes 
of various levels of fidelity—from your team, friends, family, outside 
beta testers, or even customers. You’ll learn in Chapter 8 how to take 
this feedback—good and bad—in the gut and soldier on. This is where 
we examine the practical aspects of gathering this feedback and how 
www.it-ebooks.info

 PREFACE   |  xix
to interpret it. You’ll also learn the early warning signs that you’re 
building the wrong product, and understand the role of feedback in 
“leveling up” your product. 
Launch, monitor, and start over
How do you know when to ship? How do you prepare for launch? 
Chapter 9 shows you why it’s essential now that you take special care 
of every aspect of your product at this stage. You’re the “COE” (chief 
of everything) of your product. You need to know how it works, what 
stage it’s in, what issues are open, and what’s next at all times. And 
your responsibility doesn’t end once the product has shipped. 
Here you’ll see how to combat the cult of “minimum viable product” 
and how quickly you’ve built something versus the quality and effi­
ciency of the product. We’ll contrast this with the notion of “mini­
mum lovable products”—the point where a product is capable of being 
accepted by your customers either as a problem solver or bringer of 
joy—but with the understanding that it’s not without flaws. 
Finally, you’ll learn what things to monitor after launch, and how to 
stay both sane and creative in the trough of despair. 
I can’t give you a recipe for how to make a successful product or satisfy 
a customer, because building a product depends on a multitude of fac­
tors—the market you’re in, the people with whom you work, and the 
inherent biases you or your team might have. 
What we can do together, though, is explore examples of successful 
work being done, while providing both frameworks and principles you 
can bring into your own work life. 
Rather than be a simple series of do’s and don’ts, I want to take you on 
a journey through the creation of a product through the eyes of expe­
rienced product designers.
How to Use This Book
A short note before we begin: at the end of each chapter, you’ll find 
three items.

xx  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
First, I’ll recap what you just read in bite-sized bits. Copying and past­
ing these into a document, writing them down in a Moleskine, or post­
ing them on your social network of choice will help you to remember 
what you just read and help you return to your favorite passages at a 
future date. 
Second, the “Do This Now” sections will help you to implement what 
you read into your own process. 
Third, each chapter concludes with a transcript of interviews I con­
ducted with experienced product designers (you’re reading a preface, 
so they’ll start with the next chapter). Each interview fits within the 
theme of the chapter. My hope is that you’ll be able to understand the 
background, motivations, and techniques of the individual product 
designers who’ve helped form the thinking behind this book.
So, what’s next? 
We’ll examine why successful products start with observing what real 
people do—not what you think they do. We’ll then explore time-tested 
techniques for figuring out what your potential customers really want. 
Let’s begin. 
Shareable Notes
•	 How products get made is a competitive advantage for all 
companies. 
•	 Most products, both successful and unsuccessful, are too often 
made sloppily and without good practices. The biggest offender? 
Believing that technology is special, and that we can ignore time-
tested product-building practices simply because distribution and 
creation are cheaper. 
•	 The proliferation of connectivity, mobile devices, and cheap tech­
nology is making design more valuable than ever.
•	 The product creation process has four phases: hunt and synthe­
size; build; test and level up; launch, monitor, and start over.

Why Products Exist
What’s Product Design?
“What is product design?” 
“What does a product designer do?” 
“What’s the difference between a product designer and a product 
manager?”
The interest in what product design is and what it does has surged in 
recent years. Now, more than ever, those of us working in—or wanting 
to work in—technology have become more curious about what prod­
uct design is capable of and what it even is. 
That’s because we need something bigger to describe the responsibili­
ties placed on product teams. As technology continues to force its way 
into the lives of the global population, the implications of how a prod­
uct is designed can put not only entire businesses at stake, but the lives 
of our customers as well.
But product design remains a difficult concept to grasp, even by people 
who are actually doing the work. 
It’s fascinating to see the wide range of responses among the product 
designers I interviewed. Here’s how they describe what they do.
[ 1 ]
www.it-ebooks.info

2  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Josh Brewer, former principal designer at Twitter:
Product designers are people who have a set of knowledge that’s 
broader. They may be very deep in one or two areas, but they have 
an understanding of the entire process of bringing a product to life. 
You have to have a pretty decent domain expertise across things.
Nathan Kontny, CEO of Highrise:
I think product design is becoming more and more this search for 
friction people have getting [a] task done. As a product designer, 
I’m trying to really understand a task people have and look at the 
steps people have doing that task. Then, trying to figure out where 
I can start removing some of those steps. Is it combining some of 
those steps? Is it removing some of the steps? Often, I’m finding 
just removing one step can make a big difference in making a 
product save people time.
Ryan Hoover, founder of Product Hunt:
[Product design] is a more comprehensive view of what the prod­
uct is that you’re trying to achieve or solve, and how do we solve 
that as efficiently and easily as possible for the user. It’s more of a 
comprehensive view of “how do we craft an experience and solu­
tion to meet that particular need?” It involves, I believe, more user 
psychology and understanding of how to build an interface that’s 
useful. And how you communicate from a marketing perspective 
what that value proposition is.
 Keenan Cummings, product designer at Airbnb, Yahoo!, and Days:
Product design is about understanding people. We have to get out­
side our own heads and that means tearing down a fortress of 
assumptions that keep us feeling comfortable in the world. You 
have to constantly challenge how the world looks from your cozy 
spot in it. People will always surprise you. The only assumption 
I allow myself to entertain freely was something I read in The 
Internet and Everyone by John Chris Jones: “Design everything 
on the assumption that people are not heartless or stupid but mar­
velously capable, given the chance.”
But that is merely the observation part. Discovering and under­
standing motivations is a process of empathy. This is what I was 
referring to when I said designers have a leg up in learning prod­
uct design. Design really is just a practice of empathy. It is about 
www.it-ebooks.info

 Why Products Exist   |  3
synthesizing culture and movements of ideas and distilling that 
into something interesting. Designers do this without thinking. 
They work with the intent to spread ideas. And they are good at 
making things that are spreadable. That comes from empathy. 
They get outside their own frame of reference so they can make 
something that touches the masses.
And “taste” kills empathy. Taste is when you’ve amassed enough of 
those cultural influences that you start to believe the ideas and the 
cultural synthesis come from within. The moment that happens 
you stop observing. You stop absorbing the influences because you 
see yourself as the source. It’s subtle, easy to miss. But slowly your 
source material narrows, your resources diminish, and you are left 
to repeat yourself. Culture goes on, dynamic and ever changing, 
and you are left with the same material to chew on. This is where 
“taste” leads you.
Ryan Scherf, product designer at Quirky:
It’s creating something that people want to use. As product design­
ers, part of our job is to create something that’s simple, something 
that can be motivational at times. Something that’s emotional. 
It evokes emotion for us. And, ultimately, it has to meet expecta­
tions. [Without this], you’re not going to make it.
Sahil Lavingia, founder and CEO of Gumroad, former product designer 
at Pinterest:
Product design is less about building a company, or raising money, 
or revenue or profit. It’s really just about identifying the problem 
and how to solve it. If these are the thirty things we could do that 
could solve this problem, which one solves it the best way?
I like the phrase “product design” because it’s very physical. I 
always use the example of a cup. A well-designed cup is not a cup 
that you look at and say, “wow, that’s a sexy cup.” A good cup is 
something that does its job. It holds coffee well or whatever. That 
means maybe the material it’s using prevents the cup from trans­
ferring heat to burn your hand, or there’s no hole in the bottom so 
the coffee doesn’t fall out. Typically, those are the attributes of a 
well-designed product, or a well-designed cup.
www.it-ebooks.info

4  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Applying that to software means, “what is this thing trying to do?” 
What is its equivalent of holding liquid, and how do we design 
it? How do we choose the proper attributes of this product to do 
that, within whatever constraints we have? The best coffee cup 
might cost $8,000 to make because it’s made of this crazy mate­
rial that’s only mined on the moon, [but that’s not feasible]. That’s 
what I think product design is.
It’s clear that the definition of product design shifts slightly with every 
new company and challenge. In some places, product designers might 
need to learn to write code to bring a product to life. In others, a deep 
understanding of a customer’s psychology is a critical ingredient.
This just shows that product design is the synthesis of different meth­
odologies being pulled together, piece by piece. There’s not just one 
job involved. And the demand for this type of person is only getting 
stronger. 
But this isn’t the first time that such demands have been placed on 
those designing products. Digital products aren’t special, and they 
don’t have any special properties that imply designers can break the 
basic rules of designing for humans. 
We learn not only from new experiences, but by studying the past. 
Let’s learn more about product design by understanding the work of 
those who came before us.
Product Design’s Heritage
Five years. Three products. $10 million. 
During my ~60 months at a venture-backed startup, my team and I 
built a new product concept every eight months, on average. And with 
those eight months came a new target audience, a complete rebrand­
ing, and a “burn the ships” focus on moving ahead.
I thought that’s how life at a startup just was. Immense uncertainty. 
Gut calls after asking customers what they wanted. Full faith in the 
Lean Startup model. Rushing to get our “minimum viable product” 
out the door, only to “pivot” when we couldn’t find an audience. 
And pivot we did. 
What weren’t we getting right? 
www.it-ebooks.info

 Why Products Exist   |  5
I was getting beaten down and burned out. The data didn’t make any 
sense. People were signing up and saying they loved our products…but 
weren’t coming back. We had no idea why.
Looking for answers, I began to see the same patterns around me: 
slews of web and mobile apps “failing fast” while venture and angel 
money burned brightly. And nobody seemed to understand why, 
either. 
As an industry, we tend to fawn over successes at the expense of learn­
ing from the failures. There’s a dearth of data out there about startup 
deaths as compared to what we hear about the rare, unicorn-like suc­
cesses. Business advice and blogs in the startup and technology realms 
are plagued with survivorship bias.*
And that’s startling. Because from what we can gather from the past 20 
years, 62 out of 100 venture capital funds failed to beat returns avail­
able from public markets.† Even worse, only 20 of 100 funds generated 
returns that beat public markets by 3 percent annually. Half of these 
funds began investing—prior to 1995!
You could argue that these companies just ran out of money. Or had 
bad timing. Or that their technology was too expensive to build.
This may be so. But every one of these scenarios has a common thread: 
they each failed to find enough customers to keep them alive.
So I decided to study how successful products get made. And in doing 
so, I realized that our ability as designers to create beautiful, obvious, 
and, heck, even “viral” apps that, on the surface, seemed immensely 
popular had no bearing on whether a product actually worked. What 
did the creators of Facebook know that we didn’t? Why did Dropbox 
initially succeed despite being launched into a slew of competitors? 
How has Basecamp survived since 1999 as a simple project manage­
ment business?
Technology isn’t special, but we think it is. After all, the computer, the 
mobile phone, and the Internet are among the fastest-adopted tech­
nologies in history. The hopeful specter of instant distribution lingers 
over our heads, because, after all, it’s just so cheap to create something 
these days (see Figure 1-1).

conditioning. (Source: New York Times.*)
Why not just throw something out there and see if it works? And if it 
doesn’t work, why not just ask people what they’d like instead? 
But the rules of creating something that people want haven’t changed, 
even if we are creating products for an industry that barely existed 20 
years ago. Our judgment’s been clouded. Easy distribution and a blind 
dedication to “customer validation” has turned the lot of us lazy or, at 
worst, into newly spiritual people with prayerful intent. 
The practice of creating products that people want didn’t just beam in 
like an away team in a Star Trek episode. It’s been around for hundreds 
of years, a heritage enriched by many people alongside the path of an 
ever-maturing society. 
You want to design the product of the future? You’d better know your 
design history. 
So, what if I told you that we can trace how to create innovative, 
human-centered products to the 1920s, when a woman who couldn’t 
cook reinvented the modern kitchen? 
Unless there’s a DeLorean and a crazy, wide-eyed scientist involved, 
you probably wouldn’t believe me. But let me take you back.

Lillian and Frank Gilbreth: Revolutionizing 
Industries Through Observation
It’s 1924. Lillian Gilbreth’s husband, Frank, has just died. Together, 
they’d completely revolutionized the study of how people worked. 
Picture this: you’re a factory worker and two strangers ask you to attach 
mini lights to your fingers. Not only do they make you look like some 
perverted character from Edward Scissorhands, but they want to film 
you, with said fingerlights, with some newfangled, expensive camera. 
There’s no catch. You just do what you do every day at work. 
This was the Gilbreths’ pioneering creation: using what they called 
“motion studies” to analyze workers’ movements in slow motion.† 
With lights attached to their subjects’ fingers, the Gilbreths were able 
to capture the exact motions workers took to perform their jobs while 
recording them with a motion picture camera (Figure 1-2).‡, §

FIGURE 1-2
An example of the 
Gilbreths’ pioneering 
research. Called motion 
studies, they were 
used to research how 
workers performed 
their jobs to improve 
efficiency.
www.it-ebooks.info

8  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
The point? To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of how peo­
ple worked. Each observed movement was broken down into what the 
Gilbreths called “therbligs” (the reverse of Gilbreth)—hieroglyphic-like 
symbols that they used to document a workflow—to determine the 
best way to get a job done (Figure 1-3).* The end result? Making some­
thing happen with the least amount of effort in the least amount of 
time.
But as it turned out, all this was just buildup to a bigger plot. After 
Frank’s death, Lillian turned her attention to the kitchen—an under­
appreciated area of the home at the time—viewing kitchen work as 
“unpaid labor” that could be optimized like any other factory.
Lillian would become the first engineer to observe the home and bring 
efficiencies to it, using motion studies to analyze how women moved 
while they prepared food, cooked, and did the dishes.

their motion study 
research and broke

movements into easy-

It didn’t matter that Lillian couldn’t cook. By studying how women 
actually worked in their kitchens, she was able to observe the ineffi­
ciencies of food preparation and devise her own alternatives. One early 
test put on by the Herald Tribune showed that using Lillian’s kitchen 
layout reduced the number of steps from 281 to 45.† 
The kitchen you’re now used to cooking and eating in is based entirely 
on Lillian Gilbreth’s ethnographic research, which revolutionized 
kitchen design forever. By treating kitchens as something that could 
be optimized for humans, she invented concepts like the “work trian­
gle”—a concept that designers use to determine efficient kitchen and 
work layouts to this day.‡
Henry Dreyfuss: The Founding of Human-Centered Design
In parallel to the Gilbreths’ work, the self-taught founding father of 
human-centered design was making a name for himself in the 1930s: 
Henry Dreyfuss. 
For all intents and purposes, Dreyfuss could be considered the Steve 
Jobs of the early-to-mid 20th century, transitioning from a career in set 
design to industrial designer.
He defined the role as one that must embody many people: a researcher, 
guinea pig, engineer, artist, politician, and builder.§ 
We begin with men and women and we end with them. We con­
sider the potential users’ habits, physical dimensions, and psy­
chological impulses…for we must conceive not only a satisfactory 
design, but also one that incorporates that indefinable appeal to 
assure purchase.¶
It’s this mentality that makes him responsible for many of the most 
common, long-lasting products of the 20th century. The Bell Model 
302 telephone. The Honeywell T87 circular thermostat. The Polaroid 
Model 100.**

When the Bell Model 302 telephone was released in 1937, for example, 
it was a startlingly innovative design—taking into careful account how 
people used and held telephones. It’s one of the most iconic designs of 
the early 1900s, and gained ultimate fame with its frequent use on the 
set of I Love Lucy (Figure 1-4).*
Dreyfuss believed that good design could improve a company’s prof­
its. He was one of the first to market his services to potential clients 
as such—promoting “his ability to give insider knowledge—thinking 
about an object from the user end—and not just [to] create prettier 
objects, but better objects.”†
This was a huge shift in thinking at the time. Dreyfuss considered 
the role of a designer to be more than simply removing unnecessary 
ornamentation from a product after the fact. Instead, an industrial 
designer now had to understand how a product contributed to a cus­
tomer’s well-being to be successful.
He used Lillian Gilbreth’s transformative work in motion studies and 
observation to define how his clients’ products should be made—
observing a vast array of activities such as how trains were driven,

how manure was spread, and how phone companies conducted service 
calls. “There is no substitute for first-hand research in the matter of 
keeping up to the minute on the sales moods of the public,” he wrote.‡ 
Why this obsession with research? Because a company couldn’t afford 
to risk releasing a product that they didn’t know people wanted. Pretty 
products didn’t cut it. 
The penultimate example at the time was the 1936 Chrysler Airflow, a 
car that had millions of dollars sunk into its production and advertis­
ing. Yet it was a major failure for the company, because “the public’s 
taste and acceptance had not been accurately assessed.”§ 
Ultimately, Dreyfuss believed that his painstaking study and research 
would create products where “people are made safer, more comfort­
able, more eager to purchase, more efficient—or just plain happier.”¶ 
Neil McElroy: Inventing the “Brand Man”
We can continue to trace the origins of the product designer in busi­
ness to a typewritten memo from 1931, written by a manager at 
Proctor & Gamble—who would later become Secretary of Defense 
under President Eisenhower and create NASA.
It’s May 1931. Cincinnati, Ohio. Neil McElroy is responsible for grow­
ing sales for the Camay soap brand. It wasn’t going well, and he was 
being overshadowed by P&G’s Ivory soap.
McElroy realizes that the way his organization is structured is limiting 
his ability to make Camay successful. He’s unable to get the resources 
he needs to really understand who Camay is supposed to be serving. 
So he types a fateful memo on his Royal Typewriter and proposes a 
concept that would have a significant ripple effect—even on industries 
that didn’t even exist yet. He calls this the concept of the brand man 
(Figure 1-5).**

The brand man was a novel idea at the time. At companies like P&G, 
people were hired for specific business functions such as, say, sales or 
research or administration.* 
So what was different? The brand man—later, brand manager—was 
defined as the person responsible for guiding a product to success. 
This person would seek to understand the processes that worked and 
those that didn’t, examining “carefully the combination of effort that 
seems to be clicking and [trying] to apply this same treatment to other

territories that are comparable.” And this person would go into the 
field to measure the results of these plans, reporting back with data to 
tweak the group’s approach.† 
“Where brand development is light…study the territory personally at 
first hand,” he wrote. “Find out the trouble…develop a plan…outline 
this plan…prepare…all other necessary material for carrying out the 
plan…keep whatever records are necessary.”
Soon, P&G reorganized their company around this newly invented 
role, and McElroy went on to lead the company. Their competitors 
around the world copied them. 
Just like the work of Lillian Gilbreth and Henry Dreyfuss, McElroy’s 
“brand man” memo would have vast ramifications for product design 
as we know it. He couldn’t have foreseen that he would set the template 
for product management in software. 
In fact, it was a former P&G brand manager that would introduce 
McElroy’s concepts to software in 1981: Scott Cook, founder of Intuit. 
Their first product was Quicken. You may have heard of it.
Scott Cook: Bringing the Brand Manager to Technology
Software companies were on the rise in the early 1980s. As the 
development of new products got more complicated and engineers 
stretched too thin, usability tended to suffer. On top of that, products 
were becoming more and more consumer-oriented. 
Scott Cook was one of the first people to implement brand manager-like 
principles at a tech company. From day one, he sought out to observe 
customer needs and solve them with a product. 
At P&G, Cook learned that researching customer needs throughout a 
product’s lifecycle was the key to satisfying them. The research even 
brought him understanding beyond the development of the product 
to its pitch.‡ 
Breaking into software with this mentality brought Cook an advan­
tage at the perfect time. He believed that understanding their custom­
ers couldn’t come thirdhand or from management presentations. To

combat this, Cook conducted regular user studies and implemented a 
“Follow Me Home” program where Intuit staff would follow willing, 
first-time customers home. There, they’d observe how new customers 
installed and used Quicken. 
Cook combined these studies with the dissemination of mailed-in cus­
tomer complaint cards that were included in every box of Quicken. He 
also required everybody to answer customer service and support calls 
for “four hours each month, increasing to twelve hours a month when 
the company launched new products.”* 
Finally, he made product managers also oversee the product’s income 
statement and “all aspects of building the business…acting as cham­
pions for their products, embodying the voice of the customer not just 
for product development and marketing communications for also for 
technical support.”†
Why the History Matters
All of this traveling around in the DeLorean time machine has had a 
purpose: to show that the idea of designing a product with a human at 
the center isn’t new—and that the most iconic, long-lasting products 
in human history were built with the same easily identifiable methods.
The other purpose was to illustrate how difficult this process can be. 
It requires hundreds of hours of observation to understand what peo­
ple really do. 
And almost 30 years later, we’re now witnessing the rise of product 
design in software, much in the same tradition of those who came 
before us—the industrial designer, the brand manager, and those who 
pioneered their techniques. 
It’s not coincidental. Products are failing at more rapid rates than ever. 
We realize that a more human-centered worldview is required if digital 
products are going to be successful. 
That’s because the rapid adoption of the Internet and mobile technol­
ogy—and with it the possibility of instant distribution—has turned 
many of us over to bad habits. Making matters worse, our customers’ 
attention spans are fracturing. People are becoming lazier. New prod­
ucts need to work harder than ever to stand out and get attention.

 Why Products Exist   |  15
That means that digital products need people who understand their 
customers. The problems they face. And how to improve the product 
on an ongoing basis to help them be better at what they do. And, if 
you’re really good, to help them live better lives. 
Digital products need people who can then visualize and design the 
solution. Infuse the product with soul and personality. And steer its 
existence into reality by guiding the engineers, marketers, and other 
essential talents required to realize anything substantial.
What the History Tells Us
“Facts are better than dreams,” goes a famous phrase by Winston 
Churchill. 
This was the rationale by which he operated during World War II, even 
though he was publicly known for his grand, bold visions about how 
Britain would win the war. 
Anybody with an inkling of knowledge about Churchill and WWII 
would know that he was armed with an incredibly strong personality 
that, at times, intimidated those who worked for him. 
Churchill became so concerned that this would prevent his staff from 
delivering bad news during the war that he created an office separate 
from the normal chain of command. Its job? To deliver uncompromis­
ing, unfiltered news and facts about the war effort. 
Churchill relied on this Central Statistical Office to make every 
important decision during the war. It was headed by a civilian and 
tracked essential areas like aircraft production and losses, munitions 
production, and import/export balances. 
Churchill didn’t dream his way into helping the Allies win the war. He 
relied on observations of his staff to make decisions, using these facts 
to create a scenario for victory. 
That’s a common thread among people like the Gilbreths, Fords, 
McElroys, and Cooks of our product heritage. They painstakingly con­
ducted firsthand observations of their audience, and understood the 
context in which they existed even better than their customers did. 
Listening, studying, organizing—this common thread has its roots in 
a form of study called ethnography. 
www.it-ebooks.info

16  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Upgrading Ethnography for a Digital Era
Ethnography’s central premise is that you can learn what people actu­
ally do when nobody’s looking. You can tell how people live their lives 
by observing what they do and listening to what they say. By doing 
so, you’ll understand how people behave on their terms and not on 
yours. Ethnography enlightens us about the contexts in which custom­
ers might use a product, and how that affects the relative value of your 
product in their daily lives.
My journey to understand this practice took me to an unlikely place, 
leading me to the work of two individuals I’d never met: Amy Hoy and 
Alex Hillman. Their ideas helped me to see the patterns that the most 
successful products used to find customers. 
Hoy and Hillman invented a new approach—based purposefully on 
ethnography—to creating products people want: observing intently, 
listening without bias, and analyzing the patterns to invent an endless 
stream of product ideas.
The lessons are based upon the same ethnographic techniques that 
researchers have used for at least a hundred years to understand iso­
lated and insular cultures (a concept that oddly resembles many of our 
customer bases).
But this modern take on the ethnographic process takes advantage 
of the tools we now have at our fingertips: access to practically any 
audience we want and the ability to just sit back and listen. Hoy and 
Hillman taught me that if you observe and analyze without bias, cus­
tomers will tell you exactly what they wish they could buy.
Hoy and Hillman also taught me that if you look closely enough 
between the lines, you can observe the principles of listening, study­
ing, and organizing in a slew of successful products—modern, digital 
products like Dropbox, many of Apple’s offerings, and Product Hunt.
Time-Tested Techniques in Modern Products
DROPBOX
Drew Houston’s creation of Dropbox has been labeled for years as 
the quintessential example of the “minimum viable product.” The 
story goes that Drew couldn’t get funding for his idea of a seamlessly 
syncing file service. So he did what any aspiring entrepreneur did in 
2008: he made a video and submitted it to the online communities he 
frequented.
www.it-ebooks.info

 Why Products Exist   |  17
It was an instant hit, driving 70,000 new email subscribers through a 
simple landing page (Figure 1-6*).† 
But the lore surrounding this launch masks what really happened. 
Drew didn’t just get lucky. This was the embodiment of somebody who 
did the work to understand an audience, weaving that knowledge into 
his product and his pitch.
As an example, he got his audience’s attention by riddling the video 
with inside jokes and references only somebody who spent time in 
these online watering holes would recognize. 
But even more powerfully, he spoke directly to them, in their lan­
guage, about the problem his product solved:
The point is that if you’ve ever worked with multiple computers or 
carried around a USB drive or emailed yourself files from work, 
you can see that this is a much easier way of managing your stuff.
Normally, if I want to send something, I have to send an email 
attachment or something like that. But Dropbox has this special 
public folder where every file you put in here has a URL associ­
ated with it.

Luckily for us, the Reddit thread created in response to Drew’s video 
still lives. The responses are testament to the fact that both the pitch 
and the product got their attention. 
“Apple? You listening? This is how iDisk should work. Your dis­
mal effort is a total embarrassment.”
“So many more references to /b/ and teh interwebz i cant even 
count them all… :O”
“My Grandma is the sultan of stubborn! She just images parti­
tions into a file using ‘dd’ and uses ‘strings’ to find things that she 
wants. Still has to use ‘grep’ though! Crazy lady.”
Drew’s takeaways? The biggest risk of creating a product is “making 
something no one wants” (Figure 1-7).* Find customers by knowing 
“where [your] target audience hangs out & speak to them in an authen­
tic way.” 
APPLE
Mentioning Apple here might come as a shock to you. Can’t they get 
away without talking to customers because they’re special? Don’t they 
have a cult-like following that will buy absolutely anything?

Of course, Apple has a massive following that’s only expanded in the 
past few years. But while the company may have zealots, its ambitions 
aren’t to cater just to this crowd. To remain in business, Apple has to 
listen to its customers and immerse itself in their worlds.
When it comes to Apple, we can easily get swept away by anecdotes 
of perfectionist tantrums or demonstrations of borderline obses­
sive-compulsive disorder (Steve Jobs, according to one account, had 
the marble for the New York Apple Store floor shipped to his office 
in California to inspect the veining†). This makes it hard to analyze 
what’s staring us in the face: Apple builds products not by asking what 
people want, but by observing how they behave and imagining what 
could change their lives.
“We do no market research,” Jobs famously once said. “You can’t go out 
and ask people what the next big thing is.”‡ We frequently misinter­
pret this quote to mean that Apple simply trusted completely in their 
own sense of taste and refinement to choose what products to build. 
Instead, Jobs was saying that you can’t understand how to serve a cus­
tomer by asking him—you understand how to serve him by watching.
Jobs’s “own research and intuition, not focus groups, were his guide.”§ 
None of us are or ever will be Steve Jobs—but we can learn from 
actions here. Jobs didn’t give away Starbucks gift cards or take people 
to lunch to get their opinions and feedback. He didn’t send out email 
surveys to figure out what product to build next. He analyzed how peo­
ple used technology, learned what brought them joy, and understood 
especially well what pissed them off. 
We see parallels to this approach from other Apple members. Mitch 
Stein, who was the director of human interface technologies for Apple 
in the 1990s and coined the phrase “user experience,” explained a very 
similar process:¶
This is key. First, assimilate: You don’t ask the user what they 
want—you go out and live with them and literally become the 
user. You do it with a wide-angle lens. You do it not just to tackle

the problem you think you’re solving—you need to understand the 
culture they live in, what motivates them, that sort of stuff. I know 
that sounds touchy feel-y, but it really works.
Time Machine, the original iPhone, and iPhone 6 are three strong 
examples from Apple of observational research in action.
Time Machine 
Apple’s Time Machine is one of those easily overlooked products from 
the hardware and software giant. It’s not flashy, it’s embedded within 
the desktop operating system, and it’s only important when you really 
need it. 
But that’s the beauty of the product. It solves a searing pain that we all 
face using digital storage: what happens when your hard drive goes bad? 
Steve Jobs introduced Time Machine in 2008 with OS X Leopard.* 
Here was his pitch (Figure 1-8):
We’re using our computers not just to store our work documents 
but really our digital lives. We’ve got things on our computers now 
that used to be in our precious shoeboxes that would never get 
lost. But if you just lose one precious photograph you’d be really 
bummed. Imagine if you lost your whole library of photographs…
and yet almost no one backs up their computer automatically. 
Almost all of us do not.

We are just walking time bombs waiting to happen in terms of 
having something go wrong and misplacing some information. 
Mistakenly deleting it. Or worse.
This is what Time Machine is all about. We’d like to solve these 
problems in such a simple way that everyone actually uses it.
How did Jobs know that people had shifted away from shoeboxes in 
the closet and began using their computer hard drives in their place? 
How did he know what would get people to actually use a backup solu­
tion? Total immersion within his audience. 
Time Machine has been included in every single OS X release since 
2008, and it’s inspired products like iCloud backup and iCloud Photo 
Library.
iPhone
We all had cellphones. We just hated them, they were so awful to 
use. The software was terrible. The hardware wasn’t very good. 
We talked to our friends, and they all hated their cellphones too. 
Everybody seemed to hate their phones.† 
Call it talking to “friends” and family, but Apple didn’t ask their cus­
tomers to imagine OS X on a mobile phone. When you’re Apple, you 
have access to people in the upper echelons of music, video, mobile, 
and computing. They’re able to ask lots of “why” questions while 
immersing themselves in this environment, exploring their friends’ 
problems, needs, and wants, and how they make decisions. But just 
because the people who work at Apple have different friends than the 
average person doesn’t mean that they don’t have to do the work to 
understand what people want.
Jobs revealed in an interview that the decision to create the iPhone 
could be broken down into this simple framework:‡
What do we hate? (Our cellphones.) What do we have the tech­
nology to make? (A cellphone with a Mac inside.) What would we 
like to own? (You guessed it, an iPhone.)

iPhone 6 and 6 Plus
Fast forward to 2014. It was a different world from the one in 2007 
when the original iPhone was released. Larger screen sizes had 
become a major form factor in mobile usage. And, much to the cha­
grin of iPhone customers, Apple had stuck stubbornly to the 4” form 
factor of the iPhone 5 released in 2012. 
But Apple was listening. A leaked sales presentation revealed that 
Apple had been listening for at least a year. Growth rates were slowing. 
The strongest demand was coming from phones with larger screens 
that cost less. And competitors were spending “obscene” amounts of 
money to gain market share while simultaneously improving their 
hardware. “Consumers want what we don’t have,” a slide declared 
(Figures 1-9 and 1-10).

Just a year later Apple retooled its entire line of iPhones. The 6 and

larger than the iPhone 5. 
The result? The biggest profit in corporate history after the iPhone 
6’s launch. A quarter-over-quarter growth of iPhone sales of 57 per­
cent (74.5 million phones sold). And a drop for the first time ever in 
Android unit shipments (Figure 1-11).*

Devices, though, are only one side of Apple’s products. The company 
has always prided itself on integration within both hardware and soft­
ware. So it’s important to make note of a perceived degradation within 
Apple’s software efforts, as noted by user interaction expert Don 
Norman. He established the User Architect’s Office at Apple, and rose 
to become vice president of Apple’s Advanced Technology Group. He 
writes: 
I was once proud to be at Apple, proud of Apple’s reputation of 
advancing ease of use and understanding. Alas, these attributes 
are fast disappearing from their products in favor of pretty looks, 
or as designers call it “styling.”
Apple has gotten carried away by the slick, minimalist appearance 
of their products at the expense of ease of use, understandability, 
and the ability to do complex operations without ever looking at 
the manual.
Today, the products are beautiful, but for many of us, confusing. 
The fonts are pleasant to the eye, but difficult to read. The princi­
ple of “discoverability” has been lost. The only way to know what 
to do in many situations is to have memorized the action.*

PRODUCT HUNT
What started as an email list for friends and colleagues to share and 
keep track of new tech products is now one of the most fertile places 
for new products to launch, and for investors to seed new investments. 
Ryan Hoover started Product Hunt after repeatedly being asked by 
people in forums and on social networks about what he thought of 
new products.† Hoover was spending so much time talking about 
these new releases, but the experience was fractured. He had to scan 
places like Reddit, Hacker News, TechCrunch, and Twitter to get the 
news and discussions he wanted. 
He realized that others had the same problem.‡ Product addicts like 
himself were also spending hours a day skimming these sites, includ­
ing technology investors and founders eager to connect with willing 
audiences. 
“What cool new products are you using?” We all ask this ques­
tion. It’s a common conversation starter, especially in the startup 
community. I’m particularly fond of this topic—I enjoy geeking 
out about products, writing design deconstructions, and swapping 
discoveries with smart folks. But these conversations provide more 
than just entertainment value: They are also a great learning 
opportunity. Understanding the subtleties of good and bad prod­
ucts is critical for product builders.
Immersed within the audience, Hoover launched an early version of 
Product Hunt that was a simple email list. He reached out to people he 
knew would be receptive. 
Years of blogging, relationship building, and projects like Startup 
Edition have given me an audience and network of supporters. 
The term “startup” is deceiving. Successful companies don’t start 
up overnight; they are founded upon years of experience and help 
from others that must be earned.§
A year later, Product Hunt announced a $6.1 million Series A invest­
ment from Andreessen Horowitz.¶

So What?
So how does all of this help you? How does reading a bunch of history 
enable you to end the cycle of throwing stuff against the wall and hop­
ing that it works?
You don’t have to be a statistic of failure. You don’t have to be a part 
of the “fail fast” culture. You can change the trajectory of the technol­
ogy industry by using the principles that worked for those who came 
before us—Dreyfuss, the Gilbreths, McElroy, and Cook.
Just because technology enables rapid adoption and instant access to 
audiences doesn’t mean that humans have changed. People have prob­
lems. And people want other people to make those problems go away.
If this idea appeals to you, then you’re going to love the next section. 
We’re going to explore a modern version of ethnography invented by 
two entrepreneurs who were fed up by the culture of failure. Called 
Sales Safari, it’s an entirely new brand of observation that takes place 
online.
Ready? Let’s go.
Shareable Notes
•	 The idea of a product “failing fast” isn’t the only way products get 
made. This technique, in fact, runs counter to the way products 
have been made for over a hundred years. It’s a relatively new phe­
nomenon brought about by technology’s ability to distribute ideas 
around the world faster than any time in history.
•	 We can trace the origins of modern digital product design to our 
product forebears of the 20th century: Lillian Gilbreth, Henry 
Dreyfuss, Neil McElroy, and Scott Cook. Each conducted painstak­

Do This Now
•	 Spend some time researching Lillian Gilbreth, Henry Dreyfuss, 
Neil McElroy, and Scott Cook. Read their work. Research their 
methods. Look at the products they created as a result.
•	 The next time Apple has a keynote, listen to how they pitch their

Interview: Keenan Cummings
Keenan Cummings is a product-minded design leader and strategist, writer, 
and occasional illustrator. He’s currently at Airbnb, where he’s a Product 
Growth Lead and Design Manager. He co-founded Wander, which was 
acquired by Yahoo! in 2014.
You wrote a timely and thoughtful exposition that sought to reach a 
“working definition” of product design. What compelled you to want to 
explore the meaning of this emerging field, and what did you learn along 
the way?
I’ve been exploring these ideas for the past year and a half. I spend about 
three years working in more traditional graphic design fields (marketing, 
branding, advertising, print, etc.) and was generally dissatisfied with the 
nature of the problems I was tasked to solve. When the core objective is 
always to move more product off of shelves (an unfair generalization of 
the industry, but I’m describing the feelings I had at the time), you’re often 
left wanting something deeper. I saw admirable and interesting work being 
done in this field and people were calling it product design. 
So I jumped into this pretty full force, taking on some serious risk at a very 
unstable time for myself and my family. It was a figure-it-out-as-you-go 
period (and still very much is), so product design became whatever I was 
doing. The more work we put in on our product, the more that definition 
grew. I knew product design was bigger than what I had been doing before, 
but now I was seeing what it takes to conceptualize and build a product 
from nothing. 
The article was merely an ordering process. There was something that 
seemed a bit off in the way some fellow designers were thinking about 
product design. It seemed maybe too close to the kind of design I was doing 
before: narrow in scope and vision, and exclusive to the few that actually 
carried the title on the team.
Why is product design so hard to describe? What makes it “formless”? 
Is it because it’s such an emerging field, or is it because it encompasses 
such a vast range of skills (or both)?
Product design feels like it has form. We make tools. But alone those tools 
are not products. Products shape, encourage, guide, and change behavior. 
A hammer is a formed, manufactured, aesthetic object. But the product 
of its creation is the extension of the arm, an empowered behavior. This is 
a very hard thing to define precisely because it is a hard thing to design. 
There are few rules, a million variables, and always unexpected outcomes. 
www.it-ebooks.info

 Why Products Exist   |  29
Designers are always controlling the narrative, shaping audience percep-
tion, or walking viewers through an experience. But product designers have 
to give up that control and let the design process be about observation and 
response. You can see why an industry that has always defined itself by 
the associated hard skills (think of the traditional symbols of our discipline: 
letterpresses, Pica rulers, X-acto knives, Bezier curves) is at a loss when it 
is designing with behaviors and aspirations and impulses and motivations. 
The former process is so concrete that the latter can feel a bit like shaping 
a vase from smoke. 
I also think designers want to own product design, but because it is so large 
it is open to many disciplines. We are used to being the tastemakers (the 
very idea of “taste” is a destructive idea to the product design process) 
and the visionaries. We don’t have to give all of that up; we just have to be 
willing to share that responsibility with others. What seems to be the prime 
skill for a product designer is understanding people. And great typesetters 
or illustrators don’t have a monopoly on that (although I do think designers 
can have a leg up here—more on that later). 
How does one most effectively become a “cultural anthropologist” to 1) 
recognize behavioral patterns, and 2) understand the motivations behind 
them?
As I said before, product design is about understanding people. We have 
to get outside our own heads and that means tearing down a fortress of 
assumptions that keep us feeling comfortable in the world.
You have to constantly challenge how the world looks from your cozy spot 
in it. People will always surprise you. The only assumption I allow myself 
to entertain freely was something I read in The Internet and Everyone by 
John Chris Jones: “Design everything on the assumption that people are not 
heartless or stupid but marvelously capable, given the chance.”
But that is merely the observation part. Discovering and understanding 
motivations is a process of empathy. This is what I was referring to when 
I said designers have a leg up in learning product design. Design really is 
just a practice of empathy. It is about synthesizing culture and movements 
of ideas and distilling that into something interesting. Designers do this 
without thinking. They work with the intent to spread ideas. And they are 
good at making things that are spreadable. That comes from empathy. They 
get outside their own frame of reference so they can make something that 
touches the masses.
www.it-ebooks.info

And “taste” kills empathy. Taste is when you’ve amassed enough of those 
cultural influences that you start to believe the ideas and the cultural syn-
thesis comes from within. The moment that happens, you stop observing. 
You stop absorbing the influences because you see yourself as the source. 
It’s subtle, easy to miss. But slowly your source material narrows, your 
resources diminish, and you are left to repeat yourself. Culture goes on, 
dynamic and ever changing, and you are left with the same material to chew 
on. This is where “taste” leads you.
“Product design” is frequently equated with “entrepreneurship.” How is 
product design different than entrepreneurship?
It’s tough to draw the line between the two. Most entrepreneurs will need 
to practice some form of product design to be successful. But there is a dis-
tinction between starting and running a business and designing a product. I 
could go open up a furniture shop next week, following the well-worn path 
of smart business practices. My challenges might involve inventory, oper-
ations, and sales. For some entrepreneurs, these are solely business chal-
lenges that need to be managed rather than designed around. 
But, instead of following that well-worn path, I could be IKEA. You could 
picture a corporate headquarters divided between the b-school grads on 
one side, running the operation, and the artists on the other side, dreaming 
up new product to fill their shelves. But what makes them who they are is 
that they are not, at the operations level, a bunch of businessmen. They are 
a company of product designers. They are always thinking about new ways 
of designing, shipping, building, and selling furniture. 
Entrepreneurs that don’t practice product design can build strong business, 
but they are usually not very interesting. It’s the combination of business 
acumen and product design skill that yields companies that change things 
and endear us to them.
What steps have you taken to understand and build for your customers? 
How do you come to know their needs and expectations, and how do you 
build for those needs and expectations?
I have done some customer research in more formal settings. I’ve sat behind 
the two-way glass and watched dozens of users walk through the same 
set of questions. We had to reach benchmarks of comprehension to get 
approval by the FDA for a medication packaging project. This was rough 
work.
www.it-ebooks.info

 Why Products Exist   |  31
That kind of research has its place. But I think the more natural process most 
designers go through is ambient and semi-conscious. It’s an attraction to 
what’s cool, what’s interesting. You might consider it an extroverted activity 
where art is introverted (although a lot of designers, myself included, might 
be socially introverted).
I am fascinated by what fascinates people. Early on, I wanted to find those 
interesting things and share them. I still do this, and can get embarrassingly 
passionate about a burger joint or a brand of shoes. But at some point, you 
realize you can make those things, and the easiest way to make them is by 
repurposing the stuff that you know is already working. Instead of making 
something entirely new, you mimic and mix until you get something that 
fits with everything else that was already interesting but has the integrity 
to stand on its own. 
In concrete terms, I read and watch and collect all these cultural bits and 
try to dismiss nothing but experience as much as I can. That is hard to do—I 
am tempted to go deep on one thing—but getting a real range of influences 
starts to show up in your work.

How to Create Products 
People Want
Avoiding “Ego-First Development”
“What if you launch your product…and nobody buys it?” 
These were the words that compelled me, as a would-be graduate of 
the 30×500 bootcamp (a class that teaches people how to create and sell 
their first products), to become a student. It was a moment that would 
change my life. 
Less than six months after graduating from the course, I created two 
products from scratch that made more money with fewer customers 
than the venture-backed startup I was a part of for almost five years. 
This is a testament to the 30×500 approach: it forces product creators 
to cut directly to the heart of why a product should exist: to find a 
customer.
Again, these sentiments aren’t new. I was paraphrasing Peter Drucker’s 
words from almost 50 years ago: “the purpose of the enterprise is to 
create a customer.”*
Talk about cutting directly to what’s been causing technology’s all-too-
frequent product failures.

That’s, in fact, one of the motivations Hoy and Hillman had for creat­
ing the 30×500 bootcamp: railing against the phenomenon they call 
“ego-first development”: thinking that a product or idea is special just 
because it’s yours. 
It’s a fallacy that sets you up for failure. It creates an endless cycle of 
throwing ideas against the wall with the hopes of finding something 
that works. Hoy puts it like this:
The core problem with so many businesses is that they’re based on 
what the business owner wants. They’re fantasizing about being 
the hero: “I’m going to ride in on my white ‘software’ horse, and 
save these poor people.”*
Their programs have produced some incredible statistics since start­
ing in only 2011. Students who have never created a product in their 
lives have gone on to make tens of thousands of dollars for themselves 
in the first few months after following the 30×500 framework. Other 
product rookies were generating five figures in recurring revenue after 
only a few months. Their students have gone on to gross over $2 mil­
lion in aggregate sales over the bootcamp’s lifespan—despite the fact 
that the course is offered on an extremely limited basis.
One of their core teachings is this: creating a product based primarily 
on what you want focuses the product in exactly the wrong direction. 
When you do so, the primary benefit becomes the fact that you’ve cre­
ated it, instead of what your product can do for others.
Ego-first development flies in the face of everything we’ve explored 
about how successful products are made. That’s because, as we’ve 
seen, concocting a product idea is really an act of listening. And with­
out knowing who you’re serving and what they need, building product 
is simply another form of optimistic speculation.
But wouldn’t the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop that’s been 
popularized by the Lean Startup model solve this problem? Isn’t the 
right path to “validate” your ideas with a “minimum viable product” 
through customer interviews? 
The methodology behind the 30×500 class openly challenges what’s 
become common wisdom and all-too-frequent buzzwords in tech­
nologyland. Notions of “customer validation,” “minimum viable 
product,” and “pivoting” have successfully woven themselves deep

into startup culture. But startup deaths aren’t letting up,† despite the 
influx of capital and talent into technology startups and the occasional 
high-profile successes like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Airbnb in recent 
years.‡ Despite the flood of cheap and eager money, 70 percent of dead 
technology companies were in the Internet sector. 
The core tenet of the ready-fire-aim approach found in the Lean 
Startup framework is believing that one can find customers—and the 
right product to build—by asking what they want. 
But this is an inherently flawed notion, because doing so relies upon:
•	 Your ability to get your ego out of the way and to ask exactly the 
right questions at the right time from the right people.
•	 Your potential customers being rational or aware enough to iden­
tify their own habits, wax eloquently about what bothers them, 
and express what would make them happy.
•	 A freely accessible pool of people who aren’t going to tell you just 
what you want to hear, and who don’t change their habits after you 
interview them.
Hillman likens this belief to the dichotomy between observing lions 
in the zoo and how they behave in the wild:
Imagine going to see the lions on display in the zoo. Now imagine 
seeing the same species of lion in the wild on an African safari. 
Technically, you’re looking at the same animal both times. But 
they behave differently in the wild than they do in captivity.
You wouldn’t make a judgment call about what MOST lions do 
based on a lion in a zoo, because MOST lions aren’t in zoos.§
So, what happens when you observe your customers like you’d observe 
lions on a safari? What happens when creating a new product isn’t an 
exercise in the “extreme uncertainty” espoused by the Lean Startup 
model? 
You’ll know what your customers’ problems are. You’ll know what 
makes them happy and how they speak with each other. You’ll know 
exactly what to say and how to say it to pique their interest. And, ulti­
mately, you’ll know how to make them want to use your product.

This approach forms the basis of 30×500’s modern ethnographic 
approach. Fittingly called “Sales Safari,” it’s a system that observes 
what your customers are already doing and turns those habits into the 
basis for product ideas. 
Let’s take a look at Sales Safari now.
Find Product Ideas with Sales Safari
Going on a Sales Safari is the process of uncovering product ideas 
hiding in plain sight. It places the work of coming up with these ideas 
on your potential customers, and lays a foundation for repeatable suc­
cess. Based on the observation techniques used by Lillian Gilbreth and 
Henry Dreyfuss, Sales Safari is what Amy Hoy—the method’s inven­
tor—calls “net ethnography.” 
“Sales Safari is ‘net ethnography,’ combined with some close reading 
and empathy,” she says. “[It’s] step-by-step empathizing with your cus­
tomer to understand them.”
In case you’ve forgotten, ethnography’s central premise is that you can 
learn what people actually do when they’re not aware that you’re look­
ing. By observing what people do and say, you’ll understand how they 
behave on their terms and not on yours. 
Why’s this important when creating products? Because this observa­
tion enlightens us about two really important things: the contexts in 
which customers might use a product, and how that affects the relative 
value of your product in their daily lives. 
“The key is you start by observing what [your customers] actually 
already do,” Hoy continues. “You don’t try to persuade a vegetarian to 
buy Omaha Steaks. You look at what they actually do in real life on the 
Internet. What they read. What they share with each other. The prob­
lems they discuss. What things that they ask help for. How they help 
others.”
What’s particularly unique about Sales Safari is that it takes place 
entirely online, for a number of reasons:
Access
You can reach almost any unique community that exists on Earth 
without leaving your chair.

 How to Create Products People Want   |  37
Speed
Online research affords tons of conveniences like search engines, 
copy and paste, and more. Doing offline research is much harder 
to complete—and much harder to obtain without it being tainted 
by your presence.
A reliable record
When people are speaking in “meatspace,” you either have to 
remember what they said, scribble notes, or awkwardly record 
your conversation. Online observation, though, is out there for 
you to read and parse at your leisure. 
Time to analyze
Online observation provides “the ability to disassociate what some­
one is saying from what you interpret them saying,” says 30×500 
coteacher Alex Hillman. 
Distance
You’re not physically present to influence anybody’s opinions, 
nor are you tempted to pull the research pitch—the act of pitch­
ing your product while asking people what they want. “People 
need to not know that you’re there watching,” Hillman continues. 
“That sounds really creepy to say it that way, but there’s a reason 
for it. This is professional lurking if you want to look at it that way. 
You’re there to watch what they do and say when they don’t know 
that you’re there.”
Perspective
You literally have access to the entire Internet to find people in a 
particular audience. You’re not limited to a local Meetup or user 
group; instead, you can get the full picture of an audience’s pains 
from around the world. 
Sales Safari’s intentional distance is designed to avoid the pitfalls of 
asking questions and influencing your subjects. In ethnographic cir­
cles, this is known as avoiding the “Margaret Mead problem.” Her 
story is a cautionary tale, and a predominant example of how being too 
close to the people you’re studying can distort the truth. 
It’s 1928. Anthropologist Margaret Mead has finished writing her 
book, Coming of Age in Samoa, a study of the lives of teenage girls 
there: how they came of age, what their family structures were like, 
and so on. 
www.it-ebooks.info

38  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
The quick-and-dirty of the Mead story is that she lived with the vil­
lagers, asked about their lives, and listened to their stories—many of 
which were later revealed to have been made up by her teenage sub­
jects. She took these stories at face value instead of observing their 
behavior.* Years later, anthropologist Derek Freeman returned to the 
village, where the now-elderly teenage girls from Mead’s study admit­
ted to making up stories just for fun.† 
That’s why observing people and not asking them is at the center of cre­
ating products that find a customer. And creating products that find 
customers depends on finding their pain.
Sales Safari’s designed to root out people’s pain. Because if you can 
discern what people’s problems are, then chances are you’re the one 
who’ll be able to solve those problems.
“People walk around trying to tune out their problems, because they 
don’t expect that they can solve them,” says Hoy. “You have to reflect 
back to them. ‘Hey, this is the problem that you’re having. You know, 
it’s a big deal, but also we can fix it together.’”
Pain and problems—revealed by observation and empathy. It’s not a 
flashy notion, nor is it particularly groundbreaking. But it’s been at the 
center of how successful products get made for over a century. 
But by using modern online tools, Sales Safari can help you to start 
recognizing the patterns among your audience. 
“In order for someone to go on the Internet and ask a question of a 
group of strangers about how to solve their problem, [it’s] a very strong 
indicator of the level of pain they’re in,” Hillman says. “Even if it seems 
like very little pain to you. Like, ‘Oh, that’s so simple. Here’s how to fix 
it.’ It’s awesome that you think that, but that’s clearly not where they’re 
coming from. Otherwise, they would have fixed it by now.”
But how does Sales Safari help you uncover people’s problems? How 
does it help you to create products that will be used by more than just 
a few people? 
Sales Safari works by observing “at scale.” That means spending not 
just a few hours, but dozens to hundreds of hours, analyzing your 
audience.

This, of course, implies that you’ve done the work beforehand to know 
where your audience or your customers hang out online. What forums, 
mailing lists, and link-sharing sites do they frequent? What are they 
writing in customer support emails or product reviews? 
Then, it’s on to what Hoy says requires “close reading,” a study tech­
nique that’s meant to uncover layers of meaning in text. When you 
close read, you’re focusing on the way the person writes, how they see 
the world, or how they argue a particular point.‡ 
But we’re not doing this for literary analysis. We’re doing this to under­
stand what people want. 
And close reading, when used to understand an audience, uncovers a 
series of data points that will begin to form patterns. 
“You start collecting jargon, some of their specific detailed language 
and words they use to describe the problem,” Hillman says. “Elements 
and contributions to their worldview, their deep-seated beliefs that are 
unshakable. Then also the things that they talk about, they recom­
mend. The things that they buy.”
Doing this can be overwhelming at first. It certainly was for me 
when I started studying designers as an audience. But what I found 
through Sales Safari led me to create both this book and two success­
ful products. 
And, to be honest, this is hard work. Hours will tick by. Probably days, 
actually. Pages upon pages of the Internet will be scoured. But it’s 
work that the average person doesn’t do. Because it’s so easy to base 
a product idea on a handful of data points—a few coffee shop inter­
views, or what your friends and family think. 
But Sales Safari’s power is that it’s a system designed to do two things: 
gather tons of data and help you analyze that data.
“[People] get one data point or they get one potential client or cus­
tomer, and they think, ‘All right. This is it. I’m going to do [make this 
product].’ That’s really a recipe for failure,” Hoy says. “You need to 
keep doing whatever research you’re doing until it all comes together. 
It’ll seem fruitless up until the point where it immediately, like the 
‡	  http://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/how-do-close-reading

clouds will part and a ray of sunshine will burst through. People like 
to go on one data point, because it doesn’t take any work and because 
it feels right. It’s bad, though. Bad idea.”
Gathering tons of data points means that you’ll start to notice patterns 
trickling into your notes. Eventually, you’ll be able to categorize them: 
How does your audience see the world? What do they dwell on? How 
do they speak? What products do they use? 
And, eventually, you’ll start noticing the most important element of 
all: what your audience’s problems are, written in their own words. 
So, what happens when you’re able to empathize with a set of people, 
create something that they want, and pitch it to them in their own 
words? Sounds like you have an endless source of product ideas upon 
which to build. 
As Hoy puts it, “The process is essentially, figure out what hurts them. 
Reflect that back to them in a very empathetic, understanding way. 
And then offer them assistance.” 
And, applied over time, Sales Safari will help you track how your audi­
ence gradually changes. Tastes evolve. Worries morph. New pains are 
uncovered. 
It’s really that simple, in theory—but only by actually putting it into 
practice will you and your product reap the benefits.
Plot the Pain
It can be difficult to sift through the heft of the raw data you gather 
during the course of Sales Safari research. Lots of your key insights 
will be tied up in text files or on sticky notes. There’s a better way to 
visualize the data. 
Enter the Pain Matrix (Figure 2-1). No, it’s not a medieval torture 
device—it’s a tool I invented to help me understand my own research 
data, and it can be a tool you use to help your team understand your 
customers better. This will help you zero in on your customers’ pain, 
understand what makes them happy, and focus your product ideas.

Note these characteristics of the Pain Matrix:
•	 The horizontal axis, from left to right, is where you’ll track your 
audience’s pain. What do they mention, and how intense is it? 
•	 The vertical axis, from bottom to top, represents the frequency of 
pain. How often did you find this pain mentioned in your data? 
When you plot out your research in this matrix, the four quadrants 
will emerge: 
Upper right
Frequently occurring, intense pain. If a product can alleviate 
whatever is plaguing your audience in this quadrant, this is where 
you want to be to bring the most joy to your audience. 
Lower right
Infrequent, yet intense pain. Products in this category might 
be nice-to-haves, surprising your audience if they were properly 
addressed.

Upper left
Little pinpricks of pain that occur often. Products in this category 
might address smaller problems like administrative challenges or 
things that people label “it is what it is,” and provide a customer 
“little wins.” 
Lower left
Little pain happening infrequently. This is something that might 
appear like an opportunity while steeped in the details of your 
data, but reveals itself to be a low-opportunity product to build 
when you step back to look at the bigger picture. 
What tends to emerge is that the four quadrants start to fill up with 
very specific kinds of pain:
Upper right
Hate, fear, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, feeling stupid, getting 
stuck, wasting precious time
Lower right
Procrastination, self-doubt, guilt
Upper left
Minor irritations, dislikes
Lower left
Boredom
Doing all of this work takes time, yes, but the results you get are abso­
lutely indispensable. You’ll have confidence that you can build some­
thing that you know people will want. You’ll discover the fastest route 
to building the right solution. And you’ll be immune to the idea of 
“failing fast”—because failing is no longer part of the product creation 
process.
What Does a Product Designer Do?
[A designer] takes pride in a skill based on experience and an alert­
ness sometimes interpreted as vision. He approaches every problem 
with a willingness to do painstaking study and research and to 
perform exhaustive experimentation. He is equipped to work intel­
ligently with the engineer, the architect, the physicist, the interior 
decorator, the colorist, and the doctor. He must know how far to go 
and when to stop. He must be part engineer, part businessman, part

salesman, part public-relations man, artist, and almost, it seems 
at times, Indian chief. He operates on the theory that it is better to 
be right than to be original; therefore, he steers a course somewhere 
between daring and caution. If the merchandise doesn’t sell, the 
designer has not accomplished his purpose.
—HENRY DREYFUSS, DESIGNING FOR PEOPLE
Barring any potentially politically incorrect characterizations in the 
preceding quotation, Dreyfuss might as well be talking about modern 
digital product design. 
If we accept that a digital product’s purpose is to serve a customer (and 
I hope that you can after all of the history we’ve explored together), 
then a product designer’s primary job is to understand the audience 
they’ve chosen to serve. 
Once that’s in place, the product designer’s job is crafting the product 
that will best serve that audience—and, in the process, taking on a 
slew of intersecting roles required to get the right product across the 
finish line.
But it’s so easy to get caught up in the echo chamber of the 
self-congratulatory technology community. Product design has, in 
some circles, become synonymous with the glossy, the beautiful, and 
the stylish. 
Sales Safari helps us understand that a product has to be built with a 
customer in mind, and it has to follow through on its promise. 
In other words, product designers aren’t artists, nor are they solely 
focused on the aesthetic. 
“What am I helping them do? What am I helping them achieve or 
feel or whatever it is?,” Kyle Bragger, cofounder of photography site 
Exposure, asks. “For me, those two things are way bigger than, ‘How 
does it look? What are the features? What is the aesthetic? What does 
the stack look like?’ Any of the other components of that don’t really 
matter until you’ve figured out who you’re building for and what it is 
that you’re actually creating.” 
Everything else flows from the audience and what they want. Including 
the visual. It’s always in service to the customer.

This isn’t meant to discount the value of a so-called pretty experience. 
Aesthetics certainly have their place: they make a product appealing, 
more trustworthy, and more of a joy to use. 
But we do a disservice to product design if we place too much empha­
sis on what’s on the surface. 
While it’s constantly evolving, a product designer’s role is an absorp­
tion of a number of disciplines into a single role that used to require 
separate positions. 
Let’s examine these merging roles now, and the characteristics they 
bring with them.
Entrepreneur
Identifies needs in the market and finds ways to satisfy those 
needs. It can be an opportunity great or small, external or inter­
nal, obvious or nuanced. This is the person who’s willing to take 
a risk and back it up with hard work, determination, and team 
building. For a product designer, this typically means being able 
to identify opportunities to better serve one’s customer and imag­
ining tangible solutions to carry out this vision. It includes the 
ability to create and share this product vision with other teams.
Product manager
The product manager is, in the words of technology veteran Josh 
Elman,* helping “your team (and company) ship the right product 
to your users.” While it’s different in every company, a product 
manager builds a process to interpret ideas and feedback from 
all areas of the company—analytics, communications, trust and 
safety, support, operations, legal, international, and design (a 
technique at Twitter named “ACT SOLID”). This feedback also 
incorporates a deep understanding of the product’s audience and 
the necessary research to achieve this understanding. The product 
manager then uses this feedback to decide the product priorities, 
driving the organization to build products in a timely manner that 
meet these goals. 
Typically, the roles of a product manager and a designer have 
been separate. Designers have been responsible for the so-called 
solution space, inventing solutions to solve the problems found by

product managers. Product managers, in turn, have traditionally 
been responsible solely for the problem space, uncovering custom­
ers’ desires and problems and making market projections.
These roles, though, can be difficult to separate. Product design­
ers are not only expected to possess the skills of problem-finding 
product managers, but they’re also expected to be able to imple­
ment the solution. Combining these skills in one person can dra­
matically decrease time-to-market, increase a team’s coordination, 
and improve quality.
A product designer should now be able to talk with customers, 
understand their needs and goals, and understand the market 
enough to design innovative solutions. Instead of creating product 
specifications with the designed solution to follow, they are able 
to work through the actual product designs themselves and create 
solutions with a firm foot in reality.
But in larger companies, a product manager might be required 
to manage the sheer volume of organizational coordination and 
team building. At Facebook, for example, product teams comprise 
both product managers and product designers. Both have overlap­
ping skills, and if a product manager lacks a product designer on 
their team, they’re expected to pick up the slack.† 
Interaction designer
Envisions how people will experience a product and brings to life 
refined, inspired experiences with the goal of leaving a lasting 
impression. Thinks in terms of user flows and creates mockups of 
the user interface. This is an individual that can internalize what 
a user might need at any given stage and fight for their satisfac­
tion. For product designers, this means having a strong ability to 
solve experience problems both within an existing visual system 
and with new, extensible patterns they create. Product designers 
should also be able to document these new patterns for the team.
Visual designer
Creates beautiful concoctions of color, space, typography, iconog­
raphy, and illustration to help people navigate a product. Fluent in 
what constitutes so-called “good design” across all types of media,

including apps, websites, advertising, and more. For a product 
designer, this typically means having strong visual design skills 
that are both original and aesthetically intuitive. 
Motion designer
Understands how motion influences interaction design and uses 
it to reduce confusion, lend a helping hand, and make the experi­
ence fun. Collaborates heavily with visual and interaction design­
ers and uses motion to create a product personality instantly 
recognizable and wholly one's own. For a product designer, this 
typically means being able to identify well-constructed motion 
in other products or to invent original animations in prototyping 
tools or code.
Prototyper
Using whatever tools are best for the job, a prototyper brings to life 
interactions or user flows to determine what’s the best experience. 
This person could create a prototype with a variety of tools with 
varying degrees of fidelity, including HTML and CSS, JavaScript, 
Adobe AfterEffects, Quartz Composer and Origami, Framer.js, 
InVision, or actual code. For a product designer, this means being 
able to implement one’s own interaction and user flows. The bene­
fit of this is being able to test ideas quickly, proliferate those ideas, 
and zero in on the best solution for the desired experience.
Data analyst
Understands the challenges a product intends to solve, and pro­
vides data on product usage for informed decision making. Able 
to create and interpret A/B tests, synthesize large volumes of data, 
and make sense of the trends. Knows how to set up tests and what 
user data to gather and when. For a product designer, this skill is 
typically demonstrated by a working knowledge of which data is 
significant to making a decision, an understanding of the impact 
of design decisions through data, and the ability to identify choke­
points where tests can be set up.
User researcher 
A champion of customers and an expert at gathering both their 
insights and feedback. Designs, executes, and acts on ethno­
graphic research and user experience evaluations to affect product 
strategy and product roadmaps. Helps the organization connect 
with the customer in a meaningful way. For a product designer, 
www.it-ebooks.info

this skill is embodied by a deep understanding of the domain for 
which the product is being built. It’s an individual who’s able to 
translate what customers say into product vision, individual fea­
tures, and marketing language. 
Psychologist
Knowing that we’re all human and each subject to various influ­
ences, base instincts, and emotional draws, a user psychologist 
brings a larger human perspective to the task of creating enjoyable, 
emotionally engaging experiences. Has a basic understanding of 
cognitive psychology, heuristics, empirical research, and empathy. 
For a product designer, this means being able to understand cus­
tomer behaviors and the motivations behind them. It then pro­
vides the motivations to act on certain product features—creating 
habit-forming products by knowing what delights a human being 
in a particular context. 
Copywriter
A person who’s able to craft appealing, contextual, and easily 
understood copy to a specific audience. Has an excellent vocabu­
lary and exercises proper grammar. For a product designer, this 
means balancing clarity with the personality of the product being 
built. It also means fighting for properly formed sentences. 
Project manager
Has the responsibility of driving a project to meet its stated goals. 
This role requires balancing the four pillars of the project man­
agement superfecta: time, cost, quality, and scope. For a product 
designer, this is an essential part of the role and a constant dance 
between engineering and the needs of the business. What features 
are essential? What are nice-to-haves? What if everything seems 
essential—how do you choose what to trade to meet a deadline? 
Product designers must have the skills to navigate these muddy 
questions and deliver a satisfying product. 
Product marketer
Is the link between the product and its intended audience. This 
can include internal groups like sales or public relations, as well 
as clients, customers, and partners. This person helps the prod­
uct organization understand what should be built and keeps track 
of how customers and the market as a whole react to new prod­
uct launches. Before the product is built, product marketers will 
www.it-ebooks.info

48  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
perform market research to help determine where new product 
development should head. After the product is built, they take care 
of launch marketing and all relevant materials required to sell it. 
A product designer embodies this role when they work with mar­
keting to make sure that the product’s promise matches the public 
story. They’ll determine what the release plan should be, and work 
with engineering through the launch process to fix problems and 
communicate what’s happening with both the organization and 
the outside world.
Customer support representative and community manager
These are the people on the front lines, who regularly take the 
brunt of problems when things go wrong. And in the rare event of 
praise, they identify the parts of a product that are doing their job. 
They’re advocates for customers having problems, and exude the 
product’s and the brand’s promise through their interactions. A 
product designer knows how to identify and categorize this messy 
feedback, from catastrophic to nice-to-haves. They’ll be a bridge 
between Support and Engineering, and might even be a fixture 
in the community, serving as a nexus for their customers’ candid 
feedback.
These have traditionally been separate roles in an organization. Many 
of them still are, and many will continue to be for some time. But they 
each have a role in the toolset of a product designer. 
It’s obviously impossible, though, for a product designer to be an 
expert in every one of these fields. The role lives at the nexus of all 
of them. Implementing a product requires knowledge and practice of 
each of these disciplines. 
Typically, though, a person in this role tends to specialize in a set of 
these skills. It happens to product designers much like it happens to 
characters in role-playing games, or RPGs. RPGs typically start new 
games by requiring players to build custom characters. Players are 
asked from the start to choose characters specializing in a particular 
“class” of skills, such as a bounty hunter, a hacker, or a soldier. Over 
the course of the game’s storyline, the player is given the opportunity 
to “level up” their skills, and can choose to either be a well-rounded 
character or one that has deep experience in a few particular skills.

Just because the words “product designer” may not be in your job 
title doesn’t mean that it’s not your role. Titles like “Product Manager 
& Lead Designer,” “Product Owner,” or even the classic “Product 
Manager” are going to require you to employ product design–like 
thinking and skills. 
So how do you sift through the research you’ve gathered? How do you 
know where to point your product? 
To answer that, let’s take a closer look at the Pain Matrix, the tool I 
invented for analyzing my own research data, in the next chapter.
Shareable Notes
•	 Product design is a process that starts and ends with completely 
understanding your audience. This takes painstaking firsthand 
research before you even start building a product.
•	 Sales Safari is a modern approach to ethnography. It’s the process 
of choosing an audience, seeing where they hang out online, and 
lurking in these communities to analyze their wants and needs. 
•	 You can use the Pain Matrix to make sense of your original 
research by plotting your data.
•	 A product designer is a role that exists at the nexus of a slew of 
skills: anthropologist, product manager, copywriter, interaction 
designer, and more. It’s a reflection of how important technology 
has become to our culture.
Do This Now
If you accept that product design starts and ends with an intimate 
understanding of how you can serve a customer, then identify the 
following:
•	 Who is the customer for which your product exists? 
•	 Where do these people congregate online? 
•	 What do you understand about them? What can you learn about 
them by reading their forum posts, App Store reviews, or support 
emails? 
•	 Plot their pains on the Pain Matrix. Compare it to the problems 
your product is currently tackling. How do they match up? What 
has your product been missing?

Interview: Amy Hoy and Alex Hillman
Entrepreneur and teacher Amy Hoy invented Sales Safari, an online ethno-
graphic technique she teaches in a course called 30×500. Sales Safari has 
transformed lives—30×500 students have grossed over $2 million in their 
individual product businesses within the past two years.* She teaches this 
technique, among many others, with her business partner Alex Hillman.
What is 30×500? And what is Sales Safari?
Amy: 30×500 is Alex’s and my class for creative people. They can learn 
to create and sell their first products, because working and doing creative 
stuff for somebody else for hire, it’s very different than selling directly. 
You’re insulated from the market realities. You don’t understand quite what 
people want, except your boss. 
It’s very difficult to go from school and job and then freelance to create a 
product. A lot of people fail, because they don’t understand how different 
it is. So our class gives them those skills that they can go and launch some-
thing and make money.
Alex: And Sales Safari really started as just one of the components of that 
class. When we first set out to create it, the first version was actually called 
“the Year of Hustle.” 
What was interesting when we started teaching that version of the class, 
which is everything leading up to launch, a bunch of the components of that 
were…we didn’t think they were all that high level, but we learned over time 
just through teaching that things like “take notes” and “go do research on 
your audience” aren’t really specific enough. 
So Sales Safari’s really become the heart of the 30×500 class. Arguably, the 
majority of the lessons themselves, the exercises are tied directly to it, when 
originally, it was just one step of many.
Amy: I don’t know if it was so much one step of many as that we would say 
things like “go study,” “go read what your audience is writing, study it, and 
make notes. And use that.” People don’t understand how to go study, read, 
or make notes.
For a lot of college-educated people, none of that makes sense at all.

Alex: It’s step-by-step. Every component is a “here’s not just what to do,” 
but specifically how to do it. Here’s the results that you get. And here’s 
to know whether or not you’re doing it right, because you’re going to use 
those results in the next component. Things like that.
Amy: What is really is, Sales Safari is “net ethnography,” combined with 
some close reading and empathy. Like step-by-step empathizing with your 
customer to understand them. 
Alex: Also sort of a built-in feedback loop. Once you start applying those 
Sales Safari data, you’re collecting categories of notes, things like the pain 
that you notice in people. Not just the pains, like what the problem is, but 
also how they describe it. 
You start collecting jargon, some of their specific detailed language and 
words they use to describe the problem. Elements and contributions to 
their worldview, their deep-seated beliefs that are unshakable. Then also 
the things that they talk about, they recommend. The things that they buy.
All these things where the individual data points can be valuable, but the 
goal of Sales Safari is to have a systematic and repeatable approach, so you 
can collect a ton of it. A ton of data, because without a ton of data, you can’t 
find the patterns. Without patterns, you can’t make smart decisions about 
the business.
Amy: Yeah, people who go and they, especially designers, developers, writ-
ers, they think, “I’m going to make a product.” They get one data point or 
they get one potential client or customer, and they think, “All right. This is it. 
I’m going to do it.” That’s really a recipe for failure. 
You need to keep doing whatever research you’re doing until it all comes 
together. It’ll seem fruitless up until the point where it immediately, like the 
clouds will part and a ray of sunshine will burst through. 
People like to go on one data point, because it doesn’t take any work and 
because it feels right. It’s bad, though. Bad idea.
I cannot tell you how many friends, and early on students before we learned 
to discourage them, went and said, “All right. Well, my local bar, restau-
rant, salon has this stacked scheduling problem. I’m going to make software 
for it.” They think they identified a problem that they were going to solve, 
but they didn’t understand salons at all. They watch them misuse pieces of 
paper to do this rough scheduling, but they didn’t understand that these 
people never buy software, ever. If they bought software, they wouldn’t 
have this problem to start with.

52  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
We have seen staff scheduling issues for local businesses come up four or 
five times over the past few years. It’s always a failure, because you can 
observe someone doing a task and not understand the bigger context. And 
the way that you understand a greater context is long-term observation, 
like many different intervals. 
Alex: Then the other part to that is if you ask them to show how they use 
it, you’re instantly at a disadvantage, because they know you’re watching 
over their shoulder. That instantly creates changes, even if they’re micro-
changes, in how they use it, because they’re trying to show you something, 
instead of doing what they normally do in order for you to observe. 
There’s an element to Sales Safari where there’s a very intentional distance 
and a lack of participation. People need to not know that you’re there watch-
ing. That sounds really creepy to say it that way, but there's a reason for it. 
This is professional lurking if you want to look at it that way. You’re there to 
watch what they do and say when they don’t know that you’re there. 
Amy: It’s not that they’re doing it in private. It’s a public forum and mailing 
list and such, but they aren’t performing for you.
Why is asking people what they want so unreliable?
Amy: People don’t understand what they do all day. They don’t pay atten-
tion to what they do all day. As a designer, I can tell you. It’s just absolutely 
fact, because if I explain all these problems with enough software people, 
like, “Oh, but it’s not so bad! Oh, that’s just email or whatever.” 
I’m like, “Well, what about if it looked like this?” They’re like, “Oh, I never 
thought of that. I never thought that maybe I should have a people view that 
will show the files Bob sent me, so I don’t have to search for ‘Bob.’ And then 
click every email with that.”
Alex: To Amy’s point, there’s a numbness to some pains. But the other side 
of it is, it’s that people really ultimately train themselves to not think about 
it or to think about it in a certain and specific way. Or they’ve heard a certain 
thing that they think they’re supposed to say.
Again, it’s not an intentional act of deception. That’s extremely rare. It’s 
more that you’re relying on them to be reliable. That’s statistically—that’s 
not going to be the case.
They’re not aware. If they were so aware of their problem, there’s a good 
chance the problem would be solved by now.

Amy: That’s why every programmer makes their own tools, and they’re all 
terrible. I’m a programmer. You all know what I’m talking about.
The other thing. If there’s research that shows this, experts don’t under-
stand how they do what they do. They can’t verbalize it.
When you start observing it, they start trying to explain it while they do it. 
Their performance worsens a lot. 
I also remember the example you gave in a talk a while ago of the Walkman 
focus group.
Amy: Oh, yeah.
Where they said, “We want yellow.” And then they all picked up black.
Amy: Yeah. All the kids were asked by Sony, “Which one is cooler? Which 
one would you want to buy? The cool, sporty, yellow Walkman—I think 
it was Discman—or the black one?” And then they were like, “Thanks for 
doing our focus group. Here’s two tables’ worth of Walkmen. Pick the one 
you want.” And they almost all picked black.
People’s vision of themselves is different than how they actually are. That’s 
humanity for you.
It’s this idea that people walk around looking for solutions to their problems. 
No. People walk around trying to tune out their problems, because they 
don’t expect that they can solve them. You have to reflect back to them. 
“Hey, this is the problem that you’re having. You know, it’s a big deal, but 
also we can fix it together.”
That’s a good segue. What’s the process that helps you understand what 
would make someone read that email, use this product, read that blog 
post?
Amy: The key is you start by observing what they actually already do. You 
don’t try to persuade a vegetarian to buy Omaha Steaks. You look at what 
they actually do in real life on the Internet. What they read. What they share 
with each other. The problems they discuss. What things that they ask help 
for. How they help others. 
And then you get in there with something that already fits their behavior 
and their worldview. If people don’t watch videos or they exclusively watch 
videos or you find they pay more for videos, then you’ll want to consider 
giving them videos.
The process is essentially, figure out what hurts them. Reflect that back 
to them in a very empathetic, understanding way. And then offer them 
assistance.
www.it-ebooks.info

Alex: In order for someone to go on the Internet and ask a question of a 
group of strangers about how to solve their problem is a very strong indi-
cator of the level of pain they’re in. Even if it seems like very little pain to 
you. Like, “Oh, that’s so simple. Here’s how to fix it.” It’s awesome that you 
think that, but that’s clearly not where they’re coming from. Otherwise, they 
would have fixed it by now.
So keep that in mind, that in order for people to post a problem they’re hav-
ing for help to an Internet of strangers, that’s a clue right there.
What made you build Sales Safari on the pains and not the joys that peo-
ple mention?
Amy: Because joy is much more personal, and also a lot of cultural groups— 
and I don’t mean like ethnic or country cultures, but industry cultures—don’t 
talk about what’s awesome. Or, if they do, it’s sort of disingenuous, how 
everything’s awesome.
30×500 focuses on providing business value. And business value always 
comes from something that is a waste to start with or a lack.
The thing is, if you just say, “I’m going to create joy,” you’d be like, “Here’s a 
cup of ice cream!” Doesn’t actually tell you where to go. People like kitties. 
They like ice cream. They like jazz music, but those are harder things to sell 
unless they’re in the need for them.
Whereas if you say, “You struggle with this problem every day. Imagine if it 
was actually a positive interaction instead?” Then you actually get people 
listening. If you can’t stimulate demand for it easily, but if you work with 
something that they’re suffering with, then you have a conversation opener.
Stimulating demand is difficult.

We also know that the team that created the first iPhone prototypes 
was “shockingly small.”‡ Even Jony Ive’s design studio at Apple—the 
group responsible for the industrial design of every product, as well as 
projects like iOS 7—is only 19 people.§ And we can surmise that this 
group is broken up into smaller teams to work on their own individual 
projects. 
Figuring out what product you’re going to build is an exercise in work­
ing through the research you’ve gathered, empathizing with your 
audience, and deciding on what you can uniquely create that’ll solve 
the problems you’ve found. But it’s also an exercise in deciding how 
big the team is and who’s on it.
Jeff Bezos of Amazon famously coined a term for teams of this size: 
the “two-pizza team.”¶ In other words, if the number of people on a 
team can’t be fed by two pizzas, then it’s too big. Initially conceived to 
create “a decentralized, even disorganized company where indepen­
dent ideas would prevail over groupthink,” there’s some surprising 
science that explains why teams of this size are less prone to be over­
confident, communicate poorly, and take longer to get stuff done. In 
actuality, that probably caps this team at or around six people. 
Enter the work of the late Richard Hackman, a professor at Harvard 
University who studied organizational psychology. He discovered that 
“The larger a group, the more process problems members encoun­
ter in carrying out their collective work…worse, the vulnerability of a 
group to such difficulties increases sharply as size increases.”**
Hackman defined “process problems” as the links—or, communi­
cation avenues—among the members in a team. As the number of 
members grows, the number of links grows exponentially. Using the 
formula n*(n–1)/2—where n is group size— Hackman found that the 
links among a group get hefty very quickly (Figure 3-1).

Even though math wasn’t my favorite subject in school, let’s go through 
a few team size scenarios. Let’s start with Bezos’s recommended team 
size of six—assuming that two pizzas are appropriate for six people 
(although, I’ve been known to put away a whole pizza on my own from 
time to time):
•	 Bezos’s preferred team size of 6 people has only 15 links to 
manage.
•	 Increase that number to 10, and you already have 45 links to 
manage.
•	 If you expand to the size of where I work every day, Tinder—70 
people—the number of links grows to 2,415.
But managing more communication links isn’t the only problem 
groups face when they increase in size. 
Larger teams get overconfident. They believe they can get things done 
quicker, and have a tendency “to increasingly underestimate task 
completion time as team size grows.” In 2010, organizational behav­
ior researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and UCLA conducted a number of field 
studies confirming these findings.†† In one of their experiments, they 
observed teams tasked with building LEGO kits. Teams with two peo­
ple took 36 minutes to complete the kit, while four-person teams took 
over 44 percent longer.
But the four-person teams believed that they could complete the LEGO 
set faster than the two-person team.

That’s why the notion of the two-pizza team is so powerful. It’s a sim­

zation, and can be used to combat the “let’s throw more bodies at the 
problem” mentality that some organizations might be used to using. 
OK, so we’ve figured out how big your team should be. But who should 
be invited to the party? 
Everybody loves to be in product meetings. Especially when you’re in 
the deciding phase of deciding what to build. 
Even Steve Jobs loved being in the room during this phase. “He told 
me once,” said Glenn Reid, former director of engineering for con­
sumer applications at Apple, “that part of the reason he wanted to be 
CEO was so that nobody could tell him that he wasn’t allowed to par­
ticipate in the nitty-gritty of product design.”*
Treat this process like you’re the bouncer at Berghain nightclub in 
Berlin.† (Hint: it’s practically impossible to get in if you don’t speak 
German. And even then, Sven the bouncer, “a post-apocalyptic bearded 
version of Wagner,” enforces an obscure dress code that nobody can 
seem to crack.)
So, who’s in the room together? How much do they know about the 
pains you’ve found? And how do you frame the discussion?
At this point, you should have everyone who’s going to be involved 
in the creation of the product on the team. An example of this could 
include:
•	 The product designer or product manager (depending on how 
your organization is set up, and if you’ll be working with someone 
else who will be designing the product).
•	 The engineer(s) with whom you’ll be working to build the product—
typically frontend and backend.
•	 A representative from the team that will be launching and pro­
moting the product; this could be someone from marketing or 
public relations to create a feedback loop between what will be 
promised to your customers and what your product is actually 
capable of doing.

While at KISSMetrics, Hiten Shah structured these teams with 
...a product manager, a designer, and an engineer. Sometimes 
it’s multiple designers, multiple engineers, and sometimes it’s an 
engineering manager.
At times it can even be, sometimes, someone from marketing, if 
that makes sense, or even someone from sales. I mean, we have 
tried different methods. I’d say for different things, small things, 
big product releases, a whole product, it’s going to be different and 
for the stage of the company it’s going to be different.
Party Like It’s 1991
Regis McKenna had something to say about this process. When he saw 
how fast technology was changing society in 1991, he realized—like 
our friend Neil McElroy at Proctor & Gamble—that a new role would 
need to be formalized. This person would be “an integrator, both inter­
nally—synthesizing technological capability with market needs—and 
externally—bringing the customer into the company as a participant 
in the development and adaptation of goods and services.”‡ 
If your eyes glazed over reading that, well, you should read it again. 
Because McKenna was responsible for launching some of the hall­
marks of the computer age: the first microprocessor at Intel, Apple’s 
first PC, and The Byte Shop, the world’s first retail computer store. Oh, 
and one more thing: he was the guy behind the “startup in a garage” 
legend first made famous with Apple’s early days. 
So, did you read it again? Did anything seem familiar?
Hey, he’s describing you! 
You’re the product designer. The integrator. You’re the customer’s 
champion, their expert, their advocate. 
This process requires you to lead your team through the research; to 
propose product ideas to eliminate your customer’s pain or find their 
joy effectively. 
That, of course, means that everybody involved in building the product 
must be intimately familiar with the research that’s been conducted 
on your audience.

Take the opportunity as an “integrator” to build on your strengths as 
a team: what innovative technologies and design can you apply to the 
problem at hand? Even better, what can you and your team uniquely 
build for this audience? 
I thought Josh Elman (Greylock Partners, Zazzle, LinkedIn, Facebook, 
Twitter) had a great insight on this part of the product creation process:
The first thing is you have to trust your team. I think that sounds 
obvious, but it’s much harder in practice. I think a lot of structures 
and processes are built on the fact that there isn’t innate trust…
next, get your team’s help in how to solve the problem. The team 
knows what they can build. The team knows how it can be devel­
oped. The designers know what kinds of things are designable and 
natural in the product and what kinds of things are not. All of this 
matters.
Don’t forget the Pain Matrix (Figure 3-2). What are the observations 
you made that fit into the upper-right quadrant where there is the most 
acute, frequent pain? How can you build your customers’ dream prod­
uct? What are the pains that you’re uniquely capable of solving? 
FIGURE 3-2

simple tool I created for 
myself. It’s intended to

the research you’ve 
gathered much simpler.

The Pain Matrix is the perfect piece of collateral for when you’re hash­
ing out what to build. This document becomes a communication 
device, an advocate for your customers. Everybody can see it and you 
can back it up with your data. Bonus points for direct quotes from your 
research.
“The thing to focus on is that yes, 100 percent of your users are 
humans,” Diogenes Brito, a product designer most recently at startup 
Slack, reminds us. “While technology is changing really, really rapidly, 
human motivations basically haven’t at all. Like Maslow’s hierarchy of 
needs, that’s still the same. Designing around that, the closer you are 
to the base level of what humans desire, the more timeless it’ll be.”
To reiterate: don’t lose sight of the actual, observed, tangible pains and 
joys that you’ve researched. Resist the temptation to delve into hopes 
and dreams. Just throwing an “MVP” out into the wild to “validate” 
something you spend time building is a waste of time, money, and 
talent. 
You’re better than that. 
Now, all you have to do is keep everybody focused.
Keeping Everybody Focused
There’s always a big problem when the club-like euphoria from a prod­
uct meeting starts to turn focus into chaos. How do you keep every­
body on task and debating healthily? 
I highly recommend a whiteboard for idea collection and harvesting. 
This serves three practical purposes:
•	 It’s difficult to remember what was said. You don’t want good ideas 
getting lost simply because there were too many thrown around 
the room.
•	 It allows you to be visual. Not all ideas can be verbally explained; 
a low-fidelity medium allows anybody to sketch the central core of 
the idea without unnecessary detail. This allows your team to get 
ideas out of their head on an equal playing field.
•	 It lets you take advantage of the natural tendency for the group to 
forget which idea was contributed by whom. This naturally allows 
the best ideas to float to the top and the worst ones to sink to the 
bottom. It’s hugely beneficial, especially if the group has a lot of 
www.it-ebooks.info

62  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
ideas. The key here is to avoid attaching names to ideas, so you 
can avoid hurt egos and the so-called not invented here syndrome. 
Called the Cauldron, this was a technique used by Apple—some­
times even with Steve Jobs in the room. According to Glenn Reid, 
the former director of engineering at Apple, the Cauldron “let us 
make a great soup, a great potion, without worrying about who had 
what idea. This was critically important, in retrospect, to decouple 
the CEO from the ideas. If an idea was good, we’d all eventually 
agree on it, and if it was bad, it just kind of sank to the bottom of 
the pot. We didn’t really remember whose ideas were which—it 
just didn’t matter.”*
There’s also the benefit of timed techniques, like one used at online 
publishing startup Medium. With the right group of people in the 
room, the problem that needs to be solved is defined and “you have two 
minutes to write down as many ideas as possible [to solve it],” director 
of product design and operations Jason Stirman told me. “Then you 
have five minutes to put the ideas on a whiteboard and explain them. 
Then you have another two minutes to add to ideas…the end result 
is you just get as many ideas as possible. So we do that a lot here. We 
brainstorm a lot.”
The “Working Backwards” Approach
There’s another technique used by Amazon that’s particularly pow­
erful. Known as the “Working Backwards” approach, this technique 
calls upon the product owner to literally write a future press release for 
the product—as well as fake customer quotes, frequently asked ques­
tions, and a story that describes the customer’s experience using the 
product. 
In your case, this could be a future blog post that you’d put out about 
your product or feature instead of a press release. 
What’s particularly unique about this technique is that this document 
involves every part of your organization that’s required to make the 
product successful—not just product and engineering, but marketing, 
sales, support, and every other part of your company. In other words, 
it forces you to think about all of the aspects that can inform your 
product.

Werner Vogels, Amazon’s CTO, describes the rationale behind the 
process:
The product definition process works backwards in the following 
way: we start by writing the documents we’ll need at launch (the 
press release and the FAQ) and then work towards documents 
that are closer to the implementation.
The Working Backwards product definition process is all about 
fleshing out the concept and achieving clarity of thought about 
what we will ultimately go off and build.†
According to Vogels, there are four documents included in Working 
Backwards:
The press release
What the product does, and why it exists
The “frequently asked questions” document
Questions someone might have after reading the press release
A definition of the customer experience
A story of what the customer sees and feels when they use the 
product, as well as relevant mockups to aid the narrative
The user manual
What the customer would reference if they needed to learn how to 
use the product
This all might seem like a lot of frivolous upfront work, but the meth­
od’s been used at Amazon for over a decade. And if you use it in con­
junction with the Sales Safari method outlined in Chapter 2, you’d 
be hard-pressed to find a more customer-centric approach to building 
products. That way, you’ll be working on ideas that have their founda­
tion in what real people need, as opposed to coming up with ideas that 
you try to plug into an amorphous audience.
At the center of Working Backwards lies the press release. A document 
that should be no longer than a page and a half, it’s the guiding light 
and the touchstone of the product and something that can be referred 
to over the course of development.

“My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the 
product is probably going to suck,” writes Ian McAllister, a director 
at Amazon. “Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph 
flows.”*
Amazon’s view is that a press release can be iterated upon at a much 
lower cost than the actual product. That’s because the document 
shines a harsh light on your answer to your customer’s pain. Solutions 
that aren’t compelling or are too lukewarm are easily identified. Nuke 
them and start over. All you’re working with at the moment is words. 
“If the benefits listed don’t sound very interesting or exciting to cus­
tomers, then perhaps they’re not (and shouldn’t be built),” McAllister 
writes. “Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the 
press release until they’ve come up with benefits that actually sound 
like benefits.”
So what does this press release look like? Thanks to McAllister, we 
have a very specific outline of the documents Amazon uses in their 
product meetings:
1.	 Heading: this is where you announce the name of the product. 
Will your target audience understand its meaning? Will they be 
compelled to learn more? 
2.	 Subheading: declare in one sentence who your product’s target 
market is, and how they’ll benefit from it. 
3.	Summary: summarize the product and and its benefits. McAllister 
cautions that there’s a large chance that your reader will only make 
it this far, so “make this paragraph good.”
4.	 Problem: this should be easy since it’s been the focus of your cus­
tomer research. What’s the problem your product solves? What 
are the pains your customers are experiencing that justify this 
product’s existence? 
5.	Solution: how does your product annihilate your customer’s pain 
in the most frictionless way possible? 
6.	 Quote from a Spokesperson in the Company

product-management
www.it-ebooks.info

 What Are We Building Here?   |  65
7.	How to Get Started: how does a customer take their first step into 
the larger world that’s your product? Describe your ideal first step 
that provides an immediate benefit. 
8.	 Customer Quote: what would your ideal customer say after they’d 
had their pains destroyed by your product? 
9.	 Closing, with a Call to Action
I think that this process—however laborious—endures at Amazon 
because it provides such clarity about what the product is going to be, 
and how it’s going to help your customers.
“Once we have gone through the process of creating the press release, 
FAQ, mockups, and user manuals, it is amazing how much clearer it 
is what you are planning to build,” writes Vogels. “We’ll have a suite 
of documents that we can use to explain the new product to other 
teams within Amazon. We know at that point that the whole team has 
a shared vision on what product we are going to build.”
Create a Product Guide
Before you finish defining what product it is you’ll be building, you’re 
going to want to leave with some paper in hand.
I love Cap Watkins’s approach. The vice president of design at Buzzfeed 
and former Etsy senior design manager keeps his team on task after 
the meeting by creating a key internal document. We’ll call this a 
product guide for the sake of discussion:†
At the end [of the product definition meeting], leave with: 
What you’re doing.
Why you’re doing it (problems you’re trying to solve).
What success looks like (quantitatively and qualitatively).
The product guide helps you “keep yourself and your team focused 
and prevent design creep: if it doesn’t solve the problem or meet the 
goals, it doesn’t go into this version.” 
The only two elements missing from this approach are who’s responsi­
ble for what pieces of the product, and when they’ll be done.

Pre-dating Steve Jobs, Apple created a rule for every project they 
undertake: the “Directly Responsible Individual,” or DRI. It’s a simple 
yet effective rule. By placing one’s name next to a task-to-be-completed 
in front of the entire company, you can be sure that individual feels 
more responsibility to perform.*
In your own internal product guide, use this rule and make sure that 
every line item has a DRI. Assign someone (or recruit volunteers) to 
complete each task. Make sure this is in place before you break up the 
meeting. Include it in your guide’s circulation. 
It’s not enough to put people’s names next to line items. You and your 
team need dates, too. Do you need to do research for technological or 
data considerations? Do you need to build a prototype to see if a partic­
ular interface component is possible? Did you misinterpret something 
in your audience analysis? What can be executed upon immediately to 
challenge any outlying assumptions? Who needs to see what and when 
(other product teams, clients, bosses)? At what fidelity?
By giving every task a deadline, you’ll maintain momentum even 
when the initial enthusiasm of creating something new dies down.
But how should you build in accountability? How do you race against 
the clock to get something valuable out to your customers?
Customer retention company Intercom—whose clients include 
Shopify, InVision, and Rackspace—gives their product teams weekly 
goals to hit. “We believe you can achieve greatness in 1,000 small 
steps. Therefore we always optimise for shipping the fastest, small­
est, simplest thing that will get us closer to our objective and help us 
learn what works. All our projects are scoped into small independent 
releases that add value to customers.”† 
At AngelList, Graham Jenkin places a similar pressure on himself and 
his team to execute on a new product as quickly as possible—with a 
bias toward small chunks. “We’re always thinking about how are we 
going to execute this by the end of the day, or ‘how are we going to get 
this done this week? Can we get it done this week?’ If we can’t, maybe 
it’s the wrong problem to try to solve.” His approach is more of a roll­
ing set of needs, rather than standing, arbitrary deadlines.

And my current employer, Tinder, holds product update meetings 
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday—but only if there’s something 
to discuss. These meetings typically consist of the product team gath­
ering feedback from each other on their own projects and asking for 
critiques or help solving any design challenges. Every Monday is a 
roadmap meeting where engineering, product, customer support, and 
marketing leads get into a room and update each other on the progress 
of their projects, while alerting the group if something new needs to 
be addressed. 
Whatever the setup is at your company, remember that you’re the inte­
grator. So be the leader. Be the customer’s advocate. Don’t settle for 
hand-waving and bravado.
You’re better than that. More talented. And probably better looking.
Shareable Notes
•	 Defining what to build starts first with who’s in the room. 
•	 When choosing who’s in the room, follow Jeff Bezos’s “two-pizza 
team” rule: your team should be small enough that two pizzas 
could feed them. Typically, this comes out to about six people.
•	 Only allow team members through the door if they’re educated 
on the research you’ve conducted on your audience. Use the Pain 
Matrix liberally.
•	 Whiteboards are your friend. They help you remember what was 
said, allow you to be visual (sketching together brings teams 
together), and disassociate ideas from their inventors. This allows 
the best ideas to win without any regard for who invented them.
•	 Amazon’s “Working Backwards” approach can help you pinpoint 
the product ideas that’ll solve your customer’s pains, versus creat­
ing something that’s too flashy or uninspired.
•	 Leave this meeting with a key document: the product guide, which 
outlines what you’re building and who’s responsible for doing it.

Do This Now
•	 Re-examine the knowledge your team has of your audience. 
Encourage them to study up on the research you’ve done so they 
can make more informed product decisions.
•	 Think about how your product can really make your customers 
happy. Are you really bringing them joy? Are you truly able to alle­
viate their pains and satiate their needs? 
•	 Take stock of how your team conducts meetings and makes deci­
sions. See if any of the techniques mentioned in this chapter can 
help you make more realistic decisions in a smaller time period.

Interview: Sahil Lavingia
Sahil Lavingia was on the original Pinterest team, where he helped invent the 
famous pinboard design, as well as the Pin It button and the Pinmarklet—
before even finishing college at the University of Southern California. He then 
left Pinterest to design Turntable.fm’s first iOS app, and started Gumroad 
shortly thereafter. At Gumroad, as founder and CEO, he’s making it easy for 
artists to sell any good—digital or physical —to customers around the world.
So I noticed this distinct thread that runs through your thinking of every-
thing you work on. You want to create something that solves a problem 
simply that gets in the hands of other people. What kind of philosophical 
steps along the road did you take to have this epiphany?
Yeah, I think the first thing that I figured out pretty quickly was that it’s 
really hard to predict what people want, like it’s hard to sort of guess in a 
year how your product is going to look.
And two, it’s just you’re forced to make simple stuff because you’re not 
going to work on it for more than a weekend, right? And like now I think it’s 
sort of obvious like, yeah, release something MVP, iterate, etc. But I think 
I was just like, “I want to build 50 things over the next year,” and the only 
way to do that was to release MVPs. So that sort of built itself into the cycle.
How did you get started on this journey?
I was at [the University of Southern California] in the fall of 2010 with the 
intention of getting a degree; I was not really even considering leaving. But 
I started publishing a lot of my work online and I was like, “Wait, I’m finally 
in the U.S., I’m finally in California, I should start trying to get in touch with 
a lot of these people that I had followed for a long time.” And that got 
me into doing contract work with these startups, that got me full-time job 
offers, and I sort of realized I could do this full-time; I didn’t need a degree 
to do what I wanted to do. That led to me leaving USC after a semester, four 
months.
So I joined Pinterest, I was 18 at the time. I started contracting while I was 
doing school so I wanted to at least finish up the semester and end it cleanly.
Then I was there for a year, working on all sorts of stuff—design, frontend, 
backend. The mobile app was sort of my primary baby, but I worked on sort 
of everything. I joined the same day as another guy so I was number two 
and a half, three, or whatever, or we were both two. 
www.it-ebooks.info

And I was the most design-y frontend person at the time, so it was like, “You 
have to do that.” So I learned a lot through that, then I left; I did some con-
tract work for this startup called Turntable.fm based out in New York. I built 
their mobile app, designed it, and then I started to go on my own and that 
was already two years of stuff that happened really quickly. But [during the 
course of those two years] I think the things that got me excited—there are 
two big things—one was this constant emphasis on value creation.
I think Ben [Silbermann, cofounder and CEO of Pinterest] is really good 
about talking about it, especially now. But we were never really a super well-
known Valley-like startup; no one really knew what we were. TechCrunch 
didn’t really give a shit what Pinterest was for a long time. But we had these 
really core engaged users, even though we didn’t have a lot of them—the 
people that used us were really psyched about us. 
And so there was always this focus on building stuff that will make these 
people’s lives better, which I think is the ultimate goal anyways—but you 
forget when there’s all these other things that are going on, like raising 
money and trying to recruit people and pitching a different story there and 
press and things like that. 
The other thing that I think really helped was just the volume of sort of feed-
back that I got. Like I had built these [different products] and sure, I had 
maybe a few hundred thousand users, maybe 1,000,000 combined over all 
the things I had built myself.
But with Pinterest I could launch something, I could try out a new thing, I 
would be able to get this massive amount of feedback. And we never ran 
A/B tests or anything at Pinterest, at least not when I was there. But with 
most of the things we worked on, it was very easy to figure out very quickly 
what was working, what wasn’t working—and typically they’re the same 
things. Simpler is better. Making things intuitive rather than complicated. 
Things like that. They’re obvious to say out loud, but they definitely influ-
enced a lot of the design that we did at Pinterest and a lot of the interac-
tions that we built that really I don’t think were very common before them 
and now are a lot more common. So I do think there was some amount 
of nonobvious stuff that we built to solve the needs of our users and that 
expanded from there.

Tell me about how you used the invitation-only system in the early days 
to spur growth.
Typically if you talk to someone in tech [about this technique], they’re like, 
“this is stupid.” First of all, no one actually thinks that this is a secret and 
closed beta. You get 1,000,000 emails a day, right? So another one just 
actually hurts you—but if you look at the normal person, even today, at least 
the normal people, the first people that used Pinterest and probably still 
sign up today, they didn’t get a lot of email. Now, if you look at their inboxes, 
it’s typically Facebook and Pinterest.
So, in that case, it’s actually great that we said they loved the emails. They 
love getting invites to secret stuff, they’re like, “Holy shit, I have this amaz-
ing secret new service and I can only tell five friends about it. So I’m going to 
take the time to really invite the best people I can invite because I only have 
five of them.” They don’t know that they don’t expire, that there’s actually 
an infinite amount of them or whatever. Yeah, those things still work.
That seems to have been one of the strengths of Pinterest’s early growth—
that Silicon Valley discounted you.
Yeah, it’s pretty funny. I remember this one specific moment where I think 
Ben [Silbermann] said, “I was just in the meeting with somebody and they’re 
like, ‘You guys are building a site for women, right? Are you guys scared that 
your site is only going to be used by women?,’” or whatever. And, he jok-
ingly replied, “Yeah, I’m really scared that we’re only building a thing for 50 
percent of the world’s population.” 
And it’s true. More women use Facebook than men I think by far—I think the 
engagement on females is typically a lot higher. And Instagram I’m sure is 
majority women, I think; Snapchat is probably the same. But yeah, things 
like that were unsexy in the Valley and I think a lot of people probably didn’t 
focus on problems like the ones we were focused on. Because it was unsexy 
or uncool or not the hot hip thing to do.
But that’s kind of a common thread between what you get at Pinterest 
and what you’re doing now: you’re going after people that are hard to 
get to, they’re under-served, and if you give them some tools they’ll run 
with it.
Yeah, and I like how you said “tools.” [At Pinterest] we always thought about 
that piece of it too—we were always like, “How do we build tools to help our 
users solve their problems?” I think a lot of people focus on the network. 
They focus on the big picture—but you only get to the big picture if individ-
ually everyone is gaining value out of your service.

Most of the people—our competitors, you could argue—like for me at least, 
that’s how I always considered it, is we stole users away from the Internet 
Explorer bookmarks folder. That was our competitor—we stopped more 
people from using that than any other service ever. And when you think of 
it like that you’re like, “We need to build a better feature set that lets peo-
ple bookmark stuff, scrapbook stuff, collect things, the sharing and other 
things like that.
They just want to find a better way to organize the 5,000 different things 
they might want to buy for their new house. And it doesn’t matter how 
many recommendations or how many freaking gamification badges, leader 
boards, whatever you work on to provide, it’s really just like, “I just need a 
better way to bookmark stuff.”

But in a dingy office in Cupertino, you’d have seen the implementation 
of the first commercial graphical user interface. The invention of the 
one-button mouse. The creation of some of the most essential, founda­
tional apps in computing.
But, even more powerfully, you’d have been exposed to the idea that 
the computer could be something used by regular people—not just 
scientists, businesspeople, or engineers. The dream was that the com­
puter could be like any other household appliance, winning space in 
the living room next to the television or the solar-powered calculator. 
This was a huge step in thinking at the time. Computers are business 
machines, went the conventional thinking.

Not only was a man named Jef Raskin there to witness this spectacle, 
but he helped to make this dream into a tangible reality. Raskin was 
the one who started the Macintosh project at Apple. Seeing that the 
Apple II was still too complex for everyday use, he believed that the 
computer could be as easy to use as a regular home appliance.
So Raskin decided to define the guiding principles of what a so-called 
“easy-to-use” computer should be. And in his book The Humane 
Interface, published about two decades after he left the Mac project, 
he revisited and refined his ideas about human-computer interfaces.
Raskin believed that the success of a product’s interface was depen­
dent upon how well the designer understood two parties: the human 
using it, and the capabilities of the machine on which the software 
ran. 
One of his core beliefs was that a designer should start designing the 
UI with…copy. 
The place to start the implementation is to list exactly what the 
user will do to achieve his or her goals and how the system will 
respond to each user action.*
This is where the foundation of your product’s user interface is laid. 
And you’ve earned the right to be here because you’ve already defined 
the tasks that the product needs to accomplish—because you know 
your audience, you’ve done the research (you did use the Pain Matrix, 
right? :) ), and you know what your team is capable of delivering.
So go into this stage with the confidence that what you’re creating has 
a soul and a direction. Will the product change as you’re developing 
it? Perhaps, as you learn more about your customer and determine 
what you’re capable of building. But that’s part of the process of being 
flexible. 
The foundation you lay here will help you understand exactly how 
your product can annihilate your customers’ pain. You’ll understand 
exactly the steps required to make your product tangible.
And don’t forget—doing this will save you time. How long does it take 
you to type words into a text editor? How long does it take you to draw 
squares and arrows with words in it?

Not long. So it’s easy to shuffle the cards, so to speak, if what you came 
up with feels wrong, or bloated, or impossible to pull off. 
The other added benefit of writing your interface first is that you’re not 
worried about which font you should use, the border radius on your 
dialogs, or the interaction convention of the week. You’re focused on 
your customers’ productivity.
But a lot of us get this backward. We get sucked into the dopamine 
rush of inventing novel interactions and layouts, worried too much 
about impressing our peers in the product design community.
Words are the building blocks of practically all user interfaces. That’s 
because interfaces are really just a set of tasks driven by words and 
symbols—and by focusing on good copywriting, you’ll vastly improve 
your product and its design. Words are the nucleus of the interface, the 
design built out of them.
I love how Jason Zimdars, a designer at project management company 
Basecamp, puts this (Figure 4-1):†
My favorite sketching tool: iA Writer [a minimalist text editor]. 
I’m not joking. UI design starts with words. Writing first makes 
me treat UI as a conversation. How would I tell a friend what 
they can do here and now? 
Words get you, in old-school engineering parlance, “close to the 
metal”—closer to the who and why of your product, versus jumping 
into the how and what. It’s beginning your user interface as a dialogue

with your future customers, versus trying to invent UI components 
right out of the gate. Because, as Raskin writes, “Users do not care 
what is inside the box, as long as the box does what they need done.”
So how does one go about writing out a user interface? There are three 
key steps:
1.	 Map out the sequences of interactions—otherwise known as 
flows—that your audience will use to complete every task in your 
product.
2.	 For each screen in these flows, list out the components that are 
required to make each step in the flow do what it’s supposed to do. 
Forms? Buttons? Pieces of data? List everything out.
3.	Write the actual copy. What’s the headline going to say? What’s the 
context? In what tone should you write it, and should you reflect a 
certain personality? Don’t settle for Lorem Ipsum here. 
In the end, there’s no one perfect way to do this. The goal is, as a 
famous stormtrooper once said, to “move along now,” and get some­
thing working as quickly as possible without having to juggle all of the 
product’s variables in your head. Clarity around what you’re building 
and opening a line of communication with the people who are build­
ing it is the primary goal of the copywriting process. Systemic design 
problems can be thought out and designed on paper or in text first—
before even a single pixel is created, or a line of code typed. 
With that in mind, let’s talk about mapping your product’s user flows.
Creating User Flows
Science fiction, fantasy, and thriller writers who have to handle a 
bunch of plot lines need a way to keep track of what’s going on. Writing 
a book—especially a series of books—with separate and intertwining 
plot lines demands an overarching method of organization. Can you 
imagine what George R.R. Martin, J.R.R. Tolkien, or J.K. Rowling had 
to do to keep track of all their characters and subplots? 
Well, you’re in luck, because you can jump inside the head of Rowling 
while she wrote The Order of the Phoenix. A sample page of her hand­
written plot spreadsheet surfaced online in 2010. The columns divid­
ing the spreadsheet consist of chapter numbers, story timeline, main 
plot points, subplots, and chapter titles (Figure 4-2).*

FIGURE 4-2
Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling used handwritten matrixes to map out the 
plots of her novels, like this one for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
If you’re familiar with the Potterverse and have read the books, you’ll 
notice some events that took place that were never explicitly mentioned 
in the novel—namely, the subplots near the right of the page. Rowling 
made sure to note that these events were happening in the context of 
the universe she created so she could keep track of what was going on, 
even if she never explicitly exposed them.
There are also many elements present here that were changed in the 
final novel. Note, for example, that “Elvira Umbridge” is mentioned 
instead of Dolores, and that Dumbledore’s Army and the Order of the 
Phoenix swap names later. 
Even if you haven’t read the Harry Potter series (hold on—you hav­
en’t read that and you’re reading this? I recommend fixing this prob­
lem as soon as possible), the lesson here is clear: Rowling didn’t just 
dive into writing her book. She didn’t create a successful story without 
www.it-ebooks.info

78  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
forethought. She meticulously planned it in a way that forgave mis­
takes and bad ideas, and without much overhead. At worst, Rowling 
would have to crumple up a piece of paper and throw it away if the plot 
didn’t make sense. You can even see how she crossed out mistakes and 
bad ideas in the spreadsheet—imagine the cost of having written an 
entire scene instead? 
Creating a user interface for your product really isn’t much different. 
By mapping out the flows of your interface first, you’re outlining the 
story, your characters, and your subplots. 
And flows are important, because your customers aren’t going to 
accomplish the task you’ve laid out before them in just one screen. 
From signing up, to taking a photo, to even confirming something 
with a simple “OK,” everything in your product is going to be judged 
by how well the flow of screens…well, flows.
Creating user flows that are both smooth and logical is an essential 
hallmark of a great product. It is rare that a feature exists within a sin­
gle screen. In many cases, mapping out your product’s flows will help 
you determine the type of interaction best for each step. For example:
•	 Does this step need to be a single screen, or could it just be a 
pop-up window? 
•	 Do you need another form on this step, or could you just reuse 
existing data from a previous screen?
•	 Will you need a double confirmation because you’re dealing with 
a potentially destructive action?
More generally, flows are so essential at this stage of product design 
because all of the following details are getting out in the open:
•	 Where are people starting in your design: from within your prod­
uct? Or are they coming to a page from outside of it? 
•	 What are the assumptions your customers have at this point: are 
the customers new? Exploratory? Cautious? Or are they experi­
enced and trying to get a task done as quickly possible?
•	 What are the possible decisions your customers can make on each 
screen—and where does each decision take them? 
www.it-ebooks.info

 User Interfaces Begin with Words   |  79
•	 What pieces of data do you need to have available?
•	 On the flip side, what pieces of data do you need your customers 
to input?
•	 What happens if something goes wrong—or right? What do you 
display? Where do you direct customers? 
Doing this early legwork relieves you of the burden of keeping these 
details in your head. It’s also an iterative process with your team: by 
keeping them aware of what you’re thinking, they know how their 
pieces each fit into the overall product and can adjust them as the flows 
change.
That’s why it’s fine to be as verbose as possible. There’s nothing to lose 
at this stage, and it’s best to put all of the variables that you’re deal­
ing with out in the open. Furthermore, there’s a high probability that 
these flows will change as you turn them into interactive prototypes, 
and, eventually, a fully refined experience.
But where to begin? Start by focusing on what makes up the essence 
of the product—the centerpoint of your product’s use case—and then 
work out from there. By mapping out the most essential flows first, 
you can then orient every other flow around them. In other words, the 
secondary functionality of your product should be in service to the pri­
mary flows. This approach has the effect of leading customers back to 
what makes your product unique and the most useful.
As an example, Snapchat famously made the camera the first screen 
a customer sees. So whenever someone opens up Snapchat, the app 
opens the camera first. This places every other action—viewing other 
people’s Snaps, playing with settings, adding friends— as secondary. 
It makes content creation the most encouraged flow. It also had the 
side effect of creating new customer expectations within the photo 
sharing space (Figure 4-3).

So how do you write out these flows? What’s the most efficient, flexi­
ble way to get this stuff out of your head and into a format that can be 
consumed by your team? 
One of the most unique methods for mapping I’ve ever heard of—and 
one that I’ve actually adopted myself—was created by Jon Troutman, 
cofounder and chief creative officer for home security startup Canary. 
Based in New York City, Canary sells a security device and suite of 
software services that makes it easy to not just see, but understand, 
what’s happening in your home from anywhere. Troutman’s responsi­
ble for the company’s hardware and software design, which includes a 
suite of mobile and web applications.

Troutman eschews anything visual in this phase and instead maps all 
of the flows in the text editor TextEdit. His philosophy is that by pre­
venting any ability to focus on visual or layout details, he’s better able 
to focus on the content and purpose of each screen. And since copy­
writing is a major part of interface design, he’s simultaneously craft­
ing large swaths of the interface. 
I like to start in TextEdit as a content inventory canvas where I 
start to type out things that I know are going to be on the page or 
on the app. I like to organize things in TextEdit just because—it’s 
comfortable now, because I’ve been doing it for a while—but at 
least starting out there were uncomfortable constraints that forced 
me not to get visual, but instead think in terms of content.
It’s also a convenient way to collaborate with the team, and creates a 
quick way to start experiencing the flows you’ve built.
We used [the raw HTML flows] as a way to collaborate with other 
members of the team to make sure, “hey, is this the content that 
we’re going to want on this page?” By getting the right content in 
there, it was then super easy to turn the text into an HTML pro­
totype with no styling. Then we all tested it by clicking through, 
making sure it felt like the right flows and things fit together right 
and the information architecture was right, then increasing fidel­
ity from there.
Troutman found that this was a way to quickly determine if a page or 
section of the user flow was overloaded: 
TextEdit forces you to be linear. Then you start to think about 
importance. What’s going to be further down within the content, 
or what’s going to be higher within the content—whether or not 
you break them into separate pages or different flows, you start 
to prioritize and give the content a hierarchy just based on the 
amount of things before it. Doing this forces you to whittle down 
your content and make things shorter and smaller and more suc­
cinct and you start to rearrange stuff around. It’s actually pretty 
key to my process and I use it all the time.
The goal of mapping your flows is to answer the following questions: 
How does the customer get into a position to complete a task? How do 
they complete these tasks? Where do they go afterward? What are the 
potential hangups? 
www.it-ebooks.info

82  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
And how are these communicated? Sketches? Diagrams? Mind maps? 
Troutman’s method may not be for you. Maybe it’s not visual enough, 
or maybe it’s too minimalist.
Katelyn Friedson, when she was mobile product manager at publicly 
traded Care.com, used flowcharts to communicate the general flows 
of a new product with her designers and engineering counterparts 
(Figure 4-4). “While it’s important to get something in the hands of 
a developer quickly,” Friedson said, “I think it’s also important to put 
as much thought into the flow or feature or product as possible before 
handing off something that’s half-baked. This is done to avoid waste.”
FIGURE 4-4
Katelyn Friedson worked with designers at Care.com to develop a product 
with this map of flows.
But she doesn’t let the fear of handing off something that may be 
ill-conceived at the moment prevent developers from thinking about 
what’s going to be required for a new feature:
That said, developers are looped into what we’ll be working on 
building for a specific iteration cycle. For example, at Care, we 
were building a peer-to-peer payments flow. We knew which pay­
ment vendor we’d be integrating with, and we knew of 4–6 use 
cases that we were sure we would need to build out. This gave our 
developers time to begin researching, even coding, these flows—
integrating with APIs, testing, etc. It also allows them to prepare 
questions they have in the event they aren’t covered in the product 
specifications.
www.it-ebooks.info

 User Interfaces Begin with Words   |  83
In other words, Friedson uses her user flow maps to enable developers 
to get more specific in their thinking: 
Forget about design and flow, and focus on areas and use cases 
that developers can start tackling right away from a backend per­
spective. These use cases can be easily and very quickly communi­
cated through user flows, which are essentially made up of boxes 
and arrows, showing the various use cases a user would take. For 
example, if a user’s credit card were to fail, what would we present 
to the user?
Just because a designer hasn’t worked through every loading state or 
error screen doesn’t mean that you should keep your cards close to your 
vest. Friedson’s thought-through-but-evolving user flows let the orga­
nization start moving forward even when everything isn’t finalized. 
Diogenes Brito, product designer at LinkedIn, uses this flow-mapping 
phase more as a personal step to organize all of the variables in his 
head:
What ends up mostly in my notebook, which I always have and I 
think is an important part of any designer’s toolset, is more mind­
map kind of stuff. Listing all the requirements, the kind of prob­
lems you should think about and related problems, and things we 
might want to keep in the back of our heads as we’re designing a 
certain thing.
I’m going through all the options and arrangements, and what 
really [ends up] I think in my logbook specifically are questions 
about information architecture. It’s complex categorization. 
What if we think about it this way in these other categories? What 
if we think about it this other way in these other categories?
For my own projects, I personally like to invoke J.K. Rowling’s tech­
nique—by first scrawling text and arrows on a piece of paper. And, 
like Brito, this is an exercise first for myself. It’s a way to organize my 
thoughts and account for all of the variables flying around. Here’s an 
example from a signup flow I had to create for a mobile product on 
which I worked as product designer (Figure 4-5).
www.it-ebooks.info

84  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
 
With these broad user flows, I’m seeking to communicate only the 
broadest strokes of the essential functionality of each screen. Once I 
have the broad flow down, only then will I go and sketch out the spe­
cifics of each screen. You can see this sentiment in the “Walkthrough” 
section of the signup flow—I know that I want to highlight three ben­
efits, but I don’t know what those are yet. There’s no need to represent 
those here in specificity yet. 
Here’s a more complicated flow that includes a series of forks—import­
ing photos into one’s profile from two possible sources. What happens 
if you choose Instagram? Or Facebook? What happens if you’re not 
authorized with Instagram yet, and what happens if authorization 
fails (Figure 4-6)?
FIGURE 4-5
I mapped these user 
flows when working on 
mobile products.
www.it-ebooks.info

 User Interfaces Begin with Words   |  85
What I like about this technique is that it easily highlights where and 
when to reuse flows. For example, if I attempt to authorize Instagram 
and my login fails, we’ll just pop you back to the “Select source” step 
and throw an error message. 
From here, I like to sit down with the lead engineer on the project and 
work through each step together. We’ll literally scratch out, flip, and 
invent new steps in the flow during these sessions based upon what’s 
right for the customer and what’s technically feasible. 
Sometimes, if it’s necessary, we’ll turn these into a higher-fidelity flow­
chart like the one created by Friedson in Figure 4-4. This is usually in 
response to a need to “socialize” the user flows more widely within the 
company. 
So, these are the broad strokes, but what about each screen? 
Let’s look at those next.

Writing Your Screens
Writing out flows is one thing. But writing out the specifics of what’s 
on each screen is where some of the most meaningful user interface 
work happens—because, as Raskin wrote in The Humane Interface, 
“as far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product.”* 
The reason why it’s so useful to map out the key product flows ahead 
of time is because every screen lives in context. Successful screens are 
aware of the screens that came before them and appear after them.
So how do you make sure that you’ve accounted for all of the elements 
required to make a screen successful? 
Well, the first step is to relinquish all fear. Ernest Hemingway—
whether he actually said these words or not—is now universally cred­
ited with saying, “the first draft of anything is shit.”† 
Ryan Scherf, a product designer at Quirky, gets this. “I think sketch­
ing is super important. There’s no such thing as a bad idea. So as 
we’re thinking through these things and throwing ideas out, it’s really 
important to me to have a team that understands that there’s no such 
thing as a bad idea, and someone has to have the first idea, and usually 
the first idea is the worst idea.” 
Think of your screen sketch as a canvas where nothing’s impossible. 
Just as J.K. Rowling used a blank piece of paper to spreadsheet out her 
plot lines (if spreadsheet is even a verb), take this chance to get every 
crazy, dumb, implausible, or ridiculous idea out of your system. 
So list everything that you think needs to be on this specific screen of 
your product. This could possibly include:
•	 User information like name, age, biography, job title, etc.
•	 Common connections like friends, interests, or visited locations to 
which two or more people could share
•	 Photos, videos, and any kind of rich media
•	 Core and secondary actions the user could take

started/get-messy-with-your-first-draft
www.it-ebooks.info

 User Interfaces Begin with Words   |  87
Really, this list includes anything that your product requires to suc­
cessfully fulfill its promise to your audience—namely, a prompt to the 
user about what they should do, the primary action you’d like them 
to take, and any bits of information that you can supply to them that 
makes their decision easier.
I recommend making this list next to a rough sketch of what you’ve 
envisioned the interface to be in your mind’s eye. For example, in 
Figure 4-7, I created a list of potential elements for a hypothetical pro­
file. I listed out all of the possible pieces I could include—with a rough 
sketch of where they might go, so I could visualize these elements as 
I listed them. 
Note that I didn’t list these interface items with any priority in mind—
it was a stream-of-consciousness exercise in what could possibly make 
sense on the screen. 
What’s great about doing this is that you get all the insane, crazy ideas 
out of your system. Once you write it all down, you can take a step back 
and really look at what you’ve written down on paper. 
That’s because you’re dealing with reality. You’ve got a dataset from 
which to load data. You’ve got constraints on the client for which you’re 
designing—desktop, iPhone, Android, Windows Phone—you get the 
gist. What are the essential interface elements that you need to convey 
the purpose of this screen? What’s everything you need for the ideal 
state of this screen?
FIGURE 4-7

requirements for each 
screen alongside a

88  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
We’ll explore the ideal state in Chapter 6, but for the sake of this step, 
you’re creating the ideal version of this screen by hand. And the ideal 
version of the screen starts at its center—what’s its primary purpose? 
What functionality can you exclude that doesn’t fit within the purview 
of the screen’s function?
A great example from Internet history lies in Jack Dorsey’s initial con­
ception of Twitter (Figure 4-8).* In 2006, Dorsey drew the components of 
an interface that you’ll recognize even today. That’s because he was able 
to identify the core components (however straightforward they might 
have been) of an interface that aligned with the product’s use case.

Also, notice how Dorsey’s notes about potential avenues to pursue on 
this screen never endured in the Twitter interface. While we might 
have the benefit of hindsight here, Twitter has maintained the core 
tenets of Dorsey’s original interface sketches even 9+ years later 
(Figure 4-9).
In the end, writing and drawing out your product’s interface before 
you even put pixel to canvas has immense benefits—because you’re 
weeding out the bad ideas before you make big investments. But even 
in these early stages you can flesh out another massively important 
interface element—an interface’s actual copy.

Traits of Good Interface Copy
Here’s the beauty of starting your design with words: it can help you 
set the tone of your product, especially if you’ve researched your audi­
ence as we discussed in the previous chapters. 
These early words are the foundation on which the walls of your inter­
face will be built. So they’d better be good. 
Jon Troutman of Canary eschews any efforts at this phase to insert 
fake text like Lorem Ipsum (or, even my favorite, Riker Ipsum, as tempt­
ing as it may be):* 
I write out what it would actually say. I think it forces you to not 
let yourself put in Lorem Ipsum and just headline goes here 
and things like that. You put all the content in and when you first 
start, you’re not playing with font sizes or anything. It’s all inline.
Here are four broad principles that you can use to make sure your 
copywriting starts off on the right foot. 
Who’s the Audience?
Who’s using your product? How comfortable are they with your prod­
uct on any given screen? Are they just now being introduced to your 
product’s capabilities, or are they veteran customers? Have they paid 
for anything yet, or are they on a free plan? 
Use the jargon you found while researching your customers to ingra­
tiate yourself with them. What words and terminology will be most 
recognizable? 
But don’t mistake your customers’ jargon for your own. Internal 
terms—like project nicknames, error codes, acronyms, inside jokes, 
or placeholder copy—have no place in your product’s interface. Your 
job is to make it make sense for your audience, not for you.
In What Tone Is It Written?
Good interface copywriting isn’t overly technical, vague, or laden with 
branded or internal buzzwords. It’s helpful and forgiving, and it’s 
aware of when it’s delivering good or bad news. 
*	  http://rikeripsum.com
www.it-ebooks.info

 User Interfaces Begin with Words   |  91
Is your product for stockbrokers? Teenage girls? Book authors? Eco-
conscious mothers? The tone of your product’s copywriting should be 
conscious of this. Humor, seriousness, dryness, and other tones each 
have their place.
The ultimate tone to strike, though, communicates your product’s 
capability of fulfilling its promise—that it can be relied upon to do the 
job it said it can do.
What’s the Context?
Is it a landing page? A signup form? Settings? The first time a cus­
tomer sees a screen? Your shipping policy? In response to something 
on which they explicitly took action?
Good interface copywriting takes into account where a customer is 
reading. And it helps them to decide which action they should take 
next, if any. Most of the time an interface is presenting information 
to a person so they can make a decision. Be as clear as possible about 
which decision might be best for your customer in this moment.
Effective interface copywriting also takes into account the limitations 
of the context. For example, if you’re sending information via text mes­
sage, you should be courteous and write your message in less than or 
equal to 160 characters. 
The best way I’ve heard the copywriting process described is to act 
like a newspaper editor. You’re trying to create short, direct, easily 
absorbed copy that succinctly describes every decision in which a cus­
tomer might find themselves. The goal is to make those situations 
effortlessly understandable—so your customer knows what to do next 
without question.
Are You Being Consistent? 
Humans are creatures of habit and your customers will quickly adapt 
to the patterns and cadence of your product. That’s why being consis­
tent within your product with labels and commands is essential. 
Can you “Log In,” then “Sign Out”? Do you advance by tapping 
“Continue” or “Next”? Do confirmations come with “OK,” “Okay,” 
“Submit,” or “Confirm”? Universal commands should be consistent 
across your product.

And, when possible, buttons should reflect the action they’re per­
forming. The best button titles are written with one or two words that 
describe the result of using the button. “Send Message,” “Take Photo,” 
“Leave Comment,” and “Not Now” are all much more descriptive than 
a generic “Submit.”
Be aware of common industry terms and the geographical region in 
which your product is being used. If people know a camera as a “cam­
era,” then call it that. 
Considering regional differences is also an exercise in consistency. 
“Zip code” versus “postal code” is a real thing—so is “state” versus 
“province.” And be aware of how you’re representing dates. Most coun­
tries present the day before the month.
And different cultures have different norms. The United Kingdom, for 
example, might take offense to an excessive use of exclamation points. 
Who knew? It’s your job to know.
In the end, this is the canvas that you can go crazy on at little cost. 
Writing actual, tangible copy turns it back into reality, because the 
next phase increases the fidelity of your product—by turning these 
screens into interactive prototypes that you can socialize among your 
team.
Shareable Notes
•	 Interface design begins with words. Before you invest inordinate 
amounts of time creating the next great user interface, spend your 
time mapping out each user flow in your product. Then, dial down 
into each screen. 
•	 But with each screen, keep it low fidelity. Write out all of your 
hopes and dreams for each screen, even with a rough sketch of 
what you envisioned the interface to be in your mind’s eye. List 
every element that could possibly be on the screen. 
•	 Assess what it’d take to load all of the data for what you listed on 
the screen. Then, eliminate what you don’t need. Remember the 
centerpoint and purpose of each screen—what does your audi­
ence need to understand what’s going on? What elements do they 
need to make the right decision along each step?

•	 Ultimately, you’re creating flows and screens to create the product 
that’ll annihilate your customer’s pain. So start crazy, then reel it 
back in—because, in the next phase, we’ll turn these screens into 
prototypes.
Do This Now
•	 On your next project, challenge yourself to start with the most 
intimidating blank slate of all: the blinking cursor on a white 
background.
•	 Think about the tone your product should strike. Playful? Witty? 
Comforting? How can you use this tone to make your product 
more useful for your customers?
•	 Just say no to Lorem Ipsum (or, even my personal favorite, Riker 
Ipsum)!

Interview: Jon Troutman
Jon Troutman is the cofounder and chief creative officer at Canary, a hard-
ware and software home security monitoring startup. It launched as a crowd-
funding campaign on Indiegogo, becoming the most successfully funded 
project in Indiegogo history and raising almost $2 million. Jon is also the 
cofounder of Designer’s Debate Club and a former product designer at 
coworking company General Assembly.
I like trying to drill down in the tactics you use when you start building 
something. Do you start with sketches? What’s your personal workflow? 
What are the tools you use?
One of my most important tools in my process, I would say, is my collabo-
rators—who I’m working with. I think earlier on in my career was a lot more 
me wanting to be able to solve everything on my own, and even though I 
still have a little bit of that in me, I feel super empowered by the team that 
I’m working with. I think having discussions and making plans and learning 
from each other early in the process, being collaborative as opposed to a 
designer just going off into a corner and a developer being in a different 
corner—actually being collaborative early on in the process—I would even 
consider that a tool just because it’s so key to the process.
Then, maybe more physical tools. This is kind of funny. I start a lot of design 
work in TextEdit.
Really?
Yeah, it’s funny, but because it’s not design software it’s impossible to even 
focus on any visual or layout details. I like to start in TextEdit as a content 
inventory canvas where I start to type out things that I know are going to be 
on the page or on the app. I like to organize things in TextEdit just because—
it’s comfortable now, because I’ve been doing it for a while—but at least 
starting out there were uncomfortable constraints that forced me not to get 
visual, but instead think in terms of content. Then, if what I’m working on is 
a website or web app, then it’s really easy to take stuff from TextEdit, then 
just throw it into HTML and just start wrapping tags around it.
www.it-ebooks.info

 User Interfaces Begin with Words   |  95
That’s a great point.
I redesigned the General Assembly website maybe six months into working 
there. Completely from scratch. We started with the content. 
This is how we did the process: it started in TextEdit. 
We used it as a way to collaborate with other members of the team to make 
sure, “hey, is this the content that we’re going to want on this page?” By 
getting the right content in there, it was then super easy to turn the text into 
an HTML prototype with no styling. Then we all tested it by clicking through, 
making sure it felt like the right flows and things fit together right and the 
information architecture was right, then increasing fidelity from there. 
If you’re designing with code, you can then start to add in some basic CSS 
around things to make it look a little bit nicer and get a sense of hierarchy. 
That’s sort of my sketchpad, because, like I was saying earlier, I’m quickest 
in design. It works really well to just do sketches and start to hone out some 
of the more visual details there—but then just going back into the CSS and 
start adding in rule sets that match up with that design. That’s how it works 
when I do work on websites. Right now I’m working on this process of doing 
a native iOS app, and I think maybe at a high level, the tools and the process 
will be similar. But it’s kind of been a fun challenge so far since it’s the first 
native app I’ve worked on. It’s a little bit different.
There’s something about text. I know text seems not very designer-ish, but 
the Internet is text. It’s really all about the content and it forces me to think 
that way when I do that. 
I write out what it would actually say. I think it forces you to not let your-
self put in Lorem Ipsum and just headline goes here and things like that. 
You put all the content in and when you first start, you’re not playing with 
font sizes or anything. It’s all inline and it also goes along with this mobile-
first line of thinking, which, regardless of whether or not you’re building a 
mobile responsive site—which, maybe you are, but even if you’re not, sort 
of this line of thinking of, hey, if the user can only see one thing at a time 
or see things in a linear format, as opposed to columns and a lot of stuff on 
the screen—TextEdit forces you to be linear. Then you start to think about 
importance.

96  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
What’s going to be further down within the content or what’s going to be 
higher within the content, whether or not you break them into separate 
pages or different flows, you start to prioritize and give the content a hier-
archy just based on the amount of things before it. Doing this forces you to 
whittle down your content and make things shorter and smaller and more 
succinct and you start to rearrange stuff around. It’s actually pretty key to 
my process and I use it all the time.
Do you find that it makes your copywriting tighter because that’s all 
you’re focusing on at first?
Yeah, totally. I think copy is part of design, also like how voice is a part of 
design. When you’re doing it this way, it forces you to not write copy to fit 
the design. It’s just the wrong way to do it.
That’s super cool. So, just to recap, how do you make these HTML proto-
types more high fidelity? What’s the process? 
With the GA website as sort of a case study, I would be working on the 
information architecture and getting stuff structured right, and then I would 
actually just share the files. I would actually zip up a bunch of the HTML files 
and share that folder around to some team members and let them play with 
it. They unzip it on their computer. They just drag one of the HTML files into 
their browser and they can just kind of click through the either unstyled 
or roughly styled site. And while they’re doing that, I’d let them sit on that 
for an afternoon while I’m just playing with it and with the design, starting 
to move stuff around—questioning stuff that I had and then changing it in 
HTML. I just jump back and forth a lot between those two, working up to 
designing in higher fidelity.
At what point do you make the final push and get everything locked 
down? How does your team agree on how it looks and feels, and at what 
point do you firm that up?
It’s always changing. If you’re not delivering something to a client, if you 
are married to the product and you’re working on it all the time, you firm it 
up. It firms up naturally as you increase the fidelity as you’re working on it. 
You have to be decisive. I like doing stuff that’s iterative because you’re 
always thinking of everything as iteration. You’re always improving and will-
ing to throw stuff out and try new things—but at the same time, I’m very 
decisive about the work that I’m involved in. 
www.it-ebooks.info

 User Interfaces Begin with Words   |  97
So you’re making decisions all along the way and when something is work-
ing you’re like, OK, that’s probably not going to change. You kind of just lock 
that in. I don’t know if there’s a moment where you firm it up and you say, 
“now we’re moving out of this format and into this format” because you’ve 
made a decision. It just kind of happens and that process to me just hap-
pens naturally.
I think product design includes everything and so does user experience. It’s 
definitely not about an app. User experience design and product design, 
it’s not about an app, it’s not about a screen, it’s not about a user flow. It’s 
about a person.
It’s about the experience of a real human being, and that includes both what 
they’re looking at and whatever screen they’re using. It includes how they’re 
feeling in the chair that they’re sitting in or the streets that they’re walking 
down while they’re doing it—these products that we’re developing, they 
include the feeling that a user has while they’re interacting with it.
This includes marketing and the voice and the copy and the feeling is that 
this is going to stay with that person after they stop interacting with the 
screen. 
I’m working on this product right now called Canary and we built what we 
call “the world’s first smart home security device for everyone”—because 
it’s this simple device that you literally just plug in, and it has all these sen-
sors and an HD camera and it monitors your home and allows you to keep 
an eye on your home from your smartphone.
The reason I bring it up is because the product that we’re designing is defi-
nitely not the app, and it’s not even the device. Both of these things are 
included—that’s the physical thing that you use, the device that you set 
on your bookshelf or whatever and there’s a smartphone app that you’re 
going to be interacting with every day—but the product is that experience. 
The technology that’s in the device and the streaming and the flow and the 
interactions and the app are important, but only because they allow the 
user to be more connected to their homes, to be more connected to their 
family, and to have this experience that they couldn’t have before this prod-
uct existed. 
Product design is all-inclusive and almost impossible to define, because the 
list would be so long of what’s included in product design. But it’s every-
thing that touches the experience you’re creating.

I think part of product design, and being a designer in general, is caring 
about people, and thinking about people, and trying to put yourself in other 
people’s shoes. When you do things like that—the more experiences you 
have that are unique and different—the more you are able to have empathy 
for people that are different than yourself and people that do other things 
on a regular basis. You’ve got to try to have experiences that allow you to 
move past your own closed-mindedness, which we all have even though we 
like to think we don’t.
You’ve got to do things that help you have empathy for others, and think 
about how others experience the world. It makes you a better designer, I 
think.

Prototypes: Worth 1,000 Mockups
To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can 
control or master.
—MILTON GLASER
For two significant sequences in 1977’s Star Wars, George Lucas 
wanted to do the unthinkable: create dogfights in space. 
“I had no idea at that point how I was going to accomplish it,” Lucas 
said of the sequences. “[So I] got together with some of the people who 
I brought in to start ILM. We had to create different technology to 
accomplish [those shots].”*
At the time, film sequences were commonly represented by static, 
drawn storyboards. But for these particular sequences, Lucas knew 
that he’d have to put together something more robust to get the scenes 
he envisioned out of his head. 
We had to do it by sleight of hand…[we cut together] videomatics, 
crude animation, footage from actual dogfights and various doc­
umentaries to create a sequence of visual motion.
With the help of his then-wife and legendary film editor Marcia, Lucas 
cut together an eight-minute long 16mm film that represented every 
cut of the battle sequences.

Before the storyboards were done, we recorded on videotape any 
war movie including aircraft that came up on television, so we 
had this massive library of parts of old war movies—The Dam 
Busters, Tora! Tora! Tora!, The Battle of Britain, Jet Pilot, The 
Bridges of Toko-Ri, 633 Squadron and about forty-five other 
movies. We went through them all and picked out scenes to trans­
fer to film to use as guidelines in the battle.*
Shot-for-shot, the spliced footage would match the film’s final 
sequences almost verbatim. In the documentary Empire of Dreams, for 
example, there’s a sequence that shows the Millennium Falcon’s escape 
from the Death Star playing next to black-and-white clips Lucas spliced 
from the 1943 war film Air Force.† The cuts, the on-screen movement 
of the models, and the reactions of the actors are almost verbatim.
Lucas would continue to use whatever tools he had at his disposal to 
get the ideas out of his head and onscreen. 
We have always had to use some kind of device to give you a sense 
of motion. For the end battle of A New Hope, I used bits and 
pieces from documentary films about World War II and war foot­
age of airplanes flying, that sort of thing.
On The Empire Strikes Back, we had to do little cartoons of the 
walkers walking and explosions and stuff. For Return of the Jedi, 
we built little models [of speeders on Endor] and took a video cam­
era and we shot little videos of these little models on sticks going 
through the frame.‡
Lucas’s desire to have more control over his shots before shooting had, 
unknowingly, stumbled upon a technique he’d use to pioneer digital 
filmmaking techniques. In essence, Lucas devised a way to prototype 
scenes before getting cast, crew, or locations involved. 
And prototyping, in turn, is changing the way products are made—
by improving their quality before you go through the costly and 
time-consuming process of fully creating a product that isn’t quite 
right.

“When we finally got to The Phantom Menace, we were actually able 
to use digital animation to do our videomatics in a more sophisticated 
way,” Lucas described. “Eventually, we came to rely on that department 
to define how the movie would go together. We’d create the semblance 
of the film as if you went out and shot with thousands of people. You 
can’t do that with storyboards, but you can do that with pre-visualizing 
sequences within a computer” (Figure 5-1§).
The documentary The Pre-Visualization of Episode II describes how 
Lucas would define a particular sequence with a one-page summary. 
From there, storyboards would be drawn that defined the broad swaths 
of the motion that’d be taking place onscreen, along with a rough defi­
nition of the scene’s visual style.

in the Star Wars 
prequels. This “pre-viz” 
included no dialogue, 
temporary music, and 
repurposed sound 
effects that matched 
the intended tone of 
the scene. In the film, 
the final sequence 
closely matched the 
pre-viz—but with the 
inclusion of the real 
actors, new sound, and 
finished effects.

Using these static storyboards as a template, an editor would literally 
go “into a barn” with a handheld digital camera and film stand-in 
actors reading the script’s lines. Stand-in props like Lucas’s Ferrari or 
Luke’s old landspeeder prop from A New Hope would be used. 
“You need to develop videomatics to tell you editorially where you’re 
going, how long the shots are going to be, and whether it’s working 
because it’s a purely kinetic thing…it all has to do with movement,” 
Lucas said.
Lucas would then use the rough cuts to mold the sequence into what 
he’d envisioned first in his one-page text treatment. Over time, they’d 
reshoot the sequence, filming new shots and adjusting the timing 
until it was just right—then, a digital reconstruction would be built 
and played in front of the real actors (such as Ewan McGregor) while 
they filmed their actual sequences. The digital reconstruction would 
then be used as a basis for the final effects shots. 
Getting usable shots as quickly as possible—shots that could be cri­
tiqued, modified, and improved—was key to the entire process. 
“I couldn’t [make these films] without some kind of pre-visualization 
process,” Lucas said. 
As I watched this documentary, a wave of déjà-vu washed over me. The 
process sounded eerily familiar. And I realized how much we, as prod­
uct designers, could learn from it. 
The parallels to creating products are incredible. Lucas’s one-page 
sequence script? Sounds similar to the flows and screens we wrote 
out in the previous chapter. Rough storyboards and video sequences 
filmed in a barn? 
That’s Lucas’s version of prototyping. 
Product design thrives when exposed to the power of prototyping. 
It’s the embodiment of externalization—getting out the ideas in your 
head for your team, clients, and potential customers to see and experi­
ence for themselves.
Once the copywriting has been roughed out and the user flows 
mapped, the goal in this phase should be to get something working as 
quickly as possible—working being the operative word. What’s defined 
as working for your product will differ wildly, intersecting at the center 
of these four constraints (Figure 5-2):

Working doesn’t mean pixel perfection, fully fleshed-out color schemes, 
or, in some cases, even any code. 
Kyle Bragger, cocreator at Exposure*—a tool for photographers 
launched within software studio Elepath†—sees prototyping as “more 
about just getting something running…something that feels polished 
enough to trick your brain into thinking, ‘Oh, this is a product, I can 
use it.’ I can play with it and I can see how it feels to use.”
Bragger uses these early prototypes to challenge his assumptions. 
“Why does it have to be this way? Why are we doing it this way? This 
is what’s most important—it’s not the aesthetic, and it’s not the latest 
bells and whistles, [or] the latest design fads. It’s ‘Why am I design­
ing this? Who am I designing this for?’ What problem am I solving?

And really just being thoughtful about it, being able to articulate those 
things and understand every aspect of it and not just, ‘Well, we did it 
this way, because it was popular.’” 
There’s an old writing adage that advises writers, whenever possible, 
to “show, don’t tell” when bringing characters to life. The goal is to 
reveal the story through the character’s own experiences instead of 
the author’s.
When designing a product, we have a similar burden. Dammed up 
inside our heads are creative waterfalls of fresh interactions, tran­
sitions, and animations. But how are we supposed to communicate 
them? How do we get them out of our heads? 
Through a game of charades? I’m sure some of us have resorted to 
these antics. Confession: I have as well.
Not being able to “show” the interactions and animations for our 
designs is one of the core, common struggles plaguing how we design 
products.
The static mockups that we used to look favorably upon in the past are 
no longer good enough. They simply don’t do the job. Static screens, 
manually strung together, don’t communicate the motion or velocity 
of moving through an experience. 
Staticness, in other words, prevents us from telling our product’s story. 
And exacerbating this situation is the fact that we now design for 
screens that can be tapped, pinched, swiped, zoomed, and more. 
There’s no way around the fact that our interfaces must become tran­
sitional, alive, and reactive to fingers. 
So as the mouse becomes a relic of the past, let’s embrace movement 
and flows—let’s experience the product as early on as possible so we 
can avoid polishing the wrong gemstone—or, in our case, mockups.

Bigger Than a Buzzword
There’s a saying at famous design firm IDEO that if a picture is worth 
a thousand words, then a prototype is worth a thousand meetings.* 
That’s because prototyping is a form of communication. It’s transmut­
ing ideas into the physical realm where they can be experienced by 
yourself, your team, and your customers. 
It’s been surprising to me how bigger companies have been leading 
the way here. Organizations like Airbnb, Evernote, Facebook, and 
Google have been surprisingly benevolent by publicly showing us how 
they integrate prototyping into their product workflows. Even better, 
they’re showing us the practical and positive results of doing so. 
Efforts to bring prototyping tools down from the mountain and into 
designers’ hands are happening all around us. 
Let’s start with the obvious: InVision.† I haven’t seen a simpler, more 
democratic tool for helping designers and nondesigners alike to exter­
nalize the flows they have in mind. Hand-drawn sketches, wireframes, 
or even mockups of any fidelity can be strung together with convinc­
ing transitions that feel native. Then they can be distributed to the 
team member—who can leave feedback directly inline. 
“InVision is my first go-to prototyping tool, largely because it’s 
so fast and simple to set up with the added benefit of being able to 
share it seamlessly,” said Pauly Ting in our interview. Ting is a prod­
uct designer who’s worked with Fortune 500 clients, major retailers, 
and some of the largest automotive manufacturers in the world. “It 
requires no technical knowledge, which means when working with 
nontechnical stakeholders, it’s easy/low barrier for them to collaborate, 
participate, and more constructively contribute to the design process. 
It’s easily the fastest tool to use to create a polished-feeling experience.”
Apple Keynote and Microsoft Powerpoint are also enjoying a growing 
role in the realm of prototyping. 
“Especially with app design, animations are key—I’ve done a num­
ber of quick, low-fidelity animations to explain what happens after 
a user taps or swipes,” said Timoni West, a product design veteran 
from Flickr, Foursquare, and Alphaworks who currently runs her own 
design studio, Department of Design. “Often they’ll be presented

alongside static wireframes. Sadly, Keynote is still best for this. I don’t 
know of another simple product that allows you to cut-and-paste in 
vectors and perform core animations on them with an immediate 
preview.”
But if there’s any organization that’s opened the floodgates to build­
ing wholly original interactions within prototypes that feel native, 
it’s Facebook. They’ve been driving the state of prototyping forward 
ever since the release of Origami—a comprehensive set of tools and 
extensions built on top of Apple’s Quartz Composer.* Originally cre­
ated in-house by the Facebook Creative Labs team to invent new inter­
actions for iOS app Paper (Figure 5-3),† it paved the way for compet­
ing tools like Pixate,‡ Google Form,§ and Framer.js.¶ Even design firm 
IDEO jumped into the pond when they released their own suite of pro­
totyping tools called Avocado.**
It’s also been a poorly kept secret for some time now that Apple has 
a set of their own advanced prototyping tools. Rumored to be called 
“Mica,” it’s the tool that Apple created so that their UI designers could 
create interactive interfaces more easily.†† This has been rumored to 
replace Quartz Composer inside 1 Infinite Loop’s walls, and is used to 
create everything from interfaces to Final Cut Pro plugins.

This isn’t to say that prototyping is just a corporate fad—something 
akin to transparent glass whiteboards or Six Sigma. Or something that 
only elitist organizations with lots of time and money can afford to do.
Prototyping can help all of us who build products create better prod­
ucts. And if that weren’t enough, when prototyping has a presence 
in your design process, it has immense practical benefits. It has the 
power to bring your team closer together, help you make decisions 
faster, and, overall, make your end users happier.

It just might be the Holy Grail.
[cue John Williams’s Indiana Jones theme]
I was, in fact, previously a prototyping skeptic. I thought it was some­
thing that I didn’t have time to do and that my business partners would 
balk at introducing something new into our process.
While I set out both to learn how to prototype and to incorporate it into 
my workflow, I also went into the field to learn from designers who are 
prototyping veterans: Steve Meszaros, product designer at Wildcard, 
and Pauly Ting, a product designer who’s worked with huge compa­
nies like Macy’s, SiriusXM, and Jaguar.
Meszaros is building Wildcard’s nascent product with Khoi Vinh, for­
mer design director at the New York Times and named by Fast Company 
as one of the 50 Most Influential Designers in America. With Vinh, 
Meszaros is responsible for Wildcard’s interface design and interactiv­
ity, which aims to combine the performance and experience of native 
apps with the breadth of the entire Internet.
Ting was head of user experience at Tigerspike, a design firm that 
builds apps and mobile sites for Fortune 500 clients, from big-box 
retailers to Internet giants. His work had to operate at a massive scale 
from day one to satisfy not only his clients, but his client’s bosses and 
his client’s customers as well.
From our combined experiences, I distilled down what we learned 
about prototyping, how you can incorporate it into your workflow, and 
how you can avoid the early mistakes we made.
Goals of Prototyping
The first goal of a prototype is to test, prove, or conceptualize an idea 
that’s in your head within a limited timeframe or budget. You’re using 
this to focus your already-limited time. Prototyping cuts out fluff, tan­
gents, and feature-creep to help you focus on demonstrating a very 
specific use case or workflow.
“It’s much like a hackathon,” says Ting.
The entire purpose here is to get your ideas out of your head as quickly 
as possible, at a fidelity that presents the concepts in your head clearly 
enough.

“Prototyping interactions and animations has been pivotal to the 
development cycle here at Wildcard and allows us to articulate com­
plex ideas more clearly,” says Meszaros.
Many designers who are just starting out with prototyping begin by 
trying to do too much. But the entire purpose of prototyping isn’t to 
design the interactions of your entire product at once, or to just make 
pretty things. It’s to demonstrate bite-sized pieces of interaction or spe­
cific workflows.
The second goal of a prototype is to reflect who’s going to see it. That’ll 
help you understand how far it must go—does it have to include an 
entire flow or user track? Or just a simple interaction? How low or 
high fidelity does it have to be? A successful prototype speaks directly 
to its audience. 
But that’s not all. What are your time constraints? This can help you 
choose the right tools for the job.
Depending on how these factors are configured, a prototype can take 
on different forms. These are questions you need to answer before you 
start each prototype.
I love how Paul Stamatiou, product designer at Twitter, describes the 
give-and-take of these factors he experienced while designing Twitter 
Video:
While I love preaching about prototyping, I also clearly recognize 
when it’s useful and when it’s a waste of time. Prototyping takes 
a nontrivial amount of time and can very often be an unrelated 
technical challenge when you start needing to think about stor­
ing state and array manipulation. So I only went to prototyp­
ing if I needed to answer some big questions about how it might 
feel; things I couldn’t figure out in “my mind’s eye” as one of our 
designers says. I would get the prototypes functional enough to get 
the point across but wouldn’t spend an extra day or two trying to 
get every bit of functionality coded.*
“Rapid prototyping is about focusing an intentionally limited block 
of time in order to cut out fluff, tangents, and feature creep,” Ting 
adds to this line of thought. “Naturally, the more ‘polished’ the expe­
rience, the more impressive it feels and thus a higher chance of stake­
holder buy-in. That said, we must prove every decision we make. If an

interaction is critical to demonstrating a new/better/easier way to nav­
igate or work through an experience, then yes, we would build it. But 
if it’s simply chrome, then no.”
Remember, as a product designer, your job is to determine the prod­
uct and features your team needs to build. You need to understand, 
define, and communicate this as quickly and as thoroughly as you can. 
The product you define and design must solve the right problem and 
be something your team is capable of building within a reasonable 
timeframe.
“A prototype can serve many purposes. It can be just for demonstrat­
ing an idea, it can be for exploring and testing an idea, it can be for 
selling an idea, or it can be to build an MVP,” says Ting.
But prototypes are ultimately storytelling tools. If you can tell a better 
story because of the prototype, then you’ve already come a long way 
toward building a product that solves your customer’s pain. 
That’s because a prototype that tells a story helps to sell one user flow’s 
improvements over another, while emotionally connecting a user to 
the experience—however “faked” it might be. It enables users to get 
lost in the experience, while effectively illustrating key differences 
or improvements to pre-existing product flows with which they’re 
familiar.
This can be more powerful than simply prototyping a single interac­
tion, since single interactions are best understood by dedicated prod­
uct teams. Decision makers or test users will better understand where 
in the flow the interaction sits, how it’s different from any existing 
interactions, and how it will make an improvement over any previous 
iterations or their current product.
Once the prototype is ready for consumption, it should immediately 
be used to drive discussion and an eventual decision about how to 
proceed.
Here’s a great example of this in action—Twitter (again), but in a form 
you probably have never seen it. In mid-2006, Twitter could’ve been 
mistaken for a Craigslist clone. No CSS. Two, simple images (a yellow 
star and an outline of a start). Just a text box, a submit button, and 
an unstyled <ul> that listed in reverse chronological order the status 
updates of the people you followed (Figure 5-4).*

It required no fluff, no fancy UI, and no pixel-perfect mockups. Once 
the flows and copy were mapped out, the product was easily con­
structed with the most basic elements. Then, the entire team was able 
to play with a rough-and-tumble version to test how it worked and to 
see if it satisfied the stated goals of the product. 
Beyond speed, this is another huge benefit of prototyping. It allows for 
greater buy-in across your organization and even among your clients. 
The prototype becomes a common language that can be experienced 
and understood by everyone.
Your goal with a prototype is to understand where your interaction or 
flow falls short. What parts are implausible to build or too over-the-
top? Where do people get confused? What parts could use more per­
sonality or ingenuity? How could these changes inform other parts of 
your product? Get it in front of your developers, decision makers, cus­
tomers, and clients, and you’ll have quick answers to these questions.

“Visualizing [and experiencing] interactions allows us to have more 
constructive conversations with the larger team,” says Meszaros. 
“Prototypes have been instrumental in bringing together and facilitat­
ing feedback across all areas of the team, from strategy to engineering 
and design. By developing prototypes, we have greater control of our 
consequences. At Wildcard, discovering whether or not a build may be 
expensive is critical to staying on target,” he continues. “That’s why I 
strongly advocate designing and prototyping in context whenever pos­
sible. I find it best to build with all attributes of the UI in place as it 
would be in the final product.”
So, how long should the typical prototyping process take? After com­
paring notes, we found that the entire loop usually took about a week—
and, at most, two weeks for each prototype to be created, tested, iter­
ated upon, and readied for implementation.
“[One to two weeks] is a good blend between being able to come up 
with some quality ideas and delivery without all the fluff, tangents, 
and politics. It’s long enough to stop, breathe, and make smart deci­
sions, but not long enough to waste time,” he said. “The biggest thing 
I’ve learned about rapid prototyping is that it’s a great equalizer,” adds 
Ting. “Using tools like InVision or Quartz Composer really puts the 
onus on UI, UX, PMs, and engineers to understand each other’s disci­
plines and thus work together. We’ve had little conflict; everyone feels 
informed and it’s very organic in feeling. Rapid prototyping allows 
that. It’s not just a tool or even a methodology, it’s a culture.”
This timeframe will obviously vary with the type of project you’re 
working on and the people involved. For many small teams, though, 
the typical turnaround of this process can be as fast as a typical busi­
ness day.
“We can refine and tweak very quickly, at times, in a matter of min­
utes or seconds,” Meszaros said. “This level of control is really quite 
amazing. There is an art to interactive design, and prototyping gives 
us an edge.”
Readying for Consumption
Once the prototype has been vetted by your team and, ideally, your 
customers or clients, it’s your job to make it easy for your counterparts 
in engineering to implement.
www.it-ebooks.info

 Tangible Trumps Theoretical   |  113
Making it easy for your engineering counterparts to piece apart the 
experience you’re trying to achieve, the logic required to get there, and 
specific values for timing, speed, bounciness, and other particulars 
means you’re providing the connective tissue between each phase of 
the product creation process (Figure 5-5). 
Remember, with each iteration, your product increases in fidelity. So 
it doesn’t matter if your prototype is made up of a series of screens 
with simple transitions, or if you’re using a high-powered prototyping 
tool that exports code written like a robot. And it doesn’t even matter 
if you write sloppy code. By taking these steps, you’ve contributed to 
an increase in your fledgling product’s fidelity and gotten it closer to 
being realized.
Depending on your tools of choice, getting messy code into the hands 
of your engineers can take many forms. For some, it might be just 
handing off code you wrote in Framer.js, or sharing your Xcode sto­
ryboards. If you used Quartz Composer/Origami, share your compo­
sition files and extract key values, such as transition and animation 
timing. Include the type of easing curve, such as “quadratic in-out,” 
if applicable. Providing as much information up front about how to 
implement your ideas will increase the speed at which you can ship 
your product.
Bleed as much into the development process as you can, and hone this 
skill over time.
The payoff is that you can start getting micro-builds of features onto 
people’s phones, tablets, or desktops. They’ll test your assumptions. 
And through the process, your engineering counterparts will start to 
grasp fully just how much effort it’ll take to build your product with 
these features and designs.

Ultimately, you’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish through pro­
totyping. Not only is it a great unifier for your team and your custom­
ers, but it also builds excitement for what you’re building and makes 
everyone feel like they’re a part of the design process. It brings joy and 
momentum to design reviews. And it helps your team make better 
decisions.
“Prototyping helps us to make more deliberate and calculated deci­
sions as a group, and that is what may be the most important aspect 
of prototyping,” says Meszaros. “It’s an engaging way to review new 
features or updates and brings a bit of joy to our design reviews. 
Don’t be intimidated to prototype; you’ll be amazed by what you can 
accomplish.”
But perhaps the most powerful side effect is that it can make you a 
better designer. You’ll become both more productive and more cre­
ative. When you’re building rapid prototypes, you begin to create feed­
back loops that improve your designs. You’ll stumble upon ideas as 
you work through the core problem you’re trying to solve.
“There are regular situations where I would literally change a design 
in front of everyone mid-discussion and ask, ‘is that what you mean?’” 
recalls Ting. “And then we’d test and discuss that. It saved hours and 
days of emails, meetings, side conversations, politics, and debate.”
Shareable Notes
•	 Depending on who you talk to, a prototype can be worth 1,000 
meetings, mockups, or specs. The truth? I don’t care. Even if just 
one of these suppositions were true, I’d say that the value of proto­
typing your product—and increasing its fidelity over time—more 
than pays off.
•	 The intersection of timeframe, intended audience, required fidel­
ity, and the comfort you have with your tools should help you 
choose the right prototyping method. 
•	 Prototyping will help you gain a new respect for the engineering 
process. It’ll help you understand the cost of building the features 
that you dream up and the logic required to create seemingly sim­
ple interaction ideas.
www.it-ebooks.info

 Tangible Trumps Theoretical   |  115
•	 Use prototypes to break down the great product spec wall between 
you and engineering and to gain feedback from internal testers 
and your potential customers. They help you trick people’s brains 
into thinking that they’re using a real product, and, as a result, get 
you feedback you wouldn’t have otherwise gotten.
Do This Now
•	 Prototypes don’t have to be made with some fancy tool. String 
together unstyled HTML pages with links that you open on your 
phone. Take photos of sketches you drew and make them linkable. 
Do whatever it takes to trick your brain into thinking that this is a 
product you can use. Then you’ll be able to test your assumptions 
and start gathering feedback.
•	 If you want to go to the next level, though, teach yourself a proto­
typing tool. Play to your strengths. Don’t know code? Try InVision. 
Know JS? Go for Framer. Feeling experimental? Go Origami.
•	 Use prototypes to smash bad ideas, wasted time, and misunder­
standings before they start. Get something in the hands of your 
teammates and people in your target audience. See how they react 
without “leading the witness.”

Interview: Pauly Ting
Pauly Ting is a product designer who’s worked with Fortune 500 clients, 
major retailers, and some of the largest automotive manufacturers in the 
world to create mobile apps, ecommerce experiences, and more. He’s 
brought huge teams together by using prototyping as a leveler and a mas-
sive collaboration tool. He can be found at http://paulyting.com.
What’s the biggest thing you learned after making prototyping part of 
your design process?
The biggest thing I’ve learned is it’s a great equalizer. It’s the first time I’ve 
really found teams understand what agile really is.
Using tools like InVision or Quartz Composer, etc., really puts the onus on 
UI, UX, PMs, and engineers to understand each other’s disciplines and thus 
work together.
For example, when I was working with Macy’s, their PM told me: “in all my 
years here, this is the first time everyone’s engaged and excited about work-
ing together, and the UX, UI, and devs all want to work together.”
So we’ve had little conflict, everyone feels informed, and it’s very organic 
in feeling.
That’s because rapid prototyping allows inclusion. It’s not just a tool or even 
a methodology, it’s a culture. 
It’s about including people. About giving people the soapbox at the same 
time and not in a linear fashion. It’s about giving people the opportunity to 
be involved and to empower them—but also then to draw lines in the sand 
that everyone is aware of. 
I’d say it’s giving up some power [as a designer] and sharing the work 
around. But, honestly, it’s really a much faster way of working. It’s the whole 
issue of when you’re trying to make a decision with someone who isn’t there 
with you—like, “what color pants should I buy?” I can send you photos, I can 
describe it, I can email you the link, etc.—it’s just nowhere near as efficient, 
simple, or even accurate as you standing there in the store.
Because when you’re in the store, you are part of the entire context in which 
the decisions are being made. And that’s critical to project delivery and 
team engagement.
But why? It’s the revisiting of old questions, re-explaining things (which 
mind you, people are not good at).
Prototyping breaks down the silos and attempts to stop “offline” conversa-
tions where decisions are made outside of scope.
www.it-ebooks.info

 Tangible Trumps Theoretical   |  117
Do you think that prototyping gives designers more respect for the engi-
neering process? That it helps them temper some of those “crazy ideas” 
that creep into user interfaces?
Sadly, too many UX designers have no dev background. So they see some-
thing “cool” in an app like an interaction. Path’s “+” symbol menu is a great 
example. And they “want that,” despite an ignorance of what it takes to 
make, and, particularly in my situation, [it’s a minefield with] legacy sys-
tems, branding guides, marketing/legal teams, etc.
So, being a UX with a semi-tech background means that I annotate in real-
time with them to understand where and how information will be pulled, 
parsed, and handled. And that’s important because it means engineers are 
involved at the product design stage and not at the “we designed this so 
now you have to make it” stage.
One of my biggest pieces of feedback for Macy’s and clients alike was need-
ing to have multidisciplined teams. Sure, have specialists, but UX needs to 
have some UI and dev skills, UI needs to have UX and dev skills, and devs 
needs to have UI and UX skills.
And most importantly, PMs, the lynchpins and leads, need to have all three 
skills. They don’t need to be necessarily experts (although I believe it makes 
for significantly better product), but they can’t be ignorant. 
Help me understand the specific journey of a prototype. What informa-
tion do you need to start building one? The workflow of your target user?
I like to know what the intent is. Usually a rapid prototype is to test/prove/
conceptualize an idea in a limited timeframe and budget—much like a hack-
athon. What usually prevents these from being successful is when people 
approach this like a long-winded, heavily funded project with a million years 
up their sleeve, or don’t have a purpose or objective in mind other than 
“make stuff.”
Second, I would work out if we’re trying to create something focused on 
one particular user to track, or all. Sometimes we are focused on just one 
user in a specific context; others we need to consider everyone involved and 
show gains/benefits for all. I always want to design for and consider all peo-
ple involved, but in a system that might have a consumer-facing side and 
an admin-facing side, knowing you’re designing for the consumer helps to 
keep focus, and where necessary, allude to an expanded admin area with-
out having to design it for the sprint. 
I like to take the time to identify what success looks like for both the busi-
ness and the user, so that we can set a standard in whatever we create.
www.it-ebooks.info

118  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Third, I would interview the end users we’re designing for, looking partic-
ularly at their workflows and keeping questions without bias. A way that 
helps me really focus their feedback to inform our work is to create a User 
Sentiment Journey, which is a detailed workflow of the entire experience, 
not just the digital one. 
Lastly, I’d create a new workflow over the old one (to show gains, e.g., less 
steps or less variables, etc.). This includes the entire experience and I would 
color-code what “screens/views” need to be created, but also so the team 
understands the context of where a digital experience would sit within the 
greater experience.
I do all this before I sit in front of a computer and start drawing stuff.
How much functionality do you typically include in a prototype? A whole 
flow? A specific animation?
It depends. I like to create a whole flow so that I have a story to tell. Telling 
a story helps to sell gains, emotionally connect the users/stakeholders, and 
to show a comparison. A single function is fine if all involved have a deep 
understanding already (like a dedicated product team) of how that function 
will improve the product, but it will feel out of context/undervalued by a 
team peering in. Kind of like me trying to show you the value of cedar-wood 
windows for a house you haven’t been part of designing versus one that 
you have been.
When does a developer get involved? How does that feedback loop look?
I like a multifaceted engineer to be a resident on my prototyping team. My 
ideal team is a PM, UI, UX, multidisciplined tech lead/engineer—but they all 
must have the ability to understand each others’ role (i.e., a PM must under-
stand at least some code, a designer must have a design/UX eye, all must 
communicate well and demonstrate a strong blend between commercial 
pragmatism and the technical work). 
More often than not, engineers have been my biggest and best source of 
better design suggestions simply because they can provide “what if we 
could?” and “why does it need to be designed this way?” type questions. 
This is invaluable for real-time feedback about how a function might work. I 
would regularly design something and run it immediately past the engineer 
to say, “what if we did it this way?” This really helps them understand my 
thinking—what I’m trying to achieve—and offer suggestions, alternatives, 
and support.
www.it-ebooks.info

 Tangible Trumps Theoretical   |  119
When do you show it off internally or to a client? How does that feedback 
loop work?
It depends on the client relationship. My favorite is when I augment their 
team and we work together, side-by-side, as opposed to a client/agency 
model which is going away, doing something, and coming back for approval. 
I’ve had a lot of success working with clients using tools like InVision, partic-
ularly when there’s a lot of work and they want to feel included, kept in the 
loop, and want to see progress. Most clients are very excited by the tools 
and become quite engrossed in the design process, which always leads to 
better product, more ownership, easier buy-in, and a better relationship.
As a result, everyone’s excited, everyone’s motivated, and people feel pro-
fessional, part of the team, and ownership over their contribution.
What’s the typical turnaround of this process?
I’ve done a rapid prototype in 24 hours all the way to three months. Ideally, 
the longer the sprint, the harder it is to maintain momentum—it’s called a 
sprint, after all! Naturally, though, the bigger the project profile, the more 
detail we want/need about users and their experiences, and the scope will 
warrant more work, meaning more time. 
My favorite timeframe is 1–2 weeks. It’s a good blend between being able to 
come up with some quality ideas and delivery without all the fluff, tangents, 
and politics. It’s long enough to stop, breathe, and make smart decisions, 
but not long enough to waste time.
One key tidbit—it’s important for the entire team to stick together. One big 
problem is teams who are resourced across multiple projects/teams and 
contribute an hour here and there to a sprint. You’re either on the bus, or 
you aren’t. 
Do you find prototyping helps you come up with better ideas?
Of course. Anything that forces you to articulate and arrange your think-
ing will help you identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. 
The great thing about rapid prototyping is that you learn to let go of ego in 
your work, largely because the time invested per iteration is a lot less. 
Rapid prototyping helps teams come up with better ideas because it’s an 
inclusive process. Everyone involved in the project can now contribute 
their expertise along the way, as the work takes shape. It does require a 
multidisciplined and pragmatic team, though, as it can still fall victim to 
design-by-committee, but generally, I’ve worked in a team with me and one 
other, all the way to me and 40 others—with great success. 
www.it-ebooks.info

120
Sure, the bigger group was slower, but surprisingly the mood/attitude was 
much more receptive, positive, and people felt a sense of ownership and 
inclusion, which led to less conflict.
There are regular situations where I would literally change a design in front 
of everyone mid-discussion and ask, “is that what you mean?” And then 
we’d test and discuss that. It saved hours and days of emails, meetings, side 
conversations, politics, and debate.
And regularly, we’d find awesome and better ways of doing things from sug-
gestions from customers, designers, developers, product managers, mar-
keters, and business teams. My role of UX shifted from being the designer 
“presenting to the room” to facilitating and leading the user experience 
design, injecting my expertise and professional opinion at times when there 
needed to be a decision, and to constantly cross-check the team’s feedback 
and thoughts with the goal at hand, and the users we were designing for.
It also helped nondesigners to make better sense of why some decisions are 
made that could impact the product, and equally to designers why some 
business/engineering decisions are made that affect the product.

The Mechanics of Interface Design
The Push and Pull of Prototypes Versus 
Pixel Perfection
I keep a large number of details that will later go. I first do the 
animal with almost all its trappings. Then I gradually eliminate 
them…
—FRANÇOIS POMPON, FRENCH SCULPTOR AND ANIMALIER
Born in 1855, one of my favorite new artists, François Pompon, 
applied his coveted talents as a sculpting assistant for legendary artists 
Auguste Rodin and Camille Claudel in Paris. It wasn’t until 1922 at 
the age of 67, however, that Pompon became famous for his own work. 
Called L’ours Blanc, or The White Bear, Pompon’s huge sculpture of a 
polar bear is something truly unique (Figure 6-1). It lacks any orna­
mentation or flourish. It eliminates every unnecessary detail. And it 
makes no attempt to be realistic. Without these elements, the viewer is 
struck by the raw presence and personality of the bear. Pompon elimi­
nated the unnecessary details to help us focus on what makes the bear, 
well, a bear.
In this case, both the product and the process fascinate me. Pompon 
would actually sculpt his subjects (at this point in his life, they were 
mostly animals) with most of the details intact. Then, over time, he’d 
eliminate these details—the waviness of the fur, the texture of the 
[ 6 ]
www.it-ebooks.info

122  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
feathers, the sharpness of the claw—to focus on only the necessary 
aspects of the subject’s form. Without these details, he let the viewer 
focus on the purest elements of the animal’s character.
As product designers, our job in this phase is similar, albeit less physi­
cal. We’re gathering all of the information we can, completely immers­
ing ourselves in the problems faced by our potential customers. We’re 
binging on current alternatives in the marketplace, sampling heav­
ily to get inspiration for our own yet-to-be-invented solutions. Then, 
we’re iterating rapidly through the most plausible solutions to see what 
works best.
At this stage, we’re already moving along the process of stripping away 
the unnecessary. Increasing fidelity. Moving toward something we can 
ship (Figure 6-2). In Chapter 4, we created the copy for our product’s 
interface and began turning that copy into user flows and screens. In 
Chapter 5, we began morphing those flows into something tangible, 
something we could use to test ideas and start feeling how the product 
might behave.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  123
Now, we’re finally going to refine these elements into the ingredients 
necessary for a badass user interface. 
I think a lot of product designers make the mistake of jumping directly 
into Photoshop or Sketch or Illustrator. They misinterpret what it 
means to be interface first, and get caught in a loop of trying to achieve 
pixel perfection before really knowing which direction they’re going.
Look, there’s a push and a pull between all these axes. If interface 
copywriting, pixel-perfect mocks, and functioning prototypes were on 
a spaceship together, they’d be the directional thrusters responsible for 
lining up the ship for a clean seal on the airlock. 
Like I said in Chapter 5, this push-and-pull depends on your time­
frame, your internal audience, the required fidelity at any given stage, 
and your comfort with the tools you’re using. 
But at some point after you’ve written out your interface and its flows, 
you’re going to have to deliver pixel-perfect mocks. 
Here’s why. See, regardless of the internal living document that is your 
product plan and milestones—call it a spec, call it a user story, call it 
whatever buzzword your people use—combined with the prototypes 
you create, you’re still going to need the “hero” version of your prod­
uct’s interface. 
Apple, unsurprisingly, takes this approach to the extreme. Called 10 to 
3 to 1, Apple product designers are expected to design 10 wholly differ­
ent, high-fidelity mocks for each feature to be built. The 10 ideas are 
narrowed down to the best three, and then the team combines the best 
ideas of the best three into the final product.*

While this approach might seem too systematic or wasteful to some, it 
balances the pressures of creativity with a production mentality. It cod­
ifies the fact that most ideas will be left on the cutting room floor, but 
also sets limits on creative exploration. The goal is to drive a designer’s 
imagination in the right direction.
Why? Because pixel-perfect mockups are the ultimate communicator, 
because they can be integrated into your prototypes and filled out with 
the real copy you’ve already created. Then, boom. Suddenly, you’re fool­
ing everybody that this is a real product. Disbelief is suspended, and 
true opinions flow out. On top of that, pixel perfection, combined with 
prototypes, are the ultimate guidebook for engineers. 
So when the final product launches, nobody’s going to be taken by 
surprise. 
I’ll take those benefits over a so-called functional spec any day.
But while pixel perfection is critical, it sure ain’t easy. It takes a crazy 
amount of time. There are multiple screen sizes. Different platforms. 
Landscape mode. Portrait mode. Ergonomics to keep in mind. And 
five states for every interface.
But if you plan for these contingencies, the process becomes less 
overwhelming. 
Let’s start with the UI stack. In the next section, you’ll learn how to 
avoid the pitfalls of what I call “awkward UI” by always remembering 
how the five states of an interface work together.
The UI Stack: Five States of Interface Design
Have you ever experienced a user interface that feels lifeless? Have you 
created a UI that just seems to be missing…something?
If that’s the case, you’ve probably experienced a case of awkward UI. 
Awkward UI is a missing loading indicator. It’s forgetting to tell your 
customer where something went wrong (bonus points for doing so 
with a scary error message). It’s a graph that looks weird with only a 
few data points. It’s a linear snap into place when a new piece of data 
is introduced.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  125
Still not clear about what awkward UI is? Here’s a simple real-world 
example: I use Apple TV. A lot. (In fact, I have the latest episode of 
Star Wars: Rebels playing in the background as I write this.) Whenever 
I pull up my Purchased movies, I see the screen shown in Figure 6-3.
For a second, I get scared. Every time. And I use this screen often. I 
know what to expect.
But why am I scared? What are the mechanics that cause my brain to 
think I’m seeing what the Apple TV intends for me to see? 
There’s no loading indicator. No sign of activity. So in the span of sec­
onds, scary questions race through my head. Where are my movies? 
Are they lost? Deleted? Hijacked? 
Then, after my heart stops racing, the movies I own suddenly and 
unceremoniously pop into place. 
Man, that’s jarring. 
Contrast this with playing a movie. After clicking “play” on the Apple 
remote, I see a nice indicator that Back to the Future is getting ready to 
play (Figure 6-4).

indicator for calling

Notice the experiential difference? 
Creating interfaces that are easily understood by humans puts us 
product designers right up against the sad fact that computers are lazy. 
They don’t care about helping people understand what’s new, what to 
do next, or how to react when something goes wrong.
In a computer’s ideal world, all it would have to do is throw obscure 
error codes and scary-sounding alerts when something unexpected 
happens. Or, better yet, it would just talk with you in binary. 
But we don’t speak binary. We think in flows, and we’re used to the 
physical world. When a door opens, it swings on an arc. When some­
thing travels, you can see it move. When something falls, you can see 
it bounce. 
Awkward UI is when a product designer doesn’t take these things into 
account. That means that somewhere along the line, some rules have 
been broken. 
But which rules? 
The rules of the UI stack. Let’s talk about that now.
What’s the UI Stack?
Every screen you interact with in a digital product has multiple person­
alities. Five, to be exact (Figure 6-5).
FIGURE 6-4
The comforting signs of 
progress.
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  127
FIGURE 6-5
The UI Stack consists of the five states of a single screen’s user interface, as 
well as how the user moves through those states.
Depending on the context, these personalities are revealed to your cus­
tomer. In designer-speak, we call these states. And you should consider 
these states for every screen you make. 
That’s because following the rules of the UI stack and the five states 
helps you create a cohesive interface that’s forgiving, helpful, and 
human. 
Be honest with yourself. When’s the last time you created a screen that 
had only one state? Even if you’re creating weather apps (cue Dribbble 
joke), one state won’t cut it.
The reality is that the world in which we live isn’t perfect, and things 
go wrong. Servers take time to respond. And your customers won’t 
always use your product the way in which you intended. 
So, as a product designer, you’ve got to take these realities into account. 
That’s why every screen you’ll design for your product can have up to 
five states:
•	 Ideal state
•	 Empty state, including first-time use
www.it-ebooks.info

128  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
•	 Error state
•	 Partial state
•	 Loading state
As your customer moves through your product’s flows, they’re also 
going to move seamlessly between between each state within those 
flows. In other words, each state in the UI stack is built with the notion 
that UI states smoothly transition from one to another, and as many 
times as necessary. We’ll explore this notion together in the section “A 
Hypothetical Example” of this chapter on page 152.
But first, a brief interlude into Internet history. Back in 2004, Basecamp, 
the company formerly known as 37signals, wrote, in my humble opin­
ion, a groundbreaking piece entitled The Three State Solution.* (And 
no, this isn’t a plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.) They out­
lined that every screen should consider three possible states: “regular, 
blank, and error.” This blew my mind. And changed how I thought 
about design for the Web forever.
But things change on the Internet. First, there was the AJAX revolu­
tion (coinciding with the rise of Web 2.0, as it was then known). Then 
came mobile apps. Next came the mass consumerization of mobile 
and tablets and the Web in general.
Demands and expectations for UIs changed. And so the UI stack is my 
adaptation of the decade-plus idea from Basecamp.
With that noted, let’s talk about the ideal state.
IDEAL STATE
This is the first state to create, since it’s what you want people to see 
most often. Aptly named, it embodies the zenith of your product’s 
potential—when your product is providing maximum value and is 
full of useful, actionable content. It’ll serve as the foundation for every 
other state you’ll create for this screen. Think of this as the quintessen­
tial marketing page or mobile app store screenshot.
Let this state set the tone of each of the other states. Because as you 
iterate on your core interface, this UI could change completely over 
time. That’s both the beauty and the risk of iteration. 
And this has vast consequences for all of the other states.

All UI states lead to the ideal state. So start with this first, and let all of 
the other states fall into place as your designs get closer to solving your 
customer’s problem. 
Still not sure what I mean by the ideal state? Let’s take a look at some 
examples to clarify (see Figures 6-6 through 6-8).

EMPTY STATE
An empty state really is bigger than just one screen. It’s about pro­
viding your customer an incredible first impression as you introduce 
them to your product—to spur them to action, keep them interested, 
and remind them of the value your product’s going to provide.
There are three broad versions of the empty state. The first is what’s 
seen by your customer the first time they use your product. The sec­
ond is what’s seen when your customer voluntarily clears existing data 
from the screen, like when you attain the exalted “Inbox Zero,” for 
example. And the third is what happens when there isn’t anything to 
show, say, for a search result.
Broadly speaking, the risk with empty states is that it’s easy to tack 
them on as an afterthought. Most of the time, doing this either creates 
an overwhelming experience (see Figure 6-9) or a cold, impersonal 
one.
FIGURE 6-8

Coach marks—or instructional overlays—are, in my opinion, the 
best examples of an underthought first-time experience. They place a 
burden of learning on the customer that includes more interface and 
more memorization, all done with a pretty big mental interruption. 
What a buzzkill.
Let’s explore the first-time use state more in depth.
First-time use/onboarding
If a customer is using your product for the first time, this state is your 
one shot to describe what your customer will see when data exists. It’s 
your opportunity to encourage action, to help them understand the 
value they’re going to get out of this screen. First impressions happen 
only once, and this is your chance to make a great one.

I liken this state partially to what’s known in the literary and screen­
writing world as the “hero’s journey” (Figure 6-10). Introduced by 
Joseph Campbell in his amazing work The Hero with a Thousand 
Faces,* it’s the foundation of mythological stories found throughout 
the world, from The Odyssey to Star Wars. Here’s the basic premise:
A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region 
of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and 
a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysteri­
ous adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.
Propel your customers down the hero’s journey with the empty state. 
Call them to adventure, take them through known challenges and 
the temptations of the abyss, and transform them into more powerful 
individuals.

But how? Some ideas:
•	 Lead a horse to water. Be encouraging and uplifting in your copy­
writing, and speak plainly about what to do. For example, saying 
things like “Nothing to see here” really says nothing about what 
your customer should expect, and it’s a bit depressing that this 
would be the first thing they’d see. Instead, telling your customer 
the exact button to press and why they should press it is a much 
more helpful prospect.
•	 Use your product’s content to instruct your customer about what 
to do. For example, if you’re building a messaging product, your 
first-time experience might automatically include a message in 
the customer’s inbox. The subject line could say “tap to open me,” 
while the text within the message discusses more about how to 
manipulate and reply to a message.
•	 Offer an example screenshot of what the screen will look like in 
the ideal state. It brings a bit of hope to your customer that they’ll 
achieve something similar while showing off how potentially use­
ful your product can be.
•	 Monitor your customer’s progress and respond accordingly. If they 
pause too long on a certain screen, for example, you could mes­
sage them with a live chat asking if they need help.
Figures 6-11 through 6-14 show a few first-time-use empty states that 
I love.

its value by getting 
you a response back in 
real time. One critique 
is that the copy isn’t

respond immediately.

The subject of onboarding and first-time states is a topic big enough 
for another book. And it just so happens that one exists. If you want 
to jump into the user onboarding pool, I highly recommend Samuel 
Hulick’s excellent The Elements of User Onboarding.*
User-cleared data
The second type of empty state is the case where your customer has 
voluntarily removed data from the screen. An example of this would 
be if your customer completed all of the items on their to-do list, read 
all of their notifications, archived all of their emails, or finished down­
loading all of their music.

These types of empty states are great opportunities to reward your cus­

Great! View this amazing photo. Downloaded all of your music? 
Good—now go listen to it. Sifted through all of your notifications? 
Here’s something else you might want to read. 
A customer clearing data is a customer who’s engaged with your prod­
uct. Keep them in the flows your product has in place by doing the 
work for them. Don’t put the onus on your customer to make the next 
leap.
No results
In cases where your customers are browsing or searching for a piece of 
data in your product, there’s a chance that they won’t find what they’re 
looking for. These scenarios are amazing opportunities to infer what 
your customer intended to find and to make intelligent suggestions.

Amazon employs one of the best examples I’ve seen of this technique. 
Accounting for misspellings and similar searches, Amazon’s search 
rarely gives you an empty result (Figure 6-16). Instead, it’ll give you the 
closest matching result while showing which terms it didn’t match. 
As for Pinterest (Figure 6-17), well, not quite the same results as 
Amazon, but this is Pinterest, after all. Based upon how their search 
parsed my query, it should be relatively easy for a customer to adjust 
their search terms to get what they want.

The lesson: don’t just drive your customer off a wall in this state. Give 
them something they might be able to work with, or suggest an alter­
nate path.
ERROR STATE
This is the screen when things go wrong. Typically, this is more com­
plex than just one screen, since errors can occur in surprising com­
binations. Error states can include anything from missing or invalid 
form data; an inability for your app to connect to the server; the app 
trying to move forward to the next step without finishing an upload, 
leaving a page without text submitted; and more. 
FIGURE 6-17

results are categorized

Error states should also be comforting in the sense that your prod­
uct keeps all user input safe. Your product shouldn’t undo, destroy, or 
delete anything entered or uploaded by your customer in the event of 
an error. 
It’s apt to paraphrase Jef Raskin, creator of the original Macintosh and 
author of The Humane Interface. He writes: 
The system should treat all user input as sacred and—to para­
phrase Asimov’s first law of robotics, ‘A robot shall not harm a 
human, or, through inaction, allow a human to come to harm.’ 
The first law of interface design should be: A computer shall not 
harm your work or, through inaction, allow your work to come to 
harm.*
This advice could be well heeded by some particularly vile offenders 
of this rule: airline websites. Missing a tiny form field for a credit card 
security code, for example, frequently results in a page reload that 
blows away all of your meticulously entered details while highlighting 
the missed field with an offensive red hue (Figure 6-18).

FIGURE 6-19
Basecamp’s delightful, human, and highly specific error message upon signup 
for a new account.
Ideal error states, like Basecamp’s, occur dynamically without destroy­
ing any data input by the user. If a page or screen reload must occur 
to detect an error, please do everyone a favor and save whatever data—
however flawed—was input into your product. Typically, though, 
reloading a page to detect an error is a sign of laziness. For the sake of 
your customers, ensure you and your developers go the extra mile to 
handle errors in graceful and accommodating ways.
Additionally, error states shouldn’t be dramatic, nor should they be 
vague. Remember the “Blue Screen of Death”? The Mac’s “Kernel 
Panic”? Or—for those computing veterans—”Abort, Retry, Fail”? 
Each of these error states, by necessity, marked a significant system 
error requiring a computer reboot or retry. But to this day, each is well 
remembered because of the shock, fear, and confusion it conveyed to 
the end user.
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  143
Microsoft’s Blue Screen of Death (Figure 6-20) became so infa­
mous because it simply freaked people out. The blue screen—while 
better than a red one—was out of context, abrupt, and filled with 
scary-sounding jargon, even if it was useful in debugging the problem. 
That’s because error states must incorporate concise, friendly, and 
instructive copy as to what to do next. Vague error codes, hexadecimal 
numbers, and confusing advancement options are only going to scare 
and frustrate the people who experience these errors. 
Of course, your product’s audience might consist of rocket scientists 
or computer engineers. That’s a case when these highly technical error 
messages may be well suited to your customer. But as most of the 
world adopts software in their everyday lives, these types of error mes­
sages become less and less appropriate. 
Generally speaking, great error messages are:
•	 Written with your specific customer in mind.
•	 Constructive, clear, and helpfully specific.
•	 Positive—not intimidating or overly dramatic.
•	 Presented with the core of the error first, and, if possible, an 
inferred solution.
•	 Specific about exactly what is in error.

•	 As timely as possible.
•	 Written in grammatically and thematically correct language, 
without jargon and excessive abbreviation.
•	 Offered with clear paths or options to resolution, and with­
out excessive requirements (especially in the event of password 
security).
The error state is such a widespread occurrence, and one of the least 
desirable states for which to design. But I promise that if you put as 
much care into this state as you do into the previous two states, your 
product will be infinitely more joyful to use—and, more helpful, as 
you’ll have thought through common customer pitfalls and solved 
them in advance.
PARTIAL STATE
The difference between an error state and an ideal state is like night 
and day. But how does the screen look when there’s only one row of 
data? A few photos? A half-completed profile? 
The partial state is the screen someone will see when the page is no 
longer empty and sparsely populated. Your job here is to prevent peo­
ple from getting discouraged and giving up on your product. 
This is a great opportunity to design micro-interactions to guide peo­
ple toward the full glory of the ideal state. It’s a journey on which you 
take your customers to help them realize the true value of your prod­
uct. This implies an accomplishment—that your customer has spent 
some time in your product to see a glimpse of its potential. Keep them 
hooked. 
Some game design principles can be useful here. I’m not referring 
to the scourge-like yet addictive practice of making your customers 
gather crystals to advance à la Clash of Clans (Figure 6-21), but instead 
building what is called acceleration into this state of your product.

Acceleration helps a player visualize how they’ll be more powerful in 
the future, guiding them along a predefined series of tasks to complete 
to achieve this vision. The trick is to make the player not realize they’re 
performing what could be perceived as tedium in order to extract the 
maximum value from your product. 
Players entering [an acceleration phase] aren’t thinking about the 
tedious repetitions they have to perform in order to level up, they’re 
just doing them, and enjoying the accelerating rate of the results…
Rather, those players are caught up in a future in which their 
character(s) will be powerful in a way they can’t even understand 
yet. To put it more technically, they’re inferring an exponentially 
increasing power structure that vanishes beyond their player pre­
diction horizon. It’s not exactly the same as traditional flow, but 
the exhilaration of the players is subjectively very similar.†

LOADING STATE
It’s easy to overlook this state, and many product designers insert it as 
an afterthought. But there’s a very real burden that comes with setting 
expectations. When your app is loading data, waiting for an Internet 
connection, or transitioning to another screen, you must take great 
care to be mindful of how you represent situations where you’re fetch­
ing data. This can consist of an entire page takeover, lazy loading of 
content panes, or inline loading, potentially used when one might look 
up username availability from a form field. 
And the perception of loading is equally important. Too often design­
ers simply fill their screens with whitespace and spinners, placing a 
massive burden of responsibility on the content that isn’t there. This,

in turn, encourages your customers to figuratively watch the clock—
putting the focus on the indication of progress versus actual loading 
progress being made.
Such is the belief of Luke Wroblewski, a product design expert that’s 
led design teams from eBay to Yahoo! to Google, where he now resides 
after selling his mobile polling startup Polar.
Wroblewski and his team discovered that after they implemented a 
series of loading spinners for each poll, Polar customers began com­
plaining that the app seemed slower, saying things like “There seems 
to be an excessive amount of waiting around for pages to refresh and 
load—it doesn’t seem as quick as the previous version.”
Wroblewski realized that:
With the introduction of these progress indicators, we had made 
people watch the clock. As a result, time went slower and so did 
our app. We focused on the indicator and not the progress, that is 
making it clear you are advancing toward your goal not just wait­
ing around.*
Skeleton screens
This realization directly resulted in the creation of what Wroblewski 
calls “skeleton screens” (Figure 6-25). They’re a technique that’s been 
co-opted by at least Pinterest and Facebook in both their web and 
mobile versions.
Skeleton screens are an innovative take on the loading state—they 
place the focus on the content as it loads versus the fact that the con­
tent is loading. They accomplish this by displaying the basic structure 
of the page and gradually filling in the missing pieces as they down­
load. The beautiful thing about this technique is that it can eliminate 
spinners completely. And it can increase the perceived performance of 
your product.

Pinterest, while employing the use of the skeleton screen loading state 
concept, put a unique twist on its implementation: deriving the “aver­
age color” of the pin’s image and using that color to fill in the pin’s 
background. So before the pin’s image loads, you feel like you get a 
preview of what the pin will be. This technique is now used in Google 
Image search results, too.
Facebook invented a similar technique, used in their mobile app 
Paper and later implemented in their web version (Figure 6-26). The 
Facebook experience displays a stylized skeleton screen with shapes 
resembling content. And to communicate that the content is loading, 
the shapes will pulse with what Facebook calls a “shimmer effect.”

“Nobody wants to wait while they wait,” said Instagram cofounder

A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE
You’ve seen a number of examples of the UI stack and its five states in 
isolation (Figure 6-28). But how would they work together? How does 
the UI account for the transitions between each state? 
FIGURE 6-28
A reminder of the UI stack and its elements.
That’s the power of the UI stack. These states don’t exist in vacuums. 
They exist on a vertical axis that can be called at any time by the prod­
uct. It’s your job not only to account for each of these states, but to dic­
tate how the screen moves between each state. 
I’ve created a hypothetical messaging app to illustrate these ideas.
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  153
Why a messaging app? Because it’s not an immediately obvious 
example of these states at play. But I think it’s a great example of how 
even temporal UIs like messaging interfaces follow the rules of the 
UI stack. And, even further, it’s an illustration of how immense our 
responsibility is to ensure that each screen’s states flow smoothly from 
one to another. 
So what do we have to deal with in a messaging app? 
We have to account for when there’s no messages. This is our blank 
state.
Our partial state is when only one party has sent a message.
Then, there’s receiving a message—the typing indicator. This, in other 
words, is our loading state. 
But wait. There’s another series of loading states—when we send a 
message out. And then there’s the delivery confirmation. 
An error can happen along the line, too. That’s when our message fails 
to send. 
And you can’t forget the mechanism by which we recover from an 
error, and attempt to send again. There’s another version of the load­
ing state.
Finally, we reach our ideal state: when messages turn into a 
conversation. 
Our hypothetical messaging app
Let’s say Marty and Doc just exchange numbers and Marty wants to 
message Doc about what he’s just seen at Twin Pines Mall. 
Since there are no messages, we have an opportunity to exploit the 
empty state and encourage the customer into acting how we want 
them to act—in this case, that’s sending a message (Figure 6-29). 
www.it-ebooks.info

154  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
FIGURE 6-29
The blank state transitions into the partial state.
But what happens to this state when a message is sent? We need to 
gracefully wash away the empty state and shift it into a partial state: in 
this case, that’s when Marty sends only one message. 
Let’s fast forward to when Doc has responded (Figure 6-30). He’s 
sent one message—but he’s not done yet! Hence the typing indicator, 
another form of a loading state. 
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  155
FIGURE 6-30
The loading state—in this case, the typing indicator—transitions into a new 
incoming message.
Once the typing is done and the message is sent, we transition out of 
the typing indicator and bring in the new message, pushing the others 
out of the way. 
But what about when Marty wants to reply back (Figure 6-31)? First, 
we have to show some state awareness when there is text in the field—
notice how the “Send” button turns from grey (a disabled state) to blue 
(an enabled state). Then, once we send the message, another loading 
www.it-ebooks.info

156  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
state occurs for our send process. We keep the message dimmed 
during this time because there’s not a successful delivery yet—until 
the “delivered” stamp tells the customer that all is well. 
FIGURE 6-31
Sending a message requires state awareness changes on the “Send” button, 
as well as a series of loading states and a delivery confirmation.
But what happens if the message isn’t successfully delivered (Figure 
6-32)? Here comes our error state. The red marker replaces the loading 
spinner, and we’re left with a message in the “undelivered” dimmed 
state. Tapping (or, in this case, clicking into the Quartz Composer pro­
totype) on the undelivered message retries the send. We’re in luck this 
time, and the message fills in after the angry red “!” disappears and we 
can register a delivered indicator.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  157
FIGURE 6-32
Retrying a message delivery after a failed attempt. Getting out of the error 
state requires some careful considerations.
And that, my friends, is the UI stack in action. 
It’s the five screen states and the seamless transitions between them. 
Without these transitional elements, we risk confusing or surprising 
our customers as new states appear and disappear. Making people 
uncomfortable and confused isn’t exactly in our job description, now, 
is it?
Speaking of comfort, let’s shift over to the ergonomic considerations 
UIs need to consider in this world of touch screens and wearables.
Ergonomics: Thumb Zones and Tap Targets
In the last section, we dove into the five states of a user interface: ideal, 
partial, empty, error, and loading. These constitute the UI stack. And 
they exist on every screen you design—these user interface states are 
universal, no matter the context. Desktop. Mobile. Tablet. Wearables. 
TVs. Cars. 
Now, we’re going to talk about how your interface should take into 
account the physical world.

No, we haven’t suddenly jumped into the world of Minority Report, 
Back to the Future 2015 style, or gotten to play with those awesome 
holograms Tony Stark made with his friend JARVIS (or is he his 
friend? Hmmm…)
We’re actually going to be talking about natural thumb arcs and why 
they’re important for touch screen design. 
See, if you aren’t designing yet for touch screens, you soon will be. 
Don’t believe me? Look at Figure 6-33. IT’S A BABY USING AN iPAD. 
For the first time ever, a generation is growing up touch-screen-first. 
Let’s just say touch-based interactions aren’t going anywhere anytime 
soon. The mouse is becoming a relic of the past. We now must design 
for screens that can be tapped, pinched, swiped, zoomed, and more. 
So how do we handle this? 
Well, remember when we explored the history of product design in 
Chapter 1 together? We looked at the work of Lillian Gilbreth, Henry 
Dreyfuss, and Scott Cook. What was the big theme? 
Research. Namely, we need to understand how people hold their 
phones, tablets, and wearables, and how they use touch-enabled 
desktops. 
And we’re in luck.
Mobile expert Steve Hoober conducted a study with 1,333 people in 
early 2013.* He discovered that people held their phones in the follow­
ing ways (Figure 6-34):

•	 One-handed: 49%
•	 Cradled: 36%
•	 Two-handed: 15%
Handedness figures were also instructive:
•	 Right thumb on the screen: 67%
•	 Left thumb on the screen: 33%
Hoober notes that left-handedness figures in the population are around 
10 percent. So the observed higher rate of left-handed use could be cor­
related with people doing other things at the same time—smoking, 
riding a bike, drinking coffee, eating currywurst, and so on.
FIGURE 6-34
Steve Hoober’s 2013 study found that 49% of those observed used their 
phone with one thumb.†
So it’s looking like the 3.5- and 4-inch screens of yore will start their 
inevitable decline very quickly. That means that those of us who’ve got­
ten comfortable building apps, responsive sites, and mobile-optimized 
web views with the old ways in mind have to learn new tricks.

That decline is already in motion. Adobe’s 2014 Mobile Benchmark 
Report claims that mobile browsing among phones with 4-inch 
screens or smaller was down by 11 percent in May 2014 versus a year 
earlier (Figure 6-35).* 
FIGURE 6-35
Adobe reported in May 2014 that phones with “large” screens (defined as 
being above 4 inches) are driving more Internet traffic than ever.
But this only accounts for phones sold up to May 2014. If you remem­
ber, Apple reported the most successful quarter ever of any company 
well…ever, in January 2015. Almost 75 million iPhones were sold, with 
the iPhone 6 being its most popular device.†
That means that learning how to design for thumbs is now more 
important than ever. Luckily, it helps that these phone display sizes are 
going to be practically universal. A cursory examination‡ of the most 
popular Android screen sizes points to a range of 5.1 to 5.7 inches.§

Apple’s changes will make our lives easier as smaller screen sizes die 
off, since the iPhone 6 and 6+ clock in at 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively. 
But why do we need to adapt our designs? As Hoober’s research 
showed, people using their phones tend to switch their grip depend­
ing on the interface’s demands. They seem to do this subconsciously, 
too, repositioning their hands or setting things down to take an action. 
That sends up a red flag for me, though. Why should people adapt to 
your app? Why is your app special? Why not create app controls that 
are the most comfortable for most people’s grips and thumb arcs? 
Designing for Thumbs?
What does it mean to design for thumbs? It means building inter­
faces that are the most comfortable to use within our thumb’s natural, 
sweeping arc.
But this gets complicated. Take touch screen mobile phones, for exam­
ple. We unconsciously adjust the way we hold our phones to reach cer­
tain controls in various areas of the screen. During any given day, I’ll 
wager that you stretch your grip, choke up on the phone, or angle it in 
ways that make reaching difficult areas easier.
But we have to start somewhere. Hoober’s research suggests that most 
of us hold our phones in the following way—with the bottom of the 
thumb anchored on the lower-righthand corner (Figure 6-36).

ENTER THE THUMB ZONE
This leads us to the idea of the Thumb Zone. It’s a heat map of sorts—a 
best guess for how easy it is for our thumbs to tap areas on a touch 
screen.
Let’s use Hoober’s research to create a Thumb Zone map represent­
ing what seems to be the most common use case for touch screen use:
•	 One-handed use
•	 Right thumb on the screen
•	 Thumb anchored in the lower-righthand corner
Here’s the Thumb Zone heat map applied to mobile phone sizes from 
4 inches to almost 6 inches, measured diagonally (Figure 6-37).
FIGURE 6-37
The Thumb Zone applied to screen sizes from 4 inches up to approximately 6 
inches diagonally.
Here’s a more direct comparison of large screens next to each other—
4.7 inches and 5.5 inches (Figure 6-38).

164  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
You’ll notice that the “safe” green zone stays roughly the same (more 
on why the largest screen is different in a second). That’s because our 
thumbs don’t magically scale with the screen size. And that’s also 
unfortunate, because I loved Dhalsim in Street Fighter as a kid (Figure 
6-39).
FIGURE 6-38
4.7- and 5.5-inch 
screens with the Thumb 
Zone overlaid.
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  165
But what changes is the sheer amount of “Ow” space, which becomes 
startlingly apparent with the 5.5-inch screen.
Furthermore, you’ll notice how the shape of the “Natural” zone 
changes for the largest screen. That’s because it requires a different 
type of grip due to its size, using your pinkie finger as a stabilizer. It 
surprises me how different the experience can be with less than an 
inch of added real estate.
Choking up
Let’s analyze how the Thumb Zones change when you shift your 
grip. Sometimes you might be in a situation where it’s easier to tap 
the phone with your thumb’s anchor at the vertical midpoint. This 
is demarcated by the white dot on the right side of the Thumb Zone 
mockups. 
Here’s an illustration of this in action for 4.7- and 5.5-inch screens 
(Figure 6-40).

Notice how the larger screen actually gains natural thumb space 
because of its size. By comparison, the 4.7-inch screen just runs out 
of real estate.
Thumb-Friendly Interfaces in the Wild
Mobile screen sizes on the whole are becoming more similar, and 
that’s a good thing. But it also means that we can’t just treat screens 
above the 4.7-inch range simply as a scaled-up version of a smaller 
phone. Grips completely change, and with that, your interface might 
need to do so as well.
But how would that look? Let’s explore a few thumb-friendly interface 
ideas. 
AIRBNB
After Airbnb’s rebranding, the home rentals app went through a rede­
sign to place some primary actions near the bottom of the screen. Take 
a look at the two examples in Figure 6-41.

the midpoint of your

FIGURE 6-41

Both screens have obvious primary actions, and they don’t depend on 
obscure gestures or OS-level controls— like Apple’s “reachability” fea­
ture, which brings the top of the screen down into Thumb Zone green 
territory with the double tap of the home button. 
Airbnb, however, does incorporate Apple’s “edge swipe” to prevent 
needless hand stretching to reach the top back arrow.

TINDER
Tinder’s primary controls are nice and obvious at the bottom of the 
screen, and well in the comfortable realm of the Thumb Zone. But 
what’s even more fantastic is that swiping each card away (both “Like” 
and “Nope”) lives in the green zone as well (Figure 6-42). 
Finally, the app’s been geared to respond to broader swipes for naviga­
tion—so swiping between Settings, Discovery, and your matches can 
be done with one hand. Beautiful.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  169
In the end, placing controls closer to the bottom of the screen when 
designing for touch is a wise choice. This way, your controls are in 
reach of natural thumb arcs. And even if your customer cradles the 
phone with one hand and uses the other as their primary hand, your 
product will still be optimized for one-handed use. Don’t forget, too, 
where device manufacturers place their primary controls: Apple’s 
home button, Android’s navigation controls, and Windows Phone’s 
back, start, and search all rest at the bottom of the device.
Next up: how to design for an unlimited number of devices and their 
unique screen sizes, capabilities, and contexts.
Cross-Platform Design
There are now more mobile-connected devices than people on our 
planet.* And each device brings with it a series of constraints: screen 
sizes, input methods, hardware limitations, and more. 
But it gets even more nuanced. We’re using a more diverse set of 
devices on an individual level (Figure 6-43). In the morning, we might 
use a tablet, a mobile phone, and a TV. During the day, we might use 
a laptop, our smartwatch, and the onboard computers in our cars. 
And at night, we might be back to the mobile phone, tablet, and TV 
combination.

FIGURE 6-43
Charbeat’s study of how device usage varies by time of day. Each type of 
device has a very specific usage pattern.*
With the onset of cheap, networked, and largely touch-driven devices, 
there’s no way that we, as product designers, can predict the future. 
We live in a world now that already sees networked light bulbs, refrig­
erators, and toasters. Heck, my electric toothbrush even has a compan­
ion app. It tells me when to replace my brush head. Speaking of, I just 
got a push notification that I’m overdue for a replacement.
So when there’s an endless constellation of devices for which we might 
need to design consistent experiences, how do we cope? How do we 
create products that are not only future-proof, but can still destroy our 
customers’ pain on any device they decide to use? 
This was a big question. And so I turned to Benedikt Lehnert, the chief 
design officer of successful cross-platform to-do company Wunderlist. 
Wunderlist spans a slew of platforms from desktop to iOS to Kindle 
Fire, including iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, Android, Windows 
Phone, Windows, and the Web. Wunderlist was acquired by Microsoft 
in June 2015.
Lehnert had a few messages for us on this topic.

What Do Your Customers Need and Expect?
“We want people to feel that Wunderlist helps them get stuff done 
and keeps their life in sync,” Lehnert said in our interview. That’s the 
core task that Lehnert instilled in his product team when setting out 
to build a cross-platform experience. It’s “the most important thing to 
formulate, communicate, and instill in your team…how it feels for peo­
ple to interact with your product.” 
Lehnert’s statement reflects the spirit of what we’ve been talking about 
from the start in Chapter 1: your product exists to find a customer, and 
it stays alive by solving their pains. Living on a new platform doesn’t 
change this unbreakable rule. 
At Wunderlist, everything flows from here. “From there, you start and 
go into specific UX definitions and spec for each of the functional­
ities…we want every interaction to be as lightweight (fast and simple), 
easy (obvious and clear), and fun (delightful and human) as possible. 
The values that are formulated in our UX vision for Wunderlist shape 
every decision we make on flows, colors, language, iconography, etc.”
The Berlin-based company—consciously or unconsciously—infuses 
their product’s behavior on every platform with the things that their 
customers care about. Speed. Clarity. Simplicity. A little humanity. 
These are the commonalities a customer can expect to encounter 
when using Wunderlist, from iOS to Kindle Fire. 
What’s Specific to the Platform? 
Just because a customer might expect to have a consistent experience 
with your product across multiple platforms doesn’t mean that you can 
ignore the specifics of each operating system. 
“A cross-platform product experience has to be both consistent with 
the core product experience as well as the platform paradigms of each 
operating system,” Lehnert said. “So, as a designer your job is to know 
and understanding those paradigms in order to navigate your way 
through them.” Building a product for multiple platforms means that 
you have to respect the norms. On Android, for example, system con­
trols are at the bottom of the device, versus a single home button on 
iOS devices. This significantly affects how you approach a product on 
mobile phones and tablets.

It’s the same with every platform. Designing for set-top boxes? You’ll 
need to know the capabilities of each remote control or controller—
Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Xbox, PS4, and so on—they 
each have their nuances. Being intimately aware of these nuances and 
incorporating them into your product is an essential responsibility of 
a product designer.
But there’s a limit. “Knowing when to follow the guidelines of the OS 
and when to break those guidelines in order to ensure consistency 
across platforms needs a certain level of experience and design mas­
tery,” said Lehnert. Ultimately, we’re building a product for our cus­
tomers. What are their needs? If the guidelines of the platform for 
which you’re building come into conflict with those responsibilities, 
what should you do?
“Whenever we find conflicting interactions across platforms, we try to 
come up with a better solution,” said Lehnert. “It’s easy to follow guide­
lines. It’s harder to know when to break them. We want to encourage 
all developers and designers to question existing paradigms and push 
boundaries with the end goal of making products easier and more 
enjoyable to use.”*
One example of this is the pull-to-refresh gesture versus the refresh 
button introduced by Loren Brichter in Tweetie, and since incorpo­
rated into Twitter’s app after Tweetie’s acquisition (Figure 6-44).

Lehnert compares the elegance of the pull-to-refresh gesture introduced 
in Twitter versus the refresh button, seen here in a previous version of 
Instagram.†
This is the perfect example of a UI evolution driven by platform con­
straints: in Tweetie 1.0, a refresh button would sit at the top of a user’s 
timeline. This was borne of necessity at the time—Brichter couldn’t 
fit a refresh button into the navigation bar. For the next version, he 
sought to correct this. “Why not just make refreshing part of the scroll 
gesture itself?” he asked himself. And so pull-to-refresh was born 
(Figure 6-45).‡

What Are the Use Cases for Each Device?
The same version of your product isn’t going to exist on every plat­
form. What are people trying to accomplish on their devices? When 
are they using them? A product that’s tone deaf to these considerations 
can easily blow it. 
I love how Lehnert characterizes this notion. “Wunderlist is a part of 
our user’s life on multiple devices and platforms every day,” he said. 
“Our goal is to escalate Wunderlist from mere software to a charac­
ter, a helpful friend, that is there when our users need or want it. An 
authentic character that is opinionated and infused with our values 
and which evolves over time in the way it looks, works, and speaks. 
That’s what inspires people and makes them fall in love with our 
Wunderlist.”

He knows the expectations that his customers have for Wunderlist in 
each unique situation, and they build the product on each platform 
to meet those expectations. “We want to get a deep understanding of 
what needs and demands people have in certain situations, and how 
we can cater the product best to their needs.”
So that’s why, for example, there’s not a full-fledged, bloated version of 
Wunderlist running on the Apple Watch. Instead, it’s a stripped-down, 
lean piece of software that tells someone only what they need to know, 
when they need to know it (Figure 6-46). 
FIGURE 6-46
Wunderlist’s contextual Apple Watch app in action.
“One of the most exciting things about Wunderlist for Apple Watch is 
the hands-free experience in situations where you would have had to 
juggle your phone,” Lehnert wrote. “Whether that’s going through the 
supermarket and checking items off your grocery list or, soon, using 
smart voice input to add to-dos for tomorrow’s meeting.”*

Remembering what your customer expects, respecting—and break­
ing, when it matters—a platform’s paradigms, and understanding the 
specific use cases of each platform are principles that are going to ben­
efit any product in the coming years. The number of screens, devices, 
and contexts is only going to increase. 
That concludes our exploration of the mechanics of interface design. 
Let’s review what we’ve discussed and move onto what goes into the 
psychology of an experience.
Shareable Notes
•	 There’s a push and a pull between interface copywriting, pixel-perfect 
mocks, and functioning prototypes. If they were all on a spaceship 
together, they’d be the directional thrusters responsible for lining 
up the ship for a clean seal on the airlock. 
•	 Eventually achieving pixel perfection in your mocks—or whatever 
you call them—is still a requirement. You’re still going to need the 
“hero” version of your product’s interface, regardless of the inter­
nal living document that is your product plan and milestones—
call it a spec, a user story, or whatever buzzword your people use.
•	 Pixel-perfect mockups are the ultimate communicator, because 
they can be integrated into your prototypes and filled out with the 
real copy you’ve already created. Suddenly, you’re fooling every­
body that this is a real product. Disbelief is suspended, and true 
opinions flow out. On top of that, pixel perfection, combined with 
prototypes, is the ultimate guidebook for engineers. But don’t 
forget: these are most effective after you’ve written out the user 
flows and created working prototypes. Otherwise, you heavily risk 
a flow that falls flat. Too many of these, and you risk a product that 
falls flat. 
•	 “Awkward UI” is a missing loading indicator. It’s forgetting to tell 
your customer where something went wrong (bonus points for 
doing so with a scary error message). It’s a graph that looks weird 
with only a few data points. It’s a linear snap into place when a new 
piece of data is introduced.
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  177
•	 Awkward UI can be alleviated with the UI stack. The UI stack 
is a combination of five states of interface design—ideal, empty, 
error, partial, and loading—and how a customer moves seam­
lessly between each state.
•	 Design for ergonomics with the Thumb Zone. It’s a heat map of 
sorts—a best guess for how easy it is for our thumbs to tap areas 
on a touch screen.
Do This Now
•	 Which pieces of your product’s interface are jolting and scary? 
Apply the principles of the UI stack to every screen of your user

Interview: Diogenes Brito
Diogenes Brito is a product designer and a developer who’s worked at Slack, 
LinkedIn, and Squarespace. He can be found at http://uxdiogenes.com and 
on Twitter at https://twitter.com/uxdiogenes. 
I just wanted to start out by talking about a post you wrote awhile ago 
entitled “On Being a Designer and a Developer: Not Quite Unicorn Rare.”* 
You have this very lucid, clear way of breaking down what can be fuzzy, 
multidisciplinary roles required of a designer and a developer.
Obviously people are very interested in this intersection between design 
and development. I wanted to ask you what led you to your conclusions, 
where you talk about how good designers and good developers have a lot 
in common. I would just love to walk through that thought process.
Sure. It’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a long time, albeit not 
super clearly, I would say. Partially because I’d always wondered if it was an 
OK goal, because I was on the fence between design and development. I 
wanted to do design, but the only way to really accomplish that was to build 
these things myself.
When you’re a freelance web developer and you’re a one-stop shop for a 
client, you have no choice but to do both sides. Once I had that skill set, I 
was thinking, am I allowed to pitch myself this way? Is that something that 
even, people will respond to, or they just won’t believe me out of hand? It’s 
not a real thing to be both designer and developer.
It’s been a struggle, of course, but I think what really cracked it open for 
me, I’d say, was that Austin Bales talk that I referenced actually in the post.† 
I had this idea, actually—the diagram came way before the post. The post 
grew around the original diagram, which is this spectrum.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  179
I was thinking what is true about the way people consider design and devel-
opment being diametrically opposed.
I think that it’s like he said, that in some cases it is an artist versus, I don’t 
know—I can’t come up with a good example. What did he say? He said 
barista and rocket scientist, I think...
Because all the examples I could come up with actually still had stuff in com-
mon. I was about to say an artist or blacksmith or something. That doesn’t 
actually apply, because a blacksmith is both.
After just listening to his talk, I was thinking yeah, the reason you can be 
both is not because you can be two people—because you can’t. There’s a 
limit to how much time you have and how good you can be at anything, 
really. But because there’s so much overlap, and I think of the skills required 
of making you a good, professional-level designer and developer, because 
they overlap so much, I think you can do both. It’s to your benefit if you can 
do a little bit of both.

Then I think that leaves the last problem of getting other people to believe, 
or seeing how that fits in the general marketplace. Because part of the 
problem is you can only be both of these people when you’re in a small 
development shop, a small startup, a one-man operation.
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  181
Each person has a certain level of skill in the designer and/or developer sub-
ject areas, where many of the skills and habits that would make you excel in 
either area would help in both. People may have a tendency to lean towards 
one area over the other, but no one has a “type” that would prevent them 
from learning and improving as a designer or a developer. What matters is 
the time and effort put into learning.
Once you get into a larger company where people start to specialize, it’s 
not something you can really pull off successfully as far as selling to other 
people.
Yeah, and that last point’s interesting, because I’ve always had an urge to 
be like “Oh wait, no, no, I can do both.” Is there a point where you have to 
be boxed in? How do you deal with that?
See, that’s the thing. The way I see it is the reason I put that professional 
level and that world-class level on there was because I think you can get to 
a professional level, and you can be really good at both. But if you want to 
be really world-class, you have to skew in one direction.
That’s because world-class musicians, they have one instrument. You know 
what I mean?
They can play multiple ones, but they’re known for this one instrument. I 
think it’s the same deal with being a designer or developer. To really get to 
a really, really high level, you need to have an in-depth knowledge of your 
medium.
There’s the principles and all that stuff, and a lot of that overlaps, but to be 
really, really good, you have to know your medium. You have to be in that 
community. You have to stay up on the latest trends and this, that, and the 
other. It’s pretty difficult to do both of those things at the same time.
You can be professional and you can even do both at work, but I would say 
I started more as doing frontend stuff actually at Squarespace, and not as 
much design stuff. Now I’ve flipped the ratio.
It is difficult to switch modes mentally, from more convergent thinking to 
divergent thinking. You need time when you’re doing design. How do I 
describe it?
Some things are different enough that it’s difficult to switch back and forth 
or do both simultaneously. Both of these skill sets can be stored in the same 
person, but you’re going to be using each, you’re going to be using only one 
at a time, and then switching back and forth as you go.

182  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
The things that’ll make you good at one will also make you good at the 
other. What I mean there is, think of the example of something like staying 
up late and coding. You can hammer on a problem and just keep going into 
all hours of the night, and work on this development problem. It’s totally 
the opposite, I think, for design. Where you have to be in a sort of mindset 
where staying up late or doing any of that isn’t really going to help you past 
a certain point.
I guess the same is true in some respects about development. You’re put-
ting yourself in a different place creatively when you’re working through a 
design problem versus working through a development problem.
Switching back and forth between those two kinds of problem solving is, 
a single person can do it, but in order to do both of those things well—for 
example, at your job, on a continuing basis, you have to do a couple days of 
one and then a couple days of the other. Not “I do this for an hour and do 
that for an hour” kind of thing.
You’ve definitely got this thirst for research, real raw research, about 
behavior and the effect of aesthetics on trust and even usability. What 
are you dialing into these days? Or do you have any authors or professors 
or thinkers that you like to track? What kind of areas do you spend time 
investing in and soaking up?
Part of this is a result that psychology was part of the curriculum, but once 
you know a couple of these basic sorts of heuristics and tendencies that 
people have, they come up again and again in design. You’ve got to keep 
your eyes open for other indications of that same sort of thing happening.
It is a good idea to keep an eye on, I guess, published psychology journals. 
Really, a good way to get overviews actually of what you might want to read 
more into is some of those pop psychology books like Malcolm Gladwell.
I think I started back in the day with Don Norman’s Emotional Design, and 
that really got me thinking of how some very basic animal tendencies we 
have should inform the way we design.* 
It’s like what makes economics interesting. If you make the assumption that 
humans are rational, there’s a bunch of conclusions that follow. Real life 
will show you, and any economist will tell you, that humans aren’t rational. 
There’s loss aversion, and there’s all this not mathematical stuff that we do 
because of how we feel emotionally.

[I was reading Jim Collins’s Good to Great, where] he talks about the 
Hedgehog Concept—which is this one vision to align the company with, but 
it’s not really just the fact that there’s a vision to align the company with, but 
the fact that there’s this vision you actually can execute, and you guys are 
passionate about it and this, that, and the other.
It’s easy to see how that idea connects to what you would find in a normal 
design process when you’re searching for insight about what you should 
do with a particular feature. Like what does the product that this feature’s 
going to be in represent to the user? What can be the best connection 
between this new feature and what already exists in the product and what 
people are familiar with?
It all wraps together. It’s like different facets of the same idea, trying to fig-
ure out what people are about and what they’re motivated by. Reading any 
of those books in general that are informed by—they have good analysis, 
but they also have good data. That just does, I think, wonders for your abil-
ity to think about the craft.
That reminds me of another book. It’s a book called The Humane Interface, 
by Jef Raskin.* 
What he says, basically—what the whole book is really about—is that an 
interface should be humane. Humane means that it is considerate of human 
frailties. It’s responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties.
One thing that he says in the book somewhere, it’s like, “consider your 
users smart but busy.” He also says that you should always be focusing your 
design efforts on intermediates, because everyone goes towards interme-
diacy. Beginners don’t like to feel like beginners. No one likes to feel incom-
petent, like they don’t know what they’re doing.
They want to quickly blast by being “noobs” to knowing what’s up, being 
intermediate. Then experts, you need to be able to do expert things, and if 
you use this thing every day all the time, you need to be able to do things 
quickly. Really, most people are going to be somewhere in the middle.
Even if you’re an expert, the minute you start spending time away from this 
thing and doing something else, you don’t use it for a while, you regress 
back into being an intermediate. That’s where your main design efforts 
should be.

He’s got so many great things in there, but that is a guiding principle I 
always think of. Making the interface humane, such that yes, your users are 
smart, but no, they’re not always paying attention. They’re not always ready 
to commit X part of their life to this random application. Maybe they have 
children, or they have so many more important things in the grand scheme 
of things.
You need to be OK with that. Sometimes you have to let some decisions that 
you like go. I don’t know what a good example is, but sometimes, you want 
to make this whole thing a little bit more aesthetically pleasing, so you’re 
going to remove the text and just have this icon that’s abstract there.
It’ll probably work fine, and people will try it out. They’ll figure out what it 
does. The other option is, don’t do that. It may be a little bit more on the 
interface, but it’s perfectly clear; they don’t have to think about it. They 
don’t have to wonder what’s going on. You don’t have to give them that 
feeling of them not being good at using this interface by just putting this 
label there, and letting them [flounder].
There’s a fine line, I guess, between not patronizing someone, but also real-
izing that they’re not necessarily a student of interfaces, or interested in 
learning at all. Because they just want to get X thing done before they move 
on with their life.
The thing to focus on is that 100 percent of your users are humans. While 
technology is changing really, really rapidly, human motivations basically 
haven’t at all. Like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, that’s still the same.
Designing around that, the closer you are to the base level of what humans 
desire, the more timeless it’ll be. This idea of immediate feedback of some 
sort with tactility and the idea of affordance where something, while look-
ing at it, it tells you what it does, that’s so basic that the better it is at doing 
that, the longer it’ll last.
I love that quote: the more you focus on human desire, the more timeless 
it’ll be.
The closer [your product] is to that, fulfilling some sort of basic human 
need, the longer it’ll last. And it’s funny, because you see the same design 
thing happening over and over again in each new technology.

The temperature in the room instantly increased. His colleagues 
jumped up from their desks and crowded around him.
“Hot damn!”
“Don’t screw with us.” 
“You sure you ran it right?”
The engineer nodded his head with a smile. “Checked it three times.”
The project manager called a company meeting. There was cause for 
celebration, and the word had to get out.

“When engineers measure the speed of a PC, they talk about some­
thing called the Doherty threshold of system response time,” he said 
to the crowded office. “When you ask your computer to do something 
and hit the Enter key, if it answers you back in less than 400 milli­
seconds—just under half a second—then you will stay glued to that 
machine for hours. Your eyes may glaze over, but your productivity 
will soar. Even a slight deviation back to half-second response time 
will allow your attention to stray. But under 400 milliseconds, that’s 
the sweet spot. Well, guess what? Our soon-to-be Cardiff PC, though 
it looks ragtag now, just clocked in at 396 milliseconds. Once assem­
bled, it will not only be faster than all the other PCs on the market, it 
will also be addictive.”
I paused the fourth episode of Halt and Catch Fire and looked up from 
my Netflix stream. The “Doherty threshold”? Is this a thing? I thought. 
It’s probably something made up for the show.
I was wrong. 
The Doherty threshold has its origins in the IBM Systems Journal 
paper “The Economic Value of Rapid Response Time” written by 
Walter J. Doherty and Ahrvind J. Thadani. Published in 1982, “it was 
thought that a relatively slow response, up to two seconds, was accept­
able because the person was thinking about the next task. Research on 
rapid response time now indicates that this earlier theory is not borne 
out by the facts: productivity increases in more than direct proportion 
to a decrease in response time.”*
Doherty and Thadani’s research had a significant practical finding: 
the requirement for computer response time was decreased to 400 
milliseconds from 2 seconds, which had been the previous standard 
(Figure 7-1). 
The old standard was created in 1968 by Robert B. Miller, who worked 
in IBM’s Poughkeepsie laboratory.† He believed that two seconds was 
more than enough time for a system response because “users were 
thinking as rapidly as they could, uninfluenced by how long the sys­
tem took to respond.”‡

Wow. Imagine waiting two seconds to get a response for an input.
But Doherty and Thadani disproved that. Humans can hold a series 
of short-term tasks in their head and are more productive when they 
aren’t hindered by an external delay. Attention spans are preserved on 
a rotating basis and focus lasts longer. The net result is higher pro­
ductivity, less time spent working, and a substantial amount of money 
saved. And, in the end, the product would be given the credit.
This is one of the most fascinating examples I’ve seen about how the 
speed of a product—or even the perception of its speed—can signifi­
cantly affect us whether we know it or not. 
Your product’s psychology, like speed or response time, is highly 
dependent on context—how, where, and when a customer is using 
your product. For example, 400 milliseconds is a terrible response 
time for touch-based interfaces in specific contexts like drawing or 
painting. Even a 400 percent improvement down to a 100-millisecond 
response time is a bad experience.

We know this from a Microsoft Applied Sciences Group research study 
on touch interface latency. With an in-house device, researchers were 
able to get touch latency down to 1 ms! At that speed, the touch response 
was indistinguishable from pen and paper (Figure 7-2).*
But speed can affect us a whole lot more than someone drawing on 
their tablet. 
Google and Shopzilla are companies that have large enough footprints 
to test these things at scale. 
And wow. Humans are really susceptible to latency.

When Marissa Mayer was at Google, for example, she asked the com­
pany’s users how many search results they wanted to see per page per 
query. Did they want 10 results per page? 20? 25? 30? The responses to 
the survey culminated into a “more is better” mentality. 
But guess what? After they ran A/B tests on the user segments, “the 
number of Google searches seen from the users that were in the exper­
iment dropped by 20 percent,” Mayer said at a talk in 2010.† “When we 
gave users 30 results per page, they actually searched 1/5 less.” What 
was even more startling was that usage on the first page also dropped 
20 percent (Figure 7-3)!

The team was flummoxed. Was it a “paradox of choice” problem? Were 
people simply being overwhelmed with information? 
After poring through the logs, Mayer discovered that it “takes us lon­
ger to produce 30 results than 10 results—about twice as long. [This] 
latency drove this decline. Users really care about speed, and respond 
to speed. We know as the Web gets faster, people search more. And as 
it gets slower, people search less.”
The team found the same effect on Maps—in this case, when the size 
of the page was reduced by 30 percent. In return, they got 30 percent 
more Maps requests! “If you make a product faster, you get that back 
in terms of increased usage almost right away.”
Speed even makes us buy more stuff. Shopzilla redesigned their 
pages and infrastructure over the course of a year, and the result of a 
five-second speed increase on page performance (from seven seconds 
to two) resulted in crazy numbers (Figure 7-4).* It increased revenue 7 
to 12 percent and pageviews by 25 percent.†
So if our brains are so sensitive to things like the responsiveness—or 
the lack thereof—of a product, to what else are we susceptible? And 
what should we as product designers be doing about these factors?

Transitions and animations. A personality. Positive reinforcement for 
the key actions of your product. Feedback loops that are thought out. 
A lack of psychological—or even physical—friction. Heck, even sound.
But these attributes are only modifiers for the underlying value of the 
product. If the product doesn’t deliver on the promise to the customer 
that it’s going to solve their problems—well, that’s like going to see an 
action movie that’s completely unentertaining. 
This is how Jonathan Badeen, cofounder and vice president of prod­
uct at Tinder, approached the creation of the dating app. He’s also the 
inventor of the swipe right. Yes, that swipe right. “You have to be solv­
ing a problem,” he said in our interview. “That problem might be as 
simple as alleviating boredom, but it might be as important as finding 
a soulmate. But from more of a design, animation, and interaction 
standpoint, I think it’s important to simply sweat the details. Insist 
that things work in a way that feels natural to the user.”
We’re all human and we’re not immune to the effect of these details 
and the emotions that they surface. So how can your products tap into 
that emotion? How can emotion be used to create powerful feedback 
loops that draw your customers into the experience, and keep them 
coming back for more?
Let’s examine these factors now.
Loops
Product loops are ways to get your customers to use a specific flow in 
your product. Back in Chapter 4, I defined user flows as the way some­
one moves through your product to complete a specific task. 
In almost all cases in product design, there are specific flows you’ll 
want your customer to take at certain times. That’s where loops come 
in. 
I was at a friend’s wedding on a remote island off the coast of North 
Carolina, and I inadvertently stumbled upon one of the best loops I’ve 
ever seen. The difference was that it was in real life (Figure 7-5).

Setting up furniture in a banquet hall for over a hundred people is 
grunt work. And the last thing anybody wants to do after a night of cel­

you found it. 
So the organizers of the banquet hall made it easy. They gave us a tem­
plate to follow, essentially a paint-by-numbers furniture storage guide. 
And, I tell you what, we cleaned that room up in record time. I’m also 
proud to say that the closet looked exactly like that photo when we were

 The Psychology of an Experience   |  193
For product loops to be effective, they need to incorporate a number of 
psychological factors. Is it inviting a desirable experience? Is it novel or 
new? Is it appearing at the correct time? 
But these are just traits of a successful loop. For a loop to truly be effec­
tive, it needs to take root in your customer’s mind that it’s worth pur­
suing because it has payoff. 
In other words, successful loops take root in the human mind, effec­
tively incurring some behavioral change. 
And loops don’t just happen inside of your product. Some of the most 
effective loops we’ll see happen outside of the product, with the inten­
tion of getting a customer to engage with a specific user flow inside of 
the product. In other words, loops can also be used for activation and 
retention.
Dr. BJ Fogg, who founded the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford 
University, is an expert on using technology to change behaviors in 
positive ways. He’s also the author of Persuasive Technology: Using 
Computers to Change What We Think and Do.
Fogg invented the “Fogg Behavioral Model” (Figure 7-6) to help design­
ers identify what stops people from performing behaviors that design­
ers seek.* For example, if users are not performing a target behavior, 
such as rating hotels on a travel website, the FBM helps designers see 
what psychological element is lacking.

Model showing that 
motivation, ability, and

194  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
The model shows that three factors must be present at a single moment 
for a behavior to occur: motivation, ability, and a proper trigger. If the 
behavior doesn’t happen, it means that one of the factors is missing. 
“If you plant the right seed in the right spot, it will grow without fur­
ther coaxing,” Fogg wrote in an email. “I believe this is the best meta­
phor for creating habits.”
Fogg’s shorthand for this is B = mat. 
Motivators (Figure 7-7) are defined in three buckets: sensation (plea­
sure, pain), anticipation (hope, fear), and belonging (social rejection, 
social acceptance).*
Many products try to train or educate people into changing their abil­
ity levels to perform an action. But the fact is that we’re human, and 
that means that we’re lazy. 
“Don’t take this route unless you really must,” Fogg writes. “Training 
people is hard work, and most people resist learning new things.”
Instead, the Behavior Model advocates making the target behavior eas­
ier to perform. Fogg, in fact, sometimes replaces ability with simplicity 
because “in practice Simplicity is what persuasion designers should 
seek.”† In other words, when we make a behavior simpler to perform, 
the ability of the person increases—the hurdles to completion are eas­
ier to overcome.

The final piece of the Behavior Model is the right trigger to get some­
one to perform a desired behavior. The goal of the trigger is to also 
be simple in its presentation—gently facilitating a customer’s pro­
gression through a sequence of events as they gradually perform the 
desired behavior.

This is a great example of placing the right seed at the right time. The 
seed compels me to dip my toe into the chain of intended behaviors 
that the LinkedIn designers have for me—joining a group, then com­
menting, then getting into a discussion, then posting stories myself. 
“The ‘right seed’ is the tiny behavior that you choose. The ‘right spot’ 
is the sequencing—what it comes after,” Fogg writes. “The ‘coaxing’ 
part is amping up motivation, which I think has nothing to do with 
creating habits. In fact, focusing on motivation as the key to habits is 
exactly wrong.
“Let me be more explicit: If you pick the right small behavior and 
sequence it right, then you won’t have to motivate yourself to have it 
grow. It will just happen naturally, like a good seed planted in a good 
spot. (Unfortunately, this is also the process for bad habits—they start 
tiny.)”*
Let’s look at some other loops. 
ADDITIVE ACTIONS
There will be many occasions that require us as product designers 
to introduce something new to our customers. (Remember Clippy? 
See Figure 7-10.) The challenge is twofold: notifying the customer at 
the correct time, and demonstrating enough value or interest in the 
moment to encourage use.

When Apple Music launched, for example, the product introduced 
a rating system to help their underlying algorithms determine what 
music to recommend. The product designers at Apple extended a 
“love” system across not only radio tracks, but tracks in a customer’s 
current music library as well. 
After tapping the “love” icon, I was presented with a dialog confirming 
the action while succinctly explaining the value of what I’d just done 
(Figure 7-11).

On the surface, the feature seems great. It’s low friction—it’s very sim­
ple. It has a potentially huge payoff—I am always listening to music 
attuned to my tastes. And it’ll be forever cemented in the back of my 
mind that I should tap the icon if I like (sorry, love) a song, so I can 
continue to enjoy the benefits of that payoff. 
But the problem with this loop lies in the trigger itself. I had to tap the 
icon of my own volition. There was no invitation to use it and no indi­
cation of its significance.

A better path would be to log how many times I listen to a particular 
track. On, say, the third or fourth play, pop a subtle toast recognizing 
that I “love” this song, and suggesting that I tap the heart to indicate 
that. Imagine the copy:
This is the third time you’ve played this song. You must love it. 
Why not tap the heart? With just one tap, you’ll start hearing 
more tracks exactly like this one.
This would check all the boxes—I’m motivated to hear new music, I 
have the ability because I’m actively listening (since I’ve sought out the 
track), and there’s a simple path for me to “love” the song. 
There are some real-world examples of this pattern at play. 
Take Snapchat, for example (Figure 7-12). Anybody moving through 
the snapping and sending flow would be invited to “Add to Your Story” 
upon hitting the publish arrow in the lower-righthand corner.
Anybody moving through this flow is in the mindset of getting their 
Snap published—so, why not just tap the “Add and Don’t Show Again” 
button? After all, Snapchat succinctly pitches me on the value of the 
feature (“allows your friends to view your Snap an unlimited number 
of times for 24 hours”) and also reassures me that this can be changed 
(“You can change who can view your Story in Settings”). 
The payoff of this little dialog has been huge. Stories now account for 
more views than popular national TV shows.*

Both Apple and Twitter employed similar techniques for publishing-​
related features. When Twitter launched Video, for example, they told 
their users with an unobtrusive tool tip in the Compose view (Figure

When Apple upgraded their emoji to have more skin tone variations, 
they took a more aggressive (albeit more educational approach). Upon 
tapping into the emoji keyboard and onto a variation-enabled icon, I 
was greeted with a full-keyboard takeover that required tapping “OK” 
to dismiss (Figure 7-14).

The benefit of this was that 1) I was going to use the icon anyway, 2) it 
demonstrates how to select multiple skin tones, and 3) it only requires 
one extra tap. Even if I don’t read the text, I can tell by the interface ele­
ment how to use the feature.
GIVING VALUE, THEN ASKING FOR FEEDBACK
For products like Uber, Instacart, and DoorDash to be successful, they 
need to cultivate an ecosystem of constant feedback. Is my food going 
to be delivered on time? Where is my car? Was the order correct? 
Perfecting these loops is a vital exercise in enacting living versions of 
the Fogg Behavior Model. How do you communicate progress? When 
do you ask for feedback on the completed order? What do you do if the 
transaction was imperfect? 
The other challenge is that human memory is complex. Chances are 
that you can’t recall the last Uber ride you took, or how quickly your 
chicken was delivered. All you know is that it happened, or it didn’t. 
And that’s why the timing and friction of these loops is so important. 
The key is that the product’s customers expect to be receiving some 
sort of value, and thus they’re more willing to provide necessary feed­
back—especially if something goes wrong. 
I use Instacart frequently for home grocery delivery. The product 
makes heavy use of text messages to keep me informed, and to notify 
me of problems. 
FIGURE 7-14

variations.

204  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
I’m glued to these text messages until I receive my groceries, and, after 
that, I don’t really care about them. I’m invested until I get my payoff. 
Instacart knows this and informs me of order changes by text and by 
phone call, and confirms via text message when the order changes 
have been made. 
Once the order is out for delivery, I’m also informed. I can even watch 
the driver approach my apartment in real time. 
Here’s the part of the loop that interests me most: once the driver 
marks the order as delivered, there’s a very slight time delay until 
I’m asked for feedback. Instacart has built in a grace period for me 
to unpack the groceries, put them in the refrigerator or pantry, and 
review everything that was delivered. 
That takes about 5 to 10 minutes. And that’s when Instacart asks me to 
review the order (Figure 7-15). 
This feedback loop enriches Instacart’s ecosystem and hits me right 
at the moment I’m thinking about an action, providing a chance for 
the product to save me from a poor experience. It increases my trust in 
the product—and does it in a way that’s practically frictionless. I don’t 
have to open the app; I respond to a text message. I don’t have to type 
more than one number; a 1 through 5 will do.

Uber employs a similar model to collect driver ratings (Figure 7-16). 
The app blocks any other action than a rating once a ride has ended 
and the app is backgrounded. My only critique with this loop is that 
it has a tendency to hit you at the wrong time—my mindset is calling 
a new ride, not thinking about my old one. And who’s to say that this 
new ride occurs soon after my old one? It could be hours, the next day, 
or the next week. This risks skewed ratings. 
DoorDash, a product that specializes in enabling deliveries from 
restaurants that don’t typically deliver, has combined these two exam­
ple loops into a superior experience. 
The product caters to my combined hunger and laziness by providing 
cues for every step of the food delivery process (Figure 7-17). 
FIGURE 7-16

interface blocks any

the next ride.

 The Psychology of an Experience   |  207
These cues are driven by both push notifications and within the app—
and, I have to say, I am glued to them. 
My favorite notification is the one that tells me the driver is approach­
ing my location. It builds anticipation, and has the side effect of get­
ting me ready to meet the driver. This saves both myself and the driver 
time—I want my food, now, and the driver wants to get on with his 
other deliveries. 
And, just like Instacart, the app asks me how the delivery went slightly 
after I’m handed the glorious bag of food. 
FIGURE 7-17
DoorDash updates

every step of the way.

208  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
But here’s where DoorDash differs—they’ve trained me to always 
respond with that rating. Because after I provide feedback on the 
order, they inevitably offer a coupon code ranging from $2 to $7 off of 
my order. And the best part? I have to use it within a few days. 
This is an incredible loop. It’s one that takes me from an order through 
the creation and pickup process, builds anticipation for the delivery, 
encourages me to give order feedback, and, ultimately, makes me want 
to do it all over again. 
VARIABLE REWARDS 
Variable rewards, or variable-ratio schedules as they’re known in psy­
chology circles, are the most powerful reward system known. They’re 
a type of behavioral conditioning that “creates the greatest response to 
the stimulus, the quickest rate of learning the connection between the 
reward and the stimulus, and is the least resistant to extinction when 
the reward is no longer paired with the stimulus.”*
In other words, positive reinforcement is received after a seemingly 
unpredictable number of actions by the user. It causes the user to con­
tinue usage until receiving positive reinforcement again. 
The timeless example of a variable-ratio schedule in action is the slot 
machine. The user puts the money into the machine, pulls the lever, 
and may or may not win money. Winning money is simply based upon 
the number of times the lever is pulled. 
I sat down with my colleague Jonathan Badeen, cofounder and vice 
president of product at Tinder. As mentioned earlier, he invented the 
swipe right (and left), bringing a game-like experience to finding peo­
ple to meet. 
“While I found my psychology courses in college to be enlightening, 
I’d never purport to be an expert,” Badeen said in our interview. “With 
Tinder, we were very focused on motivation. We discussed the impor­
tance of variable reward schedules. We also knew the sort of weight 
that introducing yourself to others could carry with it. Putting yourself 
out there can be scary and intimidating. For this reason we went in the 
opposite direction for design and interaction. I can only take a small 
portion of the credit for this, but everything was designed to feel light-
hearted, fun, and playful.”

Tinder is one of the most addictive experiences, period, with an esti­
mated 50 million people using the product to meet up, date, marry, 
and more. Since the swiping gesture is so easy and natural to perform, 
it encourages quick feedback on someone’s profile. 
But that’s not what keeps people swiping. It’s the gambling-like 
reward, that dopamine rush of the “It’s a Match” screen that descends 
upon you without your knowledge (Figure 7-18).
FIGURE 7-18
The “It’s a Match” 
experience on Tinder is 
a variable reward that 
encourages continued 
swiping to experience 
this again, or to 
message the person 
that sent a positive 
signal of reinforcement.

“I’ve always felt that software should not only perform a task effi­
ciently, but it should be delightful,” Badeen said. “Many lose sight of 
this, especially when they aren’t creating consumer products. Every 
app has a consumer, though, and every bit of fun you can add to an app 
makes their day a little bit better, a little more fun. With Tinder, it’s 
been especially fun to make fun. Because we’ve wanted to keep things 
lighthearted we took inspiration from games.”
Not only does the “It’s a Match” experience give you a bit of a rush, it 
also provides self-reinforcement in the context of a place where peo­
ple meet. “It’s a Match” indicates a signal on the other end of the 
line, encouraging you to message the person—or to keep swiping for 
another rush. 
Products can also make these sorts of connections with their custom­
ers by using unexpected channels, turning what could be a typical or 
negative experience into something extraordinary. 
“I feel more connected with Warby Parker than any other company in 
the world,” said Kurt Varner, product designer at startup Shyp, in our 
interview. “When I bought [my] glasses from them, they sent me a 
YouTube video of someone personally thanking me for my purchase. It 
was a 30-second video. So simple. But they took the time to thank me. 
Every single interaction I’ve had with that company, whether it’s call­
ing to complain about something, or whatever, it has been an amazing 
experience, and I feel emotionally connected to that company.”
I had a similar experience with Ryan Hoover’s Product Hunt. After 
posting some of my own products there, the team sent me a handwrit­
ten note thanking me for sharing my work (Figure 7-19). “Thanks so 
much for building cool stuff and sharing it with our community.” 
And they even sent me “meowvelous” stickers to share with my team. 
I barely remember giving them my address, and they sure didn’t abuse 
it. But I can’t remember the last time I was sent a personal, handwrit­
ten note from a team for using their product—especially one where I 
haven’t paid them any money (yet).

Multiple studies over the years have confirmed that aesthetics play an 
important role in shaping responses to products,* drawing on “aes­
thetic factors to judge usability and credibility.”† A study by Frank 
Spillers, a usability consultant and user-centered design specialist with 
Experience Dynamics, went so far as to suggest that product design 
providing “aesthetic appeal, pleasure and satisfaction can greatly influ­
ence the success of a product.”‡ 
That’s because “attractive interfaces with high aesthetic qualities” 
arouse “attention, are easier to learn, produce more harmonious results 
and work better.”§ Pleasant aesthetics stimulate the pleasure centers 
in our brain, creating emotions that “govern the quality of interac­
tion with a product in the user’s environment and relate directly to 
appraisal of the user experience. Users generate emotion as a way to 
minimize errors, interpret functionality, or obtain relief from the com­
plexity of a task.” 
In other words, the right aesthetics in the right product can make us 
feel good in the context of the product’s experience—whether that’s 
feeling secure, cute, or desired ourselves. The aesthetics and the per­
sonality of your product go hand-in-hand. 
An extreme example of aesthetics and personality blending together to 
create an emotional connection is the Cockney Cash Machine found in 
East London (Figure 7-21).

This ATM looks like every other ATM, reflects the history and customs 
of the locale, and does it while fulfilling its purpose—giving cash to 
people who need it. And, on top of that, the bank succeeds in creating 
a conversation piece that’ll spread via word of mouth. 
“On our cash machines in Wales less than 1% of people opt for the 
Welsh language, whereas between 15–20% opt for Cockney when 
given the chance,” said Ron Delnevo at the ATM’s parent, the Bank 
Machine Company.*

“Ultimately, you need to deliver on what will make your target audience 
the happiest and feel a connection to [your product], so that you start 
to build a relationship,” said product design veteran Jeffrey Kalmikoff 
in our interview. “So it’s not just a fleeting one-time thing. Buying 
the one pair of jeans from the one random brand that you’ll never buy 
from ever again is the same thing as downloading an app and using it 
once and never opening it up again.”
That’s the key factor at play here—first having a product that you know 
solves a problem—then doing the work to create a memorable experi­
ence that makes a human connection. 
“You have to find the mood for your app or service,” said Jonathan 
Badeen in our interview. “The animation and interactions should 
match those. If you are attempting to impose a sense of fun, then 
spring animations are probably your best friend. If it’s elegance, style, 
and luxury you are aiming for, then you’re going to lean more toward 
smooth fades and lots of easing animations. Something meant to be 
very utilitarian might be better served by animations that get right to 
the point: linear and simple (how boring, though).”
We’ll discuss animations and motion more in depth in the next sec­
tion, but Badeen reinforces the point that deciding a product’s mood is 
a very deliberate process:
Not all animations should be endearing. For instance, an appli­
cation focused on home security might not be well served by “fun” 
and “endearing” animations. Security is serious business. You 
want your application to pervade that mentality. You might be 
better served by more mechanical and deliberate animations.
Josh Brewer, former Twitter principal designer, expounded on a simi­
lar theme in our interview:
I think playfulness is super important. But I think it totally 
depends. If you’re building, I don’t know, the UI for an air traffic 
controller, I don’t know how much playfulness you need to put in 
there. But there are a few different ways something can be play­
ful or delightful simply by behaving the way that you expect it to 
behave.
www.it-ebooks.info

216  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Brewer focuses on experiences that anticipate a user’s behavior in the 
context of his products. 
“It’s [the experience] I try to focus on more,” he said. “Because some 
of the other things can be playful, but they get gimmicky or kitschy, 
and so I tend to fall more towards the ‘hey, let me just meet you there 
and be a step ahead of you’ so that when you take that step forward, 
you were like ‘wow, you were there holding my hand the whole way.’”
Let’s look at four products on the market and see if we can determine 
what their designers set out to achieve: Airbnb, Tinder, USAA Bank, 
and Uber.
AIRBNB
Airbnb—the worldwide community of people that open up their homes 
for others to rent—is designed with a sense of warmth (Figure 7-22). 
Its secondary goal is to foster trust, “tapping into the universal human 
yearning to belong—the desire to feel welcomed, respected, and appre­
ciated for who you are, no matter where you might be. Belonging is the 
idea that defines Airbnb, but the way we’ve represented Airbnb to the 
world until now hasn’t fully captured this.”*
From the typography (the font is called “LL Circular,” by the way)—a 
geometric, easy-to-read, and, in my opinion, classy font—to the gener­
ous whitespace and full-bleed use of high-quality images, Airbnb puts 
the focus on the space and the people offering it. Soothing colors, fat 
and appealing tap targets, and clear calls-to-action all come together to 
make this an extremely appealing experience.

TINDER
Products meant to facilitate connections between people—whether it 
be romantic or otherwise—risk hurting people’s feelings and souring 
their perception of the product. Tinder attacked this problem head-on 
by approaching the primary experience as a game (Figure 7-23). By 
doing so, they invoked feelings of playfulness and reward.

“Humans, like any curious animal, enjoy manipulating their environ­
ment,” Badeen said in our interview. “They want things to bend to 
their will. There is emotion in the way that we handle objects. Think of 
the losing card player who angrily throws down their cards compared 
to the winner carefully splaying out their cards while taunting ‘read 
them and weep’ with pride. I try to add physicality to interactions that 
provide the same sense of physical manipulation that we are used to 
in the physical world. Touch screens make this a lot easier than ever 
before.”
This physicality, combined with the bright, almost-primary colors and 
large “game” buttons, reduced the cognitive overhead of meeting peo­
ple. It keeps the customer moving through the card deck, taking their 
mind off of the fact that the person on the other end may not have 
“liked” them. The playfulness increases the usage velocity and tones 
down the seriousness level. 
But when there’s a match, the customer experiences the event like a 
reward. 
USAA BANK
USAA Bank started off as a bank exclusively for U.S. military members 
and their families. In recent years, the bank’s opened its doors to the 
general public and, in doing so, made Fortune’s 2015 Most Admired 
list at number 28. “It launched a mobile app that allows members to 
file insurance claims that include video and audio to show the dam­
age. It also was the first bank to offer facial and voice recognition tech­
nology for logging into its mobile banking app.”*
Being a bank, USAA needs to imbue a sense of trust. But USAA’s also 
got a unique history with its association with the U.S. military. USAA 
blends these two worlds with hard corners, the use of blues, red, and 
white, and no-nonsense navigation (Figure 7-24). The customer is left 
with an experience that constantly reminds them of the military val­
ues of service, honor, and valor.

EAT24
This food delivery product—beyond the typical red color seemingly 
associated with all food-related apps—infuses a sense of directness 
and humor that helps it stand out from the pack. It does this primarily 
through copywriting and storytelling—for example, in its weekly mar­
keting email where it includes a coupon code for $2 off.
While a coupon email could simply include a code in a huge font with 
a link to the app, Eat24 tells timely stories to catch your attention, like

“I’ve always felt that software should not only perform a task effi­
ciently, but it should be delightful,” Tinder’s Badeen said in our inter­
view. “Many lose sight of this, especially when they aren’t creating con­
sumer products. Every app has a consumer, though, and every bit of 
fun you can add to an app makes their day a little bit better, a little 
more fun.”
Speaking of ease of use, let’s segue into discussing animation and 
motion, and how they can significantly affect engagement and 
understanding.
Animation and Motion
The states of a user interface work together to communicate to your 
customer what they should be doing next, what their expectations 
should be at a given moment, and how they should be using a screen 
at any given time. 
But how do you effectively travel between each state? How do you com­
municate what’s happening without displaying each event like some 
logfile?
I’ll give you a hint: the answer lies in motion.
Motion is humanizing. It’s a reflection of how the real world operates. 
But, more specifically to our realm as product designers, if we assume 
that the world moves in 60 fps, “there’s 58 frames you need to design 
between Mock A and Mock B,” as Paul Stamatiou of Twitter reminds 
us.*
Josh Brewer, formerly of Twitter, echoes this notion. “As a product 
designer, you’re responsible for every one of those moments in between 
every one of those screens just as much as those screens themselves,” 
he said in our interview. Brewer calls this the “in-between states.” 
We’re nearing a time in product design where creating mockups or 
stripped-down prototypes isn’t going to be good enough. We have to 
be the arbiters of motion, interjecting it into transitions and personality-​
infusing animations that make their way into the products we build. 
Because motion is more than cute; it’s functional. It accounts for the 
passage of time, and helps your customer follow what happens after 
they take an action. Even better, you communicate in a visual way how 
they got from point A to point B. 
*	  http://paulstamatiou.com/design-provide-meaning-with-motion/
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Psychology of an Experience   |  225
After all, we live in a world of motion. Motion is the story of how things 
exist, how they move, how they go from one place to another.
“Animations tell a story,” said Jonathan Badeen of Tinder in our inter­
view. “That story might be why and how an element appeared or disap­
peared or how you got from one screen to another. Stories at their core 
stir up emotion, so I believe trying to tell a good story will automati­
cally do this. Each story has an assortment of actors and we like to be 
introduced and we want to know what happens to them. Thinking this 
way about the elements on your screen helps to transition elements 
in and out as well as the transition between screens. When it makes 
sense I try to incorporate an actor between scenes. In Tinder this is 
most easily visible in our transitions between the card stack and the 
profile, where we attempt to make the card at least partially transform 
into the profile (Figure 7-28). The photo transitioning hopefully lets 
the user know that if they perform the same tap action on the photo to 
open the profile, it might do the reverse and close the profile.”

Tinder’s open and close animation on the profile card transforms the photo 
on the card into the full-bleed profile, communicating that the two views are 
connected by a single tap.

Check out this example from Pasquale D’Silva of Elepath, from an 
insanely excellent piece called “Transitional Interfaces” (Figure 7-29).
FIGURE 7-29
Pasquale D’Silva of Elepath illustrates how animation can mimic real life, and 
help one understand what’s happening better onscreen.
D’Silva shows us how “for a new item to be added, the list needs to 
make room for the item, and then the new item (which came from 
somewhere) fills in the space. Much less jarring. There’s easing in & 
out of states to soften the change. It feels more natural, because we 
have the contextual hook of space — mirroring the way you’d add some­
thing to a stack of things in real life!”*
It’s simple, really. Mimicking real life helps our brains better under­
stand what’s happening. It’s an “illusion of life.”

This just so happens to be the title of the greatest book on animation 
of all time: The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation, published in 1981 by 
Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas.†
These two guys are legends. Thomas joined Disney in 1934 and 
Johnston in 1935. They worked with Walt himself and animated char­
acters from Snow White to the Rescuers. 
Their book distilled 50 years of Disney animation into what’s now 
known as the “12 principles of animation.”‡ Painstakingly created out 
of necessity over the course of 23 animated feature films, these prin­
ciples were used to mimic the basic laws of physics. And their goal? 
To express emotional timing and emphasize a character’s personality. 
The result? Believable on-screen motion and characters that seemed 
real and became, as a result, memorable (Figure 7-30). 
FIGURE 7-30
Snow White comes alive with these innocent, cheerful movements.
Motion within product design can accomplish two things for us: mak­
ing our products memorable and more usable. That’s a pretty amazing 
one-two punch. 
Let’s explore a few animation principles and see how they fit into the 
realm of product design.
SLOW IN, SLOW OUT
Johnston and Thomas described the value of replicating lifelike motion 
with the principle of “slow in and slow out,” which is a less computer-​
like term for “ease in and ease out.” When humans move in Earth’s 
gravity, there’s a necessary period of acceleration and deceleration. The 
implication for animation is that there will be more frames near the

starting and ending positions as a result, and fewer frames in the mid­
dle of the animation arc. These extra frames soften the action at the 
beginning and the ending to simulate lifelike movements. 
This principle can be modified to communicate different emotions—
for comedic effect, for example, the slow in or slow out could be short­
ened to create an element of surprise, making the action snappier. 
Check out this real-life example from Skype’s Qik app (Figure 7-31).
FIGURE 7-31
Skype’s Qik app in motion.
This is a great example of giving a user interface component a simu­
lated mass. With this simulated drag comes an understandable heft 
that doesn’t surprise the person using it when the menu appears. We 
know from the motion’s vector, as well, where it originated. 
Also, notice what happens at the end of the menu’s introductory ani­
mation: a slight overlap and retraction. 
This added animation element is called follow through and overlap. It 
was created to reflect the fact that a character can change direction, 
but nothing stops at once. Hair, clothing, arms, even oversized ears 
continue with some inertia in the direction the character was origi­
nally heading. 
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Psychology of an Experience   |  229
In product design, we can use this technique to add a little personality 
while emphasizing the direction from which a UI element originated. 
But, most importantly, we can use it to train our customers to anticipate 
the arrival of a new button or menu over time. 
I love how Keezy’s menu uses this principle (Figure 7-32).
FIGURE 7-32
Keezy using “follow through and overlap.”
STAGING
Staging is an animation principle that communicates to the audience 
what’s the most important part of the story in any given scene. In 
explaining this principle, Johnston and Thomas emphasize that films 
have a finite amount of time to communicate what’s worthy of an audi­
ence’s attention. So staging is used as a tool to direct an audience’s 
attention to the main story or idea being conveyed. 
In our world, I interpret this principle in two ways: 
•	 First, get to the point. Don’t spend an excessive amount of time 
animating UI elements into view. In my own experience, any­
thing that’s over .2 seconds feels way too long. 
•	 Second, confine motion to what matters. Distracting a customer 
with too many elements flying into view just detracts from the 
experience.

There’s a great example over at Google’s Material Design guidelines 
under the “Hierarchical timing” header that embodies this principle.* 
Here’s the live example (Figure 7-33).

 The Psychology of an Experience   |  231
This is a great example of how motion can be used as a tool to empha­
size what the most important elements on the screen are. Secondary 
and tertiary options reside on the screen, but are brought in later. Your 
eye is already resting on what the animation determines will be the 
most actionable item in the grid. 
Motion in products is a pretty damn exciting prospect. I think what 
makes it more exciting than it should be is the state of our tools—even 
with Quartz Composer, Framer.js, InVision, or Keynote, it’s still a dif­
ficult path (no pun intended) to create wholly original animations and 
transitions that support the purpose of your product. 
In other words, it’s still difficult to create original animations that 
don’t interfere with your product’s flows. That’s why sticking to the 12 
principles of animation can reduce your time spent in trial and error 
and can instead focus your efforts on the motion that matters. 
“I think it’s important to simply sweat the details. Insist that things 
work in a way that feels natural to the user,” says Tinder’s Badeen. “The 
past couple years, like many others, I’ve been referencing Disney’s 12 
principles of animation. I don’t pretend to be an expert, but it’s a great 
thing to keep in the back of your mind as you animate and design 
interactions. It doesn’t hurt that I love Disney.”
Shareable Notes
•	 We’re all human and we’re not immune to the effect of speed, 
behavioral triggers, aesthetics, personality, and motion. The best 
products nail the problem they set out to solve for their customers, 
then laid these traits on top to make flow-inducing and memora­
ble experiences.
•	 Speed and responsiveness have significant effects on product 
usage, but required response times are highly dependent upon 
context. Acceptable response times differ from desktop to mobile 
to wearable, and from console-driven to touch-driven interfaces.
•	 In almost all cases in product design, there are specific flows 
you’ll want your customer to take at certain times. That’s where 
loops come in. For a loop to truly be effective, it needs to take root 
in your customer’s mind that it’s worth pursuing because it has 
payoff. 
www.it-ebooks.info

232  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
•	 Aesthetics and personality are tightly interlinked, and take into 
account the audience for your product. When you nail these traits, 
they can build trust, increase loyalty, and make your products eas­
ier to use. 
•	 Motion is humanizing. It’s a reflection of how the real world oper­
ates. As a product designer, you’re responsible for every one of 
your product’s screens, as well as what’s in between them.
Do This Now
•	 Make speed work for you. Ensure that your product is responsive 
in key areas, and reference Chapter 6 for help with friendly load­
ing states.
•	 Audit your product’s loops. Are they taking into account the Fogg 
Behavioral Model? If not, what pieces—motivation, ability, or trig­
gers—are you missing? 
•	 Ensure that your product’s aesthetic and copywriting choices 
reflect your audience. 
•	 Study up on the 12 principles of animation and, if you can, score a 
copy of the book The Illusion of Life.* 
•	 Visit capptivate.co for animation inspiration (disclaimer: it’s tough 
to judge an animation’s value in isolation; studying in the context 
of the application is a much more productive endeavor). 
•	 Study up on Google’s Material Design animation guidelines. 
There’s a lot of good thinking here. 
•	 Take up a tool like InVision, Origami, or Framer.js so you can start 
crafting your own original animations that serve your product 
and your customers.

Interview: Jonathan Badeen
Jonathan Badeen is the cofounder and senior vice president of product at 
Tinder. The actor-turned-developer-designer helped invent Tinder, its con-
cept of a card stack, and the swipe right. He can be found at http://badeen.
com.
What are some general human/psychological principles that you try and 
weave into your work? 
While I found my psychology courses in college to be enlightening, I’d never 
purport to be an expert. With Tinder, we were very focused on motivation. 
We discussed the importance of variable reward schedules. We also knew 
the sort of weight that introducing yourself to others could carry with it. 
Putting yourself out there can be scary and intimidating. For this reason we 
went in the opposite direction for design and interaction. I can only take a 
small portion of the credit for this, but everything was designed to feel light-
hearted, fun, and playful.
Humans, like any curious animal, enjoy manipulating their environment. 
They want things to bend to their will. There is emotion in the way that we 
handle objects. Think of the losing card player who angrily throws down 
their cards compared to the winner carefully splaying out their cards while 
taunting “read them and weep” with pride. I try to add physicality to inter-
actions that provide the same sense of physical manipulation that we are 
used to in the physical world. Touch screens make this a lot easier than ever 
before.
What have you found that helps to make a design more emotional?
I believe animation and physicality is key to making a design more emo-
tional. It makes the design relatable. Elements that move with your touch 
allow you to connect with the interface on an emotional level that a static 
screen never could. They involve the user.
How do you use motion and animation to build memorable, unique expe-
riences? Is it your goal to make products endearing with animation, or is 
that a byproduct?
Not all animations should be endearing. For instance, an application focused 
on home security might not be well served by “fun” and “endearing” ani-
mations. Security is serious business. You want your application to pervade 
that mentality. You might be better served by more mechanical and delib-
erate animations.
www.it-ebooks.info

234  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
You have to find the mood for your app or service. The animation and inter-
actions should match those. If you are attempting to impose a sense of 
fun, then spring animations are probably your best friend. If it’s elegance, 
style, and luxury you are aiming for, then you’re going to lean more toward 
smooth fades and lots of easing animations. Something meant to be very 
utilitarian might be better served by animations that get right to the point: 
linear and simple (how boring, though).
I think I prefer working in the realm of fun. I’m constantly thinking about 
how to make an element feel a bit more alive. This might require an element 
to move in a slightly unpredictable manner, or it might mean imitating the 
exaggerated physics of children’s cartoons.
Animations tell a story. That story might be why and how an element 
appeared or disappeared or how you got from one screen to another. 
Stories at their core stir up emotion, so I believe trying to tell a good story 
will automatically do this. Each story has an assortment of actors and we 
like to be introduced and we want to know what happens to them. Thinking 
this way about the elements on your screen helps to transition elements 
in and out as well as the transition between screens. When it makes sense 
I try to incorporate an actor between scenes. In Tinder this is most easily 
visible in our transitions between the card stack and the profile, where we 
attempt to make the card at least partially transform into the profile. The 
photo transitioning hopefully lets the user know that if they perform the 
same tap action on the photo to open the profile, it might do the reverse 
and close the profile. 
What are the necessary ingredients that make products addicting and 
magnetic for people? What makes them want to use a product? 
First off, you have to be solving a problem. That problem might be as simple 
as alleviating boredom, but it might be as important as finding a soulmate. 
From more of a design, animation, and interaction standpoint, I think it’s 
important to simply sweat the details. Insist that things work in a way that 
feels natural to the user.
Your designs have an inherently playful quality. What are the inspirations 
for this? 
I’ve always felt that software should not only perform a task efficiently, but 
it should be delightful. Many lose sight of this, especially when they aren’t 
creating consumer products. Every app has a consumer, though, and every 
bit of fun you can add to an app makes their day a little bit better, a little 
more fun.

With Tinder, it’s been especially fun to make fun. Because we’ve wanted to 
keep things lighthearted, we took inspiration from games. The past couple 
years, like many others, I’ve been referencing Disney’s 12 principles of ani-
mation. I don’t pretend to be an expert, but it’s a great thing to keep in the 
back of your mind as you animate and design interactions. It doesn’t hurt 
that I love Disney.
Who are your design heroes? 
Loren Brichter. I’m not sure he’s exactly a designer in the normal sense, but 
he is a god to me. 
Mike Matas. His work at Apple, Push Pop Press, and currently Facebook 
inspires me and makes me feel very inadequate. 
Louie Mantia mainly because of his Disney and geek culture wallpaper 
goodies. 
Bret Victor is not a designer but more of a developer who believes in 
enabling the creative process in software development. His talk “Stop 
Drawing Dead Fish” is pretty inspiring.
Interview: Josh Brewer
Josh Brewer is the founder of Habitat; the former principal designer at 
Twitter; cocreator of 52 Weeks of UX, FFFFallback, and the Shares app; and 
the former director of user experience at Socialcast. He can be found at 
http://jbrewer.me and on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jbrewer.
What are the things you keep in mind when you’re building stuff?
Oh man. Users, users, users. People. That’s probably first and foremost and 
always ever present. When I say “people,” that can mean all kinds of things. 
It can be something small that I’m building and it’s for me and anybody else 
who fits in. FFFFallback (http://ffffallback.com) is a great example [a tool 
by Brewer to test fallback font choices on the Web]. Web fonts were just 
becoming a thing. I’m sitting there realizing “hey, if these don’t load, your 
stuff looks horrible, and it’s not just like ‘oh, stick this in and then there goes 
my normal font stack.’” So it was born really genuinely out of my concern 
that my work was going to look terrible if the web fonts didn’t load and 
come through. So, building a little thing in order to scratch that itch. I was 
thinking about me and all the other designers out there that were about to 
get caught with their pants down, you know, if JavaScript didn’t load.

But you can take Socialcast or Twitter or any of the stuff that I’ve worked 
on, honestly—it’s keeping the users in the forefront of your mind and trying 
to understand at every step. Either anecdotally or if you can with research.
What are the motivations, what are they thinking, how might they want 
to accomplish this, what’s the end objective, task-wise—but then, also, 
what’s the feeling I want to leave them with? I don’t know. For every project 
I’ve worked on, I’d say there’s probably a small subset of principles I work 
against. But I don’t know that any of them are universally “OK, I’m working 
on this project now, check check.”
But working as quickly as possible to get something of a decent fidelity 
so I can put it in front of a few people or even use it myself—I’m a huge 
proponent, and you can ask anybody I work with—they probably would 
agree that you’ve got to build it, like static comps just do not work in this 
era. They don’t communicate enough. There’s too many holes and gaps in 
between all of the states that get left open to interpretation. As a designer, 
and especially as a product designer, you’re responsible for every one of 
those moments in between every one of those screens just as much as 
those screens themselves.
So build it as quickly as you can, because it’s going to change. I guarantee it. 
And until you’re using it, and you’re going to take it outside on your phone 
in the sunlight, or you’re going to sit in a dark room. You’re going to use it 
with one hand and you’re testing it with a thumb or you’re going to sit on 
a laptop on a 27-inch screen or an 11-inch screen. You know what I mean, 
actually using the thing. I find it’s really hard to say I’m done [until I do that].
That’s a good segue because I’d love to know how you work. Can you walk 
me through the process? And I’m sure it’s been different from Socialcast 
to Twitter to your own stuff too.
Yeah, I would definitely say it’s been very different in each of those cases. 
If I were to try to paint an overarching picture, it would look something like 
sitting down to do a lot of just basic requirements. Like what am I working 
with, what kind of data do I have, what do I know about this thing already? 
OK, so let me backpedal. A brand new feature is different from improving an 
existing feature. So a brand new feature that data might not exist for yet—
so, at that point, you’re going to have to start thinking about “what kind of 
data do I need, what kind of things to I need to go talk to engineers about?” 
I try and just understand the technical constraints of what I’m tackling as 
much as I can.
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Psychology of an Experience   |  237
Then, especially at Twitter, working closely with a product manager, or even 
with Mike Davidson, someone to identify what is the problem we’re trying 
to solve.
That is the most important thing. It’s not “we need a new feature” or “we 
need something that will accomplish x.” It’s actually “what problem are we 
solving for these people?” and then asking really hard questions like “OK, 
why is this a problem? “What do we know about this?” “Do we have data 
about this in our logs, do we have things that confirm or deny this, is the 
picture fuzzy?” 
So using all the tools that I’ve got to paint as clear of a picture or at least 
of the pieces that I want to start working with up front. I was super for-
tunate at Twitter. We had an incredible research team, and working with 
those guys has been fantastic. I’ll start making progress on stuff like this—
I’m white-boarding, I’m putting sticky notes up, and just grouping things 
together trying to paint a picture before a pixel ever gets pushed.
One of my favorite things is being able to grab one of the researchers and 
say “Hey, knowing what you know and given what we’ve done research on 
and whatnot, let’s walk through this together” and really being able to push 
it and poke holes in it and spin it around a couple times and look at it from 
different angles. And, at that point, then I begin to start diving into an actual 
solution to the problem. 
I’ll usually sketch; sometimes I’ll jump from sketch to code and just start 
cranking out an HTML prototype. Other times I’ll jump right into Photoshop 
because I know that there’s a certain level of fidelity I need to feel confident 
that this is actually articulating what I want it to articulate.
And even then whenever I’m in Photoshop mode, it’s still getting out of that 
into code as quickly as possible to try and get something going. It’s either 
me—or, if I’m lucky, getting one of the native iOS or Android engineers to 
actually prototype with me. So that we can get something really real and 
native as fast as possible.
From there, it’s a process of refinement. You go in—you bring some other 
people in to sit and work with you, and talk through it and poke holes in and 
review it, and critique it, you know, run it through all of our design princi-
ples, and you know, go back to the drawing board if you need to. Or go and 
subtly refine things and just kind of keep iterating that process until that 
thing seems as tight as possible—until you’ve addressed all the states and 
all of the transitions and the interactions and the way the thing fits within 
the context of the existing system. That’s a broad overarching way that I 
work.
www.it-ebooks.info

238  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Of course, I have to caveat it with “it totally depends.” Sometimes it’s 
Keynote, you know what I mean, and sometimes it’s Photoshop. And some-
times it’s a napkin sketch, and other times it’s really high-fidelity HTML and 
CSS and JavaScript.
It just depends on what the thing is. What the time constraints are, and what 
level of fidelity I need to deliver in order for the rest of the folks to be able 
to move forward.
You mentioned designing the in-between states—the transitions and ani-
mations—and that’s something that I think a lot of people are struggling 
with. How do you personally do that? 
It’s hard. Quartz Composer is like a giant wall. But some things just have a 
learning curve—[Quartz Composer] has a learning wall—and I haven’t got-
ten over it yet. I definitely played with it a bit, and some of the patches that 
people have been putting out recently definitely help a lot. 
I think we’re really fortunate at Twitter that we had a couple guys that were 
pretty good at [Adobe] AfterEffects and motion design. It was something 
that we specifically hired a couple of people for that had proficiency in that, 
so they could really dial in those things. So that when we handed it to the 
engineers, the engineers were like “yes, awesome, I got it done.” And we 
didn’t have the back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and 
back and forth.
But when you can’t do that, I think you fall back into things. I fall back to 
both JavaScript, and trying to use some easing functions and try and dial it 
in as close as I can. 
Or I jump into Keynote and get as close of an approximation as you can get 
it and then you and I go back and forth with the developer to tighten it up. 
But at this point, again, it’s like anything: do whatever you possibly can. But 
I personally feel like the one thing that’s missing more than anything else is 
the motion and interaction component in our design process. And it’s super 
weird, to be totally honest with you, it’s almost like we need Flash—I can’t 
believe I’m saying that. We need something like that that says like “great, 
here’s my stuff and here’s how it needs to move and behave right.”
www.it-ebooks.info

 The Psychology of an Experience   |  239
And if somebody out there is going to be working on this sooner than later, 
then God bless them for it. But I just want to be able to identify components 
and all this stuff and then assign interaction to those components. Who 
knows, it might be that one of these days somebody just basically figures 
out how to do a more simple GUI on top of Xcode. Or Xcode Storyboarding 
gets easier to use or something, I don’t know. I would imagine that Android 
and some of the others coming along will continue to push us into this realm 
of really, really having to own the interactions and the in-between.

Interpreting Feedback and 
“Leveling Up” Your Product
It’s a Creative Journey, After All
One thing that comes out in myths is that at the bottom of the abyss 
comes the voice of salvation. The black moment is the moment when 
the real message of transformation is going to come. At the darkest 
moment comes the light.
—JOSEPH CAMPBELL, THE POWER OF MYTH
Building a product is messy. Just ask game designer Jake Solomon, 
lead designer of the critically acclaimed XCOM: Enemy Unknown.
After growing up obsessed with video games, he turned that fixation 
into a gig with famed game designer Sid Meier at his company Firaxis. 
Meier is the mastermind behind legendary classics like Pirates! and 
the Civilization series. 
Solomon moved up within the ranks quickly, becoming a “trusted 
member of Sid Meier’s team, helping solve complicated problems and 
interfacing between Meier and other members of the staff.” 
There was one game in particular that captured Solomon’s interest 
as a kid: 1994’s XCOM: UFO Defense. And from the earliest days at 
Firaxis, Solomon lobbied the team to make a modern version of 
XCOM. As Polygon reported, he believed so much in the dream that it 
even became a running joke. 
[ 8 ]
www.it-ebooks.info

242  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Yet it paid off, and Solomon got a small team and a few months to 
come up with a prototype for how the new XCOM would work. 
But Solomon screwed it up. Over and over again. For almost half a 
decade.
“Our job is to make a fun XCOM and we’ve completely failed at it,” he 
said in an interview. “It was a really hard moment, because up until 
that point, I had probably not had any real stress. When the feedback 
started coming back, I was thinking, ‘Holy shit. Here I am. I’m the 
designer. I have this vision, and almost unequivocally, everyone thinks 
it’s not fun.’ That’s when, as a designer, you start to think, ‘OK…I have 
no answers.’”
After designing dozens of successful games, Meier knows this phase 
of the development process well. He calls it the “Valley of Despair.”
“You start a project with very high hopes and expectations and visions 
of what the game is going to be and how awesome it’s going to be,” 
Meier said. “Some of those are realized and some of those are not. In 
the middle of the game, not everything works, not everything looks as 
good as it should and you’re a little burnt out. You’ve seen it a hundred 
times. You’re maybe wondering whether you’re the only one that’s hav­
ing fun, the only one that likes this game, the only one that believes 
in it. You have to push through that with a little bit of faith. That’s the 
Valley of Despair.”
The Valley of Despair. We all know that feeling as product designers. 
We all have hit that moment where we think our product won’t work, 
that nobody is going to use it. That’s the fear taking hold—the fear that 
all of your research and work has been wrong. 
But the only way to plow through the Valley is to keep going. 
Sometimes, it’s a return to the basics that can illuminate the path for­
ward. And that’s what Solomon did. After scrapping years of work and 
multiple attempts to get XCOM’s gameplay right, Solomon and Meier 
returned to the most basic, stripped-down form of a game that you 
could get: a board game.
Requisitioning pieces like model tanks and the cards from Risk, Meier 
and Solomon created a prototype XCOM strategy game. They spent 
two weeks playing the homemade strategy game. It helped them to 
refine the rules and solve the most glaring gameplay problems.

“We’d draw the earth and we’d say, ‘OK. Alien invasion strategy game. 
This is how it works,’” Solomon said. “From a very high level, which 
is where you have to start. You have to say, ‘What are the big choices? 
What’s the player doing every turn?’ That can be real time, but there 
are these discrete moments where the players are making choices. 
What are those choices? What is the player weighing? What are they 
doing?”*
XCOM: Enemy Unknown would go on to become an immense success, 
earning a score of 89 from Metacritic and becoming one of the top-​
selling titles of 2013 across PC, Xbox, and Playstation. That’s quite an 
achievement for a non-AAA game title.† 
We see this pattern all throughout creative work. 
Take one of science fiction’s greatest characters, for example: 
Chewbacca from Star Wars. 
The design of the iconic walking carpet didn’t just spring to life from 
the mind of George Lucas or legendary conceptual designer Ralph 
McQuarrie (Figure 8-1). 
“Chewbacca didn’t spring to life out of nowhere, fully formed when 
Lucas saw his dog in the passenger seat of his car,” Heilemann writes. 
“That’s the soundbite. A single step. The reality is complex and human.

From vague names floating around, the kernel of an idea, changing 
purposes and roles of characters, major restructuring, the design hop­
ping from person to person, scrapping the existing concept and going 
down a different path, seeing existing things in a different light and 
having to conform a range of ideas to complement and enrich one 
another… It makes one breathe a sigh of relief; Star Wars wasn’t a mys­
tical, muse-favored event; an all-powerful force of unbridled inspira­
tion. It puts its pants on one leg at a time, just like everyone else.”*
For any creative endeavor—including the act of building a product—
the process is roughly the same (Figure 8-2). It’s a stream of refine­
ment before each release. 
But where does this refinement come from? Feedback or critiques 
from your team, friends, family, outside beta testers, or, hopefully, 
customers?
If so, how do you collect effective feedback? What structures should be 
in place? Who gives the feedback? And how do you know which feed­
back is worthy of leveling up your product? 
We’ll discuss this next.
Leveling Up
We spoke a lot in Chapter 5 about the value of getting your product’s 
ideas into prototype form as quickly as possible. That’s because it 
begins the process of gathering feedback. And we all know that prod­
ucts created in a vacuum—without the oxygen that is feedback —lead 
to, at best, vaporware, and, at worst, complete failures.

 Interpreting Feedback and “Leveling Up” Your Product   |  245
There’s a theory in game design called acceleration flow. It’s a very 
unique state of flow—not unlike a traditional flow state, where you’re 
not thinking about what you’re doing but are acting almost hypnotically. 
The difference between traditional flow and acceleration flow, though, 
is the feeling of accelerated power. Players get caught up in a future 
where they can see their characters becoming more powerful, but the 
catch is that they don’t quite know yet what exactly that’ll look like.
This state is quite prevalent in role-playing games like World of 
Warcraft, Mass Effect, or, my all-time favorite, Knights of the Old Republic 
II (Figure 8-3).
The secret behind the allure of this endless loop is the possibility of 
the acceleration of power. For each piece of gear that a WoW player 
gets from a raid, the game becomes a little bit easier. The bosses 
that drop the next piece of gear fall a little bit faster. Not only is 
the player character getting progressively more powerful with each 
piece of gear, but that gear is helping them to grow more power­
ful, faster. The rate itself at which the player character grows more 
powerful increases. A positive feedback loop is in effect, heading 
toward what the player infers to be a singularity: the point they 
become an ever-growing unstoppable force.†

Acceleration flow follows a specific curve—great strides early on, then 
a long period of gradual growth. At the end, though, there’s an accel­
eration of level-ups as the player approaches the endgame (Figure 8-4). 
Rather, those players are caught up in a future in which their 
character(s) will be powerful in a way they can’t even understand 
yet. To put it more technically, they’re inferring an exponentially 
increasing power structure that vanishes beyond their player pre­
diction horizon.
A product levels up in much the same way. We make great strides early 
on as we’re exploring broad concepts and nailing down what it is we’re 
dealing with. Then, there’s a long process of refinement, and, finally, 
as cumulative feedback rolls in, we shift the product into a state that’s 
even more powerful than we imagined. 
It’s worth mentioning something quickly before we dive into gath­
ering and interpreting different sources of feedback. Feedback can 
be tough. We, as product designers, throw ourselves into our work. 
So don’t take negative feedback personally. Creative work naturally 
reflects the individual that created it, but that doesn’t mean that any 
negativity is directed toward you personally. 
So, with that in mind, there are three potential sources of feedback 
that’ll help to level up your product and get it ready to ship. Feedback 
from:
•	 Your team
•	 Current customers and/or clients
•	 Potential customers and/or clients

Let’s take a deeper look into each source, and discuss effective ways to 
gather and incorporate the feedback you receive.
Team Critiques
There are two variants of team product critiques: the informal, more 
intimate kind, and a larger-scale, more structured variant. 
START WITH WHO HELPED TO DEFINE THE PRODUCT
Way back in Chapter 3, we talked about who was in the room defin­
ing the product you’d end up building. Soliciting face-to-face feedback 
from these individuals on an informal, one-on-one basis is an incred­
ible way to get early feedback and spot problems. Ideally, these people 
are from a number of different teams—product, engineering, mar­
keting, sales, you get it. Get whatever you can in their hands, as early 
as possible. Ask for direct, targeted, actionable feedback. This is why 
getting to a prototype quickly is valuable. And the side effect? These 
individuals feel more invested because their voice is being heard, con­
sidered, and directly affecting the product’s trajectory.
“You bring some other people in to sit and work with you, and talk 
through [the product] and poke holes in and review it, and critique it,” 
Josh Brewer, formerly principal designer at Twitter, said in our inter­
view. “You run it through all of our design principles and you go back 
to the drawing board if you need to—or go and subtly refine things. 
You keep iterating that process until that thing is as tight as possible. 
And after you’ve addressed all the states and all of the transitions and 
the interactions—[you address] how the thing fits within the context 
of the existing system.”
This is a similar concept to a process used at Pixar. Called the Braintrust, 
it’s a “primary delivery system for straight talk. The Braintrust meets 
every few months or so to assess each movie we’re making. Its prem­
ise is simple: Put smart, passionate people in a room together, charge 
them with identifying and solving problems, and encourage them to 
be candid.”*

Pixar’s managed to harness creativity to the tune of a total box office 
run of almost $10 billion worldwide.* That’s 14 movies and 14 ​
number-one box office hits. The Braintrust is a central part of driving 
that creativity to the best possible place, with the right balance of can­
dor and constructive feedback.
People who take on complicated creative projects become lost at 
some point in the process. It is the nature of things—in order to 
create, you must internalize and almost become the project for a 
while, and that near-fusing with the project is an essential part 
of its emergence. But it is also confusing. Where once a movie’s 
writer/director had perspective, he or she loses it. Where once he or 
she could see a forest, now there are only trees.
BREAK DOWN COMPANY SILOS BY OPENING UP DESIGN REVIEWS
“It’s a common practice in design teams to have frequent collective 
reviews of their work,” Benedikt Lehnert of Wunderlist wrote. “Design 
reviews create a space for designers to show and constructively cri­
tique each other’s work throughout the design process with the goal 
to increase the overall quality of the final product. Ultimately, as most 
of you know, the goal of giving feedback to fellow designers is to help 
them succeed with their work.
“So, what happens if you break down the silo and open up the design 
review sessions to your entire company?”†
Structured design reviews are essential for design teams, but they 
risk becoming too insular as time goes on. Lehnert’s innovation at 
Wunderlist is a wonderful template for product designers to stay on 
their toes and face tougher internal feedback. 
As chief design officer, Lehnert created a biweekly “Open Design 
Review” at Wunderlist, where product designers shared what they 
were working on, explained the rationale behind their progress, and 
prepared specific questions to ask the group. 
I love this innovative spin on the design review for a number of reasons:

•	 The Open Design Review creates natural internal checkpoints 
for feedback, and ensures a constant communication to the team 
about progress.
•	 It sets clear expectations for all parties: who needs to be prepared, 
and when, and with what.
•	 Designers can’t hide. If internal opinion is low, this becomes 
obvious through constructive, structured means. It also allows 
the designer to explain the thought process and rationale of every 
decision to see if this affects opinions. 
Lehnert recommends having a facilitator in every session to take notes 
and moderate, and adds that the individuals in the company need to 
make an effort to be thoughtful and customer-focused, and approach 
the feedback from a position that fits within their expertise.
OPEN UP TO A PRIVATE, INTERNAL BETA
“If the team starts building it and everybody’s like, ‘this sucks,’ [that’s 
a warning sign],” said venture investor Josh Elman, a veteran of 
Facebook, LinkedIn, Zazzle, and many more companies. “You trust 
the resonance of the team. But sometimes you’ve got to fight through 
that because people are just bogged down, or because it’s harder than 
they thought or whatever. But if you still think it’s right, you still think 
it’s right.”
The evolution of Lehnert’s Open Design Review is putting the product 
in the hands of your team. Distribute beta builds internally—and, by 
the way, watch that download percentage; I’d try to get at least 40 per­
cent of your team on a build—so you can get real-world usage. Not only 
will you be able to identify places that are especially crash-prone, but 
you can also look at usage analytics and see where your team members 
drop off or abandon a user flow. 
Finally, though, it’s tough to really grasp a product until you make it 
part of your routine. An internal beta test eases that burden for all the 
members of your team. They can use your product under real live con­
ditions, in multiple places and scenarios that might not be immedi­
ately obvious to the intention of the product. They can use it when they 
can’t sleep. They can use it in a moment of inspiration. 
Because one never knows from where ideas can come.

ENCOURAGE BUG FILINGS
One of my favorite experiments is encouraging my team to file bugs, 
and then seeing what people think are bugs versus designed behav­
ior. Don’t get me wrong: this isn’t a sick social experiment, but it’s 
an inadvertent commentary on what might be an incredibly obscure 
or confusing flow or action in an early product. Yes, you will get a lot 
of false positives in this phase, and a number of irrelevant things will 
be pointed out that you’ve already fixed in an unreleased build, but if 
something in a primary flow or action is reported as a bug, it can give 
you focus. 
COMMUNICATE UPDATES OFTEN
“Iterating design is hard,” said Wells Riley, an experienced prod­
uct designer who’s currently at startup Envoy. “People don’t want to 
change something that they worked so hard to make perfect. So I don’t 
try to make things perfect. I try to make them good and let them get 
better over time.”
This is part detaching yourself from what you’ve created, and part 
being open about what’s changed. As we’ve seen over and over again, 
the process of creating a product is one steeped in persistent change. 
So communicate that. Make it obvious what’s new. What’s been struck. 
What’s been reconfigured. 
Humans are drawn to newness; there’s a “thrill associated with a new 
possession.”* By updating the team about exciting new developments 
once or twice a week, you’ll maintain attention and that all-important 
feedback loop.
“I consider communication one of the biggest parts of my role—and 
this includes anything I find out about our concept or competition,” 
said Ruby Anaya, currently director of social products at WeWork. “As 
soon as I find something that I think is impactful, I message my team 
to get their thoughts and perspective. I follow up with a more detailed 
analysis of what I’ve learned, but I love dropping quick bits of info to 
keep them in the loop of what people are thinking/doing. With every 
team I’ve worked with the first thing I do is set up an IM group (more 
often than not named some variation of the name ‘Peons’) where we 
keep in touch constantly about what we’re working on and of course 
many, many cat GIFs.”

ADDRESS THE TOUGHEST FIRST
It’s going to be tempting to focus on fixing the easy stuff—the font 
mismatches, the pixel misalignments, and the incorrect colors. But all 
of these things are secondary. Putting off the big worry-points means 
you’ll have little time to make essential product course corrections 
down the road. 
That’s why fine-tuning and iterating on feedback is so important 
before the final polish goes into the product. Get the core right—be 
true to the story your product is telling—and then move forward.
Eventually, you’ll reach a minimum level of quality that adequately 
solves your customer’s pain. It won’t be perfect, nor should it be. But 
it’ll have enough polish that you can ship small improvements every 
week, learn from those releases, and be in a far better place than if you 
hadn’t launched it at all.
TRUST IN THE RESEARCH
Feedback has a tendency to stir up even the most well-formed plans. 
If you get lost, refer back to the customer research you originally per­
formed. Why are you building this product? What are the key pains 
you’re obsessed with eliminating? Is what you’re building the best 
vehicle to do this? Your primary research is the guiding compass for 
all of this effort. Don’t forget the conclusions you drew from it at the 
beginning of the process. 
All this focus on feedback has only been about your team. Let’s talk 
next about gathering feedback from customers—both current and 
potential.
Customer Feedback
Products live and die at the hands of their customers. So why wouldn’t 
you get a product in front of your customers as early as possible to 
gather their feedback? 
But getting customer feedback is an entirely different animal than get­
ting critiques from your team. 
You have to find the right customers. And then you have to parse the 
feedback and act on it.

252  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
It’s a tricky tightrope to walk, and you risk defeating the entire pur­
pose of your initial research if you muddy the pond by letting your own 
bias creep into the feedback you receive. 
Then again, you’ve done the research. And you also know how to build 
products. You’re here because the research has given you an intuition. 
So how do you know when to make a bet and when to stay true to your 
analysis? 
I’m glad you asked. So let’s start with the who, and then we’ll move to 
the how.
IDENTIFY THE RIGHT CUSTOMERS
You’re either building a product with existing customers, or one that 
has no existing user base. 
Existing customers
There are so many ways to slice up your existing customer base. Many 
of them will be wrong. In the case of asking for feedback on a new 
piece of your product, focusing on every single customer is a big mis­
take. Not only is it going to overwhelm you, but it’s going to pull your 
focus away from areas that are relevant only to the portion of the prod­
uct you’re improving. 
Would you ask a luggage handler at an airport to test new controls for 
an air traffic controller? Or, better yet, would you ask the entire airport 
staff to weigh in on the benefits or challenges of a new feature for peo­
ple pushing tin (yes, I just referred to a terrible 90s movie)?
No. Because your results would be incredibly skewed. At best, they’d 
be ill-informed opinions, and at worst, you’d implement changes based 
upon completely biased experiences.
When it comes to your product, you can’t treat your customers as exist­
ing on an equal playing field. Not every customer is as valuable as the 
next one. Some have experienced parts of your product that others hav­
en’t. Some pay you money. Some don’t. Some are new; some are old. 
Some have just signed up and are incredibly active. Some are inactive, 
and might also be new.
My point here is that you need to match the customer set to the prob­
lem you’re solving.

Are you building a new feature that allows media sharing? Great. You 
should be talking to people who’ve recently sent text messages and 
uploaded new profile photos. 
Are you trying to enhance your signup process? Great. Find all the 
people who’ve just recently started the signup process—especially the 
ones that didn’t complete the flow—and talk with them about their 
experience. 
Are you trying to increase your product’s revenue? Find your custom­
ers on the free plan that went to upgrade, but didn’t. Then find the cus­
tomers who’ve been paying for the most amount of time. What makes 
them different? 
When he was at KISSmetrics, Hiten Shah, for example, gave existing 
choice customers a sense of context and comfort when looking at new 
features he released.
“Once a clickable prototype is done, we spend a lot of time doing 
usability testing, if you want to call it that, or early testing with actual 
users/customers on those flows to make sure that we are not missing 
anything,” he said in our interview. “We like to get something that 
works, especially with the analytics tool at KISSmetrics, to a customer 
as fast as possible using their own data—because an analytics tool is 
really about your own data.”
Shah stressed that gathering feedback from a limited set of exist­
ing customers can help, rather than hurt, the process of collecting 
feedback.
“Sometimes in the prototyping phase, there’s more crap on the screen 
than when we actually release it for the first time for a lot of custom­
ers,” he said. “The scope has to flex, and it has to be based as early on 
as possible on feedback from the customer. The earlier you can get the 
prototype in the customers’ hands, the better off you are in most cases, 
in my experience.”
Potential customers
What do you do if you’re creating a product from scratch, and are either 
a startup or a company looking to expand into a new category?
One angle is to recruit potential customers from the research you’ve 
performed. But this is risky.

That’s because the whole point of the intense, ethnographic research 
we examined in Chapter 2—called Sales Safari, and invented by Amy 
Hoy, remember?—is that you shouldn’t be asking random people what 
they think. People don’t know what they want. And, unless you’re an 
expert at excluding bias from your questions, there’s a high probability 
that you’re going to do it wrong and end up like Donald on the show 
Silicon Valley, wandering around San Francisco and harassing people 
with crazy-sounding pitches like:
“Interested? Very interested? Or interested?”*
History is littered with thousands of corpses of technology startups 
that approached random people at Starbucks to ask them what they 
thought of their product. 
Even Intuit, which was one of the first technology companies to take 
an ethnographically driven approach to product design, lost its way. 
The company risked being a one-product wonder, with all other efforts 
to expand into new categories looking like they’d be permanently rel­
egated to “shelfware.”
“[Scott] Cook reembraced a P&G fundamental—that new products 
should be based on actual customer behaviors, not on what customers 
said they wanted to do,” recount the authors of the book Inside Intuit. 
“Many customers said that they should do a better job of retirement 
planning and told the company that they would purchase Intuit’s prod­
uct to do so. However, since customers by and large did no financial 
planning before Intuit’s product came to the market, Intuit’s product 
could not persuade them to start.”†
Recruit potential customers by approaching them individually, or by 
openly inviting a set of customers to a private build. 
The former—recruiting potential customers by approaching them 
individually with a prototype or barely functional version—is how 
Ryan Hoover learned what it’d take to make Product Hunt viable.

Years of blogging, relationship building, and projects like Startup 
Edition have given me an audience and network of supporters. 
The term “startup” is deceiving. Successful companies don’t start 
up overnight; they are founded upon years of experience and help 
from others that must be earned.‡
The individual approach can be really useful for highlighting prob­
lems with your pitch. Josh Elman of Greylock, Twitter, Facebook, 
LinkedIn, and Zazzle (whew!) describes this more in detail:
“When [your product] can’t be succinctly described—or you tell it to 
other people and they completely don’t get it and they tell it back some 
other crazy way—I think those are really the two that concern me,” he 
said in our interview. “I think that’s what’s most important. You either 
can’t describe it or when you describe it, people just go, ‘Meh.’ But 
even on that, if you really believe it’s right, I’m OK with that as long as 
they aren’t completely misunderstanding it. Because that just means 
you need to describe it better,” he said.
The latter approach—openly inviting a set of customers from your 
community to a private build—is how Dropbox first launched (Figure 
8-5).§ This approach, however, requires a little more preparation. You’ll 
need to have a rough pitch, a functioning registration and login sys­
tem, and a way to distribute your logins or builds in a controlled fash­
ion so others can’t get in. Finally, you’ll need a way to track product 
usage so you can monitor activity without biasing results.

If you choose this method, keep releases tight and consistently ship 
iterations to show progress. Let the support emails and the usage pat­
terns speak for themselves. 
But analysis is an entirely different topic. So, how do you analyze cus­
tomer feedback? 
HOW TO ANALYZE CUSTOMER FEEDBACK
Analyzing customer feedback is really a version of Sales Safari at a dif­
ferent scale. We went through the specifics of this in Chapter 2—Sales 
Safari is “‘net ethnography,’ combined with some close reading and 
empathy,” Amy Hoy said in our interview. “[It’s] step-by-step empa­
thizing with your customer to understand them.”
Getting negative or contradictory feedback at this stage doesn’t neces­
sarily mean that you’re on the wrong path or that you have to change 
everything. And just because someone does something or says some­
thing doesn’t mean that it’s worth listening to. 
This process requires close reading, a study technique that’s meant to 
uncover layers of meaning in text. When you close read, you’re focus­
ing on the way the person communicates, how they see the world, or 
how they argue a particular point.* We’re doing this to understand

what people want. That’s because close reading, when used to under­
stand an audience, uncovers a series of data points that will begin to 
form patterns. 
“[People] get one data point or they get one potential client or cus­
tomer, and they think, ‘All right. This is it. I’m going to [make this 
product].’ That’s really a recipe for failure,” Hoy said. 
Remember, your potential customers have no allegiance to you. 
They don’t know what you’re capable of building. And they probably 
don’t know how to identify their own pains. It’s your job as a product 
designer to lead your team through that analysis and to extract the 
most relevant bits for your product’s improvement. 
For example, let’s say that you’re building a dating app. Early feedback 
shows that two interested parties have no problem showing mutual 
interest, but that’s where the interaction stalls. The feedback is that 
people think that the profiles are fake—the people on the app seem too 
attractive and their bios aren’t filled out.
There might be a couple of problems here. 
Nobody knows how to make the first move, and a little help might be 
in order. And perhaps your early, potential customers aren’t filling out 
their bios because it’s too hard. 
Notice how there are two possible problems, with a similar theme: 
pressure. People feel pressure to do something, and they don’t quite 
know how to react.
Don’t Squander Your Gains
You can get a lot of fresh research to sift through when you put a 
product in the hands of your colleagues, customers, and potential 
customers. 
Don’t squander it. Sweat equity is expendable, but real, raw, propri­
etary data isn’t. Take the time to parse it, understand it, and interpret 
back into your product. 
The biggest benefit of this process is that you don’t end up building 
the wrong thing. While it’s a grueling experience to interpret what 
current or potential customers are really trying to say, it’s significantly 
less painful than building the wrong thing and launching to crickets.

“The only way to create good product is to fall in love with the prob­
lem and really internalize it and understand it,” Jon Crawford, CEO 
and founder of ecommerce company Storenvy, said in our interview. 
“I would say the only way to create good product is to spend more time 
understanding the problem than creating the solution…most design­
ers, they’re so excited to solve the problem that it’s really easy to skip 
over understanding the problem really well first. It’s so exciting to 
solve the problem, [but] it’s not very exciting to learn and understand 
the problem.”
What is exciting are the benefits of getting customer input early. 
Assuming that you’ve interpreted your early Sales Safari data correctly, 
the benefits to your marketing and sales efforts can’t be overstated. 
You’ll have access to testimonials, early success statistics, and possibly 
even evangelists before you launch. That means you can weave this 
into your product pages, sales pitches, and, if you’re really lucky, have 
alpha customers selling for you before you launch.
Shareable Notes
•	 The Valley of Despair: we all know that feeling as product design­
ers. We all have hit that moment where we think our product 
won’t work, that nobody is going to use it. That’s the fear taking 
hold—the fear that all of your research and work has been wrong. 
•	 For any creative endeavor—including the act of building a prod­
uct—the creative process is roughly the same. It’s a stream of 
refinement before each release. 
•	 Feedback levels up your product, much like a character does in a 
role-playing game. We make great strides early on as we’re explor­
ing broad concepts and nailing down what it is we’re dealing with. 
Then, there’s a long process of refinement, and, finally, as cumu­
lative feedback rolls in, we shift the product into a state that’s even 
more powerful than we imagined. 
•	 Feedback can be tough. We, as product designers, throw ourselves 
into our work. So don’t take negative feedback personally. Creative 
work naturally reflects the individual that created it, but that 
doesn’t mean that any negativity is directed toward you personally.

•	 Team critiques can range from the Pixar-style “Braintrust” meet­
ings, Wunderlist-like “Open Design Reviews,” or internal beta 
tests.
•	 Customer feedback begins and ends with identifying the right 
customers for the type of feedback you need, getting feedback in a 
nonbiased manner, and analyzing it in the same way as you would 
Sales Safari data (found in Chapter 2).
Do This Now
•	 Get at least your prototypes done. And at least get them in front of 
your “Braintrust.” They were aware of the research, and know the 
basis of the product you’re trying to build. 
•	 Don’t take feedback personally. Creative work bleeds from our 
souls, but it doesn’t mean that it’s sacred just because we made it. 
•	 Don’t build the wrong thing. Take feedback seriously after you’ve 
parsed its meaning. This is your chance to course-correct if the 
overwhelming response is paltry and underwhelmed.

Interview: Ruby Anaya
Ruby Anaya is an experienced product executive. She’s currently direc-
tor of product management at WeWork, and previously worked at Yahoo!, 
Tomfoolery, and AOL.
How do you define and decide what you’re building? Who’s involved in 
this process?
Creative people who ask questions. When we’re starting the definition pro-
cess of a new product or feature, it usually involves a lot of what ifs, sketch-
ing, and joking around. The most effective teams I’ve worked on are ones 
where everyone feels a similar sense of ownership over the idea/problem at 
hand, so I try to capture everyone’s perspective.
What do these discussions look like? 
I’m a very visual person; I like to draw out solutions. Almost all product ide-
ation discussions start with wireframing the main interaction flow(s), cou-
pled with listing out open-ended questions that we encounter through the 
process. There’s always a back-and-forth with examples from competitors 
or best practices, but I try to focus a lot of the initial stages more on instinct 
and aspiration. The discussion ends with ensuring that everyone agrees on 
and understands a value statement for the product to ensure that moving 
forward we’re all working towards the same goal/understanding.
What’s the takeaway from this meeting—a document? A plan? A calen-
dar? How do you communicate this?
Action items—what can everyone do right now to make this happen, or, 
more specifically, what do we need to do next to test our idea? Our prod-
uct plan is communicated with basic wireframes to kick off both a visual 
and technical foundation of our MVP and research (if available; if not, that’s 
my next action item to bring to the team). This is followed by open-ended 
questions like who is our biggest competition, who is our target market, 
what’s the history of this concept/product (if available), etc. I try to answer 
these questions and become an expert at whatever it is we’re trying to 
accomplish.
What sort of competitive analysis do you and others perform? When 
researching competition, what are you looking to absorb? Product flows? 
UI conventions? What’s done right or wrong? 
www.it-ebooks.info

 Interpreting Feedback and “Leveling Up” Your Product   |  261
All of the above. I try to immerse myself in any product or company that is 
in a similar space or trying to solve the same problem we are. I usually start 
with looking at flows on sites like UXarchive.com which I find super helpful 
to get an overview of how people are tackling the same problem we are. I 
just looked it up and I have 225 apps on my phone, many of which are in 
folders named “Design” or “Testing Out.” 
Do you use forums, app reviews, or customer “watering holes” to analyze 
the pain points and/or potential opportunities of customers? If so, what 
does that research look like? 
I definitely look into app reviews and tech article comments reacting to any 
competition, but I also like to spend time asking the people around me (and 
myself) why they use one product over another, what drew them to it, why 
they talk about it, etc. 
How do you communicate the pros and cons of what others are doing in 
the space to your team, if this is your role?
I consider communication one of the biggest parts of my role—and this 
includes anything I find out about our concept or competition. As soon as 
I find something that I think is impactful, I message my team to get their 
thoughts and perspective. I follow up with a more detailed analysis of what 
I’ve learned, but I love dropping quick bits of info to keep them in the loop of 
what people are thinking/doing. With every team I’ve worked with, the first 
thing I do is set up an IM group (more often than not named some variation 
of the name “Peons”) where we keep in touch constantly about what we’re 
working on and of course many, many cat gifs.
If there are no direct competitors to what you’re building, what do you 
seek out for inspiration? 
I seek out people who would be impacted by what we’re building. Ask them 
questions, show them what we’re working on, and find out as much as I can 
about them. Then I try to find common themes among them.
How do you identify edge cases, data requirements, and other potential 
challenges before you start building? 
Edge cases and challenges are something I find best to work with our engi-
neering team—I always start defining it, but I lean on them a lot for filling 
in gaps I might have missed. I think because they are so much closer to the 
inner workings of the product they have a much better sense of when some-
thing is going to be in an empty state or error.

262  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Whether it’s you doing the design or someone else, what does this 
give-and-take look like? How far do you go with your designs before 
prototyping? 
I kick off the process with handing our design team initial wireframes where 
I try to show all possible states and a high-level flow of the main features 
of the product. I let them take it to the next level. Most of the time it’s a 
frequent back-and-forth with feedback—and by “frequent” I mean as fre-
quent as every hour or so. I love it when something I did inspired them to 
take it somewhere else, or vice versa. Like I said before, I’m really visual, and 
although I don’t consider myself an artist by any means, I appreciate great 
design and fight for it. 
How do you account for the different states in your product?
This is where I like to look at best practices and other products for inspi-
ration. Onboarding is almost always one of the biggest challenges, but I 
appreciate how I’ve evolved at approaching it over the years. I remember 
when I first started working on building products I was actually quite para-
noid about onboarding—in the sense that I wanted to make sure I covered 
every possibility and that everyone knew what they were getting them-
selves into. I think I was scared to mess something up. But as I’ve grown, 
I’ve learned to give people more credit for knowing what to do, and think-
ing about how I can both simplify the process and make it as familiar to the 
actual product itself. 
For example—in a messaging app I worked on at my last startup (we were 
acquired before it launched), my concept for onboarding was to have it 
start off like you were messaging with the app to get your name and phone 
number. [It’s as if the] input fields were [filled in] like you were just chatting. 
For error states, I like to take advantage of blank or error states with some-
thing fun or visually interesting (sometimes I even throw a picture of my cat 
in there). 
When do you know something is “good enough” to move onto the next 
phase? Do you test internally and “dog food” a product, or do you test 
with potential customers? 
I do both—dog food and testing. I know something is good enough when 
it’s not a job for me to use it, and when I see similar usage trends from our 
test cases. It’s easy to fall in love with what you build even if it doesn’t make 
sense or your timing is off—it’s your baby. Being objective isn’t easy, but 
when you take a step back and realize that if you’re not objective/realistic 
you’re potentially hurting yourself and your team, it comes more naturally. 
www.it-ebooks.info

 Interpreting Feedback and “Leveling Up” Your Product   |  263
What do you look out for when your product is launched? How do you 
gather feedback to know whether or not it’s working? 
Analyzing usage is key. Looking deep into how the people are using it IRL 
versus how our team uses it or our assumptions of how we think the market 
will use it. We look into who is using it—is it the market we designed it for? 
How often are they using it? Is it solving the problem we outlined, or per-
haps something else? When are they using it? Where are they when they are 
using it? All these things you can’t tell until you get it in the hands of others. 
And this is going to dictate next priorities—are you on the right track? Do 
you need to pivot? Do you need to rethink things entirely? 
Take ownership of everything. You’re the CEO of your product. You need to 
know how it works, what stage it’s in, what issues are open, and what’s next 
at all times. I recently was at a product off-site and our SVP Jeff Bonforte 
gave some great advice: always have a 10-page deck for your product. 
Whether you work at a big company like Yahoo! or a tiny startup, you need 
to be always ready to defend and own your ideas. Keep evolving on your 
deck as you learn more about the space or your target market.
Staying positive is something that I think is needed to keep momentum. If 
you’re the go-to for the product vision and strategy and you’re a bummer 
to be around, what does that say about the vision? Is something wrong with 
it? I think as a product manager part of my job is to be a representative of 
the product at all times—and that applies to both being prepared to present 
your product but also being able to represent the team building it.
What tools or skills are you actively trying to learn related to building 
products?
I just started taking an iOS class—coming from a nonengineering back-
ground, I’m trying to learn more about the development process. I also just 
started using Sketch to wireframe. 
I’m also trying to get better at being a salesperson for my product. It’s not 
something that has come that naturally to me, so I try to watch and learn 
from people that I think are good at it. And something I’ve learned regard-
ing this is to not let people’s doubtful questions get you down. A few years 
ago I had a VP ask me about a redesign I was doing. He asked, “What new 
features are you putting in?” My response was “None.” 
www.it-ebooks.info

264  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
He questioned how we could “get away” with that. I think a lot of peo-
ple might freak out and think “what new features can I get in there, too?” 
But instead I stood my ground—“this project is focused on redesigning our 
visual and structural hierarchy to make it a better and more familiar expe-
rience for our users, as well as create better ad opportunities. I don’t want 
to overwhelm people with new functionality at this stage.” And he was OK 
with that. Stick by your guns and don’t be afraid to say, “I didn’t think of 
that” if you didn’t. Just go and take a note to think about it later. Or if you 
did and decided it wasn’t the right time, stick to it. There’s always the pos-
sibility that we’ll make mistakes, but there will be regardless of whether you 
stick to your ideas or just blindly follow people above you. At least they’ll be 
your mistakes/wins to take credit for, not someone else’s.
How do you stay creatively inspired? 
Constantly playing with new products and talking about them. I think Ryan 
Hoover’s Product Hunt is so awesome for this—it’s great to see a commu-
nity around new ideas. I also love living here in the Valley. I know a lot of 
people complain about how all everyone talks about is tech, but I love it. I 
love what I do and I love talking about it and hearing how other people solve 
problems. I think it’s a tribute to the fact that the tech community really 
enjoys their professions that we talk about it all the time, and I appreciate 
that. Talking about what you like about a product or a feature you would do 
differently helps me stay inspired with solving my own product problems or 
coming up with new ideas.

Shipping Is an Art—and a Science
The Invention Versus the Manufactured Article
It’s traditional to work until someone just takes it away from you. 
Films are not released. They escape.
—BEN BURTT, SOUND DESIGNER, FILM EDITOR, AND 
DIRECTOR FOR THE STAR WARS FILMS*
Thomas Edison was under the gun. 
It was 1882. He was years removed from the dazzling display of light 
he’d exhibited to the public on New Year’s Eve in 1880 when he’d 
opened the gates to his secretive Menlo Park lab. It was the first time 
that the world had seen the power of electric light in one place. Edison 
even went as far to invent Christmas lights for the occasion.† 
About 3,000 unsuspecting, perhaps skeptical, pilgrims had arrived at 
night onto the train platform of sleepy Menlo Park. What they saw 
rivaled anything they could see even in Manhattan, which was 20 
miles away: the village was bathed with the non-flickering light of 
electric bulbs.‡

The crowd’s energy—no pun intended—must have rubbed off on 
him. Because Edison then publicly promised to bring the technology 
to an urban site: New York’s Pearl Street. The road to bringing elec­
tricity out of the labs was wrought with pitfalls. Not only did he have 
to recreate what he did in a lab in the real world, but he and his team 
had to design all of the components of an electrical system (switches, 
sockets, generators, etc.), and had to find a proper site while lining up 
early customers. Wow.* 
On top of that, Edison didn’t have a pricing model worked out yet. So 
he sent survey teams into the field to conduct market research. What 
were people paying for gas? What would they be willing to pay for elec­
tricity and equipment?
Despite his promises, Edison wasn’t producing. Critics were spread­
ing. Was this all vaporware? 
There’s a wide difference between completing an invention and 
putting the manufactured article on the market…It was years after 
photography was invented before the first photograph was taken; 
years after the steamboat and telegraph were invented before they 
were actually set going.†
It’s not that different for digital products. You create the prototypes, 
design the mockups, and get something sort of working. You fake out 
user testers with just enough of the experience intact that they think 
it’s real. You get feedback, gather critiques, and iterate until the fidel­
ity increases. 
Making the leap from these iterations and onto something that can 
support real customers and real data is a huge one. And while the 
stakes might not be quite as high as they were for Edison when it 
comes to the product you’re launching (creating a power grid is, you 
know, kind of a big deal), it’s still your life we’re talking about here. If 
you’ve taken the time to create a product that you know will improve 
the life of the person using it, then it’s worth taking the time to make 
sure your product’s ready to get out in the wild.
But what defines “ready”? And if it’s ready, how do you get it out into 
the world?

It’s Ready When It’s Ready
The simple answer is…when it’s ready. 
I’m not trying to be smug. And no, I’m not trying to create a phrase 
that you’ll tweet to your billion followers with two clicks. 
The simple fact is that launching a product has become a buzzword. 
Burn the ships. 
F* it. Ship it. 
Stay focused and keep shipping.
And it’s not that these motivations aren’t rooted in a good place. A 
product in motion—refining and learning about its customers—is a 
product that’s evolving and, potentially, improving.
But shipping for the sake of shipping helps nobody. And it’s become 
an obsession in our insular culture of technology. The phenomenon is 
leading to lots of bad work—with individuals in our community being 
more proud of how quickly they produced something than of how 
effective their product is at what it set out to do. 
I love how Cat Noone, an experienced entrepreneur and product 
designer, puts this: 
It’s called “ship,” not “shit.”
She continues:
It’s all about shipping.
Except it’s not. Don’t get me wrong, I’m an advocate for getting a 
product out there and continually iterating based on user testing, 
gut feeling, feedback, etc. There are going to be bugs, things are 
going to flat out break sometimes, some things might not look as 
visually appealing—and that’s okay. However, there is a fine line 
between shipping for the sake of putting anything out there and 
shipping a product that is of quality.
It is forgotten all too easily that there is a responsibility that comes 
with pushing a product out into the world that individuals will 
use. It is your job to ensure the problem is solved.‡

268  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
In my experience, organizations overly focused on shipping for the 
sake of shipping are doing so because they don’t know what else to do. 
They don’t know what their customers need. They may not even know 
who their customers are. 
Sadly, shipping for the sake of shipping won’t change that. 
So if that’s where you are, take a step back. “Don’t mistake speed for 
precocity: the world doesn’t need wrong answers in record time,” as 
Cennydd Bowles, former design manager at Twitter, wrote. Get the 
right answers. 
And that’s even what Facebook realized. In 2014, Mark Zuckerberg 
made a public declaration that they were changing their famous 
“move fast and break things” philosophy—the one they’d emblazoned 
on walls and in their IPO prospectus. 
“In the past we’ve done more stuff to just ship things quickly and see 
what happens in the market,” Brian Boland of Facebook clarified. 
“Now, instead of just throwing something out there, we’re making 
sure that we’re getting it right first.” The time and effort it took to 
repaint the walls and shred the IPO prospectus has been more than 
made up for with the rise in their stock price.
While we’re talking about tech giants, we might as well talk about 
Apple. From the outside, it looks like Tim Cook and Jony Ive only ship 
products when they’re “magical” enough. After all, they’ve got more 
cash on hand than the U.S. Treasury has on hand. So who needs dead­
lines with friends like that? 
But that’s actually not the case. “Not only does the company set inter­
nal deadlines, it also creates deadlines for deadlines that have their own 
deadlines,” wrote former Apple Senior Designer Mark Kawano (now 
CEO of photo storage company Storehouse). “Every aspect of the com­
pany’s production cycle, from conception to ship date, is calculated.”* 
But wait a minute, you faceless author, you’re probably thinking. You 
just said that you should ship a product when it’s ready. You’re not making 
sense.
Well, how about this plot twist? Kawano continues:

re-proud-of.html
www.it-ebooks.info

 Shipping Is an Art—and a Science   |  269
But—and this is a big “but”—what makes Apple different is that 
it is a company that is willing to move those deadlines. If a product 
in development isn’t ready to be released, the deadline is pushed 
back. If an idea isn’t perfect, or isn’t considered truly magical and 
delightful internally, it’s held back, revised, and the product given 
an entirely new launch date.
Now, all magical fairy dust aside, we can learn from these examples. 
Shipping alone is not the end goal. Shipping alone will not make your 
product great. 
Shipping is about creating a “minimum lovable product.” Coined 
by Noone, this term encompasses the struggles we face as product 
designers creating pixels—a product that solves a problem, but also 
creates an emotional connection and leaves an impact on the person 
who used it.
She writes:
So what if we started pushing “Minimum Lovable Products” into 
the world? The lowest form that is capable of being loved, accepted 
and a problem solver; with an understanding that it is not flawless.
This doesn’t mean monolithic product releases, or taking years to 
release something until it’s just right. Release something every day if 
you want. 
But as Ben Burtt, the famous sound designer of the Star Wars films, 
said of the filmmaking process: “Films aren’t released, they escape.” 
A focus on your audience’s problems. Self-imposed deadlines. And a 
threshold for quality. These are natural forcing functions that push 
you to create and iterate until the product just has to escape when it’s 
ready. That’s why the “minimum lovable product” rocks.
Being “Chief of Everything”
Shipping your product means you take ownership of everything. 
You’re the “COE” of your product. You need to know how it works, 
what stage it’s in, what issues are open, and what’s next at all times. 
Your responsibility doesn’t end once the product is ready to ship or has 
shipped.

Everybody tracks what they need to do differently. Trello boards. Post-it 
notes. Wikis. It doesn’t matter which tools you use. Just be clear with 
your team. Teach them the quality you expect. Make sure they under­

should be doing.
Cat Noone revealed to me in our interview that she and her cofounder

“For our product roadmap (and our process style in general) the man­

very loose. Don’t get me wrong, we have documents for features, an 
understanding of what needs to be done for it, etc. But we don’t over­
manage things.

“We’ve found that often, less process is a better process. You’ll see we 
use hashtags to know what each task item is for or pertaining to in 
each folder, who is responsible for the task, etc. Wunderlist is super 
great for this, because no matter how many people are on a project, 
there should always be one individual responsible for seeing the proj­
ect through from start to launch.”
Katelyn Friedson, who designed mobile products at publicly traded 
Care.com, used a combination of JIRA user stories and shared Google 
Docs. The JIRA ticket is the piece that can be tracked by all parties 
involved on its status (Figure 9-2), and the ticket has an embedded link 
to the Google Doc with exactly how the feature should work (Figure 
9-3).

“I’ve used JIRA for writing user stories (usually each [JIRA item] can 
be a paragraph or a few bullets long) which has been best for tracking,” 
Friedson said. “But I’ve also used a Google Doc in combination with 
JIRA, which I like best. It gives you real-time collaboration so that if 
something in your original requirements goes stale, you can update it 
and make a comment. But it also allows you and your dev team to track 
various tasks a user can complete/things they can do.”
Ruby Anaya, who’s built products for WeWork and Yahoo!, carries 
around an interesting document with her at all times: a 10-page deck 
for her product, updated and at the ready.
“Whether you work at a big company like Yahoo! or a tiny startup, you 
need to be always ready to defend and own your ideas,” she said in our 
interview. “Keep evolving on your deck as you learn more about the 
space or your target market.”
But what about preparing your team for what’s to come? Predicting 
press questions, honing sales pitches, getting assets and collateral 
in place? Finalizing landing-page pitch copy or product pricing? 
Tweaking the product’s launch video? 
All of this rests on you—even if marketing or sales or engineering has 
their opinions, they’re going to be looking to you for guidance.

“I think you just have to have the energy to get in there and fix [things] 
yourself,” said Graham Jenkin in our interview. He builds products at 
AngelList, an online platform for startups to raise money and recruit 
talent. “It just takes time, it takes energy, but if you want the product 
to be at the level of quality that you feel is appropriate, then you have 
to put in that time. It’s just hard work. I don’t think there’s any way 
around it.”
So once it’s out, and once you’ve worked off the celebration—which, 
you definitely should do, by the way—what do you track? Consider? 
Analyze?
Timoni West and Kyle Bragger—who created products for Foursquare, 
Flickr, and Elepath—independently identified their secret to a success­
ful launch: monitoring customer support.
Whether it’s you answering the emails post-launch, or your expert 
team, or a combination of the two, make sure you’re at least monitor­
ing the channels. 
Yes, it’s unglamorous and time-consuming. But it’s the fastest, most 
direct conduit into the minds of your customers after you ship. And 
put yourself in their shoes: how cool would it be to talk with the person 
that made the feature or product they’re using? 
Even better, customer support traffic can identify what’s not work­
ing and what’s confusing. It identifies both technical and product 
problems. 
“Customer support, by the way, is the most important job at any com­
pany,” says Timoni West. “I’ve seen so many tiny apps—ones you 
think would be out of business—surviving and thriving because their 
customer base knows they can depend on customer support. On the 
flip side, if I tweet at a company with a complaint and get ignored, I 
know they saw it and have chosen to ignore me: bad news.”
Bragger agrees: 
As a user I like nothing more than hearing, “Hey, I’m so and so, 
I actually worked on this feature. Tell me about what’s going on.” 
I think it’s obvious that there’s more of a connection and more an 
overt level of care when it’s the person who created the thing. At 
least, I want to make sure that something I built is working. So 
I think it’s super healthy when people who built the stuff have to 
support it. It seems almost natural.

There’s a catch, though—you’re going to experience the heat. We’re 
talking about human beings, after all. 
At Care.com, Friedson monitored customer feedback forums, App 
Store ratings and reviews, call center activity, and more. She learned 
quickly that one has to “resist the urge to panic or rapidly change 
things in response,” she said in our interview. 
Passions flare in the beginning. But if you ride out this initial 
24- to 48-hour period, things will usually settle down. Most peo­
ple respond before they’ve really dug in and used whatever you’ve 
added (or gotten along with what you’ve removed). So sit back, 
take it all in, and don’t make a move until some time has passed. 
Then you’ll be able to offer a more reasoned response. Also, 
remember that negative reactions are almost always louder and 
more passionate than positive ones. In fact, you may only hear 
negative voices even when the majority of your base is happy about 
a change. Make sure you don’t foolishly backpedal on necessary, 
but controversial, decisions.
What fascinates me about this trait is that it supports one of my core 
beliefs about products: they start and end with observation of your 
audience. Customer support posts and emails are a gold mine for this.
It’s Not Over Yet
This is technology. We work in pixels and hardware. The chances of

Interview: Josh Elman
Josh Elman is an experienced product leader focused on disruptive prod-
ucts that change the way people interact and communicate. He’s led product 
teams at Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Zazzle. Currently, he’s a partner at 
venture capital firm Greylock.
Can you identify some common DNA in each of your experiences 
[Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Zazzle] that produced such great results?
Yeah, the first thing I want to say here is, at some point who knows if it was 
causation or correlation. I feel super lucky. Super lucky to have gotten all the 
opportunities I did. And just got to see such amazing decisions. I think there 
were three things that really have separated all the companies I’ve been at, 
the ones that I didn’t go to, or that friends went to, or that I met along the 
way and didn’t consider going to.
The first one is, they really had a vision for how the world could be differ-
ent if the company was successful. For whatever reason, it’s not how can 
the company be successful, how can the product be successful. But really, 
this theory that the world could be different if this company is successful. 
But it was really powerful. At RealNetworks it was audio and video over the 
Internet. Imagine when all audio and video is delivered over IP. We’re start-
ing to live in that world. It’s incredible what you can do with YouTube and 
Netflix and video on demand.
The second was, when I joined LinkedIn, Reid [Hoffman] said, “if we can 
connect all the professionals with the people that they know, you’ll change 
the way you get a job and information on people because it’ll all be indexed 
in a way that it’s very hard to find person-to-person right now.” When I 
joined Zazzle, it was the same thing. It was, can you imagine a world where 
anything we want to buy we can just order on demand and it gets made 
within 24 hours for us? And I can just keep going. Facebook and Twitter are 
probably more obvious now in retrospect.
But those were all these big missions and they had a vision for how the 
world would be different. And all these companies didn’t just have a vision 
for how the world would be different, they had a stepwise way in which 
we were going to tiptoe our way there. Realizing that you weren’t going to 
get that world different overnight by just making your product and getting 
everyone to do it, but that it was going to take a little while.

And [each company] had lots of milestones and believed in [their vision]. 
At LinkedIn, we knew the only way we could have all these jobs be differ-
ent was if we got the network connected. At Zazzle, we knew the only way 
we’re going to get everybody buying and selling this way is if we start by 
getting a couple big brands and convince people that products like stamps, 
which you could never imagine ordering custom, you could order custom. 
So Zazzle invested a lot in real postage stamps that were custom. Each one 
of these is, do these little small things that add up to the big thing.
The third piece is all the products were simple and the products were not 
perfect. People often try to get perfection, but products that connect peo-
ple are always a little bit messy, and you’re better off doing the best you can 
to get a few people in on it. And evolve it over time instead of, “it must be 
the product that matches this big vision or I’m not going to do it.”
So I think those three: having this vision of how the world looks different, 
understanding just the first baby steps that you need to make so that if you 
get that right then you get the right to do your next ones and the next ones, 
and then the third being keeping it simple and getting it out and learning, 
and accepting it’s a little bit messy, were a huge impact. That’s very differ-
ent than Apple, but by all means Apple runs as a very different company 
than the rest of us, and those startups shouldn’t compare themselves to 
Apple today because that’s just impossible.
So I like how you publicly say that you know how to balance the tradeoffs 
of “getting it perfect versus getting it out the door.” Are there any prin-
ciples there that you’ve kept in mind over the years? I know it’s very 
contextual.
I haven’t thought of that phrase in a while. I think it’s on my LinkedIn or 
something. That’s great. The tradeoffs are fundamentally understanding 
the problem that you want to solve at this time, with this feature, for this set 
of users. And really helping the team get to the point where we can decide 
whether what we’re going to deliver will actually help our users get the 
problem they face done. 
It’s not [solving] the bigger problems we all want to solve with the prod-
uct to make it perfect, but if we get this out, will this actually help solve the 
things that we want to get done now? And that’s the fundamental challenge 
and opportunity here. I think a lot of people miss that. A lot of people try 
to get everything they want to get done, done, and not just—is this good 
enough to solve the problem? Because if it is, let’s get it out.

 Shipping Is an Art—and a Science   |  277
Where does the identification of an opportunity start?
I think it starts anywhere within a company. But if you end up with a team 
that has resources, the thing that a product development team can do that 
other teams in the company can’t do is actually build features and ship them 
to users. A marketing team can’t do that. They don’t have engineers. They 
can do a lot of interesting things with money and campaigns and design and 
everything else, but they can’t build a product and ship it to your users. And 
so that’s what a productive development team is for. You call it opportunity, 
I call it a problem. You basically say, our company would be better if we had 
more people spending money, more people using the product every day—
whatever the big company goal is—more people talking about the product 
this way instead of that way.
Whatever the company goal is—and then you go, OK, give them what we 
have now; what’s the reason why we don’t have more of that? Or what is 
the problem that more users would like solved that if we solved it, we’d 
make more money or get more usage, or whatever? And then it’s simply a 
matter of, what are the solutions to that problem that the team owns? Not 
the product manager and not the marketing person, but actually the whole 
team collectively owns. What are the solutions to the problems we’ve iden-
tified? Problem identification ends up being somewhat company-driven, so 
I don’t want to call it top-down, but at the end of the day the product man-
ager, the GM, the CEO really owns the “this is the problem that I think it’s 
really important that we go solve.”
Then the product team’s job is to go, “what’s the best solution for the prob-
lem?” And collectively they need to come up with it. I use this phrase talking 
about product management—I have a blog post I need to do on it*—that the 
phrase for the product manager is, help your team shift to the right product 
for your users. It’s help your team, not guide your team, define what your 
team does, write this package. 
Help your team however you can. Ship, because you’ve got to ship it. If you 
don’t ship it, you’re not actually doing your job as product manager.

The right product means you’ve identified the right problem and you’re 
actually solving it in a way that you can measure and show that you’re help-
ing it. And to your users means you understand your users and you’ve it 
scoped enough that you know who you’re building it for and what you’re 
going to solve. And you’re actually going to measure that you’ve solved it. 
And so I use that phrase because at the end of the day, once you guys have 
identified the problem, the team’s job is to go figure out what the right solu-
tions are collectively and ship it.
How do your keep your team focused on the right thing?
Well, look, the first thing is you have to trust your team. I think that sounds 
obvious, but it’s much harder in practice. I think a lot of structures and pro-
cesses are built on the fact that there isn’t innate trust. So that’s one issue. 
The second issue—once you do [trust your team], then, it’s really, get your 
team’s help in how to solve the problem. The team knows what they can 
build. The team knows how it can be developed. The designers know what 
kinds of things are designable and natural in the product and what kinds of 
things are not. All of this matters.
So what I used to do was—well, if we know their problem, and there wasn’t 
really a consensus for what the problem was—but I tried to do an open 
brainstorm with the team on what thing we were going to go build. How are 
we going to try to best address this? What’s the number one thing we can 
do to convert more users to be active? Or to get more users in the system? 
And I had ideas from my experience, and lots of people had ideas from their 
intuition. And so we’d debate it and vote. And I’d trust the team to vote. And 
if the team voted that this thing seemed like the best way to go solve the 
problem, you’ve got to trust the collective—it’s the group that’s going to go 
build it anyway. And then you go build it together.
And look, not everyone’s going to agree, but if everybody sees a public, 
open vote and debate, and you have to be open and honest about that, then 
you have a chance to actually say, “OK, we all picked this. Are we aligned? 
Now let’s go crank on it.” And then your job is to help your team actually 
deliver on that thing that we all decided on, but you’ve already gotten some 
kind of consensus. So I really think the debate and vote prioritized together 
is a really important thing.

 Shipping Is an Art—and a Science   |  279
How did you manage the process of the product getting built? How do 
you make sure the product feels right?
Ultimately, great designers and great engineers are going to have that feel 
just as much as I will. So my job is to be a champion. The key thing that 
I focus on is the story. Making sure we had a consistent name—every lit-
tle feature we did I’d try to give some name. Whether it was like, “Email 
Retention Letter” or “Welcome Back Letter” or “New User Flow 3.” It can 
be dumb names like that or it can be really catchy like, “WTF” or “Who to 
Follow,” which we built at Twitter—that’s our user suggestions. We always 
try to come up with a scope that defines the feature and then a story.
And sometimes it’s written down. It should have been written down more— 
I often did it more ad hoc—but it’s like, “Hey! This is the story of why we’re 
building this feature, what we expect users to be able to do differently when 
it’s there, and the impact we expect to have on their usage of the product 
and the overall business.” And you tell that story enough that you hold the 
feature that gets built to that story. Sometimes you build it in a way that 
it doesn’t actually feel right to the story. Sometimes you build it in a way 
where everybody’s like, “Oh, now I understand the story, or that doesn’t 
feel like the right story.” But you’re trying to always hold yourself to that. I 
think a lot of people miss how important story is to everything we’re doing. 
Because once I can tell the story of what I want to do with the product, 
everything else will spin out from there.
What makes you step back and makes you think that you’re building the 
wrong thing? 
I think number one is when it can’t be succinctly described. Or you tell it 
to other people and they completely don’t get it and they tell it back some 
other crazy way. I think those are really the two that concern me. I think 
that’s what’s most important. You either can’t describe it or you describe it, 
and people just go, “Meh.” But even on that, if you really believe it’s right, 
I’m OK with that as long as they aren’t completely misunderstanding it.
Because that just means you need to describe it better. The third one is the 
team starts building it and everybody’s like, “This sucks.” You trust the reso-
nance of the team. But sometimes you’ve got to fight through that because 
people are just bogged down because it’s harder than they thought or 
whatever. But if you still think it’s right, you still think it’s right.

So when a product’s about to launch, about to ship, is it the product team 
who is writing the marketing copy, the materials? Are they talking to a 
product marketer about this stuff? How do you make sure the product is 
well publicized in the right way?
It all comes back to that story. If you’ve written a good story and people 
in the company understand the story, why it matters, etc., then you have a 
shot at it being the right story that goes out to the market. If you haven’t 
done a good job setting up that story, then you’re screwed.

Interview: Cat Noone
Cat Noone is an experienced product designer. She’s currently building Iris, 
an app that notifies loved ones if you’re in an emergency.
How do you define and decide what you’re building? Who’s involved in 
this process? 
Myself, cofounder, and our users. They play the biggest role in what gets 
built next. We have a very base-level product roadmap that we want to 
achieve, things that need to be built, and others we take from our users that 
we didn’t think of before.
How do you identify and solve problems?
From the very beginning, we spent a lot of time educating and submerg-
ing ourselves in the world of writers and self-publishing. You need to be an 
expert in your field, no matter what it is. If it’s messaging, you need to know 
the ins and outs of communication, for productivity, how people tick—per-
sonally and professionally.
What does this discussion (or series of discussions) look like? 
For us, it’s usually as soon as something pops into our head. We have a list in 
Wunderlist for “Future Ideas” where we put everything as soon as we think 
of it and then it’s discussed. Either right then and there, or at a later period 
of time when we have our meeting(s).
www.it-ebooks.info

 Shipping Is an Art—and a Science   |  281
We discuss all of the different pros and cons it will play on our users, the 
platform, and company. Sometimes one of us is really psyched about some-
thing, but after discussing it, we realize something we didn’t before, and 
it’s obvious that it cannot and should not be built because it will waste time 
and/or resources.
What’s the takeaway from this meeting—a document? A plan? A calen-
dar? How do you communicate this? 
There’s almost always documentation of sorts on it and we plug it into our 
product roadmap document. We document when, approximately, each 
feature is due to be released. This is discussed right then and there upon 
the decision that we will move forward with a feature. We find where it fits 
best in the roadmap and go from there. Obviously, this is not set in stone, 
as things change and have to shift, but we’re on track for the most part. 
[Because things change], we definitely don’t plug anything into the calendar. 
The only thing that has due dates on it is GitHub, because you have to pick 
one for a milestone and Wunderlist just to keep us on track with deadlines.
Do you create anything from this meeting to use as a foundation to pre-
vent design creep, keep focused, etc.? 
We do our best to stay on track and keep focused on what our users 
are talking to us about and what is necessary from a product and busi-
ness standpoint. What it comes down to is this: if it’s not on the roadmap, 
but something a lot of people are asking for, we have a discussion about 
whether it can and should wait. Or, if we should shift resources to that fea-
ture for a moment in time. 
What sort of competitive analysis do you and others perform? When 
researching competition, what are you looking to absorb? Product flows? 
UI conventions? What’s done right or wrong? 
It’s a pretty big cocktail of everything possible that we can absorb. What 
we look at first and foremost is user experience. How easy is it to use this 
product and achieve the goal compared to our product? We look at every-
thing from their experience and visual design to their monetization strategy.
Ultimately, in the end, it’s all packaged into the user experience and we try 
to see where we compare to them on that front.

282  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Do you use forums, app reviews, or customer “watering holes” to analyze 
the pain points and/or potential opportunities of customers? If so, what 
does that research look like? 
We seek inspiration from a variety of companies, honestly. Whoever is kick-
ing ass when providing a fantastic user experience. Oftentimes, it’s not even 
a company in our space. We look and see how other companies are han-
dling support, monetization, communication, marketing, and more. It all 
plays a role and you limit yourself a lot if you limit where you seek inspira-
tion. There’s a lot to learn from all spaces that can be applied to your own. 
What tools or skills are you actively trying to learn related to building 
products? 
When I have the time, I’m making a big effort to learn how to become more 
proficient in code and also with the use of tools like Origami, Framer.js, and 
more for prototyping. You can save a lot of development time if the iteration 
of prototypes is laid out well from the beginning.
It’s always great to have people on a team that can hop into another per-
son’s place in case of an emergency, which is why I’m a big proponent of 
having designers who can work cross-platform instead of focusing solely 
on one. 
How do you stay creatively inspired? 
I was asked this question in a Smashing Magazine interview and thoroughly 
surprised myself when I realized how little creativity comes from the dig-
ital world. I make it a point to step away from the computer often for the 
creative inspiration, and it also helps with avoiding burnout so you kill two 
birds with one stone. Don’t get me wrong, I’m definitely inspired by many 
designers out there and love checking out their work, but I turn to travel-
ing—exploring the art, food, and lifestyle of different cultures—along with 
the everyday things to really “wow” me and get my creative juices flowing.
