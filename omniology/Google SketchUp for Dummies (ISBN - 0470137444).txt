About the Author
Aidan Chopra has always had a thing for computers — his parents 
thoughtfully sent him to Apple camp instead of hockey lessons like every
other eight-year-old in Montreal — but he learned to draft and build physical
models the old-fashioned way, working for his architect father. These days,
Aidan is a Product Evangelist at Google, where he’s been since that company
bought SketchUp in the first part of 2006. In the three years since he gradu-
ated with a Master of Architecture degree from Rice University, he’s done a
lot of writing and lecturing about the way software is used in design. Aidan
writes the SketchUpdate, a monthly e-mail newsletter that reaches a half mil-
lion SketchUp users worldwide. He has taught architecture at the university
level and, at Google, works on ways to mediate between power and usability;
he believes the best software in the world isn’t worth a darn if nobody can
figure out how it works. Aidan is based in Boulder, Colorado, even though he
is what many would consider to be the diametric opposite of a world-class
endurance athlete.


Dedication
For my parents, Jenny and Shab, and my brother, Quincy, because I love them
very much.
Author’s Acknowledgments
For helping in all the ways that it is possible to help with a book — 
offering technical advice, lending a critical ear, providing moral support 
and encouragement — I’d like to thank Sandra Winstead, with whom I live
and work. It’s rare to find everything you need in a single person, and I can’t
imagine having written this book without her.
I’d like to thank Chris Dizon for agreeing to be the Technical Editor for this
volume; I can’t think of anyone who brings more enthusiasm and curiosity 
to everything he does. As a dyed-in-the-wool SketchUpper who uses the soft-
ware even more than I do, I knew he’d do a bang-up job of keeping me honest,
and he did.
I thank Kyle Looper, Becky Huehls, and John Edwards, my editors at Wiley,
for making what I fully expected to be a painful process not so at all. It was a
delight to work with a team of such intelligent, thoughtful, and well-meaning
professionals; I only hope I’m half as lucky on the next book I write.
Finally, I need to thank the very long list of individuals who provided critical
help. From clearing the way for me to be able to write this book to patiently
explaining things more than once, I owe the following people (and almost 
certainly a few more) a whole lot: Tommy Acierno, Brad Askins, John Bacus,
Brian Brewington, Brian Brown, Todd Burch, Chris Campbell, Mark Carvalho,
Chris Cronin, Steve Dapkus, Jonathan Dormondy, Bill Eberle, Joe Esch, Rich
Feit, Jody Gates, Toshen Golias, Scott Green, Barry Janzen, Tyson Kartchner,
Chris Keating, Mark Limber, Allyson McDuffie, Millard McQuaid, Tyler Miller,
Parker Mitchell, Alok Priyadarshi, Brad Schell, Mike Springer, Tricia Starr,
Bryce Stout, James Therrien, Mason Thrall, Nancy Trigg, Tushar Udeshi, 
John Ulmer, David Vicknair, Greg Wirt, and Tom Wyman.

Introduction
A
little while ago, I was teaching a workshop on advanced SketchUp tech-
niques to a group of extremely bright middle and high school (or so I
thought) students in Hot Springs, Arkansas. As subject matter went, I wasn’t
pulling any punches — we were breezing through material I wouldn’t think of
introducing to most groups of adults. At one point, a boy raised his hand to
ask a question, and I noticed he looked younger than most of the others.
Squinting, I read a logo on his T-shirt that told me he was in elementary
school. “You’re in sixth grade?” I asked, a little stunned. These kids were
motoring, after all. The boy didn’t even look up. He shook his head, double-
clicked something, and mumbled, “Third.” He was 8 years old.
SketchUp was invented back in 1999 by a couple of 3D industry veterans
(or refugees, depending on your perspective) to make it easier for people to
see their ideas in three dimensions. That was it, really — they just wanted to
make a piece of software that anyone could use to build 3D models. What I
saw in Arkansas makes me think they were successful.
Before it was acquired in 2006 by Google, SketchUp cost $495 a copy, and it
was already a mainstay of architects’ and other designers’ software toolkits.
No other 3D modeler was as easy to understand as SketchUp, meaning that
even senior folks (many of whom thought their CD/DVD trays were cup hold-
ers) started picking it up. These days, SketchUp is being used at home, in
school, and at work by anyone with a need to represent 3D information the
way it’s meant to be represented: in 3D. Google SketchUp (as it’s now called)
is available as a free download in six languages, and is just as popular inter-
nationally as it is in North America.
About This Book
The thing I like least about software is figuring out how it works. I once saw
a movie where the main character acquired knowledge by plugging a cable
(a rather fat cable, actually) into a hole in the back of his head. A computer
then uploaded new capabilities — languages, martial arts, fashion sense
(apparently) — directly into his brain. Afterward, the character ate a snack
and took a nap. That’s how I wish I could get to know new software.
This book, on the other hand, is a fairly analog affair. In it, I do my best to
guide you through the process of building 3D models with SketchUp. I wrote
this book for people who are new to 3D modeling, so I don’t assume you
know anything about polygons, vertices, or linear arrays. The nice thing is

that the people who make SketchUp don’t assume you know any of those
things, either. That means I don’t have to spend many words explaining theo-
retical concepts, which I think we can both appreciate.
I don’t think many people want to use software just for the sake of using soft-
ware. You probably didn’t learn to drive just because you thought seatbelts
and turn signals were cool; I’m betting you wanted to be able to get around
in a car. People use SketchUp so that they can build 3D models. As such,
most of this book focuses on what you can do with SketchUp, and not what
SketchUp does. Naturally, this has a few implications:
 I use the word you a lot. You’re reading this book because you have
something you want to build in 3D on your computer, and you think
SketchUp can help you do that. I try to keep this in mind by letting you
know how you can use the features I talk about to do what you want to do.
 I err on the side of architecture. The fact is, a lot of people want to use
SketchUp to model buildings, so I’m assuming that a good many of you
(the collective you, in this case) want to do the same. You can use
SketchUp to build just about anything you want, but to ignore the fact
that it’s extra-great for architecture would be silly.
 I don’t cover everything SketchUp can do. If this book were about
SketchUp, and not modeling with SketchUp, I would list every feature,
every tool, and every command in exhaustive detail. I would tell you
exactly what every radio button and slider bar was for. I would, in effect,
just copy the documentation that comes with SketchUp (available in the
Help menu) and call it a day. In writing this book, I had to make a tough
choice: I had to figure out what to show you and, more importantly, what
to leave out. The Table of Contents I settled on is a list of what most
people want to know, most of the time.
Just in case you’re interested, here’s what didn’t make the cut (and why):
• The Dimension and Label tools: I left these out because they’re
so simple to use that I didn’t think they needed any explanation.
That’s not to say they’re not great — they are. It’s just that this
book could only be so long. . . .
• The Sandbox tools: These are a group of tools developed specifi-
cally for creating and editing terrain — the stuff you put buildings
on if you don’t live in Kansas. The trouble with the Sandbox tools
is they’re not simple to use, which would have meant giving them
their own chapter. Because SketchUp can import terrain directly
from Google Earth (see Chapter 11), I left them out.
• The 3D Text tool: This one is a new feature in SketchUp 6. It’s 
fantastic, and tons of folks have been clamoring for it for years.
Why isn’t it in this book? Like the Dimension and Label tools, it’s
too easy to use. Just try it out and you’ll see what I mean.

• Ruby: Actually, I do talk a little bit about Ruby, but only in
Chapter 17, which is practically at the end of the book. Ruby is a
scripting (programming) language that you (maybe) can use to code
your own tools for SketchUp. I think that says it all, don’t you?
One more thing: Because SketchUp is a cross-platform program (meaning that
it’s available for both Windows and Macintosh computers), I make reference
to both operating systems throughout this book. In most cases, SketchUp
works the same in Windows and on a Mac, but where it doesn’t, I point out
the differences. Just so you know, any figures in this book that show the
SketchUp user interface show the Windows version.
Foolish Assumptions
I mentioned earlier that I don’t presume you know anything about 3D model-
ing, much less 3D modeling with SketchUp, in this book. That’s true — you’re
safe even if you call SketchUp “Sketch’em-Up” (which I’ve heard more than
once, believe it or not). If you happen to know a thing or two about SketchUp,
I think you’ll still find plenty of useful stuff in this book. Even though it’s written
with beginners in mind, I’ve included a lot that definitely isn’t beginner-level
information. I mean for this book to be useful for people with just about any
level of SketchUp skill.
That said, I assume you’re familiar with a few important concepts. To begin
with, I assume you know how to work your computer well enough to under-
stand how to do basic things like saving and opening files. I don’t cover those
things in this book because SketchUp handles them just like every other pro-
gram does. If you’re trying to model with SketchUp and figure out how to use
a computer at the same time, Wiley has some excellent books that can help
you out, such as Windows Vista For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone, or Mac OS X
Leopard For Dummies, by Bob LeVitus, just to name two; visit www.dummies.
com for other options.
Next, I take for granted that you have, and know how to work, a mouse with
a scroll wheel. If you’re using Windows, you probably do, but Mac users
(I’m ashamed to say) are a little late to the party when it comes to the won-
ders of multibutton mousing. SketchUp all but requires you to have a scroll
wheel mouse — especially when you’re just starting out. The good news for
folks who don’t have one is that they’re fairly cheap. Just look for something
with a left button, a right button, and a little scroll wheel in the middle.
Finally, I assume you have at least occasional access to the Internet. Don’t
panic! Unlike most Google applications, you don’t have to be online to use
SketchUp — I do most of my best work on airplanes, in fact. You can find
some great resources on the Web, though, and I point them out when I think
they’re important.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
Tell me if you think this is strange: I read most computer books in completely
random order. I never start at the beginning and work my way through. In
fact, I only pick them up for two reasons:
 To figure something out: I like to have a book on hand when I’m begin-
ning something new because I like the way books work. If I need help, I
look it up, but something else invariably happens — I end up reading
more than I needed to, and I usually end up finding out something I
didn’t even know I didn’t know. That almost never happens when I use
digital media; it’s too good at providing me with just the answer to my
question. Computers are lousy for browsers like me.
 To kill time: I hate to admit this, but I don’t usually keep my computer
books anywhere near my computer. I keep them in the bathroom, because
my bathroom has excellent light for reading and because I’m afraid that
a television would fall in the bathtub and electrocute me. When I’m just
killing time, I open my book to a random page and start reading.
Despite these two facts, this book does have structure. Basic concepts are
grouped in the first few chapters, and more advanced material appears
toward the end. Chapter 3 is entirely devoted to a step-by-step approach to
getting started, just for those who like to get to know software that way.
In general, though, this book is intended to be a reference. If you keep reading
from this page on, right to the end of the index, you’ll have a pretty good idea
of how to use SketchUp to make 3D models — but that isn’t what I’m expect-
ing you to do. I recommend that you start with Chapters 1 and 2, just to get
your bearings. After that, you should use the Table of Contents or the index
to find what you’re looking for; then proceed from there.
To make it easier to understand how certain chapters are related, this book
lumps them together into parts. Check out the following summaries to get an
idea of what’s in each one.
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp
If you’re completely new to SketchUp and 3D modeling, this is the most
important part in this book. Start here, lest you get frustrated and decide to
use these pages to line your rabbit coop. Chapter 1 talks about how SketchUp
fits into the bigger 3D modeling picture. Chapter 2 lays out all — that’s 100
percent — of the basic concepts you need to understand to do anything
useful with SketchUp. Chapter 3 offers a basic end-to-end workflow for 
4
Google SketchUp For Dummies 

creating and sharing a model. You can skip it, but I think it’s a nice way to
ease into the program.
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp
SketchUp is a 3D modeling tool, so this part is, in Shakespeare’s eternal
words, “where it’s at.” Chapter 4 dives right into using SketchUp to make
buildings, with an emphasis on drawing and extruding simple plans, model-
ing stairs, and constructing roofs. This isn’t easy, mind you, but it’s what a lot
of people want to use SketchUp to do, so I put it right at the beginning.
Chapter 5 deals with tools you can use to manage big models, and Chapter 6
lays out advanced techniques for modeling things like cars, furniture, and
other objects. In Chapter 7, I talk about using photographs in SketchUp.
The second part of the chapter is all about Photo Match, maybe the best
new feature since Follow Me came out in version 4.
Part III: Viewing Your Model 
in Different Ways
Making models in SketchUp is only half the fun. The chapters in this part pre-
sent some of this software’s truly unique presentation features. Chapter 8
dives into Styles, a brand-new feature in SketchUp 6. If you ever need to show
your model to anyone, you should pay special attention to Chapter 9, which
is all about using shadows. Also, don’t skip the first part of Chapter 10 on
using sections to create animations — it’s easy and more rewarding than
almost anything else you can do in SketchUp.
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made
These chapters are dedicated to getting your models out into the world.
In Chapter 11, I talk about using SketchUp with Google Earth, which, if
you haven’t tried it, is reason in itself to have a fast Internet connection.
Chapters 12 and 13 deal with printing and exporting images and movies from
your model files. Chapter 14 is all about using SketchUp Pro to export files in
a bunch of different formats so that you can transfer data to any number of
other CAD, modeling, rendering, illustration, and animation applications.
Chapter 15 is an introduction to LayOut. This whole-new program, which is
also part of SketchUp Pro, is for creating 2D presentation documents that
automatically link to your 3D models.

Introduction

Part V: The Part of Tens
My favorite thing about books in the For Dummies series is the way they
embrace people’s love of lists. I could have spread the information contained
in these ultra-short chapters throughout the entire book, but it’s so much
easier to read when it’s all in one place, don’t you think?
Chapter 16 is a list of ten things that you’ll definitely struggle with when
you’re first using SketchUp; remember to check here before you do anything
drastic. Chapter 17 lists great add-ons that’ll make your SketchUping more
enjoyable, and Chapter 18 is all about where to turn when the information
you need isn’t in this book.
Icons Used in This Book
This icon indicates a piece of information I think will probably save you time.
When you’re working in SketchUp, you need to know a lot of things. I use the
Remember icon to remind you of something I cover earlier in the book, just in
case you might have forgotten (or skipped) it.
Everyone’s a little bit of a nerd sometimes, and paragraphs that bear this
icon indulge that nerdiness. You can skip them without fear of missing any-
thing important, but reading them can give you something to annoy your
SketchUp friends with later on.
When you see this icon, pay special attention. It occurs rarely, but when it
does, something you do could harm your work.
This icon denotes a spot where you can find supporting material on this
book’s companion Web site, including videos, sample files, and links to help-
ful material, which you can find at www.dummies.com/go/SketchUpFD.

with SketchUp

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book is dedicated to helping you get
your bearings. It’s not a step-by-step guide to starting
a new file in SketchUp; instead, it provides a little bit of
information about what SketchUp is, what you can use it
to do, and how to get the most out of it.
Chapter 1 is a very general overview of Google SketchUp. 
I try not to bore you with too much background informa-
tion, but here’s where you can read about what the soft-
ware is supposed to let you do, how it compares to other
3D modeling applications, and where everything is.
In Chapter 2, I jump right in; there are a few things about
SketchUp you absolutely need to know when you’re just
getting started, and here’s where I lay them out. I think
this is the most important chapter in this book; read it,
and you’ll know more about SketchUp than millions of
other folks who already use it every day.
The contents of Chapter 3 are included for the benefit of
those readers who like to learn software by getting their
hands dirty right away. The whole chapter is a workflow
that takes you through the process of making a simple
model, changing the way it looks, and creating an image 
of it that you can keep forever.

 Finding out what you can and can’t do with SketchUp
 Looking around the application
O
nce upon a time, software for building three-dimensional (3D) models of
thing like buildings, cars, and other stuff was hard to use. I mean really
hard — people went to school for years to learn it. And if that wasn’t bad
enough, 3D modeling software was expensive. It was so expensive that the
only people who used it were professionals and software pirates (people who
stole it, basically). Then along came SketchUp.
Operating under the assumption that lots of people might want — and need —
to make 3D models, the folks who invented SketchUp decided to design a 
program that worked more intuitively. Instead of making you think about 3D
models as complex mathematical constructs (the way computers think), they
created an interface that lets you build models using elements you’re already
familiar with: lines and shapes.
So do you need to know how to draw to use SketchUp? In the latest version of
the software, not really. Traditional drawing is about translating what you see
onto a flat piece of paper: going from 3D to 2D, which is hard to do for most
people. In SketchUp, you’re always in 3D, so no translation is involved — you
just build, and SketchUp takes care of stuff like perspective and shading for you.
This first chapter is about putting SketchUp in context: why Google offers it
for free, how it compares to other 3D software, and what you can (and can’t)
use it to do. In the last part of the chapter, I give a quick tour of the program,
just to let you know where things are.

Things You Ought to Know Right Away
Before I continue, here’s some information you might need:
 You get SketchUp by downloading it from the Internet. Just type
http://sketchup.google.com into your Web browser and read
through the first page of the Google SketchUp Web site. Click the links to
download the application to your computer, and then follow the installa-
tion instructions on the Web.
 SketchUp works in Windows and Mac OS X. Google SketchUp is avail-
able for both operating systems, and it looks (and works) about the
same way on both.
 A Pro version is available. Google offers a Pro version of SketchUp
(called Google SketchUp Pro) that you can buy if you need it. It includes
a few terrific features that folks like architects, production designers,
and other design professionals need for exchanging files with other soft-
ware. SketchUp Pro also includes a whole new application for creating
presentation documents with your SketchUp models. It’s called LayOut,
and it’s the subject of Chapter 15. If you think you might need Pro, you
can download a free trial version at http://sketchup.google.com.
Where SketchUp Fits in Google’s World
A long time ago, somebody invented photography (hey — this isn’t a history
book), and all of a sudden there was a way to make pictures of things that
didn’t involve drawing, engraving, or painting. Nowadays, you can’t throw a
rock without hitting a photograph of something. Everything (it seems) can
take pictures, including people’s phones. Photography is the main way that
visual information is communicated.
But what comes after photography? Google (and just about every science-
fiction writer who ever lived) thinks it’s 3D, and here’s why: You live in 3D.
The furniture you buy (or build) is 3D, and so is the route you take to work.
Because so many of the decisions you need to make (buying a couch, finding
your way) involve 3D information, wouldn’t it be nice to be able to experi-
ence that information in 3D?
Software like SketchUp lets you see 3D information on a 2D screen, which is
good, but affordable 3D printers and holography (yep, holograms) are just
over the horizon. All that’s left is to build a model of every single thing in the
world — and guess who’s going to do it?
10
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

You. By making SketchUp free for everyone, Google is leading the 3D charge.
Rather than relying on a small number of 3D nerds to get around to modeling
everything in the universe, Google made SketchUp available to anyone
who wants to participate. After all, Google is about organizing the world’s
information — not creating it. By giving SketchUp away, the company has 
created a whole new kind of information to organize. Chapter 11 is all about
SketchUp and Google Earth, as well as the Google 3D Warehouse, where the
world’s 3D information is being stored — at least for now.
Comparing SketchUp to Other 
3D Modeling Programs
If you’re reading this book, I presume you’re at least interested in two things:
building 3D models and using SketchUp to do so. The following sections
tell you something about how SketchUp compares to other 3D modeling 
programs — how long it takes to figure out how to use it and what kind of
models it produces.
Cruising up the shallow learning curve
When it comes to widely available 3D modeling software, it really doesn’t get
any easier than SketchUp. This software has been as successful as it has for
one reason, and it has everything to do with how quickly people are able to
get good enough at SketchUp to build something within a couple of hours of
launching it for the first time. You have no thick manuals to read, no special
geometric concepts to understand; modeling in SketchUp is about grabbing
your mouse and jumping in.
So how long should it take you to discover how it works? It depends on your
background and experience, but in general, you can expect to be able to
make something recognizable in under four hours. That’s not to say you’ll be
a whiz — it just means that SketchUp’s learning curve is extremely shallow.
You don’t need to know much to get started, and you’ll still be picking things
up years from now. In fact, I’ve learned a couple of things just writing this book.
But is SketchUp easy? Lots of people say so, but I think it’s all relative. SketchUp
is without a doubt easier than any other modeling program I’ve tried, but 3D
modeling itself can be tricky. Some people catch on right away, and some folks
take longer. But I can say this for sure: If you want to build 3D models, and you
have an afternoon to spare, there’s no better place to start than SketchUp.
11
Chapter 1: Meeting Google SketchUp

Understanding the difference 
between paper and clay
Three-dimensional modeling software comes in two basic flavors: solids and
surfaces. Figure 1-1 and the following points illustrate the difference:
 SketchUp is a “surfaces” modeler. Everything in SketchUp is basically
made up of thin (infinitely thin, actually) surfaces — these are called
faces. Even things that look thick (like cinder-block walls) are actually
hollow shells. Making models in SketchUp is a lot like building things out
of paper — really, really thin paper.
Surface modelers like SketchUp are great for making models quickly,
because all you really need to worry about is modeling what things
look like. That’s not to say that they’re less capable; it’s just that they’re
primarily intended for visualization.
 Using a “solids” modeler is more like working with clay. When you cut a
solid model in half, you create new surfaces where you cut; that’s because
objects are, well, solid. Programs like SolidWorks, Form(Z, and Inventor
create solid models.
People who make parts — like mechanical engineers and industrial
designers — tend to work with solid models because they can use them
to do some pretty precise calculations. Being able to calculate the
volume of an object means that you can figure how much it will weigh,
for example. Also, special machines can produce real-life prototypes
directly from a solid-model file. These prototypes are handy for seeing
how lots of little things are going to fit together.
An important point to reinforce here is that there’s no “best” type of model-
ing software. It all depends on three things: how you like to work, what you’re
modeling, and what you plan to do with your model when it’s done.
When I said (a few paragraphs ago) that 3D modeling programs come in two
basic flavors, I sort of lied. The truth is, you can split them into two groups
another way as well: by the kind of math they use to produce 3D models.
You can find polygonal modelers (of which SketchUp is an example) and
Surface models are hollow
Solid models are solid
Figure 1-1:
SketchUp

12
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

curves-based modelers. The former type uses straight lines and flat surfaces
to define everything — even things that look curvy, aren’t. The latter kind of
modeler uses true curves to define lines and surfaces. These yield organic,
flowing forms that are much more realistic than those produced by polygonal
modelers, but that put a lot more strain on the computers that have to run
them — and the people who have to figure out how to use them. Ultimately,
it’s a trade-off between simplicity and realism.
What You Should (and Shouldn’t)
Expect SketchUp to Do
Have you ever been to a hardware store and noticed the “multitool” gizmos
on the racks next to the checkout stands? I once saw one that was a combina-
tion screwdriver, pliers, saw, tape measure, and (I swear) hammer. I some-
times wonder whether the hardware-store people put them there as a joke,
just to make you feel better about standing in line.
I generally don’t like tools that claim to be able to do everything. I much
prefer specialists — tools that are designed for doing one thing really well.
In the case of SketchUp, that one thing is building 3D models. Here’s a list
of things (all model-building-related) that you can do with SketchUp:
 Start a model in lots of different ways: With SketchUp, you can begin a
model in whatever way makes sense for what you’re building:
• From scratch: When you first launch SketchUp, you see nothing
except a little person standing in the middle of your screen. If you
want, you can even delete him, leaving you a completely blank
slate on which to model anything you want.
• In Google Earth: Chapter 11 goes into this in detail. Basically, you
can bring an aerial photograph of any place on Earth (including
your home) into SketchUp and start modeling right on top of it.
• From a photograph: The second part of Chapter 7 talks all about
how you can use SketchUp to build a model based on a photo of
the thing you want to build. It’s not really a beginner-level feature,
but it’s there.
• With another computer file: SketchUp can import images and CAD
(computer-aided drawing) files so that you can use them as a start-
ing point for what you want to make.
 Work loose or work tight: One of my favorite things about SketchUp is
that you can model without worrying about exactly how big something
is. You can make models that are super-sketchy, but if you want, you can
also make models that are absolutely precise. SketchUp is just like paper
in that way; the amount of detail you add is entirely up to you.
13
Chapter 1: Meeting Google SketchUp

 Build something real or make something up: What you build with
SketchUp really isn’t the issue. You only work with lines and shapes — in
SketchUp, they’re called edges and faces — so how you arrange them is
your business. SketchUp isn’t intended for making buildings any more
than it is for creating other things. It’s just a tool for drawing in three
dimensions.
 Share your models: After you’ve made something you want to show off,
you can do a number of things, which you can discover in detail in Part IV:
• Print: Yep, you can print from SketchUp.
• Export images: If you want to generate an image file of a particular
view, you can export one in any of several popular formats.
• Export movies: Animations are a great way to present three-
dimensional information, and SketchUp can create them easily.
• Upload to the 3D Warehouse: This is a giant, online repository of
SketchUp models that you can add to (and take from) all you want.
What can’t SketchUp do? A few things, actually — but that’s okay. SketchUp
was designed from the outset to be the friendliest, fastest, and most useful
modeler available — and that’s it, really. Fantastic programs are available
that do the things in the following list, and SketchUp can exchange files with
most of them:
 Photorealistic rendering: Most 3D modelers have their own, built-in photo
renderers, but creating model views that look like photographs is a pretty
specialized undertaking. SketchUp has always focused on something
called nonphotorealistic rendering (NPR), instead. NPR (as it’s known) is
essentially technology that makes things look hand-drawn — sort of the
opposite of photorealism. If you want to make realistic views of your
models, I talk about some renderers that work great with SketchUp in
Chapter 17.
 Animation: A few paragraphs ago, I mentioned that SketchUp can export
animations, but that’s a different thing. The movies that you can make
with SketchUp involve moving your “camera” around your model. True
animation software lets you move the things inside your model around.
SketchUp doesn’t do that, but the Pro version lets you export to a
number of different programs that do.
 Building Information Modeling (BIM): I’ll try to keep this short. BIM
software lets you make models that automatically keep track of things
like quantities, and automatically generate standard drawing views
(plans and sections) from your model. SketchUp lets you draw edges
and faces, but it has no earthly idea what you’re drawing — that’s just
not how it works. You can use SketchUp with all the major BIM packages
out there (via special importers and exporters), but it won’t do BIM stuff
on its own.

Taking the Ten-Minute SketchUp Tour
The point of this portion of the chapter is to show you where everything is —
kind of like the way a parent shows a new babysitter around the house before
leaving for a couple of hours. It’s not meant to explain what anything does,
per se. I just want you to feel like you know where to start looking when you
find yourself hunting around for something.
Just like most programs you already use, SketchUp has five main parts.
Figure 1-2 shows all of them, in both the Windows and Mac versions of the
program. I describe these parts, plus an additional feature, in the following list:

Chapter 1: Meeting Google SketchUp
Is it a toaster or a bungalow?
SketchUp models are made from two basic
kinds of geometry: edges (which are straight
lines) and faces (which are 2D surfaces bound
by edges). That’s it. When you use SketchUp to
draw a bunch of edges and faces in the shape
of a staircase, all SketchUp knows is how many
edges and faces it has to keep track of, and
where they all go. There’s no such thing as a
stair in SketchUp — just edges and faces.
Coming to this realization has the tendency to
freak some people out. If you want a model of
something, you have to make it out of edges and
faces. SketchUp has some nice tools that let
you create, delete, and otherwise arrange your
geometry to make anything you want, but no Stair
Tool is available to help you make stairs. Ditto for
walls, windows, doors, or any of the other things
that specialized architecture software programs
offer. The thing to remember is that SketchUp
was created to let you model anything, not just
buildings, so its tools are designed to manipulate
geometry. That’s good news, believe it or not,
because it means that you’re not restricted in any
way; you can model anything you can imagine.

 Modeling window: See the big area in the middle of your computer
screen? That’s your modeling window, and it’s where you spend 99 per-
cent of your time in SketchUp. You build your model there; it’s sort of a
frame into a 3D world inside your computer. What you see in your mod-
eling window is always a 3D view of your model, even if you happen to
be looking at it from the top or side.
 Menu bar: For anyone who has used a computer in the last 30 years,
the menu bar is nothing new. Each menu contains a long list of options,
commands, tools, settings, and other goodies that pertain to just about
everything you do in SketchUp.
 Toolbars: These contain buttons that you can click to activate tools and
commands; they are faster than using the menu bar. SketchUp has a few
different toolbars, but only one is visible when you launch it the first
time: the Getting Started toolbar.
If your modeling window is too narrow to show all the tools on the
Getting Started toolbar, you can click the arrow on the right to see the
rest of them.
 Dialog boxes: Some programs call them palettes and some call them
inspectors; SketchUp doesn’t call them anything. Its documentation (the
SketchUp Help document you can get to in the Help menu) refers to
some of them as managers and some as dialog boxes, but I thought I’d
keep things simple and just call them all the same thing: dialog boxes.
 Status bar: You can consider this your SketchUp dashboard, I suppose.
It contains contextual information you use while you’re modeling.
 Context menus: Right-clicking things in your modeling window usually
causes a context menu of commands and options to open. These are
always relevant to whatever you happen to right-click (and whatever
you’re doing at the time), so the contents of each context menu are 
different.
Although the following items aren’t part of the SketchUp user interface (all
the stuff I just listed in the previous list), they’re a critical part of modeling in
SketchUp:
 A mouse with a scroll wheel: You usually find a left button (the one you
use all the time), a right button (the one that opens the context menus),
and a center scroll wheel that you both roll back and forth and click
down like a button. You should get one if you don’t already have one —
it’ll improve your SketchUp experience more than any single other thing
you could buy.
16
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

 A keyboard: This sounds silly, but some people have tried to use
SketchUp without one; it’s just not possible. So many of the things you
need to do all the time (like make copies) involve your keyboard, so
you’d better have one handy if you’re planning to use SketchUp.
Hanging out at the menu bar
SketchUp’s menus are a pretty straightforward affair; you won’t find anything
surprising like “Launch Rocket” in any of them, unfortunately. All the same,
here’s what they contain:
 File: Includes options for creating, opening, and saving SketchUp files.
It’s also where to go if you want to import or export a file, or make a
printout of your model view.
 Edit: Has all the commands that affect the bits of your model that are
selected.
 View: This one’s a little tricky. You’d think it would contain all the
options for flying around in 3D space, but it doesn’t — that stuff’s on the
Camera menu. Instead, the View menu includes all the controls you use
to affect the appearance of your model itself: what’s visible, how faces
look, and so on. View also contains settings for turning on and off cer-
tain elements of SketchUp’s user interface.
 Camera: Contains controls for viewing your model from different angles.
In SketchUp, your “camera” is your point of view, literally.
 Draw: Includes tools for drawing edges and faces in your modeling
window.
 Tools: Most of SketchUp’s tools are contained here, except of course for
the ones you use for drawing.
 Window: If you’re ever wondering where to find a dialog box you want
to use, this is the place to look; they’re all right here.
 Plugins: You can get extra tools for SketchUp — little programs that
“plug in” to it and add functionality. Some of them show up here after
they’re installed. Chapter 17 has some information on these.
 Help: Chapter 18 is all about this menu, but here’s the short version: Help
contains some incredibly useful resources for understanding SketchUp
as you go along. Pay particular attention to the video tutorials — they’re
great.
17
Chapter 1: Meeting Google SketchUp

Checking the status bar
Even though the big part in the middle is the most obvious part, there’s
plenty more to the modeling window that you should know about:
 Context-specific instructions: Most of the time, you check here to see
what options might be available for whatever you’re doing. Modifier keys
(keyboard strokes that you use in combination with certain tools to 
perform additional functions), step-by-step instructions, and general
information about what you’re doing all show up in one place: right here.
 The Value Control Box (VCB): The VCB is where numbers show up (to
put it as simply as I can). Chapter 2 goes into more detail about it, but
the basic purpose of the VCB is to allow you to be precise while you’re
modeling.
Taking a peek at the dialog boxes
Most graphics programs have a ton of little controller boxes that float around
your screen, and SketchUp is no exception. After the dialog boxes are open,
you can “dock” them together by moving them close to each other, but most
people I know end up with them all over the place — me included. Dialog
boxes in SketchUp contain controls for all kinds of things; here are some of
the ones that I think deserve special attention:

Where are all the tools?
The Getting Started toolbar contains a small
subset of the tools that you can use in
SketchUp. The thinking (which I agree with,
incidentally) is that seeing all the tools right
away tends to overwhelm new users, so having
a limited selection helps people out.
To get access to more tools (through toolbars,
anyway — you can always access everything
through the menus), you do different things,
depending on which operating system you’re
using:
 Windows: Choose View➪Toolbars. The
mother lode! I recommend starting off with
the Large Tool Set to begin with, and then
adding toolbars as you need them (and as
you figure out what they do).
 Mac: Choose View➪Tool Palettes➪Large
Tool Set. To add even more tools, right-click
the Getting Started toolbar (the one right
above your modeling window) and choose
Customize Toolbar. Now drag whatever
tools you want onto your toolbar, and click
the Done button.

 Preferences: While the Model Info dialog box (see the next point) 
contains settings for the SketchUp file you have open right now, the
Preferences dialog box has controls for how SketchUp behaves no matter
what file you have open. Pay particular attention to the Shortcuts panel,
where you can set up keyboard shortcuts for any tool or command in
the program.
On the Mac, the Preferences dialog box is on the SketchUp menu, which
doesn’t exist in the Windows version of SketchUp.
Some Preference settings changes don’t take effect until you open
another SketchUp file, so don’t worry if you can’t see a difference
right away.
 Model Info: This dialog box is, to quote the bard, the mother of all
dialog boxes. It has controls for everything under the sun; you should
definitely open it and take your time going through it. Chances are, the
next time you can’t find the setting you’re looking for, it’s in Model Info.
 Entity Info: This little guy is small, but it shows information about 
entities — edges, faces, groups, components, and lots of other things —
in your model. Keeping it open is a good idea, because it helps you see
what you have selected.
 Instructor: The Instructor only does one thing: It shows you how to
use whatever tool happens to be activated. While you’re discovering
SketchUp, you should keep the Instructor dialog box open off to the
side. It’s a pretty cool way to know about all the things the tool you’re
“holding” can do.

hen you were learning how to drive a car, you probably didn’t just get
behind the wheel, step on the gas, and figure it out as you went along.
(If you did, you probably have bigger things to worry about than getting
started with SketchUp.) My point is, you should really know several things
before you get started. This chapter is dedicated to introducing those things —
concepts, really — that can make your first few hours with SketchUp a lot
more productive and fun.
So here’s the deal: I’ve divided this chapter into three main parts:
 The first part talks about edges and faces — the basic stuff that
SketchUp models are made of.
 The second part deals with the way SketchUp lets you work in 3D (three
dimensions) on a 2D (flat) surface — namely, your computer screen.
Understanding how SketchUp represents depth is everything when it

comes to making models. If you’ve never used 3D modeling software
before, pay close attention to the middle part of this chapter.
 The final part of this chapter is all about the things you need to do all
the time — things like navigating around your model, drawing lines,
selecting objects, and working with accurate measurements.
It’s All about Edges and Faces
In SketchUp, everything is made up of one of two kinds of things: edges and
faces. They’re the basic building blocks of every model you’ll ever make.
Collectively, the edges and faces in your model are called geometry. When
someone (including me) refers to geometry, we’re talking about edges and
faces. Other modeling programs have other kinds of geometry, but SketchUp
is pretty simple. That’s a good thing — there’s less to keep track of.
The drawing on the left in Figure 2-1 is a basic cube drawn in SketchUp.
It’s composed of 12 edges and 6 faces. The model on the right is a lot more
complex, but the geometry’s the same: It’s all just edges and faces.
Living on (with, actually) the edge
Edges are lines. You can use lots of different tools to draw them, erase them,
move them around, hide them, and even stretch them out. Here are some
things you ought to know about SketchUp edges:
 Edges are always straight. Not only is everything in your SketchUp
model made up of edges, but all those edges are also perfectly straight.
Even arcs and circles are made of small straight-line segments, as shown
in Figure 2-2.

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

 Edges don’t have a thickness. This one’s a little tricky to get your head
around. You never have to worry about how thick the edges in your model
are because that’s just not how SketchUp works. Depending on how you
choose to display your model, your edges may look like they have differ-
ent thicknesses, but your edges themselves don’t have a built-in thick-
ness. You can read more about making your edges look thick in Chapter 8.
 Just because you can’t see the edges doesn’t mean they’re not there.
Edges can be hidden so that you can’t see them; doing so is a popular
way to make certain forms. Take a look at Figure 2-3. On the left is a
model that looks rounded. On the right, I’ve made the hidden edges visi-
ble as dashed lines — see how even surfaces that look smoothly curved
are made of straight edges?
Facing the facts about faces
Faces are surfaces. If you think of SketchUp models as being made of tooth-
picks and paper (which they kind of are), faces are basically the paper. Here’s
what you need to know about them:
These edges are smoothed, but still there

23
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

 You can’t have faces without edges. To have a face, you need to have at
least three coplanar (on the same plane) edges that form a loop. In other
words, a face is defined by the edges that surround it, and those edges
all have to be on the same, flat plane. Because you need at least three
straight lines to make a closed shape, faces must have at least three
sides. There’s no limit to the number of sides a SketchUp face can have,
though. Figure 2-4 shows what happens when you get rid of an edge that
defines one or more faces.
 Faces are always flat. In SketchUp, even surfaces that look curved are
made up of multiple, flat faces. In the model shown in Figure 2-5, you can
see that what looks like organically shaped surfaces (on the left) are
really just lots of smaller faces (on the right). To make a bunch of flat
faces look like one big, curvy surface, the edges between them are
smoothed; you can find out more about smoothing edges in Chapter 6.
 Just like edges, faces don’t have any thickness. If faces are a lot like
pieces of paper, they’re infinitely thin pieces of paper — they don’t have
any thickness. To make a thick surface (say, like a 6-inch-thick wall), you
need to use two faces side by side.
Each of these triangles is perfectly flat

flat, even the
ones that

surfaces.

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

Understanding the relationship 
between edges and faces
Now that you know that models are made from edges and faces, you’re most
of the way to understanding how SketchUp works. Here’s some information
that should fill in the gaps (and also check out additional resources on this
book’s companion Web site; see the Introduction for details about the site):
 Every time SketchUp can make a face, it will. There’s no such thing
as a “Face tool” in this software; SketchUp just automatically makes a
face every time you finish drawing a closed shape out of three or more
coplanar edges. Figure 2-6 shows this in action: As soon as I connect the
last edge that I draw to the first one to close the “loop,” SketchUp cre-
ates a face.
 You can’t stop SketchUp from creating faces, but you can erase them
if you want. If a face you don’t want ends up getting created, just right-
click it and choose Erase from the context menu. That face will be
deleted, but the edges that defined it will remain. (See Figure 2-7.)
Figure 2-7:
You can
delete a
face without
deleting the
edges that
define it.
Figure 2-6:
SketchUp
automati-
cally makes
a face
whenever
you create a
closed loop
of coplanar
edges.
25
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

 If you delete one of the edges that defines a face, that face will be
deleted, too. When I erase one of the edges in the cube (with the Eraser
tool, in this case), both of the faces that were defined by that edge disap-
pear. This happens because it’s impossible to have a face without also
having all its edges.
 Retracing an edge re-creates a missing face. If you already have a closed
loop of coplanar edges, but no face (because you erased it, perhaps),
you can redraw one of the edges to make a new face. Just use the Line
tool to trace over one of the edge segments, and a face will reappear.
(See Figure 2-8.)
 Drawing an edge all the way across a face splits the face in two.
When you draw an edge (like with the Line tool) from one side of a face
to another, you cut that face in two. The same thing happens when you
draw a closed loop of edges (like a rectangle) on a face — you end up
with two faces, one “inside” the other. In Figure 2-9, I split a face in two
with the Line tool, and then I extrude one of them out a little bit with the
Push/Pull tool.

26
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

 Drawing an edge that crosses another edge doesn’t automatically split
both edges. In the left side of Figure 2-10, I draw an edge that crosses
one of the edges that defines a face. Doing so doesn’t split any of the
edges, and more importantly, it doesn’t split the face. If I want to make
the edge I just drew into two edges, I need to retrace one of its segments
with the Line tool (as shown in the middle image of Figure 2-10). When I
do, I don’t just end up with two edges instead of one; I also end up split-
ting the face (as you can see in the right side of Figure 2-10).
Drawing in 3D on a 2D Screen
For computer programmers, letting you draw three-dimensional objects on
your screen is a difficult problem. You wouldn’t think it would be such a big
deal; after all, people have been drawing in perspective for a very long time.
If some old guy could figure it out 500 years ago, why should it give your com-
puter any problems?
The thing is, human perception of depth on paper is a trick of the eye. And of
course, your computer doesn’t have eyes that enable it to interpret depth
without thinking about it. You need to give it explicit instructions. In SketchUp,
this means using drawing axes and inferences, as I explain in the sections
that follow.
Drawing an edge from here...
...to here splits the face

Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

Giving instructions with the drawing axes
Color Plate 1 is a shot of the SketchUp modeling window, right after you create
a new file. See the three colored lines that cross in the lower-left corner of the
screen? These are the drawing axes, and they’re the key to understanding
how SketchUp works. Simply put, you use SketchUp’s drawing axes to figure
out where you are (and where you want to go) in 3D space. When you’re
working with the color axes, you need to keep two important things in mind:
 When you draw, move, or copy something parallel to one of the col-
ored axes, you’re working in that “color’s direction.” Take a look at
Color Plate 2. In the first image, I’m drawing a line parallel to the red
axis, so I would say I’m drawing “in the red direction.” I’m sure that the
line I’m drawing is parallel to the red axis because it turns red to let me
know. In the second image, I’m moving a box parallel to the blue axis, so
I’m “moving in the blue direction.” I know I’m parallel to the blue axis
because a dotted, blue line appears to tell me so.
The red and green axes define the ground plane in SketchUp, and the
blue axis is vertical.
 The whole point of using the red, green, and blue axes is to let SketchUp
know what you mean. Remember that the big problem with modeling
in 3D on a computer is the fact that you’re working on a 2D screen.
Consider the example shown in Color Plate 3: If I click the cylinder with

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Don’t worry about drawing in perspective
Contrary to popular belief, modeling in SketchUp
doesn’t involve drawing in perspective and let-
ting the software “figure out” what you mean.
There are two reasons for which this turns out
to be a very good thing:
 Computers aren’t very good at figuring out
what you’re trying to do. This has probably
happened to you: You’re working away at
your computer, and the software you’re
using tries to “help” by guessing what you’re
doing. Sometimes it works, but most of the
time it doesn’t, and eventually, it gets really
annoying. Even if SketchUp were able to
interpret your perspective drawings, you’d
probably spend more time correcting its
mistakes than actually building something.
 Most people can’t draw in perspective
anyway. I can see you nodding, because
even if you’re one of the few folks who can,
you know darn well that most people could-
n’t draw an accurate 3D view of the inside
of a room if their life depended on it —
drawing just isn’t one of the things we’re
taught, unfortunately. So even if SketchUp
did work by turning your 2D perspective
drawings into 3D models (which it most cer-
tainly doesn’t), the vast majority of those
who “can’t draw” wouldn’t be able to use it.
And that would be a shame, because build-
ing 3D models is a real kick.

the Move tool and move my cursor up, how is SketchUp supposed to
know whether I mean to move it up in space (above the ground) or back
in space? That’s where the colored axes come into play: If I want to
move it up, I go in the blue direction. If I want to move it back, I follow
the green direction (because the green axis happens to run from the
front to the back of my screen).
When you’re working in SketchUp, you use the colored drawing axes all
the time. They’re not just handy; they’re what makes SketchUp work.
Having colored axes (instead of ones labeled x, y, and z) lets you draw in
3D space without having to type in commands to tell your computer
where you want to draw. They make modeling in SketchUp quick, accu-
rate, and relatively intuitive. All you have to do is make sure that you’re
working in your intended color direction as you model by lining up your
objects with the axes and watching the screen tips that tell you what
direction you’re working in. After your first couple of hours with the soft-
ware, paying attention to the colors becomes second nature — I promise.
Keeping an eye out for inferences
If you’ve spent any time fiddling with SketchUp, you’ve noticed all the little
colored squares, dotted lines, yellow tags, and other doodads that show up
as you move your cursor around your modeling window. All this stuff is
referred to collectively as SketchUp’s inference engine, and its sole purpose is
to help you while you’re building models. Luckily, it does. Without inferences
(the aforementioned doodads), SketchUp wouldn’t be very useful.
Point inferences
Generally, SketchUp’s inferences help you be more precise. Point inferences
(see Color Plate 2-4) appear when you move your cursor over specific parts
of your model. They look like little colored squares, and if you pause for a
second, they’re accompanied by a yellow tag that says what they are. For
example, watching for the little green Endpoint inference (which appears
whenever your cursor is over one of the ends of an edge) helps you accu-
rately connect an edge you’re drawing to the end of another edge in your
model. Here’s a list of them (I don’t give descriptions because I think they’re
pretty self-explanatory):
 Endpoint (green)
 Midpoint (cyan or light blue)
 Intersection (black)
 On Edge (red)
 Center (of a circle, green)
 On Face (dark blue)
29
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

In SketchUp, lines are called edges, and surfaces are called faces. Everything
in your model is made up of edges and faces.
Linear inferences
As you’ve probably already noticed, color plays a big part in SketchUp’s user
interface (the way it looks). Maybe the best example of this is in the soft-
ware’s linear inferences — the “helper lines” that show up to help you work
more precisely. Color Plate 2-5 is an illustration of all of them in action, and
here’s a description of what they do:
 On Axis: When an edge you’re drawing is parallel to one of the colored
drawing axes, the edge turns the color of that axis.
 From Point: This one’s a little harder to describe. When you’re moving
your cursor, sometimes you’ll see a colored, dotted line appear. This
means that you’re “lined up” with the point at the end of the dotted line.
Naturally, the color of the From Point inference corresponds to whichever
axis you’re lined up “on.” Sometimes From Point inferences show up on
their own, and sometimes you have to encourage them; see the section
“Encouraging inferences,” later in this chapter, for details.
 Perpendicular: When you’re drawing an edge that’s perpendicular to
another edge, the one you’re drawing turns magenta (reddish purple).
 Parallel: When it’s parallel to another edge in your model, the edge
you’re drawing turns magenta to let you know. You tell SketchUp which
edge you’re interested in “being parallel to” by encouraging an inference.
 Tangent at Vertex: This one only applies when you’re drawing an arc
(using the Arc tool) that starts at the endpoint of another arc. When the
arc you’re drawing is tangent to the other one, the one you’re drawing
turns cyan. Tangent, in this case, means that the transition between the
two arcs is smooth.
One of the most important inferences in SketchUp is one that you probably
didn’t even realize was an inference. It’s the fact that, unless you specifically
start on an edge or a face in your model, you’ll always be drawing on the
ground plane by default. That’s right — if you just start creating stuff in the
middle of nowhere, SketchUp just assumes that you mean to be drawing on
the ground.
Using inferences to help you model
A big part of using SketchUp’s inference engine involves locking and encouraging
inferences — sometimes even simultaneously. At first, it’ll seem a little like
that thing where you pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time,
but with practice, it gets easier.
30
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

Locking inferences
If you hold down Shift when you see any of the first four types of linear infer-
ences described previously, that inference gets locked — and stays locked
until you release Shift. When you lock an inference, you constrain whatever
tool you’re using to only work in the direction of the inference you locked.
Confused? Check out the following example for some clarity.
Color Plate 6 shows a situation where it would be useful to lock a blue On
Axis inference while I’m using the Line tool. I want to draw a vertical line
that’s exactly as tall as the peak of the house’s roof, so here’s what I do:
1. Click once to start drawing an edge.
2. Move my cursor up until I see the edge I’m drawing turn blue.
This is the blue On Axis inference that lets me know I’m exactly parallel
to the blue drawing axis.
3. Hold down Shift to lock the inference I see.
My edge gets thicker to let me know it’s locked, and now I can only draw
in the blue direction (no matter where I move my cursor).
4. Click the peak of the roof to make my vertical edge end at exactly that
height.
5. Release Shift to unlock the inference.
Encouraging inferences
Sometimes, an inference you need doesn’t show up on its own — when this
happens, you have to encourage it. To encourage an inference, just hover your
cursor over the part of your model you’d like to “infer” from, and then slowly
go back to whatever you were doing when you decided you could use an infer-
ence. The following example demonstrates how to encourage an inference.
Color Plate 7 shows a model of a cylinder. I’d like to start drawing an edge
that lines up perfectly with the center of the circle on top of the cylinder, but
I don’t want it to start at the center itself. Follow these steps:
1. Hover (don’t click) over the edge of the circle for about two seconds.
2. Move slowly toward the middle of the circle until the Center Point
inference appears.
3. Hover (still don’t click) over the center point for a couple of seconds.
4. Move your cursor slowly in the direction of where you want to start
drawing your edge.
A dotted From Point inference should appear.
5. Click to start drawing your edge.

Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

Warming Up Your SketchUp Muscles
I can think of seven activities you’ll need to do every time you use SketchUp.
Formal-education types would probably call them “core competencies,” but I
find language like that tends to put people to sleep. Whatever you care to call
these activities, I’ll introduce them all at the same time, in the following sec-
tions, so you can come back and get a quick refresher whenever you want.
Getting the best view of what you’re doing
Using SketchUp without learning how to orbit, zoom, and pan is like trying to
build a ship in a bottle. In the dark. With your hands tied behind your back.
Using chopsticks. Get the picture?
Fully half of modeling in SketchUp uses the aforementioned navigation tools,
which let you change your view so that you can see what you’re doing. Most
people who try to figure out SketchUp on their own take too long to under-
stand this; they spend hours squinting, grunting, and having an all-around
miserable time trying to “get at” what they’re working on. The following sec-
tions help you avoid the headache (literally).
SketchUp has three tools that are dedicated to letting you get a better view of
your model. I usually call them the Big Three, but I’m a little afraid of lawsuits
from big companies in Detroit, so I’ll just refer to them collectively as the nav-
igation tools.
Going into orbit
Hold a glass of water in your hand. Now twist and turn your wrist around in
every direction so that the water’s all over you and the rest of the room. Stop
when the glass is completely empty. I think that’s a pretty memorable way to
find out about the Orbit tool, don’t you?
Just as your wrist helps you twist and turn a glass to see it from every angle,
think of using Orbit as the way to “fly around” your work. Figure 2-11 shows
Orbit in all its glory.
Here’s some stuff you should know about using Orbit:
 It’s on the Camera menu. By far the least productive way to use Orbit is
to choose it from the Camera menu.
 It’s also on the toolbar. The second-least productive way to activate
Orbit is to click its button on the toolbar. It looks like two red arrows
trying to form a ball.
32
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

 You can orbit using your mouse. Here’s how you should always orbit:
Click the scroll wheel of your mouse and hold it down. Now move your
mouse around. See your model swiveling around? Release the scroll
wheel when you’re done. Using your mouse to orbit means that you
don’t have to switch tools every time you want a better view, which
saves you truckloads of time.
Zooming in and out
Hold your empty glass at arm’s length. Close your eyes, and then bring the
glass rushing toward you, stopping right when it smashes you in the nose.
Now throw the glass across the room, noticing how it shrinks as it gets far-
ther away. That, in a nutshell, describes the Zoom tool.
You use Zoom to get closer to (and farther from) your model. If you’re working
on something small, you zoom in until it fills your modeling window. To see
everything at once, zoom out. Figure 2-12 is a demonstration. I can think of a
couple things to tell you about Zoom:
 Just like Orbit, you can activate the Zoom tool in several ways. The
worst way is from the Camera menu; the next-worst way is to click the
Zoom tool button in the toolbar. If you use Zoom either of these two
ways, you actually zoom in and out by clicking and dragging up and
down on your screen.
Figure 2-11:
The Orbit
tool lets you
see your
model from
any angle.
33
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

The best way to zoom is to roll your finger on the scroll wheel of your
mouse to zoom in and out. Instead of clicking the scroll wheel to orbit,
just roll your scroll wheel back and forth to zoom. And just like Orbit,
using your mouse to zoom means that you don’t have to switch tools —
as soon as you stop zooming, you revert to whatever tool you were
using before.
 Use Zoom Extents to see everything. Technically, Zoom Extents is a 
separate tool altogether, but I think it’s related enough to mention here.
If you want your model to fill your modeling window (which is especially
useful when you “get lost” with the navigation tools — trust me, it hap-
pens to everyone), just choose Camera➪Zoom Extents.
When you use the Zoom tool, SketchUp zooms in on your cursor; just posi-
tion it over whatever part of your model you want to zoom in on (or zoom
out from). If your cursor isn’t over any of your model’s geometry (faces and
edges), the Zoom tool won’t work very well — you’ll end up zooming either
really slowly or really quickly.
Just panning around
Using the Pan tool is a lot like washing windows — you move the paper towel
back and forth, but it stays flat and it never gets any closer or farther away
from you. The Pan tool is basically for sliding your model view around in
your modeling window. To see something that’s to the right, you use Pan to
slide your model to the left. It’s as simple as that. You should know these
three things about Pan:
 Pan is on the Camera menu. But that’s not where you should go to 
activate it.
 Pan is also on the toolbar. You could access the Pan tool by clicking
its button on the toolbar (it looks like a severed hand), but there’s a
better way. . . .

34
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

 Hold down your mouse’s scroll wheel button and press Shift. When
you do both at the same time — basically, Orbit+Shift — your cursor
temporarily turns into the Pan tool. When it does so, move your mouse
to pan.
Drawing edges with ease
Being able to use the Line tool without having to think too much about it is
the secret to being able to model anything you want in SketchUp. You use the
Line tool to draw individual edges, and because SketchUp models are really
just fancy collections of edges (carefully arranged, I’ll admit), anything you
can make in SketchUp, you can make with the Line tool.
SketchUp models are made up of edges and faces. Anytime you have three or
more edges that are connected and on the same plane, SketchUp creates a face.
If you erase one of the edges that “defines” a face (borders it), the face disap-
pears, too. Take a look at the section “It’s All about Edges and Faces,” earlier in
this chapter, for more information on the relationship between edges and faces.
Drawing edges is as simple. Just follow these steps:
1. Select the Line tool (some people call it the Pencil tool).
2. Click where you want your line to begin.
3. Move your cursor to the desired endpoint for your line, and click
again to end.
Figure 2-13 demonstrates the basic idea.
When you draw a line segment with the Line tool, notice how SketchUp
automatically tries to draw another line? This is called rubber banding —
the Line tool lets you “continue” to draw edge segments, automatically
starting each new one at the end of the previous one you drew.
4. When you want the Line tool to stop drawing lines, press Esc to “snip”
the line at the last spot you clicked.
Figure 2-13:
Use the Line
tool to draw

SketchUp lets you draw lines in two ways: You can either use the click-drag-
release method or the click-move-click one. They both work, of course, but I
highly recommend training yourself to do the latter. You’ll have more control,
and your hand won’t get as tired. When you draw edges by clicking and 
dragging your mouse (click-drag-release), you’re a lot more likely to “drop”
your line accidentally. Because the Line tool only draws straight lines, think
about using it less like a pencil (even though it looks like one) and more like a
spool of sticky thread.
The Eraser tool is specifically designed for erasing edges; use it by clicking
the edges you don’t like to delete them. You can also drag over edges with the
Eraser, but I think that’s a little harder to get used to.
Injecting accuracy into your model
It’s all well and fine to make a model, but most of the time, you need to make
sure that it’s accurate. Without a certain level of accuracy, it’s not as useful
for figuring things out. The key to accuracy in SketchUp is the little text box
that lives in the lower-right corner of your SketchUp window — the one I
point out in Figure 2-14. That little text box is called the Value Control Box, or
VCB, and here are some of the things you can use it to do:
 Make a line a certain length
 Draw a rectangle a certain size
 Push/pull a face a certain distance
 Change the number of sides in a polygon
 Move something a given distance
 Rotate something by a certain number of degrees
 Make a certain number of copies
 Divide a line into a certain number of segments
 Change your field of view (how much you can see)
36
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Turning off “rubber-banding” lines
Depending on what you’re making, and on how
you work, you might want to turn the Line tool’s
rubber-banding behavior off. To do so, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Preferences (SketchUp➪
Preferences on the Mac).
2. Choose the Drawing panel from the list on
the left in the Preferences dialog box.
3. Deselect the Continue Line Drawing
check box.

Here are some things you should know about the VCB:
 You don’t have to click in the VCB to enter a number. This one’s a big
one: When they’re first starting out with SketchUp, people assume that
they need to click in the VCB (to select it, presumably) before they can
start typing. They (and you) don’t — just start typing, and whatever you
type shows up in the VCB automatically. When it comes to being precise,
SketchUp is always “listening” for you to type something in this box.
 The VCB is context-sensitive. This means that what it controls depends
on what you happen to be doing at the time. If you’re drawing an edge
with the Line tool, it knows that whatever you type is a length; if you’re
rotating something, it knows to listen for an angle.
 You the set the default units for the VCB in the Model Info dialog box.
Perhaps you want a line you’re drawing to be 14 inches long. If you’re set
up to use inches as your default unit of measurement, just type 14 into
the VCB and press Enter — SketchUp assumes that you mean 14 inches.
If you want to draw something 14 feet long, you would type in 14’, just to
let SketchUp know that you mean feet instead of inches. You can over-
ride the default unit of measurement for the VCB by typing in any unit
you want. If you want to move something a distance of 25 meters, type in
25m and press Enter. You set the default units for the VCB in the Units
panel of the Model Info dialog box (which is on the Window menu).

Figure 2-14:
SketchUp’s

is the key to

37
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

 Sometimes, the VCB does more than one thing. In certain circum-
stances, you can change the VCB’s mode (what it’s “listening for”) by
typing in a unit type after a number. For example, when you’re drawing a
circle, the default “value” in the VCB is the radius — if you type 6 and
press Enter, you’ll end up with a circle with a radius of 6 inches. But if
you type in 6s, you’re telling SketchUp that you want 6 sides (and not
inches), so you’ll end up with a circle with 6 sides. If you type in 6 and
press Enter, and then type in 6s and press Enter again, SketchUp will
draw a hexagon (a 6-sided circle) with a radius of 6 inches.
 The VCB lets you change your mind. As long as you don’t do anything
after you press Enter, you can always type a new value into the VCB and
press Enter again; there’s no limit to the number of times you can
change your mind.
 You can use the VCB during an operation. In most cases, you can use
the VCB to be precise while you’re using a tool. Here’s how that works:
1. Click once to start your operation (such as drawing a line or using
the Move tool).
2. Move your mouse so that you’re “going in the correct color direc-
tion.” If you’re using the Line tool and you want to draw parallel to
the green axis, make sure that the edge you’re drawing is green. Be
sure not to click again.
3. Without clicking the VCB, just type in the dimension you want; you
should see it appear in the VCB.
4. Press Enter to complete the operation.
 You can also use the VCB after an operation. Doing this revises what
you’ve just done. These steps should give you an idea of what I’m talking
about:
1. Complete your operation. This might be drawing a line, moving
something, rotating something, or any of the other things I men-
tioned at the beginning of this section.
2. Before you do anything else, type in whatever dimension you
intended, and then press Enter. Whatever you did should be
redone according to what you typed in.

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Resizing everything with the Tape Measure tool
Consider that you’ve been working away in
SketchUp, not paying particular attention to
how big anything in your model is, when you
suddenly decide that you need what you’ve
made to be a specific size. SketchUp has a ter-
rific trick for taking care of this exact situation:

39
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set
You can use the Tape Measure tool to resize your
whole model based on a single measurement.
Here’s how it works: In the following figure, I’ve
started to model a simple staircase, and now I
want to make sure that it’s the right size; doing
so will make it easier to keep working on it. I
know I want the riser height (the vertical dis-
tance between the steps) to be 7 inches, so this
is what I do:
1. Select the Tape Measure tool (choose
Tools➪Tape Measure).
2. Make sure that the Tape Measure is in
Measure mode by pressing Ctrl (Option on
the Mac) until you don’t see a plus sign (+)
next to the Tape Measure cursor.
3. To measure the distance I want to change
(in this case, the riser height), I click once
to start measuring and click again to stop.
4. I type in the dimension I want what I just
measured to be: 7 (for 7 inches).
5. In the dialog box that appears, asking me
whether I want to resize my whole model,
I click the Yes button.
When I click the Yes button, my whole model is
resized proportionately to the dimension I entered.
...to here
Measure from here...

To give you a more concrete example, say I want to move my box (shown in
Figure 2-15) a total of 5 meters in the red direction (parallel to the red axis).
Here’s what I’d do:
1. Using the Move tool, I click the box once to “pick it up.”
2. I move my mouse until I see the linear inference that tells me I’m moving
in the red direction.
3. I type in 10m, and then I press Enter. My box is positioned exactly 5
meters from where I picked it up.
4. On second thought, I don’t think I’m happy with the 5 meters, so I decide
to change it. I type in 15m, and then press Enter again; the box moves
another 5 meters in the blue direction. I can keep doing this until I’m
happy (or bored).
Click to pick up the box
Move along the red axis
Type 10m

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

Selecting what you mean to select
If you want to move something in your model, or rotate it, or copy it, or do
any number of other things to it, you need to select it first. When you select
elements, you’re telling SketchUp that this is the stuff you want to work with.
To select things, you use (drum roll, please) the Select tool, which looks
exactly the same as the Select tool in every other graphics program on the
planet — it’s an arrow. That’s a good thing, because selecting isn’t the sort
of thing you should have to relearn every time you pick up a new program.
Here’s everything you need to know about selecting things in SketchUp:
 Just click anything in your model to select it (while you’re using the
Select tool, of course).
 To select more than one thing, hold down Shift while you click all the
things you want to select. (See Figure 2-16.)
Shift works both ways when it comes to the Select tool. You can use it to
add to your set of selected objects (which I mention above), but you can
also use it to subtract an object from your selection. In other words, if
you have a bunch of stuff selected, and you want to deselect something
in particular, just hold down Shift while you click it — it won’t be
selected anymore.
 Selected objects in SketchUp look different depending on what kind
of objects they are:
• Selected edges and guides turn blue.
• Selected faces look covered in tiny blue dots.
• Selected groups and components (which you can read about in
Chapter 5) get a blue box around them.
• Selected section planes (see Chapter 10 for more info on these)
turn blue.
Click to select a face
Shift + click to add another
face to your selection
Figure 2-16:
Click things

Select tool

41
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

 A much fancier way to select things in your model is to double- and
triple-click them. When you double-click a face, you select that face and
all the edges that define it. Double-clicking an edge gives you that edge
plus all the faces that are connected to it. When you triple-click an edge
or a face, you select the whole object that it’s a part of. Figure 2-17
shows what I mean.
 You can also select several things at once by dragging a box around
them. You have two kinds of selection boxes; which one you use
depends on what you’re trying to select (see Figure 2-18):
• Window selection: If you click and drag from left to right to make a
selection box, you create a window selection. In this case, only
things that are entirely inside your selection box are selected.
• Crossing selection: If you click and drag from right to left to make a
selection box, you create a crossing selection. With one of these,
anything your selection box touches (including what’s inside) ends
up getting selected.
I keep saying that selected stuff turns blue in SketchUp, but you can make it
turn any color you want. Blue is just the default color for new documents you
create. The “selected things” color is one of the settings you can adjust in the
Styles dialog box; if you’re interested, you can read all about styles in
Chapter 9.
Just because you can’t see something doesn’t mean it isn’t selected.
Whenever you make a selection, it’s a very good idea to orbit around to make
sure you’ve got only what you intended to get. Accidentally selecting too
much is an easy mistake to make.
Single click selects a face
Double-click selects the 
face and edges
Triple-click selects the
whole object

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

Moving and copying like a champ
To move things around in SketchUp, you use the Move tool. To make a copy
of something, you use the Move tool in combination with a button on your
keyboard: Ctrl in Windows and Option on a Mac. It’s really that simple.
Moving things around
The Move tool is the one that looks like crossed red arrows. Using it involves
clicking the entity you want to move, moving it to where you want it to be, and
clicking again to drop it. It’s not a complicated maneuver, but getting the hang
of it takes a little bit of time. Here are some tips for using Move successfully:
 Click, move, and click. Don’t drag your mouse. Just like using the Line
tool, try to avoid the temptation to use the Move tool by clicking and
dragging around with your mouse; doing so makes things a lot harder.
Instead, practice clicking once to pick things up, moving your mouse
without any buttons held down, and clicking again to put down what-
ever you’re moving.
Only this is selected
All this is selected too

Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

 Click a point that will let you position it exactly where you want when
you drop it (instead of just clicking anywhere on the thing you’re
trying to move to pick it up). Figure 2-19 shows two boxes that I want
precisely to stack on top of each other. If I just click anywhere on the
first box and move it over the other one, I can’t place it where I want;
SketchUp just doesn’t work that way.
To stack the boxes precisely, I have to click the bottom corner of the soon-
to-be top box to grab it there, and then move my cursor over the top
corner of the bottom box to drop it. Now my boxes are lined up perfectly.
 Press Esc to cancel a move operation. Here’s something beginners do
all the time: They start to move something (or start moving something
accidentally), and then they change their minds. Instead of pressing Esc,
they try to use Move to put things back the way they were. Inevitably,
they don’t, and things end up getting messed up.
If you change your mind in the middle of moving something, just press
Esc; everything will go back to the way it was.

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

 Don’t forget about inferences. To move something in one of the colored
directions, just wait until you see the dotted On Axis linear inference
appear; then hold down Shift to lock yourself in that direction. For more
information about using SketchUp’s inference engine, check out the sec-
tion “Keeping an eye out for inferences,” earlier in this chapter.
 Don’t forget about the VCB. You can move things precise distances
using the Value Control Box; have a look at the section “Injecting accu-
racy into your model,” earlier in this chapter, to find out how.
Modeling with the Move tool
In SketchUp, the Move tool is very important for modeling; it’s not just for
moving whole objects around. You can also use it to move just about any-
thing, including vertices (edges’ endpoints), edges, faces, and combinations
of any of these. By only moving certain entities (all the things I just mentioned),
you can change the shape of your geometry pretty drastically. Figure 2-20
shows what I mean.
Moving a vertex

Figure 2-20:
You can use
the Move
tool on ver-
tices, edges,
and faces to

ent forms.
45
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

Using the Move tool to create forms (instead of just moving them around) is
an incredibly powerful way to work, but isn’t particularly intuitive. After all,
nothing in the physical world behaves like the Move tool — you can’t just
grab the edge of a hardwood floor and move it up to turn it into a ramp in
real life. In SketchUp, you can — and should.
46
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Telling SketchUp who’s boss with Auto-Fold
This will happen to you sooner or later: You’ll be
trying to move a vertex, an edge, or a face, and
you won’t be able to go in the direction you
want. SketchUp doesn’t like to let you create
folds (when extra faces and edges are created
in place of a single face) with the Move tool, so
it constrains your movement to directions that
won’t end up adding them. If SketchUp won’t let
you move whatever you’re trying to move, force
it by doing one very important thing: Press and
hold down Alt (Ô on a Mac) while you’re
moving. When you do this, you’re telling
SketchUp that it’s okay to proceed — to create
folds if it has to. This is called Auto-Fold, and the
following figure shows how it works.
Click once with the Move tool
to start moving
Hold down Alt (Ô on a Mac)
and move your mouse

To preselect or not to preselect
The Move tool works in two different ways; you’ll eventually need to use both
of them, depending on what you’re trying to move:
 Moving a selection: When you have a selection of one or more entities,
the Move tool only moves the things you’ve selected. This comes in
handy every time you need to move more than one object; Figure 2-21
shows a selection being moved with the Move tool.
 Moving without a selection: If you don’t have anything selected, you can
click anything in your model with the Move tool to move it around. Only
the thing you click is moved. Figure 2-22 shows what I’m talking about.
Figure 2-22:
Without
anything
selected,
you can
click any-
thing in your
model with

tool to start

This isn’t selected
...so it doesn’t move with the rest

47
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

Making copies with the Move tool
Lots of folks spend time hunting around in SketchUp, trying to figure out how
to make copies. It’s very simple: You just press a modifier key (a button on
your keyboard that tells SketchUp to do something different) while you’re
using the Move tool. Instead of moving something, you move a copy of it.
Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:
 Press Ctrl to copy in Windows, and press Option to copy on a Mac.
This tells SketchUp to switch from Move to Copy while you’re moving
something with the Move tool. Your cursor will get a little “+” next to it,
and you’ll see your copy moving when you move your mouse. Figure 2-23
shows this in action.
If you decide you don’t want to make a copy, just press Ctrl (Option)
again to toggle back to Move; the “+” sign will disappear.
 Copying is just like moving, except you’re moving a copy. This means
that all the same rules that apply to using the Move tool apply to making
copies, too.
 You can make more than one copy at a time. Perhaps I wanted to
make five, equally spaced copies of a column, as shown in Figure 2-24.
All I have to do is move a copy to where I want my last column to be;
then I type in 5/ and press Enter. This makes five copies of my column
and spaces them evenly between the first and last column in the row.
Neat, huh?
If I know how far apart I want my copies to be, I can move a copy that
distance, type in 5x, and press Enter. My five copies appear equally
spaced in a row. (See Figure 2-25.)

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

Making and using guides
Sometimes you need to draw temporary lines while you’re modeling. These
temporary lines, called guides, are useful for lining things up, making things
the right size, and generally adding precision and accuracy to what you’re
building.
In previous versions of SketchUp, guides were called construction geometry,
because that’s basically what they are: a special kind of entity that you create
when and where you need them. They aren’t part of your model, because
they’re not edges or faces. This means that you can choose to hide them or
delete them — they don’t affect the rest of your geometry.

Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

Figure 2-26 shows an example of guides in action. I use guides positioned 12
inches from the wall and 36 inches apart to draw the sides of a doorway. I use
another guide 6 feet, 8 inches from the floor to indicate the top, and then I
draw a rectangle, bounded by my guides, which I know is exactly the right
size. When I’m done, I erase my guides with the Eraser tool, as I explain in a
moment.
Creating guides with the Tape Measure tool
You can create three different kinds of guides, and you use the Tape Measure
tool to make all of them. (See Figure 2-27.)
 Parallel guide lines: Clicking anywhere (except the endpoints or mid-
point) along an edge with the Tape Measure tells SketchUp that you
want to create a guide parallel to that edge. (See Figure 2-26.) Just move
your mouse and you’ll see a parallel, dashed line; click again to place it
wherever you want.
 Linear guide lines: To create a guide along an edge in your model, click
one of the endpoints or the midpoint once, and then click again some-
where else along the edge.
 Guide points: You might want to place a point somewhere in space; you
can do exactly that with guide points. With the Tape Measure tool, click
an edge’s midpoint or endpoint, and then click again somewhere else in
space. A little x appears at the end of a dashed line — that’s your new
guide point.
Figure 2-26:
Use guides

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

Here’s an important point about the Tape Measure tool: It has two modes,
and it only creates guides in one of them. Pressing Ctrl (Option on a Mac) tog-
gles between the modes. When you see a + next to your cursor, your Tape
Measure can make guides; when there’s no +, it can’t.
Using guides to make your life easier
As you’re working along in this software, you’ll find yourself using guides all
the time; they’re an indispensable part of the way modeling in SketchUp
works. Here are some things you should know about using them:
 Position guides precisely using the VCB. Check out the section “Injecting
accuracy into your model,” earlier in this chapter, to find out how.
 Erase guides one at a time. Just click or drag over them with the Eraser
tool to delete guides individually. You can also right-click them and
choose Erase from the context menu.

Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

 Erase all your guides at once. Choosing Edit➪Delete Guides does
just that.
 Hide guides individually or all at once. Right-click a single guide and
choose Hide to hide it, or deselect View➪Guides to hide all of them. It’s
a good idea to hide your guides instead of erasing them, especially while
you’re still modeling.
 Select, move, copy, and rotate guides just like any other entity in
your model. Guides aren’t edges, but you can treat them that way a lot
of the time.
Painting your faces with color and texture
When it comes to adding colors and textures — collectively referred to in
SketchUp as materials — to your model, there’s really only one place you
need to look, and one tool you need to use — the Materials dialog box and
the Paint Bucket tool, respectively.
The Materials dialog box
To open the Materials dialog box (or Colors dialog box on the Mac), choose
Window➪Materials. Figure 2-28 shows what you see when you do. The Materials
dialog box is radically different in the Windows and Mac versions of SketchUp,
but that’s okay — they basically do the same thing.
In SketchUp, you can choose from two different kinds of materials to apply to
the faces in your model:
Figure 2-28:
The
Materials
dialog box in
Windows
(left) and on
the Mac.
52
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

 Colors: These are simple — colors are always solid colors. You can’t
have gradients (where one color fades into another), but you can pretty
much make any color you want.
 Textures: Basically, a SketchUp texture is a tiny image — a photograph,
really — that gets tiled over and over to cover the face you apply it to.
If you paint a face with, say, a brick texture, what you’re really doing is
telling SketchUp to cover the surface with however many “brick photo”
tiles it takes to do the job. The preview image you see in the Materials
dialog box is actually a picture of a single texture image tile.
SketchUp comes with a whole bunch of textures, but you can get even
more from the Google SketchUp Web site (http://sketchup.google.
com/bonuspacks.html). If that’s still not enough, you can go online
and choose from thousands more available for sale. And if that’s still not
enough, you can make your own, though the process of doing so is well
beyond the scope of this humble tome.
On the Mac, you have to click the little brick icon in the Materials dialog box
to see the textures libraries that ship with SketchUp; it’s the drop-down list
next to the little house icon.
Here’s some more interesting information about SketchUp materials:
 Materials can be translucent. Sliding the Opacity slider makes the mate-
rial you’ve selected more or less translucent, which makes seeing
through windows in your model a lot easier.
 Textures can have transparent areas. If you take a look at the materials
in the Fencing library, you’ll notice that a lot of them look kind of
strange; they have areas of black that don’t seem right. These black
areas are areas of transparency — when you paint a face with one of
these textures, you’ll be able to see through the areas that look black.
 You can edit materials, and even make your own. I’d consider this to
be a pretty advanced use of SketchUp, so I’m not going to talk about it in
this book, but I thought you should at least know it’s possible.
The Paint Bucket tool
The Paint Bucket tool looks just like — you guessed it — a bucket of paint.
Activating it automatically opens the Materials dialog box, which is handy.
Here’s everything you need to know about the Paint Bucket:
 You “fill it” by clicking in the Materials dialog box. Just click a material
to load your bucket, and then click the face you want to paint. It’s as
simple as that.
53
Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-set

 Holding down Alt (Ô on a Mac) switches to the Sample tool. With the
Sample tool, you can click any face in your model to load your Paint
Bucket with that face’s material. Release the Alt key to revert to the
Paint Bucket tool.
 Holding down Shift paints all similar faces. If you hold down Shift when
you click to paint a face, all faces in your model that match the one you
click will be painted, too. If things don’t turn out the way you want, just
choose Undo from the Edit menu to go back a step.

f you can’t wait to get your hands dirty (so to speak), you’ve come to the

another word of this book to be able to follow along, although I do refer you
to chapters where you can find out more. Above all, these pages are about

So what are you going to build? Perhaps a doghouse. The nice thing about
doghouses is that they’re a lot like peoplehouses in the ways that count:
They have doors and roofs, and just about everybody has seen one.
One last thing: Just about every other piece of this book is written so that
you can jump around to the bits you need; you don’t have to follow a particu-

follow along, you should start on this page and work your way to the end.
Otherwise, things just won’t make sense.
Setting Things Up
I know — setup is boring. Who wants to flip through menus and options
dialog boxes instead of jumping in? I completely agree, so I’ll keep this short
and sweet. This section is just about making sure that you’re starting at the
right place. That’s it.

Follow these steps to get ready:
1. Launch Google SketchUp.
2. Choose your default settings.
If you’ve never launched SketchUp on your computer before, you’ll see
the Choose Default Settings dialog box. (See Figure 3-1.) Here’s what to
do if it pops up:
a. Choose Perspective View (on the left).
b. Choose your preferred measurement system from the Units drop-
down menu.
c. Click the Continue button to close the dialog box.
If the Choose Default Settings dialog box doesn’t appear, you (or some-
one else) have already chosen these settings. Don’t worry — just follow
these steps to set things straight:
a. Choose Window➪Preferences (SketchUp➪Preferences on a Mac).
b. On the left side of the System Preferences dialog box, choose
Template to show the Template panel.
c. Choose one of the 3D templates from the drop-down list (see
Figure 3-2).
d. If you’re on a Windows machine, close the System Preferences
dialog box by clicking OK. On a Mac, click the red button in the
upper-left corner of the dialog box.

e. Open a new file by choosing File➪New.
3. Close the Learning Center dialog box (which may have opened auto-
matically when you launched SketchUp) for now. If the Learning
Center isn’t there in the first place, skip to Step 4.
As long as the Show Tips at Startup check box has never been deselected
(by you or someone else), the Learning Center dialog box will open
every time you launch SketchUp. That’s a good thing; don’t deselect it
just yet. Just close the Learning Center for now by clicking the little X
in its upper-right corner. If you’re on a Mac, click the red circle in the
upper-left corner.
4. Make sure that you can see the Getting Started toolbar.
Figure 3-3 shows the Getting Started toolbar. If it’s not visible in your
modeling window, choose View➪Toolbars➪Getting Started to make it
show up. If you’re on a Mac, choose View➪Show Toolbar.
5. Clear your modeling window.
If this isn’t the first time SketchUp has been run on your computer, you
might see dialog boxes all over the place. If that’s the case, just open
the Window menu and make sure that everything is deselected to get rid
of them.

Making a Quick Model
Figure 3-4 shows what your computer screen should look like at this point.
You should see a row of tools across the top of your modeling window, a little
man, and three colored modeling axes (red, green, and blue lines).
Follow these steps to build a doghouse (and check this book’s companion
Web site for additional help; the Introduction has details about the Web site):
1. Delete the little man on your screen.
Using the Select tool (the arrow on the far left of your toolbar), click the
little man to select him (his name is Bryce, in case that matters to you),
and then choose Edit➪Delete.
2. Choose Camera➪Standard➪Iso.
This switches you to an isometric (3D) view of your model, which allows
you to build something without having to “move around.”
3. Draw a rectangle on the ground.
Use the Rectangle tool (between the pencil and the circle on your tool-
bar) to draw a rectangle by doing the following:
a. Click once to place one corner on the left side of your screen.
b. Click again to place the opposite corner on the right side of your
screen.
Remember that you’re in a 3D, perspective, view of the world, so your
rectangle will look more like a diamond — 90-degree angles don’t look
like 90-degree angles in perspective. Figure 3-5 shows what you should
be aiming for in this step.
Figure 3-4:
This is what
your screen
should look
like in
Windows
(left) and
on a Mac
(right).
58
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

It’s important to draw the right kind of rectangle for this example (or for
any model you’re trying to create in Perspective view), so try it a few
times until it looks like the rectangle in Figure 3-5. To go back a step,
choose Edit➪Undo Rectangle; the last thing you did will be undone.
You can use Undo to go back as many steps as you like, so feel free to
use it anytime.
4. Use the Push/Pull tool to extrude your rectangle into a box.
Use this tool (it looks like a brown box with a red arrow coming out
the top) to “pull” your rectangle into a box by following these steps:
a. Click the rectangle once to start the push/pull operation.
b. Click again, somewhere above your rectangle, to stop
pushing/pulling.
At this point, you should have something that looks like Figure 3-6; if you
don’t, use Push/Pull again to make your box look about the right height.
If you are happily pushing/pulling away on your box, and everything
suddenly disappears, it’s because you pushed/pulled the top of your box
all the way to the ground. Just choose Edit➪Undo and keep going.

5. Draw a couple of diagonal lines for your roof.
Use the Line tool (it’s shaped like a pencil) to draw two diagonal edges
(lines) that will form your peaked roof, as shown in Figure 3-7. Follow
these steps:
a. Click once at the midpoint of the top of your box’s front face to
start your line.
You’ll know you’re at the midpoint when you see a small, light-blue
square and the word Midpoint appears. Move slowly to make sure
that you see it.
b. Click again somewhere along one of the side edges of your box’s
front face to end your line.

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

Wait until you see a red On Edge cue (just like the Midpoint one in
the last step) before you click; if you don’t, your new line won’t
end on the edge like it’s supposed to.
c. Repeat the previous two steps to draw a similar (but opposite) line
from the midpoint to the edge on the other side of the face.
Don’t worry about making your diagonal lines symmetrical; for the
purposes of this exercise, it’s not important that they are.
6. Push/pull the triangles away to leave a sloped roof.
Use the Push/Pull tool (the same one you used back in Step 4) to get rid
of the triangular parts of your box, leaving you with a sloped roof. Have
a look at Figure 3-8 to see this in action, and follow these steps:
a. Select the Push/Pull tool, then click the right triangular face once
to start the push/pull operation.
b. Move your cursor to the right to “push” the triangle as far as it will
go (even with the end of your box).
c. Click again (on the triangle) to end the push/pull operation and to
make the triangular face disappear.
d. Still using the Push/Pull tool, double-click the left triangular face to
repeat the previous push/pull operation, making that face disap-
pear as well.
Figure 3-8:
Use the
Push/Pull
tool to form a

Chapter 3: Getting Off to a Running Start

7. Draw a rectangle on your front face.
Switch back to the Rectangle tool (which you used in Step 3) and draw
a rectangle on the front face of your pointy box. Make sure that the
bottom of your rectangle is flush with the bottom of your box by watch-
ing for the red On Edge hint to appear before you click. Check out
Figure 3-9 to see what it should look like when you’re done.
Using the Rectangle tool is a two-step process: You click once to place
one corner and again to place the opposite corner. Try not to draw lines
and shapes in SketchUp by dragging your cursor; doing so makes things
more difficult. Practice clicking once to start an operation (like drawing
a rectangle) and clicking again to stop.
8. Draw an arc on top of the rectangle you just drew.
Use the Arc tool (to the right of the Circle tool) to draw an arc on top of
your rectangle (see Figure 3-10). Follow these steps to draw an arc:
Finish here
Click here to start drawing

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

a. Click the upper-left corner of the rectangle to place one endpoint
of your arc. Make sure that you see the green Endpoint hint before
you click.
b. Click the upper-right corner of the rectangle to place the other end-
point of your arc.
c. Move your cursor up to “bow out” the line you’re drawing into an
arc, and click when you’re happy with how it looks.
9. Select the Eraser tool and then click the horizontal line between the
rectangle and the arc to erase that line.
10. Push/pull the doorway inward.
Use the Push/Pull tool (which you’re an old hand with by now) to push
the “doorway” face you created in Steps 7 through 9 in just a bit.
You use Push/Pull by clicking a face once to start, moving your cursor to
“push/pull” it in or out, and then clicking again to stop.

11. Erase the horizontal line at the bottom of the doorway by clicking it
with the Eraser tool.
This makes the line (and the whole face above it) disappear. Figure 3-11
shows what your finished doghouse should look like.
For a more detailed introduction to drawing lines and working with mid-
points, angles, and more, flip to Chapter 2.
Slapping On Some Paint
I have an ulterior motive for getting you to paint your doghouse: To color it,
you have to understand how to spin it around first. Moving around your model
is the most important skill to develop when you’re first learning SketchUp. Run
through these steps to apply colors (and textures) to the faces in your model,
and to find out about moving around while you’re doing it:
1. Choose Window➪Materials to open the Materials dialog box (see
Figure 3-12). Click a color or texture you like.
When you do, you automatically “pick up” the Paint Bucket tool and fill
it with your chosen material.
2. Paint some of the faces in your model by clicking any face you want to
paint with the Paint Bucket tool.
3. Switch materials.
Choose another material from the Materials dialog box by clicking it.
4. Paint the rest of the faces you can see. (Refer to Figure 3-13.)
Loop through Steps 2 to 4 for as long as you like. Finding the Materials
dialog box in SketchUp is just like getting a brand new box of crayons
when you were little (you know, the big box, with the built-in sharpener).
Figure 3-11:

5. Choose the Orbit tool; it’s just to the left of the creepy white hand on
the toolbar.
6. Click somewhere on the left side of your screen and drag your cursor
over to the right. (See Figure 3-14.) Release your mouse button when
you’re done.
Your model spins! This is called orbiting. Orbit around some more, just
to get the hang of it.
If you’re orbiting, and you’ve dragged your cursor over as far as it will go,
and you haven’t orbited as much as you wanted to, don’t fret. Just release
the mouse button, move your cursor over to where it was when you
started orbiting, and orbit some more by clicking and dragging. You usu-
ally can’t see what you want to see with a single orbit; you need a bunch
of separate “drags” (separate orbits, I guess) to get things looking the
way you want them to.

Chapter 3: Getting Off to a Running Start

7. Zoom in and out if you need to by selecting the Zoom tool and drag-
ging your cursor up and down in your modeling window.
The Zoom tool looks like a magnifying glass, and it’s on the other side of
the creepy white hand. Dragging up zooms in, and down zooms out.
8. If needed, move around in two dimensions with the Pan tool by select-
ing it and then clicking and dragging the Pan cursor inside your mod-
eling window.
The Pan tool is the creepy white hand between Orbit and Zoom. You use
Pan to “slide” your model around inside your modeling window without
spinning it around or making it look bigger or smaller. You can pan in
any direction.
9. Use the Orbit, Zoom, Pan, and Paint Bucket tools to finish painting
your doghouse.
Now that you know how to move around your model, here’s how I’d like
you to paint it (Color Plate 8 shows what it should look like):
• Paint the exterior walls reddish brown
• Paint the roof light blue
• Paint the interior yellow-orange
When you’re just starting out, it’s easy to get a little lost with the navigation
tools (Orbit, Zoom, and Pan); it happens to everybody. If you find yourself in
a pickle, just choose Camera➪Zoom Extents. When you do, SketchUp auto-
matically plunks your model right in front of you; check out Figure 3-15 to see
Zoom Extents in action. Just so you know, Zoom Extents is also a button on
the toolbar; it’s right next to the Zoom tool.
Chapter 2 is the place to look for extra tips and tricks on orbiting, zooming,
and panning, as well as for details about using the Materials dialog box to
paint the faces of an object.

Giving Your Model Some Style
SketchUp Styles allow you to change your model’s appearance — the way it’s
drawn, basically — with just a few clicks of your mouse. You can create your
own styles, of course, but SketchUp also comes with a library of pre-made
ones that you can use without knowing anything about how they work.
Follow these steps to try out a couple of styles on your doghouse:
1. Choose Window➪Styles.
The Styles dialog box opens.
2. Click the Select tab to show the Select pane.
3. In the Libraries drop-down menu (see Figure 3-16), choose the
Assorted Styles library.

4. Click through the different styles to see what they’re about.
When you click a style in the Styles dialog box, that style is applied to
your model. Figure 3-17 shows our doghouse with a few different styles
applied — can you figure out which ones?
5. Go back to the default style.
This is the first style in the Default Styles library.
Switching On the Sun
You’re about to use what I consider to be one of SketchUp’s best features:
shadows. When you turn on shadows, you’re activating SketchUp’s built-in
sun. The shadows you see in your modeling window are accurate for what-
ever time and location you set. For the purposes of this example, though,
don’t worry about accuracy. Go through these steps to let the light shine in:
1. Use Orbit, Zoom, and Pan to get an aerial, three-quarter view of your
doghouse, sort of like the one shown in Figure 3-18.
Figure 3-17:
The same

very dif-
ferent styles

68
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 

2. Choose Window➪Shadows.
This opens the Shadow Settings dialog box (as shown in Figure 3-19).
3. Select the Display Shadows check box to turn on the sun.
Your doghouse should be casting a shadow on the ground.
4. In the Shadow Settings dialog box, move the Time slider back and forth.
Changing the time of day means that you’re moving SketchUp’s sun
around in the sky. When the sun moves around, so do your shadows.
Take a look at Figure 3-20 to see what I mean.

Sharing Your Masterpiece
Now that you have a model that looks about the way you want it to, you
probably want to show it to someone. The easiest way to do that is by
exporting a JPEG image that you can attach to an e-mail. Follow these steps
and you’ll be on your way:
1. Navigate around (using Orbit, Zoom, and Pan) until you like the view
of your model that you see in your modeling window.
2. Choose File➪Export➪2D Graphic.
3. In the Export dialog box that opens, choose JPEG from the Export
Type drop-down menu.
4. Pick a location on your computer system, and give your exported
image a name.
5. Click the Export button to create a JPEG image of what’s visible in
your modeling window.
Exporting a JPEG file is just one way to share models. To find out about all
your options, see Part IV, which explains how to share your model on Google
Earth, as a printout, as an image or animation, or as a slick presentation that
will (hopefully) impress all your friends.

Part II
Modeling in
SketchUp

In this part . . .
W
hen all is said and done, SketchUp is about making
3D models. Sure, you can paint them, make anima-
tions with them, print them, and e-mail images of them to
your friends, but first you have to actually create them.
Chapter 4 makes the assumption that sooner or later, you’re
going to want to use SketchUp to make a model of a build-
ing. Starting with drawing simple floor plans and proceeding
into the transition from 2D to 3D, modeling stairs and creat-
ing roofs, this chapter does its best to get you started.
In Chapter 5, I go over all the different ways you can 
organize your model; doing so improves your modeling
efficiency, your computer’s performance, and ultimately,
your sanity. You don’t have to be a tidy person to “work
clean” in SketchUp — I’m living proof.
Don’t want to use SketchUp to just model buildings?
Chapter 6 describes how to use things like components and
the Follow Me tool to create some pretty advanced models.
Chapter 7 talks about how you can use photographs in
SketchUp, both to “paint” your faces, and to create whole
models based on photographs of objects like buildings
and furniture.

E
ven though SketchUp lets you make (just about) anything you can think
of, certain forms are easier to make than others. Fortunately, these kinds
of shapes are exactly the ones that most people want to make with SketchUp,
most of the time. That’s no accident; SketchUp was designed with architecture
in mind, so the whole paradigm — the fact that SketchUp models are made of
faces and edges, and the kinds of tools it offers — is perfect for making things
like buildings.
But what about curvy, swoopy buildings? You can use SketchUp to make
those, too, but they’re a little harder, so I don’t think they’re a good place to
start. Because most of us live in boxy places with right-angled rooms and flat
ceilings, that kind of architecture is relatively easy to understand.
In this chapter, I introduce you to some of the fundamentals of SketchUp
modeling in terms of making simple, rectilinear buildings. By writing about
how to build certain kinds of things, instead of just describing what the indi-
vidual tools do, I hope to make it easier for you to get started. Even if you’re
not planning to use SketchUp to model any of the things I describe, you
should still be able to apply these concepts to your own creations.
One more thing: Just about every page in this chapter relies heavily on the
stuff I introduce in Chapter 2. Working with the colored drawing axes, select-
ing objects, navigating around your model, and drawing things accurately are
pretty key to making anything in SketchUp, so be prepared to flip back and
forth while you’re getting used to how things work. I like to use paper clips as
bookmarks, but I’m sure you have your own method. . . .

Drawing Floors and Walls
Most floors and walls are flat surfaces, so it’s easy to model them with straight
edges and flat faces in SketchUp. In fact, chances are good that the first thing
you ever modeled in SketchUp looked a lot like the floor and walls of a building.
I can think of two different kinds of architectural models that most people
want to create in SketchUp; how you approach modeling floors and walls
depends entirely on the type of model you’re making:
 Exterior: An exterior model of a building is basically just an empty shell;
you don’t have interior walls, rooms, or furniture to worry about. This
type of model is a slightly simpler proposition for folks who are just
starting out.
 Interior: An interior model of a building is significantly more compli-
cated than an exterior-only one; dealing with interior wall thicknesses,
floor heights, ceilings, and furnishings involves a lot more modeling
prowess.
Here’s the thing: Because everything in SketchUp is made up of super-flat faces
(they have no thickness), the only way to model a wall that’s, say, 8 inches
thick is to use two faces side by side and 8 inches apart. For models where you
need to show wall thicknesses — namely, interior models — this is what you’ll
have to do. Exterior models are easier to make because you can use single
faces to represent walls. Figure 4-1 shows what I’m talking about.
One of the biggest mistakes new SketchUp users make is to attempt an
“inside-outside” model right off the bat. Making a model that shows both the
interior and the exterior of a building at the same time is, to be honest, WAY
too hard when you’re just getting started. Instead, you should build two 
separate models if you need both interior and exterior views. If you need a
combination model later on, you’ll be able to build it in a quarter of the time
it took you to build either of the first two — I guarantee it.
Single-face walls

74
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Starting out in 2D
Of course, you can make a 3D model of a building’s interior in lots of different
ways, but I’m going to show you the one I think makes the most sense.
Basically, it involves drawing a two-dimensional floorplan that includes all
your interior and exterior walls, and then extruding it up to be the right
height. In my method, you don’t worry about doors, windows, or stairs until
after your model is extruded; you put them in afterward, which I think is an
easier and more logical way to work.
If you’re importing a floorplan from another piece of software like AutoCAD
or VectorWorks, I think you’ll appreciate this approach — it lets you take 2D
information and make it 3D, regardless of where it comes from.
Even though SketchUp is a 3D modeling program through and through, it’s
not a bad tool for drawing simple 2D plans. The toolset is adequate and easy
to use, and doing a couple of things before you get started will help a lot. The
thing to keep in mind is that SketchUp isn’t a full-fledged drafting program,
and it probably never will be. If you’re an architect-type who needs to do
heavy-duty CAD (computer-aided drawing) work, you should probably be
drafting in another piece of software and importing your work into SketchUp
when you need 3D. If you’re just drawing your house or the place where you
work, look no further — SketchUp should do just fine.
Switching to a 2D view
If you’re going to use SketchUp to draw a 2D plan, the first thing you need to
do is to orient your point of view. It’s easiest to draw in 2D when you’re
directly above your work, looking down at the ground plane. You also want to
make sure that you’re not seeing things in perspective, which distorts your
view of what you have.
Follow these simple steps to set things up (and find additional help on this
book’s companion site; see the Introduction for details):
1. Create a new SketchUp file.
2. Choose Camera➪Standard➪Top.
This changes your viewpoint so that you’re looking directly down at the
ground.
3. Choose Camera➪Parallel Projection.
Switching from Perspective to Parallel Projection makes it easier to draw
plans in 2D. At this point, your modeling window should look like the
one shown in Figure 4-2.
75
Chapter 4: Building Buildings

Feel free to delete Bryce. That little diagonal line that’s visible in your model-
ing window when you’re in Top view is a top view of Bryce — the 2D guy who
appears in every new SketchUp file you create. To get rid of Bryce, just right-
click him and choose Erase from the context menu.
Dusting off SketchUp’s drafting tools

SketchUp. Figure 4-3 shows the basic toolbar; everything you need is right
there:

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

 Line tool: You use the Line tool (which looks like a pencil) to draw edges,
which are one of the two basic building blocks of SketchUp models.
Fundamentally, you click to start drawing an edge and click again to finish
it. (You can find lots more information about drawing lines in Chapter 2.)
 Eraser tool: You use the Eraser to erase edges (see Figure 4-4). Keep
in mind that you can’t use the Eraser to delete faces, though erasing
one of the edges that defines a face automatically erases that face, too.
Take a look at the section about edges and faces at the beginning of
Chapter 2 for more detail on this. You can use the Eraser in two
different ways:
• Clicking: Click on edges to erase them one at a time.
• Dragging: Drag over edges to erase them; this is faster if you have
lots of edges you want to get rid of.
 Circle tool: Drawing circles in SketchUp is pretty easy: You click once to
define the center and again to define a point on the circle (which also
defines the radius). To enter in a precise radius, just draw a circle, type
in a radius, and press Enter (see Figure 4-5). For more information on
typing while you draw, check out the section on model accuracy in
Chapter 2.

 Arc tool: To draw an arc, you click once to define one end, again to
define the other end, and a third time to define the bulge (how much the
arc sticks out). If you want, you can type in a radius after you draw your
arc by entering the radius, the units, and the letter r. If you want an arc
with a radius of 4 feet, you would draw it however big, type in 4’r, and
press Enter. This is shown in Figure 4-6.
 Offset tool: The Offset tool helps you draw edges that are a constant 
distance apart from edges that already exist in your model. Pictures 
are usually better than words, so take a look at Figure 4-7. Using Offset
on the shape I’ve drawn lets me create another shape that’s exactly 
6 inches bigger all the way around (middle image), or 6 inches smaller
all the way around (right image). Offsetting edges is a useful way to
create things like doorways and window trim.

• Click a face to offset all its edges. If nothing is selected, clicking a
face with the Offset tool lets you offset all that face’s edges by a
constant amount (as shown in Figure 4-7).
• Preselect one or more edges, and then use Offset. If you have
some edges selected, you can use Offset on just those edges; this
comes in handy for drawing things like doorframes and balconies,
as shown in Figure 4-8.
 Tape Measure tool: The Tape Measure is one of those tools that does a
bunch of different things. To use it for measuring distances, click
any two points in your model to measure the distance between them.
The distance “readout” is in the VCB, in the lower-right corner of your
modeling window. You can also use it for sizing a model and for creating
guides, as I explain in Chapter 2.

Chapter 4: Building Buildings

Coming up with a simple plan
If all you’re trying to do is model an exterior view of a building, just measure
around the perimeter, draw the outline of the building in SketchUp, and pro-
ceed from there. (See Figure 4-9.) Your walls will only be a single face thick
(meaning paper-thin), but that’s okay — you’re only interested in the outside,
anyway.
If, on the other hand, you want to create an interior view, your life is a little bit
more complicated. The business of measuring an existing building so that you
can model it on the computer is easier said than done — even experienced
architects and builders often get confused when trying to create as-builts, as
drawings of existing buildings are called. Closets, ventilation spaces, interior
walls, and all kinds of other obstructions inevitably get in the way of getting
good measurements; most of the time, you just have to give it your best shot
and then tweak things a bit to make them right.
Drawing an interior outline
Because the main goal of making an interior model of a building is to end up
with accurate interior spaces, you need to work from the inside out. If your
tape measure is long enough, try to figure out a way to get the major dimen-
sions first — this means the total interior width and length of the inside of
your building. You might not be able to, but do your best. After that, it’s
really just a matter of working your way around, using basic arithmetic and
logic to figure things out.
It really helps to make a paper drawing before you start in with SketchUp.
You’ll know what you need to do, leaving all your concentration for drafting
on the computer. Figure 4-10 shows the paper sketch I used when modeling
my own house.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

From this paper drawing, here’s how I would draw a basic interior outline of
my house:
1. First, I switch into a 2D, overhead view.
The section “Switching to a 2D view,” earlier in this chapter, explains how.
2. Using the Line tool, I draw an edge 17 feet long (see Figure 4-11, left),
representing the eastern wall of the house.
To draw it, I click once to start the edge, move my cursor up until I see
the green linear inference (indicating that I’m drawing parallel to the
green axis), and click again to end my line. To make it 17 feet long, I type
in 17’ and then press Enter — the line resizes itself automatically to be
exactly 17 feet in length. If I wanted to, I could use the Tape Measure to
double-check what I did.
Figure 4-10:
This is the
paper sketch
I used to
model my
house in

81
Chapter 4: Building Buildings

3. I draw an edge 11 feet 10 inches long, starting at the end of the first
edge, heading to the right in the red direction. (See Figure 4-11,
bottom-right.)
To do this, I do exactly what I did to draw the first edge, except that I move
parallel to the red axis this time, type in 11’10, and then press Enter.
4. I keep going all the way around the house, until I get back to where I
started (see Figure 4-12).
If I make a mistake, I either use the Eraser to get rid of edges I’m
unhappy with or I choose Edit➪Undo to go back a step or two.
5. If all my measurements don’t add up, I adjust things so that they do —
a few extra inches here and there never killed anyone, after all.
When I complete my outline (forming a closed loop of edges that were
all on the same plane), a face automatically appeared. Now I have a total
of 11 edges and 1 face.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

When you’re drafting in 2D, whatever you do, don’t use the Orbit tool. Because
you’re working in 2D, you only need to use Zoom and Pan to navigate around
your drawing (see Chapter 2 for more information on this). If you accidentally
end up orbiting your model into a 3D view, follow the steps in the section
“Switching to a 2D view,” earlier in this chapter, to get things back in order.
If you ever get lost, and no amount of zooming and panning will get you back
to a view of your floorplan, choose Camera➪Zoom Extents — think of it as an
emergency lever you can pull to fill your modeling window with your geometry.
Offsetting an exterior wall
Now that I’ve gotten this far, I decide to offset (using the Offset tool) an exterior
wall thickness, just to make it easier to visualize my spaces. Here’s how I do it:
1. Using the Offset tool, I offset my closed shape by 8 inches to the out-
side. (See Figure 4-13, left.)
An offset of 8 inches is a pretty standard thickness for an exterior wall,
especially for houses in my neck of the woods. This is how I use the
Offset tool:

Chapter 4: Building Buildings

a. I make sure that nothing is selected by choosing Edit➪Select None.
b. I click once inside my shape.
c. I click again outside my shape to make a second, bigger shape.
d. I type in 8, and then press Enter.
2. Because I know there are no alcoves on the outside of the house, I use
the Line tool to draw across them. (See Figure 4-13, middle.)
3. I use the Eraser tool to get rid of the extra edges. (See Figure 4-13, right.)
By deleting the extra edges, I go back to having only two faces: one rep-
resenting the floor and one representing the exterior wall thickness.
It doesn’t matter that the wall is thicker in a couple of places; I can
always go back and fiddle with it later on.
Putting in the interior walls
For this part of the process, I use guides a lot. If you haven’t done so already,
read Chapter 2 and check out the last part — you’ll find a full description of
guides and how to use them.
When I’m drafting a floorplan in SketchUp, I find it really helps to ignore
things like doors and windows — where a doorway should be in a wall, I just
draw a solid wall. I like to add in doors and windows after I’ve extruded my
floorplan into a three-dimensional figure.
Here’s how I put in the few interior walls on the first floor of my house:
1. With the Tape Measure tool, I drag a parallel guide 5 feet, 31⁄2 inches
from the inside of my entryway. (See Figure 4-14, left.)
To do this, I just click the edge from which I want to draw the guide,
move my cursor to the right (to tell SketchUp which way to go), type
in 5’3.5, and press Enter.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

2. I draw a few more guides in the same way as I drew the first one.
Working from my pencil drawing, I figure out the location of each interior
wall, and I create guides to measure off the space. (See Figure 4-14, right.)
3. Switching to the Line tool, I draw in edges to represent the interior walls.
By using the guides as, er, guides, it’s easy to draw my edges correctly.
Figure 4-15 shows what I have so far.
Don’t forget to zoom! When you have a jumble of edges and guides, and
you can’t see what you’re doing, just zoom in. It sounds obvious, but
you’d be surprised how many folks forget to change their point of view
while they’re working — it makes all the difference.

Chapter 4: Building Buildings

4. I use the Eraser to delete my guides.
5. I use the Eraser to get rid of all the little extra edge segments. (See
Figure 4-16.)
By doing this, I go back to only having two faces in my model (one for
the floor and one for the walls). When it is time to extrude my plan into
walls, as I explain in a moment, performing this step will help out a lot.
Going from 2D to 3D
With a 2D plan in hand, the next step is to extrude it into a 3D model. This is
basically a one-step process, and it involves the tool that made SketchUp
famous: Push/Pull. In the following sections, I take the simple floorplan I drew
earlier in this chapter and turn it into three-dimensional walls.
Getting a good view
Before I pop up my plan into the third dimension, I need to change my point of
view to get a better view of what I’m doing. (See Figure 4-17.) Follow these steps:
1. Choose Camera➪Perspective.
This “turns on” SketchUp’s perspective engine, meaning that now I can
see things more realistically — the way people really see things in 3D.
2. Choose Camera➪Standard➪Iso.
This switches me from a top view to an isometric (three-quarter) one. I
could do this with the Orbit tool, too — you always have more than one
way to do everything in SketchUp.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

3. Choose Camera➪Zoom Extents.
Zoom Extents has its own button on the basic toolbar, but I thought I’d
stick with the Camera menu theme, just for consistency.
4. Change the field of view from 35 to 45 degrees: Choose Camera➪
Field of View, type in 45, and press Enter.
By default, SketchUp’s field of view is set to 35 degrees. (For more infor-
mation on what this means, check out Chapter 10.)
Pushing/pulling your way to happiness
The Push/Pull tool is a simple creature; you use it to extrude flat faces into 3D
shapes. It works (like everything else in SketchUp) by clicking — you click a
face once to start pushing/pulling it, move your cursor until you like what
you see, and then click again to stop push/pulling. That’s it. I doubt that any
software tool has ever been so satisfyingly easy to use and understand. For
more detail on Push/Pull, see the nearby sidebar, “More fun with Push/Pull.”

Chapter 4: Building Buildings

Push/Pull only works on flat faces; if you need to do something to a curved
face, you’ll have to use something else. Read about the Intersect with Model
feature in the section “Getting to know Intersect with Model,” later in this
chapter — it might be what you’re looking for.
To use Push/Pull to extrude my house’s first floorplan into a 3D model, this is
what I do. (See Figure 4-18.)
1. Select the Push/Pull tool from the toolbar.
It looks like a little box with a red arrow coming out the top.
2. Click the “wall’s” face once to start extruding it.
If I click the “floor” face, I would end up extruding that, instead. If you
choose the wrong face by accident, press Esc to cancel the operation,
and try again.
3. I move my cursor up to pull up the walls, and click to stop extruding.
It doesn’t matter how much I extrude my face, because I’m going to add
precision in the next step.
4. I type in 8’ and press Enter.
When I do this, my push/pull distance is revised to be exactly 8 feet —
the height of the walls in my house.
If I had forgotten to erase any little edge segments before I used Push/Pull, all
my walls might not have been “pulled up” at once. In this case, I would have
used Push/Pull again on any faces that needed it.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Adding doors and windows
You can make openings in your walls in a couple of different ways. What you
choose to do depends on what kind of building you’re modeling, whether
you’re using single-face or double-face walls, and how much detail you plan
to include in your model. You have two options:
 Use SketchUp components that cut openings themselves. SketchUp
comes with a whole bunch of doors and windows that you can drag and
drop into your model. The really cool thing about these is that they cut
their own openings when you place them. Here’s the catch, though:
SketchUp’s “Cut Opening” components only work on single-face walls,
which means that they’re really only useful for exterior building models.
If you’re building an interior model, you’ll have to cut your own openings.
 Cut openings yourself. For double-face walls, this is your only option;
luckily, it’s easy to do. Basically, you draw an outline for the opening you
want to create, and then you use Push/Pull to create the opening — it
works the same way for doors and windows.
Using SketchUp’s handy-dandy components
As long as you’re making an exterior model, you can use the doors and win-
dows that come with SketchUp. These are components, which you can read
more about in Chapter 5. Without going into a ton of detail, here’s what you
need to know about them:
 They’re in the Components dialog box. Choose Window➪Components
to open the dialog box, and then look in the Architecture library for the
doors and windows.
 You can find hundreds more online. If you’re connected to the Internet,
choose File➪3D Warehouse➪Get Models. This brings up the 3D
Warehouse, where you can freely download just about anything you’re
looking for. Chapter 11 goes into more detail about the 3D Warehouse, if
you’re interested.
 They are editable. I go into lots of detail about this in Chapter 5, but
here’s the gist: If you don’t like something about one of SketchUp’s built-
in doors or windows, you can change it.
 They cut their own openings, but the openings aren’t permanent.
When you move or delete a door or window component you’ve placed,
its opening goes with it.
89
Chapter 4: Building Buildings

Adding a hole-cutting component to your model is a piece of cake. Follow
these steps to do it yourself. (See Figure 4-19.)
1. In the Components dialog box, click the component that you want to
place in your model.
2. Place the component where you want it to be.
3. If you don’t like where it is, use the Move tool (read all about it in
Chapter 2) to reposition your component.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
More fun with Push/Pull
Because Push/Pull is the tool that most people
think of when they think of SketchUp, I thought
you might appreciate knowing more about what
it can do. The people who invented this soft-
ware (back in the last millennium) started with
the idea for Push/Pull — that’s how closely
linked SketchUp and Push/Pull are. Here are
four things about Push/Pull that aren’t immedi-
ately obvious when you first start using it:
 Double-click with the Push/Pull tool to
extrude a face by the last distance you
pushed/pulled. When you double-click a
face, it automatically gets pushed/pulled by
the same amount as the last face you used
Push/Pull on.
 Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to push/pull a
copy of your face. The first graphic in the
following figure shows what I’m talking
about here. Instead of using Push/Pull the
regular way, you can use a modifier key to
extrude a copy of the face you’re push-
ing/pulling. This comes in super-handy for
modeling things like multistory buildings
quickly.
 While pushing/pulling, hover over other
parts of your geometry to tell SketchUp how
far to extrude. Take a look at the second
graphic. Perhaps I want to use Push/Pull to
extrude a cylinder that is exactly the same
height as my box. Before I click the second
time to stop pushing/pulling, I hover over a
point on the top of the box; now the cylinder
is exactly that tall. To complete the opera-
tion, I click while I’m still hovering over the
box. It’s pretty simple, and it’ll save you
hours of time after you’re used to doing it.

91
Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 Pushing/pulling a face into another, co-
planar face automatically cuts a hole. In
fact, this is how you make openings (like
doors and windows) in double-face walls.
The last graphic shows this in action.
Hit Control (Option on Mac) to copy your face
Infer to other objects to match their height
Click while you’re hovering
Push/Pull a face all the way into another
one to make both disappear

Figure 4-20 shows a simple building to which I’ve added a door and a couple
of window components. Notice how I use guides to line things up — doing so
is the best way to make sure that everything’s in the right spot.
Making your own openings
Most of the time, you won’t be able to get away with using SketchUp’s built-in
door and window components — the fact that they can’t cut through two-
faced walls means that they’re limited to external use only. That’s okay
though; cutting your own holes in walls is quick and easy, and you’ll always
end up with exactly what you want.
92
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Working through thick and thin
Pay attention to which edges look thick and
which ones look thin. When you’re drawing in
2D, you can tell a lot from an edge’s appearance:
 Thin edges cut through faces. Edges that are
thin are ones that have “sunk in”; you can
think of them like cuts from a razor-sharp
knife. When you successfully split a face
with an edge that you draw with the Line
tool, it looks thin. The first image in the fol-
lowing figure shows what I’m talking about.
 Thick edges sit on top of faces. If the edge
you just drew looks thicker than some of the
other edges in your model, it isn’t actually
cutting through the face it’s on — it’s only
sitting on top. An edge can sit on top of a
face for a couple of reasons:
It has one end free. So-called “free” edges
are ones that aren’t connected to other
edges at both ends (as in the second image).
It crosses another edge. Because edges
don’t automatically cut other edges where
they cross, you have to manually split them.
To make a thick edge thin (making it “sink
in”), use the Line tool to trace over each
segment, as shown in the third image.
This edge is “sunk in”
Free (one-ended) edges
don’t sink in
Edges that cross other
edges don’t sink in

To cut a precise opening in a double-face wall, here’s what you need to do;
Figure 4-21 shows the basic steps:
1. Mark where you want your opening to be with guides.
For a refresher on using guides, have a look at the section “Making and
using guides,” in Chapter 2.

Chapter 4: Building Buildings

2. Draw the outline of the opening you want to create, making sure to
create a new face in the process.
You can use any of the drawing tools to do this, though I recommend
sticking with the Line tool when you’re starting out. You’ll know you’ve
made a new face if the edges in your outline look thin; if they don’t,
check out the nearby sidebar, “Working through thick and thin,” for
more info.
3. Use Push/Pull to extrude your new face back into the thickness of the
wall until it touches the face behind it.
If everything goes well, your face should disappear, taking with it the
corresponding area of the face behind it. Now you have an opening in
your wall. If your face doesn’t disappear, and no opening is created, it’s
probably for one of the following reasons:
• Your faces aren’t parallel to each other. This technique only
works if both faces are parallel. Keep in mind that just because two
faces look parallel doesn’t mean that they are.
• You hit an edge. If you push/pull your face into a face with an edge
crossing it, SketchUp gets confused and doesn’t cut an opening.
Use Undo, get rid of the pesky edge (if you can), and try again.
Don’t forget to orbit! If you can’t quite push/pull what you mean to push/pull,
orbit around until you can see what you’re doing.
Staring Down Stairs
There are probably a million different ways to make stairs in SketchUp, but
(naturally) I have my favorites. In the following sections, you’ll find three dif-
ferent methods that work equally well; take a look at all of them and then
decide which works best for your situation.
Before I dive in, here’s some simple stairway vocabulary, just in case you
need it; take a look at Figure 4-22 for a visual reference:
 Rise and run: The rise is the total distance your staircase needs to
climb. If the vertical distance from your first floor to your second (your
floor-to-floor distance) is 10 feet, that’s your rise. The run is the total 
horizontal distance your staircase takes up. A set of stairs with a big
rise and a small run would be really steep.
 Tread: A tread is an individual step — the part of the staircase you step
on. When someone refers to the size of a tread, he’s talking about the
depth — the distance from the front to the back of the tread. Typically,
this is anywhere from 9 to 24 inches, but treads of 10 to 12 inches are
most comfortable to walk on.
94
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

 Riser: The riser is the part of the step that connects each tread in the
vertical direction. Risers are usually about 5 to 7 inches high, but that
depends on your building. Not all staircases have actual risers (think of
steps with gaps between treads), but they all have a riser height.
 Landing: A landing is a platform somewhere around the middle of a set
of stairs. Landings are necessary in real life, but modeling them can be a
pain; figuring out staircases with landings is more definitely more compli-
cated. It’s sometime easier if you think of your landings as really big steps.
The Subdivided Rectangles method
This is the way most people think to draw their first set of stairs. It’s intuitive
and simple, but it’s also a bit more time-consuming than the other methods I
describe in this chapter.
The key to the Subdivided Rectangles method is to use a special trick you
can do with edges: Called Divide, it lets you pick any edge and divide it up
into as many segments as you want. If you know how many steps you need
to draw, but not how deep each individual tread needs to be, this comes in
really handy.

Chapter 4: Building Buildings

Here’s how the Subdivided Rectangles method works. (See Figure 4-23.)
1. Start by drawing a rectangle the size of the staircase you want to build.
Infer to the endpoints on this divided edge

Connect new endpoints

96
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

I strongly recommend modeling steps as a group, separate from the rest
of your building, and then moving them into position when they’re done.
You can read all about groups in Chapter 5.
2. With the Select tool, right-click one of the long edges of your rectangle
and choose Divide from the context menu.
If your staircase is wider than it is long, right-click one of the short
edges, instead.
3. Before you do anything else, type in the number of treads you want to
create and press Enter.
This command automatically divides your edge into many more edges,
eliminating the need to calculate how deep each of your treads needs to
be. Essentially, each of your new edges will become the side of one of
your treads.
4. Draw a line from the endpoint of each of your new edges, dividing
your original rectangle into many smaller rectangles.
You can use the Line or the Rectangle tool to do this; pick whichever
one you’re most comfortable with.
5. From one of the corners of your original rectangle, draw a vertical
edge the height of your staircase’s total rise.
6. Use the Divide command to split your new edge into however many
risers you need in your staircase (this is generally your number of
treads, plus one).
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to do this. The endpoints of your new, little edges
will tell you how high to make each of your steps.
7. Push/pull the rectangle that represents your last step to the correct
height.
Here’s where you need to use the “hover-click” technique that I describe
in the sidebar “More fun with Push/Pull,” earlier in this chapter. Just click
once to start pushing/pulling, hover over the endpoint that corresponds
to the height of that tread, and click again. Your step will automatically
be extruded to the right height.
It’s a good idea to start extruding your highest step first, but keep in
mind that it doesn’t go all the way to the top; you always have a riser
between your last step and your upper floor.
8. Repeat Step 7 for each of your remaining steps.
9. Use the Eraser to get rid of any extra edges you don’t need.
Be careful not to accidentally erase geometry on the part of your stair-
case you can’t see.
97
Chapter 4: Building Buildings

The Copied Profile method
This method for modeling a staircase relies, like the last one, on using
Push/Pull to create a three-dimensional form from a 2D face, but I think you’ll
agree it’s a lot more elegant. In a nutshell, you draw the profile — the side
view, sort of — of a single step, and then you copy as many steps as you
need, create a single face, and extrude the whole thing into shape. It’s breath-
takingly satisfying the first time you do it — one of those “guaranteed to
make you smile” SketchUp operations you’ll want to repeat for friends
(assuming you have nerdy friends like me).
Follow these steps to make a staircase using the Copied Profile method.
(See Figure 4-24.)
1. Start with a large, vertical face; make sure that it’s big enough for the
flight of stairs you want to build.
You’re going to end up pushing/pulling the whole shebang out of the
side of this face, just so you know.
2. In the bottom corner of the face, draw the profile (side outline) of a
single step.
I usually use the Line tool to do this, though you might want to use an
arc or two, depending on the level of detail you need. For a refresher on
drawing linesaccurately, check out Chapter 2.
3. Select all the edges that make up your step profile.

If you’re unfamiliar with how to make copies using the Move tool, refer
to the section on moving and copying, toward the end of Chapter 2.
5. Type in the number of steps you’d like to make, type the letter x, and
then press Enter.
For example, if you wanted ten steps, you would type in 10x. This tech-
nique repeats the copy operation you just did by however many times
you tell it to; adding an x at the end of the number tells SketchUp you
want to make copies.
6. Draw an edge to make sure that all your step profiles are part of a
single face.
You don’t have to do this step if your stair profiles already fit perfectly
on your vertical face; if you measured carefully, they just might. If you
can’t seem to make things work, read the sidebar “Working through
thick and thin,” earlier in this chapter. That might shed some light on
what’s going on.
7. Push/pull the staircase face out to be the width you need it to be.
This is the part that seems like magic to most folks; I don’t think it ever
gets old.
This method of stairway building also works great in combination with the
Follow Me tool, which I talk about in Chapter 6. Figure 4-25 should whet your
appetite — Follow Me is cool beans, all the way around.

Chapter 4: Building Buildings

The Treads Are Components method
Nothing beats this technique for modeling stairs, but I need to warn you; this
isn’t really beginner-level stuff. I include it because it’s something you should
eventually know how to do, so don’t sweat if it seems a little over your head
as you get started with SketchUp — just remember it’s here if you need it.
The Treads are Components method involves (you guessed it) making each
tread in your staircase into an instance of the same component. Basically,
you build one simple tread that’s the right depth, make it into a component,
and copy a bunch of instances into a full flight of stairs. Because every step is
“linked,” anything you do to one automatically happens to all of them. If you
don’t know the first thing about components, now would be a terrific time to
start from the beginning of Chapter 5 — it’ll fill you in.
Go through these steps to build a staircase using the Treads are Components
method:
1. Model a single step, including the tread and the riser.
You can make this very simple at this stage, if you want to; all that matters
is that the tread depth and the riser height are correct. You can fiddle
with everything else later. Figure 4-26 shows a simple example of this.
2. Make a component out of the step you just built.
Chapter 5 goes on and on about making and using components, but
here’s the short version (see Figure 4-27):
1. Select all the edges and faces that make up your step.
2. Choose Edit➪Make Component.
3. In the dialog box that opens, name your component “Step” and
then click the Create button.
Now your step is a component instance.
3. Move a copy of your step into position, above the first one (see
Figure 4-27).

Chapter 4: Building Buildings

4. Type in the total number of steps you want, type an x, and then press
Enter.
This is referred to as creating a linear array, meaning that you’re making
several copies at regular intervals, in the same direction you moved the
first one. Typing 12x generates 12 steps the same distance apart as the
first step and its copy. The last image on the right in Figure 4-27 shows
what I mean.
5. With the Select tool, double-click any one of your steps to edit all
instances of your component.
Everything besides the component instance you’re editing should fade
out a little.
6. Go nuts.
This really is the fun part. Having your staircase made up of multiple com-
ponent instances means that you have all the flexibility to make drastic
changes to the whole thing without ever having to repeat yourself. Add a
nosing (a bump at the leading edge of each tread), a stringer (a diagonal
piece of structure that supports all your steps), or even a handrail by get-
ting creative with how you modify a single component instance. Figure 4-28
shows some of what you can do. The color insert in this book shows the
Treads are Components method applied to building a circular stair.
Raising the Roof
If you’re lucky, the roof you want to build is fairly simple. Unfortunately,
home builders sometimes go a little crazy, creating roofs with dozens of dif-
ferent pitches (slopes), dormers, and other doodads that make modeling

them a nightmare. For this reason, I’m going to keep things pretty simple:
The following sections are dedicated to showing you how to identify and
model some of the basic roof forms. After that, I tell you about a great tool
you can use to assemble complicated roofs from less-complicated pieces —
it’s called Intersect with Model, and I think you’ll get a kick out of it.
The tricky thing about roofs is that they’re hard to see. If you want to make a
model of something that already exists, it helps to be able to get a good look
at it — that’s not always possible with roofs. One neat way to get a better
view of a roof you’re trying to build is to find it in Google Earth. For more
information, check out Chapter 11.
Before I dive in, what follows is a brief guide to general roof types and termi-
nology; this might come in handy for some of the explanations I give later on.
Figure 4-29 provides a visual accompaniment to my written descriptions:
 Flat roof: Flat roofs are just that, except they aren’t — if a roof were
really flat, it would collect water and leak. That’s why even roofs that
look flat are sloped very slightly.
 Pitched roof: Any roof that isn’t flat is technically a pitched roof.
 Shed roof: A shed roof is one that slopes from one side to the other.
 Gabled roof: Gabled roofs have two planes that slope away from a cen-
tral ridge.
 Hip roof: A hip roof is one where the sides and ends all slope together.
 Pitch: The angle of a roof surface.
 Gable: A gable is the pointy section of wall that sits under the peak of a
pitched roof.
 Eave: Eaves are the parts of a roof that overhang the building.
 Fascia: Fascia is the trim around the edge of a roof’s eaves where gutters
are sometimes attached.
 Soffit: A soffit is the underside of an overhanging eave.
 Rake: The rake is the part of a gabled roof that overhangs the gable.
 Valley: A valley is formed when two roof slopes come together; this is
where water flows when it rains.
 Dormer: Dormers are the little things that pop up above roof surfaces.
They often have windows, and they serve to make attic spaces more
usable.
 Parapet: Flat roofs that don’t have eaves have parapets: These are exten-
sions of the building’s walls that go up a few feet past the roof itself.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Building flat roofs with parapets
Good news — SketchUp was practically made for modeling these kinds of
roofs. By using a combination of the Offset tool and Push/Pull, you should be
able to make a parapet in under a minute. Follow these steps to see how (see
Figure 4-30):
1. With the Offset tool, click the top face of your building.
2. Click again somewhere inside the same face to create another face.
3. Type in the thickness of your parapet, and then press Enter.
This redraws your offset edges to be a precise distance from the edges
of your original face. How thick should your parapet be? It all depends
on your building, but most parapets are between 6 and 12 inches thick.
4. Push/pull your outside face (the one around the perimeter of your
roof) into a parapet.
5. Type in the height of your parapet, and then press Enter.
Creating eaves for buildings 
with pitched roofs
My favorite way to create eaves (roof overhangs) is to use the Offset tool.
Follow these steps to get the general idea (see Figure 4-31):
1. Make a group out of your whole building before you start modeling
the roof.
This makes it easier to keep your roof separate, which in turn makes
your model easier to work with.
Offset to the inside
Push/Pull your parapet up

Chapter 4: Building Buildings

2. Use the Line tool to create an outline of the parts of your roof that will
have eaves of the same height.
The goal here is to end up with a single face to offset. A lot of buildings
have complex roofs with eaves of all different heights; for the sake of
this step, just create a face which, when offset, will create roof over-
hangs in the right places.
Make a group
Retrace (or Copy and Paste) the roof line

Push/Pull a fascia thickness

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

3. Use the Offset tool to create an overhanging face.
For instructions on how to use Offset, see the section “Dusting off
SketchUp’s drafting tools,” earlier in this chapter.
4. Erase the edges of your original face.
A quick way to do this (with the Select tool) is to:
a. Double-click inside your first face; this selects both it and the
edges that define it.
b. Press Delete to erase everything that’s selected.
5. Push/pull your overhanging roof face to create a thick fascia.
Different roofs have fasciae of different thicknesses; if you don’t know
yours, just take your best guess.
Constructing gabled roofs
You can approach the construction of a gabled roof in a bunch of different
ways (every SketchUp expert has his or her favorite), but I find one method
in particular that works well on a consistent basis.
Follow these steps to build a gabled roof (see Figure 4-32):
1. Create a roof overhang, following the steps in the previous section.
Most gabled roofs have eaves, so you’ll probably need to do this for
your building.
2. Use the Protractor tool to create an angled guide at the corner of
your roof.
See the nearby sidebar, “Pitched roofs can make you crazy,” for more
information about drawing angled guides with the Protractor.
Architects and builders often express angles as rise over run ratios.
For example, a 4:12 (pronounced four in twelve) roof slope rises 4 feet
for every 12 feet it runs — a 1:12 slope is very shallow, and a 12:12 slope
is very steep. When using the Protractor tool, SketchUp’s VCB under-
stands angles expressed as ratios as well as those expressed in degrees.
Typing 6:12 yields a slope of 6 in 12.
3. Use the Line tool to draw a vertical edge from the midpoint of your
roof to the angled guide you created in Step 1.
The point at which your edge and your guide meet is the height of your
roof ridge.
107
Chapter 4: Building Buildings

4. Draw two edges from the top of your vertical line to the corners of
your roof.
This should cause two triangular faces to be created.
5. Erase the vertical edge you drew in Step 3 and the guide you drew in
Step 1.
6. Push/pull your triangular gable back.
If your gabled roof extends all the way to the other end of your building,
push/pull it back that far. If your roof runs into another section of roof
(as in Figure 4-33), extrude it back until it’s completely “buried.” The 
section “Sticking your roof together,” later in this chapter, has more
information on what to do when you’re making a complex roof.
7. Finish your eaves, fascia, soffit, and rake(s) however you want.
You find lots of different kinds of gabled roof details, so I can’t cover
them all, but Figure 4-34 shows a few common ones. Instead of writing
about them (which would get confusing anyway), I’ll let the pictures do
the talking.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Making hip roofs
Believe it or not, building a hip roof is easier than making a gabled one. Hip
roofs don’t have rakes, which makes them a lot less complicated to model.
Follow these steps to find out what I mean (see Figure 4-35):
1. Follow Steps 1 through 5 in the section “Constructing gabled roofs” to
begin making a hip roof.
2. Measure the distance from the midpoint of the gable to the corner of
the roof.
Because hip roofs have pitches that are the same on all sides, you can
use a simple trick to figure out where to locate the hip in your roof. It’s a
lot easier than using the Protractor; trust me.
3. With the Tape Measure, create a guide (the distance you just measured)
from the end of the gable.
4. Draw edges from the point on the ridge you just located to the corners
of your roof.
This does two things: It splits the sides of your roof into two faces each
and creates a new face (which you can’t see yet) under the gabled end of
your roof.
111
Chapter 4: Building Buildings
Pitched roofs can make you crazy
That fact notwithstanding, here are a few tips
that might make building your next one a little
easier:
 Start by making the rest of your building a
group. Always, always make a group out of
your whole building before you start working
on your roof. If you don’t, your geometry will
start sticking together, you’ll end up erasing
walls by accident, and eventually, you’ll lose
your mind. On top of that, it’s really handy to
be able to separate your roof from the rest of
your building whenever you want. You can
also group your roof, if that makes sense for
what you’re doing. Check out Chapter 5 for
a full rundown on making and using groups.
 Draw a top view of your roof on paper first.
I find this really helps me figure things out.
Adding measurements and angles is even
better — anything so that you know what
you need to do when you get around to
using SketchUp.
 Learn to use the Protractor tool. This tool
(which is on the Tools menu) is for measur-
ing angles and, more importantly, creating
angled guides. Because sloped roofs are all
about angles, you probably need to use the
Protractor sooner or later. The best way to
find out how it works is to open the Instructor
dialog box by choosing Window➪Instructor
and then activating the Protractor tool.

5. Erase the three edges that form the gabled end of your roof, revealing
the “hipped” pitch underneath.
Neat, huh? Now all three faces of your roof are the same pitch — just the
way they should be.
6. If appropriate, repeat the process on the other end of your roof.
Measure half-width of your gable
Create a guide that distance
from end of gable
Draw edges connecting
ridge and corners
Erase the edges that form the gable
Now you have a hip

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Sticking your roof together
In general, the newer and more expensive a house is, the more roof slopes it
has. Who knows why this is the case; it probably has something to do with
folks thinking complex-roofed houses look more like French chateaus.
Whether or not crazy roofs (there’s my bias showing again) are a good thing
isn’t relevant to this book, but I know one thing for sure: They’re a pain in
the, um, gutters to model.
Getting to know Intersect with Model
Luckily, SketchUp has a relatively little-known feature that often helps when it
comes to making roofs with lots of pitches: Intersect with Model. Here’s what
you need to know about this terrific little tool:
 Intersect with Model makes new geometry from existing geometry.
That’s how it works: It takes faces you’ve selected and creates edges
wherever they intersect. You use Intersect with Model in cases where
you need to create forms that are the union (both put together), difference
(one minus the other), or intersection (the part they have in common) of
other forms. Figure 4-36 shows what I’m talking about: Perhaps I want to
make a model that’s a cube with a cylinder-shaped chunk taken out of it.
I would model the cube and model the cylinder. After positioning them
carefully, I could then use Intersect with Model to create edges where the
two shapes’ faces come together. After that, I would use the Eraser to
get rid of the edges I didn’t want — the rest of the cylinder, in this case.
 Intersect with Model and the Eraser tool go hand in hand. Anytime you
use Intersect with Model, you need to follow up by spending some time
deleting the geometry you don’t want. This isn’t a bad thing, but it does
mean that you need to be good at orbiting, zooming, and panning around
your model. It also means that you need to be handy with the Eraser.

113
Chapter 4: Building Buildings

 Most of the time, choose to Intersect with Model. This tool has three
different modes (just introduced in SketchUp 6), but the majority of the
time, you’ll end up using the basic one. Here’s what all three of them do:
• Intersect with Model: Creates edges everywhere your selected
faces intersect with other faces in your model — whether the other
faces are selected or not.
• Intersect Selected: Only creates edges where selected faces inter-
sect with other selected faces. This is handy if you’re trying to be a
little bit more precise.
• Intersect with Context: This one’s a little trickier: Choosing this
option creates edges where faces within the same group or compo-
nent intersect; that’s why it’s only available when you’re editing a
group or component.
 Intersect with Model doesn’t have a button. To use it, you have to either:
• Right-click and choose it from the context menu.
• Choose Edit➪Intersect.
114
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Complex hip roofs and the Follow Me tool
Ready to see something really cool? SketchUp
has a tool called Follow Me, which I describe in
detail in Chapter 5. You can use Follow Me to
create complex hip roofs in about one-fifth the
time it would normally take you to make them —
sometimes even less. At its core, Follow Me works
a bit like Push/Pull, except it lets you extrude
faces along predetermined paths. You can use it
to create very complicated geometry — the
kind of stuff you probably wouldn’t be able to
make without it.
When it comes to hip roofs, the Follow Me tech-
nique only works if your roof meets the follow-
ing conditions:
 The pitch needs to be the same on all roof
surfaces.
 The roof needs to be “hipped” all the way
around.
Follow these steps to use Follow Me to create
a complex hip roof (the following images tell the
story):
1. Over the widest part of your building, draw
a triangle that represents the slope of your
roof. It should only be a half-gable, as
shown in the images.
2. Select the top surface of your building.
3. With the Follow Me tool (available on the
Tools menu), click the half-roof profile you
drew in Step 1 once.
4. Select your whole roof by triple-clicking it
with the Select tool; I like to hide the rest
of my building at this point, too.
5. Right-click anywhere on the roof and
choose Intersect➪Intersect with Model
from the context menu.

115
Chapter 4: Building Buildings
6. Use the Eraser to clean up your roof by
erasing any geometry that isn’t supposed to
be part of it — you’ll find plenty. You’ll
probably also have to draw in edges every
now and then. If you make a mistake, just
use Undo and try again.
Select the whole roof, right click, and
then choose Intersect with Model

116
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
When all else fails, use the Line tool
Fancy tools like Follow Me and Intersect with
Model are useful most of the time, but for some
roofs, you just have to resort to drawing good
old edges. If that’s the case, you’d better get
familiar with most of the stuff at the beginning of
Chapter 2, because you’re going to be inferenc-
ing like there’s no tomorrow. SketchUp users
who really know what they’re doing can draw
anything with the Line tool and the Eraser too; it’s
a beautiful thing to watch. Unfortunately, it’s not a
beautiful thing to write (or read) about in a black-
and-white book, so I can’t show you as much
“modeling from first principles” stuff as I’d like.
All the same, check out the following figure. In
it, I use the Line tool and SketchUp’s venerable
inference engine to add a gabled dormer to a
sloped roof surface. With practice, you can, too.
Draw an edge on the face of the roof
Draw a vertical face
Draw edges all the way back to the sloped face
Connect the edges

Most 3D modeling programs let you do Boolean operations, meaning that
you’re encouraged to make models by adding, subtracting, and intersecting
different shapes to make new ones. For solids modelers (like SolidWorks,
Inventor, and Form(Z), this makes sense, because this paradigm is a lot like
sculpting with clay. But because SketchUp is more paper-like than clay-like
(it’s not clay-like at all, come to think of it), Boolean operations are not tech-
nically possible. Intersect with Model is about as close as SketchUp comes to
letting you work this way.
Using Intersect with Model to make roofs
When it comes to creating roofs, you can use Intersect with Model to com-
bine a whole bunch of gables, hips, dormers, sheds, and so on into a single
roof. It’s no cakewalk, and it requires a fair amount of planning, but it works
great when nothing else will.
Figure 4-37 shows a complicated roof with several different elements. Gabled
roofs have been pushed/pulled into the main hip roof form at all different
heights, but edges don’t exist where all the different faces meet. In the steps
that follow, I use Intersect with Model to create the edges I want and then I
use the Eraser to clean up my mess:
1. Select the whole roof.
You can do this in a number of different ways, but the one that I find
works the best is to first hide the group that contains the rest of your
building, and then draw a big selection box around the whole roof with
the Select tool.
2. Choose Edit➪Intersect➪Intersect Selected.
This tells SketchUp to go through and create edges everywhere you
have faces that intersect — everywhere they “pass through” each other
without an edge.
3. Get out your Eraser and carefully delete all the extra geometry on
the inside of your roof.
I won’t lie; this can be a lot of work. But it’s a whole lot easier than
using the Line tool and SketchUp’s inference engine to figure out
where everything should go. The last image in Figure 4-37 shows the
end result.

 Lumping together geometry into groups

 Taking stock of your model with the Outliner
 Avoiding problems by using layers the right way
 Looking at how everything works together
S
tarting with this chapter, I might sound like your mom: “Clean up your
room! Don’t leave your toys in the driveway! Put your dishes in the sink!”
As everybody knows, living life can be a messy ordeal, and modeling in
SketchUp is no exception. As you crank away at whatever it is you’re build-
ing, you will reach a time when you stop, orbit around, and wonder how your
model got to be such a pigsty. It’s inevitable.
Luckily, SketchUp includes a bunch of different ways to keep your geometry
(edges and faces) from getting out of control. Because big, unwieldy, disorga-
nized models are a pain to work with — they can slow your computer, or
even cause SketchUp to crash — you should definitely get in the habit of
“working clean” (as cooking shows like to call it). As I said earlier, I don’t
mean to nag; I just want you to be familiar with the techniques experienced
SketchUp modelers use to keep from going insane.
In this chapter, I present the four main tools that SketchUp provides for 
organizing your model. In the first section, I outline all four and talk about
what they’re for. Then I dive in to each one in a good amount of detail,
describing how to use them and how not to use them (are you listening,
layers?). This chapter ends with a detailed example of how all four methods
can be used together to make your life easier; I show you how I organize a
model of my house.

Taking Stock of Your 
Organization Options
When it comes to sorting out the thousands of edges and faces in your model,
it’s all about lumping things together into useful sets. After you’ve separated
things out, you can name them, hide them, and even lock them so that you
(or somebody else) can’t mess them up. This whole chapter is dedicated to
the different tools SketchUp provides to help keep your model straight, but
here’s a brief rundown of each of them, just to put things in perspective:
 Groups: Making a group is like gluing together some of the geometry 
in your model. Edges and faces that are grouped together act like mini-
models inside your main model; you use groups to make it easier to
select, move, hide, and otherwise work with parts of your model that
need to be kept separate.
 Components: I wish there was a way to use the typography in this book
to convey the relative importance of certain topics; if there was, the
word COMPONENTS would be printed 4 inches high, and it would be col-
ored neon green. SketchUp components are a lot like groups, but they
have a lot of extra handy properties. You use components when your
model includes a bunch of copies of the same thing, like windows, furni-
ture, and trees. After you’re up and running with SketchUp, you’ll end up
using components all the time.
 Outliner: The Outliner is a dialog box that’s basically a fancy list of all
the groups and components in your SketchUp model. It shows you
which groups and components are nested inside other ones, lets you
assign names for them, and gives you an easy way to hide parts of your
model you don’t want to see. If you use a lot of components (and you
should), the Outliner may well become your new best friend.
 Layers: This is where a lot of people reading this book let out a big sigh
of relief. “Thank goodness,” they’re thinking, “I was beginning to think
SketchUp doesn’t have layers.” For people who are used to organizing
content in other software programs, layers are usually where it’s at — you
put different kinds of things on different layers, name the layers, and then
turn them on and off when you need to. It’s a pretty simple concept.
In SketchUp, layers are similar, but there’s a problem: Using layers the
wrong way can seriously mess up your model. I’m not kidding. If you’re
going to use them, read the section “Discovering the Ins and Outs of
Layers,” later in this chapter. Not doing so could result in serious injury
or even death (depending on how upset you get when your 50-hour
model gets ruined).
120
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Grouping Things Together
Anyone who’s worked with SketchUp for even a short time has probably
noticed something: SketchUp geometry (the edges and faces that make up
your model) is sticky. That is to say, stuff in your model wants to stick to
other stuff. The people who invented SketchUp built it this way on purpose;
the reasons why would take a while to explain. Suffice it to say, making and
using groups are the keys to keeping the stuff in your model from sticking
together. For additional help, check out this book’s companion Web site; see
the Introduction for details.
You have many reasons you need to make groups; here are a few of them:
 Grouped geometry doesn’t stick to anything. Perhaps you’ve modeled
a building, and you want to add a roof. You want to be able to remove
the roof by moving it out of the way with the Move tool, but every time
you try, you end up pulling the whole top part of the house along with it
(like the middle image in Figure 5-1). Making the roof a separate group
allows you to let it sit on top of your house without sticking there,
making it easier to deal with, as shown in the right image in Figure 5-1.
 Using groups makes it easier to work with your model. You can select
all the geometry in a group by clicking it once with the Select tool.
You can move groups around and make copies with the Move tool. To
edit a group, you double-click it with the Select tool. To stop editing it,
you click outside it, somewhere else in your modeling window.
 You can name groups. If you turn a selection of geometry in your
model into a group, you can give it a name. In the Outliner (which I talk
about later in this chapter) you can see a list of the groups (and compo-
nents) in your model, and if you’ve given them names, you can see what
you have.

Chapter 5: Keeping Your Model Organized

Follow these steps to create a group:
1. Select the geometry (edges and faces) you’d like to turn into a group.
The simplest way to select multiple entities (edges and faces) is to click
them one at a time with the Select tool while holding down Shift. You can
also use the Select tool to drag a box around the entities you want to
select, but this can be tough, depending on where they are. For more
information on making selections, check out Chapter 2.
2. Choose Edit➪Make Group.
You can also right-click and choose Make Group from the context menu
that pops up.
If you want to “ungroup” the geometry in a group, you need to explode it.
Right-click the group and choose Explode from the context menu. The edges
and faces that were grouped together aren’t grouped together anymore.
Working with Components
Even though components are incredibly important, there’s nothing too magi-
cal about them — they’re just groupings of geometry (edges and faces) that
make working in SketchUp faster, easier, and more fun. In a lot of ways, com-
ponents are really just fancy groups — they do a lot of the same things. In the
following sections, I talk about what makes components special and give
some examples of what you can do with them. Next, I give a quick tour of the
Components dialog box, pointing out where components live and how you
can organize them. The last part of this section is devoted to making your
own. It’s not hard, and after you can make components, you’ll be on your
way to SketchUp stardom (check out Chapter 13 for more on sharing your
SketchUp models with the world).
What makes components so great?
By now, you’ve probably figured out that I’m a big fan of using components
whenever you can. Here’s why:
 Everything that’s true about groups is true about components. That’s
right: Components are just like groups, only better (in some ways, at
least). Components don’t stick to the rest of your model, you can give
them meaningful names, and you can select them, move them, copy
them, and edit them easily — just like you can with groups.
122
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

 Components update automatically. When you use multiple copies
(these are called instances) of the same component in your model,
they’re all spookily linked. Changing one makes all of them change,
which saves loads of time. Consider a window component that I created
and made two copies of, as shown in Figure 5-2. When I add something
(in this case, some shutters) to one instance of that component, all the
instances are updated. Now I have three windows, and they all have
shutters.
 Using components can help you keep track of quantities. You can use
the Components dialog box to count, select, substitute, and otherwise
manage all the component instances in your model. Figure 5-3 shows a
great big (and ugly) building I designed to go with the window compo-
nent I made. Because they’re component instances, I have a lot more
control than I would have had if they weren’t.

Chapter 5: Keeping Your Model Organized

 You can make a component cut an opening automatically. Perhaps
you’ve made a window (which I have) and you’d like that window to
poke a hole through whatever surface you stick it to (which I do).
SketchUp components can be set up to cut their own openings in faces.
These openings are even temporary; when you delete the component,
the hole disappears. Check out Figure 5-4 to see this in action.
Components that are set up to automatically cut openings can only do
so through a single face. Even if your wall is two faces thick, your com-
ponents will cut through only one of them.
 You can use your components in other models. It’s a simple operation to
make any component you build available for use whenever you’re working
in SketchUp, no matter what model you’re working on. If you have a group
of parts or other things you always use, making your own component
library can save you a lot of time and effort. There’s more information
about creating your own component libraries later in this section.
 Components are great for making symmetrical models. Because you
can flip a component instance and keep working on it, and because com-
ponent instances automatically update when you change one of them,
using components is a great way to model anything that’s symmetrical.
And if you look around, you’ll notice that most of the things we use are
symmetrical. Chapter 6 dives headlong into modeling symmetrical
things like couches and hatchbacks; Figure 5-5 shows some examples
from SketchUp’s default component library.
Exploring the Components dialog box
It’s all fine and well that SketchUp lets you turn bits of your models into compo-
nents, I suppose, but wouldn’t it be nice if you had someplace to keep them?
And wouldn’t it be great if you could use components made by other people to
spiff up your model, instead of having to build everything yourself? As you’ve
probably already guessed, both of these things are possible, and both involve
the Components dialog box, which you can find on the Window menu.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Here’s something you need to realize: Any SketchUp model on your computer
can be brought into your current file as a component. That’s because com-
ponents are really just SketchUp files embedded in other SketchUp files.
When you create a component in your model, you’re effectively creating a
new, nested SketchUp file. Neat, huh?
The Components dialog box is made up of four major areas, which I describe
in the following sections.
Info and buttons
I don’t really know what to call this part of the dialog box, so I’ll call it like 
it is: It’s for information and buttons. Figure 5-6 points out its elements, and
here’s what everything does:
 Name: This is where the name of the component you select appears.
If it’s a component in your model, it’s editable. If it’s in one of the default
libraries, it’s not. A component is considered to be in your model if it
appears in your In Model library, which you can read about in the sec-
tion “The Select pane,” later in this chapter.
 Description: Some, but not all, components have descriptions asso-
ciated with them. You can write one when you’re creating a new 
component, or you can add one to an existing component in your
model. Just like the name, you can only edit descriptions for models 
in your In Model library.
Figure 5-5:

these things

125
Chapter 5: Keeping Your Model Organized

 Display Secondary Selection Pane button: Clicking this button opens a
second view of your libraries at the bottom of the Components dialog
box. You use this to manage the components on your computer system.
 Make Component button: Clicking this button creates a component
from whatever geometry you have selected in your modeling window.
You have other ways to create new components, which I explain in the
next section.
 Get Model from the 3D Warehouse button: The 3D Warehouse is an
online repository of thousands — maybe hundreds of thousands — of
SketchUp components that you can use in your model. Read all about
the 3D Warehouse in Chapter 11.
The Select pane
This is where your components “live” (if they can be said to live anywhere).
You use the Select pane to view, organize, and choose components. Figure 5-7
shows the Select pane in all its glory.
 Back and Forward buttons: Use these to toggle between component
libraries that you’ve viewed recently.
 In Model Library button: SketchUp automatically keeps track of the
components you’ve used in your model and puts a copy of each of them
in your In Model library. Each SketchUp file you create has its own In
Model library, which contains the components that exist in that model.
Clicking the In Model Library button displays the components in your
In Model library, if you have any.
 Libraries drop-down list: Clicking this list shows a list of the component
libraries you have on your computer system. SketchUp comes preinstalled
with a few default libraries, but you can create you own if you want to.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Libraries are essentially folders on your computer that contain SketchUp
files. When you tell SketchUp that a particular folder is a component
library, it displays each SketchUp model in that folder as a component
that you can use in whatever model you’re working on at the moment.
For more information on creating your own libraries of components,
keep reading.
 Components window: This window displays the components in the 
currently selected component library. Click a component to use it in
your model.
 Library Options flyout menu: Here’s where you manage the component
libraries on your computer system. A bunch of options exist, so I’d
better explain what most of them mean:
• Open an Existing Library: Lets you choose a folder on your com-
puter system to use as a component library. Any SketchUp models
in that folder can be used as components in your current model.
• Create a New Library: Allows you to create a folder somewhere on
your computer system that you can use as a component library.
This is handy if you have a number of components that you use all
the time; putting them all in one place makes them easier to find.
• Save Library As: When you choose this option, SketchUp lets you
save your In Model library (consisting of all the components in your
current model) as a library all by itself. As you can imagine, this
option is only available when you’re viewing your In Model library.

• Add Library to Favorites: If you have a library you use a lot, choose
this option to add it to the Favorites section of the Libraries drop-
down list. That way, it’ll be easier to get to in a hurry.
• Expand: Because components can be made up of other, nested com-
ponents, a component you use in your model might really be lots of
components. Choosing Expand displays all the components in your
model, whether or not they’re nested inside other components.
Most of the time, you’ll probably want to leave Expand deselected.
• Purge Unused: Choose this to get rid of any components in your
In Model library that aren’t in your model anymore. Be sure to use
this before you send your SketchUp file to someone else; it’ll seri-
ously reduce your file size and make things a whole lot neater.
• Get More: Bonanza! Choosing this option sends you directly to a
Google Web site (as long as you’re online), where you can down-
load extra libraries of components — thousands of them. Better
yet, they’re all free. All the Bonus Packs are great, but I’d definitely
recommend getting Architecture (which includes furniture),
Transportation (to see how experts model vehicles), and People
(which includes a model of me — I’m the guy in the long, black coat).
128
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Select and replace all your troubles away
On top of the all the buttons, menus, and windows
you can immediately see in the Select pane of
the Components dialog box, some hidden options
exist that most people don’t find until they go
looking for them; they’re on the context menu
that pops up when you right-click a component
in your In Model library:
 Select Instances: Perhaps you have 15
instances (copies) of the same component
in your model, and you want to select them
all. Just make sure that you’re viewing your
In Model library, and then right-click the
component (in the Components dialog box)
whose instances you want to select all of.
Choose Select Instances, and your work’s
done. This can save you tons of time, par-
ticularly if you have component instances
all over the place.
 Replace Selected: Now you might want to
swap in a different component for one that’s
in your model. Simply select the component
instances (in your modeling window) that
you want to replace, and then right-click the
component (in the Components dialog box)
that you want to use instead. Choose
Replace Selected from the context menu to
perform the swap.
Ready for an even better tip? Use Select Instances
and Replace Selected together to help you work
more efficiently. Instead of placing 20 big, heavy
tree components in your model (which can seri-
ously slow things down), use a smaller, simpler
component instead (like a stick). When you’re fin-
ished modeling, use Select Instances to select all
the stand-in components at once, and then use
Replace Selected to swap in the real component. 

The Edit pane
Because the options in this part of the Components dialog box are similar to the
ones you get when you make a new component, you should check out the sec-
tion “Creating your own components,” later in this chapter, for the whole scoop.
You can only use the options in the Edit pane on components in your In
Model library — everything will be grayed out for components that “live” in
any other place.
The Statistics pane
Can you remember who won the 1975 Super Bowl? How many home runs did
Hank Aaron hit in his career? Do you always check the nutrition information
panel on food packaging? You might be a sucker for statistics, and if so, wel-
come home. . . .
Even if you’re not, the Statistics pane is a useful place to spend some time.
You use it to keep track of all the details related to whatever component you
have selected in the Components dialog box. (See Figure 5-8.) This is espe-
cially useful for doing the following things:
 Checking the size of your components: The information in the Edges and
Faces areas of this pane lets you know how much geometry is in a compo-
nent. If you’re worried about file size or your computer’s performance,
try to use small components — ones with low numbers of faces and edges.
 Seeing what components are inside your components: The Component
Instances line lists how many component instances are in your selected
component. If you switch from All Geometry to Components in the drop-
down list at the top of the pane, you can see a list of all the constituent
components: subcomponents within your main component.
Figure 5-8:
The
Statistics
pane of the
Components
dialog box:

129
Chapter 5: Keeping Your Model Organized

The Statistics pane doesn’t show details for components you have selected in
your actual model; it only shows information about the component that’s
selected in the Select pane of the Components dialog box. To see information
about whatever component (or other kind of object) you have selected in your
modeling window, use the Entity Info dialog box (located in the Window menu).
Creating your own components
Now that I’ve got you all jazzed up about the wonder and mystery of using
components in your models, I’ll bet you can’t wait to start making your own.
At least I hope so — using components is probably the single best SketchUp
habit you can develop. Here’s why:
 Components keep file sizes down. When you use several instances of a
single component, SketchUp only has to remember the information for
one of them. This means that your files are smaller, which in turn means
that you’ll have an easier time e-mailing, uploading, and opening them
on your computer.
 Components show up in the Outliner. If you’re a person who’s at all
interested in not wasting time hunting around for things you’ve mis-
placed, you should create lots of components. Doing so means that
you’ll be able to see, hide, unhide, and rearrange them in the Outliner,
which I go over later in this chapter.
 Components can save your sanity. Hooray! You’ve finished a model of
the new airport — and it only took three weeks! Too bad the planning
commission wants you to add a sunshade detail to every one of the
1,300 windows in the project. If you made that window a component,
you’re golden. If, on the other hand, that window isn’t a component,
you’re going to be spending a very long night holding hands with your
computer mouse.
130
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Making your own doors and windows
If you’re kind of nerdy like I am, nothing beats
making your own window and door compo-
nents. Here’s what you need to know (check out
the illustration that follows this sidebar for visual
instructions):
1. Start by drawing a rectangle on a vertical
surface, like a wall.
2. Delete the face you just created to make a
hole in your vertical surface.
3. Select all four edges of the hole you just
created. Then right-click one of the edges
and choose Make Component from the
context menu.

131
Chapter 5: Keeping Your Model Organized
4. Make sure that Glue to Any, Cut Opening,
and Replace Selection with Component are
all selected; then click the Create button to
create your new component.
5. With the Select tool, double-click your
new component (in the modeling window)
to edit it; the rest of your model will appear
to fade back a bit.
6. Use the modeling tools just like you always
would to keep building your door or
window any way you want.
7. When you’re done, click outside your com-
ponent to stop editing it.
If the opening you create ever closes up, one of
two things probably happened:
 A new surface was created. Try deleting
the offending surface to see whether that
fixes things; it usually does.
 The cutting boundary was messed up. The
cutting boundary consists of the edges that
define the hole your component is cutting.
If you take away those edges, SketchUp
doesn’t know where to cut the hole any-
more. Drawing them back in usually sets
things straight.

Making a new component
Creating simple components is a pretty easy process, but making more com-
plicated ones — components that automatically cut openings, stick to sur-
faces, and always face the viewer — can be a little trickier. Follow these
steps, regardless of what kind of component you’re trying to make:
1. Select the edges and faces (at least two) you’d like to turn into a 
component.
For more information on making selections, see Chapter 2.
2. Choose Edit➪Create Component.
The Create Component dialog box opens. (See Figure 5-9.)
3. Give your new component a name and description.
Of these two, the name is by far the most important. Make sure to
choose one that’s descriptive enough that you’ll understand it when you
open your model a year from now.
4. Set the alignment options for your new component.
Wondering what the heck all this stuff means? I don’t blame you — it can
be a bit confusing the first time. For a quick introduction to each option
and tips for using it, check out Table 5-1.
5. Select the Replace Selection with Component check box, if it isn’t
already selected.
This drops your new component into your model right where your
selected geometry was, saving you from having to insert it yourself from
the Components dialog box.
6. Click the Create button to create your new component.

Components can only cut through one face at a time. If your model’s walls
are two faces thick, you’ll have to cut your window and door openings 
manually.
Editing, exploding, and locking component instances
Right-clicking a component instance in your modeling window opens a con-
text menu that offers lots of useful choices; here’s what some of them let
you do:
 Edit Component: To edit all instances of a component at once, right-
click any instance and choose Edit Component from the context menu.
The rest of your model will fade back, and you’ll see a dashed bounding
box around your component. When you’re done, click somewhere out-
side the bounding box to finish editing; your changes have been made in
every instance of that component in your model.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

 Make Unique: Sometimes you want to make changes to only one or a
few of the instances of a component in your model. In this case, select
the instance(s) you want to edit, right-click one of them, and choose
Make Unique from the context menu. This turns the instances you
selected into a separate component. Now edit any of them; only those
instances you “made unique” will reflect your changes.
 Explode: When you explode a component instance, you’re effectively
turning it back into regular ol’ geometry. Explode is a lot like Ungroup in
other software programs (in SketchUp, you use Explode to “disassemble”
both components and groups).
 Lock: Locking a group or a component instance means that nobody —
including you — can mess with it until it’s unlocked. You should use this
on parts of your model you don’t want to change accidentally. To unlock
something, right-click on it and choose Unlock.
Falling in Love with the Outliner
I’m a person who really likes to make lists. Not only that, but I love to look at
lists — information arranged neatly into collapsible rows is the kind of thing
that brings a tear to my eye.
Now, before you decide that I ought to be locked in a small room with cush-
ions on the walls, consider this: most halfway-complicated SketchUp models
consist of dozens, if not hundreds, of groups and components. These groups
and components are nested inside each other like Russian dolls, and a lot of
them are heavy, computer-killing behemoths like three-dimensional trees and
shrubs.
Without a list, how are you going to manage all your groups and compo-
nents? How are you going to keep track of what you have, hide what you
don’t want to see, and (more importantly) unhide what you do want to see?
I thought so — I guess it turns out I’m not so crazy after all.
Taking a good look at the Outliner
You can open the Outliner dialog box by choosing Window➪Outliner. Figure 5-11
shows what it looks like when a model consists of a simple room with some
furniture in it. The individual items of furniture are all components I found in
the Components dialog box (after I downloaded the Architecture Bonus Pack,
that is). You can find out more about component bonus packs in the section
“Working with Components,” earlier in this chapter).
135
Chapter 5: Keeping Your Model Organized

The Outliner dialog box has the following features:
 Search filter box: If you type a word or phrase into this box, the
Outliner will only show the items in your model that include that word
or phrase in their name. If I were to type in coffee, only the coffee table
component would be visible.
 Outliner Options flyout menu: This handy little menu contains three
options:
• Expand All: Choose this option to have the Outliner show all the
nested groups and components in your model — every last one of
them (provided they’re on visible layers).
It’s important to note that the Outliner only shows groups and
components that exist on layers that are visible in your model. 
In other words, anything on a hidden layer won’t appear in the
Outliner, so you should be extra careful if you’re using both the
Outliner and layers to organize your model. You can read all about
layers in the next section.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

• Collapse All: This option collapses your Outliner view so that 
you only see top-level groups and components — ones that aren’t
nested inside other groups and components.
• Sort by Name: Select this option to make the Outliner list the
groups and components in your model alphabetically.
 Outliner List window: This is where all the groups and components in
your model are listed. Groups and components that have nested groups
and components inside them have an Expand/Collapse toggle arrow next
to their names. When they’re expanded, the constituent groups and
components appear as an indented list below them.
Making good use of the Outliner
If you’re going to use lots of groups and components (and you should),
having the Outliner open on your screen is one of the best things you can 
do to model efficiently. Here’s why:
 Use the Outliner to control visibility. Instead of right-clicking groups
and components in your model to hide them, use the Outliner instead.
Just right-click the name of any element in the Outliner and choose Hide.
When you do, the element is hidden in your modeling window, and its
name is grayed out and italicized in the Outliner. To unhide it, just right-
click its name in the Outliner and choose Unhide.
 Drag and drop elements in the Outliner to change their nesting order.
Don’t like having the component you just created nested inside another
component? Simply drag its name in the Outliner to the top of the list.
This moves it to the top level, meaning that it’s not embedded in any-
thing. You can also use the Outliner to drag groups and components
“into” other ones, too.
 Find and select things using the Outliner. When you select something
in the Outliner, its name gets highlighted, and it gets selected in your
modeling window. This is a much easier way to select nested groups 
and components, especially if you’re working with a complex model. 
Discovering the Ins and Outs of Layers
I’m gonna give it to you straight: Layers are a very useful part of SketchUp,
and they can make your life a lot easier. Layers can also be a major source of
heartache, because they can really mess up your model if you’re not careful.
I’ll try to get you going on the right track. . . .
137
Chapter 5: Keeping Your Model Organized

What layers are — and what they’re not
In a 2D program like Photoshop or Illustrator, the concept of layers makes a
lot of sense: You can have content on any number of layers, sort of like a
stack of transparencies. You find a distinct order to your layers, so anything
that’s on the top layer is visually “in front of” everything on all the other
layers. Figure 5-12 shows what I’m talking about.
But hold on a second — SketchUp isn’t a 2D program; it’s a 3D program. So how
can it have layers? How can objects in three-dimensional space be “layered”
on top of each other so that things on higher layers appear “in front of” things
on lower ones? In short, they can’t — it’s impossible. This means that layers
in SketchUp are different from layers in most other graphics programs, and
that’s confusing for lots of people.
SketchUp has a layers system because some of the very first SketchUp users
were architects, and many, many architects use drawing software called
AutoCAD. Because AutoCAD uses layers extensively, layers were incorpo-
rated into SketchUp to maximize compatibility between the two products.
When you import a layered AutoCAD file into SketchUp, its layers show up 
as SketchUp layers, which is pretty convenient.
So what are SketchUp layers for? Layers are for controlling visibility. You use
them to gather particular kinds of geometry so that you can easily turn it on
(make it visible) and turn it off (make it invisible) when you need to. That
said, layers don’t work the same way as groups and components; your edges
and faces aren’t isolated from other parts of your model, which can cause
major confusion if you’re not careful. Take a look at the section “Staying out
of trouble,” later in this chapter, to find out more.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Using layers in SketchUp
You can find the Layers dialog box on the Window menu. It’s a pretty simple
piece of machinery, as you can see in Figure 5-13. Here’s what everything does:
 Add Layer: Clicking this button adds a new layer to your SketchUp file.
 Delete Layer: Click this button to delete the currently selected layer. If
anything is on the layer you’re trying to delete, SketchUp will ask you
what you want to do with it; choose an option and select Delete.
 Layer Options flyout menu: This contains the following useful options:
• Purge: When you choose Purge, SketchUp deletes all the layers
that don’t contain geometry. This is a handy way to keep your file
neat and tidy.
• Color by Layer: Notice how each layer in the list has a little color
swatch next to it? Choosing Color by Layer temporarily changes all
the colors in your SketchUp model to match the colors assigned to
each layer. To see what’s on each layer, this is the way to go.
 Layers list: This is a list of all the layers in your SketchUp file. You need
to know about these three columns:
• Name: Double-click a layer’s name to edit it. Giving your layers
meaningful names is a good way to quickly find what you’re look-
ing for.
• Visible: This check box is the heart and soul of the Layers dialog
box. When it’s selected, the geometry on that layer is visible; when
it’s not, it’s not.
• Color: You can choose to view your model using Color by Layer,
which I describe in the previous list. You can choose which color
to assign to each layer by clicking the Color swatch.

Chapter 5: Keeping Your Model Organized

Adding a new layer
Follow these steps to add a layer to your SketchUp file:
1. Choose Window➪Layers.
This opens the Layers dialog box.
2. Click the Add Layer button to add a new layer to the Layers list.
If you want, you can double-click your new layer to rename it.
Moving entities to a different layer
Moving things from one layer to another involves using the Entity Info dialog
box. Follow these steps to move an entity (an edge, face, group, or compo-
nent) to a different layer:
1. Select the entity or entities you want to move to another layer.
Keep in mind that you should only be moving groups and components to
other layers; have a look at the next section in this chapter to find out why.
2. Choose Window➪Entity Info.
This opens the Entity Info dialog box. You can also open it by right-clicking
your selected entities and choosing Entity Info from the context menu.
3. In the Entity Info dialog box, choose a layer from the Layer drop-
down list.
Your selected entities are now on the layer you chose from the list.
Staying out of trouble
As I said before, layers can be really helpful, but you need to know how to
use them; if you don’t, bad things can happen. Here’s some more detail:
 Do all your modeling on Layer0. Always make sure that Layer0 is your
current layer when you’re working. Keeping all your “loose” geometry
(that’s not part of a group or component) together in one place is the
only way to make sure that you don’t end up with edges and faces all
over the place. SketchUp, unfortunately, lets you put geometry on what-
ever layer you want, which means that you can end up with a face on
one layer, and one or more of the edges that define it on another. When
that happens, it’s next to impossible to work out where everything
belongs; you’ll spend literally hours trying to straighten things out. This
property of SketchUp’s layers system is a major stumbling point for new
SketchUp users; knowing to keep everything on Layer0 can save you a
lot of anguish.
140
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

 Only put groups and components on other layers. If you’re going to use
layers, follow this rule: Never put anything on a layer other than Layer0
unless it’s a group or a component. Doing so ensures that you don’t end
up with stray edges and faces on separate layers.
 Use layers to organize big groups of similar things. More complicated
SketchUp models often include things like trees, furniture, cars, and
people. These kinds of things are almost always already components, 
so they’re perfect candidates for being kept on separate layers. I often
make a layer called Trees and put all my tree components on it. This
makes it easy to hide and show all my trees all at once. This speeds my
workflow by improving my computer’s performance (trees are usually
big, complicated components with lots of faces).
 Don’t use layers to organize interconnected geometry; use the
Outliner instead. By “interconnected geometry,” I mean things like
building floor levels and staircases. These are parts of your model that
aren’t meant to be physically separate from other parts (like vehicles
and people are). When you put Level 1 on one layer and Level 2 on
another, more often than not, you’ll get confused about what belongs
where: Is the staircase part of Level 1 or Level 2? Instead, make a group
for Level 1, a group for Level 2, and a group for the staircase — you’ll
need less headache medicine at the end of the day.
 Feel free to use layers to iterate. Iteration is the process of doing multiple
versions of the same thing. Lots of designers work this way to figure out
problems and present different options to their clients. Using layers is a
great way to iterate: You can move each version of the thing you’re work-
ing on to a different layer, and then turn them on and off to show each in
turn. Just remember to follow the rule about only using groups and com-
ponents on separate layers (mentioned previously), and you’ll be fine.
Putting It All Together
In this chapter, I talk about each of SketchUp’s organizational methods in iso-
lation: discussing how they work, why they’re special, and when to use them.
In fact, you’ll probably end up using a combination of all of them when you’re
working in SketchUp, so I thought it might be helpful to see an example of
everything in action.
Figure 5-14 shows a model of a small house I’m building in SketchUp. I’m
using all of SketchUp’s organizational tools to help me manage my model’s
complexity while I’m working:
 Each floor level is a group. By working with each floor level as a sepa-
rate group, I’m able to use the Outliner to hide whichever one I’m not
working on. This makes it easier to see what I’m doing. I’m including the
house’s only staircase in the first floor group, because that turns out to
be the easiest thing to do.
141
Chapter 5: Keeping Your Model Organized

I’ve decided to include the interior walls on each level of my house in
that level’s group. I don’t think I’ll ever have to hide them, so it wasn’t
worth making them a separate group. For what it’s worth, I think the
same thing probably applies to most buildings, unless you plan to study
different floor plans with different interior wall arrangements.
 The roof and exterior walls are groups inside of another group. I want
to be able to “remove” the roof and the exterior walls separately, so I’ve
made each of them a group. I also want to be able to hide and unhide
them both at the same time, so I made a group called “Shell” that
includes both of them. Using the Outliner, I can selectively show or hide
just the geometry I want. (See Figure 5-15.)
The floor levels, roof, and exterior walls of my house are groups instead
of components because they’re unique — I only have one First Floor, so
it doesn’t need to be a component.
 All the furniture and plumbing fixtures are components. All the com-
ponents I use to furnish my house are ones I either built myself, took
from the Components dialog box, or found in the 3D Warehouse. (See
Chapter 11 to see what I’m referring to.)
But I only have one couch: Why make it a component instead of a group?
By making every piece of furniture in my model a component, I’m able 
to see a list of my furniture in the In Model library of the Components
dialog box. (See Figure 5-16.) I can also save that as a separate compo-
nent library on my computer. The next time I move, I’ll have all my furni-
ture in a single place, ready to drop into a model of my new house.
Figure 5-14:
I’m using 
all of
SketchUp’s

tional tools

142
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

 All my furniture is on a separate layer. Because furniture components
can be a little heavy (they’re taxing on my computer system), and
because I want to be able to see my house without furniture, I created a
new layer (called “Furniture”) and moved all my furniture onto it. Using
the Layers dialog box, I can control the visibility of that layer with a
single click of my mouse.
But why not just create a group from all my furniture components and
use the Outliner to hide and unhide them all, instead of bothering with
layers? Good question. Because it’s easier to change a component’s
layer than it is to add it to an existing group. To add something to a
group, I would need to use the Outliner to drag and drop it in the proper
place; with complex models, this can be a hassle. Changing a compo-
nent’s layer is just a matter of using the Entity Info dialog box to choose
from a list.

H
ere’s something you already know: There’s more to life than modeling
buildings. Even though SketchUp is really good at letting you make
models of built structures, you can use it to build just about anything you 
can think of — all it takes is time, ingenuity, and the ability to take a step 
back and break things down into their basic parts. SketchUp provides some
fantastic tools for creating forms that aren’t in the least bit boxy, but they’re
not as obvious as Push/Pull and Rectangle, so most people never find them.
This chapter is devoted to helping you discover SketchUp’s “rounder” side.
First off, take a hard look at the shape of the things you might want to model. I
want you to think about all the objects in the universe. I’ll wait a couple of min-
utes while you do that. Done so soon? Good. Everything in the world (as I’m
sure you realized) can be categorized as either of the following formal types:
 Symmetrical: Objects that exhibit bilateral symmetry are made of mir-
rored halves. You’re (more or less) bilaterally symmetrical, and so is
your car. Another kind of symmetry is radial symmetry; starfish are good
examples of this, as are umbrellas and apple pies. If you were going to
build a model of something that exhibits some form of symmetry, build-
ing one part and making copies would be a smarter way to do it.
 Asymmetrical: Some things — puddles, oak trees, many houses — aren’t
symmetrical. There’s no real trick to making these things; you just have
to make some coffee, settle in, and get to work.
In this chapter, I present tools, techniques, and other tips for creating forms
that are distinctly unbuilding-like — my hope is that you’ll use them to push
the limits of what you think SketchUp can do.

Modeling Symmetrically: Good 
News for Lazy People
And smart people, I suppose. The fact is, a huge amount of the stuff in the
galaxy exhibits some kind of symmetry. This makes modeling a heck of a lot
easier, because it means you don’t often have to model things in their entirety.
With SketchUp’s Components feature (described at length in Chapter 5), you
can make a piece of something, copy it, flip it over (if necessary), and put it in
position. Better yet, any changes you make to one part are automatically
reflected in the others — that’s what components do.
You can take advantage of both bilateral and radial symmetry with SketchUp
components. To do so, you just assemble those components as follows, depend-
ing on what type of symmetry your object has (also take a look at Figure 6-1):
 Bilateral symmetry: To make a model of something that’s bilaterally sym-
metrical, you just build half, make it into a component, and flip over a copy.
 Radial symmetry: Radially symmetrical objects can be (conceptually,
anyway) cut into identical “wedges” that all radiate from a central axis. You
can use components to model things like car wheels and turrets by build-
ing a single wedge and rotating a bunch of copies around a central point.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

The following is a list of reasons why you should work with components
whenever you’re building a symmetrical object:
 It’s faster. This one’s obvious. Not having to model the same things
twice provides you with more time for playing golf or answering e-mail,
depending on what you prefer to do.
 It’s smarter. Everybody knows that things change, and when they do,
it’s nice not to have to make the same changes more than once. Using
component instances means only ever having to do things once.
 It’s sexy. Modeling something and then watching it repeat in a bunch of
other places are fun to do, and the overall effect impresses the heck out
of a crowd. Somehow, people will think you’re smarter if they see things
appearing “out of nowhere.”
Working smarter by only building half
Bilaterally symmetrical forms are everywhere. Most animals you can name, the
majority of the furniture in your house, your personal helicopter — they can all
be modeled by building half, creating a component, and flipping over a copy.
This section (and the section that follows) talks extensively about the use of
components, a SketchUp feature so useful it figures prominently in no fewer
than three chapters of this book. If you haven’t done so already, take a few
minutes to read through the first part of Chapter 5 — you’ll be glad you did.
Follow these steps to get the general idea of how to start building a bilaterally
symmetrical model in SketchUp (see Figure 6-2):
1. Make a simple box.
You can do this however you want, but I think the easiest way is to draw
a rectangle and push/pull it into 3D.
2. Draw a diagonal edge on the corner of your box.
The point of this step is to mark one side of your box so that when you
flip it over, you don’t get confused about which side is which.
3. Turn your box into a component.
Chapter 5 has all the information on how to do this, but here’s the mini
version:
a. Select everything you want to make into a component.
b. Choose Edit➪Make Component.
c. Name your component if you want; then click the Create button.
147
Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings

4. Make a copy of your new component instance.
The last part of Chapter 2 has information about moving and copying
objects in SketchUp, but here’s a simple version:
a. Choose the Move tool.
b. Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to toggle from Move to Copy mode.
You should see a little plus sign (+) next to your cursor.
c. Click your component instance.
d. Move your copy over beside the original, and click again to drop it.
Make sure that you move in either the red or the green direction; it
makes things easier in the next step.
5. Flip the copy over.
To do this, right-click the copy and choose Flip Along from the context
menu. If you moved your copy in the red direction in the previous step,
choose Flip Along➪Component’s Red. Choose Component’s Green if you
moved in the green direction.
6. Stick the two halves back together.
Using the Move tool (this time without Copy toggled on), pick up your
copy from the corner and move it over, dropping it on the corresponding
corner of the original. Take a look at the last image in Figure 6-2 to see
what I mean. Doing this precisely is important, if you want your model to
look right.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Now you’re set up to start building symmetrically. If you want, you can do a
test to make sure things went smoothly (see Figure 6-3). Follow these steps:
1. With the Select tool, double-click one of the halves of your model to
edit it.
2. Draw a circle on the top surface and push/pull it into a cylinder.
If the same thing happens on the other side, you’re good to go. If the same
thing doesn’t happen on the other side, it’s possible that:
 You’re not really editing one of your component instances. If you
aren’t, you’re drawing on top of your component instead of in it. You’ll
know you’re in Component Edit mode if the rest of your model looks
grayed out.
 You never made a component in the first place. If your halves don’t
have blue boxes around them when you select them, they’re not compo-
nent instances. Start a new file and try again, paying particular attention
to Step 3 in the preceding steps.
Whatever you do on this
side should happen on the
other side, too

Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings

The coolest things since 
radially sliced bread
You can model objects that exhibit radial symmetry just as easily as those
with bilateral symmetry; you just start out slightly differently. The only thing
you have to decide before you start is how many “wedges” — how many
identical parts — your object is made of.
To set yourself up to model something with radial symmetry, you start by
modeling one wedge, then you make it into a component, and then you rotate
copies around the center. Follow these steps to get the hang of it yourself:
1. Draw a polygon with as many sides as the number of segments you
need for the object you’re modeling.
150
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Making two halves look like one whole
Looking carefully at the little boat in the figure that
follows, notice how the edges in the middle
clearly show that it’s made out of two halves? If I
were to erase those edges, my whole model
would disappear, because those edges are defin-
ing faces, and without edges, faces can’t exist.
Instead of erasing those unwanted edges, I can
hide them by using the Eraser while pressing
Shift. See the second and third images of the
boat? When I hold down Shift as I drag over the
edges I want to hide with the Eraser, they dis-
appear. Two things are important to know about
hidden edges:
 Hidden edges aren’t gone forever. Actually,
this applies to any hidden geometry in your
model. To see what’s hidden, choose View➪
Hidden Geometry. To hide it again, just
choose the same thing.
 To edit hidden edges, you have to make them
visible. If you need to make changes to your
model that involves edges you’ve already
hidden, you can either view your hidden
geometry (see the previous point) or unhide
them altogether. Just show your hidden
geometry, select the edges you want to
unhide, and choose Edit➪Unhide➪Selected.
Distracting edges
Use Eraser to hide

Here’s the easiest way to draw a polygon in SketchUp, as shown in
Figure 6-4:
a. Choose Tools➪Polygon to select the Polygon tool.
b. Click once to establish the center (I like to do this on the axis
origin), move your cursor, and then click again to establish the
radius. Don’t worry about being accurate right now.
c. Before you do anything else, type in the number of sides you’d like
your polygon to have and press Enter.
2. Draw edges from the center of your polygon to two adjacent vertices
(endpoints) on the perimeter, creating a wedge.
To find the center of a polygon (or a circle), hover your cursor over the
outline for a couple of seconds and move the cursor toward the middle;
a center inference point should appear.
3. Erase the rest of your polygon, leaving only the wedge.
4. Turn your wedge into a component.
Check out Step 3 in the previous section for instructions on how to do
this, or read the first part of Chapter 5.
5. Make copies of your wedge component instance with the Rotate tool
(see Figure 6-5).
Just like with the Move tool, you can use the Rotate tool to make copies.
You can even make an array (more than one copy at a time). Here’s how
to do it:
a. Select your wedge’s edges (sorry — I just wanted to say that).
Select the face, too.
b. Choose Tools➪Rotate to select the Rotate tool.

c. Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to tell SketchUp you want to make a
copy; a + should appear next to your cursor.
d. Click the pointy end of your wedge to set your center of rotation.
e. Click one of the opposite corners of your wedge to set your rota-
tion start point.
f. Click the other corner to make a rotated copy of your wedge.
g. Before you do anything else, type in the number of additional
wedges you want, followed by the letter x, and then press Enter.
6. Test your setup, if you want.
Follow the steps at the end of the previous section in this chapter to test
things out.
Take a look at the sidebar “Making two halves look like one whole,” earlier in
this chapter, to find out about hiding the edges in your component instances.
Doing so can make your finished model look a whole lot better.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Extruding with Purpose: Follow Me
Follow Me is probably the best example of a powerful SketchUp tool with
kind of an underwhelming name. The problem that faced the software design-
ers when they were trying to figure out what to call their new baby was this:
It does what other 3D modeling programs dedicate two or three other tools
to doing. They chose an unconventional name because it’s a wholly uncon-
ventional tool.
In the following sections, I talk about how to use Follow Me to create a number
of different types of shapes; examples of these are shown in Figure 6-6 and are
as follows:
 Bottles, spindles, and spheres: These are all examples of lathed forms.
These can be created by spinning a 2D profile (shape) around a central
axis to create a 3D model.

Modeling with the Scale tool
In this book, I don’t spend a lot of time on the
Scale tool because I don’t think it’s very compli-
cated to figure out. I do, however, want to point
out something that a lot of new SketchUp users
don’t realize: using the Scale tool to alter the
shape of your model (instead of just the size) is
an incredibly powerful way to work. The follow-
ing figure shows what I’m getting at. The basic
idea is to reshape your geometry by only select-
ing certain faces and edges, and then scaling
those. You can see a good example of how this
works in the Color Insert of this book, where I
create the tapered bottom of a rowboat by scal-
ing its bottom surface. Here are some more
things you should know about the Scale tool:
 Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to scale about
the center.
 Use the corner grips (the little green cubes)
to scale proportionally.
 Use the side grips to squeeze or stretch
your selection.

 Pipes, gutters, and moldings: If you look closely, all three of these
things are basically created by extruding a 2D face along a 3D path; the
result is a complex 3D form.
 Chamfers, fillets, and dados: Without explaining what all of these things
are (I get to that later in this chapter), know this: You can use Follow Me
to cut away profiles, too.
Using Follow Me
At its core, Follow Me lets you create forms that are extrusions. It’s a little bit
like Push/Pull, except that it doesn’t just work in one direction. You tell
Follow Me to follow a path, and it extrudes a face all along that path. This
means that you need three things to use Follow Me:
 A path: In SketchUp, you can use any edge, or series of edges, as a path. All
you have to do is make sure that they’re drawn before you use Follow Me.
 A face: Just like with Push/Pull, Follow Me needs a face to extrude. You
can use any face in your model, but it needs to be created before you
start using Follow Me.
 Undo: Imagining what a 2D face will look like as a 3D shape isn’t easy —
it usually takes a couple of tries to get a Follow Me operation right.
That’s what Undo is for, after all.
Figure 6-6:
Follow Me
lets you

kinds of
different
shapes.
154
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Follow these steps to use Follow Me; Figure 6-7 shows a basic example of how
it works:
1. Draw a face to use as an extrusion profile.
In this example, I’m creating a pipe, so my extrusion profile is a circular
face.
2. Draw an edge (or edges) to use as an extrusion path.
Although the edge (or edges) is touching the face in this case, it doesn’t
have to for Follow Me to work.
3. Select the complete extrusion path you want to use.
Check out the section on making selections in Chapter 2 for pointers on
using the Select tool to best advantage.
4. Activate the Follow Me tool.
To do this, choose Tools➪Follow Me.
5. Click the face you want to extrude once.
Magic! Your face (extrusion profile) is extruded along the path you
chose in Step 3, creating a 3D form (in this case, a section of pipe).
If you want to use Follow Me all the way around the perimeter of a face, you
don’t need to spend time selecting all the individual edges. Just select the
face and then use Follow Me; the tool automatically runs all the way around
any face you have selected.
You can use Follow Me another way, too: Instead of preselecting a path (as 
in Step 3 of the preceding list), you can click any face with Follow Me and
attempt to drag it along edges in your model. While this works on simple
things, I find that preselecting a path works a lot better — it’s really the only
option for using Follow Me in a predictable way.
Select the whole path

Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings

Making lathed forms like 
spheres and bottles
And nuclear power plant chimneys. A surprising number of things can be
modeled by using Follow Me to perform a lathe operation. A lathe is a tool that
carpenters (and machinists) use to spin a block of raw material while they
carve into it — that’s how baseball bats are made (the good ones, anyway).
A simple example of a lathed object is a sphere. Here’s how you might make
one with Follow Me:
1. Draw a circle on the ground.
2. Rotate a copy of your circle up by 90 degrees, as shown in Figure 6-8:
If you’re wondering how to do this, follow these steps:
a. Select the face of your circle with the Select tool.
b. Choose Tools➪Rotate to activate the Rotate tool.
c. Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to tell SketchUp you want to make a
copy.
d. Click a green endpoint inference along the edge of your circle and
hold down your mouse button to drag. Don’t let go just yet.
e. Still dragging, move your cursor over to the endpoint on the exact
opposite side of your circle; then release your mouse button. Now
your axis of rotation is a line right through the center of your circle.
f. Click anywhere on the edge of your circle, and then move your
mouse over a little bit.
g. Type in 90 and press Enter.
You can read all about the Rotate tool in the sidebar “Wrapping your
head around the Rotate tool,” later in this chapter.
3. Make sure that one of your circles is selected.

of a circle.

4. With the Follow Me tool, click the circle that’s not selected once (see
Figure 6-9).
Now you have a sphere. The Follow Me tool “lathed” your circular face
around the path you selected — the other circle.
If you really need a sphere, the easiest way to get one is in the Components
dialog box. The Shapes library that comes installed with SketchUp has a
selection of spheres (and cones and other things) you can choose from.
If you want to make your curved surfaces look smooth (hiding the edges
between them), check out the sidebar “Smoothing out those unsightly
edges,” later in this chapter.
Under normal circumstances, you only have to model half a profile to use
Follow Me to make it three-dimensional. Figure 6-10 shows a few different
examples of 3D objects.

Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings

Creating extruded shapes like 
gutters and handrails
A lot of the time, you’ll want to use Follow Me to create geometry (edges 
and faces) that’s attached to another part of your model. An example of this
might be modeling a gutter that runs all the way around the roof of your
house. In this case, you’re likely to already have the path along which you
want to extrude a profile (the edge of the roof).
When you’re using Follow Me to extrude a face along a path that consists of
edges that already exist as part of your model, there are two things you
should always do:
 Before using Follow Me, make the rest of your model a separate group.
Take my word for it — Follow Me can sometimes mess things up, so you
want to be able to keep the geometry it creates separate, just in case.
 Make a copy of your extrusion path outside your group. There’s a con-
sequence to working with Follow Me on top of a group: The edge (or
edges) you want to use as an extrusion path will no longer be available,
because you can’t use Follow Me with a path that’s in a separate group
or component.
What to do? You need to make a copy of the path outside the group, and
then use the copy to do the Follow Me operation. Here’s the best way to
make a copy of the path:
1. With the Select tool, double-click your group to edit it.
2. Select the path you want to use for Follow Me.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
4. Exit (stop editing) your group by clicking somewhere else in your
modeling window.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste in Place. Now you have a copy of the path you
want to use, and it’s outside your group.
Take a look at Chapter 17. You’ll find a Ruby script (don’t worry — I explain
what that means) called “Weld” that’s super-useful for creating extrusion
paths for Follow Me.
When you’re using an existing edge (or series of edges) as an extrusion path,
the hard part is getting your profile in the right place. You have a choice of
two ways to proceed; which one you use depends on what you need to model:
158
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

 Draw the profile in place. Do this only if the extrusion path is parallel to
one of the colored drawing axes.
 Draw the profile on the ground and then move it into position. If your
extrusion path doesn’t start out parallel to a colored drawing axis, you
should probably draw your profile somewhere else and move it into
place later.
159
Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
Why your computer is so slow
When you use Follow Me with an extrusion pro-
file that’s a circle or an arc, you’re creating a
piece of 3D geometry that’s very big. By big, I
mean that it has lots of faces, and faces are
what make your computer slow down. Without
going into detail about how SketchUp works (I
don’t really know that anyway), keep this in
mind: The more faces you have in your model,
the worse your computer’s performance will be.
At a certain point, you’ll stop being able to orbit,
your scenes (which I talk about in Chapter 10)
will stutter, and you’ll be tempted to do some-
thing terrible to someone you don’t know.
The first pipe in the figure that follows has been
extruded using Follow Me. It was made with a
24-sided circle as an extrusion profile, and it has
338 faces. Hidden Geometry is turned on (in the
View menu) so that you can see how many
faces you have.
The second pipe uses a 10-sided circle as an
extrusion profile. As a result, it only has 116
faces. What an improvement!
The third pipe also uses a 10-sided circle as an
extrusion profile, but the arc in its extrusion path
is made up of only 4 segments, instead of the
usual 12. It has a total of 52 faces. Even better.
The second image in the figure shows all three
pipes with Hidden Geometry turned off. Is the
difference in detail worth the exponential
increase in the number of faces? Most of the
time, the answer is no.
To change the number of sides in a circle or an
arc, just before or just after you create it, follow
these steps:
1. Type in the number of sides you’d like to have.
2. Type an s to tell SketchUp that you mean
“sides.”
3. Press Enter.
338 faces
116 faces
52 faces

Drawing your profile in place
Consider that I have a model of a house. I want to use Follow Me to add a
gutter that goes all the way around the perimeter of the roof. I decide to draw
the profile in place (right on the roof itself) because the edges of the roof are
drawn parallel to the colored drawing axes. This means that I’ll have an
easier time using the Line tool to draw “in midair.”
The trick to drawing an extrusion profile that isn’t on the ground is to start
by drawing a rectangular face. You then draw the profile on the face and
erase the rest of the rectangle. Figure 6-11 shows how you would draw the
profile of a gutter directly on the corner of a roof; the steps that follow
explain the same things in words:
1. Zoom in on what you’re doing.
I can’t tell you how many people try to work without filling their model-
ing windows with the subject at hand. Not doing so is like trying to do a
crossword puzzle while looking the wrong way through a pair of binocu-
lars. Get close — SketchUp models don’t bite!
2. Using the Line tool, draw a rectangle whose face is perpendicular to
the edge you want to use for Follow Me.
This involves paying careful attention to SketchUp’s inference engine;
watch the colors to make sure that you’re drawing in the right direction.
3. Use the Line tool (and SketchUp’s other drawing tools) to draw your
profile directly on the rectangle you just drew.
The important thing here is to make sure that your extrusion profile is 
a single face; if it’s not, Follow Me won’t work the way you want it to.
4. Erase the rest of your rectangle, leaving only the profile.
The awful thing about handrails is that they’re almost always at funny angles,
not parallel to a colored axis. When it’s not convenient to draw your extru-
sion profile in place, it’s best to draw it on the ground and move it into posi-
tion afterwards.
Drawing your profile somewhere else
Here’s the trick: Draw a “tail” — a short edge — perpendicular to your extru-
sion profile. You can use this tail to help you line up your profile with the edge
you want to use as an extrusion path for Follow Me. The following steps, and
Figure 6-12, describe how you would draw and position a profile for a handrail:
1. Draw your extrusion profile flat on the ground.
2. Draw a short edge perpendicular to the face you just drew.
This “tail” should come from the point where you want your profile to
attach to the extrusion path.
160
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

3. Make your profile and its tail into a group.
This makes it easier to move and rotate around all at once. See Chapter 5
for information on creating and using groups, if you need it.
4. Using the Move tool, place your profile at the end of the extrusion path.
To make sure that you position it accurately, pick it up by clicking the
point where the tail meets the face, and drop it by clicking the end of the
extrusion path.

Here’s where you need to use a bit of skill. See the nearby sidebar,
“Wrapping your head around the Rotate tool,” for guidance. The 
Rotate tool is easy to use when you get the hang of it.
6. Explode the group you created in Step 3, and delete your tail.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Subtracting from a model with Follow Me
What if you want to model a bar of soap? Or a sofa cushion? Or anything that
doesn’t have a sharp edge? The best way to round off edges in SketchUp is
to use Follow Me. In addition to using it to add to your model, you can also
subtract from your model.
Here’s how it works: If you draw an extrusion profile on the end face of a
longish form, you can use Follow Me to “remove” a strip of material along
whatever path you specify. Figure 6-13 demonstrates the concept on the top
of a box.
If the extrusion path you want to use for a Follow Me operation consists of
the entire perimeter of a face (as is the case in Figure 6-13), you can save time
by just selecting the face instead of all the edges that define it.

Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings

But what if you want to create a corner that’s rounded in both directions, 
as so many corners are? That one’s a little trickier to do in SketchUp, but
because it’s such a common problem, I thought I’d devote a few hundred
words to explaining how to do it. The basic technique involves using Follow
Me on a corner you’ve already rounded with the Push/Pull tool. After you
have a corner that’s filleted with an arc of the correct radius, you can use
copies (or component instances, if you’re clever) of that corner several
times, wherever you need them. It’s not what I’d call an elegant solution, 
but it’s possible, and it works when you need it to.
164
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Wrapping your head around the Rotate tool
In the last version of SketchUp, the software’s
designers introduced a feature that pretty much
everybody realizes is great: You can establish
your axis of rotation (the invisible line around
which you’re rotating) while you’re using the
Rotate tool. This makes it about a million times
easier to rotate things around, and those of us
who use SketchUp a lot danced little jigs (albeit
awkwardly) when we heard the news.
By default, the Rotate tool “sticks” itself to what-
ever plane you happen to be hovering over —
that’s why it changes color as you move its big,
round cursor all over your screen. When it’s blue,
its axis of rotation is the blue axis; the same goes
for red and green. When it’s black, its axis of rota-
tion doesn’t line up with any of the colored draw-
ing axes.
If you want to show SketchUp the axis of rota-
tion you want to use while you’re using the
Rotate tool, you can. In this case, using Rotate
goes from being a three-step operation to a five-
step one (check out the following figure for a
visual explanation):
1. Click once to establish your center of rota-
tion, but don’t let go — keep your finger on
your mouse button.
2. Drag your cursor around (still holding the
mouse button down) until your axis of rota-
tion is where you want it. As you drag, you’ll
notice your Rotate cursor changing orien-
tation; the line from the center of the cursor
to your mouse is the axis of rotation.
3. Release your mouse button to set your axis
of rotation.
4. Click (but don’t drag) the point at which you
want to “pick up” whatever you’re rotating.
5. Click again to drop the thing you’re rotating
where you want it.
Whew! It takes practice, but it’s worth it. The
efficiency you gain by being able to rotate
things in free space is huge. Two more things
about Rotate, while I’m on the subject:
 Type in a rotate angle during or after you
rotate something. Check out the section
about modeling with accuracy in Chapter 2
for more information on using the VCB
(Value Control Box) to be precise while
you’re modeling.
 Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to make a
copy. This works just like it does in the
Move tool, which you can also read about
in Chapter 2.

Figure 6-14 gives a step-by-step, visual account of the process, while I explain
it in words, as follows:
1. Draw a box.
It doesn’t really matter how big, as long as it’s big enough for the fillet
you want to apply.

2. With the Arc tool, draw an arc on the corner of the box.
When you’re drawing an arc on a corner, keep an eye out for the infer-
ences that help you draw properly:
a. After clicking to place one endpoint of your arc, as you cut across
the corner, the point at which your line turns magenta is where
your endpoints are equidistant (the same distance) from the corner
across which you’re cutting.
b. After clicking to place your second endpoint, you will see a point at
which the arc you’re drawing turns magenta — this means your arc

Push/Pull away the corner

is tangent to (continuous with) both edges it’s connected to. You
want this to be the case, so you should click when you see magenta.
I strongly recommend that you reduce the number of sides on your arc
before you start filleting away. See the sidebar “Why your computer is so
slow,” earlier in this chapter, to find out why.
3. Push/pull the new face down to round off the corner.
4. Draw another, identical arc on one of the corners directly adjacent to
the corner you just rounded.
This is where you’ll have to refer to Figure 6-14. Pictures are better than
words when it comes to explaining things like which corners are adja-
cent to which.
5. Select the edges shown in Figure 6-14.
6. Activate the Follow Me tool.
7. Click the arc corner face to extrude it along the path you selected in
Step 4.
8. Hide or smooth out any edges that need hiding or smoothing.
For information about hiding edges, see the sidebar “Making two halves
look like one whole,” earlier in this chapter. Check out the nearby sidebar,
“Smoothing out those unsightly edges,” for the whole scoop on how to
smooth edges.
After you have a fully rounded corner, you can use a bunch of them to make
anything you want; it just takes a little planning. Figure 6-15 shows a simple
bar of soap I created out of eight rounded corners, copied and flipped
accordingly. The text (in case you’re wondering) was created with SketchUp’s
3D Text tool, which you can find on the Tools menu.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Smoothing out those unsightly edges
If you’re wondering how to get rid of all the ugly
lines you end up with when you use Follow Me,
the answer is pretty simple: You can smooth
edges, just like you can hide them. (See the side-
bar “Making two halves look like one whole,”
earlier in this chapter, for more information
about hiding edges.) The difference between
hiding and smoothing is illustrated by the images
of the cylinders in the figure that follows:
 When you hide an edge between two
faces, SketchUp still treats those faces as
though your edge is still there — it just
doesn’t show the edge. Materials you’ve
applied to each face stay separate, and
each face is “lit” separately by SketchUp’s
sun. The latter fact is the reason why simply
hiding the edges between faces that are
supposed to represent a smooth curve
doesn’t make things look smooth — you still
end up with a faceted look.
 When you smooth an edge between two
faces, you’re telling SketchUp to treat them
as a single face — with a single material
and smooth-looking shading. The difference
is pretty huge, as you can see in the second
cylinder.
You can smooth edges in two different ways:
 Use the Eraser. To smooth edges with the
Eraser tool, hold down Ctrl (Option on the
Mac) while you click or drag over the edges
you want to smooth.
 Use the Soften Edges dialog box. Located
on the Window menu, this dialog box lets
you smooth a bunch of selected edges all at
once, according to what angle their adja-
cent faces are at. It’s a little complicated at
first, but here’s what you need to know to
get started: Select the edges you want to
smooth, and then move the slider to the
right until things look the way you want
them to.
To unsmooth edges, you need to make them vis-
ible first; turn on Hidden Geometry to do just
that. Then, do the following:
1. Select the edges you want to unsmooth.
2. In the Soften Edges dialog box, move the
slider all the way to the left.

 Painting faces in your model with photographs
 Tweaking your textured faces with the Texture Tweaker
 Modeling on top of photo-textured faces
 Building a model from scratch with Photo Match
 Using Photo Match to match your model to a photograph
T
hese days, it’s next to impossible to meet someone who doesn’t take pic-
tures. Aside from the millions of digital cameras out there, lots of mobile
phones have cameras in them, too. I expect that by the time I’m working on
the next edition of this book, I’ll be writing about the digital cameras we all
have in our sunglasses — just wink to take a snapshot and then blink three
times to e-mail it to your grandma.
You can use all these photos you’re taking in SketchUp in a couple of differ-
ent ways:
 If you have a model you’d like to “paint” with photographs, you can
do that in SketchUp. You can apply photos to faces and then use the
information in the pictures to help you model; building windows is a lot
easier when they’re painted right on the wall. That’s what I talk about in
the first part of this chapter.
 If you want to use a photo to help you model something from scratch,
you can do that in SketchUp, too. New in version 6, a feature called
Photo Match makes it (relatively) simple to bring in a picture, set things
up so that your modeling window view matches the perspective in the
photo, and then build what you see by “tracing” with SketchUp’s model-
ing tools. Sound like fun? It is — and that’s why I devote the whole
second half of this chapter to it.
Neither of these techniques is what I’d call super-easy — that’s why I put this
chapter at the end of the modeling part of this book. If you haven’t at least
skimmed through Chapter 4, I recommend doing so; you’ll spend less time
scratching your head and thinking evil thoughts about me.

Painting Faces with Photos
Funny thing about the tool I’m about to explain: Nobody really seems to know
what it’s called. During its development, the SketchUp team referred to it as
the Texture Tweaker, mostly because both words start with the same letter,
and they thought that was catchy. For some reason, it’s called the Position
Texture tool in SketchUp’s Help documentation, even though it’s not really a
tool — at least not in the traditional sense. There’s no button for the Texture
Tweaker/Position Texture tool; you can only get to it by choosing a command
from a menu. All the same, it’s one of SketchUp’s coolest — and most useful —
“hidden” features.
Here are some of the things you can do with the Texture Tweaker (I refer to it
by its original name; I’m a sucker for alliteration):
 Stick artwork to 3D prototypes or packaging designs.
 Create photo-realistic buildings that you can upload (send) to Google
Earth (see Chapter 11 for more detail on this).
 Figure out where things like windows, doors, signs, and ornamentation
belong on your building models.
Adding photos to faces
Technically, painting surfaces with pictures using 3D software is mapping, as
in “I mapped a photo of your face to the underside of the pile-driver model
I’m building.” Different software programs have different methods for map-
ping pictures to faces, and luckily, SketchUp’s very straightforward.
Mapping photos of building facades to your building models with the Texture
Tweaker/Position Texture tool has a number of benefits:
 Using photographs can make your models look more realistic.
 Taking advantage of details that are visible in a photograph (instead of
modeling them) results in a smaller, easier-to-manage model.
 You can use a photograph to help you locate building elements, like
doors, windows, and signs, if you plan to model them.
 Models to which you apply photo textures can be submitted to the 3D
Warehouse, where they might be used on Google Earth’s default
Buildings layer (Chapter 11 has all the details on this).
170
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

SketchUp uses lots of different terms to refer to the stuff you can paint faces
with; generically, they’re all called materials. Materials can be colors or tex-
tures; textures are image-based, and colors are a single, solid hue. When you
import an image to map it to a face, it becomes a texture — just like any of
the other textures in your Materials dialog box. Read more about using mate-
rials in SketchUp at the end of Chapter 2.
Follow these steps to map an image to a face (and find additional help on this
book’s companion Web site; see the Introduction for details):
Before you begin, I should probably mention that you need to have at least
one face in your model before you go through these steps; if you don’t, you
won’t have anything to map your texture to.
1. Choose File➪Import.
The Open dialog box opens.
2. Select the image file you want to use as a texture.
You can use JPEGs, TIFFs, PNGs, and PDFs as textures in SketchUp; all of
these are common image-file formats.
3. Select the Use as Texture option (see Figure 7-1).
4. Click the Open button.
This closes the Open dialog box, switches your active tool to Paint
Bucket, and “loads” your cursor with the image you chose to import.
5. Click once in the lower-left corner of the face you want to “paint” 
(see Figure 7-2).
Where you click tells SketchUp where to position the lower-left corner of
the image you’re using as a texture. You can click anywhere on the face
you’re trying to paint, but I recommend the lower-left corner — it keeps
things simple.
Figure 7-1:
Make sure
to pick Use
as texture.
171
Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

6. Click somewhere else on the face you’re painting to locate the upper-
right corner of the image texture (see Figure 7-2).
Time for a little bit of theory: Image textures in SketchUp are made up of
tiles. To make a large area of texture (like a brick wall), SketchUp uses a
bunch of tiles right next to each other. In the case of a brick wall, it may
look like there are thousands of bricks, but it’s really just the same tile of
about 50 bricks repeated over and over again.
Because SketchUp treats imported image textures just like any other tex-
ture, what you’re really doing when you click to locate the upper-right
corner of your image is this: You’re telling SketchUp how big to make the
tile for your new photo texture. Don’t worry too much about getting it
right the first time, though — you can always tweak things later on
(hence the name Texture Tweaker).
Unless the proportions of your image perfectly match the face onto which 
it was mapped, you should see your image repeating. Don’t worry — that’s
normal. SketchUp automatically tiles your image to fill the whole face. If you
want to edit your new texture so that it doesn’t look tiled (and you probably
do), keep reading. You can scale, rotate, skew, or even stretch your texture to
make it look however you want.

corner of your image...

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Editing your textures
After you’ve successfully mapped an image to a face, you’re probably going
to want to change it somehow: make it bigger, flip it over, rotate it around —
you get the idea. This is where the Texture Tweaker/Position Texture tool
comes in.
The Position Texture tool is actually more of a mode; I call it Texture Edit
mode. Within this mode, you can be in either of two submodes: Their names
are less important than what they do, so that’s how I describe them:
 Move/Scale/Rotate/Shear/Distort Texture mode: You use this mode to
move, scale, rotate, shear, or distort your texture (surprised?); it’s tech-
nical name is Fixed Pin mode — you’ll see why in a little bit.
 Stretch Texture mode: Stretch Texture mode lets you edit your texture
by stretching it to fit the face it’s painted on. If you want to map a photo-
graph of a building façade to your model, this is the mode you want to
use. In SketchUp’s Help documentation, Stretch Texture mode is called
Free Pin mode, just in case you’re interested.
You can only edit textures on flat faces; the Texture Tweaker doesn’t work on
curved faces. To find out more about working with textures and curved faces,
see the section, “The tricky case: Mapping photo textures to curved surfaces,”
later in this chapter.
Moving, scaling, rotating, shearing, and distorting your texture
The title of this section should pretty much say it all — doing the aforemen-
tioned things to your texture involves the Texture Tweaker, which is a little
bit hidden, unfortunately.
Follow these steps to move, scale, rotate, or skew your texture:
1. With the Select tool, click the face with the texture you want to edit.
2. Choose Edit➪Face➪Texture➪Position.
This enables (deep breath) Move/Scale/Rotate/Shear/Distort Texture
mode. You should be able to see a transparent version of your image,
along with four pins, each a different color. Have a look at Color Plate 9
to see what I’m talking about. If all your pins are yellow, you’re in Stretch
Texture mode. Right-click your textured face and make sure there’s a
check mark next to Fixed Pins to switch into the correct mode.
A quicker way to get to Edit mode is to right-click the textured face and
then choose Texture➪Position from the context menu.
173
Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

3. Edit your texture.
At this point, the things you can do to edit your texture are located in
two different places.
Right-clicking your texture opens a context menu with the following
options:
• Done: Tells SketchUp you’re finished editing your texture.
• Reset: Undoes all the changes you’ve made to your texture, and
makes things look like they did before you started messing around.
• Flip: Flips your texture left to right or up and down, depending on
which suboption you choose.
• Rotate: Rotates your texture 90, 180, or 270 degrees, depending on
which suboption you choose.
• Fixed Pins: When this option is selected, you’re in Move/Scale/
Rotate/Shear/Distort Texture mode (Fixed Pin mode). Deselecting
it switches you over to Stretch Texture mode, which I talk about in
the section “Stretching a photo over a face,” later in this chapter.
• Undo/Redo: Goes back or forward a step in your working process.
Dragging each of the colored pins has a different effect (see Figure 7-3):
• Scale/Shear (Blue) pin: Scales and shears your texture while you
drag it. Shearing keeps the top and bottom edges parallel while
making the image “lean” to the left or right.
• Distort (Yellow) pin: Distorts your texture while you drag it; in this
case, the distortion looks like kind of a perspective effect.
• Scale/Rotate (Green) pin: Scales and rotates your texture while
you drag it.
• Move (Red) pin: Moves your texture around while you drag it. Of
all four colored pins, I think this one’s the most useful. I use it all
the time to precisely reposition brick, shingle, and other building
material textures in my model.
Instead of just dragging around the colored pins, try single-clicking one
of them to pick it up; this lets you place it wherever you want (just click
again to drop it). This comes in especially handy when you’re using the
Move and Rotate pins.
4. Click anywhere outside your texture in your modeling window to exit
Edit mode.
You can also right-click and choose Done from the context menu, or
press Enter.

Stretching a photo over a face
The basic metaphor here is one of a photograph printed on a piece of really
stretchy fabric. You stretch the fabric until the photo looks the way you want
and then you hold it in place with pins.
Follow these steps to stretch your texture using the Texture Tweaker’s
Stretch Texture mode:
1. With the Select tool, click the face with the texture you want to edit.
2. Choose Edit➪Face➪Texture➪Position.
A quicker way to get to Edit mode is to right-click the textured face and
choose Texture➪Position from the context menu.
3. Right-click your texture and deselect the Fixed Pins option (make sure
that no check mark is next to it).
Deselecting Fixed Pins switches you to Stretch Texture mode (or Free
Pin mode, if you’re reading SketchUp’s online Help). Instead of four dif-
ferently colored pins with little symbols next to them, you should see
four, identical yellow pins — Figure 7-4 shows you what to expect.

Green (Rotate) pin
Yellow (Distort) pin
Red (Move) pin

4. Click a pin to pick it up.
Your cursor should clench up into a fist, and the pin should follow it as
you move your mouse around.
Press Esc to drop the pin you’re carrying without moving it; pressing Esc
cancels any operation in SketchUp.
5. Place the pin at the corner of the building in your photograph by
clicking once.
If the pin you’re “carrying” is the upper-left one, drop it on the upper-left
corner of the building in your photograph, as shown in Figure 7-5.
6. Click and drag the pin you just moved to the corresponding corner of
the face you’re working on.
If the pin you just moved is the upper-left one, drag it over to the upper-
left corner of the face whose texture you’re “tweaking.” Check out 
Figure 7-6 to see this in action.
7. Repeat Steps 4–6 for each of the three remaining pins (see Figure 7-7).
If you need to, feel free to orbit, zoom, and pan around your model to get
the best view of what you’re doing; just use the scroll wheel on your
mouse to navigate without switching tools.
A good way to work is to pick up and drop each yellow pin in the general
vicinity of the precise spot you want to place it. Then zoom in and use
your better point of view to do a more accurate job.
8. Press Enter to exit Texture Edit mode.

Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

If you don’t like what you see, just go back and edit the texture again; there’s
no limit to the number of times you can muck around.
Scaling your model until the photo looks right
When you’re happy with the way your texture is stretched to fit the face, one
of two things will be true:
 The proportions are correct. By this, I mean that the photo doesn’t look
stretched or squashed. This will only be the case if the face to which
you applied the photo texture was already exactly the right size.
 The proportions aren’t correct. If the photo texture you just “tweaked”
looks stretched or squashed, the face it’s on is the wrong size. No 
worries — you just need to stretch the whole face until the texture 
looks right. Better yet, if you know how big the face is supposed to 
be (in real life), you can stretch it until it’s correct.
Follow these steps to stretch a face until the texture looks right:
1. Use the Tape Measure tool to create guides that you can use to accu-
rately stretch your face.
Figure 7-7:
Repeat
Steps 4–6
for each of
the other
three yellow
pins.
178
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

In this case, I know the building I’m modeling is supposed to be 50 feet
wide. I talk about using the Tape Measure tool and guides in Chapter 2,
just in case you need a refresher.
2. Select the face you want to stretch.
If your model is at a fairly early stage, just select the whole kit and
caboodle. Triple-click the face with the Select tool to select it and every-
thing attached to it. Figure 7-8 shows my whole model selected, because
I’m just starting out.
3. Choose Tools➪Scale to activate the Scale tool.
When the Scale tool’s active, everything that’s selected in your model
should be surrounded by SketchUp’s Scale Box — its 27 little green
cubes (they’re called grips) and thick, yellow lines are hard to miss.
4. Scale your selection to be the right size (see Figure 7-9).
Use the Scale tool by clicking on the grips and moving your cursor to
stretch whatever’s selected (including your texture). Click again to stop
scaling.
To scale something precisely using a guide, click a scale grip to grab it and
then hover over the relevant guide to tell SketchUp that’s where you want to
scale to. Click again to finish the scale operation.

Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

Modeling on top of photo textures
After you place a photo texture on the right face and in the right place on
that face (I’m turning into Dr. Seuss), I wouldn’t blame you a bit for wanting 
to use the information in your photograph to help you add geometry to your
model. It’s a great way to be more or less accurate without having to measure
much, and the combination of photo textures and a few simple push/pull
operations can be very convincing.
The thing you have to know
Modeling with photo-textured faces isn’t hard, but you have to know one 
critical step before you can do it: You have to make sure that your texture 
is projected.
Figure 7-10 shows what happens when you try to push/pull an opening in a
photo-textured face: On the left, when the texture isn’t projected, the inside
faces are painted with random parts of the texture, making your model look
like a sticker-laden eye puzzle. On the right, when it is projected, note how
the “inside” faces that are produced by the push/pull operation are a plain,
easy-to-discern gray. I call this painting with “stretched” pixels, and the result
is typically more appropriate for what you’re doing.
It’s a good idea to make sure that your face’s texture is projected before you
start drawing on top of it. Happily, telling SketchUp to make a photo texture
projected is just a matter of flipping a switch. Right-click the face with the
photo texture and choose Texture➪Projected from the context menu. If you
see a check mark next to Projected, your texture is already projected; don’t
choose anything.

Modeling with projected textures: A basic workflow
Follow these steps to get the hang of working with projected textures (see
Figure 7-11):
1. Make a basic rectangular box.
2. Apply a photo texture to one of the side faces.
Check out the section, “Adding photos to faces,” earlier in this chapter.
3. Right-click the textured face and choose Texture➪Projected from the
context menu.
Make sure that Projected has a check mark next to it.
4. Draw a rectangle on the textured face and push/pull it inward.
Notice the “stretched pixels” effect?
5. Add other angles or features to your model, if you like.
In Figure 7-11, I create an angled face.
6. Switch to the Paint Bucket tool.
7. Hold down Alt (Ô on a Mac) and click somewhere on the textured
face to sample the texture. (Your cursor should look like an eyedrop-
per when you do this.)
This “loads” your Paint Bucket with the projected texture.
8. Release the Alt (Ô) key to switch back to the Paint Bucket cursor, and
click the angled face once to paint it with the projected texture.
You should see the “stretched pixels” effect here, too.

Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

The tricky case: Mapping photo textures to curved surfaces
This is always one of the first things folks ask about, and it always makes me
wince a little. The thing is, mapping projected textures to curved surfaces is
complicated, and in four years of SketchUping, I can count the number of
times I’ve needed to do it on one finger. Nevertheless, you can do it, with a
little effort.
The key is to line up a flat surface with the curved surface to which you want
to apply the photo texture. You then “paint” the flat surface with the texture,
make it projected, sample it, and finally, paint the curved surface with the
projected, sampled texture. Whew.
Follow these steps to get the basic idea (see Figure 7-12):
1. Create a curved surface.
In this case, I draw a couple of arcs on the top face of a rectangular block
and then use Push/Pull to create a curved surface by “pushing” one of
the top faces down to make it disappear.
2. Create a flat surface that lines up with your curved surface.
I use the Line tool and SketchUp’s inferencing system to draw a flat face
that lines up with (and is the same size as) my curved surface.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

3. Apply a photo texture to your flat surface and make sure that it’s 
positioned correctly.
You can refer to the earlier parts of this chapter for detailed instructions
on how to do this.
4. Right-click the textured face and choose Texture➪Projected.
This ensures that the texture is projected, which is the key to this whole
operation.
5. Use the Paint Bucket tool with the Alt key (Ô on a Mac) held down to
sample the projected texture.
This “loads” your Paint Bucket tool with the projected texture.
6. Use the Paint Bucket tool without pressing anything on your key-
board to paint the curved surface with the projected texture.
If everything goes as it’s supposed to, the photo texture should be
painted on your curved surface; the pixels in the image should look
stretched in some places.
7. Delete the flat surface that you originally mapped the image to; you
don’t need it anymore.
If you’re trying to do this on your own curved surface, and things don’t seem
to be working, your curved surface is probably part of a group or component.
Either explode or double-click to edit the group or component before you do
Step 6 and see if that helps.

Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

Modeling Directly from a Photo:
Introducing Photo Match
The first time I saw Photo Match in action (which wasn’t very long ago — it’s
a new feature in SketchUp 6), I giggled and clapped my hands like a 2-year-old
at a petting zoo. I’m not ashamed of it, either. Sometimes technology that’s so
useful, so unexpectedly satisfying, comes along, and you just can’t help your-
self. Besides — people think I’m a little strange, anyway.
So what’s it do? You can use Photo Match to do a couple of things:
 Build a model based on a photograph: If you have a good photograph
(or multiple photographs) of the thing you want to model in SketchUp,
Photo Match can help you set things up so that building your model is
much easier.
 Match your model view to a photograph: Perhaps you have a model 
of a building and a photograph of the spot where the building will be
constructed. You can use Photo Match to position your “camera” in
SketchUp to be exactly where the real-life camera was when the photo-
graph was taken. Then, you can create a composite image that shows
what your building will look like in context.
Photo Match only works on photographs of objects with at least one pair of
surfaces that are at right angles to each other. Luckily, this includes millions
of things you might want to build, but still, if the thing you want to Photo
Match is entirely round, or wavy, or even triangular, Photo Match won’t work.
Looking at all the pretty colors
Like some of SketchUp’s other features, Photo Match is more of a method
than a tool: You use it to set things up, you model a bit, you use the Photo
Match dialog box a bit, and so on. If you don’t know the basics of modeling in
SketchUp yet, you won’t have any luck with Photo Match — it’s really more of
an intermediate-level feature, if such a thing exists.
Color Plate 9 shows what your screen might look like when you’re in the
throes of Photo Match. I’ll admit it’s daunting, but after you’ve used it once 
or twice, it’s not so bad. I include the image in the color section of this book
because Photo Match (at least at the beginning of the process) uses color as
a critical part of its user interface.
184
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

The following elements of Photo Match’s interface show up in your modeling
window:
 Photograph: The photograph you pick to create a new Photo Match
shows up as a kind of background in your modeling window; it stays
there as long as you don’t use Orbit to change your view. To bring it
back, click the Scene tab (at the top of your modeling window) labeled
with the photograph’s name.
 Perspective bars: These come in two pairs: one green and one red. You
use them when you’re setting up a new Photo Match by dragging their
ends (grips) to line them up with perpendicular pairs of parallel edges in
your photograph. For a clearer explanation of how this works, see the
next section in this chapter.
 Horizon line: This is a yellow, horizontal bar that, in most cases, you
won’t have to use. It represents the horizon line in your model view, 
and as long as you placed the perspective bars correctly, it takes care 
of itself.
 Vanishing point grips: These live at both ends of the horizon line, and
once again, as long as you did a good job of setting up the perspective
bars, you shouldn’t have to touch them.
 Axis origin: This is the spot where the red, green, and blue axes meet.
You position it yourself to tell SketchUp where the ground surface is.
 Scale line/vertical axis: Clicking and dragging this blue line lets you
roughly scale your photograph by using the colored Photo Match grid
lines. After you’re done, you can always scale your model more accu-
rately using the Tape Measure tool (check out Chapter 2 for more infor-
mation on how to do this).
You also need to work with a few things that appear outside your modeling
window:
 Photo Match scene tab: When you create a new Photo Match, you create
a new scene, too (you can read all about scenes in Chapter 10). Clicking
a Photo Match scene tab returns your view to the one you set up when
you created (or edited) that Photo Match. It also makes that Photo
Match’s photograph reappear — handy if you’ve orbited into another
view.
 Photo Match dialog box. This is Photo Match Mission Control. It’s
where you can find almost all the controls you need for creating, editing,
and working with your Photo Match.
185
Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

Creating a new Photo Match
Setting up a new Photo Match is generally a step-by-step procedure. Whether
you’re building a new model using Photo Match or lining up an existing
model with a photograph, you start by getting your modeling window ready
to create a new Photo Match. How you do this depends on which one you’re
trying to do:
 Use a photograph to build a model: If this is what you want to do, open
a fresh, new SketchUp file and you’re good to go.
 Line up a model you’ve built already with a photograph: This case
requires you to re-orient your view and then reposition your drawing
axes before you’re ready to create a new Photo Match.
Follow these steps to do either:
1. Orbit around until your model view more or less matches the camera
position in your photograph.
2. Choose Tools➪Axes.
3. Click to place your Axis Origin (where your colored axes meet) some-
where on your model. Try to choose a spot that’s also visible in your
photograph, if there is one.
4. Click somewhere in the lower-left quadrant of your modeling window
to make sure that the red axis runs from the upper-left to the lower-
right corner of your screen.
5. Watch your linear inferences (more about these in Chapter 2) to be
sure that your repositioned red axis is parallel to some of the edges 
in your model.
6. Click somewhere in the upper-right quadrant of your modeling
window to make sure that the blue axis is pointing up.
After your modeling window is set up, follow these steps to create a new
Photo Match in your SketchUp file:
1. Choose Camera➪New Photo Match.
This opens the New Photo Match dialog box.
2. In the dialog box that opens, select the image on your computer that
you want to use as the basis for your Photo Match and click the Open
button.
The dialog box closes, and you see the image you chose in your modeling
window. You also see a jumble of colorful techno-spaghetti all over the
place. Don’t worry — it’s all part of the Photo Match interface. Figure 7-13
gives you an idea of what I’m referring to (Color Plate 10 shows the same
image in color).
186
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

Photo Match requires that you use certain kinds of photographs in order
for it to work properly. See the sidebar “Taking the right kind of picture,”
later in this chapter, for pointers on what kinds of photos you can — and
can’t — use for Photo Match.
3. In the Photo Match dialog box (which should open automatically),
choose the style that matches your photograph.
The style buttons in the Photo Match dialog box correspond to three dif-
ferent types of photographs you might be using. Choose Inside if your
photo is an interior view, Above if it’s an aerial shot, or Outside if your
photo is an exterior view taken from a human vantage point. Figure 7-14
shows examples of each of these scenarios.
4. Begin positioning the perspective bars, starting with the two green
ones, by lining them up with any two parallel edges (the tops and 
bottoms of windows are good candidates, as are rooflines, tabletops,
and ceiling tiles).
Take a deep breath — this is easier than it looks. You move each per-
spective bar one at a time, dragging each end into position separately.
Color Plate 11 shows what I mean in color.

Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

The following tips can help you get the bars positioned correctly:
• Zoom in and out (using the scroll wheel on your mouse) to get 
a better view of your photograph while you’re placing your per-
spective bars. The more accurate you can be, the better things 
will turn out.
• Pick nice, long edges in your photograph to match your bars to;
you’ll get better results that way.
• If you’re working with an existing model, it might help to hide it
while you place your perspective bars; sometimes it gets in the
way. Just deselect the Model check box in the Photo Match dialog
box to temporarily hide it.
5. Line up the two red perspective bars with a different set of parallel
edges — just be sure that these parallel edges are perpendicular (at
right angles) to the first pair.
If they’re not perpendicular, Photo Match doesn’t work. Color Plate 12
shows what it looks like when all four perspective bars have been posi-
tioned properly.
6. Drag the axis origin (the little square where the axes come together)
to a place where your building touches the ground.
This is how you tell SketchUp where the ground plane is. Try to make sure
your axis origin is right at the intersection of two perpendicular edges —
it’ll make things easier later on. Color Plate 13 shows what this looks like.
If you’re using Photo Match with an existing model, dragging the axis
origin moves your model, too. Line up your model with the photograph
so that the spot where you placed the axis origin is right on top of the
corresponding spot in your photo. Don’t worry about size right now;
you’ll deal with that in a moment.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

7. Roughly set the scale of your photograph by clicking and dragging
anywhere on the blue scale/vertical axis line to zoom in or out until
your photograph looks to be at about the right scale.
You do this by first setting your grid spacing in the Photo Match dialog
box and then using the grid lines in your modeling window to “eyeball”
the size of your photo until it looks about right.
Color Plate 14 shows an example where my grid spacing is set at 5 feet
(the default setting). Because I know the barn in my photo is about 20
feet tall, I zoom in or out until it’s about 4 grid lines high, because 4
times 5 feet is 20 feet.
If you’re trying to match an existing model to your photo, just zoom in
or out until your model looks like it’s the right size.
You don’t have to be very exact at this stage of the game. You can
always scale your model later by using the Tape Measure tool (Chapter 2
talks about how to do that).
8. Click the Done button in the Photo Match dialog box.
When you click the Done button, you stop editing your Photo Match. All
the colorful lines and grips disappear, and you’re left with the photo you
brought in, your model axes, and your thoughts. It might have seemed
like a lot of magic, but what you did was pretty simple: You used Photo
Match to create a scene (which I talk about extensively in Chapter 10)
with a camera position and lens settings that match the ones used to take
the picture that’s on your screen. In effect, you’re now “standing” exactly
where the photographer was standing when the photograph was taken.
Modeling with Photo Match
Setting up a new Photo Match was just the first step. Now it’s time to use
SketchUp’s modeling tools (with a little help from the Photo Match dialog
box) to build a model based on the photograph you “matched.” Here are a
couple of the basic concepts:
 It’s not a linear process. Building a model using a Photo Matched photo
entails going between drawing edges, orbiting around, drawing some
more edges, going back to your Photo Match scene, and drawing yet
more edges. Every photo is different, so the ones you work with will pre-
sent unique challenges that you’ll (hopefully) have fun figuring out.
 Don’t forget the photo textures. By far one of the coolest features of
Photo Match is its ability to automatically photo-texture your model’s
faces using your photograph as “paint.” It’s a one-button operation, and
it’s guaranteed to make you smile.
189
Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

190
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Taking the right kind of picture
Your level of success with Photo Match depends
to some extent on the photograph you start out
with. Here are some tips for what kind of images
are good candidates for Photo Match:
 Cropped photos won’t work. Photo Match
uses your photo’s center point to help figure
out its perspective; if you try to use a picture
that’s been cropped (had some of the origi-
nal shot cut away), the center point will be
different, and things won’t work properly.
 Make sure that the edges of two perpen-
dicular surfaces are visible in the shot. You
need to be able to see planes that are at
right angles to each other to be able to use
Photo Match.
 Shoot at a 45-degree angle if you can.
Because of the way perspective works,
you’ll get a more accurate result if you use
a photograph where you can see both per-
pendicular surfaces clearly; if one of them
is sharply distorted, you’ll have a harder
time. The images in the following figure
show what I’m talking about.
 Watch out for lens distortion. When you take
a picture with a wide-angle lens, some of the
straight lines in the image “bow” a little bit,
depending on where they are in the frame.
Try to use photos taken with a normal or tele-
photo lens: 50mm to 100mm is a good bet.
Good Photo Match candidate: you can see both sides clearly
Bad Photo Match candidate: bad angle

Follow these steps to start building a model with Photo Match:
1. Click the Photo Match scene tab to make sure that you’re lined up
properly.
If you orbit away from the vantage point you set up with Photo Match,
you’ll know it; your photograph will disappear. You can easily get back
by clicking the scene tab for your Photo Match. It’s labeled with the
name of your photo, and it’s at the top of your modeling window (see
Figure 7-15).
2. Trace one of the edges in your photograph with the Line tool.
Make sure that you’re drawing in one of the three main directions: red,
green, or blue. Color Plate 15 shows this in action.
It’s a good idea to start drawing at the axis origin; it’ll help to keep you
from getting confused.

Chapter 7: Modeling with Photographs

3. Keep tracing with the Line tool until you have a rectangular face.
The key here is to make sure that you keep watching the color of your
edges as you draw. You always want to see your lines turn red, green, or
blue when you’re starting out. Have a look at Color Plate 16 to see what
this looks like.
Be careful not to orbit while you’re drawing — if you do, repeat Step 1
and keep going. You can zoom and pan all you want, though.
4. Click the Project Textures from Photo button in the Photo Match
dialog box.
Every time you do this, SketchUp paints the faces in your model with the
photograph you used to create your Photo Match. The face you created
in Step 3 should now be photo-textured according to the image you used
to model it. Orbit around and you’ll see what I mean (see Color Plate 17).
5. Click the Photo Match scene tab to return to your Photo Match view.
6. Use SketchUp’s modeling tools to continue to “trace” the photograph
in three dimensions.
Here are some pointers for doing this successfully:
• Always start an edge at the end of an edge you’ve already drawn.
If you don’t, your geometry won’t make any sense, and you won’t
end up with what you expect.
• Never draw an edge in “midair.” Okay — this is the same as the
last one, but it bears repeating: If you don’t draw edges based on
other edges, you won’t get good results.
• Orbit frequently to see what’s going on. You’ll be surprised what
you have sometimes — tracing a 2D image in 3D is tricky business.
Get in the habit of orbiting around to check on things and draw
certain edges. Click the Photo Match scene tab to return to the
proper view.
• Use other tools (like Push/Pull and Offset) when appropriate.
Nothing prevents you from using the full complement of SketchUp’s
modeling tools. I just prefer to stick to Line and Eraser while I’m
drawing the basic skeleton of my model with Photo Match. I think
it’s simpler.
• Pay attention to the colors. With a photograph as an underlay, 
it’s a little harder to see what you’re doing. But with Photo Match,
watching to make sure that you’re drawing the edge you intend to
draw is critical.
192
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 

• Draw angles by “connecting the dots.” If you need to trace an
edge in your photo that doesn’t line up with any of the colored
axes (an angled roofline, for example), figure out where the end-
points are by drawing perpendicular edges and connecting them
with an angled line. Color plate 18 shows this in glorious, full-
spectrum detail.
• If you want, keep pressing the Project Textures from Photo
button to use the photograph to paint your model. Of course,
using Project Textures from Photo only works on faces that are 
visible in the photograph. For everything else, you need to use 
the Paint Bucket and the Texture Tweaker (which I describe in 
the first part of this chapter) to do your best.
If you have more than one picture of the thing you want to model, you can
use more than one Photo Match to help you build it. Just get as far as you can
with the first Photo Match and then create a new one, using the geometry
you created as an “existing building.” Color Plate 19 shows a model I started
to build of Habitat 67, in Montreal. I used two pictures to create two Photo
Matches in the same SketchUp file, which let me build more of the model
than I could see in a single picture.

Viewing Your
Model in 
Different Ways

In this part . . .
B
uilding models is actually only half of what Google
SketchUp is all about. After you’ve actually got some-
thing built, you can do a whole bunch of things with your
geometry. Chapter 8 describes Styles, a new feature in
SketchUp 6 that lets you change the way your model
looks. Want to make it look hand-drawn? One click. How
about something more realistic? Another click. Using
Styles is like having a tiny artist strapped to your clicking
finger — but in a good way.
In Chapter 9, I talk about using Shadows to make your
model look more realistic, and (in cases where it’s rele-
vant) to study how the sun will affect your design. Just
like Styles, applying Shadows to your model is laughably
easy; it’s just a matter of clicking a box and moving a
couple of sliders around.
Chapter 10 covers three important aspects of exploring
your model: walking around, Scenes, and Sections. When it
comes to seeing (and showing off) your model from inside
SketchUp, this is pretty much where it begins and ends.

f you’re the sort of person who likes to draw, you’re in for a treat. If you
can’t draw a straight line with a ruler, you’re in for an even bigger treat.
Styles (which is a new feature in SketchUp 6) are all about deciding how your
geometry — all your faces and edges — will actually look. Take a peek at
Color Plate 21 for an idea of what styles can do.
This chapter provides a complete rundown of how to use styles in SketchUp 6.
First off, I talk about why you’d want to use styles in the first place. With so
many options, I go into how you can avoid what I call stylesitis — an inflamma-
tion of your styles related to getting stuck trying to decide how to make your
model look.
Next, I talk about the new Styles dialog box. It’s a little overwhelming at first,
so I spend some time talking about where everything is and what it’s sup-
posed to do. Then I dive into all the different sliders, buttons, toggles, and
check boxes in enough detail that you should be able to apply existing styles,
modify them to suit your taste, and make brand new ones if you need them.
The last part of this chapter deals with saving the styles you want to keep.
Choosing How and Where to Apply Styles
The thing to remember about styles is that they’re endless. With a million
permutations of dozens of settings, you could spend all day fiddling with the
way your model looks. I’ve found that keeping one question in mind — Does

this setting help my model say what I want it to say? — helps me to focus on
what’s important. There’s no doubt styles are cool, but making them useful is
the key to keeping them under control.
To help you make smart decisions about using SketchUp styles, you should
consider at least two factors when you’re “styling” your model:
 The subject of your model’s “level of completeness”: I like to reserve
“sketchy” styles for models that are still evolving. The message this
sends is “this isn’t permanent/I’m open to suggestions/all of this can
change if it has to.” As my design gets closer to its final form, the appear-
ance of my model generally gets less rough and more polished. I use
styles to communicate how much input my audience can have and what
decisions still need to be made.
 How much your audience knows about design: When it comes to how
styles are perceived, there’s a big difference between an architecture-
school jury and a nondesigner client who’s building a house for the first
time. Design professionals are more experienced at understanding 3D
objects from 2D representations, so they don’t need as many visual
“clues” to help them along. The essence of styles is really to provide
these clues, so here’s a rule of thumb: The more your audience knows
about design, the simpler you should keep your styles.
Before you dive in to styles, remember also that a little style goes a long way.
No matter how tempting it is to go hog-wild with the styles settings, please
resist the urge. Remember that the purpose of styles is to help your model
communicate and not to make it look “pretty” or “cool.” If the style of your
work is getting noticed more than its content, tone things down. Figure 8-1
shows an example of going overboard with styles and then reining things in.
Applying Styles to Your Models
The easiest way to get started with styles is to apply the premade styles that
come with SketchUp. You find scads of them, which is great, because seeing
what’s been done is the best way to see what’s possible. As you go through
Figure 8-1:
Abusing
styles is
altogether
too easy.
198
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

this section, you’ll no doubt get ideas for your own styles, and that’s where
the fun begins.
Applying a SketchUp style to your model is a four-step process, and it goes
like this (for additional help, see this book’s companion Web site; see the
Introduction for details):
1. Choose Window➪Styles to open the Styles dialog box.
2. Click the Select tab to make sure that you’re looking at the Select
pane.
3. Choose a styles library from the Styles Libraries drop-down list.
I introduce you to the libraries that come preinstalled with SketchUp 6 in
a moment.
4. Click a style in the Styles window to apply it to your model.
This may come as a surprise, but it’s not possible to view your model without
any style at all. This is because styles are really just combinations of display
settings; some styles are fancier than others, but no matter what you do, you
always have to have a style applied. If you want to get a relatively neutral
view of your model, I suggest choosing from the selection in the Default
Styles library.
One of the best things about SketchUp is that you’re rarely left out in the cold
when it comes to content. Whether it’s styles, components, or materials,
SketchUp comes with plenty of examples to get you started. Figure 8-2 is a
shot of the Styles Libraries drop-down list you’ll see when SketchUp 6 is “new
out of the box.” Here’s what everything does:

Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

 In Model: The In Model library shows you all the styles you’ve applied
to your model. It keeps track of every style you’ve ever applied to your
model, whether that style is still applied or not. To see a current list of
styles in your SketchUp file:
1. Choose the In Model styles library to show a list of styles you’ve
applied to your model.
2. Click the Library Options flyout menu and choose Purge Unused to
get rid of any styles you aren’t currently using.
 Styles: This is a sneaky one, because it’s not actually a styles library.
Instead, it’s a view of your Styles folder: the place on your computer that
contains your styles libraries. If you look carefully, this list is the same one
you see in the middle section of the Styles Libraries drop-down list. Why
is it there? Having it readily accessible means that you can add libraries 
to your Styles folder from right inside SketchUp. Convenient, huh?
 Assorted Styles: Consider this library a sampler of nifty effects that you
can get with the styles settings. A couple of them are very useful, and
some are just downright impressive. If you’re ever trying to convince a
friend to use SketchUp, head for this library of styles first.
 Color Sets: The styles in this library are different combinations of edge,
face, and background colors. If you decide to depart from black and
white, flip through this list to see whether any of them float your boat.
 Default Styles: Think basic. With the exception of the first one (which is
the default style for all new SketchUp files you create), these styles are
as minimal as it gets: white background, black edges, white-and-gray
front-and-back faces, and no fancy edge effects. I use these styles to get
back to a clean starting point for all my models; I like to start simple and
build from there.
 Paper Watermarks: Each of the styles in this library has a different
watermark, or background. Using one of these makes it seem like your
model is drawn on a particular kind of surface. I think this concept has a
lot of potential, but I’d tread lightly with these — really think about the
message you’re sending when you present your digital model on a piece
of “canvas.”
 Sketchy Edges: The Sketchy Edges styles in SketchUp 6 are the result of
more than a year’s work on something called nonphotorealistic rendering
(see the nearby sidebar, “Running from realism: NPR styles,” for the
whole story). Basically, the miracle (okay, technological innovation)
involves using real hand-drawn lines instead of digital ones to render
edges. The result is that you can make your models look more like
manual sketches than ever before. Before SketchUp 6, this effect has
always looked unbelievably cheesy on the computer, like an anxious
robot trying too hard to seem human. Not anymore, though. You can
safely use the Sketchy Edges styles to convey any of the following:
200
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

• That your design is in process
• That your model is a proposal and not a finished product
• That you welcome feedback in any and all forms
 Straight Lines: All the styles in the Straight Lines library are variations
on a very simple theme: The edges in these styles are rendered with pro-
gressively thicker, perfectly straight lines with square corners. You won’t
get a technical pen effect with these styles, though; they still make for a
pretty rough (albeit anally retentive rough) rendering of your model.
201
Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles
Running from realism: NPR styles
In the world of 3D modeling software, the trend
has been toward photorealism. Rays of digital
light are bounced around a billion times inside
your computer until you can see every glint of
sunlight in every dewdrop on every blade of
grass on the lawn. The standard of perfection is
how close the model comes to looking like a
photograph, and in a lot of cases, that standard
has been met — I’ve seen computer renderings
that look more lifelike than life itself.
But what about models of buildings or other
things that aren’t completely finished? Perhaps
you’re an architect who’s designing a house for
a client. If you aren’t sure what kind of tile you’ll
end up using on your roof, how are you sup-
posed to make a photorealistic rendering of it?
You could just go ahead and throw any old tile
up there as a placeholder, but that could back-
fire. Your client could hate the tile and decide not
to hire you without ever telling you why, and all
because of something you didn’t even choose.
What you need is a way to show only the deci-
sions you’ve made so far, and that is exactly why
architects and other designers make sketches
instead of photorealistic renderings. When
you’re designing, decisions don’t all happen at
once, so you need to be able to add detail as your
design evolves. Sketching allows you do that
because it offers a continuum from “cartoony”
to photographic, with everything in between. The
following figure is an illustration of this.
Programs like SketchUp offer what’s called NPR,
or nonphotorealistic rendering, as a way to solve
this problem for people who design in 3D. Instead
of spending processor power on making repre-
sentations that look like photographs, the people
who make SketchUp went in the opposite direc-
tion; they’ve made a tool that lets you make
drawings that are useful throughout the design
process. And because SketchUp’s NPR engine
works in real time, you can make changes on the
fly, in front of your audience.

Making Changes to Styles
If you’re handy in the kitchen, you’ve probably heard the saying that cooking
is an art and baking is a science. Cooking allows you to experiment — adding
a little of this and a dash of that while you’re making a sauce won’t wreck
anything. When it comes to baking, taking liberties with a recipe can be a
train wreck. What was supposed to be a cake can easily turn into a doorstop.
I found this out when I made a lovely chocolate doorstop for my girlfriend’s
birthday not so long ago. . . .
Luckily, making your own styles has a lot more in common with cooking than
it does with baking. Go ahead and fiddle around; you can’t do any irreversible
harm. Playing with styles doesn’t affect the geometry in your model in any
way, and because styles are just combinations of settings, you can always go
back to the way things were before you started.
In this section, I go over the settings in the Edit and Mix panes of the Styles
dialog box, explaining in detail what all the doodads and widgets are for, and
providing a running commentary on why you might choose one setting over
another.
Of the three panes in the Styles dialog box, Edit is definitely the blue whale of
the group. You find more controls and settings here than you can shake a
stick at, so SketchUp’s designers broke the Edit pane up into five tabs. Here’s
a short description of each:
 Edge: The Edge tab contains all the controls that affect the appearance
of edges in your model. This includes their visibility, their color, and
other special effects you can apply.
 Face: This tab controls the appearance of faces in your model, including
their default colors, their visibility, and their transparency.
 Background: The Background tab has controls for setting the color and
visibility of the background, the sky, and the ground plane in your model.
 Watermark: New for SketchUp 6, watermarks are images that you can
use as backgrounds or as overlays. The Watermark tab gives you control
over these.
 Modeling: The Modeling tab provides controls for setting the color and
visibility of a bunch of elements in your model, including section planes
and guides.
The following sections explain each tab in detail; I also provide suggestions
for using some of the settings.
202
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Tweaking edge settings
The Edge tab is tricky because it changes a little bit depending on what kind
of style you currently have applied to your model. NPR styles have different
settings than regular, non-NPR styles. Figure 8-3 shows both versions of the
Edge tab, which you open by choosing Window➪Styles, selecting the Edit
tab, and then clicking the box icon on the far left.
SketchUp 6 comes with two different kinds of styles: regular and NPR. NPR
stands for nonphotorealistic rendering, wherein SketchUp uses digitized, hand-
drawn lines to render the edges in your model. All the styles in the Sketchy
Edges library, as well as all but two (Google Earth and Standard CAD) in the
Assorted Styles library are NPR styles. Because you can create your own
styles based on existing ones, all the styles you create using Edge settings
from one of these NPR styles is an NPR style, too.
Display edges
Most of the time, you’ll be viewing your model with Edges turned on. Because
SketchUp is an edge-based modeler, it’s hard to do any work with them turned
off. Figure 8-4 shows a model with this option turned off (among other options,
which I explain in a moment). Here are a couple of cases where you might not
want to display edges:
 If you’re trying to make your model look as photorealistic as possible
 If you plan to export your model to a program that doesn’t display
edges, and you want to preview how it will look
Regular
NPR

Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

Profiles
Selecting the Profiles check box tells SketchUp to use a thicker line for edges
that outline shapes in your model. If you’re using a non-NPR style, you can
type in the thickness of profile lines you’d like to see. Like all the values in
this tab, profile thickness is measured in pixels.
Using profile lines is a pretty standard drawing convention that’s been
around for a long time. You use them primarily to add depth to views of 
your model by making things in the foreground seem to “pop out.” I think
SketchUp looks better with Profiles on, but I always have mine dialed down to
2 pixels; 3 pixels (which is the default) seems too beefy to me. Take a peek at
Figure 8-4 to see what a difference profiles can make.
Depth Cue
Using different line thicknesses to convey depth is another drawing conven-
tion that’s popular. Objects closest to the viewer are drawn with the thickest
lines, whereas the most distant things in the scene are drawn with the
thinnest ones. The number of line thicknesses varies according to taste, but
it’s usually somewhere between 3 and 6.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Depth Cue is SketchUp’s automatic way of letting you apply this effect to your
models. When its check box is selected, Depth Cue dynamically assigns line
thicknesses (draftspersons call them “line weights”) according to how far away
from you things are in your model. In non-NPR styles, you can tell SketchUp
how many line weights you want. The number you type in is both your desired
number of line weights and the thickness of the fattest line SketchUp will use. I
like to use a maximum line weight of 5 or 6 pixels. SketchUp will always make
the thinnest lines 1 pixel thick because that’s the finest line your computer
monitor can display. Figure 8-4 shows a model with Depth Cue set to 5 pixels.
Here are some guidelines for using Depth Cue:
 Depth Cue looks best on pure line drawings. When you’re using color
and materials, there’s usually plenty of other information in your view
that can supply “depth”; my favorite use for Depth Cue is on black-and-
white perspectives.
205
Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles
In a fog?
If you’re looking for something to provide a
sense of depth in your model views, look no fur-
ther than the Fog feature. New for this version of
SketchUp, Fog does exactly what it says — it
makes your model look like it’s enshrouded in
fog (see the following figure). You’d think that a
feature this neat would be a little complicated,
but it’s the opposite. Follow these three steps to
let the fog roll into your model:
1. Choose Window➪Fog to open the Fog
dialog box.
2. Select the Display Fog check box to turn on
the fog effect.
3. Fool around with the controls until you like
what you see.
I wish the process of controlling how Fog looks
was more scientific, but I’m afraid it’s not. You
just play around with the sliders until you have
the amount of fog you want. But just in case you
absolutely need to know, here’s what the slid-
ers do:
 Top slider (0%): This controls the point in
space at which Fog begins to appear in your
model. When it’s all the way to the right
(toward infinity), you can’t see any fog.
 Bottom slider (100%): This controls the point
in space at which the fog is completely
opaque. As you move the slider from left to
right, you’re moving the “completely invisi-
ble” point farther away.

 Use Depth Cue on big stuff like architecture. In general, people who
draw things like buildings use the multiple-line-weights method, and
people who draw smaller things like blenders and staplers use profile
lines. You can (and should) do whatever you want, but I usually like to
know the conventions.
 When I’m using Depth Cue, I turn off Profiles. I don’t think these two
drawing conventions work well together, so I always choose to use one
or the other.
Extension
This tells SketchUp to extend the edges in your model by the number of
pixels you type into the Extension text box. Refer to Figure 8-4 for an idea 
of what this option does.
You should note that Extension is measured in pixels, which means that your
extensions will appear shorter when you’re zoomed in close to your model,
and longer when you’re zoomed out.
Extending edges is a great way to make your model look sketchy, even if
you’re not using one of the NPR styles. You can use edge extensions to
 Indicate that your model is a quick sketch and not something you 
slaved over
 Show that dimensions and proportions are still up for debate
Endpoints
When I draft “the old way,” I like to begin and end my lines by grinding my
pencil into my paper, just to give my drawing a little flourish. I like how it
looks, and so do a lot of people who draw by hand. Emphasizing endpoints
with a darker, thicker line or dot is a way of making your drawings stand out
more; look at Figure 8-5 to see what I’m talking about.
SketchUp lets you achieve this effect with the Endpoints feature, which is
available only in non-NPR styles. Type in the number of pixels you’d like
SketchUp to emphasize at the end of each edge segment. I especially like 
to use Endpoints in combination with Extension and Depth Cue.
Jitter
Most people either love Jitter or hate it. With it on (it’s only available for non-
NPR styles), SketchUp “jitters” your edges, making it look like you rendered
your model with a burnt stick while driving down a dirt road. I really like the
effect. Before NPR styles came along, Jitter was the best way to make your
model look hand-drawn. Use it if you want to, but be careful — not everyone
will approve of your decision. I use it in the same situations where I use
Extensions. Figure 8-6 shows Jitter in all its glory.
206
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Halo
I really wish Halo were available for non-NPR styles because it’s just that
great. What Halo does is very simple: It automatically ends certain lines
before they run into other ones, creating a “halo” of empty space around
objects in the foreground. This keeps your model looking neat and easy to
read. In fact, this is a drawing trick that pencil-and-paper users have been
using forever to convey depth; look closely at most cartoons and you’ll see
what I mean.

Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

The number you type into the Halo box represents the amount of “breathing
room” SketchUp gives your edges. The unit of measure is pixels, but there’s
no real science to it; just play with the number until things look right to you.
For what it’s worth, I like to crank it up. Take a look at Figure 8-7 to see Halo
in full effect.
Level of Detail
When you slide the Level of Detail controller (which only appears when
you’ve applied an NPR style) back and forth, you’re effectively telling
SketchUp how busy you want your model to look. The farther to the right you
slide it, the more of your edges SketchUp displays. You should experiment
with this setting to see what looks best for your model. Figure 8-8 shows what
happens when I slide the Level of Detail controller from left to right.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Color
You use the Color drop-down list to tell SketchUp what color to use for all the
edges in your model. Here’s what each of the options means:
 All Same: This tells SketchUp to use the same color for all the edges in
your model. You tell it what color to use by clicking the color well on the
right and choosing a color.
 By Material: Choosing this causes your model’s edges to take on the
color of whatever material they’re painted with. Because most people
don’t know that you can paint edges different colors, this doesn’t get
used very often.
 By Axis: Now here’s a useful, but hidden, gem. Choosing to color your
edges “by axis” tells SketchUp to make everything that’s parallel to one of
the colored axes the color of that axis. Edges that aren’t parallel to any of
them stay black. Why is this so important? When something is screwy with
your model — faces won’t extrude, or lines won’t “sink in” — switching
your edge colors to by axis is the first thing you should do. You’ll be sur-
prised how many of your edges aren’t what they seem. Have a look at
Chapter 17 for more about this.
Changing the way faces look
The Face tab of the Styles dialog box is very simple — at least compared to
the Edge tab (what isn’t, really?). This area of the SketchUp user interface
controls the appearance of faces, or surfaces, in your model. From here, you
can affect their color, visibility, and translucency. Figure 8-9 shows the Face
tab in vivid grayscale, and you can open it by choosing Window➪Styles,
selecting the Edit tab, and clicking the box icon that’s second from the left.
The following sections describe each of the elements in detail.
Figure 8-9:
The 
Face tab

209
Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

Choosing default colors for front and back faces
In SketchUp, every face you create has a back and a front. You can choose
what colors to use by default for all new faces you create by clicking the
Front and Back color wells and picking a color. I recommend sticking with
neutral tones for your defaults; you can always paint individual faces later on.
Sometimes when you’re modeling in SketchUp, a face will be turned “inside
out.” This happens for lots of reasons (which all have to do with programming
and other nerdy pursuits), but all you need to know is how to flip them back.
Follow these steps to flip a face around so that the right side is showing:
1. Select the face you want to flip.
2. Right-click and choose Reverse Faces.
Knowing which face is the front and which is the back is especially important 
if you plan to export your model to another program. Some of these, like 3D
Studio Max, use the distinction between front and back to make important 
distinctions about what to display. In these cases, showing the wrong side of a
face can end up producing unexpected results. I talk more about this in Part IV.
Choosing a face style
Even though these are called Face styles, they have nothing to do with styles,
the major new SketchUp feature. Face styles might as well be called Face
modes because that what they are: different modes for viewing the faces in
your model. You can flip between them as much as you like without affecting
your geometry. All they do is change the way SketchUp draws your model on
the screen. Each one has its purpose, and all are shown in Figure 8-10:
 Wireframe: In Wireframe mode, your faces are invisible. Because you
can’t see them, you can’t affect them. Only your edges are visible, which
makes this mode handy for doing two things:
• When you’re selecting edges, switch to Wireframe mode to make
sure that you’ve selected what you meant to select. Because no
faces block your view, this is the best way to make sure that you’re
getting only what you want.
• After you’ve used Intersect with Model, you usually have stray
edges lying around. Wireframe is the quickest way to erase them
because you can see what you’re doing. See Chapter 4 for details
on Intersect with Model.
 Hidden Line: Hidden Line mode displays all your faces using whatever
color you’re using for the background; it’s really as simple as that. If
you’re trying to make a clean, black-and-white line drawing that looks
like a technical illustration, make your background white. (I talk about
how in the section, “Setting up the background,” later in this chapter.) 
I like to use Hidden Line mode with Extensions and either Profiles or
Depth Cue, depending on my subject matter. Shadows look great, too.
210
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

 Shaded: This Face style displays your faces with colors on them. Faces
painted with a solid color appear that color. Faces to which you’ve added
textures are shown with a color that best approximates their overall
color. If your texture has a lot of brown in it, SketchUp picks a brown and
uses that. For models with a lot of these textures, switching to Shaded
mode can really speed up orbiting, zooming, and otherwise navigating
around. Unless I absolutely need to see textures I’ve applied to my faces,
I tend to stay in Shaded mode whenever I’m working on my model.
 Shaded with Textures: Use Shaded with Textures when you want to see
your model with textures visible. Because this mode puts a lot of strain
on your computer, it can also be the slowest mode to work in. I only turn
it on when I’m working on a small model, or when I need to see the tex-
tures I’ve applied to my faces. Obviously, if you’re going for a photoreal-
istic effect, this is the mode to choose. It’s also the mode that best
approximates what your model will look like when (and if) you export it
to Google Earth.
Figure 8-10:

211
Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

 Display Shaded Using All Same: When you want to quickly give your
model a simplified color scheme, use this Face style; it uses your default
front and back face colors to paint your model. Think of it as a compro-
mise between the Hidden Line and Shaded modes — color, but not too
much color.
Seeing through walls with x-rays
Ever wonder what it would be like to be Superman? X-Ray mode is a simple
on-off proposition; you use it when you want to be able to see through faces
by making them translucent (see Figure 8-11). Unlike using translucent mate-
rials on some of your faces (like glass and water), flipping on X-Ray lets you
see through all your faces. I tend to use it when I want to see through a wall
or a floor to show what’s behind it. If you’re in a plan (overhead) view, it’s a
great way to demonstrate how a floor level relates to the one below it.
Adjusting transparency
Because how well SketchUp runs on your computer depends on what’s in
your model, and because displaying transparency (as in translucent materi-
als) is an especially taxing operation for SketchUp and your computer to
handle, you can decide how to display translucent materials:
 Enable transparency: Deselect this check box to display translucent
materials as opaque. You should turn off transparency to speed
SketchUp’s performance if you find that it’s slowed down.
Figure 8-11:
Turn on 
X-Ray to see
through
everything
in your
model.
212
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

 Transparency quality: If you decide to display transparency, you can
further fine-tune your system’s performance by telling SketchUp how to
render that transparency: You have the choice of better performance,
nicer graphics, or an average of the two. Which one you choose depends
on the size and complexity of your model, the speed of your computer,
and the nature of your audience.
Setting up the background
In the Background tab of the Styles dialog box, you choose colors and decide
whether you want to be able to see a sky and a ground plane. It doesn’t get
less complicated than this folks. Check out Figure 8-12 to get a view of the
Background tab, along with an idea of how it works. To open these options in
your own copy of SketchUp, choose Window➪Styles, select the Edit tab, and
click the middle icon, at the top of the tab. You have the following options on
the Background tab:
 Background: Click the color well to choose a color for the background 
of your model. If you’re going for a blueprint or blackboard effect, pick a
dark color and then change your edge color to white in the Edge tab. For
most models, I set the background to white — I guess I’m a traditionalist.
 Sky: If you turn on the Sky feature, SketchUp paints everything above
the horizon with any color you want; click the color well to choose one.
The sky is rendered as a gradient that gets lighter the closer it gets to the
horizon. This makes things slightly more realistic, but the real purpose
of the Sky tool is to provide a point of reference for your model. In 3D
views of big things like architecture, it’s nice to be able to see the hori-
zon. Another reason for turning on the sky is to “set the mood” — keep
in mind that the sky isn’t always blue. I’ve seen some beautiful SketchUp
renderings wherein the sky was sunset (or maybe nuclear winter)
orange. Play around and see what you like.
 Ground: Just like the Sky tool, you can choose to display a ground plane
in your model. You can pick the color by clicking the color well, and you
can even choose to have the ground be translucent. I have to admit that
I’m not a big fan of turning on the Ground feature, and here’s why: It’s
very hard to find a ground color that looks halfway good, no matter what
you’re building. I also don’t like the fact that you can’t dig into the earth
to make sunken spaces (like courtyards) with the ground turned on.
Instead of turning on this feature, I prefer to make my own ground
planes with faces and edges. It’s more flexible, and I think it looks better.
If you find that you need to see the ground, or that you want to, you can
choose to not be able to see it when you’re below it, which is a useful
option. Just deselect the Show Ground from Below check box to make
this happen.

Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

Working with watermarks
It’s time to put your thinking cap back on. Watermarks, which are brand new
for SketchUp 6, are much easier to understand if you don’t think about them
as actual watermarks. They’re not anything like watermarks, in fact — they’re
much more useful. If I had to define them (and because I’m writing this book,
I guess I do), I’d put it this way: Watermarks are graphics that you can apply
either behind or in front of your model to produce certain effects. Here are a
few of the things you can do with SketchUp watermarks:
 Simulate a paper texture, just like the styles in the Paper Watermarks
library
 Apply a permanent logo or other graphic to your model view
 Layer a translucent or cutout image in the foreground to simulate look-
ing through a frosted window or binoculars
 Add a photographic background like “Outer Space” or “Inside My Colon”
to create a unique model setting
Eyeing the watermark controls
Figure 8-13 shows the Watermark tab of the Styles dialog box. Here’s a brief
introduction to what the controls do:
 Display Watermarks: Displaying watermarks is an all-or-nothing propo-
sition; if you have more than one, you can turn them all on or all off.
 Add Watermark: Click this button to add a new watermark to your
model view. You’re asked to select an image file on your computer and
then you’re taken through the Choose Watermark procedure to set
things up.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

 Remove Watermark: Select the watermark you want to delete and then
click this button to remove it.
 Edit Watermark: Selecting a watermark and then clicking this button
opens the Edit Watermark dialog box, where you can change your water-
mark’s properties. Editing a watermark is similar to creating a new one; I
cover that in the next section.
 Watermark List: This list shows all your watermarks in relation to some-
thing called Model Space, which is the space occupied by your model.
All watermarks are either in front of or behind your model, making them
overlays or underlays, respectively.
 Move Up or Down: Use these buttons to change the “stacking” order of
the watermarks in your model view. Select the watermark you want to
move in the list and then click one of these buttons to move it up or
down in the order.
Adding a watermark
Watermarks are by no means simple, but working with them, miraculously
enough, is. Follow these steps to add a watermark to your model view:
1. Click the Add Watermark button to begin the process of adding a
watermark.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Find the image you want to use as a watermark and then click the
Open button to open the first Choose Watermark dialog box (see
Figure 8-14).
You can use any of these graphics file formats: TIFF, JPEG, PNG, and GIF.

tab, new for

Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

This is way beyond the scope of this book, but I think it’s worth men-
tioning because you’re bound to need this sooner or later: If you want 
to make a watermark out of an image that isn’t a solid rectangle (like a
logo), you need to use a graphics file format, like PNG or GIF, that sup-
ports alpha channels. An alpha channel is an extra layer of information
in a graphics file that describes which areas of your image are supposed
to be transparent. It sounds complicated, but it’s really a straightfor-
ward concept. To make an image with an alpha channel, you need a
piece of software like Photoshop. Try searching for “alpha channels” 
on Google for more information.
3. Type in a name for your watermark in the Name box.
4. Choose whether you want your new watermark to be in the back-
ground or in the foreground as an overlay and click the Next button.
5. Decide whether to use brightness for transparency.
Selecting this check box tells SketchUp to make your watermark trans-
parent, which kind of simulates a real watermark. How transparent each
part becomes is based on how bright it is. White is the brightest color,
so anything white in your watermark becomes completely transparent.
Things that are black turn your background color, and everything in
between turns a shade of your background color.
6. Adjust the amount that your watermark blends with what’s behind it,
and click the Next button.
In this case, Blend is really just a synonym for Transparency. By sliding
the Blend slider back and forth, you can adjust the transparency of your
watermark.
Blend comes in handy for making paper textures because that process
involves using the same watermark twice: once as an overlay and once
as an underlay. The overlay version gets “blended” in so that your model
appears to be drawn on top of it. To see how this works, apply one of
the Paper Texture styles to your model, and then edit each of the water-
marks to check out its settings.

The Choose
Watermark
series of

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

7. Decide how you want your watermark to be displayed and then click
the Finish button.
You have three choices for how SketchUp can display your watermark:
stretched to fit the entire window, tiled across the window, and posi-
tioned in the window. Each is illustrated in Figure 8-15. If you select
Stretched to Fit the Entire Window, be sure to select the Locked Aspect
Ratio check box if your watermark is a logo that you don’t want to
appear distorted.
Editing a watermark
You can edit any watermark in your SketchUp file at any time. Follow these
simple steps to edit a watermark:
1. Select the watermark you want to edit in the Watermark list.
You can find the Watermark list on the Watermark tab, in the Edit pane
of the Styles dialog box.
2. Click the Edit Watermark button to open the Edit Watermark dialog box.
The Edit Watermark button looks like a couple of little gears; it’s right
next to the Add and Delete Watermark buttons above the Watermark list.

Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

3. Use the controls in the Edit Watermark dialog box and click the OK
button when you’re done.
For a complete description of the controls in this dialog box, see the 
previous section in this chapter.
Tweaking modeling settings
All you need to know about the controls in the Modeling tab (see Figure 8-16)
of the Styles dialog box is that there’s not much to know. You use the controls
to adjust the color and visibility of all the elements of your model that aren’t
geometry. To open these options, choose Window➪Styles, select the Edit tab,
and click the box icon on the far right, at the top of the tab. The controls are
described as follows:
 Controls with color wells: Click the wells to change the color of that
type of element.
 Section cut width: This refers to the thickness of the lines, in pixels, 
that make up the section cut when you’re using a section plane. For
more about this, have a look at the information on cutting sections 
in Chapter 10.
 Controls with check boxes: Use these to control the visibility of that
type of element in your model. Three of them are a little confusing:
• Color by Layer: Tells SketchUp to color your geometry according
to the colors you’ve set up in the Layers dialog box. Check out
Chapter 8 for more on this.
• Section Planes: This refers to the section plane objects that you
use to cut sections. They’re gray with four arrows on their corners.
• Section Cuts: Unlike section planes, this setting controls the visibil-
ity of the section cut effect itself. With this deselected, your sec-
tion planes won’t appear to be cutting anything.
Mixing styles to create new ones
You can make new styles in two very different ways; which you choose
depends on what kind of style you’re trying to make. If you’ve been reading
through this chapter from the beginning, you’re already familiar with the first
method of creating your own styles:
218
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

 Use the Edit pane to change settings until you like what you see. This
method is handy and quick, especially if you already know what all the
controls do. You can almost always use the Edit pane to make your style
adjustments. There’s only one exception: It’s impossible to switch from a
regular to an NPR (Sketchy Edges) Edge style (or vice versa) using only the
Edit pane; for that, you need to use the next method of creating new styles.
 Use the Mix pane to combine features of multiple styles. Instead of work-
ing through the tabs of the Edit pane, flipping controls on and off, sliding
sliders, and picking colors, the Mix pane lets you build new styles by
dropping existing ones onto special “category” wells. This is the only way
you can switch a style’s edge settings between NPR and non-NPR lines.
NPR refers to the styles in the Assorted Styles and Sketchy Edges Styles
libraries. These nonphotorealistic rendering styles use scanned, hand-drawn
lines to draw the edges in your model. You can’t make your own NPR styles
from lines you draw and scan in yourself, but you can adapt the existing ones
by editing them and saving the changed versions as new styles.
The basic principle of the Mix pane is that you use the secondary selection
pane (which appears automatically when you choose the Mix pane) to
choose styles from which you want to sample certain settings. The sec-
ondary selection pane is the lower part of the Styles dialog box, from the
word “Select” down, as you can see in Figure 8-17. You drag (on a Mac) or
sample (in Windows) these styles onto one or more of the category wells to
apply the settings you want to your current style. The category wells are the
five, long “Settings” rectangles in the middle of the Styles dialog box, as
shown in Figure 8-17.
Figure 8-16:
The controls
on the
Modeling
tab are
every bit as
simple as
they look.
219
Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

Follow these steps to change a style using the Mix pane:
1. Choose Window➪Styles and click the Mix tab in the Styles dialog box
to open the Mix pane.
As part of the Mix pane, the secondary selection pane opens at the
bottom of the dialog box. This provides you with a way to view your
styles without having to switch from the Mix pane to the Select one.
2. Find the style you want to sample from in the secondary selection
pane. You can call this your source style.
Say that you’re working on a new style, and you want your edges to look
just like those in the Sketchy Marker Loose style that came with SketchUp.
In this example, choose the Sketchy Edges library from the Styles
Libraries drop-down list, where you’ll find the Sketchy Marker Loose style.
3. Windows users: Click the source style from the Styles list in the sec-
ondary selection pane to sample it and then click the category well
that corresponds to the style setting you want to apply.
Mac users: Drag your source style from the Styles list in the secondary
selection pane to the category well that corresponds to the style set-
ting you want to apply.
2. Click here to add sample
    settings to current style
1. Click here to sample style
Figure 8-17:

220
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

In this case, sample the Sketchy Marker Loose style from the secondary
selection pane and drop it on the Edge Settings Category well because
you want the edge settings from that style to be applied to the style
you’re working on.
4. To save your style after you’re done adding all the bits and pieces, see
the following section.
Saving and Sharing Styles You Make
As you’re working along in SketchUp, you’ll want to create your own styles.
You’ll also want to save those styles so that you can use them in other
models. If you’re part of a team, it’s likely that everyone will want to have
access to the same styles so that all your models look consistent. The follow-
ing sections describe how to do all of these things, and more.
Saving the styles you’ve made
When it comes to creating your own styles, you can approach things in two
different ways. Each of these ways gets its own button (see Figure 8-18):
 Create new style: Clicking this button creates a new style with the set-
tings you currently have active. When you create a new style, it shows
up in your In Model library of styles and is saved with your model. The
Create button can be found in the upper-right corner of the dialog box,
and looks like a couple of objects with a “+” sign on it.
 Update style with changes: This button updates the current style with
any settings changes you’ve made in the Edit or Mix panes. If you want
to modify an existing style without creating a new one, this is the way to
go. You can find the Update button right below the Create button in the
upper-right corner of the dialog box; it looks like two arrows chasing
each other around in a circle.
Updating an existing style
To make adjustments to a style in your model, you need to update it. Follow
these steps to update a style:
1. Apply the style you want to update to your model.
If you need help with this, follow the steps in the section, “Applying
Styles to Your Models,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Use the controls in the Edit pane to make changes to the style.
For a complete description of how to modify a style, check out the 
section “Making Changes to Styles,” earlier in this chapter.
221
Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

3. Click the Update Style with Changes button in the Styles dialog box to
update the style with your changes.
You use the Update Style with Changes button to rename existing styles, too.
Just type the new name into the Name box (at the top of the Styles dialog
box), press Enter, and then click the Update button.
When you update a style, only the copy of the style that’s saved with your
model is updated. You aren’t altering the copy of the style that shows up in
every new SketchUp file you create.
Creating a new style
Creating a new style adds it to your In Model library of styles, which means
that you can come back and apply it to your model anytime you like. Follow
these steps to create a new style:
1. Click the Create New Style button in the Styles dialog box.
This duplicates the style that was applied to your model before you
clicked the Create New Style button. Your new style appears in your In
Model library as [name of the original style]1.
2. Use the controls in the Edit pane to set up your style the way you want.
Have a look at the section “Making Changes to Styles,” earlier in this
chapter, for a rundown on using the controls in the Edit pane of the
Styles dialog box.
Frequently, you’ll want to make a new style after you’ve already made
changes to an existing one. If you want to create a new style that reflects
modifications you’ve already made, just switch Steps 1 and 2 around.
Update Existing Style
Create New Style

and Create
buttons in

dialog box.
222
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

3. Use the Name box (at the top of the Styles dialog box) to give your
new style a name and press Enter.
If you want, you can also give your new style a description in the
Description box, though you might want to wait until later. After all, it’s
hard to describe something you haven’t made yet.
4. Click the Update button.
This updates your new style with all the changes you made in Steps 2
and 3.
5. Check the In Model library in the Select pane to make sure that your
new style is there.
Click the In Model button (which looks like a little house) to see your In
Model Styles library. Your new style should appear alphabetically in the list.
If a bunch of styles exist in your In Model library that you aren’t using 
anymore and you want to clean things up, right-click the Library Options
flyout menu and choose Purge Unused. This gets rid of any styles that aren’t
currently applied to any scenes in your model. Have a look at Chapter 10 to
find out more about scenes.
Creating a new style doesn’t automatically make it available for use in other
SketchUp files. To find out how to do this, have a look the section “Sharing
styles with other models,” later in this chapter.
Working with Style Library options
After you’ve updated or created a style, you’ll probably want to make that
style available for use in other SketchUp models. To make this happen, you
need to understand styles libraries: how to make them, how to use them, 
and how to share them with other people. This section explores your many
library options; the next section explains how to save and share a library for
yourself or on a network.
To see how you can use libraries to manage your styles, take a closer look at
the Library Options flyout menu in the Select pane of the Styles dialog box
(click the arrow icon to the right of the Libraries drop-down list). On that
menu, you see the following options:
 Open or Create a Library (Windows users): Lets you either choose a
library that already exists or make a new one. Whichever you do, the
library you end up with is added to your Libraries drop-down list.
 Open an Existing Library (Mac users): Lets you choose an existing
styles library from anywhere on your computer or network. A styles
library isn’t a special kind of file; it’s any folder that contains one or
more styles. You can keep your styles libraries anywhere you want on
your computer or network.
223
Chapter 8: Changing Your Model’s Appearance with Styles

 Create a New Library (Mac users): Lets you create a new styles library
anywhere on your computer or network. Because libraries are really just
folders, this is a nifty shortcut for creating a new folder without having to
leave SketchUp. After you’ve created a new library, you can put styles in
it. Select the Add to Favorites check box in the Add New Library dialog
box to automatically add your new library to the Libraries drop-down list.
 Save Library As: Allows you to save copies of the styles in your In
Model library to a location on your computer or network. If you don’t
see this option, make sure that your In Model library is selected in the
Libraries drop-down list.
 Add Library to Favorites: Adds the currently selected library to the
Favorites section of the Libraries drop-down list. Your Favorite Styles
libraries are available in every SketchUp model you’re working on,
which makes this a great way to gather together libraries that might
exist anywhere on your computer or network.
 Remove Library from Favorites: Pops open a dialog box that lets you
choose which libraries to remove from the Favorites section of your
Libraries drop-down list.
 Thumbnails and List View: Allows you to view your styles in a number of
different ways. List view is particularly important if you have styles with
subtle differences that don’t show up in the Preview Thumbnail view.
 Get More: Opens a Web browser window and takes you to a place on the
Internet where you can download more styles. You need to be online for
this option to work.
Creating and sharing a library 
for the styles you make
Follow these steps to create a library to contain your styles:
1. Choose Window➪Styles to open the Styles dialog box.
2. Click the Select tab to make sure that you’re looking at the Select pane.
3. Click the Library Options flyout menu and choose Create a New Library.
This opens the Add New Library dialog box.
4. Navigate to the folder on your computer or network where you would
like to create your library.
You can locate your new library anywhere you like, but I recommend
putting it in the same folder as the other styles libraries on your computer:
• Windows: C:/Program Files/Google/Google SketchUp 6/Styles
• Mac: Hard Drive/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp 6/
SketchUp/Styles
224
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

5. Click Make New Folder if you’re on a Windows computer, or New
Folder if you’re on a Mac.
The new folder you create will become your new library.
6. Type in a name for your new library.
Call your new library “Josephine’s Library.” You can call it something
else if your name isn’t Josephine.
7. If you’re on a Mac, make sure that the Add to Favorites check box is
checked.
8. Click the Save button.
The Add New Library dialog box closes, and your library is added to the
Favorites section of the Libraries drop-down list. It will be there in every
SketchUp model you open on this computer.
Sharing styles with other models
Follow these steps to make a style available for use in other SketchUp files:
1. Choose Window➪Styles, and in the Style dialog box that appears,
click the Select tab.
2. Click the In Model button to display your In Model library.
The In Model button looks like a little house. The In Model library con-
tains all the styles you’ve used in your model, including the ones you’ve
created.
3. Click the Show Secondary Selection Pane button.
When you click this button, which looks like a black-and-white rectangle
and is in the upper-right corner of the Styles dialog box, a second copy
of the Select pane pops out of the bottom of the Styles dialog box (see
Figure 8-19). You use this pane to drag and drop styles between folders
on your computer, which makes it easier to keep them organized.
4. In the secondary selection pane, choose the library to which you want
to add your style.
If you’ve created a library specifically for the styles you make, choose that
one, or you can pick any of the libraries in the Libraries drop-down list.
5. Drag your style from the In Model styles list to the Styles list in the
secondary selection pane (see Figure 8-20).
By dragging and dropping your style from the upper list to the lower one,
you’re making it available to anyone who has access to that library. This
means that you can use it in other SketchUp models you build on your
computer. To share it with other members of your team, copy your style to
a library somewhere where other people can get to it, like on a network.

Chapter 9
Working with Light and Shadow
In This Chapter
 Finding out about the Shadows dialog box
 Using shadows to make models look better
 Displaying and studying accurate shadows
 Creating a simple shadow animation
You can always rely on a few features in SketchUp to make people’s 
jaws drop, and the ability to cast shadows is definitely one of them.
Displaying shadows is an easy operation — it’s a matter of clicking a single
button — and the Shadows feature offers lots of ways to make your models
look more realistic, more accurate, and more readable.
Typically, you add shadows to a SketchUp drawing for two key reasons:
 To display or print a model in a more realistic way: Turning on shad-
ows adds depth and realism and gives your model an added level of com-
plexity that makes it look like you worked harder than you really did.
 To study the effect of the sun on what you’ve built (or plan to build) in
a specific geographic location: Shadow studies are an integral part of
the design of any built object. If you’re making a sunroom, you need to
know that the sun is actually going to hit it, no? You can use SketchUp to
show exactly how the sun will affect your creation, at every time of day,
on every day of the year.
In this chapter, I start out with a brief, nuts-and-bolts description of how all
the controls work, without diving too much into why you’d want to pick one
setting instead of another. The middle portions are devoted to running
through each of the above scenarios and using the controls to make SketchUp
do exactly what you want it to. In the last part of the chapter, I dive into some
more advanced material — how to animate your shadows to see how they
change over time.

Discovering SketchUp’s Shadow Settings
The basic thing to understand about shadows in SketchUp is that, just like in
real life, they’re controlled by changing the position of the sun. If SketchUp
were another kind of program, you might have to type in a bunch of informa-
tion about azimuths and angles, but luckily, it’s not. Because the sun moves
in exactly the same way every year, you just pick a date and time, and
SketchUp automatically displays the correct shadows by figuring out where
the sun should be. Hooray for math!
Luckily for us, using shadows in SketchUp is something you can figure out
without fear of messing anything up. Turning on shadows and fiddling with
them can never do anything to your model except change the way it’s dis-
played. None of the stuff you’ve built can be affected in any way, so go ahead
and experiment with shadow settings to your heart’s content — I promise
you’ll never break anything.
You do all these simple maneuvers in the Shadow Settings dialog box, shown
in Figure 9-1. The sections that follow introduce how the controls work so
that you can apply to them to your model.
Turning on the sun
Shadows aren’t on by default, so the first thing you need to know about
applying shadows is how to turn them on. Follow these simple steps (and
check out this book’s companion Web site for additional help; see the
Introduction for details about the site):
1. Choose Window➪Shadows to display the Shadow Settings dialog box.
2. At the top of the dialog box, select the Display Shadows check box.
Clicking it “turns on” the sun in SketchUp, casting shadows throughout
your model and, generally speaking, making everything much more
exciting.
Figure 9-1:
The Shadow
Settings
dialog box.
228
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Setting a shadow’s time and date
The Shadow Settings dialog box has time and date controls, which you use to
change the position of the SketchUp “sun.” The time and date you choose, in
turn, controls the appearance of shadows in your model:
 Setting the time: You don’t have to be Copernicus to figure out how to
set the time of day; move the Time slider back and forth, or type a time
into the little box on the right. Use a colon (:) to separate the hours from
the minutes, and type in AM or PM if you’re using 12-hour time. Notice
the little times at each end of the slider? These represent sunrise and
sunset for the day of the year you’ve set in the Date control, described
in the next point.
 Setting the date: Just like the time of day, you set the day of the year by
moving the Date slider back and forth, or by typing in a date in the little
box on the right. Use a forward slash (/) to separate the month from the
day, entering the month first. If you slide the Date control back and
forth, notice that the sunrise and sunset times change in the Time 
control, in the previous point.
To toggle the extra shadow controls open or closed, click the triangular
Expand button in the upper-right corner of the Shadow Settings dialog box.
229
Chapter 9: Working with Light and Shadow
Controlling contrast
You can use the Shadow Settings dialog box to
control the overall contrast in your model view,
as shown in Figure 9-3. The Light and Dark slid-
ers seem simple, but it’s not immediately obvi-
ous to most people how they work. Most of the
time, you’ll want to leave these settings the way
they are, but here’s what they do, just in case
you want to work with them:
 The Light slider controls the lightness of
surfaces that are not in shadow. Sliding it all
the way to the left is like a solar eclipse —
everything looks like it’s in the shade. The
default setting for Light is 80.
 The Dark slider controls the darkness of
shadows cast both on surfaces and on the
ground. Sliding it all the way to the right is
like having no shadows. The default setting
for Darkness is 20.
The Use Sun for Shading check box is confusing
because it doesn’t actually control shadows,
even though it’s in the Shadow Settings dialog
box. It has a big effect on the appearance of
your model, though:
 When it’s selected, you see more contrast in
your model view. That’s because SketchUp
is lighting surfaces as if shadows are turned
on, regardless of whether they are. You
should leave this check box selected most of
the time; things look better with it on.
 When it’s deselected, things look flatter.
You should deselect this check box when
you’re working with photos mapped onto
faces; doing so makes it easier to see what
you’re doing. Select the Use Sun for Shading
check box again when you’re ready to pre-
sent your work.

Choosing where shadows are displayed
The Display check boxes in the Shadow Settings dialog box enable you to
control where shadows are cast. Depending on your model, you may want to
toggle these on or off. Figure 9-2 shows shadows only on faces (top), only on
the ground (middle), and from the edges of the model (bottom):

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

 On Faces: Deselecting the On Faces check box means that shadows will
be not be cast on faces in your model. This is on by default, and should
probably be left on, unless you only want to cast shadows on the
ground. For what it’s worth, I always have it selected.
 On Ground: Deselecting the On Ground check box causes shadows not to
be cast on the ground plane. Again, this is on by default, but sometimes
you’ll want to turn it off. A prime example of this is when something
you’re building extends underground.
 From Edges: Selecting the From Edges check box tells SketchUp to allow
edges to cast shadows. This applies to single edges that are not associ-
ated with faces — things like ropes, poles, and sticks are often modeled
with edges like these.
Using Shadows to Add Depth and Realism
The neat thing about shadows in SketchUp is how easy they are to apply —
and how easy they are to adjust. In the previous sections, I give a dry run-
down of the basic controls in the Shadow Settings dialog box. In the following
sections, I show you how to use those controls to add depth, realism, and
delicious nuance to your models. If only Caravaggio had had it so good. . . .
There are lots of times when you’ll need to use shadows to make your draw-
ings read better; most of them fit into one of the following three categories:
 Indoor scenes: The sun is the only source of lighting that SketchUp has,
so any shadows you use in interior views have to come from it.
 Objects that aren’t in any particular location: For things like cars and
furniture, it doesn’t matter that the shadows are geographically accurate;
all that matters it that they help to make your model look good.
 2D views: Without shadows, it’s next to impossible to read depth in 2D
views of 3D space.
Lighting indoor spaces
Adding shadows to interior views presents an interesting problem: There are
no lights besides the sun in SketchUp, so how are you supposed to make any-
thing that looks halfway realistic? With a ceiling in your room, everything’s
dark. If you leave off the ceiling, your model looks ridiculous. Don’t despair —
here are some tricks I’ve learned:
 Decrease the darkness of the shadows. Sliding the Dark slider to the
right brightens your view considerably. You’ll still be able to see the
shadows cast by the sun coming through windows and other openings,
231
Chapter 9: Working with Light and Shadow

but the whole room won’t look like something bad is about to happen.
Check out Figure 9-3 to see what I mean.
 Make an impossible ceiling. As long as you haven’t modeled anything
on top of the interior you’re planning to show, you can tell the ceiling
not to cast a shadow. That way, sunlight will shine directly onto your fur-
niture, casting gloriously complex shadows all over everything.
Figure 9-3:
Brighten the
room by
decreasing
the Dark
setting.
232
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Figure 9-4 shows this ceiling method in action; follow these steps to do it
yourself:
1. Adjust the settings in the Shadow Settings dialog box until the sun is
shining through one or more windows in your view.
This ensures that shadows cast by objects in your room look like they’re
caused by light from the windows.
To make it seem like overhead lighting is in your space, set the time of
day to about noon. The shadows cast by furniture and similar objects
will be directly below the objects themselves. One more thing: If you
have lighting fixtures on the ceiling, remember to set them not to cast
shadows in the Entity Info dialog box (read on).
2. Choose Window➪Entity Info.
This opens the Entity Info dialog box.
3. Select any faces that make up the ceiling.
Hold down Shift to select more than one thing at a time.
4. In the Entity Info dialog box, deselect the Cast Shadows check box.
The ceiling now no longer casts a shadow, brightening your space 
considerably.
Figure 9-4:
Tell the
ceiling not
to cast a
shadow.
233
Chapter 9: Working with Light and Shadow

5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for the following faces and objects:
• The wall with the windows in it
• The windows themselves
• Any walls in your view that are casting shadows on the floor of
your space
6. Move the Dark slider over to about 50.
This brightens things even more and makes your shadows more 
believable.
If you try the first two methods and shadows just don’t seem to be working,
don’t bother turning on shadows. Instead, try this:
1. In the Shadow Settings dialog box, deselect the Display Shadows
check box to turn off shadows.
2. Select the Use Sun for Shading check box to add some contrast.
3. Slide the Dark slider all the way to the left and the Light slider all the
way to the right to add even more contrast.
4. Move the Time slider around until things look good.
Try to make walls with windows in them darker than walls that might be
“lit” by those windows. Figure 9-5 demonstrates this technique.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Making 3D objects “pop”
Adding shadows to freestanding things like tables and lamps and pineapples
is a mostly aesthetic undertaking; just fiddle with the controls until things
look good to you, and you’ll be okay. Here are some things to keep in mind,
(which are illustrated in Figure 9-6):
 Take it easy on the contrast — especially when it comes to very com-
plex shapes or faces with photos mapped to them. When your model is
too contrasty and dramatic, it can be hard to figure out what’s going on.
To decrease the contrast:
1. Move the Dark slider over to about 40.
2. Move the Light slider down to 60 or 70.
 Shorten your shadows. It’s strange to see objects lit as though the light
source is very far away; overhead lighting looks more natural. To make
your shadows look better, follow these steps:
1. Set the Date slider to a day in the early autumn.
2. Set the Time slider to a time between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
 Don’t be afraid to rotate your model around. Remember that you can’t
get every possible shadow position by using only the controls in the
Shadow Settings dialog box; to get the effect you want, you might have
to rotate your model by selecting it and using the Rotate tool.
 Select the From Edges check box. Lots of times, modelers use free
edges to add fine detail to models (think of a harp or a loom). Selecting
the From Edges check box tells SketchUp to allow those edges to cast
shadows, which makes complex objects look about 900 percent cooler.
 Pay attention to the transparency of faces. When you have a face
painted with a transparent material, you can decide whether that face
should cast a shadow — chances are that it shouldn’t. In SketchUp, the
rule is that materials that are more than 50-percent transparent cast
shadows. So, if you don’t want one of your transparent-looking faces to
cast a shadow, do one of the following:
• Select the face, and then deselect the Cast Shadows check box in
the Entity Info dialog box.
• Adjust the opacity of the face’s material to be less than 50 percent
in the Materials dialog box. For more information on how to do
this, have a look at Chapter 2.
235
Chapter 9: Working with Light and Shadow

Conveying depth in 2D views
Have you ever looked at a roof plan or building elevation (a straight-on view of
the exterior) and wondered what the heck was going on? One of the main rea-
sons that 2D drawings are so hard to read is that they usually don’t convey depth.
Without knowing how close or far away things are, everything turns into a flat
jumble of lines. Of course, experienced draftspersons can use line weight (thick-
ness) and tone to convey depth — SketchUp’s style settings, which you can read
about it Chapter 8, provide some help, but your best bet is to use shadows.
Take a look at Figure 9-7 to see what a difference the addition of shadows can
make to a 2D overhead view of a row of buildings. In Parallel Projection mode,
which is how 99 percent of 2D drawings are made, there’s no way to know
how high any of the buildings are. Turning on shadows reveals a whole new
layer of information.

236
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

When adding shadows to 2D views of your model, here are some things to
keep in mind:
 The convention in architecture is to cast shadows at a 45-degree
angle. If you want your views to look somewhat official, play with the
Time and Date sliders until your shadows are cast at about 45 degrees
from your model. There are probably ways to be super-accurate about
this, but I wouldn’t worry; the point is to make your drawings readable.
 Lighten your shadows. Because the purpose of this exercise is to
increase the legibility of your 2D views, you don’t need to be dramatic.
To be able to see what’s happening in your shadows, crank the Dark
slider in the Shadow Settings dialog box up to about 50.
 The same goes for elevations. An elevation is a 2D view of the side of a
building. Feel free to use shadows to make these drawings clearer, too.
Architects do it all the time, and it makes a huge difference.
Creating Accurate Shadow Studies
One of the most useful features in SketchUp is the ability to display accurate
shadows. To do this, three pieces of information are necessary:
 The time of day
 The day of the year
 The latitude of the building site
The sun’s position (and thus the position of shadows) depends on geo-
graphic location — that is to say, latitude. The shadow cast by a building at
3:00 on March 5 in Minsk is very different from that cast by a similar building,
at the same time of day, on the same date in Nairobi.
If you’re displaying shadows on a model of a toaster oven, geographic loca-
tion probably doesn’t matter to you; the shadows are just there for effect. But
if you’re trying to see how much time your pool deck will spend in the sun
during the summer months, you need to tell SketchUp where you are.
Telling SketchUp where you are
How many of us know the precise latitude of where we live? I sure don’t. It’s a
good thing SketchUp makes it easy to tell it where in the world your model is
supposed to be, as shown in Figure 9-8. In fact, if you’re using SketchUp in
combination with a Google Earth snapshot, your model is already geographi-
cally located. For more information about this, have a look at Chapter 11,
which focuses on sending your model to Google Earth.
237
Chapter 9: Working with Light and Shadow

To give your model a geographic location (even if you think it might already
have one), follow these steps:
1. Somewhere on the ground in your model, draw a short line to indi-
cate the direction of north.
If you’re working with imported geometry (from AutoCAD, for instance)
you might already have a north indicator.
2. Choose Window➪Model Info to open the Model Info dialog box.
3. On the left side of the Model Info dialog box, choose Location.
If the Country drop-down list says Custom, stop here. Your model has
already been geographically located by Google Earth, and you don’t
need to go through any of the following steps. Shadows will be accurate
for wherever you were in Google Earth when you imported a snapshot.
Close the Model Info dialog box, make yourself some coffee, and waste
the time you just saved avoiding the next seven steps.
4. Choose a country from the Country drop-down list.
5. Choose a location from the Location drop-down list.
If the location you want isn’t listed, choose the closest one, or click the
Custom Location button to enter a set of coordinates.
To find coordinates for just about anywhere in the world, try searching
for “city, country coordinates” on Google; something usually pops up.
Figure 9-8:
Giving your
model a

location.
238
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

6. Instead of typing in a north angle (which I find overly complicated),
click the Select button to the right of the North angle box.
Back in your model window, your cursor will have become a biggish
circle with four lines radiating out from the center, as shown in Figure 9-9.
7. Click the southern end of the line you drew in Step 1.
8. Click the northern end of the same line, finishing the operation.
9. If you want, select the Show in Model check box to display the direc-
tion of north as a yellow line.
10. Close the Model Info dialog box.
The shadows in SketchUp are now specific to the geographic location
you’ve just set up. If you like, you can erase the line you drew in Step 1.
Displaying accurate shadows 
for a given time and place
Now that you’ve told SketchUp where your model is, it’s a pretty simple
process to study how the sun will affect your project, as shown in Figure 9-10.
This is the fun part; all you have to do is move some sliders around. If you
have an audience, get ready for some completely undeserved praise.
Figure 9-9:
Telling
SketchUp

north is.
239
Chapter 9: Working with Light and Shadow

To study how the sun will affect your project, follow these steps:
1. Orbit, zoom, and pan around until you have a good view of the part of
your project you want to study.
2. Choose Window➪Shadows to open the Shadow Settings dialog box.
3. Select the Display Shadows check box to turn on SketchUp’s sun.
4. Type a month and day into the box to the right of the Date slider, and
press Enter.
5. Move the Time slider back and forth to see how the shadows will
move over the course of that day.
6. Pick a time of day using the Time controls.
7. Move the Date slider back and forth to see how the sun will affect
your project at that time of day over the course of the year.
Animating a shadow study
As if playing with the shadow settings weren’t sexy enough, it’s a relatively
easy next step to create a simple animation that shows shadows moving over
time. To do this, you’ll use scenes, a feature so impressive and relevant to
this topic I mention it here as well as in Chapter 10, where you’ll find more
detailed coverage of scenes in general.
Figure 9-10:
Studying the
effect of the
sun on your

240
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

To create a simple animation showing the movement of shadows in your
model over time, follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t already done so, give your model a geographic location
by following the steps in the section “Telling SketchUp where you
are,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Orbit, zoom, and pan around until you’re happy with the way your
model looks in the modeling window.
3. If you haven’t already done so, open the Shadow Settings dialog box
by choosing Window➪Shadows.
4. Turn on the sun (and thus the shadows) by making sure that the
Display Shadows check box is selected.
5. Use the controls to pick a time and date.
Try picking a time early in the morning — it’ll make for a better anima-
tion when you’re done (see Figure 9-11).
6. Choose Window➪Scenes to open the Scenes dialog box.
7. Click the Add button (which looks like a plus sign in a circle) in the
Scenes dialog box.
This adds a scene to the list in the Scenes dialog box, and a tab at the
top of your modeling window (see Figure 9-12). If it’s the first scene
you’ve created in this model, it will be called Scene 1.
8. Back in the Shadows dialog box, choose a different time of day.
A time late in the afternoon works well.
241
Chapter 9: Working with Light and Shadow
Uses for shadows
Even if you’re not an architect, you might want
to study shadows accurately for these reasons:
 To figure out where to locate the plants in
your garden that need the most light (or the
most shade)
 To see when sunlight will be coming
straight through the skylight you’re thinking
of installing
 To make sure that the overhang behind your
house will provide enough shade at
lunchtime in the summer
 To plan and build a 50-foot stone sundial as
a birthday gift for your Druidic neighbor

9. Back in the Scenes dialog box, click the Add button again.
This adds Scene 2 to the list in the dialog box and another tab at the top
of your modeling window.
10. Click the tab you created in Step 7.
See the shadows moving? Clicking back and forth between the tabs
causes the shadows to animate between the times of day you set up in
the Shadow Settings dialog box. You can keep changing the date and
time, adding more scenes if you like; it’s your weekend, after all.
11. When you’re ready to animate all the scenes you’ve created, flip to
Chapter 13 to find how to export the animation you just created as a
movie file.
To do a proper shadow study, you need to see where the shadows fall on the
longest and shortest days of the year. In the Northern Hemisphere, these
days are June 21 and December 21, respectively. In the Southern Hemisphere,
it’s the opposite. I think it has something to do with gravity.
Figure 9-11:

Remember that SketchUp does not support daylight savings time. When you
do a shadow study over the course of a year, mentally adjust the shadows an
hour forward if daylight savings time will be in effect.

Presenting Your Model 
Inside SketchUp
In This Chapter
 Walking around inside your model
 Creating scenes to capture particular views
 Making animations with scenes
 Cutting slices through your model with section planes
 Generating plans and sections
A
fter you’ve made a model, you’re probably going to want to show it to
someone. How you present your work depends on the idea you’re trying
to convey. The tricky part about using SketchUp to present a model isn’t
actually using the tools; it’s choosing the right tools to get your idea across
without distracting your audience with a bunch of extra information. Most 3D
models have so much to look at that the real challenge is to figure out a pre-
sentation method that helps you focus on the stuff you want to talk about.
In this chapter, I talk about three different ways to show off your models with-
out ever leaving SketchUp. If you’ve made a building, you can walk around
inside it. You can even walk up and down stairs and ramps — just like in a
video game. You can create animated slide shows by setting up scenes with
different camera views, times of day, and even visual styles. If you want to
talk about what’s inside your model, you can cut sections through it without
taking it apart.
As you’re reading through this chapter, keep in mind what you want your
model to communicate. Think about how you might use each method to make
a different kind of point, and think about the order in which you’d like those
points to be made. As with everything else in SketchUp (and in life, I suppose),
a little bit of planning goes a long way. That said, presenting a model live in
SketchUp is undeniably sexy; you can’t really go wrong, so have fun.

Exploring Your Creation on Foot
Few experiences in life are as satisfying as running around inside your model.
After you’ve made a space, you can drop down into it and explore by walking
around, going up and down stairs, bumping into walls, and even falling off of
ledges. You can check to make sure that the television is visible from the
kitchen, say, or experience what it would be like to wander down the hall. In 
a potentially confusing building (like an airport or a train station), you could
figure out where to put the signs by allowing someone who’s never seen your
model to explore the space “on foot.”
These tools were made for walking
A couple of tools in SketchUp are dedicated to moving around your model as
if you were actually inside it. The first step (no pun intended) is to position
yourself so that it seems like you’re standing inside your model. This can be
tricky with just the Orbit, Pan, and Zoom tools, so SketchUp provides a tool
just for this: Position Camera. After you’re standing in the right spot (and at
the right height), you use the Walk tool to move around. It’s as simple as that.
Standing in the right spot: The Position Camera tool
The essence of the Position Camera tool is its ability to precisely place your
viewpoint in SketchUp in a particular spot. That’s really all it does, but it
works in two different ways (see this book’s Web site for more details; the
Introduction tells you all about the Web site):
 I want to be standing right here. Choose Camera➪Position Camera
from the menu bar and then single-click anywhere in the modeling
window to automatically position your viewpoint 5 feet, 6 inches above
wherever you clicked. Because this is the average eye-height of an adult
human being, the result is that you are, for all intents and purposes,
standing on the spot where you clicked (see Figure 10-1). After using
Position Camera, SketchUp automatically switches to the Look Around
tool, assuming that, now that you’re where you want to be, you might
want to have a look around. I talk about Look Around in the next section
of this chapter.
You’re not stuck being five-and-a-half-feet tall forever. After you use
Position Camera, type in the height you’d rather “be” and press Enter.
Type 18” to see a golden retriever’s view of the world, or type 7’ to 
pretend you play for the L.A. Lakers. Keep in mind that the VCB (the
spot in the lower-right corner where numbers appear) displays your eye
height as a distance from the ground, and not from whatever surface
you’re “standing on.” To set your eye height to be 5 feet above a plat-
form that’s 10 feet high, you’d type in 15’.
246
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

 I want my eyes to be right here, and I want to be looking in this direc-
tion. Select Position Camera, click the mouse button while in the spot
where you want your eyes to be, drag over to the thing you want to be
looking at (you’ll see a dashed line connecting the two points), and
release the mouse button (as shown in Figure 10-2). Try this technique 
a couple of times; it takes a bit of practice to master. You’d use Position
Camera in this way if you wanted to be standing in a particular spot and
looking in a particular direction. This technique works great with
scenes, which I talk about later in this chapter.
Stepping out with the Walk tool
After you’ve used Position Camera to place yourself in your model, use the
Walk tool to move through it. (Again, find out more on this book’s companion
Web site.) To walk around, click and drag the mouse in the direction you
want to move:
 Straight up is forward.
 Straight down is backward.
 Anything to the left or right causes you to turn while you’re walking.
The farther you move your cursor, the faster you walk. Release the mouse
button to stop. If you’ve ever played video games, you’ll get used to it quickly.
If Scrabble is more your speed, it’ll take a few minutes to get used to things.

247
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

You can even use the Walk tool to walk up and down stairs and ramps. Keep
in mind that the highest step you can “climb” is 22 inches — anything higher
and you get the “bump” cursor, just like you walked into a wall. Also, if you
walk off a high surface, you’ll fall to the surface below. It’s times like these
that I wish SketchUp had cartoon sound effects. . . .
Using modifier keys in combination with the Walk tool makes SketchUp even
more like a video game:
 Hold down Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to run instead of walking. This might
be useful if you’re trying to simulate what it would be like if a werewolf
were chasing you through your model.
 Hold down Shift to move straight up (like you’re growing), straight down
(like you’re shrinking), or sideways (like a crab).
 Hold down Alt (Ô on a Mac) to disable collision detection, which allows
you to walk through walls instead of bumping into them. Burglars find
this handy for entering models without having to break any windows.
Stopping to look around
Look Around is the third tool in SketchUp that’s dedicated to exploring your
model from the inside. If using Position Camera is like swooping in to be stand-
ing in a particular spot, and Walk is like moving around while maintaining a
constant eye-height, Look Around is like turning your head while standing in
one spot. It’s pretty well named, I think; it does exactly what it says.
Using Look Around is so simple it hardly merits these steps:
1. Choose Camera➪Look Around from the menu bar to activate the Look
Around tool.
2. Click and drag around in the modeling window to turn your virtual
head.
Don’t move too fast or you’ll strain your virtual neck, though. Just kidding.
While in any of the navigation tools, you can right-click to access any of the
other navigation tools; this makes switching between them a little easier.
When you use Look Around with the field of view tool I discuss in the next
section, you get a pretty darned realistic simulation of what it would be like
to be standing in your model.
248
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Setting your field of view
Field of view is the amount of your model you’re able to see in your modeling
window at one time. Imagine your eyesight kind of like a cone, with the
pointy end pointing at your eyes and the cone getting bigger as it gets farther
away from you. Everything that falls inside the cone is visible to you, and
everything outside the cone isn’t.
If you increase the angle of the cone at the pointy end, the cone gets wider,
and you see more of what’s in front of you. If you decrease the angle, the cone
gets narrower, and you see less (see Figure 10-3).
Measured in degrees, a wide field of view means that you can see more of
your model without having to move around. The bigger the angle, the more
you can see. This comes in handy when you’re inside a SketchUp model
you’re working on, because it’s hard to work on things you can’t see.
It’s a good idea to fiddle with your field of view while walking around inside
your model. Follow these steps to do so:
1. Choose Camera➪Field of View.
Notice that the Value Control Box in the lower-right corner of your model-
ing window says Field of View and that the default value is 35 deg.
This means that you currently have a 35-degree cone of vision, which is
kind of narrow.
Figure 10-3:
The wider
your field of
view, the
more you
can see.
249
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

2. Type 60 and press Enter.
Your field of view is increased, and you now have a wider view of your
model. The trade-off is that you see more distortion at the edges of your
modeling window as more information is being displayed in the same
amount of space.
A good rule of thumb for setting your field of view is to strike a balance
between quantity and quality; a wider view always means more distortion.
For views of the outside of something I’ve built, I like to use a field of view of
35 to 45 degrees. For interior views, I use 60 or 70 degrees.
If you happen to know something about photography, you can also express
field of view in millimeters, just like you’re using a camera lens. Typing in
28mm gives you a wide-angle view, just like you’re looking through a 28-mm
lens. For people who think about field of view in these terms, this can be a lot
more intuitive than trying to imagine cones of vision.
Taking the Scenic Route
Wouldn’t it be great if you could save a particular view of your model so that
you could come back to that view whenever you wanted to? And wouldn’t it
be even greater if that saved view could also save things like styles and
shadow settings? What if you could come back to any of these saved views
by clicking a button on your screen? What if this whole paragraph were just a
series of questions?
SketchUp scenes are (you guessed it) saved views of your model. It’s proba-
bly easiest to think of scenes as cameras, except that scenes can save much
more than just camera positions. Although they don’t get a lot of space in
this book (they don’t even get their own chapter), scenes are one of the most
important features in SketchUp, for three reasons:
 Scenes can save you hours of time. It’s not always easy to get back to
exactly the right view by using Orbit, Zoom, and Pan. Sometimes a view
involves shadows, styles, sections (you’ll read about those later), and
even hidden geometry. It can be a pain to set up everything the way you
need it, every time you need it. It’s not that SketchUp’s hard — it’s just
that you have a lot of different ways to view your model. Making a scene
reduces the process of changing dozens of settings to a single click of
your mouse.
 Scenes are by far the most effective way of presenting your model.
Saving a scene for each point that you’d like to make in a presentation
allows you to focus on what you’re trying to say. Instead of fumbling
around with the navigation tools, turning on shadows, and making the
roof visible, you can click a button, and SketchUp will automatically
250
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

transition to the next scene (which you’ve already set up exactly the
way you want it). Figure 10-4 shows a set of scenes I created to present a
house I designed for my dog, Savannah.
 Scenes are the key to making animations. You make animations by cre-
ating a series of scenes and telling SketchUp to figure out the transitions
between them. The process, which is explained in later sections, is as
simple as clicking a button.
After you get used to them, you’ll find yourself using scenes all the time. Here
are some of the most common uses for scenes:
 Showing shade conditions for the same area at different times of the day
 Saving scenes for each floorplan, building section, and other important
view of your model
 Building a walk-through or flyover animation of your design
 Creating scenes to show several views of the same thing with different
options (the pointy roof or the flat one, Madam?)
 Demonstrating change over time by showing or hiding a succession of
components
Creating scenes
Let’s get one thing straight: Making a scene in SketchUp is not like taking a
snapshot of your model. If you create a scene to save a view, then do some
more modeling, and then return to that scene, your model will not go back to
the way it was when you created the scene. The camera position will be the
same and the settings will the same, but your geometry won’t be. This is a
pretty important concept, and one that makes using scenes so powerful.

Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

A scene is just a set of view settings, which means that they’re automatically
updated to reflect your changes every time you edit your model. You can
make some scenes and use them all the way through your process, from
when you start modeling to when you present your design to the president.
Or to your mother.
Creating scenes is a simple process. The basic idea is that you add a scene 
to your SketchUp file whenever you have a view you want to return to later.
You can always delete scenes, so there’s no downside to using lots of them.
Follow these steps to make a new scene (and check this book’s companion
Web site for additional help):
1. Choose Window➪Scenes to open the Scenes dialog box.
When it first opens, it doesn’t look like there’s much to the Scenes dialog
box. Expanding it by clicking the expansion toggle in the upper-right
corner reveals more options, which I cover in the next section, but don’t
worry about that right now.
2. Set up your view however you want.
Navigate around until you’re happy with your point of view. If you want,
use the Shadows and Styles dialog boxes to change the way your model
looks.
3. Click the Add button to make a new scene with your current view 
settings.
At this point, a new scene is added to your SketchUp file. If this is the
first scene you’ve created, it will be called Scene 1 and will appear in two
places (see Figure 10-5):
• As a list item in the Scenes dialog box, right underneath the 
Add button
• As a tab at the top of your modeling window, labeled Scene 1
Nothing is generated outside of SketchUp when you add a scene; it’s not like
exporting a JPEG or a TIFF. Scenes are just little bits of programming code
that “remember” the view settings in effect when they were created. Scenes
also don’t add much to your file size, so you don’t have to worry about using
too many of them.
Moving from scene to scene
Activate a scene you’ve added earlier by doing one of three things:
252
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

 Double-clicking the name of the scene in the Scenes dialog box.
 Single-clicking the tab for that scene at the top of the modeling window.
 Right-clicking any scene tab and choosing Play Animation to make
SketchUp automatically flip through your scenes. (Choose Play
Animation again to make the animation stop.)
Notice how the transition from one scene to the next is animated? You don’t
have to do anything special to make this happen; it’s something SketchUp
automatically does to make things look better (and ultimately, to make you
look better).
You can adjust the way SketchUp transitions between scenes, which is handy
for customizing your presentations. Follow these steps to access these settings:
1. Choose Window➪Model Info to open the Model Info dialog box.
2. On the left side of the Model Info dialog box, choose Animation.
The Animation settings panel in the Model Info dialog box (see Figure 10-6)
isn’t very complicated, but it can make a huge difference in the appearance
of your scene-related presentations.
Figure 10-5:
The scene
you just
added
shows up in
two places.
253
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

3. In the Scene Transitions area, set how SketchUp transitions from one
scene to another.
These settings apply to both manual (clicking on a page tab) and auto-
matic (playing an animation) scene transitions:
• Enable Scene Transitions: Deselect this check box to make
SketchUp change scenes without animating the transitions
between them. You’ll probably want to do this if your model is so
complex (or your computer is so slow) that animated transitions
don’t look good.
• Seconds: If you’ve selected the Enable Scene Transitions check
box, the number of seconds you enter here will be the amount of
time it takes SketchUp to transition from one scene to the next. If
you’re “moving the camera” very far between scenes, it’s a good
idea to bump up the transition time so that your audience doesn’t
get sick. I find three seconds to be a good compromise between
nausea and boredom.
If you’re presenting an incomplete model (perhaps you’ve thought about
the garage and the living room, but nothing in between), it can be help-
ful to turn off scene transitions. That way, your audience won’t see the
things you haven’t worked on when you click a tab to change scenes. It’s
sneaky, but effective.
4. In the Scene Delay area, set the length of time SketchUp pauses on
each slide before it moves to the next one.
If you want it to seem like you’re walking or flying, set this to 0. If you
want time to talk about each scene in your presentation, bump this up a
few seconds.

tations.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Modifying scenes after you’ve made ’em
After you create a whole bunch of scenes, it’s inevitable that you’re going 
to need to fiddle with them in some way. After all, modifying something is
almost always easier than making it all over again, and the same thing holds
true for scenes. Because your SketchUp model will change a million times,
understanding how to make changes to your existing scenes can save you a
lot of time in the long run.
Certain aspects of the scene-modification process can get a little tricky. This
is kind of surprising, given how simple the rest of working with scenes can
be, but I think it’s inevitable. You deal with a lot of complexity when working
in SketchUp, and this is just one of the places where that complexity rears its
ugly head. The upshot: Pay special attention to the section on updating
scenes, and don’t worry if it takes a little while to figure things out. It hap-
pens to the best of us.
Reordering, renaming, and removing scenes
Making simple modifications to scenes, such as reordering, renaming, and
removing them, is easy. You can accomplish each of these in two ways: You
either use the Scenes dialog box, or you right-click the scene tabs at the top
of your modeling window. Figure 10-7 is an illustration.
Figure 10-7:
You can
modify
scenes by
right-
clicking
scene tabs
or by using
the Scenes
dialog box.
255
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

To access the modification controls in the Scenes dialog box, click the arrow-
shaped expansion button in the upper-right corner.
Here’s how to reorder, rename, or remove scenes:
 Reordering scenes: You can change the order in which scenes play in a
slide show. If you’re using scenes, you’ll need to do this often — trust
me. Use one of the following methods:
• Right-click the tab of the scene you want to move (in the modeling
window) and choose Move Right or Move Left.
• In the expanded Scenes dialog box, click the name of the scene you
want to move to select it, and then click the up or down arrows to
the right of the list to change the scene’s position in the scene order.
 Renaming scenes: It’s a good idea to give your scenes meaningful
names: “Living Room,” “Top View,” and “Shadows at 5:00 p.m.” are
descriptive enough to be useful. “Scene 14,” I find, lacks a certain je ne
sais quoi. Use one of the following methods:
• Right-click the scene tab and choose Rename.
• In the Scenes dialog box, select the scene you want to rename and
type something into the Name field below the list. If you’re feeling
really organized, go ahead and give it a description, too — more
information never hurts.
 Removing scenes: If you don’t need a scene anymore, feel free to delete
it. However, if you have a scene that you don’t want to appear in slide
shows, you don’t have to get rid of it. Use one of the following methods
to remove a scene:
• Right-click the scene tab and choose Delete to get rid of it 
permanently.
• In the Scenes dialog box, select the scene you want to ax and click
the Delete button.
To exclude a scene from slide shows without getting rid of it, select its
name in the list and deselect the Include in Animation check box.
256
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Making walk-throughs
A really great way to use scenes is to pretend
you’re walking or flying through your model. By
setting up your scenes sequentially, you can give
a seamless tour without having to mess around
with the navigation tools. This is especially handy
when you need to be able to “walk and talk” at
the same time.
Here are some tips that can help you to simu-
late a person walking or flying through your
model with scenes:

257
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
 Adjust your field of view. For interior ani-
mations, make your camera “see” a wider
area by setting your field of view to 60
degrees. I like to set my field of view
between 30 and 45 degrees for exterior
views, but there’s no hard and fast rule. I talk
about how to do this in the section “Setting
your field of view,” earlier in this chapter.
 Make sure that your scenes aren’t too far
apart. Instead of racing through a room like
it’s on fire, don’t be afraid to add more
scenes. Your audience will thank you by not
throwing up on your conference table.
 Add scenes at equal distance intervals.
Because SketchUp only lets you control the
scene transition timing for all your scenes at
once, it’s best to make sure that your scenes
are set up about the same distance apart. If
you don’t, your walk-through animations will
be jerky and strange, like my dancing.
 Don’t forget the animation settings in the
Model Info dialog box. Set the scene delay
to 0 seconds so that your animation doesn’t
pause at every scene. For a normal walking
speed, set your scene transitions so that
you’re moving about 5 feet per second. If
your scenes are about 20 feet apart, set your
scene transition time to 4 seconds. This
gives your audience time to look around and
notice things. For flying animations, pick a
scene transition time that looks good.
 Slide around corners. When you’re setting
up a walking animation, you have an easy,
reliable way to turn corners without seem-
ing too robotic. The method is illustrated in
the following figure. Basically, the trick is to
add a scene just short of where you want to
turn — in this case, a few feet ahead of the
doorway. The key is to angle your view into
the turn slightly. You should set up your next
scene just past the turn, close to the inside
and facing the new view. This technique
makes it seem like you’re turning corners
naturally.

Updating scenes
Okay. Turn off the television. Send the kids outside to play. Do whatever you
need to do to be able to concentrate, because the process of updating scenes
isn’t altogether straightforward. I’ll do my best to explain it.
Basically, a scene is just a collection of saved viewing properties. Each of
these properties has something to do with how your model looks. A scene
can save one, some, or all of the following properties, depending on what 
you need to do:
 Camera location: Camera location properties include the position of the
camera, or viewpoint, and the field of view. I discuss field of view earlier
in this chapter.
 Hidden geometry: Hidden geometry properties are really just one thing:
what elements are hidden and what elements aren’t. These properties
keep track of the visibility of the lines, faces, groups, components, and
axes in your model.
 Visible layers: Visible layer properties keep track of the visibility of
layers in your model.
 Active section planes: Active section plane properties include the visi-
bility of section planes and whether they are active. I talk about sections
in the last part of this chapter.
 Style and fog: Style and fog properties are all the settings in the Styles
and Fog dialog boxes, and there are a lot of them.
 Shadow settings: Shadow settings properties include whether shadows
are turned on and the time and date for which the shadows are set. They
also include all the other settings in the Shadow Settings dialog box.
 Axes locations: Axes location properties are very specific. They keep
track of the visibility of the main SketchUp red, green, and blue axes in
your modeling window. Because you’ll often want to hide the axes when
you’re giving a presentation, these elements get their own properties.
Updating all the scene properties at once
The simplest way to modify a scene is to not worry about individual proper-
ties. If all you want to do is update a scene after you’ve made an adjustment
to the appearance of your model, you’re in luck. Follow these steps:
1. Go to the scene you want to update by clicking its tab at the top of the
modeling window.
258
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

2. Make whatever styles, shadows, camera, or other display changes you
want to make to your model.
3. Right-click the current scene tab and choose Update.
Be careful not to accidentally double-click the tab or you’ll reactivate the
scene and lose all the changes you made. The old scene properties are
replaced by the new ones, and you’re home free.
After you update a scene, you can’t use Undo to revert things back to the way
they were. I suggest saving your SketchUp file right before updating a scene,
and choosing File➪Revert from the File menu if you don’t like how things
turn out.
Updating scene properties selectively
Here’s where things get complicated. At times in your SketchUp life, you’ll
want to update a scene without updating all its properties.
Updating scenes selectively involves making changes that you won’t be able
to see immediately; whenever you do this, you have the potential for disaster
to strike. It’s a good idea to make a copy of your SketchUp file before updat-
ing more than one scene at a time, just in case something awful happens.
Maybe you’ve used scenes to create a tour of the sunroom you’re designing
for a client, and you want to change the shadow settings to make your 
model look brighter. You have 30 scenes in your presentation, and your 
meeting’s in 5 minutes. You don’t have time to change and update all 30
scenes one at a time. What to do? Follow these steps (and have a look at
Figure 10-8):
Figure 10-8:
Updating
only certain
scene
properties is
a little more
involved.
259
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

1. Adjust the shadow settings to where you’d like them to be for all the
scenes you’d like to update.
While this example deals with shadows, this same method applies to any
scene properties changes you’d like to make.
2. In the Scenes dialog box, select all the scenes you’d like to update.
Hold down Shift to select more than one scene at a time.
3. Click the Update button in the Scenes dialog box.
A Properties to Update dialog box appears.
4. Select the Shadow Settings check box and click the Update button.
If all you want to update are the shadow settings, make sure that only
that check box is selected. More generally, you would select the check
box next to each of the properties you want to update. All the selected
scenes are updated with those new properties, and all the properties left
deselected remain unchanged.
Mastering the Sectional Approach
Software like SketchUp has a funny way of providing moments of perfect sim-
plicity, moments when you sit back, scratch your head, and think to yourself,
“That’s it? That’s all there is to it?”
Sections in SketchUp offer one of those moments. To put it simply, sections
are objects that let you cut away parts of your model to look inside. You
place them wherever you need them, use them to create views you wouldn’t
otherwise be able to get, and then delete them when you’re done. When you
move a section plane, you get instant feedback; the “cut” view of your model
moves, too. If you want to get fancy, you can embed them in scenes and even
use them in animations. Sections are the icing on the SketchUp cake: easy to
use, incredibly important, and impressive as all get out.
People use sections for all kinds of things:
 Creating standard orthographic views (like plans and sections) of 
buildings and other objects
 Making cutaway views of complex models to make them easier to 
understand
 Working on the interiors of buildings without having to move or hide
geometry
 Generating sectional animations with scenes
260
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Cutting plans and sections
The most common use for sections is to create straight-on, cut-through views
of your model. These are some of the views that often include dimensions, and
are typical of the kinds of drawings that architects make to design and explain
space. They’re useful because they’re easy to read and you can take measure-
ments from them (if they’re printed to scale), and they provide information
that no other drawing type can. The following terms (which are illustrated in
Figure 10-9) can help you create different views of your model more easily:
 Plan: A planimetric view, or plan, is a top-down, two-dimensional, non-
perspectival view of an object or space. Put simply, it’s every drawing of
a house floorplan you’ve ever seen. You generate a plan by cutting an
imaginary horizontal slice through your model. Everything below the
slice is visible, and everything above it isn’t.
 Section: Not to be confused with sections (the SketchUp feature about
which this section of the book is written), a sectional view, or section, is
a from-the-side, two-dimensional, nonperspectival view of an object or
space. You would make a section by cutting an imaginary vertical slice
through your model. Just like in a plan view, everything on one side of
the slice is visible, and everything on the other side is hidden.
You cut plans and sections by adding section planes to your model. These
are a little abstract, because nothing like them exists in real life. In SketchUp,
section planes are objects that affect the visibility of certain parts of your
model. When a section plane is active, everything in front of it is visible and
everything behind is hidden. Everywhere your model is “cut” by a section
plane, a slightly thicker “section cut” line appears.
If you’re using Windows, now would be a good time to open the Sections tool-
bar by choosing View➪Toolbars➪Sections. If you’re on a Mac, the Section
Plane tool is in the Large Tool Set, which you can activate by choosing
View➪Tool Palettes➪Large Tool Set in the menu bar. On both platforms,
Section Plane looks like a white circle with letters and numbers in it.
Figure 10-9:
A plan is a
horizontal
cut, while a
section is a
vertical one.
261
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

To add a section plane, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Section Plane to activate the Section Plane tool.
You can also activate Section Plane by choosing its icon from the Large
Tool Set (Mac) or the Sections toolbar (Windows), if you have it open.
2. Move the Section Plane tool around your model.
Notice how the orientation of the Section Plane cursor (which is quite
large) changes to be coplanar to whatever surface you’re hovering over.
Check out Figure 10-10 to see this in action.
3. When you’ve figured out where you want it, click once to add a sec-
tion plane.
To create a plan view, add a horizontal section plane by clicking a hori-
zontal plane like a floor. For a sectional view, add a vertical section plane
by clicking a wall or other vertical surface. You can, of course, add sec-
tion planes wherever you want; they don’t have to be aligned to horizon-
tal or vertical planes. Figure 10-11 shows a section plane added to a
model of a house.
4. Choose the Move tool.
262
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Cutting like an architect
In architecture, the convention is to “cut” plans
at a height of 48 inches, meaning that the imagi-
nary horizontal slice is made 4 feet above the
floor surface. This ensures that doors and most
windows are shown cut through by the slice,
while counters, tables, and other furniture are
below it, and thus are fully visible. You can see
what I mean in Figure 10-9. These things are
important when you’re trying to explain a space
to someone. After all, architectural drawings are
two-dimensional abstractions of three-dimen-
sional space, and every little bit of clarity helps.
When it comes to architectural sections (as
opposed to sections, the SketchUp feature),
there’s no convention for where to cut them, but
you should follow a couple of rules:
 Never cut through columns. If you show a
column in section, it looks like a wall. This is
bad, because sections are supposed to show
the degree to which a space is open or
closed. You can walk around a column, but
you can’t walk through a wall (at least I can’t).
 Try your best to cut through stairs, eleva-
tors, and other “vertical circulation.”
Showing how people move up and down
through your building makes your drawings
a lot more readable, not to mention interest-
ing. Figure 10-9 shows what I’m getting at.

263
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

5. Move the section plane you just added by clicking it once to pick it up
and again to drop it.
You can only slide your section plane back and forth in two directions;
SketchUp only allows section planes to move perpendicular to their cut-
ting planes. When you’re deciding where to locate your cut, the nearby
sidebar, “Cutting like an architect,” offers helpful pointers.
After you’ve added a section plane and moved it to the desired location,
you can rotate and even copy it, just like any other object in your model.
It will never affect your geometry — just the way you view it.
6. If you need to rotate your section plane, select it and use the Rotate
tool (which you can read more about in Chapter 6).
Why rotate a section plane? In certain circumstances, rotating a section
plane (instead of creating a brand new one) can help to explain a complex
interior space. Showing a plan view becoming a sectional one is a power-
ful way to explain architectural drawings to an audience that doesn’t
understand them.
7. To make a new section plane by copying an existing one, use the
Move or Rotate tool to do it the same way you would make a copy 
of any other SketchUp object.
Chapter 2 explains these basic actions in detail.
Copying section planes is a great way to space them a known distance
apart; this can be trickier if you use the Section Plane tool to keep
adding new ones, instead.
Figure 10-12 shows moving, rotating, and copying a section plane.
When the section plane you’ve added is in position, you’re ready to control
how it impacts visibility in a number of other ways. See the following sections
for details.
Controlling individual section planes
You can control the way section planes behave by right-clicking them to
bring up a context menu that looks like the one shown in Figure 10-13. I show
examples of what the following options do in the same illustration:
Figure 10-12:
Moving,
rotating, and
copying a
section

264
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

 Reverse: This option flips the “direction” of the section plane, hiding
everything that was previously visible, and revealing everything that
used to be “behind” the cut. Use this when you need to see inside the
rest of your model.
 Active Cut: Although you can have multiple section planes in your
model, only one of them can be “active” at a time. The “active cut” is 
the section plane that is actually cutting through your model; others 
are considered “inactive.” If you have more than one section plane, 
use Active Cut to tell SketchUp which one should be active.
You can have more than one active section plane in your model at a
time, but doing so requires that you nest, or embed, each section plane
in a separate group or component. It’s possible to achieve some pretty
spiffy effects with this technique, but I’m afraid I don’t have room to
include more than this mention of it in this book. You can read all about
groups and components in Chapter 5.
 Align View: When you choose Align View, your view changes so that
you’re looking straight on at the section plane. You can use this option
to produce views like the ones that I describe in the section “Getting 
different sectional views,” later in this chapter.
 Create Group from Slice: This option doesn’t have much to do with the
other choices in this context menu; it’s really a modeling tool. You can
use this to do exactly what it says: create a group from the active slice,
or section plane. I don’t use this very often, but it comes in handy for
creating filled-in section cuts for final presentations.
Figure 10-13:
Right-

265
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

Setting section-plane visibility
If you want to control the visibility of all your section planes at once, a couple
of menu options can help. You use both of these toggles in combination to
control how section cuts appear in your model. These two options, shown on
the View menu, are illustrated in Figure 10-14:
 Section Planes: This choice toggles the visibility of section-plane
objects without affecting the section cuts they produce. More simply,
deselecting Section Planes hides all the section planes in your model,
but doesn’t turn off the section cut effect, as shown in the middle image
in Figure 10-14. This is how you’ll probably want to show most of your
sectional views, so this is a pretty important toggle.
 Section Cut: Deselecting this option toggles the section cut effect on and
off without affecting the visibility of the section-plane objects in your
model. This choice is sort of the opposite of Section Planes, in the previ-
ous point, but it’s every bit as important.
Getting different sectional views
Using section planes, you can get a couple of useful and impressive views of
your model without much trouble. The second builds on the first, and both
are shown in Figure 10-15. A section perspective (left) is a special kind of way
to view a three-dimensional space. The second type, an orthographic view
(right), is straight on and doesn’t use perspective.
Making a section perspective
If you imagine cutting a building in half and then looking at the cut surface
straight on while looking inside, you have a section perspective. The section
part of the term refers to the fact that the building has been cut away. The
perspective part indicates that objects seen inside the space appear to get
smaller as they get farther away.

266
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

Section perspectives are a great (not to mention incredibly cool) way of
showing interior space in a way that’s understandable to most people. To
create a section perspective using the Section Plane tool in SketchUp, follow
these steps (and check out this book’s companion Web site for additional
help; see the Introduction for details):
1. Select the section plane you’d like to use to make a section perspective
by clicking it with the Select tool.
When it’s selected, your section plane turns blue, assuming that you
haven’t changed any of the default colors in the Styles dialog box.
2. If the selected section plane isn’t active, right-click and choose Active
Cut from the context menu.
Active section planes cut through their surrounding geometry. If your
section plane is visible but isn’t cutting through anything, it isn’t active.
3. Right-click the selected section plane and choose Align View from the
context menu.
This aligns your view so that it’s straight on (perpendicular) to your 
section plane.
4. If you can’t see your model properly, choose Camera➪Zoom Extents.
This zooms your view so that you can see your whole model in the 
modeling window.
Generating an orthographic section
Ever seen a technical drawing that included top, front, rear, and side views 
of the same object? Chances are that was an orthographic projection, which 
is a common way for three-dimensional objects to be drawn so that they can
be built.
Figure 10-15:
Turn
Perspective
on for a
section
perspective;
choose
Parallel
Projection to
produce an
orthographic
view.
267
Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp

Producing an orthographic section of your model is pretty easy; it’s only one
extra step beyond making a section perspective. Here’s how to do it:
1. Follow Steps 1–3 in the preceding section, as if you’re making a sec-
tion perspective.
2. Choose Camera➪Parallel Projection.
This switches off Perspective, turning your view into a true orthographic
representation of your model. If you printed it at a specific scale, you
could take measurements from the printout.
To print a plan or section view of your model at a particular scale, have a
look at Chapter 12, where I explain the whole process.
Creating section animations with scenes
This is probably one of the most useful and impressive things you can do
with this software, but some people who have been using SketchUp for years
don’t know about it. The basic idea is that you can use scenes to create ani-
mations where your section planes move inside your model. Here are a few
reasons you might want to use this technique:
 If you have a building with several levels, you can create an animated
presentation that shows a cutaway plan view of each level.
 Using an animated section plane to “get inside” your model is a much
classier transition than simply hiding certain parts of it.
 When you need to show the relationship between the plan and section
views for a project, using an animated section plane helps to explain the
concept of different architectural views to 3D beginners.
Follow these steps to create a basic section animation. A simple example is
illustrated in Figure 10-16 (and check out this book’s companion Web site for
additional help):

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 

1. Add a section plane to your model.
I give a complete explanation of how to create section planes in the 
section “Cutting plans and sections,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Add a scene to your model.
Check out the section “Creating scenes,” earlier in this chapter, for a
complete rundown on adding scenes.
3. Add another section plane to your model.
You can add another section plane in one of two ways:
• Use the Section Plane tool to create a brand new one. This is
probably the easiest option, and it’s the one I recommend if you’re
just starting out.
• Use the Move tool to copy an existing section plane. I talk about
copying section planes in the section “Cutting plans and sections,”
earlier in this chapter.
Make sure that your new section plane is active; if it is, it’ll be cutting
through your model. If it isn’t, right-click the section plane and choose
Active Cut from the context menu.
4. Add another scene to your model.
This new scene “remembers” which is the active section plane.
5. Click through the scenes you added to view your animation.
You should see an animated section cut as SketchUp transitions from
one scene to the next. If you don’t, make sure that you have scene transi-
tions enabled. You can verify this by choosing Window➪Model Info and
then choosing the Animations panel in the Model Info dialog box. The
Scene Transitions check box should be selected.
If you don’t like being able to see the section-plane objects (the boxy things
with arrows on their corners) in your animation, switch them off by deselect-
ing Section Planes on the View menu. You should still be able to see your sec-
tion cuts, but you won’t see any ugly gray rectangles flying around.
The hardest thing to remember about using scenes and section planes to
make section animations is this: You need a separate section plane for each
scene that you create. That is to say, SketchUp animates the transition from
one active section plane to another active section plane. If all you do is move
the same section plane to another spot and add a scene, this technique won’t
work. Believe it or not, it took me two years to figure this out, so don’t feel
dense if you need to come back and read this section a couple of times.

You’ve Made

In this part . . .
I
suppose for some people in the world, 3D modeling is
an intensely private endeavor; they build something in
SketchUp, they burn the SKP file to a disk, and then they
hide the disk in the crawlspace under their house.
If you’re not one of these people, you’re probably looking
forward to doing something with the models you make —
printing them, making animations, and sending them 
to other software programs. After all, for most folks,
SketchUp is just the beginning of a process that includes
lots of other steps.
The chapters in this part describe all the different
things you can do with your models after you build them.
Chapter 11 talks about using SketchUp with Google Earth.
Chapter 12 is about printing, and Chapters 13 and 14
describe the process of exporting images and animations.
Chapter 15 is a quick overview of LayOut, the brand-new
presentation document design tool that comes with
SketchUp 6 Pro.

I
f you’ve ever used Google Earth, you know what it’s like to look up from
your computer and realize you just have no idea what time it is. There is
no better way to spend several hours than to travel to Paris, Cairo, and the
South Pole while checking out the peak of Mount Everest and looking at your
old elementary school along the way. I love Google Earth because it does
what Star Trek said computers are supposed to let us do — forget we’re using
technology and explore information in a way we never could before.
What if you could see 3D models of buildings and other man-made structures
in Google Earth the same way that you can see aerial images and 3D topogra-
phy? You can. What if you could build your own models, in SketchUp, and see
them in Google Earth? You can do that, too. What if you could allow everyone
who uses Google Earth — there are hundreds of millions of them — to see
your models in their copies of Google Earth, no matter where they are? Now
you’re getting the idea. . . .
In this chapter, I talk about making SketchUp models that you and (if you
want) anyone else can see on Google Earth. I also talk about the Google 3D
Warehouse: a great big, online repository of free 3D models that anyone
(including you) can contribute to or borrow from. It’s a big, friendly 3D world
out there, and this chapter is your Getting Started guide.

Getting the Big (3D) Picture
Okay. So there’s SketchUp, which (I have to assume) you’re pretty familiar with
by now. Then there’s Google Earth, which you’ve probably seen and which
you probably think is pretty neat. Finally, there’s the 3D Warehouse, which you
probably don’t know anything about — don’t worry about that. Here’s the
“lay of the land” when it comes to the relationship among these three things
and what they’re supposed to do:
 Google SketchUp: Because SketchUp is especially good for architecture,
you can use it to make buildings that you can look at in Google Earth.
If you want, you can also upload (send) what you make to the 3D
Warehouse, where anyone who finds it can download (borrow) your
model and use it in his or her own copy of SketchUp.
 Google Earth (http://earth.google.com): Earth is a software pro-
gram that lets you explore the world by “flying” around, zooming in on
things that interest you. The more you zoom, the better the detail gets;
in some places, you can see things as small as coffee cups. The imagery
in Google Earth is anywhere from a couple of weeks to 4 years old, but it
gets updated all the time. If you want, you can build models in SketchUp
and view them in Google Earth. You can also see models that other
people have made. Eventually, Google Earth will include entire 3D cities,
built in SketchUp by people all over the world.
 Google 3D Warehouse (http://sketchup.google.com/
3dwarehouse): The 3D Warehouse is a huge collection of 3D models
that lives on Google’s servers. The models all come from people just
like you and me; anyone can contribute models, and anyone can use
them in their own SketchUp projects. Some of the best models in the
3D Warehouse are used in a special layer where anyone can see them
while they’re flying around in Google Earth.
If you’re the kind of person who likes diagrams (I know I am), Figure 11-1
might help; it shows the SketchUp/Earth/3D Warehouse workflow in a non-
paragraphish way.
Taking the Ten-Minute 
Tour of Google Earth
Google Earth is a pretty deep piece of software, not because it’s hard to use
(it’s not) but because you can use it to do an awful lot. I’m not even going to
try to explain it in this section; this is the “zooming past it in a speeding car”
tour that should be enough to get you started.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

Getting Google Earth
Here’s a piece of good news for you: Just like Google SketchUp, the basic ver-
sion of Google Earth is free. Why? My mother always told me not to look a gift
horse in the mouth, and Google Earth is the Secretariat of gift horses. All that
matters to me is that people with a computer that can run SketchUp can also
run Google Earth, and they don’t have to pay for it. Here are some more
things you need to know:
 You get Google Earth by downloading it. Just go to http://earth.
google.com, click the Downloads link on the left, select your operating
system, and then click the big Download button. While you’re there,
check out some of the other features of the site. You should be able
to find answers to any other questions you have, as well as links to

online help, user communities, and more. You can even find out about
what you get in the fancier versions of Google Earth, if that’s what floats
your boat.
 You need a fast Internet connection. The magic of Google Earth is its
ability to show you detailed imagery of the whole world — that’s lots and
lots of data that Google keeps on its servers until you “request” it by
flying somewhere and zooming in. The faster your Internet connection,
the faster you can stream imagery, 3D buildings, and topography into
your copy of Google Earth. As you can imagine, Google Earth isn’t worth
a darn if you’re not online.
 You should clear your schedule. If this is the first time you’ve used
Google Earth, don’t plan to do much of anything else for the next few
hours. It’s that much fun — and that addictive. If any geography nuts
reside in your household, you might need to buy another computer.
Getting your first dose
Google Earth can do a bunch of stuff, but the following sections describe the
first three things you should do with the software; have a look at Figure 11-2
for a view of the Google Earth user interface.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

Flying around
Check out the upper-right corner of the screen; you’ll find the navigation con-
trols for Google Earth conveniently grouped together. Notice how they
appear when you hover over them? Go ahead and play around to figure out
what they do. Here’s some help:
 Zoom: Move this slider back and forth to zoom in and out on whatever’s
in the center of your screen. You can also use the scroll wheel on your
mouse to zoom, just like you do in SketchUp.
 Pan: You can move around by clicking the arrow buttons, but the easier
way is to use your mouse. Just click and drag to “spin” the world in
whatever direction you want.
 Rotate: Turn the wheel to spin yourself around without moving. This works
a lot like the Look Around tool in SketchUp. Click the N button to reorient
the world so that north is up.
 Tilt: Google Earth is 3D! Move the Tilt slider back and forth to tilt your
view. If you’re looking at an area with mountains, they should look like a
3D image (if they don’t, make sure that the Topography layer is enabled
in the lower-left corner). You can also tilt by holding down your scroll
wheel button, the same way you do to Orbit in SketchUp. (See Chapter 2
for more on orbiting.)
Going someplace specific
See the blank field in the upper-left corner that says “Fly To”? Go ahead and
type in an address anywhere in the world, and Google Earth will fly you
directly there. It works better for some places than others, but nobody’s per-
fect. Here are some tips:
 Use the right format. If you’re entering an address in the United States
or Canada, use this format: Street Number Street Name, Zip (Postal)
Code. Here’s an example: 1234 Cherry Blvd, 64254. If it doesn’t work the
first time, try a few variations.
 Type in landmarks. Try typing Eiffel Tower or Statue of Liberty. I have
no idea how Google does this, but it just seems to work.
 Get directions. Click the Directions tab (also in the upper-left corner of
the screen), and then enter Origin and Destination addresses to see a list
of driving directions along with a colored path on the ground.
Making some placemarks
You can stick “pins” into Google Earth to mark locations you’d like to come
back to later; they’re called placemarks. Follow these steps to create one
yourself:
1. Fly to where you want to create a placemark.
277
Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse

2. Click the Create Placemark button at the top of the screen.
3. Move your placemark (it looks like a thumbtack) to exactly where you
want it (on top of your house, for instance).
4. Give your placemark a name in the Edit Placemark dialog box.
5. Click the OK button.
Your new placemark should show up in the Places section on the left of your
screen. No matter where you are in the world, double-clicking the name of
your placemark in the Places list will fly you right there.
Building Models for Google Earth
Google Earth is fun and all, but you’re interested in SketchUp, right? What
you want to do is build a model of a building (maybe your house) and see it
in Google Earth. After you’ve done that, you can e-mail the model to your
friends (or clients) so that they can see it in Google Earth, too. And if you’re
especially proud of what you make, you can upload it to the 3D Warehouse so
that the whole world can see it.
First things first. In this section, I talk about the basic procedure for making
a model in SketchUp and viewing it in Google Earth. I also provide some tips
for making buildings that are optimized for Earth; big models plus Google
Earth can equal sluggish (like molasses in January) performance, and no one
wants that.
Understanding the process
Very simply, building SketchUp models for Google Earth involves the follow-
ing steps:
1. Choosing a site in Google Earth
2. Importing the view into SketchUp
3. Building a model using the imported view as a guide
4. Exporting your model to Google Earth
Simple, huh? Figure 11-3 is a handy diagram for the visually oriented
among us.
278
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

Finding a site and bringing 
it into SketchUp
Follow these steps to import a building site into SketchUp from Google Earth:
1. Launch Google Earth.
Make sure that you’re online when you launch Earth; if you aren’t, you
won’t be able to see much of anything.
2. In Google Earth, navigate to the area where you want to place a
model.
It doesn’t really matter how you get where you’re going; the important
thing is to fill your Google Earth window with the area that you want to
import into SketchUp. Take a look at Figure 11-4 to see what I mean.

Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse

3. Launch SketchUp and open a new file.
SketchUp opens a new file every time you launch it, so this step is
pretty easy.
4. Choose Tools➪Google Earth➪Get Current View from the menu bar.
When you do this, SketchUp imports a “snapshot” of whatever is visible
in your Google Earth window when you choose Get Current View.
You can also access the Google Earth commands by opening the Google
Earth toolbar; choose View➪Toolbars➪Google Earth to have at ’em.
If you want to import another snapshot from Google Earth into SketchUp, you
can. SketchUp automatically tiles together all the snapshots you “take” (by
choosing Get Current View) in your modeling window to form a kind of patch-
work. This is super-handy if you find that you didn’t get everything you
needed the first time.
You need to wait until your Google Earth view is at least 95 percent loaded
before you can capture a snapshot in SketchUp (patience is a virtue, after all).
Just watch the little “Streaming” readout at the bottom of your Google Earth
window to know when you’ve waited long enough.
Modeling on a Google Earth snapshot
Now that you’ve imported a snapshot from Google Earth, you can build a
model on it. To do this, just go about your SketchUp business the way you
always do — everything about SketchUp stays exactly the same, even after
you import a snapshot.
To follow the steps in this section, you need to know how to do some basics,
such as how to use the Line tool to trace a building’s footprint, work with the
drawing axes, and more. I cover these basics in detail in Chapter 2.
Building on top of a snapshot 101
Here are the basic steps for building a model on top of your Google Earth
snapshot:
1. Make sure that you have a flat view of your terrain.
Choose Tools➪Google Earth➪Toggle Terrain a couple of times to figure
out which is the flat view, and then start from there.
2. Trace the footprint of the building you want to model on the imported
black-and-white image (see image A in Figure 11-5).
Of course, you’re more than welcome to model something that doesn’t
exist yet; if that’s the case, feel free to draw anything you like.
280
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

If the building you’re trying to make doesn’t line up perfectly with the
colored axes, using the Line and Rectangle tools can be tricky. To fix this
problem, reposition your main drawing axes by choosing Tools➪Axes.
Click once to set your origin, again to establish the direction of your red
axis (parallel to one of the edges in your photo), and a third time to
establish your green axis. I like to set my origin at the corner of the
building I’m trying to make; I think it makes things easier.
3. Use Push/Pull to extrude the footprint to the correct height (see image
B in Figure 11-5).
4. Keep modeling until you’re satisfied with what you have.
5. Flip to a 3D view of your terrain, and then move your building up or
down until it’s sitting properly (see Figure 11-6).
Select everything you want to move, and then use the Move tool to
move it up or down. You can press the up- or down-arrow key to con-
strain your move to the blue axis if you want.
If you have a SketchUp model you’ve already built that you’d like to
export to Google Earth, just import it into the same file as your snapshot.
Choose File➪Import from the menu bar, find it on your computer, and
bring it on in.

Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse

Letting SketchUp take care of the details
My favorite part of the whole Google Earth import process is how much time
it saves. There’s a whole bunch of information already in Google Earth, and
SketchUp is smart enough to take advantage of it:
 SketchUp geolocates your position automatically. This means that it
sets your latitude and longitude to match Google Earth, and orients your
snapshot in the right cardinal direction. This means that any shadow
studies you do with the Shadows feature will automatically be accurate
for wherever you were in Google Earth when you took your snapshot.
 Everything’s already the right size. Perhaps you take a snapshot of a
football field in Google Earth; when you measure that football field in
SketchUp, it will be exactly 100 yards long. That’s because SketchUp
scales your snapshot to the correct size as part of the import process.
 There’s more to snapshots than meets the eye. The snapshot that
SketchUp imports from Google Earth is more than just a black-and-white
aerial photo — it also includes a chunk of topography called terrain.
The terrain is flat when you first import it because it’s easier to build
on that way, but you can toggle between flat and 3D (not flat) views by
choosing Tools➪Google Earth➪Toggle Terrain. Don’t fret if you don’t see
any difference when you flip between the views — you probably just
chose a flat site. Figure 11-7 shows the same snapshot with terrain tog-
gled off (top) and on (bottom).
Make sure your building pokes through the ground

Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse

Thinking big by thinking small
When it comes to modeling for Google Earth, lightness is next to godliness.
By light, I mean the file size of your model, and by file size, I mean the number
of faces and textures you use to build it. The more complicated your model,
the slower Google Earth will run, and the more likely you’ll be to throw your
computer through a window in frustration. Now more than ever, think about
how you can do the most with the least — geometry, that is. Follow these tips:
 Get rid of extra geometry. Lots of times when you’re modeling, you end
up with edges (and even faces) that don’t have a purpose. Figure 11-8
shows a prime example of the kinds of little edges you can erase to dras-
tically reduce the number of faces in your model.
 Reduce the number of sides in your extruded arcs and circles.
SketchUp’s default number of sides for circles is 24. This means that
every time you use Push/Pull to extrude a circle into a cylinder, you
end up with 25 faces: 24 around the sides and the original one on top.
Instead of using circles with 24 sides, reduce the number of sides by
typing a number followed by the letter s and pressing Enter right after
you draw a circle. For example, to draw a 10-sided circle (plenty for
Google Earth), follow these steps:
Figure 11-8:
Take a
couple of
minutes to
erase extra
edges and
faces — it
pays off.
284
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

1. Draw a circle with the Circle tool.
2. Type 10s (this should appear in the lower-right corner of your
modeling window), and then press Enter.
The same thing goes for arcs; you change the number of sides in them in
exactly the same way. I like to use 10-sided circles and 4-sided arcs when
I’m modeling for Google Earth. Figure 11-9 shows the same pipe con-
structed by using Follow Me on two circles: one with 24 sides and one
with only 10. Note the difference in the number of faces in each version.
 When you can, use photo detail instead of geometry. This really only
applies if you’re mapping photos (or using PhotoMatch) on the model
you’re making for Google Earth. If you are, it’s a good idea to make as
basic a model as you can, and let the detail in the photo “do the talking.”
Resist the temptation to model windows and doors. Figure 11-10 shows
a model I took from the 3D Warehouse that the folks at Google built.
The view on the left shows it with photo textures visible; the version
on the right is just the simple geometry. Surprised? You can read all
about how to use photos to add detail to your models in Chapter 7.

Viewing your model in Google Earth
After you’ve made a model on top of a snapshot, it’s a simple operation to
send it over to your copy of Google Earth. And after you’ve done that, you
can save it as a Google Earth KMZ file and e-mail it to all your friends. If you’re
modeling for clients instead of friends, you can send it to them, too.
Exporting from SketchUp to Google Earth
This process is so simple you could probably figure it out while you’re talking
on the phone. Follow these steps to send your model from SketchUp to
Google Earth on your computer:
1. Choose Tools➪Google Earth➪Place Model.
Doing this sends everything in your modeling window (with the excep-
tion of the Google Earth snapshot) over to Google Earth. Your computer
should automatically switch you over to Google Earth and fly you in so
that you’re looking at your model (see Figure 11-11).
2. If you decide you want to make changes to your model, go back to
SketchUp, make your changes, and then choose Place Model again.
Google Earth pops up a dialog box that asks you whether you want to
overwrite the old version of the model you placed the first time.
3. Click the Yes button if you’re sure that’s what you want to do.
4. Continue to go back and forth between SketchUp and Google Earth
until your model looks exactly the way you want it to.

Saving your model as a Google Earth KMZ file
You can save your SketchUp model as a Google Earth KMZ file that you can
send to anyone. When someone opens the KMZ file, Google Earth opens on his
computer (if he has Google Earth), and he is “flown in” to look at the model you
made. Try sending directions to your next party this way; your friends will
think you’re related to Albert Einstein. Follow these steps to save your model:
1. In Google Earth, select your model by clicking it in the My Places list
on the left of the screen.
Unless you’ve renamed it yourself, your model will be called
SUPreview1. Click it once to select it.
2. Choose File➪Save➪Save Place As.
The Save File dialog box opens.
3. Give your file a name and figure out where to put it on your hard drive.
4. Click the Save button to save your model as a KMZ file.

Becoming a SketchUp All-Star 
with the 3D Warehouse
If you’ve ever wondered where Google gets most of the realistic buildings
that show up by default on the 3D Buildings layer in Google Earth, you should
go take a look in the mirror. That’s right: Google’s strategy for building the
whole man-made world in 3D is to rely on SketchUp users everywhere to
model their local context. That’s the biggest reason that SketchUp is a free
program, and it’s a pretty revolutionary way to think about tackling a massive
project: millions of people working together to provide accurate, current
information that can be used by anyone.
Getting to the Google 3D Warehouse
So how can you get your models into Google Earth so that everyone can see
them? To do that, you need to upload your work into the 3D Warehouse.
Residing wherever Google’s other jillions of bits of data do, the 3D Warehouse
is a huge collection of 3D models that is searchable and, most importantly,
free for everyone to use.
The 3D Warehouse is basically a Web site; it exists online, and you need an
Internet connection to access it. You can get there in two different ways:
 From SketchUp: Choose File➪3D Warehouse➪Get Models; when you do,
a mini Web browser opens right in front of your modeling window. Voilà!
 From the Web: Browse to http://sketchup.google.com/
3dwarehouse. This is a great way to hunt for 3D models without
having to open SketchUp first.
288
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 
Minding your modeling manners
People sometimes ask me if anyone at Google
is paying attention to what gets uploaded to the
3D Warehouse. The answer to that question is a
little bit complicated. For instance, nobody at
Google minds if you refer to a Web site or enter
tags that don’t have anything to do with the model
you upload — stuff like that is entirely up to you.
On the other hand, it’s very frowned upon to go
anywhere near the usual taboo subjects for
public, G-rated Web sites: pornography and/or
foul language will sound an alarm somewhere
at Google that will get your model yanked off the
3D Warehouse quicker than you can say
“First Amendment.” Tens of thousands of
impressionable, young eyeballs peruse Google’s
Web sites every day, so it behooves Google to
keep those sites clean. If you have kids, I’m sure
you understand.

Go ahead and poke around the 3D Warehouse. It’s amazing what you’ll find;
thousands of people are adding new content every day. Most of it isn’t very
useful, but you’ll still find plenty of interesting things to download and look
at. I don’t explain all the ins and outs of the 3D Warehouse in this book
because I think it’s pretty self-explanatory. However, if you need more infor-
mation, check out the online Help — it’s in the lower-right corner of your
browser window when you’re in the 3D Warehouse.
Uploading your models
You can break the models in the 3D Warehouse into two broad categories:
 Geolocated: Things like buildings, monuments, bridges, and dams exist
in a specific geographic location; they never move around. These are the
kinds of models that show up on the 3D Buildings layer in Google Earth,
and the 3D Warehouse is where they come from. To upload your own
geolocated models, you need to start with a Google Earth snapshot; this
provides the geolocation information that Google needs to put your
model in the right place. Check out the section “Building Models for
Google Earth,” earlier in this chapter, for a blow-by-blow account of how
to build geolocated models that you can upload to the 3D Warehouse.
 Nongeolocated: Objects like toasters, SUVs, wheelchairs, and sofas
aren’t unique, and they don’t exist in any one geographic location. No
physical address is associated with a model of a Honda Accord because
millions of them exist, and because Honda Accords move around. Stuff
like this never shows up in Google Earth because the folks at Google
wouldn’t know where to put it. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t belong in
the 3D Warehouse, though; models of nongeolocated stuff are incredibly
valuable for people who are making their own SketchUp models. When I
modeled my house, I furnished it with couches, beds, and other models I
found in the Warehouse.
Follow these steps to upload your own model to the Google 3D Warehouse:
1. Open the model you want to upload in SketchUp.
2. Fiddle around with your view until you like what you see.
When you upload a model to the 3D Warehouse, SketchUp automatically
creates a preview image that’s a snapshot of your modeling window.
3. Choose File➪3D Warehouse➪Share Model.
A mini-browser window opens, and it shows the logon screen for the 3D
Warehouse. If you want to upload models, you need a Google account.
They’re free; you just need a valid e-mail address to get one. If you don’t
already have one, follow the on-screen instructions to sign up.

Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse

When you’re creating your Google account, be sure to type something in
where the system asks for a “nickname.” If you don’t, everything you
upload will be attributed to “Anonymous.”
4. Enter your Google account information and click the Sign In button.
5. Fill out the Upload to 3D Warehouse form as completely as you can:
• Title: Enter a title for your model. If it’s a public building, you
might enter its name. Something like “Royal West Academy” would
do nicely.
• Description: Models with complete descriptions are very popular
with people who are hunting around the Warehouse. Try to use
complete sentences here; the more you write, the better.
• Address: This field only appears if your model is geolocated,
meaning that you started with a Google Earth snapshot. If you
know the physical address of the thing you made, type it in.
• Google Earth Ready: You only get this option if your model is
geolocated. If your model is accurate, correctly sized, and in the
right location, and if you want it to be considered for inclusion on
the default 3D Buildings layer of Google Earth, select this check
box. If you do, the folks at Google will consider adding it to Google
Earth. Keep your fingers crossed!
• Web Site: If you have a Web-site address that you’d like people
who view your model to visit, enter it here. For example, if your
model is a historic building, you might include the Web site that
provides more information about it.
• Tags: Type in a string of words that describe the thing you mod-
eled. Whatever you enter here will be used by the 3D Warehouse
search engine to help people find your model. To increase the
number of people who see what you made, add lots of tags. If I
were uploading a modern coffee table, I’d enter the following tags:
coffee table, table, coffee, modern, living room, furniture, glass,
chrome, metal, steel. You get the idea — be exhaustive.
6. Click the Upload button to add your model to the 3D Warehouse.
If everything works properly, you should get a page with your model on
it, along with all the information you just entered. The words “Model has
been uploaded successfully” will be highlighted in yellow at the top of
your browser window. Congratulations — you’re now a member of the
worldwide 3D community.

A
s much as everyone likes to pretend that we all live in an all-digital
world, the ugly truth is that we don’t. People use more paper now than
they ever have; I have a stack of junk prints on the coffee table in front of me
as I’m writing this. It’s not that I have anything against trees — it’s just that
printing is so satisfying. I love having something I can fold up and put in my
pocket, or stick to the fridge, or mail to my Luddite relatives. Computer
screens are nice, but in most people’s minds, paper is real.
In this chapter, I talk about how to print views of your SketchUp model.
Because the Windows and Mac versions of this procedure are so different,
I dedicate a whole section to each platform. The last part of this chapter is
devoted to scaled printing — a topic that can sometimes makes experienced
architects nervous. SketchUp makes printing to scale a little harder than it
could be, but it’s still a whole lot better than drawing things by hand.
Printing from a Windows Computer
It’s very easy to print from SketchUp, as long as you’re not trying to do any-
thing too complicated. By complicated, I mean printing to a particular scale,
which can be a harrowing experience the first couple of times you attempt it.
Fortunately, printing to scale is something most people almost never have to
do, so I’ve included instructions for how to do it at the end of this chapter.

Making a basic print (Windows)
Most of the time, all you need to do is to print exactly what you see on your
screen. Follow these steps to do that:
1. Make sure that you have the view you want to print in your modeling
window.
Unless you’re printing to scale (which I cover in the last part of this chap-
ter), SketchUp prints exactly what you see in your modeling window.
2. Choose File➪Print Setup.
This opens the Print Setup dialog box, which is where you make choices
about what printer and paper you want to print to.
3. In the Print Setup dialog box (see Figure 12-1), do the following:
a. Choose the printer you’d like to use.
b. Choose a paper size for your print.
c. Choose an orientation for your print; most of the time, you’ll
want to use Landscape, because your screen is usually wider
than it is tall.
4. Click the OK button to close the Print Setup dialog box.
5. Choose File➪Print Preview.
This opens the Print Preview dialog box. As an exact copy of the Print
dialog box, Print Preview lets you see an image of what your print will
look like before you send it to a printer. Lots of trees will thank you for
saving paper by using Print Preview every time you print.

Setup dialog

6. In the Print Preview dialog box, do the following:
a. In the Tabbed Scene Print Range area, choose which scenes you’d
like to print, if you have more than one. If you need to, you can
read all about scenes in Chapter 10.
b. Tell SketchUp how many copies of each scene you need.
c. Make sure that the Fit to Page check box is selected.
d. Make sure that the Use Model Extents check box isn’t selected.
e. Choose a print quality for your printout (I recommend High
Definition for most jobs).
For a complete description of all the knobs and doohickeys in the Print
Preview and Print dialog boxes, have a look at the next section in this
chapter.
7. Click the OK button to close the Print Preview dialog box and gener-
ate an on-screen preview of what your print will look like.
8. If you like what you see, click the Print button in the upper-left corner
of the Print Preview window to open the Print dialog box.
If you don’t like what you’re about to print, click the Close button (at the
top of the screen) and go back to Step 1.
9. In the Print dialog box (which should look exactly like the Print Preview
dialog box), click the OK button to send your print job to the printer.
Decoding the Windows Print dialog box
Three cheers for simplicity! The Print Preview and Print dialog boxes in
SketchUp are exactly the same. Figure 12-2 shows the former, because that’s
the one I advocate using first every time, but the descriptions in this section
apply to both.
Printer
If you used the Print Setup dialog box first, you shouldn’t need to change any
of the settings in this section. If you want, you can choose which printer to
print to from the drop-down list. If you know something about printers, you
can even click the Properties button to make adjustments to your printer set-
tings. (Because these are different for every printer on Earth, that’s between
you and your printer’s user manual — I’m afraid I can’t be of much help.)

Chapter 12: Printing Your Work

Tabbed Scene Print Range
Use this area to tell SketchUp which of your scenes you’d like to print, if you
have more than one. This is really handy for quickly printing all your scenes.
Select the Current View option to only print whatever’s currently in your
modeling window.
Copies
This one’s pretty basic: Choose how many copies of each view you’d like to
print. If you’re printing multiple copies of multiple scenes, select the Collate
check box to print “packets,” which can save you from having to assemble
them yourself. Here’s what happens when you’re printing three copies of four
scenes:
 Selecting the Collate check box prints the pages in the following order:
123412341234.
 Deselecting the Collate check box prints the pages like this:
111222333444.

Print Size
This is by far the most complicated part of this dialog box; you use the Print
Size controls to determine how your model will look on the printed page.
Figure 12-3 shows the effect of some of these settings on a final print.

295
Chapter 12: Printing Your Work

The Print Size controls are as follows:
 Fit to Page: Selecting this check box tells SketchUp to make your printed
page look like your Modeling Window. As long as the Use Model Extents
check box isn’t selected, you should be able to see exactly what you see
on your screen — no more, no less.
 Use Model Extents: I have to admit that I don’t like this option; I almost
never select it. All this does is tell SketchUp to zoom in to make your
model (excluding your sky, ground, watermark, and whatever else might
be visible on your screen) fit the printed page. If I want this effect, I just
use choose Camera➪Zoom Extents from the menu bar before I print my
model; it’s easier, and I know exactly what I’m getting.
 Page Size: As long as you don’t have the Fit to Page check box selected,
you can manually enter a page size using these controls. If you type in a
width or height, SketchUp figures out the other dimension and pretends
it’s printing on a different-sized piece of paper.
This option is especially useful if you want to make a big print by tiling
together lots of smaller pages. See the next section in this chapter for
more details.
 Scale: Here’s where it gets a little complicated. To print to scale, you
have to do two things before you go anywhere near the Print or Print
Preview dialog boxes:
• Switch to Parallel Projection mode.
• Make sure that you’re using one of the Standard views.
Take a look at the section “Printing to scale (Windows and Mac),” later
in this chapter, for a complete rundown on printing to scale in SketchUp.
Tiled Sheet Print Range
Perhaps you’re printing at a scale that won’t fit on a single page, or you’ve
entered a print size that’s bigger than the paper size you chose in the Print
Setup dialog box. The Tiled Sheet Print Range area lets you print your image
on multiple sheets and then attach them all together later. You can get
posters from your small-format printer!
Print Quality
To be honest, I think there’s a little bit of voodoo involved in selecting a print
quality for your image. What you get with each setting depends a lot on your
model, so you should probably try out a couple different settings if you have
296
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

time. Draft and Standard are really only useful for making sure your model
appears the way you want it to on the printed page; I recommend using High
Definition first, then bumping up to Ultra High Definition if your computer/
printer setup can handle it.
Other settings
You can control the following odds-and-ends settings in the Print Preview
dialog box, too:
 2-D Section Slice Only: If you have a visible section cut in your model
view, selecting this check box tells SketchUp to only print the section
cut edges. Figure 12-4 shows what the same model view would look like
without (on the left) and with (right) this option selected. I use this to
produce simple plan and section views that I can sketch on by hand.
 Use High Accuracy HLR: The bad news is that I have no idea what HLR
stands for. The good news is that it doesn’t really matter. Selecting this
check box tells SketchUp to send vector information to the printer
instead of the usual raster data (check out Chapter 13 for a description
of what these terms mean). Why should you care? Vector lines look
much smoother and cleaner when printed, so your whole model will
look better — with one condition: Gradients (those nice, smooth shad-
ows on rounded surfaces) don’t print well as vectors. If you have a lot of
rounded or curvy surfaces in your model view, you probably don’t want
to choose this option. I’d try a print both ways, and choose the one that
looks better. Thank goodness for Print Preview, huh?
If your model view includes a sketchy edges style, don’t use high accuracy
HLR; you won’t see any of the nice, sketchy effects in your final print.

Chapter 12: Printing Your Work

Printing from a Mac
If you’re using a Mac, the printing story is a little simpler than it is for folks
who use Windows computers, but only by a little. The first part of the follow-
ing sections lays out a procedure for generating a simple, straightforward
print of what you see in your Modeling Window. The second part could be
called “Gross anatomy of the Mac Document Setup dialog box”; this is where I
go into some detail about what each and every setting does.
Making a basic print (Mac)
Follow these steps to print exactly what you see in your Modeling Window on
a Mac:
1. Make sure that your Modeling Window contains whatever you want to
print.
SketchUp prints exactly what you see in your Modeling Window, unless
of course you’re printing to scale. This is considerably more compli-
cated, so I gave it a whole section at the end of this chapter.
2. Choose File➪Page Setup.
This opens the Page Setup dialog box, where you decide what printer
and paper size to use.
3. In the Page Setup dialog box (see Figure 12-5), do the following:
a. Choose the printer you’d like to use from the Format For drop-
down list.
b. Choose a paper size for your print.
c. Choose an orientation for your print. I usually end up using the
second or third one (Landscape), because my Modeling Window is
usually wider than it is tall.
4. Click the OK button to close the Page Setup dialog box.
5. Choose File➪Document Setup.
This opens the Document Setup dialog box.
298
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

6. In the Document Setup dialog box, make sure that the Fit View to Page
check box is selected.
Check out the next section in this chapter for a full description of what
everything does.
7. Click the OK button to close the Document Setup dialog box.
8. Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box.
9. In the Print dialog box, click the Preview button.
This generates an on-screen preview of what your print will look like on
paper.
10. If the preview suits you, click the Print button to send your print job
to the printer.
If you’re not happy with the preview, click the Cancel button and start
again at Step 1. Isn’t printing fun?
Deciphering the Mac printing dialog boxes
Because printing from SketchUp on a Mac involves two separate dialog
boxes, I describe both in the following sections.
The Document Setup dialog box
You use the settings in the Document Setup dialog box (see Figure 12-6) to
control how big your model prints. Here’s what everything does:
Figure 12-5:
The Page

box on a

299
Chapter 12: Printing Your Work

 Print Size: This one’s pretty self-explanatory, but here are some details
just in case:
• Fit View to Page: Selecting this check box tells SketchUp to make
your printed page look just like your Modeling Window on-screen.
It’s really that simple.
• Width and Height: If the Fit View to Page check box is deselected,
you can type in either a width or a height for your final print.
This is the way to go if you want to print a tiled poster out of sev-
eral sheets of paper; just enter a final size and you’ll have a poster
in no time flat.
 Print Scale: Use these settings to control the scale of your printed draw-
ing, if that’s the kind of print you’re trying to make. Because printing to
scale is a bit of an ordeal, I devote the last section of this chapter to the
topic. Refer to that section for a description of what these settings do.
 Pages Required: This is really just a readout of how many pages you
need to print. If you have selected the Fit View to Page check box, this
should say 1. If your print won’t fit on one sheet, it will be tiled onto the
number of sheets displayed in this section of the dialog box.
The Print dialog box
The Print dialog box on the Mac is something of a many-headed beast; sev-
eral more panels are hidden underneath the Copies & Pages drop-down list.
Luckily, we only need to use two. Both are pictured in Figure 12-7 and
described in the following list:
Figure 12-6:
The Mac
Document
Setup
dialog box.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

 Copies & Pages panel: The controls in this part of the Print dialog box
are pretty straightforward; use them to tell SketchUp how many copies
and pages you want to print:
• Copies: If you’re printing more than one copy of a print that
includes multiple pages, select the Collated check box to tell
SketchUp to print “packets,” which can save you from having to
collate them yourself.
• Pages: If the Pages Required readout at the bottom of the Document
Setup dialog box said that you need more than one sheet to print
your image, you can choose to print all or some of those pages
right here.
 SketchUp panel: You use the settings in this panel to control the final
appearance of your print:
• Print Quality: I usually set this to High, but the results you get
depend a lot on your printer model. In general, I never use Draft or
Standard unless I’m just making sure my page will look the way I
want it to. If you have time, try both High and Extra High and see
which one looks the best.
• Vector Printing: When you select this option, SketchUp sends
vector (instead of raster) information to the printer. Have a look at
Chapter 13 for a description of these terms.
The upshot here is that vector printing makes edges look much
smoother and cleaner, but does a lousy job on gradients (the shad-
ows on your curved surfaces). Use vector printing if your model
view is made up of mostly flat faces, but try printing both ways
(with vector printing on and off) to see which looks better.
If your model view includes a sketchy edges style, don’t choose
Vector Printing; you won’t see any of the nice, sketchy effects in
your final print.
• Line Weight: This option only works if you’ve selected the Vector
Printing check box. The number in this box represents the thick-
ness of edges in your print; any edges that are 1 pixel thick in your
model view will be drawn with a line as thick as what you choose
for this option. The default is 0.50 points, but feel free to experi-
ment to see what looks best for your model.
301
Chapter 12: Printing Your Work

Printing to a Particular Scale
Here’s where printing gets interesting. Sometimes, instead of printing exactly
what you see on your screen so that it fits on a sheet of paper, you might need
to print a drawing to scale. See the nearby sidebar “Wrapping your head
around scale” for more information about drawing to scale.
Preparing to print to scale
Before you can print a view of your model to a particular scale, you have to
set things up properly. Here are some things to keep in mind:
 Perspective views can’t be printed to scale. If you think about it, this
makes sense. In perspectival views, all lines appear to “go back” into
the distance, which means that they look shorter than they really are.
This doesn’t matter unless you’re using Vector Printing.
Choose another panel here.
Figure 12-7:
The Copies
& Pages and
SketchUp
panels of
the Print
dialog box.
302
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

Because the whole point of a scaled drawing is to be able to take accu-
rate measurements directly off your printout, views with perspective
don’t work.
 Switch to Parallel Projection if you want to print to scale. I know, I
know — this is the same as the last point. But it’s important enough that
I figure it’s worth mentioning twice. To change your viewing mode from
Perspective to Parallel Projection, choose Camera➪Parallel Projection.
That’s all there is to it.
 You have to use the Standard views. SketchUp lets you quickly look at
your model from the top, bottom, and sides by switching to one of the
Standard views. Choose Camera➪Standard and pick any of the views
except Iso.
Printing to scale (Windows and Mac)
The steps in this section allow you to produce a scaled print from SketchUp; I
give Windows instructions first, and then Mac. When the user-interface ele-
ments are different for the two platforms, the ones for Mac are shown in
parentheses. Figure 12-8 shows the relevant dialog boxes for printing to scale
in Windows and on a Mac.
When printing to scale, don’t worry about these numbers.
To print at 1 inch = 4 feet, you’ll need 20 pages

Chapter 12: Printing Your Work

Before you begin, make sure that you’ve switched to Parallel Projection and
that your view is lined up the right way. See the previous section of this chap-
ter for the lowdown on what you need to do to prepare your model view for
scaled printing. Follow these steps to produce a scaled print:
1. Choose File➪Print Setup (Page Setup).
2. Select a printer, paper size, and paper orientation, and then click the
OK button.
3. Choose File➪Print Preview (Document Setup).
304
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 
Wrapping your head around scale
When you print to scale, anyone with a special
ruler (called a scale, confusingly enough) can
take measurements from your drawing, as long
as he or she knows the scale at which it was
printed. You can use three different kinds of
drawing scales:
Architectural: In the United States, most people
use feet and inches to measure objects. Most
architectural scales substitute fractions of an
inch for a foot. Three common examples of
architectural scales are:

1⁄2 inch = 1 foot (1 inch = 2 feet)

1⁄4 inch = 1 foot (1 inch = 4 feet)

1⁄8 inch = 1 foot (1 inch = 8 feet)
Engineering: When it comes to measuring big
things like parcels of land and college campuses,
U.S. architects, engineers, and surveyors still use
feet, but they use engineering scales instead of
architectural ones. Three common engineering
scales are:
 1 inch = 20 feet
 1 inch = 50 feet
 1 inch = 100 feet
Metric: Outside of the United States, virtually
everyone uses the metric system. Because all
measurement is based on the number 10, metric
scales can be applied to everything from very
small things (blood cells) to very big things
(countries). Metric scales use ratios instead of
units of measure; here are three examples:
 1:10 (the objects in the drawing are 10 times
bigger in real life)
 1:100 (the objects in the drawing are 100
times bigger in real life)
 10:1 (the objects in the drawing are 10 times
smaller in real life)
The following figure shows the same drawing
printed at two different scales.
1 inch = 8 feet
1 inch = 16 feet

4. Deselect the Fit to Page (Fit View to Page) check box.
5. Make sure that the Use Model Extents check box is deselected.
Mac users don’t have this option, so there’s nothing to worry about.
6. Enter the scale at which you’d like to print your model view.
If I wanted to print a drawing at 1⁄4-inch scale, I would enter the following:
• 1 Inches into the In the Printout (In Drawing) box
• 4 Feet into the In SketchUp (In Model) box
If I wanted to produce a print at 1:100 scale, I would enter the following:
• 1 m into the In the Printout (In Drawing) box
• 100 m into the In SketchUp (In Model) box
7. Take note of how may pages you’ll need to print your drawing.
If you’re using Windows, you can check this in the Tiled Sheet Print
Range area of the dialog box. On a Mac, the number of pages you’ll need
appears in the Pages Required section of the Document Setup dialog
box. If you want to print on a different-sized piece of paper, change the
setting in the Print Setup (Page Setup) dialog box.
8. If you want to print your drawing on a single sheet and it won’t fit, try
using a smaller scale.
Using the 1⁄4 inch = 1 foot example, try shrinking the drawing to 3⁄16 inch =
1 foot scale. To do this, you would enter the following:
• 3 Inches into the In the Printout (In Drawing) box
• 16 Feet into the In SketchUp (In Model) box
9. When you’re happy with how your drawing will print, click the OK
button.
10. (Windows only) If you like what you see in the Print Preview window,
click the Print button (in the upper-left corner) to open the Print
dialog box.
11. (Mac only) Choose File➪Print.
12. In the Print dialog box, click the OK button to send your print job to
the printer.
Refer to the “Making a basic print” section for your operating system, earlier
in the chapter, for the whole story on basic printing from SketchUp.

W
ant to e-mail a JPEG of your new patio to your parents? How about a
movie that shows what it’s like to walk out onto that new patio? If you
need an image or a movie of your model, forget about viewing or printing
within SketchUp. Exporting is the way to go.
SketchUp can export both still images and animations in most of the major
graphics and movie formats. Here’s the part that’s a little bit confusing:
Which file formats you can export depend on the version of SketchUp you
have. If you have regular ol’ Google SketchUp (the free one), you can create
raster image files as well as movies. If you’ve sprung for Google SketchUp Pro,
you can also export vector files and a whole bunch of 3D formats; I talk about
all of them in Chapter 14.
In this chapter, I talk about the export file formats that are common to both
versions of Google SketchUp. Just in case you’re not familiar with the terms
raster and vector, I give brief definitions of each. Then I go into some detail
about the 2D raster image formats that you can create with SketchUp. I spend
the last part of this chapter talking about exporting animations as movie files
that anyone can open and view.
Exporting 2D Images of Your Model
Even though the free version of SketchUp can only export 2D views of your
model as raster images, I think it’s helpful to know a little bit about graphics
file formats in general. If you’re already an aficionado about these sorts
of things, or if you’re in a big hurry, you can skip ahead to the section
“Exporting a raster image from SketchUp.”

Pictures on your computer are divided into two basic flavors: raster and
vector. The difference between these two categories of file types has to do
with how they store image information. Here’s the one-minute version:
 Raster: Raster images are made up of dots. (Technically, these dots are
called pixels, just like the pixels that make up images you take with a 
digital camera.) Raster file formats consist of information about the loca-
tion and color of each dot. When you export a raster, you decide how
many dots (pixels) it should include, which directly affects how big it
can be displayed. SketchUp exports TIFF, JPEG, and PNG raster images;
the Windows version also exports BMPs, although that’s nothing to get
excited about. You can read more about raster images in the sidebar
“Understanding rasters: Lots and lots of dots,” later in this chapter.
 Vector: Vector images consist of instructions written in computer code.
This code describes how to draw the image to whatever software is trying
to open it. The major advantage of using vector imagery (as opposed to
raster) lies in its scalability — vectors can be resized larger or smaller
without affecting their image quality, while rasters lose quality if you
enlarge them too much. The free version of SketchUp can only export
raster images, but SketchUp Pro can export vectors in both PDF and EPS
file formats; you can read all about it in Chapter 14.
Exporting a raster image from SketchUp
The process of exporting a view of your SketchUp model is fairly straightfor-
ward. Depending on which format you choose, the export options are slightly
different, but I address all of them in this section.
Follow these steps to export a raster image from SketchUp:
1. Adjust your model view until you see exactly what you’d like to
export as an image file.
SketchUp’s raster image export is WYSIWYG — What You See Is What
You Get. Basically, your entire modeling window view is exported as an
image, so use the navigation tools or click on a scene to set up your
view. Use styles, shadows, and fog to make your model look exactly the
way you want it to. To change the proportions of your image, resize your
SketchUp window. Follow these steps to do so:
1. (Windows only) If your SketchUp window is full-screen, click the
Minimize button in its upper-right corner.
2. Drag the Resize tab in the lower-right corner of your SketchUp
window until the modeling window is the right proportion.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

In Figure 13-1, I want to export a wide view of a house I modeled, so I
adjust the proportions of my modeling window until things look right.
You might be wondering whether everything in your modeling window
shows up in an exported raster image. The red, green, and blue axes
don’t, which is good, but guides do, which is usually bad. If you don’t
want your guides to be visible in your exported image, deselect Guides
in the View menu.
2. Choose File➪Export➪2D Graphic.
This opens the File Export dialog box.
3. Choose the file format you’d like to use from the Format drop-down list.
Before you go ahead and choose JPEG by default, you should know that
this file type isn’t always the best choice. For a complete description of
each format (as well as recommendations for when to choose each), see
the section “Looking at SketchUp’s raster formats,” later in this chapter.
4. Choose a name and a location on your computer for your exported
image.
5. Click the Options button.
This opens the Export Options dialog box, where you can control how
your image is exported. Figure 13-2 shows what this dialog box looks like
for each of SketchUp’s raster file formats.

6. Adjust the settings in the Export Options dialog box.
Here’s a description of what the settings do:
• Use View Size: Selecting this check box tells SketchUp to export an
image file that contains the same number of pixels as are currently
being used to display your model on-screen. If you’re just planning
to use your exported image in an e-mail or in an on-screen presen-
tation (like PowerPoint), you select Use View Size, but it’s still
better to manually control the pixel size of your exported image.
If you’re planning to print your exported image, don’t select this
check box — whatever you do.
• Width and Height: When you don’t select the Use View Size check
box, you can manually enter the size of your exported image.
Because this process requires a fair amount of figuring, I’ve
devoted a whole section to it; take a look at “Making sure that
you’re exporting enough pixels,” later in this chapter, to find out
what to type into the Width and Height boxes.
• Anti-alias: Because raster images use grids of colored squares to
draw pictures, diagonal lines and edges can sometimes look jagged
and, well . . . lousy. Anti-aliasing is a process that fills in the gaps
around pixels with similar-colored pixels so that things look smooth.
Figure 13-3 illustrates the concept. In general, you want to leave
anti-aliasing on.
• Resolution (Mac only): This is where you tell SketchUp how big
each pixel should be, and therefore how big (in inches or centime-
ters) your exported image should be. Pixel size is expressed in
terms of pixels per inch/centimeter. This option is only available
when the Use View Size check box isn’t selected. Just like with the

Width and Height boxes, I go into a lot of detail about image resolu-
tion in the next section of this chapter.
• Transparent Background (Mac only, not for JPEGs): Mac users
can choose to export TIFFs and PNGs with transparent back-
grounds, which can make it easier to “cut out” your model in
another piece of software. Exporting your image with a transparent
background is also a nice way to use image-editing programs like
Photoshop to drop in a sky and ground plane later on. It’s too bad
this isn’t available for Windows users; it’s a really handy feature.
• JPEG Compression (JPEG only): This slider lets you decide two
things at the same time: the file size of your exported image and
how good the image will look. The two are, of course, inversely
related; the farther to the left you move the slider, the smaller your
file will be, but the worse it will look. I never set JPEG compression
any lower than 8 — my models take too long to build for me to
make them look terrible on export.
7. Click the OK button to close the Export Options dialog box.
8. Back in the File Export dialog box, click the Export button to export
your raster image file.
You can find your exported file in whatever location on your computer you
specified in Step 4, above. What you do with it is entirely up to you —
you can e-mail it, print it, or use it in another software program to create
a presentation.
Don’t be alarmed if the export process takes longer than you think it
should. If you’re exporting a pretty big image (one with lots and lots of
pixels), the export will take a while. Take the opportunity to call your
mother — she’ll appreciate it.

Looking at SketchUp’s raster formats
So you know you need to export a raster image from SketchUp, but which
one do you choose? You have four choices in Windows; three of them are
available on the Mac. The following sections give you the details.
When you export a raster image, you’re saving your current view in
SketchUp to a separate file somewhere on your computer. As a raster image,
that file consists of tiny, colored dots called pixels — more pixels than you
can shake a stick at. When you look at all the pixels together, they form an
image.
312
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 
Understanding rasters: Lots and lots of dots
When you look at a photograph on your computer,
you’re really looking at a whole bunch of tiny dots
of color called pixels. These are arranged in a
rectangular grid called a raster. Digital images
that are composed of pixels arranged in a raster
grid are called raster images, or rasters for short.
Have a look at the first image in the figure below
for a close-up view of a raster image. Here are
some things to keep in mind about rasters:
 Rasters are everywhere. Almost every dig-
ital image you’ve ever seen is a raster. TIFF,
JPEG, and PNG are the most common
raster file formats, and SketchUp exports all
three of them.
 Rasters are flexible. Every two-dimensional
image can be displayed as a raster; a grid
of colored squares is an incredibly effective
way of saving and sharing picture informa-
tion. As long as you have enough pixels, any
image can look good as a raster.
 Rasters take up a lot of space. If you think
about how raster images work, it takes a lot
of information to describe a picture. Digital
images are made up of anywhere from
thousands to millions of pixels, and each
pixel can be any one of millions of colors. To
store a whole picture, a raster image file
needs to include the location and color of
each pixel; the bigger the picture, the more
pixels it takes to describe it, and the bigger
the file size gets.
 Rasters are measured in pixels. Because
every raster image is made up of a specific
number of pixels, you use a raster’s pixel
dimensions to describe its size. If I told you
that I’d e-mailed you a photograph that was
800 x 600, you could expect to receive a pic-
ture that is 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall.
(See the following figure.) Pixels don’t have
a physical size on their own — they’re just
dots of color. You determine a picture’s phys-
ical size by deciding how big its pixels should
be; this is referred to as resolution, and is
generally expressed in terms of pixels per
inch (ppi). Check out the section “Making
sure that you’re exporting enough pixels,”
later in this chapter, for the whole scoop.

Tagged Image File (TIFF or TIF)
TIFFs are the stalwarts of the raster image file format world; everyone can
read them and just about everyone can create them. TIFF stands for Tagged
Image File Format, but that’s hardly important. Here’s everything you need to
know about TIFFs:
 When image quality is important, choose TIFF. Unless file size is a 
concern (because, for example, you need to send an image by e-mail),
always export a TIFF if you need a raster image. For everything from
working in Photoshop to creating a layout in InDesign or QuarkXPress, a
TIFF can provide the image quality you need.
 TIFFs don’t compress your image data. That means they don’t introduce
any garbage like JPEGs do, but it also means that they’re really big files.
 Pay attention to your pixel count. If you’re exporting a TIFF, you’re
probably looking for the best image quality you can get. And if that’s the
case, you need to make sure that your TIFF is “big” enough — that it
includes enough pixels — to display at the size you need. Have a look at
the next section in this chapter for more information.
313
Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations
Why use pixels instead of inches or centimeters
to describe the size of a digital image? It all has
to do with how computer screens work. Because
not all screens display things at the same size,
it’s impossible to predict how big an image will
look when it shows up on someone’s computer.
Depending on the person’s display settings, an
800-x-600-pixel image might be a few inches
across, or it might take up the whole screen.
Giving a digital image’s dimensions in pixels is the
only accurate way of describing how “big” it is.
Individual pixels
800 pixels
600 pixels

JPEG (or JPG)
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, which makes it sound
much fancier than it really is. Almost every digital image you’ve ever seen
was a JPEG (pronounced JAY-peg); it’s the standard file format for images on
the Web. Check out these JPEG details:
 When file size is a concern, choose JPEG. The whole point of the JPEG
file format is to compress raster images to manageable file sizes so that
they can be e-mailed and put on Web sites. A JPEG is a fraction of the
size of a TIFF file with the same number of pixels, so JPEG is a great
choice if file size is more important to you than image quality.
 JPEGs compress file size by degrading image quality. This is known as
lossy compression; JPEG technology basically works by tossing out a lot
of the pixels in your image. JPEGs also introduce a fair amount of pixel
garbage; these smudges are called artifacts, and they’re awful. Take a
look at Figure 13-4 to see what I mean.
 JPEG + SketchUp = Danger. Because of the way the JPEG file format
works, JPEG exports from SketchUp are particularly susceptible to look-
ing terrible. Images from SketchUp usually include straight lines and
broad areas of color, both of which JPEG has a hard time handling. If
you’re going to export a JPEG from SketchUp, make sure that the JPEG
Compression slider is never set below 8. For more details, see the sec-
tion “Exporting a raster image from SketchUp,” earlier in this chapter.
Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
Hooray for PNG! Pronounced ping, this graphics file format is my hero.
Unfortunately, it isn’t as widely used as it should be. If I had my druthers
(I keep leaving them on the subway), every raster export from SketchUp
would be a PNG. Why? Because, at least as far as SketchUp is concerned,

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

PNG combines all the best features of TIFF and JPEG. Why don’t more people
use PNGs? Because standards are hard to change, and right now, it’s a JPEG
world. PNG details are as follows:
 PNGs compress image data without affecting image quality. As a 
lossless compression technology, PNGs are smaller files than TIFFs (just
like JPEGs), but they don’t mess up any pixels (totally unlike JPEGs).
Granted, PNGs aren’t as small as JPEGs, but I think the difference in
image quality is worth a few extra bits.
 If you’re exporting an image for someone who knows a thing or two
about computers, choose PNG. The truth is, some software doesn’t
know what to do with a PNG, so there’s a risk in using it. If you plan to
send your exported image to someone who knows what he’s doing, go
ahead and send a PNG — he’ll be impressed that you’re “in the know.”
If the recipient of your export is less technologically sophisticated, stick
with a JPEG or TIFF file; it’s the safe choice.
The PNG file format wasn’t developed to replace JPEG or TIFF; it was sup-
posed to stand in for GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), which is a file type
that SketchUp doesn’t export. Without going into too much detail, folks use
JPEG for images like photographs and GIF for things like logos. Because
exported SketchUp views usually have more in common with the latter, PNG
(the replacement for GIF) is the better choice. So why can’t PNG replace
JPEG and TIFF? For most photographs (which are the majority of images on
the Web), JPEG is better than PNG because it produces smaller files, which in
turn yields faster load times when you’re surfing the Internet. TIFF is more
versatile than PNG because it supports different color spaces, which are
important to people in the printing industry. For reasons that are beyond the
scope of this book, that isn’t relevant to exports from SketchUp; PNG is still
(in my opinion) the best — if not the safest — choice.
Windows Bitmap (BMP)
Windows Bitmap, or BMP, files are old school; they can only be used on
Windows, and they’re big. If a BMP were a car, it would be the old, rusty van
in your parents’ garage. As you can probably guess, I don’t recommend using
BMPs for anything, with a couple of exceptions:
 To send your exported file to someone with a very old Windows com-
puter: If the person to whom you’re sending an exported image has a
Windows computer that’s more than about 5 years old, I suppose I’d
send her a BMP.
 To place an image in an old Windows version of layout software: If
your layout person is using a copy of Word or PageMaker that’s a few
years old, he might need a BMP file.
315
Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations

Making sure that you’re 
exporting enough pixels
When it comes to raster images, it’s all about pixels. The more pixels your
image has, the more detailed it is, and the bigger it can be displayed or
printed. Figure 13-5 shows the same image three times. The first image is 150
x 50, meaning that it’s 150 pixels wide by 50 pixels high. The second image is
300 x 100, and the third is 900 x 300. Notice how the image with more pixels
looks a lot better? That’s the whole point of this section.
Why not always export a truckload of pixels, just in case you need them?
There are two reasons:
 Image exports with lots of pixels take a long time to process.
 Raster images are very big files.
How many pixels you need to export depends on what you’re going to use
the image for. Very broadly, you can do two things with your image:
 Display or project it on a screen, digitally
 Print it
In the next two sections, I talk about each of these possibilities in detail.
Exporting enough pixels for a digital presentation
If you plan to use your exported image as part of an on-screen presentation, it’s
helpful to know what computer monitors and digital projectors can display:
150 x 50 pixels
300 x 100 pixels
900 x 300 pixels
Figure 13-5:

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

 The smallest, oldest devices currently in use have images that are 800
pixels wide by 600 pixels high.
 At the other end of the spectrum, high-end, 30-inch LCD monitors dis-
play 2560 x 1600 pixels.
So it stands to reason that, if you’re exporting an image that will be viewed
on-screen only, you need to create an image that’s somewhere between 800
and 2500 pixels wide. Table 13-1 provides some guidelines on image sizes for
different digital applications.

For images that will be shown digitally, leave the Resolution setting (in the
Export Options dialog box) at 72 pixels per inch. For computer monitors and
digital projectors, the image resolution is meaningless because the pixels in
your image correspond directly to the pixels on your screen; inches and cen-
timeters don’t even come into play.
Understanding resolution: Exporting images for print
Images that you want to print need to have lots more pixels than ones that
are only going to be displayed on-screen. That’s because printers — inkjet,
laser, and offset — all operate very differently than computer monitors and
digital projectors. When you print something, the pixels in your image turn
into microscopic specks of ink or toner, and these specks are smaller than
the pixels on your computer screen. To make a decent-sized print of your
exported image, it needs to contain enough pixels per inch of image. An
image’s pixel density, expressed in pixels per inch (ppi), is its resolution.
What kind of resolution you need depends on three things:
 The kind of device you’ll be printing to: For home inkjet printers, you
can get away with a resolution of as little as 150 ppi. If your image will be
appearing in a commercially produced book, you need a resolution of at
least 300 ppi.
317
Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations

 How far away the image will be from the audience: There’s a big differ-
ence between a magazine page and a trade-show banner. For close-up
applications, a resolution of 200 to 300 ppi is appropriate. Large graphics
that will be viewed from several feet away can be as low as 60 ppi.
 The subject matter of the image itself: Photographic images tend to
consist of areas of color that blur together a bit; these kinds of images
can tolerate being printed at lower resolutions than drawings with lots
of intricate detail. For images with lots of lines (like SketchUp models),
it’s best to work with very high resolutions — 300 to 600 ppi — especially
if the image will be viewed close-up.
Table 13-2 provides some guidelines for exporting images that will be printed.

Keep in mind that the biggest raster image that SketchUp can export is 10,000
pixels wide or tall (whichever is greater). This means that the largest banner
image, printed at 100 ppi, that SketchUp can create is about 100 inches wide.
To make larger images, you need to export a vector file; check out the details
on exporting to vector formats with SketchUp Pro in Chapter 14.
Follow these steps to make sure that you’re exporting enough pixels to be
able to print your image properly:
1. In the Export Options dialog box, make sure that the Use View Size
check box is deselected.
To get to the Export Options dialog box, follow Steps 1 through 6 in the
section “Exporting a raster image from SketchUp,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Decide on the resolution that you need for your exported image.
(Refer to Table 13-2.)
Keep the resolution in your head or scribble it on a piece of paper.
318
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

3. Decide how big your exported image will be printed, in inches or 
centimeters.
Note your desired physical image size, just like you did with the resolu-
tion in the previous step.
4. Multiply your resolution from Step 2 by your image size from Step 3 to
get the number of pixels you need to export:
Resolution (pixels/inch or cm) × Size (inches or cm) = Number of pixels
In other words, if you know what resolution you need to export, and you
know how big your image will be printed, you can multiply the two num-
bers to get the number of pixels you need. Here’s an example:
300 pixels/inch × 8 inches wide = 2,400 pixels wide
To export an image that can be printed 8 inches wide at 300 ppi, you
need to export an image that’s 2400 pixels wide. Figure 13-6 gives an
illustration of this example.
SketchUp’s default setting is to make your exported image match the
proportions of your modeling window; that is, you can only type in a
width or a height, but not both. To manually enter both dimensions,
click the Unlink button (which looks like a chain). You can always click it
again to relink the width and height dimensions later.
8 inches wide @ 300 ppi = 2400 pixels
Enter 2400 here

Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations

5. Type in the width or height of the image you’d like to export, in pixels.
It’s usually pretty hard to know exactly how big your image will be when
it’s printed, and even if you do, you probably want to leave some room
for cropping. For these reasons, I always add 15–25 percent to the
number of pixels I figure I’ll need. If my image calls for 2,400 pixels,
I export 3,000 pixels, just to be safe.
If you’re on a Mac, things are a little easier because SketchUp’s design-
ers built a pixel calculator right into the Export Options dialog box.
Just enter your desired resolution in the appropriate spot, change the
width and height units from pixels to inches or centimeters, and type
in your desired image size. SketchUp does the arithmetic for you.
6. Click the OK button to export your image.
Making Movies with Animation Export
When it comes to having nerdy fun, I think exporting movie animations of your
SketchUp models is right up there with iPods and store-bought fireworks.
Like both of these things, what’s so great about animation export is how easy it
is to do. That’s not to say that animation and digital video are simple topics —
they’re not. It would take a freight elevator to move the books that have been
written about working with video on the computer, but I’m going to keep it
simple. Because you and I are primarily interested in 3D modeling, what you’ll
find in the following sections are instructions for doing what you need to do.
Getting ready for prime time
The key to exporting animations of your SketchUp models is using scenes; if
you haven’t read it already, now’s the time to check out Chapter 10. Scenes
are saved views of your model that you can arrange in any order you want.
When you export an animation, SketchUp strings together the scenes in your
model to create a movie file that can be played on just about any computer
made in the last several years.
Follow these steps to get your model ready to export as an animation:
1. Create scenes to build the “skeleton” of your animation.
2. To adjust the animation settings in the Model Info dialog box, choose
Window➪Model Info and then select the Animation panel.
I explain all the controls in the section about moving from scene to
scene in Chapter 10.
3. Click the Enable Scene Transitions check box to tell SketchUp to move
smoothly from one scene to the next.
320
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

4. Enter a transition time to tell SketchUp how long to spend moving
between scenes.
If your Scene Delay is 0 (below), you can multiply your transition time
by your number of scenes to figure out how long your exported anima-
tion will be.
5. Enter a scene delay time to pause at each scene before moving on to
the next one.
If you plan to talk about each scene, use this feature. If your animation is
supposed to be a smooth walk-through or flyover, set this to 0.
6. Adjust the proportions of your modeling window to approximate the
proportions of your movie.
Unlike SketchUp’s 2D export formats, the proportions of your exported
movie don’t depend on those of your modeling window; that is to say,
making your modeling window long and skinny won’t result in a long and
skinny movie. You choose how many pixels wide and tall you want your
movie to be, so to get an idea of how much you’ll be able to see, make
your modeling window match the proportions of your exported file 
(4:3 is common for video formats). Have a look at Step 1 in the section
“Exporting a raster image from SketchUp,” earlier in this chapter, for
guidance on adjusting your modeling window.
7. When your project is ready to go, move on to the next section to
export your animation.
Exporting a movie
Fortunately, you have only one choice if you want to export a movie from
SketchUp. If you’re using Windows, you create an AVI file; Mac users create
QuickTime MOVs.
If you’re paying close attention to the available file formats for exporting
movies, you’ll probably notice three more choices in the drop-down menu:
TIF, JPG, and PNG. I don’t go into detail about these formats for animation
(movie) export in SketchUp because you probably won’t need them; choos-
ing to export in any of these formats will give you a pile of image files that
each represent one frame in your animation. People who want to include
their SketchUp animation in a Flash file should take advantage of this option,
but explaining how to do so is beyond the scope of this book.
While exporting animations in SketchUp is a pretty simple operation, figuring
out how to set all the animation export controls can seem like landing the
space shuttle. What follows are step-by-step instructions for generating a
movie file; settings recommendations are in the next section.
321
Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations

Follow these steps to export a movie file from SketchUp:
1. Prepare your model for export as an animation.
See the section “Getting ready for prime time,” earlier in this chapter, for
a list of things you need to do before you export an animation.
2. Choose File➪Export➪Animation.
This opens the Animation Export dialog box.
3. Give your movie file a name, and choose where it should be saved on
your computer system.
4. Make sure that the correct file format is selected.
In the Format drop-down menu, choose AVI if you’re using Windows and
QuickTime if you’re on a Mac.
5. Click the Options button to open the Animation Export Options dialog
box. (See Figure 13-7.)
6. Adjust the settings for the type of animation you want to export.
How you set everything up in this dialog box depends on how you plan
to use the animation you end up creating. Check out the next section in
this chapter for recommended settings for different applications.
If you’re working on a Mac, there’s an extra drop-down menu that you
might find helpful: Format includes a short list of uses for your anima-
tion. Choosing one automatically sets most of the controls for you,
though (as you see in the next section) you can improve things a bit by
making some of your own selections.
7. Select the Anti-alias check box, if it isn’t already selected.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

Choosing this doubles the amount of time it takes for your animation to
export, but it makes your edges look much better in the final movie.
8. Click the Codec button (Windows) or the Expert button (Mac).
This opens the Video Compression (Compression Settings on a Mac)
dialog box. (See Figure 13-8.) Choose the correct settings for the type of
animation you want to export, again referring to the next section of this
chapter for details about what the options mean.
9. Click the OK button in the compression dialog box, and then the OK
button again in the Export Options dialog box.
This returns you to the Animation Export dialog box.
10. Check to make sure that everything looks right, and then click the
Export button.
Because exporting an animation takes a while, it pays to double-check
your settings before you click the Export button. When the export is
complete, you can find your animation file in the location you specified
in Step 3. Double-clicking it should cause it to open in whatever movie-
playing software you have that can read it. On Windows computers, this
is usually Windows Media Player; on Macs, it’s QuickTime.

Figuring out the Animation 
Export options settings
As I said before, digital video is complicated. Lucky for us, you don’t really
have to know what everything means to export the right kind of movie; you
just have to know how to set up everything.
What follows are a number of different things you might want to do with your
animation, and recommended settings for getting good results. Feel free to
experiment, but the following sections are a good place to start.
For sending in an e-mail
If you’re going to e-mail someone an animation file, you have to make the file
as small as you can. These settings can help you do just that:

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

For viewing on-screen (computer or projector)
If you plan to use your animation as part of an on-screen presentation (such
as with PowerPoint or Keynote), you probably want it to look good full-
screen. You’ll probably be using a digital projector to present, and these
days, most digital projectors come in two resolutions: 800 x 600 and 1024 x
768. If you know the resolution of the projector you’ll be using, you’re made
in the shade. If you’re unsure, export at the lower pixel count, just to be safe:

You want your exported animations to look smooth — the transitions from
one frame to the next shouldn’t be jumpy or awkward. If your camera is cover-
ing a lot of ground (in other words, moving a large distance between scenes) in
a very short time, you might want to experiment with increasing your frame
rate to smooth things out. Doing so adds more frames between transitions,
which means the camera isn’t traveling as far between frames.
For exporting to DV (to be viewed on a TV with a DVD player)
If you need to export an animation that will be burned onto a DVD that will
(in turn) be played in a DVD player, you should go all-in on quality and file
size. The export process will take a long time, but you’ll get the best-looking
movie you can get. Try these settings first:

on’t you hate how airlines make you walk through the first-class section
to get to your seat? I think the economy section is bad enough without
having to see how much better some people have it — the big, cushy seats,
the dinner entrees made with real meat — I’m usually in a bad mood by the
time I sit down. But what does this have to do with export formats in
SketchUp Pro? It’s all about knowing what you’re not getting.
If you don’t have the Pro version of SketchUp, don’t bother reading this chap-
ter (or the next one, either). The stuff I talk about only applies to those folks
who have sprung for the bells-and-whistles version of SketchUp. Now, if
you’re using Google SketchUp (free), and you’re wondering what’s in Pro, you
might find it useful to peruse these pages to see what you’re missing. Unlike
the flight attendant on the last plane I was on, I won’t yell at you for sticking
your head through the curtain to take a look around.
SketchUp Pro users have access to a few file export formats that aren’t avail-
able in the free version of SketchUp. These file formats let you share your
work with other “pro-grade” software programs like Illustrator, AutoCAD, and
3D Studio MAX. Most people who design things for a living use a number of
different pieces of software to get their work done, and they need the ability
to move their data between them. That’s where SketchUp Pro’s exporters
come in.
I’ve divided this chapter into two halves: The first part talks about
SketchUp’s 2D export formats, and the second part deals with the 3D ones.
For each file format that SketchUp exports, I provide a description of what
the settings do, and in some cases, why you might need them. Which format
(or formats) you choose depends entirely on what other software you’re using.

Exporting Drawings in 2D
It’s all fine and well to have a 3D model in SketchUp Pro, but most people who
design 3D objects (toasters, buildings, Volvos) eventually need to create 2D
views of their designs. Sometimes these views are for presentations, and
sometimes you need to import a 2D view into other software programs,
where you can continue to work on it. You can use SketchUp Pro’s 2D export
formats to do both.
Sizing up the export formats
You can find a lot of other software out there, and luckily, SketchUp Pro pro-
vides enough export formats that you can interact with most of it. On the 2D
export side, here’s a brief rundown on what SketchUp Pro has to offer:
 PDF: Lately, you can’t swing a cat (not that I ever would, Mom) without
hitting a Portable Document Format file. On top of the fact that almost
anyone can read them, PDF files are great for sending information to
vector-illustration programs like Illustrator and FreeHand.
 EPS: Encapsulated Postscript files are what folks used to use to transfer
vector information, but these days, more and more people are using PDFs.
 DWG: This is AutoCAD’s native file format, and it’s the best one to use
for transferring information to that program and other pieces of CAD
software. DWG can also contain 3D information, so I talk about it in the
second part of this chapter, too.
 DXF: Document Exchange Format is another “flavor” of DWG. It was
developed by Autodesk to be the file format that other pieces of soft-
ware use to transfer data into AutoCAD, because they weren’t supposed
to be able to create DWGs. Trouble is, DWG has been reverse-engineered
(taken apart, figured out, unlocked, and put back together again), so
now most CAD programs can exchange both DXF and DWG files to their
hearts’ content.
 EPIX: You may have never heard of Piranesi, but you should know about
it. It’s a piece of software that lets you “paint” on top of 2D views of your
model, but it’s much cooler than that. Anyway, EPIX lets you open 2D
views of your SketchUp model in Piranesi, if you have it.
In the sections that follow, I discuss each of the formats in more detail.
328
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

Exporting a 2D drawing
Regardless of which 2D format you choose to export, the procedure is always
the same. Follow these steps to export a 2D image from SketchUp Pro:
1. Adjust your model view until you have the view you want to export.
2. Choose File➪Export➪2D Graphic.
This opens the File Export dialog box.
3. Choose the file format you’d like to use from the Format drop-down list.
I describe each format in a fair amount of detail later in this chapter.
4. Choose a name and a location on your computer for your exported
image.
5. Click the Options button.
This opens the Export Options dialog box for the file format you chose
in Step 3. The options are unique to each file format, so check out the
section on the one you’re using for details on that particular format.
6. Adjust the settings in the Export Options dialog box, and click the OK
button.
This closes the Export Options dialog box.
7. Click the Export button to export your 2D image file.
Getting to know PDF and EPS
Here’s what you need to know about these two common vector file formats.
(Have a look at the sidebar “Vectors: Pictures made of math,” later in this
chapter, to find out what vectors are all about.)
Portable Document Format (PDF)
You’ve probably already heard of PDF files. Back in the old days (a few years
ago), it was hard to send someone a digital graphics file because so many 
different kinds were available, and because the person to whom you were
sending the file had to have the right kind of software to be able to open it. 
If I made a brochure in QuarkXPress and wanted to send it to you to review,
you had to have QuarkXPress, too — and chances were, you didn’t
(QuarkXPress cost $1,000).

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 
Vectors: Pictures made of math
Remembering the location and color of millions
of tiny dots isn’t the only way that computers
save images; it just happens to be the most
common. The alternative to raster imaging is
vector graphics, or vectors for short. In a vector,
lines, shapes, and colors are described by
mathematical functions. Before you run
screaming off into the distance, know that it’s
not as scary as it sounds. You don’t need to do
any math to create a vector. Your hardware and
software do it for you. Here are some things to
think about when it comes to vectors:
 Vectors don’t take up much space. Imagine
a straight line drawn using pixels. In order to
draw the line, your computer has to be told
where to put each and every pixel. In a vector
image (which doesn’t use pixels), a mathe-
matical function is used to tell your computer
how to draw that same line. Instead of having
to provide details for every single pixel, only
two instructions are needed: the function
that defines the line and its color. Of course,
actual vector graphics programming is a zil-
lion times more complicated than this, but
you get the general idea. Vector files are
much smaller than raster files.
 Vectors are scalable. With a raster, you’re
limited by the number of pixels you have in
your image. If you don’t have enough, you
might not be able to print or otherwise dis-
play your image very big. If you have a large
number of pixels, your image might look ter-
rific, but your file might be too huge to work
with. Because vectors are math-based
instructions that tell your software how to
draw an image, there’s no size limit to how
big — or small — your image can be. With
the same vector file, you could print your
company logo on your business card and on
the side of a blimp, and they would both look
great. The figure that follows shows what
I mean.
Raster
Vector

Adobe developed PDF to solve this problem, and it’s been wildly successful.
Because PDF reader software is already installed on tens of millions of com-
puters, anyone can open and view a PDF file created by anyone else. Lots of
programs (including SketchUp Pro) can export PDFs, so now there’s an easy
way for people to share graphics files.
Here are some things to consider about PDF and SketchUp:
 PDF is universal. Anyone with Adobe Reader (which is free from
Adobe’s Web site: www.adobe.com) can open and view a PDF you
create with SketchUp. In fact, anyone with a Mac can open a PDF just by
double-clicking it; the picture-viewing software that comes with the Mac
operating system uses PDF as its native format.
 PDF is consistent. When you send someone a PDF file, you can be 99 per-
cent sure that it will look just like it looks on your computer. The colors,
line weights, and text will all stay the same, which is important if you’re
showing someone a design.
 When you need to send a vector graphic file, use PDF unless someone
specifically requests an EPS file. Here’s the thing — just about every
piece of software I can think of handles PDFs with no problem. If you or
someone else needs a vector export from SketchUp, PDF works just
about every time.
Encapsulated Postscript (EPS)
Postscript is a computer language that was developed to describe graphical
objects. An EPS is an encapsulated Postscript file, meaning that it’s a self-
contained bundle of instructions for a how to draw an image. Back before
PDFs existed, this was the best way to move vector information around.
The key here is “back before PDFs existed” — nowadays, you don’t have
much reason to use EPS when you could export a PDF file instead. Here are
some things you should know about the EPS file format:
 EPS is complicated. Without boring you with all the details, EPS files are
different depending on what software and what operating system made
them. What’s more, you won’t find any free, commonly used programs
that can open them. You need something like Illustrator or a layout pro-
gram like InDesign, which most people don’t have.
 Use EPS if your other graphics software is more than a couple of ver-
sions old. PDF support has only been widely incorporated in the last few
years, so if you’re using older image-editing, illustration, or layout soft-
ware, you might need to use EPS.
 If someone you’re working with insists on EPS, go ahead and send an
EPS file. Some workflows have been designed with EPS files in mind,
which is why SketchUp exports EPS in the first place. It’s good to know
that EPS is there if you need it.
331
Chapter 14: Exporting to CAD, Illustration, and Other Modeling Software

Navigating the PDF/EPS Options dialog box
Figure 14-1 shows what this dialog box looks like. Careful — it’s ugly. Luckily,
it’s the same for both PDF and EPS exports, so that’s something, I guess.
In Windows, the name of this dialog box, as written in its title bar, is PDF
(or EPS) Hidden Line Options, but that makes no sense. I think it’s probably a
remnant from when SketchUp could only export vectors in the Hidden Line
Face style, but those days are over. The folks who make SketchUp are sharp
as tacks, but everybody makes mistakes sometimes.
Drawing (Image) Size
You use these settings to control the physical dimensions of your exported
image. If you want to produce a PDF that’s a particular size, this is where you
do it. You have these options:
 Width and Height: These controls are for telling SketchUp how big
you want your exported image to be. Because the proportions of your
image will be the same as those of your modeling window, you can enter
a width or a height, but not both.
If you’re on a Mac, you can click the Maintain Aspect Ratio button (it looks
like a chain). Doing so allows you to enter both width and height, which
is useful for exporting to common document sizes like letter and tabloid.
 Match View Size: (Mac only) Sometimes certain features just don’t
work; it’s not even worth explaining what the Match View Size check box
is supposed to do. Always leave Match View Size deselected — that’s all
you need to know.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

 Full Scale (1:1): (Windows only) Selecting this check box tells SketchUp
to export a drawing that’s the same size as your model. You can use this
option if you want a full-scale image of something relatively small, like a
teapot or a piggy bank. If you end up using Full Scale, remember to
follow Steps 1 through 3 in the nearby sidebar, “Setting up for scaled
drawings,” to make sure that your drawing exports the way you want
it to.
Drawing (Image) Scale
Perhaps you’re designing a deck for your neighbor’s house, and you want to
export a scaled PDF file so that the lumberyard can take measurements right
off the printed drawing. You want your drawing scale to be 1⁄8 inch = 1 foot,
and this is how you would specify that:
1. Enter 1” into the In Hidden Line Output (In Image) box.
2. Enter 8’ into the In SketchUp (In Model) box.
If you want to export a scaled drawing from SketchUp Pro, you have to set up
your model view a certain way. See the nearby sidebar, “Setting up for scaled
drawings,” for details. If you’re not set up properly, the Scale controls are
grayed out.
I should probably point out that you can choose to set the Drawing (Image)
Size or Scale, but not both. You can’t, for instance, tell SketchUp to export a
1⁄8-inch drawing as an 81⁄2-x-11-inch PDF file.
333
Chapter 14: Exporting to CAD, Illustration, and Other Modeling Software
Setting up for scaled drawings
To export a scaled drawing from SketchUp Pro,
you have to set up your model view properly. It’s
pretty simple — just follow these steps:
1. Before you go anywhere near the 2D
Graphic dialog box, switch from Perspective
to Parallel Projection view.
You do this by choosing Camera➪Parallel
Projection. In case you’re wondering, it’s
impossible to make a scaled perspective
view — drawings just don’t work that way.
2. Switch to one of the standard views.
Choose Camera➪Standard and pick a view
from the submenu to see a straight-on top,
side, or other view of your model.
3. Use the Pan and Zoom tools to make sure
that you can see everything you want to
export.
Whatever you do, don’t orbit! If you do, you
can always repeat Step 2.

Profile Lines (Windows only)
I don’t think profiles end up exporting very well to PDF and EPS, so I only use
this option if I’m going to be tweaking my image in a vector drawing program
like Illustrator or Freehand. You have the following options:
 Show Profiles: Select this check box to export profile lines in your
image, assuming that you’re using them in your model.
 Match Screen Display (Auto Width): Selecting this check box tells
SketchUp to make the exported profiles look as thick, relative to other
edges, as they do in your modeling window. If this check box isn’t
selected, you can type in a line width (thickness).
Section Lines (Windows only)
If you have section cut lines in your model view, these options become 
available:
 Specify Section Line Width: I’m not entirely sure why this option even
exists, because not selecting it is the same as choosing Match Screen
Display (see the next point). Software’s funny sometimes.
 Match Screen Display (Auto Width): Select this check box to export sec-
tion cut lines that look like they do on your screen. If you have another
thickness in mind, don’t select this check box; just enter a width right
beside it.
Extension Lines (Windows only)
As the only edge-rendering effect (besides profiles) that SketchUp can export
to PDF and EPS, extensions are pretty special; this is where you control them.
You have the following options:
 Extend Edges: Even if you have edge extensions turned on in your model,
you can choose not to export them by deselecting this check box.
 Match Screen Display (Auto Length): Select this check box to let
SketchUp make your extensions look like they do on your computer
screen. To put in a custom length, type one into the box on the right.
Line Quality (Mac only)
Whereas Windows users get to be very specific if they want to, Mac users
only have one point of control over exported line thickness, or weight. For
very detailed models, knock the Line Weight setting down to 0.5 or 0.75
points; otherwise, leave it at 1.00 and see whether you like it. This setting
depends on the complexity of your model, and on your personal taste.
Other Windows-only controls
You have a couple of other options in this dialog box; both can be very helpful:
334
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

 Always Prompt for Hidden Line Options: Do yourself a favor and select
this check box; it never hurts to look over your options before you do an
export.
 Map Windows Fonts to PDF Base Fonts: Even though PDF almost always
preserves the original appearance of your image, fonts are tricky. For
this reason, the PDF file format comes with a set of “safe” fonts that will
work on any computer, anywhere. Choosing this option tells SketchUp to
“map” — substitute — PDF-safe fonts for the ones in your SketchUp file.
Unless you’re really in love with the fonts you originally chose, it’s not a
bad idea to select this check box. Better safe than sorry.
Coming to terms with DXF 
and DWG (in 2D)
What can you say about these file formats? When it comes to CAD, DXF and
DWG are the 800-pound gorillas; they’re also the only 2D CAD formats that
SketchUp can export. Just about every CAD program in existence can do
something with either DXF or DWG, so your bases should be covered, no
matter what you’re using. Here are some things to keep in mind:
 DWG is more capable than DXF. Because the former is AutoCAD’s
native (private) file format, and DXF was developed by Autodesk to be
an exchange (public) file format, DWG has more bells and whistles. For
exporting 2D drawings from SketchUp to use in other CAD applications,
using DWG usually yields better results.
 Don’t be afraid to experiment. I’ll be saying this a couple more times
in this chapter. Data export from any program is kind of a hit-or-miss
endeavor, and you never know what you’re going to get until you try.
Whenever I’m sending my information from one piece of software to
another, I leave myself an extra hour for troubleshooting. I fiddle with
settings until things work.
 Don’t get confused by all the version numbers. Which version of DWG
or DXF you decide to export depends on what CAD software you’re
using. In general, it’s a good idea to use the most recent version avail-
able, which is DWG/DXF 2004 in SketchUp Pro 6. As long as your CAD
program isn’t older than that, you should be fine. If it is, try exporting an
earlier version.
This is a chapter about exporting and not importing, but I thought I’d slip
this in anyway: The most recent version of DXF or DWG that SketchUp Pro 6
can import is 2004. If you’re working in AutoCAD 2007, you’ll need to save
your file as version 2004 to bring it into SketchUp.
335
Chapter 14: Exporting to CAD, Illustration, and Other Modeling Software

Take a gander at Figure 14-2; this is what the DWG/DXF Hidden Line Options
dialog box look like, which contains your export options. Blessedly, the
options are the same for both DWG and DXF, so the following explanation
(the figure and the text), does double duty.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 
What you see isn’t always what you get
With their ability to scale without losing detail
and their (relatively) tiny file sizes, vector
images seem like a panacea, but unfortunately,
there’s more to the story. Whereas exported
raster images look just like they do on-screen,
vector images don’t. Most of SketchUp’s spiffy
graphic effects can’t be exported as vector
information. Here’s a list of what you give up
with PDF and EPS:
 Photo textures and transparency on faces
 Edge effects like depth cue, endpoints, and
jitter
 NPR (Sketchy Edge) styles
 Shadows and fog
 Background, ground, and sky colors
 Watermarks

Drawing Scale & Size
These settings let you control the final physical size of your exported draw-
ing. If you’re in Parallel Projection view, you can assign a scale; if you’re in
Perspective view, scale doesn’t apply. You have the following options:
 Full Scale (1:1): Most people use SketchUp Pro’s DXF/DWG Export fea-
ture to produce nonperspectival, orthographic views of their models
that they can use in their CAD programs. If that’s what you’re trying to
do, you should select this check box; it’ll make opening your exported
file in another program that much easier.
To export a scaled view of your model, you need to set things up prop-
erly in your modeling window before you begin the export process. You
need to be in Parallel Projection view, and you have to be using one of
the standard views from the Camera menu. I talk all about this in the
sidebar “Setting up for scaled drawings,” earlier in this chapter. Keep in
mind that unless you’re set up properly, this option will be grayed out.
 In Drawing and In Model: If you’re exporting a scaled drawing, and you
haven’t chosen the Full Scale option (see the previous point), you can
set your drawing’s scale using these controls. If you’re not set up to
export at scale, these settings won’t be available. As an example, for a
drawing at 1⁄16-inch scale, you would do the following:
• Enter 1” in the In Drawing box
• Enter 16’ in the In Model box
 Width and Height: You can use these settings to determine the dimen-
sions of your exported drawing, as long as you’re not printing to scale.
Profile Lines
This is where you control how profile lines in your SketchUp model view are
exported. You have the following options:
 None: Exports profiles the same thickness as all your other edges.
 Polylines with Width: Exports profiles as polylines, which are a differ-
ent kind of line object in CAD programs.
 Wide Line Entities: Exports profiles as thicker lines.
 Width: You can enter your own line thickness for exported profiles, or
you can select the Automatic check box to tell SketchUp to match what
you see in your modeling window.
 Separate on a Layer: Puts your profiles on a separate layer in the exported
file. This is handy for being able to quickly select all your profiles and give
them a line weight when you open your exported file in a CAD program.
337
Chapter 14: Exporting to CAD, Illustration, and Other Modeling Software

Section Lines
Section lines occur where section planes create section cuts in your model.
Traditionally, these lines are thick, which is why SketchUp gives you special
control over how they export. The options in this section are identical to
those for exporting section lines in the PDF/EPS Export Options dialog box.
Have a look at the section “Section Lines (Windows only),” earlier in this
chapter, for information on what everything in this part of the dialog box means.
Extension Lines
Extensions are the little line overruns you can choose to display in the Styles
dialog box. If you want to include them in your exported file, you can. Just select
the Show Extensions check box, and then either enter a length or select the
Automatic check box to let SketchUp try to match how they look on your
screen. Just so you know, extension lines are exported as lots and lots of tiny,
individual edge segments.
If you’re using the Windows version of SketchUp, you have an extra option in
this dialog box: Always Prompt for Hidden Line Options. This just means
“Do you always want to see this dialog box when you’re exporting to DXF or
DWG?” Selecting this check box reminds you to look at these settings every
time you export, so I’d go ahead and do it.
Peeking at EPIX
You only need to use the EPIX file format if you’re using Piranesi, a great artis-
tic rendering program that you can buy. Basically, EPIX is kind of a hybrid,
strange-o raster format that keeps track of pixels, just like other raster for-
mats. But it also remembers another piece of information: the depth of each
pixel in your scene. If you have a tree in the foreground, the pixels that make
up that tree “know” they’re, say, three feet away. Cool stuff, to be sure.

It slices, it dices. . . .
SketchUp’s Section Plane tool is pretty neat. If
you don’t know much about it, check out
Chapter 10. If you have a section cut in your
model that you’d like to export to a CAD pro-
gram, you’re in luck; just follow these steps:
1. Make sure that the section cut you’d like to
export is active.
2. Choose File➪Export➪Section Slice.
3. Click the Options button to open the
Section Slice Export Options dialog box.
4. Set the export options the way you want
them, and then click the OK button.
5. Click the Export button.

Chapter 14: Exporting to CAD, Illustration, and Other Modeling Software
The most important part of the Export Options
dialog box is right at the top: You need to choose
either True Section or Screen Projection. Have
a look at the following figure to see what hap-
pens when you choose each. Chances are,
you’ll want to pick True Section; it yields the
most useful information. The top image is a
screen shot of my modeling window in
SketchUp. The lower-left image shows what a
file export as a true section looks like in
AutoCAD. The lower-right image is an AutoCAD
view of the same file exported as a screen pro-
jection. For a description of the controls in the

doohickeys do:
 Image Size: This part of the Export Epx Options dialog box is just like
the Export Options dialog boxes you use for exporting 2D raster images
(like JPEG, TIFF, and PNG). I give a full rundown on what everything
means, and how to set things up properly, in Chapter 13.
 Export Edges check box: Choose this option to export the edge-render-
ing settings you currently have applied to your model.
 Export Textures check box: Piranesi can do some pretty terrific things
with the textures you apply in SketchUp; select this check box to export
those textures as part of your EPIX file. Just a note: You need to have a
style applied to your model that displays textures for those textures to
be exported properly.
 Export Ground Plane check box: Exports a ground plane in your model
view, regardless of whether a ground plane is in your currently applied
style.
Exporting 3D Data for Other Software
To be perfectly frank, I’ve been dreading having to write this part of this
book since I started. The process of exporting 3D data from any program to
any program is fraught with equal parts mystery and despair. There are so
many pieces of software, with so many versions, and so many different
file types that finding a “step-by-step” recipe for success is practically 
impossible. The simple truth is that 3D file export from SketchUp Pro is
about 50 percent knowing where to start and 90 percent trial and error
after that.

Gathering your marbles (so that 
you don’t lose them later)
I’ll focus on the “knowing where to start” part. First, I provide a list of 3D file
types that you can export with SketchUp Pro — I hope you can use it to make
some decisions about which format you should use. Second, I lay out a gen-
eral procedure for how to export a 3D model from SketchUp Pro.
Examining your 3D file format options
“Alphabet soup” is how some people describe the world of file types that
exist for 3D models. Here’s a bit of information about the 3D file formats that
SketchUp Pro 6 can export:
 DAE (Collada): Every couple of years or so, a new 3D file format comes
out that promises to be “the one.” More capable than 3DS (which is get-
ting on in years), Collada is being adopted all over the place by 3D soft-
ware and gaming companies; Google has even chosen Collada as the file
format for the 3D buildings in Google Earth. If you’re using a recent ver-
sion of any of the most popular 3D modeling programs, you might well
be able to deal with Collada files; you should try it and find out.
 DWG/DXF: “But aren’t these 2D formats?” I hear you asking. Yep, they are.
But ever since AutoCAD went 3D a few versions ago, its formats have gone
3D, too. These are a pretty safe bet for most of the CAD-type programs
out there, but not as safe a bet as 3DS. You need to know that, given the
choice between the DXF and DWG, you should usually pick the latter.
 3DS: This has become one of the few standard 3D file formats in the indus-
try. When in doubt, export a 3DS file and see whether your program can
open it. SketchUp Pro’s options for 3DS export are kind of complicated,
so be sure to have a look at the section about it later in this chapter.
 OBJ: OBJ is probably your best option for sending your data to Maya,
which is now owned by Autodesk. While it doesn’t offer some important
things that 3DS does, it’s still a pretty common 3D format.
 XSI: The folks at SketchUp built XSI export into SketchUp Pro so that it
would be more useful to people who use Softimage, a nifty modeling/
rendering/animation program from Canada.
 VRML: Though it’s getting on in years, plenty of people still use VRML to
exchange 3D information.
 FBX: The FBX format is used primarily by people in the entertainment
industry who use Maya, 3ds Max, or Autodesk VIZ. Depending on what
you’re doing, you might want to use it instead of DAE (Collada), 3DS, or
OBJ; try it and see whether you like it.
 KMZ: This is the Google Earth file format. Technically, the ability to
export KMZ files isn’t restricted to the Pro version of SketchUp; anyone
with regular, old free SketchUp can export them, too.
341
Chapter 14: Exporting to CAD, Illustration, and Other Modeling Software

A great place to go for help with exporting 3D files is the SketchUp Pro Forum.
The experts who hang out there have “been there and done that”; consulting
with them can save you hours of frustration. Check out Chapter 18 for more
information on this (and other) forms of further SketchUp edification.
Exporting your 3D model
The process of exporting your 3D data from SketchUp Pro is the same no
matter what file format you choose. Follow these steps to export a 3D model
from SketchUp Pro:
1. Choose File➪Export➪3D Model.
This opens the File Export dialog box.
2. Choose the file format you’d like to use from the Format drop-down list.
3. Choose a name and a location on your computer for your exported
image.
Whenever you’re exporting a 3D model from SketchUp, it’s a very good
idea to create a new folder for your exported file. A lot of the file formats
that SketchUp Pro exports save the textures in your model as separate
files alongside your model. If you don’t have everything in a single
folder, you can end up with a big mess.
4. Click the Options button.
This opens the Export Options dialog box for the file format you chose
in Step 2. Check out the sections in the rest of this chapter for more
information about all the controls in the Export Options dialog box —
they’re anything but intuitive.
5. Adjust the settings in the Options dialog box, and then click the OK
button.
This closes the Export Options dialog box.
6. Click the Export button to export your 3D model file.

Keep an eye out for plugins
Sometimes, two software companies figure out
that they have a large number of users in
common, and set out to make it easier for these
users to transfer files back and forth between
their products. These file-exchanging solutions
are usually called plug-ins, because they’re little
pieces of software code that you can download
and install (plug in) separately. Some handy
plug-ins are available for SketchUp Pro. If you’re
using ArchiCAD, MicroStation, VectorWorks,
Architectural Desktop, or ESRI ArcGIS, you should
check out Google’s SketchUp Plugins Web
page — they’re all there, and they’re free. It’s
worth visiting just to see what’s available. Go to
www.sketchup.com/downloadsand click
the SketchUp Plugins link at the top of the page.

Getting a handle on OBJ, FBX, 
XSI, and DAE (Collada)
I am pleased to report that the Export Options dialog boxes for each of the
aforementioned file formats are almost identical, even if the file formats
themselves aren’t — this means that I’m lumping them together into one 
section. Here are a few reminders about using OBJ, FBX, XSI, and DAE
(Collada):
 Try using Collada first. Because it’s relatively new, not all 3D programs
support it yet, but you never know — your software might.
 If Collada doesn’t work, use OBJ for Maya, XSI for Softimage, and FBX
if someone you respect tells you to. I’m sorry I can’t be more specific,
but the sheer number of programs and versions out there means that it’s
impossible to give hard-and-fast rules.
 Experiment. Leave yourself some time to try exporting your model in
more than one format. Then open each one in your other piece of soft-
ware and see what works best.
Figure 14-4 shows the Export Options dialog boxes for all four file formats.
Here’s some help with what everything does:
 Export Only Current Selection: Tells SketchUp Pro to only export the
geometry you currently have selected in your model.
 Triangulate All Faces: Some programs don’t support faces with cutouts
in them, so selecting this check box carves things into triangles so that
you don’t end up with any holes. Experimentation will tell you whether
you need to use this; don’t choose this option if you don’t have to.
 Export Two-Sided Faces: SketchUp’s faces are two-sided, but not all 3D
programs’ faces are. Choose this option if you’ve spent a lot of time 
texture-mapping (painting with textures) your model in SketchUp, and
you want it to look the same in the program you’re sending it to. If you
plan to use another piece of software to add textures to your model,
don’t select this check box.
 Export Edges: SketchUp models must include edges and faces, but some
programs’ models only support the latter. Select this check box if you
want to export the edges in your model; leave it deselected if you don’t.
Programs that don’t support edges (and that includes most of them)
will leave them out, anyway. The Export Edges option isn’t available for
FBX files.
 Export Texture Maps: Includes the textures you used in your SketchUp
model in the exported file. If you plan to “paint” your model in another
program, deselect this check box.
343
Chapter 14: Exporting to CAD, Illustration, and Other Modeling Software

 Generate Cameras from Pages (Scenes): The Collada file format can
store information about different views of your model. Selecting this
check box exports each of your scenes (if you have any) as a separate
camera object. Note that this option doesn’t exist for OBJ, FBX, or XSI.
 Swap YZ Coordinates (Y Is Up): If your model ends up oriented the
wrong way when you open it in another piece of software, try selecting
this check box and exporting it again. Some programs set up their axes
differently. This option isn’t available for Collada.
 Units: Leave this option on Model Units unless something is wrong when
you open your model in another program. If it is, make an adjustment
and export again.

Wrapping your head around 3DS
Ah, 3DS — the Old Faithful of 3D modeling file formats. 3DS is almost a shoo-
in to work with just about any other piece of 3D software you’re using, which
is good. What’s bad is that this flexibility comes at (what I perceive to be) a
terrible price: a seemingly infinite number of options. Here are some things
you should know about the 3DS file format:
 You’ll lose your layers. 3DS doesn’t support ’em, so you might be better
off exporting a DWG file (if your other software can open it and if you
aren’t using textures). Another option is to use the Color by Layers
option, which I describe in a moment.
 You’ll lose your edges, too. You can always choose Export Stand Alone
Edges, but few people recommend doing that.
 Only visible faces get exported. None of your hidden faces, or faces on
hidden layers, will go along for the 3DS ride, so make sure that you can
see everything you want to export before you reach for the File menu.
 Make sure that you paint the correct side of your faces. Faces (or the
equivalent) in 3DS are one-sided, so only materials you apply to the front
side of your faces in SketchUp will end up getting exported. I talk a little
bit about making sure that you’re working on the fronts of your faces in
Chapter 11, because Google Earth has the same issues. If you have mate-
rials on both sides of your faces, you might consider choosing the
Export Two-Sided Faces option, described later in this section.
Figure 14-5 shows the 3DS Export Options dialog box in all its complicated
glory. Your options are as follows:
 Export: You have four choices here:
• Full Hierarchy: This option tells the 3DS exporter to make sepa-
rate meshes (surfaces made out of triangles) for each “chunk” of
geometry in your SketchUp model. Chunks are things like groups,
components, and groupings of connected faces.
• By Layer: This option tells the exporter to create separate meshes
based on two things: chunks of geometry and what layer things are
on. If a bunch of faces are connected and they’re on the same layer,
they get exported as a single mesh.
• By Material: When you choose this option, you get a separate
mesh for each grouping of connected geometry that shares the
same material.
• Single Object: Choosing this option exports all your geometry as
one, big 3DS mesh.
345
Chapter 14: Exporting to CAD, Illustration, and Other Modeling Software

 Export Only Current Selection: Only exports the geometry you’ve
selected in your SketchUp model.
 Export Two-Sided Faces: Selecting this check box exports two faces
(back to back) for every face you have in your SketchUp model. Because
3DS supports only single-sided faces, this is necessary to preserve the
appearance of your textures in your exported model. If you don’t care
about preserving your SketchUp textures, or if you didn’t apply any in
the first place, don’t bother choosing this option:
• As Materials: Choose this option to export your back-side materi-
als as 3DS materials without corresponding geometry.
• As Geometry: Choose this option to export your extra set of faces
as actual geometry. Folks I know who do this a lot recommend that
you choose this option if you’re wondering what to do.
 Export Stand Alone Edges: 3DS doesn’t support edges the way
SketchUp does — you don’t have a good way to export edges as “lines”
to 3DS. When you select this check box, the exporter substitutes a long,
thin rectangle for every edge in your model. The appearance is (sort of)
the same, but this can cause major problems in your file. I don’t recom-
mend selecting this check box. If you really need to be able to see your
edges, you should probably try another export format altogether.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

 Export Texture Maps: If you have photo textures in your model (this
includes the photo textures from the Materials dialog box), you might
want to include them in your exported model file. 3DS handles these tex-
tures very differently than SketchUp does, so you have to decide on an
export method:
• Favor Preserving Texture Coordinates: Choose this option if
you’ve spent a lot of time getting the texture “maps” right in your
SketchUp model.
• Favor Welding Vertices: Choose this option if it’s more important
that your geometry export as accurately as possible. In some
cases, your textures won’t look right, but your geometry will be
correctly welded (stuck together) and smoothed.
 Use “Color by Layer” Materials: Because the 3DS file format doesn’t
support layers, you can choose to export your model with different
colors assigned to the faces on each layer in SketchUp.
 Generate Cameras from Pages (Scenes): Select this check box to export
your file with a different camera position saved for each scene in your
SketchUp file. An extra scene (called Default Scene) is also exported to
reflect your current model view.
 Units: If you leave this set to Model Units, most other 3D programs will
understand what you mean — your geometry will appear the right size
when you open your exported 3DS file. In some cases, it won’t, and the
best thing to do is to manually choose the units that you’ll be using in
the other program. Sometimes this doesn’t work either, and you’ll just
have to fiddle around until something works. Hooray for 3DS!
Dealing with VRML
The VRML file format is pronounced vermal, which ties it with Collada for the
title of Hardest Format to Use in Everyday Conversation without Giving Away
the Fact That You’re Nerdy Enough to Know What VRML and Collada Mean.
Virtual Reality Modeling Language is used by a large number of people around
the world. There are newer, arguably better, formats out there, but VRML’s
been around long enough that it’s tightly integrated into lots of professional
workflows.
Figure 14-6 shows the VRML Export Options dialog box; what follows is some
help with all the controls:
347
Chapter 14: Exporting to CAD, Illustration, and Other Modeling Software

 Output Texture Maps: If you don’t select this check box, you’ll get
colors instead of textures in your exported VRML file.
 Ignore Back of Face Material: Go ahead and select this check box
unless your faces have different materials painted on either sides of
them.
 Output Edges: VRML supports edges, so select this check box if you
want to export your edges (along with your faces) as part of your
VRML file.
 Use “Color by Layer” Materials: VRML doesn’t do layers, so if your
layers are important to you, you should consider selecting this check
box. All the faces in your exported model will be painted with the colors
in the Layers dialog box (Chapter 5 has more information on assigning
colors to layers).
 Use VRML Standard Orientation: You should select this check box to
convert your model’s “up” axis to match VRML’s “up” axis.
 Generate Cameras: If you have scenes in your SketchUp model, you
might want to select this check box. It tells the exporter to create a sepa-
rate camera view for every one of your scenes, and an extra one for your
current view.
 Allow Mirrored Components: If you have components in your model
whose instances you’ve mirrored (flipped over), you should select this
check box. Because this is a standard technique for building symmetri-
cal things like vehicles (as I talk about in Chapter 6), this might apply to
your model.
 Check for Material Overrides: This option makes sure that the materi-
als in your exported model end up looking like they do in your SketchUp
model.

Handling DWG and DXF (in 3D)
As 3D file formats go, these two are a little anemic. You should use them if
you need to export your 3D data to AutoCAD, but for other programs, you’re
probably better off getting the right plug-in (see the sidebar “Keep an eye out
for plugins,” earlier in this chapter). Here are a couple of tidbits about DXF
and DWG:
 Say goodbye to materials. Your materials won’t export to DXF/DWG, so
pick another format if they’re important to you.
 We’ll always have layers. The one great thing about exporting to
DXF/DWG is that you get to keep your layers.
 Go with DWG. If you can, pick DWG instead of DXF; it’s more robust,
which means that it saves more of your data.
Figure 14-7 is a screen shot of the AutoCAD Export Options dialog box; it’s an
oasis of blissful simplicity compared to the one for 3DS. In fact, it’s so self-
explanatory that I won’t bother going through the options one at a time. Just
select the kinds of things you want to export, and then click the OK button.

Creating Presentation Documents
with LayOut
In This Chapter
 Finding out what LayOut is for
 Figuring out where everything is (and what it does)
 Looking at what makes LayOut unique
 Building a simple presentation document from scratch
 Printing and exporting your work
P
eople who design things in 3D have to present their ideas to other people,
and most of the time, they have to present in a 2D format. Creating these
presentations almost always involves the use of layout or illustration software
like InDesign, Illustrator, or QuarkXPress; these programs are great, but they
can be expensive and tricky to get the hang of, especially if you’re not a graphic
designer.
If you’re lucky enough to have the Pro version of Google SketchUp 6, you
have access to a whole separate piece of software called Google SketchUp
LayOut, or LayOut for short.
LayOut is a program that lets you create documents for presenting your 3D
SketchUp models, both on paper and on-screen. LayOut was designed to be
easy to use, quick to learn, and tightly integrated with SketchUp. The people
who built it want you to use LayOut to create all your design presentations;
here are some examples of what you can make:
 Information sheets
 Storyboards
 Design packs
 Presentation boards and posters
 Banners
 On-screen, PowerPoint-style slide shows

LayOut gives you the tools to create cover pages, title blocks, callouts, and
symbols — whatever you need to accompany views of your model. You can
create presentations that are any physical size, and you can export them as
PDF files to send to other people. Best of all, when your design changes in
SketchUp, the views you’ve placed in LayOut update automatically to reflect
the changes. If you make your living designing and presenting ideas in 3D,
LayOut can save you boatloads of time.
In this chapter, I give a pretty high-level overview of what you can do with
LayOut — there’s a lot of information to convey, after all. I start out with a
couple of pages about the different things you can use LayOut to accomplish.
I follow that up with a quick tour of the LayOut user interface, explaining
where everything is and what it’s supposed to do. Next, I take you through
the process of creating a simple presentation drawing set from one of your
SketchUp models — not exhaustively by any means, but it should be enough
to see you through a tight deadline.
Getting Your Bearings
Even though LayOut comes with SketchUp Pro, it’s not just a SketchUp 
feature — LayOut is a full-fledged, gets-its-own-icon program. As such, LayOut
has its own menus, tools, dialog boxes, and Drawing Window. A couple of 
versions from now, LayOut will probably have its own For Dummies book.
(Maybe I’ll even get to write it!)
Even though LayOut’s user interface is pretty standard, I want to give you 
a quick overview of the different elements. Knowing that it’s a lot like other
software you’ve used (including SketchUp) should help you come up to
speed quickly. Figure 15-1 shows the LayOut user interface. The following 
sections explain the various parts in more detail.
Some menu bar minutiae
Just like almost every other piece of software in the universe, LayOut has a
menu bar. And just like SketchUp, you can use LayOut’s menu bar to access
the vast majority of its tools, commands, settings, and dialog boxes. Here’s a
brief description of each of LayOut’s nine menus:
 File: No big surprises here — you use the items in the File menu to
create new LayOut files, save and adjust settings for the document
you’re working on, and insert SketchUp and other graphics files.
 Edit: You use the items in the Edit menu to copy and paste, work with clip-
ping masks (LayOut’s version of cropping), and control object grouping.
352
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

In the Windows version of LayOut, the Edit menu includes Preferences,
which is where you can do some things to customize LayOut.
 View: Besides standard stuff like controls for zooming, the most interest-
ing item here is Full Screen, which lets you view your LayOut as a
PowerPoint-style slide presentation.
 Text: Fifty bonus points if you can figure out what the items in the Text
menu are for — there’s nothing out of the ordinary here.
 Arrange: Because LayOut documents are basically well-organized collec-
tions of images, inserted SketchUp models, text, and callouts, you need
to be able to control everything’s place on the page. In the Arrange
menu, you find commands for controlling the horizontal, vertical, and
stacking-order position of every element in your document, as well as
controls for telling LayOut what snap settings to use.
Stacking order refers to the fact that all elements on the same layer in
your document are either in front of or behind other elements. When
one thing is overlapping another, their stacking order determines which
one you see and which one is hidden.
Snap settings help you position elements on your page by making it
easier to line things up with a grid or with other elements. Depending 
on what you’re trying to do, you might choose to work with both kinds
of snap settings, just one, or none at all; I usually switch between them
while I’m working.
 Tools: Here’s where you’ll find all of LayOut’s tools (big surprise); there
are a lot more of them than you think. Luckily, most are pretty special-
ized, so you don’t need to know them all before you get started.
 Pages: Given the complexity of most of the software we all have to use,
it’s almost adorable how few items live in the Pages menu. Your LayOut
presentation can have many pages, and here’s where you add, delete,
duplicate, and move among them.
 Window: In the Window menu, you find links to all of LayOut’s dialog
boxes; take a look at the next section in this chapter for a rundown on
all of them.
 Help: Just like SketchUp, the Help menu should be the first and last
place you go when you’re stuck. It’s also a great place to look for
resources (besides this book) that can help you get started; I highly 
recommend watching the video tutorials — they’re great.
 LayOut (Mac only): The Mac version of LayOut includes a LayOut menu,
which is standard operating procedure for Mac applications. The impor-
tant thing in this menu is Preferences, which lets you set up the program
the way you want it.
353
Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

A dialog box discourse
You can find most of LayOut’s knobs and switches in its eight dialog boxes. 
In Windows, most of LayOut’s dialog boxes are contained in a “tray” that
appears on the right side of your screen by default. On the Mac, your dialog
boxes float around willy-nilly, but you can “snap” them together if you want.
Here’s a one-minute description of each:
 Colors: Just about all your LayOut documents will use color in some
way, so you’ll need this dialog box most of the time. The nice thing
about Color is that it appears when you need it; clicking any color well
in LayOut pops it open (if it wasn’t already open).
To hide a dialog box without closing it, click its title bar once to minimize
it. Click again to see the whole thing.
 Shape Style: A lot of the graphic elements in your presentation can have
color fills and strokes (outlines). The Shape Style dialog box is where
you control the appearance of those fills and strokes. Check out the
options in the Start and End drop-down menus — you won’t find callout
styles like these in most other layout programs.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

 SketchUp Model: The greatest thing about LayOut (at least with respect
to other software like it) is its ability to include 2D views of your
SketchUp models. In the SketchUp Model dialog box, you can control 
all sorts of things about the way your “placed” SketchUp model looks,
including camera views, scenes, styles, shadows, and fog. For folks who
spend a lot of time laying out presentation drawings that include
SketchUp models, the SketchUp Model dialog box is a godsend.
 Text Style: If you’ve ever used another piece of page layout or illustra-
tion software, you should be pretty familiar with what the Text Style
dialog box lets you do. You use it to control the font, size, style, color,
and alignment of text in your document.
 Pages: You use the Pages dialog box to manage the pages in your docu-
ment. You can add, delete, and rearrange them to your heart’s content.
The List and Icon buttons at the top let you toggle between views of
your pages; I prefer to use the former and give my pages meaningful
names as I work. The little icons on the right control visibility for shared
layers and full-screen presentations.
Shared layers are somewhat unique to LayOut; they let you automatically
place elements on more than one page. For more detail, see the section
“Simplifying Layout with Layers and Master Layers,” later in this chapter.
 Layers: You can have multiple layers of content in every LayOut docu-
ment you create.
I like to work with at least four layers, organizing content on each as 
follows:
• Elements that should appear in the same place on almost every
page, like logos and project titles
• Things that appear in the same place on most pages, but that
change from page to page, like numbers and page titles
• Content (like images and SketchUp model views) that only appears
on a single page
• Unused stuff that I’m not sure I want, but that I don’t want to delete
Use the Layers dialog box to add, delete, and rearrange layers in your
document. The icons on the right let you hide (and show), lock, and
share individual layers.
 Scrapbooks: This one’s a little trickier to explain; scrapbooks are unique
to LayOut, so you probably haven’t worked with anything like them
before. Scrapbooks are LayOut files that live in a special folder on your
computer system. They contain colors, text styles, and graphic elements
(like scale cars, trees, and people) that you might need to use in more
than one of your LayOut documents. To use something you see in a
scrapbook, just click it, and then click again in your Drawing Window to
“stamp” it in.
355
Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

You can create your own scrapbooks if you want. Just choose File➪Save
as Scrapbook from the menu bar to save any LayOut file as a scrapbook
that will show up in your Scrapbooks dialog box.
 Instructor: The Instructor dialog box works just like it does in SketchUp;
it shows information on whichever tool you happen to be using. If you’re
just starting out with LayOut, make sure that this dialog box is open.
Setting up LayOut preferences
In LayOut, as in SketchUp, you have two kinds of preferences to worry about:
those that apply to every LayOut document you work on and those that only
apply to the document you happen to be working on at the moment. Settings
for the former are made in the Preferences dialog box; controls for the latter
reside in Document Setup. The following sections describe what I mean.
Preferences
The LayOut Preferences dialog box is made up of six panels. You open it by
choosing Edit➪Preferences in Windows or LayOut➪Preferences on the Mac.
Here’s what you’ll find on each panel:
 Applications: Tell LayOut what programs you want to use to edit image
and text files when you right-click them (in LayOut) and choose Open
with Image (or Text) Editor from the context menu.
 Backup: Work smart by letting LayOut auto-save and create automatic
backups of your file. Here’s where you tell it where and how often to do so.
 Folders: Let LayOut know where to look for the templates and scrap-
books on your computer. Templates show up when you start LayOut or
open a new document; scrapbooks appear in the Scrapbook dialog box.
 Scales: This is a list of scales you can choose from for a SketchUp model
view you’ve placed in your LayOut document. If you want to use a cer-
tain drawing scale and it doesn’t show up in the Scales pane of the
SketchUp Model dialog box, feel free to add it here. This is not the draw-
ing scale for the document you’re currently working on, so don’t worry
about that.
 Shortcuts: Just like SketchUp, you use this panel to define a keyboard
shortcut for any tool or command in LayOut.
 Startup: In this panel, tell LayOut how to behave every time you launch it.
Document Setup
The Document Setup dialog box includes five panels. You open it by choosing
File➪Document Setup in the menu bar. Here’s the skinny on each panel:
356
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

 General: Feel free to enter information about yourself and your document;
this might be important if you’re working on a team.
 Grid: Nothing beats a grid for helping to line up elements in your presen-
tations. Use the options in this panel to control the visibility, size, and
“snapability” of the grid in your document, if you want one. For Show
Major, type in an interval for the darker grid lines. For Show Minor, enter
the number of divisions between dark lines you’d like to have. For 1⁄4-inch
squares, you would enter 1 inch for the former and 4 for the latter.
 Paper: Here’s where you tell LayOut the size of the sheet of paper you’d
like to use for your document. You can also control the width of your
margins and the resolution at which you’d like your SketchUp model
views to print. See the section “Creating a new, blank document,” later 
in this chapter, for a list of recommended resolutions.
 References: When you insert a SketchUp model or an image in your
LayOut document, LayOut creates a file reference that keeps track of
where it came from.
If you edit the original file (which you probably will), this panel lets you
know whether LayOut is showing the most currently saved version. For
people who go back and forth between design and presentation documents
a lot (sound familiar?), the References panel is a gift from the heavens.
 Units: Depending on where you live and work, you might use a different
system of measurement. Use the Units panel to pick the right one for
your workflow.
Tooling around
LayOut has lots of tools, but as with most software, you spend most of your
time with only a handful of them. You can find the complete list in the Tools
menu, but it’s easier to get at them on the toolbar. This strip, across the top
of your Drawing Window, includes icons for the most commonly used tools
(and commands), but you can easily add others if you want to. Here’s a bullet
point on each of the tools in the LayOut toolbar’s default set. (See Figure 15-2,
which shows the toolbar for the Windows version of LayOut.)

Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

 Select: Select, rotate, and scale elements in your document. Double-click
to edit text.
 Eraser: Click or drag over any unlocked elements to erase them.
 Style: Click any element to sample (soak up) its fill, stroke, and other
attributes. Doing so turns the tool into the Bucket, which you use to apply
those attributes to other elements in your document by clicking them.
 Split: Cut one line segment (whether curved or straight) into two by
clicking where you want the split to occur. Turning Object Snap on (in
the Arrange menu) is very helpful for splitting shapes at their corners.
 Join: Turn two line segments (curved or straight) into a single one by
clicking each in turn. Both are highlighted blue when they’re joined.
 Line: Draw a straight line by clicking to define start points and end-
points. Press Esc to stop drawing a line.
 2-Point Arc (Windows): Draw an arc by clicking once to define one end,
again to define the other, and a third time to define the bulge, or curvature.
 Arc with Center (Mac): Draw an arc by clicking once to define the arc’s
center point, again to start the arc (which defines its radius), and a third
time to end the arc. You can draw an arc in two ways; check out the
Tools menu to see all of them.
 Rectangle: Draw a rectangle by clicking to define opposite corners.
 Circle: Draw a circle by clicking once to define a center and again to
define a radius.
 Polygon: Draw polygons by first entering a side count and then using your
mouse. Select the Polygon tool, type the number of sides followed by the
letter s (8s for an octagon), and then press Enter. Now click once with your
mouse to define a center point and again to draw the shape. Whew.
 Text: Draw an empty text box into which you can enter text. If you need
to select text you’ve already typed, double-click it with the Select tool.
 Label: Draw a text label with a leader line by clicking to define the end of
the line (where it’s pointing), clicking again to define the beginning, and
then typing in some text.
 Add Page: Add a page after the one you’re on.
 Previous Page: View the previous page in your document.
 Next Page: View the next page in your document.
Adding more tool icons to your toolbar is easy; just right-click the toolbar
and choose Customize to bring up the Customize dialog box.

Getting Set Up
Every time you launch LayOut, and every time you choose File➪New, you’re
presented with a dialog box that asks you how you want to start out. (See
Figure 15-3.)
The theory is that when you open most programs, you usually want to do
one of two things:
 Start a new document: The New tab at the top of the dialog box presents
you with a list of templates that come preloaded in LayOut. There’s noth-
ing special about these templates — they’re just ready-made LayOut files
you can use as a starting point for your presentation. Expand the items in
the list on the left to see the available templates broken down by category.
 Open a document you’ve already started: Click the Recent tab at the
top of the dialog box to show a list of LayOut files you’ve worked on
most recently. Select one and click the Choose button to open it. To
open an existing document that doesn’t appear in the Recent list, click
the Open an Existing File button to pop up the Open dialog box.

Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
Switching to LayOut from similar software
If you’re used to using other page-layout or
illustration software, some things about LayOut
are useful to know when you’re just getting
started. The folks who designed LayOut did
things a little differently on purpose, hoping to
do for page layout in 2007 what they did for 3D
design seven years earlier — make it easier for
motivated people with no experience to pro-
duce good work, quickly.
Here, I point out the five things you should keep
in mind when you’re exploring LayOut:
 LayOut includes templates that help you get
up and running in no time. See the nearby
section “Starting out with templates” for
details.
 You can insert models from SketchUp, skip-
ping the process of exporting your model as
an image file. Importing has the added ben-
efit of helping you automatically update
model views in your presentation. See the
section “Bringing In Everything You Need,”
later in this chapter, for details.
 The Layers feature in LayOut is a powerful
tool for organizing your content. In particu-
lar, you can place content that appears on
more than one of your pages on a master
layer, so you only have to position it once.
The section “Simplifying Layout with Layers
and Master Layers,” later in this chapter,
outlines just what you need to know.
 In LayOut, you have enormous flexibility to
crop images, including model views, with
ease using clipping masks. The section
“Cropping with clipping masks,” later in this
chapter, explains how in four easy steps.
 When your presentation is ready to go,
LayOut enables you to set up digital slide
shows in full-screen mode, as well as to
create printouts and PDF files.

Sometimes you see a third tab in your Getting Started dialog box: Recovered.
If LayOut has crashed on you, or if you ever had any LayOut files that weren’t
saved when things went awry, the document you were working on should
show up in the Recovered tab. It’s still a good idea to save often, though.
Starting out with templates
More often than not, you can find a template to use as a starting point for
your presentation. Browse the list, select one you like, and click the Choose
button to begin working with a template. You can also create a custom tem-
plate, as I explain in a moment. In my experience, templates are the quickest
way to get up and running with a new LayOut project.
Here are a few things you should know about templates (while I’m on the 
subject); Figure 15-4 points them out in a screen shot:
 Pay attention to the layers. Many of the templates that come with
LayOut have multiple layers, and some of these layers are locked by
default. They’re locked so that you can’t accidentally move things
around, but you can always unlock them if you need to. In the Layers
dialog box, click the lock icon to lock or unlock a layer; knowing you need
to unlock a layer is especially handy when you want to swap in your logo
instead of using the generic “Logo Design” that comes preinstalled.
 Have a look at the pages. Most of the more interesting templates
include at least two pages; the first one’s a cover page. Don’t forget 
to look at the all the pages when you’re working with a template.
Figure 15-3:
The Getting
Started
dialog box.
360
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

 Double-click to edit text. One of the really neat things about LayOut 
is that you can edit text on locked layers. Using the Select tool, just
double-click any text you want to edit (and in some templates, you’ll
want to edit all the text), type in new text, and then click once some-
where else to finish the edit.
 Feel free to change colors. LayOut’s templates are designed so that you
can easily change the overall color scheme. Just unlock all the layers,
open the Shape Styles dialog box, and go nuts. For more information
about changing colors, see the section “Drawing something from
scratch,” later in this chapter.
Most of the design presentations that you (or your firm) put together proba-
bly look a lot alike — after all, they’re part of your brand identity. If the 
presentation documents you make are all variations on a couple of themes,
why not build your own templates and use them every time you need to 
start a new project? You can set things up so that your templates appear 
in the Getting Started dialog box, making it easier to build consistent presen-
tations, quicker.

Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

Follow these steps to turn any LayOut file into a template:
1. Build a LayOut file that includes all the elements you want.
These elements might include a title block, a logo, a page number, and a
cover page.
Make sure that you’re viewing the page you want to use as the thumb-
nail preview in the template list, before you move on to Step 2.
2. Choose File➪Save as Template.
The Save as Template dialog box opens.
3. Type a name for your template.
4. Choose a location for your new template.
In the list at the bottom of the dialog box, click the folder (they’re all
folders) in which you want to include the template you’re adding.
5. Click the Save button.
The next time the Getting Started dialog box appears, your new template
will be in it.
Creating a new, blank document
If you decide not to start with one of LayOut’s handy-dandy templates, you’ll
need to set up a new document from scratch.
Follow these steps to create a fresh, new LayOut document:
1. Launch LayOut.
Keep in mind that LayOut and SketchUp are separate software programs,
so you need to launch them individually. If you’ve already launched
LayOut, choose File➪New to open the Getting Started dialog box.
2. In the Getting Started dialog box, click the New tab.
This shows a list of available templates on the left, with thumbnail 
previews of each template on the right.
3. Click My Templates (All on the Mac) in the list on the left.
4. Select Blank Template on the right, and click the Choose button.
The blank template should be in the upper-left corner of the window, 
but if it isn’t, hunt around for it; it’s there somewhere.
When a new, blank document that you can set up however you like
appears, you then need to set up your new document the way you want it.
5. Choose File➪Document Setup.
This opens the Document Setup dialog box.
362
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

6. Click Units in the panel list on the left, and select the type of measure-
ment units you prefer to use, as shown in Figure 15-5.
The Units panel lets you choose which units you’d like to use.
7. Click Paper in the list on the left, and set your paper size and color.
If you know you’ll be printing on paper that isn’t white, you can simulate
the color by choosing one here. I don’t recommend trying to print out a
paper color; most printers don’t print full bleed (right to the edges), so
the effect really isn’t that great.
8. Set up some margins, if you want to.
Margins are useful if you know how close to the edge of your paper you
can print.
9. Set the rendering resolution according to your document size.
Basically, the rendering resolution you choose depends on the physical
size of your printed document. As long as your paper size isn’t any
bigger than 11 x 17 inches, you should probably choose 300 dpi. For
bigger presentations (like boards and posters), use a setting of 100 or
150 dpi. The goal is to limit the size of the file (in megabytes) that gets
sent to your printer — if it’s too big, things can get ugly. For more infor-
mation on image resolution, have a look at Chapter 13.
10. Click Grid in the list of panels on the left, and set up your grid options
the way you want them.
Now you’re in the Grid panel. For more information about this section of
the Document Setup dialog box, see the section “Getting Your Bearings,”
earlier in this chapter.
11. Click the Close button to close the Document Setup dialog box.

Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

Adding pages to your document
Follow these steps to add a few blank pages to your document:
1. Choose Window➪Pages.
This opens the Pages dialog box, if it wasn’t already open.
2. Choose Pages➪Add.
This adds a page to your document. You can also add pages by clicking
the little button that looks like a plus sign (in the upper-left corner of the
Pages dialog box). Add as many pages as you want.
3. In the Pages dialog box, double-click the name of your new page, and
then type in a name for it.
Press Enter when you’re done. Repeat to give all your pages meaningful
names.
Moving around your document
You move around on the pages in your document just like you do in 
SketchUp — except in 2D instead of 3D. Here’s how to move around:
 Panning: Hold down your scroll wheel button while moving your mouse
around to slide your page around in your Document Window. This is
called panning.
 Zooming: Roll your scroll wheel back and forth to zoom in and out on
your page. To fill your Document Window with the page you’re viewing,
choose Zoom to Fit from the Zoom drop-down list in your window’s
lower-right corner.
 Moving from page to page: Click the Next Page and the Previous Page
buttons on your toolbar to move among the pages in your document.
You can also click your pages’ names in the Pages dialog box.
Simplifying Layout with Layers 
and Master Layers
You use layers to create multipage documents with elements that are consis-
tent from page to page. You can have two different kinds of layers in LayOut:
 Unshared: Unshared layers are like layers in every other software pro-
gram. Any element (text, graphic, or otherwise) that you put on an
364
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

unshared layer exists only on one page: the page you’re on when you
put the element on the layer.
 Shared (Master Layers): LayOut introduces the notion of master layers;
anything you put on a master layer appears on every page of your docu-
ment, as long as those pages are set up to show master layers.
It’s all a little confusing at the beginning, so here are a few quick tips about
how you organize content on layers — including master layers — as you
create presentations in LayOut:
 You can make an element (like a logo) appear in the same spot on
more than one page by putting it on a master layer. For example, the
logo and the project title need to appear in the same spot on every page;
I put these two elements on the master layer called “On Every Page.” In
Figure 15-6, note how the logo and project title appear in exactly the
same place in the pages labeled B and C.
 Put content that appears on only one page on an unshared layer. Again,
in the pages labeled B and C, the image boxes and page titles are different
on each page, so I put them on the unshared layer called “Unique.”
 You can make any layer a master layer by clicking the Sharing icon to
the right of its name in the Layers dialog box. (See Figure 15-7.)
 You decide which pages should display master layers by toggling the
Sharing icon to the right of their names in the Pages dialog box. For
example, I don’t want the logo and the project title to be on the cover
page (labeled A in Figure 15-6). I toggle the Show Master Layers icon
beside the cover page to Off, as shown in Figure 15-7.
When you’re manipulating elements on individual layers in LayOut, keep
these points in mind:
 To add a new layer, click the plus sign icon in the Layers dialog box.
 To change which layer something’s on, select the destination layer in
the Layers dialog box, right-click the element you want to move, and
choose Move to Current Layer.
 To see what layer an element is currently on, look for the tiny blue dot
in the Layers dialog box. If you select two elements on two different
layers, you see two blue dots.
 To lock layers you’re not using, click the Lock icon. I know it’s annoying
to have to go and unlock a layer before you can modify its contents, but
it’s even more annoying to accidentally move the wrong things around,
or even delete them.
 To hide layers and improve your performance, make liberal use of 
the Hide icon next to the name of each layer; this can really improve
LayOut’s performance, especially on slower computers. Hide any layers
you’re not working with, and you’ll notice the difference.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

Bringing In Everything You Need
After you have your document set up the way you want it, you probably want
to start bringing in images. Some programs call this importing, and others call
it placing. LayOut calls it inserting.
Vive la différence!
You can insert two kinds of images into your LayOut documents:
 Raster images: This means TIFFs, JPEGs, and PNGs — these are all
graphics file formats that save pictures as lots of tiny dots.
Unfortunately, LayOut can’t insert vector images in its first version.
Check out Chapter 13 for a full description raster and vector images.
 SketchUp models: To get a SketchUp model view into your presentation,
LayOut lets you insert SketchUp model views directly into your document.
With every other page-layout program in the universe, the only way to
include a view of a SketchUp model is to export that view from SketchUp as
an image file, and then place it in the layout program. Changing the SketchUp
file means having to go through the whole process again, and if your presen-
tation includes lots of SketchUp model views, it can take hours.
This brings us to LayOut’s raison d’être: Instead of exporting views from
SketchUp to get them into LayOut, all you do is insert a SketchUp file. From
within LayOut, you can pick the view you like best. You can also use as many
views of the same model as you want. When your SketchUp file is modified,
LayOut knows about it and (using the References panel in the Document Setup
dialog box) lets you update all your views at once by clicking a single button.
In sections that follow, you find out the best tips and tricks for working with
models, as well as how to insert other images and text.
Inserting images and model views
Regardless of which kind of image you want to insert, the procedure is the
same; follow these steps to bring an image into your LayOut document:
1. Choose File➪Insert.
This opens the Insert dialog box.
2. Find the file on your computer that you want to insert, and click the
Open button.
This closes the Insert dialog box and places the image (or SketchUp
model) you chose on your current LayOut document page.
367
Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

3. Use the Select tool to resize your image.
You can resize an image by clicking and dragging any corner.
If your image is a TIFF, JPEG, or PNG file, hold down Shift while you drag
to resize proportionally; you probably don’t want to distort your image
by stretching it out. To resize an inserted SketchUp model view propor-
tionally, hold down Alt (Command on the Mac).
4. Use the Select tool to move your image around.
Click and drag to move any element in your document around on the page.
5. Use the Select tool to rotate your image, if you want to.
This is probably best explained with a picture; Figure 15-8 shows the
Rotate Circle (I call it the Steering Wheel) that shows up in front of any
element when you click to select it with the Select tool. You rotate an
element by clicking and dragging its Steering Wheel. To rotate about a
different point (a different center of rotation), just move the Steering
Wheel by clicking its center point and dragging it around.
See the next section for tips on working with inserted SketchUp model
views.

Working with inserted model views
Figure 15-9 shows a view of a LayOut drawing window with a SketchUp model
I inserted. The following are some things I think you should know:
 Double-click to change your view. When you’re using the Select tool,
double-clicking a SketchUp model view allows you to orbit, pan, and
zoom around your model. When you like what you see, click anywhere
outside the view to exit.
 Right-click ’til the cows come home. The key to working with SketchUp
models you’ve inserted into LayOut is to right-click them; this opens a
context menu full of useful options.
 Display your model views at scale. One of the options in the context
menu that pops up when you right-click on a model view is “Scale”. Click
on it, then choose a scale from the long list. Keep in mind that only non-
perspectival, orthographic model views can be displayed at a true scale.
Check out Chapter 12 for more information on this.
 Do your dimensioning in SketchUp. This may seem strange, but the
first-ever version of LayOut doesn’t have a way to add dimensions to
your drawings. Dimensions you add in SketchUp show up in LayOut,
though, so feel free to add them there.
 Create scenes in SketchUp to make life easier in LayOut. In the context
menu that appears when you right-click an inserted SketchUp model
view, you can pick a scene. This is incredibly convenient, because get-
ting just the right view is easier in SketchUp than it is in LayOut. If you
know which views you need, create scenes in SketchUp and then choose
them in LayOut. See Chapter 10 for details about creating scenes.
 Tweak your line weights. In the SketchUp Model dialog box, you find a
setting at the bottom called Line Weights. Reduce that number from 1.00
to 0.25 and you’ll like what happens — your inserted SketchUp models
will look a whole lot better.
 Don’t forget to check the document setup. When a SketchUp model
you’ve inserted is modified, LayOut knows about it — but it doesn’t auto-
matically update your views to reflect the changes. You have to do it your-
self: Choose File➪Document Setup and then click to open the References
panel. (See Figure 15-10.) Select each model view you want to update, and
then click the Update button.
While I’m talking about the References panel in Document Setup, I want
to mention the Purge button. Click it to dump references to external files
you’re not using anymore. It can’t hurt anything to click it, and doing so
reduces the size of your LayOut file and keeps it from getting corrupted.
369
Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

 Choose Open with SketchUp to avoid the Document Setup dialog 
box. Choosing Open with SketchUp from the right-click context menu
opens your model in SketchUp, where you can make any edits you want.
When you’re done, save your SketchUp file, and then come back to
LayOut; your view will have changed to reflect the edits you made in
SketchUp.
Inserting text
You can insert a third type of content into LayOut documents: text. This is
useful if the text you want to use is already typed, spell-checked, proofread,
and ready to present.
Insert a text file the same way you do an image, but keep in mind that it has
to be an RTF (Rich Text Format) file. To save your text in this format, just
paste it into any text editor (like Word or TextEdit) and save the file.

Presentation-Perfect Images
After you import content, it’s generally not quite presentation-ready. You 
may want to crop images or use the drawing tools to create an professional-
looking, well-organized layout. The following sections show you how.
Cropping with clipping masks
Cropping an image means reframing it so that you can only see part of it;
every page-layout program on the planet allows you to crop images, and 
each one insists that you do it a little differently. LayOut is no exception.
In LayOut, you use clipping masks to hide the parts of images that you don’t
want to see. Check out Figure 15-11 to see different clipping masks in action.
As the figure shows, you can turn any shape into a clipping mask. Follow
these steps to use a shape as a clipping mask:
1. Draw the shape you want to use as a clipping mask.
2. Make sure that it’s positioned properly over the image you want to crop.
Check to make sure your inserted images are current
Use these controls to manage your References

3. Use the Select tool to select both the clipping mask object and the
image you want to crop.
Hold down Shift while clicking to select more than one object.
4. Right-click the selected elements and choose Make Clip Mask from the
context menu.
Here are some fun facts about clipping masks in LayOut:
 Clipping masks work on inserted images. These include pictures and
SketchUp models that you place in your LayOut document.
 Deleting clipping masks is easy. To see a whole image again, you need
to “release” its clipping mask. Select the image and then choose
Edit➪Release Clipping Mask.
 Edit clipping masks by double-clicking them. When you double-click
a clipping mask, you can see the whole image and the shape you used
to create the mask. Now you can modify the shape, the image, or both.
Clicking somewhere else on your page exits the edit mode.

Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

Drawing something from scratch
LayOut includes a full slate of drawing tools that you can use to create logos,
title bars, north arrows, graphic scales — anything you want. The drawings
you create are vectors, meaning that you can do the following:
 Scale them without losing quality
 Change their fill and stroke (outline) colors
 Split lines and then rejoin them to make new shapes
Because I don’t know what you want to draw, a step list would be pretty
pointless here. Instead, here are a few pointers to get you started:
 Use the right kind of snaps. It’s easier to draw exactly what you want if
you let the software help a bit. Just like SketchUp, LayOut includes an
elaborate (but easy-to-use) inference system of red and green dots and
lines to help you line things up. LayOut also allows you to use a grid
(that you define) to help you keep things straight:
• Snap to objects: Choose Arrange➪Object Snap to turn on object
snapping; this gives you colored “hints” to help you draw.
• Snap to grid: Choose Arrange➪Grid Snap to turn on grid snapping.
Now your cursor automatically snaps to (is attracted to) the inter-
section of grid lines in your document — whether your grid is visi-
ble or not. See the section “Getting Your Bearings,” earlier in this
chapter, for more information on using grids in LayOut.
You can use any combination of snapping systems (Object or Grid) while
you’re working, but I prefer to use one or the other — it all depends on
what I’m trying to do. To save time, I assign a keyboard shortcut that
toggles each system on and off. (To do that, use the Shortcuts panel in
the Preferences dialog box, which you can find in the Edit menu — on a
Mac, it’s in the LayOut menu.)
 Build complex shapes out of simpler ones. I’ll use an example here:
Figure 15-12 shows how I would draw a simple arrow. You can follow
these steps to build one just like it:
1. Make sure that Grid Snap is turned off and Object Snap is turned on.
2. Draw a rectangle with the Rectangle tool.
3. Draw a triangle with the Polygon tool (Type in 3s and press Enter
before you start drawing to make sure that you’re drawing a trian-
gle). Hold down Shift to make sure that the bottom of the triangle
is a horizontal line.
4. Use the Select tool to select both shapes by holding down Shift as
you click them.
373
Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

5. Choose Arrange➪Align➪Vertically to line up the rectangle and the

Don’t forget that you can always use the Undo feature to go back a
step; it’s in the Edit menu whenever you need it.
6. Deselect both shapes by clicking once somewhere else on your page.

7. Select one of the shapes and move it up or down on the page (by
pressing the up- and down-arrow keys) until the two shapes overlap.
8. Use the Arc (with center) tool to draw a half-circle at the bottom of
the rectangle.
9. Using the Split tool, click and hold down each of the points of inter-
section in the figure; don’t let go until all the lines stop flashing
blue. Do this for all four intersection points to split the shapes into
a series of line segments.
10. Use the Join tool (it looks like a bottle of glue) to connect all the line
segments by clicking once on the “arrowhead” part, once on each
half of the “stem” part, and once on the half-circle. Now you have one
shape instead of three; verify this by clicking the shape once with the
Select tool. You should see one red “selected” rectangle around your
new shape. If you don’t have one shape, try using the Join tool again;
sometimes it takes a couple of tries to get things to work.
11. Move your new shape somewhere else, and then delete the left-
over lines segments you don’t need.
 Open the Shape Style dialog box. You use the Shape Style dialog box to
change the fill and stroke characteristics of elements in your document.
(See Figure 15-13.) In plain English, this is where you pick colors for the
things you draw. The controls are pretty straightforward, so you don’t
need much help from me; just experiment and see what happens.

Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

Life after LayOut
After you’ve created your LayOut document, you can do the following three
things:
 Print it
 Export it as a PDF file
 View it as a full-screen presentation
Simple, huh? The next three sections provide some more detail on each of
these options.
Printing your work
Follow these steps to print your LayOut document:
1. Choose File➪Page Setup.
In the Page Setup dialog box, choose a printer and a paper size and 
orientation.
2. Click the OK button to close the Page Setup dialog box.
3. Choose File➪Print.
In the Print dialog box, choose which pages to print and how many
copies you want.
4. Click the OK button to send your document to the printer you chose in
Page Setup.
Exporting a PDF file
Anyone with Adobe Reader software (which is free and is already loaded on
millions of computers) can look at a PDF document you create; all you have
to do is e-mail it to him or her. Follow these steps to export your LayOut doc-
ument as a PDF file:
1. Choose File➪Export.
This opens the Export dialog box.
2. Give your PDF file a name, and figure out where to save it on your
computer.
3. Click the Save button (in Windows) to open the PDF Export Options
dialog box (see Figure 15-14); click the Options button if you’re on a Mac.
376
Part IV: Sharing What You've Made 

4. Set the PDF options the way you want them.
Here’s what everything means:
• Pages: Choose which pages you want to export.
• Resolution: See the section “Creating a new, blank document,” ear-
lier in this chapter, for a brief discussion of resolution. Here’s a
good rule of thumb: For documents that are small enough to be
hand-held, I recommend a setting of 300 dpi. For anything bigger,
go with 150 dpi.
• Layers: PDFs can have layers, just like LayOut documents do. If it
makes sense to do so, you can export a layered PDF so that people
who view it can turn the layers on and off.
• Finish: Select this check box to view your PDF after it’s exported.
5. (Mac only) Click the OK button to close the PDF Options dialog box.
6. Click the Export button (Save button on a Mac) to export your docu-
ment as a PDF file.
Going full-screen
Many times, design presentations for clients go beyond printed boards and
booklets; they include a digital slide show that usually involves a few hours
of work in a program like PowerPoint or Keynote (if you’re on a Mac).
LayOut was designed to help you skip the PowerPoint step by letting you 
display your presentation in a full-screen view. You can move back and forth
between pages with the arrow keys on your computer, and you can even
double-click SketchUp model views to orbit them around. Follow these tips:

Chapter 15: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut

 Switching to full-screen mode takes less than a second. Choose View➪
Full Screen to view your presentation full-screen. Press Esc to exit full-
screen mode.
 Move from page to page. Use the left- and right-arrow keys to flip
through pages.
 Choose which pages to show full-screen. You can decide not to show
certain pages in full-screen mode by toggling the Full Screen icon to the
right of those page names in the Pages dialog box (make sure that you’re
in List view to be able to do this).
 Double-click to change your view of a SketchUp model. When you’re 
in full-screen mode, you can double-click any SketchUp model view to
orbit, zoom, and pan around inside it. Just use your mouse’s scroll wheel
button the same way you do in SketchUp. Click anywhere outside the
view to exit.
 Draw while you’re in full-screen mode. Try clicking and dragging while
you’re in full-screen mode; doing so lets you make red annotations right
on your presentation. If a client doesn’t like the porch you designed,
scrawl a big, red X over it to let him know you understand.
 Play scene animations right in full screen mode. You can right-click on
a model view with scenes that you’ve set up in SketchUp and choose
Play Animation. LayOut will transition from scene to scene, just like
SketchUp does. You can read more about scenes in Chapter 10.

et’s face it; everybody loves lists. The last part of this
book (and of every For Dummies book out there) is
dedicated to presenting useful information in short, bite-
sized chunks that you can read while you’re standing in
the elevator. Or using the bathroom. Or waiting for your
turn in the shower.
Chapter 16 is a list of the problems that every new SketchUp
user runs into — check here when you’re ready to pour acid
all over your keyboard and move to Amish country.
The list in Chapter 17 is mostly about promoting con-
sumerism, but it’s also handy if you’re wondering what else
is available that can improve the way you use SketchUp.
The last chapter in this book is, fittingly, about ten ways
that you can keep discovering more about SketchUp —
places to go, books to read, DVDs to watch. I’m a firm
believer that the best way to figure out anything is to see
it presented in more than one way, so I highly encourage
you to check out at least a couple of these resources.

Chapter 16
Ten SketchUp Traps and 
Their Work-arounds
In This Chapter
 Knowing why faces, colors, and edges aren’t behaving right
 Coping with a slow or crashing SketchUp
 Viewing your model the way you want
 Persuading components to budge
 Recovering from Eraser disasters
T
he bad news is that every single new SketchUp user encounters certain
problems, usually in his or her first couple of hours with the software. I
guess you could call them growing pains. The good news is that such pre-
dictability means that I can write a chapter that anticipates a lot of the bad
stuff you’ll go through. I can’t prevent it from happening, but I can help you
make sense of what’s going on so that you can get on with your life as quickly
as possible.
SketchUp Won’t Create a 
Face Where I Want It To
You’ve dutifully traced all around the boundary of where you’d like SketchUp
to create a face, but nothing’s happening. Try checking whether your edges
aren’t all on the same plane or whether one edge is part of a separate group
or component.
To check whether you have a component problem, try hiding groups or 
components and checking the edges to make sure that they’re all in the
group or component you think they’re in. See Chapter 5 for details.

However, 90 percent of the time, when SketchUp won’t create a face where
you think it should, an edge isn’t on the plane you think it’s on. To check
whether your edges are coplanar, draw an edge that cuts diagonally across
the area where you want a face to appear. If a face appears now, all your
edges are not on the same plane. To fix the problem, you have to figure out
which edge is the culprit. I call my favorite method for doing this the Color by
Axis method; Color Plate 20 shows images of the steps that I describe below:
1. In the Styles dialog box, change your edge color from All Same to 
By Axis.
See Chapter 8 for details. Doing this step tells SketchUp to draw the
edges in your model the color of the axis to which they’re parallel; 
edges parallel to the red axis will be red, and so on.
2. Look carefully at the edges you were hoping would define a face.
Are all the edges the color they’re supposed to be? If they’re not all 
supposed to be parallel to the drawing axes, this technique doesn’t do
much good. But if they are, and one (or more) of them is black (instead
of red or green or blue), that edge (or edges) is your problem child. Fix it
and switch back to All Same when you’re done.
My Faces Are Two Different Colors
In SketchUp, faces have two sides: a front and a back. By default, these two
sides are different colors. When you do certain things like use Push/Pull or
Follow Me on a face, sometimes the faces on the resulting geometry are
“inside out.” If it bothers you to have a two-tone model (I know it bothers
me), just right-click the faces you want to flip over and choose Reverse Faces
from the context menu. If you have lots of them, you can select them all and
then choose Reverse Faces to do them all at once.
Edges on a Face Won’t Sink In
This tends to happen when you’re trying to draw a rectangle (or another 
geometric figure) on a face with one of SketchUp’s shape-drawing tools.
Ordinarily, the Rectangle tool creates a new face on top of any face you use 
it on; after that, you can use Push/Pull to create a hole, if you want. If your
shape’s edges look thick instead of thin, they’re not cutting through the face
they’re drawn on. When that happens, try these approaches:
 Retrace one of the edges. Sometimes that works — you’d be surprised
how often.
382
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Select Hidden Geometry on the View menu. You’re checking to make
sure that the face you just drew isn’t crossing any hidden or smoothed
edges; if it is, the face you thought was flat might not be.
 Make sure that the face you drew on isn’t part of a group or compo-
nent. If it is, undo a few steps and then redraw your shape while you’re
editing the group or component.
SketchUp Crashed, and I Lost My Model
Unfortunately, SketchUp crashes happen sometimes. The good news is that
SketchUp automatically saves a copy of your file every five minutes. The file
that SketchUp autosaves is actually a separate file, which it calls AutoSave_
your filename.skp. So if your file ever gets corrupted in a crash, there’s
an intact one, ready for you to find and continue working on. The problem is
that most people don’t even know it’s there. Where?
 If you’ve ever saved your file, it’s in the same folder as the original.
 If you’ve never saved your file, it’s in your My Documents folder —
unless you’re on a Mac, in which case it’s here:
User folder/Library/Application Support/
Google SketchUp 6/SketchUp/Autosave
Keep in mind that normally, SketchUp cleans up after itself by deleting the
autosaved file when you close your model, and nothing untoward happens.
To minimize the amount of work you lose when software (or hardware) goes
south, you should always do two things: save often (compulsively, even), and
save numbered copies as you’re working — I use Save As to create a new
copy of my work every half-hour or so. When I’m building a big model, it’s 
not uncommon for me to have 40 or 50 saved versions of it on my computer,
dating back to when I first started working on it.
SketchUp Is Sooooo Slooooooooow
The bigger your model gets, the worse your performance gets, too. What makes
a model big? In a nutshell, faces. You should do everything in your power to
keep your model as small as you can. Here are some tips for doing that:
 Reduce the number of sides on your extruded circles and arcs. See the
sidebar in Chapter 6 for instructions on how to do this.
 Use 2D people and trees instead of 3D ones. 3D plants and people have
hundreds of faces each. Consider using 2D ones instead, especially if
your model won’t be seen much from overhead.
383
Chapter 16: Ten SketchUp Traps and Their Work-arounds

Some models are just big, and you can’t do much about it. Here are some
tricks for working with very large SketchUp models:
 Make liberal use of the Outliner and layers. Explained in detail in
Chapter 5, these SketchUp features were specifically designed to let 
you organize your model into manageable chunks. Hide everything
you’re not working on at the moment — doing so gives your computer 
a fighting chance.
 Use substitution for large numbers of complex components. For 
example, insert sticks as placeholders for big sets of 3D trees, cars, 
and other big components. See the tips for replacing components in
Chapter 5 for details.
 Turn off shadows and switch to a simple style. It takes a lot of com-
puter horsepower to display shadows, edge effects, and textures in real
time on your monitor. When you’re working, turn off all that stuff.
 Use scenes to navigate between views. Scenes aren’t just for presenting
your model — they’re also great for working with it. Creating scenes for
the different views you commonly use, and with different combinations 
of hidden geometry, means that you don’t have to orbit, pan, and zoom
around your gigantic model. Better yet, deselect Enable Scene Transitions
(in the Animation panel of the Model Info dialog box) to speed things up
even more.
I Can’t Get a Good View of 
the Inside of My Model
It’s not always easy to work on the inside of something in SketchUp. You can
do these things to make it easier, though:
 Cut into it with sections: SketchUp’s Sections feature lets you cut away
parts of your model — temporarily, of course — so that you can get a
better view of what’s inside. Take a look at Chapter 10 for the whole
story on sections.
 Widen your field of view: Field of view is basically the amount 
of your model you can see on the screen at one time. A wider FOV 
is like having better peripheral vision. You can read all about it in 
Chapter 10.
384
Part V: The Part of Tens 

A Face Flashes When I Orbit
If you have two faces in the same spot — maybe one is in a separate group 
or component — you see an effect called Z-fighting. What you’re witnessing is
SketchUp trying to decide which face to display by switching back and forth
between them. It’s not a good solution, but certainly a logical one, at least for
a piece of software. The only way to get rid of Z-fighting is to delete or hide
one of the faces.
I Can’t Move My Component 
the Way I Want
Some components are set up to automatically glue to faces when you insert
them into your model. A glued component instance isn’t actually glued in one
place. Instead, it’s glued to the plane of the face you originally placed (or cre-
ated) it on. For example, if you place a sofa component on the floor of your
living room, you can only move it around on that plane — not up and down.
This behavior comes in handy when you’re dealing with things like furniture.
It allows you to use the Move tool to rearrange things without having to
worry about accidentally picking them up.
If you can’t move your component the way you want to, right-click it and
check to see whether Unglue is an option — if it is, choose it. Now you can
move your component around however you want.
Every Time I Use the Eraser, 
Bad Stuff Happens
It’s pretty easy to delete stuff accidentally with the Eraser tool. Basically, just
because you can’t see an edge (like because it’s behind something else) doesn’t
mean that you can’t erase it. Worse yet, you usually don’t notice what’s missing
until it’s too late. Here are some tips for erasing more accurately:
 Orbit around. Try to make sure that nothing is behind whatever it is
you’re erasing; use SketchUp’s navigation tools to get a view of your
model that puts you out of danger.
385
Chapter 16: Ten SketchUp Traps and Their Work-arounds

 Switch to Wireframe mode. Choose View➪Face Style➪Wireframe when
you’re going to be using the Eraser heavily. That way, you won’t have
any faces to obstruct your view, and you’ll be less likely to erase the
wrong edges.
 Double-check. I’ve gotten into the habit of giving my model a quick
once-over with the Orbit tool after I do a lot of erasing, just to make 
sure that I didn’t get rid of anything important. Put a sticky note on 
your computer monitor that says something like CHECK AFTER ERASE!
just to remind yourself.
All My Edges and Faces 
Are on Different Layers
I’ll be blunt — using Layers in SketchUp is a dangerous business. Chapter 5
has tips you should follow when using layers, so I won’t repeat them here, but
here’s the short version: You should always build everything on Layer0, and
only put whole groups or components on other layers if you really need to.
If you used layers, and now things are messed up, here’s what you can do 
to recover:
1. Make sure that everything is visible.
Select Hidden Geometry on the View menu to make all your layers 
visible. Just make sure that you can see everything in your model.
2. Choose Edit➪Select All to select everything.
3. In the Entity Info dialog box, move everything to Layer0.
4. In the Layers dialog box, delete your other layers, telling SketchUp 
to move anything remaining on them to Layer0.
5. Create new layers, and follow the rules in Chapter 5.

Ten Plugins, Extensions, and
Resources Worth Getting
In This Chapter
 Places to find more components
 Scripts that make your life easier
 Software for making your SketchUp views look like photographs
 Fun hardware add-ons
T
he really great thing about SketchUp’s price is how much room it frees up
in your budget for nifty add-ons. This chapter is a list of ten such nifty
add-ons, along with a little bit of information about them, and where you can
go to find them. I’ve split them up into four categories, just to make things
clearer: components, Ruby scripts, renderers, and hardware.
Components
Hooked on components? If you do any amount of modeling with SketchUp,
you’ll quickly realize how much time you can save by having the right compo-
nents to “populate” your work with people, cars, trees, furniture, and other
stuff like that. Why make your own sofa when you can grab one from some-
where else? If the components that you can download from SketchUp’s Web
site aren’t enough for you (see Chapter 5 for more information about this),
the following sections provide some additional Web sites where you can buy
what you need.

Form Fonts
www.formfonts.com
Form Fonts is a Web site that sells components “all you can eat, buffet style.”
You pay a (surprisingly low) monthly fee, and you have access to thousands
of high-quality models of just about anything you can think of. Form Fonts’
international team of modelers even takes requests — if you need something
that they don’t have, they can probably make it if you ask nicely. In addition
to components, Form Fonts also has tons of extra materials you can apply to
your work, as well as a growing library of styles. Even if you’re not interested
in signing up, it’s worth checking out the Web site just to see the beautiful
models Form Fonts makes.
Sketchupmodels.com
www.sketchupmodels.com
Along the same lines as Form Fonts, Sketchupmodels.com is an online spot
where you can buy SketchUp components. This place isn’t a buffet, though;
you only buy what you need, à la carte. Some of its models might seem a little
expensive, but when you consider how much time it would take you to make
them yourself, it might be worth it to buy them — especially if you use
SketchUp for work.
Ruby Scripts
What’s a Ruby script, you ask? Basically, Google provides a way for people to
make their own plugins for SketchUp. These plugins are just mini-programs
(scripts) written in a computer programming language called Ruby. The best
thing about Ruby scripts (Rubies, for short) is that you don’t have to know
anything about Ruby, or programming in general, to use ones that other
people have created.
To install Rubies, you just drop them into a special folder on your computer:
 Windows: C:/Program Files/Google/Google SketchUp 6/
Plugins
 Mac: Hard Drive/Library/Application Support/Google
SketchUp 6/SketchUp/Plugins
388
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The next time you launch SketchUp, Rubies you put in the preceding location
become available for you to use. How you use them depends on what they
do. They might show up on one of the toolbar menus or on your right-click
context menu. The more complex ones even come with their own little tool-
bars. Helpfully, most Rubies also come with a set of instructions that tells you
how to use them.
Luckily for those of us who aren’t programmers, plenty of smart folks out there
develop and (in some cases) sell Rubies that anyone can use. Smustard.com
(www.smustard.com) is a Web site run by a few of these smart folks. You can
choose from dozens of helpful Rubies that add functionality to SketchUp, and
best of all, they’re very inexpensive. Here are some of my favorites:
 Weld: This Ruby takes edges you’ve selected and “welds” them together
to make a single edge that you can select with a single click. This is
super-handy when you’re using Follow Me.
 PresentationBundle: This is a package of five Rubies that help you use
scenes to create better presentations. You can customize the transition
time between individual scenes, for instance, and even create really
elaborate fly-by animations.
 CAD cleanup scripts: If you routinely import 2D CAD drawings to use as
a starting point for SketchUp models, you need these scripts. Cleaning
up imported CAD drawings is a real drag, but the following Rubies make
the whole process immeasurably easier:
• StrayLines: Run this script to figure out how much work you’ll
have to do to a CAD file after you’ve imported it — it goes through
and labels stuff you’ll probable have to fix.
• CloseOpens: Imported CAD drawings almost always have one glar-
ing problem: Their edges don’t meet precisely, which means that
you can’t create faces. You end up hunting around with the Zoom
tool, looking for all the tiny gaps and filling them in. Yuck. This
script does it for you, which makes it worth a lot more than
Smustard charges for it.
• MakeFaces: When you import a 2D CAD drawing, you get edges but
not faces. Trouble is, you need faces for working in SketchUp, so
you end up retracing a bazillion little lines to make faces appear.
Run this Ruby, and you don’t have to.
• IntersectOverlaps: You know how edges that cross don’t automati-
cally cut each other? If you use this script they will. Be careful to
read the instructions (on the Web site); this Ruby can cause some
unexpected results.
389
Chapter 17: Ten Plugins, Extensions, and Resources Worth Getting

• Flatten: Sometimes (who knows why), imported CAD lines don’t all
come in lying on the ground. You probably want them to be (so
that they’re all coplanar), and this Ruby makes sure that they are.
• DeleteShortLines: When people make CAD drawings, they often
accidentally overshoot their targets, creating hundreds of tiny,
annoying edge segments that you need to get rid of in SketchUp.
Renderers
One thing SketchUp does not do is create photorealistic renderings. Its styles
are great for making your models look hand-drawn, but none of them can
make your work look like a photograph. Most SketchUp users are okay with
that, but for those who aren’t, you can find some nice solutions out there.
Of course, SketchUp Pro’s 3D export formats make it possible to render SKP
files with just about any of the dozens of über-powerful renderers on the
market, but the ones that I describe in the following list have three important
things in common: They work with the free version of SketchUp, they were
developed with SketchUp in mind, and you don’t have to work for George
Lucas to figure them out. Here’s the list:
 SU Podium (www.suplugins.com): If you’re using a Windows com-
puter, you should probably check out Podium first. It’s a plugin that lets
you create photorealistic views right inside SketchUp. It’s really too bad
that Podium isn’t available for the Mac, but it might be sometime in the
future. Regardless of which platform you’re on, it’s definitely worth
checking out.
 TurboSketch (www.turbosketch.net): The good news about
TurboSketch is that it’s available for both Windows and the Mac, and
that it (like Podium) also runs as a plugin inside SketchUp. The bad
thing is that a lot of folks I know think Podium’s a bit better. You should
try both (if you can) and make up your own mind.
 Artlantis R (www.artlantis.com): If you’re really serious about
making images that look like photographs, take a good look at Artlantis
R. Instead of running as a plugin inside SketchUp, it’s a fully functional,
separate piece of software that works with lots of other 3D modeling
programs. The results it produces are out of this world.
Like I mentioned earlier, lots of rendering applications are out there, and
depending on what you want to do, different ones might work better than
others. If photo rendering is your thing, try plugging these names into your
favorite search engine: Kirkithea, Maxwell, Cheetah3D, and Vue. They’re hard-
core, but they all work great.
390
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Hardware
All you really need to use SketchUp is a computer with a decent video card, a
keyboard, and a mouse. On the other hand, having specialized hardware can
come in handy — especially if you find yourself using SketchUp all the time:
 A second monitor: Having a dual-monitor setup makes using SketchUp a
lot easier. All of a sudden, you have space for all your dialog boxes and
toolbars on one side of your setup, and you still have a whole screen
just for your SketchUp modeling window.
 SpaceNavigator from 3Dconnexion: Using a scroll-wheel mouse to fly
around in three-dimensional space works great for most people, but lots
of SketchUp power users swear by dedicated 3D navigation tools like 
the SpaceNavigator. It looks a little like an enormous button that sits 
on your desk, connected to your computer via a USB cable. You use it
with whichever hand you aren’t using for your mouse; it’s an add-on
(and not a replacement) for any of the other peripherals in your system.
Basically, the SpaceNavigator lets you orbit, pan, and zoom with subtle
movements of your hand — it really is a much more natural way to inter-
act with a 3D model. You’ll find a bit of a learning curve, but that’s noth-
ing for serious SketchUp users. Anything that makes software easier and
more fun to use is worth the time it takes to master it.

Ten Ways to Discover Even More
In This Chapter
 Checking out some great, free ways to find out more about SketchUp
 Discovering other helpful resources
D
on’t get me wrong — it’s not that I think this book is woefully incom-
plete. It’s just that I don’t think it’s possible to get too many different
forms of information, especially about something as dynamic as SketchUp.
You can find some great help resources out there, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t
point you to some of them.
The first half of this chapter is devoted to the free stuff; it’s all online and it’s
all available to anyone who wants it. In the second half of the chapter, I list
some of the best nonfree SketchUp resources I know of. If you’re willing to
shell out a few bucks, you won’t be sorry — nothing beats seeing the same
information presented in different ways.
Put Away Your Wallet
I have a confession to make: At fancy receptions, I’m the one stuffing my suit
pockets with hors d’oeuvres wrapped in napkins. I love free stuff that much.
So without further ado, what follows are six complementary sources of
SketchUp help.
Everything in this section requires that you have an Internet connection, so
make sure that your computer’s online before you try any of these.
If you take a peek at SketchUp’s Help menu, you’ll see a bunch of different
options (see Figure 18-1) — these are my favorites, in order of favoriteness:
 Video Tutorials: When SketchUp was first launched in 2000, it became
known for its excellent video tutorials. I can’t recommend them highly
enough; there’s nothing like seeing SketchUp in action.

 Self-Paced Tutorials: These are SketchUp files that use scenes to teach
different aspects of the program in a “follow along with me” style. If this
is how you like to figure things out, have a look.
 Online Help Center: Google maintains big, extensive help centers (Web
sites, basically) for all its products. These include hundreds of articles in
question-and-answer format, created specifically to help new users
along. The SketchUp one is terrific.
 SketchUp Community: This consists of two online “places.” Though
they’re intended for different kinds of SketchUp users, I think you’ll find
good stuff in each of them:
• Google SketchUp User Groups: This option uses Google’s Groups
feature to let SketchUp users from all over the world get help, ask
questions, and show off their work.
• Google SketchUp Pro User Forums: Plenty of people out there use
SketchUp to make a living — and a lot of them hang out in the
SketchUp forums. These are a lot like the groups (in the previous
point), but they’re for people who use SketchUp a lot. SketchUp’s
forum users are legendary for their generosity. Post a question
(remember to be polite), and you’ll see what I mean.
Here are a couple of great online destinations for people (like yourself) who
are SketchUp beginners:
 School Podcasts (www.go-2-school.com): These guys have a terrific
Web site. Check out the Podcasts area for a list of great, free online
videos they’ve put together. They also have a great learning DVD you
can buy, and I talk about it in the next part of this chapter.
 SU Wiki (www.suwiki.org): This is a Web site built by SketchUp users,
for SketchUp users. It’s a goldmine of tutorials, tips and tricks, plugins,
and other resources that I’m sure you’ll find useful.
Figure 18-1:
The
SketchUp
Help menu
is chock-
full of
goodness.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Now Get Out Your Wallet
Really. These resources cost a bit of money, but they’re worth every penny:
 Bonnie Roskes’ books: Bonnie’s The SketchUp Book was the first one
available, and now she has two new titles. If you think you’d like to get
another, bigger book about SketchUp (written with architects and other
design pros in mind), check out Bonnie’s books at: www.f1help.biz.
(Notice the .biz suffix — .com takes you somewhere else.)
 School DVD: I mention School’s videos in the previous section, but
School’s designers have also produced the world’s first SketchUp 
educational/training DVD, which you can order from its Web site
(www.go-2-school.com). The production quality on this thing is out-
standing, and Mike and Alex (the School guys) do an amazing job of
teaching SketchUp for both Windows and the Mac.
 Dennis Fukai’s books: One word: jaw-dropping detail (okay — three
words). Dennis’s books are hard to describe. He has written three of
them, each is fully illustrated in SketchUp and each teaches a different
subject. If you want to discover more about using SketchUp in building
construction or more about construction itself, or you just want to be
completely inspired by what you can do with SketchUp, have a look at
these books. Search for his name on Amazon (www.amazon.com) or go
to his company’s Web site, www.insitebuilders.com.
 SketchUp Pro training: If you think you might benefit from being able 
to spend a few hours with a real-live trainer and a handful of other
SketchUp students, Google’s SketchUp training might be for you. Its
trainers travel around to different cities, giving training seminars that
you can sign up to attend. Check out its Web site for more information:
www.sketchup.com/training.
