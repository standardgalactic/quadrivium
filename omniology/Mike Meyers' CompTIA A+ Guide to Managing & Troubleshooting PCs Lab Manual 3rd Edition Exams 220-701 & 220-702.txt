Well, now you’ve really done it. The fact that you hold this lab manual 
in your hands says one thing loud and clear—you’re deadly serious about 
getting that CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation! Good. Even though the CompTIA A+ 
certiﬁcation exams are considered entry-level, you still need to take them 
seriously if you want to pass.
Because you’re serious, I’m going to let you in on a secret: The key to 
passing these exams is preparation. When I say “preparation,” I’m not 
talking about studying—although of course studying is important! I’m 
talking about preparing to study. You need to know exactly how to study for 
these exams, and you need to have the right tools to get that studying 
done. Sure, you have a textbook and a lab manual, but you’re not yet 
ready to hit the books.
In this chapter, you’ll go through the steps you need to take to start 
studying for the CompTIA A+ exams. First, you’ll organize what you 
need to study. Second, you’ll learn how the CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation 
helps move you toward more advanced certiﬁcations. Finally, you’ll get 
some ideas on how to gather equipment so that you can reinforce what 
you read with real hardware and software. So stay serious, roll up your 
sleeves, and start preparing to study for the CompTIA A+ exams!

called The A-Team starring George Peppard and Mr. T. Okay, so maybe it wasn’t the greatest TV show, but 
I always remember one line from this show: “I love it when a plan comes together!” That’s how you 
should feel as you get ready to become CompTIA A+ certiﬁed. In fact, just for fun, let’s call ourselves the 
“A+ Team” as we put a plan together to knock that test right into next week’s episode!

Getting Down to Business
Total Seminars has been teaching CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation for years, and we’ve developed a handy template 
to help you determine what you need to study and how much time you need to devote to preparing for 
the CompTIA A+ exams. This is the same table shown in the Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and

Lab Exercise 1.01: Preparing to Study

A total neophyte usually needs around 200 hours of study time. An experienced technician 
shouldn’t need more than 40 hours.
The total number of hours for you to study is _____________.
Step 2  Go to the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) Web site and download a 
copy of the exam objectives for both the CompTIA A+ Essentials (exam code 220-701) and the CompTIA 
A+ Practical Application (exam code 220-702) exams. As of this writing, you can ﬁnd them here:
www.comptia.org/certiﬁcations/testprep/examobjectives.aspx
You have to fill out a short form (requiring your name, e-mail address, country of residence, 
and how soon you’ll be testing) before you can view the objectives. Bear in mind, however, that 
CompTIA changes its Web site more often than TV networks invent new reality shows, so be 
prepared to poke around if necessary! Compare the circled areas on the preceding form to the 
CompTIA A+ exam objectives. Note that any single topic on the form covers more than one objective 
on the CompTIA A+ exams. Circle the objectives that you think parallel the weak areas you circled 
on the form, and don’t be afraid to add or remove circles after you’ve seen the CompTIA A+ exam 
objectives in detail.
Step 3  Now that you know what topics are most important to you and how much time you need to 
devote to studying them, you need to develop your study plan. Take the amount of time you’ve set aside 
and determine how many days you have to prepare. Consider work, holidays, weekends, and anything 
else that will affect your study time. If you’re in an instructor-led course, then this part is easy—just 
use the end of the course! Then break down your textbook into manageable chunks. Again, if you’re in 
a course, then your instructor will already have done this for you. You now have your deadline—the 
day you’ll say, “I’m ready to take the exams!”
Step 4  Go online and schedule your exams with either Prometric (www.prometric.com) or Pearson 
VUE (www.vue.com). You’ll almost certainly need to make a phone call to do this. Make sure you 
have both a method of payment (credit cards are preferred) and some form of identiﬁcation when 
you call. In the United States you need your Social Security number to schedule CompTIA exams. It’s 
very important that you schedule your exams now—setting a test date early in the process will help 
motivate you to study, and keep you from procrastinating!

Lab Exercise 1.02: Considering Other Certiﬁcations
CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation may be your ﬁrst certiﬁcation, but it certainly should not be your last! 
The information technology (IT) industry considers obtaining certiﬁcations an ongoing process, one 
that continues as long as you’re working in the IT ﬁeld. You need to appreciate how the CompTIA A+ 
certiﬁcation leads into other certiﬁcations.
Learning Objectives
This lab helps you learn about the various IT certiﬁcations that are available, and how they ﬁt with 
both your skills and aptitude.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Understand some of the more common certiﬁcations that follow the CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation
• 
Plan in what order you might attain those certiﬁcations
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC with Internet access
Getting Down to Business
It’s time to jump onto the Internet and do a little research! You’ll tour some of the more popular IT 
certiﬁcations and see how CompTIA A+ helps you gain these more advanced certiﬁcations.
✔ Cross-Reference
To review the exam objectives of each CompTIA A+ exam, refer to “The Basic Exam Structure” in 
Chapter 1 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Step 1  Fire up a Web browser and go to the CompTIA Web site (www.comptia.org). CompTIA offers 
many other certiﬁcations related to the IT ﬁeld, so take some time to research their certiﬁcation 
offerings, such as:
• 
CompTIA Network+ (www.comptia.org/certiﬁcations/listed/network.aspx)
• 
CompTIA Server+ (www.comptia.org/certiﬁcations/listed/server.aspx)
• 
CompTIA Security+ (www.comptia.org/certiﬁcations/listed/security.aspx)

Lab Exercise 1.03: Gathering Equipment
7
CompTIA strongly recommend CompTIA A+ and then CompTIA Network+ as a clear pathway to 
certiﬁcation. Why do you think they do that? Would you take CompTIA Security+ before or after 
CompTIA Network+?
Step 2  Head over to the Microsoft Certiﬁcations site and explore the FAQs section:
www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certiﬁcation/cert-get-started.aspx
Then go here:
www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certiﬁcation/cert-overview.aspx 
Hover your mouse pointer over the various tabs available, such as By Product/Technology or By 
Name, and examine the many Microsoft tracks available. In your opinion, would it make sense to take 
these certiﬁcations before getting your CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation? 
Step 3  Go to the Cisco Web site (www.cisco.com); click on the Career Certiﬁcations and Paths button 
under the Training & Events dropdown menu; and research the Cisco Certiﬁed Network Associate 
(CCNA), Cisco Certiﬁed Network Professional (CCNP), and Cisco Certiﬁed Internetwork Expert (CCIE) 
certiﬁcations. Compare the CCNA to the CompTIA Network+. How are they different?
Step 4  Now that you’ve seen the more common certiﬁcations that follow the CompTIA A+, chart out 
your next three certiﬁcations and explain why you chose them.
S times will vary
Lab Exercise 1.03: Gathering Equipment
Although it’s theoretically possible to obtain your CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation by doing nothing but reading 
books, you’ll be far better prepared for the real world if you get your hands on some real equipment 
so that you can practice. You also need some tools so you can take things apart—and put them back 
together. Finally, you need some operating system software, in particular Windows 2000, Windows XP, 
and Windows Vista. If you’re taking a course, all of this equipment should be provided to you. If not, 
you could ﬁnd yourself facing some fairly serious cash outlay trying to buy everything you need!
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll discover some rather interesting ways to get inexpensive or free hardware and 
software. None of these ideas will work every time, but with a little patience you’ll be amazed how 
much you can get for very little!

Most of the objectives on the CompTIA A+ exams don’t require state-of-the-art hardware. If you’re 
willing to use systems that are a few years old, you can get plenty of good hands-on practice with the 
techniques you need to know to pass the CompTIA A+.
Step 1  Go on a scavenger hunt. Get a list of the smaller “mom and pop” PC repair companies and 
small PC parts suppliers in your town. Drive to these companies (don’t call them) and ask them, “What 
do you guys do with your broken or obsolete parts?” The vast majority of these stores simply throw 
the parts away! Ask when they toss stuff and if you can have what they throw away. Most of these 
companies pay to get rid of equipment and will be glad to give it to you. Oh, and you can forget the big 
chain stores—they almost never let folks have equipment.
Step 2  Shop the sale bins at the local computer parts stores. You’ll always ﬁnd one or two pieces of 
equipment at outrageously low prices. Granted, you may end up using a bright pink Barbie keyboard, 
but if it only costs $3, who cares? Don’t forget about rebates—you can often get parts for free after 
rebate! Really!
Step 3  Tell everyone you know that you’re looking for PC hardware. Almost every organization 
will have occasional in-house sales where they sell older (but still good) PCs, printers, and so on to 
employees. If you can get in on some of these, you’ll have some amazing deals come your way!
✔ Hint
You’ll often ﬁnd that older machines still have the Windows 98 or Windows Me operating 
system software installed. If you come across one of these systems, see if you can work with 
the seller or donor to get the licensed disc. Working with an older operating system (even DOS) 
will introduce you to the installation and conﬁguration process. Having an operating system 
installed will also enable you to verify that the hardware is working.

Lab Exercise 1.03: Gathering Equipment
9
Step 4  Take one weekend to check out local garage sales. People often sell older PCs at a tiny fraction 
of their original cost. If you’re not afraid to barter a bit, you’ll get incredible deals—just watch out for 
equipment that’s simply too old to be worthwhile.
✔ Hint
I avoid PC ﬂea markets. The problem is that these folks know the value of their computer 
equipment, so it’s often hard to ﬁnd excellent deals.
Step 5  Locate the local PC user groups in your town—almost every town has at least one. Explain 
your situation to them; you’ll usually ﬁnd someone who’s willing to give you a part or two, and you 
may also ﬁnd others who are studying for the CompTIA A+ exams. You may even be able to start or join 
a study group!
Step 6  Check out the Craigslist page for your area (www.craigslist.com) and look in the For Sale/
Computer category. Craigslist is like a big online garage sale, and you can almost always ﬁnd someone 
trying to get rid of old PC equipment for next to nothing. Failing that, you can check out their forums, 
or even place an ad yourself saying that you’re looking for old PC parts.
Step 7  Speaking of study groups, try teaming up with as many fellow students as you can to pool 
cash for parts and to work as a study group. If you’re in a course, this is easy—your fellow students are 
your study group! Have everyone go equipment hunting, using the different methods described to get 
equipment, and pool the items you ﬁnd for everyone to use. You might even hold a drawing after you 
all get certiﬁed, to choose who gets to keep the equipment.

Achieving CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation is a great way to demonstrate 
to prospective employers that you have the appropriate technical skills 
to make you a worthy candidate for their workplace. But you have to 
demonstrate more than just technical skills to get hired by and succeed 
in an organization. You also need to demonstrate that you have the 
appropriate interpersonal skills to interact effectively with fellow 
employees and with clients. CompTIA recognizes the importance of 
interpersonal skills in the workplace and thus includes related questions 
on its A+ certiﬁcation exams to make sure you are prepared to show that 
you have the people skills to work well with others. Face it, you’re great 
at ﬁxing computers and extremely interested in the latest gadgets, but do 
you have the people skills to land a job, keep a job, and climb the ladder of 
success? I’ve seen many talented young individuals who can ﬁx just about 
anything struggle in the area of how to communicate professionally with 
others; their impressive résumé allows them to walk in the front door to a 
promising future…only to slink out the back door in disappointment after 
failing due to lack of people skills.
Whether you like it or not, people evaluate you based on how they 
perceive you. Developing and maintaining personal and professional 
workplace habits ensures that people perceive you as the IT professional that 
you are. This set of labs applies the information you learned in Chapter 2 of 
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs, with a focus 
on communicating properly, presenting yourself professionally at all times, 
and demonstrating your technical knowledge regarding safety. These labs will 
help you not only to pass the CompTIA A+ exam, but also to develop skills that 
will serve you well throughout your career, whether in IT or another ﬁeld.
The CompTIA objectives challenge you to conduct yourself in a 
professional manner while on the job. Objective 6.2 (exam 220-701) goes

into detail to clarify how you should act on the job. Let’s review some of 
the major points:
6.2 GIVEN A SCENARIO, DEMONSTRATE THE APPROPRIATE USE OF COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND 
PROFESSIONALISM IN THE WORKPLACE
• 
Use proper language—avoid jargon, acronyms, slang.
• 
Maintain a positive attitude.
• 
Listen and do not interrupt a customer.
• 
Be culturally sensitive.
• 
Be on time.
• 
If late, contact the customer.
• 
Avoid distractions:
• 
Personal calls
• 
Talking to co-workers while interacting with customers
• 
Personal interruptions
Many of the following labs will require you to have a partner, and your instructor will actually lead 
the classroom through a few of them, so buddy up. 
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 2.01: The Rude Computer Technician
Everyone is familiar with the stereotype of the rude technician so wrapped up in technology that he 
is unable to relate to the people around him. Sneering technobabble, a condescending attitude, and 
rude remarks have become traits that people expect to ﬁnd in techs, and, all too often, the techs don’t 
disappoint. In this exercise, you’ll work with a partner ﬁrst to roleplay the part of the stereotypical 
rude tech and then to roleplay a professional, well-behaved tech. In this way, you’ll learn how you 
should and should not behave as a technician.
Learning Objectives
The plan is to have a classmate play the role of the client, and you play the role of the PC tech. Work 
through the scenario in a live person-to-person role playing of the situation, just as if it were real.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Demonstrate proper communication skills
• 
Avoid distractions in the workplace

Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Blank drawing paper and pencil
•

• 
A space to place chairs so that you can face your partner
•

Getting Down to Business
In this exercise, one person will act as the PC technician while the other acts as a customer sitting 
in a cubicle. As the PC technician, you will ﬁrst try to emulate as many bad communication habits as 
possible while your partner, the customer, identiﬁes and writes down those bad habits. Then, repeat the 
process, this time using proper communication skills. You will then trade roles and repeat the scenario.
Step 1  Create a scenario in which a customer would ask for technical support. For example, try “My 
computer is running slowly and all these Web pages keep popping up!”—a classic case of malware 
infection. The person playing the customer should act as if he or she is not technically savvy and is 
unable to answer any technical questions or understand any terms outside of what might be considered 
“common.” What is considered “common” is up to the person playing the customer, so have fun!
Step 2  Between 1999 and 2001, the popular television show Saturday Night Live put on a series of 
comedy sketches called “Nick Burns, Your Company’s Computer Guy.” Many of these sketches are 
available online. Do a search for and watch a few of these humorous sketches to see actor Jimmy Fallon 
portray how insensitive a technician can be in his personal communications. Why are these sketches 
so funny? What does their popularity tell you about how techs are perceived by our society? Use these 
videos to get an idea of how to behave during the next step, and how never, ever to behave in real life.
Step 3  It’s now time for the technician to do his thing in a timed scenario. Pretend the customer is 
sitting in a cubicle. Every computer has an “asset tag number,” and the tech must conﬁrm that number 
to make sure he is working on the right computer. After that, it’s up to the tech! Be as rude as possible 
(but not so rude that a person normally would get ﬁred), concentrating on the issues listed in step 1 
of this lab. Your goal is to try to get started working on the PC within three minutes.
As the customer, your job is to describe the problem and answer the tech’s questions to the best of 
your ability. You want your computer ﬁxed, but you won’t get up until you have conﬁdence in the tech. 
As the tech talks, jot down how he is rude or inconsiderate to you.
The scenario ends when either the tech is sitting at the customer’s computer or three minutes have 
elapsed, whichever happens ﬁrst.

Lab Exercise 2.02: Communicating Effectively
15
Step 4  Discuss the issues that the customer wrote down. After a quick discussion, repeat the process, 
this time using good communication techniques. In most cases, the customer will quickly relinquish 
her seat and let you get to work.
The scenario ends when the tech is sitting at the customer’s computer or three minutes have elapsed, 
whichever happens ﬁrst.
Step 5  Repeat the entire process, this time trading roles. The person now playing the tech should 
attempt to come up with different ways to be inappropriate, within reason.

Lab Exercise 2.02: Communicating Effectively
So, you want to be a successful IT technician but you have trouble communicating? One of the keys to 
professional communication is being able to listen well as duties are being assigned to you, so that you 
can produce the results expected.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Communicate more effectively
• 
Help discern when it’s best to talk and when it’s best to listen

between each set of chairs.
Getting Down to Business
In this exercise, you’ll listen as your partner speaks to you and you’ll write down whatever he or 
she tells you under a tight timeline. The goal is to help you work under pressure while remaining 
professional at all times.

Step 1  Students should pair up. Each pair of students should designate one person to be the PC tech 
and the other to be the customer and then write their respective titles on the top of their papers.
Step 2  The instructor should start the timer and ask the designated customers to say the ﬁrst ﬁve 
technology-related problems that come to mind; they have 20 seconds to do this. As the customers 
speak, their respective partner techs should write down what they say, in the order stated. An example 
might be system fails to boot, no wireless connection, printer not printing properly, no picture on the monitor, etc.
Stop the timer at 20 seconds.
Step 3  The PC techs write a brief solution to the ﬁve words or phrases just spoken by the customers. 
They have three minutes to complete this and must address them in the order received.
Stop the timer at three minutes.
Step 4  The PC tech and customer groups face each other for one minute and share their information. 
Then, each pair presents their problems and solutions to the class, in turn. They have two minutes 
to present their solutions. The other groups should sit quietly and listen. After all groups ﬁnish, the 
instructor will give feedback to each group as to how they could communicate better. Students should 
be allowed to participate in the feedback as well.

Lab Exercise 2.03: Preparing for  
the Technical Interview
Sitting for an interview and selling yourself to complete strangers is the stuff of many a PC tech’s 
nightmares. Trust me! You might think it sounds easy, but once you’re in the hot seat and actually doing 
it, everything changes. So buckle down and pay attention during this lab because it could make or break 
your chance of landing that $30,000–$40,000+ job!
Before we get started in earnest, here are some tips to keep in mind when interviewing for a job.
• 
No chewing gum.
• 
Turn your cell phone off and keep it out of sight. No texting!
• 
Comb your hair and keep it out of your eyes (if you have to swing your hair to the side every 
minute, get a haircut). Messy hair looks very unprofessional and reﬂects poor self-image.
• 
Brush your teeth.
• 
Males—Tuck in your shirt, pull up your pants, and wear a belt.

Lab Exercise 2.03: Preparing for the Technical Interview

• 
Females—No miniskirts or low tops, and keep your stomach covered. 
• 
Shake hands ﬁrmly.
• 
Maintain good eye contact at all times.
• 
No sneakers allowed!
• 
Do not offer information that is not pertinent to the interview. Think before speaking and 
always tell the truth.
For more tips on job interviewing, see “10 Killer Job Interview Questions and Answers,” by Carole 
Martin, available at www.bspcn.com/2007/08/24/10-killer-job-interview-questions-and-answers/.
Learning Objectives
In this lab exercise, you will practice role modeling as an interviewee (if no interviewers are present, 
you may also have to roleplay as an interviewer). You will be critiqued as you are probed to say and do 
the right thing at all times. So get ready for some fun in preparing for the interview process.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Speak clearly, professionally, and technically
• 
Describe how IT affects the workplace
• 
Effectively communicate what you know 
• 
Know what to bring and wear to the interview
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
An updated résumé that lists all your skills; technology courses that you’re currently taking or have 
completed; and reliable references, other than family—preferably customers or people that know 
your skill level and character, and have worked with you for a period of a minimum of six months.
• 
A digital portfolio (a CD) that includes an updated copy of your résumé; pictures or short 
video clips of you working on computers, possibly building a computer; any presentations or 
technology-related projects you’ve been involved in implementing; a log of customers you’ve 
supported; and any Web sites you’ve created that demonstrate your skills. Not MySpace or 
Facebook! By the way, this is a CD you will leave with your interviewer, so make it good.
Instructors: For the setup, enlist or bring in at least four volunteers from the technology industry, 
such as local PC repair shop managers, Geek Squad reps, and so forth, to help you interview your students. 
Use people from the business world as much as possible, but if you’re under tight timelines, just ask 

Chapter 2: Operational Procedures
18
your school’s principal, guidance personnel, media specialists, or other teachers to assist you. They 
make great interviewers because your students most likely do not know them as well as they know you 
and thus will take this exercise more seriously.
Getting Down to Business
This is a work-in-progress lab that will be beneﬁcial to you for life. Once you’ve started the process of 
learning to present yourself effectively, you will be surprised at how many opportunities you’ll get to 
use these skills.
Step 1  Write your résumé and save it to multiple places. Have your instructor guide you as to what 
to include and what not to include. Run a spell check! Print and proof it yourself ﬁrst and then allow 
your instructor to critique it.
✔ Hint
The Web offers many places for the serious job seeker to post a completed résumé electronically, 
such as www.monster.com, but it is wise to have properly formatted paper copies as well, to turn 
in with your application.
Step 2  Type a list of personal and professional references on a separate document and contact the 
people you are listing to make them aware they may get a call about your potential interview.
Step 3  Have a room set up with at least four tables/stations, one for each volunteer interviewer, with 
at least three chairs at each station. Have students “dress for success” on the day of the interview and 
let them know that evaluation of their appearance comprises 50 percent of their grade.
Step 4  Enter the interview area quietly. Make sure to have your printed résumé, references, and 
digital portfolio ready to turn in. Interviews should last no more than ten minutes. Ideally, the 
interviewers will ask everyone the same questions, but you never know what you’ll be asked.
Step 5  Once you have been interviewed, the interviewers will compare their thoughts and choose 
two or three top students to be interviewed by the entire group of interviewers. This is called a panel 
interview and is the type of interview students will most likely encounter when being interviewed for 
various jobs.

Lab Exercise 2.04: Integrating Safety  
into the Workplace
Demonstrating safety precautions at all times is one of the most important things you can do to protect 
yourself and your customers…and impress your employer. This mostly involves using common sense, 
but you should also make sure to carefully read and put into practice the safety guidelines provided in 
Chapter 2 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Many techs go into the ﬁeld with the mindset that safety is not that important, but it can save 
your life and the lives of others. The U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration has a Web site at www.osha.gov that is loaded with information for employers and 
employees to help them understand the importance of safety. It offers guidelines for electronics and 
computers/peripherals that we’ll explore in this lab exercise.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will identify the safety hazards in the workplace and become more aware of guidelines 
that are useful in a PC environment.
At the end of this lab, you will be able to
• 
Explain ESD
• 
Explain MSDS and various hazards
• 
Explain proper equipment disposal procedures
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC with Internet access
• 
A notepad
• 
Presentation software, if possible, to present your ﬁndings 
Getting Down to Business
In Chapter 2 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs, you read that electrostatic 
discharge (ESD) can cause permanent damage to some components and erase data on some storage 
devices. If you take this to heart and practice ESD safety measures as a PC tech early on, you will gain 
respect in the workplace and demonstrate that you care about your employer’s investment.

Chapter 2: Operational Procedures

Step 1  Research ESD, material safety data sheets (MSDSs), and how to dispose of old computer 
equipment properly, while typing results. You can use the Internet, magazines, tech articles, manuals, 
and so forth, but make sure you properly document where you ﬁnd your information.
Step 2  Compile the data into a presentation type document. Include the following:
• 
Pages that describe and deﬁne ESD, MSDSs, and proper disposal
• 
Pictures of
• 
Various anti-static devices
• 
Samples of MSDSs
• 
Disposing of old, outdated computer devices
•

Getting Down to Business
Choosing the proper way to dress and present yourself is extremely important in securing and 
maintaining a good job. Did you know that within the ﬁrst 15 seconds of meeting someone, they 
form opinions of you based entirely on your appearance—your body language, your demeanor, your 
mannerisms, and how you are dressed? Once you have made that ﬁrst impression, it is virtually 
irreversible, so you must be aware at all times how you are being perceived and maintain a positive and 
clean self-image.
Step 1  Read the following descriptions and choose which person you would want to work on your 
computer. After you’ve made your decision, write a short statement supporting your decision and why.
• 
Sloppily-dressed technician
• 
Well-dressed technician
• 
Technician properly using technology (tech using a laptop, sitting straight up, not slouching)
• 
Technician misusing technology (tech talking on cell phone or texting while on the job)
• 
Technician with clean, well-kept hair
• 
Technician with not-so-nice hair
Step 2  Go to www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/FirstImpressions.htm and read the article “Making 
a Great First Impression!” Are there any points that you would add to this list? Write a short essay 
explaining why or why not.
Step 3  Read the article “Top 6 Rules for Using Cell Phones at Work,” by Dawn Rosenberg McKay, at 
http://careerplanning.about.com/od/workplacesurvival/tp/cell_phone.htm. Then, read the following 
scenarios and choose the appropriate response:
1. 
Your boss has speciﬁcally stated that you cannot use your cell phone on the job unless you are on 
break (away from your work space) or at lunch. You found out before you left for work that your 
father will be having out-patient surgery today, and you want to be informed right way about his 
status. What should you do?
A. 
Keep your phone on vibrate and out of sight, wait for a phone call, and discreetly leave the 
work area so you can take the call.
B. 
Inform your boss that you’re dealing with a family situation and may need to be excused at an 
unexpected time to ﬁnd out the status of your father’s condition.

Chapter 2: Operational Procedures

2. 
You’re on the phone with a client, attempting to walk her through various troubleshooting steps so 
that you don’t have to travel to the client’s location to ﬁx the problem. Your cell phone suddenly 
rings (because you forgot to turn it off) and you can see on the caller ID that it’s an old friend you 
have not talked to in a while. What should you do?
A. 
Quickly turn off your cell phone and put it away.
B. 
Place your client on hold and take the call.
3. 
Your boss just came in the ofﬁce from a meeting with his boss and is extremely frustrated about 
issues that do not involve you. He speaks to you rather harshly and then abruptly leaves. The 
moment he leaves, you receive a phone call from a client who demands that you return his PC to 
him today and a text message you’ve been waiting for about a part for the client’s computer that’s 
due in. What should you do?
A. 
Place the client on hold, read the text, and then give him an up-to-the-minute update.
B. 
Speak harshly back to him and  place him on hold while you regain your composure.
Lab Analysis Test
1. 
Your coworker Sara constantly takes personal calls on her cell phone even though she knows your 
employer has a rule banning personal use of the cell phone while in the workplace. Whenever she’s 
on her cell phone, she does not answer her regular work phone, thus adding more work for you and 
others. How do you think you should handle this situation?
2. 
You just got a phone call from a PC repair company that wants to interview you today. It is dress-
down day at your workplace, so you’re wearing jeans and a T-shirt. Should you accept the offer to 
interview today or decline? Explain your answer.

Every competent tech knows the PC inside and out. Nothing destroys your 
credibility in the eyes of a client as quickly as not knowing the basics, like the 
difference between a graceful shutdown and a forced power down. The word 
“Oops!” doesn’t always go over well in the real world! This set of labs applies 
the information you learned in Chapter 3 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to 
Managing and Troubleshooting PCs, so you’ll be poking and prodding a PC. You’ll 
begin by exploring the functions of a PC, and then you’ll examine the typical 
user-accessible components, as well as the external connectors found on most 
PCs. After taking a moment to protect both yourself and the PC components 
from electrical damage, you’ll open up the system unit’s case and take a tour 
inside. Finally, you’ll ﬁnish up with a complete disassembly of the system.

Lab Exercise 3.01: Exploring the  
Functions and Components of a PC
Everything a computer does falls into one of four categories: input, processing, output, and storage. You 
need a good understanding of these four processes, and the components that are involved with each one, 
to troubleshoot PC problems successfully.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Deﬁne the four functions of computer systems
• 
Detail common components involved in each of these four functions
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A notepad and pencil, to draw a four-column table
• 
Optional: Access to a working computer with a word processing or spreadsheet application 
installed, to aid in drawing the table
• 
The Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs textbook, for reference

Lab Exercise 3.01: Exploring the Functions and Components of a PC
27
✔ Hint
Get used to taking notes and drawing pictures. Even after many years of repairing computers, 
from mainframes to PCs, I still use a notepad to keep track of what I see and what I change. I 
recommend that you save your drawings and notes, as you’ll ﬁnd them useful in subsequent labs.
Getting Down to Business
In this exercise, you’ll review, list, and deﬁne the various components involved in the PC’s vital 
functions.
Step 1 Reread the “How the PC Works” section in Chapter 3 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and 
Troubleshooting PCs, paying particular attention to the sections on input, processing, output, and storage.
Step 2 For each of the following functions of a computer system, write a deﬁnition and give a brief 
example:
Input:
Processing:
Output:
Storage:

Chapter 3: The Visible PC
28
Step 3 Using the following table, list the components that operate in each of the four functional 
categories. Try to include as many components as you can; you might take a peek at some of the 
later chapters in the textbook to see if you can add any other components. Think about how each of 
the components contributes to the overall workings of the PC, and include as much detail about the 
component as possible.
Input
Processing
Output
Storage
Step 4 If you completed the table right here in the lab book, you’ll have it handy throughout the 
rest of the lessons. If you made a table in your notebook, or created an electronic version, make sure 
you can get to it easily. As you work on later chapters, you’ll want to update the table with additional 
components and further detail on the components. The information in the table (and in your head) will 
expand as you develop a better understanding of how the components relate to the PC’s “big picture.”

Lab Exercise 3.02: Examining  
User-Accessible Components
It’s been one of those days. You walked into what should have been a simple job interview, only to meet 
a very frantic IT manager who was dealing with a crisis of epic proportions. She doesn’t even bother 
to interview you—instead she shuttles you out of her ofﬁce, points down the hall, and says, “Go check 
Jane’s PC, fourth cubicle on the left. She says the PC has locked up on her, and she can’t even turn it off! 
Don’t change anything or open it up. Right now I simply need to know if it will shut down, boot properly, 
and access the drives.” Then the IT manager is off to deal with her crisis, and you’re on the spot.
This exercise looks at the many PC components that you can access without removing the case. You 
can use a quick scan to determine whether a PC is functioning properly at the most basic level. Take 
your time, and jot down notes where you feel the need. Practice each step until you’re conﬁdent you can 
do it on the job as a PC tech.

Lab Exercise 3.02: Examining User-Accessible Components
29
Learning Objectives
In this lab exercise you will locate and describe the various user controls and built-in user-accessible 
devices of a PC system. You will not be opening the system case during this lab.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Recognize and manipulate user controls
• 
Describe the use of built-in user-accessible devices
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
One fully functioning desktop computer system unit, with monitor
• 
A working optical drive (any drive that reads or records CD, DVD, or Blu-ray discs)
• 
One readable data CD with ﬁles
• 
One keyboard
• 
One mouse
• 
A notepad on which to take notes and make sketches of the computer and components
• 
Optionally, a digital camera to take photos of the computer and components (can be a standalone 
camera or part of another device, such as a mobile phone)
✔ Hint
In Lab Exercise 3.01, I recommended that you get used to taking notes and drawing pictures. Thanks 
to the wide popularity and availability of digital cameras, you have another excellent way to 
record the conﬁguration of computer systems and the steps taken during disassembly, repair, and 
assembly. A digital camera can be a handy tool for supplementing your trusty pencil and paper.
Getting Down to Business
As a technician, you need to know how everything works on a PC. The best place to begin is with the 
externally accessible devices.
Step 1 Before you can do much work with a PC, you need a functioning output device, such as a 
monitor. Check the monitor to see if it has power. The small light-emitting diode (LED) on or near the 
monitor’s power button should be lit: orange if the system is turned off or asleep, or green if the 
system is fully on. If you determine that the monitor is not plugged into a wall outlet, plug it in now.
Step 2 Look at the front of your system unit. Locate the power button. Compare your button to the 
one in Figure 3-1.

Chapter 3: The Visible PC
30
Once you have located the power button on your system, make a note of its appearance. Is it in 
plain sight, or hidden behind a door or lid? Is it round, square, or some odd shape? Pressing the power 
button to start a PC when the electricity is off is known as a cold boot or sometimes a hard boot.
Describe your power button here:
Sometimes software will lock up your system and the only way to shut the system down is to force a 
power down. This requires that you press and hold the power button for four to six seconds.
Notice the two LEDs on the front panel near the power button. One generally lights up green to 
indicate that the power is on, and the other ﬂashes when the internal hard drive is active.
✔ Hint
On older systems, the power button or switch may be located on the back of the system. Many 
newer systems have a power switch located on the back of the case that controls the ﬂow of 
electricity to the power supply, and a power button on the front that boots and shuts down the 
PC. Most systems also have a reset button, which you can use to restart the PC if it becomes 
unstable or locked up because of some software glitch.
Step 3 Locate the ﬂoppy drive. You can recognize it by the 3½-inch horizontal slot. Do you see the 
eject button below the slot on the right side of the drive? Below the slot on the left side is an LED that 
lights up when the drive is actively reading or writing information on a ﬂoppy diskette.
Figure 3-1 Recognizing the power button on the front of a PC

Lab Exercise 3.02: Examining User-Accessible Components
31
✔ Hint
Because ﬂoppy diskettes can store only a relatively tiny amount of data, ﬂoppy drives are disappearing 
from PCs. In fact, most new computer systems ship without ﬂoppy drives. If your system doesn’t have 
a ﬂoppy drive, you may want to explore an older machine to see one in action. As a computer tech, 
you will most likely still have to deal with ﬂoppy drives for at least a few more years.
On the front of your system, you should also see the external face of your system’s optical drive. 
You’ll see either the front edge of the tray that opens to accept an optical disc, or a small door that 
protects the tray when it’s retracted. Once you’ve located this drive, notice that it too has a button in 
the lower-right corner. When the system is on, you can press that button to open the tray door (if there 
is one) and slide the tray out to receive your disc (see Figure 3-2). Pressing the button while the tray is 
out retracts the tray so that the drive can read the disc.
Don’t be tempted to force the disc tray to close. Always press the button on the front of the drive 
to close the tray or to eject a disc. Forcing the tray to close can cause the gears inside to become 
misaligned, so that the tray no longer closes properly.
Figure 3-2 Can you locate the ﬂoppy drive and 
optical drive on this system unit?

Chapter 3: The Visible PC
32
✔ Hint
If you forget to remove an optical disc before turning off the system power, you can straighten 
a strong paper clip and insert one end into the tiny hole on the front of the drive. Pressing 
directly inward with the paper clip will cause the tray to open.
Your system may have other devices installed, such as a USB ﬂash drive (a solid-state device that plugs 
into a USB port but acts like a hard drive), a tape drive, a Blu-ray Disc drive, or various media card readers, 
such as those for CompactFlash or Memory Stick cards. Each of these uses removable media; take care 
when inserting or removing the media.
➜ Note
With USB ﬂash drives—or thumb drives, as they’re often called—the drive is the removable media.
Step 4 Now it’s time to prepare your system for the scenario outlined in the opening text:
a. 
Turn on your system and log on in a normal fashion so that you are viewing the operating 
system desktop.
b. 
Press the eject button on the front of the optical drive. When the tray opens, carefully insert 
a disc. Press the eject button again to close the tray. If you haven’t done this a lot, practice 
inserting and removing a disc until you feel comfortable with the process. Does the LED on the 
front of the optical drive ﬂash or stay on continuously at any point?
✖ Warning
Don’t start any applications yet! Close any open applications or open windows before performing 
Step 5. You’re going to force a “power down,” and you do not want to damage any of the software 
applications.
Step 5 Now you’re going to simulate a PC that has become nonresponsive and “locked up.” Perform a 
forced power down as follows:
a. 
Press and hold the power button.
b. 
While continuing to hold the power button in, count out loud (one–one thousand, two–one 
thousand, three–one thousand . . .) until the system powers down and the screen goes blank.

Lab Exercise 3.02: Examining User-Accessible Components
33
 
According to your count, how many seconds did it take for the screen to go blank?
Step 6 After the system has been powered down for approximately one minute, do the following:
a. 
Press the power button and allow the system to boot.
 
Did the system boot properly? ___________________________________________________
b. 
Log on in a normal fashion so that you are viewing the operating system desktop.
 
Were you able to log on as normal? _______________________________________________
c. 
Select Start | My Computer or Computer and double-click the icon that represents the optical 
drive. This should enable you to view the contents of the disc that was inserted prior to the 
forced power down.
 
List some of the contents of the disc: _____________________________________________ 
___________________________________________________________________________
d. 
Select Start | Shut Down. If you’re using Windows Vista, it goes straight to a shutdown routine. 
Windows 2000/XP opens the Shut Down Windows dialog box, in which you select Shut down 
from the drop-down list. This performs a graceful shutdown of the system.
✔ Hint
If all the actions in Step 6 were successful, the system likely is stable and you can report to the 
IT manager that Jane’s machine is back up and running. If any of the actions failed, you should 
select Start | Restart in Windows Vista or Start | Shut Down in Windows 2000/XP. In the Shut 
Down Windows dialog box, select Restart from the drop-down list. After the system reboots, you 
may complete actions b, c, and d once more. Sometimes the forced power down leaves some of 
the ﬁles in a state of ﬂux; restarting shuts the computer down “gracefully,” properly closing all 
open ﬁles before powering down. This should clear everything up and enable the computer to 
function properly.
Step 7 While the computer is turned off, pretend you lost power and must remove the disc from the 
optical drive without power. Use a paper clip to remove the disc, as noted earlier in the Lab Hint under 
Step 3.
Step 8 As a technician, you need to understand the keyboard, because it is still one of the most 
important human interfaces connected to a PC. Look at the way your keyboard is laid out: it basically 
has three main sections, with some extra keys thrown in for good measure (see Figure 3-3).

Chapter 3: The Visible PC
34
The largest area of the keyboard is the standard QWERTY (pronounced “kwerty”) letter key layout, 
which is familiar to touch typists everywhere. If you never took a typing or keyboarding class, you may 
be wondering what I mean by QWERTY; it’s simply the standard keyboard used in the U.S. and most 
English-speaking countries, so named for the ﬁrst six letters in the top row of letter keys.
To the right of the letter keys you’ll usually see a square numeric keypad similar to those found on 
old adding machines. This feature is popular with people like accountants and merchants, because it 
makes entering numbers quicker and easier.
Above the letter keys, you’ll ﬁnd a special row of keys called function keys, normally labeled F1 
through F12. What these keys do depends on the software you’re using when you press them; pressing 
the F1 key, for example, generally calls up a program’s help feature. Function keys are used for various 
tasks, including accessing basic system settings at startup. You’ll use the function keys a lot when 
troubleshooting a downed system.
➜ Note
Many modern keyboards include a switch to toggle the purpose of the function keys from 
performing the standard F1 through F12 functions to being some sort of multimedia controls, 
such as volume up or down or go to the next song. Others offer helpful functions, such as back 
and next keys for controlling a Web browser. If the function key doesn’t behave as a standard 
key, look for the function key toggle.

Lab Exercise 3.02: Examining User-Accessible Components
35
In the keyboard’s upper-left corner, next to the function keys, you’ll see the Escape key, labeled ESC. 
In many programs, particularly older ones, pressing this key backs you out of what you’re doing, 
sometimes even causing your current program to close down. In more modern software, pressing ESC is 
a way to make a program let go of some text or graphic you’ve selected, or to close the current dialog box 
without implementing any changes.
To the right of the function keys are the PRINT SCREEN, SCROLL LOCK, and PAUSE/BREAK keys; depending on your 
keyboard, any or all of these key names may be abbreviated. These specialized keys aren’t heavily used these 
days, although some programs (such as Windows Clipboard) use the PRINT SCREEN key to capture snapshots of 
the monitor display (known as a screen shot). Screen shots can come in handy when you’re troubleshooting 
program or application problems and need to show someone else what you’re seeing (see Figure 3-4).
Along the bottom row of the keyboard, on either side of the SPACEBAR, you’ll ﬁnd the special keys 
labeled CTRL (for Control) and ALT (for Alternate). On keyboards designed for use with Windows operating 
systems, you’ll also ﬁnd a key with the Windows logo (which opens the Windows Start menu), and 
possibly one with a menu symbol as well (which opens a context menu without using the mouse). For 
the most part, the CTRL and ALT keys don’t do anything by themselves, but they are incredibly useful 
when combined with other keys. In many word processing programs, for example, holding down the 
CTRL key while pressing the S key has the same effect as selecting File | Save using the mouse—only 
faster and easier. Techs use these types of key combinations a lot; in this manual you’ll see them 
represented with a hyphen between the keys, for example CTRL-S.

Lab Exercise 3.03: Recognizing External Connections
Just as you ﬁnish working with Jane’s PC, her intercom buzzes. It’s the head of IT, and she has a new 
assignment for you: The new satellite ofﬁce in Albuquerque has received a delivery of new PCs, but the 
machines are all in boxes and not one of the salespeople there knows a mouse from a monkey wrench. 
Your job is to call them up and walk them through the process of connecting a PC, describing each cable 
and connector, and explaining how they connect to the PC.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will identify, describe, and explain the function of the external connections on a 
standard PC.
At the end of this lab, you will be able to
• 
Identify the external connectors on a PC and the related cables
• 
Explain the function of each external connection
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
At least one fully functioning PC that’s less than two years old (two or more systems is ideal, 
with one older than and one newer than two years old)
• 
A notepad on which to take notes and make sketches of the computer, connections, and 
connectors
• 
Optionally, a digital camera to record the connections and connectors instead of sketching
In addition, a lab partner would be useful.
✔ Cross-Reference
Before you begin this lab, read the sections “External Connections” and “Devices and Their 
Connectors” in Chapter 3 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Getting Down to Business
Now it’s time to learn about all the external things that can be attached to a PC. This lab exercise steps 
you through identifying and understanding the function of the various connectors. If you have access to 
the same computer that you used in the previous lab, consult your drawings, notes, and any photos you 
may have taken to assist you in the completion of the exercise.

Lab Exercise 3.03: Recognizing External Connections 
37
✖ Warning
Shut off the power to your system and unplug your PC from the wall socket before you start the following 
exercise.
Step 1 Look at all those wires coming from the back of your PC! There’s a power cable, a telephone 
or network cable, probably a printer cable, a keyboard cable, a mouse cable, and maybe a few others, 
depending on your system. Looking at the back of my current system (the one I’m using to write this 
manual), I count 15 cables directly connected to it. Yowza!
The great thing about PCs is that it’s difﬁcult to connect the cables incorrectly. Each one has a 
unique connector; some are male (connectors with pins), and some are female (connectors with holes). 
Each connector has a particular shape and a speciﬁc number of pins or holes that match those of a 
speciﬁc device connected to the system unit.
Get your notepad ready to take notes and draw pictures.
✔ Hint
Cables have conductors. A conductor is a wire that can carry electrical signals. You may see a 
cable described by the number of conductors it has; for example, a telephone cable can be a two- 
or four-conductor cable. A power cable is a three-conductor cable. A network cable is an eight-
conductor cable.
Step 2 Unplug each of your PC’s cables one at a time and practice plugging it back in until you get a 
feel for how it ﬁts. You should not have to force any of the cables, though they may be ﬁrm. How is 
each cable held in place and prevented from coming loose? Is there a screw, clip, or some other fastener 
that holds the cable connector tight to the system? Is the connector keyed? What does it connect to? 
What is the shape of the connector on each end? Is it round, rectangular, D-shaped? How many pins or 
holes does it have? How many rows of pins or holes are there?
Step 3 Is it possible to plug any cable into the wrong connector? If so, which one(s)? What do you 
think would happen if you plugged something into the wrong connector?

Chapter 3: The Visible PC
38
Step 4 Remove or disconnect any of the following cables from your system and describe its connector. 
Follow this example:
• 
Data cable from the monitor to the PC
 
Type of connector: End 1 (PC)    D-sub    End 2    D-sub   
 
Male or Female: End 1 (PC)    F    End 2    M   
 
Number of pins/holes/conductors:    15   
✔ Hint
Your PC may not have all of these cables; just document the ones you do have.
Now it’s your turn!
• 
Data cable from the printer to the PC (both ends)
 
Type of connector: End 1 (PC) __________ End 2 (printer) __________
 
Male or Female: End 1 (PC) __________ End 2 (printer) __________
 
Number of pins/holes/conductors: End 1 (PC) __________ End 2 (printer) __________
• 
Data cable from the keyboard to the PC
 
Type of connector: __________
 
Male or Female: ____________
 
Number of pins/holes/conductors: __________
• 
Data cable from the mouse to the PC

• 
Data cable (telephone wire) from the internal modem to the telephone jack (both ends)
 
Type of connector: __________
 
Male or Female: __________
 
Number of pins/holes/conductors: __________

Lab Exercise 3.03: Recognizing External Connections 
39
Step 5 If you’re working with someone else, play “Flash Cords.” Have your partner hold up various 
cables, and try to guess what they connect to by the connectors on the ends. Then switch roles and quiz 
your partner. Another really good way to learn the connector names is to have your partner sit behind 
the computer, while you reach around from the front, feel the various ports with your ﬁngers, and call 
them out by name. Switch back and forth with each other until you both can easily identify all the 
ports by touch.
Step 6 Properly reconnect all the cables that you removed and prepare to turn on the system. If you 
have an On/Off button on the back of the system, be sure it is set to the on position. Make sure the 
monitor is turned on as well.
Step 7 Examine other computers to see if they have different connectors from the ones you’ve already 
documented. See if you can identify the peripherals that connect to those sockets and plugs.
Step 8 The two system units in Figure 3-5 look different, but they have many connectors in common. 
Try to ﬁnd the following connectors on each system unit:
• 
Power
• 
Monitor
• 
Mouse
• 
Keyboard
• 
Printer
• 
Network

Lab Exercise 3.04: Safeguarding Against  
Damage from Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)
So far, everything that you’ve explored has been accessible without removing the cover of the PC. In 
the next few labs, you’ll be opening up the case to explore the components inside. As discussed in Mike 
Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs, good techs always protect themselves and the 
systems they work on from damage caused by electricity and electrostatic discharge (ESD), the movement 
of a static charge from you to something you touch that can cause damage to sensitive electronic 
components. Protecting yourself is fairly easy at this point: unplug the power cord from the electrical 
outlet and from the power supply on the PC (see Figure 3-6).
To protect the system unit’s sensitive components, you can use the following tools:
• 
Anti-static wrist strap
• 
Anti-static mat or anti-static wrist strap and mat combination
• 
Anti-static bag
Proper use of these tools will help safeguard the components of the system unit against ESD damage—
just as removing the power cord from the PC and the wall will help ensure that you are around to work on 
PCs for many years to come!
Learning Objectives
In this lab you will learn the techniques to protect both yourself and the sensitive components of the 
computer system from damage caused by electricity and ESD.
Figure 3-6 Unplug the power cords to protect yourself.

Chapter 3: The Visible PC
42
After completing this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Disconnect the power cord from the PC and the wall outlet, protecting yourself from electrocution
• 
Properly connect an anti-static wrist strap or anti-static wrist strap/mat combination
• 
Properly store unused components in an anti-static bag
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
At least one PC that isn’t vital to your (or anyone else’s) home or business, not necessarily in 
working order but preferably less than a few years old
• 
An anti-static wrist strap
• 
Optional: anti-static mat
• 
Twelve anti-static bags of various sizes
• 
A clean, well-lit workspace of about 3' × 4’ (a kitchen table with some newspaper spread about 
usually makes a fairly decent ad hoc lab bench)
In addition, a lab partner would be useful.
Getting Down to Business
The key to working on PCs without damaging their delicate components is caution. In this exercise, you’ll 
prepare for a cautious (and if done properly, harmless) exploration of the system’s internal organs.
✖ Warning
Shut off the power to your system and unplug the power cord from your PC and from the wall 
socket before you do the following exercise.
Step 1 Disconnect all the external cables (monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.) from the PC you are 
going to use and place it on a ﬂat, stable surface (preferably on an anti-static mat) near which you can 
sit or stand comfortably to inspect the insides.
Step 2 Using whichever method applies to your case (thumbscrews, Phillips-head screws, locking tabs, 
or Torx screws), remove the cover of your system unit. Don’t get frustrated if the cover-removal method 
isn’t obvious at ﬁrst. Even seasoned techs can have a hard time ﬁguring out how an unfamiliar case opens.
Step 3 Locate a place on the chassis (the metal frame inside the case) to which you can attach the 
alligator clip of the anti-static wrist strap or anti-static mat (whichever one you decided to purchase). 
Be prepared to wear the anti-static wrist strap in later labs (see Figure 3-7).

Lab Exercise 3.05: Disassembling the System Unit and Identifying Internal Components and Connections
43
Step 4 Locate and place the anti-static bags on your workspace. These will be used in later labs to store 
components safely after removal. This machine may be disassembled for a few days, so you’ll need to protect 
the components from any ESD exposure during that time. Anti-static bags do a great job of preventing ESD.
S 60 minutes
Lab Exercise 3.05: Disassembling the System Unit and 
Identifying Internal Components and Connections
As promised, it’s ﬁnally time to go under the hood!
You’re now going to walk through the complete disassembly of the system unit. You should try to do 
this in the sequence presented in this lab exercise, but, depending on the conﬁguration of the machine 
you are disassembling, you may have to perform one or two of the steps out of sequence. For example, 
you may have to remove an optical drive before you can gain access to remove the power supply.
When you’re on the job, you’ll encounter different models of personal computers manufactured 
by different companies. Along with learning the slightly different methods of component removal and 
installation, you should also learn how to identify the major internal parts of the PC system, regardless 
of the manufacturer. This lab exercise will help you practice doing that.
Learning Objectives
In this lab exercise you will locate, remove, and describe the various internal components and 
connectors of a standard PC system.
Figure 3-7 Proper use of an anti-static wrist strap

Chapter 3: The Visible PC
44
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Remove all major components of a PC
• 
Recognize all major components inside a PC
• 
Describe the function of each component
• 
Deﬁne the relationship of internal components to external connections
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
At least one PC that isn’t vital to your (or anyone else’s) home or business, not necessarily in 
working order but preferably less than a few years old
• 
An anti-static wrist strap
• 
Optional: an anti-static mat
• 
Twelve anti-static bags of various sizes
• 
A simple technician’s toolkit
• 
A plastic cup or box to organize the various screws, nuts, and bolts that you’ll remove
• 
A clean, well-lit workspace of about 3' × 4’ (a kitchen table with some newspaper spread about 
usually makes a fairly decent ad hoc lab bench)
• 
A notepad on which to take notes and make sketches of the computer and components
• 
Optionally, a digital camera to record the placement, conﬁguration, connections, and connectors 
associated with the components you’ll be removing from the system unit
In addition, a lab partner would be useful.
Getting Down to Business
This lab exercise might remind you of the biology labs in which students dissect animal specimens. 
You’ll be going inside to examine and remove various parts—but unlike in those biology labs, your 
specimen has a good chance of leading a perfectly normal life afterward!
✖ Warning
Shut off the power to your system and unplug the power cord from your PC and from the wall 
socket before you do the following exercise.
Step 1 Disconnect all the external cables (monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.) from the PC you are 
going to use and place it on a ﬂat, stable surface (preferably on an anti-static mat) near which you can 
sit or stand comfortably to inspect the insides.

Lab Exercise 3.05: Disassembling the System Unit and Identifying Internal Components and Connections
45
Step 2 Use proper anti-static procedures while opening the case and during this entire exercise (see 
Lab Exercise 3.04). Using whichever method applies to your case (thumbscrews, Phillips-head screws, 
locking tabs, or Torx screws), remove the cover of your system unit and then lay the system down so 
that the open side faces the ceiling.
✔ Cross-Reference
Review Chapter 3 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs to conﬁrm your 
understanding of proper ESD procedures, and how to open a PC system case.
Look inside your system case. What do you see? To begin with, you’ll see lots of cables and wires. 
Some appear to be single-colored wires, while others seem to be multiple gray-colored wires in the shape 
of wide ribbons. Most colored wires originate at the power supply and end at the various devices to 
supply the needed direct current (DC) power to run the PC. The wide ribbon cables attach at various points 
and are used to transfer data. These are sometimes referred to as logic cables or data cables.
See if you can locate in your system case the major components labeled in Figure 3-8. You may have 
to move some of the fan shrouds, wires, and cables in order to ﬁnd them, especially components on the 
motherboard—but remember your anti-static procedures and be gentle. Sometimes the slightest bump 
is enough to unseat a connection.
Step 3 Now it’s time to take some notes, draw some sketches, or take a few pictures. Before you start 
disassembling this machine, document where the components belong and what wires and cables are 
connected to the different components. Be prepared to take a few notes on how you actually removed 
the component. Include as much detail as possible; it will help you tremendously when you’re putting 
the system unit back together.

Step 4 To start, you’ll need to clear the way—a bit like peeling an onion, layer by layer—by removing 
the easily accessible components and cables ﬁrst.
Look inside the PC and ﬁnd the expansion slots. How many total expansion cards can be plugged 
into your system? ____________________________________________________________________
Some of the expansion slots may have cards in them. These may be modem cards, sound cards, 
network cards, or video cards. Since expansion cards are designed to “expand” the capability of the 
computer system, they are designed to be installed after the system unit is assembled. For this reason, 
the expansion cards are a great place to begin your disassembly.
Look at the expansion cards installed in your PC, and then look at the external connectors on each. 
Can you match the cable to the expansion card?
Remove all installed expansion cards from your system unit. Place each card into an anti-static bag 
to protect it from ESD damage.
Step 5 If the machine you are disassembling is only a few years old, it will probably have multiple fan 
shrouds to make sure the airﬂow is getting to the main components to keep them cool.
Remove any fan shrouds from your system unit and place them out of the way on your work space.
✔ Hint
After you remove each item, especially the bulky items such as fan shrouds, wiring, and cables, 
it would be good to take a few more notes or pictures. Now that you have a better view of the 
components underneath, you will be able to consult these notes or pictures during reassembly.
You can complete the next three steps in the order written, or out of order if that works best for 
your system unit. You’ll be removing the power supply wires, the power supply, and the data cables from 
the components and motherboard. If one of the data cables is in the way of one of the wires, it’s okay to 
remove the data cable ﬁrst. Please remember to keep good records (notes or photos) of your conﬁguration.
Step 6 Locate the power supply, which is a large silver or black box in one corner of the system unit 
case. Trace the colored wires leading out of it. Remember to be gentle!
Find the power plug(s) for the motherboard. If you have a newer PC, it will probably look like the 
one shown in Figure 3-9.
Find the power connectors for the ﬂoppy drive, optical drive, and hard drives. Do they look like one 
of the connectors shown in Figure 3-10? They should!
Remove all the power connectors from the motherboard and all data drives. Place them to the side 
as best as you can until you remove the power supply itself.

Lab Exercise 3.05: Disassembling the System Unit and Identifying Internal Components and Connections
47
Step 7 If possible, remove the power supply at this point. If there are still many cables and 
components in the way, you can perform this step later in the lab.
Step 8 Look at the ﬂoppy drive, which should be attached to a ﬂat ribbon cable. (Don’t worry if your 
system doesn’t have a ﬂoppy drive—just move on and explore your other data drives.) Trace the ribbon 
cable to the motherboard. Do the same for all your other data drives, both hard drives, and optical drives.
These ribbon cables are about 1.5 inches wide, and they are normally gray with a colored stripe on 
one side. The stripe—usually red—orients the cable properly to the connections on the motherboard 
and the drive.
Figure 3-9 Power plug for the motherboard
Figure 3-10 Power connectors

Chapter 3: The Visible PC
48
The cable to the ﬂoppy drive has 34 wires (conductors) and in most cases has a twist in the center. 
Its position relative to this seven-wire twist determines whether a ﬂoppy drive is the primary or A: 
drive for the system (attached to the connector at the end of the cable past the twist), or the secondary B: 
drive on the system (attached to the center connector).
✔ Hint
It’s rare to ﬁnd one ﬂoppy drive in a newer system, let alone two. Systems without a ﬂoppy 
drive will also be without a ﬂoppy drive cable, though you may still have a 34-pin connector on 
the motherboard. Systems with only one ﬂoppy drive may have a shorter ﬂoppy drive cable with 
no twist and no second drive connector.
Current systems use small, seven-wire data cables for serial ATA (SATA) hard drives and optical 
drives; these cables have connectors keyed like the letter L. Older systems use wider, 40- or 80-wire ﬂat 
ribbon cables. Both of these wider cable types still have a colored edge on one side for orientation.
Step 9 After noting the current state of the data cables, disconnect and reconnect each device’s cable 
in turn. Practice this a few times. Can you plug a cable in backwards? Try it. Plug the cable into the 
device the wrong way if you can. Older types of cables can be plugged in incorrectly, but newer cables 
and connectors have built-in keying to prevent this from happening. Make sure that the cables are 
properly connected when you’ve ﬁnished.
Now look at where the ribbon cables connect to the motherboard. Make note of the proper cable 
orientation. Practice disconnecting and reconnecting the cables at the motherboard. Is it difﬁcult  
(or possible) to plug these cables in backwards?
When you feel you have practiced enough, remove the cables and place them safely away from the 
computer on your work surface. Now would be a great time to make a drawing or take a photograph of 
the de-cluttered system unit interior.
Step 10 Most modern systems have a set of small wire and cable runs connecting front panel indicator 
lights (primarily the power-on and hard drive activity LEDs) and front panel universal serial bus (USB) 
ports to the motherboard (see Figure 3-11). Look for these individual wire connections (often collectively 
called case wires), which are usually grouped together near one corner of the motherboard. Make careful 
note of where each tiny connector plugs in—a photo would be incredibly helpful here—and then 
disconnect them all and tuck the wires out of the way.
Step 11 Now that all the wires and cables are removed, you should have plenty of room to ﬁnish up 
the disassembly. You’re now going to remove all the drives. Drives are usually the most cumbersome 
to remove because of the drive cages or frames in which they’re mounted. Figure 3-12 shows an older 
system. Depending on the mounting the manufacturer has used, removing a drive may be as simple 
as pulling out a sliding mechanism, or as complicated as opening up the other side of the system case, 
removing all the decorative plastic facing, and removing a handful of screws.

Lab Exercise 3.05: Disassembling the System Unit and Identifying Internal Components and Connections
49
Remove the ﬂoppy drive, all optical drives that are present, and the hard drive(s), and set them on 
your work surface.
Step 12 Look in your PC and ﬁnd the random access memory (RAM) modules. RAM comes in thin, 
wafer-like modules, about three to ﬁve inches long by one inch wide. A row of metal contacts running 
along one of the long edges plugs into a matching socket, three to ﬁve inches in length, located on the 
motherboard. Look for a long wafer standing on its edge; often you’ll ﬁnd two or more RAM modules 
lined up in a row.
Figure 3-11 Various case wires connected to a motherboard
Figure 3-12 Typical drive conﬁguration in a PC tower system case; 
note the cages or frames used for mounting the various drives

Chapter 3: The Visible PC
50
How many RAM modules do you have? ________________________________________________
Do you have dual inline memory modules (DIMMs) or single inline memory modules (SIMMs)? 
_______________________________________________________________________________
Making sure to follow proper anti-static procedures, remove the SIMMs or DIMMs from their slots 
and place them in an anti-static bag for safekeeping.
Step 13 Look in your PC and see if you can locate the central processing unit (CPU). Running CPUs 
generate a fair amount of heat, so they need their own dedicated cooling mechanisms. Because of this, 
when you search the motherboard to try to ﬁnd the CPU, you’ll generally ﬁnd it hidden under a fan/
heat sink unit.
Carefully remove the fan/heat sink unit from the CPU.
✖ Warning
Make sure you fully understand how to remove your particular model of CPU fan before you try it!
If you were able to remove the fan, make a note of the type of CPU chip you have:
If you’re in a computer lab with multiple systems, examine a number of different CPU chips. Note 
where each CPU is located on the motherboard.
Making sure to follow proper anti-static procedures, lift the lever of the zero insertion force (ZIF) 
socket, remove the CPU, and place it in an anti-static bag for safekeeping.
Step 14 See if you can locate any jumpers or switches on your motherboard. Resist the temptation to 
play with them at this point—just make a note of what you ﬁnd. In particular, look for the identifying 
labels on the motherboard.
Step 15 Making sure to follow proper anti-static procedures, remove the screws that secure the 
motherboard to the chassis or frame of the system case. Place the motherboard in a properly sized anti-
static bag and put it aside.
Congratulations! You have just successfully disassembled your ﬁrst PC! If you have used an area 
where you can leave the components, wires, cabling, and hardware for a while, you can leave the PC 
disassembled for later labs. If you really need to clean up the area for now, you can either follow your 
notes (and lab steps) in reverse order to reassemble the system, or ﬁnd a large box in which to store the 
disassembled machine until your next lab session.

Lab Exercise 3.05: Disassembling the System Unit and Identifying Internal Components and Connections
51
Don’t worry about the ESD-sensitive components; as long as they are in their anti-static bags, they 
should be ﬁne.
Step 16 You have explored and removed nearly all the components of a typical PC system unit. To 
ﬁnish this lab exercise, see if you can correctly match the components in the following list to the items 
indicated in Figure 3-13.

Every good PC technician should know the Windows environment 
inside and out. This is vital to any troubleshooting scenario, and it 
won’t happen automatically—it takes some practice and discovery on 
the technician’s part. You need to be ﬂuent in navigating the PC from a 
user’s perspective. If there’s anything magical about Windows, it’s that 
there’s almost always more than one way to get a desired result, and 
your preferred way might not be the same as your client’s. As a good 
customer-oriented tech, you need to be ﬂexible in your thinking, and this 
comes only through practice and more practice. As you study and work 
through these labs, always look for more than one way to access the ﬁles 
or programs you need. Many of the shortcuts and hot keys you’ll discover 
can be invaluable aids for a busy tech!
✔ Hint
Windows enables right-click menus for most of its buttons, icons, and other screen elements. 
Be sure to right-click everything you see in Windows to explore the many shortcut menus and 
options.
In the ﬁeld, the PC tech is perceived as the Master (or Mistress) of All Things Technical. This might 
not be a fair assessment—for example, why should a PC hardware technician need to know how to open 
and close the user’s programs?—but that’s the way it is. You need to be comfortable and conﬁdent with 
the Windows interface, or you’ll lose all credibility as a PC technician. If you show up to service a PC 
and have trouble moving or resizing a window or locating the information you seek, it won’t instill a lot 
of conﬁdence in your client. There’s nothing more embarrassing to a tech than having to ask the user 
how to ﬁnd or use a Windows feature!
The creators of the CompTIA A+ Certiﬁcation exams understand this, so they test you on Windows 
user-level information, such as using power saving settings, changing the appearance of the interface, 
manipulating ﬁles and folders, locating information stored on drives, and using Windows’ built-in OS 
tools. You must also know how to navigate to the basic Windows features—the CompTIA A+ exams are 
big on identifying paths to features. Although you may already know much of the information about 
to be covered, the labs in this chapter will help you review and perhaps catch a few bits and pieces you 
might have missed along the way.

Lab Exercise 4.01: The Windows Interface

Lab Exercise 4.01: The Windows Interface
Most new PC systems sold as of this writing have Windows Vista or later installed, but keep in mind 
that the A+ exams cover Windows 2000 and Windows XP as well, so you’ll need to be versed in all three. 
Most Windows operating systems come in several editions; for example, Windows XP editions include 
Professional, Home Edition, and Media Center Edition, as well as 64-bit editions. Microsoft targets XP 
Home Edition and Media Center Edition at consumers, while business and power users tend to use XP 
Professional. Windows Vista has various options as well, such as Vista Home Basic and Home Premium 
for consumers, and Vista Business and Ultimate for businesses and power users. Vista editions come in 
32- and 64-bit variations. Windows 2000 comes in only a single version: Windows 2000 Professional. 
➜ Note
Windows 7, though similar in many ways to Windows Vista, is not covered on the exams.
At its most basic level, XP Home Edition is a subset or truncated version of XP Professional. 
According to a Microsoft VP, “Everything you can do in Home Edition, you can do in Pro.” Media Center 
Edition is essentially Home Edition with some added functionality to simplify access to music, video, 
and photos. The major advantages of XP Professional include remote access, tighter security, and the 
ability to network in domains. If possible, try going through these lab exercises with different versions 
or editions of Windows so you can see what changes and what stays the same.
Learning Objectives
The main objective of this exercise is to familiarize you with the different “looks” of Windows. Although 
there are several similarities between each version, especially in appearance,  paths to and locations of 
many tools and features differ considerably, so it’s important to understand both.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Switch the system appearance between the default interface and the Windows Classic style
• 
Switch between the default Start menu mode and the Classic Start menu mode
• 
Switch the view of the Control Panel between the default view and Classic View
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A fully functioning PC with Windows XP or Vista installed

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
58
Getting Down to Business
Windows has a look that’s aligned with a task-oriented Web view. You’ll notice this right away when 
you open a window and look at the title bar and window contents. The newer versions are ﬁlled with 
bright colors, round edges, and big icons. Some feel that this look is a great improvement over previous 
versions of Windows, while others don’t really like it. Happily, though, if you don’t like Windows XP or 
Vista’s native look, you can choose to use the Windows Classic look instead, which more closely resembles 
Windows 2000.
➜ Note
Since this lab is about making newer versions of Windows look like Windows 2000, you won’t be 
able to complete it on a Windows 2000 machine—it’s set to “classic” permanently!
Step 1 To set the system theme to Classic mode, follow these steps:
a. 
Right-click the desktop.
b. 
Select Properties in Windows XP, and Personalize in Windows Vista.
c. 
In Windows XP, the Themes tab is the default view; to get the same result in Vista, click Theme.
d. 
Under Theme, use the drop-down menu to select Windows Classic (see Figure 4-1).
e. 
Click Apply and then click OK.
Figure 4-1 Changing the theme to Windows 
Classic in Windows XP

Lab Exercise 4.01: The Windows Interface
59
Switch back and forth between the default and classic interfaces. Each time, open other windows to 
observe the different looks.
✔ Hint
To give your windows and buttons the Windows Classic look without changing personalized 
settings such as your wallpaper, you can select the Appearance tab instead of Themes; click the 
Windows and buttons drop-down list and select Windows Classic style. Vista has separated all these 
options into menus of their own, so I encourage you to explore them all and change various 
settings to get the look you desire.
Step 2 Changing the theme of your Windows XP interface doesn’t change the way the Start menu 
works, which is signiﬁcantly different from earlier versions of Windows. The Start menu has the same 
functionality as in previous Windows versions, but it was restyled for XP. As it does for the overall 
screen look, Windows XP enables you to change the Start menu to Classic mode, if you prefer it that 
way. Before you can explore the XP style of Start menu, though, you need to know which style you’re 
working with. The following steps will ensure that your Windows XP system is using the Windows XP 
Start menu style:
a. 
Right-click the Start button and select Properties to display the Taskbar and Start Menu 
Properties dialog box.
b. 
Select the Start Menu tab.
c. 
Select the Start menu radio button.
d. 
Click OK.
➜ Note
Vista has eliminated the word “Start” from the Start menu button and replaced it with a button 
that displays the Vista logo.
Click Start to open the Start menu. Notice that the left side of the Start menu shows your recently 
used applications. You can adjust the number of applications that Windows displays there. The top two 
applications are the default Web browser and e-mail client, which you can also modify. Follow these 
steps:
a. 
Right-click the Start button and select Properties.
b. 
Select the Start Menu tab.

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
60
c. 
Be sure the Start menu radio button is selected, and click Customize.
d. 
Under the General tab (see Figure 4-2), change any of the following settings if you like:
• 
The number of programs on the Start menu
• 
Whether to show the icons for your preferred Internet and e-mail programs
You’ll notice in Vista that you also have access to the Notiﬁcation and Toolbars menu as well.
The Start menu’s All Programs menu shows a list of all programs installed on the system; it works 
like the Programs menu in Windows Vista.
Step 3 Earlier versions of Windows included icons for My Computer and My Documents on the 
desktop by default, but Windows XP and Vista only show the Recycle Bin. These other icons are now in 
the Start menu, but you can add them to the desktop, too:
a. 
Click the Start button.
b. 
Right-click My Computer in the menu. Vista eliminates the word “My,” so right-click Computer.
c. 
Select Show on Desktop.
d. 
Repeat steps a through c for My Documents. Again, Vista eliminates the word “My,” so right-
click Documents.

Step 4 For greatest compatibility with the lab exercises in upcoming chapters, you should now put 
your Start menu in the Classic Start menu mode.
To set the Start menu to Classic mode, follow these steps:
a. 
Right-click the Start button.
b. 
Select Properties.
c. 
Choose Classic Start menu.
d. 
Click OK.
✖ Warning
Most of the following lab exercises will assume you have a Windows XP or Vista system in the 
Classic mode.
Step 5 Another change that came with the advent of Windows XP (and continued with Vista) is the 
way you view the Control Panel. The Control Panel icon now opens by default in Category View (see 
Figure 4-3).
Figure 4-3 Viewing the Control Panel in Category View

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
62
Follow these steps to switch the Control Panel view between Category View (default) and Classic View:
a. 
On the Classic Start menu, select Start | Settings | Control Panel.
b. 
Depending on how it was conﬁgured when you turned on the system, you’ll see either the 
Category View (default) or Classic View of the Control Panel.
c. 
An option on the top-left sidebar in the Control Panel enables you to switch between the two 
views.
d. 
Set your Control Panel to Classic View for the rest of the exercises.

Lab Exercise 4.02: The Windows Desktop
The Windows desktop is the starting point for all operations. It doesn’t matter whether you have a 
new Vista installation or an existing installation of Windows 2000 from years ago; there’s a desktop 
graphical user interface (GUI) that you can use as a home base. The purpose of this lab exercise is to 
ensure that you’re familiar with the desktop.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll work with certain features of the Windows desktop.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use the Windows taskbar
• 
Run a program from the Start menu
• 
Change settings for the Recycle Bin
• 
Change the appearance of the desktop
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Vista

Lab Exercise 4.02: The Windows Desktop

➜ Note
Though outlining every step for each Windows operating system is beyond the scope of this 
book, these labs are designed to be as Windows-generic as possible. You should develop and 
practice the ability to navigate through the interface, achieving the end result, even if you are 
working with a version of Windows 2000 or the latest version of Windows 7 Ultimate. If the 
lab exercise doesn’t produce the expected results, it may be because you’re using a different 
operating system than the one used to write and illustrate the exercise. I’ve tried to show you 
a variety of examples. Be ﬂexible and look on your system for the same results via a different 
method.
Getting Down to Business
For most users, the Windows desktop is the interface to computer applications and folders that they use 
every day. Even though you may already be comfortable with the desktop, you should walk through the 
steps to validate and refresh your skills. Everything you see has a purpose, with the possible exception 
of the background wallpaper—but even that has amusement value! You most likely have icons that start 
a variety of programs, such as My Computer/Computer, Internet Explorer, and Outlook Express, and you 
have the taskbar with all of its built-in features. Make sure you know where everything is, and what 
everything does!
Oh, and don’t forget that with the proper video card installed, Windows Vista allows you to enable 
the Aero interface, which adds visual stimulation to the desktop by the use of transparencies and the 
Windows Flip 3D screen. If Aero is disabled and you want to enable it, right-click your desktop, select 
Personalize, select Window Color and Appearance, and click the text that reads Open classic appearance 
properties for more color options. Next, choose Windows Aero in the Color Scheme window and click OK. 
Now test the fun feature of Aero by pressing the WINDOWS and TAB keys and ﬂipping through windows. By 
adding the CTRL key to that sequence, you can keep Flip 3D open and cycle through various windows as 
needed with just the TAB key.
✔ Cross-Reference
To refresh your memory on the various parts of the Windows interface, refer to the “User 
Interface” section in Chapter 4 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
64
Step 1 The taskbar, by default, runs along the bottom of the Windows desktop (although you can 
move it to any side: top, bottom, left, or right). The taskbar handles a number of critical jobs. Most 
important, it displays the Start button, probably the most frequently clicked button on all Windows 
systems. To ﬁnd the Start button, look at the far left end of the taskbar (see Figure 4-4). Next to it is 
the Quick Launch toolbar, if it’s currently turned on (see the accompanying Hint). At the right end of 
the taskbar is the notiﬁcation area—often referred to as the system tray—which displays the time and 
any number of small icons for system programs currently stored in RAM. In the middle of the taskbar 
are buttons representing the user-started programs that are currently running.
✔ Hint
If you don’t see the Quick Launch toolbar, point to an unused area of the taskbar, right-click, 
and select Properties. Check the Show Quick Launch box and click OK. You can now drag 
program icons or even folder shortcuts from the desktop onto the Quick Launch toolbar for 
quick access any time.
Step 2 Microsoft says, “Everything starts with Start.” Clicking the Start button opens the Start menu, 
where you’ll ﬁnd the programs available on the system, the system settings via the Control Panel, 
and various system tools such as Search and Help. Another useful feature is the ability to review your 
recent documents. The Start button is also where you’ll ﬁnd the Shut Down command, as odd as that 
may seem.
Click the Start button. Look closely at the icons on the Start menu. Some icons have a small 
arrow pointing to the right on the edge of the menu bar. When you see an arrow, it means there’s 
another menu beyond the one you’re observing. To access the next menu, slide your mouse pointer 
across the highlighted Start menu icon area toward the arrow and into the next menu. This concept 
applies throughout Windows (see Figure 4-5). If you don’t choose to click an option, you’ll need to click 
somewhere else on the desktop to tell Windows, “Never mind—close the Start menu.” Work through the 
following navigation steps using Notepad to explore many of the methods, menus, settings, and options 
that are provided to you through the Windows desktop.
a. 
Open Notepad by clicking Start | All Programs | Accessories | Notepad.
• 
Type the following sentence and save the ﬁle in the My Documents (or Documents, in Vista) 
folder as Command Line Test.txt (see Figure 4-6):
This is a small sentence of text created in Notepad that I will visit again in the Lab Exercises 
in Chapter 15.
• 
Close Notepad.
Figure 4-4 The Windows XP taskbar

Lab Exercise 4.02: The Windows Desktop
65
b. 
Open Notepad by clicking Start | Run, typing notepad in the dialog box, and clicking OK.
• 
Open Command Line Test.txt by clicking File | Open, navigating to the My Documents/
Documents folder, and selecting the appropriate ﬁle.
• 
Close Notepad.
c. 
Open Notepad from the Start menu’s recent documents/items list.
• 
Click Start | Documents/Recent Items | Command Line Test.txt.
• 
Close Notepad.
Figure 4-5 Exploring cascading menus
Figure 4-6 Using Notepad

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
66
✔ Hint
Each time you open Notepad, you should be able to open and edit the text ﬁle Command Line 
Test.txt. You should also see a corresponding button appear in the taskbar. The button, space 
permitting, includes an icon for the application, the ﬁlename, and the application name. 
Folders also appear in the taskbar with an icon and folder name, but no associated application.
Step 3 Now look all the way on the right side of the taskbar. This is ofﬁcially called the notiﬁcation 
area, but as I noted earlier, it’s often called the system tray. In spite of Microsoft’s ofﬁcial terminology, 
most techs call it the system tray, so I’ll call it that for the sake of this exercise as well.
At the far right end of the system tray, you should see a display of the current time; on most 
Windows systems, you’ll also see a number of small icons in this area of the taskbar. These icons 
represent programs running in the background.
You often see icons in the system tray for network status, volume controls, and virus programs, and 
laptops may have additional icons for battery state and PC Card status. What you see in the system tray 
depends on your version of Windows, what hardware you use, and what programs you have loaded.
Click the various icons in your system tray to see what they do. Depending on the icon, you may 
need to click, double-click, or right-click and select from a menu.
Step 4 Now you’ll look at customizing your environment. (Once again, the Start menu should be in 
the Classic mode.)
Right-click on the taskbar and select Properties. This opens the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties 
dialog box, which you brought up before by right-clicking the Start button and selecting Properties.
Each version of Windows has a slightly different look, but you’ll ﬁnd the following three items 
listed in some manner on the leftmost tab of the Taskbar and Start Menu (or equivalent) dialog box in 
all Windows versions:
• 
Show the clock controls the time display in the right side of the taskbar.
 
Turn off the Show the clock option and click Apply. Did the time disappear from the taskbar? 
___________________________
 
Select the Show the clock option again and click Apply. Does the time now show up in the taskbar? 
___________________________
• 
Auto-hide the taskbar makes the taskbar disappear until you point the mouse at the edge of 
the screen where the taskbar resides (generally the bottom edge), or press the Windows Start 
key on the keyboard. Why would you want to hide the taskbar? For certain programs, you need 
all the display area you can get. The auto-hide feature minimizes the taskbar to allow more 
room on the screen.

Lab Exercise 4.02: The Windows Desktop
67
 
Select Auto-hide the taskbar and click Apply. Did the taskbar disappear? ____________________
 
Move your mouse pointer toward the bottom of the screen. Does the taskbar pop up when you 
reach the bottom? _____________________
 
Turn the auto-hide feature off again. Is the taskbar now visible on your screen? ____________
• 
Keep the taskbar on top of other windows prevents programs from covering up the taskbar. 
If you observe a program using the entire screen, you know this feature is turned off, and 
you can’t access the taskbar until you resize the program window or press the Windows Start 
button on your keyboard.
Step 5 As you know, a ﬁle isn’t actually erased from your hard drive when you delete it. When you delete 
a ﬁle in Windows, a shortcut to the deleted ﬁle is saved in the Recycle Bin. It stays there until you empty 
the Recycle Bin, until you restore the folder or ﬁle, or until the Recycle Bin grows larger than a preset size. 
Once you empty it, the ﬁles are permanently deleted, so make sure you’re certain before you do this.
✔ Hint
Remember that most everything in Windows has Properties settings, which you can generally 
access by right-clicking the object and selecting Properties. You can also access Properties by 
highlighting the object and pressing ALT-ENTER.
To change the Recycle Bin’s properties, access the Recycle Bin settings by right-clicking the Recycle 
Bin icon on the desktop and selecting Properties. Your Recycle Bin Properties dialog box may look 
different because of the version of Windows you have, because you have multiple hard drives, or because 
of some other factor, but all versions basically work the same way (see Figure 4-7).
Figure 4-7 Setting properties for the Recycle Bin in Windows XP

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
68
Note that 10% is the default amount of drive space to use for the Recycle Bin. Change this to 5% 
and close the Recycle Bin Properties dialog box. Vista adds some interesting new features beyond what 
Windows’ other versions offer. In particular, Vista lets you set the Recycle Bin size in bytes instead of 
percentage of drive size (see Figure 4-8).
✔ Hint
If a hard drive starts to run low on space, emptying the Recycle Bin is a quick way to try freeing 
up some space.
Step 6 Microsoft gives you many ways to change the look of your desktop to suit your personal 
preferences, from the color of the background to the size of the fonts. There are too many possible 
combinations to cover them all, so you’ll look at only the most popular one, the background graphic. 
Follow these steps:
a. 
Right-click in an unused area of the desktop and select Properties. Again, Personalize is the 
choice for Vista users.
b. 
Select the Desktop tab. (It’s the Background tab in Windows 2000, and Desktop Background in 
Vista.)
c. 
Choose a background of your choice and click Apply.

Bin in Windows Vista

Lab Exercise 4.03: Windows Explorer
69
✔ Hint
When you become more familiar with Windows, you can use the Browse button to locate your 
own photo to use for the background.
Step 7 One other thing to look at while you have the Display Properties dialog box open, which you 
should also remember for the CompTIA A+ exams, is where to locate the Power Savings settings.
a. 
Click the Screen Saver tab in the Display Properties dialog box.
b. 
At the bottom of the dialog box, you should see the Energy Star icon. Click the Power button 
next to this icon. In Vista, click the Change Power Settings menu option.
c. 
Look at all the different settings here, and note exactly what you clicked to help you remember 
where to ﬁnd them in the future.

Lab Exercise 4.03: Windows Explorer
Windows Explorer is a program that enables you to see all the program and data ﬁles on a given storage 
device. Explorer works with hard drives and removable media such as optical media, USB ﬂash drives, 
and ﬂoppy diskettes. Everyday users and technicians alike use this program more than any other when 
they need to locate and manipulate ﬁles and folders.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll explore the Windows ﬁle structure.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use Windows Explorer
• 
Understand and use the contents of the Windows and Program Files folders
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Vista
✔ Hint
You can perform these steps on any Windows system, but some of them may involve 
functionality that’s available only in Windows XP.

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
70
Getting Down to Business
When you click (or double-click) a folder icon to view what’s inside, you’re seeing Windows Explorer in 
action. It’s really just a great graphical interface that enables you to see and manipulate ﬁles, folders, 
and their organizational structures quickly and easily, without memorizing a bunch of commands. 
Becoming familiar with its ins and outs is vital to becoming an effective PC technician.
Step 1 Begin by looking at the internal directory structure of Windows. Start Windows Explorer by 
selecting Start | All Programs | Accessories | Windows Explorer.
Look at the top of the list on the left pane of the Windows Explorer window; you’ll notice an icon 
called Desktop. Anything you put directly under this folder will appear on the desktop itself, as well as 
in a “Desktop” folder on your C: drive. Remember that C: is your root directory (on a standard Windows 
system), and no ﬁle stored on the hard drive is “outside” that. The ﬁrst place to go exploring in the 
Windows directory structure is the root directory:
a. 
Locate the My Computer/Computer icon in the left pane of Windows Explorer and click the 
plus sign (+). If it already has a minus sign (−) to the left, leave it there and continue.
b. 
Locate the C: drive icon, and click it once to highlight it. You should not need to click the 
plus sign, as clicking the drive’s icon automatically expands its contents. The right pane now 
displays the contents of the root directory of your C: drive (see Figure 4-9). Now, check out 
Vista’s look using the similar path indicated in Step a.
Figure 4-9 Viewing C:\ in Windows Explorer on Windows XP

Lab Exercise 4.03: Windows Explorer
71
✔ Hint
You can choose from several different views, or ways of displaying folder contents. The view 
shown in Figure 4-9 is called Icons view; other views include Thumbnails, Tiles, List, and 
Details. When you open the View menu, the current view is marked with a large black dot. You 
can switch views as often as you like, simply by selecting another view from the list. For the 
same result in Vista, just click the Views menu and rotate through the various screens available.
c. 
Find the folders named WINDOWS (sometimes named WINNT in Windows 2000) and Program 
Files. These two folders contain the majority of your operating system and program ﬁles.
d. 
Click the WINDOWS (or WINNT) folder icon. Look at Figure 4-10 for a sample of what you 
should see at this point if you’re running Windows XP.
Figure 4-10 Exploring the WINDOWS folder

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
72
✖ Warning
Some system administrators may have changed the names of these folders, but in general this is 
not the best practice. If you need to contact Microsoft for assistance, they always start by directing 
you to the default folder names, so changing them can increase your troubleshooting time.
Step 2 In the next few substeps, you’ll conﬁgure your folder options to provide the maximum 
information about your ﬁles and folders. Techs usually ﬁnd that the more information they have about 
a component, the easier it is to troubleshoot or conﬁgure. Take a moment and explore the different 
folders and ﬁles in the WINDOWS folder. A typical WINDOWS folder will have more than 15,000 ﬁles 
in more than 1000 folders (see Figure 4-11). To view the number of ﬁles and folders in your WINDOWS 
folder, click the WINDOWS folder and then right-click somewhere in the blank area of the right pane 
and select Properties from the drop-down menu.
a. 
Maximize your Windows Explorer window (if it isn’t already) by clicking the small box icon 
next to the × icon in the upper-right corner of the window. Then click the Views icon in the 
toolbar at the top left of the screen, and select Details.
b. 
Notice the column headings across the right pane, as shown in Figure 4-12. Click each of these 
headings to sort by that value. Click any heading again to sort in reverse order.
c. 
In Windows XP, select Tools | Folder Options. In Vista, select Organize | Folder and Search 
Options.
Figure 4-11 Viewing the WINDOWS 
folder’s properties

Lab Exercise 4.03: Windows Explorer
73
d. 
Select the View tab.
e. 
In the Advanced settings area, click the radio button Show hidden ﬁles and folders. This displays 
all ﬁles and folders, even those for which the Hidden attribute has been set.
f. 
Remove the check mark next to Hide extensions for known ﬁle types. This directs Windows Explorer 
to display the ﬁlename extensions in all views. This is useful for a tech, and these days it also 
helps users with things like identifying e-mail viruses hiding as (for instance) FILE.MP3.SCR.
g. 
Remove the check mark next to Hide protected operating system ﬁles (Recommended). This will 
enable you to examine critical system ﬁles (for example C:\boot.ini or C:\bootmgr) when 
troubleshooting problems.
h. 
Click Apply to commit these changes to the folder view.
i. 
Before closing the folder options, click Apply to All Folders in the Folder views section. This 
will apply the Details view to every folder on the system, and enable you to see ﬁle extensions, 
hidden ﬁles, and system ﬁles in all folders as well.
j. 
Sort the folders and ﬁles by Type (click the Type column heading), and see if you can locate 
the ﬁles with these extensions:
• 
.INI These are initialization ﬁles used to install and conﬁgure the system.
• 
.BMP These are Windows bitmap graphics.
• 
.EXE These are executable ﬁles (in other words, programs).
• 
.TXT These are text ﬁles containing only ASCII text and symbols, readable across a wide 
range of systems.
k. 
Sort the list by Name, and locate these ﬁles:
• 
EXPLORER.EXE This is the Windows Explorer application you’re using for these 
exercises.
• 
DESKTOP.INI This contains the conﬁguration data for your desktop.
• 
WIN.INI This contains conﬁguration settings for the boot process.
✖ Warning
Do not alter these ﬁles in any way! You won’t like the results.
Figure 4-12 Windows Explorer column headings in Details view

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
74
Step 3 Although MS-DOS is no longer used as an operating system, some of the original MS-DOS 
applications (commands) are still very much alive. These are now launched from the command-line 
interface in Windows as well as when you need to invoke the Recovery Console. As a PC technician, 
you’re likely to need one or more of these command-line tools, so you’ll work with some of them in 
Chapter 15; for now, you should just learn where to ﬁnd them.
a. 
While still in Windows Explorer, ﬁnd the C:\WINDOWS\System32 folder and open it. This 
folder stores all the command-line applications.
b. 
Sort the details list by Type, scroll down to the MS-DOS applications, and locate these ﬁles (see 
Figure 4-13):
• 
FORMAT.COM This is used to prepare hard drives and ﬂoppy diskettes for storing data.
• 
EDIT.COM This text editor program can create and modify conﬁguration ﬁles in the 
command-line mode. The Windows equivalent is Notepad.
If you’re using Vista, you may have to add the Type column. Right-click the column bar as shown in 
Figure 4-14 and check Type.
Step 4 When working with modern-day Windows, it’s important to know the key system ﬁles 
involved in the boot process and fundamental core ﬁles. Use the Search for ﬁles and folders tool to locate 
and record the absolute path of the following system ﬁles. For a list of all command-line commands, 
open the Command Prompt and type help.
✔ Cross-Reference
For additional information on the ﬁles used to boot the Windows operating system, review the “The 
Boot Process” section in Chapter 4 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Figure 4-13 Locating command-line 
applications in Windows XP

Lab Exercise 4.03: Windows Explorer
75
a. 
Click Start | Search | For Files or Folders, then click All ﬁles and folders, and ﬁnally click More 
advanced options.
b. 
Select the following check boxes (Figure 4-15):
• 
Search system folders
• 
Search hidden ﬁles and folders
• 
Search subfolders
c. 
If you’re running Windows 2000 or XP, look in the local hard drive (on most systems this will 
be the C: drive) where your operating system is located and search for the following ﬁles. Make 
notes of their absolute paths:
• 
NTLDR The ﬁlename is an abbreviation for NT Loader. This ﬁle is the “master of 
ceremonies,” responsible for beginning the boot process and launching the other system 
ﬁles.
• 
BOOT.INI This text ﬁle lists all operating systems available to the NTLDR. Double-click 
BOOT.INI in the Search Results window and examine the contents of the ﬁle. This is an 
important, editable ﬁle, especially on a multiboot system where you may need to change 
the boot order of the operating systems.
• 
NTDETECT.COM This ﬁle detects installed hardware on systems that boot Windows 2000 
or XP.
• 
HAL.DLL This ﬁle loads many of the Hardware Abstraction Layer drivers.
• 
NTOSKRNL.EXE The ﬁlename is an abbreviation for the NT Operating System Kernel. 
This ﬁle completes the loading of the Windows Registry, initiates all device drivers, and 
starts WINLOGON.EXE to display the Windows logon screen.
Figure 4-14 Adding the Type column in Windows Vista

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
76
d. 
If you’re running Vista, you have a different group of critical boot ﬁles. All of the 2000/XP 
boot ﬁles are now consolidated in one BOOTMGR ﬁle. Using the same method described, see if 
you can ﬁnd BOOTMGR. It’s almost always on the C: drive.
Step 5 Some of the other important folders and their contents are listed here. Look at each one to 
gain more experience using Windows Explorer. Remember, the location may be slightly different across 
the Windows family of operating systems. For instance, Windows 2000 uses WINNT as the default 
Windows folder. These are the folders you’ll ﬁnd:
• 
WINDOWS\CURSORS Windows stores the many different cursors you can use here.
• 
WINDOWS\FONTS Windows stores all its fonts in this folder. Note that fonts usually have one 
of two extensions, .FON or .TTF. The .FON ﬁles are the old-style screen fonts, and the .TTF ﬁles 
Figure 4-15 The Search utility in Windows XP

Lab Exercise 4.03: Windows Explorer
77
are modern TrueType fonts. You can double-click a font icon to see what the font looks like. Some 
users even print their favorite fonts and keep them in a three-ring binder for later reference.
• 
WINDOWS\HELP This folder is the default location for all .HLP and .CHM (help) ﬁles. Open 
one to see what program uses it.
• 
WINDOWS\MEDIA This folder is the default location for sounds and audio clips. Double-
click a ﬁle with a .WAV or .MID extension to hear sounds.
• 
WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 This folder is the heart of Windows. Here you can see the core 
operating system ﬁles: HAL.DLL and NTOSKRNL.EXE. This folder also stores almost all of the 
.DLL ﬁles used by Windows.
Step 6 Collapse the WINDOWS folder, and expand the Program Files folder (see Figure 4-16). Microsoft 
doesn’t like people messing around in these folders, so you may have to look to the left and click 
Show Files to see the folders. This is the default location for applications installed on your system. 
(Remember to scroll down if you can’t see the end of the list.)
Figure 4-16 Exploring C:\Program Files in Windows Explorer

Follow these steps:
a. 
Open the Windows Media Player subfolder, and ﬁnd the application. Remember to look for the 
.EXE extension.
b. 
Click the .EXE ﬁle icon to start the program.
c. 
Close the program you just opened.
d. 
Exit Windows Explorer.

Lab Exercise 4.04: The Windows Control Panel
The Windows Control Panel is the technician’s toolbox. It contains the tools you need to do everything 
from changing the mouse settings to installing new device drivers. This lab exercise won’t attempt to 
examine every tool in the Control Panel, but it will help you become familiar with many of them. Some 
Control Panel programs—known as applets—are speciﬁc to particular hardware, while others are used 
for software conﬁguration. Windows initially sets up defaults that work for most installations, but as a 
technician, you may need to tweak some of the settings. Also, not all Windows features are enabled in a 
normal installation, so you may need to enable or disable features according to the needs of a particular 
user.
✔ Cross-Reference
For a refresher on the Windows Control Panel, refer to the “Control Panel” section in Chapter 4 
of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll practice accessing the Control Panel and making conﬁguration adjustments.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Navigate to the Control Panel
• 
Explain the use of some common Control Panel applets
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer running Windows 2000, XP, or Vista

Lab Exercise 4.04: The Windows Control Panel
79
Getting Down to Business
The Control Panel is the toolbox, and one of the key tools in the Control Panel is the Device Manager. 
The Device Manager lists all your system hardware. From it you can load drivers, set resources, and 
conﬁgure other aspects of your hardware devices. You’ll now get familiar with both.
Step 1 As a technician, you’ll access the Control Panel and the Device Manager often. You really do 
need to know the path to these important tools in each versions of Windows. The CompTIA A+ exams 
have numerous questions about paths to these tools.
✔ Hint
Throughout the rest of this manual, when a lab involves changing settings located in the 
Control Panel or the Device Manager, the directions will assume you know how to get that far, 
and the steps will begin with the Control Panel or Device Manager already open. Refer back to 
this exercise if you need a refresher on opening the Control Panel.
a. 
To open the Control Panel, click on the Start button.  In Windows 2000 and the Classic view of 
other versions, select Settings, then Control Panel. In Windows XP and Vista, select Control 
Panel directly from the Start menu. The Control Panel dialog box opens, as shown in Figures 4-17 
and 4-18.
Figure 4-17 The Control Panel (Classic View) in Windows XP

b. 
Start with the System applet. The System applet is the gateway to many important tools and 
utilities you will use as a PC technician. You’ll explore some of these utilities in other labs 
throughout the manual; for now, just take a high-level view of the following:
• 
Device Manager In Windows 2000 and XP, select the Hardware tab and click the Device 
Manager button to see a list of hardware installed in your system. In Vista, you open the 
Device Manager directly, but it can also be found in the System applet. Expand various 
items to see the list of devices in each area. Highlighting any device, right-clicking, and 
selecting Properties will give you conﬁguration information for that device. You’ll return 
here later in the lab manual to conﬁgure these devices.
• 
Driver Signing In Windows 2000 and XP, close Device Manager, and while still on the 
Hardware tab, click the Driver Signing button. This is where you tell Windows how to 
handle device drivers that have not been tested and approved by Microsoft. The three 
settings are Ignore, Warn, and Block. In Vista’s Control Panel, open the System applet. 
Click Remote Settings, Continue, the Hardware tab, and then Windows Update Driver 
Settings. Once there, observe the radio button choices, and then click Cancel.

• 
Startup and Recovery Select the Advanced tab and click the Settings button under 
the Startup and Recovery box. Examine the settings for the Startup options. Now, click 
Environment Variables and choose the Edit button for both User and System variables. Do 
you recognize the ﬁle that is displayed?
c. 
Close Notepad and the Startup and Recovery and System Properties dialog boxes, all without 
saving changes.
Step 2 Now examine some other applets in the Control Panel:
a. 
In Windows 2000/XP, double-click the Display icon. This is the same window you see if you 
right-click the desktop and select Properties. Windows Vista uses the Personalization applet for 
many of the same functions. 
b. 
Notice the tab headings in 2000/XP and list of links in Vista. Three are common to all ﬂavors 
of Windows: Screen Saver, Appearance, and Settings. Windows 2000 also has Background, Web, 
and Effects tabs. Windows XP incorporates the contents of those three tabs into two tabs, 
named Themes and Desktop.
✖ Warning
Clicking an Advanced button in the Display applet can give you access to many special features 
of your particular monitor/video card, including the refresh rate. Be sure you know what you’re 
doing before you change these settings!
✔ Hint
If you click the Apply button instead of the OK button after making a change, the Display 
applet will remain open after the change takes effect; this can be useful when you need to 
experiment a bit.
c. 
Return to the Control Panel and double-click the Sounds and Multimedia icon in Windows 2000, 
Sounds and Audio Devices icon in Windows XP, or the Sound icon in Windows Vista to open that 
dialog box.
d. 
Again, you’ll see tabs at the top left of the dialog box. Most of your applets will be similar to this. 
Explore each tab, and become familiar with what each does. Make changes to see the results. 
Be sure you remember or record the original settings so that you can reset them.
e. 
Reset all of your experimental changes, and close the applet.

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
82
Step 3 Keyboard and mouse action settings are deﬁnitely a matter of personal preference. Be careful 
to tell the user if you make any changes to these settings. If you need to speed them up for your own 
use while troubleshooting a PC, remember to slow them down again so the user isn’t frustrated by keys 
that repeat or a mouse cursor that races across the screen out of control.
To adjust the keyboard settings:
a. 
Double-click the Keyboard icon in the Control Panel.
b. 
Change the cursor’s blink rate and test it.
c. 
Change the key repeat rate and delay settings. A minor adjustment here can really help a 
heavy-ﬁngered user.
d. 
Close the Keyboard applet.
✔ Hint
The Mouse applet can have many different looks, depending on whether the system uses a 
default Windows driver or special drivers for the particular mouse. You may have to explore 
your applet to ﬁnd these settings.
e. 
Double-click the Mouse icon to open the Mouse applet.
f. 
Change from a right-hand to a left-hand mouse. Try it out. Does that make your brain hurt? 
Well then, change it back. (Ahhh, that’s better!)
g. 
Change the double-click speed. Slow it down a bit. Is that easier? Slow it down more. Do you 
ﬁnd that annoying? Now speed it up. Can you click fast enough?
h. 
Change the mini-icons that represent your mouse pointer, such as the arrow, hourglass, and so 
on. Try a couple of different sets. Can you think of situations where some of these alternative 
icon sets might be useful?
i. 
Change the pointer options. Change the speed at which the pointer travels across your screen. 
Everyone has his or her own sweet spot for this, so experiment to ﬁnd yours. Turn on pointer 
trails. Do you ﬁnd them cool, or annoying? If you have a Snap To option, turn that on. Now 
open a dialog box and watch the pointer jump to the active button. Is this convenient, or too 
much help? Turn off any features you don’t want to retain.
j. 
Now that you’ve tweaked your mouse performance, close the applet.

Lab Exercise 4.04: The Windows Control Panel
83
Step 4 The CompTIA A+ exams include questions about user accessibility. Know what settings you can 
change to accommodate the hearing and visually impaired, and where to ﬁnd those settings:
a. 
In Windows 2000 and XP, open the Accessibility Options applet (see Figure 4-19). In Vista, 
choose the Ease of Access Center applet and notice that you have all the previously mentioned 
items as well as many more! (See Figure 4-20.)
b. 
Select the Display tab in Windows 2000/XP, or click Make the computer easier to see in Windows 
Vista.
c. 
In Windows 2000/XP, check the Use High Contrast checkbox and click Settings (see Figure 4-21). 
In Windows Vista, check the box to enable the High Contrast key combination and then click 
Choose a High Contrast color scheme.
d. 
Choose a scheme you like and click OK.
e. 
Click Apply in the Accessibility Options dialog box to see how it looks. In Vista, you’ll have to 
press LEFT ALT-LEFT SHIFT-PRINT SCREEN to activate High Contrast mode.
f. 
Turn off the Use High Contrast option, then click Apply and OK.
g. 
Close the Accessibility Options/Ease of Access dialog box.
Figure 4-19 The Accessibility Options 
dialog box

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
84
Step 5 One more commonly used applet is Date and Time.
Open the Date and Time applet in the Control Panel. This applet has been around since the dawn of 
time, more or less, when computers didn’t automatically adjust themselves for Daylight Saving Time.
Adjust the date and time. Notice that you can do this either by scrolling with the arrows or by 
highlighting the ﬁelds. This feature can come in handy if you travel and want to change the time zone 
on a portable computer.

Lab Exercise 4.05: The Windows Microsoft 
Management Console (MMC) Toolbox
You’re about to learn how to customize your Windows toolkit! Almost every profession requires a set 
of tools to get the job done. Some of these tools are necessary, and some are luxuries. If you were a 
carpenter, you might have a toolbox in which you keep your hammer, saw, screwdrivers, pliers, and 
so on. You could then buy new tools (“I really needed this pneumatic nail gun, and it was on sale!” is 
a common excuse) and add them to your toolbox—but you’d need to keep it all organized, or risk not 
being able to ﬁnd the tool you need when you need it.
To help organize all of your PC technician’s tools, Microsoft created a handy toolbox: the Microsoft 
Management Console, or MMC. The MMC not only organizes all of those useful tools, but also provides a 
consistent look and feel between different systems and even different operating systems, which makes 
it easier to use them.
Figure 4-21 Setting the High Contrast 
option for the visually impaired

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
86
✔ Cross-Reference
For details on working with the MMC, refer to the “Microsoft Management Console” section in 
Chapter 4 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create an MMC. You’ll also create a desktop icon that you can use to 
access this customized software toolkit whenever you need it.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Create an MMC
• 
Add tools (snap-ins) to the MMC
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Vista
Getting Down to Business
The MMC is a shell program that holds individual utilities called snap-ins. The ﬁrst time you create 
an MMC, you get a default blank console. A blank MMC isn’t much to look at—like any new toolbox, it 
starts out empty.
Step 1 To create your MMC, select Start | Run, type mmc, and then click OK. Voilà! You’ve created a 
blank console (see Figure 4-22).
You’ll notice that the name in the upper-left corner is Console1. In Vista, you’ll also notice a panel 
called Actions, which contains a list of actions that are available to users as you add snap-ins and select 
them.
Before you actually conﬁgure an MMC, you need to understand a few points. First, you can have 
more than one MMC; successive consoles will be given default names such as Console2, Console3, and 
so on. Second, you can rename the consoles that you create. Third, you can choose where to save the 
consoles, so that you can easily ﬁnd them again. Finally, once you’ve created an MMC, you can modify it 
by adding or removing tools—just like your toolbox at home.
Follow these steps to practice working with MMCs:
a. 
Click File (Windows XP and Vista) or Console (Windows 2000) | Save As and ﬁll in the boxes as 
follows:
• 
Save in Desktop
• 
File name My First MMC
• 
Save as type Microsoft Management Console Files (*.msc)

Lab Exercise 4.05: The Windows Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Toolbox
87
b. 
Click Save to continue. (Don’t exit the MMC!)
c. 
Notice in the upper-left corner of the open window that the name has changed.
d. 
Find the new icon that’s been created on the desktop. This icon, which bears the same name 
as your new MMC, enables you to access the MMC in the future with just a double-click of the 
mouse.
Step 2 When you add snap-ins, they’ll show up in the Add/Remove Snap-in dialog box (see Figure 4-23).
You’ll now add some snap-ins to your MMC:
a. 
Click File | Add/Remove Snap-in (Windows XP/Vista) or Console | Add/Remove Snap-in 
(Windows 2000).
b. 
Click Add, and let the fun begin (see Figure 4-24). I bet you haven’t had this many selections 
since your last visit to Sears’ hardware department!
c. 
Add the Device Manager as your ﬁrst tool. Select Device Manager from the list and click Add.
Figure 4-22 Blank MMCs in XP and Vista

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
88
Figure 4-23 Adding or removing snap-ins
Figure 4-24 Adding a standalone snap-in

Lab Exercise 4.05: The Windows Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Toolbox
89
✔ Hint
When you add a snap-in, you have a choice of adding it for either your local computer or 
another computer. With the proper access permissions, in other words, you can look at the 
Device Manager on a networked system. More than likely, you don’t have the necessary 
permissions to do this, so stick with the local option for now.
d. 
Select Local Computer and click Finish.
✖ Warning
I can’t emphasize strongly enough that the best way to get a systems administrator mad is to go 
snooping around on the network. As a technician, your main concern is to do no harm. If you 
accidentally ﬁnd your way to an unauthorized area, it’s your duty to report it to an administrator.
While you’re here, you’ll add one more snap-in: the Event Viewer. You’ll use this tool in the labs for 
Chapter 17. Adding it here will provide an alternate way to access this tool:
a. 
Select Event Viewer from the list.
b. 
Select Local Computer and Finish to close out the wizard.
c. 
Click Add to close the list window, and click OK to close the Add/Remove window.
d. 
Your MMC should now show two snap-ins.
e. 
Be sure to save your MMC.
You now have a toolbox with quick access to Device Manager and Event Viewer. You can use these 
tools in the same way as if you navigated to them through the conventional methods.
Click Device Manager to expand the list of devices. Notice that it looks the same and works the same 
as it would if you opened it through the Control Panel.
Step 3 If everything has worked correctly up to now, continue with this step (if you had problems 
creating your MMC, review the instructions or ask your instructor for assistance):
a. 
Double-click the desktop icon for My First MMC.
b. 
Your Device Manager and Event Log are now available directly from your desktop (see Figure 4-25).

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
90
✔ Hint
I’ve only scratched the surface of creating an MMC here. Your customizing options are limited 
only by the number of snap-ins available and your imagination. Try creating different groupings 
of tools to organize similar tasks, maybe all the disk management tools together, or all the user, 
group, and resource tools. Be creative!

Lab Exercise 4.06: The Windows Registry
The Registry stores everything about your PC, including information on all the hardware in the PC, 
network information, user preferences, ﬁle types, and virtually anything else you might run into with 
Windows. The hardware, software, and program conﬁguration settings in the Registry are particular 
to each PC. Two identical PCs with the same operating system and hardware can still be remarkably 
different because of user settings and preferences. Almost any form of conﬁguration done to a Windows 
system results in changes to the Registry.
✖ Warning
When changing the Registry, proceed with great care—making changes in the Registry can 
cause unpredictable and possibly harmful results. To paraphrase the old carpenter’s adage: 
consider twice, change once!
Figure 4-25 Accessing Device 
Manager from a custom MMC

Lab Exercise 4.06: The Windows Registry
91
Learning Objectives
Most of the common tools to modify the Registry are contained in the Control Panel. When you use the 
Display applet to change a background, for example, the resultant changes are added to the Registry. 
The Control Panel applets are what you should normally use to conﬁgure the Registry. However, there 
are times—a virus attack, perhaps, or complete removal of a stubborn application—when direct 
manipulation of the Registry is needed. In this lab, you’ll familiarize yourself with the Windows 
Registry and the direct manipulation of the Registry using the REGEDIT command.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Access the Registry using REGEDIT
• 
Export, import, and modify Registry data subkeys and values
• 
Deﬁne the function of the ﬁve top-level Registry keys
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Vista
Getting Down to Business
A technician needs to know how to access the Registry and modify the conﬁguration based on solid 
support from Microsoft or other trusted sources. As mentioned in the Learning Objectives, your main 
interface to the Registry is the Control Panel. Changes made through the applets in the Control Panel 
result in modiﬁcations to the Registry settings. To see what’s going on behind the scenes, though, you’ll 
explore the Registry directly in this exercise using the REGEDIT command.
✔ Cross-Reference
For more detail on the Windows Registry and working with REGEDIT and REGEDT32, refer to the 
“Registry” section in Chapter 4 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Step 1 You almost never need to access the Registry directly. It’s meant to work in the background, 
quietly storing all the necessary data for the system, updated only through a few menus and 
installation programs. When you want to access the Registry directly, you must use the Registry Editor 
(REGEDIT or REGEDT32).

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
92
✔ Hint
This lab exercise was written using a system running Windows XP Professional and works in 
Vista. Windows XP and all later versions have combined the two versions of the Registry Editor—
REGEDIT and REGEDT32—into simply REGEDIT (although you can still use either command to 
open the editor. If you are working on a Windows 2000 Professional machine, you can explore 
the differences between REGEDIT and REGEDT32. Remember that no matter which version of 
Windows you are using, the Registry is a binary ﬁle, not a text ﬁle. You can’t edit it using EDIT, 
Notepad, or any other text editor.
To edit the Registry directly, follow these steps:
a. 
Select Start | Run, type regedit, and then click OK (see Figure 4-26) to start the Registry Editor.
b. 
Note the ﬁve main subgroups or root keys in the Registry (see Figure 4-27). Some of these root 
key folders may be expanded. Click the minus sign by any expanded folders. Do a quick mental 
review—do you know the function of each Registry key? You should!
Figure 4-26 Starting the Registry Editor
Figure 4-27 Viewing the ﬁve main subgroups of the Windows XP Registry

Lab Exercise 4.06: The Windows Registry
93
c. 
Now test your knowledge of the Registry. Referring to the textbook as necessary, match the 
listed keys with their deﬁnitions by writing the deﬁnition letter next to the corresponding key:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 
HKEY_USERS
 
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
 
 
A. 
 Contains the data for non-user-speciﬁc conﬁgurations, and includes every device in your 
PC and those you’ve removed
 
B. 
 Contains the personalization information for all users on a PC
 
C. 
 Contains additional hardware information when there are values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE 
such as two different monitors
 
D. 
 Deﬁnes the standard class objects used by Windows; information stored here is used to open 
the correct application when a ﬁle is opened
 
E. 
 Contains the current user settings, such as fonts, icons, and colors on systems that are set 
up to support multiple users
Step 2 One of the reasons you might want to edit the Registry directly would be to implement or 
expand a component of Windows that is not accessible through the Control Panel interface. A favorite 
of many techs is to enable the Rename function for the Recycle Bin. Expand the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT 
key by clicking the plus sign. Notice that there are more subkeys underneath it, some of which have 
subkeys of their own, and so on. Search down to the CLSID subkey and expand the key by clicking 
the plus sign. You will see hundreds of long identiﬁcation codes. Now use the Find utility (CTRL-F) and 
enter the following string into the text box: 645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E. Make sure 
you enter the numbers correctly. Expand the subkey and click the ShellFolder icon. You should see the 
information in Figure 4-28.
Before you start changing the Registry, it’s a good idea to learn how to “back up” the keys by 
exporting and importing them. This will enable you to reset the subkey to its original state if you make 
a mistake in your entries.
a. 
Highlight the ShellFolder subkey, and then select File | Export to open the Export Registry File 
dialog box. Save the key in a folder where you can ﬁnd it again, and give it a useful name that 
you won’t forget.
b. 
Highlight the key again, and double-click the Attributes REG_BINARY ﬁle. Replace the 
hexadecimal number 40 01 00 20 with 50 01 00 20 and click OK.
c. 
Double-click the “CallForAttributes” REG_DWORD ﬁle. Replace the 40 with 00 and click OK.
d. 
Minimize the Registry Editor and ﬁnd the Recycle Bin on your desktop.

Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
94
e. 
Right-click the Recycle Bin icon. In the drop-down menu there is now a Rename option (see 
Figure 4-29). Click Rename and change the name of the Recycle Bin. Fun, eh?
f. 
To return the Recycle Bin to its natural state, ﬁrst rename it back to Recycle Bin. Now navigate 
to your exported Registry ﬁle and double-click the ﬁle. You will be asked if you are sure you 
want to add this information to the Registry. Click Yes. You should see a message that the 
information was successfully added to the Registry.
g. 
To conﬁrm that your backup Registry information has taken effect, right-click the Recycle Bin. 
Can you still rename it? _________

Step 3 Imagine you’re in the Control Panel adjusting your mouse settings, and you adjust the mouse 
double-click speed to the maximum (fastest) and close the window without testing it. When you try to 
use the system, you can’t double-click the mouse fast enough even to get back into the Control Panel 
to ﬁx it. (This is a bit of a stretch, as you could always use the keyboard to access the Mouse applet, 
but go with me here to see the Registry in action.) So, what do you do? Follow these steps to view your 
current Mouse applet double-click speed setting and then use REGEDIT to change it:
a. 
Access the Control Panel and open the Mouse applet.
b. 
Adjust the slider for the double-click speed to the middle position, and test to be sure it works.
c. 
Click Apply and then OK. Close the Mouse applet and Control Panel.
d. 
Open the Registry Editor, and make sure that My Computer is highlighted at the top of the left 
pane.
e. 
Select Edit | Find to search for the mouse double-click speed. In the Find What ﬁeld, type 
doubleclickspeed (be sure to spell it as one word, no spaces). Check the Match Whole String 
Only box. Click Find Next. You want only the ﬁrst occurrence it ﬁnds. There are other things 
with that name that you don’t want to change.
f. 
When REGEDIT ﬁnds the ﬁle, right-click the word DoubleClickSpeed in the right pane and 
select Modify.
g. 
Change the value to something between 100 and 900 (milliseconds); 100 is very fast. Click OK 
and then close the Registry Editor.
h. 
Reopen the Mouse applet in the Control Panel. Did the slider move from where it was?  
______________________
i. 
For more practice, set your double-click speed to the fastest setting in the Control Panel and go 
to the Registry to slow it down.

Many PC users are comfortable performing simple installation and 
upgrade tasks, such as adding RAM or installing a modem or sound card. 
When it comes to the more complicated tasks, however, such as installing 
or replacing a central processing unit (CPU), wise users turn to the 
experts—this means you!
Installing a CPU is one of the many tasks you’ll ﬁnd yourself performing 
as a PC tech. Whether you’re building a new system from scratch or 
replacing the CPU on an existing computer, it’s your job to know the 
important characteristics of the CPU, match the CPU to compatible 
motherboards, and conﬁrm that the CPU in the PC is running properly.
In this set of lab exercises, you’ll identify current CPU types, form factors, 
sockets, and practice installing a CPU/fan assembly on a motherboard. 
You’ll then explore the speciﬁcations of the microprocessor with a freeware 
program known as CPU-Z.
It’s time to ﬁnd your anti-static wrist strap and get started with your 
exploration of CPUs!

Lab Exercise 5.01: Identifying CPU Characteristics
There you are, innocently strolling down the hall at work, following the smell of freshly brewed coffee, 
when you’re ambushed by Joe the accountant, brandishing a CPU/fan unit. He wants to replace the 
CPU in his machine with this new one he bought on eBay, and he wants you to help him. When you’re 
the resident computer tech geek, your coworkers will expect you to be able to deal competently with a 
situation like Joe’s.
Staying on top of the many developments in CPU technology can be challenging, but it’s also a 
necessary part of your job as a PC technician. By this point, you know that you can’t just plug any 
CPU into any motherboard and expect it to work—you have to match the right CPU to the right 
motherboard. To accomplish this, you need to identify important CPU characteristics such as form

factor, clock speed, and bus speed, as well as things like voltage settings, clock multiplier conﬁgurations, 
and cooling requirements.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll practice identifying CPUs and CPU fan components.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Recognize the different kinds of CPUs
• 
Recognize different CPU fan attachments
• 
Identify the basic speciﬁcations of different classes of CPUs
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A notepad and pencil to document the speciﬁcations
• 
Optional: Access to a working computer with a word processing or spreadsheet application 
installed and access to the Internet, to facilitate research and documentation of the CPU 
speciﬁcations
• 
The disassembled, non-production PC computer system used in the lab exercises in Chapter 3
Getting Down to Business
In the following steps, you’ll review your knowledge of CPU speciﬁcations, and then examine the CPU 
and fan attachment on a PC.
✔ Cross-Reference
Use Chapter 5 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs to help ﬁll in the 
speciﬁcations for each CPU in the following charts.
Step 1 A good tech will not only learn the speciﬁcations of different CPU chips but will also master 
the use of reference tools such as the Internet, manufacturers’ Web sites, product documentation, 
and reference books. A quick search of the Web or your motherboard book (a fancy name for your 
motherboard’s manual) will generally yield a full list of specs for a given CPU.

Step 4 On your disassembled PC, locate the CPU and fan assembly. Make note of the type of CPU 
package and fan assembly. Also note the type of power connector used for the fan: Molex, three-prong 
motherboard plug, or none. Then replace the CPU into the anti-static bag and return the fan assembly 
to your work surface.
✔ Hint
Many users will argue that Intel is better than AMD, or vice versa. The best way to solve this 
dispute is to look it up for yourself. In fact, I challenge you to do as much research as possible 
before recommending one over the other. The most signiﬁcant differentiation I’ve found is 
that AMD has better power management, whereas Intel is more power efﬁcient. Again, look 
for yourself, interview many people, and don’t forget to ask the client what they are primarily 
using the system for (that is, as a workstation, as a server, for gaming, and so forth).

Lab Exercise 5.02: Recognizing CPU Sockets
Because you know your CPUs, you have identiﬁed Joe’s purchase, but you explain to him that until you 
look at his motherboard, you can’t say whether he’ll be able to use it. CPU compatibility is determined 
largely by what the motherboard can support. Many motherboards enable you to upgrade the PC by 
replacing the existing CPU with a faster model of the same type. As a technician, your job is to make 
sure that the newer CPU has the same pin conﬁguration as the motherboard. If you do not know where 
to begin, perform an online search for the maker of the motherboard. Still, in many cases, you must 
replace the entire motherboard if you want to move up to a faster microprocessor.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll identify various CPU sockets.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Recognize different kinds of CPU sockets
• 
Know which CPUs require which sockets
Lab Materials and Setup

• 
A notepad and pencil to document the speciﬁcations
• 
Optional: Access to a working computer with a word processing or spreadsheet application 
installed and access to the Internet, to facilitate research and documentation of the CPU 
socket speciﬁcations
This lab is more effective if you have access to different types of motherboards with different types 
of CPU sockets.
Getting Down to Business
In the following steps, you’ll review your knowledge of CPU socket types.

Lab Exercise 5.03: Removing and Installing a CPU
Luckily for Joe, his motherboard is compatible with his new CPU. Now he expects you to play your 
“computer expert” role and install the new CPU in his PC. As a PC tech, you must be comfortable 
with such basic tasks. In this exercise, you’ll familiarize yourself with the procedure; using your 
disassembled PC, you’ll practice removing and reinstalling the CPU and fan assembly.

Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll practice removing and installing a CPU and CPU fan assembly.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Remove and install a CPU safely and correctly
• 
Remove and install a CPU fan assembly safely and correctly
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
The disassembled, non-production PC you used in the lab exercises in Chapter 3
• 
An anti-static mat, or other static-safe material on which to place the CPU following removal
• 
An anti-static wrist strap
• 
Thermal paste
• 
A small slotted (ﬂat-head) screwdriver
Getting Down to Business
Time to get your hands dirty! Removing and installing CPUs is one of the most nerve-wracking tasks 
that new PC techs undertake, but there’s no need to panic. You’ll be ﬁne as long as you take the proper 
precautions to prevent ESD damage, and handle the CPU and fan assembly with care.
✖ Warning
Be careful not to touch any of the exposed metal contacts on either the CPU or the CPU socket.
Step 1 Using the disassembled PC, determine whether the process of reinstalling and removing the 
CPU and fan assembly will be easier with the motherboard on an anti-static mat or installed in its case; 
if you prefer, reinstall the motherboard into the case before proceeding. You may ﬁnd that it is easier 
to work with the stubborn fan assembly clamp if the motherboard is secured in the case.
Step 2 In most cases you’ll have to remove the fan assembly before you can remove the CPU. Screw-
down fans are easier to remove than clip fans. Screw-down fans require only that you unscrew the 
securing hardware. Clip fans, found on many types of CPUs, require you to apply pressure on the clip 
to release it from the fan mount. Use a small slotted screwdriver to do this, as shown in Figure 5-4. Use 
caution when prying the clip open, and don’t forget to unplug the CPU fan!

Chapter 5: Microprocessors
106
✔ Hint
You’ll discover that releasing a fan clip takes way more force than you want to apply to anything so 
near a delicate CPU chip. Realizing this in advance, you can be sure to brace yourself and position 
the screwdriver carefully, to minimize the possibility of it slipping off and gouging something.
The CPU and fan assembly will have thermal paste residue on the surfaces that were previously 
touching. You cannot reuse thermal paste, so you’ll need to apply a fresh layer when you reinstall the 
CPU fan. Using a clean, lint-free cloth, carefully wipe the thermal paste residue from the CPU and fan 
assembly, and then place the fan assembly on an anti-static surface.
Step 3 Before proceeding, notice the CPU’s orientation notches. All CPUs have some form of 
orientation notch (or notches).
Now remove the CPU. Start by moving the end of the zero insertion force (ZIF) lever a little outward to 
clear the safety notch; then raise the lever to a vertical position. Next, grasp the chip carefully by its edges 
and lift it straight up and out of the socket. Be careful not to lift the CPU at an angle—if it’s a PGA CPU, 
you’ll bend its tiny pins. LGA CPUs don’t have pins, but you can damage the pins on the motherboard, so 
still be careful! As you lift out the CPU, make sure that the ZIF lever stays in an upright position.
Figure 5-4 Using a screwdriver to remove a clip-type CPU fan from 
its mount

Lab Exercise 5.03: Removing and Installing a CPU
107
Step 4 Now that you have the CPU chip out, examine it closely. The manufacturer usually prints the 
chip’s brand and type directly on the chip, providing you with some important facts about the chip’s 
design and performance capabilities. If your chip is an AMD Athlon X2 dual core, for example, you 
know that its PGA packaging ﬁts in a Socket AM2 (938 pins) and its bus speed is 200 MHz. Make a note 
of the relevant specs for your chip.
What is the CPU information printed on the chip package?
______________________________________________
✖ Warning
Always handle a CPU chip like a fragile old photograph: very gently, holding it only by the 
edges. Make sure you take complete ESD avoidance precautions, because even a tiny amount of 
static electricity can harm a CPU!
Step 5 Reinsert the CPU with the correct orientation, lock down the ZIF lever, and reattach the fan. 
Now remove the fan assembly and the CPU again. Practice this a few times to become comfortable with 
the process. When you’re ﬁnished practicing, reinsert the CPU for the last time. Be sure to apply a thin 
ﬁlm of fresh thermal paste onto the square in the center of the top of the CPU before you place the fan. 
Now reattach the fan assembly. Don’t forget to plug the fan back in!
✔ Hint
If this were a production system with RAM and other components installed, this would be an 
ideal time to turn the system back on and make sure you have the CPU seated properly. In real 
life, you should always test your hardware before you put the case back on!
The recommendation to use an older, non-production PC for the disassembly and reassembly 
exercises may present you with the task of working with some older technology. PGA-style 
packages, even the early designs, are fairly similar from processor to processor. If your CPU is 
an Intel Pentium II or III, or an early AMD Athlon, you may have to work with a Single Edge 
Contact (SEC) cartridge inserted in a Slot 1 or Slot A socket.
Removing an SEC CPU that uses a slot interface normally does not require removing the fan, 
which is usually attached to the chip cartridge itself. To remove a slot CPU, ﬁrst check for and 
release any retaining clips that may be securing it to the slot, and then grasp the cartridge 
ﬁrmly on both ends and pull straight up from the motherboard.

Chapter 5: Microprocessors
108
Step 6 You may leave your CPU/fan assembly installed on the motherboard and place the 
motherboard on your anti-static mat. Optionally, if you reinstalled the motherboard in the case, you 
may leave it assembled.

Lab Exercise 5.04: Cooling Your CPU
Now that Joe has his processor, he needs to keep it cool, and since you’ve done everything else for him 
so far, you might as well make sure it’s properly cooled, too! Someone new to the CPU cooling business 
might be tempted to think that CPUs come from the factory with a deﬁned operating temperature. 
This isn’t the case. The operating temperature depends tremendously on the way you cool the CPU. A 
far more reliable measurement is power consumption, the amount of power a CPU generates. CPU power 
consumption is measured in watts (W), with most desktop CPUs consuming in excess of 100 W. If 
you’ve ever tried to touch a 100-W light bulb, you can appreciate that this level of power consumption 
generates a tremendous amount of heat. If this heat isn’t taken away from the CPU by some form of 
cooling, the CPU will begin to overheat. If a CPU gets too hot, it will automatically shut itself down to 
prevent permanent damage. You need to provide Joe’s CPU with some form of cooling device.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll identify the strengths and weaknesses of three CPU cooling options: OEM fans, third-
party fans, and liquid cooling.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Determine the cooling needs of your CPU
• 
Decide on the form of cooling to use for your needs
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Access to a working computer with Internet access
• 
A notepad and pencil to document the speciﬁcations
Getting Down to Business
The three most common types of CPU cooling are original equipment manufacturer (OEM) fans, third-
party fans, and liquid cooling. Each of the following steps gives you an opportunity to investigate each 
of these options for a particular CPU.

Lab Exercise 5.04: Cooling Your CPU
109
Step 1 For the purposes of this exercise, pick out any single modern CPU as a sample CPU—you’ll use 
this to ﬁnd the proper cooling devices. Any CPU will work, but you’ll ﬁnd more options if you choose 
one that’s readily available on popular online stores. If you’re not sure what online store to use, try 
www.newegg.com.
Individual CPUs are most commonly sold in what’s known as a “retail box.” This includes both the 
CPU and an OEM fan.
Step 2 Look online for third-party fan solutions for the CPU you’ve chosen. Look for the following 
popular brand names and see what third-party fans each of these manufacturers offer for your CPU:
Antec, Arctic Cooling, Cooler Master, Thermaltake, Zalman
Document the name, model number and price for each one and list some of the beneﬁts it offers:

Lab Exercise 5.05: Exploring CPU  
Speciﬁcations with CPU-Z
Joe is very impressed with your knowledge and expertise—and he’s relieved that the CPU he purchased 
on eBay happened to work out. You explain that not only did it work out, but he has really improved 
the performance of his system with the upgraded CPU. In fact, to further display the characteristics of 
the CPU Joe has just purchased, you download and run a utility known as CPU-Z from www.cpuid.com. 
This utility reads the speciﬁcations of different PC components from information embedded in those 
components.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll identify various CPU speciﬁcations.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Run the CPU-Z utility

The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Access to a working computer with Internet access, to facilitate downloading and running the 
CPU-Z utility
• 
A notepad and pencil to document the speciﬁcations
• 
Optional: A word processor or spreadsheet application to facilitate the documentation

In the following steps, you’ll download a reference utility known as CPU-Z and use it to further explore 
the characteristics of the CPU.
Step 1 Log on to a computer with Internet access and point your browser to the following Web site: 
www.cpuid.com. Follow the directions to download the current version of CPU-Z (the current version at 
this writing is 1.52). Unzip the ﬁle and launch CPU-Z.
Step 2 The CPU-Z utility displays a number of tabs across the top of the window (see Figure 5-5). At 
this time you are only concerned with the CPU and Cache tabs.

Chapter 6: RAM

One of the easiest and most cost-effective upgrades you can make to a 
PC is to add more memory. As such, RAM installation is probably the most 
common type of upgrade you’ll perform as a PC tech.
RAM installation tasks include determining how much RAM the PC 
has installed, how much RAM the PC can support, and what type of RAM 
it uses, and then physically installing the RAM on the motherboard. 
The following labs are designed to give you practice working with RAM 
by using visual recognition of the different types and packages and by 
walking you through the steps of installing RAM.
S 15 minutes
Lab Exercise 6.01: Determining  
the Amount of RAM in Your PC
There you are, a week after upgrading Joe’s CPU, using your lunch hour to pummel your fellow PC techs 
in Team Fortress 2 (playing the good old Well map), when who should show up again but Joe, this time 
clutching a stick of RAM he got from a guy on the fourth ﬂoor. He wants you to install it in his system. 
You tell him you have to check on some things ﬁrst, including how much RAM his system can handle 
and how much it already has, before you can help him.
✔ Hint
High-end PCs usually come straight from the factory equipped with hefty amounts of RAM. One 
of the ways in which makers of lower-cost PCs cut corners is by skimping on RAM.
Your ﬁrst task in performing a RAM upgrade is determining how much RAM you need. Start by 
ﬁnding out how much RAM is currently installed in the system, and then consult the motherboard book 
to determine how much RAM the system supports.
Learning Objectives
In this lab exercise, you’ll use various methods to determine how much memory is currently installed 
in your system, and how much it is capable of holding.

Lab Exercise 6.01: Determining the Amount of RAM in Your PC

At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Find RAM measurements
• 
Identify how much RAM is installed in a system
• 
Determine how much RAM a particular motherboard supports
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working Windows PC
• 
A notepad
✔ Hint
If you’re in a computer lab or you have access to multiple PCs, you should practice on as many 
different PCs as possible.
Getting Down to Business
There are several ways to determine how much RAM is installed on a PC. First, you can check the RAM 
count during the boot process (some of the newer machines hide the RAM count, even if it’s enabled 
in the BIOS). This tells you how much RAM the system BIOS recognizes during its check of the system. 
Second, you can check the amount of RAM that Windows recognizes from within the OS. And third, you 
can remove the PC case cover and physically examine the RAM sticks installed on the motherboard.
When you physically install RAM into slots on the motherboard, those slots are arranged into 
groups called banks. Depending on your computer’s design, a bank might include one, two, or three slots. 
When you install new memory, you must ﬁll every slot in a bank to take advantage of whatever RAM 
technology is using the banks. For example, if your computer uses triple-channel RAM with three-slot 
banks, you must install your RAM as a set of three or your RAM will not run at its ultimate speed. There 
are some big differences in RAM slots for each type of motherboard: be sure to read your motherboard 
book to determine how to install RAM in banks. Additionally, markings on the motherboard—either 
text labels or outlines—will identify the banks, if present.
Also keep in mind that motherboards support multiple types and speeds of RAM. In some situations, 
you might need to use the same type and speed of memory in every memory slot in your computer, even 
across different banks. Again, the motherboard book is your best friend here.
You’ll ﬁnd that computers leave any empty slots vacant. In older computers that used RDRAM, 
however, empty slots were ﬁlled with a continuity RIMM (CRIMM) module, a small circuit board 
designed to complete the electrical circuit but not add RAM to your system. (RDRAM is still covered on 
the CompTIA A+ exams, so even though it’s not used in mainstream PCs anymore, you need to know 
about it.)

Chapter 6: RAM
116
✔ Cross-Reference
To review the ways you can check the amount of RAM installed in a PC, refer to the 
“Determining Current RAM Capacity” section in Chapter 6 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to 
Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Step 1 Turn on your PC, and watch the display as the system goes through its startup routine, 
otherwise known as a power-on self test (POST). Typically, the RAM count runs near the top-left side of 
the screen. Figure 6-1 shows an example of a typical RAM count.
Most BIOS programs display the RAM count in kilobytes (KB). To convert this ﬁgure to megabytes 
(MB), divide it by 1024.
Many systems run through the startup routine quickly, so the RAM count might appear on the 
screen for only a few seconds. Press the PAUSE/BREAK key to pause the boot process so you have time to 
write down the number accurately. When you want the boot process to resume, press the ENTER key.
What is the RAM count number displayed on your monitor? ____________________
✔ Hint
If you’re starting the PC for the ﬁrst time that day, the startup routine may run through the 
RAM count before the monitor has a chance to warm up. If this happens, just reboot the PC and 
try again.
Figure 6-1  Viewing a typical RAM count during boot-up

Lab Exercise 6.01: Determining the Amount of RAM in Your PC
117
Depending on your system’s BIOS, you may also see a RAM count in the system conﬁguration 
summary. This is a screen that lists the PC’s CPU type and clock speed, mass storage devices, port 
addresses, and so on. Typically, you’ll also see an entry for the system’s base memory (640 KB) and 
extended memory (the total amount of RAM installed).
Step 2 Use the following methods to determine the amount of RAM on your system from within any 
version of Windows.
a. 
In Windows 2000/XP, right-click the My Computer icon and select Properties to see the amount 
of RAM in your system. In Windows Vista , open the Start menu, highlight Computer, right-
click, and select Properties. The RAM count is under the System area (see Figure 6-2). You can 
also see other useful information here, like the processor type, Windows edition, the product 
ID, and more.
b. 
You’ll notice that Windows 2000 shows the amount of RAM in kilobytes, while Windows XP 
and Vista show it in gigabytes.
Figure 6-2  Viewing the RAM count in Windows Vista via Computer

Chapter 6: RAM
118
Another way to see the amount of memory installed is to follow this procedure:
a. 
Click Start | Programs (or All Programs) | Accessories | System Tools | System Information. In 
the System Summary, look for a value called Total Physical Memory (see Figure 6-3).
b. 
The amount of RAM will be listed in the displayed information.
How much memory is in your system? ____________________
Does this number agree with what you found in Step 1? ________________________
Does the amount of RAM shown during the startup routine and that reported by Windows 
match?
Entry-level PCs and laptops often have onboard display adapters (the display adapter is built 
into the motherboard). Manufacturers include little to no video RAM on the motherboard, so the 
display adapter must “steal” some portion of the system RAM to be able to handle today’s intense 
graphic applications.
If the amounts do not add up, and you see a number such as 448 MB or 992 MB, then your system 
has probably allocated some of the system memory to handle your display adapter’s needs.
Figure 6-3  The System Information dialog box showing Total Physical Memory

Lab Exercise 6.02: Identifying Types of RAM
119
We’ll save the last method for determining how much RAM is installed for the next exercise in this 
lab. For the moment, let’s talk about how to determine the maximum amount of RAM your system is 
capable of supporting.
Step 3 The amount of RAM you can install on a modern system depends on the limitations of the 
motherboard hardware. All new CPUs are capable of 64-bit processing, so new chipsets support very 
large amounts of RAM. The question is, how much RAM does your motherboard support?
Neither the CMOS setup utility nor the OS can help you determine how much RAM a PC is capable of 
handling. The best source for this information is the system’s motherboard book, if you have it, or the 
PC maker’s or motherboard manufacturer’s Web site.
Examine the documentation that came with your PC, or visit the manufacturer’s Web site, to 
determine how much RAM you can install on the system.
What is the maximum amount of RAM that your system can support? ____________________
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 6.02: Identifying Types of RAM
Once you determine how much RAM is installed on Joe’s PC, and how much his motherboard can 
handle, you conclude that there’s room for more. But, you explain to Joe, this doesn’t mean you can add 
his RAM stick, because not all RAM is the same. Having looked at the specs for his system, you know it 
takes 240-pin DDR2 SDRAM. Joe thinks the stick he got is the right size to ﬁt, but you know it’s 240-pin 
DDR3 RAM, so it won’t. This is why they pay you the big bucks—and why you get to take the RAM stick 
Joe can’t use and add it to your own machine! (Just kidding. Of course you’d give it back to Joe.)
RAM comes in several standardized form factors, each compatible with speciﬁc types of systems. 
Modern desktop systems use full-sized dual inline memory modules (DIMMs) of various pin 
conﬁgurations (168, 184, and 240). Laptop computers use scaled-down DIMM versions called small 
outline-DIMMs, or SO-DIMMs.
✔ Cross-Reference
For details on the various types of RAM found in modern systems, refer to the “DDR SDRAM,” 
“Dual-Channel DDR,” and “DDR2/3” sections in Chapter 6 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to 
Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
The steps for identifying the different types of RAM are presented in this lab exercise.

Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll examine and compare different RAM packages.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Recognize and differentiate between different kinds of RAM packages
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
The disassembled, non-production PC used in the lab exercises in Chapter 5
• 
Demonstration units of various RAM packages (optional)
✔ Hint
It is helpful to examine the RAM conﬁgurations in multiple PCs, if you have them available. 
Having a laptop with removable RAM is a plus.
Getting Down to Business
Let’s do a quick review of the types of RAM packages you’ll see on modern PCs. Then you’ll check your 
PC or motherboard documentation to determine the type of RAM it uses.
All modern PCs use some form of DDR memory for their system RAM. As was discussed in the 
textbook, DDR stands for double data rate, which means that for every tick of the clock, two chunks of 
data are sent across the memory bus. This has the effect of giving you twice the performance without 
increasing the clock rate. A quick way to calculate that performance is to use this easy formula:
Transfer rate = (clock rate × transfer per cycle) × bus width / 8
Using this formula for a stick of 400-MHz DDR, for example, looks like this: 
Transfer rate = (400 MHz × 2) × 64 bits / 8
When you run the numbers, you get a transfer rate of 6400 MB, or 6.25 GB.
Since the introduction of DDR, two major RAM upgrades have occurred, DDR2 and DDR3, each of 
which has double the throughput of its predecessor.
Another performance trick modern systems use to increase memory speed is dual- and triple-channel 
architectures. This enables the memory controller to access more than one stick of RAM at a time, thus 
increasing performance. In effect, the 64-bit bus acts like a 128-bit bus (for dual-channel) or a 192-bit 
bus (for triple-channel). To use these multichannel architectures, you must install memory in identical 
pairs or triplets. Check your motherboard book to see if your system supports dual- or triple-channel 
memory.

Lab Exercise 6.02: Identifying Types of RAM
121
Step 1 Typically, as older machines become obsolete and fall into disuse, they are easier to acquire for 
little or no cost. Many times, this is exactly the type of PC you have available to disassemble, so there is 
a good chance that it will use older memory (RAM) as well. If you are using an older, non-production 
machine for your exploration, there’s a good chance the motherboard supports one of these older types 
of RAM packages (included here for your information):
• 
168-pin DIMMs These are about ﬁve inches long and have 84 physical pins (edge connectors) 
on each side, and all 168 connectors are used. The board has two notches on the bottom: one 
near the center, and the other near an end (see Figure 6-4).
• 
184-pin RIMMs Rambus Dynamic RAM (RDRAM) is the type of RAM you might ﬁnd if you 
are working with an old Intel Pentium III or Pentium 4 motherboard. A stick of RDRAM is 
called a RIMM. RIMM is actually trademarked as a word; it’s not an acronym like DIMM, 
despite what many people assume (see Figure 6-5).
If you are using a typical desktop system and it is relatively new (less than two years old), the 
motherboard will most likely support one of the following three types of RAM packages:
• 
184-pin DDR DIMMs DDR RAM sticks are about ﬁve inches long and look a lot like 168-pin 
DIMMs, but with only one notch and more connectors. These are known as double data rate 
(DDR) memory. The notches are different from 168-pin DIMMs, so these RAM types are not 
interchangeable (see Figure 6-6).
• 
240-pin DDR2 DIMMs DDR2 RAM sticks are physically the same size as the 184-pin DDR 
DIMMs, but the guide notch is in a different location and there are obviously more connectors. 
DDR2 uses a 240-pin DIMM (see Figure 6-7) that’s not compatible with DDR RAM slots. DDR2 is 
expected to perform better than DDR due to lower voltage requirements, clock doubling on the 
chips’ input/output circuits, and special prefetch buffers.
Figure 6-4  A 168-pin DIMM
Figure 6-5  A 184-pin RIMM

Chapter 6: RAM
122
• 
240-pin DDR3 DIMMs DDR3 RAM sticks are physically the same size as the 184-pin DDR 
DIMMs, but the guide notch is in a different location. DDR3 uses a 240-pin DIMM (see Figure 
6-8) that’s not compatible with DDR RAM slots or motherboards. DDR3 is triple-channel 
architecture and performs faster at higher frequencies but at lower voltages, thus generating 
less heat. The laptop version of DDR3 is called a 204-pin SO-DIMM.
➜ Note
DDR3 DIMMs are not backward compatible—inserting a DDR3 module into a DDR2 socket can 
damage the DIMM and/or the motherboard.
Step 2 In your PC or motherboard documentation, or on the manufacturer’s Web site, locate the 
section listing the type of RAM your system uses.

the disassembled, non-production system. This time, you will be removing and installing RAM sticks.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll practice removing and installing RAM.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Remove RAM safely and correctly
• 
Install RAM safely and correctly
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
The disassembled, non-production PC used in the lab exercises in Chapter 3
• 
An anti-static mat or other static-safe material on which to place the RAM
• 
An anti-static wrist strap

✔ Hint
If you’re in a computer lab or you have access to multiple PCs, you should practice on a variety 
of systems.
Getting Down to Business
Removal and installation procedures vary depending on the type of RAM your system uses. DIMMs and 
RIMMs snap into the RAM slots vertically. The following steps describe the removal and installation 
procedures for DIMMs.
✖ Warning
Regardless of the type of RAM on your system, be certain to take measures to prevent ESD 
damage. Shut down and unplug your PC and place it on your anti-static mat. Strap on your anti-
static bracelet and ground yourself. If necessary, remove any cables or components that block 
access to your system RAM before you begin.
✔ Hint
You should have already removed the RAM from your tear-down machine and safely stored it 
in an anti-static bag. You may either install the RAM in the sockets on the motherboard with 
the motherboard on the anti-static mat, or reinstall the motherboard into the case ﬁrst. The 
following removal steps are listed for reference, especially if you have access to additional 
machines for exploration.
Follow these steps to remove DIMM or RIMM RAM from your PC:
Step 1 Locate the retention clips on either end of the RAM module.
Step 2 Press outward on the clips to disengage them from the retention slots on the sides of the RAM 
sticks (see Figure 6-9).
Step 3 Press down on the clips ﬁrmly and evenly. The retention clips act as levers to lift the DIMM 
sticks up and slightly out of the RAM slots.

Lab Exercise 6.03: Removing and Installing RAM
125
Step 4 Remove the DIMM sticks and place them on your anti-static mat, or in an anti-static bag.
Step 5 Make note of the following:
How many pins does your RAM have? ___________________________
Where are the guide notches located? ___________________________
What information is on the RAM’s label? ________________________
Step 6 While you have your system RAM out, this is a good time to check the condition of the metal 
contacts on both the RAM sticks and the motherboard RAM sockets. Dirty contacts are fairly rare. If 
you see this problem, use contact cleaner, available at any electronics store.
Are the contacts free of dirt and corrosion? ________________________
After you’ve examined your system RAM and inspected the motherboard RAM sockets, reinstall the 
RAM as described next.
To install a DIMM or RIMM:
Step 1 Orient the DIMM or RIMM so that the guide notches on the RAM module match up to the 
guide ridges on the RAM socket.
Step 2 Press the RAM stick ﬁrmly and evenly straight down into the socket until the retention clips 
engage the retention notches on the ends of the RAM stick.
Step 3 Snap the retention clips ﬁrmly into place.
Step 4 Repeat these steps to install other RAM modules as appropriate. If you’re using RIMM RAM, 
don’t forget to install the continuity RIMM (CRIMM) sticks into any empty RAM slots.

Chapter 6: RAM
126
To ﬁnish a RAM installation professionally, speciﬁcally if you are on a production-level machine, 
follow these steps:
Step 1 Once your system RAM is in place, reattach any cables that you may have had to move, and 
plug in the system power cable. Do not reinstall the PC case cover until after you’ve conﬁrmed that 
RAM installation was successful.
Step 2 Boot up the system and watch the RAM count to conﬁrm that you correctly installed the RAM.
✔ Hint
If your system has any problems when you reboot, remember that you must turn off the power 
and unplug the computer again before reseating the RAM.

Chapter 7: BIOS and CMOS
132
Basic input/output services (BIOS) provide the primary interface 
between the operating system’s device drivers and most of its hardware. 
Although a modern BIOS is automated and tolerant of misconﬁguration, 
a good PC technician must be comfortable with those occasional situations 
in which the BIOS may need some maintenance or repair. 
Be aware that some viruses are written to erase the BIOS content 
from the PC, which makes the PC inoperative; that is, it will not be able 
to boot again. Some even attack the operating system and forbid it from 
reprogramming the BIOS so that it can operate again. The good news is 
that great utility programs are available to help you troubleshoot these 
issues if they arise. One program I’ve found to be trustworthy and great 
all around is PCDoctor Utilities, located at www.pcdoctor-tools.com. It’s 
inexpensive and works well for dealing with systems corrupted by a 
virus. Lots of freeware programs are offered on the Web, but it’s best to 
talk to a trusted IT professional to learn which ones work best before you 
download anything.
The PC needs the BIOS to tell it how each basic component is supposed 
to communicate with the system. At the beginning of the PC revolution, 
many different manufacturers developed BIOS for PCs, but over the years 
the BIOS business has consolidated to only two brands: AMI (American 
Megatrends, Inc.), and Phoenix Technologies (which absorbed the former 
third brand, Award Software). Both of these manufacturers provide a 
utility called the CMOS setup program (CMOS stands for complementary 
metal-oxide semiconductor, which is why everyone says “CMOS”) that enables 
you to reconﬁgure BIOS settings for boot device order, amount of memory, 
hard disk drive conﬁguration, and so on. Most of these conﬁgurations 
are automated, but as a PC tech, you’ll ﬁnd yourself reconﬁguring BIOS 
settings more often than you might think!

Lab Exercise 7.01: Identifying BIOS ROM
133
As an example for the lab exercises in this chapter, suppose that 
the company you’re working for is planning a mass upgrade from its 
current OS, Windows XP Professional, to Windows Vista. You’ve tested 
the upgrade process on a few lab machines and have found that systems 
with an out-of-date BIOS are having problems upgrading successfully. 
In preparation for the Windows Vista installation, besides upgrading 
any older BIOS versions you ﬁnd, you’ll disable any BIOS-level antivirus 
checking functions. You’re also aware that the prior IT manager did not 
use consistent CMOS passwords, so you may need to reset the passwords 
on a few machines.
The lab exercises in this chapter will teach you to identify, access, and 
conﬁgure system BIOS.
S 10 minutes
Lab Exercise 7.01: Identifying BIOS ROM
Having received your orders to do the big OS upgrade, your ﬁrst task is to check the BIOS types and 
versions on every machines in your ofﬁce, and then visit each BIOS maker’s Web site to determine 
whether more recent versions are available.
The system BIOS is stored on nonvolatile memory called BIOS ROM. BIOS makers often (but not 
always) label their BIOS ROM chips prominently on the motherboard. In this exercise, you’ll look at two 
different ways to identify your BIOS ROM chip.
✔ Cross-Reference
For details on the two big companies that manufacture BIOS on modern systems, refer to the 
“Updating CMOS: The Setup Program” section in Chapter 7 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to 
Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll learn two ways to identify your BIOS.

Chapter 7: BIOS and CMOS
134
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Locate the BIOS ROM chip on the motherboard
• 
Identify the BIOS manufacturer
• 
Determine the BIOS creation date and version
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC
• 
An anti-static mat
• 
A notepad
Getting Down to Business
The ﬁrst thing you’ll do is remove your PC case cover and locate the BIOS ROM chip. Next, you’ll make 
note of the BIOS information displayed during system startup.
✖ Warning
Any time you take the cover off your PC, remember to follow all proper safety and ESD 
avoidance precautions.
Step 1 Remove the case from the PC and locate the system BIOS ROM chip. Some motherboards label 
their chip with the name of the BIOS manufacturer. Compare your system BIOS ROM chip to the one in 
Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1 A typical system BIOS ROM chip

Lab Exercise 7.01: Identifying BIOS ROM
135
Read the manufacturer’s label if you can, and answer the following questions:
Who made the BIOS? ______________________________________________________________
What year was the BIOS written? ____________________________________________________
Are there any other numbers on the label? Record them. __________________________________
 Does it look like you could easily remove the system BIOS chip, or does it look soldered to the 
motherboard? ____________________________________________________________________
Step 2 Replace the PC case cover and start the system. Be sure the monitor is turned on. When the 
ﬁrst data appears on the screen, press the PAUSE/BREAK key on the keyboard. This suspends further 
operation until you press ENTER. Newer systems actually have instructions somewhere on the screen that 
indicate which key or keys to press to get into boot options, CMOS setup, and so forth.
Figure 7-2 shows an example of what you may see. At the top of the screen is the BIOS manufacturer’s 
name and version number. At the bottom of the screen is the date of manufacture and the product 
identiﬁcation number.
Make note of the following information:
Who made the BIOS? __________________________________
What version is the BIOS? ______________________________
What year was the BIOS written? ________________________
✔ Hint
Not all BIOS display the same type of information. Some BIOS makers modify the BIOS to show 
nothing more than their logos during the boot process.
Figure 7-2 A typical boot screen

Chapter 7: BIOS and CMOS
136
Step 3 Press ENTER on the keyboard to continue booting. Once the system is up and running, go online 
and ﬁnd out whether a more recent version of your BIOS is available. Your ﬁrst stop should be your PC 
maker’s Web site. If it does not have this information available, try your motherboard manufacturer or 
the BIOS maker.
✖ Warning
Do not “ﬂash” your system BIOS at this time!
S 15 minutes
Lab Exercise 7.02: Accessing BIOS  
via the CMOS Setup Program
Once you’ve assessed the BIOS on each machine, but before you proceed with the Windows Vista installation, 
you should check to be sure the BIOS is properly conﬁgured using the special program for this purpose.
You don’t access the hundreds of individual programs contained in the system BIOS directly, or from 
anywhere within the Windows OS. Instead, you use a utility that interfaces with the BIOS programs to 
enable you to reconﬁgure settings. This utility is the CMOS setup program.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll go into CMOS and explore your BIOS conﬁguration settings.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Enter the CMOS setup program
• 
Navigate the display screens of the setup utility
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC whose BIOS settings you have permission to change
Getting Down to Business
In the following steps, you’ll reboot your PC and access the boot options or CMOS setup program. Each 
BIOS maker has its own special way to do this, so how you go about it depends on which BIOS your 
system has installed. Common methods include the following:
• 
Press DELETE during the boot process.
• 
Press F2, F10, or F12 during the boot process.

Lab Exercise 7.02: Accessing BIOS via the CMOS Setup Program
137
• 
Press CTRL-ALT-INSERT during the boot process.
• 
Press CTRL-A during the boot process.
• 
Press CTRL-F1 during the boot process.
There are four ways for you to determine which method works for your BIOS:
• 
Check your motherboard or PC documentation.
• 
Visit your motherboard or PC maker’s Web site.
• 
Watch the screen display after booting your PC. Most BIOS direct you to press a speciﬁc key to 
enter CMOS.
• 
Use the trial-and-error method! Boot your system and go down the preceding list, trying each 
key or key combination until one works. You won’t hurt anything if you get it wrong, but 
if you hold the wrong key down for too long you may get a keyboard error message. If this 
happens, just reboot and try again.
Step 1 Determine which method you need to use to enter the CMOS setup program. Then reboot your 
system and use that method to enter CMOS.
Step 2 Once you’ve entered the CMOS setup program, look at the screen and compare it to Figures 7-3 
and 7-4. The Phoenix BIOS shown in Figure 7-3 opens immediately into the Main screen, whereas the 
Phoenix-Award BIOS in Figure 7-4 presents an initial menu. Although the screens for different CMOS 
setup programs may look different, they all contain basically the same functions.
Figure 7-3 Phoenix CMOS Main screen

Chapter 7: BIOS and CMOS
138
✖ Warning
Do not make any changes in BIOS settings during this lab exercise. You’ll make changes in the 
next two lab exercises.
The CMOS setup program controls the “changeable” BIOS settings. Many settings depend on what 
hardware you add to the system. The following are some sample entries on your system that you can 
change or update (there are more, the speciﬁcs of which depend on your BIOS):
• 
Date
• 
Time
• 
Hard drive conﬁguration
• 
Boot sequence
• 
RAM
• 
Serial and parallel port assignments
• 
Enable/disable onboard controllers
• 
Enable/disable supervisor and user passwords
Step 3 Explore each screen and make notes about what each setting does. Navigation, like the 
method to enter the CMOS setup program, varies from maker to maker. Most programs are navigable 
by keyboard only, but some (AMI, for instance) support a mouse. Look at the bottom of the CMOS setup 
program screen to see how to navigate in your particular CMOS utility.
Figure 7-4 Phoenix-Award BIOS opening screen

Lab Exercise 7.02: Accessing BIOS via the CMOS Setup Program
139
✔ Hint
Usually the arrow keys and the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys will select and change settings. 
Sometimes the + and − keys or the SPACEBAR will toggle settings. The CMOS setup program screen 
usually provides a key to the navigation and selection keys; refer to it as well.
While navigating through the different setup screens, pay particular attention to any password or 
security menu that enables you to conﬁgure administrator/supervisor passwords and user passwords. Do 
not make any changes at this time; just make a note of where you conﬁgure these passwords. You will 
conﬁgure a password in the next lab exercise.
Step 4 Below is a list of common settings found in the CMOS. Know that each BIOS arranges its 
settings differently. View every screen of your CMOS setup utility to locate and record these settings 
and their location:
 Drives Depending on your motherboard conﬁguration, you will either set a primary master/slave 
drive or, if using SATA, get a list of the different drives attached and their name/type.
Onboard Devices These settings allow you to conﬁgure onboard devices such as your USB ports.
 Performance Only common on better motherboards, this area allows you to tweak system timings 
for improved performance (also known as overclocking).
Security This section allows you to set administrator or system passwords.
Boot Sequence This setting lets you deﬁne the order your system looks for boot devices.
Power Management This section deﬁnes when devices shut down and how they awaken.
Once you’re done exploring, press ESC a couple of times until you get the message “Quit Without 
Saving (Y/N)?” Press Y, and then press ENTER. The system will boot into your operating system.

Lab Exercise 7.03: Conﬁguring and Clearing  
CMOS Setup Program Passwords
In many professional environments, the IT department doesn’t want users to fool with any of the PC’s 
settings, especially detailed items such as the BIOS settings. The IT manager may even devise a password 
to prevent entry to the CMOS setup utility by unauthorized users. Unfortunately, in your organization, 
the IT manager has resigned and was not very thorough about documenting these passwords.
When a CMOS setup utility has been password protected and its password has been subsequently 
lost, the typical way to clear the password is to shunt a jumper on the motherboard that clears either 
the password or the entire contents of CMOS.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll learn how to conﬁgure CMOS setup utility passwords and how to clear the contents of 
the password and CMOS using the onboard CMOS-clear jumper.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Set a password using the CMOS setup utility
• 
Locate the CMOS-clear jumper on the motherboard
• 
Clear passwords and CMOS settings using the CMOS-clear jumper
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC whose BIOS settings you can change, with access to the clear CMOS jumper on 
the motherboard
• 
An anti-static mat/wrist strap
• 
A notepad
Getting Down to Business
In the following steps, you’ll reboot your PC and access the CMOS setup program using the key combination 
you veriﬁed in Lab Exercise 7.02. You will then navigate to the password or security menu and conﬁgure a 
CMOS setup utility password. Then you’ll verify the password by rebooting the machine and entering CMOS 
setup. Finally, you’ll open the case and reset the CMOS settings by physically shunting the CMOS-clear jumper.
✖ Warning
Any time you remove the cover from your PC, remember to follow all proper safety and ESD 
avoidance precautions.

Lab Exercise 7.03: Conﬁ guring and Clearing CMOS Setup Program Passwords
141
Step 1 Reboot your system and use the appropriate key or key combination to enter the CMOS setup 
program.
Step 2 Once you’ve entered the CMOS setup program, navigate to the security or password menu (see 
Figure 7-5). Select the supervisor password and enter a four- to eight-character password. Save changes 
and exit CMOS setup.
Record your password here: ________________________
✔ Hint
Typically, two types of passwords can be set in CMOS, but a third is now appearing:
The supervisor password restricts access to the CMOS setup program so that only authorized 
personnel can change or modify BIOS settings. Organizations, especially schools, usually 
conﬁgure a supervisor password to keep curious users from causing system errors.
The user or system password restricts access to the PC itself, and is required every time the system 
boots (before an operating system is even loaded). This type of password is often used when an 
individual’s PC is located in a public area.
The hard drive password is the third and newest password you’ll ﬁnd on some CMOS setups. Hard 
drive passwords prevent a user from accessing a hard drive unless they know the password.
Step 3 Reboot the PC and press the key or key combination required to enter the CMOS setup program. 
If you completed Step 2 correctly, you should be prompted to enter a password. Enter the password you 
conﬁgured in Step 2 and press ENTER. The main menu of the CMOS setup program will appear.
Figure 7-5 AMIBIOS supervisor password setup

Chapter 7: BIOS and CMOS
142
Discard changes and exit the CMOS setup program.
✖ Warning
The next step will erase all CMOS settings! While you are in the CMOS setup program, take the 
time to write down important settings such as the CPU settings, boot order, which integrated 
peripherals are enabled/disabled, and the power management setup. Although the system 
should run ﬁne using the default settings, taking notes now will help you get back to any 
custom settings that may have been conﬁgured.
Step 4 Shut down the PC and unplug the power cord from the PC and the wall outlet. Remove 
the case from the PC and, referring to the PC or motherboard documentation, locate the CMOS-clear 
jumper. Follow the instructions included with the documentation and move the jumper (see Figure 7-6) 
to clear the CMOS.
A less elegant alternative to using the CMOS-clear jumper is to remove the onboard battery for at 
least 30 seconds. Does your system have an onboard battery? Can it be removed easily?
Step 5 Replace the PC case cover, plug the system back in, and start the system. Press the appropriate 
key(s) to enter the CMOS setup program.
Were you prompted for a password? ___________________________________

BIOS-level virus checking is known to cause problems with the Windows 2000/XP/Vista installation 
process, so Microsoft advises that you disable it.
Many BIOS functions are unchangeable—such as keyboard and ﬂoppy drive recognition—and 
are therefore inaccessible via the CMOS setup program. Other functions are under your control. These 
include the boot sequence order and the date/time setting, as mentioned previously, but also some 
potentially hazardous settings such as BIOS shadowing and memory timing.
✔ Hint
If you’re not absolutely certain what a particular setting does, the best course of action is to leave 
it alone! If you have any doubts, you can always exit the CMOS setup program without saving.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll access the CMOS setup utility, navigate to ﬁnd the various BIOS settings you 
would commonly need to modify, and practice disabling BIOS-level virus checking.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Modify the settings in BIOS
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC whose BIOS settings you have permission to change
• 
If possible, a BIOS that includes virus checking
Getting Down to Business
In the following steps, you’ll learn how to navigate to the CMOS setup program conﬁguration screen that 
includes the virus-checking option. This example uses the Phoenix-Award BIOS CMOS setup program. 
Your CMOS setup program may vary, but all BIOS makers and versions should offer the same option.

✔ Cross-Reference
For more details about the features of CMOS setup programs, refer to the section “A Quick Tour 
Through a Typical CMOS Setup Program” in Chapter 7 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing 
and Troubleshooting PCs.
Step 1 Enter your CMOS setup program using the steps you learned in Lab Exercise 7.02.
Step 2 Check your notes and navigate to the conﬁguration screen that has the BIOS-level virus-
checking option. It’s not always obvious where to ﬁnd this option. For example, the Phoenix-Award 
BIOS CMOS setup program screen shown in Figure 7-4 doesn’t give any hints about where to ﬁnd the 
correct screen. As Figure 7-7 shows, virus checking can be disabled in this BIOS from the Advanced BIOS 
Features screen. Don’t hesitate to explore.
Step 3 Follow the screen prompts to navigate to the correct conﬁguration screen and ﬁnd the virus-
checking setting option. Highlight the option (using either the arrow keys or the mouse) and change 
it from Enabled to Disabled. Once again, your CMOS setup program’s wording or appearance may be 
different, but the option to control BIOS-level virus checking should be common to all modern types of 
BIOS.
Step 4 Save and exit the CMOS setup program. After you exit, the system will reboot automatically. 
You have just made a change to BIOS.
The process you just followed is the same process you’ll use for any changes you make to BIOS. Be 
sure to save the settings before exiting the setup utility.

Chapter 8: Expansion Bus
148
One of the many things that make PCs so useful is their amazing 
versatility. Modern PCs support a wide array of peripheral devices and 
attachments that expand their capabilities and boost performance. 
Peripherals attach to the PC via the expansion bus.
The expansion bus is the pathway that enables you to plug new devices 
and device controllers into the motherboard. This pathway can be split up 
into two groups: the internal expansion bus and the external expansion bus.
The most common internal expansion buses include the Peripheral 
Component Interconnect (PCI) bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, and the 
Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) bus, which was used exclusively for 
video cards on older systems. The most common external expansion buses 
include the Universal Serial Bus (USB) and the IEEE 1394 (FireWire) bus. 
You’ll explore the external expansion bus in great detail when you work 
through the lab exercises for Chapter 18.
➜ Note
Serial ATA (SATA) provides connections for drives and includes an external connection called 
eSATA for plugging in external hard disk drives. Chapter 11 goes into more detail on eSATA.
In these lab exercises, you’ll learn how to determine which expansion slots are available in a 
system, and how to install and remove expansion cards properly. This will help you gain conﬁdence in 
handling expansion card issues in the real world.
For the purposes of this chapter, suppose that you’ve befriended the owner of a small Internet café. 
Currently, the café has 12 PCs of various makes and models, all running Windows Vista Business. Paul, the 
owner, wanted the systems to perform well, so he ensured that each system had at least a 2.8-GHz processor 
and 4 GB of memory. In an attempt to keep the initial cost under budget, however, he purchased the 
systems without upgraded graphics or sound, so they are using the onboard graphics and sound.
Paul has noticed that many of the patrons seem to be using the systems to play games against each 
other in addition to the normal Internet surﬁng. Some of them have asked if there’s any way to improve 
the performance of the systems so that they can play more advanced games. Paul has been thinking of 
branching off into hosting LAN parties anyway, so he asks you to look into what it will take to upgrade 
the machines.

Lab Exercise 8.01: Identifying Internal Expansion Slots
149
➜ Note
A “LAN party” is where a group of people play games on computers connected to a small 
network. LAN parties are nerdy, but fun! Chapter 23 goes into more detail on networking.
You would enjoy recommending that Paul buy new PCs with the latest high-performance 
components—what tech wouldn’t want to play with the latest and greatest tech toys?—but since the 
machines are fairly new and well appointed, you decide to experiment with some upgrades. Because PC 
games are graphics- and sound-intensive, you believe that installing individual cards, such as a PCIe (or 
possibly AGP) graphics card and a PCI sound card, will improve the overall performance. You begin by 
assessing what expansion slots (PCI, AGP, and/or PCIe) are available on the current machines. You ask 
Paul for some cash up front, and choose two of the machines to test your theory.
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 8.01: Identifying Internal Expansion Slots
Unless you’ve got X-ray vision, the best way to examine the expansion slots is to remove the PC case 
cover. In this exercise, you’ll identify the type of expansion slots on your disassembled system, your 
working system, and as many systems (or motherboards) as you’re authorized to examine. Does your 
system use a PCIe, AGP, or PCI graphics card, or does it use onboard video as in our lab scenario? Check 
to see how many other expansion slots are available for adding a sound card and (if required) upgrading 
the graphics adapter.
✖ Warning
Remember to use proper safety and electrostatic discharge (ESD) avoidance procedures when 
working inside the PC case.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll properly identify expansion slots and the basic features of each type of expansion 
technology.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Identify PCI expansion bus slots and component cards
• 
Identify the AGP expansion bus slot and video card
• 
Identify PCIe ×1 and PCIe ×16 expansion bus slots and component cards

Chapter 8: Expansion Bus

Lab Materials and Setup
The non-production, disassembled PC and the working PC are adequate for this exercise, but it’s more 
beneﬁcial to be able to see motherboards inside different systems.
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Your non-production, disassembled PC
• 
A working PC (or more than one if possible)
• 
An anti-static mat
• 
A notepad
• 
Optional: Some sample motherboards 
Getting Down to Business
Start with the disassembled PC. Since the only components you have reinserted are the CPU and RAM, 
you should have a very clear view of the expansion bus slots and connections. You should also locate 
any expansion cards you removed during disassembly to identify what functions they serve. If the 
motherboard is still removed from the case, place it on the anti-static mat for exploration. If you have 
installed the motherboard into the case, lay the case down on the anti-static mat and follow all ESD 
precautions.
After completing the steps using the tear-down machine, switch over to your working PC. Shut 
down your PC and unplug it from the wall. Place it on your anti-static mat, remove the PC case cover, 
and take a good look inside. Your aim is to determine what type of expansion slots your motherboard 
has, and what peripheral card components are currently installed.
Step 1 Here are the physical characteristics of PCI expansion slots:
• 
About three inches long
• 
Usually white in color (modern motherboards may use bright colors like yellow or green to 
enhance the visual appeal of the motherboard)
• 
Offset from the edge of the motherboard by about one inch
Figure 8-1 shows PCI slots on a modern motherboard.
Record the following information:
How many PCI slots are on your motherboard? __________________________
What PCI devices are installed on your system? _________________________
How many PCI slots are empty? ______________________________________

Lab Exercise 8.01: Identifying Internal Expansion Slots
151
Step 2 See if you can locate a 32-bit AGP slot. As the name suggests, the AGP slot is used for one 
component only—the graphics adapter. Here are the physical characteristics of the AGP slot:
• 
One slot per motherboard
• 
A little less than three inches long
• 
Usually brown in color
• 
Offset from the edge of the motherboard by about two inches
Figure 8-2 shows an AGP slot in its natural habitat. While popular on slightly older motherboards, 
AGP slots have been all but ousted by PCIe, and your motherboard may not have one.
Record the following information:
Is there an AGP video card slot on your motherboard? _______________
 What can you tell about the type and brand of video card without removing it?  
____________________________________________________________________
Step 3 Take a look at your motherboard and see if there are any PCIe ×1 or PCIe ×16 slot connectors. 
These are fairly new (circa 2004), so you may not see them on all the motherboards you are exploring. 
PCIe is very interesting, offering a theoretical throughput of 2.5 Gbps per lane and supporting from 1 to 
32 lanes. The ﬁrst devices to take advantage of PCIe are graphics cards using the 16-lane conﬁguration. 
The physical characteristics of the PCIe expansion slots depend on the number of lanes. Figure 8-3 
shows PCIe slots on a modern motherboard.
PCIe ×1 slots have the following characteristics:
• 
About one inch long
• 
Often brightly colored (blue and white being fairly common)
• 
Offset from the edge of the motherboard by about 1.25 inches
Figure 8-1 A group of PCI slots

Chapter 8: Expansion Bus
152
PCIe ×16 slots have the following characteristics:
• 
About 3.5 inches long
• 
Often brightly colored (blue and white being fairly common)
• 
Offset from the edge of the motherboard by about 1.25 inches
Record the following information:
Are there any PCIe slots on your motherboard? __________________________
If yes, how many PCIe ×1 slots are there? _______________________________
How many PCIe ×16 slots are there? ___________________________________
Are there any PCIe cards installed in the system? ________________________

Lab Exercise 8.02: Installing Expansion Cards
There are ﬁve steps to installing any expansion card device properly:
1. 
Arm yourself with knowledge of the device before you install it. Is the device certiﬁed to run on 
the Windows OS that you’re running? Is it compatible with your motherboard and other hardware? 
Depending on your Windows version, be sure to check the Windows Catalog, Windows Vista 
Compatibility Center, or Windows Logo’d Product List (which can be found at http://winqual 
.microsoft.com/HCL/Default.aspx?m=x) before you do anything.
2. 
Remove the cover from your PC case and install the device. As always, follow all ESD and safety 
precautions, and handle the card with care.

Chapter 8: Expansion Bus
154
3. 
Assign system resources to the device. In approximately 99.99 percent of cases (a rough estimate), 
you won’t have to do this because plug and play (PnP) takes care of it for you, but if you’re working 
with an old, mid-1990s era system, then you may have to assign resources manually to accommodate 
the old, non-PnP device.
4. 
Install device drivers for the component. Windows comes with a large device drivers catalog, so 
it may try to help you by installing the driver that it thinks the device needs. In most cases, you 
should visit the card manufacturer’s Web site, download the latest drivers for the card and your 
operating system, and then install the updated drivers. You can also install the card and then use 
Microsoft/Windows Update, which may ﬁnd and download a copy of the latest driver from the 
manufacture.
5. 
Verify that the device is functional and that it’s not creating any conﬂicts with other devices on 
your system.
The following exercise is a somewhat abridged version of this procedure; instead of installing a new 
device, you’ll remove and reinstall devices that are already on your system.
✔ Cross-Reference
To review the details of device installation, refer to the “Installing Expansion Cards” section in 
Chapter 8 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll practice removing and installing internal expansion cards.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Remove and install expansion cards in a system correctly and safely
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
At least one working Windows computer with expansion cards installed
• 
A Phillips-head screwdriver
• 
An anti-static mat and wrist strap
• 
Anti-static storage bags
• 
A notepad

Lab Exercise 8.02: Installing Expansion Cards
155
➜ Note
As usual, if you have access to more than one system, take advantage of it—with one 
exception. You may be asking yourself, “Hey, how come I’m not reinstalling the cards into this 
disassembled PC I have sitting here?” That’s a very good question! 
In the next chapter, you’ll be practicing removing the motherboard from the case and 
reinstalling it. This process would be complicated by having a card or two sticking out of the 
motherboard. After you complete your practice on the motherboard, you can check back with 
this chapter and reinstall the expansion cards in the disassembled PC.
Getting Down to Business
In this exercise, you’ll physically remove expansion card devices from your PC. You’ll then make note of 
any important information you can ﬁnd on the device’s label: device maker, version, and so on. Finally, 
you’ll reassemble and restart the system. In Lab Exercise 8.03, you’ll use the Device Manager to make 
sure everything is working properly.
Shut down the system and unplug the power cable, and then place it on your anti-static mat. Once 
you remove the PC case cover and strap on your anti-static wrist strap, you’re ready to start.
Step 1 Check your notes from Lab Exercise 8.01 and draw a sketch showing which device is installed 
in which slot on the motherboard (assuming that you are using the same working machine from Lab 
Exercise 8.01).
Step 2 Remove the cards one at a time from your system. For each card, follow these procedures:
a. 
Remove the retaining screw and store it safely. Check for any latches on the expansion slot 
(see Figure 8-4) and release them when removing the video card.
✔ Hint
You’ll see two main types of screws used in PCs. At ﬁrst glance, they may look the same, but 
while these screws are the same overall size, they have different sizes of threads. Screws with 
the larger threads, commonly called coarse-threaded screws, are generally used to secure expansion 
cards, hard drives, power supplies, and case covers. Screws with the smaller threads, commonly 
called ﬁne-threaded screws, are typically used to secure storage devices such as ﬂoppy disk drives 
and optical drives into their respective bays.
b. 
Taking hold of the card by its edges, carefully and ﬁrmly pull it straight up and out of its slot.
✔ Hint
These cards can be difﬁcult to remove. If a card seems stuck, try rocking it back and forth (from 
front to back in the direction of the slot, not side to side).

Chapter 8: Expansion Bus
156
c. 
Holding the card only by the edges and the metal ﬂange, place it in an anti-static bag for 
safekeeping.
Step 3 Examine each of the cards you removed from your system and record the pertinent information.
Do any of the cards have writing or labels on them? If so, what information do these labels provide?
Can you identify the manufacturers of the cards? If so, list each card and its manufacturer.
Figure 8-4 Releasing a latch holding in the video card

Lab Exercise 8.02: Installing Expansion Cards
157
Are there any version numbers or codes on the cards? If so, list this information for each card.
What kind of interface does each card use? List whether it is a PCI, AGP, PCIe (or something else).
Step 4 Reinstall into your system the expansion cards you removed. For each card, follow these 
procedures:
a. 
Check your notes to conﬁrm where to reinstall the card.
b. 
Align the card over its motherboard slot, making sure that the metal ﬂange is aligned properly 
with the case slot. Holding the ﬂange with one hand, place the heel of your hand on the top 
edge of the card and push the card ﬁrmly into the expansion slot.
c. 
Once the card is in the slot and the ﬂange is ﬂush with the case, replace the screw that holds 
the card in place. Don’t be tempted to skip the screw! It keeps the card from working loose 
over time.
✖ Warning
After you have reinstalled all the expansion cards, take a look at the back of your system (where 
you can see input/output connections for the cards). Are there any holes where no cards are 
installed and a slot cover has not been used? It’s very important to install slot covers wherever 
an expansion card is not installed. This ensures that air will ﬂow properly through the 
computer case, keeping your critical components cool.

Lab Exercise 8.03: Managing Hardware  
with Device Manager
Windows is capable of utilizing a universe of peripherals and expansion cards—everything from 
modems to TV tuners. Management of this massive collection of hardware in Windows is handled by the 
Device Manager.
The Device Manager provides a centralized location for dealing with all aspects of the computer’s 
hardware. This includes a simple inventory of all installed devices, notiﬁcation of malfunctioning 
devices, and the capability to install and update drivers.
This exercise will cover some of the more useful features of the Device Manager.
✔ Cross-Reference
If you need a refresher on system resources, refer to the “System Resources” section in Chapter 8 
of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll use the Device Manager to examine and update a system.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use the Device Manager to examine devices on your system, check for problems, and update 
drivers
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
•

• 
Access to the Internet
✔ Hint
As usual, if you have access to more than one system, take advantage of it.

Lab Exercise 8.03: Managing Hardware with Device Manager
159
Getting Down to Business
In this exercise, you’ll use the Device Manager to view the system resource settings on your PC.
Step 1 Open the Windows Control Panel. In Windows 2000/XP, click the icon for the System applet. 
Select the Hardware tab and then click the Device Manager button; this brings up the Device Manager 
in a separate window (see Figure 8-5). In Windows Vista, select System and Maintenance, and then 
choose Device Manager. If Control Panel is set to Classic View, select the Device Manager applet directly. 
Note that you can also access this applet by pressing the Windows key and the PAUSE/BREAK key at the 
same time.
Step 2 Check for any missing devices, or devices marked with error icons:
• 
A device marked with a black “!” on a yellow circle means that the device is missing, Windows 
does not recognize it, or there is a driver issue.
• 
A device marked with a red “X” means the device is disabled. It has either been turned off or 
damaged.
Step 3 Download and install the latest device drivers for each of your expansion cards. There are 
many methods you can use to accomplish this task, but the two that follow are the most common.
• 
If your working PC is connected to the Internet, you can use the Update Driver Wizard from 
the device’s Driver tab in the Device Manager to connect to Windows Update. Open the Device 
Manager and select View device by type. Locate the device that matches the expansion card you 
have installed, and open its properties. Select the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver as 
shown in Figure 8-6. This brings up the Hardware Update Wizard, as shown in Figure 8-7; from 
here you can follow the directions to download the signed driver from the Windows Update site.

• 
If your working PC is not connected to the Internet, or the device does not have a signed 
driver available through Windows Update, you will have to follow these instructions before 
clicking Update Driver. Using a computer with Internet access, ﬁnd and connect to the 
manufacturer’s Web site. Using the model number of the device, locate and download the 
correct driver for the operating system on the PC where the device is installed. Save the driver 
to a ﬂoppy disk or USB thumb drive, remove the ﬂoppy or thumb drive from that system, and 
insert it into your working PC. Open Device Manager and select View device by type. Locate the 
device that matches the expansion card you have installed, and open its properties. Select the 
Driver tab, and then click Update Driver. When prompted to connect to the Internet, choose No, 
not this time, and follow the directions to locate and load the new device driver (see Figure 8-8).

✔ Hint
Many manufacturers include installation wizards for their devices, so that is yet another 
method that you can use to update device drivers. Many times, the manufacturer will include 
related applications along with the drivers to enhance the performance of the device. A good 
example of this is an inkjet printer that includes the driver and utilities for adjusting print 
quality, performing printer maintenance, and so on.

Chapter 9: Motherboards
164
With all due respect to the CPU, system RAM, power supply, hard drive, 
and all the other sundry pieces of a typical PC, the motherboard is the 
real workhorse of the system. Every component on the PC plugs into the 
motherboard either directly or indirectly. Every bit and byte of data that 
moves between devices passes through the motherboard’s sockets and 
traces. The motherboard is what brings all of the individual parts of the 
PC into a working whole. As such, replacing a motherboard is one of the 
most challenging tasks a PC tech will face.
Luckily, only a couple of circumstances require you to undertake this 
chore. The ﬁrst is when the motherboard malfunctions or is damaged; 
modern motherboards aren’t made to be repaired, so when they go bad, 
they must be replaced as a whole unit. The other is when you want to 
upgrade the PC with a more powerful CPU than its current motherboard 
supports. In either of these cases, you’ve got a bit of work ahead of you! 
Installing a motherboard requires more effort than any other type of 
installation—more preparation, more time performing the installation, 
and more cleanup afterward. Still, you shouldn’t be intimidated by the 
prospect of replacing a motherboard—it’s a common and necessary part 
of PC repair. In this chapter, you’ll go through the process from start to 
ﬁnish.
In the following lab exercises, you’ll make preparations for a motherboard 
installation, including labeling cables and connectors, removing the 
motherboard from a working PC, and exploring its features. You’ll then 
research new motherboards, reinstall your motherboard, and explore 
your motherboard more thoroughly using CPU-Z.

Lab Exercise 9.01: Removing and Labeling Components and Cables

S 15 minutes
Lab Exercise 9.01: Removing and Labeling 
Components and Cables
You are consulting for a small graphics ﬁrm that’s upgrading its PCs to accommodate a major software 
upgrade and network restructuring. While assessing the company’s PC stock, you discover that a number 
of its systems lack sufﬁcient CPU power to run an important new CAD program.  To remedy this, you 
must replace the motherboards of these systems with models that support newer and faster CPUs.
➜ Note
CAD, or computer-aided design, refers to any software that helps users draw or draft designs, usually 
of a technical nature. This type of software is commonly used by engineers and architects.
The ﬁrst step, however, is to remove the motherboard, which can be daunting. To get to the 
motherboard, you have to remove the installed expansion cards and cables ﬁrst. Many of us have had 
the experience of taking something apart only to wind up with leftover parts after we put it back 
together. To avoid this result when you disassemble a PC, you should get into the habit of properly storing 
and labeling any parts that you remove from the system. This includes everything from the major 
components to the screws that hold them in place and the cables that connect them to the motherboard.
✔ Hint
If you are using the disassembled non-production machine for this lab, you have already removed 
and organized the components and cables from the machine. Use this step to review the labeling and 
storage of components and cables in preparation for removal and installation of the motherboard. 
If you are using a second machine for this exercise, make use of this lab to build the “good habit” of 
organization. Of course, you don’t need to attach a label to each individual screw, but do keep them 
organized in labeled containers to avoid confusion!
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll remove and label expansion card components, cables, and connectors in preparation 
for removing the motherboard.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
•

Getting Down to Business
Starting with your system shut down (and, as always, the power cable unplugged from the wall and the 
case), set your system on the anti-static mat, remove the PC case cover, and strap on your anti-static 
wrist strap. Have your labeling materials handy and perform the following steps.
Step 1 Following the procedure laid out in Lab Exercise 8.03 in the previous chapter, remove any 
expansion cards from the PC. Label each one with a sticky note that identiﬁes the card, and store it in 
an anti-static bag.
Step 2 Disconnect and label the following data cables:
• 
Hard drive cables
• 
Optical drive cables
• 
Floppy drive cable
• 
Sound cable (runs from the optical drive to the sound card)
• 
USB front panel connector dongle (if applicable)
Step 3 Disconnect and label the following power cables:
• 
Hard drive cables
• 
Optical drive cables
• 
Floppy drive cable
• 
Power plugs for CPU fan, power supply fan (if present), and case fan (if present)
• 
Motherboard power (P1 and P4)
Step 4 Disconnect and label the front panel control wires (also called the harness wires) from the 
motherboard. Be certain to use the motherboard book to properly label these wires! Front panel control 
wires typically include the power button, reset button, front panel LEDs (power, hard disk activity, and 
so on), and system speaker.

✔ Hint
To label wires, use the small sticky notes, or cut the square ones into strips. Write on it, fold the 
sticky part of the sticky note over the wire, and stick it to the back to make a tag.
Step 5 Depending on your system, you may have to remove other devices to ensure that you have 
sufﬁcient clearance to lift the motherboard out of the PC case in the next exercise. Visually conﬁrm 
that there aren’t any components blocking a path for easy removal. Are any hard drives or optical 
drives in the way? Is the power supply in the way? Remove anything that could block the motherboard’s 
exit or bump into important attached components (namely the RAM or CPU fan) during removal.

Lab Exercise 9.02: Removing a Motherboard
With all of your PC components and cables safely tucked away, the next step in your upgrade job is to 
remove the old motherboard so that you can replace it. Techs will tell you that motherboard removal is 
the exercise that separates the geek from the meek and the true PC tech from the wannabe, but don’t let 
that intimidate you! Motherboard removal is completely straightforward and simple.
✔ Hint
Once again, if you’re using the disassembled non-production machine, you have already removed the 
motherboard from the case, but you should use this exercise to review. If you’re using  
a different machine for this exercise, follow the instructions.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll remove your PC’s motherboard.

Following the same ESD avoidance procedures listed in the previous exercise, you’ll now remove the 
mounting screws for the motherboard and lift it out of the PC case.
Step 1 Locate and remove the screws holding the motherboard to the frame of the case. There are 
most likely six to nine screws, which may also have small washers. Be sure not to lose these washers 
because they help prevent over-tightening the screws during installation. Some systems may use small 
plastic or metal supports called standoffs between the motherboard and the frame. Remove these and 
store them in a labeled container.
✖ Warning
Remember to handle the motherboard as you would any printed circuit board: gently, by the edges, 
as if you were holding a delicate old photograph.
Step 2 Carefully remove the motherboard from the PC case and place it on your anti-static mat. You 
should place the motherboard in a large anti-static bag for the best protection.

Lab Exercise 9.03: Identifying Motherboard Features
At a glance, one motherboard pretty much looks like any other. Of course, as a PC tech, you know that 
many differences may exist: Two identical-looking motherboards can have completely different feature 
sets. Chipsets, bus speed, CPU socket type, and clock speed are just some of the important features that 
separate one motherboard from another. These differences aren’t always obvious, but you can turn to 
your motherboard book to identify your motherboard’s features, as described in the following steps.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll become familiar with different motherboard features.

Lab Exercise 9.04: Researching New Motherboards
While the motherboard may be the backbone of a PC, all good upgrade efforts should begin with the CPU. 
Trying to pick out a motherboard and then a processor that goes with it is a little like choosing a new car 
stereo before you choose a new car—you can do it, but you might end up having to modify the dashboard 
to make it ﬁt. In other words, it’s much less painful to work from CPU to motherboard, especially when 
your goal is to increase performance. Don’t tie yourself down by doing it backwards.
There are a lot of variables to cover when searching for a new CPU and motherboard. Ensuring 
compatibility is key. Once you’ve picked the latest and greatest processor from Intel or AMD, you need to 
ﬁnd a motherboard that will play nicely with it. This involves matching the socket type of the processor 
to the socket type of the motherboard. You must also make sure that the motherboard’s form factor is 
compatible with your case. And even after you’ve narrowed it down to that, there is still the matter of 
picking a manufacturer and determining which features you want the motherboard to have.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll become familiar with different motherboards and their compatibility with various 
processors and cases.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Recognize different motherboard form factors
• 
Understand considerations for upgrading a system with a newer motherboard

Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
The disassembled, non-production PC computer system used in the lab exercises in Chapter 3
• 
A PC with Internet access
• 
An anti-static mat and anti-static wrist strap
✔ Hint
As usual, if you have access to multiple systems, take advantage of it. It’s most useful to have a 
variety of motherboards to study.
Getting Down to Business
The following steps will lead you through the process of determining which motherboard you need to 
obtain to update your client’s systems. You’ll also see that a motherboard is not an island unto itself, but 
one piece of the archipelago that is a PC.
Step 1 Go to www.newegg.com (or another online PC component store) and search for a newer, faster 
processor. When selecting a new processor, be sure to keep track of important speciﬁcations so that you 
can refer to them when you need to pick out a motherboard. Record the following information:
Manufacturer __________________________________________________
Series _________________________________________________________
CPU socket type _________________________________________________
Step 2 Search the online PC component store for a new motherboard. Keep in mind that the CPU’s 
socket type must match the motherboard’s, otherwise they will be incompatible. You’ll ﬁnd more than 
one that is compatible, but for now, pick one and record the following information:
Manufacturer __________________________________________________
CPU socket type _________________________________________________
Form factor ____________________________________________________
Expansion slots _________________________________________________
 
 
  _________________________________________________
Step 3 The next step to ﬁnding a new and compatible motherboard is to make sure that it will work 
with the form factor of your client’s system cases.

Chapter 9: Motherboards
172
Current PC motherboards come in a few different styles, or form factors: ATX (Advanced Technology 
eXtended), microATX and FlexATX, BTX (Balanced Technology eXtended), and proprietary form factors 
from companies such as Dell and Sony. Each motherboard form factor has a corresponding case it is 
compatible with, but some motherboards will ﬁt in a case with a different form factor. ATX motherboards 
are what you ﬁnd in most PCs on the market.
ATX, microATX, and FlexATX are all in the same family. The FlexATX is physically the smallest in 
size, the microATX is in the middle, and the ATX is the largest. Typically, all three will work in the large 
ATX case because all three variations retain the same form factor for the external connections.
From 2005 to around 2007, BTX looked as though it would be the next big thing in motherboard 
form factors. Sadly, the BTX standards were so strict that manufacturers simply could not ﬁt newer 
chipsets onto a BTX motherboard. But some BTX boards are still out there, so you may still encounter 
them. These are essentially the same components rearranged for better cooling, but this form factor 
requires a BTX case, so it is not interchangeable with ATX.
Your client’s cases are all ATX. Is the motherboard you picked compatible? ____________________
What if the client wants to switch over to microATX cases in the future—would the same motherboard 
still work? Why? _________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
Step 4 Look at a few different (but still compatible) motherboards. Compare their features. What 
makes them different? Does one have more expansion slots than the other? Does one have fewer RAM 
slots? Are there other features, such as support for NVIDIA’s SLI or ATI’s CrossFire dual-graphics card 
technology, that would inﬂuence your choice? Using the motherboard you already selected, record the 
following information:
Number of memory slots ______________________________________
Maximum memory supported __________________________________
SATA ports _________________________________________________
Onboard video chipset ________________________________________
Other features ______________________________________________

Lab Exercise 9.05: Installing a Motherboard
Now you get the real test of your tech skills: installing the new motherboards and reconnecting everything so 
that the computers work again! Don’t be intimidated, though. Everything you need to install a motherboard 
(in your case, probably the motherboard you just removed in Lab Exercise 9.02) is right in front of you.

Lab Exercise 9.05: Installing a Motherboard
173
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll install a motherboard. You can use the motherboard and system you disassembled in 
Lab Exercise 9.03.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Install a PC motherboard and connect all its associated components
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
The disassembled, non-production PC computer system used in the lab exercises in Chapter 3
• 
A working system from which the motherboard has been removed
• 
Components and cables previously connected to the removed motherboard
• 
The motherboard book or online documentation for the motherboard
• 
An anti-static mat and anti-static wrist strap
• 
A notepad and pen
Over the past few labs, you have concentrated on hardware removal and installation, using 
either the disassembled non-production system or a working non-production system—or in some 
cases both. It is very easy to become casual or even careless about technique and organization 
since these machines are noncritical.
One of the really important concepts to remember is that all of these efforts—the studying, the 
labs, and the CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation itself—are designed to help you become the highest-quality 
tech that you can be! It’s very important that you develop and practice patience, attention to 
detail, and ﬁnesse while working through the lab exercises.
To this end, when you remove and replace a motherboard in a system, you interact with 
almost every component of the computer system. In the ﬁeld, you must not only successfully 
disassemble/assemble the hardware, but also verify that the system powers up and operates 
properly afterward. Many competent techs, when installing a new motherboard, will check for 
proper operation along the way. Here’s a good checkpoint: After you’ve installed the CPU and 
RAM, conﬁgured any jumpers or switches, and installed the motherboard in the case, insert the 
power connections and test the system. A POST card is a real timesaver here, but you can also 
connect the PC speaker, a graphics card, monitor, and a keyboard to verify that the system is 
booting properly.

Chapter 9: Motherboards

Getting Down to Business
Physically installing the motherboard itself is mostly a matter of being careful and methodical. The 
more complex part of the task is reattaching all the cables and cards in their proper places.
✖ Warning
Motherboards are full of delicate electronics! Remember to follow the proper ESD avoidance and 
safety procedures.
✔ Hint
When installing a motherboard, it’s handy to use your notepad to check off assembly steps as you go 
along.
Step 1 Carefully line up the motherboard inside the PC case and secure it in place with the mounting 
screws. Be sure to use the washers and plastic/metal standoffs, if supplied.
Step 2 Insert the front panel control wires in their appropriate places. These should include your 
power button, reset button, front panel LEDs (power, hard disk activity, and so on), system speaker, 
and so on. Refer to the labels and your motherboard documentation for the proper connections.
✔ Hint
At this point, if you’re working on the disassembled, non-production system, skip to Step 5, install 
the expansion cards, and then set the system aside. You will continue to build the  
disassembled system in future lab exercises where you will explore the power supply, hard drives, 
removable storage, and audio/video components.
Step 3 Connect all power cables to the hard drive, optical drive, ﬂoppy drive, CPU fan, main 
motherboard, and so on.
Step 4 Connect data cables to the hard drive, optical drive, and ﬂoppy drive, as well as the sound 
cable and USB connector dongles, if applicable.
Step 5 Following the procedure laid out in Lab Exercise 8.02 in the previous chapter, install the 
expansion card components.

Lab Exercise 9.06: Exploring Motherboard Features with CPU-Z

Step 6 Now comes perhaps the most important step: Double-check all of your connections and cards 
to make sure that they’re properly seated and connected where they’re supposed to be! If something is 
wrong, it’s deﬁnitely better to discover it now than to smell smoke after you’ve hit the power switch.
Step 7 If you’re using the working PC you previously disassembled, you can now replace the case cover 
on your PC. Then plug the keyboard, mouse, and monitor back in, plug the power cable back in, and 
ﬁnally turn on the PC. Assuming you’ve done everything correctly, your system will boot up normally.

Lab Exercise 9.06: Exploring Motherboard  
Features with CPU-Z
Now that you’ve completed the analysis and upgrade of your client’s systems with new motherboards 
and CPUs where needed, you can verify some of the characteristics and features the motherboard 
manufacturer has promoted. You already downloaded the CPU-Z utility from the Internet, so you can 
launch that to examine the information on the Mainboard tab.
✔ Hint
Over the years, motherboards have been called many names—and not just the bad names you might 
use when one doesn’t work properly! Early motherboards were sometimes called the planar board. 
A motherboard can be referred to as the system board, mainboard, and sometimes just board or mobo. 
Regardless of the name, these terms refer to the large printed circuit board (PCB) used to connect all 
the components in a computer system.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll identify various motherboard features.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Verify motherboard features
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Access to a working computer with the CPU-Z utility installed
•

Chapter 10: Power Supplies
180
The term “power supply” is somewhat misleading. After all, the power 
supply in a PC does not actually supply power; it just takes the alternating 
current (AC) supplied by the power company and converts it to the direct 
current (DC) used by the computer system. Local power companies supply 
AC to the outlet in your home or ofﬁce, and some conversion must take 
place to supply the lower operating voltages and DC power required for 
the PC to function.
As a PC technician, you need to understand the difference between AC 
and DC power. You should be able to measure the AC power at the wall 
outlet and determine whether the hot, neutral, and ground wires are 
properly connected. You must also measure the DC output of the power 
supply inside the PC case to determine whether the power supply is 
providing the correct DC voltage.
The power supply in a PC is an electronic device that converts the 
higher voltage—120 volts of alternating current (VAC) in the United 
States or 240 VAC outside the United States—into the three power levels 
of 12, 5, and 3.3 volts of direct current (VDC) used in today’s PC systems. 
The 12-volt level is traditionally used for devices that have motors to spin, 
such as hard drives, ﬂoppy drives, CD/DVD-ROM drives, and cooling fans. 
The 5-volt and 3.3-volt power usually supports all of the onboard electronics. 
Modern CPUs often use less than 3.3 volts, so there are further step-down 
regulators and ﬁlters to provide core voltages as low as 1.4 volts.
The various versions of the ATX power supplies are, by far, the most 
common power supplies you will see on desktop computer systems. These 
include ATX (with a 20-pin P1 power connector), ATX 12V 1.3 (which added 
the AUX 4-pin connector commonly referred to as P4), and the ATX 12V 
2.0 (which added the 24-pin P1 connector and dropped the P4 connector). 

Lab Exercise 10.01: Electricity
181
Higher-end computers such as servers and gaming systems with multiple 
high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) often require much more 
current, so you may start to see the Server System Infrastructure (SSI)–
developed, non-ATX-standard motherboard with a power supply named 
EPS 12V; it uses a 24-pin P1 connector, a 4-pin P4 connector, and a unique 
8-pin connector.
Suppose a client calls you saying that her PC keeps locking up. After 
walking her through a few simple troubleshooting steps, you rule out a 
virus or a misbehaving application. This leaves hardware as the likely 
culprit, and in all likelihood, it’s the power supply. In these lab exercises, 
you’ll practice the procedures for measuring power going to the PC, testing 
the PC’s power supply, and replacing a PC power supply.
✔ Hint
The CompTIA A+ exams show their American roots in the area of electrical power. Watch for 
power questions that discuss American power standards—especially ones related to household 
voltage and outlet plug design. 
The exams will also typically refer to the power supply using the abbreviation PSU (power supply 
unit) or the acronym FRU (ﬁeld replaceable unit). FRU can describe any component that would 
be replaced in the ﬁeld by a technician.

Lab Exercise 10.01: Electricity
Troubleshooting power-related problems is one of the trickier tasks you’ll undertake as a PC tech. Your 
ﬁrst step is to go right to the source, so to speak, and make certain that the power being supplied to the 
PC from the electrical outlet is good.

At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Determine if the AC wiring is correct at a wall outlet
• 
Determine if the AC voltages are correct at a wall outlet
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
An AC electrical outlet tester
• 
A multimeter
Getting Down to Business
Measuring the voltage coming from an AC outlet is a nerve-wracking task even for experienced techs! 
Sticking objects into a live power outlet goes against everything you’ve been taught since infancy, but 
when done properly, it really is completely safe.
Be sure to use common sense and appropriate safety procedures. If you’re not familiar with using 
a multimeter, please review the “Supplying AC” section in Chapter 10 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to 
Managing and Troubleshooting PCs, or ask your instructor for a demonstration.
✔ Hint
If a PC is having unexplained errors and you suspect the power supply, don’t be too hasty in 
replacing it. First check the wall outlet. In some buildings, especially older ones, the wiring can 
be improperly connected or otherwise provide poor power.
Step 1 Look at Figure 10-1, and compare it to your electrical outlet.
Figure 10-1 A typical 
AC electrical outlet

Lab Exercise 10.01: Electricity
183
A typical electrical socket has three openings: hot, neutral, and ground. The hot wire delivers the 
juice. The neutral wire acts as a drain and returns electricity to the local source (the breaker panel). 
The semi-rounded ground socket returns excess electricity to the ground. If your outlet doesn’t have a 
ground socket—and outlets in many older buildings don’t—then don’t use it! Ungrounded outlets aren’t 
appropriate for PCs.
✖ Warning
Take all appropriate safety precautions before measuring live electrical outlets. In a classroom, you 
have the beneﬁt of an instructor to show you how to do these exercises the ﬁrst time. If you’re 
doing these on your own with no experience, seek the advice of a trained technician or instructor.
Step 2 Determine whether or not your electrical socket is “live.” Do this with your electrical outlet 
tester. Plug your outlet tester (see Figure 10-2) into the electrical outlet or power strip where you plug 
in the PC. Look at the LED indicators. Are they showing good power?
Step 3 Now measure the voltage between the hot and neutral openings of the outlet. Start by setting 
your multimeter to AC voltage; do not proceed until you’re sure you have done this correctly! If you 
aren’t sure, ask your instructor for guidance. Referring to Figure 10-3, take the black probe and place it 
in the neutral opening of the wall socket. Make sure you have good contact inside the outlet. The metal 
probe tip must contact the metal connector inside the outlet.
Figure 10-2 A circuit tester 
for AC electrical outlets

Chapter 10: Power Supplies
184
Next, place the red probe inside the hot opening. Again, you must make good metal-to-metal contact. 
You may have to reposition the probes to get a good connection and proper reading for the AC circuit. 
Your reading should be somewhere between 110 and 120 V.
What is your reading? ____________________
Step 4 Measure the voltage in the hot-to-ground circuit. Place the black probe into the ground 
opening of the outlet, as shown in Figure 10-4. Make sure you have good contact. Then place the red 
probe into the hot opening. Move the probes around until you get a good reading for the AC voltage. 
Again, your reading should be in the 110- to 120-V range.
What is your reading? ____________________
Step 5 The last measurement you need to take is the voltage in the neutral-to-ground safety circuit. 
When the neutral wire is broken or missing, the ground wire is the only way for wayward electrons to 
depart safely. Any electricity on both the neutral and ground wires should have a direct path back to 
earth, so there should be no voltage between these wires.
Place the black probe into the ground opening of the outlet. Make sure you have good contact. Place 
the red probe into the neutral opening (refer to Figure 10-5). Move the probes around until you get a 
good reading for the AC voltage. You should get a reading of 0 V.
What is your reading? ____________________

Step 6 Measure another outlet in the same building, and repeat the previous steps. Are the readings 
similar? If the readings from your electrical outlets are outside of the ranges described, it’s time to call 
an electrician. Assuming your reading is showing good power, go to the next exercise.

Since this lab exercise takes you through the steps you would perform on an actual trouble 
ticket, the scenario has you working on a machine that is completely assembled. If, however, 
you are working on the disassembled, non-production machine, you should proceed to Lab 
Exercise 10.03 (“Replacing a Power Supply”) and reinstall the power supply in the tear-down 
machine. You may then return here and perform the power supply output exercises.

Lab Exercise 10.02: Power Supply Output
187
Getting Down to Business
There are two ways to determine whether a power supply is providing the proper voltages to the 
components of the computer. One is the traditional method, using a multimeter to measure the actual 
voltages. Another method growing in popularity is the use of a PC power supply tester.
✔ Cross-Reference
For details on DC power from the power supply, refer to the “Supplying DC” section in Chapter 10 
of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
In the following steps, you’ll measure DC voltage coming from the PC power supply. The two places 
to measure power supply output are at the Molex power connectors and at the motherboard power 
connector. Molex power connectors plug into devices that need 5 or 12 volts of power. These include 
hard drives and CD- or DVD-media drives. Mini power connectors also carry 5 or 12 volts, but on modern 
systems these are used only for ﬂoppy drives. On most recent systems, the power supply will provide 
two motherboard power connectors: the 20- or 24-pin P1 and the smaller P4 (see Figure 10-6). Both of 
these power connectors are used on motherboards requiring an additional 12 V power supply.
You’ll then plug the P1 power connector into a PC power supply tester and verify that the readings 
you measured with the multimeter are within tolerance. The power supply tester has LEDs that will 
glow green for each of the voltages that it passes.
✖ Warning
Although the power coming out of the PC power supply is considerably less lethal than that 
coming directly out of the electrical outlet, you should still take all appropriate safety  
precautions before taking measurements.
Figure 10-6 Motherboard power connectors: P1 (left) 
and P4 (right)

Chapter 10: Power Supplies
188
Step 1 Set the multimeter to read DC voltage. Find a Molex connector that’s not being used for a 
device. If no Molex connectors are unused, turn the system off and disconnect the one from the CD- or 
DVD-media drive, and then turn the PC back on.
Step 2 Referring to Figure 10-7, place the black probe into either one of the holes on the Molex 
connector that is aligned with a black wire. Now place the red probe into each of the other three holes 
of the Molex connector in turn, ﬁrst the other black wire, then the red, then yellow, and record your 
ﬁndings.
Black wire to black wire: ___________ V
Black wire to red wire: _____________ V
Black wire to yellow wire: __________ V
Step 3 Measuring the voltage from the motherboard connector is a little trickier. Leave the power 
connector plugged into the motherboard and push the probes into the end of the connector that the 
wires run into. You must push the probe deep enough to touch the metal contact pins, but be careful 
not to push too deeply or you might push the pin out of the connector.
Push the black probe into the motherboard connector alongside any black wire, and leave it there. 
Insert the red probe into each of the other wires, and record your ﬁndings. Depending on your 
motherboard connector, you may not have all of these wires.
Black wire to red wire: _____________ V
Black wire to yellow wire: __________ V

Molex connector

189
Black wire to purple wire: __________ V
Black wire to white wire: ___________ V
Black wire to black wire: ___________ V
Black wire to blue wire: ____________ V
Black wire to green wire: ___________ V
The voltages generated by the power supply must be within a tolerance (range) level; readings outside 
these ranges mean the power supply should be replaced. The 5 V connections have a tolerance of ±2 percent 
(4.9 to 5.1 V is okay), and 12 V connections have a tolerance of ±6 percent (11.25 to 12.75 V is okay).
✔ Hint
A single reading from your power supply may not be enough to pinpoint a power-related problem. 
Sometimes a power problem becomes evident only when the power supply is placed under a 
heavier-than-normal load, such as burning a CD or DVD. Also, some RAM-related errors mimic a 
failing power supply.
The other method to verify that the power supply is operating properly and supplying all the voltages 
within tolerance is to use a power supply tester. There are many styles of PSU testers on the market, so 
make sure you follow the speciﬁc directions included with your tester as you complete the steps.
Step 1 Starting with the P1 connector, follow the directions for connecting it to your speciﬁc PSU 
tester. Verify that all of the voltages provided through the P1 connector are acceptable (usually an LED 
will light to verify voltage present and within tolerance).
✔ Hint
When connecting and disconnecting the power supply connectors, always take care to insert the 
connector with the proper orientation. Most power connectors are keyed to make it difﬁcult to 
install the connector backwards, but if you use excessive force, you may be able to insert the 
connector improperly. This applies to powering the motherboard, plugging in devices, and even 
using the PSU tester.
Step 2 Now, depending on your tester and power supply, plug either the 4-pin, 6-pin, or 8-pin 
auxiliary connector into the appropriate socket on the PSU tester and verify the voltages provided 
through this connector. Once they are veriﬁed, remove the connector from the socket.

Chapter 10: Power Supplies
190
Step 3 Plug the Molex connector into the PSU tester and verify the voltages provided through this 
connector. Once they are veriﬁed, remove the connector from the socket.
Step 4 Plug the SATA HDD power connector into the appropriate socket and verify the voltages 
provided through this connector. Once they are veriﬁed, remove the connector from the socket.
Step 5 Finally, plug the mini ﬂoppy drive power connector into the PSU tester and verify the 
voltages provided through this connector. Once they are veriﬁed, remove the connector from the socket 
and remove the P1 from the socket.

Lab Exercise 10.03: Replacing a Power Supply
Let’s assume that you’ve found a variance in the 12 V range that explains your client’s system lockups. 
You know that power supplies aren’t user-serviceable components—you don’t ﬁx them, you replace 
them as a unit—so it’s time to replace her power supply. Next to the motherboard, the power supply 
is the most time-consuming component to replace, simply because of all those wires! Nonetheless, 
replacing the power supply is a simple operation, as described in this exercise.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Determine the total wattage requirements of the system and select the proper power supply
• 
Replace a power supply

One of the areas where PC manufacturers cut corners on lower-end systems is power supplies. High-end 
systems typically come with higher-wattage power supplies, whereas entry-level PCs typically have 
lower-wattage power supplies. This might not be evident until you add power-hungry components to the 
system, placing a heavier load on the power supply and causing an early failure.

Lab Exercise 10.03: Replacing a Power Supply
191
In the following steps you’ll determine the wattage of the power supply on your system, calculate 
the power usage of your PC, and then remove and reinstall the power supply.
Step 1 To ﬁnd out what the wattage rating of your power supply is, look at the label on the power 
supply (see Figure 10-8).
Locate the watts rating. If you don’t see a clear wattage rating as shown in Figure 10-8, or if you see 
something less evident, like the smaller “430 W” marking on the label, the power supply rating may be 
hidden in the model number, which in this example is “Neo HE430.”
✔ Hint
All power supplies have a wattage rating. If it is not apparent on the power supply itself, search 
the Internet using the model number for reference.
What is the wattage of your power supply? __________________
Step 2 When it comes time to replace a power supply, don’t skimp on the wattage! Modern power 
supplies typically range from 300 watts to 1000 watts or more; 300-watt power supplies are the bare 
minimum you would use on a system that has only a few installed components (such as a single 
hard drive and CD- or DVD-media drive), while the 1000-watt models are usually found on server 
systems that have multiple hard drives (such as a RAID array), multiple processors, or other power-
hungry components. Many gaming systems with high-performance graphics cards and processors, 
and SATA RAID conﬁgurations will use PSUs that provide 550–650 watts to meet these systems’ power 
requirements. As a general rule, get the highest-wattage replacement you can afford while maintaining 
compatibility with your system. Remember, the system will draw only the current it requires, so you 
will never damage a system by installing a higher-wattage power supply.

✖ Warning
Never replace a PC’s power supply with one of lower wattage!
Use the following table to calculate the overall wattage needed for your system. Add the numbers for

If the highest total exceeds the power supply wattage rating, you may run into problems. When 
selecting a new power supply, you should multiply the load by a factor of 1.5. The multiplier provides 
a safety factor and allows the power supply to run more efﬁciently. A power supply is more efﬁcient at 
30 to 70 percent of its full capacity rating. Thus, a 450–watt PSU works best when only 135 to 315 watts 
are being used.

✔ Hint
Depending on the design of your PC case, you may have to remove data cables or components 
before you can get to the power supply. Make certain that you have plenty of room to work 
inside the case!
Step 3 Shut down the system and remove the power cable from the back of the power supply. Then 
remove the power supply.
a. 
Disconnect the Molex, SATA, and mini connectors from your drive devices, then unplug the 
main power connector from the motherboard.
b. 
If your power supply uses a P4 connector, disconnect it from the motherboard.
c. 
Unscrew the four screws holding the power supply onto the PC case (remembering to support it 
while you remove the last one!), and remove the power supply from the case. Store the screws 
in a labeled container.
Step 4 Take this opportunity to inspect and clean the power supply. Check for any rust or corrosion 
on the power supply casing or on any of the contacts. Inspect the wires for damage or frayed 
insulation. Use canned air to blow dust and dirt out of the intake and exhaust vents.
Step 5 Reinstall the power supply by performing the preceding steps in reverse order. If you had to 
remove data cables or other components to get at the power supply, be sure to reattach them.

Lab Exercise 10.04: Power Protection
You’ve successfully ﬁxed your client’s power-problem-plagued PC (say that ﬁve times fast!), but now 
you’ve noted that she has nothing in the way of power protection for her system, nor do any of her 
coworkers. None!
When you mention this to her, she tells you that her boss never really saw the point of spending 
money on surge protectors, uninterruptible power supplies, or any of “that stuff.” With a straight face, 
she asks, “Do those things really do any good?”
Now it’s your task to sell the boss on the idea of power protection. To do this, you must explain the 
types of power problems that lurk in the bushes just waiting to pounce on unwary users without power 
protection, and suggest precautions that they can take to prevent power-related damage.

As the primary storage area for the operating system, applications, 
and vital data, the hard drive takes on a level of importance to PC users 
that borders on reverence. Considering the fact that the death of a drive 
can mean many hours or days of tediously rebuilding your OS install, 
reloading applications, and re-creating data, such strong feelings make 
sense. And that reverence can turn quickly to agony if the user hasn’t 
backed up his or her data in a while when the hard drive dies!
Every tech must know how to connect, conﬁgure, maintain, and 
troubleshoot hard drives of all types. A fully operational drive requires 
proper hardware setup and installation, CMOS conﬁguration, and software 
setup (usually performed by tools that come with the operating system). 
The ﬁrst few labs in this chapter cover physical installation and CMOS 
conﬁguration of the mainstream hard drive technology, namely Integrated 
Drive Electronics (IDE), in both parallel and serial ﬂavors, and solid-state 
drives (SSDs). You will then conduct research on the developments of the 
rapidly changing Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI), primarily used 
for large, fault-tolerant data storage. The next exercise will have you 
troubleshoot installations, and ﬁnally you’ll install additional hard drives 
in preparation for an exercise in the next chapter. You’ll work with the 
software aspects of all hard drives—partitioning, formatting, and running 
drive utilities—in Chapter 12.

Lab Exercise 11.01: Installing Parallel ATA Hard Drives
The local nonproﬁt organization where you volunteer has received a donation of ten used PCs. Most of 
them have tiny hard drives, so they need an upgrade before you can distribute them to the various workers 
at the agency. All of the motherboards have built-in parallel ATA (PATA) controllers; some even have the 
better ATA/100 controllers. Your boss breaks out a stack of donated hard drives and tells you to get to work!

Lab Exercise 11.01: Installing Parallel ATA Hard Drives
199
Installing a PATA hard drive successfully requires little more than connecting data and power cables 
to the drive and plugging the other end of the data cable into the motherboard. Sounds simple enough 
on the surface, but because all PATA drives give you options to install two on each motherboard controller, 
unwary techs get tripped up here. This lab walks you through the physical installation of the hard drive.
✔ Hint
As you know from Chapter 11 of your textbook, IDE drives have several names that techs use 
pretty much interchangeably: IDE, EIDE, and ATA. You’ll see all three terms in this lab manual 
and on the CompTIA A+ Certiﬁcation exams. Except for discussions of very old technology, the 
terms describe the same type of hard drive today.
Learning Objectives
In this lab exercise, you’ll identify the different components of PATA hard drives and cables and learn 
installation procedures.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Remove a hard drive safely and correctly
• 
Describe PATA cables and connectors
• 
Describe the geometry of a hard drive

Getting Down to Business
Grab your handy screwdriver and anti-static wrist strap; it’s time to remove a hard drive! As in previous 
labs, if you are using the disassembled, non-production PC for this lab, you have already removed the hard 
drives, optical drive, and ﬂoppy drive (if present). You should gather together the drives you removed from 
the system, along with all associated cables and mounting hardware, to facilitate their reinstallation at the 
end of this exercise. The following removal instructions are included for clariﬁcation; however, you will 
use the drives and cables to work through the identiﬁcation steps that follow.
Step 1 Shut down your system and remove the system cover, following proper electrostatic discharge 
(ESD) avoidance procedures.
Step 2 Disconnect all the ribbon cables from the hard drives and optical drives, but ﬁrst note which 
device is connected to which cable and where the orientation stripe is located on each device. Be 
careful but ﬁrm. Grasp the cable as closely as possible to the connector on the drive and pull, rocking 
the connector gently from side to side. 
Examine the connector on the end of the ribbon cable. Use Figure 11-1 to help you.
How many holes does your connector have for pins? ______________________________________
 Are any of the holes in your connector ﬁlled in? Does your connector have a raised portion on one 
side so that it only ﬁts one way? In other words, is it keyed? _______________________________
Take a close look at the top connector in Figure 11-1.
How many connectors are on your ribbon cable? _________________________________________
Do you have a 40-wire or 80-wire ribbon cable? __________________________________________
Disconnect the power supply from all of the PATA devices by unplugging the Molex connector from 
each one.

✖ Warning
Molex plugs can be difﬁcult to remove and brutal on the ﬁngers. Little “bumps” on each side of 
the plug enable you to rock the plug back and forth to remove it.
✔ Hint
You will explore removable storage devices (CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, USB thumb drives, ﬂoppy drives) 
and associated media in Chapter 13.
Step 3 Now look at the motherboard connections, and note the orientation of the cable connectors. 
Disconnect the ribbon cables from the motherboard. Be careful but ﬁrm. Grasp the cable as closely as 
possible to the connector on the motherboard and pull, rocking the connector gently from side to side. 
Lay the cables aside for later reinstallation.
Step 4 Look at the PATA connections on your motherboard; they may be labeled “IDE” (see Figure 11-2).
How many PATA controllers do you see on your motherboard? _______________________________
 Look closely at your motherboard and see if you can ﬁnd writing on the board next to the 
IDE connections. Are the interfaces grouped into pairs? Are any of them dedicated to special 
conﬁgurations such as RAID? _______________________________________________________
What color are the IDE connections on the motherboard? __________________________________

Step 5 Remove a hard drive from the system. Be careful to note the type of screws you removed and 
store them for safekeeping. Also be sure to use proper ESD avoidance procedures when removing the 
drive from your system.
Because of the variety of cases, caddies, bays, slots, and so on, it’s not possible to give detailed 
instructions on how to remove the drive from your particular system. Look closely for caddy releases or 
retaining screws. Close inspection and a little logic will usually make it clear how to remove the drive. 
Make notes of how the drive comes out, as you’ll have to reinstall it later.
Step 6 With the hard drive out of the system and on a static-free surface, ground yourself, pick up 
the drive, and examine it carefully.
Note its dimensions. It should measure about 6" × 3.5" × 1". Some drives may be larger than this, 
measuring 6" × 5.25" × 1"—these are known as bigfoot drives. Some drives are smaller, but those are used 
mostly in laptops.
Look at the largest surfaces of the drive (the top and bottom). The bottom is where the printed circuit 
board with a ROM chip is located. This circuitry is the hard drive controller. The top side of the drive 
normally has a label or another means of listing the speciﬁcations for the drive, but this is not always 
the case.
Write down all the information on the label. Be sure to include the manufacturer and the model 
number for future reference.
Usually the label lists the total capacity of the hard drive and the power requirements of the drive 
(voltage and current). On older drives, the label lists the three main measurements of hard drive geometry: 
the number of cylinders, the number of heads, and the number of sectors per track. Together these 
measurements may be listed simply as CHS.
✔ Cross-Reference
For more information about CHS, refer to the “Geometry” section in Chapter 11 of Mike Meyers’ 
CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Using these three measurements, you can calculate the capacity of the hard drive. The formula is 
cylinders × heads × sectors per track × 512 = bytes of data. (The number of bytes in one sector is 512.)
For example, an older drive has the following information on the label. What is the total capacity of 
this drive?
• 
C = 859
• 
H = 16
• 
S = 63

Lab Exercise 11.01: Installing Parallel ATA Hard Drives
203
859 × 16 × 63 × 512 = 443,326,464 bytes
To convert this to megabytes, divide the answer by 1,048,576, as shown here:
443,326,464 / 1,048,576 = 422.8 MB
A Seagate ST310211A PATA hard drive has CHS values of 16383, 16, and 63. What is its total capacity in
Bytes: ______________
Megabytes: __________
Gigabytes: ___________
(To convert from megabytes to gigabytes, divide the number of megabytes by 1024.)
Step 7 Look at the end of the drive where the ribbon cable connects. Find the markings for where 
pin 1 of the ribbon cable should go.
Is it closer to the center (near the power connector), or to the side, of the drive? _______________
Does your hard drive have jumpers like the ones in Figure 11-3? _____________________________
Notice that the drive in Figure 11-3 has the jumper set to CS (which stands for cable select).
Each PC system that boots from a PATA hard drive should have the hard drive located on the ﬁrst 
PATA interface (IDE1). Normally the jumper must be set to Master so that the system can recognize it 
as the boot drive. A second drive (hard drive or optical drive) can be on the same cable, but must be set 
to Slave.
How are the jumpers set on your hard drive? ________________________
How are the jumpers set on your optical drive? ______________________
Can you have two master drives in the system? ______________________
Figure 11-3 Locating the PATA hard drive jumper setting

Chapter 11: Hard Drive Technologies
204
For the purposes of this exercise, make sure you leave your hard drive jumpered as it was when you 
removed it.
Step 8 Locate a broken hard drive (if you’re in a class, ask your instructor for one) and remove its cover.
✖ Warning
Never remove the cover from a functioning hard drive! Hard drives are extremely sensitive, so 
merely exposing the inside to the air will cause irreparable damage.
Notice the round polished platters that spin in the middle of the drive. This is where the data is 
stored magnetically.
The actuator arms that move across the platters have tiny coils of wire attached to their ends. These 
coils hold the read/write heads.
How many surfaces does your sample drive have (one platter = two surfaces)? _____________
How many physical heads does your sample drive have? _____________
Both answers are most likely the same because usually there is a read/write head for each surface.
Look at Figure 11-4 and identify the following parts by number.
Read/write heads ____________
Platters ____________________

the Molex power connectors.
Leave the system case off until you verify that everything works properly.
If you used a working machine for the prior steps, you can verify that you’ve reinstalled the drives 
correctly by going to the next major step in the process of hard drive installation: CMOS conﬁguration. 
Lab Exercise 11.03 in this chapter covers the CMOS details, but if you just can’t wait, try Step 10. This 
bonus step should work on newer motherboard models.
Step 10 Turn on the system and wait for it to boot to the desktop. Double-click the My Computer/
Computer icon, and conﬁrm that the icons for the reinstalled drives are displayed. The fact that you 
were able to get to the desktop conﬁrms that you’ve reinstalled the boot drive correctly, but do the 
other drives (if you have them) and your optical drive work?
✔ Hint
If you cannot boot the system or the optical drive does not work, the ﬁrst and obvious place to 
start is to verify all the cable connections. Any kind of disk errors at this time were most likely 
caused by the technician; after all, it worked before you touched it!

Lab Exercise 11.02: Installing Serial ATA Hard Drives
A wealthy donor has just given your nonproﬁt organization a dozen brand-new desktop machines. Since 
these are new machines, their motherboards have built-in serial ATA (SATA) controllers, but the SATA hard 
drives have yet to be installed or conﬁgured. You’re tasked to do the job!
Installing SATA hard drives is a simple matter of plugging in the data and power cables to the drive 
and attaching the other end of the data cable to the SATA controller card or motherboard connection. 
You don’t have to pull the power from the PC. You don’t even have to shut down Windows. No, really—
it’s that simple! Let’s go through the steps.
Learning Objectives
This lab is designed to introduce you to the two current ﬂavors of SATA and walk you through the 
straightforward installation. 
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Explain key features of SATA I and SATA II
• 
Install a SATA hard drive
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A newer PC system with an onboard SATA I or SATA II controller and Windows installed
• 
At least one additional SATA hard drive
• 
Optional: A PCI SATA controller may be installed into an older PC system
Getting Down to Business
To start, you’ll review the features and speciﬁcations of SATA, and then you’ll compare and contrast the 
technology with PATA. Keep that screwdriver handy, because you’ll ﬁnish with the installation and 
hot-swap of a SATA drive.
✔ Cross-Reference
To help in answering the following questions, reference the “ATA-7” section in Chapter 11 of Mike 
Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.

Lab Exercise 11.02: Installing Serial ATA Hard Drives
207
Step 1 Using your reference materials, review the features and speciﬁcations of SATA hard drive 
technology. Then answer these questions:
What is the speed of data transfer with ATA/133 drives? __________________________
What is the speed of data transfer with SATA I (SATA 1.5Gb) drives? _________________
What is the speed of data transfer with SATA II (SATA 3Gb) drives? _________________
What is the maximum length of a SATA cable? _________________________________
How many wires are in a SATA cable? ________________________________________
What is the maximum length of an 80-wire PATA cable? __________________________
How many drives can a single SATA cable support? ______________________________
SATA RAID has waltzed into the mainstream today. Motherboards are now being sold with a SATA 
RAID controller built-in, from Promise or another company, but you can also readily buy a PCIe or PCI 
SATA RAID controller at your local computer parts store. You’ll install additional hard drives in Lab 
Exercise 11.06, and you’ll explore the implementation of a software RAID solution in Chapter 12.
Step 2 It’s time to get working with some SATA drives. Shut down your system and remove the 
system cover, following proper ESD avoidance procedures.
Step 3 Disconnect the data cable(s) from the SATA hard drive(s), as shown in Figure 11-6. Grasp the 
cable as closely as possible to the connector on the drive and pull, rocking the connector gently from 
side to side.
Disconnect the power supply from the SATA drive(s) by unplugging the SATA connector from each 
one. Is the power supply a newer model with SATA connectors directly attached, or is there a Molex-to-
SATA power adapter like the one shown in Figure 11-7?
Figure 11-6 Removing the SATA data cable

Chapter 11: Hard Drive Technologies
208
Step 4 Now look at the motherboard connections and note the orientation of the connectors. 
Disconnect the data cables from the motherboard, being careful but ﬁrm. Grasp the cable as closely as 
possible to the connector on the motherboard and pull, rocking the connector gently from side to side.
Lay the cables aside for later reinstallation.
Step 5 Look at the SATA connections on your motherboard (see Figure 11-8).
How many SATA connectors do you see on your motherboard? ______________________________
Look closely at your motherboard, and see if you can ﬁnd writing on the board next to the SATA connectors.
 Are the interfaces grouped into pairs? Are any of them dedicated to special conﬁgurations such as RAID? 
__________________________________________________________________________________
Step 6 As in the previous exercise, remove the hard drive from the system, note the type of screws 
you removed, and store the screws for safekeeping. Be sure to use proper ESD procedures when removing 
the drive from your system.
Figure 11-7 Molex-to-SATA power adapter

Lab Exercise 11.02: Installing Serial ATA Hard Drives
209
Because of the variety of cases, caddies, bays, slots, and so on, it’s not possible to give detailed 
instructions on how to remove the drive from your particular system. Look closely for caddy releases or 
retaining screws. Close inspection and a little logic will usually make it clear how to remove the drive. 
Make notes of how the drive comes out; you’ll have to reinstall it later.
Step 7 With the hard drive out of the system and on a static-free surface, ground yourself, pick up 
the drive, and examine it carefully.
Note its dimensions; it should measure about 6" × 3.5" × 1", the same as a PATA drive. Here, too, the 
bottom of the drive boasts the hard drive controller, and the top of the drive is normally labeled with 
the drive’s speciﬁcations.
Write down all the information on the label. Be sure to include the manufacturer and the model 
number for future reference.
Step 8 To demonstrate one of the beneﬁts of SATA—hot-swapping—you will now reinstall all the 
drives you removed and, if necessary, install an additional SATA drive to be hot-swapped. With the PC 
still powered down, insert all of the original drives back into your system, and at least one additional 
SATA drive with no critical data. Secure the drives with the proper screws, connect all the data cables, 
and connect the SATA power connectors using Molex-to-SATA adapters if required.
Leave the system case off, to verify that everything is working properly and to facilitate the last steps.
✔ Hint
If you are performing this lab using a PCIe or PCI SATA controller card, you’ll have to install the 
expansion card and load the drivers for the card. If you haven’t loaded drivers for the SATA 
controller, you should do so now. Otherwise, this is going to be a very frustrating lab for you!
Figure 11-8 The SATA connectors on a motherboard

Chapter 11: Hard Drive Technologies
210
Power up the PC and boot into Windows. Windows should pick up the drive(s) with no problems at 
all. Check My Computer/Computer to verify that the drive is installed and functional. If the drive has 
no partition, then of course it won’t show up in My Computer/Computer; if this is the case, you can use 
the Computer Management console to verify that the drive works.
Step 9 With Windows still running, disconnect the SATA data cable from the additional drive. What 
happened? __________________________________________________________________________
Step 10 Plug the data cable back in. Does Windows see the drive? _____________________________
Step 11 Try the same hot-swap test with the SATA power cable—unplug it, then plug it back in. Does 
this produce the same effect as the hot-swap with the data cable?
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 11.03: Conﬁguring CMOS Settings
After installing either PATA or SATA devices, the second step you’ll want to perform is the conﬁguration of 
the BIOS to support these devices. On most motherboards, the BIOS automatically detects devices, so you 
will primarily be conﬁrming the detection of all the devices and conﬁguring advanced features such as 
RAID, S.M.A.R.T., and boot options. Autodetection does not render CMOS irrelevant, though; you can do 
or undo all kinds of problems relating to hard drives using CMOS setup. This lab walks you through the 
important conﬁguration options.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Conﬁgure the CMOS settings for the hard drive
• 
Conﬁrm that the hard drive is indeed installed properly
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A fully functioning PC with PATA and/or SATA devices installed
• 
Optional: A second drive with no important data
Getting Down to Business
There are many possible CMOS settings for the hard drive, depending on the BIOS installed on the 
motherboard. For example, every motherboard gives you the option to disable the built-in hard drive 
controllers. Why is this relevant? You can install a drive into a perfectly good system, but it won’t work if 
the controllers are disabled!

Lab Exercise 11.03: Conﬁ guring CMOS Settings
211
Step 1 Turn on your system, and enter the CMOS setup utility by pressing the appropriate key(s) 
while your system is booting.
Select the Integrated Peripherals option from the main menu, or the Drive Conﬁguration option 
from the Advanced menu (you may have to hunt around for where you enable the PATA/SATA devices 
in your CMOS setup program), and look for the various controllers. You can enable or disable the 
controllers here.
✔ Hint
This option may look somewhat different depending on the version of CMOS you are using. Look 
for a menu option such as one of these:
• 
Onboard Primary PCI IDE
• 
Onboard Secondary PCI IDE
• 
PCI Primary and Secondary IDE
• 
Onboard IDE
• 
Use Automatic Mode
• 
SATA Port 0
When the controllers are disabled in CMOS, no device attached to them can be used—not even optical 
drives. This is why some systems will not let you disable the controllers at all.
If you are performing the labs in sequence, and have arrived at this lab directly from Lab Exercise 
11.01 or Lab Exercise 11.02, here’s where you ﬁnd out whether or not you installed and jumpered the 
drive correctly.
Make sure all controllers are enabled, and then look for the Autodetection option in the CMOS settings. 
Older systems have a separate category in CMOS, appropriately named Autodetect or something similar; 
newer systems have it integrated into the main settings screen. Run this utility now. If your hard drive 
shows up in Autodetect as the drive you thought it would be—primary master, secondary master, SATA 
Port 0, or what have you—then you installed and (if necessary) jumpered it properly (see Figure 11-9).
Step 2 Save your settings, exit CMOS, and reboot your PC. You should boot into Windows normally. 
Check My Computer/Computer to verify that you can see and access all drives.
Step 3 Reboot your PC and go into CMOS. Access the settings to enable or disable the various 
controllers, and disable them all. (This won’t affect your data; it will just prevent drive access for the 
next couple of steps in this lab.)

Chapter 11: Hard Drive Technologies
212
Step 4 Save your settings, then exit CMOS to reboot the system. Making sure there is no ﬂoppy disk 
in the ﬂoppy drive, reboot normally and watch the monitor display for messages.
What message is displayed last? ______________________________________________________
With most systems, the PC searches its various storage devices for a way to boot. It looks for a 
bootable drive (connected to an EIDE, SATA, or SCSI controller), a bootable optical or ﬂoppy disk, or 
a network connection—not necessarily in that order—and then stops if it cannot ﬁnd the operating 
system. It then displays a message indicating “no bootable device” and waits for your instructions to 
continue.
✖ Warning
If your system is connected to a network and uses the network boot option, disconnect the network 
cable for this exercise to get the desired results. Be sure to plug the network cable back in when 
ﬁnished.
When the system is not able to ﬁnd a disk (because you disabled the controller), it will probably hang 
for a long period of time and then return a Primary Hard Drive Failure code or error message. Some systems 
try to recognize that you have a hard drive regardless of the disabling of features, but this is rare.
Okay, so the system can’t ﬁnd your hard drive. You obviously know why—you turned off the controller!
Step 5 Reboot your system, entering the CMOS setup utility by pressing the appropriate keystroke 
combination while your system is booting. Navigate to the menu where you disabled all of the controllers 
and reenable them.
Figure 11-9 Various drives and their roles as listed in CMOS setup

Lab Exercise 11.04: Comparing Solid-State Drives and Magnetic Hard Drives
213
Step 6 Now that the controllers are enabled, go back to the Autodetection utility and look for any 
drives connected.
If Autodetection still does not see a hard drive, save your settings, reboot your system, and reenter 
the CMOS setup utility. Then try it again.
Do you now see all of the storage devices that are installed in the system?
Step 7 While you’re still in CMOS, navigate to the menu where all of the storage devices can be 
conﬁgured. Use this screen (sometimes there are multiple screens) to examine the device settings and 
answer the following questions:
 Are there any devices listed as ATA/IDE devices (Primary Master, Primary Slave, Secondary Master, 
or Secondary Slave)? ______________________________________________________________
 Are there any SATA controllers present? If yes, are there any SATA devices installed on the system 
(SATA Port 0, SATA Port 1, and so on)? _________________________________________________
 Is the motherboard capable of implementing RAID? If yes, how is it currently conﬁgured?  
_______________________________________________________________________________
Exit CMOS without saving changes and let the PC reboot.
Step 8 At this point, if you did everything as described and if you started with a known good hard 
drive containing a working operating system, the system will boot back into the operating system. 
Otherwise, you’ll have to wait until you partition and format the drive to see if everything’s working 
as it should (for example, if your instructor gave you, to use, a demo hard drive with nothing on it).

Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.

Lab Exercise 11.04: Comparing Solid-State  
Drives and Magnetic Hard Drives
PATA and SATA hard disk drives store data magnetically and have moving parts, but solid-state drives (SSDs) 
store data on dynamic RAM (DRAM) or ﬂash memory boards and have no moving parts. In other words, 
SSDs use nonvolatile memory—memory that retains data even when it’s not powered on—to store data 
and emulate a hard drive. Most common uses have been in what are called ﬂash drives or thumb drives, 

Chapter 11: Hard Drive Technologies
214
but now PC users are installing SSDs as their primary storage in desktops and laptops. SSDs have no moving 
parts, which makes them tougher, quieter, and oftentimes faster than hard disks.
Learning Objectives
This lab explores the differences between solid-state drives and magnetic hard drives and is designed to 
help you recommend drives to clients as the need arises.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Explain solid-state drives
• 
Explain magnetic hard drives
• 
Discern which one will be best for your clients
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Access to a PC system and the Internet
• 
A solid-state drive and a magnetic hard drive
Getting Down to Business
It’s so cool to see how technology has changed over the years and migrated to smaller, less noisy equipment. 
Heck, I remember when we used to have to park the heads to move a hard drive, and now we just pull them 
out and put them in our pocket—what will they think of next?
In this scenario, your boss is not convinced that SSDs are all that great, so your job is to explain why 
you think SSDs are better than magnetic hard drives.
Step 1 Search the Internet for “solid-state drives.” Use manufacturer and retailer Web sites to ﬁnd 
the information listed in the following table. Record your ﬁndings.

Lab Exercise 11.05: Exploring SCSI and RAID
As you inventory the machines that were just donated to your nonproﬁt organization, you discover two 
additional machines with small computer system interface (SCSI) controllers. You want to use them in 
a RAID array, but don’t know much about either technology.
Learning Objectives
This lab touches on important tech skills, helping you research hardware so you can provide good 
information to clients. With the introduction of the SATA interface, the need for SCSI implementation on 
desktop machines is quickly fading. However, SCSI—which is well over 20 years old—still rules the hot-
swappable, large-capacity, data server environment.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Explain key features of SCSI
• 
Deﬁne the levels of RAID

• 
A notepad and pen to take notes at the store
Getting Down to Business
Limber up your surﬁng ﬁngers, as you’ll start your search on the Internet. Then you might want to make a 
visit to the local computer store to explore further how the technologies of SCSI and RAID are being used in 
today’s computing environments.
Step 1 Access the Internet and search for information on parallel SCSI devices, primarily hard drives. 
Use keywords such as Ultra320, Ultra640, white paper, controllers, and storage solutions. Then answer the 
following questions:
What speed of data transfer can be achieved with parallel SCSI? __________________________
How many drives can be attached to a single controller? ________________________________
What is the price range of parallel SCSI drives? _______________________________________
What is a SCSI chain? ___________________________________________________________
✔ Cross-Reference
For more information on SCSI, refer to the “SCSI: Still Around” section in Chapter 11 of Mike 
Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Step 2 As you surfed around to the different sites on SCSI, you probably noticed that many of these 
drives are implemented in different RAID conﬁgurations. With the overall cost of hard drives dropping, 
many desktop motherboard manufacturers (ASUS, Gigabyte, Intel, and so on) are incorporating RAID 
controllers into their motherboards. Visit a few of the motherboard manufacturers’ Web sites and 
research their implementation of RAID. Use the following questions to reﬁne your focus.
✔ Cross-Reference
For more information on RAID, refer to the “Protecting Data with RAID,” “RAID,” and 
“Implementing RAID” sections in Chapter 11 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and

Lab Exercise 11.06: Troubleshooting  
Hard Drive Installations
The newest tech in your ofﬁce has had trouble installing hard drives properly. In fact, he’s tried it on four 
different machines with eight different drives and succeeded only once! You’ve been tasked to troubleshoot 
his failed installations and patiently explain the proper installation process to him. What fun!
Learning Objectives
This lab walks you through the errors new techs typically make on hard drive installation, particularly 
with PATA drives. The lab also addresses the main problems with SATA drives—usually faulty hardware—
and how to address this in the ﬁeld.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Troubleshoot hard drive installation problems effectively
• 
Explain the proper installation techniques for PATA and SATA drives
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Access to a PC system with PATA and SATA interfaces
• 
At least one PATA or SATA hard drive (preferably two or more)

Chapter 11: Hard Drive Technologies
218
Getting Down to Business
It might seem odd to mess up a hard drive installation deliberately, but you can’t hurt anything, so give 
it a whirl. Seeing how the PC responds to mistakes when you know speciﬁcally what’s wrong can help you 
when you run into similar situations later in the ﬁeld.
Step 1 You must have a properly functioning PC for this lab to be effective, so verify ﬁrst that you 
have a system up and running with one or more hard drives installed.
Step 2 Power down the system. Disconnect the data cable for the hard drive used to boot the system, 
then power up the system. What happens? Will the PC autodetect the drive?
It is difﬁcult to imagine not connecting the data cables to hard drives, but many times to add RAM 
or new devices, we have to disconnect the cables to gain access to the component. It is easy to miss 
reconnecting one of the cables after installing the new device.
Disconnecting the cable also simulates a broken IDE or SATA cable. These cables are somewhat delicate, 
and can fail after a sharp crease or a crimp from the system case. If you’re having unexplained problems 
with your drive, check the cables prior to replacing the drive.
Step 3 Power down the PC and put the cable back on properly.
Step 4 On a PATA drive, change the jumper for the primary master hard drive to slave, and then 
power on the PC. What happens? Will the PC autodetect the drive? How should the jumper be installed?
Step 5 Power down the PC and put the jumper back on properly.
Step 6 Install a second PATA drive onto the primary controller, and set the jumpers on both drives 
incorrectly. Try variations: both as master; both as standalone; both as slave; both as cable select. Power 
on the PC and test each variation. What happens? Will the PC autodetect the drives? How should the 
jumpers be set for two PATA drives to work properly on the same controller?

Lab Exercise 11.07: Installing Multiple  
Hard Drives in Preparation for RAID
Remember those two extra machines you discovered—the ones with the dual CPUs and the SCSI 
controllers? Well, each of them has eight 150-GB SCSI hard drives ready to be installed. You haven’t had 
the opportunity to conﬁgure a RAID system before, so you ask a colleague for advice. She recommends that 
you install some additional drives in one of the workstations and then practice conﬁguring RAID 0 using 
the software solution that comes with Microsoft Windows. This should help build your conﬁdence before 
tackling the hardware RAID controllers on the servers.

Lab Exercise 11.07: Installing Multiple Hard Drives in Preparation for RAID
219
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will install additional hard drives—PATA, SATA, or both—in an existing system. You will 
access CMOS to verify that all of the drives have been recognized by the system. You will then set the 
system aside to be used in Lab Exercise 12.05, “Implementing Software RAID 0 with Disk Management,” in 
Chapter 12.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Install multiple hard drives in computer systems
• 
Verify multiple drives in CMOS
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC with PATA or SATA interfaces and Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, 
Windows XP Professional, or Windows Vista installed
• 
At least two additional, system-compatible hard drives—PATA or SATA as appropriate
Getting Down to Business
Even though you haven’t been reminded during the last few exercises, you know that you should always 
take the proper anti-static precautions when opening the system case and working with the delicate 
components inside. Take those precautions now, and get ready to install a few extra hard drives into your 
system. In this exercise, you’ll make sure these drives are recognized by the system; in the next chapter’s 
labs, you’ll conﬁgure them.
✔ Hint
For many of the exercises in the next chapter, it is very important that you have a working 
system with either Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP Professional, or Windows Vista 
installed. Obviously, you will need to keep the system partition and boot partition intact 
(usually these are the same partition, and are the ﬁrst partition on the ﬁrst hard drive of 
the system) with the operating system running. 
Even if you have available space on the ﬁrst hard drive, it is much cleaner if you can install at 
least two additional hard drives. That way, you can partition, format, and convert to dynamic 
disks to your heart’s content, without the worry of losing data (or the operating system).

Chapter 11: Hard Drive Technologies
220
Follow these steps to install an additional PATA drive.
Step 1 Determine on which controller, and in which order, you will be installing the drives.
Step 2 Set the jumpers properly for both the master and slave drives. (Usually, the boot device is the 
master drive on the primary controller, whereas the optical drive is the master drive on the secondary 
controller, so the new drive is likely to be a slave to one of those drives.)
Step 3 Physically install the second drive, connecting the power and data cables properly.
Follow these steps to install additional SATA drives.
Step 1 Determine which controller you will use for the ﬁrst additional drive and connect the SATA 
data cable to the controller on the motherboard.
Step 2 Physically install the ﬁrst additional drive and connect the SATA power and data cables to the 
new drive.
Step 3 Determine which controller you will use for the second additional drive and connect the SATA 
data cable to the controller on the motherboard.
Step 4 Physically install the second additional drive and connect the SATA power and data cables to 
the new drive.
Follow these steps to verify the drives in CMOS.
Step 1 After installing all of the hard drives, plug the power back in and boot the machine.
Step 2 Press the appropriate key(s) to enter CMOS setup, and navigate to the conﬁguration screen for 
installed devices.
Step 3 Perform autodetection if required, and conﬁrm that all of the installed devices are present. If 
any of the devices are missing (and you remembered to reboot the machine if your system requires it), 
power the machine down, disconnect the power, and double-check all of the cables and drive settings.

Once you’ve installed a new drive on a PC and it has been recognized 
by the system, you have two more steps to complete before you can start 
storing data: partitioning and formatting.
✔ Hint
The tasks of partitioning and formatting have really become automated into the installation of 
the operating system (and the tools included in the operating system). Many of the steps are 
now completed in sequence, blurring the line between partitioning and formatting. Make sure 
you’re clear on the distinction between partitioning and formatting, because you must do them 
in the proper order. Partitioning the disk simply means deﬁning physical sections that are used 
to store data. Formatting the disk means conﬁguring the partition with a ﬁle system.
In the early days of DOS, Windows 3.x, and Windows 9x, your hard drive had to be partitioned and 
formatted before you could run the installation setup routine. Windows now incorporates these disk-
preparation steps into the installation routine itself. However, it’s still important for you to be able to 
perform these tasks from scratch as part of your basic PC tech repertoire.
You have a number of tools at your disposal for performing partitioning and formatting tasks. If 
you are working with a fresh hard drive, you need to get to these tools without necessarily having an 
operating system installed (this may be the ﬁrst disk in the system, and you are preparing it for the 
OS installation). The ﬁrst of these tools is the Windows installation media. Also, a number of third-
party utilities are available for partitioning and formatting, such as  Avanquest’s Partition Commander, 
Easeus Partition Master, and the open source Linux tool Gnome Partition Editor, affectionately known 
as GParted. These speciﬁc tools are beyond the scope of the CompTIA A+ exams; however, a good tech 
should develop skills in the use of these tools. The second tool you’ll explore in this chapter is a live CD 
of GParted.
Once you have an operating system up and running, you should have some type of partitioning and 
formatting tool that you can run from the GUI. Windows uses a tool known as the Disk Management 
utility. Disk Management enables you to create, modify, and format partitions. You can also format 
partitions from within My Computer/Computer on the Windows desktop.
After looking at how to create and format partitions using the Windows installation media and 
the live CD of GParted, you’ll start up Windows to look at how to accomplish these tasks using the 
built-in tools. Next, you’ll use the Disk Management utility to convert basic disks to dynamic disks and 
implement a RAID 0 stripe set. Then you’ll look at the procedures for performing regular hard drive 
maintenance and troubleshooting tasks.

Lab Exercise 12.01: Creating and Formatting Partitions with Windows 2000/XP and Vista/7

✔ Hint
The following exercises walk you through the basic management of hard drive storage available 
on your system. If you have only one drive installed, you will need to install the operating 
system after the ﬁrst few exercises to perform the later exercises. In Lab Exercise 11.07, you 
installed two additional hard drives into a machine with Windows installed. I recommend 
that you use this machine for all of the implementation labs (being careful not to partition 
or format the ﬁrst drive, which should contain the operating system). Not only will this 
enable you to practice creating and deleting partitions and formatting and reformatting 
those partitions, it will also enable you to verify the partitions and ﬁle systems with the Disk 
Management tool in Windows.

Lab Exercise 12.01: Creating and Formatting 
Partitions with the Windows 2000/XP and Vista/7 
Installation Media
As you’ll recall from the labs in Chapter 11, you have just worked with a number of donated machines, 
physically installing and conﬁguring multiple hard drive technologies, primarily PATA and SATA hard 
drives. Once these drives have been recognized in CMOS, you are only halfway to your goal of using the 
drives for data storage. You must now partition each drive into usable space (even if only one partition 
uses all of the available drive space) and then format each partition with a ﬁle system.
In this lab, you will use the Windows installation media to partition and format hard drives in your 
system. You will be left with blank partitions, one of which needs an operating system. In the labs for 
Chapter 14, you will complete the process of installing the operating system.
✔ Cross-Reference
For details about partitioning and formatting drives with the Windows installation disc, refer 
to the “Partitioning and Formatting with the Windows XP Installation CD” and “Partitioning 
and Formatting with the Windows Vista Installation DVD” sections in Chapter 12 of Mike Meyers’ 
CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.

Chapter 12: Implementing Hard Drives

Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll use the Windows installation media to partition a hard drive and format the 
partition for use.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Set up a primary partition on a hard drive
• 
Format the partition with the NTFS ﬁle system
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are 
• 
The PC from Lab Exercise 11.07 with a primary hard drive that holds your Windows OS, and 
the two blank hard drives that you can partition and format to your heart’s content
• 
Optional: A system with one hard drive that you can safely erase
• 
The Windows 2000/XP or Vista/7 installation media
✖ Warning
Partitioning and formatting a hard drive destroys any data on it! Practice this lab using only 
drives that don’t store any data you need.
Getting Down to Business
In this exercise, you’ll start the system by booting from the Windows installation media (you will have to 
conﬁgure your system CMOS to boot from the optical drive or, if available, a USB device). You’ll partition  
a portion of one of the hard drives and format it with the NTFS ﬁle system, as if you’re preparing to install 
the operating system.
The instructions for Windows 2000/XP are ﬁrst, followed immediately by the instructions for Windows 
Vista/7.
Step 1 Enter the CMOS setup program and conﬁgure the boot order, selecting the CD-ROM drive as the 
ﬁrst boot device. Also make sure that the setting called “Boot Other Device” (or something similar) is 
enabled; otherwise, your system may not recognize the CD-ROM drive as a bootable drive.
Step 2 Place the Windows installation CD in the optical drive tray and boot the machine. Windows 
Setup copies a number of ﬁles and then presents you with the screen shown in Figure 12-1. Press ENTER 
to set up Windows now.
Step 3 Press F8 to accept the license agreement and enter the main partitioning screen.

Lab Exercise 12.01: Creating and Formatting Partitions with Windows 2000/XP and Vista/7
227
✔ Hint
If you are using the machine conﬁgured in Lab Exercise 11.07, Windows XP has been installed 
on one of the drives in the system. Setup asks if you would like to repair this installation, 
and advises you to press ESC if you want to install a fresh copy. Press ESC to progress to the next 
step—partitioning the drive.
The screen displays the installed drives and any partitions and/or ﬁle systems that have been 
conﬁgured on the drives prior to this session (see Figure 12-2).
Step 4 If any partitions exist on the drives you have installed to practice this lab (and the data on 
these drives is expendable), delete them at this time.
To delete a partition, simply select the partition, press D to delete, and then press L to commit the 
delete process. The partition will be returned to unpartitioned space.
Step 5 To create a partition, follow these steps:
a. 
Press C.
b. 
Select the size of the partition you want to create (10 GB is a good size for a system partition or 
a boot partition, but you should try multiple sizes).
c. 
Press ENTER.
d. 
The new partition should appear in the partitioning screen.
Congratulations! You have created a partition.

Step 6 Press ENTER to see a list of ﬁle system options, as shown in Figure 12-3. Choose a ﬁle system 
(NTFS is the default) and indicate whether you will perform an exhaustive formatting process or the 
“Quick” formatting process.
Press ENTER. Windows formats the partition and proceeds with the operating system installation. 
You can shut down the PC once this step is completed.

Step 7 Reboot the machine and allow your Windows OS to boot. Then use the Disk Management tool 
to verify the partition(s) you have created with the installation CD. Alternatively, you can verify the 
partitions you created and the ﬁle systems you conﬁgured when you use the GParted tool in the next lab.
Step 8 Practice deleting, creating, and formatting different combinations of partitions and ﬁle 
systems to become comfortable with the tools used in this exercise. Have fun!
Here are the same instructions, but for Windows Vista/7.
Step 1 Enter the CMOS setup program and conﬁgure the boot order, selecting the optical drive (or, 
if necessary, a USB device) as the ﬁrst boot device. Also make sure that the setting called “Boot Other 
Device” (or something similar) is enabled; otherwise, your system may not recognize the optical drive 
as a bootable drive.
Step 2 Place the Windows installation media in the optical drive tray and boot the machine. Set your 
language and regional preferences on the ﬁrst screen, and then click Next.
Step 3 Click the large Install Now button on the next page. Setup will then ask for a product key, but 
you do not need to enter one right now. Click Next to move on.
Step 4 Pick the edition of Vista/7 you wish to install. Your product key will only activate the edition 
that you purchased. Click Next to continue, and then agree to the license agreement on the next page.
Step 5 Click the Custom install button on the following screen. The screen displays the installed 
drives and any partitions and/or ﬁle systems that have been conﬁgured on the drives prior to this 
session (see Figure 12-4).
Step 6 If any partitions exist on the drives you have installed to practice this lab (and the data on 
these drives is expendable), delete them at this time.
To delete a partition, simply select the partition, click Drive options (advanced), and then click 
Delete. The partition will be returned to unpartitioned space.
Step 7 To create a partition, follow these steps:
a. 
Click the Drive options (advanced) button.
b. 
Click New.
c. 
In the Size ﬁeld, type 50000 and click Apply to end up with a 50-GB partition.
Step 8 Click the Format button. The installer will automatically set up an NTFS ﬁle system for the 
partition and proceed with the operating system installation.
Step 9 Reboot the machine and allow your Windows OS to boot. Then use the Disk Management tool 
to verify the partition(s) you have created with the installation disc. Alternatively, you can verify the 
partitions you created and the ﬁle systems you conﬁgured when you try using the GParted tool in the 
next lab.
Step 10 Practice deleting, creating, and formatting different combinations of partitions and ﬁle 
systems to become comfortable with the tools used in this exercise. Enjoy!

Lab Exercise 12.02: Creating and Formatting 
Partitions with Gnome Partition Editor (GParted)
As a competent tech, you want to keep up with the newest methods for accomplishing old tasks. Using 
the donated computers as an example, you might want to partition and format all of the machines 
before installing an operating system and deploying the machines to users. To accomplish this task, 
it might be easier to use a standalone partitioning/formatting tool such as the open source Gnome 
Partition Editor (GParted). Gnome is one of the many versions of the Linux operating system. GParted 
uses a basic, bootable version of Gnome with disk management tools built in. This method is somewhat 
beyond the scope of the CompTIA A+ exams, but the skills and techniques you will practice in this lab 
are valuable to a real-world tech, and can help you gain a deeper understanding of partitioning and 
formatting hard drives.
Figure 12-4 Where do you want to install Windows?

Lab Exercise 12.02: Creating and Formatting Partitions with Gnome Partition Editor (GParted)

✔ Tech Tip
Many techs, and speciﬁcally techs employed by the IT departments of small to large businesses, 
often use one of the popular drive-imaging tools such as Symantec’s Norton Ghost. Drive 
imaging is used to roll out the operating system and applications on multiple machines 
expediently. This method creates the partition, and copies the OS, applications, and user 
proﬁles onto the ﬁle system that was used to make the image, all in one step. This method 
is also beyond the scope of the CompTIA A+ exams, but you should explore drive imaging for 
completeness.
In this exercise, you will use the live CD of GParted to partition and format the two additional hard 
drives installed in your lab system. If you are working in a classroom setting, the instructor should 
be able to provide copies of the GParted live CD to you for this exercise. Alternatively, you could jump 
ahead to Lab Exercise 13.05, where you will create a live CD by burning a CD with an ISO image.
✔ Cross-Reference
For additional details about the GParted live CD, refer to the “Third-Party Partition Tools” 
section in Chapter 12 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll use the GParted live CD to partition a hard drive and format the partition for use.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Set up primary and extended partitions on hard drives
• 
Format the partitions with various ﬁle systems
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
The PC from Lab Exercise 11.07 with a primary hard drive that holds your Windows OS, and the 
two blank hard drives that you can partition and format to your heart’s content
• 
Optional: A system with one hard drive that you can safely erase
• 
A GParted live CD
✖ Warning
Partitioning and formatting a hard drive destroys any data on the drive! Practice this lab only 
on drives that don’t store any data you need.

Chapter 12: Implementing Hard Drives
232
Getting Down to Business
In this exercise, you’ll start the system by booting from the GParted live CD. (You will have to conﬁgure 
your system CMOS to boot from the CD.) You’ll then partition a portion of one of the hard drives and 
format it with the ﬁle system of your choice.
Step 1 Enter the CMOS setup program and conﬁgure the boot order, selecting the CD-ROM drive as the 
ﬁrst boot device. Also make sure that the setting called “Boot Other Device” (or something similar) is 
enabled; otherwise, your system may not recognize the CD-ROM drive as a bootable drive.
Step 2 Place the GParted live CD in the optical drive tray and boot the machine. GParted displays an 
introduction screen, as shown in Figure 12-5. Press ENTER to boot; Gnome Linux should begin to load. As 
the system loads, you will be queried a number of times for settings related to boot options, language, 
keyboard, and screen depth and resolution. Unless told to do otherwise by your instructor, select the 
defaults for these settings by highlighting OK and pressing ENTER.
GParted should ﬁnish booting and arrive at a screen displaying various menu items, icons, and the 
current drive focus with strange Linux names such as /dev/hda1, /dev/hda3, and so forth. Notice the 
item at the far right of the menu bar; here, you can click the drop-down arrow to select which physical 
drive the GParted screen is focused on (see Figure 12-6).
Step 3 Now change the focus to the second or third drive installed on your system. This will probably 
be labeled /dev/hdb or /dev/hdc in the drop-down list of hard drives.
Figure 12-5 The Gnome Partition Editor initial screen

Lab Exercise 12.02: Creating and Formatting Partitions with Gnome Partition Editor (GParted)
233
✔ Hint
If you are using the machine that you conﬁgured in Lab Exercise 11.07, Windows has been 
installed on one of the drives in the system (most likely the ﬁrst drive). When GParted ﬁrst 
launches, the screen focus will be on this drive and the label will probably read /dev/hda1. 
Make sure that you use the menu drop-down list to select one of the drives that has been set up 
to be partitioned and formatted, or you’ll ﬁnd yourself reinstalling Windows.
The screen now focuses on the drive you’ve selected and shows any partitions and/or ﬁle systems 
that have been conﬁgured on that drive prior to this session. If any partitions are displayed, highlight 
the partition, right-click, and select Delete.
Step 4 GParted requires that you commit any changes that you make to the partitions on the disk, so 
after deleting the partition, you must click the Apply button to apply the settings and actually delete 
the partition.
When you click Apply, GParted applies the pending operations. You should now have a drive visible 
with all of the available space denoted as unallocated space.
Step 5 Select the unallocated space, right-click, and select New. Then follow these steps:
a. 
Enter the size of the partition in megabytes; either type a number or use the up and down 
arrows to select a size. For the purposes of practice, 4000 MB (4 GB) to 10,000 MB (10 GB) is  
a good size for the partition.
b. 
Select Primary Partition or Extended Partition; primary is a good choice for the initial 
partition on the drive.
c. 
Select the NTFS ﬁle system.
Figure 12-6 Selecting a drive on the main GParted partitioning/formatting screen

Chapter 12: Implementing Hard Drives
234
d. 
Click the Add button. The new partition with the formatted ﬁle system should appear on the 
screen.
e. 
Click Apply to create the formatted partition. A message box will pop up, asking you to conﬁrm 
that you want to apply the pending operations. Click Apply again, and then watch as the 
Applying pending operations dialog box appears, shows you the status of the operation, and 
then disappears.
f. 
Click Close.
Congratulations! You should now have a drive with a formatted partition visible in the main screen 
(see Figure 12-7).
Step 6 There is one last step, which depends on whether you plan to use this partition to boot the 
machine with an OS (active partition) and which ﬁle system you have selected.
With the partition highlighted, right-click the partition and select Manage Flags. A small window 
appears in which you’ll see a number of ﬂags that you can set (see Figure 12-8). Many of these apply to 
operating systems other than Windows, but one of them must be set if you are to use the partition in 
Windows: boot. This ﬂag must be set if the partition is to be the active partition in the system (this is 
usually the ﬁrst partition on the ﬁrst hard drive in the system).
Set the appropriate ﬂags for your partition and ﬁle system and close the Manage ﬂags window. 
Notice that you will not have to apply changes, as the settings take effect immediately.
Step 7 Reboot the machine and allow your Windows OS to boot. You can then use Disk Management 
to verify the partition(s) you have created with GParted.
Step 8 Practice deleting, creating, and formatting different combinations of partitions and ﬁle 
systems to become comfortable with the GParted program.

Lab Exercise 12.03: Using Windows Tools  
to Create and Format Partitions
Once you have all of the donated machines’ drives conﬁgured, partitioned, and formatted, and you’ve 
installed Windows, working with hard drive storage becomes much more intuitive. Windows includes 
tools that let you create, modify, and format partitions “on the ﬂy” from within Windows. One of these 
utilities is called Disk Management.
✔ Cross-Reference
For details about creating and formatting partitions using Disk Management, refer to the  
“Disk Management” section in Chapter 12 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and 
Troubleshooting PCs.

Chapter 12: Implementing Hard Drives
236
This lab exercise assumes that you want to create a partition on the second or third hard 
drive installed on the Windows lab system and then format that partition with a ﬁle system. Disk 
Management will enable you to format the partition right away; however, you can also use another 
Windows utility that you should be intimately familiar with by now: My Computer/Computer. Follow 
the steps in this lab exercise to create and format a new partition.
✔ Hint
Each version of Windows can read from and write to the FAT16, FAT32, and NTFS ﬁle systems. 
However, only Windows 2000/XP can be installed to a FAT16 or FAT32 partition—Windows 
Vista/7 must be installed on an NTFS partition.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll use the Disk Management program to partition a hard drive and format the 
partition with a ﬁle system.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Set up a primary, active partition on a hard drive
• 
Set up an extended partition and logical drives in that partition
• 
Format partitions with various ﬁle systems
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
The PC from Lab Exercise 11.07, with a primary hard drive that holds your Windows 
installation and the two blank hard drives that you can partition and format
✖ Warning
Partitioning a hard drive destroys any data on it! Practice this lab only on drives that don’t 
contain any data you need.
Getting Down to Business
The steps for partitioning drives and formatting partitions in each version of Windows are very similar.
Step 1 Right-click the My Computer/Computer icon and select Manage to open a Computer 
Management window. Under the Storage node, click Disk Management.

Lab Exercise 12.03: Using Windows Tools  to Create and Format Partitions
237
Step 2 As in prior lab exercises, if there are any existing partitions on the second or third drive, 
highlight the partitions and either right-click and delete the partitions or simply press DELETE.
Step 3 Start the process of creating a partition by right-clicking an unpartitioned section of drive 
space and, in 2000/XP, selecting New Partition (see Figure 12-9). In Vista/7, select New Simple Volume. 
This will start the New Partition Wizard or the New Simple Volume Wizard, depending on the OS.
Step 4 Click Next, and, in Windows 2000/XP, select Primary Partition (in Windows Vista/7, you 
will not have to select Primary Partition). At the next screen, enter the size of your new partition in 
megabytes.
Step 5 You can now assign a drive letter or mount the partition to an empty folder. For now, go with 
the default drive letter assignment and click Next again.
Step 6 The next screen offers you the option to format the new partition with a ﬁle system. Select a 
ﬁle system: FAT, FAT32, or NTFS. (Note that Windows will not allow Disk Management to create a FAT16 
partition larger than 4 GB or a FAT32 partition larger than 32 GB.) Then enter a volume label if you 
want and click OK. Figure 12-10 shows this selection screen in the Disk Management utility.
Step 7 The utility warns you that formatting will erase all data on the drive. Click OK to begin 
formatting.

Step 8 You can also format partitions in My Computer/Computer, but generally speaking you’ll use this 
method only to format removable media such as ﬂoppy disks, Zip disks, USB thumb drives, and so on.
Right-click a drive icon in My Computer/Computer and select Format to open the Formatting dialog 
box (see Figure 12-11). Now proceed as in Step 6.
Step 9 Practice deleting, creating, and formatting different combinations of partitions and ﬁle 
systems to become comfortable with the Disk Management utility.

Lab Exercise 12.04: Converting Basic Disks to Dynamic Disks with Disk Management
239
As you’ve no doubt noticed, I keep warning you to protect your data because you’ll lose it when 
you create or format a partition. While the partitioning and formatting utilities you’ve practiced 
with thus far are destructive to data, it is possible to resize a partition without losing data; 
programs such as GParted (http://gparted.sourceforge.net) can do this.
There’s also a way to convert earlier ﬁle systems to NTFS without the loss of data. Windows has 
a built-in command called CONVERT that you can use to change a partition from FAT32 to NTFS. 
You will perform this conversion in the lab exercises for Chapter 15. 
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 12.04: Converting Basic Disks  
to Dynamic Disks with Disk Management
In Lab Exercise 11.07, you conﬁgured two additional hard drives in a system to facilitate a software 
implementation of RAID. Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista Business/Ultimate, 
and Windows 7 Professional/Ultimate require that a disk be converted to a dynamic disk to allow the 
implementation of RAID. In this lab, you will prepare the two additional drives to be used in the next 
lab exercise by using Disk Management to perform the simple, nondestructive conversion from basic 
disks to dynamic disks.
✔ Cross-Reference
To learn more about dynamic disks, refer to the “Dynamic Disks” section in Chapter 12 of  
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll use the Disk Management utility to convert basic disks to dynamic disks.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
•

Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
The PC from Lab Exercise 11.07 with a primary hard drive that holds your Windows installation 
(converting to dynamic disks requires Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista 
Business/Ultimate, or Windows 7 Professional/Ultimate) and the two blank hard drives that 
you will convert to dynamic disks
Getting Down to Business
The steps to convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk are really quite simple.
Step 1 Open the Disk Management utility as in the previous exercise.
Step 2 Select the ﬁrst drive to be converted. Position the mouse pointer over the left-hand drive icon, 
right-click, and select Convert to Dynamic Disk (see Figure 12-12).
Step 3 Follow the wizard’s instructions to complete the dynamic disk conversion. Reboot the PC (if 
necessary) and then open Disk Management again. The disk should now be labeled as a dynamic disk 
instead of a basic disk (see Figure 12-13).
Step 4 Repeat Steps 2 and 3 on the third drive in the system (you will need two dynamic disks to 
implement a RAID 0 stripe set), and then proceed to Lab Exercise 12.05.

Lab Exercise 12.05: Implementing Software  
RAID 0 with Disk Management
It’s ﬁnally time to ﬂex your RAID muscles in preparation to deploy the two server machines—
remember, these are the systems with dual CPUs and SCSI controllers. Windows 2000, Windows XP 
Professional, Windows Vista Business/Ultimate, and Windows 7 Professional/Ultimate allow you to 
conﬁgure software RAID implementations using Disk Management and multiple hard drives. Windows 
XP Professional offers only RAID 0, a stripe set, which offers improved disk access time but no fault 
tolerance. At the end of this lab, you will have conﬁgured a stripe set using two disks.
✔ Cross-Reference
Additional information on RAID 0, 1, and 5 may be found in the “Dynamic Disks” section in 
Chapter 12 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
This lab exercise guides you through the creation of a RAID 0 stripe set using free, unpartitioned 
space on the second and third hard drives installed on the Windows lab system. These are the same 
disks that you converted from basic disks to dynamic disks in the prior exercise. Disk Management 
allows you to conﬁgure simple volumes, spanned volumes, and striped volumes on dynamic disks.
Figure 12-13 Disk Management showing basic and dynamic storage

Chapter 12: Implementing Hard Drives
242
✔ Hint
Microsoft’s dynamic storage provides ﬁve types of volumes: simple volumes, spanned volumes, 
striped volumes, mirrored volumes, and RAID 5 volumes. The ﬁrst three—simple, spanned, 
striped—are the only volumes currently available in Disk Management on Windows 2000, 
Windows XP Professional, and Windows Vista Business/Ultimate.
• 
Simple volumes on dynamic disks are equivalent to primary partitions on basic disks. 
Simple volumes use a contiguous area of a single drive and are represented by one 
drive letter or mount point.
• 
Spanned volumes enable you to extend the size of a simple volume to include any 
unallocated space (contiguous or noncontiguous) on one or more dynamic disks. 
Spanned volumes are represented by one drive letter or mount point and ﬁll the 
volume sequentially.
• 
Striped volumes use two or more dynamic disks, and spread data across all of them. 
Striped volumes are represented by one drive letter or mount point and will speed up 
disk access times due to concurrent disk write and read operations. The more disks in 
the stripe set, the faster the throughput.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll use the Disk Management program to conﬁgure a RAID 0 striped volume.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Create and conﬁgure a RAID 0 striped volume
Lab Materials and Setup

Partitioning a hard drive destroys any data on the drive! Practice this lab only on drives that 
don’t contain any data you need.

Getting Down to Business
You’re in the home stretch now! Once you’ve worked with the Disk Management tool and converted 
basic disks to dynamic disks, it’s just a matter of using the Disk Management New Volume Wizard, 
choosing the size allocated to the striped volume, and formatting the striped volume.
Step 1 Launch the Disk Management utility and right-click the unallocated space on the ﬁrst disk of 
the planned striped volume. Select New Volume and then select Striped (see Figure 12-14).
Step 2 The wizard asks you to select at least one additional dynamic disk for the striped volume. You 
will then select the size of the volume you want to create and decide what ﬁle system to use to format 
the striped volume.
Are there any restrictions on the size of the volume? _________________
Step 3 Disk Management now allocates the space on the drives and formats them with the ﬁle system 
you’ve selected. You should now have a healthy, formatted, striped volume.
Step 4 Practice deleting and creating various sizes of striped volumes using various ﬁle systems. Can 
you format a striped volume with FAT? Why or why not?

Lab Exercise 12.06: Maintaining and  
Troubleshooting Hard Drives
Of all the devices installed in a PC, hard drives tend to need the most attention. Maintaining and 
troubleshooting hard drives is one of the most common tasks you’ll undertake as a PC tech, but also one 
of the most important.
After all, the loss of other components such as video cards or NICs is inconvenient, but hardly 
disastrous. The loss of a hard drive, on the other hand, means the loss of data. This data might be as 
trivial as your favorite bookmarked Web pages or a saved Half-Life 2 game. But it could be as important 
as your business records, family photos, or the 1200-page novel that you’ve spent the last two years 
writing! Unless you want to spend valuable time and money trying to retrieve data from a damaged or 
corrupted hard drive, you should familiarize yourself with the built-in Windows drive maintenance 
tools. These tools include
• 
Error-checking This GUI tool enables you to examine the physical structure of the drive and 
retrieve data from bad clusters. Command-line utilities that perform the same duties are called 
CHKDSK and ScanDisk.
• 
Disk Defragmenter This tool reorganizes disorganized ﬁle structures into contiguous clusters.
• 
Disk Cleanup This tool reclaims wasted space on the hard drive by deleting unneeded ﬁles 
and compressing ﬁles that are rarely accessed.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use error-checking to scan for and ﬁx physical errors on the hard drive
• 
Use the Disk Defragmenter utility to reorganize the hard drive’s ﬁle structure
• 
Use the Disk Cleanup utility to reclaim wasted disk space

Getting Down to Business
Performing regular maintenance on your hard drives can keep them running more smoothly and 
efﬁciently. If you’re getting obvious disk-related errors (such as error messages indicating that your disk 

Lab Exercise 12.06: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Hard Drives
245
has bad clusters or cannot be read), or if ﬁles are missing or corrupt, a tune-up is in order. Another sign 
that your drive needs maintenance is excessive disk activity, or disk “thrashing.” It’s also a good idea to 
do some maintenance after a serious system crash or virus infection by scanning your drive for damage 
or fragmentation.
✔ Tech Tip
In a computer system, the hard drive wins the prize as the most critical storage device and 
for having the most moving parts of any of the components. For this reason, it is extremely 
important that you not only perform routine preventive maintenance (error checking, 
defragmentation, and disk cleanup), but also regularly back up critical data.
You will work with some backup techniques and tools in the lab exercises for Chapters 17 and 26.
Step 1 To scan a hard drive for physical problems, open My Computer/Computer and right-click the 
drive’s icon. Select Properties, and then select the Tools tab, shown in Figure 12-15. Click Check Now to 
start the error-checking utility.
In the Check Disk dialog box, you can opt to ﬁx ﬁle system errors automatically, scan for and 
attempt to recover bad sectors, or both. When you’ve made your selections, click Start.
Figure 12-15 Disk Properties Tools tab

Chapter 12: Implementing Hard Drives
246
✔ Hint
The error-checking utility must have exclusive access to the drive to ﬁnish scanning it. If you 
have services or applications running in the background, the utility will halt. In some cases, the 
utility will schedule itself to run the next time you restart your PC.
The error-checking utility has two command-line equivalents: CHKDSK (used on Windows 2000/
XP and Vista/7) and ScanDisk (used on older Windows 9x systems). There’s no inherent advantage to 
running these utilities as opposed to the GUI version, except that you can launch the utilities as part of 
a scripted batch ﬁle.
Step 2 To launch the Disk Defragmenter, click Defragment Now. The Windows 2000/XP version of the 
Disk Defragmenter is shown in Figure 12-16.
Disk Defragmenter offers you a choice: You can click Analyze to examine the disk to see if a 
defragmenting operation is needed, or simply click Defragment to start the process without ﬁrst 
analyzing the drive.
Step 3 Click the General tab, and then click Disk Cleanup. Disk Cleanup calculates the space you’ll be 
able to free up, and then displays the Disk Cleanup dialog box, shown in Figure 12-17.
Figure 12-16 Disk Defragmenter

Lab Analysis Test
247
Figure 12-17 Disk Cleanup
Near the top of the dialog box you can see how much disk space (maximum) you could free up using 
Disk Cleanup. But look carefully! Depending on which categories in the Files to delete list are checked, 
the actual amount of disk space you’ll gain could be much smaller than the estimate at the top. As you 
select and deselect choices, watch this value change. Disk Cleanup can remove hibernation ﬁles, Recycle 
Bin ﬁles, and temporary Internet ﬁles, and can also compress old ﬁles.

Chapter 13: Removable Media
250
Removable media storage is one of the fastest-changing components 
of the PC, and these days it’s also very much in the public eye. With the 
advent of USB thumb drives, iPods, and digital cameras using CompactFlash 
and Secure Digital memory cards, all kinds of people—from children to 
great-grandmothers, from artists to zookeepers—are using removable 
storage. With the high resolution of today’s audio and video ﬁles, 
photographs, and games, the need for portable large-capacity storage is 
greater than ever.
The lowly ﬂoppy drive has the distinction of being the only component of 
a modern PC to employ basically the same technology as the original IBM PC. 
It’s hard to believe, but when the ﬁrst PCs came out, the entire data storage 
system consisted of a single ﬂoppy drive and multiple ﬂoppy disks holding a 
little more than 300,000 bytes of data each! Floppy drives (and disks) have 
been around ever since, but with the recent advances in storage technology, 
the ﬂoppy is ﬁnally entering its twilight, due mostly to its tiny capacity.
Technicians were the last holdout in keeping ﬂoppy drives around. 
Although hard drives can contain trillions of bytes of data, they can also 
fail; until recently, techs could still depend on the ﬂoppy drive, and a disk 
that can hold less than 2 MB of data, to boot a failed system and provide 
troubleshooting utilities that might breathe life back into the PC. While 
techs still need these tools, they now come in the form of bootable CDs, 
DVDs, and even U3 bootable USB thumb drives.
As a budding tech, you’ll work with all types of removable media. The 
labs in this chapter will introduce you to the installation, conﬁguration, and 
use of optical drives, burners, and media. You’ll work with thumb drives and 
even learn to install the venerable ﬂoppy drive—this is important, as many 
corporations still order ﬂoppy drives with new machines. The ﬁnal lab in 
the chapter looks at some troubleshooting techniques for removable media.

Lab Exercise 13.01: Installing Floppy Drives

✔ Hint
Do you still have that non-production, disassembled PC from the lab exercises back in Chapter 
3? Well, if you haven’t done so already, you should have it completely assembled and running 
again after the ﬂoppy and optical drive installation lab exercises in this chapter. You can still 
use it to explore the hardware of video and sound cards in future chapters, and if you can 
install an OS on it, so much the better!

Lab Exercise 13.01: Installing Floppy Drives
Your boss recently approved the purchase of a number of new workstations, all without ﬂoppy drives. 
“Times are changing,” he explained, “and ﬂoppies just hold too little data. Plus they’re slow and 
cumbersome!” But the employees assigned to the new machines complained so much that the boss has 
decided to retroﬁt all the new workstations with 3.5-inch ﬂoppy drives. Many manufacturers offer 
external USB 3.5-inch ﬂoppy drives, but you found a supply house close-out on old, original ﬂoppy 
drives. You’ve been assigned the task of installing them into each system.
✔ Cross-Reference
To review the details of ﬂoppy drive installation, refer to the “Installing Floppy Drives” section 
in Chapter 13 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll practice removing and installing a ﬂoppy drive.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Remove a ﬂoppy drive safely and correctly
• 
Install a ﬂoppy drive safely and correctly
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer system with a ﬂoppy drive installed
• 
A known good ﬂoppy disk with data

Chapter 13: Removable Media
252
Getting Down to Business
Although this lab starts with a working ﬂoppy drive installed in a PC—a likely scenario in a classroom 
setting—you would obviously need to install one yourself when building a system. On a new system (or 
if you are reassembling the disassembled, non-production machine from Chapter 3), you’d start this lab 
at Step 5.
Step 1 Begin with the PC turned on and the standard Windows desktop displayed. To verify that the 
ﬂoppy drive works, insert a known good ﬂoppy disk containing ﬁles into the drive, and then view the 
ﬁles on it by following these steps:
a. 
Double-click the My Computer/Computer icon on the desktop.
b. 
Double-click the 3½ Floppy Disk Drive (A:) icon in the window (see Figure 13-1).
c. 
Observe the ﬁles and folders displayed.
Do you see ﬁles displayed? _____________________
Figure 13-1 Accessing the contents of a ﬂoppy disk in Windows Vista

Lab Exercise 13.01: Installing Floppy Drives
253
✔ Hint
If no ﬁles are displayed, try another ﬂoppy disk. Also, be sure to insert the disk properly. You 
should hear a ratcheting sound when you double-click the ﬂoppy drive icon. This is the sound of 
the read mechanism opening the metal cover so that it can read the data on the disk.
Step 2 Properly shut down the system, unplug the main power cable, and open the case following 
good ESD procedures.
Step 3 Carefully disconnect the two cables from the back of the ﬂoppy drive. One is the four-wire 
cable from the power supply (with its mini power connector), and the other is the ﬂat ribbon cable 
that carries the data to and from the drive.
✖ Warning
Be sure to notice the seven-wire twist in the ribbon cable before you disconnect it. Is the twist 
closer to the drive or to the motherboard? If you put this cable back on incorrectly, the ﬂoppy drive 
will not work. The end with the twist (see Figure 13-2) always goes closest to the ﬂoppy drive.
✔ Hint
If your lab has gone high-tech and uses rounded data cables rather than the traditional ﬂat ribbon 
cables, you can safely assume that one of the connectors will have a marking for the A: drive.
Figure 13-2 The twist in one end of the ﬂoppy drive ribbon cable
Floppy B
Floppy Controller Plug
Floppy A

Chapter 13: Removable Media
254
Now disconnect the other end of the ribbon cable from the motherboard. These cables can be quite 
ﬁrmly attached to the motherboard, so use caution! Grab the connector, or grab as close to the connector 
as you can, and pull straight up ﬁrmly but gently. Sometimes a connector will seem to stick on one 
side—make sure that you don’t pull unevenly, or you may bend the pins on the motherboard.
 How many wires make up the ribbon cable? (Go ahead, count ’em!) __________________________
 Is one of the wires a different color from the rest, and if so, what does that mean?  
________________________________________________________________________________
 Look at the motherboard where the cable was attached, and examine the pins. How many pins do 
you count? ______________________________________________________________________
 Look at the shape of the connection. Is it symmetrical, meaning you can plug the connector in 
either direction, or is one side of the connector keyed to prevent you from inserting it backward? 
_______________________________________________________________________________
Locate pin 1 (where the colored wire attaches) and pin 34. The thirty-fourth pin is the drive change 
signal/disk change signal. It indicates when a disk has been physically changed. If this wire is broken 
or not connected, the system will read the initial disk placed in the ﬂoppy drive after power is applied 
and remember the contents for that disk, no matter how many times you change disks during a session, 
until you reboot the system.
Compare your motherboard connection for the ﬂoppy drive with the one shown in Figure 13-3.
Step 4 Remove the ﬂoppy drive from the case. There are so many different ways that ﬂoppy drives 
are held into system cases that it would be impossible to list all of the various carriers, caddies, bays, 
and so on that might be used to hold your ﬂoppy drive.
Almost all ﬂoppy drives are secured to these carriers, caddies, and bays with ﬁne-threaded screws. 
The threads on these screws are narrower than those on the screws commonly used to secure expansion 
cards and the case cover. There should be two screws in each side of the ﬂoppy drive for support.
Figure 13-3 The orientation of the ﬂoppy drive connector on the 
motherboard

Lab Exercise 13.01: Installing Floppy Drives
255
✔ Hint
Get in the habit of storing screws safely while you’re changing out or inspecting hardware. You 
can use a small plastic bowl, a coffee cup, or an empty baby food jar or breath mint tin—but if 
you let those screws roll around loose, you may not have enough of them the next time you need 
to install a device!
Step 5 Now that you’ve removed the ﬂoppy drive, give it a thorough inspection. Look at the area 
where the cables connect (see Figure 13-4).
Is this ribbon cable area keyed or notched? ___________________________________________
 Find the indicator for the location of pin 1 on the ﬂoppy drive. What and where is it?  
_____________________________________________________________________________
 On which side of the connector does the red (or other colored) orientation stripe of the cable  
go—toward the center or toward the outside?  
_____________________________________________________________________________
How many physical pins are on your ﬂoppy drive? _____________________________________
Look at the area where the power is attached. How many pins are there? ___________________
Take a moment to experiment to see if you can insert the power connector into the ﬂoppy drive 
incorrectly. Be gentle!
Can you connect it upside down? ___________________________________________________
Can you connect it without covering every pin? _______________________________________
 On which side of the mini connector does the orientation stripe go—toward the center or toward 
the outside?  
_____________________________________________________________________________
Figure 13-4 Examining the connections for the ribbon 
cable (top) and power cable (bottom) on the back of a 
ﬂoppy drive

Chapter 13: Removable Media
256
✖ Warning
It is possible to force the power connector on incorrectly, which will cause damage to the drive. 
Practice how it feels to make this connection properly and improperly, so that when you do it 
from an odd angle (for example, lying on your back under a desk), you know how it should feel.
Step 6 Reinstall the ﬂoppy drive by placing it back where you found it in the case. Be sure to use the 
proper ﬁne-threaded screws to secure the drive.
Now attach a mini connector to the ﬂoppy drive to provide power, and attach the 34-pin ribbon 
cable securely to the drive.
Attach the ribbon cable to the motherboard. Make sure it is secure and all the pins are covered.
Did you make sure that pin 1 was connected properly at both ends of the ribbon cable? __________
Are the connectors properly aligned so that pin 34 is connected on both ends of the cable? _______
Step 7 Once everything is back in place, leave the system cover off so that you can make adjustments 
if needed. Start the system, and watch the green LED on the front of the ﬂoppy drive.
If the green LED does not turn on at all during the boot process, then check your power connection.
 If the green LED comes on and stays on all the time, then the ribbon cable is not connected properly 
(it is probably reversed either on the motherboard or on the ﬂoppy drive).
Is everything working properly? _____________________
 After you conﬁrm that everything is working, place the cover back onto your system. Start Windows 
and test your ﬂoppy drive as you did in Step 1 of this lab.

Lab Exercise 13.02: Installing Optical Drives
Your supervisor calls you in one day and announces that he wants to simplify the daily database backup 
procedures for your company. You will still use tape backups for archival backups, but he wants all 
the CD-R/RW drives on your company’s servers replaced with DVD-R/RW drives. The increased storage 
capacity of this type of drive will enable you to back up onto a single disc most of the critical ﬁles that 
change during the day. To accomplish this task, you must physically uninstall all the existing CD-R/RW 
drives and replace them with DVD-R/RW equivalents.

Lab Exercise 13.02: Installing Optical Drives
257
You should be comfortable removing and installing optical drives. Many optical drives still use 
the popular PATA interface to connect to your system, making the installation process fairly simple. If 
you are lucky enough to be working with a newer system, you will probably uninstall and install SATA 
optical drives. The CompTIA A+ exams assume you know how to install both PATA and SATA optical 
drives!
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll remove and inspect an optical drive, and then reinstall the drive.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Remove and install an optical drive safely and properly
• 
Identify the physical features of an optical drive
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer with Windows and an optical drive of some type installed (what type you 
use doesn’t matter, but it’s helpful if you have both a PATA and a SATA drive)
Getting Down to Business
Removing an optical drive is almost too easy. The only real secret here is to remember which cable you 
removed and how the cable ends were oriented, to make sure you can put it back! Also, PATA optical 
drives use the standard master/slave jumpers—these also need to be inspected to make sure that the 
drive runs properly on the PATA connection! For a quick look at jumper settings for PATA or SATA drives, 
check out the PDF at www.wdc.com/en/library/eide/2579-001037.pdf.
Step 1 Properly shut down your system. As I’ve mentioned before, there are so many different ways 
that drives are held into system cases that it would be impossible to list all of the various carriers, 
caddies, bays, and so on that might be used to hold your drive. Using whichever method is appropriate, 
remove the cover from the PC case so that you can access the screws on both sides of the drive. Using 
proper ESD procedures, perform the following steps to remove the drive from your system:
a. 
Unplug the connections. First unplug the Molex or SATA power connection from the back of 
the drive, and then disconnect the PATA ribbon cable or SATA cable from the drive. Unplug the 
audio cable coming from the sound card (if present) that plugs into the back of the drive.
b. 
Using a Phillips-head screwdriver, remove the screws holding the drive in place. Notice that 
the screws are small-threaded screws—the same type you encountered when you removed and 
installed your ﬂoppy drive.

Chapter 13: Removable Media
258
✔ Hint
Some optical drives are held in their bays by rails. Simply squeeze the rail toggles (sticking out 
of the front) and remove the drive by pulling it forward.
Step 2 Inspect the optical drive. Look at the front of the drive. Do you see a tiny hole near the edge 
of the tray door? Most drives have such a hole. You can take a straightened-out paper clip and push it 
into this hole to release the tray. This is handy in case you accidentally leave a disc in the drive when 
you remove it from the system. Go ahead and push a straightened-out paper clip into the hole to eject 
the tray.
Look at the back of the drive. You should see several areas for connections:
• 
The Molex or SATA power connection
• 
The connection for the ﬂat ribbon or SATA cable
• 
An audio connection for a cable to the sound card (there may be more than one connector 
because of different styles of cables, but only one cable should be connected)
• 
Jumper settings: master, slave, and cable select (PATA only)
✔ Hint
Look for the orientation of pin 1. It is usually closest to the power connection.
Step 3 Reinstall the optical drive into your system. It can be a master drive or a slave drive, 
depending on what other PATA devices are installed. Figure 13-5 shows a properly installed drive.
Now answer these questions:
Did you fasten the drive using the correct screws? _________________
Is the master/slave jumper set correctly? ________________________
Is the PATA/SATA cable connected properly? ______________________
Is the power plug fully inserted? _______________________________
Is the audio cable connected to the drive? ________________________
Step 4 Leave the cover off the system and boot the PC to the Windows desktop.
Step 5 Select My Computer/Computer. Notice if the drive’s icon is present. If so, all is well. If not, 
repeat Steps 2 and 3. The most common problem when installing hardware is a loose connection, so 
recheck your cable ends and try again. Replace the PC cover once the drive is recognized in Windows.

In Lab Exercise 13.01, you physically removed and reinstalled a ﬂoppy drive, but as you are aware, this 
technology is quickly being retired. This lab exercise uses the newest technology to replace the function 
and ease of the ﬂoppy disk, the USB ﬂash drive (thumb drive). You will use a USB thumb drive to 
transfer a large ﬁle by inserting the drive into a Windows system, copying some data onto it, removing 
it, and reinserting it into a new system (or the same lab machine) and transferring the data to the new 
machine.
Step 1 USB thumb drives come in many shapes and colors, as well as many data capacities. An older 
thumb drive might be as small as 256 MB, and a newer thumb drive might be as large as 256 GB. They 
are typically a few inches long, and most provide protection for the USB connector using either a 
cover of some type or a retractable mechanism as shown in Figure 13-6.
Boot your lab system and allow it to ﬁnish displaying the Windows desktop. Insert the USB thumb 
drive and note any activity on the screen.

Lab Exercise 13.03: Working with USB Thumb Drives
261
✔ Hint
Current USB thumb drives support the USB 2.0 speciﬁcation, allowing a faster transfer of data 
(480 Mbps). Some systems (motherboards, speciﬁcally) offer both USB 1.0 and USB 2.0 ports, so 
when you insert the USB thumb drive into a USB 1.0 port, you may see a pop-up message in the 
system tray (notiﬁcation area) pointing out that this device can perform faster if inserted into  
a USB 2.0 port.
Step 2 Open an application on your PC, such as Word or PowerPoint, and select and open a ﬁle. If 
you can ﬁnd a ﬁle larger than 1.44 MB, you can experience ﬁrsthand the beneﬁt of USB thumb drives 
over ﬂoppy drives.
Step 3 In the application window, select File | Save As. In 2000/XP, click the drop-down arrow for 
the Save in ﬁeld. You will see a number of folders and drives where you could choose to save the ﬁle. 
One of these should be the thumb drive, as shown in Figure 13-7. Select the thumb drive and save the ﬁle. 
In Vista, click Browse Folders. In the list that appears, click Folders. Then scroll until you see the thumb 
drive. Select it and save the ﬁle. Close all open windows.
Step 4 In the system tray, ﬁnd and click the Safely Remove Hardware icon, which in Windows 
2000/XP is a green arrow and a gray rectangle, and in Vista is a white checkmark on a green circle in 
front of a tiny USB symbol. A tiny pop-up message appears adjacent to the icon, listing all removable 
devices; click the name of the thumb drive. In 2000/XP, an information balloon with a Safe to Remove 
Hardware message should notify you that you can now remove the USB mass storage device. In Vista, 
an announcement will appear with the same message.
Remove the thumb drive from the USB port.
Figure 13-7 The Windows XP Save As dialog box showing a Lexar Media thumb drive

Chapter 13: Removable Media
262
✔ Hint
If you forget to close one or more windows with a focus on the thumb drive, you will receive an 
error message: The device ‘Generic Volume’ cannot be stopped right now. Try stopping it later. If you receive 
this message, just click OK, close all open ﬁles and folders on the thumb drive, and try again.
If you have some open ﬁles or folders on the thumb drive and you just pull it out of the 
machine, you may receive an error message such as Fail Write Delay. Most of the time the ﬁles and 
folders will remain intact, but this is not the recommended removal method.
Step 5 At this point, if you have a second machine where you can plug in the thumb drive, it will 
make the lab exercise more realistic. If you don’t, you can just use the same system again for this step. 
Insert the thumb drive into a USB port and again note any activity on the screen. This time, double-
click Open folder to view ﬁles using Windows Explorer.
Step 6 Double-click the ﬁle you saved previously; if the ﬁle has an associated application, this should 
launch that application and open the ﬁle.
You have now successfully used a USB thumb drive—also referred to as a jump drive—to “jump” ﬁles 
from one machine to another.

drive controller (FDC) and the USB controller, and which devices you can put in the boot order (ﬂoppy 
drive, optical drive, hard drive, and possibly USB devices).
Step 1 You will start by disabling the ﬂoppy drive. Enter the CMOS setup program by pressing the 
appropriate key or key combination (which you should remember from Lab Exercise 7.02) while your 
system is booting.
Having previously browsed through your version of CMOS, you should be able to locate the screen 
that contains settings for the FDC. If you can’t remember which screen deals with the FDC, browse 
through the CMOS screens until you ﬁnd it.
Do you have an option in CMOS to disable the FDC? ______________________________________
 Under what title heading did you ﬁnd this option? _______________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
 How do you disable this setting?  
_______________________________________________________________________________
Now disable it.
✔ Hint
Disabling the FDC is a good way for a network administrator to prevent users from using ﬂoppy 
disks to either take information off the network or introduce viruses into the network.
Step 2 Restart your system and see if you can access the ﬂoppy drive. Did the LED on the front of the 
ﬂoppy drive turn on as the system booted up?
Step 3 Re-enter the CMOS setup utility and turn the FDC back on. Reboot the system, and test the 
ﬂoppy drive. Does it function properly?
Step 4 One of the most important aspects of removable media is that you can boot a nonfunctioning 
system from a device other than the hard drive with the diagnostic and troubleshooting tools included. 
The next CMOS setting to play with is the boot sequence.

Chapter 13: Removable Media
264
When you boot up a PC, the system needs to know where to get the operating system software to 
load into memory. The three standard places to store this software are the ﬂoppy drive, the hard drive, 
and the optical drive. USB thumb drives have emerged as the next big bootable media. In some cases, the 
needed software is stored in another location, such as a network server.
Using the CMOS setup utility, you can designate the order in which your system will check the 
devices for the operating system software. Specifying the proper boot sequence—that is, the search 
order—saves time by telling the system where to look ﬁrst. After all, why should your system waste 
time looking on the optical or USB thumb drive every time you boot, if your operating system is on the 
hard drive?
Enter the CMOS setup utility, and look for a screen that includes a boot sequence setting.
How many different boot sequences can you conﬁgure in CMOS? ________________________
How many different devices can be in the search sequence? ____________________________
Set your system to boot from the optical drive ﬁrst (see Figure 13-8).
Step 5 Restart your system. Typically, the boot screen will prompt you with the message Press any key 
to boot from the CD. If there is a bootable CD in the drive, the system will boot from that disc. Leave this 
boot order in place for the next lab exercise, in which you’ll learn to create bootable CDs.
Step 6 Re-enter the CMOS setup utility, and note whether your system will allow you to boot from 
a USB device, such as a USB thumb drive.
If your machine is capable, you can substitute a USB thumb drive for the optical drive in the next 
lab exercise and create a live USB of the GParted partition editor. For now, leave the optical drive as the 
ﬁrst device in the boot order and shut down the machine.

Lab Exercise 13.05: Burning Optical Discs
PCs today are used more than ever for storage of digital photographs, music, and video, in addition to 
more traditional types of data. Even a modest collection of MP3 ﬁles, family photos, and home video 
clips requires many gigabytes of space! Hard drives do have space limits, and at some point they tend to 
fail, so wise PC users turn to recordable CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray drives. These discs provide an affordable 
large-capacity portable storage option; you can put your important data onto a disc, or make multiple 
copies of that disc to store in two or more secure locations.
This lab will introduce you to the process by which we record, or burn, optical discs. Rather than 
burning a disc full of your favorite tunes or photos, you’ll be making the type of disc that a technician 
would have in his toolkit when troubleshooting a machine that won’t boot.
➜ Note
If your systems have Blu-ray drives, you will be burning your disc the same way. However, be 
aware that Blu-ray Discs are better armed than current DVDs. They come equipped with a secure 
encryption system—a unique ID that protects against video piracy and copyright infringement.
✔ Cross-Reference
For additional information on burning optical discs, refer to the “Applications” section in 
Chapter 13 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll use a third-party burning program to create bootable ISO images on recordable optical 
discs.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Work with optical discs and burning tools
• 
Create a bootable optical disc

Chapter 13: Removable Media
266
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer system with a CD-RW or DVD-RW drive installed
• 
Internet access (preferably a high-speed connection) for downloading
• 
An optical disc burning application such as ISO Recorder, Nero Burning ROM, or freeware 
CDBurnerXP
• 
Blank optical discs (more than one if possible)
Getting Down to Business
In Chapter 12, you were asked to prep a number of newly donated PCs by preparing their hard drives 
for the installation of an operating system; you already partitioned and formatted the drives. To do 
that, you used the open source utility called GParted. GParted is a Gnome Linux live CD with the Gnome 
Partition Editor application installed. Your instructor may have provided you with the bootable CD, or 
you may have jumped ahead to this lab to make it yourself. In this lab you will burn the ISO image of 
the open source, bootable live CD of Gnome Linux and the utility GParted.
Step 1 Ensure that you have optical disc burning software that will allow you to burn ISO images. An 
ISO image is a complete copy of a disc, including all of the boot information in the boot record. Popular 
third-party products include the freeware ISO Recorder for Windows XP or Vista (http://isorecorder 
.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm) and the commercial Nero Burning ROM (www.nero.com).
You can also try CDBurnerXP, an excellent freeware burning tool that supports the burning of 
ISO images; it’s available at www.cdburnerxp.se. Just go to the CDBurnerXP Web site, follow the 
instructions, and run the installation. After you’ve successfully installed the program, you should have 
all the tools necessary to burn ISO images (see Figure 13-9).
✔ Hint
Microsoft is constantly updating operating systems and applications such as Internet Explorer 
and Windows Media Player, so don’t forget to check occasionally to see if they have updated the 
built-in burning application with the ability to handle ISO images.
Step 2 Now visit the GParted Web site at gparted.sourceforge.net. Click Downloads and follow the 
instructions. You can download the full ISO, or download the .zip ﬁle to improve transfer times 
(remember you will have to expand the .zip ﬁle after it’s on your system).
Step 3 Once you have the ISO image, open the tray on your optical drive and insert a blank optical 
disc. Close the tray and launch your optical disc burning software. Navigate to the GParted ISO ﬁle and 
follow the instructions to burn the ISO image onto the optical media. Most programs will eject the tray 
with the disc once the writing process is complete.

Lab Exercise 13.05: Burning Optical Discs
267
 Step 4 Place the newly created disc into the optical drive tray, close the tray, and reboot the 
computer. If all has gone well, GParted will boot, detect your hard drives, and give you the option to 
partition and format these drives.
✖ Warning
Remember, any time you format a hard disk, you delete the data currently on that disk. Do not 
run GParted on the disk containing your operating system unless you have been instructed to 
delete this system’s OS.
➜ Try This: Ultimate Boot CD
Now that you have an understanding of why you might want to boot a machine from removable 
media—to perform low-level diagnostics, troubleshoot, or just prep the disk before installing an 
operating system—take a cruise over to www.ultimatebootcd.com.
You can download the ISO image of Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD), which has over 100 different 
freeware tools, all placed on a live CD. Use the method you learned in this exercise to burn the 
ISO image to a CD, boot a machine with the UBCD, and explore some of the tools. You might ﬁnd 
that using some of the drive manufacturer’s low-level formatting tools will bring a dead drive 
back to life.

Chapter 14: Installing and Upgrading Windows

As a PC technician, you’ll spend a lot of time installing and upgrading 
operating systems. For this reason, it’s important that you become 
familiar with the tasks involved; otherwise, you might ﬁnd yourself in a 
tight spot when Windows won’t install on the laptop that your boss needs 
to have working for a presentation this afternoon.
A number of different operating systems are in use today, including 
Apple Macintosh OS X, several different ﬂavors of Linux, and of course 
the Microsoft Windows family. Because the CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation 
focuses primarily on Microsoft products—and because Microsoft products 
represent the majority of the market—these lab exercises are dedicated 
to the installation of Windows.
Just about anyone can install software if everything goes right and 
no problems come up during the process; plenty of people with minimal 
software knowledge have upgraded Windows without the slightest incident. 
Even an experienced technician may have problems, though, if the system 
has incompatible expansion cards, broken devices, or bad drivers. As 
a PC technician, you have to be prepared to handle both the simple 
installations—the ones with only new, compatible components—and the 
more complex installations on older and more problematic systems.
Installing and upgrading Windows is more than popping in the 
installation disc and running the install program. You need to plan 
the installation thoughtfully, check for component compatibility, and 
thoroughly understand the installation options and how to conﬁgure 
them. Good planning up front will give you the best chances for a 
successful installation or upgrade.
Be sure to have everything you need before you start, from the 
installation disc to the discs containing your device drivers. Remember the 

Lab Exercise 14.01: Installing/Upgrading Considerations
271
old adage, “Measure twice, cut once.” Believe me, it’s no fun to start over 
on an installation or upgrade if you mess it up! Do it right the ﬁrst time—
you’ll be glad you did.

Windows XP Professional, and everything works ﬁne. He has the documentation that came with 
his system, which states that it has an ASUS P4G8X Deluxe motherboard. He isn’t sure how fast the 
processor is, but he does know that he’s already using 512 MB of memory. Where do you start the 
planning process?

Chapter 14: Installing and Upgrading Windows
272
Getting Down to Business
The ﬁrst step in a successful Windows installation or upgrade is to determine whether the hardware 
meets the requirements of the new operating system. Your ﬁrst stop in this process is the Microsoft 
support Web site.
Microsoft has invested massive amounts of energy and time in building its support Web site. 
Sometimes digging through all of the articles on the huge number of Web pages can be overwhelming, 
but I’m a ﬁrm believer in this site’s usefulness. When I have a question that directly concerns a 
Windows operating system (or any Microsoft product, for that matter), I check this site ﬁrst, and I’m 
rarely disappointed. In fact, while searching for the answer to a problem or question, I usually learn 
two or three new, sometimes unrelated, things just by reading through the search results. Also, my 
search techniques improve with each visit. I consider the Microsoft support Web site an invaluable tool 
and resource.
Step 1 You’ll ﬁrst need to make sure that your client’s computer is capable of running Windows Vista 
Business. To do this, go to www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx and 
click the Download Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor button, which will take you to the actual download 
page. Click Download and save the ﬁle to your computer.
When the ﬁle is downloaded, double-click it to start the installation process, and then follow 
the onscreen prompts to install the Upgrade Advisor. When it’s ﬁnished installing, it should start up 
automatically, so just click the Start Scan button and wait for it to complete.
Once the scan completes, click the See Details button to view the results of the scan. The top of the 
screen (see Figure 14-1) will tell you whether or not your system is Vista-capable, and further down the 
page you can click buttons to view details about the system requirements, device compatibility, and 
program compatibility. The left side of the screen enables you to view details about the various editions 
of Vista, so click Business and then check out the details pages.
✔ Hint
Web sites are infamous for losing information that was once relevant to a particular subject—or 
sometimes disappearing altogether. If the Microsoft Web site should change signiﬁcantly from 
the time this book was printed to the time you’re reading this, and you ﬁnd that a link listed 
here is no longer valid, a quick search of the site should get you where you need to be.
Once you’ve seen the scan’s results, answer the following questions about Windows Vista Business:
What’s the recommended CPU speed? ________________________________________
What’s the recommended amount of RAM? ___________________________________
How much available hard drive space is required? ______________________________

274
➜ Note
If you search around for the requirements for Windows 7, you’ll actually ﬁnd that it’s a 
slightly less demanding operating system than its predecessor, particularly in hard drive space. 
Microsoft offers a Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, too, but in general, if your computer can run 
Vista, it can run Windows 7.
Step 2 Now that you know whether or not your client’s computer can run Vista Business, and, if not, 
what you need to upgrade in order to get it to run Vista Business, you need to ﬁnd out whether you can 
do an upgrade installation (called an in-place installation by Microsoft), where the new OS is installed 
on top of the old one, or a clean installation, where the drive is erased before installation of the new OS.
Doing an upgrade installation is based both on the version of Windows XP you’re upgrading from 
and the edition of Windows Vista that you’re upgrading to, so it’s a fairly complicated subject. In order 
to ﬁnd out the possible upgrade paths, you’ll need to do a bit of searching.
Go to www.microsoft.com/ and do a search for Vista Upgrade Paths. The ﬁrst search result should 
give you the information you need, but if not, search around a little. This sort of research will make up 
a substantial part of your life as a tech, so get used to it!
When you’ve found information about Windows Vista upgrade paths, answer the following questions:
 Can your client do an upgrade installation from Windows XP Professional to Windows Vista  
Business? ____
Can you do an upgrade installation from Windows 2000 to Windows Vista Business? ____
✔ Cross-Reference
For a refresher on the considerations that come into play when you install or upgrade Windows, 
refer to the “Upgrade Advisor” section of Chapter 14 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing 
and Troubleshooting PCs.

Lab Exercise 14.02: Using Windows Easy Transfer
You’re about to upgrade a client’s computer from Windows XP to Windows Vista, but the client doesn’t 
want to lose any of her important data. She doesn’t have a lot of data to transfer, just a gigabyte or so, 
but that data is absolutely essential to the operation of her business. Fortunately, you’re a savvy tech 
and you know that Windows Easy Transfer will enable you to back up her documents onto a ﬂash drive 
and then transfer them to her new OS after it’s installed.

Lab Exercise 14.02: Using Windows Easy Transfer
275
Learning Objectives
You’ll learn how to use Windows Easy Transfer effectively to back up ﬁles and transfer them to a new 
operating system.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use Windows Easy Transfer to back up ﬁles onto a USB thumb drive
• 
Use Windows Easy Transfer to transfer ﬁles onto a new OS installation
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC running Windows XP Professional
• 
A PC running Windows Vista
• 
Access to the Internet
• 
A USB thumb drive (1 GB or more)
Getting Down to Business
Microsoft’s Windows Easy Transfer has made moving data to a new computer as easy as it could be, but 
it’s still a somewhat complicated program. In this lab, you’ll learn all the necessary steps you need to 
take to move a customer’s data from one computer to another. If you ever work as a tech in a retail store, 
this sort of information will be vital when trying to convince customers to upgrade their PCs.
Step 1 The ﬁrst thing you need to do to use Windows Easy Transfer, of course, is to get a copy of 
Windows Easy Transfer. Microsoft offers Windows Easy Transfer as a free download, so go to www 
.microsoft.com/downloads and do a search for “Easy Transfer Wizard” to locate the speciﬁc version for 
Windows XP. Click the search result and then download the program to your hard drive. I’d give you 
the direct link to the download page here, but you wouldn’t thank me after typing in a nonsensical 
URL for ten minutes.
After you’ve downloaded a copy of Windows Easy Transfer to your XP machine, run it and follow 
the onscreen prompts to install the program. Once it’s installed, run it from the All Programs menu. 
The ﬁrst screen (see Figure 14-2) gives you information about the transfer process, so once you’ve read 
all of that, click the Next button.
Step 2 The next screen (see Figure 14-3) offers you several different options from which to choose 
how you want to transfer the ﬁles and settings to your new computer, whether by Easy Transfer Cable 
(a special USB cable sold by Microsoft), a network connection (useful if you’re transferring between 
two computers on a local area network), or by CD, DVD, or other removable media. Since you’re using 
a USB ﬂash drive, a type of removable media, select the third option.

Chapter 14: Installing and Upgrading Windows
276
Figure 14-2 Running Windows Easy Transfer
Figure 14-3 How do you want to transfer your ﬁles?

Lab Exercise 14.02: Using Windows Easy Transfer

Once you’ve selected the removable media option, the wizard asks for you to be a bit more speciﬁc. 
At this point, you can choose to use either a CD or DVD (even though the wizard doesn’t speciﬁcally list 
DVDs, you are still able to use them), a USB ﬂash drive, or a network location (see Figure 14-4). If you 
haven’t yet, plug in your USB ﬂash drive now, and once the USB ﬂash drive option is clickable, click it.
On the next wizard page (see Figure 14-5), choose your thumb drive from the drop-down list. If 
several drives appear in the list, make sure you select the right one! You can also set a password on 
your data if you’re transferring sensitive information that you don’t want falling into the wrong hands. 
Set a simple password and then click Next.
The next page enables you to select which type of ﬁles and settings you want to transfer, whether 
ﬁles and settings for all of the computer’s user accounts, just the ﬁles and settings for the current 
user account, or, by selecting an advanced option, any ﬁles and settings you want. Since all your client 
needs is her My Documents folder, click My user account, ﬁles, and settings only. You’ll then be asked to 
review your selected ﬁles and settings, so just click Transfer on the next page and your selected ﬁles and 
settings will start transferring (see Figure 14-6).
Step 3 Once you’ve transferred all your ﬁles onto your USB thumb drive, you can remove the drive 
and move it to your PC running Vista. If you don’t have a PC with Vista already installed, skip to 
Lab Exercise 14.04 and then come back when you’re ﬁnished with it. Once you’re on your Vista PC, 
open Windows Easy Transfer by going to Start | All Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Windows Easy 
Transfer.

When the wizard starts, you can once more click Next past the welcome screen. The next screen will 
be a bit different from what you saw when you ran the wizard in XP, as it asks you whether you would 
like to start a new transfer or to continue a transfer that’s already in progress. Since you’ve already 
backed up the ﬁles from the old computer, select Continue a transfer in progress (see Figure 14-7).
The next screen asks you how you are going to transfer your ﬁles, so select the second option, No, 
I’ve copied ﬁles and settings to a CD, DVD, or other removable media. When the next screen comes up, plug in 
your USB thumb drive if you haven’t already and then select the USB ﬂash drive option.
Next, you will once again be asked which drive the ﬁles are on. Select the appropriate drive, type in 
your password, and click Next, at which point the wizard will scan your disk for any ﬁles.
When it ﬁnishes scanning, the wizard will ask you to type in a user account name for the new 
computer. Since this is a step you’ve likely already completed when setting up Vista, you probably 
already have an account name. If so, select it from the drop-down list and click Next. If you want to 
create a new account, type an account name in the box and then click Next (see Figure 14-8).
After the account name page, you will be asked to review the selected ﬁles and settings for transfer, 
so check them over and then click Transfer. When the transfer is ﬁnished, the wizard will notify you, 
and will ask you to log off your account if you changed the account name.

✔ Cross-Reference
To refresh your memory about the ins and outs of performing a Windows upgrade, read the 
“Installing or Upgrading to Windows 2000 Professional,” “Installing or Upgrading to Windows 
XP Professional,” and “Installing or Upgrading to Windows Vista” sections in Chapter 14 of  
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working Windows XP Professional PC with a hard drive that you can write to without 
negative consequences (make sure it can also run Windows Vista)
• 
A Windows Vista installation disc
✔ Hint
A Windows Vista installation disc has every edition of Windows Vista on it, and you can install 
any edition you want on your computer for a 30-day trial without a product key. So if you don’t 
have a product key for Vista Business, don’t worry—you can just install a trial!
Getting Down to Business
You’ll need quite a bit of time to complete this lab; most of that time will be spent waiting for Windows 
to install ﬁles. The exercise will walk you through upgrading a Windows XP Professional system to 
Windows Vista Business. Depending on the systems and software licenses you have available, you may 
not be able to do this lab exactly as it’s laid out here. The important thing is that you actually perform 
a Windows upgrade, to see the questions that are asked during the installation and to become familiar 
with the process so that you’re prepared for the CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation exams.
Step 1 You’ve completed the compatibility exercise in the earlier labs, and you know whether or not 
your system can handle Windows Vista. Since you won’t actually be using Vista, just installing it, the 
main consideration for performing this installation is hard drive space. Make sure you have at least 
40 GB of hard drive space available on the computer you’re upgrading. Whereas it will be important in 
later labs to have a PC that can capably run Vista, you can complete this lab if you don’t have a Vista-
capable PC.
The ﬁrst step to doing an upgrade installation of Windows Vista is to make sure your computer 
is booted into XP. Because an upgrade installation is meant to be installed on a computer with a 
preexisting OS, Vista will not allow you to do an upgrade installation unless you start the installation 

Chapter 14: Installing and Upgrading Windows
282
while booted into another Windows OS. So, with your computer booted up, insert the Vista installation 
disc, wait until the Setup program starts, and click Install now. 
Step 2 When asked whether or not you want to download the latest updates for installation, 
choose the second option, Do not get the latest updates for installation. Ordinarily, you would agree to do 
this, but it can take a long time to complete this download, and you’ll be updating this computer in 
Lab Exercise 14.05, so you don’t need to bother right now.
Step 3 If you have a legitimate Vista product key, enter it on the next screen (see Figure 14-9). If not, 
just click Next and then answer No to the dialog box that pops up asking you if you want to enter your 
product key.
Step 4 Select Windows Vista BUSINESS from the next screen asking which edition of Vista you purchased, 
click the checkbox at the bottom of the page, and then click Next.
Step 5 The next screen is the End User License Agreement (EULA), shown in Figure 14-10. This 
document enumerates the deal made between you and Microsoft that you agree to by installing their 
software. EULAs typically contain a great deal of legalese, and are generally quite lengthy, and the 
Vista EULA is no exception. You are certainly free to read through it if you like, but you don’t have to. 
When you’re done, check the box that says I accept the license terms and click Next.
Figure 14-9 Product key screen

Lab Exercise 14.03: Upgrading a Windows Operating System
283
Step 6 The next screen enables you to choose either an upgrade installation or a custom installation. 
For this lab, you’re doing an upgrade installation, so select that box. This option may or may not be 
available to you based on the version of Windows XP that you’re starting with and the edition of Vista 
you’re installing to, as you saw in the ﬁrst lab in this chapter. The Vista installer may give you an 
error at this point, and if it does, follow any instructions it gives you and start the installation process 
again. If there are no errors, click Next.
Step 7 Wait around for a while as Windows installs itself.

Lab Exercise 14.04: Performing a Clean Installation
Your boss has traditionally ordered new workstations already assembled and loaded with the desired 
Windows OS. She recently decided that with her great in-house techs, she should be buying PC parts 
from a wholesaler instead, and having you and your team build the systems. You’ve enjoyed choosing 
the various hardware components and building these custom machines, but now it’s time to bring your 
creations to life! You need to load Windows Vista Business onto these new machines that have never 
seen the light of day.
Learning Objectives
You should complete at least one clean Windows installation, both for the experience and to prepare for 
questions asked on the CompTIA A+ exams.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Install a Windows operating system on a blank hard drive
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC with a blank hard drive, or with a hard drive that you can write to without 
negative consequences
• 
A Windows Vista installation disc
Getting Down to Business
In this exercise, you’ll be putting an operating system onto a hard drive that doesn’t currently have one. 
Even if the hard drive has an operating system on it, doing a clean installation will format that drive 
and erase all its data, so be sure you’ve backed up any important ﬁles!
Step 1 Insert the Windows Vista installation DVD into the optical drive, close the tray, and wait for 
the Install Windows screen to appear. Vista will ﬁrst ask you to select your preferred language (see 
Figure 14-11). After you do so, click Next. Then, click Install now.

Step 2 This process is almost identical to the upgrade installation, with a few key differences, so 
if you start to feel a sense of déjà-vu, just stick with it. Here are the steps for performing a clean 
installation of Windows Vista:
a. 
If you have a legitimate Vista product key, enter in the appropriate box. If not, just click Next and 
then answer No to the dialog box that pops up asking you if you want to enter your product key.
b. 
If you didn’t enter a product key, select Windows Vista BUSINESS from the next screen asking 
which edition of Vista you purchased, click the checkbox at the bottom of the page, and then 
click Next.
c. 
The next screen is your old friend, the End User License Agreement (EULA). When you’re done 
reading it, check the box that says I accept the license terms and click Next.
d. 
The next screen, shown in Figure 14-12, is the fork in the Windows Vista installer’s road. 
You’ve already tried the Upgrade button (which should be grayed out, since you booted from 
the installation disc), so go ahead and click Custom (advanced) to do a clean installation.
e. 
The next screen is the disk partitioning page, where you can select which drive to install Vista 
to, as well as how to partition that drive. You should already be familiar with partitioning 
drives using this screen, but that’s not important for now. Simply select the drive you wish to 
install to and click Next.
f. 
Wait once again for Windows Vista to install itself (it shouldn’t take quite as long this time).

g. 
Hey, that was pretty fast! Once the installer’s done copying ﬁles, it will ask you for a user name 
and password. Type in your name and a password that you can remember, and click Next.
h. 
The next screen asks you for a computer name, which you can generally leave as the default, 
unless you have a good reason to change it. You can also select one of Vista’s other desktop 
wallpapers here, so do that if you want, and then click Next.
i. 
Now you’re back in familiar territory, at the screen asking how you want to set up Windows 
Update. Generally, there’s no reason not to select the ﬁrst option, Use recommended settings, so 
click that now.
j. 
Now you’re asked to set your time zone, the time, and the date. Make sure all the settings are 
correct and click Next.

S 1-3 hours
Lab Exercise 14.05: Post-Installation Tasks:  
Drivers and Updates
As a tech, you will run into countless well-meaning, industrious, but ultimately hopeless customers who 
have taken their OS installation into their own hands, only to ﬁnd that some critical piece of hardware 
doesn’t work properly post-installation. Because of this, you absolutely must become well versed in the 
art of ﬁnding and installing hardware drivers and Windows updates.
Imagine, then, that you have a friend who has been happily using Windows XP Professional on his 
custom-built PC for a few years, but recently got a little cocky and decided that he’d do his own upgrade 
to Windows Vista, which seemed to go pretty well. Only now, his wireless networking card doesn’t work. 
And his graphics card seems to be acting kind of funny. And he can’t hear any sound. And … you get the 
picture. Because you’re an excellent tech, you instantly recognize the problem, and you graciously let 
him know that the problem is a result of his not properly following up his Windows installation with 
the appropriate driver installations. Then, of course, you offer to help him out.
✔ Cross-Reference
To review the process of installing drivers and updates, refer to the “Post-Installation Tasks”  
section in Chapter 14 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll learn how to ﬁnish up an installation by installing hardware drivers and 
operating system updates.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Find and install the correct hardware drivers for your operating system
• 
Install updates to the operating system
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
•

• 
Internet access
• 
A notepad and pencil
• 
Possibly a second PC and a thumb drive or other removable media

Chapter 14: Installing and Upgrading Windows
288
Getting Down to Business
The ﬁrst thing you should do post-installation is to upgrade your operating system, so you’ll learn how 
to do that before you move on to ﬁnding and installing drivers.
Step 1 When you install Windows Vista, it installs basic drivers for a wide range of products, so it’s 
highly likely that Vista will immediately have Internet access. If that isn’t the case, you will have to 
use another computer to ﬁnd network drivers for your Vista PC, and then use a thumb drive or other 
removable media to transfer them over. For more information on how to do that, see the next step of 
this lab.
Once you have Internet access, click Start | All Programs | Windows Update. Over the years, 
Microsoft has made this a fairly painless process, so all you have to do is click the Check for updates 
button and wait.
When Windows Update has ﬁnished ﬁnding updates for your OS, click the Install updates button 
to begin the installation process. If you’re curious about the updates being installed, you can click the 
View available updates button for more information.
After clicking the Install updates button, you may be asked to agree to further license agreements, 
which you should agree to. Then, Vista will download and install any updates it found. Note that for a 
just-installed OS, this can take a long time, so you may have to be patient for this step.
Once the updates have all been downloaded and installed, you will be asked to restart your 
computer. Do so, and you’re done. Sometimes, it’s a good idea to run Windows Update again after 
updating, just to make sure it got everything, but that’s really up to you.
Step 2 Once you’ve got your operating system updated (or if you need drivers to access the Internet), 
it’s time to install hardware drivers. On a custom-built PC, this step can be pretty intimidating, since 
you can’t just go to, say, Dell’s Web site and download all the drivers in bulk. Instead, you have to track 
down drivers for each and every component in your system. This can be a time-consuming process, but 
there are a few tools that all good geeks should know about that can drastically reduce the frustration 
of this process.
The ﬁrst thing to do when looking for drivers is to check Device Manager to get an idea about what 
drivers you should be looking for. To get to Device Manager, right-click My Computer, go to Properties, 
select the Hardware tab, and click Device Manager (in Vista, just open the Start menu, type Device 
Manager into the Smart Search bar, and then click the Device Manager icon).
If you see “Video controller (VGA compatible)” listed in Device Manager with a yellow question 
mark next to it, you know you need to look for graphics drivers. If you see “Ethernet controller” listed, 
you know you need to look for drivers for your network interface card, and so on. Most of the missing-
driver descriptions should give you a hint as to what they are for.
To ﬁnd the drivers, shut down your computer, open the case, and look at the motherboard, graphics 
card, and any other expansion cards the PC may have, like sound cards, TV tuners, and so forth. 
Often, these parts will have a manufacturer and model number on them somewhere, such as Gigabyte 

Key Term Quiz
289
GA-MA790GPT-UD3H written on your motherboard, or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260 on your graphics card. 
Write those things down and then do a Google search for them. If you can ﬁnd the manufacturer, just go 
to its Web site, look up your product, and follow the link to download drivers.
Sometimes, you’re not lucky enough to get a manufacturer or model number, but just about every 
device out there should have a sticker with some sort of part number or serial number on it. Usually, 
doing a quick Google search for that number and the word “driver” will get you the results you need. 
Finding drivers can be pretty frustrating, but keep searching and you’re almost guaranteed to ﬁnd what 
you’re after.
In today’s computing world, if you can ﬁnd your motherboard’s chipset drivers, most of the 
unknown driver icons in Device Manager will go away, so concentrate on ﬁnding your motherboard 
drivers ﬁrst, and the expansion cards second.

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
292
Although the CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation exams have dropped the 
requirements of working with the MS-DOS operating system, they do 
stipulate that PC technicians should know some of the basic commands 
and functions available at the command-line interface in all versions of 
Windows. Why? Because they still work, and good techs use the command 
line often. You’ll need a solid understanding of several basic command-
line commands, and a few advanced tasks. Commands such as CD, COPY, 
and ATTRIB, as well as the tasks of starting and stopping services, editing 
ﬁles, and converting ﬁle systems, should be part of your PC tech arsenal.
If you have a system crash and are able to gain access to the machine 
using Windows XP’s Recovery Console or Windows Vista’s System Recovery 
Options, you’ll really need to know the proper commands for navigating 
around your drives, folders, and ﬁles, and launching utilities that 
will get your OS up and running again. Also, when you start working 
with networks, the command-line interface on all Windows systems is 
invaluable.
✔ Cross-Reference
You will further explore the use of the Recovery Console and System Recovery Options in the lab 
exercises for Chapter 17. You will also have the opportunity to work with additional networking 
command-line utilities in the lab exercises for Chapter 23.
The command line can often provide a quicker way to accomplish a task than the graphical alternative. 
In cases where a virus, hard drive failure, or OS problem prevents you from booting to Windows, you 
need to know how to get around with the command line. The following labs are designed to give you the 
chance to practice your basic command-line skills so that when the need arises, the command line will 
be your friend.

Lab Exercise 15.01: Conﬁ guring the Command-Line Window

✔ Hint
As you have worked through the labs in this manual, I have recommended often that you 
explore features, options, and components not speciﬁcally covered in the lab exercises. You 
have embarked on the journey to become a CompTIA A+ certiﬁed technician! Natural curiosity, 
enthusiasm, and determination will go a long way toward developing the understanding and 
experience you need to become a competent technician and pass the exams. These qualities 
are especially important when it comes to working with the command-line interface. As you 
navigate through the following labs, it is easy to take a left when you should have taken a right 
and get lost in subdirectories, mistype a command, or delete a ﬁle you didn’t want to. Don’t let 
it discourage you. 
Making mistakes while learning is good, and learning from those mistakes is great! If you get 
lost, explore ways to get back to where you need to be—you’re unlikely to hurt anything. If you 
really get lost, work with your instructor or a more experienced classmate to determine where 
you went astray, then work through it again.

Lab Exercise 15.01: Conﬁguring the  
Command-Line Window
Before you can use the command line, you need to know the basics: ways to access it, manipulate and 
customize the look of it within the GUI, and close it down properly. This lab covers those basics.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll practice opening, resizing, customizing, and closing a command-line window.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Open a command-line window from within the Windows operating system
• 
Resize the command-line window
• 
Customize the look of the command-line window
•

Getting Down to Business
The ﬁrst thing you’ll need to do, obviously, is get to a command line. Spend the next several minutes 
becoming familiar with accessing the command-line window.
✔ Cross-Reference
For details on how to access the command-line interface, refer to the “Accessing the Command Line” 
section in Chapter 15 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Step 1 Turn on your system, and wait for the Windows desktop to appear. Then follow these steps:
a. 
In Windows 2000/XP, select Start | Run, then type CMD (see Figure 15-1). In Windows Vista, 
select Start, then type CMD into the Search box.
b. 
In 2000/XP, click OK to open a command-line window. In Vista, press ENTER.
Step 2 There are three ways to change the size of the command-line window for better viewing:
• 
Use the resize arrows along the edges of the windows (this will not work when the window is 
maximized).
• 
Use the minimize/maximize button in the upper-right corner of the window.
• 
Press ALT-ENTER to toggle between the full screen mode and a window.
Step 3 In Windows 2000, you should be looking at a black screen with your operating system 
information in the upper-left corner and a C prompt (C:\>) below. Windows XP will have a different 
prompt (C:\Documents and Settings\username>), and the Windows Vista prompt will display C:\Users\
username>. This just means that in Windows 2000, the command line opens as a default at the root 
of the C: drive, whereas Windows XP and Windows Vista open with the focus pointing to the user’s 
personal area in the Documents and Settings or Users folder, respectively.
Figure 15-1 Opening the Windows XP command-
line window

Lab Exercise 15.01: Conﬁ guring the Command-Line Window
295
To the right of the prompt, you’ll see a ﬂashing cursor indicating that it’s waiting for your input. 
There’s also a scroll bar along the right side of the window. Sometimes your command causes more 
information to be displayed than the window can hold, and it’s really useful to be able to scroll back up 
and see what messages were displayed.
You’ll now execute a few commands, for the purpose of exploring the scrolling issue. The Change 
Directory command (CD) lets you change the focus of the working directory displayed in the command-
line window. The Directory command (DIR) lists the ﬁlename, extension, ﬁle size (in bytes), and 
creation date/time of the ﬁles in the current folder.
You are going to change from the current working directory to a subdirectory with hundreds of 
ﬁles. Type CD C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 (C:\ is the root directory, WINDOWS is the system folder, and 
SYSTEM32 is where many of the system conﬁguration and driver ﬁles are stored). You may have to use 
a different drive letter or system folder name to arrive at the SYSTEM32 directory.
Now type DIR and press ENTER. The SYSTEM32 folder contains over 1000 ﬁles, so the command-line 
window will not be able to display all of the information at once. If there’s more than one screen’s 
worth of information, it will keep scrolling out of sight until everything has been displayed. You can 
use the scroll bar to go back a few screens’ worth—give it a try.
If you were actually trying to work with a few of the ﬁles in the folder, you’d probably be out of 
luck, because you can’t scroll back more than a few screens. To address this problem, there’s a command 
you can use that forces the information to be displayed one screenful at a time. Type DIR /P and then 
press ENTER. Adding the /P switch to the command tells it to pause after each screenful of text. Press 
the SPACEBAR to display the next screenful. You can’t go back if you’re too quick with the SPACEBAR, so 
take a good look at each screen! If you tire of paging through the screens, you can end the command by 
pressing CTRL-C.
Step 4 Just as with most applets in the Windows environment, if you right-click the title bar and 
select Properties, you can conﬁgure some of the features of the command-line window:
• 
Options Conﬁgure the cursor size, command history, display options, and edit options.
• 
Font Select from a limited set of command-line fonts and sizes.
• 
Layout Set the screen buffer size and window size, and position the window on the monitor 
screen.
• 
Colors Conﬁgure the color of screen text, screen background, pop-up text, and pop-up 
background.
➜ Note
Some features differ depending on which operating system you are using. For example, Windows 
Vista does not offer the Display Options panel in the Command Prompt Properties dialog box.

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
296
Explore some of the settings you can change, and feel free to set up the command-line window to 
your personal taste. I grew up on early IBM machines, in the days when owning a color monitor meant 
that you had an electric green or bright orange character on a black monochrome screen. See if you can 
re-create this wonderful look!
Step 5 There are two common ways to close a command-line window:
• 
Click the × in the upper-right corner of the window. This method isn’t recommended if the 
window is actively running a program. You should wait until you see the prompt before 
clicking the ×.
• 
Type EXIT at the command line, and press ENTER. I prefer this method, because I can be sure 
the window is inactive when I quit.
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 15.02: Navigating Basic Commands
Before you can really use the command line, you must know the basic commands needed to navigate 
around a drive to locate and modify ﬁles. In this lab exercise, you’ll learn more basic command-line 
commands that you would need to know when troubleshooting your or your client’s PC.
✔ Hint
For the most part, mistakes such as spelling a command or ﬁlename incorrectly won’t be 
disastrous for you. But it is possible to misspell just incorrectly enough to delete the wrong ﬁle, 
or something similar, especially if you’re using wildcards (I’ll get to those in a bit). Typically, 
though, if you misspell a command or ﬁlename, the command line won’t know what you’re 
asking it to do and therefore won’t do anything, or won’t know what ﬁle you’re asking to work 
with, and will return an error message.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll learn or review commands for directory and ﬁle management while using the 
command line.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use commands to view, navigate, create, and delete directories using the command line
• 
Use commands to copy, move, rename, and delete ﬁles using the command line

Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
At least one working computer running Windows
✔ Hint
Any version of Windows will work just ﬁne for this exercise, as long as you understand that the 
results may appear differently on your screen.
Getting Down to Business
Hundreds of commands and switches are available to you from the command-line interface. Although 
it is beyond the scope of these exercises to explore every possible command and its associated switches, 
you should spend the time in this lab exercise working with the speciﬁc ones that form the cornerstone 
of command-line navigation. These are the basic commands you’ll use most often when working with 
the command line.
Step 1 Follow these steps:
a. 
Launch the command-line interface in Windows 2000/XP by typing CMD in the Run dialog box 
and either clicking OK or pressing enter. In Windows Vista, access the command-line interface 
through the Start menu Search box with the same command.
b. 
When you ﬁrst open the command-line window, your prompt might not be focused on the 
root directory. Because you want to focus on the root directory at this time, you must change 
directories before continuing.
The CD (Change Directory) command changes the directory the system is focused on. When you use 
the CD command, you must type the command followed by a space and then the name of the directory you 
want to view. This is true of all command-line commands. First, type the command followed by a space and 
then any options. Because you want to focus on the root of C: and the name of the root is the backslash 
(\), you’d type in the following and press ENTER (assuming that you’re in the C: drive to begin with):
C:\Documents and Settings\username>CD \
Notice that the prompt has changed its focus to C:\> (see Figure 15-2).
Step 2 Probably the most frequently typed command is the request to display the contents of a 
directory (DIR). Because the command-line interface doesn’t continually display everything the way 
a GUI does, you have to ask it to display speciﬁc information. The way you display the contents of a 
directory is to focus on the particular directory or subdirectory, and enter the command DIR.
Let’s take a look at the contents of your root (C:\) directory. You should already be focused there 
from the previous step in this exercise. Type DIR at the command prompt and press ENTER.

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
298
✔ Hint
From now on, when you see an instruction to type a command, you should assume that you 
should press ENTER afterward to complete the request (command). Otherwise, the command line 
will sit there, waiting patiently until the sun grows cold.
Now here’s where it gets a little gray. Because I don’t know what’s in your root directory, there’s no 
way to predict exactly what your C:\ contents will look like—but it’s a good bet that something will be 
different from what I show you here! In theory at least, your display should be similar to Figure 15-3. 
Windows 2000, XP, and Vista will have the same basic look.
Notice that using the DIR command in any Windows operating system gives you the following 
information:
• 
Filename
• 
File extension

• 
Date and time of creation
• 
Size in bytes
• 
Designation as either a directory (<DIR>) or a ﬁle
• 
The number of ﬁles in the directory
• 
The amount of free space on the drive
Look at your particular results and note the mixture of ﬁles, which display a size in bytes, and 
directories, which have the annotation <DIR> after their name. In the preceding examples, AVG7QT.DAT 
is a ﬁle of 12,288,463 bytes, and WINDOWS, Program Files, and Documents and Settings are all names of 
directories.
Note whether you see the following ﬁles or folders in your root (C:\>) directory (you won’t see them all):
Yes
No
AUTOEXEC.BAT
CONFIG.SYS
WINNT
WINDOWS
Documents and Settings
Program Files
List the names of all the directories you see displayed in your root directory:
_____________________________ ______________________________
_____________________________ ______________________________
_____________________________ ______________________________
_____________________________ ______________________________
_____________________________ ______________________________
_____________________________ ______________________________
Step 3 The biggest challenge when working with the command prompt is remembering what exactly 
to type to achieve your goal. Learning the commands is one thing, but each command can have 
switches and options that modify it somewhat. Also, you may have noticed that the screen ﬁlls up and 
scrolls from top to bottom, making it difﬁcult to view all the information you might need. Let’s look at 
a command to clear the screen and another to provide assistance with how to use the commands.
Type the command CLS. What happened? ____________________________________________
Type the command DIR /?. What happened? __________________________________________

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
300
The question mark (/?) is a standard help switch for most commands. Even though I’ve used these 
commands for decades, I still use the /? switch occasionally to remember what options are available for 
a speciﬁc command.
✔ Hint
Be careful not to confuse the backslash (\) and the forward slash (/). In a command-line world, 
the path uses the backslash and command switches use the forward slash.
At this point, a huge amount of help information is displayed (see Figure 15-4), so you may feel like you’re 
in command overload! Take comfort in the fact that DIR is the most complex command. Other commands are 
more straightforward with their help. You don’t need to know what all the switches are—just know how to 
use the help switch (/?) to ﬁnd them! The main thing to learn is the syntax of the commands.
Everything in brackets ([ ]) is optional for the command. Notice that DIR is the only mandatory part 
in that command even though there are several optional switches and parameters. This is the same for all 
the commands. The system will use defaults if you don’t specify a switch or optional parameter. It’s the 
defaults that can cause problems if you’re not careful when using these commands. Now follow these steps:
a. 
Put a known good disc with ﬁles in your optical drive and let it spin up and come to rest. 
Cancel any windows that automatically open and proceed to the next substep.
b. 
Type DIR, and examine the resulting list of ﬁles and folders. Did they change from the 
previous step? ________________
Figure 15-4 Viewing the syntax of the DIR command

Lab Exercise 15.02: Navigating Basic Commands
301
 
Do you think it read the disc? Probably not, because your prompt is still focused on the root 
directory of the hard drive.
c. 
Type DIR D: (replace D: with the appropriate drive letter for your optical drive, if necessary) 
and examine the resulting list of ﬁles and folders. Did they change this time? Aha! The option 
of [drive:] was needed to change the focus of the DIR command to the optical drive.
The [drive:] option will work for any of the drive letters. Floppy diskettes, CDs, DVDs, USB thumb 
drives, and Zip drives are all fair game as well. When you use this option, you can look at those other 
drives without switching from the directory you’re in.
Step 4 Type DIR /? to look at two more optional switches: /P and /W. The /P switch is used when all 
the information will not ﬁt on one screen, and /W is used to see a condensed listing of the directory.
Let’s focus on a different directory. Remember, the CD command will let you change the directory 
you want to focus on:
a. 
Type CD \WINDOWS.
b. 
Type CLS.
c. 
Type DIR at the command prompt. This shows way too much data for the screen to display all 
at once.
d. 
Type DIR /P at the command prompt. This very useful switch causes the display to stop 
scrolling (pause) after each screen, waiting until you press the SPACEBAR to show you more. In 
directories with lots of ﬁles, this is a lifesaver!
✔ Hint
If you want to stop a process that seems to be running forever, you can press CTRL-C. The process 
will end, and you’ll get the prompt back.
e. 
Type DIR /W at the command prompt. This switch is convenient when you’re simply looking 
to see if a particular ﬁle resides in a particular directory, because it shows a “wide” list with 
ﬁlenames but no details.
f. 
Now practice moving around in the command window. Right now you’re focused on the 
WINDOWS directory. Go back to the root directory by typing CD \. To change the focus to 
another directory, use the CD command as you’ve learned. Use the DIR command to see what 
directories you have available in your current folder.
g. 
Try going to a subdirectory in another subdirectory and listing the contents. Look back at 
the list of directories you made previously and select one. Issue the CD command followed by 

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
302
a backslash (\) and the name of the target directory. For example, to switch to the Documents 
and Settings directory in the previous listing, type this:
C:\WINDOWS>CD \DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS
 
Do this using several of the directory names you wrote down previously, and then type DIR to 
see what’s there. Are there any subdirectories in this directory? Make a note of them.
_____________________________ ______________________________
_____________________________ ______________________________
_____________________________ ______________________________
✔ Hint
After you’ve changed the prompt focus many times, you may become confused about exactly 
where you are. You can always get to the root directory from any focus by typing CD \.
Step 5 A Windows installation creates a Drivers directory, within a directory called System32, under 
the WINDOWS directory in the root of the C: drive. To go to the Drivers directory, you don’t have to do 
the CD command three times unless you really want to. If you know the path, you can go directly to the 
subdirectory with one CD command.
Go to the Drivers subdirectory by typing this at the command prompt:
C:\>CD \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
Your prompt should now look like Figure 15-5.
Type DIR to see what’s there.
One ﬁnal navigation hint—you can change directories going back up toward the top level without 
returning directly to the root. If you want to go up a single directory level, you can type CD followed 
immediately by two periods (sometimes referred to as CD dot dot). For example, typing this takes you up 
one level to the System32 directory:
C:\>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS>CD.. 
C:\>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32>
Do it again to go to the Windows directory:
C:\>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32>CD.. 
C:\>\WINDOWS>
Figure 15-5 Focusing on the 
Drivers subdirectory

Lab Exercise 15.02: Navigating Basic Commands
303
Type the command once more to arrive at the root directory:
C:\>\WINDOWS>CD.. 
C:\>
Take a minute and practice using the CD command. Go down a few levels on the directory tree, 
and then jump up a few, jump back to the root directory, and then jump down another path. Practice 
is the only way to get comfortable moving around in a command-prompt environment, and a good PC 
technician needs to be comfortable doing this.
Step 6 Sometimes a technician needs to make a directory to store ﬁles on the system. This could be 
a temporary directory for testing purposes, or maybe a place to store something more permanently 
(diagnostic reports, for example). In any case, it’s important that you know how to create and remove 
a directory. The CompTIA A+ exams will test you on this. Follow these steps:
a. 
Be sure you’re in the root directory. If you aren’t there, type CD \ to return to the root 
directory, where you’ll add a new top-level directory. Actually, you can make a directory 
anywhere in the ﬁle structure, but you don’t want to lose track of where it is, so make your 
new directory in the root. Do this using the MD (Make Directory) command.
b. 
Type MD /? to see how the command is structured and view the available options (see Figure 15-6).
c. 
At the command prompt, type the following:
C:\>MD CORVETTE
d. 
When the command line just presents a fresh prompt, it means that everything worked 
correctly. But to verify that the directory was actually made, type DIR to see your new 
directory in the list. It’s as simple as that!
✖ Warning
Be careful—the new directory will always be created wherever the prompt is focused when you 
issue the command, whether that’s where you meant to put it or not.
e. 
Be sure you’re in the root directory (type CD\), and prepare to remove your new CORVETTE 
directory.
Figure 15-6 Using 
the MD command

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
304
 
Removing a directory requires the RD (Remove Directory) command and two conditions: First, 
the directory must be empty, and second, your system must not currently be focused on the 
directory about to be deleted.
f. 
Type this command:
C:\>RD CORVETTE
The directory has been deleted.
g. 
Type DIR to conﬁrm that CORVETTE has been removed.
✔ Hint
Be very careful when you remove directories or delete ﬁles in the command line. It isn’t as 
forgiving as Windows, which allows you to change your mind and “undelete” things. When 
you delete a ﬁle or directory using the command line, it’s gone. If you make a mistake, there’s 
nothing left to do but pout. So think carefully before you delete, and be sure you know what 
you’re deleting before you do it—you’ll save yourself a great deal of agony. Also pay attention to 
the directory you’re currently focused on, to ensure that you’re in the correct one.
Step 7 Sometimes you know the name of the ﬁle you want to use, but you don’t know in which 
directory it’s located. In this case, working with ﬁles and directories can become quite tedious. To help 
you locate ﬁles more easily, here are some switches and wildcards you can use with the DIR command:
a. 
Look again at the results of the DIR /? command, and ﬁnd the /S switch. The /S switch will 
look for a ﬁle(s) in the speciﬁed (focus) directory and all subdirectories under that directory.
b. 
Windows has a ﬁle named XCOPY.EXE somewhere on the drive. Locate the path to the XCOPY.
EXE ﬁle using the /S switch.
c. 
Start with your command prompt at the root directory (CD \).
d. 
Type this command:
C:\>DIR XCOPY.EXE
 
If the ﬁle isn’t in the root directory, nothing will be displayed.
e. 
Now try the new switch you just learned about to search all subdirectories. Type this command:
C:\>DIR /S XCOPY.EXE
f. 
On my system, the ﬁle shows up in two places: in the C:\WINDOWS\system32 directory and in 
the C:\WINDOWS\system 32\dllcache directory (see Figure 15-7).
Another way to look for a ﬁle is to use a wildcard. The most common wildcard is the asterisk 
character (*), which you can use in place of all or part of a ﬁlename to make a command act on more 
than one ﬁle at a time. Wildcards work with all commands that use ﬁlenames.

Lab Exercise 15.02: Navigating Basic Commands
305
The * wildcard replaces any number of letters before or after the dot in the ﬁlename. A good way to 
think of the * wildcard is “I don’t care.” Replace the part of the ﬁlename that you don’t care about with *.
For example, if you want to locate all the README ﬁles on a hard drive and you don’t care what the 
extension is, type the following:
C:\>DIR /S/P readme.*
The result is a list of all the README ﬁles on the hard drive. Notice that I used the /S switch to look 
in all the directories and used the /P switch so that I can view one screenful of results at a time (see 
Figure 15-8).
Figure 15-7 Locating the XCOPY.EXE ﬁle
Figure 15-8 Using a wildcard to locate ﬁles

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
306
You can use the * wildcard for any number of characters. For example, not all companies use 
README.TXT as the help ﬁlename. Some use READ.ME, and others may use READ.
Because READ is common to all those variations, let’s ﬁnd all the ﬁles with READ in the ﬁlename. 
You should be prepared to see a long list of every ﬁle with READ in the name, not just the README ﬁles.
Type the following:
C:\>DIR /S/P *read*.*
Figure 15-9 shows the ﬁrst screenful of results from my system. I found 104 ﬁles with READ somewhere 
in the ﬁlename. How many ﬁles and directories did you ﬁnd with READ as part of the name?
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 15.03: Using Command-Line Tools
Commands such as TYPE, COPY, MOVE, RENAME, and DELETE are used for manipulating ﬁles, such as 
you would be doing while troubleshooting a client’s PC. These are more of the commands that every 
working tech should know by heart.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll use commands for ﬁle management.

At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
View text (.TXT) documents from the command-line interface
• 
Rename ﬁles using the command-line interface
• 
Copy ﬁles using the command-line interface

Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
At least one working computer running Windows
Getting Down to Business
You might refer to these as the “second-tier” commands. Once you’ve used commands such as DIR, MD, 
and CD to navigate and create folders, you can use the following commands to manipulate individual 
ﬁles.
Step 1 In Lab Exercise 4.02, you created a text document using Notepad that you can safely use to 
explore ﬁle commands in this chapter. You will now navigate to your My Documents folder and verify 
that the ﬁle is there and contains readable text:
a. 
If you don’t already have the command-line window open, get to a command prompt.
b. 
Enter the following commands:
C:\>CD \Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\My Documents
C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\My Documents\>DIR /P
✔ Hint
To locate the ﬁle you created in Lab Exercise 4.02 and saved to My Documents, you should 
be logged on as the same user. The variable %USERNAME% (including the preceding and 
trailing percent signs) in the command-line syntax represents the user name you’re currently 
using. Microsoft has assembled many variables that can be used in this manner, such as 
%SYSTEMROOT% to represent the system folder (usually named WINNT or WINDOWS). You may 
actually use the variable in the command-line syntax to have the system insert your user name 
(the folder where all of your personal settings and saved documents are) in the path. I have 
included a generic example of the use of this variable in Figure 15-10.

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
308
 Do you see the ﬁle you created in Lab Exercise 4.02? (It should be called Command Line Test.TXT.) 
__________
Now you will use another command to verify that the ﬁle is a text ﬁle containing readable text. 
There are many ways to do this; you’ll use one of the simplest methods. The TYPE command displays the 
contents of a text ﬁle, but doesn’t allow you to edit or manipulate the text in any way.
c. 
Enter the following (carefully enter the line in the exact syntax as shown, including the 
quotation marks):
C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\My Documents\>TYPE "COMMAND LINE TEST.TXT"
You should see the text that you entered in Notepad during Lab Exercise 4.02. All of the text should 
be displayed, although you may have to resize your command-line window to see all of it, and even then 
it won’t be pretty.
The other thing you may have noticed is that to access the text ﬁle, you had to add quotation marks to 
the beginning and the end of the ﬁlename. This is because the command line only understands spaces as 
breaks between commands and operators or switches. Leave the quote marks out of the command line and 
run the TYPE command again. What happened? ______________________________________________
You should see something similar to the output in Figure 15-11.
You’re going to use this ﬁle in the next few steps, and it will be easier to work with if its format 
conforms to the 8.3 rule. In the early days of MS-DOS, ﬁlenames could only be eight characters long, 
with a three-character extension after the period. The three-character extension has remained 
throughout all versions of Microsoft operating systems, but you can now use up to 255 characters 
Figure 15-10 Using an environment variable to insert the 
user name
Figure 15-11 Results of running TYPE without using quotation marks

Lab Exercise 15.03: Using Command-Line Tools
309
(with spaces) as the ﬁlename. To make this ﬁle easier to work with in the command line, you’ll use the 
REN (Rename) command to change the ﬁlename.
d. 
Type the following command:
C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\My Documents\>REN "COMMAND LINE TEST.TXT" 
CMDLNTST.TXT
e. 
Now conﬁrm that this has worked by typing the following command:
C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\My Documents\>TYPE CMDLNTST.TXT
Great! Now you will be able to type the ﬁlename more quickly as you complete the rest of the exercise.
Step 2 At the command prompt, type CD \ to change your focus to the root directory.
You’ll now create a new directory called STUDY in the root so that you can do some copying and 
moving. The only difference between copying and moving is that COPY leaves the original ﬁle in the 
same place (as a backup) with a duplicate made elsewhere, whereas the MOVE command relocates 
the original ﬁle to a new location with no backup available. They’re otherwise similar, so once you’ve 
learned the COPY command, you’ve pretty much learned the MOVE command too! Follow these steps:
a. 
Make a directory named STUDY by typing the following:
C:\>MD STUDY
b. 
Verify that the directory is there by using the DIR command.
Now follow these steps for copying your ﬁle named CMDLNTST.TXT to the new STUDY directory:
c. 
Change the focus of the command prompt to the STUDY directory:
C:\>CD STUDY
d. 
Copy the CMDLNTST.TXT ﬁle to the STUDY directory:
C:\STUDY>COPY "C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\%USERNAME%\MY DOCUMENTS\CMDLNTST.TXT"  
C:\STUDY\CMDLNTST.TXT
Here, COPY is the command, C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\%USERNAME%\MY DOCUMENTS\
CMDLNTST.TXT is the current location and name of the ﬁle (notice the use of the quotation marks and 
the %USERNAME% variable once again), and C:\STUDY\CMDLNTST.TXT is the target location and name 
of the ﬁle.
The entire command and response will look similar to Figure 15-12.
Figure 15-12 COPY command and response

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
310
e. 
Run the DIR command to see if you copied the ﬁle. If the ﬁle isn’t there, carefully repeat the 
previous steps or ask your instructor for help.
f. 
Change your directory focus back to the My Documents folder (CD \DOCUMENTS AND 
SETTINGS\%USERNAME%\MY DOCUMENTS) and run the DIR command to see if the 
original CMDLNTST.TXT ﬁle is still there.
✔ Hint
If you’re already in the target directory, you don’t need to include the target path in the 
command. My idea of copying or moving ﬁles is to start in the directory to which you want to 
copy the ﬁles. Then you can bring the ﬁles to where you are. Each time you copy or move a ﬁle, 
you can run the DIR command to see if it’s actually there. The other way of sending a ﬁle to a 
directory can be troublesome if you’re moving ﬁles, because you may accidentally send them to 
a wrong directory and waste time looking for them.
Another good use of the COPY command is to make a backup copy of a ﬁle and rename it at the same 
time, so that the two ﬁles can reside in the same directory.
g. 
To make a backup of the CMDLNTST.TXT text ﬁle, type the following command:
C:\STUDY\>copy CMDLNTST.TXT CMDLNTST.BAK
You now have three copies of the same ﬁle; you will clean these up in the last step.
Step 3 The last two commands you will work with in this step are the MOVE and DEL (Delete) 
commands. First, you will delete the copy of CMDLNTST.TXT that you copied into the STUDY folder in 
the last step. You will then move the ﬁle permanently from the My Documents folder to the STUDY 
folder. Follow these steps:
a. 
Change the focus of the command prompt to the STUDY directory:
C:\>CD STUDY
b. 
Delete the CMDLNTST.TXT ﬁle from the STUDY directory:
C:\STUDY\>DEL CMDLNTST.TXT
c. 
Run the DIR command to see if you deleted the ﬁle. If the ﬁle isn’t there, you deleted it.
Now you will follow the steps to move the ﬁle from My Documents to the STUDY folder. You will 
then verify that the ﬁle is in the STUDY folder and no longer in the My Documents folder.
d. 
Make sure the focus of the command prompt is still the STUDY directory.
e. 
Move the CMDLNTST.TXT ﬁle to the STUDY directory:
C:\STUDY>MOVE "C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\%USERNAME%\MY DOCUMENTS\CMDLNTST.TXT" 
C:\STUDY\CMDLNTST.TXT

Lab Exercise 15.04: Advanced Command-Line Utilities
311
In this case, MOVE is the command, C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\%USERNAME%\MY 
DOCUMENTS\CMDLNTST.TXT is the current location and name of the ﬁle (notice the use of the 
quotation marks and the %USERNAME% variable once again), and C:\STUDY\CMDLNTST.TXT is the 
target location and name of the ﬁle.
f. 
Run the DIR command to see if you moved the ﬁle. If the ﬁle isn’t there, repeat the previous 
steps or ask your instructor for help.
g. 
Change your directory focus back to the My Documents folder (CD \DOCUMENTS AND 
SETTINGS\%USERNAME%\MY DOCUMENTS) and run the DIR command to see if the 
original CMDLNTST.TXT ﬁle is still there. Do you see it? __________ Why or why not?  
___________________________________________________________________________
You should now have two copies of the ﬁle in the STUDY directory, CMDLNTST.TXT and CMDLNTST.
BAK. The ﬁle should have been moved from the My Documents directory.
S 60 minutes
Lab Exercise 15.04: Advanced Command-Line Utilities
In Windows, you can perform many tasks either from the GUI or from the command-line window. The 
CompTIA A+ exams want you to be comfortable with both methods to accomplish these tasks. To practice 
your skills with the command-line versions of these tasks, work through the following scenarios and 
steps to explore the attributes, the Print Spooler service, and the NTFS ﬁle system, all with the view 
from the command prompt.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll work through three scenarios.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Work with the ATTRIB and EDIT utilities
• 
Start and stop services with the NET command
• 
Convert ﬁle systems
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
At least one working computer running Windows
• 
A hard drive with at least 1 GB of unallocated space, or a 1-GB or greater partition formatted 
with the FAT32 ﬁle system

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
312
✔ Hint
If the machines conﬁgured with multiple hard drives are still available from Lab Exercise 12.05, 
“Implementing Software RAID 0 with Disk Management,” you can convert these back to basic 
disks and format them with FAT32 to use in Step 3 of this exercise.
Getting Down to Business
Working through commands as you have in the prior exercises is an excellent method to explore the 
commands and their usage, but it can seem a little sterile since the commands are isolated and out 
of context. The next few steps are built around scenarios common in the workplace, requiring you to 
perform tasks that incorporate both commands you have learned in prior exercises and new commands 
that will be introduced as needed.
Step 1 In the steps that follow, you will use the ATTRIB command to alter the attributes of a text ﬁle.
a. 
Create a new folder in the root directory. Name it Folder. Inside that folder, create a new text 
document and name it TEXT.TXT.
b. 
Using your favorite method, launch the command prompt and change your focus to the new 
folder you created.
c. 
To list the ﬁles and all of their attributes, use the ATTRIB command:
C:\FOLDER>ATTRIB
Because the folder contains one ﬁle, the only ﬁle that should be listed is your new text 
document. Notice the A to the left of where TEXT.TXT is listed. This means that the Archive 
attribute has been applied. To make this blank text ﬁle more secure, we’ll add two more 
attributes: R (Read Only) and H (Hidden). For more options, type ATTRIB /?.
d. 
To change the attributes for TEXT.TXT, type the following command:
C:\FOLDER>ATTRIB +R +H TEXT.TXT
 This will add the Read Only and Hidden attributes to the text ﬁle. Verify this by using My 
Computer/Computer to navigate to the folder and checking its contents. Do any ﬁles show up 
in the folder? __________
e. 
Now change the attributes for TEXT.TXT again so that it’s not Read-only or Hidden anymore. 
Type the following command:
C:\FOLDER>ATTRIB -R -H text.txt
Return again to the folder in My Computer/Computer and verify that the text ﬁle has 
reappeared.
Step 2 One recurring problem you will run into in the ﬁeld is that one of the services in Windows 
will stall—in particular the Print Spooler. The Print Spooler is a holding area for print jobs, and 

Lab Exercise 15.04: Advanced Command-Line Utilities
313
it’s especially important for network printers. If the print device runs out of paper while printing a 
document, you may have to stop and start the Print Spooler to allow the print device to receive jobs 
again. Typically, you just open the Computer Management console, select Services, and restart the 
service. However, there may be times when it is more convenient or just plain necessary to accomplish 
this task from the command-line interface.
The following steps walk you through stopping and starting the Print Spooler from the command-
line interface:
a. 
Launch the Services console by opening the Control Panel, launching the Administrative Tools 
applet, and double-clicking Services.
b. 
Scroll down and highlight the Print Spooler, then select Action | Properties. You should see 
that the Print Spooler is started and running (see Figure 15-13).
c. 
Launch the command-line interface and change the focus to the root directory.
d. 
Type the following command at the prompt:
C:\NET STOP SPOOLER
The command line should inform you that the Print Spooler service is stopping, and then that the 
Print Spooler service was stopped successfully (see Figure 15-14).
Figure 15-13 The Print Spooler Properties window

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
314
✔ Cross-Reference
You will explore the NET command-line utility in the lab exercises for Chapter 23. If you would 
like to explore the NET command while working on this lab, type NET /?.
e. 
Using ALT-TAB, change your focus to the Print Spooler Properties window you opened earlier. 
You should be able to conﬁrm that the Print Spooler service has been stopped (see Figure 15-15).
Figure 15-14 Stopping the Print Spooler service from the 
command-line interface
Figure 15-15 The Print Spooler Properties window after 
stopping the service

Lab Exercise 15.04: Advanced Command-Line Utilities
315
f. 
Change the focus back to the command-line window, and type the following command at the 
prompt:
C:\NET START SPOOLER
The command line should inform you that the Print Spooler service is starting, and then that the 
Print Spooler service was started successfully (see Figure 15-16).
In the real-world scenario, your Print Spooler service would be restarted, and you should have a 
healthy, functioning print server once again. Now you just have to ﬁgure out where you stored the extra 
toner!
Step 3 Many of the legacy systems in the ﬁeld started out as Windows 98 or Windows 2000 machines. 
Often, these systems’ hard drives were partitioned and formatted with the FAT32 ﬁle system. As you 
upgrade these systems, you may want to leave the FAT32 ﬁle system intact until you verify that the 
upgrade has been successful. After successful completion of the upgrade, it is recommended that you 
convert the ﬁle system to NTFS. This is a nondestructive, one-way conversion! Once you switch to NTFS, 
you will have to delete the data and reformat the partition if you want to revert to FAT32.
In this step, you will create a FAT32 partition (unless you already have one from earlier labs) and 
then use the command-line utility called CONVERT to convert the partition to NTFS.
a. 
Boot a computer system with at least 1 GB of unallocated hard drive space. If you have access 
to the system you used to explore RAID 0 (striping), you can use the extra hard drives installed 
in the system.
b. 
Launch the Disk Management console. Right-click My Computer/Computer and select Manage.
c. 
Click Disk Management.
d. 
Right-click an area of unallocated space and select New Volume from the drop-down menu.
e. 
Follow the wizard instructions to create a FAT32 partition of at least 1 GB.
✔ Cross-Reference
To refresh your Disk Management skills, refer to Chapter 12, Lab Exercise 12.03, “Using Windows 
Tools to Create and Format Partitions.”
Figure 15-16 Starting the Print Spooler service from the 
command-line interface

Chapter 15: Working with the Command-Line Interface
316
f. 
Close the Disk Management console and double-click My Computer/Computer. Create and save 
a text ﬁle to the new drive to verify that the drive is accessible. Right-click the drive and select 
Properties; notice the tabs and ﬁle system (see Figure 15-17).
 Now that you have a FAT32 partition, you can launch the command-line window and convert 
the ﬁle system from FAT32 to NTFS. You will then verify that the conversion was indeed 
nondestructive by opening the text ﬁle you created in Step f.
g. 
Launch the command-line window and change the focus to the root directory using the CD \ 
command.
h. 
Type the following command at the prompt (substitute the drive letter for your FAT32 partition):
C:\CONVERT E: /FS:NTFS
Your result should look similar to Figure 15-18.
i. 
Exit the command-line window and double-click My Computer/Computer.
j. 
Right-click the drive that you just converted and select Properties. Your drive should now be 
formatted with the NTFS ﬁle system. Notice the additional tabs for Security and Quota (see 
Figure 15-19).
k. 
Close the Properties window and double-click the drive. The text document you created in Step f 
during the setup should still be there and accessible.

Not every computer is a part of some vast corporate network. Not 
everyone logs on to a domain and manipulates multiple ﬁle servers to 
carry out their business. Sometimes, a system stands alone. And lest you 
take pity on this lonely PC—or worse, ignore it entirely—its security 
must still be considered. Even without a network, a single computer 
contains plenty of vital data, and it is these very systems that will be 
accessed by multiple users (because, well, it’s the only one). Without 
taking the necessary security precautions, your data could easily be stolen 
or destroyed by anyone else who uses that computer. This is why user 
accounts, permissions, and encryption in Windows are so important.
As a PC tech, you may be called upon to set up a new user account. But 
simply adding a new user is just the beginning. You will need to keep in 
mind what sort of powers or permissions you want each user to have—do 
they need to be able to install new software, or is just being able to open 
and edit ﬁles enough?
But sometimes, the general set of abilities granted by each type of 
user account isn’t speciﬁc enough—maybe there are certain ﬁles or 
folders that should be accessed only by certain users, or groups of users. 
Then there are the ﬁles that should only be seen or touched by you, with 
access granted by your password alone. Or the opposite—maybe some 
folders need to be shared so that everyone on that PC can get to them. 
This chapter will show you how to implement these security features in 
Windows so that a single system can have multiple users working with 
and sharing ﬁles securely.

S 15 minutes
Lab Exercise 16.01: Managing Users in Windows
Any time you access a PC, you do so through a local user account, whether Windows makes it obvious or 
not. A lot of home PCs have only one user without a password, so this process becomes transparent. But 
that would not be the ideal setup for the workplace, unless you want everyone to be able to go through 
everyone else’s bank records, e-mail messages, personal photos, and so on. Having local user accounts 
provides a means of authentication—making sure that Steve is Steve—and authorization—allowing 
Steve to delete this, but not install that.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll practice creating and managing new users.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Create and manage a new local user account
• 
Work with user groups
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC with Windows
Getting Down to Business
Your client is a small business with four employees and one computer. They each need their own user 
account so that they can keep their personal data private and so that they stop accidentally deleting 
everything while logged in as an administrator. Adam is the only one with enough knowledge of 
computers to have a more powerful account. Betsy, Carol, and Dale each need more limited accounts, 
because they aren’t tech savvy and could easily break something.
This exercise works with any version of Windows, but for the sake of instruction, the steps will be 
repeated for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista.
✔ Cross-Reference
For more information on users and groups, refer to the “Managing Users in Windows 2000,” 
“Managing Users in Windows XP,” “Managing Users in Windows Vista,” and “Managing Users in 
General” sections in Chapter 16 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.

Chapter 16: Securing Windows Resources
322
Step 1 Follow these steps to create a new user account for Adam in Windows 2000:
a. 
First, make sure to sign in as an administrator; otherwise, you won’t be able to create the user 
account. Then click Start | Settings | Control Panel.
b. 
Double-click Users and Passwords to open the Users and Passwords applet, shown in Figure 16-1.
c. 
Check the box (if it is not already) at the top of the Users tab, Users must enter a user name and 
password to use this computer.
d. 
Click Add. In the Add New User wizard that opens (see Figure 16-2), enter a user name, full 
name (usually the user’s real name), and a description, such as a job title. Then click Next.
e. 
You would normally have the user (Adam in this case) enter his password at this point, but for 
the sake of the lab, create a memorable password, retype it in the next box to conﬁrm it, and 
then click Next.
f. 
Because Adam seems to be the only one who knows his way around computers, his user 
account should be designated as a Standard User. This will place his user account in the Power 
Users Group, allowing him to install and delete software and access other important Windows 
features. After you’ve selected Standard User, click ﬁnish.
g. 
The list of user names should now include Adam, and his group should be listed as Power Users.
h. 
Click the Advanced tab. Under Secure Boot Settings, make sure the Requires users to press Ctrl-Alt-
Delete before logging on box is checked (see Figure 16-3). This forces the user to clear any malicious 
programs from memory before logging on.

Step 2 Follow these steps to create a new user account for Betsy in Windows XP:
a. 
Again, make sure to sign in as an administrator, so that you can create the user account. Then 
click Start | Control Panel.
b. 
If Classic View is not enabled in Control Panel, enable it now by clicking Switch to Classic View.
c. 
Double-click User Accounts. Then click Change the way users log on or off. Deselect the Use the 
Welcome screen option (see Figure 16-4). This also disables Fast User Switching. Now each user 
will have to type in their user name and password at the login screen. Click Apply Options.
d. 
Click Create a new account. Enter a user name, and then click Next.
e. 
For the account type, choose Limited. Then click Create Account (see Figure 16-5).
f. 
Windows XP creates user accounts without passwords by default, so you need to add this 
manually. Select the user you just created by clicking her icon. Then click Create a password. 
Type in a memorable password and conﬁrm it. Then create a hint phrase to remind you of the 
password if you forget it. Do not use the password as the hint phrase, since this makes having 
a password pointless. Click Create Password.
Step 3 Follow these steps to create a new user account for Carol in Windows Vista:
a. 
As usual, make sure to sign in as an administrator, so that you can create the user account. 
Then click Start | Control Panel. Click Switch to Classic View, and then double-click User Accounts.
b. 
Select Manage another account (see Figure 16-6). Then click Create a new account.
c. 
Type in a new account name. Standard user should already be selected. Click Create Account.
d. 
Select Carol’s user account from the Manage Accounts screen. Click Create a password. Type in a 
memorable password, conﬁrm it, and then create a password hint to remind yourself in case 
you forget. Click Create password.

Step 4 Now that Carol has been set up as a standard user, your client decides that he really needs 
another administrator besides Adam. Carol turns out to know more about computing than previously 
indicated, so her account will be upgraded to Administrator.
a. 
As usual, make sure your account is set to Administrator. Then, in 2000, right-click My 
Computer and select Manage. In XP and Vista, click Start, right-click My Computer/Computer, 
and select Manage.
b. 
On the left side of the screen, select Local Users and Groups. On the right side, double-click 
Groups, and then double-click Administrators.
c. 
In the Administrators Properties window, click Add. Windows 2000 will give you a list to select 
from. Find Carol’s user account on the list, double-click it, and then click OK. In Windows XP 
and Windows Vista, type the user name (Carol) in the Enter the object names to select box, and then 
click Check Names. Click OK.
d. 
Click OK in the Administrators Properties window. Find the name of the group that Carol had 
been in previously, most likely Users. Double-click it to open the Properties window.
e. 
Find the user name in the list, click it, and then click Remove. Click OK. Now Carol is an 
Administrator!

Lab Exercise 16.02: Deﬁning NTFS Permissions
Now that you’ve learned how to set up authentication, it’s time to talk about authorization—what a 
user can do with ﬁles, folders, or any other resource. Granting NTFS permissions is a powerful and 
complex tool that allows you to deﬁne precisely who can do what on a system. Depending on your needs, 
this can quickly become a complicated and sticky web of overlapping settings that you don’t want to 
deal with. But it’s important to know how to deﬁne these permissions so that each user has the speciﬁc 
powers and limitations he requires. It’s best to start thinking about it one folder at a time: who can 
open it, and who can edit it?
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll use NTFS permissions to deﬁne which users can access speciﬁc ﬁles and folders.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Set up NTFS permissions for ﬁles and folders
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC with Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, or Windows Vista Business/Ultimate on an 
NTFS partition

Lab Exercise 16.02: Deﬁ ning NTFS Permissions
327
Getting Down to Business
Now that your client has a set of user accounts for his employees, he wants to set up a folder on the C: 
drive for everyone to use. But there’s one text ﬁle he doesn’t want Dale to touch—he doesn’t even want 
Dale to be able to open it, let alone make any changes. He’s asked you to set up the ﬁle with the right 
permissions so that Dale can’t access the ﬁle.
Setting up permissions for ﬁles and setting up permissions for folders are very similar procedures. 
In this exercise, you’ll work with setting up permissions for a text ﬁle, but the same procedure will also 
work with folders.
Step 1 The rest of the steps in this lab will be more straightforward if you ﬁrst deactivate simple ﬁle 
sharing (in Windows XP only). To do so, open any folder in Windows Explorer, such as My Documents. 
Select Tools | Folder Options. Switch to the View tab. At the bottom of the list of Advanced settings is 
the Use simple ﬁle sharing (Recommended) option. Deselect the box. Click OK.
Step 2 If you haven’t done so already, create an account for Dale on your computer using Lab 
Exercise 16.01. Make sure Dale isn’t an administrator and you are. Then navigate to My Computer/
Computer and double-click the C: drive. Right-click an empty area in the right pane of the window 
and select New | Folder. Rename it Work.
Step 3 Open the Work folder you just created. Right-click an empty area again and select New | Text 
Document.
Step 4 Right-click the text document and select Properties. Then open the Security tab. Click Edit. 
This opens a more detailed version of the tab you were just looking at. Listed should be several users 
and groups, but Dale might not be listed. To add him, click Add. Type Dale in the Enter the object names to 
select box (see Figure 16-7) and click Check Names. Click OK.
Step 5 Now that Dale is on the list, you can set his permissions. Select Dale from the list of Group or 
user names. The bottom half of the window shows a list of permissions for Dale. Everything should be 
set to Allow. Scroll until you see Read. Check the Deny box next to Read. Click Apply. A dialog box will 
pop up explaining how this will change the permission of this ﬁle and how it could affect other ﬁles. 
Choose Yes.

Step 6 Log off of the administrator account and log in as Dale. Go back into My Computer/Computer, 
double-click the C: drive, and open the Work folder you created. Double-click the new text ﬁle.
What happens? ___________________________________________________________________
If all goes well, Notepad should open, but Windows should deny you (Dale) access to the text ﬁle. 
Congratulations! You just set a permission!

Lab Exercise 16.03: Sharing Files and Folders
There are plenty of times when delving into speciﬁc NTFS permissions is overkill. Sometimes, you just 
want to share a folder, one that everyone can freely add to, edit, and so on. Windows makes it incredibly 
easy to share a folder with multiple local user accounts. Most versions even come with a folder set up 
for this purpose, like Public Documents in Windows Vista. But one shared folder isn’t always enough.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll use sharing in Windows to set up a folder that can be accessed by all users.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Set up a shared folder
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC with Windows XP Professional or Vista Business or greater
Getting Down to Business
In the previous lab, you created the Work folder on the C: drive of your computer. But the only account 
that has complete control of that folder is the one used to create it. Your client wants to make sure that 
every user on that system has full access to the contents of that folder. The easiest way to accomplish 
that is to use the share feature of Windows.
This is pretty easy, but to make it clear, the exercise will be divided between Windows 2000/XP and 
Windows Vista.
✔ Hint
Just because you know how to set up sharing in one operating system doesn’t mean you 
shouldn’t practice in another. Remember that the CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation exams aren’t just 
testing you on the OS you already know. Take time to check out all the differences.

Lab Exercise 16.04: Encrypting Important Data
329
Step 1 Windows makes the basic process of sharing ﬁles and folders over a network pretty easy, 
but don’t think that because it’s easy, it’s simple. File sharing in Windows is an incredibly deep and 
complex topic, and you’re only going to scratch the surface in this lab. Entire books have been written 
about share permissions and proper sharing security. With that said, here are the basic steps for 
sharing a ﬁle over a Windows network:
a. 
In Windows 2000/XP, navigate to the C: drive in My Computer. If you haven’t already done 
so, create a Work folder in the root folder of the C: drive. Then right-click the folder and click 
Properties.
b. 
Open the Sharing tab. Select Share This Folder. Then click Permissions. From the choices given, 
select Everyone. On the bottom half of the window, under Permissions for Everyone, check the 
Allow box next to Full Control. Click OK. Now you are sharing the Work folder with everyone!
➜ Note
If you have XP Professional, but aren’t seeing these options in the Sharing tab, it’s because 
you’re using simple ﬁle sharing. To ﬁx this, go to the Control Panel and open the Folder Options 
applet. At the bottom of the View tab, you will see a checkbox that says Use simple ﬁle sharing 
(Recommended). Uncheck this and click OK.
Step 2 The process for sharing folders in Windows Vista has changed signiﬁcantly. Here are the steps 
for accomplishing in Vista what you did in XP in Step 1:
a. 
In Windows Vista, navigate to the C: drive in Computer. If you haven’t already done so, create 
a Work folder in the root folder of the C: drive. Then right-click the folder and select Share.
b. 
Select Change sharing permissions. From the drop-down menu, select Everyone. Click Add. Then, 
in the list of Names and Permission Levels below, click Everyone. Open the drop-down menu 
for the Permission Level and select Co-Owner. Then click Share. Done!

Lab Exercise 16.04: Encrypting Important Data
So far, you’ve gone through several methods of securing data on a machine accessed by multiple users. 
But these features don’t secure the data itself as much as put a wall around it to keep people out. The 
data inside is (as of yet) defenseless. If a system has two administrator accounts, and one administrator 
sets up ﬁle permissions to keep the other out, the second administrator has the power to undo those 
permissions and access the data—unless you activate encryption.

Chapter 16: Securing Windows Resources
330
When you encrypt a ﬁle, it becomes absolutely secure from everyone else but you or, more 
speciﬁcally, your password. If you were to lose your password, or an administrator were to change it for 
you, that data would be lost forever, because that password is the only way to get it back. So be careful!
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll use encryption to protect sensitive data.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use the Encrypting File System in Windows
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC with Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, or Windows Vista Business/Ultimate
Getting Down to Business
Your client has several personal documents that she keeps copies of on her computer at work. But she 
isn’t the only administrator on that system, so to fully secure the data, she wants it to be encrypted.
Thanks to the Encrypting File System introduced with NTFS, encrypting ﬁles in Windows is simple. 
Be warned, however, that if you lose access to the user account that you used to encrypt the ﬁles, you 
will lose those ﬁles forever!
✔ Hint
The Home versions of Windows, such as Windows XP Home and Windows Vista Home Premium, 
do not include a utility to encrypt data. If you are using one of these operating systems and still 
want to or need to use encryption, check out TrueCrypt. Open source (and free), TrueCrypt provides 
advanced encryption features across multiple platforms. Check it out at www.truecrypt.org.
Step 1 Navigate to the ﬁles or folder in question (for the purposes of the lab, use the Work folder you 
already created). Right-click the Work folder and select Properties. Next to the Attributes checkboxes, 
click the Advanced button. At the bottom of the Advanced Attributes applet, check the box for Encrypt 
contents to secure data (see Figure 16-8). Click OK.
Step 2 Now switch to another user, even another administrator. Navigate back to the folder that you 
just encrypted. Try opening it.

Imagine that your company has just acquired a small architectural ﬁrm. 
One of the principals of the ﬁrm informs you that they haven’t really had 
any IT support to speak of in a few years. You visit the new ofﬁce and 
determine that the computers are about three years old. They were good 
machines when they were purchased, and as long as the hardware is not 
failing, they should be more than adequate for a year or two more. The 
architects do complain that their machines are running slowly and that 
it’s affecting productivity. You would like to avoid a complete rollout of 
new PCs, since you’re looking at a replacement expense of thousands of 
dollars. Consequently, you decide it would be worthwhile to spend a day 
trying to ﬁgure out if anything can be done to make the machines run 
faster.
After checking out a few of the systems, you determine that they could 
deﬁnitely beneﬁt from additional memory, but that’s not the only issue—
none of the systems have been updated in over three years! Even though 
most versions of Windows are optimized when they’re installed, time and 
use can alter that fact signiﬁcantly. It’s important, therefore, to be able 
to take what you know about navigating and manipulating the Windows 
environment and put it to work ﬁguring out what needs to be ﬁxed, 
updated, or improved. Sometimes a simple tweak is all it takes to make 
a sluggish system run like it’s fresh out of the box.
One of the ﬁrst tasks is to make sure that all of the systems have the 
latest service packs and Windows updates. Before you do that, however, 
it’s recommended that you back up all of the data on the systems, as this 
can be a pretty major upgrade. Another item that needs to be checked is 
whether the device drivers are all up to date. Neglected PCs will deﬁnitely 
require updated device drivers.

Lab Exercise 17.01: Performing a Backup and Restoration

First, you will learn how to back up and restore your system as 
preparation for updating and optimizing Windows. You’ll then explore 
the various troubleshooting tools included with Windows. It’s time to 
drop a few sticks of memory into the pilot machines, back them up, run 
them through the service packs and updates, and get this ofﬁce back on

Lab Exercise 17.01: Performing  
a Backup and Restoration
Windows offers both simple backup/restoration utilities that you can use to back up system data and 
program data and ﬁles, and an advanced recovery feature, in case the system becomes so unstable that it 
won’t even boot.
Windows 2000 uses the Emergency Repair Disk (ERD), Windows XP introduced the Automated 
System Recovery (ASR) routine, and Windows Vista uses the Backup and Restore Center. The ERD and 
ASR only create nonbootable disks with tools to restore a system in case of a major failure, whereas 
Vista’s Backup and Restore Center will make a full (or partial) backup of your entire system that is 
restored using the System Recovery Options. It is important to understand—and the CompTIA A+ 
certiﬁcation exams expect you to know this—that none of these options are bootable.
This lab introduces you to the ASR process in Windows XP Professional and the Backup and Restore 
Center in Windows Vista.
✖ Warning
The ERD and ASR processes do not back up or restore program data or ﬁles! After the system 
restoration process is complete, the program data and ﬁles must be restored separately from 
previously created backup media.
Learning Objectives
Performing backups of any kind is a critical responsibility of a PC technician. The Windows XP 
Professional Automated System Recovery and the Vista Backup and Restore Center are excellent 
representations of the steps required to back up and restore an OS.

Chapter 17: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Windows

Getting Down to Business
The time to prepare a backup is while the system and data are in a state of complete integrity. It’s when 
they crash or get corrupted that you’ll need the backup! The following steps create an ASR set and then 
use that ASR set to restore a Windows XP system to working condition. The steps for the Windows Vista 
Backup and Recovery Center will follow.
AUTOMATED SYSTEM RECOVERY PREPARATION

Step 2 Launch the Automated System Recovery Wizard and perform the following steps:
a. 
Click Next, and in the Backup media or ﬁle name dialog box, type or browse for the location in which 
you want the backup to be placed. Then name the backup ﬁle, being careful to preserve the .BKF 
ﬁle extension. If you are using a separate partition, for example, you might enter D:\MyASRBK.BKF 
to create the ﬁle on the D: drive.
b. 
Click Next and then click Finish to start the backup of your system ﬁles.
c. 
When the backup completes, the ASR Preparation Wizard instructs you to insert a formatted 
1.44-MB ﬂoppy disk. Click OK. ASR copies the required ﬁles onto the ﬂoppy disk.
d. 
When instructed, remove and label the ﬂoppy disk and then click OK. You have completed the 
preparation for an Automated System Recovery.
AUTOMATED SYSTEM RECOVERY RESTORE
Step 1 Boot the system using the Windows XP Professional installation CD-ROM.
Step 2 When prompted with Press F2 to run Automated System Recovery (ASR), press the F2 key.
Step 3 Insert the ASR ﬂoppy disk and press any key when ready.
Step 4 The Windows XP Installer will copy ﬁles to a temporary folder, format the partition where XP 
will be installed, and prompt you to remove the installation CD-ROM and reboot.
Step 5 After rebooting, the Windows XP installation continues.
a. 
During the installation, you’ll be prompted for the location of the ASR backup ﬁle.
b. 
Enter the ﬁle location or use the Browse button to enter the location and name of the ASR 
backup ﬁle.
c. 
Click OK.
d. 
The installation now completes. All of the Windows XP conﬁguration settings and preferences 
should be as they were on the original system.
BACKUP AND RESTORE CENTER
Step 1 Open Control Panel. Switch to Classic View (if you haven’t already) and double-click Backup 
and Restore Center.
Step 2 To set up the backup, decide ﬁrst whether to back up certain ﬁles or the whole computer. The 
Back Up Files wizard will open. Select where to save the backup and click Next. If you chose only a partial 
backup, select the ﬁle types you wish to back up from the list provided. Click Next. For partial backups, 
Windows also asks how often you want the backup to be updated. Click Save settings and start backup.
Step 3 To restore ﬁles, choose whether to restore only certain ﬁles or to restore a Windows Complete 
Backup and Restore image. (To do a complete restoration, you must reboot your system and open the 
System Recovery Options from the installation media.) If you are performing a partial restoration, click 
Restore ﬁles. Select whether to restore the latest backup or an older one. Click Next. Then select where 
to restore the backup ﬁles to and click Start Restore. If you are overwriting any ﬁles, a window will 
pop up asking how to resolve the conﬂict.

Lab Exercise 17.02: Upgrading to Windows Vista SP2 
and Conﬁguring Automatic Updates
These systems have been around for some time, so there are probably a number of outdated patches 
and drivers. Windows Vista went through a major upgrade with Service Pack 2, so this is where you’ll 
start. If you are working with a new installation of Windows Vista, Service Pack 2 should already 
be incorporated into the cabinet ﬁles, but these are old machines, so they will need some attention. 
Upgrading to Service Pack 2 is imperative to keeping the system up and running, secure, and compatible 
with new technology. To bring the OS up to date, you will ﬁrst manually download and install Service 
Pack 2, and then conﬁgure Automatic Updates so Windows will take care of future updates on its own.
Learning Objectives
A competent technician should understand the importance of upgrading an OS with the latest service 
pack.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Upgrade Windows Vista to Service Pack 2
• 
Conﬁgure Windows Automatic Updates to update drivers, security patches, and utilities
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC with Windows installed

➜ Note
The procedures for updating Windows and setting up Automatic Updates are very similar 
between Windows XP and Windows Vista. Although this lab describes a Windows Vista upgrade, 
the concept remains the same for Windows XP.

Step 1 You will need to procure Windows Vista Service Pack 2. Go to Microsoft’s Web site and search 
for vista service pack 2, or go straight to http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dd262148.aspx. 
The search should return a page with the title Service Pack 2 for Windows Server 2008 and Windows 
Vista; follow the directions on this page to download Service Pack 2. You may also order this update on 
optical disc—this can come in handy if you have a slower Internet connection. (You’ll look at getting 
updates through Automatic Updates next.)
Step 2 Once the download ﬁnishes, or your optical disc has arrived, log on to the system that you 
want to update. Open the folder where you have placed the ﬁles and complete the following steps:
a. 
Double-click the setup ﬁle you downloaded.
b. 
The Windows Vista Service Pack 2 setup wizard welcome screen appears (see Figure 17-2). Click 
Next to continue.
c. 
The End User License Agreement screen displays next. Accept the agreement and click Next to 
continue.
d. 
The setup wizard now inspects your machine, installs ﬁles, and upgrades your system. When 
the upgrade is complete, the wizard informs you that Windows Vista Service Pack 2 is now installed 
on your computer (see Figure 17-3).
e. 
Click Finish and let the system reboot.

Figure 17-3 Completing the Windows Vista Service 
Pack 2 setup wizard
f. 
After the machine reboots for the ﬁrst time with Service Pack 2 installed, Windows gives you 
the opportunity to turn on Automatic Updates before it presents the logon screen. Decline this 
option for now; you will manually conﬁgure this in the next step.
Step 3 You will now conﬁgure the system to perform automatic updates. Log on to Windows and 
complete the following steps:
a. 
In Windows XP, click Start | All Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Security Center. In 
Windows Vista, type Security Center in the Start Search box. This opens the Windows Security 
Center window, where you’ll ﬁnd the conﬁguration utility for Windows’ Automatic Updates 
feature. Click Automatic Updates.
✔ Cross-Reference
You will have the opportunity to work with antivirus software in Chapter 26.
b. 
This brings up the Automatic Updates conﬁguration screen (see Figure 17-4) in Windows XP. 
Click Automatic (recommended) and then click Apply. In Windows Vista, select Change Settings, 
and then choose Install Updates Automatically.

c. 
The Windows Security Center screen now indicates that Automatic Updates is set to On, and 
the yellow security shield should disappear from the notiﬁcation area (system tray).
d. 
If your system is connected to the Internet, you can visit the Microsoft Windows Update Web 
site. There, you can choose to install all critical Windows updates, or select speciﬁc updates to 
install.

Lab Exercise 17.03: Installing Device  
Drivers in Windows
Installing new devices under Windows is easier than it has ever been. Assuming, of course, that you 
start with compatible hardware, Windows will detect the new device and install the correct driver 
with little prompting. If that doesn’t work, it is often just a matter of updating the driver, using driver 
rollback, or adjusting the settings for driver signing. It’s best to check the Internet for new drivers 
whenever you install a new device.
Figure 17-4 Automatic Updates conﬁguration screen

Chapter 17: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Windows
342
Even after a device has been installed, you should check for newer drivers periodically, even 
for devices that have been working ﬁne. Manufacturers occasionally release new drivers aimed at 
optimizing the device or enabling it to work with some new technology. Keep in mind, however, that a 
new driver may cause unexpected problems with your operating system. Because of this, Windows XP 
introduced a feature that enables you to roll back to the previous (working) driver if something should 
go wrong with a driver update. Microsoft attempts to protect the system by qualifying devices and 
drivers through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) and Windows Logo Program and digitally 
signing the drivers as approved for the OS. Driver signing allows you to conﬁgure how the system will 
handle the installation of untested drivers.
One of two wizards will assist you when you need to load a driver: the Found New Hardware Wizard 
or the Add New Hardware Wizard. Windows starts the Found New Hardware Wizard when it discovers 
some new hardware device while booting. If Windows has a driver in its database, it proceeds on its 
own. If not, the Found New Hardware Wizard will prompt you for one. The Add New Hardware Wizard 
enables you to add or update hardware manually at any time. There’s a lot of overlap in how the two 
wizards work, so you’ll look at just the Add New Hardware Wizard, which you can activate at any time.
Learning Objectives
Loading and removing device drivers is one of the basic skills that any good PC tech should have. The 
following lab exercise walks you through the process.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Load a device driver in Windows
• 
Roll back to a previously working driver in Windows XP and Windows Vista
• 
Explore driver signing
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC with Windows XP or Windows Vista installed
• 
An Internet connection
Getting Down to Business
The following labs cover the steps for installing and updating device drivers. You’ll also look at the steps 
to roll back (uninstall) device drivers that turn out to be incompatible, and explore the settings for how 
Windows handles unsigned drivers.
Step 1 The ﬁrst step before you begin installing any new device is to make sure it’s compatible with 
your current Windows OS. It is best to check the http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/
windows-vista / Web site before purchasing a device for your Windows PC.

Lab Exercise 17.03: Installing Device Drivers in Windows
343
Step 2 Now you’ll walk through the process of adding a device using the Add Hardware Wizard:
a. 
From the Control Panel, double-click Add Hardware.
b. 
On the Add Hardware Wizard’s welcome screen, click Next.
✔ Hint
If the wizard doesn’t ﬁnd any new hardware, it asks, “Have you already connected this 
hardware to your computer?” Select Yes or No, and follow the directions.
c. 
Select the device you want to install or update by either selecting from the given list or 
choosing the Add a New Hardware Device item in the list box. For this lab, select the last item 
in the list—Add a new hardware device—and then click Next.
d. 
Click the Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced) option button, and then 
click Next.
e. 
Select the type of hardware you’re trying to install or update from the list. If your device 
doesn’t ﬁt the descriptions, select the Show All Devices item. When you’ve made your 
selection, click Next.
f. 
If you chose the Show All Devices item, the wizard displays the Select the device driver you want 
to install for this hardware screen. If you chose a speciﬁc type of hardware, you’ll be led off into a 
series of options for that type of hardware.
g. 
Choose the Windows driver for your device, or click Have Disk and point to the location of 
the new driver you want to install. This driver generally is located either on the installation 
CD-ROM that came with the device, if you have it, or on your hard drive if you downloaded it 
from the manufacturer’s Web site.
h. 
Click Next. Windows is ready to install the driver.
i. 
Click Next again, and click Finish when the installation is complete.
You should now have a driver that runs your newly loaded device. If the device isn’t working 
properly and you’re sure the driver loaded correctly, you can check online and see if there’s a newer 
driver that you can download from the manufacturer’s Web site.
Step 3 What if you have a device already installed and you want to update the driver to address a 
problem, improve performance, or just add a new feature? This step will take you through updating 
new drivers.
a. 
Begin by locating the updated driver. In most cases, the best way to obtain the updated driver 
is to search the Internet for the manufacturer’s Web site. Search its site for your speciﬁc 
model, and download the most recent driver.
b. 
Go to Device Manager and expand the appropriate device category. Locate the device you want 
to update.

Chapter 17: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Windows
344
c. 
Double-click the device.
d. 
Select the Driver tab and click the Update Driver button (see Figure 17-5). This launches a wizard 
similar to the Add New Hardware Wizard.
✔ Hint
In Windows XP and Vista, you can right-click the device in question in Device Manager and 
update the driver without accessing its properties.
For Windows XP, select Install from a list or speciﬁc location (Advanced) and click Next. Select Include this 
location in the search, and browse to where you have saved the new driver.
For Windows Vista, click Browse my computer for driver software. Then choose Let me pick from a list of device 
drivers on my computer. Click the Have Disk button and then click Browse. You can locate the ﬁle from there.
You may be wondering, “What if I load a new driver, and my system doesn’t work correctly 
anymore?” Well, if you’re using Windows XP or Windows Vista, you’re in luck! Read the next step, and 
your question will be answered.
Figure 17-5 The Windows Vista Update Driver button

Lab Exercise 17.03: Installing Device Drivers in Windows
345
Step 4 If a driver is corrupt or if the wrong driver is installed, Windows has a bad habit of stopping 
dead in its tracks, rendering your PC useless. Windows XP and Vista have a feature that keeps track of 
the drivers you install on a system and allows you to roll back to a previous one when a new one isn’t 
working as it should.
a. 
Go to the Device Manager and locate the device you want to roll back.
b. 
Double-click the device.
c. 
Select the Driver tab. You can revert to the previous driver by clicking Roll Back Driver (see 
Figure 17-6).
Step 5 Windows 2000 introduced a feature for Windows known as driver signing. Driver signing 
veriﬁes that a device driver has been tested by the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) or 
Windows Logo Program and will work with the OS as tested. More important, Windows allows you to 
conﬁgure how the OS will handle unsigned drivers! You can direct Windows to ignore, warn, or block 
new unsigned drivers. The following steps explore this feature:
a. 
In Windows 2000 or XP, open the Control Panel and launch the System applet.
b. 
Click the Hardware tab (see Figure 17-7).
c. 
Click the Driver Signing button to open a dialog box with the various options (see Figure 17-8).
d. 
Select Warn and click OK.

Lab Exercise 17.04: Examining and Conﬁ guring Log Files in Event Viewer
347
Note that these options don’t exist in Windows Vista—you will always be warned about installing 
unsigned drivers. Also, 64-bit versions of Windows do not allow the installation of unsigned drivers at all.
At this point, you should be pretty familiar with drivers and how to load and update them. More 
and more devices are being sold as hot-pluggable, but I doubt that user-installed drivers will be going 
away in the near future.
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 17.04: Examining and Conﬁguring  
Log Files in Event Viewer
Windows Event Viewer is a valuable tool to anyone who maintains or troubleshoots systems. It’s mostly 
run as a standalone program, but it can also be added as a snap-in to the MMC.
Event Viewer monitors various log ﬁles and reveals things about the health of the operating system. 
This utility reports real-time statistics, but normally this data is only used with servers. Desktop 
computer users are less proactive and usually depend on the after-the-fact log ﬁles to help determine 
the cause of a problem.
Event Viewer displays important events from three log ﬁles: Application, Security, and System. 
(More log ﬁles are available in the server versions of Windows.) Figure 17-9 shows the contents of the 
System event log in Event Viewer.
Figure 17-9 Viewing the System log in Event Viewer

Chapter 17: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Windows
348
Notice in Figure 17-9 that there are three kinds of log entries for the System and Application logs: 
Information, Warning, and Error. The Security event log shows two types of entries: Success Audit and 
Failure Audit. These types of events are only logged when auditing is turned on; again, this is normally 
done only on servers.
Learning Objectives
You’ll become familiar with using Event Viewer to analyze the different logs kept by the system.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Run the Event Viewer program
• 
Examine an event log entry
• 
Save the event log
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC with Windows installed
Getting Down to Business
In Windows 2000 and XP, you can start Event Viewer from the Control Panel by double-clicking the 
Administrative Tools applet and then double-clicking Event Viewer. In Windows Vista, go to the Search 
box in the Start menu and type Event Viewer. Click the program that appears in the search results.
Step 1 Follow these steps to change the size of a log ﬁle:
a. 
In Event Viewer’s left panel, right-click System and select Properties.
b. 
Change the number in the Maximum log size box to 1024 KB (512 is the default) and select 
Overwrite events as needed (see Figure 17-10).
c. 
Do this for all three event logs: Application, Security, and System.
d. 
Sometimes the log can be completely full before you get a chance to look at the entries. 
Scrolling through all the events can be a little boring and time consuming, but you can ﬁx 
that with ﬁlter settings. Click the Filter tab, and look at the ﬁlter settings (see Figure 17-11).
You can ﬁlter events based on type, source, category, ID, user, computer, and date. This only controls 
what Event Viewer displays; all the events information will still be logged to the ﬁle, so you can change 
your mind about ﬁlter settings. Click OK to close the Properties dialog box.
Step 2 To clear, archive, and open a log ﬁle, follow these steps:
a. 
Clear the System log by right-clicking System and selecting Clear all Events (see Figure 17-12).
b. 
When you’re prompted to save the System log, click Yes.

Lab Exercise 17.04: Examining and Conﬁ guring Log Files in Event Viewer

c. 
You can archive log ﬁles using different ﬁlenames each time (recommended) and select a 
location other than the default. Give your ﬁle a name you can remember and save it.
d. 
To open a saved ﬁle, click the Action menu and select Open Log File. Select the ﬁle and log type 
(System, Application, or Security) and click Open.

Lab Exercise 17.05: Using the Advanced Options 
Menu and the Recovery Console
An errant upgrade or a poorly written driver can cause the system to lock up. Some software problems, 
such as corrupt Registry ﬁles, will even prevent the system from booting. This means that you must be 
ready to use alternative methods to boot the system to make repairs or replace ﬁles.
Windows has several ways to boot, and these ways are as different as the operating systems themselves. 
A Safe Mode boot is available in every version of Windows. There’s also a nice recovery tool that comes with 
Windows 2000 and Windows XP known as the Recovery Console. Windows Vista uses the System Recovery 
Options on the bootable installation media. One of the options available is access to the Command Prompt, 
which works just like the Recovery Console, but with more power.
Learning Objectives
You’ll become familiar with alternative methods of booting a faulty system.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Boot to Windows’ Advanced Options Menu and enable Safe Mode
• 
Install the Recovery Console
• 
Repair the Registry using the Recovery Console/Command Prompt

Lab Exercise 17.05: Using the Advanced Options Menu and the Recovery Console

Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC with Windows 2000 or XP installed (preferably a non-production system, as you 
will be corrupting and repairing the Registry)
• 
The Windows 2000/XP installation media
Getting Down to Business
If your system won’t boot normally because of some system problem, you need a way to gain access to 
the hard drive and your ﬁles to troubleshoot the problem. There are, happily enough, troubleshooting 
tools that give you access to these ﬁles if the normal boot process won’t work. You’ll begin this exercise 
with the ﬁrst line of defense, the Advanced Options Menu, and boot to Safe Mode. You will then install 
and explore the Recovery Console, eventually repairing the Registry manually.
Step 1 Power up a machine with Windows installed. After the POST messages, but before the 
Windows logo screen appears, press F8. Depending on your system, you will see a number of different 
boot options. Record the various modes and provide a short description for each:
✔ Cross-Reference
For deﬁnitions of each of the boot modes, refer to the “Advanced Startup Options” section in 
Chapter 17 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Step 2 Select Safe Mode and press ENTER.
The system will proceed to boot into the operating system, but it will inform you many times that it 
is running in Safe Mode (see Figure 17-13).
Safe Mode is often used when video settings have been changed and render the display unusable. In 
Safe Mode, a standard VGA driver is installed, and the minimal settings (16 colors, 640×480 resolution) 

Chapter 17: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Windows
352
are set. This enables you to revert to previous drivers, and/or correct the settings for the current display 
or monitor you are using. Complete the following steps to explore the display properties:
a. 
Right-click somewhere in the empty space of the desktop and select Properties from the 
drop-down menu. This brings up the Display Properties dialog box.
b. 
Click the Settings tab and note the display, color, and screen resolution settings. Record your 
settings here: ________________________________________________________________
c. 
Click Cancel to close the Display Properties dialog box.
d. 
Click Start | Shut down.
Step 3 Next, you will explore using the Repair menu item from the Windows installation media to 
launch the Recovery Console.
a. 
Insert the Windows installation disc and then reboot the system, making sure your CMOS is 
set to boot from your optical drive. The installation program loads a number of ﬁles and then 
displays a screen with the following information. These steps were completed using a Windows

2000 Professional installation, but a Windows XP installation will be very similar. The steps 
for accessing Windows Vista’s System Recovery Options follow.
 Welcome to Setup 
 This portion of the Setup program prepares Microsoft 
 Windows 2000™ to run on your computer 
      To set up Windows 2000 now, Press ENTER. 
      To repair a Windows 2000 installation, press R. 
      To quit Setup without installing Windows 2000, press F3.
b. 
Because the operating system is already installed, press R to select the Repair function. The 
next screen offers two choices:
To repair a Windows 2000 installation by using 
       the recovery console, press C. 
To repair a Windows 2000 installation by using 
       the emergency repair process, press R.
c. 
Press C to open the Recovery Console.
You’ll now see a command-line interface asking which installation you want to access. If you have 
a dual-boot system, you’ll have to choose an operating system; type its number from the list and press 
ENTER. Then type the administrator’s password. This is the password for the first account created when 
you initially installed the operating system. You now have a command-line prompt from which to work.
✖ Warning
Be sure you know what you’re doing here. You have access to ﬁles that you can add, change, 
rename, or delete. The old DOS command set is only partially available.
d. 
To see a list of commands, type help and note the results.
e. 
Type a command followed by /? to get an explanation of that command. You’ll explore some of 
these commands later when you install the Windows XP Recovery Console.
➜ Note
The Recovery Console operates very similarly to the Windows Command Line that you learned 
about in Chapter 15.
f. 
Type exit to quit the Recovery Console; the system will reboot.
To access the Command Prompt through Windows Vista’s System Recovery Options, follow these steps:
a. 
Boot from the installation media. After you choose your language settings, click Next.

Chapter 17: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Windows
354
b. 
Select Repair your computer and then click Next. The System Recovery Options menu should appear.
c. 
From the list of options, choose the Command Prompt.
Step 4 Although you can run the Recovery Console by booting directly to it from the Windows 2000/
XP installation disc, it’s much more convenient to set it up as a startup option on your boot menu (see 
Figure 17-14). In this step, you’ll install the Windows XP Recovery Console as a boot option. You can do 
the same thing using the same steps for Windows 2000. (Windows Vista’s System Recovery Options are 
either preinstalled or located on the installation media.)
✔ Hint
To install the Recovery Console, you must have administrative rights on the computer.
a. 
Put your Windows XP (or Windows 2000) installation CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive; if it 
autostarts, select Exit. You can also press and hold SHIFT until the CD-ROM stops loading.
b. 
Select Start | Run.
c. 
In the Open box, type D:\I386\WINNT32.EXE /CMDCONS (where D is the drive letter for your 
CD-ROM drive).
d. 
A Windows Setup dialog box appears, which describes the Recovery Console option. The system 
prompts you to conﬁrm installation. Click Yes to start the installation procedure.
e. 
When the installation is complete (see Figure 17-15), restart the computer. You will see a 
Microsoft Windows Recovery Console entry on the boot menu.
Figure 17-15 Completing the Recovery Console installation in Windows XP
Figure 17-14 Recovery Console option in Windows 2000 startup

Lab Exercise 17.05: Using the Advanced Options Menu and the Recovery Console
355
➜ Note
When you’re installing the Recovery Console, you must use a Windows installation CD-ROM with 
the same version of Windows that was used for the system’s main OS installation. For example, 
if you used a Windows XP Service Pack 2 CD-ROM to install Windows on this system, you cannot 
use a pre–Service Pack 2 CD-ROM for this procedure.
It’s wise to install the Recovery Console on important servers and on critical workstations.
Step 5 For Windows 2000/XP machines, reboot your system, and at the boot menu screen, select 
the Recovery Console. For Windows Vista users, either boot from the installation media and open the 
System Recovery Options, or open the Advanced Boot Options menu and access it there. Then open the 
Command Prompt.
To see a list of the commands, type help at the command prompt. Type a command followed by /? 
to get an explanation of the command’s use.
Several commands are worth reviewing; for the CompTIA A+ exams, you should know what the 
following commands do:
• 
CHKDSK Checks the clusters and sectors of a disk (ﬁxed or removable) and, if possible, 
repairs bad clusters or sectors
• 
DISKPART The Windows 2000 equivalent to FDISK
• 
EXIT Closes the Recovery Console and restarts your computer
• 
EXPAND Extracts copies of single ﬁles from the CAB ﬁles
• 
FIXBOOT Writes a new partition table
• 
FIXMBR Equivalent to FDISK /MBR
• 
HELP Displays a Help screen
✔ Hint
Many techs resort to the Recovery Console when a system fails to boot in the normal fashion 
(from the hard drive). Three of the commands, FIXBOOT, FIXMBR, and CHKDSK, are particularly 
important when it seems that the hard disk, the master boot record, or the system partition are 
missing, corrupt, or damaged. If you come across a system exhibiting these symptoms (and you will), 
follow good troubleshooting procedures, but remember that you have these tools available to you.

Chapter 17: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Windows
356
➜ Note
Windows Vista replaced FIXMBR and FIXBOOT with the BOOTREC command. They are still 
functionally identical, but to access them, you must use BOOTREC /FIXMBR and BOOTREC  
/FIXBOOT. Other available options include /SCANOS, which scans for Windows installations not 
in the boot conﬁguration store, and /REBUILDBCD, which does the same but allows you to add 
the installation to the boot conﬁguration store.
The ﬁles that make up the Recovery Console reside on the system partition, making the Recovery 
Console useless for a system partition crash. In such a situation, you would use the optical drive to 
access the Recovery Console/Command Prompt. The Recovery Console/Command Prompt shines in the 
business of manually restoring Registry ﬁles, stopping problem services, rebuilding partitions (other 
than the system partition), or using the EXPAND program to extract copies of corrupted ﬁles from 
removable media.
Step 6 As mentioned in the previous step, the Recovery Console/Command Prompt is excellent 
when you need to restore Registry ﬁles. In the following steps, you will crash a system by deleting the 
SYSTEM folder, and then repair the folder and recover the system.
✖ Warning
As mentioned in the “Lab Materials and Setup” section for this lab exercise, you are going to 
purposefully delete/corrupt the SYSTEM folder of a working Windows system. For this reason, 
the system you use must be a noncritical, non-production system. Don’t risk your family’s 
ﬁnancial records or your 40-GB photo archive—ﬁnd another system to use for this exercise!
✔ Cross-Reference
The following steps use many components of Windows and the Recovery Console/Command 
Prompt. To understand better the ﬁles, folders, and Registry components involved, be sure 
to read the “Registry” section in Chapter 17 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and 
Troubleshooting PCs.
Microsoft has also gathered invaluable information in their Knowledge Base articles  
(a component of TechNet). The following lab steps incorporate valuable information from 
Knowledge Base articles 307545 and 309531. As previously mentioned, Web sites change over 
time, so if you don’t ﬁnd these exact articles, use your favorite search engine and locate similar 
articles related to the Recovery Console/Command Prompt and repairing the Registry.

Lab Exercise 17.05: Using the Advanced Options Menu and the Recovery Console
357
a. 
Some preparation may be required to complete the steps to corrupt and restore your Registry 
folders. In Windows 2000/XP, open My Computer, then select Tools | Folder Options. In 
Windows Vista, select Start, then type Folder Options in the Start Search box and press ENTER. 
Click the View tab. Turn on Show hidden ﬁles and folders, turn off Hide extensions for known ﬁle types, 
and turn off Hide protected operating system ﬁles (Recommended). Click OK.
b. 
Boot to the Recovery Console/Command Prompt, and after logging on as Administrator (if 
needed), type the following commands at the prompt:
MD C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\TMP 
COPY C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\TMP\SYSTEM.BAK 
DELETE C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM 
EXIT
c. 
At this point the Recovery Console/Command Prompt closes. Restart Windows. Allow Windows 
to boot normally. Did anything inhibit the normal loading and startup of Windows?  
___________________________________________________________________________
d. 
Boot to the Recovery Console/Command Prompt once again, log on as Administrator  
(if needed), and type the following commands at the prompt:
COPY C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\REPAIR\SYSTEM C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTE32\CONFIG\SYSTEM 
EXIT
e. 
The Recovery Console/Command Prompt again closes. Reboot Windows. Allow Windows to boot 
normally. Did Windows boot properly this time? _____________________________________
➜ Note
Windows Vista’s System Recovery Options also includes a handy tool called Startup Repair. It is 
able to scan your computer for any problems and automatically repair them. The next time you 
think you need to delve into Vista’s Command Prompt to ﬁx any startup-related troubles, try 
Startup Repair ﬁrst—it might just save you from having to type all of those backslashes!
➜ Try This: Create a Batch File to Restore a Corrupted Registry
Though ﬂoppy drives are becoming scarce, the use of the Recovery Console and some form of 
accessible, removable media will enable you to semi-automate the restoration of the critical 
Registry folders. Create the following batch ﬁle and save it to a ﬂoppy disk.
 
1.  Open a text editor, type the following lines of code exactly, and save your work as a text ﬁle 
(located on a ﬂoppy disk) called MyRegBak.txt:
MD TMP
COPY C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\TMP\SYSTEM.BAK
COPY C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SOFTWARE C:\%SYSTEMROOT%\TMP\SOFTWARE.BAK

Lab Exercise 17.06: Troubleshooting Startup Problems
When it comes to troubleshooting tools, the latest versions of Windows inherited the best of both the 
Windows NT and 9x OS families. They have vintage tools such as the Last Known Good Conﬁguration 
startup option for startup failures and the Task Manager for forcing errant programs to close. There is 
also the Recovery Console/Command Prompt, and Windows Help.
I’ll leave the ﬁner details of these tools for you to explore through Windows Help, the main textbook, 
and other labs. In this lab, you’ll explore a simple tool known as the System Conﬁguration utility. The 
System Conﬁguration utility has been around for some time, having been introduced in Windows 98. It 
was never incorporated into Windows NT or 2000, but it is included in Windows XP and Windows Vista/7.

You’ll be reintroduced to some troubleshooting tips using a vintage tool with Windows XP.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use the System Conﬁguration utility to perform diagnostic startups

Getting Down to Business
Many systems have way too many startup options enabled. This isn’t only a source of boot problems; 
it can also slow down the boot process and hog RAM from programs that need it. When Windows 
experiences failures during startup, consider using the System Conﬁguration utility to discover and ﬁx 
the problem.
Step 1 In Windows XP, select Start | Run, type msconﬁg, and then press ENTER. In Windows Vista, 
select Start, type msconﬁg into the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
The System Conﬁguration utility opens (see Figure 17-16).
Figure 17-16 Using the System Conﬁguration utility

Chapter 17: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Windows
360
Notice that on the General tab, you can select Diagnostic Startup. This is useful if you have just 
added new hardware that’s causing intermittent problems, because it enables you to boot with only 
basic devices.
The Selective Startup feature is also nice; it lets you bypass some conﬁguration ﬁles to see which 
one contains the errors that are causing problems.
Notice the SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI tabs, which provide settings that enable you to change the load 
sequence of your drivers and edit the entries when you ﬁnd an error.
➜ Note
The SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI tabs are not present in Windows Vista.
Step 2 The BOOT.INI tab (labeled Boot in Windows Vista) is powerful (see Figure 17-17) and goes well 
beyond the CompTIA A+ exam requirements, but there are a couple of options you should know about.
One important option for troubleshooting is to create a log of what transpired during the boot 
process. On the BOOT.INI tab, you can enable a BOOTLOG to be created each time the system boots.
Figure 17-17 The BOOT.INI tab

Lab Exercise 17.06: Troubleshooting Startup Problems
361
If you’re troubleshooting a problem and you need to start in Safe Mode every time, instead of 
pressing F8, you can enable the /SAFEBOOT option.
Step 3 One item that I ﬁnd useful is under the Services tab. Microsoft has many services that you 
can disable during bootup if you believe they’re causing problems. The Hide All Microsoft Services 
option, when enabled, only displays those services you’ve installed—like my VMware Tools Service 
driver in Figure 17-18.
Step 4 The Startup tab is perhaps the most useful. You can enable or disable any of the Terminate 
and Stay Resident (TSR) programs that are installed. This is a good place to look if some unexplained 
program is trying to load every time you boot, even though you thought you’d uninstalled it.
Notice in Figure 17-19 that one program on the list doesn’t have a name. I’m kind of suspicious about 
what this program might be doing! If you ﬁnd questionable entries in your Startup tab listing, you 
should ﬁre up a browser and do some research to see whether or not they’re harmful.
✔ Hint
You can also run the System Conﬁguration utility in Safe Mode. If you’re having problems, you 
can boot to Safe Mode and then use this utility to identify the source of the problem.

Lab Exercise 17.07: Working with  
Windows System Restore
The prior labs dealt with upgrading Windows and optimizing device drivers. In some cases, installing a 
service pack or updating a device driver can cause problems, in which case the best thing you can do is 
to put the system back to the state it was in before you started. You’ve already worked with Safe Mode 
and the Recovery Console/Command Prompt when the system will not boot; this lab focuses on restoring 
the system to a previously working state when you can still access the system.

Windows has a great utility to help you restore your system after a botched program or driver 
installation. It watches for any system changes and basically records them in a diary. To restore a system 
to a previous state, you can just open the diary and point to a date and time to which you want to return.
Step 1 In this step, you’ll manually create a restore point in Windows. The OS automatically creates 
restore points each day, as well as any time you install an application, update a driver, or add a piece 
of hardware. In Windows XP, you also have the option to create your own restore points whenever you 
want and give them unique names that are meaningful to you. You might decide to create a restore 
point before tweaking a bunch of settings in the Display applet, for example, and name the restore 
point “VideoBack” in case your changes should have a dire effect on your video display.
a. 
To create a restore point (Windows XP only), select Start | All Programs | Accessories | System Tools | 
System Restore to open the System Restore utility (see Figure 17-20).
b. 
At the welcome screen, choose Create a restore point on the right side of the screen and click Next.
c. 
Type My Test Restore Point and then click Create.
d. 
The system takes some time building the restore ﬁle information and then displays a conﬁrmation 
screen (see Figure 17-21). Click Close to exit the System Restore utility.
Figure 17-20 Using System Restore

Chapter 17: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Windows
364
You’re done! That was easy, wasn’t it?
Step 2 To restore the system to an earlier time, return to the System Restore utility, but this time, 
select Restore my computer to an earlier time in Windows XP. In Windows Vista, access System Restore by 
typing System Restore into the Start Search box and pressing ENTER. Then click Next.
When you click the Next button, the Select a Restore Point screen displays, with a calendar view 
of restore points in Windows XP (see Figure 17-22) and a list view in Windows Vista. Based on your 
knowledge of when your system started having problems, select a restore point and follow the prompts 
to complete the restore operation.
System Restore is pretty powerful. Even if you crash hard and can only boot to Safe Mode, you can 
still run the System Restore utility to recover your system. It sure beats the alternative!

One of the most important functions in any type of computing is 
getting information (data) in and out of the computer system. If it 
weren’t for data moving in and out, your computer would be a boring 
(and pretty useless) device! You need two items to make input/output 
work on your PC: a peripheral device and a way to connect that peripheral 
device to your system unit. The typical desktop PC comes with a number 
of peripherals: keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, speakers, and often a 
cable that runs to a network. These peripherals all come with some form 
of cabling/connection system.
Many of these connections are unique pairings. For example, a monitor 
uses either a 15-pin VESA (also called VGA) connector or a DVI connector, 
whereas a sound card uses S/PDIF or mini-RCA connectorsyou won’t 
see any other device commonly using these types of connectors. CompTIA 
wants you to have a solid understanding of these types of peripherals and 
their unique connections: printers using parallel connections, networks 
using twisted-pair cabling, monitors using VGA or DVI, and speakers 
using mini-RCA or S/PDIF. Entire chapters of this lab manual address 
these speciﬁc peripherals in more detail, but there’s much more to the 
world of input/output than just those devices.
The most common PC input devices are keyboards and mice. Other, 
more exotic input devices include scanners, touch screens, and biometric 
readers. More general-purpose connections used by many types of 
peripherals include serial, USB, and FireWire. This chapter takes a look at 
those “other” peripherals and connections that don’t really ﬁt well into 
any of the other chapters.

Lab Exercise 18.01: Exploring USB Drivers
USB’s incredible ease of use makes it the most popular type of general-purpose connection used on 
PCs. USB is so popular that every type of peripheral (other than monitors) has someone making a USB 
version. The downside to this ease of use is that it can be a challenge to deal with USB when it doesn’t 
work as speciﬁed.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Diagnose and repair common USB driver failures
• 
Recognize the limitations of built-in Windows USB device drivers
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A Windows system using USB
• 
At least one “human interface” USB device, such as a mouse or keyboard
• 
At least one mass storage USB device, such as a USB thumb drive
• 
At least one USB device that is neither a human interface device nor a mass storage device (for 
example, a wired NIC, Bluetooth hub, wireless NIC, or PDA synching cradle)
• 
A notepad and pencil
Getting Down to Business
The biggest problems you’ll see with USB are the result of improper drivers. If you know how to 
recognize these problems from error messages or by using third-party tools, you shouldn’t have too 
much trouble ﬁxing them.
Windows comes with very good built-in support for what it calls human interface devices (HIDs), 
such as keyboards and mice. It also does a good job supporting most USB mass storage devices such as 
USB thumb drives. However, once you move outside these two classes of devices, Windows really needs 
the drivers supplied by the manufacturer to work properly, if at all.
✔ Cross-Reference
For more information on setting up USB devices, refer to the “USB Conﬁguration” section in 
Chapter 18 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.

Step 1 Connect any HID or mass storage USB device to the Windows system, without ﬁrst installing 
the supplied driver. Does the device work as expected? Is it missing any features? Does the device even 
come with drivers? Write down your conclusions and unplug the device.
Step 2 Check the Web site of the manufacturer of the USB device you just installed to see if a driver 
exists. If there is a driver, download it and install it into your system. Now connect the device again. 
Does the device work the same as it did before?
Step 3 Select another USB device—speciﬁcally, one that is neither a HID nor a mass storage device—
and connect it to the same system without ﬁrst installing the supplied driver. Does the device work 
as expected? Is it missing any features? Does the device even come with drivers? Write down your 
conclusions and unplug the device.
Step 4 Check the Web site of the manufacturer of the USB device you just installed to see if a driver 
exists. If there is a driver, download it and install it into your system. Did the installation work? In 
many cases installation will fail because Windows may have loaded an improper driver when you ﬁrst 
installed the device. Does the device work the same as before? You’ll probably ﬁnd that it doesn’t, for 
the same reason.
Step 5 Go to the manufacturer’s Web site and see how to remove the device driver properly. Delete 
the driver and then remove the device.

Lab Exercise 18.02: USBDeview
371
✔ Hint
Installing a USB device without ﬁrst installing the proper driver on a non-HID or mass storage 
device will almost always require you to uninstall the USB device completely from Device 
Manager. Even so, you should still check the manufacturer’s Web site ﬁrst!
Step 6 With the previous drivers properly removed, again install the drivers you downloaded earlier. 
Then insert the USB device. Does the device work as expected? Are there features now that did not 
appear earlier? What does this tell you about the importance of installing USB device drivers before 
you install the actual USB device?
Step 7 As time and available hardware allow, practice installing other USB devices and document 
how they work, both with and without proper drivers.

Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A Windows system using USB
• 
A copy of Nir Sofer’s USBDeview utility (www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html)
• 
At least one USB hub
• 
A notepad and pencil
This lab is very ﬂexible in terms of the types of USB (Low-Speed, Full-Speed, Hi-Speed, SuperSpeed) 
supported on the system, as well as the number and type of USB devices. Add as many USB devices as 
possible (you can have up to 127 devices per USB controller, so knock yourself out!), and try to get at 
least one USB hub, either powered or unpowered. The more USB devices and hubs you can get, the more 
interesting this lab becomes.
Getting Down to Business
Using the USBDeview program, you can view detailed information about your USB controllers and the 
devices currently running on them.
Step 1 Start the PC with as few USB devices physically installed as possible.
Step 2 Make sure a copy of USBDeview is on the system. USBDeview is a freestanding executable ﬁle 
and does not require installation. Place the ﬁle on your Windows desktop for easy access.
Step 3 Open Device Manager and count all the USB controllers (see Figure 18-1). On older systems you 
should see two types of controllers: a Standard OpenHCD Host Controller and a Standard Enhanced Host 
Controller. Newer systems will use different names such as “Universal Host Controller” and “Enhanced 
Controller.” Do you see two different types of USB controllers?
Step 4 To get the most out of USBDeview, you need to do some setup. First, go to www.linux-usb.org/
usb.ids and save the Web page as usb.ids in the same folder that holds the USBDeview.exe ﬁle. Next, 
start USBDeview and select View | Choose columns. Make sure your ﬁrst two columns are Vendor Name 
and Product Name. Then click Options and uncheck Display Disconnected Devices. When you’re done, 
USBDeview should look something like Figure 18-2.
Great! Time to work. Compare what you see in Device Manager to what you see in USBDeview. How 
do they compare? Do you see any differences? Count the ports reported by USBDeview and compare that 
to the actual number of ports on your system. Are the numbers the same?

✔ Hint
Sometimes, running USBDeview and Device Manager at the same time will confuse Device 
Manager. If you’re having problems, just close and reopen USBDeview as needed.
Step 5 Insert a USB device, making sure to install the correct drivers ﬁrst. USBDeview should update 
as soon as the device is inserted. Document which USB host controller (look under the Device Name 
column; USBDeview uses the term “hub” when it should say “controller”) and port are running the 
device. Unplug the device and reinsert it into a different USB port. Document the changes. Is it on a 
different controller (hub)? Is it on a different port? 
Step 6 Repeat Step 5 for other USB devices until all of your USB devices are in use.

Lab Exercise 18.03: Paging Dr. Keyboard!
Keyboards are plentiful and common, and a new basic keyboard is very inexpensive. Even with cheap 
keyboards, users tend to get attached to these devices over time—and in the case of an expensive 
keyboard with lots of extra buttons and features, the user may have both a ﬁnancial and an emotional 
attachment! For these reasons, it’s important that you learn to play “Dr. Keyboard,” ﬁxing these devices 
when they break.

In this exercise, you’ll dismantle one or more keyboards, cleaning up the keyboard components in the 
process before reassembling the device(s) and testing for functionality.
Step 1 Disconnect the keyboard from the Windows system. Try prying off two or three keys using the 
ﬂathead screwdriver (see Figure 18-3). Include more difﬁcult keys such as the SPACEBAR, ENTER/RETURN, 
and a key from the center of the keyboard such as the letter G. Inspect the bottom of the key and the 
key post that it sits onhow much dirt is there? Reinsert the keys, making sure they are snapped all 
the way down.
Step 2 Test the keyboard by plugging it into a Windows system. If any of the keys you removed 
aren’t working, double-check that they’re properly snapped in. Shut down the system and remove the 
keyboard. Repeat this process until all keys are working.

➜ Note
What should you do if you break a key? Well, nobody sells replacement parts for keyboards—
they’re just too darn cheap to bother! You might be lucky enough to have a nonworking 
keyboard that’s the exact same model, which you can cannibalize; otherwise, just consign the 
affected keyboard to the scrap heap after you’ve used it for this lab.
Step 3 Insert the nozzle of the compressed air under a key and start blasting away. If the keyboard is 
really old or looks dirty, you may want to do this outside! Did you see any dust or crumbs come out?
Step 4 Completely dismantle the keyboard. Most keyboards have a number of screws underneath that 
you must ﬁrst remove to begin this process. Inspect the screwsare they different sizes? Keep track of 
which screw goes into which hole.
Step 5 The inside of the keyboard will have a number of plastic contact templates (see Figure 18-4). 
Remove these, keeping track of their relation to each other so you can reassemble them. Wipe down 
each template with the lint-free cloth dampened with water. If you run into serious dirt, add a bit of 
mild detergent and repeat until the keyboard is clean.
✔ Hint
All keyboards have small circuit boards inside as well. Don’t get them wet!

Few components affect the PC user like the video system, the primary 
output for the PC. As you know from the textbook, the video system has 
two main hardware components—monitor and display adapter—that 
work together to produce the image on your screen. Both components 
must be installed and conﬁgured properly in Windows, or your viewing 
pleasure will be seriously compromised. Good techs know how to do video 
right!
In this set of labs, you’ll install a display adapter, hook up a monitor, 
load video drivers, and conﬁgure Windows for optimal viewing. You’ll 
then work with the growing practice of using multiple monitors (for 
example, a projector and a laptop screen) to expand your desktop viewing 
area. The last lab exercise will run you through some of the typical 
troubleshooting issues that techs face when dealing with video.
✖ Warning
It is critical to understand that only trained monitor technicians should remove the cover of a 
video monitor (or a television set, for that matter). The inside of a traditional monitor might 
look similar to the interior of a PC, with printed circuit boards and related components, but 
there’s a big difference: No PC has voltages up to 50,000 volts or more inside, but most CRT 
monitors do. So be sure to get one thing clear—casually opening a monitor and snooping 
around has the potential to become harmful to you and the monitor—and in cases of extreme 
carelessness, it can even be deadly! Even when the power is disconnected, certain components 
(capacitors) still retain substantial levels of voltage for an extended period of time. Capacitors 
work like batteries. Yes, they can maintain 50,000 volts! If you inadvertently short one of the 
capacitors, a large discharge will occur into the monitor circuits, destroying them. If you’re 
touching the metal frame, you could fry yourself—to death. Given this risk, certain aspects 
of monitor repair fall outside the necessary skill set for a standard PC support person, and 
deﬁnitely outside the CompTIA A+ exam domains. Make sure you understand the problems you 
can ﬁx safely and the ones you need to hand over to a qualiﬁed electronics repair shop.

Some versions of Microsoft Windows have problems when you make changes to the video display 
adapters, even when you’re simply removing and reinstalling the same card into a different 
slot. If you perform this lab on a test machine, you should have no real problem if things go 
wrong. If you’re using your primary PC to do the lab, however, make certain you have current 
drivers available for your video card, or a source to get drivers if necessary.

conﬁguration, the 15-pin connector will appear in line with the PS/2 and USB ports. If your 
system uses this type of display adapter, the overall performance of the system may suffer 
because the display typically “steals” 64 MB or more of system RAM to serve as video RAM. 
Not only is this a small amount of video RAM for today’s PC applications, it also lowers the 
total amount of system RAM available for the system. Laptops are usually designed around this 
limitation, but if your desktop system is of this type, you can improve the performance (and 
usually the video quality) by installing a display adapter card and disabling the onboard video 
in the BIOS. Typically, you can also balance between video and system performance by selecting 
how much memory is allocated to the onboard video in BIOS.
b. 
Detach the monitor’s cable from the video card.
 
Using good ESD avoidance procedures, remove the screw that holds the card in place, put it in 
a secure location, and then remove your video display adapter card (see Figure 19-1). Examine 
it closely to answer the following questions. Be careful not to touch the expansion slot contacts 
on the card!
c. 
Look for a name or model number on the adapter’s circuit board or chipset.

Lab Exercise 19.01: Installing Video
383
 
Who is the manufacturer, or what is the model number? Write it down. (Note that for this 
lab’s scenario, you’d actually be looking up the information for the new video cards, not the 
ones already installed—those will most likely be donated to charity!)
 
___________________________________________________________________________
 
Be sure to write down as much information as you can collect from the display adapter for a 
later assignment.
d. 
Reinsert the video card into the same slot, and make sure it is properly seated. Reattach the 
monitor cable and test your system with the case still open to see if it works. This could save 
you the frustration that results when you close the case, ﬁre up the system, and get a video 
error. (Not that I’ve ever done that!)
✔ Hint
AGP and PCIe cards can be a little tricky. They must be seated perfectly or they will not work. 
Many of these types of cards use slots with locking levers—if you were observant when 
you removed the card initially, you’ll know what you have to do now for proper physical 
installation.
e. 
Boot your system and open your favorite browser to search the Web.
 
Conduct your search using the information you’ve gathered about the manufacturer and model 
number of your card.
 
Can you ﬁnd the speciﬁcations for your display adapter? ______________________________
Figure 19-1 This video card has a large cooling fan for the 
graphics processing unit (GPU) and its onboard RAM chips.

What is the highest resolution you can achieve with your video adapter according to these 
speciﬁcations? _______________________________________________________________
 
How much memory is available? _________________________________________________
 
What type of memory is used? ___________________________________________________
 
Does the adapter support SLI or CrossFire? __________________________________________
 
Does the adapter have any features that are unusual or unfamiliar to you, such as an HDMI 
connector? ___________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
Step 2 Reboot your system and press the proper key sequence to enter the CMOS setup utility. 
Depending on the BIOS manufacturer and version, there can be as many as ﬁve or more video-related 
settings. My lab system has ten settings directly related to video or the PCIe slot. Complete each of 
these questions based on your speciﬁc BIOS. Some of the names of the sections will undoubtedly differ 
from the ones presented here. Search around a bit and you’ll ﬁnd video options in your CMOS.
 On the Standard CMOS Setup or similar screen, how many choices are there for video, and how is 
your video set? ___________________________________________________________________
 On the Chipset Features Setup or similar screen, what is the value for your Video RAM Cacheable 
setting? _________________________________________________________________________
Are there any PCIe-speciﬁc settings? ___________________________________________________
 Are there any settings for the amount of RAM the onboard adapter will use?  
________________________________________________________________________________
 On the Power Management Setup or similar screen, do you have settings to control how the monitor 
and video adapter will react when not in use for a period of time? What are your settings?  
________________________________________________________________________________
 On the Integrated Peripherals or similar screen, do you have an Init Display First setting? What are 
the choices? ______________________________________________________________________
What does your setting say? _________________________________________________________
Know that when this setting is wrong, the monitor display might not work.
Step 3 You’ll now examine a monitor and see what external controls it has. If you’re not in a 
computer lab, you can go to your local computer store and examine a wide variety of monitors.
Figures 19-2 and 19-3 show the control buttons for adjusting the display attributes for an LCD and a 
CRT monitor, respectively. Both of these have the controls on the front of the monitor, but some have the 
controls behind a door under the front of the monitor screen, and others may have them on the back.

Play with the controls of your monitor or a test monitor. If the current settings use percentages, 
write down the settings before doing any adjustments. Then follow these steps:
a. 
Change the settings such as color and sizing. Don’t be shy!
b. 
Put the settings back as close as possible to their original positions.
c. 
Optimize the screen for clarity and position.
Step 4 The hardware is set up properly and the BIOS settings should be correct, so now you need to 
conﬁgure and optimize the Windows settings that determine your video display characteristics. To do 
this, you need to use the Display applet.
✔ Hint
This lab simulates a working PC that you upgrade with new hardware and drivers. All the steps 
can work just as well for installing a video card into a new system, although the pace of that 
installation would differ. In a new system, you would physically install the video card, let 
Windows use generic VGA drivers until you make sure you can boot properly, and only then 
install the drivers for the video card. Finally, you’d go to the Display applet and optimize the 
video card settings. Windows is fairly good at ﬁnding a suitable driver the ﬁrst time around, but 
you should still understand how to locate and update drivers for your video card.
In Windows 2000/XP, navigate to the Display applet and click the Settings tab. In Windows Vista, 
go to Control Panel | Personalization | Display Settings. This displays the monitor settings, such as those 
shown in Figure 19-4.
✖ Warning
You’re going to make changes to the look and feel of Windows. Making some of these changes 
can result in frustrating and time-consuming problems. Use a test machine if you have one 
available. If you must use your own machine, write down all your display settings before you 
make any changes.
Each video display adapter manufacturer has different options for its cards. By clicking the 
Advanced button, you can access more information about the display adapter. You may see a choice for 
setting the refresh rate, as well as other features. Look through the settings on the Advanced tab, and 
see what your display adapter manufacturer provides. Remember that the video adapter “pushes” the 
monitor. If you set the refresh too high, it can cause problems, and in the case of older CRTs may even 
damage your monitor.
Write down your display’s current resolution, color depth, and refresh rate.

Chapter 19: Video
388
Close the Advanced dialog box (if you selected it), but leave the Display Properties dialog box open.
Make some changes to the background and colors on your screen. You’ll ﬁnd these options on the 
Desktop and Appearance tabs, respectively. Be sure to note the original settings so you can change things 
back when you’re done.
✔ Hint
The setting changes suggested in this step are perfectly safe and easy to undo.
Change the desktop background to something you might like better. Then try the following:
• 
Experiment with color combinations.
• 
Make some changes to the displayed fonts and menu bars.
• 
Experiment with changing the colors and resolution of your display.
Can your machine run in 16-bit color? __________
How about 24-bit color? _____________________
Can you run 800 × 600 resolution? _____________

Can you run 1024 × 768 resolution? _____________
Can you run 1280 × 960 resolution? _____________
Do you have any other options? _______________
In Windows 2000/XP, click the Advanced button again. In Windows Vista, click Advanced Settings 
and open the Monitor tab. Experiment with changing the refresh rate (see Figure 19-5).
✔ Hint
Because of the way that LCD monitors work, the refresh rate setting doesn’t really apply to 
them. As a general rule, LCD monitors display a stable, ﬂicker-free image at 60 hertz (Hz). There 
are no visible differences between 85 Hz and 60 Hz.
Can you make speciﬁc numeric changes? _________
Are the Optimal and Adapter Default settings the only choices you have? __________
Figure 19-5 A typical refresh setting under Display 
Properties

Chapter 19: Video
390
✔ Hint
The refresh rate is not an option on all video adapters. This setting may be in a different 
location, or not on your system at all.
Make sure you return all the settings to their original values, and then close the Display Properties 
dialog box.
Check the drivers for your video card and monitor. Are they “standard” drivers, or are they speciﬁc 
to your hardware? Follow these steps:
a. 
Go to the Device Manager, locate your display adapter, right-click, and select Properties.
b. 
Locate your driver information.
c. 
Can you identify the version number(s) of your video drivers? Write them down.
 
___________________________________________________________________________
d. 
Go online and ﬁnd the manufacturer’s Web site.
e. 
Check to see if newer drivers are available. If so, download and install them. (Do this on a test 
machine ﬁrst. Get comfortable with the whole process before you do this on your personal 
computer.)
How did this affect your machine?
_______________________________________________________________________________
✔ Hint
New drivers will sometimes fail to work properly, thereby crippling your PC. Windows XP and 
higher have the driver rollback feature that enables you to go back to a driver that worked 
correctly in case this should happen. Refer to Chapter 17 for a refresher on how to do this.
Step 5 One more place to look for video settings is the Power Management Control Panel applet. Take 
a look at any power management settings you may have.
Go to the Control Panel and double-click the Power Management or Power Options applet, if you 
have one. Read through the list of available power management schemes.
Which one do you have running? _____________________________________________________
How long is the period of inactivity before your monitor shuts off? __________________________
Close the applet and the Control Panel.

Lab Exercise 19.02: Conﬁguring Multiple Displays
Your consulting ﬁrm has just been awarded a contract to perform complete upgrades on the 12 digital 
audio workstations at a local recording studio. Among the various considerations for this type of 
application—large data storage, backups, fast processors, and loads of memory—the application also 
requires high-performance display adapters with multiple monitors for each station. It is not unusual 
for a recording engineer to have three or four critical windows open simultaneously during a session, 
so the studio design has included three widescreen monitors for each station.
You jump on the project and immediately stage one of the systems in the shop to run it through 
its paces. You decide to use one of the new ASUS motherboards with three PCIe slots and three high-
performance NVIDIA display adapters. You ﬁnish the video conﬁguration and attach three 30-inch 
widescreen monitors—this system looks impressive!
✔ Cross-Reference
For additional information on conﬁguring your multiple displays, refer to the “Installing 
and Conﬁguring Video” section in Chapter 19 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and 
Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Install an additional video display adapter card
• 
Conﬁgure a system to use multiple displays
• 
Expand the desktop across two or more displays
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC with Windows installed
• 
At least one additional display adapter or a display adapter that supports multiple monitors
• 
At least one additional working monitor (CRT or LCD)

Chapter 19: Video
392
✔ Hint
This lab exercise does not require any of the high-end equipment discussed in the scenario. You 
should be able to complete the steps to conﬁgure multiple monitors using a few video cards and 
the monitors in your classroom lab. You can even use the integrated display adapter on many 
motherboards and install one additional video card to complete the lab steps. If time permits, 
hop on a system with Internet access and explore some of the components discussed in the 
scenario. Manufacturers such as ASUS, NVIDIA, and NEC are always adding new technology to 
their product lines.
Getting Down to Business
To explore the system conﬁguration presented in the opening scenario, you will install at least one 
additional display adapter and monitor on a working system. You will then use the Display applet in 
Windows to conﬁgure the multiple monitors for use as an expanded desktop.
Step 1 Shut down your system properly and unplug the power cable from the system unit and the 
wall. Remove the cover from the PC to expose the expansion bus slots.
a. 
Verify the type (PCI, AGP, or PCIe) and location of the current video display adapter. Using 
proper ESD avoidance procedures and one of the available expansion slots (depending on the 
additional video card available to you), install a second video display adapter in your system. 
Remember that AGP and PCIe cards can be a little ﬁnicky during installation, so make sure 
they are in securely.
✔ Hint
If you happen to have an AGP adapter installed, your second adapter will need to be PCI, as 
that’s the only type of slot you’re likely to have that can handle a video adapter. If you’re in a 
classroom environment, your instructor should be able to provide you with an additional video 
card and monitor to facilitate this lab. In some cases you can use an integrated display adapter 
as your primary display, installing the new display as the secondary. Follow your instructor’s 
directions in addition to the directions included in this exercise.
Also, you may have a display adapter that already supports multiple monitors and has two 
display ports on a single card. If this is the case, you don’t need to add a second adapter to set 
up multiple monitors, but it’s good to practice, either way.

Lab Exercise 19.02: Conﬁ guring Multiple Displays
393
b. 
Attach the second monitor cable to the new display adapter, and test your system with the case 
still open to see if it works.
 
To verify that the second display adapter and monitor have been installed correctly, are 
recognized by the system, and have drivers available, open the Device Manager and expand the 
display adapter’s icon. View the properties of the newly installed card and select the Drivers 
tab. Does everything appear to be in order?
c. 
If the new display adapter is not working properly, you may need to install speciﬁc drivers or 
updated drivers. Access the Internet to download and install the appropriate drivers for your 
display adapter.
Step 2 Now that the hardware is set up and functioning properly, you will conﬁgure Windows to 
expand your desktop across two or more displays. To do this, you will again open the Display applet.
In Windows 2000/XP, navigate to the Display Properties dialog box’s Settings tab. In Windows Vista, 
go to Control Panel | Personalization | Display Settings. This shows the monitor settings and should now 
display two monitor icons, as shown in Figure 19-6.

Figure 19-7 Extending the Windows desktop
Now complete the following steps to expand your desktop across the displays you have installed.
a. 
Click the drop-down arrow next to the Display ﬁeld. Are both of your display adapters  
available? _______
b. 
Click the second monitor icon, check the Extend my Windows desktop onto this monitor box, and click 
the Apply button. Your monitor icons should now look something like Figure 19-7, and the display 
on your monitors should change accordingly.
c. 
Click and drag the Display Properties dialog box from one monitor to the other. Notice that 
the standard setup has the second display as the display to the right, so the expansion should 
allow you to use the second monitor as the rightmost portion of the desktop. Open a few 
windows and place them in different locations on the two monitors (see Figure 19-8).
d. 
Experiment with the “virtual” placement of the monitors by clicking one of the numbered 
monitors and dragging it around the other monitor(s). Also click and highlight one of the 
numbered monitors and select it as the primary display.
 
Can you place the monitors on top of each other (see Figure 19-9)? ______
 
Can you set the second display as the primary monitor? ______
 
Right-click one of the displays in the Display Properties window and select Identify. What are 
the results? _________________________________________________________________

Lab Exercise 19.03: Troubleshooting Video
Video troubleshooting really boils down to two distinct questions. First, are the physical video 
components installed and conﬁgured properly, as discussed in Lab Exercise 19.01? Second, do the current 
video display adapter and CPU support the software technologies you’re trying to use? (Or have you 
loaded that killer game and completely overwhelmed your video subsystem?) In this lab exercise, 
you’ll create connectivity problems to simulate real-world installation problems, and use the DirectX 
Diagnostic Tool to analyze your system.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Recognize and ﬁx typical video installation and connectivity problems
• 
Use the Microsoft DirectX Diagnostic Tool to analyze and test the graphic display attributes of 
a PC system
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working PC with Windows installed
• 
Any version of the Microsoft DirectX Diagnostic Tool installed
Getting Down to Business
If you went through Lab Exercise 19.01 and had typical results—video card not seated properly, 
forgetting to plug things in all the way, and so on—you can probably skip Steps 1 and 2 of this lab. If 
you had a perfect reinstall, on the other hand, then deﬁnitely do all of the steps!
Step 1 Loosen the screws that hold the monitor data cable securely to the video card. With the 
system fully powered up and in Windows—and being gentle with your hardware—partially disconnect 
the monitor cable.
What happened to the screen? _______________________________________________________
With many monitors, a loose cable results in a seriously degraded display. Colors fade out or a 
single color disappears, or the display may appear grainy or snowy, for example. If you run into these 
symptoms in the ﬁeld, check your connectivity!
Connect the monitor cable and tighten the restraining screws to resume normal operation.

Lab Exercise 19.03: Troubleshooting Video

Figure 19-10 Using the DirectX Diagnostic Tool
Step 2 With the power off and disconnected from the PC, open the case and remove the screw that 
secures the video card to the case frame. Pull the video card up slightly on one end. Reapply electricity 
and power up the PC.
What happened? __________________________________________________________________
You might have to run through this a couple of times to get the desired effect, which is a seemingly 
dead PC and some beeping from the system speaker. That long-short-short beep code is pretty universally 
recognizable as the PC’s cry for help: “Hey! My video card isn’t seated properly!”
With the power off and disconnected, reseat your video card, reinstall the restraining screw, and 
power up your PC to resume normal operation.
Step 3 Access the Microsoft DirectX Diagnostic Tool. In Windows 2000/XP, select Start | All Programs | 
Accessories | System Tools | System Information. Select Tools | DirectX Diagnostic Tool (see Figure 19-10). 
In Windows Vista, type dxdiag into the Start Search box and press ENTER.
✔ Hint
There is a faster way to get to the DirectX Diagnostic Tool in Windows 2000/XP too! Just go to 
Start | Run, type dxdiag, and click OK.

Step 4 Select the Display tab (see Figure 19-11).
What is the name of your display adapter? _______________________________
How much total memory is on the adapter? _______________________________
What is the current display mode? ______________________________________
What is the driver name and version? ___________________________________
Does it display a driver version date? ____________________________________
Should you look for a more current driver? _______________________________
Step 5 Check out the Notes box at the bottom of the Display tab, and read the information provided. 
This is where you can ﬁnd out about any conﬂicts or problem areas.
Do you show any conﬂicting information? If so, what’s the problem? 
_______________________________________________________________________________
Step 6 Select and test the DirectDraw feature (Windows 2000/XP only, since the version of DirectX 
that Vista and 7 use, DirectX 10, got rid of these features), and follow the instructions.

Step 7 Select and test the Direct3D feature (again, Windows 2000/XP only), and follow the instructions.
Did the test complete correctly? _______
Step 8 Some programs run very slowly or not at all unless Microsoft DirectDraw or Direct3D 
hardware acceleration is available. On the Display tab, look in the DirectX Features section to see 
whether DirectDraw, Direct3D, or AGP texture acceleration is set to Not Available.
You may need to enable these items or adjust your graphics acceleration, as described in the 
following steps. You might also consider upgrading your hardware if necessary to improve performance.
In Windows 2000/XP only, go to the Control Panel, open Display, and select the Settings tab. Click 
Advanced, and select the Troubleshoot tab. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider to Full.
✔ Hint
If you’re looking at a Windows 2000 system, the tab under the Advanced options for hardware 
acceleration is called Performance or Troubleshooting.

You have been hired as an entry-level tech for a public school district. 
Your ﬁrst day on the job, the technology manager asks how familiar you 
are with the recording, storing, and playback of audio ﬁles on computer 
systems. It turns out that the history department wants the students 
to be able to record audio documentaries on historical events, store 
the ﬁles on the network, and produce podcasts of the documentaries. 
Demonstrating your enthusiasm, you respond that you are somewhat 
familiar with sound and will tackle the project. You are tasked with 
researching the sound card, building the prototype system, and 
providing some basic audio recording and storage training to the history 
instructors.
As a competent PC tech, you need to understand not just the tasks of 
installing the physical sound card and associated drivers, but also the 
applications that take advantage of the PC’s sound capabilities. As such, 
the CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation exams expect you to know about sound 
cards and their workings. The following lab exercises introduce you to 
sound card hardware and drivers, as well as the basic use of some of the 
popular Windows audio applications.
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 20.01: Installing Sound
The ﬁrst task on the agenda is to do a little research on sound cards and choose a few that meet the 
needs of this project. There are a number of different sound chips, and the “card” can be anything 
from the onboard sound capability of a mid-priced system to professional multichannel (input/output) 
devices used in recording studios. After you assemble a few candidates, you will select a sound card 
and then install, conﬁgure, and test that card. For the purpose of completing this lab, it is perfectly 
acceptable to use any working card, or an onboard sound device if that’s what you have available.

Lab Exercise 20.01: Installing Sound
403
Learning Objectives
This lab teaches you the basics of installing and conﬁguring a sound card.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Identify features of sound cards
• 
Remove and install a sound card and associated devices (speakers and microphone)
• 
Conﬁgure a sound card
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer system running Windows
• 
A removable sound card, microphone, and speakers properly installed and functioning (the sound 
drivers must either be part of the operating system in use or be available on disc or online)
✖ Warning
Different versions of Windows handle drivers differently, to say the least. You should have a 
current driver for your sound card handy, just in case Windows decides it cannot remember 
your sound card when you go to reinstall!
Getting Down to Business
This lab will step you through removing, researching speciﬁcations for, installing, and conﬁguring a 
sound card.
✔ Cross-Reference
For more information on sound cards, review the “Getting the Right Sound Hardware” section 
in Chapter 20 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Step 1 Begin by examining the conﬁguration and resources currently being used by the sound card. 
Turn on your machine and boot to Windows, and then open the Device Manager (see Figure 20-1).
✔ Hint
There are several ways to access the Device Manager. If you need a memory jog, review the 
discussion of paths in Chapter 4.

Chapter 20: Multimedia

Now follow these steps:
a. 
Click the plus sign (+) next to Sound, video and game controllers.
b. 
Highlight the sound card icon.
✔ Hint
The name of the sound card icon differs according to the type of sound card you have installed. 
A Creative Labs SoundBlaster Live! card, for example, has the entry listed as “Creative SB Live! 
Series (WDM).” Try them all if it’s not obvious at ﬁrst glance which is the appropriate icon.
c. 
Right-click and select Properties.
Figure 20-1 The Device Manager in Windows XP

Lab Exercise 20.01: Installing Sound
405
d. 
Click the Resources tab.
 
Verify which resources the sound device is using, and conﬁrm that there are no conﬂicts.
 
Which interrupt request (IRQ) is listed? ___________________________________________
 
What direct memory access (DMA) channels are listed, if any? __________________________
 
What input/output (I/O) addresses are listed? _______________________________________
e. 
Click the Driver tab, and record all the available information about the driver that is currently 
installed.
 
____________________________________________________________________________
Step 2 Take a moment and look up the speciﬁcations of your current sound card online. Identify the 
following:
Resolution _______________________________________________________________________
Sampling rate ____________________________________________________________________
Dynamic range ___________________________________________________________________
Signal-to-noise ratio _______________________________________________________________
Now see if you can ﬁnd this information online for some other cards—try M-AUDIO Revolution 5.1, 
Creative SoundBlaster X-Fi, SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio, and Turtle Beach Montego DDL.
Step 3 Now that you’ve seen what resources are currently being used, and some of the relevant 
speciﬁcations, the next step is to practice removing and reinstalling the sound card.
✔ Hint
This lab assumes that you have a removable sound card, not onboard sound. If all you have to 
work with is a system with onboard sound, go into the CMOS setup utility and turn off the 
onboard sound. Make what observations you can and resume the exercise with Step 4. When the 
time comes in the second half of Step 4 to reinstall the sound card, just go back into CMOS and 
enable the onboard sound again.
a. 
Close the Device Manager and shut down your system properly. Unplug the power cord.
b. 
Remove the case cover from your system and locate the sound card (see Figure 20-2).
 
What type of slot does the card use? ______________________________________________
c. 
Disconnect any cables that are attached to the sound card (both internal and external), take 
out the screw that secures the sound card to the case, and then carefully remove the card. 
Make sure you’re properly grounded before you touch the card!

What sort of internal connectors does the card have? _________________________________
 
What sort of external connectors does it have? ______________________________________
 
Does the card have jumpers? What are they used for? Again, look on the Internet for the 
answers. Find the name of the card manufacturer and search that company’s Web site for 
information on your speciﬁc model. This information is also available in the documentation 
for the card, if you still have it around.

What is the brand name of the sound-processing chip?  
___________________________________________________________________________
 
Is the name on the chip different from the name of the manufacturer of the card? (For 
example, the chip might have ESS printed on it, while the board is marked Creative Labs.) 
 
___________________________________________________________________________
 
Describe the cables you disconnected when you removed the sound card.
 
___________________________________________________________________________
 
Does the card have an IDE interface? If so, you have a really old card. How would the IDE 
interface be used? _____________________________________________________________
Figure 20-2 A typical sound card

Lab Exercise 20.01: Installing Sound
407
✔ Hint
In old systems that had only one IDE controller on the motherboard, how were CD-ROM drives 
connected when you had two hard drives in the system?
Step 4 With the card out of your system, turn on the machine and let it boot to the Windows 
desktop. Then go to the Device Manager and see if your sound card is still listed.
Did Windows automatically remove the device when the card was removed? ________
 If the sound card is still listed, highlight its icon, right-click, and select Uninstall. (Am I sure? Yes, 
I’m sure!)
Save your changes and shut your system off properly.
The next steps will conﬁrm that the device has been removed:
a. 
Reboot your system, go to the Device Manager, and conﬁrm that the sound device is no longer 
listed.
b. 
Shut down your system and disconnect the power cord. Insert the sound card in the slot 
where you originally found it, secure the card to the case using the screw you removed, and 
reconnect all the cables.
c. 
Reboot the system. When plug and play (PnP) kicks in, your system should recognize that you 
have added a card.
Windows will now locate the software drivers for the new hardware you installed. In fact, unless 
you uninstalled them, the drivers should still be on your system.
Step 5 Return to the Device Manager and repeat Step 1 to verify what resources the sound card is 
now using and conﬁrm that there are no conﬂicts.
What IRQ is listed now? __________________________________________________
What DMA channels are listed, if any? ______________________________________
What I/O addresses are listed? _____________________________________________
Are the settings the same as in Step 1 before you removed the card? ________________
Go to the Drivers tab and conﬁrm that Windows installed the same drivers in the system. If necessary, 
use the driver disc to reinstall the correct drivers.
Step 6 To conﬁrm that sound is working properly, start by ensuring that the speakers are powered 
and connected, and that the volume is set at a comfortable level.

Chapter 20: Multimedia
408
Make sure your speakers are plugged into the proper jack on the sound card.
Is the speaker pair plugged into a working AC outlet, or does it have good batteries? 
________________________________________________________________________________
Is there a volume adjustment knob on your speakers? _____________________________________
If you have a volume knob, adjust it to the middle position, and then access the Control Panel.
Now place a Volume icon in the taskbar’s system tray/notiﬁcation area so that volume adjustments 
will be more convenient. Follow the procedure that matches your operating system.
• 
In Windows 2000, open the Sounds and Multimedia Control Panel applet, and check the Show 
volume control on the taskbar box.
• 
In Windows XP, open the Sounds and Audio Devices Control Panel applet, and check the Place 
volume icon in the taskbar box.
• 
In Windows Vista, right-click the taskbar and select Properties. Then, click the Notiﬁcation 
Area tab and make sure Volume is checked under Select which system icons to always show.
Once you have the Volume icon in the taskbar, double-click it to open the volume controls and then 
follow these steps:
a. 
Check to be sure that the Mute all option is not selected (see Figure 20-3).
b. 
Select Options | Properties.
c. 
Select the volume controls that you want to control.
d. 
Click OK to close the Properties window.
e. 
Now adjust all the sliders to the center position.
You now have a good starting point to play sounds. Once you have ensured that the speakers are 
successfully putting out sound, you can go back and customize the levels to your liking.
Figure 20-3 Setting the volume controls in Windows XP

Lab Exercise 20.01: Installing Sound
409
Step 7 Test the speakers, and adjust the sound volume to a comfortable level. A good tool to use to test 
your sound card is the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. This is the same tool you used in Chapter 19 to test video 
performance. In Windows 2000/XP, click Start | Run and type dxdiag to launch the DirectX Diagnostic 
Tool (see Figure 20-4). In Windows Vista, go to the Start Search box and type dxdiag. Press ENTER.
a. 
Click the Sound tab, and examine the information displayed about your sound card and drivers.
b. 
Click the Test DirectSound button (Windows 2000/XP only). This steps you through a series of 
tests to conﬁrm the operation of your sound system.
c. 
Switch to the Music tab and click the Test DirectMusic button (Windows 2000/XP only). This 
tests whether your system supports the DirectMusic component of DirectX.
Step 8 You’ve learned to remove, install, and conﬁgure a sound card. You’ve also learned how to test 
the various parts of the sound system. Now it’s time to talk about troubleshooting.
Your sound system is working, but your speakers sound a little rough. Are they “blown” out because 
they were overdriven with poor adjustments? You can go to Eminent Technology’s Multimedia Speaker 
Test Web site and test the response of your speakers at different frequencies:
www.eminent-tech.com/music/multimediatest.html
These tests will help you conﬁrm whether your speakers can still handle all the frequencies they are 
designed to handle.

Lab Exercise 20.02: Recording Sound
With the sound card installed, conﬁgured, and tested, it’s time to get the project really rolling with 
recorded sound. It is expected that each student’s documentary will last from eight to ten minutes and 
will encompass typical current events. Each student has a microphone, sound card, and speakers. What 
you want to do is get the speech recorded digitally, maybe add some music, and choose the audio quality 
based on the expected delivery method.
Learning Objectives
The purpose of this lab exercise is to guide you in the recording of sound.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use the microphone to record a WAV ﬁle
• 
Fine-tune the quality of the recording
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer system running Windows
• 
A sound card, speakers, and a microphone properly installed
Getting Down to Business
Once you have installed, conﬁgured, and tested a sound card, you need to run some applications to see 
if this is going to work. This lab steps you through recording sound into the computer and saving the 
recording as a WAV or MP3 sound ﬁle.
Step 1 To check your system’s ability to capture audio so that you can record the documentaries, you 
will use Windows Sound Recorder. Make sure your microphone is plugged into the proper connector 
before you proceed.
Access Sound Recorder in Windows 2000/XP by selecting Start | All Programs | Accessories | 
Entertainment | Sound Recorder. In Windows Vista, select Start | Accessories | Sound Recorder. What you 
have now is similar to an audio cassette player. The buttons are the same—Record, Play, Fast Forward, 
Rewind, and Stop—but they’re labeled with icons instead of words (see Figure 20-5).
Figure 20-5 Using Windows Sound Recorder

Lab Exercise 20.02: Recording Sound
411
Step 2 You will now explore three different levels of recording. When working with digital audio 
ﬁles, the balance between sound quality and sound ﬁle size is driven by the project. If you were 
recording a project for CD, you would want the highest quality. For streaming audio and podcast audio, 
the MP3 ﬁle format is probably acceptable. Telephone quality, while achieving small ﬁle size, is not 
considered production quality.
a. 
To set the recording quality, select File | Properties and then click the Convert Now button. In 
the Sound Selection dialog box, click the Name drop-down menu and select CD Quality. Click 
OK and then OK again to return to the Sound Recorder window.
b. 
Click the red Record button and start talking into the microphone. Watch the graph to see 
that your voice is being recorded. If nothing seems to be happening, check your microphone 
connections.
c. 
Record a full 60 seconds of CD-quality audio, and then click Stop (the button with a square 
icon, next to Record). To hear your recording, click Play (the single right arrow).
d. 
To discover how much space this sound ﬁle uses, select File | Properties and observe the ﬁle’s 
data size. Record the ﬁle size here: _______________________________________________
e. 
Create a subfolder named podcast in your My Music folder (under My Documents) and save 
the sound ﬁle as CDQUALITY.WAV in the podcast folder.
✔ Hint
As you’ve probably ﬁgured out, our scenario for the history department would require a more 
sophisticated digital audio recording application. One minute is not going to be a very lengthy 
documentary! Sound Recorder is a good application to demonstrate the steps required to record 
audio, and you could use it to set up custom sound ﬁles to play during events. An example 
would be the infamous sound ﬁle that announces “You’ve got mail.” If you would like to explore 
digital audio recording and playback further, you can ﬁnd and download the open source program 
called Audacity at http://audacity.sourceforge.net.
Step 3 Telephone quality is very low resolution and frequency response, meaning that it will 
probably sound mufﬂed and dull. Follow these steps to convert the CD-quality sound ﬁle to a telephone-
quality sound ﬁle:
a. 
Select File | Properties, click Convert Now, and change the Name setting to Telephone Quality. 
Click OK and then OK again to return to the Sound Recorder window.
b. 
Now check out the data size of the ﬁle and record it here: ______________. Has the size of 
the sound ﬁle changed? How does it sound? ________________________________________
c. 
Save the sound ﬁle in the podcast folder as TELEPHONEQUALITY.WAV.

Chapter 20: Multimedia
412
Step 4 Finally, you will explore saving a recording as an MPEG Layer-3 (MP3) sound ﬁle. This is 
probably the best balance between audio quality and ﬁle size.
a. 
Launch Sound Recorder and open the CDQUALITY.WAV ﬁle.
b. 
To set the recording quality to the MP3 format, select File | Properties and then click Convert 
Now. In the Sound Selection dialog box, click the Format drop-down list and select MPEG 
Layer-3, then click OK.
c. 
Note the ﬁle’s data size and record it here: ______________. Has the size of the sound ﬁle 
changed? How does it sound? ___________________________________________________
d. 
Open the podcast folder and save the sound ﬁle as MP3QUALITY.MP3.
✔ Hint
In the Sound Selection dialog box, you can also set more speciﬁc attributes for an MP3 ﬁle; just 
click the Attributes drop-down list after selecting MPEG Layer-3 and you’ll see a number of 
options to ﬁne-tune the quality of your recording.
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 20.03: Exploring Windows Media Player
Now that you have successfully recorded the project, you will have to look at some of the methods used 
to play the ﬁles and create an archive of the documentary on CD. The Windows environment has used 
Windows Media Player since the introduction of version 6.1 in 1998. You can always download the latest 
version of Windows Media Player from Microsoft’s Web site. In this exercise you will learn some of the 
basic navigation steps for using Windows Media Player, and burn your recordings to an audio CD.
➜ Note
The audio standard for the Apple Macintosh environment is QuickTime.
Learning Objectives
In this lab exercise, you’ll learn how to navigate and play audio ﬁles, and then you’ll learn how to burn 
an audio CD using Windows Media Player.

Lab Exercise 20.03: Exploring Windows Media Player
413
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Open and play sound ﬁles of various formats
• 
Navigate Windows Media Player
• 
Burn a CD of your recording
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer system running Windows
• 
A sound card, speakers, and a microphone properly installed
• 
Windows Media Player 9 or newer (WMP11 is used in the lab exercise)
• 
A commercially produced music CD of your choice
• 
A blank CD-R or CD-RW
Getting Down to Business
Once you’ve recorded the sound and saved it as a WAV or MP3 sound ﬁle, you need a method to audition 
the ﬁnished product and package the sound ﬁle for distribution. You may want to make an MP3 ﬁle for 
portable players or streaming audio over the Internet, or you may want to distribute high-quality audio CDs.
✔ Hint
There are a number of paths you could take to accomplish the playback of your recordings and 
archive them to a CD. This lab exercise steps you through one method that explores some of the 
features of Windows Media Player 11. Some of the steps, windows, and icons may look different 
depending on the version of Windows Media Player you use. You can download Windows Media 
Player 11 from Microsoft to follow along exactly with the steps in the lab.
Step 1 Launch Windows Media Player and then follow these steps:
a. 
If you have installed Windows Media Player 11, right-click the main menu and select Show 
Classic Menus. This displays the traditional menu bar with File, View, Play, Tools, and Help 
(see Figure 20-6).
b. 
Click the Now Playing tab. To open the three ﬁles you created in the previous lab 
(TELEPHONEQUALITY.WAV, MP3QUALITY.MP3, and CDQUALITY.WAV), select File | Open and 
then click Look in. Use the drop-down menu to locate the podcast folder and ﬁles. Click the 
ﬁrst ﬁle, and then hold the CTRL key down while you click each of the two remaining two ﬁles. 

Chapter 20: Multimedia
414
Drag the three selected ﬁles to the Now Playing playlist. The ﬁrst sound ﬁle should start to 
play automatically and display the ﬁlename in the right pane.
c. 
While listening to the podcast, click File | Save Now Playing List As and save the list as 
PODCAST.WPL. This organizes your ﬁles into a named list for ease of use.
d. 
Click the Burn tab, and then click Burn ‘podcast’ in the Burn List pane on the right side of the 
Windows Media Player window.
e. 
Insert a blank optical disc into an optical drive on your system with recording capabilities, 
and then click the Start Burn button.
f. 
Wait while the podcast audio ﬁle is burned to the optical disc, completing the task of archiving 
your recordings.
Step 2 While you have Windows Media Player open, explore the other options available to you as you 
work with sound ﬁles. One of the most popular uses of the computer when it comes to working with 
audio is to convert your CDs to MP3 sound ﬁles for use on portable MP3 players. Complete the following 
steps to calculate how many CDs you could ﬁt onto a 2-GB MP3 player:
a. 
Insert a music CD into the optical media drive.
b. 
Right-click Rip and select More Options. This opens the Options dialog box for Windows Media 
Player, with the Rip Music tab selected.

The world has gone mobile, and accomplished technicians travel right 
along with it. General technicians have always worked on the software 
side of portables, tweaking power management options to optimize 
battery life for the users. Working on the hardware side of portable 
computing devices of all stripes, however, used to be the realm of only 
highly specialized technicians. As portable computing devices become 
increasingly common and the technology inside becomes more modular, 
frontline general technicians (think CompTIA A+ certiﬁed technicians 
here) increasingly get the call to upgrade and repair these devices.
Most laptops and netbooks have parts that a user can easily replace. 
You can swap out a fading battery for a newer one, for example, or add a 
second battery in place of an optical drive for long airplane trips. Lurking 
beneath access panels on the underside or below the keyboard on some 
models are hardware components such as RAM, a hard drive, a network 
card, and a modem—just like laptop batteries, these parts can be easily 
accessed and replaced by a technician. Some laptops even have panels for 
replacing the video card and CPU.
In this series of labs, you’ll do four things. First, you’ll use the 
Internet to research the upgrades available for portable computing devices 
so you can provide proper recommendations to employers and clients. 
Second, you’ll open a laptop and gut it like a rainbow trout—removing 
and replacing RAM, the most common of all hardware upgrades. Third, 
you’ll perform the traditional task of a portable PC technician, tweaking 
the power management options to optimize battery life on particular 
models. Finally, you’ll tour a computer store to familiarize yourself with 
the latest and greatest portable offerings.

✖ Warning
I want to caution you that completely disassembling a laptop can be like trying to wrestle 
a bear. Even seasoned technicians pause before removing the dozens of screws involved in 
replacing broken screens or damaged system boards. These types of repairs require patience 
and ﬁnesse as you disassemble and reassemble delicate plastic coverings and connect and 
disconnect fragile wiring harnesses. Troubleshooting damaged laptops is beyond the scope of 
this lab manual. The lab exercises here focus on the more accessible upgrades, as outlined in the 
CompTIA A+ domain objectives.

Lab Exercise 21.01: Researching Laptop Upgrade Paths
Your boss just sent word that one of your most important clients wants to extend the life of their sales 
force’s laptop computers by upgrading rather than replacing. You’ve been asked to provide an upgrade 
track for your client. This requires you to research the laptops used by the company to determine which 
upgrades you can make, and to verify that the laptops themselves are not so old that the cost to upgrade 
them outweighs the cost of new laptops with new technology. You have to determine whether you can 
add RAM, replace the hard drives, replace the aging batteries, or add docking stations to provide extra 
functions when the salespeople are at the home ofﬁce. Get to work!
Learning Objectives
Given the manufacturer and model number of a notebook computer, you’ll ﬁgure out how to upgrade 
your client’s computers.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Determine the replacement price of a battery
•

Getting Down to Business
Limber up your surﬁng ﬁngers because you’re about to spend some time on the Web. Researching 
information about hardware and software is something technicians do all the time. The better you are 
at it, the better you are at your job!
When you’re searching for replacement and upgrade parts and information, always take a look 
at the device manufacturer’s Web site. Most major PC manufacturers, such as Dell and IBM (Lenovo 
has purchased IBM’s personal computer line, so IBM laptops are now supported by Lenovo), have 
comprehensive product speciﬁcation sheets available to the public on their sites. You can even order 
replacement parts directly from them! A popular tactic for researching upgrades is to grab the upgrade 
specs from the manufacturer’s site and then search the Internet for the best prices. Not only are you 
doing your job well, but you’ll be saving your company money too!
In the following steps, you’ll navigate the tumultuous seas of the Internet in a quest to ﬁnd the 
Golden Fleece of laptop battery, memory, and hard drive upgrades.
Step 1 Fire up your Web browser, and surf over to the device manufacturer’s Web site. Try www.
dell.com, or do a Google search for laptop battery. Many sites sell every laptop battery imaginable. 
The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with using the Internet to identify parts, conﬁrm the 
speciﬁcations, and purchase replacement batteries. Once you reach a suitable Web site, answer the 
following questions:
 You need replacement batteries for several Dell Precision M4400 laptops. What’s the vendor’s part 
number and price for this battery? 
What’s the voltage and power capacity of the battery? 
✔ Hint
Just like any other electrical power source, batteries are rated according to voltage (9.6 V, for 
instance), current capacity (2600 milliamps per hour, or mAh), and sometimes power capacity 
(72 watts per hour, or WHr). When purchasing laptop batteries from third-party vendors (that 
is, vendors other than the laptop manufacturer), make sure to buy a battery that matches the 
voltage recommended by the manufacturer. Depending on the type of battery (Ni-Cd, NiMH, or 
Li-Ion), the current or power capacity of replacement batteries may be greater than the original 
battery. This is not a problem—increased current/power capacity means longer run times for 
your portable PC.

Step 2 Search the manufacturer’s Web site for information on memory. If that isn’t available, ﬂip 
your browser over to www.kahlon.com to check RAM prices and availability. If the site isn’t available, 
perform a Google search to ﬁnd other Web sites that sell laptop memory. Then answer the following 
questions.
 Your client has a Dell Precision M4400 with 1 GB of RAM. How much RAM can you install? How 
many sticks of RAM will it take to upgrade this machine to a respectable 4 GB of memory, and how 
much will it cost? 
Step 3 Stay where you landed in your search for memory upgrades. Does the vendor have 
replacement or additional hard drives available as well? If not, try www.kahlon.com, but now research 
possible hard drive upgrades for the Dell Precision M4400 the client owns. Answer this question:
 The client’s Dell Precision M4400 laptops have 80-GB hard drives plus a currently unused modular 
media bay that could be housing a second hard drive. How much would it cost to add a second  
160-GB hard drive to the Dell?

The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working portable computer (one with modern SO-DIMM or DDR SO-DIMM modules is preferable)
• 
A very tiny Phillips-head screwdriver
• 
An anti-static mat
✖ Warning
Opening a portable computer can result in a nonfunctional portable computer. Don’t use the 
instructor’s primary work laptop for this exercise!
Getting Down to Business
You’re about to open the sensitive inner portions of a portable computer, but before you do, it’s a great 
idea to refresh your memory about avoiding electrostatic discharge (ESD). The inside of a laptop looks 
different from the inside of a desktop or tower case, but the contents are just as sensitive to static 
electricity. Watch out!
Step 1 Using your handy screwdriver or other handy tool, open the access panel for the RAM. Every 
portable PC offers a different way to access the RAM, so I can’t give you explicit directions here. Most 
often, you’ll ﬁnd a removable plate on the bottom of the laptop secured with a tiny Phillips-head screw. 
Some laptops require you to remove the keyboard, unscrew a heat spreader, and then access the RAM. 
Figure 21-1 shows a typical panel, accessible from the underside of the laptop.

Refer to the “Power Management” section in Chapter 21 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to 
Managing and Troubleshooting PCs for more information on power management on portable PCs.
Now follow these steps:
a. 
Go to the Power Management Setup screen.
b. 
Enable power management if it’s currently disabled.
c. 
Look at each option for common-sense settings. For example, when operating on battery power, 
the portable should be conﬁgured for maximum energy efﬁciency, thus increasing run time.
d. 
Make sure the ACPI setting is enabled if the BIOS supports it.
e. 
Save your settings, and boot the system to the Windows desktop.
✔ Hint
ACPI is short for Advanced Conﬁguration and Power Interface, a power management 
speciﬁcation developed by Intel, Microsoft, and Toshiba. ACPI enables the operating system to 
control the amount of power given to each device attached to the computer. With ACPI, the 
operating system can turn off peripheral devices, such as optical drives, when they’re not in use.
Step 2 Access the Power Options applet in the Control Panel, and make a note of your current power 
management settings.
Check out the different power schemes available (this will depend on your speciﬁc system) and 
experiment with changing the settings to see how this affects when the monitor and hard drives turn 
off. Each of these schemes has adjustable times. The tabs and settings will differ depending on which 
version of Windows you’re running. Be sure to look at them all. To see more detailed power scheme 
settings in Windows Vista, be sure to click Change power settings and then Change advanced power settings.
✔ Hint
The Windows XP Power Options Properties dialog box (on a notebook) has ﬁve tabs: Power 
Schemes, Alarms, Power Meter, Advanced, and Hibernate (see Figure 21-3). You can use the 
Alarms tab to set the time when the battery alarm is activated. The Power Meter tab shows the 
percent of charge remaining in the battery.

Portable PCs are manufactured by a wide variety of companies, and no two notebooks are created equal. 
Some notebooks feature a slim and lightweight proﬁle and are designed for the busy traveler; others 
feature a full complement of ports and rival desktop PCs in their power and features. Netbooks are 
smaller, compact versions of laptops that are ideal as long-term traveling companions. They can ﬁt in 
a purse or backpack and thus are handy for browsing or doing e-mail on the road. Tablet PCs have pen-
based interfaces that allow you to use them like a paper notepad. PDAs are great for portable address 
books and tasks lists that can be quickly synchronized with desktop programs through infrared or 
Bluetooth interfaces. Take a look at all the available models and compare their features.

Chapter 22: Printers
432
Printers continue to be a major part of the day-to-day working 
environment, both at home and in the ofﬁce, despite attempts to create a 
“paperless ofﬁce.” What this means is that the PC technician will have to 
understand the operation of several types of printers and be able to keep 
them in good working order. Many companies have service contracts for 
their more expensive printers (they’re usually leased property anyway!), 
but there will always be printers that need a good technician’s love 
and care.
This chapter’s lab exercises will take you through a scenario in which 
your boss walks into your ofﬁce and tells you ﬁve printers are being 
delivered to you—two impact printers using legacy parallel ports, two 
USB inkjet printers, and an HP LaserJet laser printer using a JetDirect 
network interface. You need to install them and make sure they work 
properly so that they’re accessible by anyone in the company who needs 
them. You’ll explore different port settings and how to alter them when 
you need to do so. You’ll then learn about some of the key differences 
between the two most popular types of printers (inkjet and laser printers), 
and you’ll load printer drivers. Finally, you’ll look at some of the 
maintenance issues that are required to keep the printers up and 
running and some of the techniques to use when they stop.

Lab Exercise 22.01: Exploring Conﬁguration Settings
Printers have used just about every interface available to the computer, from legacy RS-232C serial 
and IEEE 1284 parallel interfaces to the most recent USB, FireWire, Infrared, and Bluetooth wireless 
interfaces. The two most common ports used in connecting a printer locally to a PC are the universal 
serial bus (USB) and parallel ports. It just so happens that the printers you’ll be working with use 
parallel, USB, and network interfaces! In this lab, you’ll look at the parallel interface—the oldest of the 
three—and walk through the process of enabling and conﬁguring the parallel port in the BIOS.

Lab Exercise 22.01: Exploring Conﬁ guration Settings
433
✔ Cross-Reference
You have already explored the USB interface in Chapter 18 and will delve into the wonderful 
world of networking in Chapter 23. The parallel interface is aging, but there is still a large 
installed base of printers using this interface, and the CompTIA A+ exams expect you to know 
some of the details of the interface. Refer to the “Printer Connectivity” section in Chapter 22 of 
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs for help identifying parallel port 
modes and their differences and similarities.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll explore the different conﬁguration settings that are available for the parallel interface 
in your PC’s CMOS setup utility.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Enable and conﬁgure parallel ports in the BIOS
• 
Locate information about the parallel port in Device Manager
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer running Windows
✔ Hint
By now you should be quite familiar with the different paths used by various versions of 
Windows to get to the things you are looking for.
Getting Down to Business
First, take a look at the ports in your CMOS setup utility. The time is long since past that knowing how 
to change I/O and IRQ addresses has been useful, but it’s really helpful to know, and the CompTIA A+ 
exams expect you’ll be familiar with the information.
Step 1  Boot your PC, and go into the CMOS setup utility. Find the settings for your USB and parallel 
ports. They’ll most likely be under a heading such as Integrated Peripherals (see Figure 22-1).

Chapter 22: Printers
434
✖ Warning
When making changes to the system resources in both CMOS and Device Manager, be sure to 
ﬁrst write down the current settings. If your changes don’t work, you can always return them 
to the original settings that did work.
How many parallel ports do you have? ___________________________________________
What resources are the parallel port(s) using? _____________________________________
Step 2  Make the following changes in CMOS, and observe any effect on hardware installed on the 
parallel ports. Make sure you have drivers or parallel devices handy, because making changes at the 
CMOS level can make Windows unhappy! (You might need to reinstall drivers.)
• 
Parallel Port = I/O Address 378 and IRQ 7
• 
DMA = 3
Exit CMOS properly, saving your changes.
Step 3  Reboot your system to the Windows desktop, and access Device Manager in the Control Panel 
to verify that the resources are assigned.
Conﬁrm the resources allocated to the parallel port by following these steps:
a. 
Click the plus sign (+) next to Ports (COM & LPT).
b. 
Highlight the LPT port in the list, and open Properties.
c. 
Select the Resources tab.
Figure 22-1 The Integrated Peripherals CMOS screen

Lab Exercise 22.02: Examining Types of Printers
435
What are the I/O and IRQ settings for this port? ______________________________
d. 
Click OK to close the Properties dialog box.
Step 4  Verify the resources again by accessing the list of resources used in Device Manager:
a. 
From the Device Manager, select View | Resources by type.
b. 
Expand the groups as needed by clicking the plus sign (+) next to the desired resource.
✔ Hint
If there’s no IRQ listed, it may be by design. In Device Manager, expand the item called Ports 
(COM & LPT), and display the properties for ECP Printer Port (LPT1). Click the Settings tab—do 
you see the selection for never using an interrupt? Change the selection to Use any interrupt 
assigned to the port, and verify the resources again as outlined in Step 4.
Verify all of your settings and close the Device Manager, Control Panel, and My Computer to return 
to the desktop.

Lab Exercise 22.02: Examining Types of Printers
There’s an enormous amount of information on the Internet about printers. All of the top printer 
manufacturers—HP, Lexmark, Canon, and so forth—have Web sites that can provide insight about 
modern printers. As a PC technician, you’ll need to visit these sites for information about your new 
printers, and to download the most current drivers for those printers.
✖ Warning
You must have access to the Internet for this exercise. If there’s no access or the sites are down, 
refer to Chapter 22 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs for a review.

beneﬁcial for a general knowledge of printers.
Getting Down to Business
Fire up your favorite Web browser and head out on the old Information Superhighway. The Internet is 
just brimming with helpful information about printers.
✔ Hint
Web sites have the annoying tendency to either disappear or drop the information that was once 
relevant to a particular subject. If any of the links in this exercise are no longer active or don’t 
seem to contain the relevant information, you may need to do a little Web research of your own. 
As always, practice safe surﬁng! There are thousands of online forums available, and they can 
contain questionable hyperlinks, poor-quality information, and in some cases, outright wrong 
information. Try to stick with legitimate manufacturer and technical Web sites, examine where 
that hyperlink is going to reroute your computer, and visit multiple sites to verify information 
you discover in the forums. Consider it excellent practice for real-world tech work!
Step 1  To ﬁnd information about inkjet printers, access the following Web site to complete this step: 
http://computer.howstuffworks.com/inkjet-printer.htm/printable. If this link doesn’t work, you can 
also do a Google search and look for information about how printers work.
What’s the major difference between impact and non-impact printers? 
What part of an inkjet printer moves the print head back and forth across the page? 

Lab Exercise 22.02: Examining Types of Printers

Step 4  If you have access to a laser printer, open it and carefully examine the insides. Also read the 
printer manual for details on the speciﬁcations. Access the manufacturer’s Web site for additional 
information.
If you don’t have access to a laser printer, go to your local ofﬁce supply or computer store and ask 
a salesperson to show you the differences between various impact, inkjet (black and white as well as 
color), and laser printers.
Look inside your laser printer.
What parts are easily removable and replaceable? 
Practice removing and reinserting the toner (see Figure 22-2) and paper.
✖ Warning
Remember to turn the printer off before removing anything but the toner or paper. Also, be 
careful not to spill any toner inside the printer.
Look at the manual or the manufacturer’s Web site for these speciﬁcations. Answer all the following 
questions you can about your printer:
How much RAM can it hold? ____________________
How much effect does the amount of RAM have on the cost of a new printer? 
Are the drum and toner separate, or are they one replaceable part? 
What is the speed of the printer (pages per minute)? _____________________________
What is the quality of the output (resolution)? __________________________________
What are the number and types of ink cartridges? _______________________________
What is the price of a new printer? ___________________________________________
What is the cost per page? __________________________________________________

✔ Hint
Most inkjet (and even laser) printers are priced very low, so they’re affordable to buy initially. 
Using them is another question. Calculate the cost of the ink and how many pages it’ll print. 
This calculation will amaze you. They’re not so cheap after all.
 What can you conclude from your research about the true total cost of printing, including consumables?

Lab Exercise 22.03: Installing a Printer
The key to a successful printer installation is having the correct software drivers and understanding how 
the printer will interface with the computer. You’ll certainly need the drivers when you install those ﬁve 
printers, and you’ll also have to conﬁgure the printers you are installing to use parallel, USB, and network 
interfaces. A common practice in multiple-user environments—companies considered to be Small Ofﬁce/
Home Ofﬁce (SOHO)—is to use a printer with its own network interface card (NIC), so that computers 
from anywhere in the network can print directly to the printer through the network interface.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll install a printer, ﬁrst as a directly connected device, and then as a network device. 
You will then explore and change its settings.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Recognize the variations in key features of laser printers
• 
Install a laser printer in Windows
• 
Change laser printer settings in Windows
• 
Conﬁgure a TCP/IP port for a network printer
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
•

Getting Down to Business
These days, installing a printer is a fairly straightforward task. This is good news, because you’ll 
probably do your fair share of it as a computer technician.
Step 1  If you have an actual print device, start here. (If you don’t, skip to Step 2.)
Connect the printer to your system via a parallel or USB port, turn on the printer, and then turn on 
the PC. As the boot sequence progresses, the plug-and-play feature will locate the printer and install it 
for you. Follow the instructions on the screen.
✔ Hint
Here’s the twist. If your printer is older than your operating system, the OS should install the 
printer drivers with little interaction on your part. If the printer is newer than your OS, then 
you’ll need to have the driver disc handy because the system will stop and ask you for it. Some 
printer manufacturers actually require you to start their own printer installation programs even 
before connecting the printer to a system. As always, consult the manufacturer’s instructions ﬁrst.
Step 2  If you don’t have a print device, start here:
a. 
Access the Printer applet.
b. 
For Windows 2000, select Start | Settings | Printers. For Windows XP, select Start | Printers and 
Faxes. For Windows Vista, select Start | Control Panel | Printers.
c. 
Click the Add Printer icon. A wizard should pop up on the screen. Click Next to proceed.
d. 
You want to install a printer attached to your PC, so select the option for Local printer attached to 
this computer (see Figure 22-3). Click Next.
e. 
Follow the steps through the Printer Wizard by selecting LPT1 and then a printer from the list 
of printers or your driver disc.
✖ Warning
If you weren’t able to install an actual print device for this exercise, don’t print a test page. 
You’ll receive some interesting messages if you do.
Once you’ve installed the printer, open the Printers folder in the Control Panel, right-click the new 
printer’s icon, and select Properties.

Step 3  In the following steps, you will set up a TCP/IP printer interface port for a Hewlett-Packard 
LaserJet printer with a JetDirect NIC. If you have access to a printer with a network interface, or your 
classroom is equipped with one, use the IP address or printer name of the printer when conﬁguring the 
port. This will allow you to actually test the installation.
a. 
In Windows 2000/XP, open the Printer & Faxes folder by way of Start | Control Panel | Printers 
& Faxes and launch the Add Printer Wizard by clicking Add a printer under Printer Tasks. In 
Windows Vista, go to Start | Control Panel | Printers. Right-click in the window and select Add 
Printer. On the welcome screen, click Next.
b. 
Select Local printer attached to this computer in Windows 2000/XP (note the information balloon 
at the bottom of the dialog box, shown in Figure 22-3) or Add a local printer in Windows Vista. In 
Windows 2000/XP, clear the Automatically detect and install my Plug and Play printer box. Click Next.
c. 
Click the Create a new port radio button and select Standard TCP/IP Port from the drop-down menu.
d. 
This launches the Add Standard TCP/IP Printer Port Wizard (see Figure 22-4). Click Next.
e. 
In the Add Port dialog box, enter the IP address of the network printer. The Add Standard 
TCP/IP Printer Port Wizard automatically creates the port name (see Figure 22-5). Click Next.
f. 
If the IP address is ﬁctitious, for the purpose of completing the lab steps, the Add Standard 
TCP/IP Printer Port Wizard will be unable to identify the printing device. In the Additional 
Port Information Required dialog box, click the drop-down menu for Standard and select 
Hewlett Packard Jet Direct (see Figure 22-6). Click Next.
g. 
Review the port characteristics and click Finish (see Figure 22-7).

Lab Exercise 22.04: Maintaining  
and Troubleshooting Printers
It is estimated that technicians, especially those working for the help desk or desktop support group for a 
small to medium-sized organization, spend approximately 30 percent of their time on printer issues. If you 
think about it, of all the components used in computing technology, printers have the highest percentage 
of moving parts. Moving parts are more likely to need maintenance than are static components.
Printers also like to be ﬁnicky and stop printing, usually resulting in a phone call from the client to 
the help desk for quick resolution. The following exercises will help you develop some understanding of 
laser printer and inkjet printer maintenance, and what steps to take when they stop printing.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll research laser printer maintenance kits, clean dirty inkjet nozzles, and troubleshoot 
a failed print job.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Select a proper maintenance kit for various laser printers
• 
Clean and verify operation of inkjet nozzles
• 
Manage print jobs in Windows
• 
Restart a stalled print spooler

Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer with Windows installed
• 
A connection to the Internet
• 
Access to an inkjet printer
Getting Down to Business
The following exercises will round out your activities as you ﬁnish with the rollout of the ﬁve new 
printers in your ofﬁce. You will want to get your Internet connection ﬁred up again and research the 
maintenance kit available for your laser printer. Then you’ll check the print-head nozzles of the inkjet 
printers and run the cleaning routine if necessary. Finally, you should prepare for any print errors so 
that you can correct them quickly and efﬁciently.
Step 1  Laser printers are, by design, highly precise machines. They typically move thousands of 
sheets of paper per month through the printing mechanism, placing 1200–1600 dots per inch (DPI) of 
toner on each page. As such, toner cartridges need to be replaced from time to time and parts that 
wear out need to be refurbished. Most manufacturers offer a maintenance kit for the printer to assist 
in the upkeep of the printer when these common parts age or fail. It would be a good idea to have a 
maintenance kit on hand for each model of laser printer in your organization.
✔ Hint
Most of the current manufacturers of laser printers—Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, Kyocera, 
Canon, and so forth—offer some form of maintenance kit for their printers. You should be able 
to ﬁnd via an Internet search the available kits, their contents, and competitive pricing. Don’t 
be surprised to ﬁnd the maintenance kits somewhat costly, though they should still be only a 
fraction of the cost of replacing the printer.
Select a laser printer make and model, and perform an Internet search to identify the appropriate 
maintenance kit, its contents, and the average cost of the kit. Use this information to ﬁll in the 
following items:
Printer Model ______________________________________________________
Maintenance Kit ____________________________________________________
Contents __________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________
Price _____________________________________________________________

Chapter 22: Printers

Step 2  Though you have just installed new inkjet printers, if the printer sits idle for an extended 
period of time (a few weeks or months), or the ink cartridges have been replaced, you may need to 
check the print quality and clean the nozzles. The following steps were performed on an Epson Stylus 
PHOTO 890 but are similar to the steps required on HP and Lexmark inkjet printers. Consult the 
manual for speciﬁc instructions.
✖ Warning
The nozzle cleaning process uses a fair amount of the expensive ink. If you are working on a 
personal inkjet printer, or one in the classroom, after printing the nozzle check page, run the 
nozzle cleaning process only if required.
a. 
Open the Printer (& Faxes) folder (Start | Control Panel | Printers & Faxes/Printers) and 
highlight your inkjet printer.
b. 
Right-click the printer and select Properties.
c. 
Click the Printing Preferences button (see Figure 22-8).
Figure 22-8 Properties window showing Printing 
Preferences button

Figure 22-9 Utility tab under Printing Preferences
d. 
Select the Utility tab (see Figure 22-9) and click Nozzle Check. This will print a test pattern 
using the cyan, yellow, magenta, and black ink nozzles.
e. 
If the printout is not clear or there are dropouts, click Head Cleaning to clear the nozzles and 
then return to the Nozzle Check to verify performance.
Step 3  When you are called upon to troubleshoot a failed print job, you should follow a logical step-
by-step process to make sure that no obvious, possibly simple failure has occurred. If the power cord 
has been kicked out or the paper tray is open, troubleshooting the network connectivity or the printer 
driver would waste valuable time. Once you know the print device is online and ready and there are 
no paper jams or mechanical errors, then it might be time to open the Print Manager and attempt to 
restart the document.
The following steps are meant to be a rough guideline to troubleshoot and diagnose a failed print job:
a. 
First, check the physical print device:
• 
Is the printer plugged in, and is the power turned on?
• 
Is the printer out of paper or is there a paper jam?
• 
Is the toner low or in need of replacement?
• 
Are there any error messages on the printer’s LCD readout or any error indicator lights 
ﬂashing?
• 
Is the printer online and ready to print?

If you examine all of these areas and ﬁnd everything appears to be in working condition, then 
you may have a problem with the connectivity between the computer and the printer, or there 
may be problems with the document or drivers.
b. 
Make sure that the connections between the computer and the printer are in good condition 
and securely fastened. These may be USB, IEEE 1284 bidirectional parallel, or UTP using RJ-45 
connectors.
✔ Hint
To create a failed print job, disconnect the printer cable, shut the power off on the printer, or 
open the printer paper tray. If you do not have a physical printer, create a printer, following the 
steps in Lab Exercise 22.03. Send a print job to the printer; the printer icon should appear in the 
system tray and indicate that the print job has failed. Then continue with Step 3.
c. 
After checking all of the physical components, try to resend the document. Open the Print 
Manager by clicking the icon in the system tray/notiﬁcation area.
 
In the Print Manager, select the failed print job by highlighting the job with Error in the Status 
column (see Figure 22-10).
 
Select Documents | Restart. If you are creating the printer problem, the printer icon in the 
system tray/notiﬁcation area indicates that the print job has failed once again.
d. 
Highlight the document once again, and then select Documents | Cancel to delete the document.
If this were a real scenario, you would verify that the print drivers were installed and are the 
correct drivers for the operating system. You would then perform Step 4 to see if the problem is related 
to the print spooler.
Step 4  If the print device is online and ready, there are no paper jams or mechanical errors, and 
restarting the document is of no help, you can check to see if the print spooler is stalled. The print 
spooler is a holding area for print jobs and is especially important for network printers. If the print 
device runs out of paper while printing a document, you may have to stop and start the print spooler 
before the print device will receive jobs again.

In Chapter 15, you accomplished this task using the command line. Now you will use the Services 
snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to do the same thing, only more quickly and in 
a GUI.
a. 
Launch the Services console by opening Administrative Tools in the Control Panel and then 
double-clicking Services.
b. 
Scroll down and highlight Print Spooler. Select Action | Properties. You should see that the 
print spooler is started and running (see Figure 22-11).
c. 
Click the Stop button. The print spooler indicates that it has stopped.
d. 
Click the Start button. The print spooler indicates that it has started.
e. 
Alternatively, you can highlight Print Spooler in the Services console and select Action | 
Restart. You’ll see a message stating that the print spooler is stopping, and then another 
message indicating that the print spooler is starting.
In the real-world scenario, your print spooler service would be restarted, and you should have a 
healthy, functioning print server once again.

There’s no doubt about it—a PC technician will have networking issues 
to work through at some point. Whether it’s a three-computer, home-
based local area network (LAN), a public Wi-Fi access point, a large 
company with thousands of connected devices, or the Web itself, networks 
have become as common as PCs. The main consideration is no longer 
whether you’re going to network your computers—it’s now what method 
you’re going to use to network your computers.
A competent PC technician is called upon to be a network guru, 
answering connectivity questions and making recommendations on the 
best price/performance considerations for homes and businesses. This 
happens frequently, especially in smaller companies that can’t afford 
to hire multiple people to support both the network and the PCs. The 
CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation exams reﬂect these changing roles of the PC 
technician and include many questions related to computer networking.
In this chapter’s lab exercises, you’ll imagine that you’ve been hired 
to work for a small company that has made the decision to upgrade the 
network in their ofﬁce. You’ll need to have a working understanding of 
network hardware and network operating system issues, as well as some 
good troubleshooting tools for when things don’t work quite right.

Lab Exercise 23.01: Understanding Network Topologies
Networks don’t spontaneously come into being—they must be designed and laid out. Choosing the 
proper layout, or topology, is an important decision because each topology has its own advantages and 
disadvantages. Knowing how a network is put together and organized is an important part of setting 
one up.

Lab Exercise 23.01: Understanding Network Topologies
453
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll learn about network topologies.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Identify different network topologies
• 
Understand the beneﬁts and drawbacks of each topology
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A group of four people
• 
Any small object
Getting Down to Business
This is a group activity that works best in a classroom. If you are working alone or want more practice, 
you can achieve the same goals with a few more objects—instead of people, use cups or bowls to 
represent each device and a ball to represent the data going back and forth. For each demonstration, 
keep in mind the real-world components that would be involved. How many cables would it use? What 
special devices do you need? What if a component was broken?
Step 1 First, you’ll look at the star topology. A star topology has multiple computers connecting to a 
single, central wiring point (a hub). This is probably the one you are most familiar with, since most 
home networks are set up this way.
Have your group stand up and form a circle. Designate someone to stand in the middle and be the 
“hub.” Someone else should then begin by taking an object (the data) and passing it to the hub. The hub 
then passes it to someone else, who must ﬁrst pass it back to the hub before it can move anywhere 
else—remember that the object cannot pass directly from one computer to the next. It must ﬁrst move 
through the hub.
Write down your observations about this topology, including its advantages and disadvantages.

Chapter 23: Local Area Networking
454
Step 2 Next, you’ll look at the ring topology. In this topology, each device attaches to a central ring 
of cable to form a network. Have your group stand in a circle again. Begin passing the object clockwise 
around the circle. Remember that it cannot skip any person in the circle, nor can it cross to the other side.
Now have one person leave the circle, breaking the chain. The object cannot pass to the next person 
if the circle is broken, so the network becomes nonfunctional.
Write down your observations about this topology, including its advantages and disadvantages.
Step 3 Now you’ll look at a bus topology, where each device attaches to a single network cable. 
Instead of a circle, stand in a line with everyone facing the same direction. Have each person pass the 
object to the next person in the line, and when the object reaches the last person, pass the object back 
in the other direction.
Have one person step out of the line. The object cannot skip that person’s place, so the object now 
has to bounce back and forth between the people on one side of the missing person.
Write down your observations about this topology, including its advantages and disadvantages.
Step 4 Finally, you’ll look at a mesh topology. This topology connects every computer to every other 
computer, without the use of a bus or hub. Have everyone in the group stand in a circle again, and now 
pass the object to whomever you wish. Continue to do so, feeling free to pass it to the person next to 
you or across from you.

Local Area Network Hardware
Your boss has decided to upgrade the network in your ofﬁce, which is about ﬁve years old. With the 
changes in networking technology, he wants your ideas about purchasing the right equipment for the 
upgrade. Your company is a small one, so the task is quite doable, but you need to make sure you know 
what you’re talking about before you give your report.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll familiarize yourself with networking hardware.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Identify different kinds of network cabling
• 
Identify different network interface cards (NICs)
• 
Identify different types of network hubs
• 
Identify different wireless networking devices
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Access to a PC running Windows
• 
Access to a working LAN and the Internet (you may have demonstration devices provided by 
your instructor)

Chapter 23: Local Area Networking
456
Getting Down to Business
One of the best ways to ﬁnd out what a network is made of is to physically look at all of its pieces. Even 
then, however, it may be necessary to access a manufacturer’s Web site to see, for instance, if the “hub” 
you’re using is really a hub or a switch.
Step 1 If you have access to a LAN (the classroom computer lab network, a friend’s home network, or 
your company’s network), spend some time exploring the physical hardware connections and devices. 
If possible, acquire the diagram of the physical layout of the network, or create a simple diagram of 
the layout to familiarize yourself with the various devices and connections associated with the network 
you’re analyzing.
✖ Warning
Don’t disconnect anything, and be careful while probing around. One small mistake, like 
removing a cable or turning off the wrong device, can disrupt the entire network. If you’re 
using the classroom network, ask the instructor what you can and can’t remove while you make 
closer inspections of the cables and devices.
✔ Cross-Reference
Be sure to check out Chapter 23 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs 
for help identifying network cables and connectors. It’s a good idea to have the textbook handy 
while you progress through this lab.
 What sort of cabling does the network use, or is it wireless? Is it twisted-pair cable or older coaxial 
cable? Are the cable ends RJ-45 connectors? Describe the physical layout of the LAN here.
 What sort of NICs do the machines have? Describe the back of the card. Does it have a single 
connector or a combination of connectors (see Figure 23-1)? Does it have an antenna? Is there a link 
and/or activity LED? Which of the LEDs is on steady? Which is ﬂashing? Describe the NIC here.

Lab Exercise 23.02: Identifying Local Area Network Hardware
457
✔ Hint
It is very important to understand the difference between the link light vs. the activity light. 
First, these “lights” are really light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and will usually appear in some form 
of yellow, orange, or green color, depending on the NIC manufacturer. Second, the link light 
indicates that the NIC and the cable have a valid electrical connection between the PC and the 
network device, usually a hub or a switch. This does not guarantee connectivity—it just means 
that the electrical connection is intact. The activity light is a better indicator of whether or not 
the NIC, cable, and hubs or switches are working. When the activity light blinks, it is indicating 
that data is being transferred between the networking devices. It does not guarantee that the 
data is usable—it just means that data is making the trip from the NIC to the hub or switch, 
or from the hub or switch to the NIC. If you are having trouble connecting to a network or 
communicating to other machines on the network, the link and activity lights are a good place 
to start your troubleshooting.
Step 2 Hubs and switches are a part of the majority of networks.
 Are the PCs connected with a single cable (crossover cable limited to two PCs), or are they connected 
to a hub/switch (see Figure 23-2)? Is part of the network wireless? What is the model number of 
the network hub/switch? Who manufactures the hub/switch? How many devices can be attached? 
Record your ﬁndings here.
Figure 23-1 A network interface card (NIC)

Chapter 23: Local Area Networking
458
 Is the hub or switch a standard single-speed (10BaseT, for instance) device, or can it handle multiple 
speeds (10/100/1000 Mbps)? Does it have wireless capabilities? Record your ﬁndings here. If this 
information isn’t apparent or printed on the cabinet, ask the instructor or the network administrator.
Step 3 Are you going to have a wireless network or wireless devices in your network? Do you plan on 
installing a wireless network sometime in the near future? In the current world of networking, the 
terms hub, switch, and router are often used interchangeably, but they really are very different devices 
with very different functions. Conduct an Internet search on the deﬁnition of each device. 
 Compare and contrast each type of device. How do they achieve their functionality? Where or for 
what purpose does it makes sense to use each device? Where is each device in the OSI (Open System 
Interconnection) seven-layer model?

Lab Exercise 23.03: Exploring Local Area Network 
Conﬁguration Options
You’ve made your recommendation, and you’ve installed the network. The hardware side of installing a 
basic LAN is really simple these days, so you managed to get that put together in a ﬂash. Now it’s time 
to conﬁgure the PCs that connect to the network.
To prepare for the CompTIA A+ exams, and to build your toolbox of skills as a PC technician, you 
need to be able to set up, conﬁgure, and troubleshoot networks that use Windows clients. From a network 
conﬁguration standpoint, each version of Windows is very similar. The CompTIA A+ exams will test 
your conﬁguration knowledge for all three versions of Windows, including the paths you use to locate 
conﬁguration settings.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll explore the network conﬁguration options in a Windows environment.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Conﬁgure network access using the networking applets
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Access to a PC with Windows installed
• 
Access to the LAN
✔ Hint
I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but if possible, you should repeat the exercises in 
each edition of Windows. If you only have a single operating system, be sure you understand 
how to conﬁgure networks in the other operating system environments. It’s also a good idea to 
have the drivers for your NICs handy just in case you need to reload any of them. Finally, you’ll 
want to determine the relevant settings (in other words, the proper protocol, the name[s] of the 
workgroup[s] you’ll be using, and so on); write them down, and keep them with you as you go 
from computer to computer.

Chapter 23: Local Area Networking
460
Getting Down to Business
For a computer to gain access to or share resources on a network, it must have a NIC installed and 
conﬁgured. Microsoft provides conﬁguration wizards to set up your network with mostly default 
parameters and a lot of assumptions. In other words, you tell it the computer name, and it does the 
rest. Using the Microsoft wizards will allow you to set up a default conﬁguration for quick access (good 
for at home), but this may not always work for a LAN in a business environment.
Whether you use the wizards or manually conﬁgure the system, the following steps must be 
accurately programmed into the software or you won’t be able to take full advantage of the LAN. For 
the CompTIA A+ exams, you need to know where to locate and how to modify the network conﬁguration. 
Speciﬁcally, each computer that will be connected to the LAN must have the following:
• 
A NIC with correct drivers installed
• 
Client software, such as Client for Microsoft Networks
• 
Protocols (what language[s] you’ll use on the network and the settings)
• 
Services, such as File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks
• 
A computer name
• 
A workgroup name
Step 1 Go to Device Manager and verify that the correct NIC drivers are installed. Reinstall the driver 
if necessary.
In Device Manager, expand Network adapters. Right-click your network card and select Properties. 
Click the Driver tab to see what driver is installed or to update the driver.
Step 2 In this step, you’ll verify what network services are installed.
In Windows 2000, go to the Control Panel, double-click Network and Dial-Up Connections, right-click 
Local Area Connection, and select Properties. In Windows XP, go to Control Panel | Network Connections. 
Right-click Local Area Connection and select Properties. In Windows Vista, go to the Control Panel and 
open the Network and Sharing Center. In the Tasks menu on the left, click Manage network connections. 
Right-click Local Area Connection and select Properties.
✔ Hint
Nothing is necessarily wrong if you don’t see any or all of the following components listed or if 
you see more than the ones listed previously. It simply means that the network conﬁguration 
hasn’t been completed on your system, or it’s in a network supported by more than one server.

Lab Exercise 23.03: Exploring Local Area Network Conﬁ guration Options
461
You should ﬁnd the following components listed in a selection window. Your system may have 
others as well.
• 
Client Client for Microsoft Networks (default)
• 
Protocol TCP/IP (default)
• 
Service File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks
 
What client(s), other than the default, are listed in your system? _______________________

What protocol(s), other than the default, are listed? _________________________________
 
___________________________________________________________________________
 
What services, other than the default, are listed? ____________________________________
 
___________________________________________________________________________
Step 3 Now that you’ve found the network conﬁguration screen, take a look at the various options:
• 
Install The Install button enables you to add network components. Clicking the Install 
button gives you three choices:
• 
Client Adds a client to the conﬁguration (must have at least one).
• 
Protocol Microsoft TCP/IP is the default (must have a protocol to communicate).
• 
Service File and Printer Sharing must be enabled for other computers on the network to 
access the one on which you’re working.
• 
Remove/Uninstall The Remove or Uninstall button enables you to remove network 
components.
• 
Properties The Properties button displays a variety of dialog boxes based on the network 
component selected.
✔ Hint
Each of the preceding options asks questions about what you want to change. If one or more of 
your required settings are missing, use this screen to add them. When you make changes, you may 
be asked to reboot the system.
Step 4 Now that your system is conﬁgured for networking, you need to have an identity for it and 
join a workgroup to be recognized by the network and access network resources.

Chapter 23: Local Area Networking
462
In Windows 2000, go to Control Panel and double-click System. Open the Network Identiﬁcation tab. 
In Windows XP, do the same, but select the Computer Name tab. Windows Vista is also the same, but the 
information should be displayed all on one screen. Record your system settings here:
Computer name _____________________________________
Workgroup name ____________________________________
Step 5 Now that you’ve conﬁrmed and recorded the networking components, your computer name, 
and your workgroup, the next step is to practice reinstalling your network adapter.
✖ Warning
This step is optional and can cause you grief if you aren’t prepared. Ask the instructor 
if it’s okay for you to proceed with this step. If not (or if you think this may harm your 
conﬁguration), skip this step.
Access Device Manager, and uninstall your network adapter. Yes, this will erase all your network 
settings. Did you take good notes earlier? Expand the Network adapters heading, right-click your speciﬁc 
adapter, and choose Remove or Uninstall.
✖ Warning
If your notes are incomplete, ask the instructor to ﬁll in the correct settings you’re missing.
Reboot your system, and the adapter will be detected (if it’s plug and play) and installed. Access the 
Network Connections applet, and verify your network conﬁguration using the information you recorded 
in Steps 1, 2, and 4 previously. If your system doesn’t load the drivers for the network card, you’ll need 
the driver disc to complete your settings.
Test your system by accessing the network. Can you browse the network now? Look in My Network 
Places/Network. ________________________________

Lab Exercise 23.04: Verifying TCP/IP Settings
As you are probably aware, TCP/IP has emerged as the standard transport protocol for network 
communication. Microsoft operating systems normally use Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP), 
which automatically retrieves and assigns client TCP/IP settings from a DHCP server. This makes it 

Lab Exercise 23.04: Verifying TCP/IP Settings
463
easy to set up a small home or business network of PCs. All systems in the network will communicate 
with each other using these settings. The problem is that most businesses have their own set of TCP/IP 
settings (either automatically conﬁgured through DHCP or manually conﬁgured) that must be used for 
all new or repaired systems introduced into the network. Your responsibility as a PC technician is to 
verify the TCP/IP settings.
✔ Cross-Reference
To review additional details of TCP/IP, re-read the “Conﬁguring TCP/IP” section in Chapter 23 of 
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll access and verify the TCP/IP settings for a given PC system.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Deﬁne Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
• 
Use the IPCONFIG command-line utility
• 
Manually conﬁgure the TCP/IP settings on a PC
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC system that’s properly conﬁgured for LAN access using Windows
• 
A list of TCP/IP settings provided by the instructor
Getting Down to Business
Typically, in corporate environments, the network protocol conﬁguration scheme has been deﬁned 
by the senior systems administrators. Unless you’ve had some experience with the conﬁguration, you 
would not automatically know all of the TCP/IP settings for a network. For instance, even when you’re 
setting up a small network (one that connects to the Internet), you’ll need to contact your Internet 
service provider (ISP) to set up your router’s TCP/IP settings. So don’t worry if you have no idea what 
settings to use. The trick is to learn how to get to them.
TCP/IP requires each system to have two basic settings for accessing a LAN and two additional 
settings for accessing other LANs or the Internet. You can conﬁgure your system to automatically 

Chapter 23: Local Area Networking
464
obtain the following settings when you log on (Microsoft’s default settings), or you can specify them, 
depending on the requirements of your network:
• 
IP address (unique to the PC)
• 
Subnet mask (identiﬁes network information)
• 
Gateway (address of the router to the external realm)
• 
Domain Name Service (DNS)
Step 1 First, you’ll locate and verify your current TCP/IP settings.
a. 
Return to the Local Area Connection Properties dialog box you located in Step 2 of Lab Exercise 
23.03. Highlight the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) entry and click the Properties button. When 
the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties screen appears, one of the setting options shown in 
Figure 23-3 will be selected.
b. 
If the settings are manually conﬁgured, you will be able to verify them in the TCP/IP 
Properties dialog box. Write the settings down and verify them with the settings given to you 
by the instructor.

c. 
If the system is conﬁgured to use the Microsoft Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) 
settings or if the network has a DHCP server (ask the instructor), the Obtain an IP address 
automatically and Obtain DNS server address automatically radio buttons will be selected. You will 
not be able to verify the values of the TCP/IP settings from this window. Close this window by 
clicking OK. To verify the settings, launch a command-line window and, at the prompt, type 
the following command:
C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\>IPCONFIG /ALL
 This produces a listing similar to the one shown in Figure 23-4. Use these values to ﬁll in the 
following settings and then verify them with your instructor.
IP Address ________________________________________________________
Subnet Mask ______________________________________________________
Default Gateway ___________________________________________________
DNS Server _______________________________________________________
Step 2 You should be familiar with one ﬁnal conﬁguration: Automatic Private IP Addressing, or 
APIPA. If Windows is conﬁgured to obtain an IP address automatically and no DHCP server is available, 
Microsoft will automatically conﬁgure an address in the 169.254.0.0 network. Follow these steps to 
explore APIPA:
a. 
In a classroom lab environment, have the instructor disable the DHCP server if applicable. 
Alternatively, you can disconnect the DHCP server’s UTP cable from the hub or switch.
Figure 23-4 Windows IPCONFIG /ALL command results on a system conﬁgured 
to use DHCP

Chapter 23: Local Area Networking
466
b. 
Verify that your TCP/IP Properties settings are set to Obtain an IP address automatically and Obtain 
DNS server address automatically. Close all windows and reboot the system.
c. 
Launch a command-line window and, at the prompt, type the following command:
C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\>IPCONFIG /ALL
This produces a listing similar to the one shown in Figure 23-5. Use these values to ﬁll in the 
following settings and then verify them with your instructor.
IP Address ____________________________________________________________
Subnet Mask __________________________________________________________
Default Gateway _______________________________________________________
DNS Server ___________________________________________________________
d. 
Exit the command-line window and launch the TCP/IP Properties window again. Return all 
settings to the normal classroom conﬁguration. Click OK to ﬁnish, and close all the windows. 
Reboot the system, and verify that it’s working properly and that you have reestablished 
network communication to its prior state.

Lab Exercise 23.05: Sharing Resources
With the network all set up properly, the next thing to do is decide how you want to share resources. 
You can share any folder or other resource. Optical drives, hard drives, and printers can all be shared.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll set up ﬁle sharing for others to access information from their system.

Whew! That last exercise was interesting, but the job is only half done. Now you’ll ﬁnd where to set up 
sharing for a particular resource.
Step 1 Open My Computer/Computer, double-click the C: drive, and create a new folder on the C: drive. 
Name it Shared. Right-click the Shared folder icon to see the folder options, and select Sharing and 
Security in Windows XP or Share in Windows Vista. This will open the Shared Properties dialog box 
with the Sharing tab selected (see Figure 23-6).

✔ Hint
If the Sharing tab isn’t there, you probably forgot to enable the File and Printer Sharing option 
in the Networking applet. Go back and do that.
✔ Hint
If you’re running Windows XP Home Edition or Windows XP Professional Edition in a 
workgroup environment, the Sharing tab is much simpler. It contains Do not share this folder/Share 
this folder buttons and a space to provide a share name.
Step 2 Try sharing and unsharing the folder. This should be familiar to you since it’s exactly the 
same as what you did in Chapter 16. Note that the share name and permissions are grayed out when 
you select Do not share this folder. Share the folder again, change the share name, and look at the various 
levels of permissions: Full Control, Change, and Read.
Step 3 When you’re done, click OK to close the dialog box.

Lab Exercise 23.06: Testing Your LAN Connections
Various tools are available that will help you test and troubleshoot your new network. The textbook 
covers using these tools in detail. Some of these tools will be beneﬁcial to you as a CompTIA A+ certiﬁed 
technician and are covered on the CompTIA A+ exams. This lab exercise lets you practice using several 
key network troubleshooting tools.
Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you’ll be introduced to troubleshooting tools for determining proper installation of 
the network components. These tools are covered in order of importance. First, you’ll verify the local 
settings. Next, you’ll try to access other systems on the same LAN. Finally, you’ll test the Internet 
connectivity.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Use the IPCONFIG command to determine local network settings
• 
Use the NET CONFIG command to check the local system name and who is logged on as a user
• 
Use the PING command to test the local TCP/IP software and adapter
• 
Use the NET VIEW command to check for other computers on the network
• 
Use the PING command with switches to test connectivity to other computers

Lab Exercise 23.06: Testing Your LAN Connections
469
• 
Use the NSLOOKUP command to translate IP addresses and domain names
• 
Use the TRACERT command to check the path to other computers
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC system that’s properly conﬁgured for network access using Windows
• 
Access to the Internet
✔ Hint
The commands vary slightly, depending on the operating system you use. You should practice 
with each operating system if possible. Test the LAN ﬁrst by accessing another computer on the 
network using My Network Places/Network.
Getting Down to Business
As a PC technician, you should be familiar with several networking tools, both for your own good and 
because they’re covered on the CompTIA A+ exams. You’ll begin by looking at IPCONFIG.
✔ Hint
Since you have already used the IPCONFIG /ALL command, run through the steps again, either 
on your own system or on a different lab machine. Ask the instructor if any different networks 
or system conﬁgurations are available to explore.
Step 1 You have already examined IPCONFIG in Lab Exercise 23.04. You’ll now use the IPCONFIG 
command again to determine local network settings. As you have already learned, checking the 
automatic TCP/IP settings given to you by a DHCP server and verifying your manual settings is easy: 
just open a command-line window, type IPCONFIG /ALL, and press ENTER. The details of your local 
network connection appear on the screen.
 Does the display contain the settings that were automatically assigned by the DHCP server or the 
ones you entered manually? _______________________
Record your settings here:
IP Address _______________________________________________________________
Subnet Mask ______________________________________________________________
Default Gateway ___________________________________________________________
DNS Servers ______________________________________________________________

Chapter 23: Local Area Networking
470
✔ Hint
If you have a system in a peer-to-peer network (no servers) and there are no routers installed, 
you won’t see information about gateways and DNS. What may appear are Windows Internet 
Naming Service (WINS) settings. More of this would be covered in the coursework for the 
CompTIA Network+ certiﬁcation.
Leave the command-prompt window open; you’ll use it throughout the rest of this exercise.
Step 2 You’ll now use the NET CONFIG command to check the local system name and to see who is 
logged on as a user. To conﬁrm the computer name and discover who is currently logged on, you’ll 
again use the command line.
Type NET CONFIG WORKSTATION at the command prompt and press ENTER. You’ll see how the 
identiﬁcation is set up for your local PC. There’s a lot of information listed, but you’re only interested 
in a couple of items (see Figure 23-7).
How are these listed?
Computer name _________________________________________________________
User name _____________________________________________________________
Workstation domain (workgroup) ___________________________________________
Software version ________________________________________________________
Step 3 You’ll now use the PING command to test the local TCP/IP software and adapter.
Figure 23-7 Using the NET CONFIG WORKSTATION command in Windows XP

Lab Exercise 23.06: Testing Your LAN Connections
471
At the command-line prompt, type PING 127.0.0.1 (including the periods) and press ENTER. This is 
known as the IPv4 LOOPBACK or LOCALHOST address and will test the TCP/IP software and the internal 
part of the local network card. Look at Figure 23-8 to see a successful test. If you don’t see the test 
results, there are serious problems with the software. Reinstall your network drivers, and reconﬁgure 
the TCP/IP settings.
Step 4 You’ll now use the NET VIEW command to check for other computers on the network. 
You want to establish that other computers are available on the network so that you can test that 
your network card can transmit and receive data in Step 5.
At the command-line prompt, type NET VIEW and press ENTER. You’ll see what other computers are 
on the network by a listing of their computer names (see Figure 23-9).
Step 5 Now you’ll use the PING command to test your ability to connect to other computers on the 
network.
In Step 4 you obtained the names of other systems on the LAN, so now you want to check whether 
you can actually communicate with them.
Figure 23-8 A successful PING test
Figure 23-9 Using the NET VIEW command

Chapter 23: Local Area Networking
472
At the command line prompt, type PING computer name, where computer name is another PC’s HOST 
name on the network you found in Step 4, and press ENTER. The results will look the same as when you 
used PING to see your own computer, but with the other computer’s IP address (see Figure 23-10). Be sure 
to put a space between the PING command and the computer name. If you get errors, use the NET VIEW 
command again to be certain of the computer name’s spelling. If the DNS is down, you can adjust by 
pinging the other computer’s IP address instead of its name.
➜ Try This: PING Switches
The humble PING command is one of the most frequently used troubleshooting tools for TCP/IP. 
As you saw in Step 5, you can actually use PING to test whether DNS is working. If you do not 
receive a response from the computer using its HOST name, but you do receive a response when 
using the IP address, this points to a problem with DNS.
PING also has a number of switches that add to the functionality of the command. If you need 
to explore the switches, type the following at the command prompt:
C:\>PING /?
This will list all of the available switches and their functions. The following combination 
is typically used for a connection that seems to drop packets intermittently. You would run 
the command indeﬁnitely and increase the packet size to overload the connection. Type the 
following command:
C:\>PING -t -l 65000 computername
To stop the continuous PING, press CTRL-C to break the program.
Figure 23-10 Using the PING command

Lab Analysis Test
473
Step 6 You’ll now use the NSLOOKUP command to translate an Internet domain name to an IP 
address or an IP address to an Internet domain name.
This is a good command for ﬁnding out the IP addresses of Web sites. Why do I want this, you ask? 
Well, when you use a URL in your browser, it has to be translated somewhere to an IP address. This 
slows down your access time. If you know the IP address and type that into the address of your Internet 
browser, the site will pop up faster. Follow these steps:
a. 
Type NSLOOKUP microsoft.com, and then press ENTER.
 
What’s the IP address(es) of http://www.microsoft.com? ______________________________ 
 
Try NSLOOKUP totalsem.com. 
 
What’s the IP address(es) of http://www.totalsem.com? _______________________________
b. 
Now enter the IP address you got when you did a lookup for http://www.microsoft.com. If you 
get a different result, it could be that a Web site is being hosted by someone other than the 
original domain you looked up.
Step 7 You’ll now use the TRACERT command to check the path to other computers or Web sites on 
the Internet.
This command will show you where the bottlenecks are in the Internet. The TRACERT command will 
list the time it takes to get from your PC to the Web site or other system you’re accessing. Follow these steps:
a. 
Type TRACERT google.com, and then press ENTER.
 
Was it successful? ________________________________________________________
 
How many hops did it take? ________________________________________________
 
What’s the IP address of the ﬁrst hop? ________________________________________
b. 
Use the NSLOOKUP command with the IP address of the ﬁrst hop to see where your ﬁrst server 
is located.
Go ahead—have fun with this! Part of the learning process with PCs is to dive in and tackle 
a subject that you’re not completely familiar with. As long as you remember to write down any 
information you want to change before you change it, you can enjoy exploring the amazing world of 
computers and still have a recovery point.

Wireless networks are so common today that most people don’t take 
the time to understand the differences between a hard-wired network 
and a wireless one. With mobile computing on the rise, it’s important 
for CompTIA A+ certiﬁed technicians to know as much about wireless 
networks as possible so that they are prepared to provide quality service 
in any situation to the users they support. New technicians may be asked 
questions like, “When should you set up a network with a server,” and, 
“How do you set up a wireless network?” If you’ve already read Chapter 24  
in Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs, you 
realize that you need to know not only how to set up a wireless network, 
but also how to conﬁgure and secure that network. In this chapter’s 
lab exercises, you’ll set up, conﬁgure, and secure a couple of wireless 
networks so that you are prepared to do the same in a real-world setting.

Lab Exercise 24.01: Setting Up a Wireless Network
Your neighbor is interested in starting a home business and has asked you to help him set up a wireless 
network. The only equipment he currently has is a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile 
phone, and a USB printer, all of which he is considering using with his business. His main goal is to be 
able to communicate with his clients wirelessly from any room in his house. He’s asked you to help him 
decide what additional equipment he needs to purchase.
Learning Objectives
This lab tests basic wireless network setup skills and helps you to think about scenarios you might 
encounter.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Recommend proper wireless equipment (for example, wireless cards and routers)
• 
Identify solutions for proper placement of equipment
• 
Set up and conﬁgure a wireless router

Lab Exercise 24.01: Setting Up a Wireless Network
477
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working desktop computer running Windows, with some form of broadband Internet 
connection
• 
A laptop with wireless connectivity
• 
Two Ethernet cables
• 
A wireless router
Getting Down to Business
First, you will need to tell your friend that he needs to buy a wireless router, and, if his laptop doesn’t 
have a Wi-Fi adapter, he’ll need one of those, too. Once he’s purchased the necessary equipment, he 
needs to connect it. It may seem strange, but you have to plug in several cables (“wires”) when you set 
up a wireless network. 
Step 1 Figure out how your neighbor’s computer is physically connected to the Internet. If you are at 
home, chances are that he has either a DSL or cable modem that connects to his computer via an Ethernet 
cable. In order to set up the wireless network, disconnect the Ethernet cable from your computer.
Step 2 Plug the Ethernet cable running from the wall jack or modem into the back of the wireless 
router. There is often a speciﬁc jack labeled “Internet” for you to use. Plug in the router and turn it on, 
if it doesn’t turn on automatically. The router is ready when all the lights remain on and steady. There 
may be one or two blinking lights—it’s okay.
Step 3 Now plug one end of the second Ethernet cable into the wireless router and the other end 
into the desktop computer’s RJ45 Ethernet port. You may be thinking that this wireless network isn’t 
looking very wireless so far, but think of it this way: how often do you pick up your entire desktop 
setup and move it into another room? Not very often, I’d wager.
Step 4 Now that all the cables are in place, go to the laptop and see if you can ﬁnd the wireless 
network. For Windows 2000, you’ll need to know the SSID (which you’ll learn more about in the next 
two labs). Once you have the SSID, open the Control Panel, go to Network and Dial-up Connections, and 
right-click the wireless connection. Under the Connect using box, click Advanced. Switch to the Advanced 
tab and click SSID. Type in the name of your network here. If there is no option to enter an SSID, then 
you probably chose the wrong network adapter from the Network and Dial-up Connections applet.
In Windows XP and Vista, a pop-up (see Figure 24-1) will alert you when Windows has located a new 
network connection—so much simpler! It will display the name of the wireless network (something 
generic at this point) and the signal strength.

Lab Exercise 24.02: Conﬁguring  
and Securing a Wireless Network
Now that you’ve installed a wireless router, you must conﬁgure it properly so that it is secure from 
pesky invaders. Be sure to follow these step-by-step instructions so you can reduce the chances of your 
data being exposed, stolen, or attacked by hackers.
Learning Objectives
This lab enables you to conﬁgure and secure your network.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Properly conﬁgure a wireless router
• 
Set up security options to keep intruders out
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working desktop computer running Windows with some form of Internet connection
• 
A laptop with wireless connectivity
• 
A wireless router
Getting Down to Business
Failing to conﬁgure and secure a wireless network is like leaving your debit card on the sidewalk outside 
your house with the PIN written on it—chances are that someone will take advantage of the situation 
and do something unscrupulous. Conﬁguring and securing your wireless network is a fairly easy task. 
Just be sure to do it. Many people will simply hook up a wireless router, turn it on, and go about their 
business, not realizing what they’ve opened themselves up to. For the sake of your private data and the 
Internet you are paying for, follow the steps in this lab exercise.
Keep in mind that conﬁguring a wireless network depends heavily on the router/wireless access 
point being used. The following steps lead you through the basics, but for more details, check the 
manual that came with your device.
Step 1 To secure your wireless network, you will use the conﬁguration tool included with your 
router/wireless access point. To access it, open a Web browser and type 192.168.1.1 (or sometimes 
192.168.0.1) into the address bar. This is the most common address used for the setup utility. You may 
get a pop-up dialog box or other screen asking for a user name and password. Again, the defaults for 
these are often admin and password. This is true across multiple brands, which is all the more reason 
to change them as soon as possible!

Lab Exercise 24.02: Conﬁ guring and Securing a Wireless Network
479
Step 2 You should now be in the setup utility. Different devices use different names, but look for 
the Wireless Settings page (see Figure 24-2). If it’s not called that, look for a screen with options for 
network name, security options, or MAC address options. Once you’ve found it, ﬁnd the box used 
to enter a network name, or SSID. Delete the one that is there already and create a new one that is 
unique but memorable. This is so that when you start picking up other wireless signals, you will be 
able to know which one is your own and connect to it.
Step 3 Usually on the same page as the network name are wireless network security options. These 
include choices such as WEP, WPA, WPA2, and None. In this case, None is not acceptable. If it’s 
available, select WPA2; otherwise, select WPA. WEP is an older encryption technology that is far less 
secure. There should also be an empty box labeled “password” or “passphrase” or “pre-shared key.” 
Enter a unique and memorable password to be used whenever you want to connect to the wireless 
network. Save these settings.
Figure 24-2 The Wireless Settings page for a wireless router

Chapter 24: Wireless Networking
480
Step 4 Finally, now that you’ve secured the wireless connection itself by enabling WPA2 or another 
encryption option, you need to secure the router itself. Remember that 99 percent of routers use 
“admin” and “password” as the user name and password to access the router’s setup utility. Failing to 
change these is an invitation to intruders. Find the setup utility’s administration options, or something 
similar, and change the user name and password to something unique and memorable.

Lab Exercise 24.03: Setting Up  
an Ad Hoc Wireless Network
Okay, so you’ve set up a traditional wireless network and learned how to secure it. But what if all you 
really want to do is play a game with someone, share some ﬁles, or search the Internet without a bunch 
of wires and a router? In CompTIA A+ terminology, we would call this an ad hoc peer-to-peer network.
Learning Objectives
This lab gives you another option for setting up a network.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Connect two or more computers together wirelessly
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
Two computers with wireless connectivity and Windows XP or Windows Vista installed
Getting Down to Business
The process for setting up an ad hoc wireless network is even simpler than the process for setting up 
a normal wireless network. However, due in part to their temporary nature, they’re not nearly as 
common. Still, the next time you’ve got two laptops, no network, and you desperately need to share 
some ﬁles, you’ll be glad you know how to set one up.
Step 1 (XP) In Windows XP, open the Control Panel and double-click Network Connections. Right-
click Wireless Network Connection and click Properties. In the Wireless Network Connection Properties 
window, select the Wireless Networks tab. Verify that the Use Windows to conﬁgure my wireless network 
settings box is selected. If it is not, select it. Click Add.
Step 2 (XP) The Wireless network properties window opens (see Figure 24-3). In the Network name 
(SSID) text box, enter the name of the network you want to add. I suggest calling it something simple, 
like ad hoc. Create a password and conﬁrm it. Uncheck the The key is provided for me automatically checkbox

and check the This is a computer-to-computer (ad hoc) network; wireless access points are not used checkbox. 
Click OK. You are returned to the Wireless Network tab, and the new network name appears in the 
Preferred networks list.
Step 1 (Vista) In Windows Vista, go to the Control Panel and open the Network and Sharing Center. 
Select Manage wireless networks and click Add. From the options given, choose Create an ad hoc network. 
Click Next, and then create a simple network name. Select a security type from the menu provided 
(WPA2 is preferred) and enter a password. Select Save This Network and click Next. You’ve now set up 
an ad hoc wireless network.

Chapter 25: The Internet
484
The Internet is a complex system of communication that allows 
computers, in-business networks, mobile computers, and home PCs to 
share information worldwide. Today we even have cell phones, personal 
digital assistants (PDAs), and other personal devices that we can use to 
connect to the Internet and access e-mail, download MP3s, and do other 
tasks.
Because nearly everyone wants access to the Internet, implementing 
and troubleshooting Internet connectivity is a PC technician’s bread 
and butter. The CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation exams recognize this and test 
you on the details of installing and conﬁguring a connection to the 
Internet. It may be a legacy dial-up analog modem used to connect to an 
ISP through a phone line, or a broadband cable modem using the local 
cable company as the provider. This heightened usage brings with it a 
new task for the PC technician: Internet security! Since most computers 
are now communicating with the world through the Internet, the 
exposure to malicious intruders and programs has greatly increased. Two 
components that go hand-in-hand with the Internet are ﬁrewalls and 
wireless network security. You just ﬁnished setting up and conﬁguring 
the hardware portion of a wireless network in the last chapter, so now 
you’ll look at the software side of network security. This chapter’s lab 
exercises ﬁrst guide you through the properties of the current wide area 
network (WAN) connection technologies and then take you through 
the steps needed to perform the installation and conﬁguration of these 
technologies. You’ll also explore the conﬁguration of Windows Firewall 
and Windows Internet Connection Sharing and learn how to upgrade to 
the latest version of the Internet Explorer browser.

Lab Exercise 25.01: Identifying Internet  
Connectivity Properties
A new client has signed up with your ﬁrm, requesting that you evaluate their current Internet 
connectivity and recommend the best upgrade path for their 12-person ofﬁce (six desktop PCs and two 
laptops). Your ﬁrst job is to assess what method they are currently using to connect to the Internet and 
what methods are available in their location, and to make a recommendation for upgrades if necessary.
Learning Objectives
This lab exercise tests basic assessment skills. Every technician should be able to go into a situation 
and quickly understand the state of the technology in question—in this case, an Internet connection. 
You should also feel comfortable telling your clients about any concerns with aging technology and feel 
conﬁdent recommending upgrade paths to higher-performance technology.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Verify the Internet connectivity method
• 
Check the properties of the connection
• 
Perform an Internet search to learn about the performance of various connectivity methods

Getting Down to Business
First, you will visually inspect your computer and its surroundings for the method used to connect 
to the Internet. Then you will run an Internet utility to determine the speed of your connection and 
appropriate upgrade paths.
Step 1  Look at the back of your computer:
• 
Is there a phone cable (RJ-11) plugged in? This could indicate that this computer is using an 
analog modem for the Internet connection.
• 
Are there any USB or network (RJ-45) cables plugged into the system? Trace the wires. Do they 
connect to a cable modem or DSL modem? This could be your connectivity method.
• 
Is there a network patch cable plugged into the NIC? You may be connecting to the Internet 
through the corporate LAN.
• 
Are you on a laptop with wireless connectivity? You could have access to the Internet through 
a wireless access point (WAP) connected to a cable or DSL modem.
These are the possibilities a technician is faced with today, so the more you can explore the various 
methods of connectivity, the more knowledgeable you will be. Figure 25-1 depicts a typical PC using a 
wired LAN patch cable to connect to a broadband cable modem. 
 
Examine the physical components that constitute the method your system uses to connect to the 
Internet and then record the details of the hardware/connectivity type here. 
Step 2  Once you have determined the connectivity method, boot your system and launch your 
Internet browser (popular browsers include Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google 
Chrome). In the address bar, type http://reviews.cnet.com/internet-speed-test/ and press ENTER. This 
will take you to CNET’s Bandwidth Meter Online Speed Test. Follow the onscreen instructions to test 
the speed of your connection.

Step 4  Based on the results of the analysis of your client’s Internet connection method and performance, 
are there any recommendations you would make to improve the performance of the connection?
S 30 minutes
Lab Exercise 25.02: Installing and Conﬁguring  
an Internet Connection
You determine that the client is currently using dial-up networking through analog modems to access 
the Internet. Though this is probably acceptable for occasionally connecting to the Internet, these folks 
have a business to run! You decide to recommend either high-speed DSL or cable. You explain to the 
client that unlike the analog modem they’re currently using, the other methods use a standard network 
interface card (NIC) and an external device to interface between the DSL or cable lines. Ironically, this 
device is usually referred to as a DSL or cable modem. You will evaluate the current PCs and select one 
that will act as the interface to the Internet. If required, you’ll add a PCI or PCIe NIC, connect the DSL 
or cable interface, and then conﬁgure the interface in Windows.
Learning Objectives
Installing DSL or cable high-speed Internet access requires four steps. First, you should verify whether 
your system is already equipped with a NIC, either integrated into the motherboard or as a PCI/PCIe 
card, and if not, physically install such a device. Second, verify that this device is operating properly 
and has the latest drivers installed. Third, connect the DSL transceiver or the cable modem, and ﬁnally, 
conﬁgure the proper settings required by the ISP.

• 
Install a network interface card (if not already present)
• 
Verify proper operation, and install or update the drivers
•

✔ Cross-Reference
Refer to the “DSL” and “Cable” sections in Chapter 25 and the “Installing Expansion Cards” 
section in Chapter 8 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs for help 
installing and conﬁguring NICs. It’s a good idea to have the textbook handy while you progress 
through this lab.
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A PC system with or without a NIC
• 
A PCI or PCIe NIC
• 
Access to the proper driver software (either built-in Windows drivers or a separate disc)
• 
A copy of the Windows installation media (may be needed, depending on the system)
• 
A Phillips-head screwdriver
• 
An anti-static wrist strap
Getting Down to Business
Break out your trusty screwdriver and anti-static wrist strap. It’s time to install a NIC! The process for 
physically installing a NIC is functionally identical to the process you’ve used to install expansion cards 
in the past, but the software side of things has a few differences that you should pay attention to. 
✔ Hint
You can omit Steps 1–3 if the system is already equipped with a network interface card, as most 
systems are today. The steps are included here for completeness. You will be asked to install a 
second NIC in Lab Exercise 25.04, “Conﬁguring Windows Internet Connection Sharing,” so if you 
have that second NIC handy, go ahead and install it now.

Lab Exercise 25.02: Installing and Conﬁ guring an Internet Connection
489
Step 1  Make sure the PC is off and unplugged. While following proper ESD avoidance procedures, 
remove the cover of the PC. Choose any free PCI or PCIe slot to install the NIC. Remove the back plate if 
one exists.
Step 2  Plug the NIC into the PCI or PCIe slot (see Figure 25-2). Physically inserting the NIC into the 
PC is the easiest part of the task. Take care to avoid touching the pins or any of the chips on the NIC. 
Once the card is inserted, secure it by putting the proper screw through the metal tab of the card and 
screwing it to the case. Put the cover back on and restart your computer.
Step 3  Now that you have physically installed the NIC, which step you take next depends on your 
OS. When you restart a Windows 2000 system, the operating system will recognize that you’ve added 
new hardware and launch the Found New Hardware Wizard. Windows XP and higher go one step 
better—when you install a PnP device, the drivers are most likely already part of the operating system, 
so they’ll be installed automatically. This all occurs with no user intervention. The operating system 
reports success installing the new device with a small balloon from the system tray.
✔ Hint
Every Windows operating system has a good selection of network interface drivers built in at 
the time of release, but your driver may not be one of them. For example, if the NIC you’re 
installing was manufactured after the release of software you’re using, the drivers may not be 
part of the operating system and will need to be manually installed or updated.
Figure 25-2 Inserting a PCI NIC

Chapter 25: The Internet
490
The following is the Found New Hardware Wizard (Windows 2000) driver installation process:
a. 
As Windows boots, it displays the Found New Hardware Wizard screen (see Figure 25-3). 
Alternatively, if you’re using Windows XP, you can go to Control Panel | Add Hardware to start 
a similar process.
b. 
Click Next to continue. If you are using the Add/Remove Hardware Wizard instead of the 
Found New Hardware Wizard, there is simply the extra step of having Windows ﬁnd the 
hardware you installed either automatically or from a list. Then select the option that directs 
Windows to search for a suitable driver for the new device (see Figure 25-4). If the driver is on 
a ﬂoppy disk or optical disc, select that as the search location, insert the media for the driver 
before continuing, and then click Next.
✔ Hint
A popular trick is to copy the drivers from the optical disc onto the PC’s hard drive and then 
install them from there. That way, if you ever need the drivers again, you won’t need to 
rummage around for the driver disc. You need to know exactly where you store the drivers, 
though, because you’ll be asked to locate them during the installation process. You could create 
a Drivers folder at the root of the C: drive to serve as a central repository for drivers. Remember, 
drivers are constantly being updated by manufacturers. Check the manufacturer’s Web site 
before using the driver disc.
Figure 25-3 Using the Found New Hardware Wizard

Lab Exercise 25.02: Installing and Conﬁ guring an Internet Connection
491
c. 
The wizard will search through the drivers built into Windows and then the location you 
speciﬁed for the ﬁle(s). It should then report that it found the appropriate driver. Click Next. 
If prompted, you may also need to insert your Windows installation disc. When the wizard is 
ﬁnished, it’ll prompt you a ﬁnal time. Click the Finish button, and reboot your system. The 
new NIC and drivers are now properly installed.
If Windows doesn’t detect the driver right away, you’ll need to do a little extra work. Network 
interface manufacturers bundle drivers for multiple operating systems on the driver disc, so you often 
need to navigate to the appropriate folder for your operating system before Windows will ﬁnd the 
driver. In other words, look for a Win2k folder when installing modem drivers on a Windows 2000 
machine. Other manufacturers package the driver into an installation routine. Check the disc for a 
SETUP.EXE ﬁle, and run it if you ﬁnd it.
Step 4  Now that the drivers are installed, you should conﬁrm the NIC properties and verify what 
drivers are installed.
a. 
Open the Control Panel. In Windows 2000, open Network and Dial-up Connections. In Windows 
XP, open Network Connections. In Windows Vista, open the Network and Sharing Center, and 
then click Manage network connections.
b. 
Right-click Local Area Connection (note: if this is the second network interface, choose Local 
Area Connection 2) and click Properties. In the Local Area Connection Properties dialog box, 
click the Conﬁgure button next to the network interface adapter.
c. 
In the network interface adapter Properties dialog box, click the Driver tab (see Figure 25-5).
Figure 25-4 Completing installation by locating a suitable 
device driver

Chapter 25: The Internet
492
Record all the information provided about the driver you installed. 
Step 5  Now examine the physical device that has been provided by your ISP to connect the computer 
to the Internet. If the device is a DSL transceiver, it will typically have an RJ-45 Ethernet connection 
to connect to the NIC of the computer, an RJ-11 connector to connect to the telephone wall jack, and 
some sort of power adapter. If the device is a cable modem, it will typically have an RJ-45 Ethernet 
connection to connect to the NIC of the computer, an F-connector to attach to the cable, and some 
sort of power adapter (refer to Figure 25-1). Both interfaces may provide a USB connection, but for the 
purposes of the lab exercise, this will not be used.
✔ Hint
If you are in a classroom lab environment, you may not have access to the actual DSL transceiver 
or cable modem. Follow the instructor’s directions to connect the computer to the Internet. You 
should conduct an Internet search or make a trip to the local technology store to explore the 
speciﬁcations of common DSL and cable interfaces. For the most part, going through the full 
conﬁguration of the actual connection is beyond the scope of this book, but you should at least 
know where to go to follow instructions from your ISP; that’s the purpose of these last steps.
Figure 25-5 Network interface adapter driver 
properties

Lab Exercise 25.03: Enabling Windows Firewall
493
Connect the interface device by following the instructions provided with the device or by your ISP. The 
layout and conﬁguration of the device may differ somewhat from device to device, but you should be able 
to conﬁrm that the device is working properly by observing the various indicator lights on the device.
Step 6  To ﬁnish this installation and gain high-speed access to the Internet, you will most likely have 
to follow speciﬁc directions from your ISP to conﬁgure Windows to communicate through the DSL or 
cable device. Windows also provides a generic wizard to conﬁgure this communication. The following 
list walks you through this generic conﬁguration by operating system:
• 
Windows 2000 Go to Start | Programs | Accessories | Communications | Internet Connection 
Wizard. Select the option to set up your Internet connection manually or through a LAN. Click 
Next. Choose I connect through a local area network (LAN) and click Next. Select the recommended 
automatic settings. Click Next and select no when asked if you want to set up a mail account. 
Click Next, then Finish.
• 
Windows XP Open Network Connections and select Create a new connection. Click Next. Choose 
the Connect to the Internet option and click Next. Select the option to set up your connection 
manually and click Next. Pick the appropriate option on the next screen, most likely Connect 
using a broadband connection that is always on. Click Next, then Finish.
• 
Windows Vista Open Control Panel. Open the Network and Sharing Center and select Set up 
a connection or network. Select Connect to the Internet and click Next. Choose Broadband as your 
connection. Type in the relevant information and click Connect. Windows will then attempt to 
set up your Internet connection. When it is ﬁnished, click Close.
If you have followed these steps (and actually have installed a DSL or cable interface), you should 
now have high-speed access to the Internet.

Lab Exercise 25.03: Enabling Windows Firewall
Your client is very pleased with how the rollout of the ofﬁce’s Internet connection upgrade is 
progressing. They have been surﬁng around a little, and are impressed with the speed at which the 
Web sites are loading. You explain that you must now conﬁgure a ﬁrewall to protect them from outside 
intrusion through the high-speed connection. Windows XP (Service Pack 2) and Windows Vista offer 
very competent built-in ﬁrewalls. In this lab you will enable Windows Firewall and explore some of the 
services (ports) that you can allow or block.
Learning Objectives
Completing the following steps, you will explore Windows Firewall and associated TCP and UDP service ports.

Chapter 25: The Internet
494
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Enable Windows Firewall
• 
Identify various protocols and associated service ports
✔ Cross-Reference
To further explore Windows Firewall, refer to “Firewalls” in Chapter 26 of Mike Meyers’ CompTIA 
A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer running Windows XP or Windows Vista
• 
Optional: A machine connected to the Internet
Getting Down to Business
Enabling the ﬁrewall is as simple as a few clicks of the mouse and verifying that you can communicate 
with the trusted sites that you prefer. Windows Firewall is practically self-conﬁguring, but if you want 
to allow access to Web servers or e-mail servers in your organization, you will have to open some TCP 
ports. The CompTIA A+ certiﬁcation exams will expect you to know some of these “well-known ports,” so 
you’ll explore them in Windows Firewall.
✔ Hint
If you are conﬁguring a single machine for Internet access, you will want to implement 
Windows Firewall on that machine to protect it from malicious intrusion. However, if you 
are conﬁguring machines as part of a LAN and using a proxy server or Internet Connection 
Sharing (as you will in the next lab exercise), you will only want to conﬁgure a ﬁrewall on the 
machine that connects directly to the Internet. Assume the computer in this lab is the machine 
connected to the Internet.
Step 1  In Windows XP, return to Network Connections. Right-click the Local Area Connections icon of 
the external connection (the one connected to the Internet) and select Properties. Click the Advanced 
tab, and then click the Settings button in the Windows Firewall box. This opens the Windows Firewall 
dialog box (see Figure 25-6).
In Windows Vista, open the Control Panel and double-click Windows Firewall. Select Change settings.

Lab Exercise 25.03: Enabling Windows Firewall
495
Step 2  Select On (recommended) to protect the PC from unwanted access through the Internet 
connection.
Step 3  In Windows XP, select the Advanced tab of the Windows Firewall dialog box and click the 
Settings button for the Network Connection Settings (see Figure 25-7).
➜ Note
The following advanced options have been removed from the Windows Firewall Settings in 
Windows Vista in an attempt to make the OS more secure; thus, the following steps will only 
work in Windows XP. There are still methods for setting up exceptions (see the Exceptions tab 
in Windows Firewall dialog box, speciﬁcally the Add Port button) but most of the advanced 
features have been moved to the Administrative Tools.
 Step 4  This opens the Advanced Settings dialog box, where you can allow various services to pass 
through the Internet connection and access dedicated servers on your internal network. For instance, 
if you have an FTP server that you have technicians update from the ﬁeld, you will want to enable 
external communication by allowing TCP service port 21 to pass through the ﬁrewall (see Figure 25-8).

Using the Edit button, identify the service ports for the following protocols (I have completed the 
ﬁrst one for you, see Figure 25-9):
 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP Server) __________________________________________
 
Internet Mail Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4) _______________________________
 
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) _______________________________________
 
Post Ofﬁce Protocol version 3 (POP3) ________________________________________

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) _________________________________________
Step 5  To complete this lab, check with your instructor to obtain the proper conﬁguration of the 
ﬁrewall to allow the completion of further labs. You will probably disable the Windows Firewall for 
normal classroom use.

Lab Exercise 25.04: Conﬁguring Windows Internet 
Connection Sharing
Now that the main PC is secure from external threats and attacks, it’s time to conﬁgure this machine so 
that all of the PCs can take advantage of the secure Internet connection. Welcome Internet Connection 
Sharing (ICS)! With ICS, you will be able to set up a small LAN that allows all the client machines to 
access the Internet through the ICS host computer (this PC).
TCP Port 21

Chapter 25: The Internet
498
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will implement the steps to use ICS. It will take some extra hardware to actually test the 
conﬁguration, but you can still learn the basic concepts through the conﬁguration exercise.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Conﬁgure Internet Connection Sharing
✔ Cross-Reference
To further explore ICS, refer to “Windows Internet Connection Sharing” in Chapter 25 of Mike 
Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer running Windows
• 
An additional network interface card for the ICS host computer
• 
A network hub or switch
• 
A second computer running Windows to be conﬁgured as the client
• 
Optional: A machine connected to the Internet
Getting Down to Business
ICS allows a small workgroup of computers to connect to the Internet through one of the workgroup 
computers acting as an ICS host computer. There are a few items that need to be conﬁgured on both 
the ICS host computer and the clients. The host will have two communication devices installed (in this 
case, two NICs). The network will need a hub or a switch to allow multiple computers to communicate. 
Finally, the client machines will have to be conﬁgured to obtain their TCP/IP settings automatically.
➜ Note
It may seem convoluted to connect an Ethernet cable coming from your Internet source to your 
computer just so you can connect another Ethernet cable to a hub or switch—why not just connect 
the hub to the Internet source? But ICS is perhaps at its most beneﬁcial when dealing with dial-up 
connections. In that case, you’d use a single NIC and a modem. Since most dial-up modems don’t 
offer an Ethernet output, the only way to share the Internet connection would be with ICS!

Lab Exercise 25.04: Conﬁ guring Windows Internet Connection Sharing
499
Step 1  To use ICS, you will need two communication devices installed in the computer: either a modem 
connected to the Internet and a NIC connected to the internal network, or a NIC connected to a broadband 
interface and a NIC connected to the internal network. (If you need to install a second NIC to facilitate this 
lab exercise, perform Lab Exercise 25.02, Steps 1–3.) 
Step 2  In Windows 2000, open the Local Area Connection Properties dialog box for the network device 
connected to the Internet, as you did in previous lab exercises. Click the Sharing tab. Check the Enable 
Internet Connection Sharing for this connection checkbox. Click OK.
In Windows XP and Windows Vista, open the Local Area Connection Properties dialog box for the 
network device connected to the Internet, as you did in previous lab exercises. Click the Advanced tab 
(see Figure 25-10). Under Internet Connection Sharing, check the Allow other network users to connect through 
this computer’s Internet connection checkbox. Click OK. 
Step 3  Once you’ve clicked OK, a hand icon (representing sharing) should appear under the Local Area 
Connection that has just been conﬁgured with ICS (see Figure 25-11).
Step 4  Test the ICS feature by following these steps:
a. 
Verify that the ICS host computer is capable of communicating with the Internet. Connect the 
external Local Area Connection NIC to the broadband interface (DSL or cable).
b. 
Power up the hub or switch, and connect the internal interface from the ICS host computer to 
the hub.

Lab Exercise 25.05: Upgrading and Tweaking  
Internet Explorer
Now that you have improved and protected your client’s Internet connectivity, you will want to make 
sure that the method they use to interact with the Internet is the most current. Microsoft Internet 
Explorer (IE) and Mozilla Firefox are currently the two most popular browsers. The following steps will 
help you upgrade your client to the latest version of IE (version 8 as of this writing) and introduce you 
to some of the conﬁguration areas that you should be aware of.
Learning Objectives
When it comes to applications—and this includes Internet Explorer—the computer technician is looked 
to as the Master or Mistress of All Things Computer. For this reason, a knowledge and awareness of 
applications, in addition to learning and practicing your craft as an IT technician, will enhance your 
reputation as an expert. In this lab, you’ll brieﬂy explore the upkeep of a networking application.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Evaluate and upgrade the IE application
• 
Fine-tune IE settings
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A working computer running Windows XP (at least SP2) or Windows Vista
• 
Internet access, preferably high-speed to facilitate downloads
Getting Down to Business
Internet Explorer is currently the most popular browser application. You and your client may launch an 
Internet search engine such as Google or Yahoo! to locate and visit manufacturers’ Web sites, to research 
and, in some cases, purchase new hardware and software. You’ll want to make sure that IE is up to date 
and working efﬁciently to make your client’s browsing more pleasant.

✖ Warning
The following lab steps have you update Internet Explorer and change some of the conﬁguration 
settings. If you are in an instructor-led class, or performing these operations on machines in 
your organization, verify you have permission to perform the upgrades.
Step 1  Open your current browser and navigate to the Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer page 
(www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/ as of this writing). Examine the new features and 
requirements (click Support, then System requirements). Does IE8 work with all versions of Windows? 
Verify that your system and OS meet the requirements, and then download Internet Explorer 8.
Step 2  When the download has ﬁnished, open Internet Explorer. Choose Tools | Internet Options.
On the General tab (see Figure 25-13), you can set the home page (or home pages), set browser history 
settings, change search defaults, and adjust tab settings. There are also options to set the appearance of 
Web pages displayed by the browser.

Step 3  Click the Advanced tab and explore the many settings that can be conﬁgured to modify how 
the browser deals with components and content. Navigate down to the Security heading and locate 
Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder when browser is closed. I like to enable this setting.
Explore some of the other tabs available in Internet Options and experiment with the different 
items you can conﬁgure. Microsoft has done a good job of setting the browser up with default settings 
that will work in most installations, but as the expert, you will want to be familiar with customizing 
the browser.

Obviously, keeping your computer secure is important. Several chapters 
have already been devoted to securing Windows and networks. But there 
are still a few more helpful tools you should know about to keep things 
running smoothly. Local Security Settings lets you set a variety of rules 
about using the system; Event Viewer shows you information about events 
you didn’t even know were happening; and Microsoft Security Essentials 
is a free tool that allows you to clean your system of, and protect your 
system against, viruses and other malicious software. Each of these tools 
increases the power you have over your own security and the security of 
your computer.

Lab Exercise 26.01: Local Policies
NTFS permissions are powerful tools to control with great detail what users and groups can do to folders 
and ﬁles. However, NTFS does not cover a number of important security issues that don’t directly 
involve the ﬁle system. For example, what if you don’t want a particular user group to shut down the 
computer? What if you want to make sure all accounts use a password of at least eight characters? What 
if you want to prevent certain users from reformatting the hard drive? These types of security settings 
are all controlled under the umbrella term of local policies.
✔ Hint
There are hundreds of different policies that you may conﬁgure for a system. This lab only 
covers a few of the most basic policies!

Local Security Settings is a very powerful applet that allows you to adjust all sorts of settings and details 
about your system. Simply put, it is a series of rules you deﬁne, ranging from how many attempts to log 
on a user is allowed, to who can change the time on the clock!
Step 1  Log on using an account with administrator rights. From Control Panel, open Administrative 
Tools. Double-click Local Security Policy. When opened, it should look something like Figure 26-1.
Double-click the Account Policies icon to expand its contents: Password Policy and Account Lockout 
Policy. Click Password Policy in the left column, right-click Password must meet complexity requirements, and 
select Properties. Enable this policy, as shown in Figure 26-2, and click OK.
Create a normal user account and call it Janet. Try making a simple password like janet and see 
what happens. Keep trying to make a password until you get one that is accepted. What do you need to 
do to make an acceptable password? 
✔ Hint
Use the help in the User Accounts Control Panel applet to get some ideas as to what you need to do.
Figure 26-1 Local Security Settings

Chapter 26: Securing Computers
508
➜ Note
In Windows 2000, right-clicking a policy will give you a context menu with a Security option 
instead of a Properties option. These are the same tools.
Step 2  Head back to the Password Policy in Local Security Settings and enable Enforce Password 
History. Open the User Accounts applet from the Control Panel and try to change a password to the 
same password you already have. What happens?
Step 3  In Local Security Settings, click Account Lockout Policy under Account Policies in the left 
column. An account lockout is when the operating system no longer allows a certain account the right 
even to try to log on. Try to change the properties on the Account lockout duration setting—it is disabled 
until you set the Account lockout threshold to something other than the default of 0. Try changing the 
Account lockout threshold to 3 attempts. Note that Windows now automatically sets the Account lockout 
duration and the Reset account lockout counter after settings to 30 minutes.
Log off the computer. Use the Janet account and intentionally attempt to log on using incorrect 
passwords. What happens after the third try?

Lab Exercise 26.02: Event Viewer
With all the pop-ups, dialog boxes, and little message bubbles that Windows throws at you all day long, 
you would think it’s telling you everything that happens every minute of every day—Windows Vista, 
doubly so. But it isn’t. Of course, there are many processes that go on in the background, but even 
when Windows alerts you of an event, there may be more to the story. Perhaps an application crashes 
unexpectedly and Windows provides little or no feedback. It’s possible that one tool in Administrative 
Tools took notice and can help—Event Viewer.
Learning Objectives
In this lab, you’ll practice using Event Viewer.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Work with Event Viewer to track events on your system
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you will need for this lab are
• 
A PC with Windows
Getting Down to Business
Think about your actions on a computer as a series of events: you log on, you open an application, 
you close it, you log off, and so forth. This is how Event Viewer sees things, but in a lot more detail. If 
something goes wrong, Event Viewer usually records it. It also records a lot of things that are perfectly 
normal—the trick is being able to sort through all the information, which Windows makes fairly simple.
Step 1  Access Event Viewer by going to Control Panel and opening Administrative Tools. Double-click 
Event Viewer to open it (see Figure 26-3).
Step 2  Windows Vista adds the extra step of expanding the Windows Logs folder in the left column, but 
otherwise Event Viewer is exactly the same in each version of Windows. Four or ﬁve logs should be listed. 
The important one for now is Application; the events in this log all concern the operation of applications 
on your system. Click it in the left column and a long list of events should appear on the right.
Step 3  Scroll through the list and look at the different levels used by Windows to describe events 
(in the Type column, which is usually the leftmost column). Click the Type column label at the top of 
the list to sort the events by level. You should see a lot of events labeled Information. These are your 
everyday events—any successful operation, such as proper use of a driver, is marked as Information.

Chapter 26: Securing Computers
510
Step 4  There might also be a few events labeled Warning or Error. Warnings do not indicate that 
something bad is happening but rather that something bad will happen. An example of a Warning event 
is when Windows is low on resources, such as disk space. Errors are more serious. These events occur 
when there is a failure or loss of functionality, such as when an application crashes.
Go through the list and see if you can ﬁnd any Warnings or Errors. Double-click one and look at 
the Event Properties dialog box that pops up for more information on what happened. A lot of Event 
Viewer’s reports can be very cryptic, which is why Windows Vista now has a handy Event Log Online 
Help link built into Event Viewer. Clicking the link opens a dialog box asking for permission to send 
information about the event over the Internet. Your browser will open and take you to the Microsoft 
TechNet database. There isn’t information available on every single event, but it can be very useful in 
tracking down problems.
If you don’t have Windows Vista, you can always record the Event ID number that is listed with the 
event and search for it on the Internet. For example, if it is Event ID 1002, simply search for “Event Viewer 
ID 1002” and see what comes up. You’re likely to ﬁnd out at least a little more than you knew before.
Step 5  Try searching through the other logs—you can’t really hurt anything from Event Viewer, 
because whatever is included there already happened! Search through the Security and System logs to 
see what sorts of events they record.

Lab Exercise 26.03: Cleaning and Protecting  
a Client’s Computer
Geek Squad, the popular PC repair arm of Best Buy, reports that over 75 percent of their service calls 
involve cleaning malware off of a computer and then showing customers how to protect their PCs from 
malware and other attacks.
Windows comes with many programs and features to protect your computer, but these tools are useless 
if they are not used properly. In this lab exercise, you will check the computer for malware, clean the 
malware from the computer, and then go through the steps to reduce the likelihood of another attack.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Remove malware from a Windows system
• 
Conﬁgure Internet security software (antivirus/antimalware)
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A Windows XP (SP2 or later) or Windows Vista PC
• 
Microsoft Security Essentials (or another Internet security suite)
✔ Hint
This is a great lab for students who want to bring a PC from home—or one that belongs to a 
friend—for testing and cleaning.
Getting Down to Business
A new system brings with it new problems. You’ve set up user accounts with passwords and activated 
ﬁrewalls, but there is still one more important piece of protection required. Antivirus and antimalware 
software can actively and passively protect you from unwanted malicious activity. Actively, you can 
usually scan entire computers for any issues. Passively, many tools are available that will constantly 
monitor your PC as you use it and watch out for viruses and other problems you may encounter on the 
Internet.

Chapter 26: Securing Computers
512
This lab will walk you through setting up Microsoft Security Essentials software, compatible with 
Windows XP (SP2 or later) and Windows Vista, available at www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/. 
There are, of course, other software solutions available, some of them free, but Microsoft’s tool is fairly 
complete and multifunctional (and, yes, free).
Step 1  The ﬁrst step is to download the software (if you haven’t already done so). When you open the 
executable, it will extract itself and begin the installation. Follow the instructions. Then it will run 
itself, update itself, and scan itself—it’s all quite impressive to watch (see Figure 26-4).
Step 2  Microsoft Security Essentials will ﬁnish the scan and report its ﬁndings. It will give you the 
option to clean your computer or perform another action, but the defaults are usually correct. The ﬁle 
should then be quarantined or destroyed, and Microsoft Security Essentials will alert you when it has 
ﬁnished.
Step 3  Now that you’ve completed your initial scan, there are other options available to you. You can 
pick between running a Quick scan or a Full scan. A Full scan performs the same actions as the Quick scan, 
but also goes through the Registry. You can also set up a Custom scan to scan only certain directories.

513
The Update tab allows you to update virus and spyware deﬁnitions, although Microsoft Security 
Essentials also does this automatically. The History tab keeps track of all the potentially harmful items 
the software ﬁnds and what actions it performed. The Settings tab allows you to set up the program as 
you wish, including scheduling regular scans, setting what ﬁles and locations to exclude from scans, 
and adding removable drives to the scan (see Figure 26-5).
To add removable drives to the scan, under the Settings tab, click Advanced in the left column. 
Check the box for Scan removable drives. Microsoft Security Essentials will now scan the contents of each 
removable drive, such as USB thumb drives.

516
At this point you’re well on your path to becoming a CompTIA A+ 
certiﬁed technician. You have an excellent understanding of the major 
technical aspects of computer systems: hardware, software, networking, 
and the Internet.
When a client launches an application, that person isn’t thinking 
about what happens behind the scenes: “Hey, look at me! I’m using the 
keyboard and mouse to input data! The processor is calculating all of the 
information to produce the desired results and present the output on the 
screen or in hard copy form on a printer. This is only possible because 
the operating system, applications, and data were successfully stored 
on the hard drive.” You, as the tech, do have to think about all of this, 
but you also need the user’s perspective. When you look at the computer 
system as a whole—that is, as a practical tool that can create and process 
everything from your résumé to the latest Hollywood thriller—you’ll 
have a better understanding of how your clients envision the computer.
A PC tech in the real world also has to work with people: customers, 
clients, supervisors, coworkers, family members, maybe even spouses. 
You have to develop the skills for calmly gathering information about the 
state the computer is in and how it arrived there. Usually, your clients 
won’t use the most technical language to explain the situation, and they 
may be frustrated or even a little on the defensive, so you need to be 
understanding and patient. You want them to see you as an ally, and to 
ensure that they do, you’ll need to treat them with respect and kindness.
Bear in mind that someone who doesn’t understand computers can 
still be quite intelligent and capable in other areas; talking down to a 
client is a bad idea! The client also trusts in your integrity to solve the 
problem in the most efﬁcient and cost-effective manner possible, and to 
return their machine and data uncompromised.

517
Finally, and most importantly, you should cultivate a good troubleshooting 
methodology. It’s difﬁcult to give you a speciﬁc checklist, but the following 
guidelines should help:
• Identify the problem.
• Question the user and identify user changes to the computer 
and perform backups before making changes.
• Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious).
• Test the theory to determine the cause.
• Once the theory is conﬁrmed, determine the next steps to 
resolve the problem.
• If the theory is not conﬁrmed, re-establish a new theory or 
escalate the problem.
• Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement 
the solution.
• Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement 
preventative measures.
• Document ﬁndings, actions, and outcomes.
➜ Note
You should be familiar with the six steps of the troubleshooting theory for both real-world 
application and the CompTIA A+ exams.
Don’t forget that often the client will be there with you, hanging on your every word. Explain the 
steps you are taking to conﬁgure a new system, or to repair damage and recover data from hardware 
failure or malicious software. When backing up data prior to working on a system, err on the side of 
caution; make your best effort to determine which data is vital to your client and to their business, even if 
they are vague about what data needs to be protected. Try to give them realistic expectations of what you 
likely can or cannot do, so that the outcome is a pleasant surprise rather than a bitter disappointment.

✔ Hint
Ideally, for the lab exercises in this chapter, you should have a partner play the role of the 
client while you play the role of the PC tech. Work through the scenarios in a live, person-to-
person role-playing of each situation, just as if it were real. If you are working in a classroom 
setting, try to work with different classmates through each of the different scenarios, and try 
to spend time playing the client as well as the tech.

Lab Exercise 27.01: Scenario #1: Computer 
Obsolescence and Expense of Replacement
An independent salesperson for a multiline musical instrument dealer walks into your shop carrying a 
weathered laptop case. He lays the case on the counter and asks simply, “Is there anything you can do?” You 
open the case to ﬁnd a late-1990s model IBM ThinkPad. You open the lid on the ThinkPad and see a semicircle 
indentation and spider-web cracks all across the screen. The LCD panel has been completely smashed!
As the expert in this situation, you have to make some decisions about what would ultimately be the 
most timely and cost-effective solution. You then have to explain your recommendations to the client 
carefully and respectfully, as either solution will most likely be costly and therefore stressful for him.
✔ Cross-Reference
Before you work through the role-playing scenarios, go back and re-read Chapter 27 in Mike Meyers’ 
CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs.
Learning Objectives
This exercise will test your ability to stay cool in the face of a concerned client, even as you may have to 
deliver news that the client doesn’t want to hear.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Assess the damage and back up the client’s data
• 
Convey the options available to the client
• 
Provide a recommended solution to the client
Lab Materials and Setup
The materials you need for this lab are
• 
A partner or classmate to play the role of the client (if you don’t have a partner, you can still 
work through the scenario and complete the Lab Analysis Test at the end of the chapter)

• 
A notepad or computer-generated “trouble ticket” to simulate the practice followed in many 
computer support organizations
• 
Optional: A demo machine and/or Internet access, to re-create the scenario and research 
options on vendor Web sites and tech forums
Getting Down to Business
To begin, have your partner read the Client section that follows. You will then read the PC Tech section 
and use the speciﬁcs to analyze the situation and recommend the best course of action. Sit down and 
work through the scenario with your partner. If possible, use the Internet or demo machines to make 
the scenario role-playing more valid.
CLIENT:
You are an independent salesperson for a multiline musical instrument dealer and spend about  
20 days a month on the road. You use the laptop to keep all of your customer data and product information 
up to date. You were ﬁnishing up a particularly busy week when you fell asleep with the laptop on your 
lap. You placed the laptop next to your bed in the hotel only to step on it in the middle of the evening. 
Your entire business relies on the information contained in the computer, and having it down, even for 
a short time, is going to create problems.
Along with the time-critical issues, you are also an independent salesperson and self-employed—
you pay your own travel and lodging expenses, health beneﬁts, and life insurance. A costly repair or 
replacement was not in your planned budget. You do know that working with a dial-up connection to 
the Internet in hotels and using ﬂoppies to transfer ﬁles between your laptop and your home machine 
(when you’re there) is becoming cumbersome.
PC TECH:
As the technician, you are going to analyze the laptop and quickly recommend that the hard drive 
be backed up immediately. Using a laptop IDE harness and duplicating the hard drive to a volume on the 
shop data server, you can alleviate the customer’s concern that all his data will be lost.
You know that the machine is over six years old, and that the replacement screen and labor to 
install it are probably going to cost a fair amount. You use the Internet to research replacement LCD 
screens and try to estimate the overall cost of the repair. Not only is it expensive, the availability of the 
screen is backlogged over three weeks. It is also a good bet that other components in the machine will 
begin to age and fail even if the screen repair is warranted. The laptop does not have wireless access, 
there is no USB, and the CD-ROM drive is just that, a CD-ROM drive!
Your job is laid out before you. You need to discuss the options of repairing the current machine, 
warts and all, or having the client upgrade to a more modern laptop.

Lab Exercise 27.02: Scenario #2: Hardware Failure,  
or I Can’t See Anything!
One of the marketing analysts in your company calls the help desk and complains that he’s unable to 
get his monitor to work. He arrived this morning and the computer just never booted. There’s a mission-
critical presentation on this system that is due to be presented today at 2:00 P.M. It’s now 1:00 P.M. and 
nobody has returned his call, even to say that his initial request was received! The analyst storms into 
the IT department and demands some assistance. You look up from your screen just in time to see your 
supervisor and the analyst barreling toward your cubicle. Your supervisor asks if you will accompany 
the analyst to his department and see if you can ﬁgure this out.
In cases such as this, the tech’s job is not only to troubleshoot the problem and provide a solution, 
but also to provide customer service and present a good image of the IT department to other employees. 
As the expert in this situation, you not only have to solve the issue—you must also make your best 
effort to diffuse the agitation of the anxious analyst.
Learning Objectives
The plan is to have a classmate play the role of the client, and you to play the role of the PC tech. 
This exercise will give you a great opportunity to display not only your tech skills, but also your 
professionalism in a tough, time-crunch situation. 
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Analyze the problem with input from the client
• 
Diffuse the frustration of the client
• 
Provide a complete solution

Getting Down to Business
To begin, have your partner read the Client section that follows. You will then read the PC Tech section 
and use the speciﬁcs to analyze the situation and recommend the best course of action. Now sit down 
and work through the scenario with your partner. If possible, use the Internet or demo machines to 
make the scenario role-playing more valid.
CLIENT:
You arrived this morning and started your normal routine: You dropped your briefcase in the corner 
of your cube, carefully placed your coffee on the ﬁle cabinet (away from the computer), and pressed 
the power button on the computer. You exchanged a few pleasantries with your fellow workers and sat 
down to work on the ﬁnishing touches for the presentation you will be delivering at 2:00 P.M. today, 
only to ﬁnd a completely blank screen. You attempted to reboot the computer, and veriﬁed that the 
power light was lit on the monitor (you do know that much about computers). But it was still a no-go!
You placed a call with the help desk and tried not to panic. Some friends invited you to lunch, and 
you joined them with the hope that the IT department would visit while you were gone so that you 
could return to a working machine. When you returned, nothing had been done!
You are a little tense, but you know that you are at the mercy of the IT group. You head down to 
the IT department and visit directly with the support supervisor. He introduces you to one of the techs, 
who is now traveling to your desk with you. The only thing you can remember doing differently was 
authorizing an Automatic Windows Update last night as you were leaving.
PC TECH:
Well, you’ve certainly been here before—a critical situation with severe time constraints, but now 
it’s 1:20 P.M. and the analyst is very tense. You arrive at the analyst’s desk and have him run through the 
routine that he followed when he arrived this morning. You ask if anything has changed since yesterday 
when the machine worked. You then run a check of the obvious diagnoses and troubleshooting steps.
✔ Hint
It is imperative that you keep detailed records of the diagnosing and troubleshooting steps. If 
you have set items that you check ﬁrst (remember: simple to complex), then you will perform a 
quick check of the power lights, power cord connections, monitor connections, and whether the 
monitor settings menu is accessible, enabling you to rule out simple items that may have been 
overlooked in a time of stress.

Chapter 27: The Complete PC Technician
522
If none of the simple solutions appear to work, you have two issues on your hands. One is that you 
need to get the system back up and running, and the other is that your client has a big presentation due 
in 30 minutes (yes, it took 10 minutes to check the simple items, so it’s now 1:30 P.M.). You know that 
your organization has all of the employees save their documents to Documents, which is mapped to the 
server to facilitate backups. You have the analyst log on to a coworker’s machine, access his Documents 
folder, and ﬁne-tune his presentation with 10 minutes to spare.
You send a calmer analyst to the meeting, complete the analysis of the system, and perform the 
required repairs. Record the additional steps you would take to complete this trouble ticket. How would 
you communicate your ﬁndings with the analyst? Share the results with your instructor.

Lab Exercise 27.03: Scenario #3:  
What Do You Mean, a Virus?
You’re just ﬁnishing up lunch when one of your neighbors walks into your shop with her family computer 
under her arm. She knows you from the neighborhood, and has heard that you know a fair amount about 
computer systems (I hope so, since you are working in a computer shop!). She asks if you can take a look at 
her system.
You ask what seems to be the problem, to which she responds, “It seems to be running really slow. 
We can’t ﬁnd some of the documents and pictures we used to have, and every time we try to access the 
Internet, it kicks us off!”
You recommend that she return to whatever she was doing and leave the machine with you; it just 
so happens that your schedule is open this afternoon, so you should be able to take a quick look at the 
system. You ask if there are any passwords you’ll need, and the client responds, “No, we don’t worry 
about passwords.” You ﬁll out a trouble ticket with the contact information and let her know you’ll be 
in touch with her shortly.
Learning Objectives
Viruses are a simple fact of life in today’s computing landscape, and any tech should be able to both 
remediate existing virus infections as well as take preventative measures against future infections. It’s 
sometimes tempting to treat customers as though their virus infection serves them right, but you have 
to maintain your professional demeanor in these situations, as you’ll come across a lot of them.
At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Analyze the machine to determine if it exhibits the symptoms the customer has indicated
• 
Perform routine maintenance and optimization
• 
Make recommendations to the client for the upkeep of her machine

and work through the scenario with your partner. If possible, use the Internet or demo machines to 
make the scenario role-playing more valid.
CLIENT:
The computer you are dropping off to the shop is the family computer and is used by all the family 
members—two teenagers, you, and your spouse. The machine is constantly online, using a high-speed 
cable Internet connection, and there are tons of music ﬁles, pictures, and games stored on the hard drive.
You are not completely computer savvy, so if asked by the tech, you respond that you do not know 
if there is any antispyware or antivirus software installed, although it’s possible that the kids have 
installed something. All you know is that the machine is running slowly, you have lost some documents 
and pictures that you wanted, and the machine will no longer connect to the Internet.
When you drop the machine off at the repair shop, the tech attempts to send you on your way, but 
you would like to see what he is doing and possibly learn how to make the system run better. You are 
fairly insistent, and ﬁnally work out that the tech will walk you through everything when you return.
PC TECH:
You set the system up on your test bench and boot into Windows XP. The system does take an 
inappropriate amount of time to boot and load all of the programs (you notice there are a large number 
of items in the system tray, but it is surprisingly devoid of an antivirus icon). You take a quick note of 
the version of XP and notice that no service packs are installed, so it’s a good bet that Windows Updates 
has not been running either.
You check Device Manager and Event Viewer to verify that there are no speciﬁc hardware issues; 
everything seems to check out there. You then run Disk Cleanup—which uncovers over 4 GB of 
temporary Internet ﬁles—and then Defrag, which indicates that the disk is fragmented. It is a 40-GB 
hard drive that is almost ﬁlled to capacity, so Defrag is probably not going to run. Finally, you double-
check whether any antivirus/antiadware/antispyware programs are installed, and ﬁnd nothing.

on how to clean up a machine that appears to have no speciﬁc hardware problems causing 
issues, but merely an accumulation of junk ﬁles, adware, spyware, and viruses.
You contact the customer and recommend that she return to the shop to discuss your recommendations 
for the machine. You still do not know if the lost ﬁles are recoverable, but you know you’ll have to work 
through the other problems before you get there.

No E-Mail, and I Can’t Print!
You arrive at work bright and early at 7:00 A.M. to ﬁnd several voice mail messages blinking on your 
phone. You are one of the desktop support specialists at a large ﬁnancial institution, and you usually 
make a point of arriving early to catch up on some of the studying you have been doing to pass your 
next IT certiﬁcation exam. However, it looks like you will have to put this on the back burner for 
today. You check the messages, and it appears that the entire proposals department is in already, 
working on an investment proposal for a prominent client. The messages are frantic requests to ﬁx the 
computer systems in the proposals department. Apparently, none of the computers are able to access 
the documents the team has been working with all week; they could not e-mail their concerns and the 
network printer is down!
You have an idea what might be happening, but you are going to drop by the proposals department 
and check some of the individual machines before you make a rash decision. You close your textbook, 
and walk over to the proposals department.
Learning Objectives
Staying cool in high-stakes situations is the hallmark of a true tech, so look at this lab as an opportunity 
to improve your troubleshooting skills in the face of pressure. At the end of this lab, you’ll be able to
• 
Verify that this is not an isolated problem with one or two machines
• 
Diagnose and troubleshoot from simple to complex, and record your ﬁndings

CLIENT:
You are the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (CFO) for this large ﬁnancial institution. You have asked your 
entire team to come in today at 6:00 A.M. to ﬁnish up an investment proposal for a high-proﬁle client. 
Everybody was on point, but as soon as things began rolling, a number of your staff appear at your door: 
“The network is down!”
They inform you that they have left numerous messages with the IT department, but you do not 
expect anybody to be there until 8:30 A.M. or so. Just as you are preparing to call the Chief Information 
Ofﬁcer (CIO) at home, one of the desktop support specialists arrives on the scene.
You ask the desktop support specialist if they are up to the challenge of determining the cause of 
the outage and, if so, whether they have the authority to complete the tasks involved to get the network 
up and running again. The specialist seems like a sincere individual, so you ask them to perform the 
initial investigation and report to you as soon as they have a handle on the situation.
PC TECH:
This issue is going to challenge you on a professionalism level more than it will challenge you as 
a technologist. You should run through some quick checks of the various computers in the proposals 
department. Check the physical connections and log on to a few of the machines to verify that the 
network connectivity is down.
As soon as you can verify that the entire department is down, make sure you communicate with 
the CFO to apprise them of the situation. This is a case of escalation—you need to get your network 
administrators online and have them troubleshoot the network. You have checked a few machines 
in other departments to verify that there is network connectivity in the building, and it is only the 
proposals department that is down.

Chapter 27: The Complete PC Technician

You assure the CFO that you’re on the issue, and will inform them when the network admin is 
onsite. You then make a call to your friend, who just happens to be one of the network administrators; 
she is only a few minutes from the ofﬁce, and tells you to hang tight and plan on joining her in the 
switch room. You’re going to have an opportunity to work the issues through to the resolution. Don’t 
forget to update the CFO!
