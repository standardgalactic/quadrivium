Advanced Granulation Theory at 
Particle Level
The present text concerns the micro-level (particle-level) perspective on the different stages of the 
granulation process. A range of the newest and advanced quantitative models is presented hereby 
introducing recent advances in wetting and nucleation modelling, and theory describing granule growth 
behaviour. The different bonding mechanisms and the strength of liquid bonded particles are emphasised 
and recent advances in simulation of wet granule breakage is reviewed. Further, some of the more 
advanced coalescence models are introduced with primary focus on class I models accounting for 
coalescence of non-deformable as well as deformable granules.
The text is aimed at undergraduate university or engineering-school students working in the field chemical 
and biochemical engineering as well as particle technology. Newly graduated as well as experienced 
engineers may also find relevant new information as emphasis is put on the newest scientific discoveries 
and proposals presented in the last few years of scientific publications. It is the hope that the present 
text will provide a complete and up-to-date image of how far modern granulation theory has come, 
and also further provide the reader with qualitative rules of thumb that may be essential when working 
with granulation processes. The comprehensive literature list may also hopefully be an inspiration for 
further reading. 
I alone am responsible for any misprints or errors and I will be grateful to receive any critics and/or 
suggestions for further improvements.

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
1	 Fluid bed agglomeration at 
particle level
An understanding of the various processes and mechanisms in the granulation process at micro- or 
particle-level is essential in any type of modelling approach. If the particle-level mechanisms are not 
fully understood, an adequate modelling of the entire system at meso- or macro-scale does not have a 
fair chance of success. The following text focuses is on the particle-level modelling of some of the most 
important processes that may take place during wet granulation.
1.1	
Mechanisms involved in the growth rate of granules
Fluidised bed granulation is sometimes referred to as a one-pot system as the elementary steps of the 
process occur in the same chamber. Fluidisation and mixing of the solid bulk are provided by an upward 
hot air flow. Fine droplets of liquid solvent with binder material are distributed by the nozzle. As the 
droplets come into contact with solid particles, a liquid layer forms at the particle surface. When a wet 
particle collides with another particle in the fluid bed a liquid bridge appears between the two particles. 
When subsequent drying occurs, the solvent evaporates and a solid bridge arises due to the solidification 
of the binder material. The repetition of these steps causes growth of the fluidised bed particles through 
agglomeration until a point where growth is counteracted by breakage due to insufficient liquid binder 
material (Turchiuli et al., 2005 and Iveson et al., 2001a). Formally, these different steps can be divided 
into three principal mechanisms being: wetting and nucleation, agglomeration and growth by layering, 
and finally, breakage and attrition (Iveson et al., 2001a and Cameron et al., 2005). 
In respect to the modelling of the agglomeration and coating process, it is obviously the mechanisms 
associated with agglomeration that have the primary interest. Hence, the primary focus in the following 
chapter concerns advanced modelling aspects of wet granule agglomeration and theory describing the 
mechanical properties of wetted particles. The phenomena associated with wetting and nucleation were 
extensively covered in Hede (2005 & 2006b) and only some of the latest approaches will be presented in 
the present document. For more fundamental information on nucleation, Hapgood (2000) and Wauters 
(2001) should be consulted. Likewise will breakage and attrition of dry granules not be covered as these 
topics were covered extensively in Hede (2005 & 2006b) besides being reviewed lately by Reynolds 
et al., (2005).

1.2	
Wetting and nucleation
The initial step in the wet agglomeration processes is the process of bringing liquid binder into contact with 
the particles powder and attempt to distribute this liquid evenly throughout the fluidised particles. This is 
usually referred to as wetting. In batch granulation, nucleation refers to the formation of initial aggregates 
in the beginning of the granulation process and the formed nuclei provide the initial granular stage for 
further agglomeration (Cameron et al., 2005). Only in the last few years, the effects of nucleation on the 
final product properties have been recognised and within the last two years more advanced approaches 
have been introduced. Litster et al. (2001) presented the dimensionless spray flux as a measure of the 
density of droplets landing on a particle bed surface. The dimensionless spray flux1 is used as a tool to 
predict the controlling mechanism of the nucleation process. Hapgood et al. (2004) extended this work 
using a Monte Carlo2 model to predict the extent of droplet overlap in the spray zone and therefore the 
proportion of droplets that produces single nuclei. Work by Hapgood et al. (2003) and Litster (2003) 
further introduced the nucleation regime map3 being capable of predicting the controlling nucleation 
mechanism as a function of the dimensionless spray flux and the liquid droplet penetration time τd divided 
by the particle circulation time4 τc. This nucleation regime map is to some extent capable of describing 
previously reported data by Tardos et al. (1997) but the original dimensionless spray is not adequate 
enough to predict and describe any full nuclei size distribution, which nevertheless is a prerequisite if 
the nucleation regime map should have any practical importance. This is due to the fact that the original 
dimensionless spray flux does not take into account that a single nucleus formed from a single droplet 
is larger than the original droplet due to the extra volume of the solids. Therefore the fraction particle 
bed coverage of nuclei will be higher than the fraction particle bed coverage of the droplets from which 
they are made (Wildeboer et al., 2005).
Schaafsma et al. (1998 & 2000a) defined in accordance with Hapgood et al. (2004) the nucleation ratio5 J 
as the ratio of the volume (or mass) of a nucleus granule formed to the volume (or mass) of the droplet. 
However, in the case such a nucleation ratio should have any relevance for practical nucleation or 
agglomeration purposes it is the projected area of the granules that have the primary interest. In recent 
work by Wildeboer et al. (2005) they introduced another similar parameter being the nucleation area 
ratio according to:
d
n
a
a
a
K 

(1.1)
where an is the projected area of the nuclei granules and ad is the projected area of the binder droplets. 
Although not very likely the case, Wildeboer et al. (2005) assumed for simplicity that the nucleation 
area ratio is droplet-size independent and thereby constant. The probability of a single droplet forming a 
single nucleus will then relate to Kaψa rather than to ψa as in the original approach by Litster (2003) and 
Hapgood et al. (2003). As an extension of the original dimensionless spray flux expression, Wildeboer 
et al. (2005) suggested a dimensionless spray number according to:

where A is the powder flux through the spray zone, V the volumetric spray rate of spherical droplets 
produced by the nozzle and dd is the liquid droplet diameter. 
What is also of importance regarding the nucleation formation is the distribution of the liquid binder 
mass underneath the spray zone. Experiments in rotating drum granulator by Wauters et al. (2002) 
indicated that the density of liquid binder mass is highest in the center underneath the spray and 
decreases further away from the center. This means that the assumption of uniform droplet distribution 
across the width of the spray zone is problematic. In a new approach by Wildeboer et al. (2005) the spray 
zone is represented by a one-dimensional flat fan spray where the binder liquid distribution along the 
direction of particle movement (x direction) is projected onto the center line of the spray6 instead of 
being assumed uniformly distributed. With this approach, any type of nozzle with its own typical two-
dimensional binder liquid distribution can be represented. Based on the data by Wauters et al. (2002), a 
normal distribution was fitted for which it was seen that such a distribution describes the liquid binder 
distribution well. One problem in representing the spray distribution with a normal distribution is that 
there will be loss of binder mass outside the finite width of the spray zone. To account for this, Wildeboer 
et al. (2005) defined a dimensionless nuclei distribution function along the width of the spray zone (y 
direction) given by a truncated normal distribution according to:

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
Based on the developed model in equation 1.3 Wildeboer et al. (2005) performed a number of Monte 
Carlo simulations thereby simulating a real spray of liquid binder droplets and the formation of nuclei 
accounting for droplet overlap. It was observed that the effects of the liquid binder flow rate and the velocity 
of particles perpendicular to the width of the spray zone are the same, as both parameters affect only 
the density of droplets on the particle bed without changing the individual droplet properties. Changes 
in droplet diameter dd obviously changed the number and volume of the droplets but as the variation 
in dd does not change the total volume of the nuclei produced, the effect on particle size distribution 
was observed to be quite small. The parameter Ka on the other hand does change the total volume of 
the nuclei produced and hence Ka was observed to have a large effect on the particle size distribution. 
Simulations clearly indicate its importance regarding the control of the produced particle size distribution. 
Although the wetting and nucleation step may be seen as a minor part of the granulation process it is 
nevertheless a vital part of the process, and spray rate conditions and particle flux in the spray zone has 
primary importance for the entire process and the resulting granule properties. The current work by 
Wildeboer et al. (2005) and Wauters et al. (2002) makes it possible to simulate the nuclei size distribution 
based on relevant process parameters with adequate precision. The model by Wildeboer et al. (2005) may 
be used to model the spray zone where partially wetted particles are presented to the spray. This further 
makes the model somewhat suitable for replacing the traditional nucleation term in one-dimensional 
population balance models which will be introduced in chapter three. Implementation of fundamental 
knowledge of nuclei formation and wetting conditions may lead to predictions of nuclei size, porosity- 
and moisture distributions which are all vital properties in respect to the quality of the final granules. 
1.3	
Granule growth behaviour and kinetics
Granule growth occurs whenever the wetted particles in the fluid bed collides and sticks permanently 
together. For two large granules this process is traditionally referred to as coalescence or simply 
agglomeration. The sticking of fine material onto the surface of large pre-existing granules is sometimes 
referred to in old articles as layering but (e.g. Kapur & Fuerstenau, 1969) but as the distinction between 
layering and coalescence depends on the chosen cut-off size used to demarcate fines from granulates, 
agglomeration or coalescence are often the only terms used. Nowadays layering is used as a synonym for 
coating being growth due to droplet impact only (Iveson et al., 2001a).
Whether or not a collision between two granules results in permanent coalescence depends on a wide 
range of factors including the mechanical properties of the granules and the availability of liquid binder 
at or near the surfaces of the granules. Being a complex phenomenon, agglomeration has traditionally 
been treated qualitatively and quite a lot of articles exist in which the influence of different factors on 
agglomeration tendency has been treated qualitatively as it has been reviewed by Hede (2006b).

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
In the process towards a full quantitative description of the agglomeration process the agglomeration 
situation must necessarily be somewhat simplified. The majority of models treating agglomeration at 
particle level analyses the situation by viewing the granulation situation between two particles. This allows 
detailed studies of mechanical properties as well as collision studies far from the chaotic situation inside 
fluid beds. This naturally limits the applicability regarding the description of the entire agglomerating 
system in real fluid beds, but as it will be emphasised in later chapters much vital information for the 
use in macro-scale models can in fact be achieved from simplified particle-level studies. 
1.3.1	
Mechanical properties of liquid-bound granules
An agglomerate can exist in a number of different spatial structures depending on the binder liquid 
saturation. It is the amount of liquid binder as well as the humidity conditions in the bed that determines 
the degree of saturation, which again determines the spatial structure of the final granule (Jain, 2002). 
Such wet liquid bridges are obviously only temporary structures and more permanent bonding within 
the granule is created by solid bridges formed as solvent evaporates from the bridges during further 
fluidisation. Solid bridges between particles may take basically three forms: crystalline bridges, liquid 
binder bridges and solid binder bridges. If the material of the particles is soluble in the binder liquid, 
crystalline bridges may be formed when the liquid evaporates.

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
The process of evaporation reduces the proportion of liquid in the granules again producing high strength 
pendular bridges before crystals form. Alternatively, the dissolved binder takes effect upon evaporation 
of the solvent. In some cases a finely ground solid binder material may be dispersed in the binder liquid 
thereby producing a cement-like solid binding bridge upon evaporation of the solvent (Rhodes, 1998). 
In any of the three cases, the initial forming of the liquid bridge is of primary importance regarding the 
properties and spatial structure of the final agglomerate, and it is almost always the case that the solid 
bridge will have the form of the liquid bridge (Summers & Aulton, 2001). 
The particles are held together by liquid bridges at their contact points in the pendular state. This 
situation requires that the saturation is low enough to let discrete binary bridges exist between the 
solid surfaces. Such a lens-shaped ring of liquid cause adhesion due to the surface tension forces of 
the liquid/air interface and the hydrostatic suction pressure in the liquid bridge (Summers & Aulton, 
2001). The capillary structure occurs when a granule is saturated. All the voids between the particles 
are filled with binder liquid and the surface liquid of the agglomerates is drawn back from the surface 
into the interior of the agglomerate. The particles are held together in this configuration due to capillary 
suction at the liquid/air interface, which is now only at the agglomerate surface. The funicular structure 
is a transition between the pendular and the capillary state where the voids between the particles are 
not fully saturated. The droplet structure occurs when the particles are held within or at the surface 
of a liquid binder droplet (Jain, 2002 and Iveson et al., 2002). This situation almost never happens in 
fluid beds (Kunii & Levenspiel, 1991 and Litster & Ennis, 2004). A sketch of the different formal spatial 
agglomerate structures can be seen in figure 1.

saturation (Iveson et al., 2001a).

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
During granulation, it is possible for the saturation state of the agglomerates to change from e.g. the 
pendular state to the droplet state either due to the continuous addition of liquid binder or the saturation 
of the pores of each particle. The pendular structure is however the most common in fluid bed granulation 
due to the usual processed particle sizes versus the droplet sizes (Kunii & Levenspiel, 1991 and Litster & 
Ennis, 2004). Typical examples of agglomerates being bound by solidified pendular liquid bridges can 
be seen in figure 2 in which Na2SO4 cores agglomerated during coating with a Na2SO4/Dextrin solution. 
Hence, regarding the agglomeration process in fluid beds, the primary attention should be given to the 
modelling of the pendular liquid bridge.
Figure 2: Pendular bonding bridges. 
Examples of agglomerates being bound by pendular bonding bridges (Hede, 2005).
Liquid-bound granule strength is dominated by three types of forces being interparticle forces, static 
strength forces and dynamic strength forces (Iveson et al., 2001a). The first two are interrelated as the 
tensile force of the liquid bridge acts to pull particles together and this normal force at particle contacts 
activates friction. Static strength forces as surface tension and capillary forces are conservative forces in 
the sense that they always act to pull particles together in wetted systems. Frictional and viscous forces 
are dissipative as they always act against interparticle motion. The complex interaction of these different 
forces means that it is often impossible in industrial situations to predict a-priori the effect of changing 
any particular granule property, unless the precise magnitude of each of these three types of forces is 
well-known (Iveson et al., 2002). Hence the following sub sections will introduce the available theory 
regarding each of the three types of forces, primarily in respect to the most important agglomerate 
structure being the pendular liquid bridge.

Interparticle forces 
The normal force generated by liquid bridges at inter-particle contacts activates inter-particle friction 
forces. There are a whole range of different types of interparticle forces including van der Waal´s forces, 
forces due to absorbed liquid layers, electrostatic forces and friction forces (Yates, 1983). According to 
Rumpf (1962) and Rhodes (1998) the friction forces and the forces associated with the liquid/solid bridges 
(static and dynamic forces) are nevertheless the only forces of significance in wet systems with particle 
sizes above roughly 10 μm. This can be visualised from figure 3 illustrating the relative magnitude of 
the different interparticle forces as function of particle size.

Theoretical tensile strength of agglomerates with different bonding mechanisms  
(based on Rumpf, 1962 and Rhodes, 1998).
Internal friction forces inside agglomerates are often described in terms of a Columbic relationship 
according to (Nedderman, 1992):

in which σf is the macroscopic shear stress at failure, μf the coefficient of internal friction, σn the 
macroscopic normal stress and c the cohesivity being in other words the shear strength at zero normal 
load. This simple model represents the cumulative effect of several contributing mechanisms. In an 
ensemble of particles in an agglomerate, resistance to shear deformation arises from true tribological 
interaction between touching particles and particle interlocking of which the last is a macroscopic locking 
mechanism depending on size and shape of the particles constituting the agglomerate (Iveson et al., 
2002). Generally, the amount of reported work regarding internal friction forces in the presence of a 
viscous binder is very limited. Some advances has been made in the understanding of the fundamental 
nature of the tribological component of the friction force and these results indicate that the presence of a 
lubricating film binding the particles together lowers the friction at particle as well as at the macroscopic 
level (Cain et al., 2000). Iveson et al. (2002) present a short review of the latest advances in the field 
of friction forces. Important trends to note from this review are that internal friction forces inside an 
agglomerate are dissipative and not strongly strain-rate dependant at strain rates commonly experienced 
in fluid bed granulation processes (Iveson et al., 2002).

1.3.1.2	 Static strength – capillary and surface tension forces
The static strength of a pendular liquid bridge consists of two components. There is a suction pressure 
caused by the curvature of the liquid interface and a force due the interfacial surface tension acting 
around the perimeter of the bridge cross-section7. In the absence of gravitational effects8 arising from 
bridge distortion and buoyancy, the total force F acting between two spherical particles both of radius Rp 
is given by the sum of two components being the axial component of the surface tension acting on the 
three-phase contact line and the hydrostatic pressure acting on the axially projected area of the liquid 
contact on either particle. This leads to the following expression commonly known as the boundary 
method (Lian et al., 1993):

in which φ is the half-filling angle, θ the contact angle and γlv the liquid surface tension. The situation

ΔP is the pressure difference across the curvature of the air-liquid interface9 and assuming that the liquid 
surface has constant mean curvature, ΔP is given by the Laplace-Young equation (Goodwin, 2004 and

in which r1 is and r2 are local principal radii of normal curvature in orthogonal directions at points along 
the meridional bridge profile as shown in figure 4 (Iveson et al., 2001a). Conventionally, r2 is evaluated 
in a direction orthogonal to the meridional profile such that its center of curvature is located along the 
surface normal on the bridge axis of symmetry. Hence, the center of curvature of r2 is always within 
the bridge, or one of the spheres, and r2 itself is positive and equals rneck when calculated at the neck 
point. r1 is evaluated in a direction containing the meriodional bridge profile and can be positive or 
negative depending on whether or not its center of curvature lies inside or outside the liquid bridge. A 
positive value of the parentheses in equation 1.7 leads to a positive pressure difference ΔP and thereby 
an attractive contribution to the pendular force in equation 1.6 (Willet et al., 2000). The values of r1 and 
r2 can be evaluated at any point along the bridge profile r(x) as it can be shown that the Laplace-Young 
equation can be rewritten according to (Willet et al., 2000 and Iveson et al., 2001a):

The determination of the exact surface profiles requires complex numerical procedures even for the 
simple case of equally sized spheres and equation 2.8 cannot be solved analytically. This has led to the 
use of approximate geometries such as circular (torodial) and hyperbolic arcs, which have been shown 
to result in errors in bridge areas and volumes of the order of 1 % (Simons et al., 1994). This has further 
led to a debate as to whether the surface tension and capillary pressure should be evaluated at the mid-
point of the liquid bridge where r2 = rneck instead of being evaluated at the surface of the particles as it 
is the case with the boundary method. The prior principle is often referred to as the gorge method and 
according to Lian et al., (1993), this approach will give an expression for the pendular force according to:

in which rneck is the pendular bridge neck radius according to figure 5.
Whereas results by Hotta et al. (1974) supports the use of a slightly modified boundary method, other 
results by Lian et al. (1993) indicates that the gorge method is the most precise and versatile. Attempts 
of approximation of the total pendular force instead of relying on an analytical bridge profile solution 
have been reported by Willet et al. (2000), and one example for a small pendular bridge volume between 
two spheres is:

(Willet et al., 2000).
Interestingly, it can be seen from equation 1.10 that the pendular bridge force is directly proportional to 
the liquid adhesion tension (γlv ⋅ cos θ). This is in accordance with the wetting thermodynamic studies 
reviewed by Hede (2005).
Other expressions for equally sized spheres can be found in Israelachvili (1992). Rabinovich et al. (2005)

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
Granule static strength decreases as binder surface tension is lowered in respect to the surface tension 
of the solid particle material. This is because the capillary suction pressure ΔP as well as the surface 
tension forces are both proportional to the liquid surface tension γlv (Rumpf, 1962 and Iveson, 2001). 
Likewise is it also expected that granule strength will decrease as the contact angle increases due to the 
decreased wetting as emphasised in Hede (2005 & 2006b).
Static strength of liquid-bound granules is commonly measured and described in terms of tensile static 
strength. Pioneer work by Rumpf (1962) in the sixties has lead to a generally accepted form for the 
pendular bridge according to (Pierrat & Caram, 1997 and Ennis & Sunshine, 1993):

in which kcn is the coordination number being a function of the particle packing density10, ε is the particle 
void fraction, dp the particle diameter and Fpendular, boundary is given by equation 1.6. The model is based 
on the assumption that all of the powder particles are monosized spheres distributed uniformly in the 
agglomerate on an average. Secondly, it is assumed that the pendular bonds are, on an average, uniformly 
distributed over the surface and over the directions in space. Finally, the effective pendular bonding 
forces are assumed to be distributed around a mean value, which can be used in the calculations. These 
assumptions are generally accepted and several empirical correlations based on the original Rumpf form 
exist. Schubert (1973 & 1975) reviews a few suggestions being globally of the same form as equation 1.14. 
Pierrat & Caram (1997) have fitted data from a range of different articles by different workers into a

In the case of capillary liquid bridges where all the pores are completely filled with liquid, the interfacial 
forces exist only at the surface of the agglomerate and a negative capillary pressure develops in the 
interior, holding the particles together. In that case, the static tensile strength is given as (Schubert, 1975

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
The original Rumpf model as well as the models in equation 1.16 and in equation 1.17 predict that 
granule tensile strength is proportional to the liquid surface tension and saturation, and that σt,c further 
increases with decreasing porosity and is inversely proportional to the particle diameter. All of these 
trends have been validated by experimental data, but quantitatively the models tend to over-predict 
the granule strength due to fact that these models fail to account for the presence of extensive pore 
networks in the particles forming the agglomerate. As it has been showed by Beekman (2000), failure 
often occurs by crack growth along such pore structures and not by sudden failure across the whole 
liquid bridge plane. Some of the newer tensile strength models try to account for this problem but as 
still most of the work on tensile strength of liquid bound granules is performed at slow and invariant 
strain rates, the applicability of the above presented equations is still not accurate enough for quantitative 
granulation purposes. This is due to the fact that it is the amount of impact deformation and breakage 
that is critical in determining agglomerate growth and breakage behaviour in fluid bed granulation 
equipment (Beekman, 2000 and Hede, 2005). That means that dynamic forces may become significant 
in the fluid bed granulation process, especially when viscous binders are involved. Hence, the following 
sections focus on the dynamic strength of liquid bridges.
1.3.1.3	 Dynamic strength – viscous forces
The dynamic strength of a liquid bound granule can be approximated using lubrication theory as a 
viscous force Fvis, which according to Lian et al. (1998) and Iveson et al. (2001a) may be expressed as:

in which u0 is the relative initial velocity of the two particles, ηliq the liquid viscosity and λ is a parameter 
being a function of the harmonic mean radius11 of the two particles rharm and the separation distance 
between the two spheres H. For small separation distances between two spheres in an infinite fluid, λ 
may be found as (Weinbaum & Caro, 1976):

None of the two mentioned expressions for λ are appropriate to calculate precisely the viscous forces as 
the underlying assumption that the particles move in an infinite fluid does not hold. Instead, Jen and

The expression for λ is thereby independent of the separation distance H which is in contrast to 
experimental results reported by other authors (Ennis et al., 1990 and Iveson et al., 2001a). Acknowledging 
that liquid bridges also have a viscous resistance to shear strain besides the previously solely assumed 
axial strain, Goldman et al. (1987) derived another relationship based on lubrication theory for small 
separation distances according to12:

Results by Mazzone et al. (1987) indicated that dynamic liquid bridges are much stronger than 
geometrically identical static liquid bridges in which the attraction forces is due to surface tension only, 
as presented in the previous section. It was seen that the force required to separate two moving particles 
is often significantly higher than that required in static situations because the viscosity of the liquid resists 
the motion in the dynamic case. These observations help to explain why even small amounts of liquid 
can drastically change the properties and fluidisation behaviour during e.g. fluid bed coating.

1.3.1.4	 Breakage and attrition of wet granules
The granule breakage phenomena may in principle be divided into the breakage of wet and breakage of 
dry granules. Whereas dry granule breakage is often treated as a separate discipline often without much 
attention to the process conditions, wet granule breakage is closely related to the previously introduced 
theory. Although much of the basic theory and parameters regarding the mechanical strength and 
breakage mechanisms are similar, there are a number of differences between the breakage of a liquid 
bridge and the breakage of a solid amorphous or crystalline bond or layer. The mechanical properties 
and breakage phenomena of dried granules and coating layers were extensively covered in Hede (2005 
& 2006b) and more introductionary information can be found in Beekman (2000) as well as in a 
comprehensive recent review by Reynolds et al. (2005). The topics on breakage and attrition of wet 
granules were however only slightly covered and more on this topic will be presented below.
In the last step of the granulation process, the agglomerates grow too large to resist the agitative motions 
in the bed. Coalescence will be counteracted by either an attrition of debris of the granule surface either 
partly or totally, or by fracture of the agglomerate bonding. This is due to insufficient binder distribution 
or simply due to the static stress in the drying liquid bridges (Iveson et al., 2001a). A total fracture of 
wet or dry granules is seldom a problem in fluid bed granulation however. The low shear properties 
in the bed rarely give sufficient kinetic energy to fracture the granules completely (Waldie, 1991 and 
Schaafsma, 2000b). Simulations as well as experiments performed by Khan & Tardos (1997) indicate 
that agglomerates are often broken upon deformation by stretching when being sheared. They further 
showed that the stability of wet agglomerates is closely related to the Stokes deformation number Stdef 
and that two regimes exist involving high and low deformation characteristics based on the Stdef number. 
Khan & Tardos (1997) defined the Stokes deformation number according to:

where σy is the yield strength, ηapp is an apparent viscosity, nfi the flow index and  the shear rate (Tardos 
et al., 1997 and Fu et al., 2004). The Stokes deformation number defined in equation 1.23 increases with 
increasing particle size and reaches at some point during granulation a critical value of St def
 * above 
which the agglomerates start to deform and eventually break. The critical Stokes deformation number 
is not as well-defined as the critical viscous Stokes number introduced in Hede (2005 & 2006b). This 
is due to the fact that, from a rheological point of view, the system consisting of particles bound by 
viscous liquid bridges is a complex system that exhibits both yield strength as well as non-Newtonian 
behaviour. Assuming that the agglomerate is a very concentrated slurry of the binder material and the 
original particles, a first assumption is that the apparent viscosity ηapp is negligible compared with the 
yield strength meaning that

(1.26)
in which rdef
* is the critical radius of the agglomerate after which deformation and breakage occurs. 
Equation 1.26 thereby predicts an inverse linear relationship between the critical agglomerate radius and 
the shear rate, which in fact has been observed in simulations as well as experiments by Tardos et al. 
(1997) and Khan & Tardos (1997). 
There is generally very limited experimental work on fracture and attrition of wet granules in fluid 
beds as most work focuses on higher intensity mixer and hybrid granulators as drum and high shear 
mixing (e.g. Fu et al., 2004). In fact the works of Tardos et al. (1997) and Khan & Tardos (1997) are the 
only works so far specialised on fluid bed granulation. This is most likely due to the fact that the high 
intensity granulation makes it much easier to estimate the average shear forces and the collision velocity 
based on equipment parameters. Some of the newest experimental studies by Fu et al. (2005) indicate 
conveniently that the failure patterns of wet granules in high shear mixing equipment have a number 
of common features that have been observed for dry granules including the formation of debris with 
conical geometry. Most of the basic theory regarding mechanical strength and breakage mechanisms 
cannot however be applied readily for wet granules.

Fu et al. (2005) observed that at small impact velocities, the agglomerates displayed homogenous elastic, 
elastoplastic and plastic deformation. At some critical strain, stable meridian cracks propagate from the 
impact zone in accordance with the theory emphasised in Hede (2005 & 2006b). At larger strains, chips 
were formed and the formation of larger fragments increased with increasing impact velocity for the wet 
granules. It was seen additionally, that the critical impact velocity for the formation of observable cracks 
increased with decreasing granule size and increasing binder viscosity. Further it was concluded that 
agglomerates made with relative coarse primary particles were generally more friable than agglomerates 
made with very fine primary particles, and thus it was observed for the wet coarse particle agglomerates, 
that the critical impact velocity decreased monotonically with increasing binder because of the reduction 
in the fracture strength (Fu et al., 2005). 
1.3.1.5	 Wet granule strength summary
As emphasised in previous sections, the strength of agglomerates in the size range of roughly 10–1200 μm 
is controlled by three main types of forces being static (capillary), frictional and viscous (dynamic) 
forces. These forces are interrelated in a complex way and their relative importance varies greatly with 
process and formulation conditions. This makes systematic experimental investigations of wet granule 
strength a difficult subject although studies of wet granular strength are somewhat more important than 
dry granular strength in respect to granulation (Fu et al., 2005).

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
As it has been reviewed in earlier sections, traditional models do not include all three types of forces, 
and e.g. the often quoted model by Rumpf (1962) consider only capillary forces. Such simplified models 
may be sufficient for coarse particle systems held together by non-viscous binders but must be considered 
invalid for agglomerates composed of fine particles bound by viscous binders (Iveson et al., 2001a). 
That means that if any model should be quantitatively applicable to industrial granulation processes, 
this model must include all three types of forces. Developing models capable of predicting the complex 
interactions of capillary, viscous and frictional forces that occur during wet granule impacts will be a 
challenging task. Some of the latest results by Fu et al. (2005) indicate however that that impact failure 
mechanisms of wet granules have a number of common features observed for breakage of dry granules 
including the formation of debris with certain geometries etc. This is fortunate as the breakage of dry 
granule traditionally has been more widely studied than the breakage of wet granules. 
One of the modern approaches has been to try to simulate breakage of wet granules using primarily 
discrete element method (DEM). The use of DEM in simulations seems to make some progress in this 
field. E.g. have Lian et al. (1998) performed discrete element modelling simulations of dynamic granule 
impacts. They simulated the collision of agglomerates in the pendular states under conditions found 
in common fluid bed granulators. Results indicated that granule strength is controlled by viscous and 
interparticle frictional energy dissipation with static surface energies playing only a minor role. The use 
of DEM to simulate the breakage of wet agglomerates is nevertheless a relative new scientific field and 
it still remains to be seen whether this technique can be used to predict the complex effects of binder 
content, wetting behaviour and other variables such as the influence of particle morphology on wet 
granule strength (Reynolds et al., 2005 and Iveson et al., 2001a). 
1.3.2	
Granule growth modelling – Class I and Class II models
There are a large number of theoretical models available in the literature for predicting whether or not 
the collision of two wetted particles will either result in permanent coalescence or just in rebound. All 
models are associated with a number of assumptions and simplifications regarding the mechanical 
properties of the particles as well as the system in which the particles collide. Some of the first models 
were developed for predicting the sintering of fluidised beds used in the mining industry, but later models 
have adapted to specifically describe the granulation process (Iveson et al., 2001a). Although being very 
different in nature Iveson et al. (2001a) have divided the granulation models into two classes of which 
the distinction principles can be sketched according to figure 6.

Figure 6: Principles behind different classes of agglomeration models. 
Schematic diagram of the two general classes of coalescence models:  
Class I models: Stick or rebound, Class II models: Survival or separation (based on Iveson, 2001).
Class I models assume that the granules are free to move and that elastic properties of the particle bodies 
are important. These models assume that initial coalescence occurs only if the kinetic energy of collision 
is entirely dissipated and that otherwise the granules will rebound and move apart. Various combinations 
of energy dissipation has been considered by different authors including elastic losses, plastic deformation, 
viscous and capillary forces in the liquid binder and adhesion energies of the contact surfaces. In class 
I models it is implicitly assumed that if the initial impact results in permanent coalescence, then none 
of the subsequent impacts will be able to break the two granules again. This means in other words that 
coalescence is assumed to occur whenever the two particles do not possess sufficient kinetic energy to 
rebound (Iveson et al., 2001a). It further implies that all collisions at near-zero velocities will result in 
permanent coalescence (Iveson, 2001). 
Class II models on the other hand assume that elastic effects are negligible during the initial collision 
usually because it is assumed that the granules are plastic in nature and/or physically constrained by 
surrounding granules. This leads to the simplification that all colliding granules are in contact for a finite 
time Δt during which a liquid bridge develops between them. Permanent coalescence thereby only occurs 
if this liquid bridge is strong enough to resist being broken apart by subsequent collisions or shear forces. 
The strength of the binding bridge is assumed to be dependent on factors such as the initial amount of 
plastic deformation and the length of time that the two particles were in contact, which in other words 
means that it is assumed that the bonding bridge will increase in strength as the liquid bridge turns into 
a solid bridge upon evaporation of the binder solvent.

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
Due to the simplicity of both model classes, a lot of relevant critics are associated with both views on 
modelling the agglomeration part of the granulation process. The coalescence criteria in Class I models 
are typically criticised for being unreasonable for most fluid bed granulation applications because this 
class of models neglects the effect of subsequent collisions. Two granules which stick initially together may 
in reality be so weakly held together that they would quickly break apart again. It is also unreasonable 
to assume that coalescence is controlled solely by the initial collision energy, when in many applications 
the granules are constrained in contact with one another for significant lengths of time as it occurs in 
the quiescent zones of a fluid bed. In these cases there is no single and uniform single collision event. 
Instead the granules are constantly in contact with several others (Iveson, 2001). This means in other 
words that although non-rebound is a necessary condition for permanent coalescence, it is not always 
a sufficient condition. Not only do the particles need to stick when they first collide but they must also 
form a bond strong enough to resist being broken by subsequent impacts in the fluid bed. This is not 
accounted for in Class I models thereby being an obvious limitation. 
In all existing Class II models, only the first major separation event is considered and the magnitude 
of separation is usually approximated by some global average value. If the particle-particle bonding 
bridge survives this single event then it is considered to be a permanent agglomeration bond. However, 
in many granulators the separation events may have a wide range of magnitudes and may further be 
distributed randomly in time. Therefore some criticisers state that it is inappropriate to model coalescence 
by assuming a mean separation force which occurs at regular intervals and that the probability of the 
survival of a bonding bridge rather will depend on the history of impacts and the rate at which the 
binding bridges strengthens as they are kneaded together by a number of low-level impacts (Iveson, 2001). 
Class II models have generally been developed and optimised for high collision granulation equipment 
such as high shear mixing or drum granulation. It is necessary to account for deformability of the 
granules during collision as well as the rupture forces in such high agitative equipment and a number 
of different class II coalescence models have been presented by e.g. Ouchiyama & Tanaka (1975) for 
drum granulation. In fluid bed equipment, the agitative forces and thereby the collisions are quite small 
which also implies that deformation of the particles upon collision may often be neglected with good 
approximation. This means that assumptions associated with Class I models have proven to be more 
accurate than those associated with Class II models, and the latter type is almost never applied with fluid 
bed systems. Hence, only Class I models will be presented here. For most industrial fluid bed purposes it 
is often adequate to model the situation in which non-deformable particles collide and coalesce and only 
in rare cases is it necessary to study coalescence of deformable particles, although it may be necessary 
in some granulating fluid bed systems depending on the bed material. Both types of class I models will 
be introduced in the following section.

1.3.2.1	 Class I models: Coalescence of non-deformable granules 
The gentle agitative forces in fluid beds mean that little permanent deformation usually occurs. Under 
such low-agitative conditions granules coalesce by viscous dissipation in the surface liquid before the 
granule core surfaces contact (Liu et al., 2000). As the two particles approach each other, first contact 
is made by the outer liquid binder layer. The liquid will subsequently be squeezed out from the space 
between the particles to the point where the two solid surfaces will touch. A solid rebound will occur 
based on the elasticity of the surface characterized by a coefficient of restitution15 e. The particles will 
start to move apart and liquid binder will be sucked into the interparticle gap up to the point where 
a liquid bridge will form. This bridge will either break due to further movement in the bed or solidify 
leading to permanent coalescence (Tardos et al., 1997). In the described principle, granule coalescence will 
occur only if there is a liquid layer present at the surface of the colliding particles. This growth principle 
continues until insufficient binder liquid is available at the surface to bind new particles (Schaafsma 
et al., 1998). The relative amount of binder liquid present at that stage is called the wetting saturation Sw 
and it depends on the contact angle of binder liquid and the pore structure of the granule (Tardos et al., 
1997). The wetting saturation reflects the wettability of the particle and it is often approximated by the 
binder droplet volume divided by the pore volume of a particle, under the assumption that no drying 
occurs (Schaafsma et al., 2000a). Schaafsma et al. (2000a) have showed that Sw is inversely proportional 
to the nucleation ratio J and the mean granule porosity

Ennis et al. (1991) have modelled the situation of coalescence in a fluid bed by considering the impact 
of two solid non-deformable spheres each of which is surrounded by a thin viscous binder layer. The 
simplified situation can be seen in figure 7.

Schematic of two colliding granules each of which is covered by a viscous binder layer of thickness h0  
(Based on Ennis et al., 1991).
The principles of the model by Ennis et al. (1991) was introduced in Hede (2005 & 2006b) but will be 
further emphasised in the present section. Being a typical Class I model it assumes successful coalescence 
to occur if the kinetic energy of impact is entirely dissipated by viscous dissipation in the binder liquid 
layer and only elastic losses in the solid phase. The model predicts that collisions will result in coalescence 
when the viscous Stokes number (Stv) is less than a critical viscous Stokes number (Stv
*). The two numbers 
are given as (Ennis et al., 1991)16:

The Stokes viscous number Stv can be seen as the ratio of kinetic energy to the viscous dissipation. During 
fluid bed batch granulation Stv increases as the granules grow in size. This leads to three possible situations. 
The first so-called “non-inertial regime” occurs when Stv << Stv
*. All collisions result in successful 
coalescence regardless of the size of the colliding granules, granule kinetic energy or binder viscosity. As 
the granules grow larger the “inertial regime” occurs when Stv ≈ Stv
*. The likelihood of coalescence now 
depends of the size of the colliding granules, and granule kinetic energy and binder viscosity begin to 
play a role (Iveson et al., 2001a and Abbott, 2002). It can be seen from equation 1.29 and 1.27 that the 
collision between two small or one small and one large granule is more likely to succeed in permanent 
coalescence than the collision between two large granules due to the size of rharm and thereby the size 
of Stv versus Stv
*. This is a convenient way to understand why small particles agglomerate into larger 
ones (Tardos et al., 1997). Eventually the system enters the “coating regime” when Stv >> Stv
*. Here all 
collisions between granules are unsuccessful and any further increase in the Stv will maintain the size of 
the granules (Iveson et al., 2001a and Tardos et al., 1997). The existence of the three regimes has been 
proved experimentally in different types of granulators (Ennis et al., 1991). 
Granule growth is promoted by a low value of Stv and a high value of Stv
*. For instance, increasing the 
binder content will increase the binder layer thickness h0 which will increase Stv
* and hence increase the 
likelihood of successful coalescence. The effect of the binder viscosity is not easily predictable in that 
e.g. increasing the value ηliq (lowering Stv) alters the coefficient of restitution e decreasing Stv
* as well 
(Iveson et al., 2001a). 
Although the Stv and the Stv
* are important parameters in the prediction of coalescence they are only valid 
for predicting the maximum size of granules which can coalesce. The parameters state nothing about the 
rate of granule growth. Different authors have showed however, that fast growth rates are attributed to 
the non-inertial regime while a slower growth is attributed to values of Stv close to or above Stv
* (Ennis 
et al. 1991 and Cryer, 1999).

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
The model by Ennis et al. (1991) was a significant progress in the modelling of particle-level coalescence 
in fluid beds as it was the first model to consider dynamic affects such as viscous dissipation. Results by 
e.g. Ennis et al. (1991) and Hede (2005) indeed shows that agglomeration tendency is closely related to 
the relative sizes of Stv
* versus Stv
 . The model is nevertheless limited by its many assumptions17 although 
is gives a rough number for the indication of the limit between no-agglomeration and successful 
agglomeration. The model is however only valid for non-deformable surface wet granules where the 
viscous forces are much larger than capillary forces. These approximations will not always hold for all 
granulating fluid bed systems and sometimes more advanced models must be used. The next section 
introduces an extension of the original Ennis et al. (1991) model.
1.3.2.2	 Class I models: Coalescence of deformable granules 
Despite the gentle nature of fluid bed agitation compared to other granulating systems, some particle 
materials will deform upon collision in fluid beds. Based on the original model by Ennis et al. (1991), Liu 
et al. (2000) extended the viscous Stokes theory to include the effect of plastic deformation of the granules 
upon collision. Granules are assumed to have a strain-rate independent of Young’s modulus E and plastic 
yield stress Yd. Liu et al (2000) consider two cases being surface wet granules and surface dry granules 
where liquid is squeezed to the granule surfaces by the impact. In respect to fluid bed granulation and 
coating, only the first case is relevant and will be presented in the following. Behind the model lies the 
assumption that coalescence occurs when the kinetic energy of impact is all dissipated through viscous 
dissipation in the liquid layer as well as through plastic deformation of the granule bulk. It is further 
assumed that granule surfaces only deform when they come into physical contact, which may hold for 
fluid bed situations but not in e.g. mixer equipment where the pressure generated by the coating fluid 
being squeezed between the surfaces will cause some precontact deformation. Of further assumptions 
should be mentioned that attractive interparticle forces in the contact area are assumed to be negligible 
and that fluid cavitation does not occur during rebound (Liu et al., 2000). 
The model extension by Liu et al. (2000) divides the coalescence phenomenon into two types – type I 
and type II, which must not to be confounded with the coalescence model of Class I and Class II. Type I 
coalescence occurs when granules coalesce by viscous dissipation by the surface liquid before the granules 
are able to touch (Iveson et al., 2001a). That is, the granules are halted and coalesce before their surfaces 
come into contact. Type II coalescence occurs when granules are slowed to a halt during rebound, after 
their surfaces have made contact (Liu et al., 2000). In type II coalescence the relative granule velocity is 
reduced to zero by viscous forces during rebound after their surfaces have made contact. It is important 
to note that both deformable and non-deformable granules can grow by either mechanism although 
deformable granules can coalesce by type II over a greater range of Stv values (Liu et al., 2000).

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
The general simplified coalescence situation for both coalescence types can be illustrated by dividing the 
particle collision situation into four stages. In figure 8 the collision between two surface wet deformable 
granules is considered. The first stage is the approach stage. At a separation distance of 2h0 the liquid 
layers touch and merge. This combined liquid layer will then be squeezed by out as the granules approach, 
dissipating some of the kinetic energy of collision. In the second deformation stage the granules will 
begin to deform as the separation distance reduces to 2hasp, which is the height of the surface asperities, 
and the relative granule velocity is reduced to 2u1. The remaining kinetic energy is converted to stored 
elastic energy and dissipated by plastic deformation. When the relative collision velocity is reduced to 
zero a contact area of A* is formed between the granules. In the third separation stage the granules begin 
to rebound with an initial velocity of u2 as the stored elastic energy is released. Viscous dissipation in 
the surface liquid layer will again retard the granule movement. In the fourth last separation stage the 
liquid layers are assumed to separate and the granule rebound to be complete when the granules are 
separated to a distance of 2h0 leaving the granules with a velocity of u3.

B) Deformation stage. C) Initial separation stage. D) Final separation stage (Based on Iveson et al., 2001a and Liu et al., 2000).
Following the terminology of figure 8, type I coalescence occurs if the viscous forces are so high that the 
granule velocity u1 is less than zero indicating that coalescence occur before the granule surfaces come 
into contact. In such a situation, permanent coalescence will occur if the following condition is satisfied:

For granule collision situations with u1 > 0 at the separation distance of 2hasp, the granule surfaces come

The Stokes deformation number can be seen as the ratio of impact kinetic energy to plastic deformation 
in the granule core. It gives a measure of the amount of plastic deformation that the granules would have 
suffered during the collision had there been no viscous liquid layer present. 
Based on the criteria for type I and type II coalescence, a plot of Stv versus Stdef indicating the boundaries 
between the two types of coalescence has been suggested by Liu et al. (2000) according to figure 9:
Figure 9: Class I coalescence. 
Values of the Stokes viscous number Stv versus the Stokes deformation number Stdef showing 
regions of rebound and coalescence for wet deformable granules (Liu et al., 2000).

Figure 9 suggests that three primary regions exists being rebound, type I and type II regions. In accordance 
with the models in equation 1.27 and equation 1.36, figure 9 suggests that at low Stdef number the 
likelihood of coalescence depends only on the critical viscous Stokes number Stv
* as it was suggested by 
the original model for non-deformable granules by Ennis et al. (1991). In this region all collisions are 
fully elastic. As Stdef increases, the coalescence region extends over a wider range of Stv values. This is 
because permanent granule deformation occurs which improves the likeliness of permanent coalescence 
in two ways: First of all it dissipates some of the impact energy and secondly, it creates a flat surface 
of area A* between the two granules which creates a greater viscous dissipation force during rebound 
(Iveson et al., 2001a). In comparison to the original model by Ennis et al. (1991), the extension by Liu 
et al. (2000) results in a model that predicts that when plastic deformation is significant, increasing the 
impact velocity may actually improve the likelihood of coalescence by shifting a system from rebound 
back into the coalescence region. This situation is rarely observed in fluid beds however, as the low 
agitative forces result in coalescence domains in which Stdef and Stv numbers are both small. 
Despite the improvement of the original Ennis et al (1991) model, the model by Liu et al. (2000) still suffers 
many of the same limitations. E.g. are capillary forces still neglected although these are acknowledged 
having an importance. Likewise has no account been taken of any possible breakage of chipping during 
collision. The Liu et al. (2000) model is however most likely currently the best available model to describe 
coalescence situations at particle level, and validation experiments with glass ballotini cores in drum 
granulation equipment seems promising (Liu et al., 2000). 
1.3.3	
Granule growth regimes
With basis in the Stokes deformation number in equation 1.36 Iveson & Litster (1998) proposed that 
there are basically two broad categories of granule growth behaviour being steady growth and induction 
growth. At steady growth the size of the agglomerates increases linearly with time while at the induction 
growth there is a delay period during which little growth occurs.
Steady growth occurs in systems with weak and deformable granules. Granules in this regime grow by 
either crushing or deformation, thereby creating a large area during impact which promotes the chance 
of permanent coalescence. Steady growth is generally exhibited by relatively coarse, narrowly sized 
particles. Induction growth occurs in systems which are relatively strong. The granules do not deform 
sufficiently during impact to be able to coalesce without the presence of liquid binder at the particle 
surfaces. Hence, after the initial nuclei form, there is a delay period during which little growth. If the 
granules consolidate sufficiently to squeeze binder liquid to the surface, then the granules will begin to 
grow quickly until a critical size is reached above which the torque experienced by the dumbbell particle 
pairs becomes too large for further coalescence growth. Induction growth is generally seen in systems 
with fine widely spread particles and/or viscous binders. Whereas steady growth has been observed in 
fluid bed granulating systems, induction growth has not yet been reported in fluid beds probably because 
the impact forces are too low to cause significant consolidation as emphasised in Hede (2005 & 2006b).

Iveson & Litster (1998) suggested that the type of granule growth behaviour is a function of two 
parameters only being the amount of granule deformation during impact according to equation 1.36 
and the maximum pore liquid saturation being a measure of the liquid content according to:

in which wmr is the mass ratio of liquid to solid, ρp is the density of the solid particles, ρb is the density 
of the binder liquid and εmin is the minimum porosity the formulation reaches for that particular set 
of operating conditions. The liquid saturation terms smax must include any extra liquid volume due to 
solids dissolution but should not include any liquid which is absorbed into the porous carrier particles 
(Iveson et al., 2001a and 2001b).

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
Based on values of smax and Stdef, Iveson & Litster (1998) suggested a granule growth regime map according 
to figure 10:
 Figure 10: Granule growth regime map (Iveson & Litster, 1998).
In the original regime map by Iveson & Litster (1998) a number of subcategories of steady and induction 
growth were suggested. Nucleation growth only occurs when granule nuclei form, but on the same 
time there is insufficient binder to promote further growth. Crumb behaviour occurs when the binder 
conditions are too weak to form permanent coalesced granules but instead form a loose crumb material 
which cushions a few larger granules which are constantly breaking and reforming (Iveson et al., 2001a). 
Overwetting occurs when excess binder has been added and the system forms an oversaturated slush 
or slurry (Iveson & Litster, 1998). The original regime map does not include any values of the Stokes 
deformation number for which the regimes change. Work by Iveson et al. (2001b) suggested a modified 
granule growth regime map in which the location of several of the regime boundaries has been identified 
quantitatively. Iveson et al. (2001b) suggested that the crumb and slurry regions occur at Stdef > 0.1 
with slurries when smax > 100%. The transition from nucleation to induction growth also occurs at  
smax = 100%. The smax at which steady growth begins is shown to decrease with increasing Stdef. In accordance 
with these observations, Iveson et al. (2001b) proposed a modified regime map according to figure 11.
Figure 11: Modified granule growth regime map (Iveson et al., 2001b).

Fluid bed agglomeration at particle level
Although being a step towards a quantitative prediction of the agglomeration phenomena, the granule 
growth regime map is still more of a descriptive tool and not a predictive one. This is due to the fact that 
the two parameters smax and Stdef require a-priori knowledge of the maximum extent of consolidation 
since this affects granule yield stress as well as pore saturation. Another significant shortcoming is 
the very simplistic rheological model used to describe the mechanical properties of the granules. It is 
assumed that the granules are rigid-plastic materials whereas in reality as previously stated, wet granular 
materials are complex visco-elastic-plastic materials with strain-rate and history dependent behaviour 
(Iveson et al., 2001a). Subsequent work by Iveson et al. (2001b) suggests that binder viscosity20 needs 
to be included as a third independent parameter in the granule growth regime map thereby expanding 
the map into three dimensions. The regime map boundaries also suffer from the fact that it is associated 
with great difficulty of comparing different types of equipment using the regime map because of the 
uncertainty of the correct characteristic granule impact velocity (Iveson et al., 2001a). A suggestion for 
further work could be to develop an equipment specific regime map as not all regimes in the current 
maps are observed for all types of equipment.

Summary
Summary
The modelling of the different processes that occur during granulation at particle level may at first seem 
a too simplified approach in the process of being able to describe the entire granulating system. Much of 
the theory presented in the present text takes a starting point in the situation where only two particles 
interact and in addition only considers a situation in which only one of many types of processes occurs. 
Further, a lot of assumptions are associated with the theory, and a-priori knowledge is often needed in 
order to apply the equations quantitatively. The situation inside e.g. a fluid bed during granulation is 
obviously far more complex and many of the parameters needed in the micro-level equations cannot be 
determined easily or if they can, the single needed property may in fact consist of a wide distribution 
of values rather than a single value. That is e.g. the case with the particle collision velocities u0 as 
previously emphasised. Hence, much of the theory presented may most likely not be applied readily for 
real granulating systems for other than qualitative purposes. 
Micro-level modelling is nevertheless a vital tool towards a complete engineering of the granulation 
process at all scales. Although the introduced approaches are somewhat too simplified, they form a 
vital part in the process towards a fundamental understanding of the granulation process. Only by 
simplifications is it possible to study the various granulation processes and phenomena in detail. As it is 
the present case that meso-scale properties are still unknown, detailed micro-level theory is a prerequisite 
in the modelling of the granulation process at larger macro-level scale, and as it has been presented 
elsewhere (e.g. in Hede, 2006a), micro-level understanding play an important role in the different 
simulation techniques as well as population balance modelling of the fluid bed granulation process.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

1.	
Please refer to Hede (2005) section 4.2.3.
2.	
More on Monte Carlo techniques may be found in Hede (2006a).
3.	
Please refer to Hede (2005) section 4.2.4.
4.	
The time it takes for a particle to circulate a complete wetting-drying cycle. It depends primarily on the 
fluidisation velocity and bed height, as it was presented in Hede (2005 & 2006b).
5.	
Please refer to equation 4.11 in Hede (2005).
6.	
It can be shown mathematically that this does not affect the density of binder liquid along the width of 
the spray zone (Wildeboer et al., 2005).
7.	
There may obviously also be buoyancy force due to the partial submersion of the particle spheres but 
Princen (1968) showed that this is negligible for particle spheres with diameters less than 1 mm.
8.	
Only large liquid bridges are affected by gravitational distortion (Simons et al., 1994). 
9.	
Sometimes also referred to as the capillary suction pressure (Iveson et al., 2001a).
10.	
Ennis & Sunshine (1993) suggest a value for kcn of 1.1.
11.	
Please refer to equation 1.29.
12.	
Equation 1.22 has not yet been fully verified (Iveson et al., 2002).
13.	
The Herschel-Bulkley model is often preferred to power law or Bingham relationships as it results in 
more accurate models on Non-Newtonian behaviour when adequate experimental data is available 
(London, 2005). 
14.	
Please note that this assumption is basically the same assumption presented by Ennis et al. (1991) in 
which the collision velocity is based on the bubble rise velocity Ubr, bubble diameter db, radius of the 
agglomerate raggl and the axial fluid bed bubble spacing δ. Please refer to Hede (2005), pp. 22 for further 
information.
15.	
The coefficient of restitution is the ratio of the difference in velocity before and after the collision. In the 
case of two colliding particles it is the difference in the velocities of the two colliding particles after the 
collision divided by the difference in their velocity prior to collision. Perfect elastic collisions has e = 1 
(Christensen et al., 2000). The coefficient of restitution e thereby accounts for the viscous dissipation in 
the binder phase being sufficient to dissipate the energy of collision (Liu et al., 2000).
16.	
Please refer to appendix A4 in Hede (2006b) to see the derivation of equation 1.27 and equation 1.28.
17.	
For instance that there exists a uniform granule collision velocity or that in coalescence, capillary forces 
can be neglected (Ennis et al., 1991). Ennis et al. (1991) justified neglecting capillary forces on the basis 
that the energy added during liquid bridge formation and granule approach is cancelled by the energy 
dissipated during granule separation and liquid bridge rupture. This is a rough assumption as that dynamic 
energy of the pendular bridge and the rupture energy are equal only if the collision has a coefficient 
of restitution equal to one, which is almost never the case (Liu et al., 2000). Especially the difficulty of 
determining a precise collision velocity u0 makes the viscous Stokes theory difficult to exploit fully in 
practice (Abbott, 2002).

Poissons ratio is the ratio of transverse contraction strain to longitudinal extension strain in the direction 
of the stretching force. Tensile deformation is considered positive and the compressive deformation is 
considered negative. Hence, the Poisson ration is defined as: ν = -εtrans / εlongitudinal (Wisconsin, 2005).
19.	
Please note that the superstructure of equation 1.36 in fact is the same as equation 1.23 in which the 
harmonic mean mass has been substituted with the mass of the agglomerate, the harmonic mean radius with 
the volume of the agglomerate and the plastic yield stress with the characteristic stress in the agglomerate.
20.	
Characterised by the viscous Stokes number Stv (Iveson et al., 2001b).
