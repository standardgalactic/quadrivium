In the current metrics frenzy, the “measure of the day” is the focus of most
discussion and action. Unfortunately, this approach generates streams of
short-term data but not much in long-term solutions. More emphasis should
be given to the philosophy and development of the measurement process
itself—in essence, “what we want to know, and what we are going to do
when we ﬁnd out about it.”
Those Who Have Craftily Applied Metrics
For instance, Baldrige award winner, Stephen H. Woodward, vice president
of logistics and purchasing at Armstrong World Industries, Inc., Worldwide
Building Products Operations (Lancaster, Penn.; shwoodwrd@armstrong.
com), believes, “Without an effective, well-deﬁned and communicated strat-
egy, it is difﬁcult to set the ‘right’ type of measurement.” Further, he wants
the feedback “quickly enough so the people receiving the metrics can initi-
ate actions to correct the problems that have been uncovered.”
And, Alan L. Milliken, CFPIM, CIRM, and manager of supply chain
projects at BASF Corp. (Mount Olive, N.J.; millika@bask.com) explains,
“We’re looking for measurement processes, and not just a list of measure-
ments.” To achieve this, he outlines some primary factors that performance
metrics should provide. They should
3

• Set expectations. “We align our metrics within the organization and
link them to our customers’ and shareholders’ expectations,” he ex-
plains.
• Control. The applied metrics should enable self-evaluation and facili-
tate control of linked performance.
• Identify opportunities. “We look to the metrics to quantify the gaps be-
tween performance and target, which then facilitates the develop-
ment of our action plans,” he offers.
Create a Framework for Measurements
“There are many standards by which we judge performance measures, but the
idea is to create the criteria ﬁrst, before you just throw the individual metrics
out there,” maintains J. Paul Dittmann, vice president of global logistics at
Whirlpool Corp. (St. Joseph, Mich.; john_p_dittman@email.whirlpool.com).
He particularly recommends integration economy. “That’s really our
challenge in the supply chain because trying to get all of the functions oper-
ating as a process can be difﬁcult,” he notes. See the sidebar for other criteria.

Ways to Evaluate Performance Measures

Description
Validity
The metric accurately captures the events and activities be-
ing measured and controls for any exogenous factors.
Robustness
The metric is interpreted similarly by the users and is com-
parable across time, location, and organization.
Usefulness
The metric is readily understandable by the decision maker
and provides a guide for action to be taken.
Integration 
The metric includes all relevant aspects of the process 
Economy
and promotes coordination across functions and divisions.
Compatibility
The beneﬁts of using the metric outweigh the costs of data
collection, analysis, and reporting.
Level of Detail
The metric provides a sufﬁcient degree of granularity or ag-
gregation for the user.
Behavioral 
The metric minimizes incentives for counter-productive

acts or game playing and is presented in a useful form.

Top Management Participation Is Critical
“It is essential to keep top management committed to the initiative,” insists
Milliken. At BASF, for instance, the following tactics ensure that manage-
ment’s attention is not diverted from the metrics initiative:
• Integrate operational metrics into ﬁnancial reporting. “You don’t want to
have one book for operational results and a separate one for ﬁnancials;
that gives the impression that operational results aren’t important,” he
argues.
• Include performance review at all staff meetings. “We do not want periodic
meetings to discuss performance measurements; it’s the worst thing
in the world to have a separate meeting,” Milliken insists. “By inte-
grating it into routine staff meetings, it sends a message that this is just
as important as anything else on the group VP’s plate.”
• Incorporate high-level metrics into management’s compensation objectives. “If
it doesn’t hit you in the pocket, it’s just not as important,” he notes.
“Since 1998, we’ve been successful in having several nonﬁnancial
measures, such as on-time delivery performance, begin to impact the
pay of our group vice presidents.”
• Include resources for the measurement process as line items in the annual bud-
geting process. “We have shown that measurements consume resources.
No matter how good a job we do, or how much we may restructure,
we need resources. So, it now gets done,” he says.
Performance Measures Reflect Strategy
Before Whirlpool instituted its metrics program, the company “took a step
back and asked, ‘What’s really important to us?’” Dittmann comments. “We
found it was four things.” He cites them as customer service, cost, working
capital, and cycle time.
“If that’s what is really important to us, certainly our measures have to
capture those elements,” he explains. “We then set up a series of overarch-
ing principles for our supply chain measures. This is what we’re going to
evaluate them by.” Among the factors are the following:
• The measures must be global. “We want the same supply chain measures
in all regions of the world,” Dittmann describes. “They would not be

used punitively but to establish a framework from which we can cre-
ate a dialogue and share best practices.”
• They must be interlinked to avoid suboptimization. If a measure for in-
ventory is established, there would be an offsetting metric on cus-
tomer service. “We don’t want to suboptimize one at the expense of
the other,” he explains.
• Measures must have an external link to economic value-added. “We’ve dis-
covered economic value-added is a measure that is the most direct
link to stock price growth,” he explains. “Basically, it combines into
one measure the balance sheet and income statement so you’re not
only looking at one dimension (income) without considering the as-
sets you’ve had to employ to generate that income,” Dittmann details.
• Metrics must be fully communicated and understood throughout the organiza-
tion. Dittmann and the others insist on this. “Unless that’s the case, it’s
all a waste of time,” Dittmann states. “Linkage is assurance that when
we meet our nonﬁnancial goals, our strategic and ﬁnancial goals are
met as well.”

In an environment where customers demand more value-added services, it
is important to measure value and costs. According to a recent Managing Lo-
gistics survey, however, only 25.3% of respondents say that benchmarking has
been successful in helping to control logistics costs in the past year.
Respondents to the survey identiﬁed ﬁve main areas that they bench-
mark and updated us with their progress so far (see Table I-1.1). Topics in-
clude inventory accuracy, inbound and outbound shipment accuracy, and
timeliness of inbound and outbound shipments.
For those who do benchmark, the results are something to brag about.
“We began an increased level of service measurement and warehouse pro-
ductivity measurements, both at the individual and total warehouse levels,”
explains the director of operations for a small wire and cable ﬁrm in New
York. “We have been able to reduce service complaints, which has also de-
creased our need for customer service staff.”
It is interesting to note, however, that the current benchmarks are
slightly lower than those in the year-earlier Managing Logistics survey. This
may be because newly implemented technologies are not used to their

Co., Whirlpool Corp., and Xerox have each undertaken a benchmarking
study and have experienced signiﬁcant logistics productivity improvements
as a result.
The case of Deere is of particular relevance, as the company set out to
right wrongs causing long replenishment cycles, a loss of market share, and,
ultimately, a loss in sales to the competition, explains Earl Brinkley, manager
of logistics planning, North America, for Deere.
He explains, “All of our inventory was committed prior to the selling
season with no inventory available to replenish unexpected sales.” This ulti-
mately led to a variance at the dealer and, if sales did not occur, to large un-
paid inventories. A visit to other companies that had solved similar problems
resulted in a new distribution system at Deere. 
First, the company implemented an automatic replenishment system or
perpetual ordering plan. Here, the dealer sets the desired inventory level and
can change that level at any time. On a set day each week, the system auto-
matically generates orders to bring inventory to the desired level. The dealer
can also override and order any quantity and can place orders for emergency
orders at any time. 
Second, Deere set up distribution activities in one central consolida-
tion center located in Streator, Ill. The factory produces to a predeter-
mined forecast with variable production quantities. All factory production
is moved to the Central Consolidation and Distribution Center (CCDC),
and all dealer orders are sourced from there. The CCDC, owned and op-
erated by a third party, charges customers based on space and units
shipped, but Deere does guarantee that all deliveries will be shipped the
next day.
The third improvement in Deere’s distribution network comes in the
form of a commitment to deliver within a maximum of seven calendar days,
from order entry to delivery. This is done by submitting bids to less-than-
truckload (LTL) carriers by region and notifying those carriers 24 hours in
advance of shipping. This focus on ﬁll rates, on-time shipments, error-free
deliveries, and dealer satisfaction has led to the virtual elimination of the
aforementioned headaches.
Key Steps in the Benchmark Process
Although the benchmarking process can vary from company to company,
some basic elements must occur in every study:
8
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

1. Identify a process to benchmark. For example, J. Paul Dittmann says that
the company focuses on four main areas: customer service, cost, working
capital, and cycle time.
2. Rank the measure. Dittmann says it was important for Whirlpool to
rank its processes according to the relevance they offer to all company
stakeholders, at all levels in the organization and in the entire supply
chain. Ranking the processes on a scale of 1 to 10 will give a good indi-
cation of which are most relevant and which should most actively be pur-
sued.
3. Identify the best in class for that process. Xerox benchmarked itself against
15 other companies in the areas of service, inventory, and supply chain costs
(see Figure I-1.1). “What we found was that no single company is best in all
three areas,” says Mike Wilding, customer supply assurance manager at Xe-
rox. “We can tell from the research that we are not best in class, but we sure
are close.”
4. Obtain customer feedback. Asking your customers to rate your perfor-
mance can generate valuable information. Xerox sent out a written ques-
tionnaire to its customers asking them to compare Xerox to its top com-
petitor in several areas: ability to keep commitments, ease of contact,
response to inquiry, ﬂexibility, product quality, and product reliability.
Four areas were identiﬁed as most important to customers: reliability, re-
sponsiveness, relationship, and value. “These areas now guide our metrics,”
says Wilding. “We know that customer satisfaction will help us retain, grow,
and add customers.”

5. Implement measures. Dittmann says that measures should be imple-
mented based on a combination of difﬁculty and value. For instance, al-
though trying to achieve the perfect order is important, it can be difﬁcult.
On the other hand, initiating a customer satisfaction survey is relatively
simple to carry out and also carries a much greater value.
6. Measure the results. Whirlpool has driven 15 days out of its cash-to-
cash cycle time, which Dittmann says equates to $12 million per day of
working capital that has been eliminated in the last year.
Xerox expects to see a 37% reduction in supply chain cost as a percent-
age of revenue and a 31% improvement in inventory as a percentage of rev-
enue. Overall savings are estimated to be $1 billion thanks to a reduction in
supply chain costs and a decrease in inventory.
All three logistics pros stress that although they have realized, or expect
to realize, dramatic results from their benchmarking strategies, such im-
provements start out slowly. “The curve is relatively ﬂat in the early going
but rises quite sharply when installations are further along,” says Dittmann.

New research from John Carroll University and West Virginia University
ﬁnds that despite many differences, what large and small companies have in
common is a dedication to transportation management issues. From an in-
depth analysis of 116 ﬁrms, they found the following ﬁve parallels. 
1. Small and large ﬁrms exhibit dissimilar patterns of modal usage for outbound
shipments. With respect to outbound shipments (Table I-1.2), three modal
forms—truckload motor carriage, parcel/express land, and railroad—ex-
hibit signiﬁcant differences between small and large ﬁrms. The strongest dif-
ference involves truckload motor carriage, in which nearly 50% of the large
ﬁrms’ outbound shipment volume moves by truckload (TL) carriers, com-
pared to slightly more than 20% by smaller ﬁrms.
Both groups rank the different types of motor carrier service—TL, LTL,
and parcel/express land—as the three most important modal forms for out-
bound shipments. Railroads are the fourth most popular outbound form
among large ﬁrms, compared to ninth most popular among small ﬁrms.
10
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

“Other,” consisting primarily of automobiles, ranks ﬁfth among small ﬁrms,
compared to tenth among large ﬁrms.
2. Small and large ﬁrms do not share similar patterns of modal usage for inbound
shipments. The information in Table I-1.3 indicates differences between
small and large companies in parcel/express air and railroad modes. Both
railroad and rail-truck intermodal are ranked higher by larger businesses.
However, regarding TL parcel/express land, both small and large ﬁrms rank
them ﬁrst and second. 
3. Small and large ﬁrms do not share similar inbound (shipment-origin) ship-
ping patterns. With respect to inbound shipments, small businesses are equally
likely to have shipment origins within their home state as to have them in

other U.S. states (see Table I-1.4). The most common shipment origin for
large companies, by contrast, is other U.S. states.
4. Small and large ﬁrms do not share similar outbound (shipment-destination)
shipping patterns. Small ﬁrms are more likely to ship to points located within
their home state, whereas large ﬁrms are most likely to ship to other U.S.
states (see Table I-1.4).
5. Small and large ﬁrms do not share similar usage of select logistical intermedi-
aries (e.g., international freight forwarders, transportation brokers). Study partici-
pants were asked to indicate current usage of ﬁve possible logistics interme-
diaries (Table I-1.5). Not one of the listed intermediaries is used by more
than 35% of the small ﬁrms. By contrast, four of the intermediaries are used
by at least 40% of the large businesses.
On average, large ﬁrms tend to use more than twice the number of in-
termediaries as do their smaller counterparts. In addition, large ﬁrms are
much more likely to employ the services of both international freight for-

popular intermediary among large ﬁrms, emerge as the third most popular
among small companies. On the other hand, transportation brokers are the
second most popular intermediary for small ﬁrms, compared to the fourth
most popular among large companies.
From this research, the hope is that both large and small ﬁrms will dis-
cover that an increased understanding of logistics management often trans-
lates into a competitive edge.

Data from the Warehousing Education and Research Council (WERC;
Oak Brook, Ill.; 630-990-0001; www.werc.org) ﬁnd that logistics managers
are effectively increasing inventory turnover. One reason for improvement
is the mandate by top management to reduce inventories.
Warehouse Inventory Turnover: Trends, Change Drivers, Measures, Using the
Data reports that, on average, managers increased inventory turns 30% from
1995 to 1998 and were expected to improve another 27% by 2000, despite
an increase in stock keeping units (SKUs), increased customer requests to re-
duce inventory, and marginal improvements in forecast accuracy.
The breakdown: Eighty-three percent report improving turnover be-
tween 1995 and 1998, whereas 17% experienced no change or a decline in
turns; 89% expected to improve turns between 1998 and 2000, whereas only
11% expected to see turns stay the same or decline. Firms whose turns im-
proved between 1995 and 1998 saw their inventory turnover increase by 38%,
whereas those whose turns declined witnessed a 12% decrease. The expected
increase by 2000 versus 1998 averages around 35%. Those expecting velocity
to diminish forecast declines of 10%. Average turns in 1995 were 7.6; these
ﬁrms projected that average turns would be 13.1 by 2000—an increase of 76%.
For ﬁrms whose turns decreased, top management paid considerably less
Benchmarking Logistics Performance
13

attention to inventory reduction than did management for ﬁrms whose turns
increased, highlighting the inﬂuence of top management on the behavior of
operating managers.
Manufacturers Show Better Turns
Manufacturers and wholesalers are the ﬁrms in the supply chain that have tra-
ditionally carried the heaviest inventory burden. On average, however, man-
ufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers have made positive changes in inventory
turns and expect improvements by 2000. Fewer retailers experienced an im-
provement in turns between 1995 and 1998 compared to their wholesaler
and manufacturer counterparts. Only 63% of the retailers indicated that turns
had increased since 1995. Wholesalers were the most optimistic in turns by
the year 2000, as 90% expected to improve turnover. Similarly, 83% of man-
ufacturers and 78% of retailers expected turns to increase by 2000.
Warehouse Combinations Pays Off
The survey indicates that goods ﬂowing through either private or a mixture
of private and third-party warehouses have higher inventory turns than do
goods moving through third-party operations alone (Figure I-1.2). How-
ever, ﬁrms whose products ﬂow only through third-party warehouses report
the largest percentage increase in turnover from 1995 to 2000—from 5 to
11 turns. The size of a warehouse does not impact inventory velocity (Fig-
14
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T
Figure I-1.2
Inventory Turns Based on Warehouse Type

ure I-1.3), although ﬁrms with over one million square feet anticipate higher
turnover rates than do smaller warehouses.
SKU Impact on Turn Rates
The data also suggest that the wider array of SKUs ﬂowing through facilities
(76% report an increase in SKUs from 1995 to 1998) has affected inventory
turns (Figure I-1.4). Turns are better when the number of SKUs is below
1,500. The averages for ﬁrms in this bracket were 10.9 in 1995, 14 in 1998,
and 17.1 expected by 2000. According to WERC, these data support the

theory that the negative impact of SKU proliferation on inventory velocity
increases and eventually levels off.
Food Companies Enjoy Highest Turns
Food companies and food retailers boast the greatest level of inventory
turnover. All food companies averaged 14 turns in 1995 and 17 in 1998 and
expected 20 in 2000. Conversely, companies in the automotive and repair
parts business and those in apparel and clothing report considerably lower
results. Hardware/tools and chemicals and consumer household products
tended to be on the low side as well, but paper, medical supplies, and con-
sumer electronics were average or above the overall averages of 8 in 1995,
10.4 in 1998, and 13.2 in 2000.
Changes Expected in 2000
According to the responses, software and inventory management tools were
estimated to have the most impact in turnover at the end of 2000 (16.2%).
Improved forecasting ranked third (10.7%), followed by reduced lead times
(15%) and supply chain management principles (9.6%). See Table I-1.6.

tics activities, few measure performance where it really counts. The problem is
that most logistics managers focus their measurement internally, on the perfor-
mance of warehousing, transportation, and other logistics activities. Alterna-
tively, the research team, from the University of Tennessee and Computer Sci-
ences Corporation, insists that metrics should be focused externally on the
customers and suppliers. “Logistics measurement itself has focused on moni-
toring the performance of individual logistics functions instead of tracking the
performance of end-to-end logistics processes,” the researchers observe.
Their research has been captured in an excellent resource, Keeping Score:
Measuring the Business Value of Logistics in the Supply Chain (Council of Lo-
gistics Management; CLM). It is a detailed reference and resource of con-
cepts, strategies, and methods for launching the “new” logistics metrics to
inspire greater supply chain collaboration efﬁciency.
Lessons Learned For Good Logistics Measurement
They are based on the successful logistics measurement programs of compa-
nies such as 3M, International Paper, Motorola, Welch’s, Tyson Foods,
Graybar, Texas Instruments, and Caliber Logistics. The critical lessons in-
clude the following:
• Ensure that logistics measures are in sync with strategy. Different business
strategies have different implications for logistics. For example, being
the low-cost provider means having efﬁcient logistics operations,
which can conﬂict with a strategy of providing tailored customer ser-
vice. Effective logistics measures help managers execute their com-
pany’s strategy.
• Truly understand customer needs. Do not assume that you know what
customers expect or that their needs will remain static. What is im-
portant today might not be critical tomorrow.
• Know your costs in providing logistics services. Deciding how much cus-
tomer service to offer and at what price requires comprehensive cost
measures. With this information, managers can do sophisticated cost-
beneﬁt analyses on different logistics-services scenarios.
• Take a “process” view of logistics. Logistics measures must be deﬁned
ﬁrst at the business process level—not the functional level—of an
organization. This means grouping all logistics activities into three
key processes: sourcing-procurement, fulﬁllment, and planning-
forecasting-scheduling-planning.
Benchmarking Logistics Performance
17

“The day when companies across a supply chain use the same
measures to monitor their combined performance will be the day
when order-of-magnitude improvements in logistics performance
across the supply chain will be truly possible,” the researchers insist.
However, most industries are not at the point of making this a reality
because there is little agreement today in any supply chain about how
to measure performance, the team notes. “Companies can start down
this road of supply chain improvement by instituting process mea-
sures with key customers and suppliers,” they insist.
• Focus only on key measures. Although there are hundreds of ways to
track logistics performance, about two dozen measures are important
(see Table I-1.7). These are process measures. They track overall per-
formance of sourcing/procurement and the fulﬁllment processes in
time, cost, and quality. Measures of logistics functions and activities
must be derived from these process measures.
• Stop ineffective measurement activities. Measures are ineffective when
they are subjective, when they obscure bad performance, and when

they provide misleading statistics. Many measures used today are sub-
jective. For example, rating a supplier’s on-time performance on a
scale of one to ﬁve without data on the percentage of deliveries that
arrive as promised is a subjective measure. To be useful, logistics mea-
sures must be objective. Customer surveys that average a company’s
performance across several measures such as on-time delivery, cycle
time, and accuracy make it difﬁcult to pinpoint problems. Further-
more statistics can be used to distort reality.
• Use information technology. Gathering, processing, and analyzing thou-
sands, even millions, of bits of information every day on logistics per-
formance require advanced information systems. Some organizations
do not capture the right information, however. Other companies
capture information differently in each business function or business
unit. Trading partners usually gather logistics information differently,
which makes it difﬁcult to compare logistics information. Fortu-
nately, as the research team points out, several major technology de-
velopments spell progress for logistics measurements. Supply chain
management systems, enterprise resource planning software, and data
warehouses are some of the solutions. Information technology rap-
idly is becoming a powerful tool for logistics measurement, the re-
search team concludes.
Instituting Effective Logistics Measurement
This study is valuable not only for its identiﬁcation and deﬁnition of effec-
tive process measures but also for its recommended methodology of im-
plementing them. To summarize, managers must ﬁrst assess the measures
already in place. The emphasis should be on identifying the measures them-
selves, and not on the performance level that those measures are indicating.
Managers must then develop process measures such as on-time delivery,
complete order cycle time, total delivered cost, and quality of product re-
ceived. The emphasis on the process measures will depend on the company’s
business strategy.
After prioritizing which process measures to develop ﬁrst, logistics man-
agers can build a prototype solution to test in the ﬁeld. This initial model
may lack data that will be required later. However, the prototype lets man-
agers work out the bugs before they make major investments in collecting
data and developing new information systems.
Benchmarking Logistics Performance
19

The measures are revised, sometimes several times, before they are
rolled out. Before they institute the measures, logistics managers must ed-
ucate employees on how to use them. They also must revise incentive sys-
tems so that old measures and reward systems do not impede the new mea-
sures.
Ten Characteristics of Good Measures
According to the council’s 10 basic characteristics of good logistics measures,
a measure
1. Is quantitative. The measure can be expressed as an objective value.
2. Is easy to understand. The measure conveys what it is measuring and
how it is derived.
3. Encourages appropriate behavior. The measure is balanced to reward
productive behavior and discourage game playing.

According to a recent Managing Logistics survey of logistics professionals,
benchmarking is quickly becoming a standard logistics practice primarily be-
cause it is a successful cost-cutting strategy. In the logistics/transportation in-
dustry, 45.5% use it as a cost-cutting tool: 26.5% in consumer manufactur-
ing and 23.6% in industrial manufacturing.
The push for quality improvements in overall products or services is an-
other incentive for benchmarking. Approximately 52.4% of respondents in-
dicate this as their motivation in a recent benchmarking study conducted by
the WERC. Establishing a management control process (43.5%) ranks as the
second most popular reason for benchmarking, followed by top manage-
ment requirements to reduce costs (34.3%).
The least compelling reason to benchmark was customer suggestion/
requirements, with less than 10% of the respondents reporting (see Table I-
1.8). Firms that rely on benchmarking state that better management controls
and improved standard warehouse operating procedures are the most com-
mon beneﬁts (see Table I-1.9).

Internal Benchmarks Are Most Popular
Companies that describe themselves as small compared to others in their in-
dustry are less likely to benchmark warehouse operations than are medium
or large companies. Further, companies in the automotive and pharmaceu-
tical/medical industries are more likely to benchmark operations, reporting
82.2% and 71.9%, respectively. The chemical industry was the least likely,
with only 26.3% responding.
For most of these companies, benchmarking involves primarily a com-
parison of internal operations. Approximately 60% of the individuals indi-
cated that a comparison of internal operations was the most popular bench-
marking technique, but it is less common for small ﬁrms than for their larger
counterparts.
Among respondents, 21.2% indicated that their ﬁrms regularly compare
their performances to similar functions in the same industry or to an indus-
try leader. Benchmarking of business functions across industries was re-
ported by 11.5% of respondents; the remaining 8.9% indicated a speciﬁc
competitor-to-competitor comparison by product or function.
Three Years Is the Magic Number
Smaller organizations seem less likely to benchmark and are more likely to
have started benchmarking later than are medium and large ﬁrms. According
to the survey, 20% of ﬁrms with less than 500 employees are benchmarking,
whereas 30% of ﬁrms with over 500 employees are using it as a tool.
Most individuals reported that their ﬁrms have been benchmarking
warehouse operations for three years or fewer (63.7%). However, 57% of all
responses were from individuals whose ﬁrms have been benchmarking for
between one and three years.
The WERC study reveals that only 20.6% of the small ﬁrms have been
benchmarking for more than three years compared to 36.3% of medium
ﬁrms and 43.5% of large ﬁrms. In addition, large companies are more than
twice as likely to have been benchmarking for over ﬁve years than are small
ﬁrms (27.8% vs. 13.2%).
Low Levels of Sophistication
Nearly 80% of respondents indicated a range of two to three on a five-
point scale (five being the best) when asked about the level of sophistica-
22

tion in benchmarking. The average rating was 2.51. Approximately 6.3%
considered their firms to be novice, whereas 2.1% rated their firms as ex-
pert.
Respondents in the automotive industry reported the highest level of
perceived sophistication. The top two mean ratings were 2.89 for the auto-
motive industry and 2.61 for the consumer goods sector. Respondents re-
porting from the chemical industry possess the lowest level of perceived so-
phistication, at 2.16.
What and How to Benchmark
No matter what the level of sophistication, the most common areas for
benchmarking are at the beginning, middle, and end of the warehousing pro-
cess. Receiving, order picking/packing, and shipping were the only func-
tional areas benchmarked by more than half of the respondents. As indicated
in Table I-1.10, the shipping function received the largest percentage, with
57.6% of the ﬁrms reporting.
The areas benchmarked were signiﬁcantly different depending on the
size of the ﬁrm. Medium and large ﬁrms reported benchmarking more
warehouse activities than smaller ﬁrms. Speciﬁcally, the medium and larger
ﬁrms were more likely to benchmark the entire warehouse process from re-
ceiving to putaway and storage, order picking and packing, shipping and re-
turns. Respondents from smaller ﬁrms indicated that shipping and receiving
were the two areas currently being benchmarked.
Over half (53.6%) of respondents indicated that they used real input to
real output as their measure for benchmarking. This is compared to 41.6%
using real output to standard and 29.9% measuring capacity used to total ca-
pacity available.

People and Technology Are Essential
For those having difﬁculties with benchmarking, resource issues (people and
technology) stand out as one of the top three obstacles by 59.6% of the re-
spondents and as the number one obstacle by 28.3% of all respondents. This far
outpaced time constraints, cited by 44% (13.6% reported this as the number one
obstacle), and insufﬁcient availability of benchmark data, which had a 39.4%
response rate (reported as the number one obstacle by 11.4% of respondents).
Other obstacles included lack of proper training, lack of top management sup-
port, and the fact that the company sees no value in benchmarking.
Benchmarking will, however, become increasingly common in ware-
house operations. Only 1.6% of the respondents indicated they would either
Determining Benchmarking Success
If you’re thinking about benchmarking your warehouse operations, ask your-
self the following questions and answer “yes,” “no,” or “don’t know.”
•
Is there currently a focus on the quality improvement process in your
company and warehouse?
•
Is benchmarking the correct quality strategy for your warehouse?
•
Do you have an idea of what needs to be benchmarked in the ware-
house operation?
•
Do you know what should be measured within the benchmarked
areas?
•
Is your benchmarking going to have an internal or external focus?
•
Do you have any ideas about with whom you should benchmark?
•
Do you know where to get the benchmark data required to effectively
measure activities?
•
Do you have an implementation plan for benchmarking?
•
Are there measures of success developed for the benchmarking pro-
gram?
•
Does your company possess the resources to manage an ongoing
benchmarking process?
If you answered “no” or “don’t know” to more than one of these questions,
the success rate for benchmarking is signiﬁcantly diminished.

not benchmark operations or discontinue it. Half of the respondents indi-
cated that they would expand operations (see Table I-1.11). 
Industries that expect the most benchmarking expansion are automo-
tive and industrial and ofﬁce products, with 58.8% and 57.3% expecting to
expand the practice, respectively. About 68% of responding companies cur-
rently benchmark, and nearly 50% said they plan to expand benchmarking
activities in the next two years. Fewer than 2% will not be benchmarking.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) help logistics managers track their pro-
gress against short-term goals and strategic plans. Because of the many ben-
eﬁts they bring to customer service, they are suddenly receiving increased
attention. With this in mind, Managing Logistics researched how well man-
agers have done on their KPIs. What it found was for the most part encour-
aging: Outbound on-time shipments increased from the previous year, as
did inventory accuracy (see Table I-1.12). However, there was one major
and troubling exception: The percentage of customer shipment complaints
more than doubled this year over last. The question is whether customers are
more likely to complain today or whether there actually is a growing prob-
lem. Whichever the case, customer service is at issue, and benchmarking can
uncover individual company service levels.
How and What to Measure
Although there are many supply chain processes to measure (see Table
I-1.13), customer service is perhaps the most critical. It is the most robust
indication that the enterprise’s internal business processes are working to

optimize the needs of the customer and the goals of the enterprise. The sur-
vey of logistics managers indicates that KPIs have helped them identify ob-
stacles attaining high customer service performance levels.
“We deﬁne and publish logistics key performance indicators to help us
understand what the customer issues are and what we need to do about
them,” says the logistics manager for a small company in Ohio. “We pre-
pared a complete logistics plan that was SMART [speciﬁc, measurable,
achievable, realistic, and time-phased],” says a director of logistics for an of-
ﬁce furniture manufacturer in Michigan. “This led to clear measures that
enable us to track customer service level performance.”
KPIs Are Windows to Customer Satisfaction
Logistics managers also tell us that they measure a series of KPIs to deter-
mine how well they are meeting customer satisfaction. These include per-
centage of shipments on time, percentage of outbound shipments on time,
inventory accuracy, percentage of outbound shipments with errors, and per-
centage of customers with shipment complaints. 
None of the managers is reporting high enough percentages (nearing

99.9%). In addition, according to the data, customer complaints have in-
creased at many companies, indicating that managers are either not relying
on enabling technology or not keeping on top of tracking performance. One
consumer products manufacturer found that line ﬁll (percentage of units or-
dered that shipped on time) was a contributing factor in several signiﬁcant
issues. Poor line ﬁll led to empty retail shelves and market share decline be-
cause consumers had branded alternatives available to them. Retailers were
reluctant to take new product listings because of missed promises on pre-
vious items. On-time shipment performance was reduced as orders were
held pending receipt of product, and order entry errors and delays led to

higher deductions from customers, resulting in a negative impact on proﬁts.
Developing and implementing customer-focused KPIs is now helping this
company turn the situation around.
A Customer Focus in Manufacturing
According to Roddy Martin, an analyst with AMR Research, Inc. (Boston;
617-542-6600), companies realize that logistics and manufacturing depart-
ments must work together to achieve high levels of customer satisfaction.
One leading global food manufacturer focuses on reducing “time and touch”
on the product as a basis of building responsiveness and agility. For example,
information about inventory replaces physical inventory, and accurate de-
mand and sales information allows the manufacturer to produce to meet mar-
ket need. Demand-driven product will help manufacturers make accurate
forecasts and alleviate problems with excess inventory and shortages.
The improved availability of information helps manufacturers execute
global consolidation strategies. Global manufacturers are implementing KPIs
based on optimization of global inventory, orders and materials. Consider
Nestle SA’s plan to implement mySAP.com as a standard across 233,000
global users in an attempt to harmonize Nestle’s global information technol-
ogy (IT) infrastructure within its global supply chain. This will allow an in-
tegrated global supply chain with KPIs that support processes that increase the
visibility of orders, inventory, and commodity purchases across the enterprise.
Why Measure Customer Service
Supply chain consultants at Dechert-Hampe & Co. (Mission Viejo, Calif.;
949-586-6868) believe that whatever KPIs you choose to measure, they
should complement your organizational goals and your customers’ goals. To
bring about the desired results, make sure you understand why you are
measuring customer service performance in the ﬁrst place.
• Measure to motivate: The act of measurement will improve the per-
formance of the process by directing the attention of management
and employees to the process. KPIs will motivate individuals to ex-
amine their contributions, take corrective action, and drive im-
provement.
• Measure to align: KPIs need to be based on customer requirements
that are established ﬁrst at the company level. Then they must be ﬁl-
28
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

tered down through the organization to areas in which employees
have a “line of sight” on the impact of their performance on the ob-
jective.
• Measure to improve: Business processes need constant reﬁnement to re-
ﬂect changing requirements. Thus, measurements should be estab-
lished to improve the output of a particular business process.
Implementation Considerations
Once you know which KPIs you will measure and understand the reasons
why you have chosen those particular metrics, consider the following:
• Data sources. Matching the appropriate data to your metric can be a
challenge. Often, the data required do not reside in the same system.
The various data sources should be identiﬁed and mixed and matched
for each metric.
• Data extractions. If queries are required from multiple systems and
databases, how the data are extracted and merged is a concern. Data-
base managers and functional leaders need to understand the data’s
source and composition.
• Data elements. There may be issues with the way in which transac-
tion-processing systems capture data versus the data elements that are
required for the measurements. Before you implement any measure-
ment, validate what data are available.
• Assigning responsibility. Will IT or a functional user be responsible for
generating reports to get the required information? Who will have
responsibility for converting data to formats for analysis? These re-
sponsibilities need to be clearly assigned and understood.
• Commitment. Both management and those directly responsible for
delivery against the metric must follow up on the measurement’s
message. By searching for root causes and then following up with ap-
propriate corrective action to implement solutions, you achieve sus-
tained metric improvement.
• Presentation. The metrics must be displayed in a simple, meaningful
way. Reformatting data into a graphical display is very important.
• Hierarchical approach. Measurements should exist at the enterprise level
and drill down to the other levels of the organization. Maintain a
Benchmarking Logistics Performance
29

line-of-sight relationship between the metric and the organizational
level’s ability to improve the metric.
• Appraisal and compensation. These activities should be tied to the met-
rics. This assures that all associates understand the importance of or-
ganization improvements and the evaluation of their own perfor-
mance.

It’s been banner times for inventory management. “Business logistics costs
were equal to 9.9% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), and investment
in inventory became much more efﬁcient than ever before,” reported
Robert V. Delaney, vice president of Cass Information Systems, a subsidiary
of Cass Commercial Corporation (Bridgeton, Mo.; www.cassinfo.com).
Commenting in the 11th Annual State of Logistics Report (cosponsored by
Cass Information Systems and ProLogis of Aurora, Colo.), he ventured that
the “growing use of the Internet and the trends in electronic commerce ap-
pear to be improving the visibility of inventory and its location within our
supply chains.”

Inventory-to-Sales Ratio Plummets to Record Low
Source: 11th Annual State of Logistics Report.

What a Difference a Year Makes 
“We were disappointed to report previously that the inventory-to-sales ra-
tio had been stuck in a band between 1.38 and 1.40 months of supply since
1996,” Delaney said. “We did not appear to be taking inventory out of the
system—merely shifting where inventory was held within the supply chain.”
Further, disappointment was registered with estimates that some 40% of
U.S. companies planned to stockpile items as part of their contingency plan-
ning.
Instead, the inventory-to-sales ratio steadily declined from 1.38 months
of supply in January to 1.32 months of supply at year-end (see Figure I-1.5).
Delaney also observed, “The ratio fell even further, to 1.31 months of
supply, in April of the next year.” These data are based on the revisions to
the National Income and Product Accounts by the U.S. Department of
Commerce (see sidebars).
“This was a record low in the history of the revised data,” he noted. To

Storm Clouds on the Inventory Horizon? 
The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Ad-
ministration has proposed revisions to its hours-of-service regulations that
could sap all of this current enthusiasm and send inventory levels spiraling. One
of the proposals would limit long-haul and regional drivers to no more than 12
hours on duty in a 24-hour workday, with 2-hour breaks. Also, the driver
would not be allowed to work for more than 60 hours in any workweek.
According to Robert V. Delaney of Cass Information Systems, who cal-
culated a “best efforts estimate” of new regulations, the following might be
the effects over a three-year period:
•
$50 billion increase in expenditures for trucking services, because as
many as 20% more trucks could be on the nation’s road system, with
the new regulations increasing costs by about $ .20 per pound
•
$100 billion of unneeded inventory, as the proposed regulations
would require additional safety stocks at each point of the supply chain
system, which could increase even higher with the ever-shortening
procurement cycles
•
$25 billion of additional inventory carrying cost
“This analysis reveals how transportation and inventory costs are integrated,”
Delaney concludes.

be sure, inventory investment did increase during the year. However, ac-
cording to the data, it moved at a slower rate than in the prior year, except
for the fourth quarter. “There may have been some stock building during
the fourth quarter among wholesalers, but we cannot overlook the surpris-
ingly strong level of sales,” he observed.
During the entire year covered in the report, inventories increased by
4.6%, but sales increased by 9.2%, or “twice as fast as inventory,” as Delaney
declared. “And we know that fourth quarter sales were so strong that they
powered quarterly GDP above 7%.”
A Deeper Look into the Statistics
Transportation consultant Rosalyn Wilson, president of R. Wilson, Inc.
(rosalyn@transopolis.com), revealed that the cost of the business logistics
system increased to $921 billion, or the equivalent of 9.9% of nominal GDP
(see Table I-1.14). The average investment in all business inventory in agri-
culture, mining, construction, services, manufacturing, wholesale, and retail
trade was $1,376 trillion.

Government Revises the Data: What It All Means
The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis has re-
sponded to data about information technology and productivity. A funda-
mental improvement is that business and government purchases of software,
as well as their internal production of software, will now be recognized as in-
vestment.
“With the beneﬁt of the comprehensive revision, we can now see that
our business logistics system was more productive than previously reported,”
Robert V. Delaney of Cass Information Systems maintains. The National In-
come and Product Accounts (which form the basis of Delaney’s Annual State
of Logistics analysis) have been revised back to 1959. Based on the revisions,
•
The value of nominal business inventory investment has been reduced
by about 3.0% annually.
•
The annual cost of business logistics in relation to nominal GDP has
been reduced by 0.3% to 0.5%.
The bottom line is that logistics costs were below Delaney’s target of 10%
on nominal GDP in 1993 (9.9%), and they dipped to that level once again in
the latest year. “We are encouraged,” he declared. “We may be able to main-
tain U.S. business logistics costs at the goal that we set in 1990—namely 10%,
or lower, of nominal GDP.”

The cost of carrying inventory includes interest at the annualized com-
mercial paper rate of 5.1%. The cost of taxes, obsolescence, depreciation,
and insurance follow the Alford-Bangs formula that is used in this method-
ology. Obsolescence accounts for nearly 40% of total inventory carrying cost
in this methodology.
“This is consistent with the challenges facing inventory managers in our
fast cycle procurement, just-in-time world,” Wilson observed. She further
reported the following:
• The trucking industry continues to dominate the business logistics
system with an 81.2% share of the nation’s freight bill, as trucking
costs increased by 5.9%.
• Railroad revenues increased by 1.0%.
• Water and oil pipeline services were ﬂat.
• Domestic airfreight revenues increased by 6%, and international air
freight revenues increased by 8%.
• Logistics administration is estimated at 4% of total logistics cost.
Since 1982 the improvements in inventory efﬁciency have been dra-
matic, according to Wilson, “as we replaced inventory with more versatile
and responsive transportation services.” However, she cautioned, “We will
be challenged to keep transportation costs stable at 6.0% of GDP as we have
for the past seven years. Inventory management will be the key to maintain-
ing business logistics costs at 10%, or lower, of nominal GDP.”
Demand for Warehousing Services to Continue Even 
with Improvements in Inventory Efficiency
Delaney countered the investment analysts’ traditional assumption that more
efﬁcient management of inventory will reduce the demand for warehousing
services. “That is not the case, and never has been,” he declared. Even
though it is more efﬁcient, Delaney explains, “inventory investment comes
into the economy quarter after quarter, and it has to be warehoused.” In fact,
the annual increase in square footage of warehouse space has been increas-
ing steadily since 1996, following a slump in the early 1990s.
Services Performed within the Warehouse Are Changing
In addition to storage, handling, and inventory management, warehousing
companies are assembling products, organizing kits, bar coding, labeling,
and providing a range of other value-added services.

“Warehousing companies are even providing fulﬁllment services to sup-
port the requirements of e-commerce companies,” he notes. “Despite the
improvements in inventory management, we believe that the demand for
warehousing services will continue to grow consistent with industrial pro-
duction and consumer spending,” Delaney projects. “Logistics decision
makers will continue to make changes reﬂecting trends in automation, fa-
vorable locations, building design, operating methods, and procedures. And,
it will all happen faster and with greater visibility because of the Internet and
e-commerce,” Delaney declares.

In today’s supply chain environment, the primary focus is on performance
metrics. However, the discussion is often long on what to measure but short
on the rationale for selecting a speciﬁc measure. That’s why it’s refreshing—
and informative—to hear from industry leaders who do focus on deﬁning
meaningful and useful measures. For example, Dennis Dreyer, director of
logistics and service parts operation at General Motors (Grand Blanc, Mich.;
812-606-4215) acknowledges, “When we look at a measure, the ﬁrst ques-
tion we ask ourselves is: ‘What really is a meaningful measure, and what el-
ement am I looking for in it?’”
J. Paul Dittman similarly declares, “When we think about setting stan-
dards to judge our performance metrics, we insist that they have to capture
the elements of what’s really important to us, and reﬂect our global supply
chain strategy.” To get a ﬁx on Dreyer’s and Dittman’s thinking, we caught
up with both at recent conferences. 
Whirlpool’s “Overarching Principles”
“We set up a series of overarching principles for our supply chain measures,”
Dittman explained at the Proven Performance Metrics in Logistics Confer-
ence (Institute for International Research, New York; www.iir-ny.com). Es-
sentially, each proposed measure has to conform to the following before be-
ing implemented:
• Globally common measures to facilitate sharing of best practices (i.e., to
have the same supply chain measures in all regions of the world to set up
a common framework for a common dialog to share best practices)

• Interlinkage to avoid suboptimization (i.e., if a measure is created for
inventory, an offsetting one is established for customer service to
maintain balance)
• External linkage to economic value-added metric (i.e., it combines
balance sheet and income statement in one measure to avoid being
one-dimensional)
• A focus on assets, cost, quality (customer service), and cycle time
• Common-shared measures across all functions
• Full communication and understanding throughout the organization
(e.g., “if not done, it’s all a waste of time,” as Dittman asserts)
General Motor’s Meaningful Metrics
Dreyer insists that most of the measures have been around for a long time
and that they do not fundamentally change (see sidebar). “You can put these
measures into three categories, cost, quality and speed,” he itemized at an
Interlog conference (Worldwide Business Research, New York; www.
wbresearch.com).

“When we look at a process, we want to make sure that we understand
the cost, the speed, and the quality issues within a particular piece of the
supply chain network.” To accomplish this, Dreyer outlined their approach:
• Timeliness of the data. This is one of the ﬁrst considerations. The ques-
tion under deliberation is “What really is the timely way to look at
the speciﬁc data?” In explanation, he recalls that when he ﬁrst started
in service parts the ﬁnancial people would provide him with a report
at the end of the quarter to tell him how he did. “Now, we can pick
up this information monthly, weekly, or daily,” Dreyer explains.
“This certainly changes our ability to look at our business.”
• What do the data support? Do they support a strategic, tactical, or op-
erational issue? “We may be talking about the same issue, but we may
need to look at it from three different perspectives and time frames,”
he says. When considering the strategic versus the tactical and oper-
ational measures, the difference is related to time. For example, when
discussing strategic metrics, Dreyer is referring to monitoring trends.
“When we get down to the tactical and operational measures, we’re
looking at a more current type of information,” he explains. 
• Provide data with sufﬁcient amount of detail. Technology is allowing end
users to drill down further and further for information. “What we
need to do is look at the highest level and ask how far do I want to
drill down on a regular and timely basis,” says Dreyer. However, he
reﬂects, “I may still need access to that ﬁner detail in case I want to
answer a question that I may have, or to provide information to
someone else who raises a question.”
• Relevancy of the data and the problem with ﬁnancial-oriented metrics. “Typ-
ically, we’ve looked at things the way accountants have told us to look
at them,” Dreyer mentions. “Now we’re looking at our measures
with a logistics focus, and there’s a difference between a ﬁnancial per-
spective and a logistical one.”
According to Ted Farris of the University of North Texas (Denton,
Texas; 940-565-4368), “The key advantage to using nonﬁnancial measure-
ments, such as those now being used by logisticians, is that they are directly
traceable to success factors and strategies. These are often hidden through
the agglomeration of reporting areas on ﬁnancial reports.” However, in-
ventory managers must recognize that the greatest downside to the use of
Benchmarking Logistics Performance
37

nonﬁnancial measures is that they don’t directly translate to proﬁts and the
bottom line.
“Nonﬁnancial measures may conﬂict with ﬁnancial performance mea-
sures during the short-run,” Farris declares. This, in turn, could make it dif-
ﬁcult to implement an improvement without having support of a direct ﬁ-
nancial beneﬁt (see sidebar).
Whirlpool’s Dittman agrees: “The ﬁnancial beneﬁts from what we do
in logistics accrue in a nonlinear, nontraditional, intricate-to-predict man-
ner. The curve is relatively ﬂat in the early going, but it rises quite sharply
when the installation is further along.” He too observes that “most tradi-
tional accounting systems cannot be used to predict the impact of world-
class logistics on costs. In fact, many traditional accounting systems can ac-
tually work to prevent adoption of the concepts,” he charges.
In conclusion, Dittman explains, “Build a framework by which you can
judge the performance metrics ﬁrst; don’t just throw them out there to be
used.”

The Criteria for Effective Measurements
Ted Farris of the University of North Texas (Denton, Texas; 940-565-4368)
recommends the following criteria for evaluating an effective measure:
•
Validity. Does the measure track the true customer requirements or
real productivity?
•
Coverage. Does the measure track all of the relevant factors?
•
Comparability. Can the measure be compared across time or indiffer-
ent locations?
•
Completeness. Are all-important sources that yield an output tracked
by the measure?
•
Usefulness. Does the measure guide action?
•
Compatibility. Is the measure compatible with existing data and infor-
mation ﬂow?
•
Cost effectiveness. What are the tradeoffs between the cost of measure-
ment and the potential beneﬁts to be gained?
“Also avoid overmeasuring as a means of managing,” he advised at the
Council of Logistics Management Annual Conference. “Instead, focus on a
limited set of high-impact measures.”

Although high-tech solutions to protect merchandise shipments are increas-
ingly feasible, they are not the quickest or cheapest strategy. In fact, even the
most sophisticated cargo tracking systems attack only 15% of the problem,
according to Louis Tyska, managing director for Pinkerton Consulting and
Investigations Services.
Speaking on the topic of high value logistics and global supply chain
protection, Tyska told logistics managers that sophisticated access control
and shipment tracking systems are a viable option, but that they take aim at
large-scale theft, which is not the biggest problem.
Shipment hijack and after-hours burglary make up a small percentage
of the goods that never make it to their ﬁnal destination. In fact, an over-
whelming portion of all shrinkage—85%—comes from old-fashioned pil-
ferage. “It’s basic. When somebody is touching merchandise, somebody is
going to develop a conspiracy to steal,” says Tyska. And to attack that type of
theft, there are better ways to protect an investment than by tagging ship-
ments for satellite tracking.
Eliminate the Confusion
How do crooks get away with lifting merchandise in shipping and receiving
(S&R) areas? First and foremost, they take advantage of the confusion that
is inherent at S&R bays. Tyska cites these 10 ways to regain at least some
control:
39

1. Separate shipping and receiving. It’s the most practical solution to cut
confusion, says Tyska, but it also requires local management commitment.
2. Develop a chart identifying cargo ﬂow. Looking at a ﬂow chart will help
you identify risks and the points at which people are exposed to the process
(and at which you are at a risk for loss).
3. Get your hands on controller letters. These are company documents that
report on the state of your business and track losses, damages, and claims.
CFOs have them, and you need them, too. The only way to cut cargo theft
is to know what theft is going on, and auditors frequently have records that
they do not readily share. Other sources of information that can help you
understand the threat you face include the following:
• Local authorities. They will have an understanding of what warehouse
items are hot on the local market.
• Risk managers. Whenever you go above a certain level of loss, other
people in your company are tracking it.
• Manufacturing. If they are being slowed in production because parts
haven’t arrived, that can alert you to small amounts of cargo theft that
you might not otherwise be able to track.
4. Conduct director-to-security background veriﬁcations. “Passing the gar-
bage” is common in trucking, and laws protecting teamsters make it difﬁcult
to uncover the handling of your shipments by unscrupulous drivers. “HR
[human resources] to HR doesn’t get it done,” says Tyska.
5. Improve housekeeping. Broken cartons, debris, and piles of cardboard
add to the confusion that thieves use as cover. Try shrink-wrapping or band-
ing cartons to reduce casual theft of small amounts of merchandise.
6. Provide a secure area for high-value goods. Separate them from the less
valuable merchandise that moves through your S&R areas. If warehouse
managers tell you, “It’s all valuable,” use that ammunition to enforce stricter
controls all around.
7. Provide a driver waiting room. If you don’t, “they’ll wander your cargo
exchange area and shop,” says Tyska. If a room is not feasible, paint a line that
drivers are not allowed to cross.
8. Ensure that perimeter controls are used. This means keeping cargo doors
closed when you are not actively receiving. If employees need the doors
open for air, purchase drop-down chain gates.
9. Tighten receiving controls. Use an inbound register that requires the fol-
lowing information: carrier’s name and truck number, driver’s name, com-
40
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

modity and quantity, date and time of arrival, and inspection veriﬁcation.
Keeping this record on ﬁle will help your team conduct an investigation in
the event of theft.
10. Investigate how documentation is handled. No cargo should move with-
out documentation, even if it’s being shifted within the warehouse itself. In
addition, make sure that documentation is complete and always signed in
ink.
Although these steps should come ﬁrst, some cargo is valuable enough
that it needs constant tracking. For a primer on the option of a satellite track-
and-trace system, see the accompanying sidebar.

How to Make Satellite Tracking an Effective Tool
Some transportation and logistics managers oversee the transport of merchan-
dise that is so valuable that a satellite tracking system may be part of the loss
control solution. 
The Basics of a Track-and-Trace System
1. A device (usually referred to as a global positioning system, or GPS) is
placed in a truck or ship and is capable of making a ﬁx of its position using
satellite signals.
2. The ﬁx is then transmitted through a mobile/cellular communication
device to a central station.
3. The central station is equipped with hardware and software that en-
ables it to identify where the subject is on a detailed digitized map (the accu-
racy should be less than 5 meters).
4. If the line of communication remains open, a new ﬁx will be provided
every 5 to 10 seconds. This makes it possible to check the speed, direction,
and behavior of the vehicle being tracked. Depending on the received signal
and the type of alarm or emergency, the central station will follow procedures
that were previously agreed upon.
Developing an Effective Track-and-Trace System
1. The black box. This is the unit that contains all the devices for positions,
communications, and connections to inputs and outputs. Options
include
(continued)

42
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T
•
A connection to the vehicle’s alarm system.
•
A panic button that allows the driver to generate a signal in an
emergency.
•
Digital ports that can be used to action any number of signals to
the vehicle, such as locking doors, closing windows, activating
sirens, lights or signals, reduce fuel, and so on.
•
Analog ports that are used to connect to analog information, such
as engine temperature, oil pressure, and trailer temperature. This
is helpful in instances of temperature-sensitive cargo.
2. The network of service stations. Make sure your system provider
•
Guarantees that they can position, maintain, and repair devices in
any location in which your vehicle or cargo will travel in the global
logistics system
•
Does not disturb the logistics processes of your company
•
Signs agreements to safeguard your company’s integrity
•
Offers adequate training and instruction to staff
3. The central monitoring station. It needs to track and trace signals 24 hours
a day, throughout the year, and can be organized in one of three ways:
•
Corporate control without third parties. Use when needed to protect
sensitive freight if you have the infrastructure to integrate into an
existing control station. Before you do, consider national/state
standards for control stations; stafﬁng required for all-hours repair;
legal issues related to mistakes; cost of purchasing software, hard-
ware, and digital maps; and staff required to upload or download
from the system.
•
Split functionality. This is the most common setup for the GPS. The
security monitoring station handles all signals coming from the
track-and-trace device according to agreed-upon procedures.
Firms have a mirror system enabling them to track and trace ve-
hicles, to use the system for logistics, such as route planning, and
to exchange data, such as downloading bar code readers.
•
Outsourcing. All central station activities are outsourced to a private
security monitoring station, an option for companies with a lim-
ited number of devices that require bottom line functionality.
Monitoring stations inform companies of an activated alarm or
panic button for the company to address at its convenience.

Imagine what you would save if your distribution resources were always in
the right place at the right time. Unfortunately, improving your distribution
network requires a thorough understanding of your customers, your prod-
ucts, and your business strategy. Chris Munro, senior vice president of Exel
Logistics, shared his four steps toward optimization with attendees at a re-
cent Logicon conference.
1. Understand your customers’ business requirements. Munro says that the
ﬁrst step toward optimization is to know what values you provide your cus-
tomers and which they consider most important. In other words, why do
your customers buy products from you? Some values to consider are the ser-
vice you offer, the range of product selection, your price, and how unique
your products are compared to others in the marketplace.
Part of understanding customers’ business requirements is anticipating
their future needs. Are they changing their order proﬁles, wanting smaller,
more-frequent orders, customer-speciﬁc labeling, or promotional packag-
ing and displays? Do they demand that you improve your information sys-
tems, or are they looking for you to provide electronic commerce? Will your
future acquisitions plans impact how you service your customers in the fu-
ture? “The opportunity for logistics to add value increases with the com-
plexity of customer requirements,” says Munro.
2. Generalize logistics ﬂow into segments. There are basically three ways to
segment your business: by product type, by customer type, and by order
type. If your business is broken out by product type, for example, you prob-
ably focus on stock keeping unit (SKU) velocity or product families. If your
organization is customer-focused, however, it may make logistics decisions
based on number of customers or on their location or type of industry. Com-
panies organized by type of order make decisions around transportation
modes, sizes of the orders, and their priority status. Munro recommends
looking at each segment individually as well as looking for similarities to see
if any logistics activities that are required to carry out decisions overlap.
3. Create a strategy for each segment; overlay and compare networks. Based on
information gathered in Step 2, you will discover ways to reduce costs, im-
prove service, and address customer requirements in the most efﬁcient way.
4. Create groups of logistics channels. Munro deﬁnes a logistics channel as
the portion of a logistics network that adds value by making products avail-
Distribution
43

able in the way that customers demand them. Different parts of the busi-
ness—customers, products, and orders—require different logistics chan-
nels. “The overall goal of logistics channels is to ﬁgure out a way to meet the
majority of your customers’ needs without having to mass-customize on a
customer-by-customer basis.”
A Case Study in Optimization
Using the four steps just described, Munro relates the case study of a multi-
divisional company organized by product type. The company decided to
optimize the distribution network that supplies parts for repair work. The
ﬁrm offers around 140,000 SKUs and strives to ensure next-day delivery
for critical parts and timely delivery for other parts. All parts are stored and
supplied by one distribution center (DC) in California to 12 regional hubs
across the country. Although it was easy to manage one DC, risks were as-
sociated with that single-source network: Using air parcel 100% of the time
was costly; having all inventory in one facility could have led to inventory
loss; and regional hub inventories represented redundant safety stocks, driv-
ing up inventory carrying costs.
Experts devised a strategy for each segment in the repair division—
PC/printer parts, electronic parts, medical equipment, server parts, and test-
ing equipment—and determined the logistics activities required to carry out
the service requirements in each. When the segments were compared, sim-
ilarities were discovered, such as the fact that ﬂexibility was necessary to
carry out the logistics ﬂow of the product segments consisting of electronic
parts, medical equipment, and testing equipment (see Table I-2.1).

Note: The company in the Exel case study compared its various product segments to determine whether
any logistics similarities existed. From the data in the table it became clear that repair segments for elec-
tronics, medical equipment, and testing equipment parts require a high degree of ﬂexibility in meeting the
customer demands. In addition, the majority of the product segments require three-day delivery windows,
so it was decided that ground transportation could be negotiated instead of the prior use of air parcel. 

They decided to provide next-day service to server parts customers, to
minimize inventory carrying costs by centralizing high-value server SKUs,
to ensure high ﬁll rates for medical/testing/electronics parts customers, and
to reduce freight expense for PC and printer delivery by two-thirds using
ground instead of air parcel delivery.
Munro says that optimizing the distribution network will affect your
business at the customer, strategic, ﬁnancial, and internal levels. The best
way to quantify the impact is to use modeling software to address the differ-
ent variables at once. “You need to truly understand the relationships be-
tween the various components to determine where you make your invest-
ments,” says Munro.

The unique characteristics of small packages present new and different chal-
lenges for transportation and logistics professionals. Moreover, the need for
in-depth knowledge of the parcel environment is ampliﬁed by the trend of
just-in-time inventory, as well as smaller, more frequent shipments. To help
prepare logisticians to manage parcel transportation, Joe Sudar, executive
vice president with SmartTran (Pittsburgh, Pa.; 724-934-0626) and a pre-
senter at a Council of Logistics Management (CLM) annual meeting, out-
lines how this market works.
Pricing Isn’t Competitive
Unlike the LTL or TL industries, in which there are many players and pric-
ing is based on competition, small package shippers are members of a small
niche. Typically, there are only two ground carriers: United Parcel Service
(UPS) and the FDX subsidiary of Roadway Package Service (RPS). As a re-
sult, there is not as much competition among the carriers, so their pricing
structure is not as competitively priced as is that of the LTL industry.
However, parcel carriers can offer greater discounts and have more lee-
way in offering discounts to the shipper. “We understand what it costs the
carrier to handle a particular shipper’s business and help the shipper deter-
mine that cost,” says Sudar. “This gives the shipper increased leverage in
pricing negotiations, instead of the carrier coming to the negotiating table
with only their number.”
Although volume can play a part in the cost of a parcel shipment, other
cost drivers go into making the ﬁnal pricing determination. For instance,
parcel characteristics, such as its physical dimensions, its destination, and
how many packages the carrier is picking up and delivering, all come under
consideration.
Don’t Set Yourself Up
Understanding the cost drivers that will help you set up a mutually beneﬁ-
cial contract with your parcel carrier, says Scott McLean, trafﬁc manager at
Hallmark Cards, Inc. (Liberty, Mo.), and Sudar’s copresenter at CLM. Hall-
mark relies heavily on parcel carriers to deliver large volumes of shipments
to its retail stores, as well as to mass merchants like Wal-Mart. McLean says
54
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

that negotiating a parcel carrier contract can be very different from the LTL
and TL contracts with which many more managers are familiar.
In addition to understanding the cost drivers, McLean recommends es-
tablishing longer-term contracts with the carriers, as opposed to the typical
contract that only maintains pricing for one year.
Manage Through Knowledge
“We choose to do business with carriers that truly try to understand our
business,” says McLean. Hallmark purchases its parcel delivery services from
both UPS and RPS and has worked closely with both to form a strategic al-
liance. “We know where each has the strengths to address our business
needs,” he says.
McLean also advises that logistics professionals take some time to un-
derstand how their business impacts the carrier. Finally, he recommends that
you don’t rely on the carrier to provide all the information you need to make
the most informed delivery decision: “I see too many of my counterparts re-
lying on what the carrier tells them, but I prefer to gather information on
my own and draw my own conclusions. This has helped Hallmark build a
more meaningful distribution network.” 
Your Customers Benefit as Well
Because the parcel shipping industry has fewer carriers than the LTL envi-
ronment, shippers are able to establish solid relationships with each carrier
in their network. This niche industry also enables the carriers to distinguish
themselves from their competition and work more closely with the shipper
to solve individual problems. “As a result, we are able to offer our customers
better service that they might not get from our competitors,” says McLean.
And if your company is among the growing group looking to ship di-
rect to consumers, parcel carriers may in the future reﬁne their services for
that segment of the business. For example, although most parcel deliveries
currently occur at residences between the hours of 8 .. and 5 .., when
most consumers are working, the carriers may soon offer expanded service
hours, in the evening, when more people are home. “This is being driven
by both the customer and the shipper,” says McLean.
Finally, as global distribution becomes more prevalent and your ﬁrm ex-
pands its overseas network, small package carriers will make a dent in this
arena in the near future.

Designing a DC network can be a painstaking process. To help logistics
managers travel this path, we recently spoke with several managers who re-
vamped their networks to accommodate customer demand and gained a
competitive edge in the process. From their experiences, we present these
eight hard-won tips to site selection.
1. Deﬁne on-time standards. The DC network must deliver products to
customers according to their standards of timeliness, says Gene Marino, vice
president of national accounts for GATX Logistics, Inc., of Tampa, Fla.
(www.gatxlogistics.com). 
2. Rank distribution markets. The two most important criteria for distri-
bution markets are proximity to customers and the quality of transportation
providers. Other factors to consider include the cost of serving customers
from a particular market, the quality of the workforce in a particular market,
and the quality of a market’s intermodal infrastructure.
3. Determine the optimum size of your DC network. If yours is a regional
business, a single DC may be all you need to keep customers well supplied.
However, serving a national or international customer base will probably go
56
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

beyond the capabilities of a single DC. Consider satellite locations in mar-
kets such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Dallas. Then, if the nature
of your business requires local distribution capability, you may also consider
smaller DCs in secondary markets such as Seattle, Charlotte, or Tampa.
Depending on the nature of your products and the requirements of your
customers, your DC network may consist of two or three large (700,000 sq.
ft. to 1 million sq. ft.) facilities, or one large DC that supports a number of
smaller (20,000 sq. ft. to 50,000 sq. ft.) facilities.
4. Compare available facilities. After you determine the size of each DC
and the markets in which they’ll be located, the site selection process comes
down to searching for and comparing individual facilities. Here are some of
the most important criteria:
• easy access to major roadways
• proximity to parcel carrier hubs
• proximity to other modes of transportation
• clean, well-sealed environment to ﬁlter out dust
• climate control for temperature-sensitive products
5. Compare costs. “Too many decision makers commit the mistake of al-
lowing a seemingly good price get in the way of good judgment,” says
Marino. “They automatically assume that the lowest rent equals the lowest
cost, and that’s not necessarily so.” Marino says it is common to choose a lo-
cation in a less expensive, more remote area of town without factoring in the
cost for additional transportation. “In order to ﬁnd the DC that is truly the
most cost-effective,” he says, “you must be sure to look at the big picture
while factoring in all the potential costs and beneﬁts.”
6. Consider information systems. Many site selection software packages
enable a company to pinpoint its optimum distribution markets based on its
preferences, performance standards, and budget parameters. In addition,
they allow managers to compare any number of scenarios, such as a two-DC
network versus a three-DC network, or a primary market location versus a
secondary market. “Computer systems and software have signiﬁcantly af-
fected how and why professionals choose certain distribution sites,” says
David Poitevint, manager of marketing research and analysis for GATX
(904-858-4406). “These technologies have made the process easier, en-
abling logistics site selection professionals to do a considerable amount of
legwork right at the computer terminal.”
Here are some ways that information systems can help logistic managers:
Distribution
57

• Position centers in ideal locations. Information systems have raised the bar
regarding on-time logistics performance. “This puts a huge burden on the
outbound logistics process because unlike data, products can’t move via cy-
berspace,” Poitevint notes. “They still have to move via truck, plane, train,
or ship.”
Although logistics professionals can’t change how fast these transpor-
tation modes move, more are looking to improve products’ speed-to-
customer by strategically locating their logistics centers in places that will en-
able them to reach their customer base within one or two days. The concept
is simple: “Position centers in such a way that even a last-minute order can
be in a customer’s hands before he can even think about buying product else-
where,” says Poitevint.
• Keep track of products to reduce stockouts. Information systems have also
enabled logistics professionals to keep a better handle on inventory and raw
materials and, as a result, to have a higher conﬁdence level that materials will
be where they need to be when they need to be there. Thus, the need to
stockpile extra product has been reduced.
• Improve decision making. Recent statistics state that the average com-
pany operates four DCs ranging between 124,000 sq. ft. and 136,000 sq. ft.,
but there is no general rule of thumb for exactly how many centers compa-
nies should operate. Using data on a company’s shipping requirements,
manufacturing points, and customer locations, software programs can help
compare distribution networks of various sizes.
Other software programs create highly detailed facility blueprints so that
companies can ﬁgure out how their DCs should be designed, laid out, and
equipped.
Systems have also made sticker shock far less common. Although logis-
tics professionals have always been able to make fairly accurate ballpark pro-
jections about what potential facilities will cost, various electronic spread-
sheet packages now offer precise line-item detail about proposed operations.
These spreadsheets are particularly helpful because they cover the total cost
of running a facility. Companies also get a more realistic view of how long
it will take them to get a center up and running.
7. Be willing to compromise. In large markets such as Atlanta, Dallas, and
Los Angeles, where large-size facilities are in great demand, the distribution
market is very competitive. In this case, Marino suggests three options: con-
tinue to search for sites in other comparable markets, build your own facil-
ity, or hire a logistics design consultant who can make the best of a less-than-
perfect facility in a good location.
58
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

8. Be ready to go through the whole exercise again and again. Creating efﬁ-
ciencies in procurement and distribution to produce the total lowest cost to
customers is a continuous process. “Tomorrow’s customer-focused supplier
will be able to deliver small runs of a few hundred units while maintaining
the capability to ramp up to mass production if demand takes off,” says
Marino. “And their distribution network must reﬂect that same ﬂexibility.
For this reason, many logistics folks must reevaluate their DC network
whenever new products enter or obsolete products depart the pipeline.”
Trends Changing Site Selection
So much is changing in logistics that companies would be remiss if they did
not revisit the issue of site selection quite frequently, advises Marino. One of
the ﬁrst trends changing warehousing site selection is consolidation. As a re-
sult, the location of these facilities has become more critical. Each must of-
fer quick access to large segments of suppliers or customers.
Globalization has also had an effect on site selection. Port cities such as
Seattle and Los Angeles for Asia and Miami for Latin America are becoming
more logical warehousing sites. 
Marino says that the most inﬂuential trend shaping site selection is the
billions of dollars worth of purchases made over the Internet. Not only does
this change the way society buys products, but it also changes the way busi-
nesses distribute them. It will also change both the size of typical orders and
the way those orders are ﬁlled. 
Instead of using TL or LTL delivery methods, both of which rely on
high-volume shipments, more products will travel part of the way via small
parcel delivery services. This could make proximity to parcel consolidators’
hubs a vital site selection issue.

It is not uncommon for logistics providers to experience trafﬁc jams on their
loading docks. Third-party providers, their customers, and even their cus-
tomers’ customers often pull up at the same time to load products that will
be delivered to the same destination. Besides the physical delays of gridlock,
this can cause duplications in the supply chain and therefore unnecessary
costs.
“We knew there had to be a better way to ﬂow product through the
Distribution
59

supply chain, but the question was how,” said Ryan Donovan, director busi-
ness development for third-party provider ServiceCraft Corp. (Buena Park,
Calif.; 714-994-0821), at a recent CLM annual meeting.
The answer was a multivendor consolidation program. By shipping sim-
ilar products of LTL quantity on the same truck, it brings manufacturers and
third parties together to ensure a clean ﬂow of product. “One point to make
is that multivendor consolidation programs require critical mass to create
truckloads of multiple vendor product,” says Donovan.
ServiceCraft already had that critical mass built into its operation; 25 out
of the 60 manufacturers it serves are in the grocery and consumer goods
business, shipping to the same retailers and distributors. This made it easy for
the third-party logistics provider (3PL) to develop its multivendor consoli-
dation program called SCORE (“shipping consolidated orders for replen-
ishment efﬁciencies”) in 1996.
LTL Deliveries at TL Prices
SCORE was the result of several conversations between ServiceCraft and
the retailers to which it delivers. “We realized that a single common carrier
could be used for the 25 manufacturers,” says Donovan. “Ultimately, the re-
tailers get truckloads worth of LTL product delivered to their facilities at
truckload prices.” In addition, the retailers would no longer have to worry
about maximizing transportation or minimum order requirements placed on
them by manufacturers, he adds.
Lead Times Reduced by Days
Prior to SCORE, Donovan says, retail and distributor purchase orders were
sent to the manufacturer, who in turn sent a copy to ServiceCraft. Service-
Craft then contacted the recipient to schedule delivery appointments. “The
whole process, from the time the purchase order was received to ﬁnal deliv-
ery, took 11 days.”
Using SCORE, the distributor creates a purchase order (PO) and sends
it to the manufacturer as well as to ServiceCraft. “We now have several days
lead time to allocate labor to handle the order, set up the trucks, and con-
solidate the product,” says Donovan. “We also have standing appointments
with the retailers. The total lead time is now only three days.” He adds that
all of the orders can be customized for the retailer as they are pulled off the
shelf.

Benefits to ServiceCraft
Donovan says that since incorporating SCORE, the 3PL has increased in-
ventory turns 50% (11 days to 3 days) and reduced inventory levels by 45%.
On-time delivery has reached 100%, and case ﬁll levels are above 95%. Un-
load times have decreased from 5 hours to 1.2 hours at the delivery dock,
and ServiceCraft is saving $293 per load.
Other tangible benefits are the elimination of delivery date discrep-
ancies, reduced safety stock, reduced shipping costs, decreased adminis-
tration costs, increased productivity, and the elimination of lumpers on
the dock. All in all, the numbers show a reduction of pounds shipped,
from 714 before SCORE to 695 after SCORE. Total loads went from 58
to 24; average weight went from 12,000 pounds to 28,000 pounds; or-
ders per load increased from 1.3 to 3.5; and total orders jumped from 76
to 84.
In addition to ServiceCraft’s gains, Donovan explains that 2 of his 25
participating manufacturers have also attained signiﬁcant savings. One LTL
carrier ships 971,000 pounds, 121 orders (two per week), and 8,000 pounds.
Prior to SCORE, the total was around $25,000, but it is now $5,820 under
the SCORE program.
Another larger manufacturer that ships 667 orders at 11,600 pounds was
spending $141,000 and is now spending $63,000 per year. Donovan expects
$744,000 in total LTL shipping costs for the group now, compared to $1.6
million prior to SCORE.
SCORE at Nabisco
One of ServiceCraft’s predominant manufacturing customers participating
in SCORE is Nabisco, Inc. Gerald Cantwell, Jr., director of customer ser-
vice and logistics for Nabisco (Parsippany, N.J.; 973-682-7427), explains
that the company uses SCORE to ship direct from the manufacturing plant
to the retailer. Previously Nabisco had shipped full truckloads to a 3PL DC
and then shipped LTL to a customer’s DC and then to the retailer. Shipping
direct works well for single-product groups and has saved $342 per hun-
dredweight in total logistics costs.
Also, Nabisco contracts with other manufacturers that make products
for Nabisco and private labels. Formerly, these products shipped from the
plant in TL or LTL to the 3PL DC and then trucked LTL to the customer
DC and then to the retailer. Now, Nabisco is bypassing the 3PL altogether.

The result has been improved inventory turns, lowered costs, and a reduced
number of trucks for the retailer.
“We tracked this model for six months with one retailer and found that
over that period we shipped 589,000 pounds,” says Cantwell. “This would
have taken 13 Nabisco trucks and ﬁve trucks from our copackers, averaging
about 39,000 pounds of truckload weight. Now, we use only 14 trucks and
the weight is 42,000 pounds. We gain revenue because we bypass some of
the DC costs.”
Other savings include a 30% reduction in transportation costs, increased
inventory turns, reduced order cycle time, a 3.5-hour decrease in unloading
time, and improved truck use (Nabisco is now able to get three times the
number of orders on its trucks).
Getting Started at Nabisco
Cantwell is quick to point out that multivendor consolidation is a process
change with speciﬁc requirements. Before you begin, make sure you
• Have a mix of product. The greater the mix of product, the easier it is
to get the program started, according to Cantwell. Nabisco, for instance,
produces and ships more than just cookies. Steak sauce, dog bones, and
candy are included in the mix.
• Realize savings potential. “If you will only save a little bit, there will be
little excitement in the organization; but the bigger the number, the greater
the excitement.”
• Have a champion. Such a person is needed within your organization,
with your trading partners, and at the 3PL. “You need someone to drive this
through because a process change is difﬁcult to make happen,” says Cantwell.
• Make sure the program is customer driven. “If the customer doesn’t want
to participate, the program won’t work,” he says. “The big thing that makes
SCORE work is that customers place their orders with the intent of con-
solidation. In the past, that never happened. Consolidation was driven by
manufacturers or carriers, and the customer was left out.”
• Align with trading partners. You need critical mass to make this work,
so try to ﬁnd three or four willing participants within the 3PL warehouse
environment.
• Invest in technology. Cantwell says that technology is not required, but
it will help get over organizational barriers that may exist between you and
your trading partners.

Thinking of terminating your distributor? It may not be as simple as giving
notice of intention to end the relationship. In fact, it could very well lead to
an antitrust action ﬁled by the distributor against your organization. Termi-
nation of distributors is one of the most troublesome areas of antitrust law.
According to The Antitrust Counselor (Business Laws, Inc.; 440-729-7996),
the reasons include the following: 
• Termination of a distributor is a speciﬁcally identiﬁable event that
usually gives rise to at least the threat of a lawsuit. “The terminated distrib-
utor usually suffers a ﬁnancial loss, and he or she is usually a businessperson
with a lawyer, a bad combination for the one causing the loss.”
• The present state of the antitrust law is not understood by many busi-
nesspeople. Even some business counselors are of this classiﬁcation, the pub-
lication insists: “They think that every refusal to deal by a manufacturer is a
violation of the antitrust laws.”
• When all the facts are gathered, it frequently turns out that some
salesperson or ﬁeld rep has made comments that could be interpreted as sug-
gesting anticompetitive reasons for the termination. It’s usually just enough
to get most termination cases to the jury. “This situation is always dangerous
for a large manufacturer being sued by a small businessperson,” The Antitrust
Counselor cautions.
Thoroughly Analyze the Specifics
Because the termination process is so sensitive, manufacturers will, in all
likelihood, be working closely with corporate counsel. To prepare you for
this mission, we offer the following guidelines developed by The Antitrust
Counselor.
1. Closely examine the distribution contract. The basic idea is to evalu-
ate any possibility for a breach of contract lawsuit by the distributor. This
should include the following
• Obtaining a copy of the written contract
• Obtaining any information that might lead someone to allege that the
written contract has been modiﬁed in any way or that certain of its
provisions have been waived
Distribution
63

• Identifying all of the obligations that the company undertook in the
contract and ascertaining whether they have been met
• Reviewing all provisions concerning damages
2. Examine all issues concerning territorial or customer restrictions. The law is
favorable to manufacturers when the termination results from a distributor’s
violation of the rules against tying, territorial, or customer restrictions.
However, manufacturers still need to obtain all the facts relating to possible
problems in those areas.
Keep in mind that tying, territorial, and customer restrictions are not il-
legal per se, but are judged under the rule of reason analysis. “Even under
that lower standard, it is still possible to have a violation in a situation with
extreme facts,” as the guidelines note.
3. Identify any relevant state unfair competition laws. Many of these deal
with unfair practices against consumers. However, some either expressly
govern business-to-business transactions or have been judicially interpreted
to apply in that context.
4. Identify relevant state franchise statutes. Some state franchise statutes de-
ﬁne franchise very broadly. In fact, some “inartfully” drafted distributorship
contracts would be swept within their deﬁnition. Because these state fran-
chise statutes often restrict terminations, they could be highly relevant to
your analysis, according to the checklist.
5. Determine whether you plan to offer any of the distributor’s employees a job.
The idea here is to identify any possible claim of “employee raiding” by the
distributor.
6. Evaluate the possibility of the distributorship’s bankruptcy. If likely, it in-
creases the likelihood of a suit as well. If termination will be effective at a fu-
ture time, an intervening bankruptcy of the distributor may operate to ex-
tend the agreement as an “executory contract,” and in any event the
“automatic stay” would apply.
7. Examine arbitration clauses carefully. If there is an arbitration clause in
the distributorship agreement, it should be carefully examined to see if it
covers termination. If so, this affects risk analysis. Your counsel also needs to
analyze the relationship between the arbitration clause and the choice of law
clause to resolve any potential conﬂicts. 
8. Look into your company’s pricing practices. Could there be a Robinson-
Patman Act violation? Ask the following questions:
• Have all the “meeting competition” situations been properly docu-
mented?

Procedures for Terminating a Distributor
DO
•
Give the longest possible notice.
•
Consider stating the reason for the termination in the notice of ter-
mination even if you are not required to do so.
•
Explain in an honest but ﬁrm and unequivocal way why you have no
other business choice but to do this. Avoid any ambiguous actions in
the termination process.
•
Refrain from mentioning any other distributors.
•
Give the distributor a chance to minimize any ﬁnancial losses.
•
Give the distributor a chance to complete any short-term deals and to
retain anticipated proﬁt.
•
Make certain that the ﬁeld people send in all papers bearing on the ter-
mination and give the complete story.
•
Limit employee contact or communications with the distributor; you
do not want the salespeople issuing threats or engaging in coercion or
other questionable activities.
•
Keep a record of all contacts and communication with the distributor.
•
Obtain legal advice on any termination case.
POSSIBLY DO
•
Give the distributor a temporary supply of goods but be precise in this
situation. State exactly what you will do and for how long.
•
Arrange for other means for this distributor to obtain products, such
as buying them from another distributor. This is especially important
if you are replacing one distributor with another.
DO NOT
•
Rely on the contract for short notice on termination.
•
Send a heavy-handed letter to the distributor.
•
Send a letter that includes anticompetitive or other problematic lan-
guage.
•
Agree to any promises for the distributor regarding pricing, territory,
customers, and so on, brought about by the threat of termination.
Make a decision and stick to it.
•
Leave unanswered letters in the ﬁle to cloud the record as to the real
reason for termination.

• Has the company been selling at different prices to different classes of
customers? If so, will these different classes hold up in court?
• Have the company’s advertising and promotional programs been
structured to comply with the appropriate sections of the Robinson-
Patman Act and the relevant guidelines?
9. Examine all issues relating to damages. Remember that you and your
counsel should not be too quick to minimize any potential liability concerns.
The many different theories of liability can often lead to different types of
damage awards or recovery. “All termination decisions should be made with
an eye toward possible litigation and the damages that the company might
sustain,” it advises.
10. Remember the key word when considering termination: fairness. The Anti-
trust Counselor offers a series of procedures to follow (see sidebar) if the anal-
ysis recommends a termination of the distributor. The publication stresses
the importance of a fair termination procedure. However, your analysis and
that of your counsel might reach two other potential outcomes as well:
• Do not cut off the distributor. The distributor may really be doing a
pretty good job. Or, even though it has some faults, it is not hurting the
company or standing in the way of better distribution. In this case, do not
terminate the distributor if there is any potential antitrust risk.
• You want to terminate the distributor, but you cannot afford the risk.
Here, you ﬁnd that the distributor is really troublesome. However, there are
overriding dangers from an antitrust point of view. In this case, wait and
build a better record. Document all problems and establish meaningful quo-
tas for the distributor.

A comprehensive study—Inventory Management: Enhancing Proﬁts by Con-
trolling Distribution, by the American Productivity and Quality Center
(APQC; Houston, Tex.; www.apqc.org)—identiﬁes and examines innova-
tions, best practices, and key trends in inventory management. It found that
the following characteristics are common to all participants:
1. Inventory and purchasing management requires more effort than ever before
despite the introduction of new technology. Lower proﬁt margins in almost every
66
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

industry demand better management of assets, and inventory is usually the
largest asset of a distributor. The skills required of inventory/purchasing
people continue to increase and must continue to be enhanced.
2. Inventory is expensive. Decisions on stocking new products require
careful evaluation. Therefore, stocked inventory is regularly reviewed to
identify and liquidate dead or obsolete material.
3. Communication with customers and salespeople is necessary to evaluate and
react to changing customer demand. Inventory/purchasing management depart-
ments do not operate in a vacuum. They view others, inside and outside of
the organization, as valuable resources for information.
4. Companies are attempting to reduce the amount of maintained, stocked in-
ventory by encouraging suppliers to improve lead times. All study participants try
to negotiate yearly purchase discount agreements with vendors instead of re-
ceiving better prices based on the size of a single order. They also place re-
plenishment orders more frequently. 
Research on Four Macro Areas 
The benchmark study enables companies to direct their own inventory
management process more effectively and to identify any performance gaps.
Nine companies participated in the study. Four were sponsors, whereas ﬁve
participated as “best practice” companies.
Practices of the ﬁve best practice (partner) companies (Caterpillar, Peo-
ria, Ill.; Fairmont Supply Company, Washington, Pa.; Graybar Electric
Company, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.; LCR-M corporation, Baton Rouge, La.;
and Panduit Corporation, Tinley Park, Ill.) are a model for others to emu-
late. Best practices include the following:
• Customer service level and carrying cost of inventory.
1. All partner companies carefully measure customer service on a
monthly basis. Several classify customer service failures to improve
their internal processes.
2. All partner companies use the economic order quantity (EOQ)
service formula. Although EOQ was used by all, it was not uni-
versally applied.
3. Acceptable customer service levels range from 90% to 98%, and
several partner companies guarantee to certain customers a spe-
ciﬁc service level.
Distribution
67

4. Each partner company was most concerned with the service level
of its “A” (fast-moving) items.
5. There is no standard methodology or set of formulas for demand
forecasting and determining safety stock quantities. 
6. All partner companies use min/max replenishment for some
items, mostly those that are slow moving or stocked for speciﬁc
customers.
7. All calculate inventory carrying cost. However, there is no consis-
tency in the carrying cost percentage used. Each partner consid-
ers a different set of elements in calculating carrying cost. Because
the carrying cost percentage is an integral part of the EOQ for-
mula, this inconsistency may explain why each participant found
the EOQ formula to be lacking in certain circumstances.
• Inventory turnover and return on investment.
1. All partner companies consider turnover to be a less important
measurement of inventory performance than customer service
level or return on investment.
2. All study participants are attempting to assign a single source of
supply to as many products as possible. This not only improves the
consistency of the products offered to customers but also reduces
the number of products that must be maintained in inventory.
3. Most partner companies added more items to inventory than they
discontinued. Although they are reluctant to stock duplicate items
from different suppliers, they are eager to expand their product of-
ferings to serve their customers better. 
4. All partners had speciﬁc criteria for adding items to inventory. For
instance, a special-order item would have to be sold a minimum
of two to six times in a 12-month period to be considered for
stock.
5. No one was willing to stock an item based on a customer’s “prom-
ises.” They all wanted commitment.
• Excess inventory and shrinkage.
1. All partner companies view excess inventory as a major challenge
and have a program in place to remove and liquidate excess in-
ventory and dead stock. All partners’ excess inventory is consider-
ably below the national average.
68
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

2. Each partner identiﬁed maintaining inventory accuracy as major
challenge. All but one have a perpetual cycle-counting program
in place. 
3. All partners have similar strategies for handling excess inven-
tory/dead stock, including the following: return to vendor, trans-
fer to other locations where needed, reduce the price, and throw
in trash (a last-resort method).
4. The most common reason for excess inventory/dead stock is
changing customer demands. Not one partner mentioned bad de-
mand forecasts for new inventory items.
5. Some companies are just starting to explore advertising excess ma-
terial over the Internet.

True supply chain integration requires a centralized approach to transportation
management. With multiple carriers all operating on different systems and
offering multiple modes, however, integration can be difﬁcult to attain. By
applying a virtual transportation solution, you can centralize and coordinate
shipments from multiple carriers to create an optimal distribution network.
This approach can save a minimum of 10% on your annual shipping bill.
A virtual transportation control center offers shippers all the beneﬁts and
functionality of a true network—selection, negotiation, and management of
carriers; tracking and tracing; and freight audit processing and payment—
without requiring investment in the infrastructure. These activities and
more are turned over to a third-party logistics provider that offers a virtual
transportation control center as a value-added service.
Getting Started
Roger Lowther, vice president of transportation services for USCO Logis-
tics (Naugatuck, Conn.; 888-246-USCO; www.usco.com), told attendees
Distribution
69

at a recent annual meeting of the Warehouse Education and Research
Council (WERC; 630-990-0001) how to establish a virtual transportation
control center.
First, determine if your company is even a candidate for a virtual trans-
portation center. Lowther says that typical participants serve multiple mar-
kets in multiple geographies. These tend to be companies in high-tech, re-
tail, and pharmaceutical industries. Next, the third party that you are
considering should offer to analyze your transportation network. USCO, for
instance, performs an opportunity assessment to determine how much the
shipper is currently spending on transportation over at least a three-month
period and whether the virtual transportation solution would be ﬁnancially
worthwhile. If the analysis recommends moving forward, the shipper can
expect to obtain the most efﬁcient and affordable transportation services,
says Lowther, sometimes saving more than 10%.
How It Works
In the case of USCO, a customer’s sales order is received by the client’s
ERP system. The ERP transmits the order to the USCO WMS. The
WMS then sends the order to the USCO TMS, which, based on the best
carrier’s cost and service to deliver the order, instructs the WMS how to
route the order. A central server at USCO has access to their client’s in-
ventory in all 18 USCO shared-DCs to ensure that the order can be filled.
A carrier interface system receives the information from the WMS and up-
loads data about the shipment to the carrier for pickup. Once the order is
picked up, an electronic confirmation is sent to the WMS, TMS, and
client ERP.
The TMS is essential to the process, says Lowther, because it keeps a
record of what actually shipped, signals if there was any change in the load
plan, tracks and traces the shipment, sets up a freight-payable ﬁle based on
what actually did ship, and provides a wide range of management reports.
Two Types of Virtual Networks
Lowther says that logistics managers can opt for either a centralized or de-
centralized virtual transportation control center, depending on the size and
complexity of their transportation requirements. In a centralized environ-
ment (multiple USCO clients in a shared facility), the transportation control
center is centrally located in USCO’s headquarters to distribute product to
70
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

all clients’ customers quickly. Centrally coordinating multiple carriers across
multiple USCO facilities optimizes service and cost, says Lowther.
For ﬁrms that have the critical mass, a dedicated transportation control
center (one company in one facility) may be the best way to go. However,
expect to spend more for the operation of the transportation control center
because the dedicated center is a stand-alone operation that can be located
anywhere.

Given the hundreds of 3PLs that provide freight payment services, it can be
tough to narrow the ﬁeld and ﬁnd the right one for your needs. Here is a
shortcut: By concentrating on the following four areas, the right choice can
be easy.
1. The Price of a Provider
Price is an important factor when choosing a freight payment management
provider, according to Aims Logistics (Collierville, Tenn.; 901-854-5777;
www.aimslogistics.com), a third-party freight payment provider. To get the
most accurate pricing structure, the provider needs to understand your op-
erations. The following will give the 3PL a better picture of your operations:
• What does your company do?
• How many dollars do you pay to carriers annually?
• What volume of shipments do you make annually for each mode?
• How many invoices do you pay manually and electronically?
• Do you rate your shipments with a Freight All Kinds (FAK) or actual
class rating?
• What parameters do you use to rate shipments?
• Why do you want to outsource? What issues are you facing?
• What is your timeline for changing your process?
• Are you looking for a provider for U.S. domestic shipments only, or
are you also looking for an international provider? If you want inter-
national processing capabilities, in what countries are your located?
Distribution
71

• Is your company centralized or decentralized?
• Do you follow the same account coding conventions across your or-
ganization?
• What EDI transaction sets do you use?
• Which, if any, of your primary carriers are set up on EDI?
2. Payment Practices
Many components make up the freight payment process. Make sure you
know how the 3PL carries out the process so that you know what you are
paying for, recommends Cass Information Systems, Inc. (Bridgeton, Mo.;
314-506-5500; www.cassinfo.com). Some questions regarding payment
practices include the following:
• Does your system have a speciﬁc day-of-the-week close out?
• Are you currently doing multiple closeout days for any of your
clients?
• If a special closeout is needed, could your system handle it, and would
there be an additional charge?
• What is the frequency of payments to carriers, and by what means can
payment be made?
• Describe the information ﬂow during the payment process. What is
your funding/reconciliation process?
• Discuss how your company can be ﬂexible in meeting different pay-
ment terms (30/45/60 days) and providing cash management ser-
vices.
• How do you handle payment in foreign currencies? Do you pay car-
riers outside the United States? If yes, in what countries? Do you pay
international carriers in currencies other than U.S. dollars? If yes,
what international currencies do you support?
• By what method do you pay international payees?
• Describe your company’s strategic plan for implementing the Euro
while maintaining support for legacy currencies.
• Describe your company’s strategies for hedging currency risk and re-
denominating transactions in foreign currencies into USD.
72
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

3. Uses and Sophistication of Technology
One reason you choose to outsource freight payment is that you expect an
expert to have the technology to carry out the task more efﬁciently. To as-
sess providers’ technological capabilities, address the following:
• Describe your system and database capabilities. How far back does
your online payment history extend?
• What type of operating platform strategy do you use?
• Describe your capabilities to transmit/receive data via FTP as well as
high-speed modem connections. 
• What is your application software, and when are received bills visible
to clients/carriers?
• Can you access processed data online via modem or the Internet?
• Discuss current and planned technologies, including database devel-
opment, enhancements, and maintenance of applications.
• Describe your abilities to marry U.S. domestic and international data
together for global site analysis.
• What EDI versions do you handle? Will you continue to support
non-Y2K versions of EDI translations?
• Do you support UN/EDIFACT data receipt and translations for EDI
processing?
• Do your applications handle multicurrency?
4. Researching Financials
According to Aims Logistics, many shippers overlook a potential provider’s
freight funds management. Consider these items to understand the pro-
vider’s commitment to the safe management of your freight funds. Remem-
ber that a provider’s length of service is not necessarily an indication of strin-
gent ﬁnancial controls.
• Does the provider have audited ﬁnancial statements and written
opinions from an independent auditing ﬁrm? Through these statements, you
can conﬁrm that the provider is ﬁnancially healthy, that ﬁnancial controls are
in place, and that ﬁnancial controls meet generally accepted accounting
Distribution
73

principles, any related party transactions, and the company’s investment
policies.
• Does the provider have ﬁdelity bonding to protect freight funds from
dishonest employees? These steps will help in researching ﬁdelity bonding
protection: Verify the bonding company. Then ask the provider to send you
an original Certiﬁcate of Insurance from its bonding company. When you
receive the Certiﬁcate, contact the bonding company to conﬁrm the
amount of coverage and any exclusions from coverage. For instance, if com-
pany ofﬁcers and check signers are excluded, cost of coverage is reduced.
However, these employees can more easily circumvent the ﬁnancial controls
that protect your freight funds.
• Does your provider offer written investment policies? Third-party
payment providers control your freight funds for a short period of time.
During that time, those funds can earn ﬂoat revenue. Understand the
provider’s investment instruments and what risk is involved. That level of
risk should mirror the level of acceptable risk of your company’s treasury de-
partment.
Some Final Points
In your search for a freight payment provider, take the following two points
into consideration. First, make sure that freight payment is the provider’s
core competency and not just another service it offers, advises Teena
Sorensen, a consultant with the Sorensen Group (Chagrin Falls, Ohio; 440-
543-6354; sorensengp@aol.com).
Second, decide what level of control you want over the process once it
is outsourced, she advises. “Some shippers want to keep their hands in the
process, so they like being close to the provider’s premises.” Just remember,
as she continues, “You can’t outsource all responsibility because it is still up
to you to manage the relationship with your carriers. Work with the freight
payment provider to avoid carrier conﬂicts.”

The hidden logistics costs of domestic and international shipments can
greatly skew what managers think they are paying for goods. The most per-
vasive of these hidden costs is taxes. Keen logistics managers can identify
74
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

these costs and uncover other tax-saving opportunities with the creation of
a tax program.
“Logistics managers have the chance to capture savings that have un-
knowingly been overlooked,” says Richard Janis, partner with KPMG LLP’s
Washington National Tax practice (McLean, Va.; 703-747-3164). It just re-
quires knowing where to look.
Partnering Up with the Tax Guy
To ﬁnd and reduce taxes, logistics managers should seek the support of tax
experts. The reality of the situation, however, is that tax specialists are not
included in business meetings or in decisions about supply chain activities,
such as transportation, according to a recent survey from KPMG. The sur-
vey found that the vast majority (84%) of tax departments are not involved
with transportation and logistics. Only 16% are included in management
meetings with transportation leaders (see Figure I-2.2).
Together, managers and tax pros should develop a transportation and
excise tax minimization program focused on developing and implementing
tax-saving strategies. Some of the taxes that a transportation tax minimiza-
tion program should focus on are sales tax, fuel tax, license fees, property tax,
workers’ compensation, and federal excise tax.
Identify Opportunities
Some of the tax-saving opportunities that a tax minimization program can
identify are in the following:
• Customs duties and tariffs. Two ways to look at customs are compli-
ance and planning, says Mark Neville, partner at KPMG LLP’s Trade and
Distribution
7 5
Figure I-2.2

TEAMFLY

Customs practice. From a compliance perspective, a company should ensure
that its operations are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations to
avoid the risk of penalties. Planning techniques are typically aimed at chang-
ing the tariff classiﬁcation—and, thereby, the rate of duty collected or the
dutiable value—lowering the tax base against which the duty is applied.
• Sourcing. This can be shifted to low-tax/duty jurisdictions. Domesti-
cally, companies need to look at the differences in state and local taxes be-
tween states. Globally, various options must be considered. For example,
most inbound goods from the European Union are dutiable, whereas the
same goods are duty-free if sourced through Israel.
• Income-based shifting. Companies can establish a structure in which in-
come is shifted from high-tax jurisdictions to low-tax jurisdictions. This is
achieved by unbundling services to identify pockets of proﬁtability and then
placing those pockets in appropriate tax jurisdictions, explains Janis. The
mechanism through which this is achieved is by transferring goods, services,
funds, technology, and intellectual property between related parties and es-
tablishing arm’s-length transfer pricing for the value of such items.
Just make sure that you are working with people who are knowledge-
able about transfer pricing as well as with people who have legal, ﬁnancial,
operational, and tax experience. These people must work together to take
into account all the factors that go into this and the effect that shifting could
have on the business as a whole.
• Trucking ﬂeets. Most ﬁrms that operate their own trucking ﬂeets use a
separate operating division, whereas other ﬁrms include the truck operations
in a separate legal entity. The proper operating structure and Interstate Com-
merce Commission (ICC) authority is key to reducing the overall operating
costs of your ﬂeet. For example, obtaining ICC authority to operate as a for-
hire carrier may allow for signiﬁcant sales and use tax savings, plus a reduc-
tion of other operating costs through increased backhauling revenue.
According to the KPMG respondents, in most cases (71%), responsibil-
ity for transportation and excise taxes falls outside the tax department (see
Figure I-2.3).
• Distribution centers. In addition to minimizing truck ﬂeet operating
taxes, opportunities exist to reduce taxes associated with owning and oper-
ating a DC. Some of the tax-related opportunities include property taxes,
incentives for DC location, duty drawbacks, and foreign trade zones.
The key to taking advantage of various depreciation rates is knowing ex-
76
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

actly what categories the IRS allows for warehouses. According to tax con-
sultants at PricewaterhouseCoopers (800-528-5816), properly categorizing
property costs can result in better depreciation rates. Better rates can result
just by how you classify the DC structure itself. For instance, one common
strategy is to build a rack-supported warehouse, in which the racks are part
of the building’s support system. The idea is to classify the entire building as
a piece of equipment that is used to store products.
• Foreign trade zones. At its simplest, a foreign trade zone (FTZ) permits
a duty deferral because it is deemed to be outside the customs territory. If
goods are reexported, duties are eliminated because they never enter the
customs territory.
• Virtual warehouses. A virtual warehouse can provide savings in man-
power, centralize accounting, improve cash ﬂow through deferring duty, and
improve customs compliance.
• Regional trade agreements. A regional approach to trade, in the form of
customs unions or free trade areas, allows goods from participating countries
to be shipped duty-free within the region.
• Charity donations. If you have excess or slow-moving inventory, you
might consider donating it to a charitable organization. The federal Internal
Revenue Code allows donations to tax-exempt organizations as long as the
property is used solely for the care of infants or of the ill or needy. How much
a tax deduction your company can expect is a question better put to a tax
specialist; generally, however, the writeoff should be equal to the lesser of
twice the cost of the inventory, or the cost of the goods plus one-half the dif-
ference between the cost and the inventory’s fair market value.

If industry statistics are right, it is imperative that logistics departments sim-
plify their e-business order fulﬁllment process. Between 2000 and 2001, the
value of orders placed over the Web is expected to increase sixfold. By the
end of 2000, companies booked an estimated 12% of orders via the Web, up
from 2% in 1998. They expected electronic inﬂows of orders to grow to 47%
of orders, up from 27% in 1998 (see Figure I-2.4).
All of this boils down to the fact that you will wind up reducing the
number of staff dedicated to traditional order management (taking orders by
phone, fax, mail, or e-mail) and rely more heavily on automation to handle
incoming orders via the Internet. Here are some great ways to facilitate that
process.
• Coordinate initiatives to improve delivery performance. A survey from the
Performance Measurement Group (PMG; Waltham, Mass.; 781-434-1279),
Supply-Chain Management Benchmarking Series, ﬁnds that best-in-class per-
formance in perfect order fulﬁllment has improved 5% since the mid 1990s.
Late shipments account for the number one failure toward achieving perfect
orders. Other reasons include incorrect documentation, incorrect items be-
ing shipped, damaged goods, and incorrect quantities (see Figure I-2.5).
Organizations can reduce these errors by coordinating efforts through-
out the supply chain. “The industry is moving beyond simple delivery reli-
ability to a holistic view of complete, on-time, and accurate order fulﬁll-
ment,” says Steve Geary, chief analyst with PMG.

• Invest in automation. PMG’s survey results show that although the use
of automation is growing at a rapid rate, half of all orders placed still arrive
in a manner that requires manual order entry. Geary says, “Companies must
simplify their order management processes,” and they are beginning to do so
with Web and EDI technologies. He adds, “Companies are starting to in-
vest heavily in the development of electronic order receipt mechanisms with
far-reaching implications for the entire order fulﬁllment process.”
• Implement order-tracking systems. Such systems can compare requested
versus actual dates at the line-item level and give customers better visibility
to their inbound orders.
• Put yourself in their shoes. Imagine what issues the customer faces and
align your operating strategies to accommodate them. This might include
being more ﬂexible or improving on-time performance. Or it might mean
having to disperse inventory to regional DCs for faster delivery, conﬁgure
orders, or have your computers talk to their computers. “All of these are re-
acting to what the customer needs,” says Geary. “Companies are starting to
view the customer delivery process as a bundle of services that maximize the
customer experience.”
• Share information with customers. Survey results indicate that today’s
customer relationships require a great deal of data transfer between compa-
nies. Findings show that the Web is being used for customers requesting
shipment status notiﬁcations and inventory status updates, and that cus-
tomers and suppliers are exchanging product sales activity data, as well as
planning and forecasting data over the Web.
• Partner with suppliers. A key issue confronting managers is how to con-
tinue reducing material constraints without increasing on-hand inventory.

Distribution of Failure Modes

Best-in-class companies are working with their suppliers to reduce cost and
uncertainty. “Companies that can reduce their delivery time without build-
ing large costly pools of inventory and inform all tiers of the supply chain in-
stantly of customer demand changes will put slower movers at a signiﬁcant
disadvantage,” says Robert Pethick, Pittiglio Rabin Todd & McGrath
(PRTM) director.
This primarily revolves around improved forecasting and transmitting
that information throughout the supply chain. Eliminating uncertainty al-
lows you to be more ﬂexible and reduces lead times. “It is a guessing game
as you look up and down the supply chain to determine what tidal wave is
coming next,” says Geary.
• Improve cash cycles. Part of streamlining order management is receiv-
ing payment more quickly. PMG points out two effective payment options.
First, consider implementing online purchasing and EDI. This will help re-
duce the time and overhead needed to process paperwork. A “pay on re-
ceipt” approach for selected products can minimize time-consuming match-
ing and reconciliation of customer invoices.
Another option is “cash release” agreements for blanket orders. For
companies concerned with cash ﬂow, you might want to explore third-party
reconciliation and payment relationships. This puts the third-party in charge
of providing cash management in exchange for notiﬁcation from the cus-
tomer that shipment has been received. Companies adopting this approach
can achieve single-digit receivables periods (within 10 days), helping to
achieve cash-to-cash cycle times that are one-third to one-half that of their
competitors’.
All of these strategies have a common thread: the customer. “The In-
ternet lets you focus on what your core competency is and ﬁnd ways to add
value to the customer’s ordering experience,” says Geary. “Understand your
role in the total supply chain and how it relates back to the customer so that
their order fulﬁllment needs are met.”

The challenges facing ﬂeet supervisors and their staffs range from how to
control expenses to choosing new information systems and setting the right
maintenance levels. On top of all this, the whole process has gotten harder
80
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

with the rising cost of fuel. Ultimately, the key to effective ﬂeet management
is a sound transportation program focused on ﬁve main areas.
1. Improved Overall Management
Transportation managers must develop a higher skill level in order to attain
a successful ﬂeet program. Richard Kochersperger, Gerald Peck Research
Scholar for the Erivan K. Haub School of Business at Saint Joseph’s Univer-
sity (Philadelphia; 610-660-1616), recommends that management adopt the
following practices toward managing its ﬂeets:
• Hire professionally educated and trained personnel. In-house educa-
tional programs should be introduced to improve the skills and knowledge
of staff. 
• Give transportation a higher proﬁle in the company. Develop a ﬁve-
year action plan that details how the transportation department will continue
to overall proﬁtability and performance of the company. Identify speciﬁc ob-
jectives and goals to be accomplished.
• Integrate benchmarking into the management process. Speciﬁc
weaknesses and opportunity areas should be identiﬁed, and a plan to correct
any faults should be implemented.
• Adopt activity-based management practices. Management needs to
know which customers are subsidized because they cost more to service,
which processes are inefﬁcient, which products are more expensive to han-
dle, which equipment costs the least to operate, and which routes are most
expensive.
2. Effective Use of Information
Companies should develop and implement an effective benchmarking strat-
egy that measures all areas of ﬂeet performance. The program should involve
all associates. Some suggestions for accomplishing this goal include the fol-
lowing:
• Get the entire logistics team involved in reporting on performance
measures. Have them measure performance over time, identifying positive
developments and new opportunities.
Distribution
81

• Identify which metrics to measure. Start with the basics such as on-
time deliveries, percentage of orders delivered, total cost per mile, and ex-
penses as a percentage of sales. As you begin to learn and understand the de-
tails of these metrics, consider adding other measurements such as cost per
case, pounds/cube per delivery, percent of backhaul trips, empty miles,
scratches, damage, and equipment utilization.
Kochersperger says that a report should be generated every day that
looks at delivery performance and on-time deliveries. This information
should be made available to all associates so that they understand how the
company is performing.
3. Information Systems and Technology
The use of information systems is growing, and there is more interest on the
part of transportation managers to purchase such technology for their ﬂeet
programs. According to Kochersperger, the solutions that pose the greatest
beneﬁt to managers in their ﬂeet management programs are trip recorders,
computer routing systems, and radio and satellite communications. “Trip
recorders offer great potential, but many ﬂeet managers are not using the in-
formation effectively,” he says. Trip recorders are useful for determining the
following information: off-route miles, on-time delivery, actual trip miles,
store unloading, speed, and engine idle.
Technology is also crucial to ﬂeet maintenance. Computers, either main-
frame or personal, can assist in information management. Kochersperger
says that there is a developing need to move to bar code systems for parts and
tire management and to integrate vendor information systems for engines,
tires, and refrigeration units. “The ﬂeet maintenance facility in the 21st cen-
tury will employ much information technology that will contribute to sig-
niﬁcantly lower repair costs and road failures,” he says.
4. Maintenance Strategy
Rising fuel costs are just one reason for managers to ﬁnd ways of controlling
ﬂeet costs. According to Kochersperger, ﬂeet maintenance costs such as re-
pairs, tires, labor, and overhead can also be kept to a minimum by strictly ad-
hering to the following:
82
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

• Emphasize preventive maintenance. Use the best mechanics to com-
plete this process, which will go a long way in reducing equipment down-
time and preventing major component failures. Ensure that the preventive
maintenance schedules are completed in a timely manner and are conducted
regularly.
• Keep the maintenance area clean and organized. Have a place for
everything. Make sure the workspace is well lit and laid out efﬁciently. La-
bel parts clearly. Do not store remains and leftovers on the property, such as
batteries, old parts, and paints.
• Control the inventory. Audit parts movement and fuel consumption
regularly. Check invoices for correct pricing and require multiple supply
points.
5. Fleet Safety
Probably the most important part of any fleet management program is the
driver and how safely that person operates the vehicle. Finding skilled
drivers in today’s labor pool continues to be a chore for many supervisors,
and retaining them once they are onboard is even more difficult. Here are
some of Kochersperger’s recommendations in the realm of human re-
sources:
• Hire the best people. Drivers are the ambassadors of the company be-
cause they see the customer the most. Seek transportation personnel who
have experience in the industry.
• Expect professional results. Give them the tools to do a great job,
such as uniforms, quality equipment, and technology. Provide training to
improve competencies and skills.
• Pay for performance. Award drivers for outstanding effort. Meet with
the group on a regular basis to listen to their view on operational issues.
• Implement an effective driver program. Encourage them to think safe
and promote safe driving habits.
• Participate in an accident prevention program. Several facilities
around the country are available to train for accident prevention. These op-
erations put drivers through controlled skids, which enable them to learn
what to do when a serious problem develops.

Coordinating shipments from multiple manufacturing sites usually adds
transportation, warehousing, and inventory costs. This, in turn, is causing
many logistics managers to look for a less expensive but reliable means of
consolidating multiple shipments for ﬁnal delivery to customers. For many
like Lucent, that answer has been merge-in-transit. Merge-in-transit is the
practice of moving freight manufactured from multiple locations to a single
location near the ﬁnal delivery site. It is especially suited to companies look-
ing to take advantage of just-in-time deliveries.
One company that has found success with merge-in-transit is Lucent
Technologies in Westminster, Colo. Lucent receives manufactured parts
from its own manufacturing site, as well as from outside suppliers. All of
those components were being shipped from their original manufacturing
site to a Lucent warehouse and then shipped to the end user. Gary Sahr, gen-
eral manager logistics for Lucent, says that the company realized that there
was little value added in shipping to the warehouse.
In an effort to cut out transportation time and ship products closer to
the end customer, Lucent set out to implement a merge-in-transit pro-
gram. After an extensive request-for-proposal process of various service
providers, Lucent chose to work with GeoLogistics Americas, Inc., in Den-
ver. 
According to Darryl Barker, vice president for business development at
GeoLogistics, Lucent’s manufacturers and suppliers ship their products to a
consolidation point close to the end user. Without putting those parts in
storage, GeoLogistics consolidates the shipments and makes a single deliv-
ery to the customer. A Lucent crew awaits the arrival of GeoLogistics at the
customer site and directs the unpackaging of the equipment. Lucent techni-
cians then install the technology. In some cases, Barker points out, staged de-
liveries can be made to the customer site, whereby certain components are
delivered at certain times. “This requires close coordination with Lucent,”
says Barker.
Sahr says that direct shipment to the consolidation points, of which Lu-
cent has around 40 throughout of the country, has helped improve three
business areas: on-time customer deliveries of complete orders; reduced in-
ventory carrying costs; and savings in warehousing, transportation, and dis-
tribution.
84
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

Eliminate Redundant Transportation
Barker says that redundant transportation movements and costs are virtually
eliminated when merge-in-transit is utilized. In the case of Lucent, for ex-
ample, he explains how the company used to transport components from the
original manufacturing site to a warehouse. The parts were then consoli-
dated and sent to the customer. Now, the transportation to Denver is elim-
inated.
Reduce Inventory Costs
Merge-in-transit also means that products are handled less frequently. Addi-
tional receiving and putaway are not required because the product does not
actually go into inventory, thus reducing inventory carrying costs. Because
inventory is not being pulled from shelves to ﬁll orders, cycle time is re-
duced. 
React to Forecast Changes
Barker says that merge-in-transit opens up opportunity for logistics man-
agers to react better to changes in forecasts. “Let’s say Lucent’s engineers
forecasted that so many batteries would be needed to ﬁll customer orders,
and then the customer changed the nature of its orders that a different bat-
tery would satisfy,” Barker explains. “The shorter interval that exists from the
manufacturing site to the consolidation center allows Lucent to adjust the
forecast, fulﬁll the order, and get the batteries to the customer in a timely
fashion.”
Moving Information, Not Material
Sahr and Barker agree that the transportation element of merge-in-transit
takes on less importance than does the information required to carry out the
task. You have to make sure that the information technology (IT) systems
between your company and the service provider are linked and reliable.
Lucent requires GeoLogistics to track shipments at the item level,
which, according to Barker, is more complicated than tracking at the ship-
ment level. Thus, the IT connections become critical. “We need the rele-
vant information from Lucent’s systems to do that tracking,” says Barker. “At
Distribution

that point, transportation becomes secondary to the movement of the infor-
mation.”
He says that any company looking to carry out merge-in-transit with an
experienced service provider should be willing to openly share that infor-
mation or else “the program won’t be successful.”
Didn’t Do It for the Money
Sahr says that since implementing its merge-in-transit program in April
1998, the service improvements are worth noting: 40% improvement in in-
ventory reductions, an $8 million dollar reduction in ﬁnished goods inven-
tory, shortened delivery times, and on-time deliveries of complete orders.
“Really, we did not begin this project to save money,” says Sahr. “This was
an opportunity to advance our customer service capabilities.”

Achieving a premiere position among your competitors really comes down
to one thing: sending out perfect orders to your customers. One sure way to
ﬁnd out if this is happening is to perform a measurement of your orders, trac-
ing them from beginning to end. One company that is in the middle of such
a process is M&M/Mars. Donald Jacobson, national logistics manager for
the company, explained how he is carrying out this task at a recent Logicon
meeting.
So far, M&M/Mars can claim the following improvements with regard
to its perfect order status: a 4% increase in direct shipments, a 70% increase
in indirect shipments of less than 70 pounds, a 28% decrease in accessorial
charges, reduced ship-to points by 61%, reduced number of orders by 41%,
reduced number of invoices by 45%, and decreased the number of ship-
ping/pricing deductions by 47%.
Perfect Order Cycle
The Perfect Order Measurement Cycle that M&M/Mars established will
measure failures in three areas: order, delivery, and settlement.
Order failures include
86
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

• Wrong customer number
• Invalid purchase order number
• Insufﬁcient lead time
• Incorrect/missing promotion number
• Incorrect/missing special instructions
• Incorrect item number
• Quantity variation
• Ordered over allocation
• Insufﬁcient inventory at order entry
• Incorrect price
• Incorrect customer terms
Delivery failures include
• Insufﬁcient inventory at the warehouse
• Appointment problems
• Overage/shortage/damage
• Wrong item picked/shipped
• Accessorial charges
Settlement failures include
• EDI invoice transmission error
• Customer check/transfer not automatched
• Customer takes a deduction
• Customer ignores terms of sale
Tracking Failures
Jacobson explains that in order to determine where any of the above failures
were occurring—from order entry to ﬁnal delivery—a project team consist-
ing of logistics, customer service, ﬁnance, sales, technical development, and
warehousing and transportation followed an order through the entire process.
The team documented all possible breakdowns and manual interventions.
Distribution
87

“We found that some failures were internal and some were the fault of
our customers,” he says. The reported failures will be used to develop pro-
cess improvements. Dedicated teams for the company’s top 15 accounts will
institute the improvements.
A Test Case
After identifying its potential failures, M&M/Mars ran a seven-month test
with one of its partners. It was set up so that the company would ship ap-
proximately three shipments per week.
Perfect orders accounted for only 6% of all orders shipped. Most failures
were due to incorrect or missing promotions, insufﬁcient inventory at the
warehouse, automatch problems, and deductions.
Jacobson says that this test case will allow M&M/Mars to move forward
in its quest for the perfect order. A phased approach will be implemented be-
cause it is both simpler and more cost effective to justify.
The Benefits
Once M&M/Mars reaches its goal of shipping perfect orders, Jacobson ex-
pects to see beneﬁts in the following areas:
• Customer service. Service measures will be integrating beyond order
ﬁll and physical distribution to include all possible failure points.
• Customer business development. “There will be a focus on eradicating
zero value-added activities by using tools to identify business processes that
cause inefﬁciencies and failures, allowing us to determine the root cause for
those failures and allow proactive interaction with customers,” says Jacobson.
“Ultimately, this will help us establish rapport and trust with key accounts.”
• Activity-based costing analysis. “This will provide the ability to under-
stand our selling, logistics, and administrative processes and costs and their
impact on proﬁts.”
Buying From Larger Distributors
In addition to tracking orders, the candy giant made some changes to its pric-
ing and ordering structure to increase the percentage of perfect orders. The
purpose is to ensure that customers receive their orders faster and correctly.
Key to this was forcing the smaller distributors to buy from the larger
88
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

ones, explains Jacobson. “This was met with some resistance by those who
thought they would wind up buying from their competitors,” he says, “but
they are getting better lead times, anywhere from three to ﬁve days versus
the seven that we could promise them. We only do three to ﬁve days lead
time for our top customers.” 
The Price of Perfection
To date, M&M/Mars has spent $150,000 on its project, and future expense
estimates are high. “I don’t think we’ll get all the funding at once,” says Ja-
cobson.

You never want your customers to wait for product, especially if it jeopard-
izes whether they satisfy their customers. This ripple effect on the supply
chain can have devastating results unless you have a system aimed at com-
bating stockouts and distribution errors.
Nowhere is this more critical than in the automotive aftermarket service
parts business, where providing timely, hassle-free delivery of parts to deal-
ers and customers can be leveraged as a strong competitive advantage. Un-
necessary complexity under an old system kept DaimlerChrysler from real-
izing this beneﬁt. Thanks to a new system, however, dealer satisfaction
ratings are higher than ever.
Order Fulfillment Gone Awry
For more than 20 years, Mopar—the division of DaimlerChrysler that pro-
vides service parts and accessories to dealers—used a traditional order ful-
ﬁllment system of strategically situated parts distribution centers (PDCs) to
provide service parts to a group of dealers in a designated region. Orders
were quickly ﬁlled by the PDC and delivered to the dealer the following
morning using a dedicated delivery system (DDS). 
However, if an ordered part was not available at the dealer’s PDC, it was
referred to another PDC in the network. This extended delivery time by
three to ﬁve days. Furthermore, referral parts were often damaged due to
multiple handlings in the shipment process.
Distribution
89

The referrals robbed the shipping PDC of inventory intended for its
own dealers and, as a result, created a series of stockouts and maldistribution.
At any given time, as many as 20,000 parts on order could be referral parts.
As a result, processing referral part orders was cumbersome and costly, so
dealers had to wait without any way of tracking the status of their order. 
Telephone calls for referral order tracking and expedited shipping re-
quests were frequent. “It set off a chain reaction that ultimately affected the
car owner,” says Doug Zopﬁ, North American Free Trade Agreement inte-
gration manager for DaimlerChrysler (Center Line, Mich.; 810-497-0515).
“Dealers’ repair schedules became unpredictable, affecting their ability to
service customers.”
Zopﬁsays that although referral parts accounted for only 6% of the to-
tal volume of parts that Mopar shipped, they made up nearly 50% of out-
bound transportation costs. “The old referral process was ineffective and
costly to operate,” Zopﬁexplained to attendees at a CLM annual meeting.
“We couldn’t tell dealers exactly when they would receive their critical parts
orders. Consequently, they couldn’t tell their customers with certainty when
they could complete repairs. We needed a more predictable and reliable sys-
tem that also reduced the cycle time of deliveries to our dealers.”
Another difﬁculty of the old network was the single-line order system.
Although the dealer had placed one order, the parts were picked, packaged,
metered, and shipped as individual line items, so each different part came to
the dealer in different boxes at different times.
A Two-Pronged Solution
Mopar’s Dealer Satisfaction Index suffered under the old system, and in 1998
DaimlerChrysler realized it was time for a change. The company partnered
with UPS Worldwide Logistics (UPS WWL; 734-542-9560) to create a
comprehensive supply chain and order fulﬁllment solution. “We needed a
single-point provider that could manage everything from end to end,” says
Zopﬁ. “UPS WWL offered us facilities, value-added services, and shipping
and tracking systems that allowed us to streamline our process, reduce dam-
ages, and improve our service levels.”
First, WWL looked at ways to boost efﬁciency. The processes in place
for the PDCs were reviewed to cut activities that failed to add value. Pack-
aging options to consolidate multiple line items for the same dealer were de-
signed to eliminate the need for single-line order processing. Traditional
transportation methods were redeﬁned to reduce order delivery cycle times
90
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

with less damage. Finally, the total system costs of the old process—labor,
transportation, damage claims—were identiﬁed. 
Next, two order consolidation centers (OCC) were created in Detroit
and Milwaukee and were staffed and managed by UPS WWL. The locations
are near Mopar’s national PDCs and several regional centers and are con-
venient to contract packagers who ship some dealer orders.
Mopar changed its order fulﬁllment system to shift most referrals
through its national PDCs and DCs near the OCCs. This reduced the num-
ber of stockouts and maldistribution effects. The OCCs also provide trans-
portation management, dedicated transportation, processing capabilities,
and call center support services.
The primary function of the OCCs is to expedite dealer orders. Stock
order referrals and oversized parts are consolidated and shipped to the
dealer’s PDC for ﬁnal delivery on Mopar’s DDS trucks. More critical and
car-down orders are consolidated by the dealer and are shipped using next-
day ground or air delivery.
OCC Equals Expedited Shipments
By combining items into overpacks, many of the inefﬁciencies of the old
single-line processing method were eliminated. Dealers now receive their
critical parts the next day in one consolidated shipment. Because of the faster
delivery times, the need for order tracking and expedited shipment requests
have also dropped off signiﬁcantly. However, when an order does need to be
traced, a full system of tracking information and reporting mechanisms has
been established to monitor every step of the process for every referral part. 
Dealer Satisfaction Rises
The response from dealers has been enthusiastic, with satisfaction scores rising
20% since the new system was implemented. “The system is working out well,”
says a parts manager in Anchorage, Alaska. “We have no damage to report.”
DaimlerChrysler has expanded the new system to referral parts orders
from dealers in Mexico, reducing the cycle time by nearly two weeks. Plans
are now underway to include Canadian dealers in the program. “We took a
giant step in customer service,” says Zopﬁ. “We’ve increased efﬁciency
throughout the network and provided dealers the consistency of delivery
that they deserve. Now dealers can schedule repairs with greater conﬁdence
because they know when they’ll have the parts they need.”

Have you considered how the euro is going to affect you and your logistics
operations? The good news is that the emergence of the Eurodollar will bol-
ster your ability to evaluate international suppliers and vendors by standard-
izing price comparisons against a common currency. The bad news is that
getting there will require adjustment to a euro-compliant software system.
We recently interviewed a number of euro experts to ﬁnd out what logistics
managers should be doing to get ready for this change.
One Big Happy Family
The introduction of the euro creates one European domestic market that is
almost as big as the U.S. market. Consequently, American companies doing
business in Europe will not have the headaches of dealing with ﬂuctuating
currencies. Any logistics manager who is selling or purchasing products in
Europe will feel the effects of the euro, according to Karin Bursa, vice pres-
ident of marketing at American Software (404-238-8338). 
The euro may even cause companies that are not involved with Euro-
pean import or export to reconsider their trade strategies. “Companies that
don’t have European suppliers or customers today may choose to in the fu-
ture because it will be easier to transact business with them,” Bursa explains.
With an expanded European market comes increased competition
among European suppliers. That means more choices for logistics managers.
For example, if a European subsidiary currently uses a third-party ware-
92

housing provider in Lisbon, a manager might opt to move distribution op-
erations to a facility in Rotterdam. The euro will enable logistics managers
to compare the costs of each more easily, argues Mark Root, project man-
ager at QAD, Inc. (805-684-6614). “The euro will have a competitive and
logistical impact,” Root says. A single European currency will enable logis-
tics managers in the United States to compare all suppliers and vendors un-
der the same currency. Therefore, the array of choices when importing and
choosing a European logistics services provider will grow. 
Preparation Is Fundamental
Unfortunately, most American companies are not ready to tackle the euro
and its changes. American businesses that are taking advantage of the euro
currently operate subsidiaries in Europe, Root says. He recommends that lo-
gistics managers begin by taking a strategic—rather than a tactical—look at
the euro. “Logistics managers should begin evaluating the European market
for suppliers,” Bursa says. They should look for competitive bids from logis-
tics vendors and suppliers to determine how cost-effective it is to continue
to do business with their existing European partners. Furthermore, logistics
managers who currently use only domestic suppliers should look outside
U.S. borders. “They may actually decide that it’s easier and cheaper to work
with nondomestic suppliers,” Bursa says.
All Systems Go
Managers must ensure that their supply chains and accounting systems can
support euro transactions. “Logistics managers have to prepare for the abil-
ity to conduct transactions,” Bursa advises. Keep in mind that the euro
creates more than an accounting issue. Electronic data interchange (EDI)
transactions, inventory management programs, and shipping and receiving
applications all include monetary values.
Not only must the systems be able to handle bills, invoices, and pay-
ments, but they also must be able to support triangulation. Because domes-
tic currencies will not become obsolete until 2002, software systems must
be able to recognize domestic currencies and U.S. dollars as well as the
euro. “It’s different than simply adding one additional currency to the ap-
plication,” Bursa says. For example, to determine the exchange rate be-
tween the U.S. dollar and the deutsche mark, software must convert the dol-
lar to the euro and then the euro to the deutsche mark. Although currency

triangulation is only a temporary necessity, it is a fundamental function of
any software program today. 
To ensure that logistics software applications are euro-ready, turn to the
software provider itself, Bursa recommends. Simply ask if the application is
euro-enabled. If it is not, ﬁnd out when an upgraded version will become
available. “You’re in for a big challenge if your application isn’t euro-
enabled,” she says. 
Next comes the migration strategy, which offers two options, Bursa
says. Either run parallel transactions using domestic currencies as well as the
euro or conduct a phased implementation of the euro into operations.
The Effect the Euro Will Have
How long a manager’s preparation takes depends on the speed with which
one starts, the determination to accommodate and take advantage of the
euro, and software readiness, Bursa and Root explain. Regardless of how
prepared managers are, however, they can be sure that their logistics opera-
tions will feel the euro’s effects. 
“The jury is still out on how quickly the euro will actually begin to af-
fect American companies,” Bursa says. Some experts expect the impacts to
hit immediately, but others estimate that the ripples will take a couple years
to hit America’s shores. By 2002, it will be a very competitive marketplace,
Bursa says.

Sending documents over the Internet is a great way to eliminate delays and
errors as well as fraud and forgery. Currently, logistics and shipping managers
have several free Internet options for sending bills of lading, shipping export
declarations, and many other documents.
Free Internet Bills of Lading Systems
Several major carriers, including American President Lines (APL; www.
apl.com), Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL; www.oocl.com), and
the newly merged Maersk (www.maerskline.com) and Sea-Land (www.
sealand.com), have introduced systems that allow shippers and forwarders to
94
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

download a bill of lading (B/L) from the carrier’s internal documentation
computer systems via the Internet. The B/L can be printed directly from a
desktop, allowing the shipper to control both the delivery speed and the ac-
curacy of the documents. The systems can also print waybills. To use these
free services, shippers must sign a terms and conditions (T&C) contract with
the carrier. When authorized, the carrier sends blank B/L forms to the ship-
per. The Internet B/L printing facility enables exporters to view it in a for-
eign country while having it printed in the U.S. home ofﬁce, eliminating
time spent sending B/Ls from source country to destination country.
Roadway Express, Inc. (Akron, Ohio) has released E-Z Export, a single
online document combining the basic international documentation needed
to ship between the United States and Mexico. Customers can log onto the
Roadway Web site (www.roadway.com), click on the Mexico section, and
prepare a B/L and commercial invoice in one step. The Web site then cre-
ates for the customer a PDF ﬁle in Adobe Acrobat. Customers who do not
have Adobe Acrobat will have to enter the Roadway Express Web page, use
the hotlink to Adobe Acrobat, and download the program before using E-
Z Export; there is no charge for the download. The ﬁle has instructions for
completing the required information for customs in Mexico, and it can be
printed or downloaded to the user’s computer once completed.
Finally, Canadian Paciﬁc Railway (CPR) will soon be introducing a means
for submitting electronic B/Ls. A notice on the CPR Web site (www.cpr.com)
says that “customers can easily submit a bill of lading online using CPRs e-
commerce engine, which is designed to let companies safely exchange business
documents that are not connected through an EDI value-added network.” An
online demonstration of the service is available from the Web site.
Benefits of Electronic Bills of Lading
The advantages of switching to electronic bills of lading include the fol-
lowing:
• Ease and speed give exporters an edge over the competition. Timeli-
ness of B/Ls affects customer satisfaction, just-in-time inventories,
and speed of payment.
• The possibility of lost B/Ls is eliminated.
• The need for the exporter or forwarder to collect B/Ls from the car-
rier’s ofﬁce and for the courier to mail or courier them to customers
is eliminated.

• B/Ls will be error-free and will conform to matching letters of credit
(L/Cs).
• Problems such as fraudulent presentation of counterfeit documents at
dockside are reduced.
• Electronic signatures may be used on B/Ls for L/Cs via the Interna-
tional Chamber of Commerce’s UCP 500 rules on documentary
credit. Note that banks in some nations may not accept validity of
B/Ls with electronic signature.
A Paperless Bill of Lading
Bolero International Ltd. is a joint venture of SWIFT, a Belgium-based
banking telecommunications consortium with 3,000 member banks world-
wide, and Through Transport Club, the mutual cargo insurance organiza-
tion headquartered in London. Bolero (www.boleroproject.com) plans a full
commercial launch of its system this fall. The system will allow secure elec-
tronic transmission not only of straight B/Ls but also of negotiable B/Ls
(which can be bought, sold, or traded while goods are in transit), L/Cs, cer-
tiﬁcates of origin, and insurance certiﬁcates. The pricing structure for
Bolero’s services is available on its Web site.
Bolero uses central electronic registry and encrypted digital signatures
to replace B/Ls. Receivers of goods will no longer appear at ports with B/Ls;
instead, Bolero participants will carry out electronic exchange of ownership
through a computerized registry. Users will be able to communicate with
Bolero over public or private networks. Connection during the launch
phase will be via Netscape Navigator browser. Free downloadable plug-ins
and freeware are provided. Connection via automated gateways and third-
party bureau services will be possible following the commercial launch.
SEDs Find Way onto the Internet
In addition to B/Ls, shipper’s export declarations (SEDs) can now be sent
electronically over the Internet to the Census Bureau and the U.S. Customs
Service as part of the agencies’ Automated Export System, developed in
1994. When users log on to the new Web site (www.AESDirect.gov), they
are asked to register, and that information is then sent to the government so
that Customs can accept future data from the ﬁler. Once the SED is keyed
in, users receive an internal transit number to conﬁrm acceptance of the
SED. This conﬁrmation is sent via e-mail.
96
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

According to the Commerce Department, the new system reduces the
paperwork burden on the trade community, makes document storage and
handling less costly, improves the quality of export statistics, and facilitates
exporting in general.
Even the Internet Illiterate Benefit
Companies looking to send important business documents electronically
can take advantage of a new solution from United Parcel Service (UPS) and
Hewlett-Packard Company (HP). The two companies have developed a se-
cure, trackable delivery service for digital documents. Using the HP 9100C
Digital Sender, physical documents can be sent electronically. Users simply
place the relevant document on the 9100 scanner and send it over the Inter-
net to the UPS Web site. The scanning process for a black-and-white image
will be approximately 15 pages per minute, and a color document will take
up to four pages per minute. Documents will arrive at the UPS site (www.
ups.com) in a few minutes. Senders must provide the recipient’s e-mail ad-
dress with the transaction.
Files are sent as either PDF (portable document format) or TIFF (tagged
image ﬁle format) ﬁles and can be in text or picture format. Once the doc-
ument is sent to UPS, the recipient is notiﬁed via e-mail that a document is
waiting to be picked up at the Web site. The e-mail message will include an
active URL address, on which the recipient can click and go right to the
UPS location. Although there is no sign-up fee for the service, the cost to
send a digital document is $2.50 per transaction, and the cost of the scanner
is around $3,000.

As sourcing activity moves toward a more global perspective, purchasing
professionals are naturally concerned about ethics. Are the rules different
when negotiating with an offshore supplier? Can you expect major differ-
ences among the ethical activities of suppliers in different countries?
Not really. That’s the conclusion that we reached after reviewing an en-
lightening new research study, Ethical Issues in Global Buyer-Supplier Rela-
tionships. Under the auspices of the Center for Advanced Purchasing Stud-
ies, Craig R. Carter of the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the
International Logistics
97

University of Maryland examined how ethical activities differed when pur-
chasing from various countries and deﬁned ethics as it relates to issues in
global buyer-supplier relationships.
What Is Unethical Here, and There?
In a surprising ﬁnding, the researcher reports the “activities viewed as un-
ethical are consistent across national cultures, at least when foreign suppliers
are dealing with American buyers.” Carter’s other ﬁndings include the fol-
lowing:
• Foreign suppliers identiﬁed the same categories of unethical activities as did
U.S. buyers. One possible explanation is that buyers and suppliers judge the
identiﬁed activities similarly because they involve fundamental core values
that cross cultures. “A more realistic explanation for this similarity is that eth-
ical expectations and standards have been established and communicated as
part of the buyer-supplier relationship,” Carter offers. Another factor is the
international supplier’s previous afﬁliations with other American companies.
• Ethical issues appear to be the same as in domestic sourcing. The analysis of
the survey data ﬁnds that activities such as bribery and the use of grease (fa-
cilitating) payments, which have typically been associated with international
transactions, were not included in either of the two buyer categories of un-
ethical practices or unethical supplier practices (see sidebar).
As Carter hints, this suggests that U.S. buyers are not engaging in these
activities “nearly as often” as might have been the case in the past. Further-
more, international suppliers appear to realize that these activities are unac-
ceptable when dealing with American buyers.
• Buyers and suppliers differed signiﬁcantly in their perceptions of the other’s in-
volvement. It is important to realize that even the appearance of an unethical
action can affect a party’s perception of how ethical the other party’s behav-
ior really is. Therefore, it is important for both buyers and suppliers to com-
municate their intentions and all relevant details of the purchasing trans-
action openly in order to minimize the gaps that can occur between each
party’s perception of the other’s behavior.
• Deceitful practices of buyers are minimized when companies communicate
ethics policies to suppliers—and have an ethics hot line. Other organizational fac-
tors, such as top management’s “walking the talk,” or providing training ap-
pears to have no impact on the degree to which purchasing managers are

Deﬁning Unethical Behavior
An analysis of the survey data from buying ﬁrms indicates that unethical ac-
tivities of buyers fall into broad categories.
1. Deceitful practices. This ﬁrst category consists of behavior involving de-
ception and includes survey questions addressing the following activ-
ities:
•
Purposefully misleading a sales person in a negotiation
•
Exaggerating the seriousness of a problem to gain concessions
•
Using obscure contract terms to gain an advantage over suppliers
•
Inventing (making up) a second source of supply to gain a com-
petitive advantage
2. Subtle practices. The second category of unethical actions includes
more subtle activities such as the following:
•
Writing speciﬁcations that favor a particular supplier
•
Allowing personalities of suppliers to impact decisions
•
Giving preference to suppliers preferred by top management
A further analysis suggests that unethical activities of suppliers consist of a single
set of activities, including the following:
•
Knowingly overcommitting resources or production schedules
•
Lying or grossly misleading customers in a negotiation
•
Using obscure contract language to gain an advantage over suppliers
•
Asking for information about competitors
•
Offering gifts in excess of nominal value
•
Increasing prices when there is a shortage
•
Using backdoor selling techniques such as approaching personnel in
engineering, manufacturing, or other departments outside purchasing
•
Using less competitive terms or prices for buyers who purchase ex-
clusively from the supplier
Finally, it is interesting to note that an analysis of the supplier survey data re-
vealed that suppliers identiﬁed the same sets of unethical activities (for both
buyers and suppliers) as did buyers.

involved in this dimension of unethical buyer activities. Therefore, the only
practical deterrent appears to be the fear of getting caught or reported. This
would be more likely to occur when policies are communicated to suppli-
ers and when ﬁrms have an ethics hot line.
• Less obvious unethical practices are affected by ethics training and evaluation.
Ethics training can help make new, inexperienced, and even seasoned buy-
ers more aware of the less obvious, unethical behaviors. In turn, including
ethical issues as part of a buyer’s formal evaluation can help to reinforce ma-
terial and policies covered during training.
• Buyers that are under pressure to perform and that want to advance are not
more likely to engage in unethical behaviors. Similarly, there is no relationship be-
tween pressures felt by foreign supplier representatives and their involve-
ment in unethical activities. “It appears that both buyers and suppliers real-
ize that employing unethical practices will result in short-term success at
best, but will inevitably culminate in damage to both their careers and the
buyer-seller relationship,” explains Carter.
• There is no relationship between nationality and the level of unethical activity
in buyer-seller relationship. One explanation for this ﬁnding is that behavior and
activities considered unethical by American purchasing managers have been
well communicated. Also, they are understood to be unethical by their for-
eign suppliers. Norms and expectations regarding ethics also may have been
established through the foreign supplier’s prior relationships with other U.S.
buying companies. “It is important to note that these ﬁndings apply only to
U.S. buyers and their foreign suppliers,” adds Carter. “Interviews with pur-
chasing managers suggest that different scenarios may exist when purchasing
occurs outside the United States for a foreign-based plant or subsidiary.”
• There is no link between unethical practices and the length or type of rela-
tionship that exists. Once norms and behavior are established in a relationship,
it is unlikely that time alone will change those practices. Similarly, the nature
of the buyer’s relationship with its suppliers is not related to the level of un-
ethical behavior found in those relationships. Apparently, if purchasing man-
agers or suppliers decide to act unethically, they will do so regardless of the
type of relationship that they have established. Conversely, ﬁrms that choose
to conduct business in an ethical manner will do so regardless of whether the
relationship consists of a one-time transaction, a long-term contract, or a
strategic alliance.
• Buyers that are least satisﬁed with supplier relationship perceive their supplier
to be involved in unethical practices. Buyers were also the least satisﬁed if their
100
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

own organizations were involved in deceitful practices. Although deception
may allow buyers to achieve short-term gains, they will be less satisﬁed with
the relationship in the long run, as suppliers increase prices or refuse to re-
new contracts.
• Buyers that perceive suppliers as being involved in unethical practices also be-
lieve that they are performing less effectively. Buyers begin to wonder whether
suppliers are trying to mask problems with production or quality and believe
that the supplier’s performance is reduced in terms of service and price.

A Supplier Selection and Management Report Cost Control Survey clearly
demonstrates the acceleration in global sourcing activity. This category ex-
perienced the greatest increase among the 25 cost control categories listed
in the survey. A surprisingly strong contingent—almost 20% of purchasing
professionals in the small to midsize classiﬁcation—also cited the practice as
one of their most successful efforts. 
But all is not as perceived in the world of foreign sourcing.
Although most of the
responses to the survey cited the beneﬁts received from moving to offshore
suppliers, many spoke of the challenges and problems that have been en-
countered. Furthermore, they were not conﬁned to the purchasing profes-
sionals in the small and midsize companies. Complaints were also voiced by
those employed in larger organizations. The following comments from prac-
titioners and leading authorities offer answers to the more common prob-
lems cited by readers.
It’s all about culture, and not strictly business as usual.
“Perhaps the most difﬁcult
obstacle to overcome in the global supply chain is the vast array of cultural
norms and ethical frameworks,” reasons Mark A. Crowder, CPM, supply
management specialist at John Deere CWP (Loudon, Tenn.; 423-458-8462).

“Successful interpersonal relationships are a prerequisite for doing busi-
ness internationally,” agrees Albert L. Linderman, president of Interpersonal
Business Solutions, Inc. (St. Paul, Minn.; 612-423-3533). “Cultural bond-
ing and friendship building—not acquaintance building—are indispensable
parts of successful international business relationships,” he told a recent In-
ternational Purchasing Conference of the National Association of Purchas-
ing Management (NAPM; see sidebar).
An ISO-type solution for sourcing relationships?
Based on his own experience
advised at the NAPM conference, Crowder notes, “Different peoples have
far different frames of reference and have been brought up under quite dif-
ferent value systems. However, a global economy will necessitate the for-
mulation of a generally accepted set of ethical norms akin to the push for ISO
quality standards that has swept the global quality management community.”
Leading-edge practitioners and companies will have to drive the process to-
ward aligned ethical standards, he believes.
On building the business process and network for global supply chain management.
Steven M. Purdy, vice president at Herbert W. Davis and Company (Fort
Lee, N.J.; 201-944-5580) comments, “Companies sourcing large portions
of their product lines offshore must seek to establish supply chain manage-
ment business processes and information networks. These will include sup-
port for setting supply chain performance standards, planning extended
supply chain operations, gathering information on products location, pro-
ducing documentation to expedite movement, and reporting on perfor-
mance to standards,” he said at the same NAPM conference.
Determining the total cost is a challenge.
When the supply chain is very long,
Purdy maintains, “it is essential to know what the total cost of getting prod-
uct to the customer will be, or should be.” This is probably the most signif-
icant difference between manufacturing and buying products domestically,
and sourcing globally.
Logistics costs, as an example, are a signiﬁcant controllable element in
purely domestic operations and are being managed more closely than ever,
Purdy cites. “But even locally, getting the data needed to manage well from
third-party service providers is not easy. In offshore operations, it is that
much more difﬁcult.”

Factors for Developing Relationships Internationally
In international relations, certain attitudes and approaches lead to appropriate
behaviors. These include the following:
1. An approach that demonstrates a learner’s posture.
•
Always be observant.
•
Ask questions about the country and culture.
•
Always read and learn something new about the country and cul-
ture, customs, history, religious practices, and political situation.
•
Be willing to make mistakes and learn from them.
•
Remember that your resources are people inside the culture, rather
than just books.
2. An approach of vulnerability and humility that leads to knowing when and
how to ask for help.
•
Note that learning to speak their language is best done socially. 
•
Be able to laugh easily at yourself.
3. Respect for the local culture.
•
Observe, participate and learn; don’t be afraid to take notes (dis-
creetly) about your observations.
•
Learn appropriate greetings and leave-takings (ways of ending a
visit or conversation).
•
Always consider yourself an active learner of the language; it may
be inappropriate sometimes to interrupt and ask for language tips,
but those times are rare.
•
Be willing to adopt customs and local foods, as well as manners of
eating, sitting, standing, and responding.
•
Learn about the appropriate use of personal space in different situ-
ations.
•
Learn about the culture’s use of time, color, numbers, light, and
touch.
4. Care about the friendship.
•
Note that although most businesses do not encourage friendship
building, it is a natural part of business. With international business
it can be even more crucial. Working overseas, you are in a more
dependent, trust-requiring setting. Friendship can make the differ-
ence between success and failure.
•
Seek for culturally appropriate ways to enhance your friendship.

Bendorf & Associates (Monroeville, Pa.; 412-856-4453). Based on client
experience, he outlined the following guidelines for those new to global
sourcing:
1. Select speciﬁc products. A method for evaluation and selection of parts
should be developed. One such methodology includes the following:
• ABC analysis. “Only the A category parts, those usually making up
80% of the dollars, but less than 20% of the parts, should be consid-
ered,” Bendorf advised. “As a general rule there is usually insufﬁcient
savings to justify the cost and risk to go global on items with less than
$100,000 in annual activity.”
• Group by process. Organize the selected parts by manufacturing pro-
cess (casting, stamping, assembly, and so forth).
• Rank by potential savings. Develop potential savings by cost analysis.
• Select parts for request for quote (RFQ). Select one or two of the highest
potential savings parts from each group for the pilot RFQ. 
2. Initiate “come-to-know” analysis. “Most of the difﬁculties in taking
parts made domestically to foreign locations occur because of the many
things that you and the present supplier have ‘come to know’ about the item
that never made it to the drawing or speciﬁcation,” explains Bendorf. “It is
essential that you deﬁne what they are before the RFQ package goes out.”
Hold a come-to-know meeting with everyone who has anything to
do with the part. At this meeting compare actual parts to the drawing and
speciﬁcation, identify inspection methods that must be used by the supplier,
and conﬁrm that the same method and equipment will be used by your
company.
3. Perform supplier evaluation. Many companies place orders with over-
seas suppliers without formal supplier evaluation. However, most experi-
enced international buyers would ﬁnd placing business with overseas sup-
pliers without an on-site evaluation to be unconscionable. Make sure that
the right people go to make the evaluation. “All too often the company’s big-
wigs go and leave behind those who really know the product and are in the
best position to evaluate the supplier,” Bendorf said.
4. Resolve technical, commercial, and quality issues. “A good time to do this
is during the on-site evaluation visit,” Bendorf explains. It is really impor-
tant to resolve these issues in writing even if the supplier’s personnel seem to
have a good grasp of English. Remember, some cultures are reluctant or em-
104
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

barrassed to say that they do not understand you and therefore will agree
even when they are not sure what was said.
5. Order administration. Know the supplier’s production process and
schedule and check frequently for status. “When checking status,” accord-
ing to Bendorf, “be sure to ask questions that can only be answered with
data that would indicate that the particular production step had been com-
pleted.”
6. Maintain country and supplier surveillance. Because the supplier’s ﬁnan-
cial and capacity conditions can change quickly, particularly in developing
countries, it is important to monitor these closely. “Maintain an awareness
of the country’s economics, political issues involving economics and trade,
and currency exchange rates that can change quickly, sometimes overnight,
and affect the price you pay,” Bendorf concluded.

World-class products are no longer sufficient. You now also must be a
supplier of world-class services, managing your customers’ inventory,
marketing, and distribution. In addition, you will be required to provide
your suppliers and even other retailers with information that helps sales
to grow: data on consumers, categories, the product pipeline, and mer-
chandising concepts. To apply these strategies, managers must ensure sys-
tem integration among distant customers, categories, and the production
line.
A new industry report issued by the Voluntary Interindustry Commerce
Standards (VICS; 609-620-4562), Global Retailing in the New Millennium: An
Industry Brieﬁng Paper (order online through the Resource Center link at
retailsystems.com for $395), calls for logistics folks to enact 10 key steps to
achieve global retailing success:
1. Initiate global thinking. Look where you can create synergies across
multinational and transmultinational operations through partnerships with
suppliers, customers, and transportation companies.
2. Focus on delivering customer value. Shift emphasis from product and
process to customer wants and needs and recognize customers’ increasing
awareness and knowledge.

3. Initiate changes in the corporate culture. Start preparing the organization
for changes and new ways of doing things, all in an effort to obtain a cus-
tomer and global focus.
4. Simplify products, processes, and policies. Look for duplication to elimi-
nate and ﬁx situations that interfere with transparency and root out inefﬁ-
ciencies with the help of partners.
5. Implement systems standards. Upgrade systems where necessary and
adopt and implement standards for communications and data exchange. Re-
inforcing this point, Bob Martin, former CEO international at Wal-Mart,
said that global standards have proven their effectiveness for Wal-Mart, which
communicates with more than 8,000 suppliers via EDI and has 5,000 users
on its communication system. In 1998 the company processed 93% of its or-
ders and 85% of its invoices through EDI. In addition, thanks to standards,
Wal-Mart has decreased the lead time for the supply of basic products by 60%
and for the supply of promotional articles by 75% over the last decade.
6. Participate in industry initiatives. Take an active part in various standards
bodies, trade alliances, and globalization forums. Dirk Jager, CEO of Proc-
ter & Gamble, points out that “today our industry needs to establish stan-
dards for information exchange on a global basis. This includes basic EDI
and product identiﬁcation as well as radio frequency identiﬁcation and other
product-embedded electronic components, and the development of a global
industry intranet.”
7. Initiate partnerships and relationships focused on sharing. Participate in
coplanning initiatives with suppliers, customers, and transportation compa-
nies. Implement comanaged inventory and dynamic replenishment. Inte-
grate and synchronize systems.
Ultimately, says Janice H. Hammond, professor at the Harvard Business
School, there is a greater emphasis on cooperation, and the value of coplan-
ning and replenishment far exceeds the risks. “The trust issue has declined
in importance over the past 10 years as companies have recognized that the
beneﬁts of cooperation outweigh the risks.”
8. Explore new business models. Analyze centralized and decentralized
approaches to global retailing and assess grow-your-own and acquisition/
consolidation strategies for global expansion.
9. Reevaluate pricing and terms. Reassess pricing in global terms, simplify
pricing models, unbundle options, understand customer pricing require-
ments, and identify pricing constraints.
106
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

10. Analyze sourcing strategies. Reassess sourcing for global retailing, un-
derstand transportation and logistics constraints, and balance local and cen-
tral sourcing.

Handling domestic logistics issues can be cumbersome enough, but when
your operations are global, the obstacles are even greater. With a solid logis-
tics strategy and an understanding of your priorities, however, international
logistics does not have to be a headache.
Massachusetts-based Polaroid has spent the last two-and-a-half years re-
vising its global distribution network to improve shipping activities to and
from over 20 different countries. Abbott Weiss, vice president of worldwide
logistics for Polaroid, describes three main steps toward overcoming global
logistics obstacles: establish objectives, set a strategy, and understand the bar-
riers to successful implementation.
Establish Primary Objectives
A three-year objective was put in place, focusing on customer service, in-
ventory turns, and operating efﬁciencies, explains Weiss. He recently told
Logicon attendees that these objectives were set around best-in-class stan-
dards. “We got a sense of how good good was and where we were,” he says.
“And we saw that there was room for lots of improvement on our end.”
The objectives were as follows:
• A 95% delivered order ﬁll rate for customers and 90% to all others
• A 50% reduction in items on backorder for more than 10 days
• Doubling of total average inventory turns to 4 by 1999
• An improvement in operating efﬁciencies to 10% in the ﬁrst year, 8%
in the second year, and 6% in the third.
Determine the Logistics Strategy
Weiss says that Polaroid focused on four strategic areas toward improving
global logistics:
International Logistics
107

Strategy 1: Integrate
Here, the company placed an emphasis on the worldwide coordination of
transportation, distribution, production planning, inventory, and freight and
duty management. Historically, explains Weiss, Polaroid’s distribution func-
tion has not focused on global logistics at all. “We were suboptimized be-
cause we were not linking logistics to other departments, such as manufac-
turing,” he says. “Now we look at the entire system and are optimizing
ourselves internally.” 
Negotiating freight rates, in particular, has beneﬁted. By bringing to-
gether freight managers from Europe, Asia, and the United States, the com-
pany has been able to pool purchases for more reasonable freight rates.
Although Polaroid has found a way to integrate its departments inter-
nally, Weiss admits that the ﬁrm is not yet at the point to do the same with
its suppliers and customers.
Strategy 2: Differentiate
The objective here was to tailor distribution and delivery services to meet
the needs of different kinds of customers and product lines in the most prof-
itable manner. Polaroid divided its products into four categories: pipeline,
which are high-volume, low-cost, long-lived, and highly predictable items;
short life cycle goods, which have a market lifetime of less than 18 months;
just-in-time products, which are low-volume, high-cost, long-lived, and
unpredictable; and customized, which are built for an individual customer.
Strategy 3: Rationalize
The warehouse and distribution networks are optimized worldwide to
handle the work that they do inside. For instance, Weiss says that the com-
pany handles a lot of product and handles it well, but handles it too often:
“A total cycle time study of how we process certain products showed us that
we could eliminate unnecessary steps.”
Strategy 4: Flexibility and Agility
Polaroid set out to develop logistics processes that are demand-driven, can
survive fast cycle times, and are ready to deal with unexpected customer re-
quirements. This has proven particularly successful in the area of postpone-
ment, says Weiss. “We used to build to forecasts, which became expensive
and left us with high inventory levels.” By implementing a packaging strat-
egy that would allow Polaroid to stock generic product in the warehouse
108
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

and conﬁgure it based on customer orders at the time of fulﬁllment, the
company realized it could save signiﬁcantly. Weiss says that a third party car-
ries out the postponement activity within Polaroid’s facility.
Overcome Barriers to Implementation
“You will stumble through your objectives and strategies if you haven’t pri-
oritized your goals and you don’t take on too much at once,” warns Weiss.
“You have to constantly revise your plan.”
Polaroid worked through implementation barriers through a variety of
methods. One worth noting is establishing a pilot project. “We wanted to
do direct shipments to Asia from our factory in Massachusetts to save money
and time,” relays Weiss. The company decided to test this out with its digi-
tal products because of their low volume and spiky demand.
Although the concept seemed to work on paper, Weiss says it became
problematic because of customs delays, international paperwork require-
ments, and local carrier issues. As a result, he says that the company re-
vamped the process to attain its time and cost saving goals and still deliver to
Asia in the most efﬁcient manner. It was ultimately decided to ship from the
United States to a local warehouse in the region and then to the customer.
Another way to overcome barriers is through communication. Polaroid
sends an executive summary of its projected goals and actual data to man-
agers throughout the company via e-mail. “This not only lets them see what
is working and what isn’t,” says Weiss, “but it also offers them the oppor-
tunity to see what their role in the process is and how we can all work
together.”
Comparing Objectives to Reality
By following its objectives and strategies, Polaroid has realized improvements
in service levels, network costs, and inventory management, says Weiss. On
a worldwide scale, order ﬁll rates have improved from 89% to 91% in the two-
and-a-half years since beginning the program. Line ﬁll rates have increased
from 85% to 94% during the same time, and $13 million in freight and ware-
housing costs have been removed from the network. Finally, despite a $134
million reduction in inventory, inventory turns have not increased.
“We are competitive, but we are working toward getting even better,”
says Weiss.

Logistics managers looking to control costs should focus ﬁrst on renegotiat-
ing shipping rates, reducing freight costs, and streamlining operations. A re-
cent Managing Logistics survey of hundreds of logistics professionals shows
that working with suppliers and making use of logistics technology are also
hailed among the top ﬁve ways that managers can successfully control costs
(see Figure I-4.1).
Conversely, reducing warehouse storage and inventory costs slipped out
of the number ﬁve spot that it had held in previous surveys—most likely be-
cause the payoff is so much faster on renegotiating rates and because inven-
tory may have been cut as far as possible. With the top ﬁve cost-controlling
methods clearly identiﬁed, then, we asked logistics pros exactly how they
put these techniques to work and the savings they have generated.
Renegotiated Shipping Rates/New Carriers
One of the more prevalent themes to come out of the survey is managers’
desire to concentrate on regional transportation. They say that they are will-
ing to change carriers to meet that goal. “We are using a third-party provider
for truckload and LTL [less-than-truckload] shipments, which has allowed
us to reduce our vendor base, lower costs and increase the number of carri-
ers we use to regional markets,” says the manager of distribution for a spe-
cialty chemical manufacturer in Connecticut.
“We looked at regional carriers who offered faster service,” explains a di-
110

rector of distribution. This reduced Freight All Kinds (FAK) from 85% to
77.5% and reduced transportation costs by 7.5%.
Reduced Transportation/Freight Costs
Whether for domestic or international freight, managers are teaming up
with their carriers to achieve savings. “We convinced our main carrier to im-
plement zone billing without a minimum,” says a national freight logistics
manager in the automotive aftermarket. Per hundredweight, this process
created a 10% cost savings based on $19,000 annual freight cost.
Logistics folks are also teaming up with other departments in their or-
ganizations to facilitate reduced transportation costs. “We are working with
sales personnel to coordinate product delivery, which has saved us $250,000
in freight costs in just ﬁve months,” declares the manager of corporate logis-
tics for a large computer manufacturer in Colorado.
Streamlined Shipping and Receiving
It is apparent that logistics managers have instituted simple but signiﬁ-
cant methods for streamlining their inbound and outbound processes. For

instance, managing dock operations of incoming and outgoing goods as well
as mandating delivery appointments reduced dock-to-stock time from 18
hours to 7.75 hours in just three months for an electrical distribution whole-
saler.
On the outbound side, reusable, compressed airbags for bracing out-
bound chemical shipments will save a New Jersey-based company $50,000
this year, claims its logistics manager. Furthermore, a trafﬁc manager
achieved some good results with a shipping label program. He says that the
outbound error rate went from .16% to .05%, and the incident rate dropped
50% from 22 to 11 per month.
Worked Closely with Suppliers
Logistics managers agree that in working more closely with suppliers they
can generate clearer forecasts, solve supply chain issues, and assess supply
chain processes for improvement. In addition, building a more solid supplier
partnership helped one operations manager gain credibility with his cus-
tomers because he could plan more deﬁnitively for outbound orders.
One supply chain manager says that a tighter supplier partnership is en-
abling his company to produce in a just-in-time environment. “We have
asked raw material vendors for reduced lead time so that production sched-
ules could be based around current sales ﬁgures, enabling us to make exactly
what we need.”
Made Use of Logistics Technology
Clearly, the Internet has had a dramatic impact on logistics operations. From
real-time order tracking to automated export documentation, as one man-
ager puts it, the Internet is freeing up logistics personnel to do more valu-
able work. Just consider the following examples.
“We formed a strategic alliance with a system provider to enable Inter-
net technology for returnable packaging,” says a vice president of operations.
“This enables us to manage large accounts with fewer people and at a lower
cost.” “We are scanning documents and preparing them electronically with
electronic signatures and then e-mailing them to our international for-
warders,” says a distribution manager. “This is a huge improvement over
faxing.”
However, managers have not overlooked the beneﬁts that more tradi-
112

tional technology can offer. One warehouse manager claims that bar coding
made all the difference. “We installed bar coding software that allows for
EDI transmission of our shipment information to the customer. This has re-
duced manual processing by 20%.”

To cut costs, managers need to know exactly what they now spend on ware-
housing, shipping, receiving, order processing, and other key logistics func-
tions. However, most logistics managers frequently encounter major ob-
stacles when attempting to extract this cost information from traditional
management systems.
As a result, many have turned to activity-based costing (ABC). ABC
assigns the activity costs on a consumption basis (cost/output) to the cus-
tomer, product, or supply chain. At a Council of Logistics Management
(CLM) annual meeting, Bernard La Londe, professor emeritus of transpor-
tation and logistics at Ohio State University (614-292-5233) and Terrance L.
Pohlen, chief business analysis division at the Defense Supply Center in Co-
lumbus (616-692-7173), explained that ABC can also analyze how proposed
changes in logistics processes may impact customer service.
Is ABC Too Costly?
The application of ABC to logistics has traditionally lagged behind imple-
mentation in other areas. According to a survey of ABC adoption in the lo-
gistics industry, conducted by La Londe and Pohlen, the level of ABC use
suggests that most of the respondents had considered and made a decision
regarding whether to implement ABC (see Figures I-4.2 and I-4.3). Eigh-
teen percent reported that ABC was completed and in use.
Several reasons were cited for not considering ABC. The primary rea-
son centered on not having sufﬁcient resources to support ABC imple-
mentation. The reported costs for ABC may support this position, as 42%
indicated costs of less than $100,000 with 34% reporting implementation
costs between $100,000 and $500,000; 14% said they could not justify the
cost.

113

ABC Makes Improved Logistics Decisions
Despite the potential start-up costs, ABC continues to gain acceptance.
Most respondents identiﬁed customer proﬁtability as the primary motiva-
tion for implementing ABC. Improved cost information ranked second.
Once implemented, ABC initiatives will beneﬁt logistics, says Pohlen.
“Cost reductions will result, helping to eliminate non-value-added activi-
ties, begin reengineering projects, and outsource those functions not perti-
nent to the organization.
“Logistics can particularly beneﬁt from ABC due to a wide diversity in
the performance of activities and the major differences in how individual
customers or products consume activity outputs,” continues Pohlen. “Cus-
tomers frequently require tailored services to reduce cycle time and costs
or to improve support. The tailoring of logistics services adds additional ac-
tivities and costs to the supply chain. Logistics managers should have the
knowledge to accurately assign these costs to understand how these addi-
tional service requirements impact proﬁtability.”

Obstacles to Implementation
Problems can occur during most ABC implementations. Inadequate ac-
counting systems are most frequently cited as the cause. Technical expertise
and cost driver information appear to be the next most frequently cited
problems. Employees and middle management also represent potential ob-
stacles to ABC implementation.

A decision support system (DSS) is an analysis tool designed to help cut
costs in logistics and distribution operations. By analyzing elements such as
time and costs, this tool allows you to weigh various delivery, inventory,
and warehousing options. Although many logistics managers and software

vendors are singing the praises of DSS, it does not come risk-free. Industry
expert Henrik Danford-Klein, director of network design strategy at Sears
Logistics Services Inc. (847-286-1094), offers advice on avoiding the pitfalls
of DSS.
A Supportive Process
Danford-Klein uses a DSS for supply chain optimization and routing to
Sears stores. At a recent CLM annual meeting, he pinpointed several com-
mon mistakes associated with DSS. The ﬁrst is that logistics managers often
attempt to attack too large of an issue when implementing a DSS.
To remedy this, he recommends breaking DSS goals down into smaller,
more deﬁnable, and more achievable challenges. For example, “Don’t say
‘we want to optimize the whole supply chain,’” he explains. Rather, take the
process piece by piece—by analyzing inventory, for example, and then
transportation and vendor costs.
A critical function of the DSS at Sears Logistics Services is facility uti-
lization. The company uses its DSS, the Supply Chain Designer from Caps
Logistics, to determine which stores to service from which distribution cen-
ters (DCs), where to cross-dock, and which modes of transportation to use.
The software also determines the optimal capacity of each DC as well as their
optimal inventory levels.
According to Caps Logistics, the Supply Chain Designer can also ana-
lyze production allocation, transportation and inventory tradeoffs, and re-
source utilization. Logistics managers can use the DSS to “red ﬂag” costly
procedures. The Supply Chain Designer, for example, is intended to pin-
point costly customers and shipments and underutilized resources.
Behind the Scenes
Because the capabilities and potential beneﬁts of a DSS are so appealing,
many logistics managers dive into DSS implementation headﬁrst. Too of-
ten, they are enticed by the software and do not realize the work that is in-
volved. “Unfortunately, software vendors are forced to present DSS as ‘easy
to use,’” says Danford-Klein. In a technological world that is largely Micro-
soft Windows–based, logistics managers want to point and click their way
through every software program—and every logistics equation.
By its very nature, a DSS is not that simple (see sidebar). “The reality is,
it takes a lot of work,” says Danford-Klein. It also takes a lot of money. Some
116
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

of these systems cost up to a million dollars, and consulting is usually a ne-
cessity. Danford-Klein suggests using a consultant to help build models and
interpret DSS recommendations.
Experience is also a key to success. Not clearly understanding how the
DSS works often causes logistics managers to accept the ﬁrst recommenda-
tion that the DSS makes, with no questions asked. Danford-Klein warns lo-
gistics managers not to rely on the ﬁrst result but rather to analyze the results
by asking questions and posing new scenarios.
When a DSS makes a recommendation, it has optimized a model, not
reality. Although its suggestion may actually be the best route, facility loca-
tion, or customer assignment, you should still determine that for yourself.
“It’s up to you to ﬁgure out what’s real and what’s not,” Danford-Klein
notes. For example, a DSS may suggest making a change that promises to
save your company $10 million dollars. On the surface it would seem silly
not to embrace that change. However, if you dig a little deeper, you would
see that the recommendation might actually cost $5 million to complete.
“Change is often very expensive,” Danford-Klein says. “It’s the 80/20
rule—it costs a lot to make a little change.” Therefore, making a move to
save the company only $5 million may actually cost less and have a higher
payoff in the end.
Seek and Find
What steps should you take when searching for a DSS? First, you should
establish buy-in from executive-level management, Danford-Klein says.
Without it, you won’t be able to accomplish anything. By implementing a

117
Common Mistakes to Avoid When Using a DSS
1. Not understanding how the model is built
2. Accepting recommendations without question
3. Ignoring soft data, such as customer service
4. Making change where change is not good
5. Not establishing senior-level buy-in
6. Failing to clearly deﬁne your goals
7. Failing to rely on experience

DSS, “you’ll be able to suggest things that affect the whole company.” In ad-
dition, there are organizational and people-related issues associated with that
change. The support of senior-level management will ensure that change is
possible.
Next, you should determine exactly what you want to solve with a DSS,
Danford-Klein says. Knowing what you want to accomplish is half the
battle. Keep in mind that a DSS can cost nearly one million dollars—you
don’t want to buy what you don’t need. In addition, ﬂexibility is crucial to
any DSS. You should be able to alter scenarios and make suggestions to
achieve the best possible recommendation.
The most important factor, however, is knowledge. You need to be able
to evaluate the experience of the people you’ll be working with to build the
DSS model, Danford-Klein stresses. “All tools have their limitations.”
Therefore, you should turn to a consultant or hire an in-house expert to
build the models and interpret your DSS results.
Outsourcing the whole DSS analysis is an option, and many third-party
providers offer DSS consultants. However, some organizations opt to hire a
full-time person to support the DSS. Danford-Klein recommends hiring
professionals with backgrounds in operations research or industrial engi-
neering. Sears has done exactly that. In fact, it is such a large organization,
and it places such an emphasis on DSS analysis, that it has four full-time em-
ployees dedicated to DSS.
Keep in mind that using DSS is a learning, reiteration process, says
Danford-Klein. With DSS, you are constantly asking how different scenar-
ios affect logistics costs and customer service.

Supply chain management costs are still on the rise, despite staunch efforts
by logistics professionals to drive them down. The annual Davis Database,
published by Herbert W. Davis and Company (201-944-5580), shows an in-
crease in total logistics costs—up 2.21% as a percent of sales costs and 3.6%
in cost per hundredweight (see Table I-4.1). The costs of value-added ser-
vices, higher inventory levels, and gaps in logistics support caused by enter-
prise resource planning (ERP) solutions largely account for the increase.
Only 30% of the companies participating in the study claim they were
able to reduce costs this past year, according to the Davis Database. These
118
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

were ﬁrms that had signiﬁcant sales increases, excellent inventory perfor-
mance, and control over warehousing and transportation costs, says Bill
Drumm, president of Herbert W. Davis. 
In addition, the average company’s total logistics costs average 7.35% of
sales and $74.29/CWT (see Table I-4.2), with transportation and ware-
housing being the greatest budget eaters. 
Figures I-4.4 and I-4.5 provide cost breakouts as a percentage of sales
and percentage of dollars per hundredweight, respectively.
10 Ways to Reduce Supply Chain Management Costs
In an effort to educate the logistics community about cost drivers and how
to keep them down, Drumm outlines 10 ways to reduce overall supply chain
management costs in a typical logistics operation.
1. Develop or enhance existing vendor managed inventory (VMI) and
just-in-time ( J IT) programs to increase inventory velocity and smooth or-
dering patterns. By developing supply chain partnerships and sharing de-
mand and supply data with vendors and customers, you can smooth the ﬂow
of inventory. You will receive material as you need it instead of buying

periodically in large, ﬁxed lots. This reduces inventory carrying costs, space
requirements, obsolescence, damage, spoilage, and shrinkage. When prop-
erly managed, these programs result in inventory reduction beneﬁts for cus-
tomers and suppliers.
2. Use electronic commerce to reduce transaction processing costs
and cycle times. Transferring data between companies electronically, in-
stead of in hard copy, decreases labor, time, and the potential for error and

speeds up the processing cycle. This results in reduced costs and improved
service.
3. Centralize forecasting and inventory planning functions using fore-
casting and planning experts. In a multiplant/DC environment, demand
forecasting, inventory planning, and production planning should be done
centrally. The people doing the work should have a corporate perspective in
balancing supply and demand across the supply chain and across the company.
4. Use optimizer software to create a production schedule that consid-
ers the optimal balance of proﬁtability, customer service, total asset manage-
ment, and capacity utilization. The model may propose alternatives for best
service, lowest overall cost, lowest inventory, and best use of materials.
5. Continually review the cost of adding manufacturing capacity or
outsourcing against the cost of building and holding inventory. Companies
should continually review their success in meeting seasonal requirements
with reasonable inventory levels. Techniques such as ﬂexible manufacturing,
core teams supplemented with temporary help, contract manufacturing, and
outsourcing to meet peak period demand should be considered.
6. Condense your supply chain by carefully locating your manufactur-
ing and distribution points to serve the market as efﬁciently as possible. Per-
form a formal network study based on historical shipping patterns to deter-
mine objectively the optimum number and placement of facilities.
7. Integrate production planning, inventory planning, customer ser-
vice, and distribution and transportation functions to improve information
availability, reduce inventory, and improve service. For these functions to
work well together to service customers, they should be located together in
a central logistics organization.
8. Identify and target nonproﬁtable customers and product lines to in-
crease margins or eliminate that business. Customer and product proﬁtabil-
ity analysis should be performed regularly, and action should be taken to
prune the line and possibly drop low-end customers. Total proﬁt contri-
bution over time should be examined. Unproﬁtable customers should be
built up, charged sufﬁciently, or dropped. Unproﬁtable products should
be dropped unless necessary to satisfy key customers who are proﬁtable
overall or to offer a full product line.
9. Evaluate the feasibility of outsourcing all or part of your supply chain
operation and use functional experts from the outside when they can save
you money.

scale, downsize, and reduce transaction costs.

Access to shipment status, price quotations, and modal reservations is get-
ting easier, cheaper, and faster for logistics and transportation managers
thanks to new and improved Web sites from carriers. To help you navigate
this rapidly expanding e-terrain, here are some of the top sites.
Carriers Make Web Improvements
Yellow Freight System has responded to customer demand for a more use-
ful Web site, giving customers access to information that will help them to
manage shipping activity better. Key changes include improved information
groups for tracking, shipping, accessing bills of lading, or receiving proofs of
delivery, as well as the ability to see zip-to-zip standards. Yellow will soon be
introducing online rate quotes that include personal pricing based on a cus-
tomer’s individual shipping needs and speciﬁcations.
Emery Worldwide has also added new technology to its Web site (www.
emerywold.com) to simplify site navigation. The system, called eService
Portals with SuperFAQs, gives customers access to general questions that re-
quire some consultation before a speciﬁc answer is given. Customers click
on the FAQ button and are engaged in a short interactive session. The ex-
pert search engine gathers information from the Web visitor in order to de-
liver a tailored answer.
In addition, the portal will enable Emery customers to download and
save documents, route e-mail inquiries to assigned specialists, and return to
the portal to check on inquiries or review previous inquiries. Emery has also
made its ImPower program available at its Web site. The program monitors
shipments cleared by Emery’s U.S.-based customs brokerage ofﬁces, pro-
viding detailed cargo reports and entry and billing information.
American Freightways Corp. (www.af.com) has also made signiﬁcant
additions to its interactive Web site. The new features are color-coded ser-
vice maps and through rates between U.S. and Canadian points. The tools
provide customers information about how long it will take for freight to ar-
122
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

rive at its destination, allowing more control over inventory management,
procurement, and distribution.
Carrier and Shippers Benefit with E-System
The Hub Group, Inc., has launched an e-business system called the Vendor
Interface (www.hubgroup.com) for managing the drayage portion of inter-
modal freight shipments. The Interface is designed to eliminate redundancy,
improve operational efﬁciency, and enable order processing around the
clock.
Shippers beneﬁt by having access to increased information throughout
the supply chain and can take advantage of the satellite-like communications
and tracking. The carrier beneﬁts because the new system enables it to pro-
cess completed orders faster, resulting in more timely payments. The system
enables Hub to identify appropriate carriers for each shipment based on cost,
dates, location, and cargo. Shipments are offered to carriers, terms are set,
and deliveries are authorized—all online.
Site Searches Rail Line
Emons Transportation Group, Inc., a rail freight transportation and dis-
tribution services company, has launched its new Web site, www.
emonstransportation.com. The site allows customers to evaluate the advan-
tages of locating manufacturing or distribution facilities on one of Emons’
railroads. Customers can also use Emons’ transload or intermodal services
for companies not located on the rail line. In addition, the site includes links
to industrial development agencies, distribution and warehouse facilities,
and vendors.
Maritime Shipping Made Easier
GoCargo.com is a new Web site that aims to improve the efﬁciency of in-
ternational marine shipping. The site can be described as an international ex-
change that allows importers and exporters to avoid shopping around by
phone and fax for the best deal to move their goods. The shippers simply en-
ter the parameters of their payload, the destination, any time constraints, and
then allow the carriers to compete for their business.
“Say a shipping company proposes $1,200 per container and it will take

123

15 days, and they say they will use rail service for part of the shipping pro-
cess,” explains Eyal Goldwerger, chief executive of GoCargo Inc. (New
York) explains. “Another provider might say that his price is $900 per con-
tainer, but it will take 18 days. The customer may decide that he or she wants
the cheaper price even though it will take three more days. We allow the
customer to put their own weight on the different parameters. Thanks to the
Internet, customers can ﬁnd out at the last minute if there is room for their
goods on a ship,” says Goldwerger.
Another maritime site is ShipAhead.com, a joint venture of Cognicase
Inc. and ShipAhead Inc. This e-business-enabled Internet portal brings to-
gether cargo carriers, shippers, seaports, and others in the maritime industry.
Shippers, shipping lines, ports, and cargo transporters can ﬁnd and post in-
formation about selling and buying cargo as well as about chartering vessels,
ports, businesses, and schedules. The service is also useful for locating sup-
pliers around the world.
Orient Overseas Container Line Ltd. (OOCL) of Pleasanton, Calif., has
launched an online rate inquiry service, which allows customers to obtain
rate quotations by completing an electronic form at www.oocl.com. Ship-
pers are asked to provide cargo description, ports of origin and destination,
shipping requirements, and contact details. In addition, shippers can retrieve
tariff rates on the OOCL site, which are provided by E-Transport Inc.
(www.e-transport.com) of Pittsburgh. 
Making Cargo Reservations
Tafp, Inc., in Queens, N.Y., has introduced a Web-based cargo reservation
system called Cargo4less.com. The service is targeted at exporters looking
for discounted freight rates on airport-to-airport international shipments.
Through a Web-based form, users indicate a speciﬁc dollar amount that
they are willing to pay to have their freight transported. Users must give a
description of the cargo, including size and weight (Tafp will accept freight
weighing at least 100 kilos), and must specify when it is ready to ship. No
hazardous, perishable, or restricted cargo is accepted. Users are notiﬁed
within 24 hours if their offer is accepted.
Shippers can also make reservations and obtain price quotes from a new
Internet freight shipping service called ShipHere.com. It allows companies
to purchase freight services without the need to set up or have an existing
account with a carrier. ShipHere.com will automatically select from a port-
124
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

folio of national, regional, and local freight and parcel carriers to offer the
best rates and modes of transportation available.
Users simply ﬁll out a brief form that captures information about their

For customers who make frequent shipments, ShipHere.com can memorize
shipment information to save time and minimize data entry.
Using United Airlines Cargo’s Web-based service (www.ualcargo.com),
which replaces its dial-up cargo, can also save time. From the site, registered
users can obtain shipment-tracking information, access ﬂight status infor-
mation, and create and modify cargo reservations online.
Customizable Web Pages
Two new customizable Web pages have been released for the transportation
industry: myABF from ABF Freight System, Inc., in Fort Smith, Ark., and
my.roadway.com from Roadway Express in Akron, Ohio. MyABF allows
customers to manage a variety of transportation tools and shipment infor-
mation and create links to other Internet sites. Users can trace shipments via
carrier pro number, bill of lading number, purchase order number, or other
customer reference number. The site can also create detailed reports, obtain
customer-speciﬁc pricing quotations, view and retrieve critical documents,
and learn the status of loss and damage claims.
My.roadway.com enables customers to access real-time shipment infor-
mation and customize their data output. The service also provides information
on standards and pricing data as well as the ability to inquire and track re-
sponses relating to freight bill invoicing or rating issues. Users can also obtain
rate quotes, status reports, proof of delivery, and cargo claims status reports.
Up and Coming Web Sites 
Cargo data will soon be obtainable through DHL Airways, Inc., which will
offer customers online fulﬁllment services, thus becoming the ﬁrst inter-
national carrier with the capability to quote customers the true cost of de-
livery for international shipments, the company claims. Using a landed
cost engine, DHL (www.dhl.com) will be able to calculate the tariffs, duties,
and other additive charges associated with international shipments over the
Internet.

Recent price increases from parcel carriers such as Federal Express, RPS,
and Airborne leave logistics managers questioning if there is any way to save
money on freight bills. The good news is that you still can, and if you are
creative, you can save upwards of 20%. Here’s how.
Eight Tips for Saving Money
The following techniques will save you more than 20% on your next trans-
portation bill, according to Mark Taylor, president and CEO of Taylor Sys-
tems Engineering Corp. (Plymouth, Mich.; 734-420-7447). Start now and
1. Hire a professional to negotiate your rates. “These folks have usually
worked for the carriers in a past life, so they are familiar with their pricing
strategies,” says Taylor. Professional negotiators typically charge you based
on what they can save you—usually half of the savings.
2. Claim your guaranteed service failures. Carriers such as UPS, RPS, Fed-
eral Express, and Airborne have a money-back guarantee that their packages
will arrive on time. Most shippers do not track packages to check guarantees
or collect refunds due. By regularly auditing your freight bills, you can rou-
tinely save 5% off your shipping charges. To do this, log onto the carriers’
Web sites or use an online tracking service such as www.shippingrefunds.
com.
3. Research association discounts. Many times, shippers can get discounts
of 10% to 20% as a beneﬁt of belonging to a trade association. Taylor cau-
tions, however, that the carriers will not volunteer which associations they
offer discounts for, so do your homework—check with the associations of
which you are a member.
4. Do not use the carrier’s insurance. Using an alternative private insurance
company can save you as much as 65% on your premium.
126
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

5. Avoid using only one carrier. The UPS strike two years ago is a good rea-
son why. Don’t fall for carriers offering free shipping systems. Shop around.
FedEx and Airborne are aggressively looking to attract small- and medium-
sized customers and are offering signiﬁcant discounts on overnight and air
services. 
6. Renegotiate with the carrier. If you opt to negotiate rates yourself, Tay-
lor recommends that you ﬁrst consider the volume that you ship on a regu-
lar basis—the larger the volume, the greater the discount you receive.
Also, realize that there is a war out there for market share among the
carriers and that they are looking for ways to be more competitive, he contin-
ues. “It is possible for you to negotiate anywhere from 10% to 20% discounts,”
says Taylor. He suggests using those savings to help justify investments in tech-
nology that will help your logistics department run more efﬁciently.

Compare Rates on Your Own
The computerized shipping systems on the market today offer an array of fea-
tures meant to help you save money on your freight bill, such as those in the
following recommended solutions:
Resource, Inc. (800-818-0492) offers Partner, Partner Express, and Win-
dows Express. These feature track time and day of delivery, shipping conﬁr-
mation receipt, encrypted carrier costs, and rate comparisons. Partner Ex-
press, which is a shipping-only package, includes domestic and international
rates for UPS, USPS, and Federal Express. A 386 CPU or higher, DOS 5.0
or higher, and at least 40MB of available hard drive space are required to op-
erate Partner and Partner Express. Windows Express requires a Pentium 166
or higher, Windows 95 C or Windows 98, 32M RAM, and 400MB of avail-
able hard drive space.
Freight Plus (909-678-4522) offers the Freight Plus Shipping Manifest
System for Windows 95/98 and NT. The package calculates all UPS, RPS,
USPS, and Federal Express shipping services: ground, air, international, hun-
dredweight, ground saver, and insurance from inside your accounting system.
Freight Plus can be customized to your company’s speciﬁc needs.
F.C. Rock & Associates (www.fcrock.com) offers the E-2000 shipping sys-
tem for carrier rate shopping and carrier rate changes and updates. The system
runs on the IBM 36X and AS/400 as well as on other mainframe computers.
Kewill E Commerce (877-TRACERX) offers the ClipperShip multicar-
rier shipping system. This system shops for rates, tracks, and generates man-
agement reports for charge-back purposes.

7. Use computerized shipping systems (CSSs). CSSs, for example, let you
compare carrier rates. These are a much better option than the free systems
that carriers offer, which do not allow you to make rate comparisons, says
Taylor. There are several CSSs on the market today (see sidebars).
8. Know the resources available to you. According to Taylor, shipping man-
agers are hit hard by rate increases because they do not know what resources
are available to ensure they do not fall victim to carriers. “They have no way

E-Business Shipping Rate Concerns
Parcel carriers’ price increases are now threatening the Internet logistics com-
munity. E-merchants under pressure for improved business performance need
to cover costs of shipping merchandise. 
Considering the youthful history of e-business, there is no industry-
standard formula for calculating shipping costs. Merchants wind up absorbing
the shipping charges as part of the retail price, charging a ﬂat fee for shipping
to all destinations, adding a handling charge to cover shipping costs, e-mailing
the shipping charges to the consumer who is then likely to cancel the order,
or linking to the carrier’s Web site for downloading one rate at a time, based
on the consumer’s choice of shipping method.
Why is it so hard to provide comparative rates online at the time of pur-
chase? The answer lies in the complexity of rate charts of each carrier, which
may contain hundreds of entries, and they are changed on a regular basis. In
addition, software vendors have been challenged by delivering a solution that
would integrate with any merchant’s order form and shopping cart program;
calculate shipping costs from various distribution points; compare pricing dis-
plays to consumers, including carriers, service levels, delivery times, and ship-
ping costs; and display point to point charges.
There are now partial solutions that automate rate tables for a single car-
rier or allow limited comparison shopping. There are also enterprise solutions
that bundle rate comparisons with complete warehouse and shipping systems.
One thing is certain: Competitive forces are coming to bear on shipping
costs, and solutions are essential to winning customers and earning their loy-
alty, says Neal Anstadt, president and CEO of GoShip (Laguna Niguel, Calif.;
949-360-5858), a software designer and marketer of shipping systems. 
Anstadt further believes that shipping costs will be a major factor in com-
petition for online customers once merchants gain control of information and
truly understand their costs. He says that they will be able to make intelligent
decisions about when to mark down charges on commodity items and deter-
mine where competition is most intense, and about when to mark up charges
on big-ticket items where handling costs are higher and shipping is a small
percentage of the total.

of benchmarking the rates they should be getting,” he says. “Most think they
are getting a good deal, but unfortunately many are not.”
Catching the Carrier in the Act
Even if you adhere to these guidelines, you may not see any rate decrease or
refunds. For instance, if you use a carrier’s guaranteed delivery service and
deserve a refund because of untimely delivery, you may be in for a ﬁght. Tay-
lor says that you still have to pay for the service upfront and then wait for the
rebate, which can take a long time. “Carriers make these promises for re-
funds, but don’t want you to hold them to a clock,” says Taylor. “The only
way you will get your money back is if you catch them.”

Tired of the time-consuming and painstaking practice of negotiating rates
with your carriers? Well, good news is here. The process is getting easier and
faster for logistics managers who turn to online transportation exchanges and
e-marketplaces (see sidebar). Shippers gain access to a variety of service pro-
viders and can literally arrange delivery contracts within 24 hours. “E-
marketplaces will bring shippers and carriers together in an otherwise frag-
mented industry and enable them to collaborate on transportation planning
and logistics execution,” says Kr. Jun-Sheng Li, chairman, president, and CEO
of Transplace.com.
The closing gap is evidenced by the fact that shippers like to access in-
formation from multiple carriers at one location. Fifty-eight percent of re-
spondents to a recent industry study said that a marketplace is the most valu-
able online resource, compared to 14% for a carrier’s proprietary site. Eight
percent prefer no site at all; 6% were unsure; and 4% prefer other types of
sites. “Shippers are not different from customers in any segment of the econ-
omy: They value choice,” says John Urban, president and CEO of Tradiant,
an e-commerce solution provider. “An online marketplace is the most desir-
able option because it enables customers to make more informed decisions.”

handle their freight, shippers are using online marketplaces to speed up the

Exchanges to Check Out
Tradiant.com represents over 25 carriers. Shippers communicate their shipping
requirements through an online request for proposal (RFP). The carriers re-
spond with pricing information and the features and services important to the
shippers. 
Transplace.com is a one-stop supermarket for transportation solutions, in-
cluding truckload, intermodal, package/parcel, LTL, refrigerated, air, cartage,
and home delivery. The exchange supports seasonal/peak requirements as
well as spot capacity.
The National Transportation Exchange (NTE; www.nte.net) e-commerce
marketplaces bring shippers and their trading partners together for trans-
portation optimization and greater supply chain visibility of products. 
Transportation.com, set to launch in the second quarter of 2000, will fea-
ture transportation management, asset management, and consultancy services
for shippers, carriers, and private ﬂeet operators.
QuoteShip.com (212-931-6138) connects shippers and transportation
providers. It enables shippers to manage spot quotes on 10 or more shipments
from various carriers. At the close of the bid deadline, the shipper views a
private bid screen showing the results. After the shipper books the shipment,
QuoteShip notiﬁes the consignee about the provider selected, the airbill
numbers, and expected ﬂights. The shipper prints and keeps a record of the
spot price. The whole process takes about two minutes.
CargoFinder.com is a central information marketplace where both offers
and inquiries of freight capacity are being exchanged. Commission-free trans-
actions and cost-saving opportunities are potential beneﬁts to shippers.
Eurotrans.com is a working tool meant to help professional European
freight haulers ﬁnd freight to haul, ﬁnd someone to haul it, or even ﬁnd the
adequate vehicle for hauling it. Eurotrans also offers to its members the pos-
sibility to create their own private exchange, working only with a selected list
of partners.
Bid Freight.com is a centralized, real-time information service that com-
municates shipment information among shippers, carriers, and consignees. It

contract process. Rather than making several telephone calls to do bid com-
parisons and set up a delivery contract, shippers merely compare rates online
and can decide in seconds with whom they want to do business. The survey
points out that shippers want quicker carrier responses for quotes and con-
tracts. They seek an average of only three to four quotes per spot transaction
and two to ﬁve carriers for service contracts. Slow response time is the most
frequently cited reason why shippers do not get more quotes or contract of-
fers via fax and phone.
A Struggle to Differentiate
Deregulation in the transportation community gave carriers the opportunity
to differentiate themselves from competitors through value-added services.

OpenShip.com is a domestic shipping exchange. By facilitating competi-
tive bidding and open information ﬂow, OpenShip provides shippers with
signiﬁcant savings and access to scarce carrier resources during peak shipping
periods. Shipments are awarded to the most competitive, qualiﬁed carriers.

carriers are improving sales force productivity by using e-commerce to re-
spond to new business opportunities and to reach a larger market more efﬁ-
ciently.
Carrier efforts to communicate unique service features and brand have
had limited success with shippers, despite the competitive environment cre-
ated by deregulation. Sixty-four percent say that a carrier’s brand is either not
important or only somewhat important, compared to 36% who say that it is
a very important part of their selection criteria.
“The survey found there are signiﬁcant opportunities for shippers, for-
warders, and carriers to increase proﬁtability, streamline business processes,
and enhance their competitive positioning by taking full advantage of the ar-
rival of e-commerce,” says Urban. “However, the ﬁndings suggest the trans-
portation industry is operating the same way it has traditionally, with pro-
tracted contract negotiations and a reliance on low-tech solutions.”
Steering Clear of Technology
The survey detected the shipping community’s slow adoption of Internet
marketplaces. Nearly 60% of the shippers and forwarders surveyed still
arrange freight transportation services with carriers during a single, hectic
contracting season that typically lasts four to six weeks. Almost half said that
the process is less than satisfactory because it is time-consuming. Urban says,
“Competition and technology are creating a golden age for opportunity for
the global transportation industry, but many are adapting slowly. Only a frac-
tion of shippers use technology to spread out service contracting across the
year to rationalize the transportation procurement process.” This, however,
is expected to change as industry consultants predict that by 2002, supply
chain services are expected to be 50% of a $300 billion e-commerce market.

Outsourcing, usually anathema to logistics managers, is often the lowest-cost
route to go, especially in a newly spun-off company. One company that has
recently undergone such as change is BCcomponents, a spin-off of Philips
Electronics. The passive manufacturer did this successfully by making the
decision to outsource its logistics functions. 
When BCcomponents spun off from Philips Electronics 18 months ago,
132
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

the manufacturer had to ﬁgure out how to deliver products efﬁciently to
customers without getting weighted down with a costly bricks-and-mortar
logistics and warehousing operation. After months of research, the Nether-
lands-based company decided to farm out U.S. logistics to UPS Logistics
Group (UPS LG; Atlanta, Ga.; 770-206-4100).
“Our core competency is manufacturing parts, not moving inventory,”
says Bob Gourdeau, BCcomponents’ vice president of sales for the Amer-
icas. “We knew outsourcing was going to be a challenge, but we think in the
long term, this is the way to go.”
Laying the Groundwork
Before UPS LG could take over the logistics functions, BCcomponents had
to streamline some internal processes. For example, plans were being made
to change where parts from global factories entered the United States and
cleared customs. Also, the frequency with which parts could be shipped to
customers had to be increased.
In addition, the company products had been routed through Miami,
then put on a truck and driven to an El Paso, Texas–based warehouse owned
by Philips. That practice had two serious ﬂaws, Gourdeau says. First, the
drive between south Florida and west Texas took several days and con-
tributed to a two-week delivery cycle. The company’s delivery times con-
ﬂicted with the just-in-time delivery model for which customers were clam-
oring, Gourdeau says. And because the products were in transit for a certain
length of time, BCcomponents had to maintain higher levels of inventory in
order to meet demand pulls from vendor managed inventory programs. The
second ﬂaw in the company’s practices was that because BCcomponents was
no longer in the Philips fold, the company had to ﬁnd a way to stand on its
own warehousing feet.
The New Arrangement
Under the UPS LG arrangement, logistics provider Bax Global Inc. delivers
products from the company’s non-U.S. factories directly to Dallas. Customs
are cleared in the air, and UPS LG receives the goods and stores and distrib-
utes them from its Dallas warehouse. From there, the goods are forwarded
to BCcomponents’s customers in the Americas via a customer-selected car-
rier. Products from the company’s U.S. plant in Columbia, S.C., are still
shipped directly to customers. 
Controlling Logistics Costs
133

Foreseeing the Benefits
UPS LG estimates that it will manage the warehousing, packing, labeling, and
delivery of more than 100,000 orders from BCcomponents per year. “The
operation will go from a manual inventory system to our warehouse man-
agement system, which uses radio frequency scanner technology to monitor
the location and movement of goods at any point in the delivery process,” says
John Sutthoff, UPS LG’s chief operating ofﬁcer. Some beneﬁts that BCcom-
ponents foresees are reducing lead times, improving customer service levels,
cross-docking delivery, enhanced warehousing techniques, and lowering on-
the-shelf inventory levels through increased visibility.
Gourdeau believes that the new setup will cut delivery cycle time from
about two weeks to 72 hours, track exact location of devices in a shipping
pattern, and use bar coding to get an accurate picture of inventory levels at
the UPS warehouse.
Well Worth the Effort
Going through this extensive overhaul did not come without headaches,
Gourdeau acknowledges. Although the company did notify customers of
the changeover and prepackaged product as much as was possible before the
transition, the manufacturer did miss some of its customers’ shipping dates.
There were also some hurdles associated with integrating BCcomponents’s
back-end systems with UPS LG’s warehouse management platform. “Is
there ever a good time to make a switch like this?” asks Gourdeau. “Prob-
ably not. But we are willing to bite the bullet on these short-term issues to
put in a better solution for the future.”

Logistics managers report in an exclusive Managing Logistics survey that bet-
ter inventory control is one of the best ways they found in the past year to
reduce costs. The survey highlights a variety of methods that managers use
and the outstanding savings that they have incurred.
Review Inventory Data
It may sound obvious, but managers reveal that regularly benchmarking and
analyzing inventory data helps to identify where cuts can be made and pro-

ductivity improved. “Our biggest gain in reducing inventory costs was by
taking an aggressive approach through quarterly reviews,” says the director
of logistics/distribution for a toy manufacturer. “We forecasted a strong
schedule with our factories to increase inventory turns.”
“We rely on a cross-functional team of purchasing, production plan-
ning, logistics, and sales to periodically review obsolete inventories,” says a
logistics manager for an automotive lighting company in Ohio. “This was a
$300,000 reduction from $6.5 million worth of material inventory.”
Some logistics pros ﬁnd that inventory analysis helps them place more
informed orders with suppliers and keep the supply chain clutter free. “We
aggressively pursued a program to reduce printed material inventory,” says a
director of logistics for a compact disc manufacturer in North Carolina. “We
analyzed reorder points and historical data on sales trends and reset safety
stock levels, and we encouraged better on-time delivery performance from
key suppliers to create a more dependable supply stream. Overall, we took
over $1 million out of inventory without compromising the customer ser-
vice performance level, and closer monitoring will ensure future smaller
buys of printed materials.”
Vendor-Managed Programs
Forging closer relationships with suppliers to control inventory costs also
came up as a clear winner with managers. They maintain that improved
communication between the logistics department and suppliers is essential
in keeping customers happy. “We developed vendor relationships to store
and ship products for our company from their facility, reducing inventory
and associated costs while maintaining equal levels of customer service,” says
a manager.
Supplier-managed inventory programs are also keeping managers on
track with their just-in-time production strategies. “We implemented
supplier-managed inventory, whereby suppliers deliver materials based on a
ﬁxed schedule no more than 24 hours in advance of a production schedule,”
explains a supply chain manager in Minnesota. “Materials are to the exact
quantities, which eliminates storage and rehandling. Materials move directly
to production areas when they arrive. This has eliminated $25 million of in-
ventory, increased turns from 10.9 to 33.2 in 18 months, and reduced ware-
house space by 50%, resulting in the closing of an 110,000-square-foot
warehouse.”
“We reduced inventory carrying costs by implementing an inbound raw
material hub, using a third party to manage it,” says a supply chain manager

for a large photographic products manufacturer. “Material is now managed
by suppliers and consigned until we use it, resulting in multimillion dollar
annual savings.”
Plan and Forecast
Warehouse management systems, MRP, DRP, and inventory management
programs continue to be the mainstay of technology on which managers rely
to control inventory costs. The results have been signiﬁcant for some managers.
“We have tremendously improved our supply chain management by re-
ducing inventory,” explains a plant manager for a small company in Ohio.
“We now use forecasting analysis to identify bottlenecks and constraints and
rely on cross docking at our outside warehouse locations to reduce storage
costs. We have reduced our inventory by over $500,000, thus increasing
working capital.”
“We better understand how to use our distribution replenishment sys-
tem to plan product orders,” says the senior vice president of corporate lo-
gistics for a retail home furnisher in New York. “We are now able to reach
97% customer service level with the same or less inventory. And, we reduced
on-hand inventory by 16% without any determination of ﬁll rates.”
In the realm of the cyberworld, logistics managers are ﬁnding success
with Internet-based software to reduce the amount of inventory in their sys-
tems. “We implemented a new Internet-based order system that reduces
cycle time and improved overall ordering efﬁciencies, which has lowered the
amount of inventory in our system,” says the director of supply chain plan-
ning for a beer manufacturer.
Revamp Transportation Schedule
Although not many managers reported that a shift in delivery schedules had
an impact on their inventory levels or costs, the logistics manager for a small
supplier of automotive replacement glass obtained savings. “We have re-
duced inventory costs by increasing the frequency of deliveries. This was a
$500,000 savings in one quarter with less than $100,000 increase in freight
costs, and inventory was scaled down to allow quicker turns.”
Reviewing the Numbers
Each of the methods just mentioned for slashing inventory costs was identi-
ﬁed by managers in all types of industries and in all sizes of companies. It is
136
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

interesting to note, however, that companies with over 500 employees have
focused more on reducing inventory carrying costs over the past year than
have their smaller counterparts, whereas companies with fewer than 500
employees look more at working with suppliers to hold inventory and in re-
ducing inventory costs overall (see Table I-4.3).
When one compares inventory cost reduction practices among indus-
tries, the industrial manufacturing sector has made the most strides in the last
12 months in working with suppliers to facilitate vendor-managed inventory
programs and in reducing overall inventory costs (see Table I-4.4). The con-
sumer manufacturing market pulls ahead in reducing inventory-carrying
costs, whereas the logistics/transportation sector does not take the lead in
any one area.
We deduce from the data that the industrial manufacturing market has
done a better job of handling inventory. This category comprises the auto-
motive and high-tech markets, which historically have led the way in
streamlining their supply chains and eliminating excess inventory and its as-
sociated costs from the network.
As one respondent so clearly states: “For the high-tech and automotive
industries, the focus is always on inventory carrying costs. Service providers
in these areas must continually analyze the inventory process to achieve the
necessary reductions.”

Improving customer satisfaction is a critical process in realizing logistics and
corporate objectives. To do this, people from logistics, sales and marketing,
and ﬁnance must work together to fulﬁll customer expectations. 3M under-
took such an endeavor by reengineering its Customer Satisfaction Improve-
ment Process (CSIP); as a result, the company has cut costs signiﬁcantly and
has improved customer satisfaction.
Such paybacks result from changes such as the following: (a) reengi-
neered front-end order entry/demand generation in striving to be “one
voice” to the customer, cutting across all business units; (b) increased re-
sponsibilities of customer service personnel who have more respected jobs
as team leaders in managing customer relationships; (c) information tech-
nology–based processes to enable improved trading partner communica-
tions; and (d) improved methods to capture customer satisfaction feedback
to recognize rapid changes in customer and competitive activities, even on
a multinational basis.
CSIP at 3M
3M develops customer relationships as part of its long-term business strategy,
explained Dennis S. Fabozzi, director of Logistics Customer Service and
Customer Order Fulﬁllment Process Leader at 3M (St. Paul, Minn.; 651-
736-4094), at a CLM meeting. The company realized that if it could earn or
maintain a customer relationship for seven years, the customers would not
leave. Conversely, when a customer does leave 3M, the ﬁrm observes a di-
rect decrease in contribution to proﬁts of 18%. Knowing this, the company
has made customer service a top priority.
“3M’s customer service mission is to manage each customer contact
such that either a legitimate sales opportunity is realized or customer loyalty
is improved,” said Fabozzi. 3M uses key result areas (KRAs) to monitor the
results of customer interchange. KRAs include customer satisfaction, sales
growth, productivity improvement, transaction speed, and customer reten-
tion and loyalty.
The customer service strategy for 3M revolves around two key areas:
ﬁrst, supply chain management processes and customer service manage-
ment; second, customer segmentation and procurement practices. The cus-
tomer should not suffer because 3M is a multinational, multidivisional,
138
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

multiproduct ﬁrm. Therefore, 3M uses many business groups to tailor ser-
vice for distinct market segments with the goal that 3M will be one voice to
the customer who buys from these multiple 3M business units.
The Customer Service Representative Role
Customer relationship management processes were instituted at 3M so that
customer service representatives (CSRs) are market-focused instead of
product-focused. 3M recognized that customer relationship management
processes must be developed to ﬁt customers’ needs and goals and not be fo-
cused only on 3M processes.
Performance expectations and compensation tiers for 3M CSRs and
managers include responsibilities for growing account business. CSRs en-
able order/replenishment satisfaction but also become accountable to cus-
tomers as the one voice. Policies and ground rules are in place so that sales
personnel do not overrule the authority of CSRs. Much of CSR perfor-
mance is measured on how well CSRs meet customer expectations. 
Managing Specific Accounts
The key difference in the role of the CSR has been the transition from sat-
isfying transactions from any number of customers to managing speciﬁc cus-
tomer accounts. CSRs must be fully knowledgeable of speciﬁc customer
needs, of the range of 3M’s products and service offerings, and of the tools
required to match the needs and products. Also, CSRs go on-site at key cus-
tomers to address needs to make improvements. CSRs must have excellent
communication skills and problem-solving agility. 
Adapting the Model
To be effective in your organization, the CSIP process must be adapted to
the business culture of how your ﬁrm interacts with customers in determin-
ing orders and replenishments. Following are some key questions in assess-
ing the culture:
• Is the ﬁrm a cost-driven ﬁrm or a ﬁrm that values logistics and supply
chain relationships as a means to competitive advantage?
• Is the ﬁrm customer-driven or customer-focused?
Controlling Logistics Costs
139

• Is the ﬁrm committed to listening to the customer?
• Is the ﬁrm programmed to speak to customers in one voice?
• How is the ﬁrm structured in relation to logistics and supply chain
initiatives?
• How are logistics and customer service functions organized across
product lines and business units?
• How committed is the ﬁrm to its employees and customer service re-
lationships?
• Are the ﬁrm’s logistics and customer service operations aligned with
the ﬁrm’s mission, vision, and targeted key result areas?
Analyzing the Customer Service Function
After you have determined the culture of your ﬁrm, the next step is to con-
duct a detailed analysis of your company’s customer service function and the
customer service orientation of the ﬁrm’s other functional activities. Here
are some typical questions asked during this phase of CSIP:
• Are cross-functional teams used to service customers and trading
partners?
• What roles are CSRs performing in relation to changing customer
mixes and requirements?
• How prevalent is the use of outsourcing in the ﬁrm, and what are the
degrees of communications and control in relation to the ﬁrm’s cus-
tomers?
• What key metrics are used to measure customer satisfaction, and how
do these metrics relate to CSR performance?
• Are CSRs insulated from customer feedback?
• Is the ﬁrm striving to implement CSIP methods at the attainment of
“perfect orders” and “perfect shipments”?
• What methods are used to communicate with customers?
• How does the ﬁrm value CSRs?
• What are CSRs responsibilities, and how is performance evaluated
and rewarded, and at what levels of compensation relative to job re-
sponsibilities?
• Who champions the process as CSIP is implemented?

If you’re looking for a grand strategy on how to rebuild a supply chain plan
from ground zero, Caterpillar’s North American track operation is a great
place to start. With company facilities that are widely dispersed and lacking
close coordination and cohesion, Caterpillar’s logistics manager faced
• Component inventory levels that were much higher than acceptable
• Material ﬂow from Caterpillar plants and suppliers that were not well
managed
• Manufacturing lot sizes and buffers that were not tied to assembly
levels
• Lead times for component parts that were not coordinated with as-
sembly schedules
“The multiple assembly locations plus the high inventories resulted in
excessive logistics costs without a smooth, sequenced ﬂow,” according to
Andrew D. Nicoll, CFPIM, CIRM, C.P.M., and procurement manager for
Caterpillar, Inc. (Peoria, Ill.). To solve these problems, an early decision was
made to consolidate the total assembly process at one facility in Peoria for all
North American customers of tractors, excavators, replacement parts, and
OEM products. While the consolidation was taking place, a detailed review
of the logistics and inventory management practices was also underway.
A Sound Logistics Blueprint
“One of the previous shortcomings was forecasting,” says Nicoll. “Without
a long-term forecast of demand, it was difﬁcult to plan resources for as-
sembly, develop scheduling plans, or establish inventory levels and manufac-
turing orders for components,” he explained at an American Production and
Inventory Control Society (APICS) Annual International Conference.
A group was assigned to do demand planning for truck groups by re-
viewing past history, using data from machine users and dealers to determine
replacement parts and evaluate needs for “customized” truck groups for
OEM customers. These forecasting techniques used ﬁxed–lot size work or-
ders for manufactured components based on forecasted use for the next
six months. This technique allows component-manufacturing processes

141

to anticipate needed resources and minimize large ﬂuctuations in process
quantities.
Inventory Bank for Parts
A “sequencer” or inventory bank was established for parts that had ongoing
usage. Inventory levels for each part are based on past observations of peaks
in use over lead time required to replace them. If use varies signiﬁcantly from
one monthly period to the next, the inventory level in the sequencer is al-
lowed to ﬂuctuate with the short-term changes in demand. Then, ﬁxed–lot
size orders replenish materials at a constant rate.
“This technique is also beneﬁcial in minimizing the inventory levels
stored at the supplier’s group assembly lines,” Nicoll maintained. The stor-
age of most components for assembly is consolidated at the supplier location
to “save space and extra material handling.” An addition to the supplier’s
main building was constructed speciﬁcally for component material receiv-
ing and storage. The inventory transactions are recorded at the supplier and
at Caterpillar to reﬂect available parts and satisfy group demand.
Developing a Flow for JIT
“With a consolidated assembly operation, good requirements forecasts, and
weekly schedules for group build, the logistics ﬂow was established to de-
liver components just in time,” Nicoll noted. The ﬁnished group volume
averages 150 pieces per day, which requires about 15 truckloads of the trac-
tor plants’ needs and replacement parts. Supplying that volume of ﬁnished
groups likewise requires over 10 truckloads each day of the major compo-
nents, plus several truckloads per week for smaller parts such as nuts and
bolts. Links and shoes are now delivered several times each day based on the
build schedule sequence. Pins and bushings are delivered weekly.
Resolving Consolidation Problems
“As with any new process, there were many problems with the movement
of the assembly functions, the startup at the new supplier facility, and differ-
ent people involved in the operations at Caterpillar,” said Nicoll. Among
them were the following:
• The storage location at new assembly supplier was sized on previous assump-
tions. “It was size based on assumptions for component delivery and storage
142
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

similar to those for previous operations.” In the past, much of the overﬂow
material was stored in various Caterpillar locations, but this was not consid-
ered at the new facility. Likewise, the major component delivery schedules
were based on past experiences.
At start-up, the new supplier had too many loads of links and track shoes
from Caterpillar. “Gradually, the logistics team established a JIT delivery pro-
cess based on assembly schedules and sequences that did limit the bulky and
large usage component parts to less than one day.” Then the ﬂow of material
from the receiving dock through storage and to assembly lines was rearranged
to avoid building congestion in aisles and to reduce total material handling time.
• There was too much backup inventory at old group suppliers. When the new
supplier operation opened, the old suppliers began shipping material to the
new location. However, the shipment of surplus material quickly ﬁlled the
available space and had to be slowed until a plan could be established that
would send the parts into the new facility based on demand.
“The previous suppliers wanted to vacate their storage space as soon as
possible,” Nicoll acknowledged, but “this delay caused some concern about
the supplier’s ability to manage the assembly process.” Eventually all excess
inventory was absorbed. Inventory levels at the new supplier are now main-
tained at 30% of the volume held at the previous suppliers.
• Scheduling began with the techniques used at the previous suppliers. “This
caused difﬁculties in combining schedules from three previous operations
into one facility and subsequent shipment to ﬁve major customer facilities
in the United States, and to a consolidation point for shipment overseas.”
Nicoll says that “gradually working with the customer locations and the link,
track shoe, and pin and bushing components suppliers developed into a new
scheduling routine that overcame capacity and time constraints.”
The demand-forecasting routines were also changed to add OEM cus-
tomer forecasts. “Their volume is a relatively small percent of the total, but
they impact assembly schedules because many short-dated orders are re-
ceived, especially for ‘customized’ groups with very low and sporadic usage.
By combining all requirements for similar groups, the new assembly facility
reduces the number of setups for these small volume orders.”
Significant Inventory Reductions Achieved
The inventory of steel to manufacture track shoes was reduced $6 million
due to consistent ordering and assembly processes. Further, the component
inventory at the assembly supplier was slashed by more than 30%.

As a result of consistent on-time delivery and quick response to short-
dated orders, the inventory levels in the replacement parts operations have
been reduced by more than $22 million. Meanwhile, service to dealers and
customers has been maintained worldwide above 95%, even for old, non-
current models. In addition, deliveries to the tractor and excavator plans
have been 100% on time since early on in the start-up.

As more logistics managers realize that supply chain management extends
beyond order fulﬁllment to handling product returns, the need for reverse
logistics grows. Sprint PCS realized this soon after start-up in 1996. One of
the largest start-up companies in U.S. history, it handled $400 million in re-
turns in a 20-month period—8% of that was due to manufacturing defects.
PCS has grown at 300% annual rates. With such staggering growth come the
increased odds of returns. In one year, 1998, PCS saw 25% of its handsets
returned. 
Why so much? According to Eric Salisbury of PCS, some clients find
that they do not get the coverage they need from the handset. In addition,
PCS has a liberal returns policy, which promises a full refund in 30 days if
the customer is not fully satisfied. Because customers do not sign a con-
tract, they can return the product, cancel the service, and return the phone
at any time. As a result, “We realized early on that we needed to develop
a world-class and product reconditioning process to handle our high re-
turn rates.”
Six Ways PCS Achieved Reverse Logistics
According to Matthew Kunz at Sprint PCS, the company ultimately iden-
tiﬁed six ways to achieve reverse logistics:
1. Understand both your own and your customers’ business requirements. Kunz
says that the company wanted to provide timely ﬁnancial credit to customers
when they made a return, maintain revenue streams and customer satisfac-
tion levels, and have the reconditioned product look and feel like new to the
next customer. Customers, on the other hand, want a sound return policy
and a quick resolution to their problems.
144
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

2. Establish a reverse logistics supply chain network through existing sales chan-
nels. Whether it is through locally owned and operated retail stores, local
third parties, national third parties, third-party logistics provider (3PL) part-
ners, or telesales, PCS makes sure that each of these sales channels knows
how to process returned handsets quickly.
3. Establish strategic alliances with logistics service providers. UPS Worldwide
Logistics processes returned parts and either gives a ﬁnancial credit to the
customer, replaces the part, or returns it to PCS’s available stock.
4. Clarify elements leading to reverse logistics success. Two elements are crit-
ical: gatekeeping and compact cycle times. Gatekeepers stem the ﬂow of re-
turns by performing diagnostic testing. The product is resold at full or reduc-
ed price, depending on the damage. This screening process has saved PCS
$3.6 million.
5. Identify and resolve issues between retailers and manufacturers. Kunz says
that PCS wanted to ensure that retailers and manufacturers developed shared
initiatives to meet common goals and objectives. The groups worked to-
gether to understand the high number of returns and what could be done to
resolve it.
6. Establish performance measures and metrics for reverse logistics processes and
monitor them. “With our growth, we have to stay ahead of the curve,” says
Kunz. “By measuring our vendors and 3PLs, we can stay on top of them
everyday.”
Establish Partnerships
PCS outsources every part of its business that involves logistics, including re-
verse logistics. It partners with handset manufacturers and 3PLs to handle re-
turns processing. In addition, PCS has required its manufacturers to partner
with the 3PLs and required the 3PLs to partner with each other. For in-
stance, one partner tests the returns within a centralized DC in Louisville.
This eliminates the costs of shipping tested products back to the manufac-
turer and then sending them back to PCS to replenish inventory. “Our for-
mer procedures took up to 45 days,” says Salisbury. “Now we can turn thou-
sands of phones back into sellable stock within two days.”
PCS makes weekly calls to each handset vendor to discuss how products
are reconditioned and how to expedite the process, explains Kunz. “There
has to be communication between partners to look out for PCS’s best inter-
est and to make sure our partners focus on the right areas.”

Mirror Outbound Process
PCS is centralizing all outbound shipments into a DC in Louisville because
its 3PL, UPS Worldwide Logistics, has its air hub there. This allows mid-
night pickups to be delivered the next day. PCS realized that it could mirror
the outbound concept to handle returns processing. Having all inbound
product come into a centralized DC in Louisville reduces the time it takes
to return the product to sellable inventory.
Reduce Inbound Product
Both Salisbury and Kunz admit that returns processing at PCS is constantly
evolving, and although the objective is to perform the task successfully, the
ultimate goal is to reduce inbound returns by 10%. “If we can slash costs by
10%, it will be $500 million a year in savings,” says Salisbury. He continues,
“Keeping sellable product in the ﬁeld versus bringing it into the reverse lo-
gistics process creates a product our customers can be proud to use and we
can be proud to have our name on.”

Keeping tabs on your logistics spending patterns can save millions. Just ask
the logistics managers at Ingersoll-Rand. However, with $8.3 billion in sales
across 10 product groups, 40 divisions, 145 plants and distribution centers,
and 47,000 employees, understanding its logistics costs and potential for im-
provement across the company was a signiﬁcant challenge. Here’s how the
company made a success of a formidable project.
Teaming Up
Ingersoll-Rand decided to supplement internal functional expertise with the
acquisition of quantiﬁcation methodology, best-practice knowledge, and in-
ternational trade competency, explained JoAnn Johnson, director of logis-
tics for Ingersoll-Rand (Huntersville, N.C.; 704-947-1464) at a recent an-
nual conference of the CLM.
The 10-member project team, half from Ingersoll-Rand, half from
146
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

Vastera International Trade Consulting, was commissioned to identify op-
portunities for process improvements in logistics management. The team
was required to quantify present logistics costs, estimate costs of tomorrow,
and offer a list of recommendations with priority for action.
A Weekly Process
During the ﬁrst week of the team’s evaluation, members scheduled inter-
views with executives and prepared their questionnaires. Next, they con-
ducted a total of 220 interviews at 41 sites, covering various parts of the value
chain—sales, service, distribution, transportation, manufacturing, procure-
ment, and ﬁnance. In addition, requests for quantitative data were sent to 42
consolidation business unit locations. 
During weeks six to nine, the project team reassembled for an analysis,
which consisted of understanding the core logistics processes, identifying
customer needs, and quantifying the process costs and cycle times. The in-
terview and quantitative data were distilled to characterize the Ingersoll-
Rand logistics environment, to compare business unit logistics practices
against best practices, and to ﬁnd gaps.
The ﬁnal weeks, 10 through 12, were spent resolving each of these gaps
and prioritizing them based on their beneﬁt. The team developed solutions
for those at the top of the list and structured the summary of the ﬁndings and
recommendations into a presentation.
The Findings
Johnson says that the ﬁndings were signiﬁcant. Logistics costs were found to
be slightly over $550 million with 45% coming from transportation, 35%
from people, and 20% from inventory ﬁnance charges. The costs are esti-
mated to grow to $650 million in 2001.
A total of $170 million of opportunities was identiﬁed; $20 million of
that total was tactical, near-term (12 to 18 months) opportunities. These in-
cluded establishing an international trade competency center and improving
international transportation, company ﬂeets, North American transporta-
tion, and supplier transportation. The longer-term opportunities were in the
areas of integrated systems, scanning/bar coding, order entry, limiting model
options, and worldwide inventory/distributor networks.

A Logistics Group Is Born
According to Johnson, executive response to the project and the ﬁndings
was positive, and a small corporate logistics organization was formed. The
group established an open dialogue with the logistics professionals across the
business groups and began coordinating the effort to adopt best practices and
align the network. Initiatives were developed and launched to capitalize on
the tactical opportunities with the goal of $25 million in annualized savings
for 2000 in European and North American transportation and distribution.
These initiatives included
• Alignment of logistic processes with consistency of strategy, mea-
surement, and contracts
• Leverage of company volumes in procuring transportation services
• Process improvements in demand ﬂow methods, transportation ser-
vice mapping, and e-business
• The establishment of an intranet site link to facilitate the spread of
best practices and other logistics information policies
“Ingersoll-Rand has a corporate understanding that the deﬁnition of logis-
tics is more than transportation and is key to the entire company value chain
from supplier to customer,” says Johnson. “We understand total logistics
costs and capitalize on process improvement to achieve a competitive ad-
vantage.”

Often overlooked by logistics managers or left to suppliers to address, in-
bound logistics planning is a great way to reduce your supply chain costs. By
taking the responsibility out of your suppliers’ hands, you will realize a more
reliable and cost-efﬁcient network. 
Consider the case of Ford Global Technologies, Inc. (FGTI; 313-323-
7809), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company. Since concen-
trating efforts on inbound logistics, the company has saved tens of millions
of dollars in transportation and inventory carrying costs.

Plant-Centric versus Origin-Based Networks
“We had to ﬁnd a systematic approach to handling our complex inbound
network,” explains Jerry Joyce, director of global logistics for FGTI. “We
have 21 ﬁnal assembly plants and 5,000 suppliers. Add to that limited dock
space and limited time windows for deliveries. This high-volume, high-
frequency inbound logistics network needed a solution. We wanted to keep
up our pace without increasing freight costs.”
The best solution was moving from a destination- or plant-centric lo-
gistics network to an origin-based network. Joyce explains, “We used to be
oblivious to the supplier’s location in relation to the manufacturing sites.
Now we have optimized the pick-ups and built optimal trailer loads for the
destination site.”
“While before we might have had ﬁve different trucks supporting ﬁve
plants, we now have one truck that goes to all the plants,” says Mary Jo
Koenigeauer, manager of global logistics technology at FGTI.
Getting Down to the Finest Details
FGTI is using an inbound logistics software solution to help synchronize the
ﬂow of product to the production site. The ultimate goal is to have no more
than two hours of material at the production site, cutting down signiﬁcantly
on the amount of parts in storage.
The package that FGTI uses is SynQuest, Inc.’s (Duluth, Ga.; 800-844-
3228) Inbound Planning Engine. Joyce says that the system enables FGTI to
generate the lowest total delivered cost plan, based on the view of the com-
plete inbound logistics process. It drills down to the individual material and
determines inbound and reverse transportation routes and schedules, ship-
ment frequency, inventory, manufacturing constraints, and equipment us-
age, allowing Ford to plan for every part.
For example, says Joyce, scheduling a weekly, full truckload delivery to
a manufacturing plant—as opposed to a daily milk run—might make sense
from a transportation-cost perspective, but it may totally ignore speed, qual-
ity, and inventory considerations.
“The goal at Ford is to develop logistics solutions that increase supply
chain velocity and decrease total costs,” says Tim Harvey, president and chief
operating ofﬁcer at SynQuest. 
Controlling Logistics Costs
149

A Collaborative Solution
Finding such a solution already on the market was not easy, agree Joyce and
Koenigeauer, as no product addressed all of FGTI’s issues. The company
turned to SynQuest to develop a joint solution that FGTI could use and one
that SynQuest could then make commercially available.
“Building the product with Ford allows us to bounce ideas off of a com-
pany and gives them the opportunity to practically custom-build a solution
to ﬁt their needs,” says Chris Jones, executive vice president of marketing
and corporate development for SynQuest.
In customizing the solution, Ford required that the solution allow for
granularity. Jones explains, “Ford wants to see the product show up at the
manufacturing site, which dock door it is at, what truck it is on, product se-
quence, and what physical constraints the part has.”
“Ultimately, this collaboration beneﬁts Ford in the delivery of automo-
tive products and services to our customers,” says Roger May, president and
CEO of FGTI.
A Data-Driven Process
In order for FGTI to get the most from its inbound solution, the company
had to do upfront work—practices that Jones says any organization should
undertake if it wants to improve on its inbound logistics program. 
For instance, Jones says, supply chain data is needed to conﬁgure the
planning engine. FGTI had to supply information about its parts, including
size, shapes, and weights. Joyce and Koenigeauer had to determine if there
was an opportunity for supplier consolidation and if cross docking should be
implemented. Finally, they had to evaluate suppliers and purchase prices.
“You have to get together with manufacturing and procurement to
show them the opportunities that exist on the inbound side of logistics—
that is, beyond traditional transportation. It may involve changing contracts
with suppliers and how fulﬁllment should occur, but the savings are usually
signiﬁcant when you take a cross-functional approach,” says Jones. Compa-
nies can save anywhere from 10% to 50% in overall logistics and inventory
carrying costs.
He adds that most companies have not capitalized on inbound logis-
tics—“but it is a place where companies can squeeze out costs without dis-
rupting business.”

The Implementation Plan
Since implementing two of the ﬁve modules last summer, FGTI has seen im-
provements and savings in logistics conﬁguration management (LCM) and
rotation and routing. Koenigeauer says that the LCM module allows FGTI
to determine which mode it will use to make a delivery and then break down
the requirements at the part level to optimize transportation and inventory
costs. The rotation and routing module tells which days and windows times
are best to ship, and it shows the number of conveyances on the road and the
dock schedules.
FGTI will soon implement the additional three modules: mode selec-
tion, returnable containers assignment (which minimizes the cost of reverse
logistics for returnable containers and pallets), and stowage (which shows
how to ﬁll the conveyance for maximal shipment efﬁciency).
Future Plans in the Works
Jones adds that FGTI is using the Inbound Planning Engine to consider how
new carriers, new products, and other modes will impact its inbound logis-
tics process.
“We are analyzing our network like never before,” says Koenigeauer.
“We are able to participate in what-if scenarios to determine current and fu-
ture business principles and build the organization around the changes that
we make.”
“Our business is much more ﬂexible, as we can now impose restrictions
or turn off constraints, depending on what makes more sense for the busi-
ness,” says Joyce.

There is a new weapon in the ﬁght against the competition—the logistics
manager. Not only has management discovered this, which is good, but your
competition has discovered this as well, which is bad. Both, however, have put
the logistics manager at dead center of the battle. It is now up to the logistics
manager to ﬁnd innovative ways of gaining and maintaining customers and
keeping them loyal. It means that you must become much more proactive in
your logistics strategy. These steps should help put this strategy into practice.
Putting Together a Winning Strategy
“Logistics managers tend to be placed in reactive modes when it comes to
handling customers, but having a logistics strategy makes them more pro-
active,” says Ron Grossman, solutions director for Unisys Corp. (Windsor,
Conn.; 860-298-1375). A proactive logistics strategy should include the fol-
lowing elements, with the overriding goal of getting product to the cus-
tomer as quickly and accurately as possible:
• Process system reengineering. The objective is to examine all your inter-
nal logistics processes and determine if you could be doing things better.
• Optimal inventory performance. Determine optimal inventory levels
based on historical data and forecasting. “You don’t want to have safety stock
for just-in-case situations,” says Grossman.
152

• Optimal storage schemes. Does your warehouse have enough space?
Does it have too much unused space? Is product stored for the most efﬁcient
picking sequences?
• Cube space. Stack product to the full height of the warehouse. Use
narrower aisles and have equipment that will ﬁt in those aisles. Make sure the
picking sequence makes sense.
• Integration of warehouse management system (WMS). “The WMS can
only tell you where product is stored—not if you should have the product
in the ﬁrst place,” says Grossman. “That is why it has to be integrated with
other logistics systems, like the ﬁnancial, shipping, and order fulﬁllment sys-
tems.”
• Total cost of ownership. This includes the cost of the product while it
sits in inventory as well as the shipping costs. “I bet 90% of the businesses
out there don’t know what their total net landed costs are,” says Grossman.
“You must get a handle on these costs.”
• Responsiveness to change. Whether its labeling or shipping require-
ments, “if the customer wants something, you better ﬁgure out a way to do
it, or the competition will,” Grossman says.
• Supply chain optimization. Can you avoid having product come into
the warehouse altogether? Should you ship directly to the consumer? The
goal here, says Grossman, is to save time and money.
Logistics Technology
The key to logistics strategy is technology. Electronic commerce has become
one of the leading solutions, but Grossman warns that few companies are ac-
tually using it correctly. “You want to have more than just an Internet pres-
ence. Your site should do more than provide information; it should be in-
teractive.” 
Interactivity might come in the form of tracking and tracing capabili-
ties, which Grossman says are of top importance to customers today. Also
important is the ability to share information with customers—via electronic
data interchange or on company intranets and extranets. According to Gross-
man, “accurate and timely information keeps things running smoothly and
ensures that the customer will come back.”

What does ISO 9002 mean to warehousing and logistics? The answer is
simple: plenty. ISO 9002 certiﬁcation puts your company’s name in lights.
It lets the whole world know that your warehousing and logistics processes
meet quality standards. As a result, customers will likely be drawn to you,
your proﬁts may improve, and you may gain more control over your oper-
ations. Because it has the potential to create such huge rewards for your
company, ISO 9002 certiﬁcation may seem a bit intimidating. In fact, certi-
ﬁcation can be simple—that is, if you follow some clearly deﬁned steps.
ISO Defined
We’ve all heard of ISO 9000, but what exactly is ISO 9002? According to
Peter Sanderson, president of TQMS International (514-630-0078), ISO
9002 is part of a larger group of standards that make up ISO 9000. ISO
9002, he says, is designed speciﬁcally for companies that perform a process.
Warehousing and logistics are based on a number of processes and, there-
fore, are placed into this category. “A lot of warehouses have value-added
processing such as shrink-wrapping and minor assembly operations,” San-
derson says.
ISO 9001, on the other hand, is created for companies that design and
manufacture products. Companies that want to maintain control over what
is coming from and going to their ofﬁces should apply for ISO 9003 certiﬁ-
cation. Although ISO 9003 may sound like the best option for warehousing
and logistics operations, it’s not. According to Sanderson, “ISO 9003 isn’t
used often, and it’s typically used by organizations such as law ﬁrms.”
When considering ISO certiﬁcation, it’s important to remember that no
one category is better than the other. Unfortunately, many companies per-
ceive that ISO 9001 is more prestigious than is any other ISO 9000 certiﬁ-
cation. They are mistaken, according to Sanderson: “One isn’t better than
the other. It’s the size of shoe that ﬁts the company.”
Speciﬁcally, ISO 9002 is a management system based on a set of man-
agement tools. To receive certiﬁcation, these tools should be incorporated
into your warehousing and logistics operations. The tools include conduct-
ing incoming and outgoing inspections and deﬁning management authori-
ties, such as who makes the decisions about ﬁnancing, contracts, warehous-
ing, and logistics processes.

Contract negotiation is another important tool to consider when apply-
ing for ISO 9002 certiﬁcation. “Contract negotiation covers the basic crite-
ria that are necessary before signing agreements,” Sanderson says. Contract
negotiation includes issues such as insurance, theft measures, and service ca-
pabilities. 
The management tools also address what to do if a process fails. When
preparing for ISO 9002 certiﬁcation, you should spell out exactly what you
will do if a problem arises. In other words, what corrective action will you
take? You should ask yourself what caused the problem and what you are go-
ing to do to solve it. According to Sanderson, however, you shouldn’t stop
there. You need to determine how you will prevent the problem from re-
occurring and how you will ﬁnd a solution. Further, the newest step in the
process is evaluating your solution to make sure it is successful. 
Basically, ISO 9002 is a management plan that says “what would you do
if . . . ?” For example, if one of your trucks overturned on a snow-covered
highway, you need to know what to do. ISO 9002 certiﬁcation basically says
that you will have a contingency plan in place to get the shipment where it
needs to be. “This is how ISO affects the bottom line,” Sanderson explains.
“It ensures continuous improvement and reduces your costs due to non-
conformance.”
What You Need to Do
There are basically three ways to become ISO 9002 certiﬁed, and the pro-
cess typically takes ﬁve to eight months. Some logistics managers opt to take
on the process themselves. However, when they do, “the process rarely gets
completed on time,” Sanderson says. Their focus often shifts to other proj-
ects, and the ISO 9002 certiﬁcation requirements fade into the background. 
Despite the challenges, you may still decide to take the ISO 9002 certi-
ﬁcation process on yourself. If you do, the ﬁrst thing you need to do is get
educated. ISO certiﬁcation courses are available. Once you have learned
what you need to know about ISO certiﬁcation, it is up to you to create a
quality manual and develop and implement quality system procedures. Au-
ditors enter the scene during the ﬁnal phase and, hopefully, validate the qual-
ity procedures that you set up.
If ISO certiﬁcation seems a burden, you can seek the help of an ISO
consultant. Consultants supply required documentation and provide on-
the-ﬂoor-training and management training. Because they have the neces-
sary resources, consultants can start ISO-quality system procedures almost
Logistics Management and Strategy

immediately. Once the systems are in place, the consultants call in the audi-
tors to ensure that you meet ISO certiﬁcation standards. 
According to Sanderson, there is yet a third ISO certiﬁcation option—
video conferencing. A blend of the ﬁrst two methods, video conferencing
takes advantage of the Internet and provides on-line training to logistics man-
agers. TQMS helped 13 logistics companies gain ISO 9000 certiﬁcation via
video conferencing last year, and another 45 are working to do the same this
year. Logistics managers can work their way through the procedures and col-
laborate with TQMS on the computer, Sanderson says. “They learn as they
go.” If you think videoconferencing might be the most promising way to be-
come ISO 9002 certiﬁed, visit www.tqms.com. There you can download the
ISO certiﬁcation procedures as well as an example of a quality manual. 
The Bottom Line
Regardless of which way you choose to become ISO 9002 certiﬁed, you
stand to reap a number of beneﬁts. The biggest attribute of ISO certiﬁcation
is international recognition. Therefore, when “ISO 9002 certiﬁed” appears
above your company’s door or on its letterhead, you have gained substantial
marketing visibility.
Second, ISO 9002 certiﬁcation enables you to gain more control over
your warehousing and logistics operations. “By going through the process,
you’ll see where you’ve been and where you want to be,” Sanderson notes.
With this knowledge in hand, you are better able to streamline your pro-
cesses, reduce the amount of paperwork in your operations, and make your
warehousing and logistics systems more effective. 
ISO 9002 certiﬁcation can improve your company’s proﬁt margin. “If
you know what you want, and you start quality processes and train your em-
ployees, you should have tools for continuous improvement.” Furthermore,
continuous improvement leads to increased proﬁts. Remember that the goal
of ISO 9002 certiﬁcation is to ensure quality in warehousing and logistics.
You are doing ISO not for an auditor, but for yourself.

agers said that teams are particularly beneﬁcial to identify savings opportu-
nities in the distribution center (DC).
One manager relates how his team practices resulted in signiﬁcant ﬁ-
nancial reductions. “We focused on throughput costs and inbound trans-
portation,” says the distribution director for a retail company in Maryland
that employs 10,000 employees. “We examined every process of receiving,
shipping, and selecting to identify unnecessary processes. Our team mem-
bers led the effort, developed new procedures, and implemented the results.
Because it was their work, the team members embraced the change and
made it successful. We also outsourced freight planning to a broker. In both
areas, we reduced costs more than 20% and on some routes, 50%.”
Respondents also report that teams play an important role in strength-
ening interdepartmental relationships. “We have a new distribution strategy
that segmented distributors and focused on managing the relationship dif-
ferently,” explains the senior project manager for a Georgia-based beverage
company. “We dedicated alliance managers to manage relationships and
work on business process optimization, supply chain integration, and busi-
ness building activities.”
High- and Low-Tech Solutions Pay Off
Almost 19% of the respondents implemented technology and automated
processes, up slightly from 17% a year earlier. Everything from supply chain
software to simpler solutions has shown signiﬁcant savings for respondents. 
Many said that achieving greater control over operations is the impetus
for a new system. “We implemented an ERP [enterprise resource planning]
system in January, which gave us more control over our inventories and
opened our eyes to true costs—where they were and how to contain and
improve them,” says the logistics manager consultant for a company in
Maine.
The materials manager for an automotive molding ﬁrm in Indiana tells
a similar story: “We implemented a new software system, MFG Pro. Now
we can truly get a handle on controlling inventory, production needs, and
customer requirements. Different scenarios can be played out in the system
to keep the inventory at the desired level and still monitor our suppliers’ de-
livery performance.”
However, it’s not just the sophisticated technology that makes a differ-
ence. Something as simple as a barcode label can reduce costs and improve
efﬁciency. “We implemented a program to print individual box labels and
158
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

carton labels overseas, reducing our label costs by 60%,” says the DC plan-
ning logistics manager for a footwear manufacturer in North Carolina. “Our
consolidator is also responsible for notifying factories that the labels are
ready, giving us advance notice of production delays, and ensuring vendor
compliance on packaging and labeling. This enables merchandise to ﬂow
through the distribution center without delay and gives our buyers advance
notice of production.”
Vendor Managed Inventory and Better Forecasting
Cut Inventory Costs
Logistics professionals told us that by using the technologies just mentioned
they have been better able to control their inventory programs, either by
vendor managed inventory or through improved forecasting methods. “By
pushing more vendors to stock off site, the amount of deliveries received
daily at the DC has been cut about 50%,” says a manager of manufacturing
services for a ﬂexible packaging company in Pennsylvania. “Raw materials
are received in approximately two loads per day. This frees time for other
tasks, and delivery times are scheduled the same time each day, making op-
erations standardized, predictable, and efﬁcient.”
“We separated production planning and production scheduling func-
tions,” says a vice president for logistics at an Ohio-based meat products
company. “We added more responsibility for production planning to work
closer with sales to improve forecast accuracy and frequency. This helps to
reduce overstocks and aged inventory on slow moving/discontinued items
and to improve customer service on faster-moving or new items.”
More Creative Transportation Practices
Another change cited as having the most effect on logistics departments con-
sists of developing and implementing a creative transportation management
program aimed at reducing freight costs. “We have turned our truckload
freights into LTL freight,” explains the manager of transportation for a pub-
lishing company in Pennsylvania. “This eliminated our need to stage prod-
uct in house until we build a solid load to a particular destination. We now
use consolidators to commingle our freight with other companies’. This
process has greatly improved turnaround time to customers and reduced our
annual transportation costs.”
Another manager shares the advantages of leasing over purchasing
Logistics Management and Strategy
159

transportation equipment: “We leased an ISO tank to transport liquid caus-
tic soda from our Honolulu facility to our neighbor island facilities,” says the
associate director for a chemical distribution ﬁrm. “The lease rate is low, and
it allows us to spend our limited capital on other high-priority items.”
Although the majority of respondents has realized advantages on a do-
mestic front, creative transportation practices have also been internationally
successful for some respondents. “We have centralized our international
shipments to go through one port, giving us the effect and beneﬁts of a ‘hub’
and allowing us better economies of scale and better customer service,” says
the import/export supervisor for a company in Washington.
Whether domestic or international, the goal of any transportation pro-
gram is reduced costs. Changing the process structure is how one trans-
portation supervisor did just that. “Transportation costs were reduced by
three cents per case to customers by starting a one-day-a-week delivery sys-
tem. We’d been on a delivery system rolling through every ﬁve days. Savings
contribute to reduced mileage by delivering to each store 52 times a year in-
stead of 73.”

The “State of Logistics Report” sponsored by Cass Information Systems and
ProLogis is as dramatic as ever, inspiring logistics professionals continually to
improve their operations for the good of the industry as a whole.
The report supports a important lesson: Logistics managers play a key
role in improving business processes and productivity. The following 10
propositions, offered by Bob Delaney, vice president of Cass, suggest how
the logistics profession can be improved.
1. Improve the efﬁciency of inventory investment. Delaney says that the logis-
tics manager has primary responsibility for the investment, condition, and lo-
cation of inventory. However, data indicate that the efﬁciency of inventory
investment has declined in some recent years; for example, although the ra-
tio of shipments to unﬁlled orders in manufacturing businesses that produce
to order improved from 1.61 to 1.58, the ratio of shipments to inventory in
manufacturing businesses that produce to stock increased from 1.35 to 1.38
in 1998. “We have not taken inventory out of the system,” says Delaney. “We
are merely shifting where inventory is held within the supply chain.”

2. Resolve logistics issues and concerns regarding ERP systems. Although the
ERP industry has made progress in supply chain planning system interfaces,
such systems will not impact business logistics productivity for another two
to four years, says Delaney. In an effort to take full advantage of the tech-
nology, he encourages logistics managers to
• Identify any key processes that need strong IT support
• Package these concepts in a way that is attractive to senior manage-
ment
• Focus on mainline business operations, not back-ofﬁce functions
3. Continue to exploit the cost and service opportunities provided by third-party
logistics services. Typically, logistics managers are experiencing reductions of
10% in their logistics cost by using third-party providers. This might explain
why the third-party logistics (3PL) industry continues to show signs of sig-
niﬁcant growth: gross revenues up 15% to nearly $40 billion; transportation
management up 21%; dedicated contract carriage up 20%; value-added/
warehouse segments up 10%; and international 3PL services up 11%.
4. Exploit opportunities of integrated package design. Delaney believes that
poor productivity is resulting because protective packaging is no longer con-
sidered a key responsibility for logistics managers. He points to Becton Dick-
inson & Co., however, as an excellent example of how packaging design can
lead to cost reductions. The company’s third-party provider, USF Logistics,
retained the help of Computerized Packaging Consultants, Inc., to analyze
six products and develop practical recommendations to optimize the costs of
packaging, transfer freight, warehousing, handling, pallets, and delivery.
At least two options were presented for each product. Option A in-
volved revisions to the internal arrangement of the products and a redesign
of the packaging. Option B included increases or reductions in the product
count per package. The potential cost reductions for the six items ap-
proached 30%, including reductions in packaging costs of 33%.
5. Support programs that will reduce the driver shortage. The driver shortage
is expected to become even more acute than it is today. As carriers advertise
signiﬁcant signing bonuses to attract truck drivers, logistics managers can do
their part to make the job more appealing as well, says Delaney. “The dis-
position among shippers is to accept rate increases that are applied to driver
wages,” he says. “The National Industrial Transportation League has even
established a working group to investigate better practices to attract and
maintain drivers.”
Logistics Management and Strategy
161

Delaney says that logistics managers can look to their internal operations
for ways to curtail excessive driver waiting times as well as loading and un-
loading times. “We cannot overstate the importance of an efﬁcient trucking
industry to our business logistics system. It is in everyone’s interest to reduce
the driver shortage.”
6. Demand that the focus of your transportation policy be on competition instead
of protection. “We regret to report that we are losing too much productivity
because of political inﬁghting between our rail and trucking industries,” says
Delaney.
7. Obtain the cost reductions that are available by safely operating longer, heav-
ier highway vehicles. The six-axle tractor-trailer combination, known as the
Argosy Safety Concept Vehicle, has a 90,000-pound payload, and distribu-
tion load over the axles results in 13% less damage to pavements and bridges
compared to the ﬁve-axle standard. “The Argosy is remarkably safe,” says
Delaney. “It has a lower center of gravity, which provides more stability, and
it is roll-over resistant.” The Argosy’s designers predicted a 15% improve-
ment in safe vehicle performance last year; the actual improvements in safety
are closer to the 30% range.
8. Ensure that maritime reform delivers the economic beneﬁts that are available.
It is widely assumed that shippers will have the advantage in the negotiation
of conﬁdential contracts.
9. Continue to improve the capacity and service levels on the railroad network
through increased capital investment and consolidated operations. Capacity has be-
come a serious issue for the railroad industry. Over the last 10 years, Class I
rail freight density has increased by over 50%—more freight moving over
fewer tracks. One of the actions necessary to reverse the capacity and service
problems is to increase capital spending to upgrade and enhance track, sig-
naling and communications, and freight car and locomotive ﬂeets.
10. Reform the Jones Act in order to support the requirements of our global econ-
omy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current penalty costs
of the Jones Act exceed $14 billion. The industries suffering the penalty costs
are agriculture, forest product, petrol chemical, mining, and metals.
Delaney says, “The Jones Act is a costly, inequitable form of protection.
It is no longer achieving its original intention and is harming our nation’s
ability to compete in the global marketplace. We encourage Congress to en-
act a reform of the Jones Act to make the economy more productive and ef-
ﬁcient.”

Good news for logistics managers: You’re not alone. The problems that you
face daily—inventory obsolescence, increasing costs, management of sup-
plier relationships, and lack of communication along the supply chain—are
common among your peers. But thanks to a new Managing Logistics survey,
respondents share their advice for overcoming many of these, and other, ob-
stacles to performing your job well. Here are 12 of the best tips culled from
the hundreds we received.
1. Plan labor better. “We are planning to better balance the needs of ware-
house operation inbound receipts and ﬁlling stockouts,” says the vice presi-
dent of corporate logistics for a large home-furnishings company in New
York. “The number and mix of inbound product is planned at maximum
levels by the day of the week. This allows us to optimize/minimize labor
requirements and plan our shifts accordingly.”
2. Redesign the warehouse. “We redesigned our warehouse with narrower
aisles, a wire guidance system, and bar coding,” acknowledges the shipping
supervisor for a forklift manufacturer in Indiana. “This has almost doubled
our capacity, improved inventory accuracy. We are now able to move more
inventory faster and more efﬁciently.”
3. Work with other departments. “Cross utilization of material handlers in
different departments enables them to be deployed where the need is great-
est,” explains the manager of distribution for a small ﬁrm in Illinois.
“Interdepartmental cooperation in dealing with transportation-related
issues has improved our vendor situation,” explains the transportation man-
ager for a company in Indiana. “Some vendors were shipping multiple ship-
ments per day to our DC locations. We worked to get them to consolidate
into one shipment per day per DC.”
4. Benchmark logistics activities. “The introduction of a continuous pro-
cess improvement model has led to a 184% increase in productivity in the
last 12 months and a 56% reduction in labor-related costs.”

5. Renegotiate freight rates. “We initiated a program to control more traf-
ﬁc by paying the freight instead of shipping collect to gain leverage with the
carriers when negotiating for lower costs,” says the general manager of trans-
portation for a chemical company in New Jersey.
“We combined our inbound and outbound freight with four trucking
companies,” explains one shipping supervisor. “By combining our freight by
area, weight and delivery time, we are now getting better freight rates,
scheduled pickup and delivery times, and reduced truck trafﬁc at the dock.
This also gives us the security of dependable freight carriers.”
6. Reduce throughput costs. “We reduced throughput costs in and out of
the DC,” shares the senior logistics manager for a large company in Wash-
ington. “By changing pick/pack operations, we increased our lines per hour
by 30%, and the improved product handling sequence has reduced costs by
$200,000, while increasing productivity.”
7. Reduce order processing and communication costs. “We reduced the total
cost per order by 50% compared to our previous ﬁscal year,” boasts the cor-
porate manager of logistics for a printing company in Kansas. “The total cost
was for material handling, receiving, inventory control, and shipping” (i.e.,
total labor divided by total orders = cost per order).
8. Reduce inventory obsolescence, damage, and pilferage. “We concentrated
our efforts on reusable plastic packaging material,” says the logistics manager
for a television-glass manufacturer in Pennsylvania. “Customer returns of
the pack were never tracked, so obsolete packs wound up in storage. Con-
sequently, we frequently purchased new packs only to have several truck-
loads returned from the customer or found at the warehouse. By imple-
menting tracking processes and measurements, we reduced annual purchases
by $3 million, overall inventory by $2 million, and warehousing costs by
over $100 million.”
“We now rely on reports that track material not used in more than 12
months,” explains the materials manager for a midsize company in Califor-
nia. “This has helped us identify $500,000 in obsolete inventory.” 
“We have reduced our inventory 20% by working more closely with
sales in forecast accuracy, discontinuation of slow/nonmoving items, and re-
duction in aged inventory,” says the vice president of logistics for a meat
product company in Ohio. “We now reforecast and establish inventory-
level targets for each item every 30 days rather than 90 days, helping us to
control production and inventory balances better and to reduce the level of
aged inventory.”

9. Have suppliers hold inventory. “Through our integrated supplier pro-
grams, our suppliers hold inventory until the actual requirement time,” says
the general manager of logistics for a large company in Georgia. “Now it’s
as if we control the inventory without having to hold onto safety stock in
our own warehouse.” 
“Local suppliers hold inventory for us until delivery,” explains a trafﬁc
manager in Maryland. “Freeing up warehouse space and freight savings, as
well as standardizing delivery, has saved us about $300 per delivery.”
10. Establish a foreign trade zone. “By implementing our manufacturing
site as a foreign trade zone, we have reduced costs by utilizing invested tar-
iff and not paying duties on ﬁnished product placed into commerce,” says
the director of logistics for a company in Oklahoma. “We have also been
able to reduce inbound cycle time by bringing foreign goods through ports
without delay from Customs processing.”
11. Make use of sophisticated technology. “We have yet to implement it, but
when we do, our shipping management system will offer signiﬁcant time
savings,” predicts the transportation manager for an industrial pump manu-
facturer in New York. “We will reduce errors in calculating freight charges
and in invoicing, and we will be able to improve customer service by cap-
turing shipping data (tracking numbers, freight rates, carrier, and the like),
which can be passed to the customer service organization to improve cus-
tomer relations.”
12. Improve communication with truck drivers. “We do business with a third-
party partner, who pays the total cost of a new radio/telephone system with
all dispatchers, drivers, and large customers,” says a logistics manager in
Utah. “This saves hundreds of dollars in downtime and duplicated services,
and everyone from drivers to dispatchers to the customers loves it.”

Many companies approach an operational problem in the warehouse with a
“build versus buy” mentality. The usual argument is that the operation is
unique and thus that no packaged solution will be able to meet its needs. Too
often, however, internally developed solutions put ﬁrms on a path to doing
this wrong, only faster.

Robert L. Olsen, project manager for Tompkins Associates (Raleigh,
N.C.; 800-789-1257), says that building a system with internal resources is
difﬁcult to justify. His eight-step approach to purchasing, rather than build-
ing, a WMS has proven to mitigate risks and guarantee project justiﬁcation.
Eight Steps Toward Purchasing a WMS
1. Start with a detailed examination of the operation with an eye toward
true business requirements. The objective is to document what results are
needed and examine every process step to determine the efﬁciency and in-
tent. Group common processes and determine how they can be addressed
consistently.
2. Evaluate the build versus buy decision. Several factors should be con-
sidered in this process. One is an analysis of available resources. Resource re-
quirements include knowledge of radio frequency (RF) terminals, wedge
scanners, electronic scales, bar codes, and automatic data collection (ADC)
systems. Interfaces to other technologies in the warehouse, such as convey-
ors, carousels, and pick-to-light systems, can also be factors.
3. Consider lost opportunity. The development of a WMS from scratch
requires a deep understanding of the operation’s work ﬂow. Lengthy delays
in implementing the system result in lost opportunities for an improved op-
eration.
4. Consider the risk factors of the project. Historically, a WMS project
taken on solely with internal resources runs a high risk of failure. Using an
existing solution increases the opportunity for success. The use of outside
consulting resources in the planning and implementation phases of the proj-
ect, coupled with a detailed analysis and facility preparation, greatly in-
creases the success factor.
5. Consider the impact that the project will have on the overall facility.
A signiﬁcant beneﬁt of a WMS is the discipline that it instills within the
warehouse. The process dictates a speciﬁc work ﬂow and accountability
through real-time data capture and directed task management. The work di-
rectives pace employee activity. Optimum movement throughout the ware-
house is controlled by issuing one unique task at a time. 
6. Identify functionality. Functionality is the bottom-line factor that will
direct the decision for a WMS solution. Once the core functionality has
been identiﬁed, the needs of the organization can be compared to the capa-
166
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

bilities either of an existing solution or of the ability to produce a suitable
software solution internally.
7. Consider cost factors. You must consider people who are already in
the payroll, which is offset by the lost opportunity factors in the justiﬁcation
equation. Risk assessment of the internal group compared to the redun-
dancy of stafﬁng suggests that the package solution signiﬁcantly mitigates the
project risk.
8. Be aware of the issue of concept to delivery. Be aware of the possibil-
ity for the initial concept to diverge from the ﬁnal product. Existing software
allows future users to examine the solution thoroughly, to the point of doc-
umenting work ﬂows prior to ﬁnal commitment. The risk and hidden costs
of internal solutions are difﬁcult to justify by comparison.
Benchmarking Your Warehouse Management System
Olsen says that because management does not often uncover the results it
expected from a WMS, it is important to measure the system by productiv-
ity standards. This is calculated as a ratio of revenue to operating cost. Rev-
enue is the net cash ﬂow—all cash received less returns and write-offs. 
The second part of the equation is operational expense. It should in-
clude all daily operating expenses. The most obvious is direct labor (no over-
head). People who work in the warehouse (including supervisory staff )
should be included, as well as insurance and utilities associated with the op-
eration. These are often considered ﬁxed assets, but increases in productiv-
ity can result in the reduction of overtime and a reduction in utilities as well
as insurance. Be sure also to include monthly expenses, such as maintenance,
leased equipment, and transportation costs. 
Benchmarking for Justification
Using the productivity ratio will ensure that management sees how the or-
ganization compares to industry leaders. This helps in the initial justiﬁcation
of a WMS project. As the project is initiated, the beneﬁts can be measured
rather quickly as they will be reﬂected in the ratio. The most immediate re-
alizations will be lowered costs from a reduction in overtime and the reduc-
tion of reverse logistics transportation. Over time, adjustments in total labor,
utilities, and insurance will contribute to an improved ratio.
Before setting out on the benchmarking project, make sure you

understand industry association guidelines to allow accurate comparison of
industry numbers. Seek out a benchmark organization for comparison—ei-
ther a sister company or an organization in another industry that shares com-
mon operational issues.
Finally, be aware that comparing last month’s ﬁgures to this month’s
numbers may initially be of value, but if you have any signiﬁcant seasonality
in your business, averaging the numbers and comparisons to previous years
will provide a more accurate measurement.

Logistics managers who invest time and money in training programs ﬁnd
that their employees opt to stay for at least 10 years. Nonetheless, we de-
tected a catch-22 in many of today’s logistics departments. Often, compa-
nies are reluctant to train operating personnel, thinking that if they do, the
chances that these employees will leave for better jobs increase. Thus, they
do not invest in their employees and then wind up with people who are not
qualiﬁed to do their jobs.
To help logistics managers make the best decisions about formalized
training programs, we present the highlights of an extensive study, The
Growth and Development of Logistics Personnel, by researchers at Mississippi
State University. This book describes competencies, job requirements, and
training needs for 22 logistics job families, ranging from the warehouse ﬂoor
to the executive suite:
• Logistics managers must create organizations that adapt quickly to
change and can add to the organizational knowledge base.
• Personnel training should develop a common view of the logistics
system and its role in the ﬁrm, share or expand job knowledge, and refresh
or enhance job skills.
• Logistics managers should leverage relationships with multiple train-
ing sources to meet the complex and diverse training needs of the logistics
organization.
• Firms offering employability and personal development attract a
larger, better-qualiﬁed pool.
• Logistics managers should view training as an investment, not as a cost.
The best organizations invest signiﬁcant time, effort, and money in training.

• Logistics managers should assure that they and their operating em-
ployees are prepared for changes that technology and competitive pressures
bring about.
• Top logistics managers must grasp strategic purchasing, inventory
control, and customer service issues as these functions increase in impor-
tance and change in organizational structure.
• Logistics managers must seek to train all employees at all levels, in-
cluding themselves, in communication and self-management skills.
• Logistics managers should commit to formal training systems and
programs as key elements in creating organizational advantages. Organiza-
tions cannot afford to wait for employees to learn on the job and become
competent.
• Logistics managers will need knowledge-based technical compe-
tence, cross-functional experience, collaborative interpersonal skills, and
self-management skills to manage logistics organizations. Operating em-
ployees will require many skills currently associated with management as
ﬁrms eliminate organizational levels and assign more interpersonal tasks to
the warehouse ﬂoor, production lines, and the vehicle.
• Logisticians need structured, formal training because of the shortage
of fully prepared workers and the potential failure of unstructured, informal
training. Formal training shortens the time it takes an employee to become
competent in a task.
• Employees should be given a sense of growth and development. “If
employees don’t have a sense of growth and development, from you, they
will seek it elsewhere,” state the authors. “Where we once had a sense of
movement in organizations and the chance to climb the corporate ladder, we
no longer have that, so folks are willing to look for another job that does. If
you want them to stick around, pay them.”
• Employees deserve a little latitude. If you are like most of your logis-
tics peers, you probably have more people working for you than you used
to, and you probably do not have the time to keep looking over their shoul-
ders. Give them the tools to do their jobs.
• The exchange of accurate information should be accelerated. If your
employees do not know what is going on, they will not know whether they
are making good decisions.
• Training professionals or training managers should become certiﬁed
as trainers. The authors warn that you should not rely on videos to train per-
sonnel just because they are the easiest training method.
Logistics Management and Strategy
169

• Jobs and people should ﬁt each other. Make sure people are trained
for their real jobs.
• On-the-job training (OJT) is more important than on-the-job expe-
rience (OJE). OJT is a structured program and not what occurs in most or-
ganizations, state the authors. They add, “Most often, organizations ﬁre you
into a swimming pool and tell you to ﬁgure things out for yourself.”
The authors conclude that OJT brings people to competence four times
faster than does OJE. Additionally, 33% of those who learned from OJE
could solve problems in the operation, whereas 80% of those receiving OJT
could solve the same problems.

The reality is this: Supplier partnerships are, at best, short-lived; most end
within three years. Yet according to Managing Logistics reader surveys, many
(almost half ) respondents continue to seek out and form new logistics part-
nerships. Essentially, they seek from the partnership what they cannot
achieve alone and, as a result, need to place a major emphasis on maintain-
ing partnerships with several key suppliers. The following sections present
ways to solidify these partnerships and in the process increase customer ser-
vice, reduce inventories, and minimize total operating costs.
Mutually Beneficial Relationships
Supplier relationship authority Tim Underhill, president, Underhill & As-
sociates (Tulsa, Okla.; 918-494-8085), says, “If a partnership is not beneﬁ-
cial to your suppliers, and it’s not beneﬁcial to you, it’s going to end.” The
idea is to form a relationship that is mutually beneﬁcial. Underhill says to
“pick the ‘low-hanging fruit’ of a relationship, meaning consignment in-
ventory or reducing the number of transactions. This can typically represent
about 30% of the savings you can get from your suppliers.”
The real decision that logistics professionals must make is whether it is
worth their time and effort to go after the other 70% of the total savings.
“Those who have learned how to bring beneﬁt to the supplier and them-
selves have had tremendous impact on their company’s bottom line,” says
Underhill. “Alliances are based on your ability to be more proﬁtable,” he
continues. “You’re not going to enter an alliance because you want to have
170
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

this great relationship with a supplier; you want to do it for the bottom-line
impact.”
Removing Causes of Failure
Underhill says that there are four primary places where alliances fail over and
over again:
1. Failure to put together a good commodity/service plan. Do you understand
the risk you are facing? Do you understand the return opportunities you are
looking at? How is the supplier of that good or service going to drive down
your total cost of operation?
2. Failure to perform the proper evaluation. “Know what you want to ac-
complish and then select a methodology to measure it,” says Underhill.
“Evaluate your results and select the one that’s going to give you the best re-
turn on investment and meet your needs better than any other.”
3. Poor change management. Managing change is critical to the process,
yet it is often overlooked. “The problem is the people who have knowledge
and understand what’s to be done haven’t gotten the others to understand it,”
he says.
4. Lack of ongoing evaluation. “If you can’t measure your suppliers on a
total cost basis, it’s going to be tough to justify why you really have an al-
liance,” states Underhill. “If you can’t measure it, you don’t really have the
proof that the supplier is the best for the overall organization.”
Developing Service Alliances
Opportunities for service alliances should not be overlooked in this era of
partnering. Experts claim that much of what is true about alliances for mate-
rials may also be said about service alliances. In addition, selecting potential
service providers may be more of an art than selecting material partners is.
Be aware that service alliances differ in that fewer potential partners may
be available. This means that more relationships may have to be developed.
Pros recommend the following seven steps for developing a service alliance:
1. Identify suppliers that can beneﬁt from the alliance. In many instances, the
greatest beneﬁt to a supplier is that labor may be better used because the
buyer can assist with forecasting demand. Another advantage to service al-
liances is that the supplier may train employees for procedures speciﬁc to the
Logistics Management and Strategy
171

logistics manager’s needs. However, it is essential to ﬁnd suppliers who will
beneﬁt from the alliance so that they will be motivated to ensure its success.
2. Develop a total cost model. The purpose of an alliance is to increase over-
all efﬁciencies, not simply reduce prices. However, service providers are often
small organizations, so it may be necessary to assist the provider in developing
a cost model. You can adapt the cost model used for materials for services.
3. Clearly deﬁne the roles of both parties. Both parties must be clear on
which company and precisely who within the company is responsible for the
various alliance activities. 
4. Develop evaluation measures. The evaluation of a service alliance is sub-
jective, so it is important that the supplier understand the evaluator’s biases
and how best to work with them. Also, it can be helpful to develop a check-
list to assist the process. Joint collaboration of the development of the mea-
sures will ensure that both parties take advantage of the expertise and con-
sider both perspectives.
5. Establish formal communication systems between both parties. Again, it is
important that the communication procedures be agreed upon early in the
alliance discussions.
6. Continually evaluate service performance. Unlike materials, services can-
not be put on the shelf. Services are generally independent of each other and
may require independent evaluations. Although related to measurements
and formal communications, the recommendation is to communicate the
measurements among the parties. Also, the more frequent the evaluation,
the better. However, it must be balanced on number and complexity. Here
again, a primary difference between services and materials is that the service
provider is often being directly evaluated. Evaluating people is far different
from evaluating a product.
7. Develop problem-solving and dispute procedures. No alliance is without
some problems. If both parties know they have a vehicle by which their con-
cerns may be heard, they will probably be more willing to express their
viewpoints and suggestions.

Outsourcing remains a viable option for many companies today, and pur-
chasing professionals, more frequently, are at the center of these critical

make-or-buy decisions. In fact, Michael G. Patton, president and CEO of
Corporate Strategic Services, Inc. (Columbus, Ohio; 614-760-9280), sees
this outsourcing phenomenon as transforming traditional buyers and con-
tract administrators into sourcing managers and administrators. 
The What and Where of Value-Added
Of even more signiﬁcance, purchasing professionals are being asked to iden-
tify core competencies within the company and to recommend where spe-
ciﬁc processes can be better managed and operated by external suppliers.
“By honing the core competencies of its suppliers, as well as looking
inward at its own core values, purchasing methodologies have adopted
outsourcing as a viable way to add value in the supply chain,” say Robert J.
DeFranco, EMC Corporation (Hopkinton, Mass.; 508-435-1000) and Mi-
chael D. Clark, Purchasing and Materials Consulting, Inc. (Yarmouth,
Maine; 207-846-4026). 
“What may have begun as restructuring and cost cutting to simply save
money has become a sophisticated process of value-added operations that
blend more than one methodology,” they told a recent International Pur-
chasing Conference of the National Association of Purchasing Management
(NAPM).
A Caution Is Sounded 
“Outsourcing essential services to external providers is all the rage these
days, and can be an appropriate action to take,” agrees Eberhard E. Scheuing,
CPM, APP, of St. John’s University (New York, N.Y.; 718-990-6770).
However, in his book Value-Added Purchasing: Partnering for World-Class
Performance (Crisp Publications), he advises purchasing professionals, “It is
wise to look before you leap.” Speciﬁcally, “If a decision is made to out-
source, the ﬁxed cost that supported prior in-house production of the ser-
vice must be removed to reap the full beneﬁts of this move.”
Furthermore, additional cost for service elements not contracted for
with the external provider may enter the picture. “After all, the price of a
product or service is not its total cost,” Scheuing reminds.
Other risks identiﬁed by Patton include “outsourcing contracts that are
so complex that companies have to hire consultants to evaluate proposals,
and long-term contracts with outside suppliers that are no longer competi-
tive.” He does offer an 11-point program to plan and launch a successful out-
sourcing initiative (see sidebar).

11 Steps to a Successful Outsourcing Initiative
Success in outsourcing depends on having a clear vision, a deﬁned corporate
strategy, knowledge of what it currently takes to deliver the outsourced com-
modity, what service levels must be met, and what it costs to meet them. Once
you have identiﬁed what is to be outsourced, take the following actions:
1. Select your team. If you are outsourcing a complex product or service,
form a cross-functional team. The team leader would come from the
purchasing function. The other members of the team would be in-
dividuals that represent the product/service being outsourced or
those affected by the product/service being outsourced.
2. Understand your cost structure. Using tools such as expenditure analysis
and process mapping, detail the costs involved in providing this
product/service. Make a complete and detailed inventory of the var-
ious personnel, licenses, equipment, leases, facilities, and any other
resources, assets, and contracts that are currently required to produce
the item or perform the function being outsourced. Use metrics,
benchmarks, and other tools to evaluate existing capabilities and
costs of the function being outsourced. Include all conversion costs
for the function being outsourced.
3. Develop service-level agreements (SLAs). Meet with the internal clients
that had provided this function and develop SLAs that deﬁne the na-
ture of the services as well as performance measurements, quality
levels, and other relevant metrics or key performance indicators
(KPIs) and any transfer pricing. Include baseline performance mea-
sures and the formula for measurement.
4. Determine the length of the outsourcing contract. It is in the interest of the
purchaser to negotiate a shorter-term contract that provides ample
ﬂexibility. Whatever the length of the contract, you should provide
a reasonable exit of convenience in case the relationship becomes
unmanageable.
5. Develop a statement of work. This is the most critical portion of any
outsourcing agreement. This document should specify exactly what,
when, where, how, why, and by whom this function will be per-
formed and the manner in which this performance will be measured.
6. Identify potential suppliers. Conduct preliminary due diligence on all
prospective suppliers before determining if you are going to out-
source. Determine how many companies can provide the function
you are planning to outsource, where they are located, and the geo-
graphic area that they can support.

New Skills Required 
It is obvious when reviewing the details of this plan that purchasing profes-
sionals who are becoming involved with outsourcing will require a new, or
an expanded, skill set.
Patton, also speaking at a NAPM annual meeting, recommends that
purchasing professionals “inventory the skills you need to effectively de-
velop, manage, implement, and sustain an outsourcing program.” The “typ-
ical” new skills he lists include the following:
• Contract development. One must have the ability to develop sound,
competent, comprehensive contracts that fully protect the organization
while being fair to the outsource provider.
• Contract administration. This is the most commonly overlooked and
underestimated area. In outsourcing, the signiﬁcance of contract admin-
istration takes on a whole new meaning. It will not be successful if the

7. Identify internal resources. Identify all critical internal resources that
will stay with your company after the function has been outsourced
and who will help manage and administer the outsourced function.
8. Develop a strategic plan. Identify the long-term needs of your company
for the function being outsourced and incorporate these projected
needs into any outsourcing agreement.
9. Determine which outsourcing strategy ﬁts best. It is important to review
and consider which options will ﬁt best for your current environ-
ment and meet your long-range goals.
10. Develop a prequaliﬁcation process. Develop a prequaliﬁcation form and
have all potential suppliers complete it prior to determining your
candidate list. This form should provide relevant information re-
garding the capabilities of any potential company to provide you
with outsourcing services.
11. Have your facility inspected. Inspections of potential outsourcing pro-
viders should occur after your analysis of the prequaliﬁcation forms
has been completed. On-site inspections of their clients where the
outsourcing company is providing functions should also occur, if al-
lowed.

purchaser assumes a passive posture. Therefore, all contracts should be ad-
ministered in a consistent and professional manner.
• Experience in cross-functional teams. It is extremely beneﬁcial for pur-
chasing professionals to possess the ability to form, participate, and lead a
group of diverse individuals who are not as familiar with many of the strate-
gies and processes commonly used in contract development and negotia-
tions.
• Ability to manage relationships. Purchasing leaders must suppress their
egos and give credit to others rather than themselves for providing a service
more effectively or efﬁciently than they had been able to do in the past.
• Financial analysis. You must perform a ﬁnancial analysis of all costs as-
sociated with the product being outsourced to then determine the potential
savings or additional or transferred costs. 
• Process ﬂow analysis. This will ensure that all processes that are in-
cluded in the acquisition of products and services outsourced are accounted
for and included in the development of the cost structure for outsourcing.
In concluding his remarks, Patton added, “Understanding where,
when, and how to successfully outsource will be one of the most important
business skills purchasing professionals will need for the future as you are
challenged to do more with less.”

What separates the e-retail winners from the losers is how well they fulﬁll
their orders. One prominent e-retailer, opening two new fulﬁllment centers
for a total of 1.9 million square feet of distribution and warehouse space, is
dedicated to “owning the customer experience,” says its chief operating of-
ﬁcer. “Our new initiatives will dramatically improve our turnaround and de-
livery time and give us maximum ﬂexibility in meeting our customers’ ship-
ping needs.” The facilities are modular and designed to accommodate future
growth.
Many other retailers, however, are choosing to outsource, drop ship,
and in some cases even purchase a ﬁrm with this expertise instead of trying
to build it themselves. Whichever approach you take depends on your spe-
ciﬁc needs. The following sections should help reveal which is best for you.
176

Three Fulfillment Models
How well you meet customers’ shipping requirements depends on the ful-
ﬁllment model that you choose. For optimum control over online cus-
tomers’ shopping, brand identity, long-term cost, and the fastest Internet
speed, it is best to bring e-fulﬁllment in-house. But beware of the draw-
backs—a large, upfront capital investment, a steep learning curve, and the
time to build and conﬁgure the fulﬁllment network.
Many Internet retailers who do not consider e-fulﬁllment to be their
core competency look outside for e-fulﬁllment expertise. Following are
three common ways in which Internet retailers can quickly begin fulﬁlling
orders:
1. Outsource to a fulﬁllment service provider (FSP). This makes a lot of sense
during the early stages of online selling because order volumes are typically
low and unpredictable. For an average of $.30 to $1 per order, an Internet
retailer can begin shipping orders through an FSP.
An increasing number of companies are positioning themselves as FSPs,
having spun off from established distribution companies, or are 3PLs target-
ing business-to-consumer customers. Examples are 3PF.COM, Inc. (Port-
land, Oreg.), Connextions.net (Orlando, Fla.), Modus Media International,
Inc. (Westwood, Mass.), PFSweb, Inc. (Plano, Texas), SubmitOrder.com,
Inc. (Dublin, Ohio), GATX Logistics, Inc. ( Jacksonville, Fla.), NFI Inter-
active Logistics (Vineland, N.J.), TNT Logistics North America (Missis-
sauga, Ontario), and USF Logistics (Long Grove, Ill.).
Other FSPs are evolving from catalog or express delivery organizations
looking to take advantage of their existing fulﬁllment infrastructure: ASD
Systems, Inc. (Garland, Texas), Fingerhut Business Services, Inc. (Min-
netonka, Minn.), J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (Plano, Texas), Keystone In-
ternet Services, Inc. (Weehawken, N.J.), Federal Express Corp. (Memphis,
Tenn.), and United Parcel Service (UPS; Atlanta, Ga.).
However, if retailers become successful and order volumes increase dra-
matically, economies of scale move toward the owning of their e-fulﬁllment
infrastructure rather than outsourcing.
2. Drop ship from suppliers. A good way for Internet retailers to offer
a variety of goods without holding inventory is to source everything
from individual suppliers and have them drop ship orders directly to cus-
tomers. This option offers the least amount of control but is scalable and
quick.
Logistics Management and Strategy
177

3. Acquire expertise. If you want to maintain control over e-fulﬁllment
but lack the logistics experience, try buying it from someone who does. Dis-
tributors and mail-order houses have networks in place and years of fulﬁll-
ment experience.
Software Dedicated to Order Fulfillment
Another way to facilitate order fulﬁllment is to purchase dedicated software.
However, ﬁnding the right solution is proving difﬁcult for some logisticians.
“Companies today are realizing the importance of fulﬁllment, but with
[software] vendors creating so much noise about their capabilities, compa-
nies are spending an inordinate amount of time simply trying to understand
what’s real,” says David J. Simbari, president and CEO at Optum, Inc.
(White Plains, N.Y.). In addition, many systems that currently exist do not
have the functionality to meet online requirements. Thus, a new breed of
software is being born.
Stand-alone order management systems (OMS) are attempting to ﬁll the
void left by existing solutions such as ERP systems. The new OMS offers are
highly scalable and feature real-time multichannel order processing, in-
bound call center functionality, line-item independence, order personaliza-
tion, cross-sell and up-sell capability, order status visibility, product sourcing
optimization, and returns processing. 
OMS vendors include CommercialWare, Inc. (Natick, Mass.), Galleon
Distributed Technologies, Inc. (Bellevue, Wash.), InterWorld Corp. (New
York, N.Y.), OpenOrders, Inc. (Newton, Mass.), OrderFusion (San Diego,
Calif.), and Yantra Corp. (Acton, Mass.).
Working in conjunction with the OMS is the WMS, which must be
highly scalable, ﬂexible, and conﬁgurable, and must have intelligent deci-
sion-support capability. At a minimum, a WMS needs to execute the in-
structions sent to it by an OMS to prepare an order for shipment.
Given the low-order volumes currently moving through many e-
fulﬁllment operations, most WMS applications will meet the basic ware-
housing requirements of Internet retailers. Make certain that solutions that
offer advanced capability and functionality that extend beyond the ware-
house include cross docking, labor management, value-added services, and
reverse logistics.
A third software solution is the order fulﬁllment system (OFS) designed
speciﬁcally for e-fulﬁllment. AMR Research, Inc., says that it should in-
clude supply chain executive management, real-time, available-to-promise,
178
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

and supply chain reoptimization functionality. “Only such a tightly inte-
grated suite will provide Internet retailers the real-time inventory visibil-
ity, order control, and customer service levels they need to satisfy their in-
creasingly demanding customers,” says Chris J. Newton, analyst at AMR
(Boston; 617-542-6600).
A Change In Management Style
Satisfying online customer demand also requires management skills. AMR of-
fers these suggestions for altering your style and your company’s online image.
• Think of yourself as an online logistics company. Success in Internet re-
tailing is determined more by the ability to deliver on-time, complete orders
than by marketing and merchandising skills. Even if order fulﬁllment is out-
sourced, you still need an understanding of the logistics of fulﬁllment.
• Approach e-fulﬁllment as a process, not as a series of tactical operations. Ef-
fective order fulﬁllment requires a comprehensive plan for business processes
and information technology. The traditional business model of functional
handoffs between autonomous business units will not work in Internet com-
merce.
• Do not overlook employee training. In the rush to get to market, there’s
a strong temptation to skimp on training. Online customers expect high lev-
els of customer service. Make sure your customer service reps and ware-
house personnel have the proper skills and IT training to ensure a quality ex-
perience for your customers.
• Remember that Internet retailing is not a vertical industry. When selecting
a WMS application for your fulﬁllment center, choose from vendors who
specialize, through product functionality and domain knowledge, in your
vertical industry.
• Avoid making short-term system decisions. Although a WMS application
that meets 60% of your functional requirements will enable you to ship or-
ders, it could cripple long-term success. Make sure that your WMS applica-
tion can grow and adapt to changes in your business.
• Reward suite vendors. Pursuing a best-of-breed strategy runs counter
to speed-to-market requirements. Selecting vendors offering several com-
ponents, even if not a complete system, can reduce integration time and
costs, gain a higher level of system interoperability, and encourage contin-
ued development toward a true OFS suite.

Where will America’s fastest-growing companies be placing their attention
over the next year? That was the question PricewaterhouseCoopers, Inc.,
asked CEOs in the product and service sectors. The two leading answers
were customer service and cost control (see Table I-5.2) and that CEOs ex-
pect logistics managers to pull all the pieces together. “The responses indi-
cate that people are getting back to basics with respect to business,” says Lee
Durham, middle market manager for assurance and business advisory ser-
vices at PwC (New York; 212-259-4496). “Customer service is more im-
portant because of competition, which will accelerate as the economy be-
gins to tighten. The same goes for costs,” Durham continues. “Sales growth
may be slowing, so it is now time to get costs under control.”
To perform better, Durham believes that many executives are looking
to logistics managers to turn things around. “Logistics managers should con-
centrate on all the processes that touch the customer, from delivery to
billing.”
Suppliers Are Closely Linked to Customers
This is the path that Computer Centerline (Greensberg, Pa.), a small com-
puter equipment installer for the education sector, is following. Company
CEO Rich Mazza reports that the operations manager is expected to forge
stronger relationships with suppliers to ensure that customers receive their
orders on time.
The problem is that there is not a single strategy in place for all orders.

Each order is planned differently in how it will be fulﬁlled. “We might get
one order from a school for ﬁve computers and another order of several hun-
dred computers for an entire district,” explains Mazza. “How we fulﬁll that
order depends on our vendors and their logistics operations. Unfortunately,
we don’t get a lot of cooperation from our suppliers.”
Mazza says that suppliers are also not cooperative when it comes to sat-
isfying particular customer requests. For instance, a customer may want cer-
tain software installed on the computer or may request a speciﬁc delivery
date. “To ensure that we respond to those requests, we have to dangle that
possible order in front of the vendors like a carrot to get them to comply,”
says Mazza.
The constant struggle with suppliers is causing Computer Centerline to
revamp its vendor strategy. Mazza explains, “We now work with three in-
dependent manufacturers, and none meet our customers’ needs. These ven-
dors are tying our hands because we are only as good as they will let us be.
So, we are considering having our machines built by just one company. We
hope this will allow us to meet our customers’ standards and work toward
developing partnerships with the schools so that we can ﬁgure out how to
serve them better. We want the customers to feel they are a part of our busi-
ness and dictate to us how to proceed.”
Better People Equals Cost Control
Just as people are at the core of Computer Centerline’s customer service strat-
egy, so too are they at the heart of cost control (see sidebar). Mazza strongly
believes that the number one way to control costs is better people. “They
make our business go,” he says. “Hiring cheap help costs money, so we have
made it a practice to pay more through bonuses and our employee-owned
formula. Offering low wages can really hurt you.”
In addition to better wages, James A. Tompkins, president of consulting
ﬁrm Tompkins Associates (Raleigh, N.C.; 919-876-3667), recommends of-
fering gimmicks as a way to gain and maintain skilled workers. “Consider
rafﬂing off a car every six months for those who have perfect attendance,” he
says. “You have to keep coming up with new schemes to make it a positive
experience to come to work.” You might also consider reconﬁguring shift
schedules to three 12s or four 10s to better ﬁt with individuals’ preferences.
In addition to the cost of keeping skilled labor around, CEOs are also
concerned about the rising labor costs associated with customer demands
for order consolidation, value-added services, and same-day delivery. “The

SKU proliferation, increased warehouse space, and amount of labor re-
quired to carry out these tasks add cost to the network,” says Tompkins.
“Some trendsetter ﬁrms may wind up installing automation to perform the
activities as it is cheaper in the long run.”
The Role of the Internet
Leading-edge ﬁrms also beneﬁt from the Internet and from the role it plays
in cost control and customer service. “In my view, all entrepreneurial busi-
nesses can beneﬁt greatly from focusing on customer service and cost con-

The Cost of Customer Service
Douglas M. Lambert, professor of marketing and logistics at the University of
North Florida, draws a clear parallel between customer service and cost con-
trol in the second edition of The Warehouse Management Handbook, published
by Tompkins Press. Each of the following elements of a customer transaction
should be managed closely to meet demand and control cost.
1. Stockout level. Stockouts should be recorded by product and by cus-
tomer to determine where problems exist. When stockouts do occur, arrang-
ing for suitable product substitution or expediting the shipment when the
product is replenished can maintain customer goodwill.
2. Order information. The ability to provide the customer fast and accu-
rate information about the status of inventory, orders, expected shipping and
delivery dates, and back orders is essential. 
3. Elements of the order cycle. It is important to monitor and manage each
component of the order cycle—from order entry to delivery—to determine
the cause of variations.
4. Expedition of shipments. Because expedited shipments are costly, deter-
mine which customers qualify. This should be based on how much individual
customers contribute to the manufacturer’s proﬁtability.
5. System accuracy. Mistakes can be costly. Errors should be recorded as a
percentage of the number of orders handled by the system.
6. Order convenience. This refers to the degree of difﬁculty a customer ex-
periences when placing an order. An appropriate performance measurement
is the number of errors as a percentage of number of orders.
7. Product substitution. Manufacturers should work closely with cus-
tomers to inform them and gain their consent to make a substitute.

trol,” says Steve Hamm, managing partner for PwC’s middle market advi-
sory services. “Each factor is of importance on its own, and both combine
synergistically in our Internet economy.”
Hamm believes that the Net offers customers speed, convenience, and
access, and businesses can better adapt to customer needs through analysis of
online ordering patterns. “Likewise, businesses can gain new control over
costs by linking the Net to their back-end operations,” Hamm continues.
“B2B [business-to-business] auctions and purchasing consortia are explod-
ing in number and offer signiﬁcant savings. In addition, e-networking with
strategic partners and subcontractors can greatly improve operating efﬁ-
ciency.”

According to the Outsourcing Institute, 55% of all third-party partnerships
fail within ﬁve years. Too often, this premise is ignored in the initial out-
sourcing contract, and what should be a business-like agreement between
parties turns into an adversarial struggle and an operational disruption for
those involved.
A recent book from the CLM (Oak Brook, Ill.; 630-574-0985), Logis-
tics Outsourcing: A Management Guide, by Clifford F. Lynch, offers advice on
why contracts need to be terminated and how to bow out of an outsourc-
ing agreement gracefully (see sidebar).
Strategic Terminations
There are several strategic reasons for an outsourcing relationship to end.
Even successful alliances sometimes terminate when the interests and focuses
of the parties change. Here are some examples:
• Mergers and acquisitions. This can result in a combined ﬁrm having
more distribution locations than it needs. One leading U.S. ﬁrm operated in
14 DCs for over 20 years and then found itself with over 200 facilities
as a result of three acquisitions. Although most of the operations were out-
sourced, well over 150 contracts had to be terminated as the network size re-
duced. Because of the full disclosure with which the ﬁrm conducted its
termination negotiations, there was little difﬁculty in ending the relationships.

10 Rules to a Beneﬁcial Outsourcing Relationship
1. Develop a strategy for outsourcing. Outsourcing should always be care-
fully thought out and measured against an in-house solution. This will help
identify relative strengths and weaknesses for each alternative. Include the
provider in the process from the beginning. 
2. Establish a rigorous provider selection process. Check industry sources, ex-
isting clients, and ﬁnancial health. Carefully analyze management depth,
strategic direction, information technology capability, labor relations, and
personal chemistry and compatibility.
3. Clearly deﬁne your expectations. A number of outsourcing relationships
have been unsuccessful because of unrealistic expectations. Providers are of-
ten asked to submit bids based on inadequate information about volume, size,
and frequency of shipments. Companies, on the other hand, lack accurate or
detailed knowledge of their own logistics activity. Such inaccuracies result in
providers’ developing costing for, and committing to, arrangements that do
not reﬂect reality.
4. Develop a good contract. Provide incentives to improve operations and
productivity with both parties sharing the beneﬁts. Clearly spell out obliga-
tions, expectations, and remedies.
5. Establish sound policies and procedures. Give the service provider an op-
erating manual. Ideally, the manual should be developed together and contain
all policies, procedures, and other necessary information for the efﬁcient op-
eration of the outsourcing arrangement.
6. Identify and avoid potential friction points. Both parties are usually aware
of friction points that may arise. Identify them in advance and develop a pro-
cedure for dealing with them.
7. Communicate effectively with your logistics partner. Failing to do this is a
major cause of a failing relationship.
8. Measure performance and communicate results. When setting up a rela-
tionship, clearly identify, agree upon, and communicate standards of perfor-
mance and measure performance regularly.
9. Motivate and reward providers. Compliments, recognition, awards, tro-
phies, and dinners are all proven motivators. Do not take good performance
for granted.
10. Be a good partner. Your provider’s ability to serve you and your cus-
tomers often can hinge on your own performance (or lack thereof ).

Some of the providers even agreed to early terminations without pen-
alties.
• Change in corporate or logistics strategy. This can result from realignments
of product offerings, target markets, or ordering and shipping philosophy.
• New providers. If the operations are continued at all, they will be com-
bined with those of other providers. In such cases, it would be helpful to
have the old and new providers work together during the transition. Reward
the provider for a smooth transition with bonuses.
Performance-Related Terminations
The most difﬁcult relationship terminations are those that result from the ac-
tual or perceived failure of the provider to perform in a satisfactory manner.
There are two basic methods of terminating a relationship for performance
deﬁciencies: failing to renew an agreement on its expiration date and termi-
nating early under the failure to perform provisions.
• Contract expiration. If at all practical, it is best to see an arrangement
through to its normal expiration date, making it unnecessary to prove per-
formance deﬁciencies and eliminate penalties and legal proceedings. How-
ever, the contract should prescribe how to carry out an early termination.
• Early termination. It is important that the relationship manager keep
the provider well informed about problem areas and the consequences of not
getting them resolved so that by the time a probationary period is declared,
it will come as no surprise to the provider.
The contract should clearly state how the notice of dissatisfaction will be
rendered and allow a reasonable time for the correction of deﬁciencies. If
they are not corrected within the given timeframe, it will be necessary to
give the provider a notice of termination.
There are six basic principles that should be remembered when termi-
nating a relationship early:
1. Do not act impulsively. Before the ﬁrst notice of unsatisfactory perfor-
mance is rendered, a contingency plan should have been developed and
communicated to the managers within the client ﬁrm.
2. Include the new provider in the planning process. If the operations being
terminated are transferred to another provider, involve the new provider
Logistics Management and Strategy
1 8 5

early in the planning process. Include a timeframe for an orderly transition
and determine how much volume could be transferred on shorter notice.
3. Develop alternative distribution points. If a total breakdown occurs be-
fore the new provider is ready to assume operations, optional shipping points
should be available. Other DCs can handle additional volume over the short
term, and contingency plans should be developed for doing so. Be sure that
adequate labor, equipment, and inventories are available.
4. Communicate internally. Keep marketing, sales, and other managers in-
formed of developments. They can help minimize customer issues. As a lo-
gistics manager, acknowledge to others that the outsourcing relationship
went bad and that you are taking appropriate contingent and corrective ac-
tion.
5. Try not to become emotional. The client managers should maintain
equilibrium and handle the myriad of details in a professional manner.
6. Break clean. When it is over, it is over. Learn from the mistakes that
were made and carry on to make the new relationship successful.
Emotional Terminations
Some logistics outsourcing relationships are terminated when there are no
good business reasons for doing so. This will happen with changes in client lo-
gistics management. New managers may feel more comfortable with providers
that they have dealt with in the past. In other instances, provider managers may
change ﬁrms, and clients will want to follow them to their new afﬁliations.
In situations such as these, expect the worst. In some cases, the new
provider has been sued, and there is a potential to get caught up in disputes
between employees and employers. Lynch warns that the client should be
cautious in entering transactions where personalities are the determining
factor.
Terminations for Cost Reasons
In some instances, a provider who renders very satisfactory service simply
becomes too expensive. When this happens, the client may turn the opera-
tion over to a new provider or bring it back in-house. Since there are no per-
formance issues, these terminations almost always occur at the end of the
contract term and are much less adversarial. 
Such terminations should be carefully considered. Make sure that there
186
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

are valid comparisons between the acceptance of the existing provider’s new
increased rate structure and the cost of not accepting it. When the costs of
relocations, training, and executive distractions are considered, the rate in-
crease may be the low-cost alternative.

There is no more accurate barometer of the current state of the logistics pro-
fession and the logistics professional than the The Ohio State University Sur-
vey of Career Patterns in Logistics. Bernard (Bud) J. La Londe, professor emer-
itus at OSU (Lalonde.3osu.edu), developed the annual survey almost three
decades ago. Career Patterns polls senior U.S. logistics and supply chain ex-
ecutives who are current members of the CLM, and it is not only a reliable
and credible benchmark but also an accurate prognosticator of events still to
come.
The State of Logistics
In this respect, The Ohio State University Survey of Career Patterns in Logistics,
co-authored by La Londe and Terrance L. Pohlen of the University of North
Florida (Tpohlenunf.edu), does not disappoint. Among the highlights, which
were presented at a recent CLM Annual Conference are the following:
• Inventory management remains a critical area of responsibility for logistics ex-
ecutives. Almost four out of ﬁve (77.6%) respondents mention inventory
control as an area of responsibility (see Figure I-5.1). This ranks right behind
the more “traditional” responsibilities of trafﬁc management (94.0%), ware-
housing (91.4%), and plant/warehouse location (87.9%). However, Pohlen
notes the steady increase in international logistics and order processing/en-
try. “International is up signiﬁcantly over the last ﬁve years, reﬂecting the
globalization movement in the U.S.,” he observes.
Another interesting development is the increase in order processing,
which has also become a logistics function. “This reﬂects the continuing
trend of the consolidation of a lot of previously independent functions, such
as production planning, scheduling, and capacity planning, all under logis-
tics,” Pohlen reﬂects.

• The population of women in logistics is growing. Respondents to the sur-
vey were 89% male and 11% female. This closely parallels CLM member-
ship, which is estimated at about 10% female. It also reveals the growing in-
ﬂuence of women in logistics (see sidebar). Three years earlier, for example,
the survey respondents were 95% male and 5% female.
• Logistics is becoming more centralized. The corporate structure of logis-
tics still reﬂects a combination of both divisional and centralized activities.
The combined format is used by 46% of the respondents. “Over the last sev-
eral years, the combined organizational form has been the most widely used,
while the centralized approach to logistics organization has grown in im-
portance,” observes La Londe. The survey ﬁnds that 23% of the respondents
report that logistics functions are centrally organized. The number of ﬁrms
reporting logistics as part of each corporate division or as a separate logistics
division has decreased.
• Welcome to the supply chain management department. When classiﬁed ac-
cording to department, fewer respondents worked in logistics than in distri-
bution three years ago. Now, 52.3% of the CLM respondents worked in lo-
gistics, 14.6% in distribution, and 12.1% in supply chain management (up

How Women in Logistics See Themselves, Their Jobs,
and Their Profession
Representing an estimated 10% of the membership in the CLM and growing
numbers in undergraduate and graduate logistics programs, it is a slam dunk
that women will play an increasingly important role in logistics.
That’s why Martha C. Cooper at OSU (cooper.7osu.edu) developed the
Career Patterns of Women in Logistics survey four years ago. Despite its short his-
tory, the annual survey presents many insightful and valuable conclusions
about female logistics executives. 
Cooper polls women members of the CLM. She cautions her audience
to “avoid generalizing the results of this survey,” as it is a biased sample that
may not represent the general population of women in logistics. In our opin-
ion, Cooper’s ﬁndings have great relevance in deﬁning the role, responsibili-
ties, and attitudes of women in logistics. The following come from the ﬁnd-
ings in the 2000 Career Patterns of Women in Logistics:
About Themselves
•
Most respondents are 30 to 50 years old (79.8%); 7.6% are under 30,
and 12.6% over 50. Two-thirds are married, and 23% have never been mar-
ried.
•
Half the respondents (51.8%) felt that it was “difﬁcult” or “very difﬁ-
cult” to balance a career and family. Less than one-ﬁfth (18.3%) felt it was “not
difﬁcult at all” or “not very difﬁcult.”
•
The highest degree attained was an undergraduate degree, but few are
in logistics. A large proportion of the respondents had graduate degrees, and
the MBA was the most frequent graduate degree.
About the Work Environment
•
By job title, the largest category is manager (40%), followed by direc-
tor (23%), vice president (13%), and analyst (9%). Only 2% head their organ-
ization.
•
Almost one in three (32.1%) have direct responsibility for logistics
functions; 23.7% have advisory responsibility, and 44.2% have direct respon-
sibility for some logistics functions and advisory for others.
•
Female logistics executives spend an average of 51.2 hours on the job,
three-quarters of which is in the ofﬁce. Respondents also travel, spending an
average 37 nights away from home and taking 1.5 international trips per year.
(continued)

from just 5% in 1998). Although the current survey ﬁnds “stability” in the
logistics department (52%), supply chain management reporting relation-
ships (17.7%) enjoyed another large increase. 
International Focus Becomes More Dominant
These emerging trends are also reﬂected in the “degree of authority” that
the respondents have over each logistics activity (see Figure I-5.2). For ex-
ample, the activity with the highest ranking of direct authority in the latest
survey is international logistics (90%). 
Only last year, international logistics (68% direct authority) lagged far
behind general management (82%), trafﬁc management (80%), warehousing
(80%), plant/warehouse location (73%), and packaging (70%). Meanwhile,
in the latest OSU survey inventory control moved to 78% direct authority,
from last year’s 64%, showing a renewed focus on inventory management.
Logistics executives, when asked about the amount of time they spend
190
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T
•
Female executives have a participative (52.1%) rather than a directive
(15.5%) management style, but 32.5% felt it was more of a combination. They
are much more likely (65.9%) to facilitate decision making rather than directly
telling subordinates what to do. One-quarter felt they use a combination of
both.
About the Profession
•
Most respondents (75.5%) are satisﬁed with their current positions
and feel that the opportunities for building a sound professional career in lo-
gistics are better (90.4%) today than every before.
•
Respondents indicated that what they like best about logistics are that
it utilizes different areas of expertise, that it is a fast-paced environment, and
that it is challenging. They also felt that they can make a difference and inter-
act with other functions, that there is customer contact, and that there is an
opportunity to train and be taught.
•
Respondents least liked the lack of understanding of logistics by top
managers, the stress, the high concentration of males in the ﬁeld, the need to
keep up with the constant changes, and the long hours.
•
Contributing most to respondents’ success was both the analytical
skills that are job-related as well as the “softer” management and personal
skills. Dedication, hard work, and determination ranked ﬁrst (see Figure
I-5.4). Having a good education in logistics or operations was also a plus.

of speciﬁc activities, reported that they devote the most to trafﬁc manage-
ment, general management, and warehousing (see Figure I-5.3). Interna-
tional logistics and inventory control each account for 7.8% of the logistics
executive’s time.

among Responsibilities

E-Commerce Is the Future
If the respondents could return to school for a period of 90 days, 21% re-
ported that they would select a curriculum in information systems/technol-
ogy; 16% selected e-commerce; and 15% mentioned global business pro-
cesses. “This shifting response from earlier surveys shows the dominance of
information technology and e-commerce as learning needs for contempo-
rary logistics and supply chain executives,” La Londe concludes.
This emphasis was reinforced by a question on the future of logistics
and factors that will inﬂuence its growth and development. E-Commerce/
e-business (34%) outpaced the ﬁeld, with supply chain management integra-
tion (26%) and international (10%) cited as the most inﬂuential factors.

The team approach to developing a business strategy is often taught in MBA
programs but rarely used in the real world. One logistics manager, however,
has been uniquely successful in realizing its theoretical potential. Since com-
ing on board with its strategic emphasis, Martha H. McMahon, worldwide
logistics manager at Sequent Computer Systems, Inc. (Beaverton, Ore.;
503-578-7580), declares that the team approach has been responsible for
toppling logistics costs by one third while improving inventory velocity and
reducing inventory overall.
Keys to Sequent’s Success
1. Strong logistics teams. The team has a manager who reports to McMa-
hon. Among the team members are the corporate distribution manager, cus-
tomer service logistics manager, and representatives from the import staff,
export staff, and trafﬁc staff.
McMahon also serves on the team. “We frequently bring in consultant
members from other Sequent organizations, such as accounts payable, com-
puter applications, warehouse staff, packaging commodity manager, and in-
ternational subsidiary logistics staff,” she explains.
2. Keeping few suppliers. Sequent’s shipping is primarily by air, without
ocean or rail transport. There is a little LTL. “We have a narrow supplier base
with our logistics providers,” she noted at a recent Proven Performance Met-
rics in Logistics conference (Institute for International Research, New
York). “We try to increase business with existing providers to keep the num-
ber of providers limited.”
3. Creating commodity teams. The commodity team is responsible for the
logistics supplier and evaluation process. The formal process begins with the
request for quote. “We try to keep this down to less than ﬁve potential sup-
pliers quoting,” she explains. Commodity team members conduct the eval-
uation. The process includes supplier presentations and site visits. Where
appropriate, the team is extended to include members from Sequent’s inter-
national subsidiaries.
4. One provider, one service. Sequent prefers this arrangement. This
includes one courier, a single international airfreight forwarder, one
heavyweight air carrier, and an LTL provider. Also, Sequent prefers single
Logistics Management and Strategy
193

providers for small-package domestic and international air, 3PL for ware-
housing support service, and van lines.
A small supplier base also improves the quality of supplier manage-
ment, she maintains. “We have the benefit of receiving special considera-
tion from our suppliers, which fall into a variety of categories,” she con-
fides. As an example, she mentioned the UPS strike. “There was no impact
to our pickup and delivery time.” Nor was there inventory buildup on
their shelves.
“One beneﬁt of a limited supplier is that it really minimizes supplier
management cost and enables us to better control inventory,” McMahon in-
sists. “We focus our energy with the supplier who has a major impact, in-
stead of spreading ourselves over a large supplier base.” Further, with some
of the suppliers, Sequent serves as a beta site to prove out a new technology.
For instance, she tells of utilizing a new tracking system that “wasn’t quite
on board yet,” for the supplier’s other customers.
5. Favoring long-term contracts. “Our formal, written, multiyear contracts
are typically for a period of three years,” McMahon notes. This has protected
Sequent from annual price increases. However, she notes, “We also bench-
mark in the second year of the contract, so we know that our rates are still
competitive within the marketplace.” The team’s goal is to be in the ﬁrst
quartile of the competitive pricing that they benchmark.
6. Meeting with all suppliers. “In our formal logistics supplier manage-
ment process, we have regularly scheduled meetings with our providers,”
says McMahon. “We produce an annual calendar each year that speciﬁes
when all meetings will be conducted.” This includes all quarterly reviews
and the semiannual executive performance reviews. “Here, our executives
will meet with the appropriate supplier executives to discuss the state of our
mutual business relationship,” she explains. Further, a supplier report card is
prepared for this meeting.
7. Importance of performance metrics. “We have quarterly goals that are es-
tablished for each metric. They are in writing and agreed to by the suppli-
ers and ourselves,” McMahon explains. “The team notes the results of each
performance measure each quarter and rates each as ‘exceeded,’ ‘met,’ or
‘did not meet expectations.’” Typically, the report will have between 15 and
25 monitored expectations. The logistics commodity team tracks the trends
and documents all aspects of the relationship.
Following are some unique aspects of some of the individual perfor-
mance metrics. 
194
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

• On-time delivery metrics. “We tailor on-time delivery metrics to that
provider since each is different and provides a different type of service,” she
maintains. In addition, the only failures allowed for on-time delivery are air-
port closures related to weather. “We generally don’t allow for weather or
mechanical failures.”
Her biggest problem is achieving 100% on-time delivery across the
board. “Some segments of it, in small-packaging LTL, for instance, achieve
it,” she notes. “However, our major challenge is to bring that level of activ-
ity up to above 99% on a consistent basis so we can focus our time on other
things relating to what happened to that shipment.”
• Quality metrics. “We use written closed-loop corrective action, and
our report cards monitor the number of corrective action forms that are is-
sued and the response time of the supplier,” McMahon explains. “Our chal-
lenge now is to get the long-term corrective actions into place.”
• Customer service metrics. “Here we have a much more subjective team
assessment of supplier performance,” she offers. They look at the response
time from the supplier’s staff, such as pickup and delivery timing. There is
also a “very soft” metric, and that is whether the supplier is ﬂexible in meet-
ing Sequent’s needs. “Sometimes we’re a really challenging customer,” she
acknowledges. “But we discuss this with our supplier and work with them
to make sure they are able to meet our demands.”
• Cost performance metrics. “We spend a great deal of time looking at the
cost drivers,” says McMahon. “We attend seminars with our suppliers and
work with them on a cost driver analysis.” They try to identify the elements
of cost that can be jointly worked on to decrease the total cost to the corpo-
ration. “We even have a speciﬁc cost reduction initiative in place where
we’re looking at everything from actual rates to the things we may be doing
that suppliers point out to us that are not cost-effective,” she details.
8. Logistics supplier feedback. How are we doing as a customer? That is an
important question Sequent asks of its suppliers. “We ask our suppliers to as-
sess performance,” McMahon offers. “However, this is a challenge for them.
Typically, they’re conservative and nervous expressing what they really
think.”
McMahon and the logistics team try to be supportive of the feedback
process. “We encourage them, and we frame the approach as, ‘What are we
doing that makes sense? What drives you crazy? How can we ﬁx it to-
gether?’” After a slow start, she acknowledges that “we’re now starting to get
meaningful feedback from suppliers.”

9. Logistics team goals. “A quarterly performance metric we do on our
team is to ask ourselves, ‘How are we doing as a team managing the logis-
tics needs of the corporation?’ And for our logistics commodity team we
have annual program goals.” For this year the goals are the following:
• On-time delivery: 97%
• Quality: Less than ﬁve claims per quarter for the entire supplier base
• Cost: 98% of logistics expenditures with preferred suppliers
• Quarterly performance reviews

Logistics managers are now playing an increasingly important role in how
new products are launched. Sprint PCS, for example, recently engaged its
logistics experts in several intense product launches over the past ﬁve years,
particularly in the area of telephone calling cards.
According to Gary Mendez, manager of prepaid card logistics for Sprint
in Kansas City, this step has helped put the company and the product in a
strong marketing position. For those looking for some tips on how to get in-
volved, Mendez addressed these issues at a recent Logicon Conference.
Understanding the Customers
It is important to recognize who your customer is and how your product is
being sold to the ﬁnal consumer. At Sprint, for example, the consumer is the
card user, whereas Sprint’s actual customer is the entity who purchases the
card for resale to that consumer. Typically these are drug and grocery stores.
“We can best meet consumer wants by exceeding customer needs,” says
Mendez. “This involves making sure that the product is available for the
consumer at all times.” 
He adds that it is also important to recognize customers’ pressures. For
instance, Sprint’s retail customers face large drivers in their business equa-
tion, such as pressures from competitors like Wal-Mart. “Pressure from these
mass merchants forces our customers to go to market with a format that of-
fers lower prices to the consumer. Fortunately, there are tools out there now
that are allowing our customers to compete in new ways, such as efﬁcient
196

consumer response [ECR].” Mendez believes that ECR is allowing grocers
access to accurate and timely information that supports their logistics deci-
sions. “ECR reverses the approach to product ﬂow. Conventional methods
push product through the system, but ECR is demand driven. Product ﬂow
is driven by consumer demand, needs, and purchasing patterns. Card sup-
pliers can now know exact consumer demand based on point-of-sale data.”
Bump Up Your Marketing Skills
Mendez says that it is critical for logistics managers to create demand by di-
rectly targeting consumers. “Create brand awareness and educate consumers
and retailers. Encourage product use and have a product that consumers
want to use repeatedly.” Tactics include media support, point of sale mate-
rial, understanding product attributes, and micromarketing. “We used to of-
fer free sample calling cards on cereal boxes to build consumer awareness.”
Mendez says that micromarketing puts you in a position to know exactly
how your product is used right down to retailer and region of use. “It helps
establish corrective actions to be taken. For instance, we may ﬁnd that low-
end product denominations ($5 and $10 cards) are going out the door faster
in a certain region and that higher-end denominations ($100 cards) are not
selling at all.” 
You also want to make certain that the supply chain presents an oppor-
tunity to develop a competitive advantage. Leveraging the principles of
ECR to maximize delivery efﬁciency, a sound inventory processing system,
and retail sales coverage are proven tactics to gaining competitive advantage.
“An automated inventory management system gives point of sale informa-
tion that allows us to track demand. That helps set up inventory levels with
each retail customer.”

Processing returned goods is a time-consuming (and non-value-added) ac-
tivity for logistics managers. That is why many are looking to turn the func-
tion over to a third party. Take the case of Rite Aid Corp., which has been
handling all returned, damaged, and discontinued merchandise for its 3,800
stores nationwide. As the organization grew through a series of acquisitions,
the reverse logistics process became inconsistent and decentralized, explains
Logistics Management and Strategy
197

Kevin Sheehan, president and CEO of Processors Unlimited (Dallas; 972-
980-7825), a logistics subsidiary of USFreightways Corp. “As the company
continued to expand, it made sense to look in the market for an outside
company to coordinate returns processing,” says Sheehan.
Rite Aid selected Processors Unlimited for the job, says Amy Johnson,
director of public relations at Rite Aid. “Processors Unlimited services some
of the largest drugstore chains in the industry today; they know our prod-
uct, the vendors, and obviously know reverse logistics.”
Under the agreement, Processors Unlimited will work with Rite Aid
suppliers to dispose of and account for damaged, defective, outdated, dis-
continued, and recalled merchandise, previously shipped to Rite Aid stores. 
A Low-Cost Solution for Rite Aid
By centralizing returns processing, a single strategy could be applied to all
Rite Aid locations, explains Sheehan. If an item is recalled, it is pulled from
the store shelves and placed in storage within the store. Items returned or
damaged are also placed in storage until a delivery is made to the store. When
the delivery truck is unloaded, the returned goods are then loaded onto that
same truck and taken back to the Rite Aid DC. The items are cross-docked,
and a truckload shipment is sent to one of three Processors Unlimited facil-
ities for processing.
Each item is scanned for data collection. Based on that information,
items are sorted into disposition categories—they are either disposed of,
given to charity, shipped to the original manufacturer, or held for the man-
ufacturer to review. Some items are returned to stock.
Processors Unlimited also creates and sends a Rite Aid invoice to the
manufacturer, who then pays Rite Aid for the returned product. Processors
Unlimited also creates store credits, indicating the proﬁts and loss for each
Rite Aid store. Rite Aid’s only cost is transporting the items to Processors
Unlimited for handling, but Sheehan says that the manufacturer should re-
imburse the company for that cost.
Creating Better Supplier Relations
One of the main thrusts behind any reverse logistics program is the rela-
tionship it forges with suppliers. “It was important for Rite Aid to create a
fair and equitable relationship with its suppliers,” says Sheehan. “They want
fair and reasonable policies for supplier reimbursement.”
198
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

Johnson explains that Rite Aid suppliers will work directly with Proces-
sors Unlimited to determine how they want their merchandise handled once
it leaves a Rite Aid store. “Fortunately, most our suppliers are already famil-
iar with reverse logistics, so they already know how they want their goods
processed,” Sheehan says. “Managing supplier relationships is the critical fac-
tor in any reverse logistics program.”

Outsourcing international logistics activities can be a daunting experience
for logisticians. Giving up control of functions previously under your do-
main can be challenging enough on the domestic front, but when it is on a
global basis, the challenge becomes even greater.
However, the cost savings associated with outsourcing will outweigh your
trepidation. As a way to gain a level of comfort, try forging strategic alliances
with the outsource providers. This is the strategy that Case Corp. of Racine,
Wisconsin, chose, and according to Larry Trumbore, director of logistics and
supply chain operations, the company has been able to resolve issues of poor
cycle time, unreliable delivery, and too much ﬁnished goods inventory.
Trumbore, who shared his views with attendees at a recent Logicon
Conference, says that outsourcing enabled the construction and agricultural
equipment producer to concentrate on its core competency—manufactur-
ing—rather than on non-value-added services such as transportation. 
Tips for Successful Outsourcing
Trumbore says that he learned several lessons about what will and will not
work in executing an international outsourcing project. He offers up this ad-
vice to other logistics managers:
1. Work with consultants. Case worked with consultants who helped put
together a vision of what its supply chain should look like. That ultimately
made it easier to identify the activities to outsource.
2. Determine what to outsource. Trumbore says that the consultant identi-
ﬁed 11 projects that could be outsourced. Integrated logistics was one of
Logistics Management and Strategy
199

those. “We wanted to integrate all the functions of logistics throughout the
world and carry them out with only one or two providers,” says Trumbore.
“It’s tough to do your job if you don’t have the tools to do your job,”
says Trumbore. “So, give it to the 3PL.” Case, for instance, used to own its
own ﬂeet of trailers but turned the whole activity over to Schneider Na-
tional, Inc. (Green Bay, Wis.; www.schneider.com), and “never looked
back,” says Trumbore. “As a logistics manager, your job now is to manage
the activity, not to perform it.”
3. Select the carriers. Case selected Fritz Companies, Inc. (San Francisco;
415-904-8360) to act as the lead integrator for the international logistics op-
erations. Schneider National was selected to handle North American and
European ground transportation, and GATX Corp. (Chicago; 312-621-
6200) was chosen to oversee North American warehousing activities and
value-added service offerings.
The selection process took about six months for Case. Not only was the
company looking for pricing structures and services offered, but it was also
concentrating on letting the logistics providers know what services inter-
ested it. According to Trumbore, “Some fainted when we told them what
we wanted, while others were conﬁdent they could do it. This made it very
easy to narrow down our list from 26 providers to the three we chose.”
Trumbore warns, however, that although Case selected Fritz as the lead in-
tegrator, the concept of one global integrator can be a far stretch. He says
that it is important to realize that one logistics provider cannot always do
everything for your company.
4. Form a strategic alliance. Trumbore says that once the providers were
chosen, the key was getting the third parties together to form a logistics al-
liance that would offer Case a competitive marketplace advantage. “The
third parties know what logistics is, but didn’t really know how it could make
money for us or what areas to focus on.”
5. Deﬁne objectives and synergies. Case clearly deﬁned its corporate goals
to each of the 3PLs. “You have to be clear on your scope and not change the
direction as you continue through the outsourcing process,” says Trumbore.
“You basically want to say, ‘Here’s the state of the business currently, and
here’s where we want to go in the future.’”
Realize that 3PLs have different objectives than you, says Trumbore.
Their interests lie in market share, proﬁt, and how to gain a good reputa-
tion. “Explain to them that you are interested in leveraging their assets be-
cause they are better at certain functions than you are,” says Trumbore.

6. Remain open-minded about contracts. There are different approaches to
contracting with outsource providers. You may wind up with a different
contract for each of your providers. Trumbore says that you must understand
the baseline of where the logistics costs and services are starting from in or-
der to determine how to compensate the provider. “We didn’t know how
good we were and did not want to give money away or not pay enough to
the provider.”
7. Know where your business is heading. One goal of the contract is to ad-
dress your future business needs, not just those in the present. Case has re-
cently undergone a series of acquisitions and plant closings, which it did not
know would happen when it put together its provider contracts. “It would
have been nice to see in the future, but we couldn’t,” says Trumbore. “If pos-
sible, try to build your outsourcing program about what your company plans
are for the future.”
8. Trust your providers. “Some trust is necessary, but too much is dan-
gerous,” says Trumbore. “Can the provider really offer up what it says it can
deliver, such as real-time visibility to the part level?” He says that some pro-
viders will provide such details in the contract, while others simply write up
a one-page proﬁle of their services. “Experience says the devil is in the de-
tails, and you’ve got to get down to the nitty-gritty.”
9. Transition portions of the business to the 3PL. Case developed a ﬁve-year,
three-phase plan, which broke the project into measurable pieces. In the ﬁrst
year, the providers would just take over the outsourced functions, and Case
would measure how fast they did the job, how well they did it, and if it was
seamless to the customers. In the second phase, the providers began ex-
panding their understanding of what the other was doing and did a better
job of interacting with one another. In the ﬁnal phase, which will last the
next three years, a true strategic alliance is being formed to meet customer
expectations. Trumbore points out that you cannot outsource everything at
once and that you might have to manage a dual process until you get every-
thing transitioned. Try following a tightly coordinated timeline to facilitate
the transition.
10. Establish a single point of contact. “Anything a 3PL needs has to come
through me,” says Trumbore. “This keeps them focused.”
11. Become a better manager. Outsourcing changes your responsibilities as
a logistics manager. “You are now behind the scenes as a coach, giving your
team the signals and guiding them. You are no longer an active player on the
ﬁeld.”

There is a warehouse management system (WMS) in your future—espe-
cially if you manage a small to midsize facility that has traditionally shunned
such systems. Currently available and emerging WMS technology supports
better, more accurate inventory data. It also promotes the creation of an
end-to-end transaction process. Nevertheless, the planning and implemen-
tation process of a WMS solution is still complex and must be carried out
with care. Although there are no silver bullets to ease this process, there are
several critical junctures that require special attention.
Clearly deﬁne what you want to accomplish. “Deﬁne the needs and establish
the budget,” advises Richard Houyoux, president of Access Data Systems
Inc. (Blue Bell, Penn.; 610- 270-9800). “This is instrumental in getting to a
successful conclusion.” As evidence, he tells of a successful WMS installation
at Wieland Electric’s 41,000 square foot facility. The warehouse area con-
sumes only 14,000 square feet of ﬂoor space, with the rest housing ofﬁce and
manufacturing areas. And the budget for the system was set at $90,000.
“The ﬁrst thing the team did was to create an initial set of goals and ob-
jectives,” he offers. “A small team began by listing all of the activities they felt
they wanted to get out of the system.” In receiving, for instance, they wanted
the system to create bar code labels and integrate it with the receiving pro-
cess, to assign shelf space, and to update inventory information automatically.
They outlined similar wants for putaway and picking, shipping, and manu-
facturing. To facilitate the process, they used a checklist developed by Houy-
oux, which, in turn, is provided to various system vendors (see sidebar).

Understand what senior management wants. Meanwhile, Ben B. Gunter Jr.,
vice president of Sedlak Management Consultants, Inc. (Cleveland, Ohio;
bgunter@jasedlak.com), adds another dimension to the “needs and budget”
phase. He advises WMS teams to focus on the needs of management. “Im-
plementing a warehouse management system is still a business decision ﬁrst,”
he advises.
A recent study titled Warehouse Systems and the Supply Chain (Ware-
housing Education and Research Council, or WERC; Oak Brook, Ill.) also
ﬁnds that one of the “threads” of successful WMS implementation is exec-
utive input and sponsorship. “When a chief executive is the sponsor of the
project, the chances of being successful almost doubled,” the report notes. 
“Too often the teams believe they are merely buying a computer, soft-
ware, RF [radio frequency] terminals, or handheld scanner,” he told a Distri-
bution/Computer Seminar East (C. S. Report, Inc.; Uwchland, Pa.). When
the project team starts moving in this direction, “it’s time to remind them
it’s not a technology project, but a business one,” Gunter maintains.
Remember that preimplementation determinations are also a critical juncture
of the WMS project. Well before the technology is in place and ready to
be rolled out, the team should face the training issue. The trainees must be
identiﬁed (e.g., on-the-ﬂoor operations staff, supervisors, managers and
clerical staffs, maintenance staff, and information staff ). Also, early on the
team must make decisions about whether the training will be conducted by
the in-house training department, software vendors, a project consultant,
or a third party. 
Test, test, test. The rush to skip testing and avoid following a methodical
conversion plan is understandable, but this misconception accounts for more
delays and failures than anything else, according to the WERC study. “The
earlier you start testing, the sooner you get a true picture of what’s going on
with your module,” maintains Gunter. He recommends a seven-step testing
process: 
At the vendor’s site, perform
1. Perform unit/module testing.
2. Integrated systems testing.
At the warehouse or plant site, perform
3. Connectivity testing
4. Low-volume systems testing
Software and Technology

5. High-volume functional area testing (“You need to know what your
load will be now and in the future, so have the numbers in the spec
and have the vendor use them to conduct the tests”)
6. High-volume integration testing
7. User acceptance testing
Demand on-time delivery of all functionality. “When it’s time to go live,
if all you’ve requested is not ready, the vendor will start playing the ‘you pick
what is important’ game,” Gunter warns. “Don’t be drawn into the vendor’s
trap of having to choose which functionality will be delivered late. This is
the time to hang tough,” he urges.

NAPM S
The exhibition hall at a recent National Association of Purchasing Manage-
ment (NAPM) International Purchasing Conference was packed with ideas,
innovations, and imaginative solutions for the purchasing professional.
Again, e-commerce technology and the purchase card (P-card) ruled the
show. In fact, there were some announcements about the integration of the
P-card with a particular electronic procurement system:
• Visa U.S.A. was demonstrating its P-card pairing with software de-
veloped by Ariba Technologies to realize signiﬁcant time and cost savings
during the procurement process. During its pilot program, Visa explained
that the purchase of computer hardware, which once took three business
days to complete, was decreased to a mere 32 seconds, while administrative
costs were reduced from 50% to 90% of traditional paper-based purchasing
methods. On the payment end, the P-card enabled Visa to eliminate ﬁve
steps from the process. Visa is now expanding the program to all its em-
ployees.
• MasterCard International announced its enterprise deployment of
ELEKOM Procurement, from the 250-employee pilot to its 2,300 end
users. Thousands of transactions have been successfully completed between
MasterCard and its suppliers over the past eight months. The employees se-
lected goods and services from a local catalog, electronically placed orders,
and paid for the products using a MasterCard Corporate P-card.
Additionally, MasterCard said that the results of a recent survey found
that 64% of companies “would ﬁnd value in having one card that combines
the functions of a purchasing, ﬂeet, and T&E card.” First Chicago NBD will
begin issuing a MasterCard one-card solution this month for purchase,
travel, and ﬂeet needs.
• American Express revealed at a press conference that the company
has completed a training initiative involving its middle-market sales force.
The 250-plus dedicated account managers and salespeople will be focus-
ing their efforts on “aggressively expanding sales of the American Express
Corporate Purchasing Card to midsized companies,” according to S. Thayer
Stewart, vice president of marketing. A successful pilot program led to this
action. Meanwhile, without commenting on the MasterCard and Visa ac-
tions relative to their involvement with electronic procurement systems,

Stewart told us that American Express will be announcing a “much tighter
integration agreement in a couple of months.”
Energy Purchasing Specialists Steal the Show 
We think that the National Energy Team, a PECO Energy Company
(Philadelphia), was the hit of the show. We saw no booth or exhibit that had
as much trafﬁc as this modest one. The interest in PECO’s service reﬂects
the growing concern that purchasing professionals have about the deregula-
tion going on in the utility industry and about their emerging role and re-
sponsibility for negotiating future rates and service. 
“We have full-service energy consulting and procurement capabilities,
which we’re offering to purchasing professionals in both regulated and un-
regulated markets,” Sandra J. Barber, energy supply manager, explained dur-
ing an interview. 
According to Barber, the National Energy Team provides procurement
services for “nationally recognized clients’ facilities located throughout the
United States.” In addition, it provides a full range of energy consulting and
procurement services speciﬁcally targeted to corporations with multiple lo-
cations. “We have been able to reduce energy costs by up to 20% in many
cases,” Barber claims. No wonder so many purchasers were lined up seeking
more information.

Cheryl Camuso at 215-841-6474 or ccamuso@peco-energy.com.
New Solutions That Purchasing Professionals Are Considering
With the emphasis on e-comm and electronic procurement, we took the
opportunity to explore what the various vendors were promoting and mak-
ing available to the profession. The following is our annual review (in al-
phabetical order) of what we believe to be the newest and best of what we
saw at the NAPM show.
AGENTics introduces SupplyChannel. An enterprise-wide solution for
on-line procurement management, this system is installed on the buyer’s
side. Orders for approved goods from approved suppliers are placed via in-
tranet by users from their desktops. SupplyChannel is based on AGENTics’s
Distributed-Catalog technology, which enables users simultaneously to nav-
igate disparate on-line catalogs residing at different supplier sites, as though
they were one, uniﬁed catalog. Unique to this technology, suppliers do not

Not only is electronic data interchange (EDI) technology being considered,
but many purchasing professionals are now actively doing it. According to a
Supplier Selection and Management Report Cost Control Survey, more than one
Software and Technology
217

in ﬁve (21.6%) of purchasing professionals working in companies with fewer
than 500 employees are installing EDI technology. Furthermore, fewer than
one in four (23.1%) of respondents in organizations with more than 500 em-
ployees are doing the same.
Purchasing professionals participating in the survey, answering an open-
ended question cited EDI most often as the procurement/information tech-
nology that they are carrying out. Following behind, but at a distance, is the
Internet (10.5%) as the information technology of choice for procurement
departments. 
Scattered among the remaining majority of responses is a potpourri of
unique, innovative, and interesting electronic solutions that provide you
with much food for thought. Many of the respondents share their solution
and experiences, which we pass along for your consideration.
Installing ERP with EDI release to provide timely information to suppliers. A
sales/purchasing manager at a midsized producer of recreational products
notes, “We are implementing an ERP/requirements planning system and
coordinating it with EDI release.” She also allows that “most suppliers are
ready to go EDI and look forward to it. Further, all parties beneﬁt through
more accurate and timely information.”
Running the full gamut, from EDI to the Internet. A purchasing manager at
a large maker of snack foods has EDI in place already and notes that most
supplies like it. He also allows that on-line catalogs will be implemented in
about two years, and Internet/intranet/extranet technology/applications are
currently under review. “We hope to implement this in two to three years,”
he tells us. “One of the drivers is that our major suppliers have these solu-
tions in place now, or will have in the near future.”
Slashing lead times with an Internet-based MRP link. “The procurement in-
formation technology solution we will begin to implement is an Internet-
based material requirement planning data link,” a procurement manager at a
midsized producer of navigation safety and emergency equipment details.
“This will directly transfer all of our MRP system information to our sup-
pliers to support our manufacturing requirements.”
He adds, “The advantage to this practice will be a seamless transfer of in-
formation that is instantaneous.” He believes that the real-time data will give
the suppliers the time they require to deliver parts on time. “From our stand-
point, it will eliminate the time spent generating purchase orders and free our
purchasing professionals to work on value-added tasks,” he assures. “Yearly
contracts and certiﬁcations will be set up to manage the ﬂow of information.”
Using the Internet for kanban replenishment. “We have recently started to
218
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

use the Internet for communicating kanban replenishment orders to key
suppliers,” maintains a business unit manager at a small manufacturer of
pumps. “So far, it is saving us time and is proving to be effective,” she relates.
Expanding use of the Internet for sourcing purposes. A purchasing manager at
a small utility is starting to use the Internet for “solicitation distribution.”
They’ve recently begun to pilot a “few electronic invoicing arrangements.”
To date, she reports, “suppliers are very enthusiastic.”
Building a home-grown system to avoid problems of EDI. A manufacturing
engineer at a large manufacturer of fuel systems for the aerospace industry
explains, “We’re in the process of developing our own electronic commerce
system. We are avoiding the boundaries of EDI and basing our system on
Web tools,” he reports. “Our suppliers just need MSOfﬁce tools and an In-
ternet connection. Data is designed to be highly portable.”
Constructing new data ﬁle of suppliers. “We are building a whole new data
ﬁle on suppliers that identiﬁes cost drivers and details on supplier opera-
tions,” says a manager of coordinated purchases at a major builder of rec-
reational vehicles and engines for water sports. “Some of the suppliers are
cooperating and sharing conﬁdential information. Of course, others are
reluctant to participate.”
Using a cost-based supplier rating system to do double duty. “We have a cost-
based supplier rating system that doubles as a best value determiner on bid
price,” relates the director of technology and quality assurance at a large pro-
ducer of avionics equipment. The software interfaces with the legacy system
to evaluate costs of quality and delivery. It also compares these to the sup-
pliers’ material costs. “Our suppliers are very much involved in this since it
determines their future business with us,” he reports.
Implementing a supplier performance measurement dashboard for all strategic
partners. “We’re currently pursuing EDI and procurement cards and are in
the early stages of researching electronic commerce/Internet-based pro-
curement,” a purchasing and material logistics manager at a midsized pro-
ducer of compact discs reports. “Suppliers are cooperating as continuous im-
provement is the backbone of our strategic partnership program.”
Distributors’ participating in EDI implementation. “We are currently imple-
menting EDI,” declares a purchasing manager at a small assembler of
telecommunications test/monitoring systems. “While all of the electronics
distributors are eagerly participating, we’re having problems getting the
smaller manufacturing companies on board. We’re trying to educate them
and present advantages for them to consider,” she explains. “Some will grow
with us, and the others will eventually be left behind.”

Keeping suppliers in the loop on long-term materials requirements. The general
manager of cost control at a large maker of automotive air compressors re-
lates how his company has developed a repetitive supplier scheduling system
that keeps the supplier base informed of their long-term materials require-
ments. “It has been effective, and the suppliers are quite happy with our new
system,” he says.
Using new technology to eliminate mailed copies of supplier quotes. “We’ve in-
stalled a system that faxes detailed quotations directly into an electronic ﬁle
that is readily available for review,” says a director of purchasing at a large
manufacturer of gears and gear drives. “The system eliminates paper ﬁling
and makes information readily and easily available to all in our organization.
However, at ﬁrst some of the suppliers were reluctant to eliminate mailed
copies of quotes,” he explains.

In a large, decentralized company with many divisions, it is often difﬁcult to
let everyone know about new contract opportunities. The Thomson Cor-
poration, a multibillion dollar, diversiﬁed international corporation with
over 200 companies worldwide and 40,000 employees, is solving this prob-
lem by putting them all on an extranet. 
A team of just eight individuals put in place the value process to lever-
age purchasing opportunities within Thomson’s various business units.
Through the team’s initiatives, over 100 agreements have been negotiated to
date, and almost $300 million in expenditures have been captured under
Thomson-wide agreements. 
Furthermore, $60 million in incremental savings have been realized
since the program’s inception in 1995. More impressive, is that the Thom-
son Optimized Purchasing Services (TOPS) program delivers 35 times its
cost in savings. However, Karen M. Fedele, CPM and director of global
contracts (karen.fedele@tfn.com), declares, “We have just scratched the sur-
face, as there still exists $1.6 billion in leverage spending out there.”
Changing the Decentralization Culture
Thomson has grown primarily through acquisition, which in turn has fostered
a high degree of decentralization throughout the organizations. “Due to the
220
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

decentralization, the companies don’t typically work or talk with each other,”
Fedele states, explaining a situation that is familiar to many readers. “They didn’t
work together to form single agreements with common suppliers. Where we
did have contracts, they were often multiple contracts with a single supplier.”
“We were spending a lot of money but not getting a lot in return,” says
Fedele, who copresented with Ray Mazzoleni, CPM and contracts manager
(ray.mazzoleni@tfn.com), at a recent NAPM Electronic Commerce Con-
ference. “At Thomson, the internal customer, the company, and the supplier
weren’t being managed, so we were losing a lot of leverage.”
Beginning the Leverage Process
Several years ago, Thomson’s top management recognized this situation and
formed a team. The mission: “Work with Thomson business units to select
the suppliers to maximize quality and service levels while minimizing cost.” 
As Fedele explains, “We are committed to the cost of ownership, so we
don’t sacriﬁce service and/or quality for cost. Our approach is to work with
and cooperate with the businesses, get their buy-in, and to team with them
to identify leveraging opportunities.”
TOPS Team Focuses Only on the Strategic
“Our biggest problem at the outset was to have the companies understand
and utilize the agreements effectively,” Fedele maintains. “We’re a strategic
group, and not transactional. We don’t take any requisitions and don’t place
any. What we do is give the individual companies the tools to make their
own purchasing decisions.”
The principal activities of the TOPS initiative are to
1. Identify contract opportunities. The criteria includes volume/savings po-
tential, key/strategic suppliers, geographical coverage, ability to provide
beneﬁt to the majority of Thomson companies, and the supplier’s under-
standing of Thomson. The sources for these are internal customer sugges-
tions and constant reviews of existing agreements to determine whether
they satisfy the established criteria.
2. Negotiate and manage agreements.
3. Market agreements secured by TOPS and other Thomson businesses. This
is done through the TOPS intranet site and the TOPS Information Ex-
change newsletter.
Software and Technology
221

4. Determine reporting requirements.
5. Monitor savings, company participation, and customer satisfaction.
6. Benchmark success. “Here, we evaluate and recommend processes,
such as best practices, technology, and administrative cost savings,” Fedele
explains. “Also, for the contracts we are continuously reviewing the dis-
counting/pricing and terms and conditions for improvement.”
Extranet as a Key Technology/Communications Tool
“Before we made a decision, we went out to talk with our customers and
asked them how they wanted to get information,” Fedele noted. “Without
exception, it was ‘give it to me on a browser-based system that’s password
protected.’” 
The approach taken was to create an extranet. “It’s a Web-based solu-
tion that resides within our ﬁrewall but relies on portions of the Internet to
allow people to access the data,” she describes. The site is accessible by
Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer and is password pro-
tected with two levels of security.
Since the companies within Thomson are not located on one network,
this arrangement enables them to overcome the lack of a common commu-
nications platform, whether it be e-mail or browser, she explains.
Content Selection Is Critical
The Web site includes contract summary information and contract abstracts.
It’s a one-page view of whom the agreement is with, what it provides, and
when it is valid, and it includes bullet summary points of what the agree-
ment is about.
The site also contains pricing information, which is provided by the
suppliers, and contract bulletins, which include product announcements and
other information relative to the market and business. Also, every publica-
tion that TOPS sends out is included at the site.
“We also actively promote the discussion forum,” she offers. “We’re
breaking cultural barriers here as we promote Thomson people talking to
each other and to share information, experience and expertise.”
They’ve just added a purchasing contacts directory. “It’s a Who’s Who
in our company of who handles what,” she notes. “It’s another way of
matching the customer to the supplier and to foster more one-on-one rela-
222
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

tionships. In this way, the supplier can go to just one source rather than
many.”
Closer Ties, Better Management
“The Web enables us to provide consistent information to all parties” she
explains. “Our information is provided to both our supplier organizations
and to the Thomson companies, as well.” 
Also, with the Web, the supplier/customer information is better man-
aged. For instance, all Thomson employees can look at the data and verify
the supplier information. “Importantly, we’ve been able to develop a pur-
chasing community within Thomson,” concludes Fedele.

Why the “sudden” interest in Internet purchasing? “It’s the desire to move
the balance of power in the buying relationship to the purchasing profes-
sional’s side of the table,” declares Bruce D. Temkin, CPIM and senior anal-
yst at Forrester Research, Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.; btemkin@forrester.
com). That is the impetus driving the pilot projects by a handful of pioneer-
ing purchasing professionals. It is also the reason why scores of others are
making serious inquiries about this new technology.
E-Purchasing Builds Momentum
Responding to a Supplier Selection and Management Report survey, the global
supply manager for MRO at a large producer of rubber products shares, “We
are now studying e-commerce beyond faxing and P-cards. We’re looking
into ordering on the Internet from our key suppliers.”
In addition, the interest is not conﬁned only to larger organizations. For
instance, a business unit manager at a midsized manufacturer of pumps ex-
plains, “We already have started to use the Internet for communicating kan-
ban replenishment orders to key suppliers. It saves us time and is very effec-
tive, even in the early stage of implementation,” she adds.
Meanwhile, Merck & Company (Rahway, N.J.) will move its supplies
procurement activity to the Internet this quarter. The company plans to de-
ploy the ORMS from Ariba Technologies (Sunnyvale, Calif.) for the online

procurement of nonproduction or indirect supplies. In addition, General
Electric is developing a process to “apply a sophisticated electronic tech-
nique to purchase indirect and MRO materials” (see sidebar).
Benefits for Purchasing Professionals
Keynoting a recent NAPM Electronic Commerce conference, Tempkin
lists the following beneﬁts:
• Lower costs. “The companies we surveyed expect that by tracking to-
tal demand they will be able to ﬁnd and terminate noncompetitive suppli-

General Electric’s Quest for Electronic Online Indirect and
MRO Purchases
GE is developing a process called Integrated Indirect Supply (IIS) to apply so-
phisticated electronic commerce techniques (Trading Process Network, TPN
Register Company, Rockville, Md.; 888-287-9876) to the purchase of indi-
rect and MRO materials, according to William G. Caﬁero of GE Informa-
tion Services (Dallas; bill.caﬁero@geis.ge.com) and Randolph M. Rowe of GE
Corporate Initiatives Group (Fairﬁeld, Conn.; randy.rowe@corporate.ge.com).
The initiative will incorporate a company-wide intranet, an extranet for sup-
plier communication, integrated use of purchasing cards (with line item de-
tail), and complete “back-ofﬁce” EDI transaction usage.
GE’s six sigma sourcing process. “In the new indirect sourcing process, we
have developed a process for managing the supply chain,” Caﬁero and Rowe
said at a recent NAPM Annual International Purchasing Conference. To start,
they are empowering end users to access the TPN to order products or ser-
vices from online supplier catalogs. 
If an item cannot be found in the catalog, an off-catalog requisition pro-
cess can be used. Also, products or services can be submitted out for bid via
the TPN Post module.
Based on the user proﬁle and deﬁned business rules, the system controls
the process ﬂow, routing, and approval requirements. The system also is inte-
grated with a standard e-mail system to permit easy notiﬁcation of activity.
Once approved, all orders are processed via EDI to suppliers.
“By implementing this program, we see two areas of beneﬁt,” they offer.
First are hard beneﬁts in terms of price leverage and usage/leakage control.
Soft beneﬁts include quality improvements and lower costs of each transac-
tion.

ers, negotiate volume discounts, and eliminate many of the costly human
touches between buyers and sellers,” Tempkin itemizes. For instance, he
cited an example in which a software company spends $142 in total costs to
place an order today. They believe that it will be reduced to just $7 per or-
der when they convert to using the Internet.
• Increased control. “Access to purchasing history will put the buyers in
the driver’s seat,” Temkin maintains. “Purchasing departments can monitor
end-trends, while CFOs analyze how budget dollars are spent.” Purchasing
professionals can apply complex business rules, down to employee ID lev-
els, to manage by exception.
• Better services. Buyers also can use purchase data to force better terms
and responsiveness from existing suppliers. Tempkin contends, “Smart sup-
pliers will have detailed supply and demand information in their databases to
analyze prior behavior to offer targeted services, JIT [ just-in-time] delivery,
and customized prices to satisfy the purchasing professional’s needs.”
Obstacles Impede Total Acceptance
“While companies have great expectations, purchasing professionals still see
some obstacles to widespread usage,” Temkin notes. The largest, by far, is
overcoming resistance to internal culture change. “Internet purchasing does
place a broad impact throughout the organization,” he mentions. “While
companies are starting Internet purchasing initiatives, many of them are not
typically prepared for the changes that are required.” Additionally, he
charges, “Suppliers are not ready to support all of the purchasing initiatives
of their customers. Even the ones with Internet commerce capability are not
necessarily ready to commit to every different procurement initiative,” he
declares.
Meaning for Purchasing Managers
“The Internet is about buyer power,” Temkin repeats for emphasis. “We be-
lieve that the Internet economy will favor the savvy purchasing depart-
ments.”
Forrester research ﬁnds that 30% of purchasing managers have taken the
most forward-looking approach to buying consumables. “In these vanguard
organizations, the purchasing managers view their roles as strategic, not tac-
tical,” he offers. “Think about that shift and what it could mean to your or-
ganization, moving from 70% transactional to 90% strategic.”

First is the purchasing process. In the Internet procurement world, very
little paper, if any, is created. 
Second is supplier management. Although this has always been part of
purchasing, there are some additional requirements and initiatives—for in-
stance, from analyzing the performance of the supplier’ online activity to
how to handle the management of catalog content. This is critically impor-
tant to the initiative, Temkin asserts. He insists that purchasing managers
clearly determine who owns the catalog, who maintains it, how it is main-
tained, and where it resides.
The third area is the end user. This is deﬁnitely a new role because In-
ternet procurement means expanding the number of people who can now
have purchasing authority. “You will need to become an evangelist to get
widespread adoption of this new Internet online purchasing process across
the company,” he declares. “It’s up to you to make sure the features of the
software solution you choose, processes you have, and the support you offer
is as easy as it can be, and as straightforward as it can be to satisfy the users’
needs on an ongoing basis.” Otherwise, they will “gravitate to the easiest
way to do it, even meaning rogue buying,” he warns.

Efﬁcient Internet order fulﬁllment is essential for getting a competitive ad-
vantage, boosting sales revenue, and gaining and maintaining customers. To
help advance your own processes, we offer the following guidelines for
carrying out a successful fulﬁllment strategy, based on the results from two
recent industry surveys: B2C Internet Practices from Deloitte and Touche
(www.deloittetouche.com) and an ongoing e-business study from Hackett
Benchmarking & Research, the research arm of AnswerThink (Hudson,
Ohio; 330-656-3110; www.answerthink.com).
Six Ways to Fix Fulfillment Failures
1. Dedicated Facilities
Picking eaches versus full cartons or case packs is a challenge for many ﬁrms
that are used to shipping full truckloads. This could be the reason why the
industry averages a 3.55-day turnaround from order to shipment for Web-
based order fulﬁllment. In short, this is a good reason to consider dedicated
226
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

e-fulﬁllment DCs. They can be designed as a pick-and-pack, product-zoned
layout for selecting and shipping smaller-sized orders. Currently, 11% of
companies pick and pack Web orders from separate e-business facilities,
while most ﬁrms continue to use traditional facilities or retail stores for ﬁll-
ing orders (see Table I-6.1).
Outsourcing Web fulﬁllment has become an alternative for some (18%)
both for domestic and international order fulﬁllment (see Table I-6.2).
However, third-party DCs are a more popular alternative for supplier and
manufacturer organizations than for retailers.
2. Software Integration
No matter what type of DC you choose, the facility must have its systems
integrated with others in the fulﬁllment process. “Poor systems integration
stiﬂes the ﬂow of information in any enterprise, and fulﬁllment suffers the
most because it’s the point of integration for almost everything that hap-
pens,” says Richard T. Roth, managing director for Hackett. “It’s this failure
to integrate that is keeping products from customers who have expectations
now heightened by the speed of the Internet.”
Of the companies surveyed by Hackett, 40% have yet to integrate their
supply chain systems with their e-business systems, limiting functional ef-
fectiveness and hampering information exchange between managers. 
3. Information Sharing
Systems integration leads to information sharing. The amount and depth of
information that representatives can access determines the level of service
that they can give. Most companies provide their call center representatives

with data about inventory, order/shipment tracking, the individual cus-
tomer, and customer purchase history. Nonetheless, this same information is
not readily shared with e-mail representatives, and this oversight is bound to
result in competitive weaknesses.
Those that have achieved integration (18%) see a tight relationship be-
tween the ﬁnance, distribution, transportation, customer relationship man-
agement, marketing, and inventory management departments. They are
thus experiencing more accurate forecasting and inventory planning.
4. Streamlined Order Processing
Information sharing also streamlines order processing. Even though this im-
proves customer satisfaction, only half of the ﬁrms have integrated Web or-
ders into order processing and fulﬁllment systems. The rest manually enter
orders into distribution/fulﬁllment, order processing/fulﬁllment, or mer-
chandising systems (see Table I-6.3).
5. Shipping Strategies
Part of streamlining orders is delivering them in the most efﬁcient manner.
The majority of companies in the Hackett study say that they recognize that
their distribution strategies must change as e-business heightens customer ex-
pectations. However, 73% have not changed their traditional shipping meth-
ods, and most require more than three days to complete product fulﬁllment.
“Successful companies will facilitate the shipping of individual orders,
track those shipments, and ensure accurate and timely delivery,” says Bill
Blumberg, national director of consumer business for Deloitte and Touche.

6. Full-Time Leadership
Of course, none of the above can occur without strong leadership and a be-
lief in the project. Not convinced that the Internet will affect their business,
many ﬁrms have organized their e-business efforts halfheartedly. Half (48%)
of respondents to the Deloitte survey have an e-business leader, but few
(13%) are full-time. The mean amount of time that e-business leaders de-
vote to e-business is 21%—only one day a week.
Generally, these leaders hold other positions: 32% are from senior man-
agement, and 23% hold vice president titles. Smaller companies (less than
$25 million) usually task senior management with e-business. As companies
grow in revenue, e-business leaders fall into the realm of directors and man-
agers. Among companies with revenues of $101 million to $500 million,
41% of e-business leaders are directors (24%) or managers (17%). Among
ﬁrms over $1 billion, e-business responsibility belongs to senior manage-
ment (24%), vice presidents (19%), directors (33%), and managers (14%).
In addition, one quarter of respondents have one or fewer full-time e-
business staff members; only 7% have ﬁve or more. Among larger compa-
nies, 35% ﬁeld teams of ﬁve or more, and ﬁrms below $1 billion dedicate
one or no full-time resources.

With customers looking for reassurance that delayed e-commerce fulﬁll-
ment is a thing of the past, many e-logistics providers are striving to ﬁll an
unmet demand for effective back-end outsourcing services.
“There is an exploding opportunity in both the B2C [business-to-
consumer] and B2B [business-to-business] e-commerce logistics spaces,”
says Ting Piper, senior analyst with International Data Corp (IDC; Fram-
ingham, Mass.; 508-872-8200). “On the B2C side, you have players ramp-
ing up to provide one-stop-shop solutions, as well as niche players address-
ing individual logistics components, including shipping, order processing,
fulﬁllment, and returns management. Meanwhile, on the B2B side, logistics
is heating up as well. Here, the prospect of reducing costs and enhancing uti-
lization in a collaborative, information-based environment is creating an
e-logistics opportunity that is about to explode.”
Succeeding in e-commerce requires mastering both the front and the
back end of selling products online. But because the back-end process is a
Software and Technology
229

more complex operation, involving inventory management, system integra-
tion, order fulﬁllment, billing and business reporting, mastering it poses the
bigger challenge to most dot-com ﬁrms. Supporting this is recent industry
research that states that back-end logistics functions are now a huge barrier
to gaining and keeping online customers. 
Help is now on the way, however. A growing market of e-business
third-party providers can manage the entire back-end process for you, free-
ing you up to concentrate on customer relationships (see sidebar).
Outsourcing with the Customer in Mind
“Many dot-coms will very soon realize that building a cyber business in-
volves much more than spending millions of dollars on marketing and ad-
vertising,” says Piper. “In a world of at-home delivery, the logistics industry
is what makes e-commerce possible.”
In the case of Egghead.com, a provider of computer and related prod-
ucts, e-logistics solution provider Electron Economy (Cupertino, Calif.;
408-873-3270) will audit the entire transportation management network.
Prior to working with Electron Economy, Egghead.com used a manual
process to match invoices to shipments in order to ensure that service-level
agreements were being met and to determine real freight costs.
“We can now audit freight and transportation costs and measure deliv-
ery service effectiveness to ensure that we are using the most effective and

E-Logistics Services Emerge
USFreightways Corp. (Chicago, Ill.; 773-824-1000) decided to seize the op-
portunity by launching a business unit dedicated to online retailers that man-
age warehousing, distribution, and delivery of merchandise to consumers.
PFSweb, Inc. (Plano, Texas; 888-330-5504), offers e-logistics services to
e-tailers such as American Eagle Outﬁtters, Hewlett-Packard, and Daisytek
International. 
Electron Economy, Escalate, Inc. (Redwood Shores, Calif.; 650-769-
9300), Ingram-Micro (Santa Ana, Calif.; 714-382-2692), and Fingerhut Bus-
iness Services, Inc. (Minnetonka, Minn.; 612-932-3529), sell themselves as
one-stop-shop solutions for companies that want their orders managed from

efﬁcient distribution network possible,” says Norman Hullinger, senior vice
president of sales and operations for Egghead.com.
San Francisco–based Basement.com is an online shopping mall whose
vendors continually lower the prices of their goods and services. This com-
plicates e-commerce management, so the company decided to seek an out-
source provider that could monitor operations and continually achieve op-
timal efﬁciency, explains Steven Lee, CEO of Basement.com. “We now get
a real-time window into the supply chain, enabling proactive customer and
vendor communications.”
HardCloud, an online retailer of sports and adventure products in Palo
Alto, California, decided that a third-party logistics (3PL) provider could
better manage the e-commerce operations challenge of setting new online
retail standards for customer service and fulﬁllment. 
“Our audience demands a high-impact, energy-driven experience
when visiting our site and has little patience for nonintuitive site navigation,”
says Robert Balmaseda, vice president of production and community at
HardCloud. “We relied on our outsource provider to mask the logistical
complexity under the surface so that we can focus on getting our site up and
running quickly while maximizing service.”
Finally, Los Angeles–based style365.com, an integrated site with a di-
rectory of stylish names, products, and services, must ﬁlter through volumes
of online information to offer consumers the time-pressed data for which
they are looking. At the same time, upscale goods often have special re-
quirements associated with warehousing, fulﬁllment, shipping, and delivery.
The retailer chose to outsource its operations infrastructure, allowing the
company to focus on “building strong relationships with customers,” says
Kathy Prost, chief merchandising ofﬁcer.
“To compete and win in the Internet economy, online retailers need a
robust logistics infrastructure in order to deliver an easy and enjoyable pur-
chase experience for their customers,” adds Vincent Gulisano, executive
vice president of Electron Economy.
What You Can Outsource
The potential to strengthen customer relationships is the primary reason that
the current e-logistics outsourcing market is growing. Research from
Northeastern University (Boston; 617-373-4813) and Benchmarking Part-
ners (Cambridge, Mass.; 617-679-7687) shows that the use of 3PLs for elec-
tronic commerce is expected to increase signiﬁcantly in the next few years.
Software and Technology
231

Logistics managers were asked if their company was currently involved
in e-commerce and how important 3PL providers would be in supporting
their e-commerce strategies. Although 50% said that 3PLs are currently im-
portant or very important in supporting those strategies, that percentage
will increase to 80% next year (see Table I-6.4). At the same time, the per-
centage of users who classiﬁed 3PLs as minimally important or unimpor-
tant in supporting EC strategies has been expected to decline from 50% to
20%.
Similar research from IDC shows that retailers are interested in out-
sourcing several logistics areas, including order management, fulﬁllment,
and delivery activities. IDC found that 81% of respondents manage orders
in-house. However, dot-coms are more willing to outsource order manage-
ment—33% said that they currently do so. However, return management
and fulﬁllment are likely to take off at a faster speed than are order manage-
ment and delivery services.
Customizing Outsourced Logistics
No matter what you want to outsource, third-party providers can customize
their solutions to ﬁt your speciﬁc logistics requirements. “We listened to our
customers and created a service offering from which they can easily pick and
choose,” says Michael Terrell, senior vice president of the new IM-Logistics
division at Ingram-Micro, an e-logistics outsource provider in Santa Ana,
California (714-382-2692). “Speed, quality, and scalability are paramount to
our daily operation, and our customers can take advantage of this infrastruc-
ture to improve their business operations in the critical area of logistics, es-
pecially for e-business.”
Providers develop a customized solution through a detailed analysis of
your business, which can include

1. Needs assessment and design. The 3PL will analyze your business needs
and review current business practices and goals. An operations management
strategy is put together based on the number of stock keeping units (SKUs)
you ship, your product offering, customer relationship practices, the way in
which you want to handle back orders, and other relevant business practices.
2. Logistics partners. A 3PL will select business partners that ﬁt your busi-
ness from warehousing to customer service.
3. Integration and implementation. Electron Economy coordinates the de-
sign and build of the logical warehouse and connects it to the physical ware-
house, integrates it to other logistics partners’ systems and to the customer
service call center, and connects it with any operations you plan to maintain
in-house.
4. Client operations. Once the system has gone live, a client operations
team will take over the e-commerce operations. This includes interacting
with logistics partners.

The costs of conventional procurement processes can average $50 to $250
per transaction, but these costs can be reduced to the range of $5 to $20 us-
ing Web-based procurement solutions. These solutions automate routine
purchases, direct purchases to preferred suppliers, and create worldwide sup-
plier trading communities. 
Here are six of the most important features that logistics managers
should look for in a Web-based procurement solution.
1. Give the customers a voice. When considering how to do business on-
line, companies need to address the amount of power that customers should
have in the decision-making process. When asked how important the cus-
tomer is in Web-based procurement, nearly half of the respondents to a sur-
vey from Zona Research (Redwood City, Calif.; 650-298-4000) considered
them somewhat or extremely important (see Table I-6.5). Almost 28% were
fence sitters who considered it neither important nor unimportant, and
about one quarter said it was somewhat or extremely unimportant.
Typically, smaller ﬁrms tend to be better tuned to the needs of the cus-
tomer, partly as a matter of survival. Because small ﬁrms may have difﬁculty

matching the lower prices that their larger counterparts can offer, they can
differentiate themselves by offering customer-deﬁned purchasing. Giving
the customer a voice can prevent their migration to competitors.
2. Support online catalogs. To keep current inventory levels, managers are
seeking procurement solutions that support online dynamic catalogs. Solu-

tions that can be automatically updated will eliminate the customer’s going
to the competitor because of an out-of-stock situation. According to the
Zona survey, 45% felt that it was somewhat or extremely important for so-
lutions to support dynamic catalogs.
3. Tailor solutions to industry needs. Company- or industry-speciﬁc solu-
tions are a prime element of effective Web-based procurement. When asked
if Web procurement solutions should be tailored for speciﬁc industry or ver-
tical needs, 57% said that the feature was somewhat or extremely important,
whereas over 20% considered it to be somewhat or extremely unimportant.
The remaining 23% believed that such features were neither unimportant
nor important. 
Lack of support for industry-tailored solutions came predominantly
from companies with more than 1,000 employees. Because many large en-
terprises, such as those in manufacturing, procure bulk materials via pre-
arranged contracts with preferred suppliers, they may ﬁnd that the options
facilitated by tailored solutions are of little beneﬁt. On the other hand, small
businesses with limited resources seek the best possible ways to reduce costs
and locate the vendors that are best suited to meet their needs. In this case,
they would ﬁnd the range of supplier and product options offered by tailored
procurement solutions to be a perfect match for their needs.
4. Increase speed of order cycles. The shortening of order cycles was more
important for Web-based procurement than were whatever savings that
might be achieved. The reason was that timing of order cycles is often part
of a complete maze of project management delay times that can determine
whether the product is delivered on time.
As such, half the respondents thought that speeding cycle times was es-
sential to Web-based procurement. Another 47% need a bit more convinc-
ing, in that they either somewhat agree or neither agree nor disagree. Only
6% of the respondents disagreed with the fact. This subset, researchers be-
lieve, represents a combination of those whose procurement process is rela-
tively simple.
5. Use suppliers more efﬁciently. Probably the most revolutionary element
of Internet business processes is the ability to link organizations with their
partners and customers effectively, regardless of their locations or schedules.
Thus it is not surprising that when managers were asked if they thought
Web-based procurement permits more efﬁcient use of preferred or best sup-
pliers, 60% agreed completely or somewhat. One in four neither agreed nor
disagreed, and only a combined 14% disagreed somewhat or completely.

6. Establish the right price. More than four out of 10 respondents said that
they somewhat or completely agreed that price is the most important crite-
ria they consider when making a decision about their Web procurement so-
lution. One in four believe that product features and length of contract with
the vendor are more important than price. Respondents indicate that they
need some handholding during the purchasing process and rely on the solu-
tion provider to tailor systems and point out what the buyer really needs.

Logistics managers who focus ERP return on investment (ROI) measures
solely on cost reductions may miss the forest for the trees. It is as productive,
if not more so, to assess the process improvements that result from the ERP
and instill the need for ongoing performance improvement at all levels. To
broaden the way you measure success of your ERP solution, we suggest that
logistics managers heed the following points identiﬁed by AMR Research,
Inc. (Boston; 617-542-6600), before embarking on an ERP implementation.
1. Realize that process improvement can reduce costs and create competitive ad-
vantage. Effective processes should always be the goal, and the most impor-
tant processes are those that touch the customer. Some goals that managers
identify for process improvement are to reduce transactions and eliminate
non-value-added steps, to shift transaction costs through supplier and cus-

tomer self-service functions, to improve asset utilization through reduced
cycle times, and to assign process owners and organizational responsibilities.
One company reports a 300% ROI in the ﬁrst 12 months after start-up, at-
tributing its success to a focus on on-time delivery and replenishment.
2. Remember that performance improvement ensures focus and efﬁciency. To
show the value of the ERP implementation, managers must demonstrate
ongoing progress in critical performance measures to gain and maintain sen-
ior-level support. Create performance metrics that measure the customer’s
perceived beneﬁt or expectation. Order fulﬁllment and customer response
time are two examples of good performance measures.
3. Recognize that ERP payback is not all about money. Many consider the
payback of the full ERP implementation to be realized through cost savings,
but the real payback comes through improved corporate productivity that
supports increased sales, readiness to change, and streamlined processes for a
speed-oriented marketplace.
4. Identify business strategies. Your vertical industry will determine the
business strategy. Strategies can include low-cost production, fast order ful-
ﬁllment, fastest time to market for new products, best customer service,
product performance and reliability, and customized products. An essential
task in business case development for ERP investments is to assess the po-
tential beneﬁt that results from the strategy. Realize also that the beneﬁt de-
rived from the ERP will not occur overnight, so you should not set expec-
tations too high and risk losing executive support for the project.
5. Identify required processes. Break the strategy into processes that enable
the company to improve and succeed. This will help you monitor and mea-
sure the process to a detailed level for easier tracking. Examples include re-
turn on assets at plant and corporate levels; product proﬁtability; sales by per-
son, region, and product; sales by channel; proﬁtability by customer; margin
by product and channel; and incremental sales by customer.
6. Create meaningful KPIs. Managers must collect benchmarking data
and determine which measurements will most closely track the progress of
creating a process advantage. During the information-gathering phase, as-
sess the potential and achievable goals for the process. 
7. Monitor processes. Develop self-monitoring processes as part of the
ERP implementation. While ERP applications are just beginning to address
KPIs at the process level, reporting tools and other capabilities can be applied
to monitor process improvement.

Logistics managers’ needs are being tightly integrated into new product de-
velopment (NPD) projects and various software applications. Why? Because
supply chain considerations have become so critical to the NPD process.
The following sections describe some of the leading NPD programs and the
way in which they are incorporating logistics.
Supply Chain Planning Systems Analyze Designs
One of the difﬁculties in strategic planning of new products consists of an-
alyzing the supply chain implications of design options. Some of the supply
chain planning vendors traditionally known for Advanced Planning and
Scheduling (APS) in the manufacturing supply chain are expanding their ap-
plications into the development phase of a product’s lifecycle, making these
a valuable tool for NPD strategic planning by providing what-if analyses of
proposed designs. They allow visibility across the product lifecycle, includ-
ing visibility into effects on downstream supply chain for distribution, ser-
vice, and end-of-life transitioning of products.
Supply chain planning vendors providing expanded applications include
the following:
• i2 Technologies, Inc. (Irving, Tex.) has added the Product Lifecycle
Management (PLM) module to its Rhythm product suite. PLM allows the
supply chain planning process to begin at the product development stage.
Modules include Requirements Planner, Portfolio Planner, Design Opti-
mizer, Development Scheduler, and Transitional Planner.
• Adexa, Inc.’s (Los Angeles) iCollaboration product manages the
NPD process across the product lifecycle. A Product Design module devel-
ops resource requirements and optimizes the allocation of those resources.
The global Strategic Planner module allows a strategic view of developing
new products. Marketing, sales, development engineering, executive man-
agement, and other departments can view and share the information.
ERP Applications Prove Invaluable for Inventory
ERP applications are also a critical tool for NPD. Their strength in inven-
tory management provides logistics people with the capability to leverage ﬁ-
nancial data about inventory. Some solutions include the following:
238
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

• Oracle (Redwood Shores, Calif.) provides Oracle Projects to help
manage project activities. Reporting capability is available for project costs,
allowing analysis of actual versus budgeted expenditures.
• SAP AG (Walldorf, Germany) has expanded its R/3 Project System
into the NPD arena as part of its PLM application. 
View Products via Portfolio Management
Portfolio management applications provide a view of all products under de-
velopment. They allow managers to assess project status quickly in terms of
risk, resource allocation, schedule, and beneﬁt. Portfolio management ven-
dors include the following:
• Integrated Development Enterprise, Inc.’s (Concord, Mass.) IDweb
deﬁnes the critical information needed from the project teams. Managers
can see resources and allocate resources. The data required to drive the ap-
plication are entered manually.
• XIS, Inc. (San Francisco) developed Novare. Lights indicate the sta-
tus of project schedules.
Track Project Status
Project management applications are ideal for tracking project status and fo-
cus on resource requirements and task and schedule status. Enterprise proj-
ect management applications include the following:
• Primavera Systems Inc.’s (Bala Cynwyd, Pa.) Concentric provides
project planning and cross-project viewing of resources, cost, cash ﬂow, and
earned value.
• Artemis Management Systems’ (Boulder, Colo.) Views provides en-
terprise multiproject analysis and a link to Microsoft Project for more de-
tailed scheduling activities.
• Nemosphere, Inc.’s (Palo Alto, Calif.) Enact Enterprise System is a
Web-based project management application that helps dispersed teams col-
laborate. 
• Framework Technologies Corp.’s (Burlington, Mass.) ActiveProject,
also a Web-based application, provides teams with access to schedules, doc-
uments, and other information. Documents can be marked up with com-
ments to share with team members.
Software and Technology
239

• Vite’s (Palo Alto, Calif.) Vite Project is a desktop application that runs
on Microsoft Windows. It is used for strategic planning rather than for track-
ing project status. The application is used to identify bottlenecks and poten-
tial failures based on the skills of the assigned resources.
Requirements Management Deters Failure
If a project does not meet the initial speciﬁcations deﬁned at the start, it is a
failure. Thus, requirements management software applications should be
used to deﬁne the customer speciﬁcations of the product or service and track
changes throughout the life of the project.
• Quality Systems & Software, Inc. (Mt. Arlington, N.J.) offers Enter-
prise Doors, a Web-based decision-support tool.
• Technology Builders, Inc.’s (Atlanta, Ga.) Caliber RM helps deﬁne
the expectations and goals of a product at conception and in tracking how
well requirements are met throughout the project.
Visibility throughout the Project
Vendors are now providing ERP capability to allow managers to see within
and across projects. 
• ELabor.com, Inc. (Camarillo, Calif.) offers eLabor Project with ex-
panded time and attendance capability. An EP Vision module allows multi-
level viewing across projects to see capacity, cost, performance, revenue pro-
jections, and resource availability.
• PlanView, Inc.’s (Austin, Tex.) PlanView provides project and re-
source management based on the collection of time and labor from project
members.
PLM applications allow the enterprise access to all product-related in-
formation. They handle the conﬁguration of products, storage of product
documents, and bills-of-material and maintain the deﬁnition of the product
at each phase of its life. Vendors include the following:
• MatrixOne, Inc.’s (Chelmsford, Mass.) eMatrix models a variety of
business process ﬂows. It is built on an Oracle database, allowing the appli-
cations to share information easily at the database level.
240
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

• Eigner + Partner AG (Karlsruhe, Germany) takes a project approach
to managing information in its CADIM product. Advance Resource Plan-
ning and Conﬁguration Management modules provide the capability to cal-
culate resource requirements and project length using a spreadsheet format. 
Other applications in this category include Unigraphics Solutions, Inc.’s
(Maryland Heights, Mo.) iMAN, PTC’s (Waltham, Mass.) Windchill, and
Structural Dynamics Research Corp.’s (Milford, Ohio) Metaphase. All have
workﬂow and conﬁguration management functionality that allow the cap-
ture of detailed product data.
Collaborating during Development
Collaboration applications are important for routing information to team
members and for fostering communications during the development pro-
cess. Vendors include the following:
• NexPrise, Inc.’s (Santa Clara, Calif.) ipTeam lets extended project
teams collaborate on development projects. The iTracker module providers
a user-conﬁgurable dashboard to view project performance indicators. Proj-
ect Center provides a central Web portal for accessing all project activities
and to organize team access privileges.

ucts that allow real-time Web-enabled design collaboration.
• Enovia Corp. (Charlotte, N.C.) provides a group of design applica-
tions in its Enovia Portfolio to allow real-time collaboration.
• Lotus Development Corp.’s (Cambridge, Mass.) Notes/Domino re-
cently added messaging and scheduling for collaboration.
• Microsoft’s (Redmond, Wash.) Exchange/Outlook provides a scal-
able messaging platform and basic collaboration.
• Novell, Inc.’s (Provo, Utah) GroupWise has document management
and work-ﬂow capability. It is a good choice for corporations that have stan-
dardized on Novell for their network operating system.
• eRoom Technology, Inc.’s (Cambridge, Mass.) eRoom is a Web-
based product targeted to highly distributed development teams. Real-time
asynchronous discussion is provided.

In a quandary of where to locate that distribution center (DC) or ware-
house? One resource you might want to consult is the Ten Best Warehouse
Networks (see Table I-7.1), which lists ideal locations based on population
statistics. “The networks listed are considered ‘best’ since they represent the
lowest possible average distances in a network,” says Terry Harris, managing
partner at Chicago Consulting, creator of the “10 Best” list. 
For instance, the “recommended” three warehouse network would
have facilities located in Allentown, Pennsylvania; Paducah, Kentucky; and
Fresno, California. According to the data, these sites have the lowest-
possible average distance to the U.S. population: 378 miles.
Free network evaluation for IOMA readers. For years Harris has offered
readers the opportunity to avail themselves of a free evaluation of their net-
works. “An individual company’s warehouse should be designed to be low
cost and to serve their speciﬁc customers, which may be different from the
U.S. population,” he told IOMA.
For your free evaluation, mail your warehouse locations to Harris.
“We’ll compute the service the network provides, contrast it with the ‘10
Best,’ and determine where the next warehouse should be located,” he of-
fers. Additionally, he will explain what additional service you would achieve
with this, and even recommend which warehouse you can eliminate from
the network.

Getting Management to Understand
An important aspect of any program is getting management understanding
and commitment for what you want to accomplish. The management team
needs a shared understanding of the importance of motivation and retention
and how they relate to the way managers treat associates.
WERC suggests the following guidelines to gain management support:
1. Point out discrepancies between current and desired states. Present
data about current turnover rates, productivity levels, morale issues, quality
goals, and so on. Discuss how improving the status quo could positively im-
pact organizational results.
2. Discuss the importance of encouraging and reinforcing behaviors
that support your mission, values, and objectives.
3. Sensitize management to the rationale for change. Put dollar
amounts on the high cost of recruiting and replacing valued associates. Dis-
cuss the advantages of a proactive approach to keeping key contributors.
Gather benchmarking statistics on turnover rates, productivity levels, and
other relevant measures. Compare your organization with others in your in-
dustry, size, geographic area, and so on.
4. Communicate realistic, positive expectations about the results of im-
plementing a proactive motivation and retention program. Cite results from
other organizations that have made a commitment to valuing associations.
Get Associates Involved
Associates are the best source of information about what will motivate or in-
ﬂuence them to stay with a company. How do you ﬁnd out what associates
want? Here are a few common methods of data collection:
• Questionnaires. A speciﬁc set of written items with open-ended or
forced-response questions is distributed. Although questionnaires are rela-
tively easy to quantify and are an inexpensive way to obtain large amounts
of data, they are viewed as a cold approach, and response rates may be low.
• Interviews. An interviewer asks questions of interviewees (alone or in
small groups). Interviews allow you to study a wide range of topics and give
you a better sense of the issues impacting associates. However, interviews can

be expensive and time-consuming, and answers will depend on the skill of
the interviewer.
• Observations. The observer goes on site and watches the work behav-
ior of people on the job. This great way to collect ﬁrsthand information
could reveal unexpected problems. Pros warn, however, that it can be difﬁ-
cult to interpret what is observed.
• Organizational records. The analyst classiﬁes, studies, and interprets the
meanings of numbers in records. Examples include turnover data, absen-
teeism, and ﬁled grievances. Although the numbers tend to be believable
and can identify accurate baselines, it may be difﬁcult to locate the data.
A Variety of Techniques
There are various methods for motivating and retaining employees. Your ﬁ-
nal selection should be based on your ultimate objectives, but you also need
to consider what is important to associates. Realize that once a program is
put into place, it is very difﬁcult to discontinue its use. Thus, it behooves
management to evaluate an incentive or motivational program carefully. 
If management recognizes that a particular program is not achieving its
goals, it may be necessary to reexamine the goals, evaluate the beneﬁts as-
sociated with the program, and analyze the cost/beneﬁt of keeping the
program versus discontinuing it. Also, companies may want to examine
whether they are using some techniques just because they are “easy.” Com-
pany logo merchandise, company newsletters, company service awards, pic-
nics, and birthday recognition are fairly easy to implement and are frequently
used, but they are not rated as highly effective.
Cost may be the common denominator of many techniques. For ex-
ample, incentives such as on-site day care, recreational travel, on-site gym/
recreational centers, and scholarships for associates’ children are relatively
costly options. However, several respondents who provide day care indicate
that it is most effective.
Three Final Bits of Advice
The study suggests that when evaluating current motivation programs, you
should keep in mind three key learnings:
1. It is most effective to use several motivation and retention tech-
niques. Think of the program as a portfolio with a variety of methods to tar-
246
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

get different needs. Be sure to include a combination of spontaneous infor-
mal recognition and rewards, awards for achievements and activities, and
formal reward programs.
2. When implementing the motivation and retention portfolio, involve
associates. Also, make sure you have items that focus on different elements
of the total job situation.
3. When designing techniques, get associate input and feedback. Con-
duct worker surveys to make sure that feelings and opinions are in sync with
management’s.

A recent study from Managing Logistics reveals that one-third of logistics
managers have recently moved or redesigned their facilities or will in the
next year. The reason: Consolidation has dramatically increased logistics sav-
ings. The manager of a beef company in Kansas, for example, says, “We had
two distributors move within ﬁve miles of our site into a combined ware-
house, one for operating and one for repair parts. We worked with them to
hold slow-moving items, be a safer control point, and use a JIT [ just-in-
time] system. The two companies have worked as a true team spawning ideas
to make the system work better each month. Savings this year have been at
least $500,000, with more than $1 million potential for the second year.”
Likewise, the vice president of logistics for a generic over-the-counter
(OTC) company reveals, “We moved from outside leased space to owned
warehouses. Savings have approached $1.5 million for each of the two facil-
ities.”
Indoor Productivity Excels
In addition to ﬁnancial savings, logistics managers have bolstered productiv-
ity since relocating, consolidating, or redesigning sites. “We have increased
productivity by decreasing the amount of walking since reorganizing our
DC,” explains the manager of distribution operations for an Illinois-based
automotive parts company. Another manager who redesigned his layout us-
ing more racks to increase storage and facilitate a high-velocity picking op-
eration has reduced overtime 25% and cut his labor force 15%.
Warehouse Management
247

The vice president of logistics for a construction equipment ﬁrm in
Iowa has seen an increase in the level of productivity not by redesigning his
warehouse but by selecting a new one. “We centralized inventory from mul-
tiple sites and streamlined our picking and packing process. We realized a
20% productivity improvement by implementing a Baan ERP logistics
module, which has improved data collection and timeliness of reporting.”
Location-Seeking Software
Supporting our ﬁndings are the results from a survey that was conducted by
Case Western Reserve University and the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology and analyzed the use of facility location software. These software
programs locate intermediate facilities in the supply chain network: plants,
warehouses, pool points, DCs, and cross docks. 
The models allow tradeoffs between major costs that affect location
(production, warehouse handling and storage, inventory carrying, and
transportation) when seeking the proper facility number, location, and size.
Restrictions on facility throughput and customer service are also considered.
The software may ﬁnd locations within the accuracy of a three-digit zip
code.
Logistics Pros Describe Model Usage
Eight out of 10 respondents reported that they would conduct an analysis of
the ﬁrm’s warehousing system or distribution network during the next year.
Five percent say that they have already done so. When asked if a computer-
ized model would be used to conduct the analysis 73% said yes. Among
those who would not be using a model, a few added that their system was
“too simple” to beneﬁt from a computerized analysis.
The surveyors also asked respondents to identify the model that they
use: 20% are proprietary models, such as from a consulting ﬁrm; 18% are us-
ing internally developed models; 52% are using third-party models; and 10%
are still searching for a model.
The Best and Worst of Them
Logistics pros were also asked to describe what they consider to be the best
and worst features of the software models that they use (see Figures I-7.1 and
I-7.2 and Table I-7.3). Flexibility, which generally reﬂected the model’s abil-

Even though hundreds of logistics managers will purchase a WMS this year,
the power of these systems to reduce errors, increase space utilization, and
decrease labor costs will more often than not be offset by lack of a strategic
plan. Following is a guideline to help you put together such a plan and ulti-
mately select a WMS solution that will meet your logistics goals. 
Step 1. Establish a project team; plan objectives and priorities. Though seem-
ingly obvious, the importance of a cross-functional project team cannot be
stressed enough. The team should consist of both warehouse information
systems personnel and accounting personnel. The team may also consider
bringing in an outside consulting resource if necessary. The team should be
limited to around ﬁve members who will establish the objectives and prior-
ities of the warehouse strategic plan. The team will quantify these objectives
and priorities to guide ﬁnal selection. Finally, the team will obtain a consen-
sus on the objectives, priorities, and evaluation criteria.
Step 2. Establish a database. You will need the following data:
• Planning horizon (5 years)
• Growth (sales and product)
• Receiving and shipping requirements
• Storage and throughput requirements
• Control system requirements
• Operating procedures
• Present warehouse layout
• Material ﬂow volumes
• Unit load deﬁnitions
• Present operating cost
Warehouse Management
251

• Economic evaluation criteria and factors
• Present storage, picking, and packaging procedures
• Order proﬁles
• Activity-based costing (ABC) analysis (velocity movement of prod-
uct by number of times picked)
Step 3. Identify and document alternative warehouse strategic plans. After the
database is established, you should consider material handling, storage, and
control systems. The methods of receiving, storing, picking, packaging, and
shipping, along with the quantity of stock keeping units (SKUs) in all loca-
tions, should be questioned. Creativity, innovation, and practicality should
be pursued when making your plan. Various operating and material handling
systems, as well as storage/handling systems, should also be considered.
Step 4. Evaluate alternative warehouse strategic plans. Deﬁne the investment,
installation, and operating costs for each alternative plan. Perform an after-tax
economic analysis of each alternative plan. Select the best warehouse strate-
gic plan based on the overall economic and qualitative evaluations. Qualita-
tive factors are ﬂexibility, expandability, safety, security, integration, and ease
of implementation. The project team should determine these factors.
Step 5. Specify the plan. The warehouse strategic plan must clearly illus-
trate the material handling systems, storage systems, and control systems.
This step should result in a detailed document that will be helpful if the team
is required to present their recommendations to senior management. The
document will detail the four previous steps.
Step 6. Establish a bidder’s list. Contact the appropriate equipment and
system vendors and establish a qualiﬁed list of three to ﬁve vendors for each.
Step 7. Develop and release equipment and system functional speciﬁcations. An
equipment and system functional speciﬁcation is a document that clearly and
logically deﬁnes the required functionality and bid requirements for the
equipment and systems. The document ensures that all vendors provide an
equal level of functionality for the quoted price. The company or its repre-
sentative prepares the document and then sends it to the appropriate ven-
dors. The vendors then respond with a proposal that addresses all areas of the
document. Documents can range in size from 10 to 80 pages, depending on
the complexity of the required equipment or systems.
252
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

Be sure to provide functional equipment and system speciﬁcations with
information including the following:
General requirements
• Company description
• Quantity
• Dimensions
• System overview
• Features and options
Operational requirements
• Performance
• Capacities
• Throughput
Deﬁnition of functional areas of the warehouse
• Receiving
• Putaway, storage, and replenishment
• Order initiation and picking
• Shipping
• Miscellaneous functions (returns, cycle counting)
Integration and interface requirements
• Communication protocols
• Mainframe interface requirements

• Reports and inquiries
• List of hardware and software
• System development and implementation requirements
• System performance

• General instructions to bidders
• Terms and conditions
• Pricing format
• Schedule requirements
Step 8. Vendor interaction. The team will provide input to vendors during
the bid process. The vendors should be allowed four to six weeks to com-
plete the bid process. Items include the following:
• Respond to questions during the bid process
• Receive bids
Step 9. Coordinate site visits. The team will establish dates for vendor site
visits and document the requirements of equipment and system demonstra-
tions.
Step 10. Evaluate and select vendors. The team will perform an analysis of
the equipment and system bids.
Step 11. Finalize layout. Redesign the conceptual layout based on se-
lected vendors’ feedback. Lay out the facility to maximize storage and min-
imize congestion. Show details and dimensions on layout for items such as
staging lanes, aisles, section views of storage equipment, forklift mainte-
nance areas, and lighting requirements.
After the above 11 steps are completed, the team is now ready to con-
sider implementation and execution. For more information, contact Tomp-
kins Associates, Inc., at 919-876-3667.

Although the concept of customized warehousing—storing generic prod-
uct in the warehouse until receipt of a customer demand—is not new, the
logistics community has been slow in adopting this practice. This is possibly
due to a lack of understanding in its implementation or because logistics
managers are still skeptical of its merits, the basics of which appear in a spe-
cial report by the WERC (630-990-0001), Enhancing the Warehouse’s Role
Through Customization.

Shift from Production to Warehousing
Customized warehousing blurs the line of responsibility between manufac-
turing and warehousing. Tasks that the factory completes will be moved to
the warehouse, resulting in signiﬁcant changes in four areas:
1. Facilities. Due to manufacturing’s producing generic product, there
will be a simpliﬁcation of manufacturing and a reduction in the amount of
space required for ﬁnished goods. At the same time, the warehouse will need
more space for customization. This may include storage space for labeling,
wrapping, packaging, and manufacturing supplies; working space for staging,
palletizing, kitting, painting, plating, pricing, packaging, and assembling; and
ﬂexible space for continuous evolution of customized warehousing.
2. Equipment. As a result of changing storage requirements and the ad-
dition of some manufacturing functions to the warehouse, new equipment
will be required for customized warehousing. Depending on the cus-
tomization to be provided by the warehouse, the equipment must be as ﬂex-
ible as necessary.
3. Technology. To handle the demands of customization, the warehouse
must have a real-time, bar code–based, radio frequency (RF) communica-
tion WMS. In addition to the typical WMS functionality, the customized
WMS must have the functionality to kit materials required for customiza-
tion, to schedule production tasks through a bill of material processor, and
to track work in progress.
4. Labor. Depending on the speciﬁc customized warehousing design,
more labor may be required, and in some cases, less labor. Nevertheless, it is
clear that enhanced skill sets and levels of ﬂexibility will be required. Some
production workers may be transferred to the warehouse to perform the
tasks that have shifted from production to the warehouse.
Pursuing Customization
Successful customized warehousing applications should be based on a Cus-
tomized Warehousing Strategic Master Plan. Following are the seven steps
in developing such a plan:
1. Understand the current status of customization and customized warehousing.
As a baseline to the Master Plan process, the following questions should be
addressed:
Warehouse Management
2 5 5
TEAMFLY
Team-Fly® 

• What breadth of SKUs is presently being offered?
• What additional breadth of SKUs have your customers requested?
• What additional breadth of SKUs is marketing requesting or consid-
ering?
• What customization is presently done in the warehouse?
2. Establish objectives, priorities, and evaluation criteria. Interact with com-
pany leadership to establish the short-term, midterm, and long-term objec-
tives of customized warehousing. Understand the organization’s priorities
with respect to customer service, competitive threats, weaknesses, strengths
and opportunities, inventory reduction, capacity constraints, and other fac-
tors that may impact the strategic direction of customized warehousing. At
the same time, understand the evaluation criteria to be used in analyzing al-
ternative levels and approaches to customized warehousing (see step 4).
3. Establish a database. Obtain the following operation information:
• Market forecast for overall business and SKU growth
• Twelve-month production schedule
• Twelve months of orders to determine order proﬁle and ABC anal-
ysis
• Identify product characteristics (unit load deﬁnitions)
• Current facility layout, site plan, and restrictions
• Current operating costs
• Economic evaluation criteria and factors
• Current storage, picking, and packaging procedures
• Monthly view of inventory levels by product for one year
• Level of computerization utilized in the warehouse
4. Identify and document alternative customized warehousing strategies. Using
the data that have been gathered, determine what is common among the
various product offerings. Then, analyze the production process to deter-
mine at what point customized warehousing would be most beneﬁcial and
least disruptive. 
Investigate alternative customization approaches, including the devel-
opment of requirements for equipment, materials, labor, systems, and capi-
tal dollars. With each alternative, review the customization process to de-
termine the cycle time, and then compare it to the current order lead time. 
Based on this analysis, determine the correct mix of generic product to
256
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

ﬁnished goods inventory. Once the mix is determined, project the appro-
priate levels of inventory. Based on these projections, develop alternative
storage conﬁgurations and deﬁne space, equipment, and personnel projec-
tions for each alternative.
5. Evaluate alternative control system strategies. Evaluate the alternative
WMS strategies available that meet the customized warehouse’s overall
functionality. Ensure that the WMS can incorporate a production schedul-
ing function. It is critical that a bill of materials is established. Determine the
costs of pursuing with the existing WMS or buying and interfacing to an-
other solution.
6. Evaluate alternative Customized Warehousing Strategic Master Plans. De-
ﬁne the investment, installation, and operating costs for each alternative
plan. Perform an after-tax economic analysis and a qualitative analysis of
each. Select the best Master Plan based on the overall economic and quali-
tative evaluations.
7. Develop an action plan. The selected Master Plan must be translated
into a ﬁrm action plan. The action plan must be time-phased and clearly il-
lustrate the material handling systems, storage systems, production and pack-
aging systems, and material control systems for the recommended Master
Plan.
Making It Work
James A. Tompkins, who wrote the WERC Special Report, points out how
various manufacturers have made customized warehousing work for them.
The case of SureLock, Inc., a small appliance manufacturer, is particularly
interesting. This manufacturer has experienced steady growth of 15% per
year, which has impacted operations in several ways:
• SKU proliferation. An original 17 designs exploded to 75, and each has
a variety of models, which have also increased. There are now over 700 dif-
ferent SKUs.
• Scheduling/productivity/capacity. The manufacturing operation, de-
signed to accommodate up to 20 designs, has exceeded capacity. In addition,
the production line was designed to produce large batch runs of a single de-
sign. Low-volume and high variability are the new requirements, resulting
in numerous short runs and changeovers.
Warehouse Management
257

• Inventory. The SKU volume and mix have generated high inventory
levels and low inventory turns. The company faced having a warehouse full
of the wrong product.
• Product repack/damage/dunnage removal. To meet customer require-
ments, the warehouse often had to pick existing SKUs, unpack them, tear
them down, remanufacture the appliance, and then repack and ship the
product. This was very time-consuming and required products to be han-
dled multiple times, often resulting in damaged product.
• Customer delivery. Fifteen percent of customer orders were shipped
short, resulting in a signiﬁcant amount of charge-backs.
After recognizing that the cost of continuing business in the current for-
mat was impossible, customized warehousing was considered as an alterna-
tive. Several product lines were identiﬁed as candidates for generic produc-
tion. For one, Class B, customization was limited to promotional stickers,
with the outer carton remaining the same. The Class A products required a
variety of alternative lockout devices and handles.
Class A products, which require additional manufacturing, were taken
to the warehouse as soon as generic assembly was complete. The generic
product would be stored in collapsible pallet bins in the warehouse until
shipment. Class B products are assembled and stored in generic cartons, pal-
letized and put away until an order is received. At that point, ﬁnal assembly
steps are completed, and the product is shipped. Because the current order
lead time is ﬁve days, all inventory within SureLock’s warehouse is generic,
allowing ﬁnal assembly to occur while still meeting customer requirements.
For SureLock, customized warehousing has had a positive impact on the
business because
• it circumvented the bottleneck at process and inspection for high-
volume, high-variability items
• it minimized the impact of continued SKU proliferation and occur-
rences of the warehouse being full of the wrong SKUS mix
• it reduced the number of charge-backs from customers, the amount
of damage/repair/rework, and the amount of obsolete inventory and
slow movers

Warehousing in the new millennium requires that logistics managers put
into practice everything from customer service partnerships to cross dock-
ing and electronic data interchange (EDI). A recent report from Tompkins
Associates (Raleigh, N.C.; 919-876-3667), 10 Trends Warehouses Must Fol-
low for 21st Century Success, highlights the top ten tactics that managers must
incorporate into their warehouse organizations.
1. A focus on the customer. Successful ﬁrms will talk and listen to cus-
tomers and develop true partnerships with suppliers and customers, beneﬁt-
ing from information sharing, joint planning, and win-win agreements.
These ﬁrms also understand that warehouses must add value by being efﬁ-
cient and responsive to customer needs.
2. Compression of operations and time. The trend toward more frequent
shipments and more activity in receiving, putaway, picking, and shipping
will place greater demands on material handling systems. In addition, the
trend toward consolidation will require bigger DCs to process more orders
per day.
3. Continuous ﬂow. The focus will be on pulling product through the lo-
gistics system and avoiding huge inventories.
4. Cross docking. Streamlining shipping and receiving operations is
among the top ﬁve ways that managers use to control logistics costs, ac-
cording to recent Managing Logistics data. Cross docking is the common tac-
tic that companies use to facilitate those activities.
Tompkins points out that fewer warehouses handling more orders will
transform most operations to cross-docking practices. Collaboration and the
ability to exchange information in real time will facilitate handling product
in this manner.
5. Electronic transactions. Implementing a paperless warehouse can sim-
plify and streamline tracking. Electronic data will increase tracking capabil-
ities and reduce overall labor requirements and training. Electronic control
systems can eliminate secondary data entry delays, update inventory, and
make product available when received. These systems can then allocate in-
ventory to either pick locations or bulk storage locations upon receipt of
conﬁrmation. Electronic transactions between companies will continue to
Warehouse Management

provide huge opportunities, linking warehouses to suppliers and other dis-
tributors.
“We are expanding our EDI capabilities,” says an inventory manager for
an Illinois-based electrical supplier. “We service 115 locations in 25 states.
Our efforts are to reduce cycle time—the time from when an order is placed
to when the invoice is paid. With the expansion of our EDI software, we can
reduce that time.”
6. Customized warehousing. Compliance labeling, dunnage, palletiza-
tion, and on-demand packaging are just some of several customized services
essential to warehousing. These services will continue to evolve and expand.
7. Third-party warehousing. More small and medium companies will use
third-party warehousing to leverage capital and increase service levels. This
statement is supported by data in the Guide to Third Party Logistics Service Pro-
viders, published by Armstrong & Associates, Inc., (Stoughton, Wis.; 608-
873-8929). According to the report, 70% of the Fortune 100 are using third-
party logistics providers (3PLs), compared to 44% of the Fortune 500. The
reason is that these relationships tend to offer greater opportunities for prof-
itability and long-term partnerships.
8. Shrinking orders. Better information availability, improved technol-
ogy, vendor managed inventory programs, and the elimination of on-site re-
tail warehouses will facilitate smaller orders.
9. Automation. Warehouses will increase automation, not labor, to han-
dle work volumes. More conveyors will be needed to move small totes and
cases across long distances and to sort to the repacking station or loading
dock. More automated picking equipment, such as A-frames and dispensers,
will improve throughput capacity without building additional space.
Many warehouse managers say that RF, bar coding, and material han-
dling equipment are working to minimize the movement of materials in-
house and decrease the search for product by material handlers.
According to one operations manager for a large plumbing tool supplier
in Ohio, the hiring of a material handling consultant to assist in the layout,
design, and installation of the equipment resulted in an 11% increase in pro-
ductivity and a 22% reduction in employee overtime, and ﬁll rates increased
to 99.8%.
10. The human factor. The rising presence of automation means that
workers must continue to enhance their technical skills, particularly as they
relate to computers. Companies must retain the best workers, train them in
new technologies, and cross-train them in all warehouse job functions.
260

One manager of a manufacturer of power generation equipment in Con-
necticut reports that he reassigned warehouse tasks to reduce clerical staff and
cross-trained the remaining staff to take on more strategic initiatives.
Ultimately, the warehouse depends on its leaders. These leaders must vi-
sualize where the organization is going and know how to lead the company
to get there. A leader must communicate this vision to employees to bring
out their best performances and allow them to assume accountability for
their own actions.
“Success really depends on a quality workforce with inspirational lead-
ers,” says Brian Hudock, managing principal at Tompkins.

A recent survey of 200 warehouse and information technology (IT) execu-
tives provides the latest thinking on distribution, WMSs, and enabling tech-
nologies, and on how to apply these tools successfully. Warehousing Systems
and the Supply Chain: A Survey of Success Factors (WERC), is the result of an
exclusive survey developed by Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting).
It is packed with ideas, hints, and recommendations for navigating this tech-
nology maze successfully. 
Overall, we consider this report to be required reading for all those who
are directly or indirectly affected by WMS technology. The following ex-
cerpts from the report relate to some of the more controversial aspects sur-
rounding the technology and provide guidance on dealing with them. 
No Shortage, but Which Work? 
Today’s warehouse management professionals can use the warehouse mod-
ule of their enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Or they can use a
custom software solution, designed for their operation. A third choice is em-
ploying one of the rapidly growing “packaged” solutions typically bolted-
on to the ERP system.
What the survey concludes is that ERP systems are not providing the re-
quired functionality for most of today’s distribution operations. The data in-
dicate that about 6 in 10 ERP purchasers reject the use of the ERP’s ware-
house module for their operation (see Figure I-7.3 and I-7.4).

261

Also, the well-known challenges associated with custom software solu-
tions for managing the warehouse are spurring a movement to an emerging
sector: the packaged WMS solution. The advantages of buying a package
versus a customized solution include
• Faster implementation
• Quicker realization of beneﬁts

• Easier maintenance
• Allowance for future upgrades, enabling a company to take advantage
of new and improved functionality as it becomes available.
WMS package solutions emerge, but there’s no clear market leader. From an in-
dustry that was nonexistent four years ago, market share for packaged WMS
solutions has risen to 65%, according to the survey. However, the WMS
market is fragmented, with many small players and, historically, no clear
market leader. For example, 45% of respondents from midsized companies
answered “Other” when asked what WMS vendors they use. Of the ven-
dors mentioned, none has more than a 10% market share, and the top seven
vendors account for less than 40% of the market.
Raging debate: Fit the software to the operations, or ﬁt the operations to the soft-
ware? The traditional WMS implementation approach was to ﬁt the software
to the existing business model. Today, according to the report, the trend is
toward ﬁtting the operation to the software. Companies that are putting in
ERP systems are more likely to ﬁt the operation to the software, and “rightly
so,” the study agrees. The rationale? “Large software vendors have built good
business processes into their systems, including best practices,” the report of-
fers. They also provide a lot of ﬂexibility in setting up the system.
Most software packages are parameter-driven. They allow companies to tai-
lor software to their facility layout and operational requirements. “Because
the software is so much better now, companies should be able to ﬁt their op-
erations to the software in most cases,” the report concludes.
According to the report, “WMS vendors are starting to take a true pack-
age approach with their products. They understand what it means to de-
velop and maintain package software and are starting to hire the right people
to create these capabilities.” Also, vendors understand the importance of
industry-speciﬁc functionality and are enhancing software to meet these
needs. 
If You Must Modify
The report advises that if you require functionality that is not well supported,
try to negotiate with your vendor to add the functionality to the package.
Most WMS packages are still evolving, and if your requirements are com-
mon in your industry, and the vendor is committed to supporting your in-
dustry, chances are that they will be interested in adding functionality to the
base package. 
However, if the process is unique, evaluate the business beneﬁt before

you customize, the report urges. There may be other ways to accomplish the
same results. “You should only develop modiﬁcations that truly create com-
petitive advantage or add value for your customers.” 
Finally, if there is a need to make modiﬁcations, design them so that they
reside at the periphery of the system. By avoiding modiﬁcations to the base
package, “software updates still can be facilitated.”
Focus on the Overall Solution
Despite the critical role in executing the integrated supply chain, software is
not the ultimate answer; it is a tool. Like any tool, you must understand the
role it plays and the value it brings. Too often, companies focus on techni-
cal success. “But you can only get value from your distribution software if
you understand how it ﬁts into your operations,” the report advises. There-
fore, to create your overall solution, you need to
• Develop a comprehensive strategy on how business processes will be improved.
Also, consider the values that they will deliver and how the technology will
facilitate these improvements. To get the desired results, a company needs a
comprehensive strategy that aligns technology, people, and processes.
• Design processes so that they meet both your short-term and your long-term
requirements. WMS implementations often fail because management did not
pay enough attention to aligning business processes with technology and
software solutions.
• Understand the organizational changes needed to sustain the beneﬁts. Orga-
nizations do not always fully understand that the organizational structure has
to change and that training, new skills, and incentives must be developed.
Many respondents commented on the importance of training and preparing
people for change.
• Build in ﬂexibility. Ensure that ﬂexibility is included in all the dimen-
sions of the organization, processes, and physical assets so that you can align
more easily with future strategy changes.

Today’s better warehouses are no longer just static repositories for parts and
materials. Leading providers have now become indispensable value-added
participants of the supply chain. Propelling this change, and so many others,
is new IT. EDI and RF inventory tracking, speciﬁcally, are essential to keep
pace with the evolution of today’s warehouses.
WMS Demand
The “outside” pressure to automate a warehouse is relentless. Dan Trew,
vice president of product strategy at Catalyst International, Inc. (Milwaukee,
Wis; 414-362-6800) says, “The reason most people put automation in their
warehouse is because customers demand it—speciﬁcally for value-added
services and information.”
Similarly, two recent research studies from the WERC (Warehouse Sys-
tems and the Supply Chain and The Changing Role of Warehousing) observe, “Sev-
eral large manufacturers were equipping plant warehouses with client/server
warehouse management systems.” In addition, “Several manufacturers char-
acterized WMS and EDI capabilities as ‘mandatory’ for any warehouses they
do business with.”
Trew makes the following observations:
• Of the 980,000 commercial warehouses in the United States, less
than 15% are automated.
• Customer-speciﬁc, value-added services performed by warehouses,
such as vendor compliance, custom labeling, kitting, and vendor managed
inventory, will increase by 50% over the next two years.
• More dollars will be spent on information systems to support the
supply chain than on inventory carrying costs, which range from 15% to
35%.
Why the Emphasis on WMS? 
Warehousing leaders participating in the WERC (Oak Brook, Ill.; www.
werc.org) research cited the following as rationales for their WMS installa-
tions:

• Better IT is necessary to speed operations and decrease errors.
WMSs, EDI, and RF inventory tracking are becoming mandatory.
• A WMS is the means to control the transactions and to produce vis-
ibility in the supply chain.
J. Eric Peters, associate partner at Accenture (formerly Andersen Con-
sulting), San Francisco, emphasizes that warehouse management systems
must “help deliver a business solution as opposed to something that is put in
the warehouse to reduce labor.” In fact, he sees WMS as being more strate-
gic than in the past. “It’s now being looked at more as a strategic tool to have
efﬁciency in the supply chain,” he told his audience at a Distribution/Com-
puter seminar.
Others echoed similar sentiments. For instance, Olin Broadway, man-
aging associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (Atlanta, Ga.; 770-643-
5042), described WMS as “an integral link in a good supply chain. To do
available-to-promise JIT purchasing and accurate transportation planning,
you need a block-and-tackle foundation that can provide real-time visibil-
ity of accurate inventory. Warehouse management systems, I contend, are
that foundation,” he emphasizes.
WMS Essentials
According to Trew, the essential building blocks include real time updates, val-
idation, interface to equipment, EDI, RF, and bar codes. He explained, “You
have to know what your exact quantities are in real time. And every activity
in the warehouse, whether it’s a move, replenishment, pick, or store, must be
validated. It’s the only way to maintain high levels of inventory accuracy.” 
For automated warehouses, you should expect 99+% inventory accu-
racy by location. RF terminals and bar codes help achieve this objective. In
addition, Trew argued, “Once you put in an automated system, you should
no longer be in the business of doing physical inventories.”
Meanwhile, John M. Hill, partner at Cypress Associates, agrees that
most WMS providers can deliver on the “typical WMS functions.” How-
ever, where they differentiate themselves is in the resource management
features, such as
• Order planning and scheduling
• Inventory allocation
• Lot and serial number tracking
266
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

• Shelf-life monitoring
• Unit of measure conversion
• Task assignment and monitoring
• Location management
• Cycle counting
• Replenishment and consolidation
• Real-time updates and reports
At the Distribution/Computer seminar, Hill emphasized that “some
features are far more important, depending on your company and the appli-
cation you’re trying to achieve, so make sure to focus on the differences
when looking for your WMS solution.” Further, he warned, “All too often,
people get turned on by technology and overlook the fundamentals of the
basics. I prefer to take a hard look to determine what is meaningful to my
particular operation.”
Project Creep
“Project scope control is the single biggest problem we see on warehouse
management system projects,” maintains John Seidl, partner at Deloitte
Consulting (Atlanta, Ga.; jseidl@dttus.com). It is part of the education pro-
cess once you get into the project and realize what the full capability of the
selected system is.
However, although scope creep is a natural part of these projects, he
warns of the need to manage it and keep it under control. Additionally,
where the scope is changed, you should document and reset the expecta-
tions, Seidl emphasizes. “It’s a big mistake to change the deliverables with-
out changing the cost, time, and resource expectations.”
Further, he cautions that testing and training schedules often get com-
pressed. “We go into the construction phase and things begin to stretch; then
scope creep impacts the schedule,” he explains. However, the original dead-
line remains. “What people tend to do to save the deadline is to cut back on
testing the system and training the operators.” He explains. “I’ve seen im-
plementations where ‘going live’ was, in fact, the ﬁrst time the team did an
integrated production test of the system. This you don’t want to do,” Seidl
counseled. “You’re setting yourself up for disaster,” he declared at the Dis-
tribution/Computer seminar
But the basic message, as issued by the WERC research, is not going to

change: WMS technology and integrated supply chain management are the
foundations that a warehouse must have to build success.

Warehouse management systems are often considered a technical and oper-
ational success but are deemed a failure from a ﬁnancial standpoint. This is
not a situation in which you want to be. In too many cases, however, WMS
justiﬁcation is based primarily on the purchase price of the software and
hardware cost. This misses a variety of other costs that can explode the bud-
get and invalidate the cost justiﬁcation if not considered (see Table I-7.4).
“Capturing these costs at the justiﬁcation and budgeting phase of a proj-
ect will ensure that ﬁnancial expectations are set at the appropriate level,” says
Jon Pildis of PricewaterhouseCoopers (Atlanta, Ga.; 770-643-5178). Simi-
larly, Christopher R. Barnes, manager of supply chain management practice
at Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting; Atlanta, Ga.; 404-880-9100),
offers, “It is critical for the investment component to be as accurate as pos-
sible to provide a meaningful ROI [return on investment]. However, there
are many cost components of WMS that frequently go unnoticed.” 
The People Element and “Hidden” Internal Costs
“You’re going to have dedicated resources on the team, so you’re going to
have to account for more than just salaries,” explains Pildis (see Table I-7.5).
For instance, there will be extra warehouse labor during start-up. Typically,
efﬁciency drops very dramatically after start-up (see Figure I-7.5). Every

WMS goes through it. “To counteract that, if it is unacceptable to have the
output fall, you’re going to experience an increase of labor for the ﬁrst
couple of months after start-up,” he outlined at a Distribution/Computer
seminar (C. S. Report, Inc.; Uwchland, Pa.; 610-458-6410).
Meanwhile, Barnes points out that “software training courses may be
required for internal personnel who will work on the implementation.”
Typically, the WMS software training cost is part of the purchase price, and
training is done at the client site. However, it is not uncommon for vendors
to request client training at the vendor site, where “facilities may be more
conducive to an effective training process.” Therefore, training fees, airfare,
lodging, and related expenses should be budgeted for employees who will
travel to attend training sessions, he itemizes in IIE Solutions. Also, he re-
minds, if systems are being installed in multiple sites, “anticipate additional
travel expenses.”
Retention Bonus for Key Employees
“An often overlooked indirect cost of system setup is long-term employee
retention, especially those employees directly involved with the implemen-
tation project,” warns Barnes. “In a market where technology is a hot cor-
porate trend, the demand for people with experience in implementing and
running WMS is growing.” It is not unusual, he points out, for someone
with major WMS implementation and user experience to confront a signif-
icant increase in salary from other organizations that are in need of this
“short-supplied skill set.” 
In fact, Seidl strongly recommends putting in a retention bonus for
those who “stay the life of the project.” He believes that it is worth the in-
vestment. “After you do one of these projects successfully, the phones will
be ringing off the hook as headhunters come looking for members of the
implementation team.”
Data Entry Cost
During the conﬁguration stage of a WMS, up to 60% of the time spent at
the terminal is spent manually entering stock keeping unit and storage loca-
tion information, according to Barnes. Typical SKU data include part num-
ber, description, product family, ABC class, as-picked unit of measure
(UOM), and inventory status. Location data include warehouse name, ad-
dress, dimensions, constraints, type, and comments. “Approximately 70% to
270
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

80% of the information for each record will be the same,” Barnes notes.
However, a separate record is required for each SKU and location.
“When you consider that there are several tens of thousands of SKUs
and several thousand locations in a typical facility, setting up a SKU and lo-
cation records can be a tedious and burdensome process,” he acknowledges.
To expedite this data entry process, several software packages are available
that can be programmed to perform scripted iterations of data entry into the
WMS records.
This data entry software may ease the data entry task, but it still requires
signiﬁcant setup and data validation costs. An alternative to purchasing mass
data entry software is to use either internal or external administrative sup-
port. If this approach is used, it is common to use temporary personnel to
provide short-term assistance for this laborious task. “Either way,” he advises,
“build data entry cost into the budget.”
Overlooked Annual Operating Costs
“A standing WMS team is a requirement once the implementation is com-
plete,” offers Pildis. “A few folks will remain on-site to support the opera-
tions for complex conﬁguration changes, such as expansion to the ware-
house, new racks, and revised processes.” This cannot be left to the
warehouse manager and his or her team to put into the WMS. Also, if us-
ing a third party relational database, such as Oracle, certain maintenance
activities will require in-house personnel. 
Other costs include third-party hardware. “When negotiating the con-
tract with the WMS provider, you talk about their annual maintenance costs,
which might be 15% of the license fee,” Pildis mentions. “However, there’s
a whole slew of these types of costs that are rarely talked about during con-
tract negotiations.”
“Most organizations have standard project cost contingencies,” adds
Barnes. “Whether 5%, 10%, or 15%, it is recommended to plan for the un-
expected.” Among these “other” expenses are the ongoing licensing fees for
WMS software, middleware software, and Unix servers. 
“The cost of the agreement varies and depends on the level of future ef-
fort expected from vendors,” Barnes explains. Additionally, maintenance
contracts generally will be made on RF equipment and other hardware pe-
ripherals used throughout the facility. “Even if equipment maintenance is
done in-house, costs should be built in to purchase and maintain backup
equipment and MRO supplies for the production equipment,” says Barnes.

With the greater emphasis on the speed of the WMS implementation,
other costs besides those for hardware and software will require closer in-
spection. Therefore, it will be imperative for readers to be vigilant in iden-
tifying and considering all these “other” costs when planning and budgeting
WMS to achieve a more accurate ﬁnancial perspective of the project.

W L
As margins are squeezed and the pressure to ﬁnd cost-saving opportunities
builds, logistics managers are setting their sights on the warehouse as the last
frontier in managing logistics. Everything from material ﬂow to physical lay-
out represents a chance to save hundreds of thousands of dollars every year.
This potential has led software developers to design systems around ware-
house logistics and practitioners to rethink their facility processes and pro-
cedures.
Here are some issues to consider about your own warehouse:
1. Focus on the interior. “Warehouse logistics is a subset of logistics,” says
Doug Walker, vice president and general manager of the NxTrend Logistics
Division (Colorado Springs, Colo.; 719-264-4734). “The focus is on being
an extension of inventory management. Managers should know what is oc-
curring within the warehouse and how the product is managed.”
Focus on the functions that occur inside the facility as well, such as re-
ceipt, putaway, replenishment, stocking, cycle counting, and so on. The
point, says Walker, is to have visibility of the product at any given time in an
effort to improve accuracy.
2. Consider moving your location. As the primary supplier to its customers,
Refrigeration Suppliers Distributors (RSD; Lake Forest, Calif.; 949-380-
7878) moved its warehouse location to gain transportation efﬁciencies.
(Chicago Consulting recommends setting up warehouse networks closest to
the U.S. population. See Table I-7.1 and the ﬁrst section of this chapter.)
3. Use automatic identiﬁcation. The move that RSD made into a new set-
ting gave the distributor an opportunity to implement state-of-art technol-
ogy, explains Carl Vaughn, general manager of RSD. 
Bar coding is one of those technologies to consider, believes John
Marek, senior partner with Beltech, Inc. (Grand Rapids, Mich.; 616-531-
272
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

0725), a consulting ﬁrm. He says that it is wise to have product enter the
warehouse with a bar code label for easier tracking. And the use of handheld
RF units brings real-time activity to the worker in the picking area.
“The warehouse is a moving target,” says Marek. “It is all about trans-
actions—the time of day orders come in and go out.” Bar coding is a great
tool for keeping track of those transactions, he adds.
4. Install a WMS. In conjunction with automatic identiﬁcation, use a
WMS or similar solution. Vaughn says that RSD is using the Total Ware-
house Logistics (TWL) solution from NxTrend to gain control and instill a
level of organization that the distributor was not getting from its previous
paper-based system. “We were falling short in terms of efﬁciency and turned
to TWL to improve our efﬁciency and accuracy in supplying our 50
branches.”
“Distributors are coming to us looking for these solutions,” says Walker.
“The warehouse has been the last frontier to adopt the technology, but now
companies realize that they should take advantage of the power it offers.”
Make sure that the warehouse package can interface to the ERP system
that you may already be using. This ensures a total supply chain planning so-
lution.
5. Examine physical layouts. Traveling inside the warehouse just to pick
product is the most time-consuming activity (see Figure I-7.6), so it makes
sense that you should start with the layout of the facility when designing
your warehouse logistics system. “You can’t make improvements if the site
is laid out wrong or improperly racked,” says Marek.
Vaughn explains how changing racking systems has sped up the rate of
selecting product. “Our fastest movers are shipped out in case quantities. We
have installed ﬂow rack in the fast-pick area to increase the pick faces and
eliminate the need to reach for items that were too high or too low in our
previous layout, which supported pallet storage.” When a case is removed,
the next one slides forward, replenishing from the back end. The ﬂow-rack
design has improved pick performance from 80 lines per hour to 180 lines
per hour.
6. Perform order cycle counts. RSD counts A items every quarter, B items
twice every six months, C items once every six months, and D items once a
year. Vaughn says that this has increased accuracy signiﬁcantly.
7. Consider market demand. What pressures do your customers put on the
warehouse that force you to do things a certain way? Do you have enough
labor to handle the material ﬂow?

8. Conduct a warehouse operations audit. This includes a warehouse per-
formance and practices gap analysis. The purpose is to reveal if and how a
change would beneﬁt the operation.
Seven Additional Basics
Once you have reviewed your warehouse operations, you are ready to take
action. World-class warehouse operations, or those that hope to be, should
focus on seven basic physical principles, developed by Edward H. Frazelle:
1. Proﬁle.Create and maintain order proﬁles, item activity proﬁles, and
planning proﬁles to identify process impediments and opportunities for im-
provement.
2. Benchmark. Measure warehouse performance, practices, and operat-
ing infrastructure.
3. Simplify. Eliminate as much work content as possible. Because most
of the work involves material and information handling, focus process re-
design initiatives here.
4. Computerize. Incrementally justify and implement WMSs, paperless
warehousing systems, and decision support tools to maintain the warehouse
activity proﬁle, to track warehouse performance and resource utilization,
and to enforce warehouse processes.

5. Mechanize. Incrementally justify and implement mechanized mate-
rial handling and storage systems to improve throughput and storage density
and to assist warehouse operators in difﬁcult material handling activities.
6. Lay out. Lay out the warehouse processes and material handling and
storage systems to form a smooth ﬂow of material and information between
processes and to maximize ﬂoor space and building cube use.
7. Humanize. Involve warehouse operators in redesigning warehouse
processes. Develop team and individual performance goals and implement
ergonomic improvements.

Because of a push for quality improvements, logistics managers have made
increased order accuracy a top priority. Using a combination of methods,
managers report signiﬁcant improvements in accuracy levels and expect to
achieve even more in the next few years. Here are a few of the tried and true
order accuracy tools that will work in any organization.
Methods for Improving Order Accuracy
The order accuracy rate, as deﬁned by the WERC (Oak Brook, Ill.; 630-
990-0001), is the percentage of the total orders that a warehouse picks,
packs, and ships correctly to customers. 
In a recently published report from WERC, Order Accuracy: How High
Is The Hurdle? managers cite factors inﬂuencing increased order accuracy
(see Table I-7.6) and activities that increase order accuracy (see Table I-7.7). 
The report highlights three proven methods for improving order accuracy:

1. Use employee training programs. Respondents to the WERC survey in-
dicated that the most popular human resources (HR) method for increasing
order accuracy was additional employee training. Incentive programs ﬁn-
ished a distant second.
Other HR suggestions are aptitude testing, discipline-based programs,
employee involvement programs, split shifts, process improvement team
meetings, and the development of smaller, high-paid core groups.
2. Use WMSs. Sixty percent of total respondents reported that their
ﬁrms use some type of WMS for inventory accuracy. When comparing
company size, only 46% of smaller companies reported using a WMS, com-
pared to 58% for medium-size ﬁrms and 62% for larger organizations.
The level of order accuracy using a WMS depends on system sophisti-
cation, degree of employee training, degree of control over procedures, and
the number of SKUs.
3. Use locator systems. Approximately 27% of the ﬁrms reported no use
of a static system, and 20% indicated that their companies were not using any
type of random locator system. At the other extreme, 18% report using en-
tirely static systems, whereas 25% use random systems exclusively. Overall,
the average facility utilizes 43% static and 57% random locator systems.
Firms using a static system estimated a higher percentage of order accu-
racy than did those using random systems. Around 30% of the respondents
report a 99.5% or greater level of order accuracy with a static system com-
pared to 23% for the companies using random systems. 
Overall, a total of 86% of the ﬁrms with static locator systems experi-

enced a 98% or better order accuracy level compared with 80% of those us-
ing random locator systems.
Industry Benchmarks
Whether deploying one or a combination of the above methods, respondents
have seen improvements in order accuracy. For instance, when asked the per-
centage of orders shipped accurately in the last 12 months, more than 50% esti-
mate that their companies performed in the 99% plus category (see Figure I-7.7).
Overall, 82% indicate that their ﬁrms achieved a 98% or higher perfor-
mance level. On average, the percentage of shipping accuracy for all re-
spondents was between 99% and 99.4%.
Respondents were also asked the percentage of orders shipped on time
according to customer expectations. Ninety-ﬁve respondents indicated that
their organizations achieved a 99.5+% level in the last year. Overall, 77% es-
timated a 98% or better on-time shipping performance (see Figure I-7.8).

277
Figure I-7.7
Orders Shipped Accurately
Figure I-7.8
Orders Shipped on Time Based on Customer Expected Ship Date

With regard to the percentage of orders shipped with correct docu-
mentation—bill of lading, manifest, or packing lists, freight bills, and deliv-
ery receipts—over 90% estimate that they have accomplished a 98% or bet-
ter documentation accuracy level. More than three-quarters reported a 99%
or better score (see Figure I-7.9).
Finally, managers were questioned about the percentage of orders re-
ceived damaged. About 53% estimated that their ﬁrms had delivered less
than one-half of one percent of all orders damaged to customers. Overall,
96% of the individuals indicated that their organizations experience a two
percent or less damage rate (see Figure I-7.10).
As a result of these accuracy levels, ﬁrms report increased customer ser-
vice, reduced warehouse costs, improved standard warehouse operating
procedures, better management controls, reduced inefﬁciencies in order
processing, and improved facility use (see Table I-7.8).
Thus, nearly 86% of respondents claim that their ﬁrms will increase their
order accuracy practices in the next two years.

Are Managers Meeting Their Goals?
Despite valiant efforts, ﬁrms are not doing a great job of meeting their ac-
curacy goals. According to the survey, almost two-thirds of respondents
(65%) indicated that their targeted percentage was between 99.5% and
100%. Ninety-six percent say that their goal is set at 98% or greater. Only
about one-third report meeting their target goal, and nearly 85% say their
ﬁrms’ goal is being met almost three-quarters of the time. Of the 65% re-
porting a target between 99.5% and 100%, only 20% are actually reaching
the goal.
All ﬁrms, on average, operate at a success rate of 75% or better, no mat-
ter the size or type of industry.

Many companies striving for an online presence are loath to rely on another
company to handle fulﬁllment and customer service. If the contractor pro-
vides lackluster performance, it reﬂects poorly on the seller and can be a real
problem, especially if the ﬁrm is a retailer.
Fortunately, many fears are being put to rest as third-party providers
have made great strides in perfecting their distribution processes and are able
to perform warehousing activities for online retailers. The beneﬁt to their
customers is that they need not worry about the logistics of order fulﬁllment.
Trading Profits for Warehousing

plier has convinced its retail partners to allow it to warehouse goods and ful-

ﬁll orders for them and, in return, earn 90% of all sales revenue that the re-
tailer brings in on orders that Global Sports ﬁlls.
Why would a retailer want to give up those proﬁts? Consider the expe-
rience of Sport Chalet CEO Craig Levra. Two years ago, he decided that the
company needed to have a substantial Net presence, but the more Sport
Chalet learned about the investment that such a presence would require, the
less appealing the idea became.
“It would require $10 million-plus to get it done the way we wanted to
do it,” Levra says. “Setting up an online shop is never as easy as it looks.” By
linking with Global Sports, Sports Chalet turned over all the warehousing
and fulﬁllment processes to Global Sports, lowering its Web investment sig-
niﬁcantly.
At this point, other e-tailers taking advantage of virtual warehousing
through Global Sports include Foot Locker, The Athlete’s Foot, Sports Au-
thority, and Fox Sports.
Automating Customer Service
Another company that has jumped on the virtual warehousing bandwagon
is iQVC, the online retailing division of QVC.
CommerceHub (www.commercehub.com; 518-886-0700), a leading
provider of virtual warehousing solutions for online retailers and catalog
merchants, will provide electronic business communications between
iQVC and its participating vendors, enabling the automated management of
the iQVC customer service operations from point of sale through delivery.
The CommerceHub Solution is currently in operation at iQVC, following
a successful test period.
“During the past nine months we have worked with CommerceHub to
test and enhance their solution, which we are now rolling out to our drop-
ship vendors,” says Stephen Hamlin, vice president of operations at iQVC.
“The implementation of the CommerceHub supply chain management so-
lution has substantially improved our customer service.”
“Our investment in CommerceHub will allow us to extend our partic-
ipation in e-commerce to the fast-growing and vital area of third-party ful-
ﬁllment,” says Jeffrey Branman, president of Interactive Technology Hold-
ings, LLC. “The rapid expansion of business interconnectivity has made it
possible for retailers to offer outstanding customer service without the need
to own, warehouse, and distribute goods.”

The Glamour of Shipping
ANETorder.com is a third-party fulﬁllment organization serving e-tailers.
“We are our clients’ virtual shipping department,” says Shane Randall, CEO
and president of aNETorder.com. “We focus on the not-so-glamorous
backend of cyber shipping—the actual picking, packing, and shipping of or-
ders.”
Customers include Reader’s Digest Association, National Geographic
Society, and Guideposts, which look to aNETorder.com to handle inven-
tory management, warehousing, and individual and bulk pick-and-pack ca-
pabilities.
Do It Yourself
For those who are still leery about turning over warehousing and fulﬁllment
activities to a third party, consider Internet-based software that can virtually
eliminate storage and inventory costs in your own DC.
White Plains, New York–based Optum, Inc.’s (914-993-3403) Trade-
Stream enables companies to aggregate fulﬁllment content across a trading
community and leverage this information to slash inventory levels up to
one-third and achieve 100% fulﬁllment for all customer orders. 
The application leverages the Web to tie together existing transactional
systems to capture, coordinate, and manage product inventory information
throughout an enterprise and its suppliers, distributors, and customers.
“TradeStream has extended our four walls to surround Invacare’s multipart-
ner trading community with a virtual warehouse,” says Gerry Blouch, pres-
ident and COO at Invacare, a $1 billion manufacturer of home health care
equipment and mobility aids based in Elyria, Ohio. “It provides real-time
visibility of inventory positions and order status across our enterprise, dis-
tributors, and customers. TradeStream will allow us to establish a direct re-
plenishment program to smooth demand volatility and eliminate costly
safety stock—a beneﬁt to both Invacare and our customers.” “TradeStream
is a direct hit in dramatically reducing the trillion-dollar inventory invest-
ment U.S. companies have sitting still in warehouses,” says Bruce Richard-
son, senior vice president of research at AMR Research. 
Eliminating sitting inventory was the main goal at ecampus.com. The
online college bookstore felt that it could achieve that goal by using old-
school methods of warehousing and distribution. It has taken a number of
Warehouse Management
281

steps to integrate its inventory and distribution network with its Web store-
front to ensure that distribution is as fast and efﬁcient as are browsing and
shopping the Internet.
A fully conveyered, state-of-the-art automated distribution system sup-
ports the fulﬁllment architecture. Inventory availability and shipping esti-
mates are shown on the site for every product sold.
Ecampus.com’s latest innovation is an enhanced cross-docking system
designed to further speed the process of getting merchandise into the hands
of customers. The cross-docking system enables ecampus.com to turn in-
coming books into outgoing shipments in as little as an hour.
“We have easily put as much time and effort into building our distribu-
tion network as we have our Web storefront,” says Wallace G. Wilkinson,
chairman and CEO of ecampus.com. “One of the strengths of any success-
ful Internet company is the technology and infrastructure it employs to de-
liver the product once the customer has purchased online. Cross docking
gives ecampus an added advantage in customer satisfaction.”
The decision made in the early stages of the Company’s development to
integrate the Web site fully with the distribution channel is paying dividends.
“We are in a much better position than other companies that do not man-
age their own fulﬁllment to grow and adapt as changes occur in the market-
place,” adds Wilkinson.
Prior to the implementation of cross docking, all inventory was handled
in the same way. An item was received, processed into the warehouse man-
agement system, conveyed to the proper zone, and slotted awaiting alloca-
tion to an order. Cross docking enables ecampus to bypass the slotting and
allocation process and move items for which an order exists directly to ship-
ping. The entire process takes one hour.

Your warehouse staff should not be without a copy of Warehousing Prof-
itably: A Manager’s Guide. The book, written by Ken Ackerman, a leading
authority on warehousing issues, is a major reworking of the book he orig-
inally published in 1994. This “update,” as it is called, contains almost 50%
new and original material that is critical to modern warehouse manage-
ment.
282
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

Just the Facts
The value to the reader is that it is a fact-ﬁlled, straightforward presentation
of the technology, techniques, and concepts that warehouse managers con-
front almost daily. In addition, Warehousing Proﬁtably can also serve as a
much-needed reference for the warehouse manager’s boss.
Ackerman easily brings the warehouse manager into the twenty-ﬁrst
century of warehouse issues. For example, he discusses the supply chain, an
unknown concept in 1994, but widely touted now, frankly. As is his style,
he prods readers by asking, “Is supply chain management really different
from logistics management, or is it just a different name for the same thing?”
His answer: “Supply chain management, logistics, and warehousing are
closely related. Logistics is the process of ﬁlling the gaps, and supply chain
management is the process of closing them. A company can achieve excel-
lence in logistics without supply chain management. However, it is not pos-
sible to have a great supply chain without also being effective with logistics.
At the same time, that effective logistics systems requires a competent ware-
housing function.”
Cycle Counting Addressed
In the original book, cycle counting was not discussed. However, in the
contemporary warehouse, Ackerman believes that cycle counting is an in-
dispensable tool. In fact, he is rather blunt: “Failure to consider cycle count-
ing suggests that your managers are not in touch with state-of-the art in-
ventory control methods.”
In describing cycle counting, he advises: “It is important to recall that a
prime objective of cycle counting is the identiﬁcation and elimination of er-
rors. Therefore, investigation of each bad count is a critical process.” He then
offers some tips:
If the counted quantity is veriﬁed as less than the inventory record, there
are two possibilities, which are easy to check:
• A request for this item was ﬁlled without recording the transaction.
• A sales or production order was incorrectly subtracted from the in-
ventory.
Likewise, if the variance shows that count quantity is higher than book
record, replenishment orders should be reviewed to see if product was
Warehouse Management
283

received and improperly recorded. Recent sales or production orders should
be checked for erroneous subtractions from the records.
Technology and Warehouse Management Systems
The entire subject of the information age is largely new material. Taking it
to the leading edge, Ackerman discusses simulation in the warehouse. “Un-
til recently, computer simulation was too expensive and time-consuming to
be justiﬁed for most warehouse operations,” he expresses. “Simulating ma-
terials-handling systems before buying is somewhat like taking the test drive
at an automobile dealership. Before spending big money for a new distribu-
tion center or a new handling system, it makes sense to take it for a test run,”
he voices. Computer simulation makes this possible.
Simulation can help answer the following questions:
• Are there enough dock doors in the warehouse?
• How many lift trucks are needed?
• How many order pickers are needed?
• Where should products be slotted?
• How should workloads be balanced?
The most signiﬁcant result of simulation is the conﬁdence that management
will gain from visualizing the design.
When it comes to warehouse management systems, Ackerman recom-
mends that the manager consider the following three tasks:
• Identify the key differences among the various software packages.
• Identify common deﬁciencies in the WMS software.
• Provide guidelines for developing the request for information (RFI).
He goes on to list differences among crucial features among WMS pack-
ages. Among them are the following:
• Every system should have a means of measurement.
• The better WMS will use a unit of measure method, and it will ana-
lyze and deﬁne speciﬁc cubic volumes per unit.
• The best systems support carton selection and pick-to-carton func-
tions. The WMS that uses pick-to-carton method can save money by elim-
inating packers and packing.

• A good WMS uses a bin locator system to tell the receiving worker
where to store each inbound pallet.
• The bin locator system should evaluate physical factors of the facility
as well as storage rules established by management.
• The same system should compare optional travel paths for picking,
put-away, and replenishment, and then indicate the best path for ﬁlling an
order.
According to Ackerman the deﬁciencies that are commonly found in
WMS packages include the following:
• Some vendors have not integrated the handling of hazardous materi-
als into their systems.
• Some systems do not store error data.
• Some systems have productivity reporting but do not have produc-
tivity standards.
• Many systems omit the load-planning feature. This is desirable if you
frequently build pallet loads or container loads.
Outsourcing Reverse Logistics? 
This is a topic that is becoming increasingly important for today’s warehouse
operations. Ackerman’s advice: “In considering products, the ﬁrst appraisal
is the value of returned-goods inventory. If that value does not reach an
economy of scale, the reverse logistics process may not be worthwhile.”
“Warehousing and inventory control speciﬁcations will be governed by
answers to the following”:
• What is the total volume moving through a reclamation center each
week, month, year?
• What portion of each reclamation center will be devoted to returned
goods?
• How much warehousing time will be devoted to returned goods?
• How many inventory turns per year can be expected in each re-
turned-goods category?

edge, information, and guidance it provides. It’s an excellent reference for

Matching inventory to the right area, location, and equipment is the ﬁrst
step toward saving money and improving productivity in the warehouse.
That is why proper slotting plays such a critical role in warehousing opera-
tions. The following advice will help you develop a slotting strategy for your
warehouse inventory handling needs.
Operator travel time is a signiﬁcant non-value-added task. Proper inventory
slotting helps eliminate the excessive travel and search associated with order
picking. It also improves operator productivity and helps establish the ware-
house layout to an optimum condition. Thompson Brockmann, senior
consultant at Tompkins Associates (Raleigh, N.C.; 919-876-3667; www.
tompkinsinc.com) lists the following advantages of proper product slotting:
• Reduces picking labor requirements by locating product in the opti-
mal pick sequence
• Reduces replenishment labor requirements by matching product
unit loads with the appropriately sized storage slot
• Reduces response time and improves ﬂow by balancing workload be-
tween operators
• Increases pick accuracy by separating similar products to avoid prox-
imity picking errors
• Reduces possibility of injuries by placing product in its ergonomi-
cally best location
• Reduces product damages by organizing heavier product ﬁrst in the
pick path, ahead of crushable product
• Increases palletizing productivity by arranging product by case height
allowing the building of tighter pallets for better trailer utilization
• Defers capital expansion by maintaining the optimum warehouse
layout and cube utilization, reducing the need for building expansion

Warehouse slotting/re-slotting methodology. Warehouse managers must play
the role of a minor sleuth to gather the required data found throughout the
warehouse. “What we are doing is setting up data to do item proﬁling to
determine the proper slotting,” maintains Dan Basmajian, senior vice pres-
ident, Manhattan Associates, Inc. (Atlanta, Ga.; 770-955-7070; www.
manhattanassociates.com). “If you focus on selector productivity gains, in
most instances that will turn into productivity gains in replenishment and
receiving as well.”
Several sets of data must be deciphered, he notes. One set accounts for
the SKU mix kept within the pick lines. Included in this data must be an un-
derstanding of product dimensions; unit movement, which includes unit
volume or turnover; hits or popularity of the item; and cube measurement.
“In addition, pick density, which takes into account the popularity of the
product in ratio to the cubic movement of the item, provides managers with
the information of how many picks a product generates per unit cube of it-
self,” he details in WERCsheet.
Similarly, Brockmann proposes doing a demand analysis phase to deter-
mine the picking and replenishment attributes of each product. He suggests
breaking each line of the shipping ﬁle into its full pallet picks, full case picks,
and each pick component. Then assign each SKU to an A, B, or C classiﬁ-
cation, with the As being the fastest movers and the Cs being the slowest
movers. 
Choosing slot types that are already available within the warehouse or that can
be added. Warehouse managers must know opening dimensions, weight lim-
itations by level, proximity to shipping dock or pick path, and movement
values of each item.
Brockmann’s location analysis includes obtaining data relative to:
• Location identiﬁcation
• Location type (reserve or forward pick)
• Storage equipment (pallet, drive-in, bulk)
• Pick equipment type (pallet ﬂow, carton ﬂow, carousel)
• Pick type (full pallet, full case, broken case)
• Location height, width, depth, and capacity
Deﬁning the slotting strategy. “Although all of these factors are available,
slotting schemes are typically based on either the popularity or the volume
of an item, but rarely both,” asserts Edward Frazelle, executive director at
Warehouse Management
287

Logistics Management Center (Atlanta, Ga.). “This is one of the most com-
mon mistakes made in slotting, and what gets us into the most trouble.”
Brockmann explains that products should be assigned to locations in ac-
cordance with the objectives identiﬁed during the goal identiﬁcation phase.
It is clearly the ﬁrst step in any product relocation program. He breaks goal
identiﬁcation into objectives (efﬁciencies to be achieved by reslotting) and
constraints (barriers that must be taken into account when slotting). Barri-
ers, which usually require some of the efﬁciencies (minimizing travel dis-
tance, increasing pick rates) to be forfeited, include weight of the product,
size of the locations, and picking accuracy.
For facilities with multiple areas or equipment for picking, product slot-
ting is a two-step process, he notes. First, the item must be assigned to the
area or equipment type; then the item is assigned an actual location. Com-
mon slotting objectives and a brief description of their associated strategies
help guide the location process (see Table I-7.9).
Slot maintenance must become an essential fact of life for warehouse managers.
“Usually as soon as an item is slotted properly, something changes,” observes
Frazelle in WERCsheet. “Slot maintenance is very important,” stresses Bas-
majian, as it can eliminate the need for a “reset” of the facility, where many
products are moved over a short period in a massive attempt to ﬁx slotting
problems.
An approach that he favors is to determine how many ﬁxes to an exist-
ing pick line can be made in one night to provide the biggest return. Then,

slowly over time, managers can ﬁx other problems by identifying seasonal
items and moving them only when needed or by ensuring that new product
is placed in the proper location right from the beginning.
Another way to manage slot maintenance is to look at tools that main-
tain statistics for every day. Frazelle explains, “If I know where an item is and
how much space it is occupying today, as well as the storage mode and loca-
tion of the mode, and I also know where it should be based on forecasts, I
will know which items aren’t properly slotted anymore.” When there are
discrepancies, or when an item is not in the right place, the warehouse man-
ager should rank them by importance and program the reslotting work that
should be going on,” he advises.

Warehouse management is never ever going to be the same again. That was
the buzz at a recent Distribution/Computer Seminar/Expo (C. S. Report,
Inc.; Uwchland, Pa.; www.logistar.com). The new organizations, new tech-
nologies, and new concepts provided a ﬁrst-hand look at what tools and
techniques inventory, logistics, and warehouse managers will soon have at
their disposal.
James A. Tompkins, president and founder of Tompkins Associates
(Raleigh, N.C.; www.tompkins.com), captured this moment of upheaval
precisely when he declared, “What we really have to do is take most of what
you and I know and throw it away and start over again.”
The new age of warehouse and inventory management. The tools and tech-
nologies we called “advanced” and “innovative” as recent as a year ago are
now outdated, replaced by those that are Internet-involved or ratcheted up
to even greater levels of sophistication. The following is a digest of what

The brick-and-mortar warehouse, believed to be a dinosaur just a few short
years ago, has reemerged as a strategic operation in this drop-and-click era.
“Sophisticated warehouse operators are responding to market demands by
restructuring operations and installing technology, letting them speed in-
ventory through their facilities while adding value to the products,” observes
industry analyst Chris Newton of AMR Research, Inc. (Boston; www.
amrresearch.com). 
“Yesterday’s static cost-center warehouses are morphing into dynamic
distribution centers that often function as proﬁt centers,” he explains in a
special report, Warehousing Isn’t Just about Storage Anymore. The facilities are
highly automated and rely on sophisticated information systems and mate-
rial handling equipment. 
The warehouse as DC. “The DC is the cornerstone of the supply chain,”
Newton maintains. It schedules inbound material, maintains inventory-level
information across multiple locations, coordinates ﬁnal assembly and value-
added processes, and plans for outbound transportation. The DC is the place
where supply responds to demand in a JIT world.
Many dedicated ﬂow-through DCs are now being established by large
Warehouse Management
293

retailers as forward-consolidation centers to receive, mix, and consolidate
merchandise coming in from many suppliers, according to Newton. To ad-
equately support retailer requirements, DCs must be equipped to handle
cross-docking operations; automated high-volume sortation; break-pack
and piece-pack activities; and custom labeling, packing, and kitting. Addi-
tionally, they must be able to process inbound and outbound advanced ship-
ping notices and returns. And it is this latter item that bears watching in the
e-commerce environment.
“Typically, items purchased over the Web have higher return rates,”
notes Lou Cerny, vice president of Sedlak Management Consultants, Inc.
(Richﬁeld, Ohio). For example, he mentions in WERCsheet (WERC;
www.werc.org) that apparel returns run as high as 25%. 
Blurring the boundaries between manufacturing and warehousing. “With their
product life cycles often measured in months, high-tech manufacturers
moved ﬁnal assembly and conﬁguration of products out of the manufactur-
ing plants and into the DCs,” Newton reports. High-tech manufacturers typ-
ically postpone the ﬁnal conﬁguration of the product until the order is placed.
Although the high-tech industry relies on postponement to lower in-
ventory levels and cost, reduce the risk of obsolescence, and increase cus-
tomer loyalty, the beneﬁts come with many complexities for the DC. “The
DC must handle goods at the component level instead of solely at the ﬁn-
ished goods level,” he maintains. “The DC operations must also ensure that
all the parts needed for customization are in stock and that the facility has the
capability and capacity to perform the extra ﬁnal assembly.”
The postponement-centric DCs must employ supply chain execution
software that can handle tasks such as merge-in-transit operations, multi-
warehouse inventory visibility, multilevel bills of material (BOMs), and co-
ordinated movement of component parts. Also, light assembly and kitting
and reverse logistics functions.
e-Commerce to further change the traditional warehouse role. “During the tran-
sition from traditional to Internet fulﬁllment, companies often try to fulﬁll
e-commerce demand from their existing DCs by sending out teams of
workers to pick individual orders manually,” cites Newton. While Internet
sales volumes are small, the strategy will work.
However, as has been discovered, high-order volumes bring such fulﬁll-
ment operations to a screeching halt. To ﬁll Internet orders successfully, DC
operations, according to Newton, must be set up as ﬂow-through facili-
ties, using automated material handling equipment such as A-frames and
carousels to speed up the processing of high volumes of individual orders.
294
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

“The operations must use sophisticated warehouse optimization, or
slotting, software applications that continually determine the best location of
products within the DC based on current demand, which can change daily
or even hourly with e-commerce,” he explains.
The importance of real-time inventory visibility accelerates in this environment.
“Only having real-time information on the activities within the walls of the
facility is no longer sufﬁcient for the DC,” Newton warns. The WMS run-
ning the DC needs to be part of a closed loop of information systems that
feed and receive real-time information to and from Order Management Sys-
tem, Transportation Management System, and Supply Chain Planning ap-
plications.
“Such a close loop provides DC operations with the current status of or-
ders, inbound freight, and outbound shipments to enable them to optimally
manage orders, inventory and assets,” he declares. “Without access to such
information, the DC’s ability to handle merge-in-transit, ﬂow-through,
cross-docking, and light manufacturing is greatly reduced.” 
When it comes to the software, use extreme caution. “Most WMS vendors are
still focusing on the core warehousing tasks and are unable to meet the ad-
vanced need of DCs,” notes Newton. Most vendors offer little in the way of
real-time process and inventory monitoring outside the four walls of a ware-
house, decision-support capability related to labor management and ware-
house optimization, or support for transportation, order, or yard manage-
ment.
However, leading WMS vendors “clearly understand the changing role
of the warehouse in the supply chain and have been actively building or ac-
quiring functionality to meet advanced requirements of DCs,” he observes.
“Although no single vendor has completely integrated a full supply chain ex-
ecution suite of products,” he reports, “a DC can signiﬁcantly improve op-
erational performance by using products from a vendor that has broadened
its SCE [single connection emulation] offering in areas such as transporta-
tion management execution, yard management, labor management, and
value-added service.” Other areas he highlights include
• Order management integration. This allows orders to be added, modi-
ﬁed, or canceled in real time, even after the order has been released to the
warehouse ﬂoor for picking. Such integration provides order takers with vis-
ibility into ﬁnished goods inventory across multiple storage locations.
• Warehouse optimization. Also referred to as slotting, this optimizes the
placement of items in the pick line on a continuing basis. It also calculates

the operational cost of reslotting recommendations and generates instruc-
tions of all accepted moves.
• Cross docking. This allows DCs to direct incoming shipments straight
to the shipping dock to ﬁll outgoing orders, eliminating the costly putaway
and picking operations.
• Reverse logistics. This allows the WMS to receive postreturn and dis-
position codes and screen for noncompliant returns. It adjusts inventory lev-
els, makes goods available for allocation, and maintains lot tracking and his-
tory data. It also supports reverse BOM to break kitted or assembled items
back into components.

Sophisticated speech systems are making their way into warehouse operations,
reducing costs, improving operator productivity, and establishing accuracy
records. The new speech-based technology replaces many of the least auto-
mated, manual warehousing processes, such as picking operations. Speech sys-
tems are also being extended into other operations, such as receiving, putaway,
replenishment, loading, returned goods processing, and cross docking.
Ken Finkel, vice president of business development for Voxware, Inc.
(Princeton, N.J.; www.voxware.com), explained, “Warehouse operators,
armed with wireless wearable computers using advanced speech recognition
technology, Java-based voice browser, and VoiceXML applications, are
transforming the industry and its operations.”
The new technology provides hands-free, eyes-free operation. “Warehouse op-
erators are able to hear instructions and perform the task without having to
look down at a handheld computer display or fumble with a pack of picking
labels,” says Patti Satterﬁeld, formerly director of marketing at Vocollect,
Inc. (Pittsburgh; www.vocollect.com). 
The voice computer interacts in real time with the host WMS via radio
frequency data collection (RF/DC), prompting the operator through a task
with audible commands and waiting for their verbal conﬁrmation or re-
quest, she explains.
The reality of speech-based technology applications. Not long ago, speech sys-
tems were a poor choice for the warehouse because technology was limited
and prone to errors. However, Finkel points out the following:
296
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

• Voice is now used on a regular basis in facilities that regularly operate
at 90 dB to 95 dB of background noise (which is like having a lawnmower
next to you).
• Voice systems can be personalized to accommodate accents and for-
eign languages.
• Strong out-of-vocabulary rejection and highly directional micro-
phones are used in today’s systems.
• Headsets only cover one ear, and eyes remain free to be focused on
potential safety hazards.
• Training is intuitive and averages 15 minutes for one-time personal-
ization. Procedural training is signiﬁcantly faster than is that for screen-based
applications.
Types of speech systems now available. “Speech systems don’t just listen to
voice patterns anymore,” Bert Moore, director at IDAT Consulting (Pitts-
burgh), explains in WERCsheet. “Speech systems now recognize words.”
Based on the needs of the warehouse, users have a choice of speaker-
dependent or speaker-independent systems. With the latter, a voice prompts
the operator to say a variety of numbers or certain words, as the system only
recognizes a certain number of words or numbers.
With the speaker-dependent system, the speaker who will be using it of-
ten trains it. This allows for much greater complexity and vocabulary. New
advancements now allow dependent systems to be reprogrammed and per-
sonalized from one user to the next.
When considering speech systems (see sidebar), users also must deter-
mine whether they want discreet or continuous service. “With a discreet
system, you must pause between words and be very precise,” Moore offers.
“In contrast, continuous systems allow you to talk without a pause. This
may, however, result in a more limited text, but that’s beginning to change.”
Bringing voice technology to the WMS. Two recent announcements high-
light how speech systems are being integrated with WMS software systems.
OMI International (Dallas), a provider of logistics and distribution manage-
ment systems, announced that they would provide a speech-based interface
to its OMI TRICEPS Warehouse Management System using Voxware’s
VoiceLogistics system. The companies have completed a joint development
effort that integrates the VoiceLogistics system to the OMI TRICEPS WMS

Catalyst International (Milwaukee, Wis.), a supplier of warehouse man-
agement software, will incorporate in its Release 8.1 product a suite of
speech-based applications from SyVox Corporation (Boulder, Colo.;
www.syvox.com). The SyVox RxP suite of speech-based applications is
tailored for mobile workers who operate in warehouses and DCs.
Speech-based systems in action. According to Satterﬁeld, “Voice-directed
picking can slice a half-second to four-and-a-half seconds from each selec-
tion. Eliminating incorrect product picks can allow accuracy rates of 99.9%,
and maintenance costs decrease with the elimination of dedicated label
printers and handheld computers.”
“Labor productivity increases as workers hear their next location upon
conﬁrming the last completed pick,” Satterﬁeld adds. “To verify that the
picker has reached the correct location, they are often asked to read a ran-
domly assigned check digit on the slot.”
U.S. Foodservice, Inc., is using the VoiceLogistics suite of software for
pilot deployment in one of their U.S. warehouse operations, with a potential

What to Look for When Selecting a Speech-Based Solution
Adding speech systems to your warehouse opens a whole new world. Because
it is most likely an unfamiliar world, Bert Moore, director at IDAT Consult-
ing, offers these tips to make the selection process easier:
•
Understand the capabilities of speech systems; deﬁne the type of data
you need to capture.
•
Know how many words your system will need to recognize.
•
Consider the noise levels in your warehouse.
•
Ask vendors how rugged the equipment is (i.e., Will it work in a va-
riety of temperatures if needed?)
•
Match the available systems to your requirements, and then see how
they integrate with your current equipment.
The best way to narrow your selection is to determine how many words
you will need it to recognize. “That will instantly eliminate a number of po-
tential packages,” says Moore.
By clearly understanding your needs, you can research the available pack-
ages and match them up with an eye toward the future. Most importantly, he
says, “remember that one size doesn’t ﬁt all.”

rollout to six additional sites. According to Bernie Cassetori, regional opera-
tions manager, “We will increase the accuracy of our order picking, substan-
tially increase productivity in our picking operations, and eliminate data en-
try of catch weights and order status. The VoiceLogistics implementation is
speciﬁcally designed to integrate with our WMS software and will increase
productivity and optimize the use of our labor resources,” he declares.

The promises of a WMS are improved productivity, greater inventory accu-
racy, and increased velocity. The perils relate to technology complexity, bud-
get and time constraints, and operator acceptance. Nonetheless, in redesign-
ing the role of its warehouse, Canon U.S.A. successfully evaluated and
selected a WMS that met their demands and brought their inventory man-
agement technology into the twenty-ﬁrst century. Here’s how they did it.
The three rules. James J. Gordon Jr., vice president and general manager
of the logistics division at Canon U.S.A., Inc. (Lake Success, N.Y.; jgordon
@cusa.canon.com), explains that the project was guided by the following
three rules:
• Rule 1: A WMS will not make a poorly run warehouse operate efﬁ-
ciently.
• Rule 2: A perfect off-the-shelf solution does not exist.
• Rule 3: You must plan for timing and cost variances.
“In 1998 we were operating our parts support division with a ﬁve-day
turnaround on orders; our ﬁll rates were below 80%; and it was taking an av-
erage 96 hours for merchandise on the receiving dock to be available in in-
ventory,” he explained at INTERLOG2000 (Worldwide Business Research;
New York; www.wbresearch.com). Applying rule number one, he went
about addressing the management problems even before considering imple-
menting a WMS solution.
“The management techniques we put in place resulted in our on-time
shipping performance improving to 99.6%, ﬁll rates rising to 94.5%, and
putaway time falling to seven hours, from 96,” Gordon details. Inventory ac-
curacy, before the implementation of the WMS, moved to 99%.
“We had phenomenal success with that system, in which inventories

were controlled by clipboards placed on every item in the warehouse,” he
notes. “But it was time to move into the future; Canon, a high tech com-
pany, has to have a warehouse that is equally technically competent.”
The quest for a WMS. Gordon is responsible for six U.S.-owned regional
DCs, seven U.S. third party supporting warehouses, and seven non-U.S.
warehouses.
In addition, there are 14 business divisions, 9 independent subsidiaries,
4 direct retail subsidiaries, and 12 key distribution channels for which he is
responsible. The division he heads handles the logistics for the entire line of
Canon products.
Establishing the parameters. “Among the parameters we set for the ware-
house management system was that it had to be broad enough to cover the
entire spectrum of our operation, which includes pick and pack service parts
operations, case goods and pallet loads, and oversized crates and unit loads,”
Gordon details.
In addition, the system needed to be multilingual (French, English,
Spanish, and Portuguese) as the system was to be installed throughout
Canon’s facilities in the Americas. Japanese was not a requirement at the time
but has since been included.
“I also required no modiﬁcations to the system, and I wanted a turnkey
implementation because my intent was not to engage a consultant to man-
age the installation,” he shares. “I wanted my team to go through and clearly
understand the steps involved and develop that expertise of the system our-
selves. That was very necessary for our future plans to roll out installations
beyond the Americas, into Europe and the Far East.”
Project objectives. “We were looking to improve our asset management
and manpower utilization,” he explains. Improved inventory management
also was a goal, especially serial number level functionality. “We historically
had a problem controlling returned assets. As a world corporation, Canon is
not used to a leased operation, and our system was designed without these
capabilities.” Assets are never returned in Japan, he points out. “In the U.S.,
they are returned quite frequently,” he notes.
In addition, he wanted to enhance their EDI capabilities and also
wanted to create a base for the development of ERP and e-commerce ac-
tivities.
Canon’s selection process. The key was the selection of the project team.
There was a headquarters team and a ﬁeld team. Management participants
included the director of national logistics, the DC manager, and IT system
support manager. The headquarters representatives included a logistics asso-
ciate and a staff IT associate.
300

The DC operations team had a local IT coordinator, an operations su-
pervisor, and two lead warehouse operators. “The idea was to have decision
makers and those who are going to direct the users to participate in the im-
plementation process,” Gordon explains.
“Additionally, I went to the warehouse and selected a senior supervisor
as the team leader,” he continues. “The reason is that every time I asked a
difﬁcult question regarding processes and operations, the managers all
turned to one senior supervisor and asked him. So it was logical to tap him
for the leadership role.” They also involved the various stakeholders (sales,
marketing, purchasing, ﬁnance, and logistics partners) in the process.
The ﬁrst stage of vendor qualiﬁcation identiﬁed 20 potential vendors. That was
quickly reduced to ﬁve after reviewing the key criteria in the general request
for quote (RFQ). Among the criteria were WMS specialization, complete
stand-alone system, broad operations characteristics, and multimodal. “We
were not looking for a vendor who would come in and sell me a complete
supply chain execution package; we did not want to buy an ERP system,”
he reﬂects. “We required someone who was truly focused on WMS.”
They also wanted a stand-alone system so they could operate their ma-
jor warehouses independently. “We also required broad operations charac-
teristics as we wanted to maintain ﬂexibility within the logistics network so
we could blend product in the same warehouse, whether it’s moving a cam-
era, or handling a large copier,” Gordon describes.
Vendor qualiﬁcation, stage II.The ﬁve potential vendors were reduced to
just two. This was done on the basis of a very detailed RFQ, where pricing
was a very important factor. “In this particular market, prices can vary up to
$3.5-million for the same set of speciﬁcations,” he notes.
The team also considered license fee methodology (site-speciﬁc vs.
user-speciﬁc). With the multigeographic network they are managing, the
user option made more sense. Furthermore, there was a careful review of
implementation costs. “These often can run equal to the cost of the software
license,” he states. Other consideration was given to support fees, hardware
assistance, and corporate culture.
“I needed to be absolutely sure that the diverse culture we had at Canon
would be compatible with any vendor we did select,” Gordon explains.
“Our implementation team was approximately 25% Japanese and 75%
American, and we have different ways of viewing projects.”
In stage III of the multistage vendor qualiﬁcation process, the two ﬁnal-
ists submitted a complete white paper outlining all technical speciﬁcations
of their system. They were then force-ranked. “The top choice (Catalyst In-
ternational) was submitted to IT for full technical qualiﬁcation,” Gordon

explains. The key issues included interfacing to legacy systems, compatibil-
ity with future IT planning, technical competency of the vendor personnel,
and compatibility with Canon’s IT staff.
Two recommendations. In reviewing the project, Gordon emphasized
complete training, including vendor’s classroom, conference room pilot, and
on-site. “The conference room pilot is especially critical, as it will help you
understand detail functionality of the system before laying the big check on
the line, and it is an excellent way of making a ﬁnal decision.”
Additionally, do a process engineering review and document all existing
processes ﬁrst. “We did not do it before the ﬁrst installation, but are doing
it in the other facilities,” Gordon explains. “Doing the diagrams up front is
critical to avoiding some of the problems that you typically run into on a
project like this.”

Need to replace your old paper-based inventory replenishment with a new
WMS driven by bar code technology—this year? Here’s how one inventory
manager did and improved accuracy in the process. Bakery Crafts (West
Chester, Ohio), maker of edible ornaments, has had three expansions within
the past 10 years and moved into its new facility two years ago. This growth
has caused pressure on all departments of the company, and especially in the
warehouse, where up to 9,000 ﬁnished part and raw material items are stored.
“Four years ago we were not only growing, but we also had an ineffective
manual, hand-written inventory management system that was woefully inade-
quate and causing our warehouse operators great frustration,” relates Dave
Houliston, inventory manager. The operators printed out an inventory master
report daily based on manual inputs, and multiple copies were duplicated daily. 
Inaccuracies abound despite frequent inventories. The problem, quite frankly,
was that the data were at least eight hours old, and a great deal of clerical time
was needed to maintain the old system. Not surprisingly, the daily report dis-
played a record accuracy of “50% to 60%.”
Additionally, Bakery Crafts took major inventories quarterly in addition
to the annual physical inventory. The annual took at least two weeks and in-
volved some 25 individual full-time operations during that period.
Operator productivity also suffered. “With the old system, manual re-
plenishment was very time-consuming,” says Houliston. An operator had to
302
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

walk along the home pick locations and write down what was needed, go to
a warehouse map and learn where it was, ﬁnd it, and then return it to the
home pick location. “Many times when the operator got to the rack where
the material was supposed to be, it wasn’t, meaning he had to search the
warehouse,” Houliston explains. 
Making the great technological leap. Houliston conceded, “These were the
symptoms of a company that had outgrown its old paper-based system. It
was obvious we needed something better.” They opted to look for a system
that has “solid” warehouse management software and incorporates new
technology like RF and bar coding.
After conducting a thorough review of available systems to ﬁt their
needs, Houliston and his team selected the RT Locator system (RT Systems;
Ann Arbor, Mich., 734-662-7099).
“RT Systems worked with us to develop design specs and added custom
coding to the RT Locator product,” says Houliston. The solution reﬂected
how Bakery Crafts wanted to operate their warehouse. Only after thor-
oughly testing the modiﬁed system was it then installed in the new ware-
house, he mentioned.
The Bakery Crafts warehouse solution to better inventory accuracy. The ﬁnal
conﬁguration uses 12 RF handheld terminals (Intermec Technologies Cor-
poration; Everett, Wash., 425-348-2600). These operate off a single Inter-
mec control unit interfaced into the RT Locator PC installed on the Bakery
Crafts UNIX network. The company is now thinking about converting
their existing system to the newer NT network operating system.
The Bakery Crafts/RT Systems software operates on the PC and re-
sponds to the RF terminals operating in the warehouse in real time. Also,
almost all of the transactions in the warehouse now involve bar code scan-
ning “for accurate and easy data entry,” he declares.
Bar codes an integral part of the new system. All product cartons and storage
locations in the warehouse are bar coded, including pick rack, back stock lo-
cations.
“Our suppliers are mandated to include on their incoming cartons a
Bakery Crafts bar coded label,” Houliston describes. “We supply vendors in
the Orient printers and labels along with new item database updates to fa-
cilitate the bar coding of incoming material.” A bar code printer in the West
Chester warehouse replaces labels that are missing or that have been defaced.
RF tracks inventory throughout. When product is received, it is identiﬁed
and skidded, and the item number and quantity are entered into the RF ter-
minal. The skid is then put away into a rack location by a reach truck.
Warehouse Management
303

The operator scans the item number on the skid and the location label
that it is being put into. “The RT Locator keeps track of the number of car-
tons of the particular product in location,” Houliston explains. 
Pick list generation now automatic. When replenishment to the back stock
location (pick rack) is needed, it is requested by an RF terminal by scanning
the part number needed (label on back of pick racks) and the quantity.
“This creates a task that directs the stock pick operator to a particular lo-
cation to pick a speciﬁc number of cartons and deliver it to a particular back
stock area,” he describes. “The stock picker operator conﬁrms this move by
scanning the location of the back stock area.”
If an item is needed in the pick area and has just arrived on the receiv-
ing dock, the system will direct some of the received material directly to
picking without being placed into a high rack location. “Thus, we also have
cross-docking capabilities, now,” he offers.
Annual physical done in hours instead of weeks. One of the beneﬁts of the
new system is that the former two-week annual physical inventory now
takes just six hours. That’s a savings of 1,850 man-hours (92.5%) annually. 
“That part of the inventory controlled by the RT Locator system does
not have to be physically counted at the annual inventory due to its signiﬁ-
cant improvement in inventory accuracy,” maintains Houliston. “This is
possible because of the daily cycle counts we continue to do through the RT
Locator system.”
Typically, they do an aisle per day. They simply request the locations in
that aisle, and the system creates cycle count tasks for the operator. The op-
erator will then select the cycle count transaction, and he will be taken by
sequence through the aisle. Discrepancies alarm the RT Locator and are in-
vestigated by supervisors. “These daily cycle counts can be done during the
day shift while other transactions are occurring,” Houliston notes.
Operators now typically trained in just one day. The original implementation
took a “good year before warehouse personnel were able to use the new sys-
tem fully,” according to Tim Jordan, lead person in receiving. “However,
that was mainly due to our leap from a manual system to an RF one. Our
operators needed time to understand a computer system,” he explains. To-
day, a new operator is given one-day training and is “cut loose the second
day to do the replenishment activity with the handheld RF terminal with
bar code scanner,” Jordan declares.

Fifty-Four Tips for Improved
Logistics Operations 
1. Next generation advanced planning and scheduling software
reduces inventory
“To improve our competitive position and meet market demand for sustained
growth, we decided to reengineer our procedures for forecasting demand,
accepting work orders from customers, making commitment for orders, and
completing product deliveries,” describes the logistics project manager at a
large semiconductor fabricator. The project manager and her team consid-
ered a number of advanced planning and scheduling software solutions be-
fore they selected the one from Paragon Management Systems (Los Angeles).
In part, the software enabled them to improve visibility for cycle times, in-
ventory levels, and other key performance measures. In addition, it offered
intelligent routing, including product overrides for operations. “With the
new software, we have been able to improve our throughput by better man-
aging starts and product mix,” she explains. “Overall, we have been able to
reduce inventory levels signiﬁcantly, and improve cycle time by 10%.”
Managing Logistics asked logistics managers where they have made the
most cost reductions over the past year.
2. Reduced logistics-related customer service costs
Among respondents in the logistics/transportation sector, reducing cus-
tomer service costs was a critical cost control method implemented within
3 0 5

the past year. “The most successful logistics cost control idea that was im-
plemented was shipping direct from customer sites to our gateways,” ex-
plains the general manager of an international logistics company in Penn-
sylvania. “Utilization of our LTL [less-than-truckload] carrier agreements
eliminated bringing freight into each station and line hauling to the gateway.
One-year savings were approximately $60,000.”
Others took a more technological approach to customer service. For ex-
ample, the distribution manager for a California-based printing company
says that his ﬁrm developed an extranet site to provide detail on orders and
shipment status to all customers. “We have been able to reduce customer ser-
vice personnel and warehouse time tracing shipments.”
3. Reduced throughput costs into and out of warehouses
Logisticians also report success in decreasing costs associated with material
ﬂowing in and out of their warehouses. Again, those in the logistics/trans-
portation sector as well as respondents working in consumer manufactur-
ing say that this was a beneﬁcial cost control method over the past 12
months.
“We examined every process of receiving, shipping, and selecting to
identify unnecessary processes,” says the director of distribution for a retail
company. “Our team members led the effort, developed new procedures,
and implemented the results. We outsourced our freight planning to a bro-
ker. In both areas, we reduced our costs by more than 20%, and on some
routes by 50%.”
“We implemented a program to print individual box and carton labels
overseas, reducing our label costs by 60%,” explains the distribution center
(DC) planning logistics manager for a footwear distributor in North Car-
olina. “Our consolidator is also responsible for notifying factories that the la-
bels are ready, therefore giving us advance notice of production delays and
ensuring vendor compliance on packaging and labeling. This enables mer-
chandise to ﬂow through the distribution center without delay and gives our
buyers advance notice of production.”
4. Reduced order processing and communication costs
Finally, respondents told Managing Logistics that signiﬁcant savings could be
achieved by enhancing these practices. “We reduced the total cost per order
by 50% compared to our previous ﬁscal year,” shares the corporate manager
306
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

of logistics for a printing company in Kansas. “The total cost was for mate-
rial handling, receiving, inventory control and shipping.”
The warehouse manager of a large automotive parts supplier in Missouri
tells a similar story: “The primary cost control focus has been on enhancing
the order processing system not only to eliminate excessive production of
inventory but also to decrease the number of stockouts and lost sales.”
Managing Logistics asked logistics managers what technologies they have
implemented in the past year, how they are using them, and what results
they have achieved.
5. Shipping activities greatly improve with dedicated software
Logistics technology has had the greatest impact on reducing freight/trans-
portation costs and on helping to negotiate shipping rates and select new car-
riers, according to our survey. Respondents also reveal, however, that the
tools have greatly improved the overall efﬁciency of their logistics depart-
ments. For instance, the materials manager for a large high-tech ﬁrm in
South Carolina says that integrating shipping software with operations soft-
ware to forecast and predict timely shipments has resulted in more balanced
workforce requirements to order ﬂow and scheduling trucks and carrier se-
lection for meeting customer ship dates.
Another respondent shares that signiﬁcant savings have been realized
through a more efﬁcient shipping process. “Using SCOR [supply-chain op-
erations reference] methodology, we sought improvements in our customer
on-time delivery,” says the director of factor logistics at a company in North
Carolina. “We also implemented an advanced planning shipping system, re-
engineered our order management processes, and diligently pursued strate-
gic partnerships. As a result, we improved our order management costs—re-
duced 1.5% from total logistics cost—increased our schedule achievements
to 95%, and improved our supplier on-time delivery for key commodities to
93%. These overall improvements resulted in an increase in customer on-
time delivery to the high 90s.”
6. Distribution packages control inventory
Reducing inventory obsolescence, damage, and pilferage are among the
greatest challenges logistics managers say they face daily. Many indicate that
the software systems implemented this past year have made great strides in
Fifty-Four Tips for Improved Logistics Operations
307

helping them meet those challenges. “We implemented MFG Pro; now we
can truly get a handle on controlling inventory and production needs to our
customer requirements,” says a materials manager for an automotive mold-
ing company in Indiana. “Different scenarios can be played out in the sys-
tem to keep the inventory at the desired level and still monitor our suppli-
ers’ delivery performance.”
The vice president of corporate logistics for a retail home furnishings
company in New York shares, “We implemented a forecasting and distribu-
tion system requirements planning [DSRP] software package. We were able
to justify the purchase with a cost-freight analysis and payback in terms of
inventory reduction and productivity gains in product supply planning.”
The logistics pro says that a survey after the ﬁrst four months of installation
revealed that inventory reduced from 29,500 pieces at $5.1 million to 26,400
pieces at $4.1 million, with no impact on customer service level or stock-
outs.
7. Networks are easily managed through various technology tools
The Internet, intranet, and electronic data interchange (EDI) are helping
many logistics managers carry out sophisticated shipping activities. For in-
stance, the product inventory manager for an electrical supply ﬁrm in Illi-
nois says, “We serve 115 locations in 25 states. Our efforts are to reduce cycle
time from the time a branch places an order until the invoice is paid. With
the expansion of our EDI software, we can reduce time and paper.”
Modeling tools are also popular among Managing Logistics readers. Ac-
cording to the vice president of supply chain management for a pet food
company in Kansas, his ﬁrm has optimized its distribution network using the
SAILS location-modeling tool. “You have to get the network efﬁcient be-
fore you can work on reducing individual components.”
Managing Logistics asked logistics professionals what they consider their
supervisors’ greatest concerns. 
They said that exceeding the limits on customer service is an issue close to
the hearts of their supervisors, with almost 30% responding. There was just
a slight difference in what size of organization places a higher value on cus-
tomer service, as 30.6% of managers in ﬁrms with under 500 employees say
that their bosses place a great emphasis on that area, whereas 24.3% of man-
agers in companies employing over 500 people feel that way.
One of the more surprising results to come out of the survey is that lo-
308
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

gistics managers working in logistics/transportation ﬁrms say that only 10%
of bosses are overly concerned with customer service. This is a much lower
response rate than that in the industrial/manufacturing sector (23.1%) and in
the consumer manufacturing area (33%). 
Following are some of the ways in which logistics managers are tackling
the issue of improving customer service for their supervisors.
8. Improved communication with customers
Managers said that the personal touch that they can give to customers seems
to make the most difference in resolving customer issues. “We are address-
ing customer concerns by empowering our own colleagues to make inde-
pendent decisions regarding how to solve customer problems and issues,”
says the logistics manager for a pet product company in Virginia. 
“We revamped our telephone system to service customer calls on the
ﬁrst try,” says the director of fulﬁllment logistics for a personal protection de-
vice manufacturer in Pennsylvania, who reports to the company vice presi-
dent. 
“We are improving the time it takes to process customer orders by elim-
inating non-value-added steps in our process,” says the director of operations
for a model trains manufacturer in Wisconsin. “However, if we are hit with
an out-of-the-ordinary amount of orders, we cannot respond as quickly as
we’d like.”
9. Established benchmarks of customer service
Others tell us that only when they truly understand what the industry stan-
dards for ideal customer service levels are can they then rise to the occasion.
“We introduced a continuous process improvement model and benchmark
against best-in-class standards for customer satisfaction,” says the logistics
manager for a fruit-based juice company in Nevada, who reports to the plant
manager. The result has been a 184% increase in productivity in the last 12
months and a 56% reduction in labor-related costs—all without company
layoffs.
“We developed a delivery benchmark for 48 states and negotiated with
carriers to meet those service levels,” says the logistics manager for a manu-
facturer in Illinois.
The results of managers’ efforts this past year shows that 5.2% of the
companies had 8% or more customer shipment complaints; 47.7% say that
Fifty-Four Tips for Improved Logistics Operations
309

their customer shipment complaints were between 1.1% and 7.9%; and
47.1% say that customer complaints were 1% or below.
Managing Logistics asked logistics professionals which costs they have
reduced most drastically in the past year.
10. Reduced warehouse storage/inventory costs
According to the survey, almost 35% of the respondents have spent their
time reducing storage/inventory costs. The majority of these (41.6%) are in
the consumer manufacturing sector. A key similarity among respondents is
that they worked with suppliers to achieve their goal. “Our most signiﬁcant
cost control idea was eliminating dependence on outside services,” says the
purchasing manager for an agricultural components manufacturer in Wis-
consin. “We are now managing a separate facility from our current site. This
has reduced warehousing and transportation costs by $25,000 annually. This
was also achieved by working with suppliers to hold and ship inventory as
needed with no additional costs.”
“We implemented a cost-cutting strategy aimed at reducing warehouse
storage and inventory carrying,” says the director of a health care product
supplier in Illinois. The strategy he describes is a four-step process: (1) con-
solidating warehouses; (2) evaluating needed pallet space; (3) eliminating
hold time and turning inventory faster without loss of service; (4) asking sup-
pliers with bulky products to deliver just-in-time (JIT).
11. Reduced inventory carrying costs
Again, the consumer manufacturing sector shows that it spent the most time
uncovering savings associated with carrying inventory, with 29% respond-
ing. Managers reveal that while costs are cut, other beneﬁts have been
achieved as well. “We have begun implementing an improved order-to-
deliver vehicle ordering system,” explains the logistics manager for a vehicle
manufacturer. The results, he says, have been improved information gather-
ing on customer preferences, shortened order cycle times, and a pull versus
push strategy on order fulﬁllment. 
“We reduced inventory carrying costs by about 10%, which has resulted
in more storage space for other materials, such as cardboard packing and pal-
lets,” says the manager of manufacturing services for a ﬂexible packaging
company in Pennsylvania.
310
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

12. Reduced international logistics costs
Not all cost-cutting strategies were focused within the warehouse, or even
within the United States. Many say that international logistics costs were a pri-
mary focus last year. For instance, the distribution supervisor for a medical
products supplier in Minnesota explains, “We began shipping with DHL [Air-
ways] to allow our European customers to receive their product sooner. Thus,
they didn’t need to carry as much inventory. DHL had lower rates than regular
freight forwarders, and they delivered most packages in only two business days.”
“For our cargo to Russia, we manage to use a lot of shipside trucking
deliveries to save on storage and labor costs,” says the logistics specialist for
an international trading company based in Georgia. “We closely coordinate
deliveries with truckers and cold storage at wharf, saving up to 10% on stor-
age and loading costs.”
“We centralized our U.S. operation,” says the logistics senior manager
for a ﬁne jewelry distributor in New York. “We went from receiving ship-
ment from overseas to each individual location to having everything shipped
to a central location.”
Managing Logistics asked logistics professionals how prevalent
outsourcing has become to their operations within the past year.
As a means of controlling logistics costs, about 18% of all respondents are out-
sourcing various logistics activities. The industrial manufacturing sector is
making the most use of outsourcing with 20% responding, 17% in the con-
sumer group, and 18% in the logistics/transportation industry. Outsourcing
seems to be a practice that is more predominant in ﬁrms with under 500 em-
ployees (17.9% respondents) versus those with over 500 employees (15.7%).
So which non-value-added services are logistics managers outsourcing?
One logistics manager eliminated in-house messengers, saving the company
$35,000; another subleased his facility to reduce distribution expense by
30%; outsourcing forecasting and planning resulted in a $27 million savings
in less than one year for one company. Still another saved 10% in annual
freight costs by outsourcing with a freight management ﬁrm. Here are some
other examples of how managers are taking advantage of outsourcing:
13. Use contract carriers
Whenever respondents could turn over transportation activities to a third
party, they did so, resulting in signiﬁcant service improvements and savings

opportunities. “We outsourced our private ﬂeet to contract carriers,” says
the director of supply operations for a large propane company in New Jer-
sey. “We selected carriers that had an interest in rolling over our drivers into
their operation, contracting for rate consideration and forming a strong re-
lationship with us.” The vice president for a small steel processing plant in
Ohio shares a similar story: “Our outsourcing activities began with the elim-
ination of our company ﬂeet to an asset-based logistics carrier. This has in-
creased the utilization of our facility, and annualized cost savings are pro-
jected to be over $1 million.”
14. Enlist help with international shipments
Managers dealing with international shipments sought out ways to out-
source parts of that business. “We contracted a third-party surface logistics
company to manage/route and deliver all international inbound ocean and
rail containers from Brazil and Mexico to service our North American au-
tomobile manufacturers,” explains the logistics specialist for an automotive
supplier in Michigan. “This allowed us to become more ﬂexible and re-
sponsive to changing customer needs and allowed logistics personnel to fo-
cus on better inventory management and cost reduction ideas and to im-
prove communication internally with our customers.”
“Outsourcing our order fulﬁllment process for international service and
parts business to a freight forwarder has reduced expenses by $150 per year
and reduced our cycle time,” relays the manager of transportation for a man-
ufacturer of power generation equipment in Connecticut. “The forwarder
executes all activities from expediting through shipment at a ﬁxed cost per
order.”
15. Reconsider outsourced activities
Although outsourcing remains a viable option for many managers, the per-
centage of users to our survey a year ago was 24%—6% more than this year.
One reason for the decrease may be that some managers are bringing out-
sourced activities back in-house. “We decided to bring our inbound logis-
tics operations back in-house,” says the corporate director of logistics plan-
ning for a large grocery distributor in Texas. “It just did not make sense to
keep it outside the business. Even though our business partner performed to
the letter of the contract, I just felt that we could save over $1 million if we
handled the activity ourselves.”

Ocean shipping rates continue to rise. How are logistics professionals
working around this fact?
16. Renegotiated shipping rates and more
Many of the managers are learning to renegotiate ocean shipping rates like
they have traditionally done with over-the-road haulers. For many, this has
reduced freight charges signiﬁcantly. For instance, the associate director for
a chemical distributor in Hawaii says, “We renegotiated ocean shipping rates
for bulk coal from Australia to Hawaii. As a result of this, we reduced our
ocean shipping cost by $3.00 per metric ton.”
In addition to negotiating rates, some managers are forging arrange-
ments to have the ocean carrier provide more than shipping services. “We
negotiated an agreement with a vessel line to provide additional services
(free warehousing overseas) with no demurrage charges in exchange for a
large shipment,” says a trafﬁc manager from Texas. Product produced/
shipped from us to Rotterdam for clearance, transshipped to Italy (stored in
ocean containers) for several weeks, with eventual delivery to client in Italy
minimized product handling and provided needed warehouse space.”
17. Obtain discounted rates
Cost savings are also being achieved through discounted rates offered by the
carriers. “With most carriers, we carry a 65% discount on freight,” says the
shipping team leader for a company in North Carolina. “On some carriers,
we carry a discount with FAK class exception of 60, 70, and 77.5, saving our
company thousands of dollars per year.”
Discounts can also be realized through volume purchases. The trans-
portation manager for a pharmaceutical distributor in Illinois explains, “We
leveraged our buying power with other business units within the company.
We were able to reduce ocean container rates by $900 per load.”
18. Reduce costs through volume
Respondents told Managing Logistics that if they can promise to ship more
product with the ocean carrier, they will be guaranteed lower rates. Says the
transportation planning manager for a beverage company in New York,
“With regard to ocean imports, we have increased shipment yield (heavy
shipments) in containers through the use of special permits. In addition, we
Fifty-Four Tips for Improved Logistics Operations
313

are using more intermodal services by steamship companies. We estimate a
5% to 10% cost-reduction overlap.”
The operations manager for a ﬁrm in Maryland tells a similar story: “We
worked on a promise of turning inventory around within 30 days. We
worked with dealers and the customer to ship LCL [less than container load],
LTL, and air when there was not enough inventory to ship by container. We
therefore reduced demurrage costs and container storage costs and were able
to control our inventory more efﬁciently.”
19. Why did Heineken USA, Inc., win the Voluntary
Interindustry Commerce Standards Association (VICS;
www.vics.org) Best in Logistics Award?
Heineken received this prestigious award for developing innovative internal
systems dedicated to cost-effective service and supply chain improvement.
Andy Thomas (914-681-4175), vice president of operations planning at
Heineken, explained how.
What is the best logistics improvement made at Heineken in the
last year?
“We have set up a communication link with our distributors to work more
effectively with them on planning issues and forecasting. 
“We also automated a lot of our manual processes on the back end,
which has enabled us to redeploy our workforce for more value-added func-
tions. We eliminated a lot of the paper-pushing activities so that we now
have more time to be managerial instead of clerical.”
What obstacles have you faced in making these logistics
improvements?
“We had to ask our distributors to work with us in managing the supply
chain. We needed them to plan forward-looking forecasts with us and to
give us a better idea of what they would need three months out versus only
one month out. We also asked the distributors to place their orders with us
over the Internet and share information with us about inventory manage-
ment. 
“We realize that anytime there is change, there is a tendency to resist.
Fortunately, our distributors recognized the beneﬁt of these changes, such as
greater efﬁciency and improved customer service levels.”
314
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

What are the greatest beneﬁts Heineken is achieving as a result of
these logistical changes?
“By having tighter relationships with our distributors, we are able to be
more responsive, not reactive, to the market. We are working to reduce lead
times to the distributors through improved forecasting and planning, as well
as by automating some of our more labor-intensive processes.”
Other winners of the VICS awards include ShopKo Stores (920-429-
4800), Best in Retail Award for developing and implementing innovative in-
ternal systems and practices dedicated to meeting consumer demand; the

20. Using the Web to track inventory in motion
Problem: For companies like Pacaar Automotive and Lucent Technol-
ogies, freight shipping involves many people and services to
handle inventory in motion, increasing the chance of delays.
Proprietary enterprise systems fail to track inventory from
point-of-origin to destination, leaving shippers unable to track
arrivals and resulting in billions of lost dollars annually.
Solution: A Web-hosted solution servicing the international community,
developed by Passage Inc. of Seattle, provides global visibility
of current shipment status to users at any time. Shippers, con-
signees, and service providers have secure, designated access to
information about auditors, brokers, carriers, ﬁnancial agents,
tariffs, currency conversions, shipment preparation, load plan-
ning, and event tracking. Members pay for the services on a
transaction basis.
Results: 
“The software has made my job more efﬁcient and enables me
to track a package from the moment it leaves my hands to
when it reaches the receiver,” says Martha Davis, manager of
special orders with Paccar Automotive.

“Passage saves us time when dealing with multiple freight
forwarders by using one platform, rather than having to learn
multiple vendors’ proprietary software,” says Robin Franko,
trafﬁc manager with Lucent Technologies.
21. Software brings SCOR model to life for supply
chain managers
Problem:
Supply chains are being pushed beyond their performance lim-
its by rising consumer expectations for new products and ser-
vices, faster delivery, and personal attention. At the same time,
supply chains have become more complex as organizations in-
tegrate more tightly with their vendors and customers.
Solution: D-SCOR, from Gensym Corp. of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
was developed to help select the most effective supply chain
conﬁgurations, policies, and practices based on operational
data. It supports critical decisions such as make versus buy, cen-
tralized versus distributed operations, facility location, single-
versus multivendor sourcing, and best responses to changes in
the market.
Results: 
“D-SCOR has enabled us to improve our customers’ supply
chain operations,” says Koei Ohgi, general manager of Itochu
Techno-Science Corp. 
“D-SCOR promises to be an effective vehicle in analyz-
ing our client’s business problems and in helping to visualize
and improve their operations,” says Chris Holt, director of
Ernst & Young’s Accelerated Strategic Modeling Environment
for Supply Chain.
22. Establish benchmark for order visibility and customer service
Problem:
Every year, Lanier Worldwide, Inc., a private label distributor
of copiers, receives over 50,000 calls inquiring about an order.
“The cost involved in man-hours alone to take the call, re-
search the status of the order—not to mention often contact-
ing other people within the company for additional informa-
tion—added up,” says Bill Cook, Lanier’s vice president of
logistics.
316
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

Solution:
Lanier will use Provia Software’s integrated Warehouse Man-
agement System and Transportation Management System
modules, with Viaware Decision Support System, providing
the shared data of information that will reduce inventories and
operating costs by providing order visibility throughout the
organization and to customers. 
Results:
Lanier customers will be able to track the status of their orders
via the Internet. “The software will allow us to set a new
benchmark for customer service not seen in our industry,” says
Cook. “Instead of our customers having to call to inquire
about the status of an order, they will be empowered to view
all of their order information and the real-time status of their
orders.”
23. Reverse logistics for online retailer becomes more efﬁcient
Problem:
Online and catalog operations carry the highest product return
rates in the retail industry. This is exactly the situation that
Value America was facing when it decided to look for a reverse
logistics solution to handle the disposition of its returned items,
in an effort to streamline that process.
Solution:
Value America selected USF Processors, a logistics subsidiary
of USFreightways Corp., as its reverse logistics solution. USF
Processors will process and account for returned and damaged
merchandise in its returns facility in Memphis, Tennessee. 
Results:
Integration of tracing data from Value America’s return ship-
pers into USF Processors’ database for reports generation will
allow Value America to have a more cost-effective and efﬁcient
operation for returns.
24. WMS takes control of improved AS/RS
Problem:
Hamilton Sundstrand, a supplier of aerospace products,
needed a warehouse management system that would support
an automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS), which
stores 25,000 SKUs in over 80,000 locations.
Solution:
The MARC-CS warehouse management system from
MARC Systems was chosen as a more user-friendly applica-
tion over Hamilton Sundstrand’s former operating system. 
Fifty-Four Tips for Improved Logistics Operations
317

Results:
The MARC system will offer Hamilton Sundstrand better
warehouse activity control and improved interleaving capabil-
ities related to picking, putaway, and counting tasks, says Tom
Harms, Hamilton Sundstrand’s material control manager. The
system will also allow like products to be stored in the same lo-
cation, improving storage utilization and order processing.
25. Managing Logistics spoke with the president of the Council of
Logistics Management (CLM), Herb G. Johnson.
We asked about the challenges he faces as a logistics professional and about
where he thinks the industry is headed. Johnson is the executive vice presi-
dent of supply chain for Premiere Inc. (San Diego; 858-509-6386).
What are the greatest logistics challenges facing logistics
managers today, and what skills are required to meet these
challenges?
“Human resources is one of our greatest challenges. The level of talent of
those who are qualiﬁed is lean, and at the senior level positions are tough to
ﬁll. And at the lower levels, kids are coming out of university programs and
going to work for consulting companies rather than logistics ﬁrms because
they can make more money.
“Another challenge managers face is ﬁnding employees with the right
skills, as these skills have changed over the past few years. They must have
marketing experience to deal with electronic commerce and possess an un-
derstanding of technology. Everyone is ready to jump on the electronic
commerce bandwagon, but does everyone really understand how e-comm
and technology connect?”
What is the one tool that logistics managers need to do their jobs
most efﬁciently?
“The biggest tool that has helped me is a strong, creative staff. As a manager,
you can’t manage; you have to lead. Give your staff goals and provide the re-
sources to let them do their jobs. In most cases, a weak staff will lead to failure.
“In addition, make sure that this staff stays current on industry trends. I
would say that only around 15% of the logistics organizations out there pro-
vide the resources that let their employees stay current, and those are the
ﬁrms that lead the game. The rest are just followers.
318
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

“I’m not touting CLM, but trade organizations are a great way to get
the information that allows you to stay abreast of change and technology. I
am the ﬁrst to admit that trade organizations are not a panacea to solve all
problems, but they do offer an opportunity to ﬁnd out how everyone else is
handling similar issues.”
What is the one change you have made to your logistics
operation in the last year, and what have you seen as a result?
“I have been in my job for three months, and one of the best changes I have
made is bringing on well-rounded supply chain talent. They possess knowl-
edge in many areas, not just one, from order entry to distribution manage-
ment to inventory control to procurement and warehousing and transporta-
tion management. The diverse talent has made the organization more
robust.”
How are today’s top logistics managers using ﬂeet management technology,
and where is it having the greatest impact?
26. Improves customer service and ﬂeet operations
Feesers, Inc., a food service distribution company in Harrisburg, Pennsyl-
vania, is using a wireless communication system that enables the company
to maximize routing efficiency, automate Department of Transportation
(DOT) and International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA) com-
pliance, and automate the payroll process. “We are using the Fleet Advi-
sor system from Eaton Corp. [Clemmons, N.C.; 800-423-1525], which
we expect will improve our customer service and help us achieve our op-
erational goals,” says John Tighe, executive vice president and COO of
Feesers.
27. Maintains competitive advantage
When Somerset Food Service wanted to outﬁt its 23-truck ﬂeet with on-
board computers, it selected a solution from XATA Corp. (Minneapolis;
612-894-3680). According to Tim Williams, owner and CEO of Somerset,
the system allows the distributor to maintain its advantage in a highly com-
petitive industry, where meeting customer delivery expectations is signiﬁ-
cant. “We wanted better control of our ﬂeet and less hours on the delivery
Fifty-Four Tips for Improved Logistics Operations
319

route,” he says. “The XATA system allows us to make powerful decision sup-
port for the ﬂeet by automatically recording and processing driver and ve-
hicle activity.”
28. Optimizes nationwide transportation network
Lower transportation costs, decreased delivery times, and improved cus-
tomer goals are the objectives that Sugar Foods Corp. hopes to achieve with
its NetWORKS Transport solution from Manugistics Group, Inc. (Rock-
ville, Md.; 301-255-3063). The food distributor will use the solution to op-
timize transportation plans and execute outbound transportation operations
simultaneously. “Sugar Foods operates in a highly customer-focused indus-
try where both service and cost must be fully optimized,” says Jim Walsh,
vice president of information systems. “We expect this system to meet the
needs of this competitive industry.”
29. Enhances trailer tracking
Schneider National Inc. is using untethered trailer tracking—the ability to
determine and report the position and status of trailers in the absence of con-
ventional tractor or power connections—to better manage the productivity
and efﬁciency of its trailers by linking trailer location and status data directly
to its ﬂeet management and logistics systems via a satellite network from
Vantage Tracking Solutions (Dulles, Va.; 703-406-5068).
Communications and sensor technology embedded in 43,000 trailers
detects when a trailer is connected or disconnected from a tractor, if it is
loaded or empty, as well as its global positioning system (GPS) position and
a number of other status reports. “Untethered trailer tracking represents the
next major breakthrough in transportation technology,” says Don Schneider,
president of Schneider National, Inc. “We expect our trailer productivity to
improve, meaning better service to our customers.”
Dart Transit Company, a nationwide truckload carrier, will soon test the
TrackWare solution from HighwayMaster Communications Inc. (www.
highwaymaster.com). Combining GPS and wireless data transmission, Dart
expects the solution to help it receive critical information in managing its
mobile assets. “The promise of untethered trailer tracking is an opportunity
to redeﬁne how we manage trailer productivity and security,” says David
Oren, executive vice president of Dart.

We recently asked logistics managers how they reduced or controlled costs
through improved warehousing.
30. Revamped warehouse layout or moved locations
About one-third of all the logistics managers surveyed by Managing Logistics
say that redesigning their facilities and selecting new locations were their
most successful logistics cost control ideas this past year. This has resulted in
some pretty signiﬁcant savings.
Consider the case of one manager who completely changed how prod-
uct mobile electronic parts are picked in his DC. “We reengineered our dis-
tribution center layout by pulling out pallet racking and setting up pick aisles
with bucket storage, and we added a conveyorized system for improving
throughput. This resulted n a 19% increase in pallet storage and a 30% in-
crease in throughput.”
Moving the warehouse location can also make a big difference in slash-
ing costs and can possibly result in some unexpected savings. The vice pres-
ident of operations for a third-party logistics company explains how the
provider redesigned a warehouse facility for one of its customers. 
“We moved the warehousing operations out of the manufacturing site
in Waco, Texas to a stand-alone facility in Lewisville, Texas. This resulted in
improved warehouse layout, improved/lowered transportation cost, lower
labor costs, and even reduced inventory carrying tax due to new free trade
zone status.”
31. Consolidated DCs in the network
Respondents say that consolidating their distribution networks cut ware-
house labor costs sometimes in half just by eliminating redundancy in the
system. In one case, the director of materials tells how he centralized four
distribution facilities into one site, which increased output by 40% and re-
duced handling costs by 20%.
The director of operations for a consumer goods manufacturer in Ari-
zona shares a similar story: “We consolidated all return goods operations
into one location, reducing duplicate labor, on-hand inventory, and cycle
time.”
In addition to labor cost reductions, consolidation allows managers to
select sites that put them closer to their changing customer base. The
Fifty-Four Tips for Improved Logistics Operations
321

projected savings for one director of a customer care service will be $1 mil-
lion when complete.
Some managers say that they have been able to be creative in their DC
consolidation networks, as in the case of this operations manager in Oregon:
“We established a hub-and-spoke arrangement with inventory locations
centered in Portland, Oregon, to serve the Northwest. This has saved in-
ventory dollars, improved service to customers, and improved order fulﬁll-
ment activity.”
Managing Logistics asked logistics managers to explain how they will
address customers’ delivery standards in the next year.
32. Third-party provider handles transportation and logistics
Harley-Davidson, Inc., and EGL, Inc., have signed an agreement under
which EGL will provide logistics and transportation services for 65% of all
domestic motorcycle deliveries.
“We have a plan that will help us manage the costs, quality, and control
of our motorcycle delivery program,” says David Alamshah, Harley-
Davidson’s director of transportation and general manager. Harley-Davidson
also expects to beneﬁt from improved travel time, as shipments will be han-
dled by EGL, making them more time-deﬁnite in nature.
Thomson Multimedia also selected a third party to handle its trans-
portation initiatives. Schneider Logistics will handle intra–North American
shipments, outbound shipments originating throughout the world, and
global inbound shipments to North America. The ﬁve-year contract will en-
able the electronics producer to address customers’ delivery standards better,
says Dave Ruby, vice president of customer service and logistics for Thom-
son.
33. Better purchasing decisions lead to more timely deliveries
BP will deploy Aspen Technology, Inc.’s, supply chain software to manage
1,150 of its retail fueled distribution outlets in the United States. The tech-
nology will give BP the power to forecast customer demand, optimally
schedule the distribution of product, and predict demand for fuel products
on a daily basis.
The technology increases proﬁts and lowers costs by reducing opera-
322
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

tional overhead, minimizing excess inventory levels, and lowering working
capital requirements, the company claims. BP believes that its organizational
efﬁciency will improve through better purchasing decisions, locking in cus-
tomer demand, increasing utilization of transportation assets, and increasing
motor fuel proﬁtability.
34. Command center manages multiple transportation modes
John Deere will use supply chain solutions from Manugistics, Inc., to create
an intelligent global transportation network designed to maximize customer
service. A Manugistics-powered transportation command and control cen-
ter located at John Deere’s headquarters in Moline, Illinois, will help the
company manage inbound freight movements across multiple modes of
transportation.
John Deere expects to enhance signiﬁcantly product ﬂow to distribu-
tion centers, to improve the routing of multipoint freight movements, and
to enhance communication with carriers through Web-enabled collabora-
tion.
Managing Logistics asked logistics managers to identify the most
signiﬁcant shipping strategy that they plan to implement in the next year.
35. Automate multimodal shipping management
Bearing Distributors, Inc. (BDI), was looking for a system that would enable
it and its suppliers to view detailed shipment information, from status of
shipments to the contents of each package, in an effort to optimize customer
service. BDI selected the Kewill.Ship Server from Kewill Systems PLC.
“The Kewill.Ship Server will enable us to collaborate more effectively
with our global trading community, save on shipping costs, and optimize ef-
ﬁciencies throughout the supply chain—all of which are crucial to the suc-
cess of our business,” says Chris Shaffer, director of information systems at
BDI. In addition, BDI will capture enterprise-wide shipping and trans-
portation information.
The solution will enable BDI’s enterprise to automate multimodal trans-
portation and international export document processing. A main server in
Cleveland will be conﬁgured as the Web server and will run all the sites and
workstations via an Internet connection from one centralized database.

36. Convince partners to use same shipping platform
Millard Refrigerated Services, a leading refrigerated warehouse and distri-
bution company, requires a system that maintains the integrity of the unit
loads passing through its operation. The company also demands a system
that complements its strategy of building state-of-the-art DCs with sophis-
ticated logistics and transportation services and of creating a seamless pack-
age of storage, distribution, logistics, and transportation services.
The company decided that its partners needed to help maintain that
strategy by moving to the CHEP pallet pool over ﬂoor loaded, pallet ex-
changes, and slip-sheet shipping alternatives. “We believe that the CHEP
program allows us to service our customers and their customers most effec-
tively,” says Lynn Mulherin, executive vice president of Millard.
Millard’s approach is based on strict financial economics. Having a
sound product-handling platform is critical because the company takes
total responsibility for moving inventory from warehouse to destination.
For customers, risks are eliminated, costs are reduced, and resources are
maximized. For Millard, any product damaged or any productivity lost
because of poor product-handling systems comes off its bottom line.
Mulherin believes that pallet pooling reduces risks for customers and Mil-
lard.
37. Product distribution via the Web
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.’s (CCE) logistics execution involves shipping to
more than 350 distribution centers, using a combination of private ﬂeet,
common carrier, and dedicated logistics providers. Looking for a more efﬁ-
cient way to deliver beverages to its distribution centers, CCE will use the
Nistevo.com network. CCE believes that this will help reduce processing
expenses, cycle times, and inventory levels by increasing visibility through
the supply chain.
Mike McNally, vice president of operations planning and development,
says that CCE will gain real-time visibility for forecasting shipping needs us-
ing the Nistevo.com contract management, exchange, and execution sys-
tems. This will allow CCE to manage contracts online, share capacity to im-
prove asset utilization, and track in-transit goods. “We continually strive to
improve our distribution system by using solutions that beneﬁt our entire
supply chain network,” says McNally.
324
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

Managing Logistics asked logistics managers which supply chain initiatives
they have attempted in the last year or will attempt in the next 12 months.
38. Build a global, enterprise-wide supply chain 
Power tool manufacturer Black & Decker wanted to improve service to its
customers, improve asset management, and provide the ability to manage
growth. To achieve that goal, the company implemented a foundation for
global, enterprise-wide supply chain management to shorten supply chain
reaction time and ensure high customer service levels.
Black & Decker is using SAP R/3 and Manugistics’ constrained pro-
duction planning (CPP) solution. “We implemented the Manugistics solu-
tion because of the impact that it could have on our service levels and asset
management capabilities,” says Mark Dailey, vice president of supply chain
for Black & Decker Power Tools.
The solution allows Black & Decker to predict future demand and,
based on activities that occur in the marketplace (changes in customer or-
ders, projections of promotional events), readjust the supply plan on a
nightly basis. It also helps identify potential constraints in the system on the
supply base side.
39. Shift responsibility to suppliers
Moving inventory into and out of Compaq Computer Corp.’s Houston facility
was often a logistics nightmare, admits Bill Moore, Compaq’s material logistics
director. “No matter where inventory was stored, it was always in the way.”
Compaq began working closely with third-party logistics provider Cus-
tomized Transportation Inc. (CTI), which helped the computer manufac-
turer entirely reorganize its inbound supply chain operation. The company
now requires its suppliers to keep most inventory in a CTI-run facility, while
still meeting its 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week manufacturing schedule.
In doing so, Compaq is a leader in a trend that seeks to shift much of the
responsibility and risk for supply chain inventory and management from pri-
mary manufacturers to suppliers and third-party service providers.
40. Increase visibility and integrate with manufacturing
Rohm and Haas Co. selected a suite of Manugistics NetWORKS solutions
to increase visibility into its global supply chain and to project future
Fifty-Four Tips for Improved Logistics Operations
3 2 5
TEAMFLY
Team-Fly® 

customer demand accurately. The solutions are designed to provide Rohm
and Haas with real-time decision-making capabilities that continually assess
global supply chain performance and identify potential problems before they
occur.
The chemical company will also deploy an enterprise resource planning
(ERP) solution from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.). Plantel-
ligence is expected to improve the efﬁciency of Rohm and Haas’s world-
class production facilities by coordinating manufacturing operations with
their global supply chain.
Managing Logistics asked logistics managers about the efforts they plan
to take either domestically or internationally regarding inbound logistics.
41. Contract with a service provider
Tyco Healthcare, a business segment of Tyco Intl. Ltd., has contracted with
Emery Worldwide to manage its inbound freight handling, customs clear-
ance, warehouse and inventory management, and distribution of its medical
products throughout Asia Paciﬁc from a centralized logistics center in Sin-
gapore.
Tyco and Emery will jointly set up a DC and systems, explains Walter
Tarca, area controller of Asia Paciﬁc for Tyco. Emery will also ensure that
the facility meets Tyco’s standards, including temperature-controlled storage
areas, sealed ﬂoors, and robust security.
42. Centralize logistics information
Sharp Electronics Corp. will use Celarix Visibility from Celarix, Inc., to
manage its inbound domestic and international product movement by cen-
tralizing relevant purchase order and shipment information.
According to a Sharp spokesperson, customer service will be improved
via real-time shipment information: “The black holes that lead to inefﬁcient
and redundant processes will be eliminated when we use this system.”
43. Take advantage of the Internet
The HP Printers and PC Division of Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) uses
EDI and Internet capability to streamline and speed up its inbound supply
326
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

chain. It uses an ERP system to send order information via EDI to an HP or
logistics provider’s warehouse, where component inventories are held until
shipment to an assembly plant. Overall, supply chain capability has increased
HP’s ﬁll rates and reduced inventories.
44. Tie manufacturing and logistics together
Ford Motor Company will work with SynQuest, Inc., to shorten order-to-
delivery times and improve supply chain performance. Ford will leverage
SynQuest decision-support software to help control Ford’s automotive, dis-
tribution, and inventory costs. Ford expects to plan and simulate its logistics
processes to help achieve precision and reliability in supply chain and distri-
bution operations.
“We plan to use the SynQuest software to tie our manufacturing and lo-
gistics together more effectively,” says Jerry Joyce, director of Global Logis-
tics at Ford. “Our goal is to fulﬁll orders to customers faster.”
Managing Logistics asked leading logistics professionals about their most
successful method for delivering products in the past year.
45. Outsourcing inventory management
Jo-Ann Stores, Inc., needed to manage inbound seasonal and promotional
merchandise coming from Asia to its retail stores and superstores. The com-
pany chose to outsource this process to Redwood Systems, which manages
receiving, unloading, and inventory, as well as fulﬁllment services and distri-
bution.
The merchandise is then delivered on a JIT basis throughout Jo-Ann’s
retail outlet chain, which is managed by a warehouse management system
from EXE Technologies, Inc. An electronic data link between Redwood

licit proposals from freight carriers and analyze bid responses to determine
the best solution based on price, capacity commitments, and historical ser-
vice performance. Once the carrier-to-lane assignment is determined,
OptiBid generates a set of routing ﬁles for integration into Colgate-
Palmolive’s load-tendering system.
“OptiBid will enable us to secure maximum network capacity, part-
ner with the highest quality truckload motor carriers, and reduce overall
transportation costs,” says Jim Davis, director of U.S. company customer
service and logistics for Colgate-Palmolive. “The auction capabilities
provide us with the tools to generate cost-effective, service-oriented as-
signment of transportation service providers to lanes within our network
operations.”
47. Shipping directly to customers
Virtual Supply Logistics Pty Ltd. (VSL) of Australia is using DeliveryNet so-
lutions from the Descartes Systems Group Inc. to streamline the order ful-
ﬁllment process. VSL will create its own DeliveryNet using Descartes’ e-
Frame technology to connect retailers to suppliers and partners, enabling
home delivery directly from supplier facilities, accompanied by value-added
services.
“With Descartes’ e-Frame architecture, we have real-time visibility of
the movement of goods and information across our entire fulﬁllment and
value-added service network,” says Patrick Byrne, CEO of VSL. “The tech-
nology enables our clients to synchronize with their partners’ disparate sys-
tems over a neutral information network. This will enable shipment directly
from their suppliers’ warehouses, reducing the cost of delivery and increas-
ing service levels.” He adds that the VSL service will greatly reduce the num-
ber of movements within the supply chain.
Managing Logistics asked logistics managers about the order fulﬁllment
strategies that they have implemented in the last year.
48. System integration balances order and information ﬂow
“We are integrating shipping software with operations software to forecast
and predict timely shipments,” says the materials manager for a high-tech
ﬁrm in South Carolina that employs over 85,000 people. “This has allowed
328
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

us to balance workforce requirements to order ﬂow and to schedule
trucks—all meant to ensure that we meet our customer ship dates.”
49. Work closely with manufacturing to schedule production
“We are using intermodal transportation to our centralized distribution cen-
ters,” explains a trafﬁc manager for a small food product producer in Ore-
gon. “This allows our production facility to manufacture on a schedule ver-
sus a ‘knee-jerk’ reaction to customer orders and short delivery windows.”
He says that overall savings are on track to garner between $300,000 and
$400,000 per year on transportation alone.
50. Overhaul systems and processes
“We sought improvements in our customer on-time delivery by imple-
menting an automated replenishment system, reengineering our order man-
agement processes, and diligently pursuing strategic partnerships,” says the
director of factory logistics for a compact disc manufacturer. “As a result, we
improved our order management costs [reduced 1.5% from total logistics
costs], increased our schedule achievements to 95%, and improved our sup-
plier on-time delivery for key commodities to 93%. These overall improve-
ments resulted in an increase in customer on-time delivery to the high-90th
percentile.”
New technology was also the answer for a ﬁrm in New Jersey, says the
vice president of operations. “We instituted a new order fulﬁllment system
into 11 of 20 distribution centers. This has reduced head count by almost
10%.” The idea, he explains, was to increase the service levels and cutoff time
for shipping orders.
51. Make online fulﬁllment as good as in-store fulﬁllment
According to Michael Sanders, COO of LearningExpress.com, an online
toy retailer, Web-based fulﬁllment is viewed as an increasingly efﬁcient and
critical link in delivering a winning on-line shopping experience. So when
Learning Express (Ayer, Mass.) wanted to put its retail business on the In-
ternet earlier this year, it sought a solution that would manage the fulﬁllment
process from procurement to transportation. Sanders expects the NEXstep
(Plano, Texas) solution to give online customers the same service “they’ve
come to expect from our retail stores.”
Fifty-Four Tips for Improved Logistics Operations

Managing Logistics recently asked logistics professionals how they are
using supply chain management software and what impact it has had on
their operations.
52. Streamline order fulﬁllment
Problem:
Service Merchandise Company, Inc., a retailer of ﬁne jewelry
and home lifestyle products, worked on an inﬂexible main-
frame warehouse application that produced paper-based pro-
cesses and required more human attention.
Solution:
The company is now deploying the Optum SCE Series soft-
ware in its three forward-serving distribution centers to sup-
port demand-driven replenishment across the supply chain.
The Optum solution will automate complex material handling
at the DCs, minimizing the number of human touches re-
quired to fulﬁll orders and accelerating the ﬂow of merchan-
dise.
Results:
Service Merchandise will gain tighter control of its orders, in-
ventory, and assets. In addition, the software is expected to bet-
ter control costs.
53. Improve customer responsiveness
Problem:
Customers of Roseburg Forest Products Company wanted the
supplier to have systems and logistics capabilities to respond
quickly to their changing needs.
Solution:
Roseburg will use the TriStar 2000 decision support tool that
will enable its logistics managers to consider simultaneously
the impact of raw materials, product mix, and production efﬁ-
ciency on operational scheduling, product pricing, and market
opportunities. TriStar gives managers the information to get
the right product to the customer and to do so on schedule and
proﬁtably.
Results:
“Our mills can operate as one to achieve the best response to
market demands,” says the company president. “With TriStar
2000, Roseburg can analyze opportunities across the entire
supply chain to identify leverage points, alternative strategies,
and opportunities to improve customer service and respon-
siveness.”

54. Facilitate supplier collaboration
Problem:
Furniture retailer Heilig-Meyers was looking for a way to im-
prove the ﬂow of product and enhance communications with
its largest suppliers.
Solution:
Heilig-Meyers, which operates over 900 stores in the United
States and Puerto Rico, will use the Manugistics NetWORKS
solutions to improve inventory forecasting and replenishment.
Results:
As part of a newly designed supply chain process, the solution
will foster integration along the supply chain, from consumers
to raw material suppliers.

The top 10 ways to reduce warehousing costs.
Consulting ﬁrm Herbert W.
Davis (201-944-5580; www.hwdco.com) suggests the following for cutting
your warehouse expenses: (1) examine receiving and shipping schedules and
vary stafﬁng to match the ﬂuctuating workload; (2) monitor, benchmark,
and improve the work pace by type of activity; (3) balance the use of over-
time and temporary help to handle month-end and seasonal workloads;
(4) relocate all slow-moving inventory to the side and concentrate activity
(and travel) in a smaller area; (5) evaluate the feasibility of outsourcing
all or part of the operation; (6) identify and evaluate the layout and material
handling equipment capabilities and limitations; (7) measure cost and
volumes of nonroutine warehouse functions and look for improvements;
(8) use automated material handling equipment when appropriate and only
when appropriate for current workload; (9) monitor and replace unreliable
equipment to avoid work interruptions and high maintenance costs; and
(10) review and adjust wage levels on a regional, as well as an industry-wide,
basis.

Access to third-party providers not important to logisticians.
How large a role do
third-party logistics play in the Internet-enabled business world? When
Zona Research, Inc. (Redwood Shores, Calif.), asked this question to logis-
tics managers, more than 4 in 10 respondents rated it as unimportant or not
at all important. Only in very large enterprises (over 2,500 employees) and
in medium-sized organizations with annual sales of $10 million to $99.9 mil-
lion was this an important factor. Thus, researchers conclude that access to
such providers increases in importance once one reaches very large ﬁrms
with considerable sales or higher levels in the corporate executive chain.
A performance link between customers and the organization.
Research from
Michigan State about today’s supply chains shows that customer integration
and internal integration are the most signiﬁcant differentiators of overall per-
formance on the network. Accordingly, managers seeking to leverage logis-
tics and supply chain processes to enhance performance should focus on
identifying current and future supply chains needs of key customers and then
develop an effective fulﬁllment and replenishment process to satisfy those
needs.
Not being a true supply chain partner can yield nothing but failure.
The world’s
most proﬁtable supply chains revolve around process-based relationships
that integrate suppliers throughout the product’s life cycle, according to a re-
port from Best Practices, LLC. Managers who overlook the partner aspect
of a supply chain relationship consistently yield lower proﬁt margins due to
higher processing errors and supply costs. Best Practices in Supply Chain Part-
nership and Certiﬁcation, available online at www.BenchmarkingReports.
com, reveals how top companies have improved supplier certiﬁcation and
partnerships to cut lead times and inventory by more than 50% and boast
100% elimination of processing errors and paperwork. The study contains
detailed analysis of how benchmarked companies align with suppliers to
meet supply chain improvement goals. For more information, contact Adam
Bianchi at 919-403-0251.
Avoiding the perils of home delivery.
Boston-based AMR Research, Inc., es-
timates that a total of $60 billion to $70 billion of goods will be shipped
through home delivery channels by the end of this year. While a wide range
of delivery services is available to merchants, the crucial issue is not how
products are shipped but what is shipped. Order fulﬁllment is the critical link
New Logistics Products and Services
333

and the last impression between a merchant and a customer, ensuring cus-
tomer satisfaction and brand loyalty. “In order to be proﬁtable, companies
need to offer enough products with high delivery margins,” says Chris New-
ton, senior analyst for Supply Chain Strategies. “Yet in order to be compet-
itive, companies also need to offer a mix of products that may include some
lower-margin items attracting a broader audience to their site.” AMR’s Re-
port on Supply Chain Management recommends suggestions for merchants to
make home delivery a win-win situation for both merchants and consumers:
Offer a product line that can be proﬁtably delivered through a home deliv-
ery channel; do not allow marketing alone to drive a home delivery strategy;
carefully choose delivery partners; and make sure that only the best cus-
tomers get free shipping, as it is a privilege, not a consumer right. For more
information, contact Janelle Carlino of AMR Research (617-574-5217;
jcarlino@amrresearch.com).
The Internet powers the growth of outsourcing.
Parallel growth rates between
the Internet and companies that outsource manufacturing and other in-
house activities are no coincidence, according to Paul Tasner, vice president
of OM2, a California-based outsourcing management company, who spoke
at a summit conference of midmarket CEOs. “Web-based e-business tools
allow companies to keep a close eye on increasing varieties of functions that
are normally outsourced,” Tasner said. “Now manufacturing processes are
visible via the Web, and companies can maintain real-time control of supply
chain functions, even when these activities are totally outsourced.” Contact:
Paul Tasner (510-595-2302; ptasner@OM2.net).
10 ways to reduce customer service costs.
Consulting ﬁrm Herbert W. Davis
(201-944-5580; www.hwdco.com) recommends the following as successful
ways to cut customer service costs: (1) document the correct methods to
handle a transaction the right way the ﬁrst time; (2) reexamine and eliminate
the need for document retention whenever possible; (3) review, benchmark,
and improve the methods and practices and work pace in each major func-
tional area; (4) monitor hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal work-
loads and staff accordingly, using overtime and temporary help in the best
way; (5) implement state-of-the-art telephone routing and monitoring sys-
tems; (6) eliminate handwritten notes and fax-based data entry; (7) improve
product availability to reduce inquiries and expediting; (8) consolidate mul-
tiple ofﬁces and eliminate duplication; (9) reduce the number of calls by

training your people to be the best at handling calls; and (10) evaluate the
feasibility of outsourcing all or part of the operation.

Survey reveals slow uptake of Internet-based supply chain by European organiza-
tions.
The survey conducted by Datamonitor on behalf of PeopleSoft
asked 200 key business leaders for their views about e-commerce. More than
60% said that their business contacts were not actively interested in online
trading. Overall results show that just 1% of respondents said that they were
getting requests from more than 91% of their partners, suppliers, and cus-
tomers for online trading, while less than 6% said that half of their busi-
ness contacts were interested in e-commerce. Contact: PeopleSoft (+31

interest, openness, mutual help, clear expectation, leadership, cooperation,
trust, beneﬁt sharing, and technology were identiﬁed as key enablers. Ben-
eﬁts include reduced inventory, improved customer service, better delivery
through reduced cycle times, stronger focus on core competencies, en-
hanced public image, improved shareholder value, and competitive advan-
tage over other supply chains. 
Online exchange responds to shippers’ demand for classiﬁed section.
Transporta-
tion.com has introduced Classiﬁeds, a service identiﬁed as an industry need
by customers. The service provides the transportation community with a
tool to buy and sell new and used industry equipment and allows members
to post and set a selling price directly on the site. Buyers can search equip-
ment listings by category and other criteria, review details, and select pur-
chases by notifying the seller directly. For more information, call 913-906-
6868 or visit www.transportation.com.
No link between superior logistics and competitive advantage can be found.
That is
the consensus from a recent study from Michigan State on supply chain
competencies. The research provides support for the fact that superior
supply chain performance will be the reward for high achievement across
several key competencies, such as customer integration, internal integration,
relationship integration, technology/planning integration, measurement in-
tegration, and supplier integration. 
Savvy managers should evaluate suppliers beyond traditional considerations.
Ac-
cording to Best Practices, LLC, logistics managers should forge valuable sup-
plier partnerships by evaluating them beyond cost-per-unit considerations.
Detailed analysis should focus on material quality, supplier responsiveness,
and communication costs within the total cost of procurement. Other key
drivers of supply chain management success include employing technology
to improve supplier partnerships; supply chain software and extranets for or-
der fulﬁllment accuracy; and certiﬁcation of suppliers. Contact Dan Calla-
han of Best Practices, LLC, at 919-403-0251.

Do companies want real-time supply chain management solutions? 
According to
the Zona Virtual Logistics study, when asked to rate the importance of real-
time monitoring and exception-based alerts in their organization’s Internet-
based supply chain management solution, respondents gave an evenly par-
titioned response. About one-third found such a feature of little or no
importance; one-third were neutral; and another third found them to be ei-
ther important or extremely important. Zona also noted that the responses
showed no preference toward a particular size company, whether sorted by
employee numbers or revenues; nor was there a tendency for respondents of
particular levels within the organization to respond in a certain way. Con-
tact: Zona Research, Inc. (650-298-4042).
10 ways to reduce inventory costs.
Consulting ﬁrm Herbert W. Davis (201-
944-5580; www.hwdco.com) recommends the following as successful ways
to cut inventory costs: (1) identify obsolete inventory, sell it, and take steps
to avoid making more; (2) identify slow-moving inventory; (3) identify ob-
solete inventory and centralize slow-moving inventory to one or two loca-
tions; (4) periodically conduct a formal slotting analysis to save labor and
space costs of carrying inventory; (5) adjust safety stock levels often to sup-
port ﬁll rates by class of product; (6) audit and update lead times, lot sizes,
and economic order quantities (EOQs) in your inventory planning system;
(7) improve returns processing to reclaim or dispose of returned merchan-
dise as soon as possible; (8) implement a plant shipping option to bypass the
warehouse network where economical; (9) store more common product in
bulk, boxing and labeling at the distribution center (DC) just prior to ship-
ment; and (10) conduct a geographic analysis of sales by item to focus on
managing regional and seasonal items.
Speed, not salary, is a big factor in hiring candidates.
According to a study by
Lucas Group (Atlanta, Ga.; 770-565-5440), making a fast decision about
New Logistics Products and Services
337

hiring an employee is more important than any other factor in the decision-
making process. “While employers ponder hiring decisions, they lose op-
portunities,” says Cathy deMartino, vice president of Lucas Group. Today,
72% of the time a candidate is hired within six weeks of a position’s avail-
ability; just ﬁve years ago, the process took three months. The study also
identiﬁed some recruitment enticements that managers are offering to po-
tential employees: stock options, signing bonuses, paid vacation to an exotic
location before starting the job, relocation and job placement for a ﬁancé or
ﬁancée, afternoon telecommuting opportunity, six weeks of vacation, stay-
on bonuses, and the opportunity to become a part-owner if the candidate
stays two years.
Tracking system should help out in holiday season.
ShipXact.com (www.
shipxact.com), an e-fulﬁllment company serving Web-based logistics and
fulﬁllment markets, introduced TrackXact, a technology that provides real-
time receipts, inventory, and shipment information. The system integrates
handheld bar code scanners with ShipXact’s DC systems. These systems are
interconnected with services provided by FedEx, UPS, and other delivery
systems. To support merchants, ShipXact maintains a complete data center
and 225,000-square-foot warehouse in the Atlanta area. An enterprise sys-
tem provides the technology infrastructure to support Web-based ordering,
warehousing, inventory management, and package tracking information.

Global e-commerce will crush today’s supply chains.
According to two recent
reports from Forrester Research, Inc., the high variability in global demand
will force both manufacturers and shippers to harness the Internet and cre-
ate an information pipeline, weeding out today’s weak supply chain links.
Forrester believes that companies will thrive in the Internet economy by
participating in e-business networks, structures of interdependent players
cooperating in real time over the Net. The ﬁrst step for manufacturers will
be to build manufacturing networks, rather than focusing on supply chains.
“Global supply chains are further hampered by today’s logistics processes,
which barely support the task at hand, preventing shippers from handling
many more customers,” says Stacie McCullough Kilgore, senior analyst at
Forrester. Contact: 617-613-6025.

Business-to-business (B2B) exchanges are not so important to the logistics commu-
nity.
According to Zona Research, Inc.’s, recent report, Virtual Logistics:
Exchange Services and Fulﬁllment in Electronic Supply Chain Management
(eSCM), enterprises are focused on cost savings rather than linking to B2B
exchanges. Other signiﬁcant ﬁndings in the report include the following:
66% of companies state that increasing customer satisfaction is the primary
reason to implement eSCM; 15% say that linking to B2B exchanges was a
reason for implementing eSCM; 60% say that recapturing their eSCM in-
vestment would take at least two years, with 20% saying they would never
recapture the investment. The report is available for $895 for a single user,
$1,395 for a multiuser edition, and $1,895 for enterprise-wide distribution.

10 ways to reduce transportation costs.
Consulting ﬁrm Herbert W. Davis
(www.hwdco.com) recommends the following as successful ways to cut
freight costs: (1) conduct annual rate negotiations with carriers using bench-
marking, volume, and leverage; (2) monitor compliance using preferred
carrier routing guides and follow up on exceptions; (3) study backorders
for improvement opportunities in economic shipment sizes; (4) monitor
and control error and damage rates, including return freight; (5) analyze
shipping network every one to two years to keep it optimum for current
business; (6) monitor and control inventory deployment to minimize out-
of-area shipping; (7) reduce excess inventory that causes the use of outside
storage with extra transportation; (8) reexamine and update the rules for
mode selection, as well as carrier selection; (9) plan to combine orders where
advantageous truckload rates can be used; (10) use your database of freight
bills to create a top-level overview of transportation and look for changes.

Supply chains are risky business.
At a recent Risk and Insurance Management
Society, Inc. (RIMS), annual conference, Ellen Pfeiffer, business risk man-
ager for Palo Alto, California–based Hewlett-Packard Company, identiﬁed
the risks associated with supply chain management. One is maintaining the
supply and continuous availability of products and the possible domino ef-
fect if one link fails. Overseas units and suppliers pose another threat, as they
are subject to political, credit, and foreign exchange risks. Other risks in-
clude technology, such as the Internet; increased global competition, which
gives competitors access to a company’s products worldwide; and the con-
vergence of risks into one key resource, again the Internet. 
Network optimization via secure Internet portals.
Global Logistics Technol-
ogies, Inc. (G-Log; Shelton, Conn.), a provider of Internet-based logistics

fund, have formed SupplyLinks, Inc. The new company is an Internet-based
B2B global supply chain network that links customers to multiple trans-
portation modes and service providers. Its mission is to enable manufactur-
ers, retailers, and distributors to manage their supply chain processes by op-
timizing transportation routing, fulﬁllment, and landed cost of ﬁnished
goods, parts, and components. Contact: 877 G0-2-GLOG or 203-225-

Web procurement provides one-to-one networking capabilities.
According to
Zona Research, Inc., of Redwood City, California (650-298-4000), Web
procurement solutions that provide one-to-one networking capabilities can
beneﬁt users by providing long-term relationships that streamline the e-
procurement process. In a one-to-one model, a company is allowed greater
freedom to focus its energies on core business processes. This is beneﬁcial to
small ﬁrms that may not generate sufﬁcient e-procurement volume to jus-
tify a many-to-many marketplace, and to large enterprises to help develop
favored customer status with suppliers and negotiate volume discounts.

Tektronix logistics manager uses third-party providers to gather benchmarking data.
“When I need assistance, I often go back to my third party providers to help
me get benchmark data,” reveals Lorraine Lesher, logistics commodity man-
ager at Tektronix, Inc. (Beaverton, Ore.; lorraine.lesher@tek.com). “We
outsource within the logistics organization such functions as interplant ﬂeet
movement, receiving, freight payment, claims, and all transportation move-
ment. All these different providers are really an extension of our logistics or-
ganization, so it’s important to go and talk with them ﬁrst when about to
benchmark,” she explained at a recent Proven Performance Metrics in Logistics
conference (sponsored by the Institute for International Research; New
York). “If you have your business partner working with you to help you
evaluate your organization, you’ll be a lot more successful in ensuring what
areas you want to address and change.”
Advanced planning and scheduling systems can help reduce inventory.
Inventory
reduction has long been the classic justiﬁcation for a new planning system,
including MRP, ERP, and now Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS),
argues John Bermudez, group director of supply chain management at
AMR Research, Inc. (Boston; jbermudez@admfg.com). Although no spe-
ciﬁc function in APS reduces inventory, he explains in The Report on Supply
Chain Management (“Supply Chain Planning: Where Do You Start?”), it can
help (1) reduce inventory carried to cover long-term planned horizons and
planning cycle periods; (2) reduce just-in-case inventory with more precise,
synchronized material planning; (3) shorten manufacturing cycle time by
synchronizing material arrivals with resource availability; (4) improve in-
ventory deployment throughout the supply chain; and (5) more accurately
match safety stock to customer service level requirements.

Creating “tight” pallet speciﬁcations to deter product theft.
Bruce Cutler, direc-
tor of logistics operations at Compaq Computer Corporation (Houston;
281-514-1453), recommends developing a series of pallet speciﬁcations to
avoid product damage and theft while maintaining pallet integrity and facil-
itating ﬂow through the channel. “Our complete pallet speciﬁcations serve
multiple purposes,” he explained at a Proven Performance Metrics in Logis-
tics conference. The detailed specs: (1) Ease receipt at the customer site
through dimensional control; (2) deter theft by specifying proper wrapping
and banding procedures to make carton removal difﬁcult; and (3) avoid
product/package damage though the establishment of stacking standards.
Develop your own WMS troubleshooting guide.
“A warehouse management
system troubleshooting guide explains the possible cause, simple diagnostic
tests, and recommended solutions,” explains Catherine Cooper of the Pro-
gress Group (Albuquerque, N.M.). “It provides quick reference to common
problems with bar code scanners, terminals, software, and other elements of
the system.” Many WMS implementations do not have one because imple-
mentation teams generally do not have the time or resources to create them,
she explains in IIR Solutions. However, she recommends, “The daunting
task is accomplished by designating a spiral notebook as the troubleshooting
guide at the beginning of the project. Team members should then be en-
couraged to record, in simple language, frequently encountered problems
and how they were resolved.” The guide then exists as a living document,
being updated on an ongoing basis.
Shipping company offers customized Web pages.
APL has introduced HomePort,
a customizable Web page that enables APL customers to oversee the informa-
tion and transactions critical to container management and logistics. Available
to APL clients through the company’s web site (www.apl.com), HomePort al-
lows customers to tailor the content and layout of their page to satisfy their spe-
ciﬁc business objectives. The site also streamlines logistics management by
centralizing the resources integral to tracking and managing container distri-
bution—shipment summaries, bookings, bills of lading, schedules, and vessel
tracking. APL recently completed beta testing HomePort with Boeing,
Cargill, and Sony, and the company claims that the clients saw an immediate
difference in their ability to retrieve information and conduct transactions.
Is your supply chain world class? 
Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting)
has unveiled a diagnostic tool called the Supply Chain Value Assessment,
358
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

which uses the Internet to clarify options and decisions about procurement,
manufacturing, product development, and distribution that can adversely
impact a company’s bottom line if not managed proactively. The tool allows
clients to use a Web-enabled self-assessment tool that is analyzed and re-
turned in less than 72 hours and later links that information with the results
gathered by Accenture. According to Accenture, Supply Chain Value As-
sessment will help companies quickly weigh the costs and beneﬁts of crucial
supply chain issues, from transportation outsourcing to purchasing IT sys-
tems. For information, contact John Patterson at 212-614-4769.
Guidelines establish safer use of pallets and containers.
The National Wooden
Pallet and Container Association (NWPCA; Arlington, Va.; 703-527-7667)
has developed national guidelines for pallet and container owners to help
them protect their assets and reduce the loss of proprietary pallets and con-
tainers. The guidelines are designed to help users get their pallets and con-
tainers back for reuse, which lowers costs. The guidelines suggest that own-
ers have these four components in place, register them with NWPCA, and
actively use them: (1) notiﬁcation—the owner should inform customers and
handlers of the ownership and that the owner intends to retrieve the pallets
and prohibit unauthorized use; (2) distinctive markings—the owner should
clearly identify its ownership on the pallet in distinctive markings; (3) track-
ing—the owner should have a system in place to keep track of each pallet;
and (4) retrieval—the owner should have a system in place to gather pallets
and containers that go astray. The NWPCA is ﬁnalizing a national registry
database where pallet and container owners will be able to register their pro-
prietary pallet and container claims.
Catalog of publications is available from the WERC.

CLM makes it easier to ﬁnd a job.
Logistics managers looking for new posi-
tions should consider the CLM’s Employment Clearinghouse service. If you
are a CLM member, send two unfolded copies of your resumes—on white
paper stock that will copy well and that is not more than two pages in
length—to the Council’s executive ofﬁce: 2805 Butterﬁeld Road, Suite
200, Oak Brook, IL 60523. You may include a cover letter and specify any
companies to which the resume should not be sent. If you use the clearing-
house service, you are required to let the CLM ofﬁce know before the end
of each month whether to keep the resume in the “active” ﬁle.
Common thread among U.S. and European logisticians.
A survey conducted by
European Logistics and Supply Chain Management (ELSCM) reveals that
European logistics managers are facing very similar issues to their American
counterparts. According to the survey, logisticians across Europe indicate
that EDI, e-commerce, supply chain management, planning and forecasting
methods, and modeling and simulation are among the technologies that
they expect will lead them into the next millennium. For more information,

How to survive a merger or acquisition.
If your company is among thousands of
others that have undergone a merger or acquisition, chances are that the
supply chain was impacted. The spring 1999 issue of Supply Chain Manage-
ment Review details four steps that help to overcome the impact of a merger
or acquisition and get your supply chain to the level of integration you are
seeking. Basically, it all boils down to setting up teams to oversee the integra-
tion, setting a strategic framework, testing alternatives and choosing a strat-
egy, and bringing people and resources together to make the change happen.
Supply chains lag in importance among manufacturing community.
Although
91% of North American manufacturers view supply chain management as
critical or very important, only 2% of those surveyed ranked their supply
chains as world class, according to a report from Deloitte Consulting (New
York). Despite their continued investments and increased emphasis on
supply chain management, manufacturers are not satisﬁed with the perfor-
mance of their supply chain. In fact, almost three-fourths of respondents rate
360
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

their supply chain performance as only average or below average. The gap
stems from the slow adoption of a supply chain strategy. Nearly 50% of the
companies said that they do not have a formal plan in place to address the is-
sue. Many have also launched isolated supply chain initiatives that prohibit
them from reaching world-class performance levels.
Small ﬁrms get an electronic helping hand with their build-to-order (BTO) efforts.
Targeting the weakest links in the supply chain, a consortium headed by
Electronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS; Plano, Texas) is developing a Web-
enabled system to bolster BTO efforts. The idea is to help small companies
that are unable to support expensive electronic links to their partners
strengthen their supply chain ties and improve their BTO strategy. EDS will
integrate a customer’s enterprise resource planning system with an advanced
planning and scheduling system from Paragon Management Systems Inc. of
Los Angeles.
WERC tracks facility trends.
The WERC (630-990-0001) reports on the
activities of warehousing executives in the past year. Some of the key mes-
sages: the trend toward fewer, but larger facilities; a shift away from the use
of third-party warehouses; and the fact that company growth is the reason
why many respondents change or alter distribution networks.

The seven steps toward strategic supply chain management.
Peter E. O’Reilly,
CPM, assistant vice president of MetLife (New York, 212-578-2470), spells
out his formula for attaining strategic supply chain management: (1) Invite
suppliers to participate in focus group sessions on supply chain management
for customers; (2) conduct workshops for suppliers to explain to customers
new products and services or new ways of using existing products and ser-
vices more effectively; (3) work with suppliers and customers to install elec-
tronic commerce systems; (4) allow customers to participate in supplier per-
formance evaluations; (5) encourage suppliers to recommend best practices
to supply chain management; (6) integrate suppliers and customers into the
SCM strategic planning process; and (7) develop pilot programs to introduce
suppliers’ new concepts to customers at an earlier stage than normal.

demonstrates proper pallet handling techniques. Three main points are
highlighted: (1) Use only “safe” pallets—pallets designed to carry the weight
of your speciﬁc unit load properly and safely; (2) coupled with proper de-
sign, quality construction and repair standards will prevent problems; and (3)
do not build or repair your own pallets. A copy of the video may be ordered

According to information
from Mercer Management Consulting, more than 1,000 companies in
North America consider themselves logistics providers, yet fewer than 1%
can offer complete logistics services. The future of the logistics industry be-
364
L O G I S T I C S  M A N A G E M E N T

longs to companies that can integrate four aspects of logistics services: tradi-
tional services, including cargo consolidation and carrier management; in-
formation technology, including tracking and tracking of goods in transit;
supply chain consulting, including advising users on the beneﬁts of supply
chain management; and product conﬁguration, which helps clients cus-
tomize products. Mercer’s conclusions were based on interviews with 18
leading service providers.

In a move to provide busi-
nesses an economical way to ship products to residential markets, Airborne

Six steps of a successful third-party provider selection.
According to Charles
Watts of John Carroll University (Cleveland), speaking at a Congress for
Progress (Mid-Atlantic Chapters of APICS), success is improved by (1) get-
ting a third-party provider’s assistance in developing requirements; (2) keep-
ing the request for proposal open for general improvements, but not how
you want these areas addressed; (3) making sure you have narrowed the list
to two to three providers by the RFP stage; (4) making sure the RFP in-
cludes current conditions and an indication of how things will change in the
future; (5) giving the provider plenty of time to respond to the proposal (a
minimum of two weeks); and (6) ﬁnding out who the provider’s project
leader will be during start-up and ongoing operation.

Studies unveil potential of supply chain management and ERP markets.
The lat-
est report from AMR Research Inc. of Boston (617-574-5217) shows that
the supply chain management market is predicted to have a 48% compound
annual growth rate in the next ﬁve years, with revenue reaching $18.6 bil-
lion by 2003. The supply chain management market is expected to evolve as
leading ERP vendors extend offerings in this area. The growth will be fu-
eled also by companies seeking a higher return on their ERP investment by
adding more robust, real-time, supply chain decision-making tools. This
explains why many companies investing in ERP systems to date have failed
to achieve their business goals, according to a report from the Concours
Group of Kingwood, Texas. The integration shortfalls relate to a lack of
managerial, organizational, and technical cohesiveness. Call the Concours
Group at 281-359-3464 or e-mail Concours@ConcoursGroup.com for its

Inventory Reduction Strategies
Insights from the Pros

IR
Inventory management remains the critical concern of organizations as they
plan their e-business futures. Excess inventory, inventory record accuracy,
and inventory velocity are still at the fore when discussing e-solution imple-
mentations and technology developments. This has been evident at recent
American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) Annual In-
ternational Conferences (www.apics.org), where leading authorities and
practitioners address the inventory issue squarely.
Corporate executives keep pushing the inventory reduction hot button.
A plurality (26%) of Inventory Reduction Report reader survey respondents say
that inventory reduction is the major concern of their superiors. Although
top management sets reduction goals and objectives, however, it has no clue
how it is to be done. According to James M. Masters of MIT (Cambridge,
Mass.; masters@mit.edu), who spoke at a recent APICS forum, manage-
ments typically respond that “we’re going to hire real good people and
they’ll ﬁgure out how to do it.”
Similarly, Masters and Bernard J. La Londe of Ohio State (Columbus;
lalonde.3@osu.edu) surveyed members of the Council of Logistics Manage-
ment (CLM). The respondents listed inventory reduction as a top priority. In
fact, their goal is to double inventory turns. “We’re not talking about working
around the edges, cleaning up a few minor areas,” Masters observes. “How can
you cut your inventory in half without cutting yourself off at the knees?”
387

The Hottest Ideas
Sessions that drew the largest crowds at recent APICS annual conferences
provide several inventory reduction insights for inventory managers to con-
sider.
Inventory tracking will be the critical success factor for cybereconomy companies.
Gerald L. Kilty, CPIM, CIRM, president and founder of Quality Manage-
ment Solutions, Inc. (Clearwater, Fla.), notes that “corporate intranets are
being created, providing instant information dissemination and new ways of
internal collaboration for both the managers and employees.” He also notes
that companies are “‘wiring’ themselves to their customers and suppliers,
creating alliances within the supply chain never before imagined.” What this
means is that inventory is now “visible” to customers, suppliers, and em-
ployees alike. Therefore, Kilty expresses, “If your inventories are going to
be visible to your customers and your suppliers, for the walls of the supply
chain to tumble, accuracy is at the core.”
Many enterprise resource planning (ERP) and manufacturing resource
planning (MRP) systems have not been “overwhelmingly successful” due
to data integrity, he observes. “Therefore, it seems to me, the necessity to
focus on this subject is now even more important than ever,” he advises. Ac-
cordingly, he recommends implementing cycle counting procedures.
“I believe that there are three levels of cycle counting,” he offers. Level
one can be described as “count and adjust.” Many companies, he observes,
“never are able to proceed past this level.” The issue with cycle counting
with many companies is that they are stretching out the process of an an-
nual physical inventory to be a continuous year-round event, and therefore
are missing the concept of cycle counting—that is, the element of investi-
gating the cause of an inventory record error at the time of cycle counting
and correcting the cause at that time, reducing the reasons why a record is
wrong.
Level two exists when investigative cause-and-effect activity pursues
root causes of why inventory records are wrong. Kilty refers to this as a
“quick ﬁx” program. The key to this approach is to select a manageable
sample to count and periodically (weekly) to count the same sample until it
is 100% correct.
Level three of cycle counting is the process of maintaining inventory ac-
curacy over a sustained period of time. “It assumes the level of accuracy is
already at 98%,” he states. The most popular method of maintaining a high
388
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

level of inventory accuracy is to establish a daily count frequency that allows
for counting A items 12 times a year, B items 4 times, and C items twice a
year.
Apply the postponement principal to ﬁnished goods inventories.
Speaking at an
earlier APICS forum, Kilty points out that “ﬁnished goods inventory levels
throughout the supply chain can be reduced, leading to lower working cap-
ital, storage, and obsolescence costs by performing postmanufacturing oper-
ations at the distribution centers.”
This method (delayed manufacturing and deferred packaging) is used to
postpone the conversion of components into ﬁnished stock keeping units
(SKUs). Postmanufacturing services are particularly applicable to products
that are modular in nature and can be assembled into a large number of dif-
ferent ﬁnished-product SKUs from a relatively small number of component
SKUs.
Other factors that determine stability of delayed manufacturing include
customer lead time requirements, the ability to forecast demand accurately,
and order fulﬁllment lead time. “This decision also has implications on the
distribution network design for different SKUs, and will also reduce total
supply chain costs,” Kilty declares.
Synchronizing supply chain operations may mean small investments in inventory.
William T. Walker, CFPIM, CIRM, power products supply chain manager
at Agilent Technologies, the Hewlett-Packard spin-off (Rockaway, N.J.),
maintains that synchronized operations maximize both throughput and
proﬁts. However, he also notes that synchronized operations are “counter-
intuitive because they depend on both excess capacity at every node and an
agreement by every trading partner to operate under a new set of rules.”
Under synchronized operations, there will be some inventory at every
node of the supply chain and some inventory within every pipeline. When
customer demand is light, node inventory will be large, and pipeline inven-
tory will be small. Conversely, when customer demand is heavy, node in-
ventory will be small, and pipeline inventory will be large. “In fact, the sum
of the total inventory in equivalent SKU units of all node inventory plus all
the connecting pipeline inventory will be constant,” says Walker. “If it is at
all possible to eliminate some nodes in the current supply chain, then do this
optimization before starting synchronized operations. This is because the
total supply chain inventory investment is driven mostly by the number of
nodes,” he explains.
Insights from the Pros
389

Before synchronized operations can begin, enough inventory must be
put in place at each node to support one synchronization at maximum
throughput. “A synchronization cycle is the time between the broadcast of
one demand signal from the system constraint until the next, which typically
is one day,” Walker details. From then on each node must manage its inven-
tory on a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out basis to ensure stock rotation.
Inventory Quality Ratio is a straightforward technique for identifying and reducing
excess inventories.
“The Inventory Quality Ratio [IQR] is both an analyti-
cal technique for managing inventory dollars and a useful method of meas-
uring inventory performance,” explains Gary Gossard, president of IQR In-
ternational, Inc. (San Juan Capistrano, Calif.; 949-487-5400).
The IQR logic divides inventory into three groups: items with future
requirements, items with no future requirements but with recent past usage,
and items with neither. The items in these groups are then stratiﬁed into typ-
ical ABC-type classiﬁcations using future dollar requirements, past dollar
usage, or current dollar balances. A target inventory level or rule is then set
for each item based on its classiﬁcation. The balance on hand of each item is
compared to the rule, and the dollars of each item are categorized as either
active, excess, slow-moving, or no-moving.
The IQR process shows inventories by individual planner codes and by
purchased versus manufactured items. Other inventory analyses include
breakouts by product line, stock type, buyer, vendor, commodity, account
number, ABC classiﬁcation, storeroom, and plant location. In fact, planners
can drill down on any cell and see all the items that make up those inventory
dollars, and all the detailed information about a given part number.
The potential for savings is great. According to Gossard, surveys of sev-
eral hundred companies ﬁnd that slow-moving or no-moving inventories
account for about 10% of the dollars and that excess inventory typically ac-
counts for 30% to 50% of total inventory dollars.
Identify and control inventory drivers to gain control.
George J. Miller, CFPIM,
president of PROACTION Management Consultants (Oak Park, Calif.;
818-706-2200; Gproaction@aol.com), argues, “Inventory drivers are items
that tend to make inventory go up or down. Identify them, and you will have
some clue of why inventory changes. Understand them, and you begin to
gain control,” he asserts. Key drivers include the following:
• Number of SKUs. For example, the more SKUs in a product, the
harder it is to bring matched sets of parts together at the same time. The rea-
390
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

son, according to Miller, is that there are “multiple items, with multiple ven-
dors, kept and routed through multiple places or paths, with more oppor-
tunity for delays, defects, and the like, meaning more inventory will be
needed.”
• Carrying cost. This refers to the cost of owning inventory. This cost
should be calculated using the cost of money, taxes, insurance, manpower,
energy, space, equipment, and transportation. In addition, Miller advises in-
cluding obsolescence (the risk of inventory never being used, or needing re-
work to make it usable, needs to be factored into the cost of owning inven-
tory), and shrinkage (a portion of inventory that becomes unavailable to the
owner due to loss, damage, theft, or spoilage). Other cost factors that should
be included are record-keeping systems (software, procedures, equipment,
and paper used to track and control inventory) and physical inventories and
reconciliations (which must be conducted to ensure that inventories are
properly accounted for and maintained).
• Supply variation. This refers to the reliability of the supplier to deliver
the desired units in the needed quantity, at the right time, and at an accept-
able quality level. “If this can’t be done reliably, companies tend to carry
buffer/safety stock to make up for the deﬁciencies in the supply system,”
Miller reports.
• Logistics constraints/transportation costs. Especially in the international
arena, logistics constraints must be built into the pipeline portion of the in-
ventory model. Attempts at shortening the pipeline often result in higher
transportation costs, which can end up being directly costed to inventory.
Eliminate the root causes of excess inventory.
Dave Garwood, president of R.D.
Garwood, Inc. (Marietta, Ga.; 770-952-2976; www.RDGarwood.com),
emphasized that ﬁve action steps can “eliminate the root causes of excess in-
ventory and also can lead to improving customer service while reducing in-
ventory.” Garwood’s program includes the following:
• Implement an effective sales and operations planning process. “Carefully in-
tegrate marketing, sales, distribution, new product launches, manufacturing,
and ﬁnancial plans,” he asserts. “Done right, this can be accomplished in six
months or less.”
• Link the master schedules and distribution demands to the supply plans gen-
erated from the S&OP process. This means summarizing the master schedules
by time period (usually monthly) and comparing the total to the supply plan
for each family.

391

• Enforce nonnegotiable principles for scheduling. Among the several prin-
ciples in this action (credible schedules, due date = need date, demonstrated
capacity = required capacity, and align customer delivery and manufactur-
ing schedules), Garwood emphasizes having only one schedule. “Confusion
reigns when the suppliers and the plant ﬂoor try to react to a multitude of
schedules, including hot lists, super hot lists, must-have lists, and the like,”
he insists. Another element he mentions is to manage both supply and de-
mand. “We have historically expected supply to be managed,” he notes.
“Demand has been another story. We accepted surprises in the difference be-
tween forecast and actual demand. Avoiding shortages demands that both
supply and demand be managed,” Garwood insists.
• Minimize the size of planning parameters. Drive lead times, especially
supplier lead times, to just a few days. “This means a much more effective
job of supplier capacity management, and eliminating the EOQ [economic
order quantity] mindset,” says Garwood. “Drive lot sizes to make or buy
only as required each week or day, and implement a process of making bills
of material changes only after discussion and approval by all functional
areas.”
• Make or buy as much as possible after receiving the customer order. The goal
is zero ﬁnished goods inventory. Any ﬁnished goods inventory represents a
problem not yet solved, Garwood maintains.
Take a big bite out of safety stock.
“Like most ﬁrms with high service levels,
we kept a lot of safety stock,” acknowledged Donna Aubuchon, materials
manager, and Mac Borgendale, CFPIM, master scheduling specialist, Milgo
Solutions, Inc. (Sunrise, Fla.). With 20,000 active parts, “it was hard to man-
age safety stock.” 
They launched a four-prong program that enabled them to reduce their
safety stock levels. The ﬁrst was the management directive to reduce inven-
tory. “This led to an immediate review and an immediate common sense re-
duction that averaged 50%,” they explained. “With management willing to
accept longer lead times on large orders, the safety factor went down, al-
lowing reductions in safety stock.”
In addition, as manufacturing lead times went down and factory on-
time deliveries went up, the standard deviation of demand during lead time
went down. After one year, two major reviews of safety stock, and weekly
reviews of purchase signals, safety stock is down about 90%—representing
an investment of $2 million.

Increase ﬁll rates with lower inventory.
One area of particular challenge at Bell-
South Telecommunications involves the management of plug-ins, the spe-
cialized circuit boards that can reach up to $100,000 in cost. The average
plug costs $350, and BellSouth has tens of millions installed in its infrastruc-
ture and buys millions more each year.
The company’s plug supply chain is designed to meet consumer’s needs
quickly. PDCs are warehouses that stock plugs to replenish the ﬁeld quickly
and provide plugs for short lead time demand. 
A ﬁrst step was to reproﬁle the PDCs as they served demand within ﬁve
working days. Any order due in one week or less was shipped from the clos-
est PDC. Any plugs not available at the PDC were shipped from central
stock. The original PDC stocking levels were set to 15 days stock on hand
(DSOH) for all items. With a three-day replenishment time from central
stock, this means that 12 days of safety stock were planned for each item.
The ﬁrst reproﬁle of PDCs changed from a straight 15 DSOH for all
items to a statistically based unit ﬁll target of 99%. “Demand, demand vari-
ability, replenishment cycle and time, and supply variability were parameters
of the new statistically set levels,” explains Chuck LaMacchia, supply chain
integration practice, the Progress Group. Also, only demand with a lead
time of three days or less was served from the PDC.
Because central stock had the ability to reach all locations within three
working days, ﬁlling four- and ﬁve-day lead time orders was not necessary.
“Actually, the PDCs could serve two days or less lead time demand, but an
extra day was provided for the ﬁeld’s comfort,” he notes.
Supply chain used the plug-in component database to set and manage
central stock inventory levels. Although it was developed 25 years ago, La-
Macchia maintains that it has a sophisticated inventory management mod-
ule. The database recommended purchases based on statistically set inven-
tory levels to achieve management-speciﬁed service levels. In an effort to
increase service without increasing inventory, the factors that affect inven-
tory also were analyzed.
For example, one inventory parameter studied was order cycle. Most
plugs were ordered on a monthly basis from suppliers. An ABC analysis was
done on the volume. The 200 A items were less than 10% of all the pur-
chased items. These would now be ordered weekly. The 400+ B items
would be ordered biweekly. All other items would be ordered as needed. 
Reduce internal lead time to lower inventory.
The Frame Plant of Henredon Fur-
niture Industries moved from a functional layout to a cellular layout arranged
Insights from the Pros

by families of parts or product types. “Once the plant is redesigned using a cel-
lular layout, your lead times drop,” observes J. Michael Lemon, CFPIM, for-
mer plant manager of Henredon Furniture Industries. Presently he is vice
president of materials management at Lexington Furniture Industries.
“This happens because we eliminate numerous moves and queue times
associated with interdepartmental transfers of material,” he explains. This, in
turn, allows the cells to take a smaller portion of available space than was pre-
viously used. In the smaller area, work in process should also drop, he claims,
citing the Henredon test case. “Component lead time prior to cellular man-
ufacturing was reported as 40 days from raw material introduction to com-
ponent part inventory,” Lemon explains.
In the test case, for example, lead times were dropped immediately to 30
days, then to 25, 20, 15, and ﬁnally 13 within a 12-month period. The result
was a reduction in work-in-process (WIP) levels of 67%. An electronic kan-
ban system was used for replacement of component part inventory. 
Combined vendor-managed inventory (VMI) and supplier scheduling reduces inven-
tory in the supply chain.
Werthan Packaging (Nashville) took the bold step
of combining two unique applications—supplier scheduling and vendor
manager inventory—into one process. By integrating VMI through its ERP
system with supplier scheduling, Werthan was able to maximize communi-
cation, minimize lead times, reduce inventory, and improve the quality of
work life.
A demand planner was hired, and the VMI process was begun with
Werthan’s second largest customer. The new ERP system played an indis-
pensable part by providing information about demand patterns with the cus-
tomer that previously had not been known. 
Master production schedules were created that provided products on a
predictable basis, and customer service improved to new levels with this
customer. “This allowed us to exchange information for inventory,” the
Werthan team (Donald P. Belmont, CPIM, president and COO; James G.
Hutzel, CPIM, director of production and inventory control; and Mark K.
Nichols, demand management representative) reported at APICS.
The move to supplier scheduling and the ﬁnal linking “was a natural
next step, moving to a supplier scheduling process with our suppliers simi-
lar to the VMI process we shared with our key customers,” maintain Bel-
mont, Hutzel, and Nichols. “Once we had a stable, level-loaded master pro-
duction schedule and had cleaned up the shop orders and other parts of our
database, we were able to start this process,” they said.
394
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

“The only effective way to reduce lead time is through supplier sched-
uling,” they insist. “We have to get projected paper requirements to our sup-
pliers in order to get into their schedule and MRP so we do not have to wait
the entire ﬁve to six weeks.” Werthan arranged to buy capacity in the sched-
ule and not part numbers until the demand time fence was reached.
Move from make-to-order to assemble-to-order.
“Manufacturers achieve im-
pressive gains when they changed from traditional work-order-based plan-
ning and control methods to true repetitive,” explains Gary A. Langenwal-
ter, CFPIM, CIRM, president of Manufacturing Consulting Partners
International, Inc. (Boston). According to a recent APICS repetitive SIG
survey, WIP inventory was down 60%, and ﬁnished goods inventory fell by
36%. Repetitive, he deﬁnes, “assumes that jobs will be intentionally
grouped by processing characteristics, to create logical, if not physical, pro-
duction lines.”
An example from a plastic OEM part manufacturer was cited. They are
implementing assemble-to-order to reduce lead time and inventory. They
are standardizing their components to facilitate this change. The manufac-
turer reduced lot sizes from full pallet to the actual quantity ordered by the
customer, and it is moving toward rate-based scheduling.
When the OEM part manufacturer ﬁrst started back ﬂushing, inventory
accuracy decreased. However, it is now higher than before, and inventory
transactions are signiﬁcantly reduced. Point-of-use storage has also helped
increase inventory accuracy. In addition, WIP inventory is down 50% to
date.
Use a supply replenishment contract to optimize inventory.
Tyco International
(Clark, N.J.) established an advanced supplier partnership practice that led
to the implementation of a rate-based replenishment process. Blair R. Wil-
liams, CPIM, director, offers, “We entered into a contract to ensure compe-
titive pricing and optimized inventory, while providing suppliers with long-
term commitment, supply visibility, and ease of operation.”
At Tyco, the delivery of product is based on the actual rate of con-
sumption of the factory and not on some forecast, he explains. This is
achieved by setting a maximum and minimum stock level and communicat-
ing the weekly inventory on-hand to the supplier.
“The suppliers are at liberty to deliver at their convenience, provided the
on-hand stock level is maintained between max and min,” Williams details.
The advantages of this method are the following:

• Inventory has been reduced. The inventory level is kept between the
max and min, and this is about three weeks. Further, there is no need to in-
crease buffer stock as consumption increases because the supplier is aware of
demand increases well in advance.
• The danger of obsolescence is minimized.
Lessen reliance on MRP and use kanban to reduce inventory.
“If you really want
to reduce raw material inventories, try learning to live without MRP, or at
least become less dependent on it,” challenges Michael C. Moody, CPIM,
CPM, purchasing and materials manager, Hennessey Industries (Nashville).
He still uses MRP to provide a “vision” of needs to their suppliers; how-
ever, they are implementing kanban across all production lines. “In true de-
mand ﬂow manufacturing environments, you need to implement pull sys-
tems to better manage the ﬂow of materials into your manufacturing areas,”
he offers. Customers do not always order in equal “buckets,” as MRP sched-
ules reﬂect.
This is why supplier relationships and kanban are so important, he ex-
plains. “By supplier relationships, I am speaking of lead time reductions,
which reduces the amount of material you need to stock at your plant,”
Moody states. Concurrently, establish kanban to release materials to the fac-
tory. “Kanban and point-of-use storage will help you eliminate wasteful, un-
necessary inventory from the plant.”
Moody reports that inventories are down 44% from where they were in
1995, and they were anticipated to be at 50% by year-end 1998.

In all lot sizing methods there is a tradeoff between setup and inventory car-
rying costs. However, recent applications of constrained-based MRP
(CMRP) reveals it to be a practical method to determine the optimal lot size
based on capacity restraints. In turn, it can help reduce carrying costs and
may just be the next generation of material planning systems. Indeed, Ed-
mund W. Schuster, CPIM, CIRM, manager of logistics planning, Welch’s
Inc. (Concord, Mass.), was able to cut Welch’s carrying costs by $150,000
using this technique (see sidebar).

Raw Materials Management at Welch’s with CMRP Reduces
Inventory Carrying Costs in First Year of Operation
Every year, farmers deliver over 250,000 tons of grapes to Welch’s for press-
ing into juice. Welch’s then stores the grape juice in large refrigerated tanks
for year-round use in producing jams, jellies, concentrate, and bottled juice.
During the year, Welch’s makes decisions on how to best use the grape
crop. It has a reﬁned cost accounting system that calculates requirements for
Concord and Niagara grape juice by month, in tons. The system also accounts
for the recovery loss and cost of converting the Concord and Niagara grapes
into ﬁnished product.
Integrated MRP system calculates time-phased requirements for all components needed
to manufacture.
The new MRP system takes advantage of relational database
information technology and operates in real time rather than batch mode.
The minicomputer-based cost accounting and MRP systems also allow for
extraction of data to computer spreadsheets. 
Yet both these systems have two major drawbacks: They assume inﬁnite
capacity and do not consider operational constraints in MRP calculations, and
they do not provide optimal cost solutions for blending juices.
“The Welch’s MRP system uses regenerative MRP logic,” Schuster of-
fers. “For even minor changes to BOMs, a complete run of the MRP system
becomes necessary to obtain new net requirements for Concord and Nia-
gara.” The system takes about six hours per run. “This virtually eliminates the
ability to interactively ﬁnd nonoptimal solutions using the Welch’s MRP sys-
tem,” he explains.
The approach: developing a third model.
“To improve the cost accounting and
MRP systems, we developed a third model that works independently but
draws data from the cost accounting system,” Schuster deﬁnes the solution.
“The cost accounting and MRP systems calculate requirements for grape
juice correctly, but each lacked the ability to determine optimal cost recipes
and interplant transfer schedules based on operational constraints experienced
by each plant.”
By employing a third model, the existing cost accounting information
acts as a database and provides information on grape juice demand. The third
model then calculates optimal recipes and interplant transfer schedules based
on operational constraints and cost. 
When the calculation is complete, optimal recipes serve as feedback and
are input to both the cost accounting and MRP systems. “The next output of
both these systems will reﬂect an optimal cost plan and set of recipes that
meets operational constraints,” Schuster describes.
“We began operation of the third model, and during its ﬁrst year of op-
eration, the third model saved Welch’s between $130,000 and $170,000 in re-
duced inventory carrying cost,” he declares.

Issues behind CMRP.
Current research focuses on development of CMRP
for the process industries. According to Stuart J. Allen of Penn State Erie,
the Behrend College, where the research is being spearheaded, “An increas-
ing number of process-oriented ﬁrms report problems with traditional, in-
ﬁnite-capacity MRP in planning the purchase and conversion of raw ma-
terials in support of production plans.”
For today’s process-oriented organization, the ultimate source of the de-
pendent demand is a master production schedule (MPS) for end items. “Of-
ten, the MPS becomes disrupted if lower-level raw material or WIP is not
available at the proper time,” Schuster explains. “This causes elevated cost
and poor customer service.”
CMRP’s emerging critical role in the supply chain.
For raw materials, a typical
capacity constraint may involve the ability of a supplier to provide a manu-
facturing plant at a speciﬁed rate. For an internal manufacturing process, the
capacity restraint might involve the sequence of lower-level, raw material
processing involving critical machinery.
“With each case, an extreme disturbance to the MPS can occur if de-
pendent demand lot sizing calculations assume inﬁnite capacity,” Allen told
a recent APICS International Conference. “CMRP serves an important role
in the supply chain by reducing the potential for disruption to the MPS.”
Concerns may stall widespread implementation.
Both Schuster and Allen ac-
knowledge that CMRP raises some important issues concerning practical
implementation: 
• Multilevel versus single level. For process-oriented ﬁrms that have deep
bills of material (BOMs), CMRP must optimize cost while meeting capac-
ity restraints across all levels of the BOM. “This offers a very complex prob-
lem with few, if any, practical solutions,” explains Allen. Optimization of
cost while meeting capacity constraints becomes a much more tractable
problem when considering only a single level of the BOM. “However, this
could lead to local optimal solutions in cases where a deep BOM exists,” he
notes.
• Large-scale CMRP versus small-scale CMRP. Proposed large-scale sys-
tems for CMRP usually include massive use of mathematical programming
along with special techniques to gain a solution in a reasonable amount of
time. This approach requires a great deal of knowledge to make CMRP
398
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

work. The alternative “involves selective, small-scale application of mathe-
matical programming and heuristics to existing, inﬁnite capacity MRP sys-
tems.” This choice has the advantage of reduced cost of implementation and
decreased complexity.
• WIP lot sizing versus raw material lot sizing. Some researchers think
WIP and raw materials require different lot sizing methods to deal with di-
vergent internal and external environments experienced by process-
oriented ﬁrms. However, practitioners commonly use a single lot sizing
method for WIP and raw materials. “This may lead to inappropriate lot siz-
ing solutions,” warns Allen.
• Multiplant versus single plant. Many process-oriented companies have
a network of manufacturing plants that depend on each other for raw mate-
rials and MRP. This increases the complexity of CMRP and raises the ques-
tion of a “third model” approach to guide transfers of critical WIP and raw
materials between plants based on capacity constraints and need.
The case for implementation.
Despite these serious questions about the via-
bility of CMRP in practice, Allen still advocates it as an emerging planning
method. He reasons, “Common observation shows that dependent demand
lot sizing with capacity restraints takes on great importance in process in-
dustries. One need only work a short time in a ﬂuid processing plant to
know that free tank space forms an important constraint when deciding
what lot size to produce.”
The second argument he makes is the importance of an integrated
supply chain with electronic links spanning customer to suppliers of basic
raw materials. “It becomes important to consider ﬁnite capacity at each link
of the supply chain,” Allen explains. “Since MRP serves as an important
business function of process-oriented ﬁrms, it must include capacity con-
straints to promote a smooth ﬂow of materials.”
Consumer goods sector of process industry can surmount these major implementation
issues.
Allen believes that the ﬂat BOM structure, typical of the consumer
goods sector of the process industries, allows a greater chance of overcom-
ing the four critical issues of CMRP implementation. He itemizes the fol-
lowing reasons for his thinking:
• With ﬂat BOM structures, consumer goods ﬁrms can apply single-
level CMRP with reduced chances of ﬁnding local optimal solutions.
Insights from the Pros
399

• Consumer goods companies can modify existing, inﬁnite capacity
MRP systems by the strategic use of heuristics to optimize cost while meet-
ing capacity restraints, eliminating the need to employ large-scale CMRP.
• Because of ﬂat BOMs, consumer goods organizations have fewer lev-
els that require critical lot sizing decisions. Lot sizing can become more spe-
ciﬁc rather than using a single lot sizing method for both WIP and raw ma-
terial purchasing.
• Flat BOMs simplify material ﬂows coordination in multiplant situa-
tions and allow for specialized solutions unique to multiplant CMPR situa-
tions.
“With a little motivation, process-oriented ﬁrms can mold selective as-
pects of CMPR into a practical tool for dependent demand lot sizing,” Allen
emphasizes.

As inventory managers know, kanbans work well in an environment where
there are high product volumes and low product variety. However, at least
one leading expert believes that kanbans work equally as well in high-mix/
low-volume environments. “It is critical, however, that the correct kanban
technique is used for a given environment,” cautions William M. Boyst Jr.,
CFPIM, former director of materials at Nortel’s Digital Switching Division
(Research Triangle Park; Raleigh, N.C.).
When to use which kanban technique.
The product-dependent kanban is the
technique of choice for a high-volume/low-mix environment, according to
Boyst, currently a consultant with the Oliver Wight organization. “Product-
dependent kanbans provide a visible signal of what to do and when to do it,”
he explained at a recent Annual APICS International Conference.
When a kanban becomes empty, you simply replace what was there with
another just like it. The advantage to this technique is that it is easy to ex-
plain and understand. The disadvantage of this technique, he notes, is that it
requires some of every item at each workstation. “More inventory and more
ﬂoor space is required,” Boyst explains.
The product independent kanban is the technique of choice for low-
400
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

volume/high-mix environments. Product independent kanbans provide a
visible signal of when it is time to do something, but they do not commu-
nicate what to do.
The “what-to-do” must be communicated independently of the kan-
ban signal by an external method, for example, by an MRP II dispatch list,
a ﬁnal assembly schedule, or a customer order. The technique works like
this: Whenever a customer pulls material from your kanban, you, in turn,
pull material into your workstation. The process continues until the kanban
at the starting workstation is pulled. The empty kanban at the starting work-
station is the signal to begin production of the next item using one of the
“signals” previously listed.
The advantage of this technique is that it does not require some of each
item at each workstation. The disadvantage is that it is more difﬁcult to ex-
plain and to understand than the product dependent kanban.
Kanban planning in hybrid and repetitive manufacturing environments.
Kirt B.
Behera, CFPIM, president of Behera & Associates, explains, “In the repeti-
tive environment all parts are treated as kanban parts. In the hybrid envi-
ronment the component parts and intermediate-level subassemblies are
identiﬁed by the planning system as either kanban or unique items.”
All kanban items are planned and stocked at the consuming work cell
using a two-bin system, he detailed at the APICS conference. All unique
items are stocked in the stores and kitted when required for work orders.
The kanban execution and inventory control system consists of the re-
lease of line schedules in the repetitive environment and of work orders in
the hybrid environment. The unique work orders for customer orders in the
hybrid environment are processed in a method similar to that for traditional
work orders. Except, Behera points out, only the unique components are
kitted and transferred from stores to line inventory, where they are con-
sumed as an operation is completed.
A kanban work order is initiated on the shop ﬂoor when a using cell
consumes repetitive subassemblies from a bin. The kanban work order
quantities are usually based on small lot production.
The supplying cell manufactures the small-lot work orders and replen-
ishes the kanban bin in the using cell. As lower-level kanban parts are con-
sumed, they are replenished from the stores or the suppliers based on the
just-in-time ( JIT) pull system.
The repetitive environment uses the same pull system except that it does
not use any work orders. With this approach the multilevel BOMs are
Insights from the Pros
401

replaced by fewer level bills. The multilevel stocking, kitting, and issuing ac-
tivities are eliminated for the repetitive assemblies, while these activities are
limited only to the unique assemblies and components, he says.
The control systems consist of multistore inventory control, stores and
kanban cycle counts, customer order tracking, and work cell input and
output production tracking. They also include production completions re-
porting integrated with back-ﬂush system and performance measurement
systems. “The repetitive environment uses a wall-to-wall inventory or a
two-stores inventory system, while the hybrid environment uses a multi-
stores inventory system,” says Behera.
Kanban is not a substitute for planning.
“The kanban is a way to execute the
plan,” Boyst insists. “You can reasonably expect to implement kanban re-
plenishment [see sidebar] in a small pilot area of your plant in 120 days and
be able to see tangible, bottom-line results.” 
For kanban replenishment of purchased items, he suggests developing a
way to communicate projected requirements for those items out beyond
the supplier’s cumulative lead time. This may be done via kanban cards, con-
tainers, an electronic signal (EBON), a fax message (FAXBON), or tele-
phone call (TELBON).
Prior to attempting the implementation of kanban replenishment for a
manufactured item, he suggests developing a plan of how much material is
needed and when it is needed, and to ensure that both the capacity and the
component materials will be available when required.
“Regardless of the replenishment technique selected, it is critical that a
visual display is maintained at the using location to show that the supplier has
been notiﬁed of the need,” Boyst declares. Similarly, a visual display “must
be maintained at the producing location to show that the replenishment
need has been received from the using location.”

manager at Tompkins Associates Inc. (Allentown, Pa.; bschaffer@
tompkinsinc.com). “Cross docking, effectively, is just receive and ship,” he
declared at a recent Distribution/Computer Seminar East (C. S. Report,
Inc.; Uwchland, Pa.; 610-458-6410). “It eliminates storing and picking,” he
points out. “Storage in a warehouse is a major consumer of space and equip-
ment, probably the two most difﬁcult things to get more of.” Also, there is
the elimination of labor, which typically can account for up to 80% of cost
in a warehouse.
Cross docking can dramatically improve inventory turns by synchronizing supply with
demand.
The chief beneﬁts of cross docking are an increase in inventory
turns and a reduction in inventory carrying costs. Other beneﬁts include in-
creased responsiveness and greater space availability in the warehouse. 
However, all inventory does not qualify for consideration. John White,

deﬁnes a “good” candidate for cross docking as one with a short replenish-
ment lead time, fairly heavy demand, and relatively predictable volume and
ﬂows. 
“Don’t take a product that meets just one of these criteria and say it is a
good candidate,” he warns in WERCsheet (Warehousing Education and
Research Council; Oak Brook, Ill.; www.werc.org). For example, if a prod-
uct is heavily demanded over the course of the year but is received in huge
quantities once or twice a year, it would not be a good candidate.
Additionally, Schaffer points out that there are increased costs to cross
docking and that they must be recognized and evaluated to make sure that
the tradeoff favors moving to cross docking. Among the costs he includes
are
• Receiving and shipping labor, equipment, and space requirements
• Clerical and supervisory labor
• Systems hardware and software
• Additional supply chain costs 
Successful cross docking requires absolute conﬁdence in the quality and availability of
product.
“If I can’t count on my supplier to deliver the right product, be on
time, or give me salable product, then I don’t cross-dock,” emphasizes
White. “I have to trust that the product coming into my warehouse is one
that is suitable to go out,” he declares.
While agreeing with White’s assessment, Schaffer warns, “Cross dock-
ing is real-time, and you don’t have an opportunity to go back and ﬁx it. You
have no time to check the quality or quantity of the product.” In all likeli-
hood you will audit the process and provide feedback to the supplier, “but
you can’t start opening boxes, checking and making changes on a routine ba-
sis,” he stresses.
However, Schaffer suggest several procedures that can help build this
conﬁdence level. Among them he includes the following:
• Before pilot testing cross docking, it is necessary to (1) set speciﬁca-
tions and parameters, including the auditing plan; (2) communicate speciﬁ-
cations to all parties, both internal and external; (3) review, revise, and agree
to all speciﬁcations; (4) conduct a test program; and (5) make appropriate
changes.
• Develop a formal supplier and carrier certiﬁcation program.

• Certify all supplier and carriers.
• After implementing cross docking, (1) begin audit of all parameters,
including quantity, quality, and on-time performance; (2) provide a formal
tracking program; and (3) feedback performance to suppliers and carriers.
Also, (4) make supplier and carrier performance a major component in all
discussions; (5) change performance criteria as appropriate; and (6) add ad-
ditional suppliers and carriers only after they are certiﬁed.
It is critical to get all members of the supply chain involved before instituting cross-
docking procedures.
“Cross docking, by deﬁnition, involves other members
of the supply chain,” Schaffer comments. “If you want your cross-docking
initiative to work, you’ll have to treat them as key members, and not the en-
emy.”
This advice is not new. In effect, you must sit down with each of your
supply chain partners and identify the changes necessary for cross docking to
become a reality. You also have to identify any increased costs and work to
minimize total supply chain costs. He explains, “There’s a real need at this
point to sit down and say, ‘What is it going to cost you, cost me; what is our
alternative, and what is the best balance?’”
There might have to be some modiﬁcation of the existing agreement.
“You might have to pay your suppliers or carriers more,” he declares. “I’m
not advocating throwing away money, but if I go to a supplier and say, ‘You
need to do this,’ and it costs my supplier more to do it, then don’t I have a
need to pay for that?”
In fact, the supplier might well come back and offer alternatives that
negate the cost increase, or even reduce the overall cost.

Imagine a 65% increase in inventory turns over a ﬁve-year period. That’s
what a recent study titled Warehouse Inventory Turnover: Trends, Change Dri-

proved inventory turnover, from 8.0 turns to an expected 13.2 times per
year. “The magnitude of improvement in inventory velocity is striking,” the
report concludes. On average, ﬁrms in the study report that inventory turns,

Cross Docking on the Shop Floor a Reality, Too
“We often think of cross docking as being restricted to a DC [distribution
center] or warehousing operation, but we also can apply it to manufacturing,”
insists Burton A. Schaffer, regional general manager at Tompkins Associates
Inc. (Allentown, PA.; bschaffer@tompkinsinc.com). Cross docking in manu-
facturing can provide some major advantages, but it takes some very careful
planning, he warns. The advantages include
•
Reduced ﬁnished goods inventory
•
Increased response
•
Reduced storage space and equipment
•
Reduced handling
However, there are major challenges to confront, he concedes. They in-
clude the following:
•
Inability to hold product for quality control (QC) testing and ap-
proval. However, this can be overcome by (1) addressing production meth-
ods in order to build rather than inspect quality and (2) having a foolproof and
tested method for recalling defective product (which should be an infrequent
occurrence).
•
Reduced ability to level the peak loads on operations with limited ca-
pacity. This may require the addition of some equipment or capacity.
•
Product may have to age before shipping. Therefore, for cross dock-
ing to happen, the process may have to be modiﬁed to eliminate the aging
step.
•
Production may be scheduled to minimize cleanup between different
products. Here, cross docking may force a production plan that requires more
cleaning instead.

members surveyed (16.2%) is “the use of better software and inventory man-
agement tools.” It appears that the largest group of respondents sees tech-
nology and information as the way to drive improvement in inventory turns
(see Table II-1.1).
Improved forecasting, which ranked third, could logically be included
in this category as well. “So there is a very strong emphasis on systems and
software to further improve inventory turns,” reports the research team.
However, it is interesting to note that improved forecasting, which is again
important for future improvements in turns, was also mentioned as one of
the top drivers of inventory turnover improvement.
In addition, efforts to reduce lead time were mentioned by a large num-

The Different Varieties of Cross Docking
In its most generic sense, cross docking is a strategy in which product is re-
ceived from the supplier into a warehouse and then moves across the dock
directly to outbound loading for transportation to the customer or outlet,
explains John White, senior manager at Accenture (formerly Andersen Con-
sulting; Atlanta, Ga.). The product does not go into traditional reserve or pick
slot storage.
However, while the deﬁnition might sound simple, the concepts become
more complex in practice, he explains in WERCsheet (Warehousing Educa-
tion and Research Council; Oak Brook, Ill.; www.werc.com). He outlines
the different types of cross docking as
•
Continuous movement. Also known as unitized continuous movement,
this is the most straightforward form in which a unit, typically a pallet, is
picked off a truck and transported directly to an outbound truck. “The prod-
uct literally never touches the ﬂoor,” he remarks.
•
Distributed case movement. The goods come into the warehouse either
on pallet or ﬂoor-loaded, but distribution is done at the case level. With this
technique, some type of material handling system, such as a sorter or con-
veyor, supports the movement of a large number of cartons.
•
Consolidated movement. This is considered a hybrid of the previous
two. Typically, a pallet is brought in and a portion of it is needed immediately
by the customer, whereas another portion is not. The warehouse operator re-
moves those portions of the pallet to be put away. The rest is married with
other inventory to be shipped. This technique also needs staging and syn-
chronization of the picking and receiving processes.

ber of respondents (15%) as a way to improve turns. Supply chain manage-
ment principles were also one of the higher ranked factors (9.6%). Reduc-
ing SKUs, though important in this context, did not receive as many men-
tions as it did as a driver of past improvements in inventory turns.
Primary factors that put us where we are.
Respondents were asked to indicate
how selected factors that affect inventory turns had changed. Those factors
might be useful as benchmarks for a company’s warehousing operations. 
For example, 70% of all ﬁrms in the study report that their warehouse
space utilization has increased over the study’s three-year period. If a partic-
ular ﬁrm’s experience is just the opposite, this benchmark suggests that the
ﬁrm may want to examine its stock location procedures and storage pro-
cesses, as well as any other factors that inﬂuence space utilization.
It is also interesting to note that there has been an increased emphasis by
top management to reduce inventories, as indicated by 74% of the respon-
dents. Also, there have been similar requests by customers. 
“Good sales forecasts are an important ingredient to effectively manag-
ing inventory, and it does not appear that improved sales forecasts are offer-
ing much help to the majority of ﬁrms,” the study reports. Although 32% re-
port that forecasts have improved, almost double that (62%) report that
forecast accuracy is the same or worse than it was three years earlier.
Factors that are changing in a positive direction.

house management with support for improving inventory turns. They in-

• Electronic data interchange (EDI) utilization on customer orders is
increasing (reported by 65% of the respondents).
• Supply chain coordination (61%) is improving.
• There is additional use of cross docking (48%).
• Order cycle times are being reduced by a signiﬁcant number of ﬁrms
(49% report that this indicator has been reduced since 1995). 
Additionally, respondents were asked to indicate which factors had the
greatest effect on changing ﬁnished goods inventory turnover (see Table II-
1.2). “No one factor received an overwhelming number of responses, and
just seven factors received the most number of mentions,” notes the study.
The results suggest that the factors affecting inventory turns are diverse and
that their impact varies greatly among ﬁrms.
The impact of top management intervention in inventory reduction.
However, the
clear leader in terms of frequency of mention is top management’s emphasis
on reducing inventories. In fact, the importance of management priority to
inventory reduction is shown when comparing ﬁrms whose turns decreased
to those whose turns increased. For ﬁrms whose turns decreased, top man-
agement paid considerably less attention to inventory reduction than for
ﬁrms whose turns increased during the period.

A new technique in aggregate inventory management, inventory proﬁle
analysis (IPA), is helping to improve customer service (as measured by order
ﬁll rate) while reducing and balancing ﬁnished goods inventory. It was de-
veloped by Jim Robison, CFPIM, CIRM, materials manager at SOLA Op-
tical USA (Petaluma, Calif.).
“Inventory proﬁle analysis distinguishes between shortage and excess at
the SKU level,” Robison explains. “IPA coverage, or shortage, is a good in-
dicator of service level, and IPA excess can be used to identify waste and
monitor inventory reduction programs.” Initial tests of IPA indicate that ser-
vice level objectives can be sustained while reducing inventory up to 70%.
After implementing IPA at SOLA, backorders were reduced by 90%.
Making the case for IPA.
“Inventory is best measured as it relates to demand,”
says Robison. Several ratios have been developed to aggregate inventory and
compare it to current or expected demand; among them are turnover ratios
and months on hand.
“We have seen that inventory turnover is a poor choice for internal anal-
ysis because it converts SKU data to cost data,” he argues. “Months on hand
is an improvement because it uses units, but it still aggregates shortage and
excess into a single value,” Robison explained at a recent Annual APICS In-
ternational Conference.
Pyramid forecasting and its role in developing the IPA technique.
With pyramid
forecasting, historical data are captured at the SKU level, according to Ro-
bison. SKU ratios are noted, and the data are then aggregated by product
family. Future demand is forecast by factoring in such items as planned pro-
motions, competitive activity, and the product life cycle. The forecasted to-
tals are then disaggregated back to the SKU level using the historical ratios.
Inventory targets are determined by adding safety stock to the forecast de-
mand. “The key point here is that inventory targets are established at the
SKU level,” he emphasizes.
“We hypothesized that the relationship of the inventory to the SKU tar-
gets, rather than to the months-on-hand total, would be a better indication
of the expected service level,” he explains. “We conducted a test, and the re-
sult was a new analytical technique, the inventory proﬁle analysis.”

Putting IPA to the test.
To test the IPA concept, SOLA conducted a six-
month-long parallel study of seven products, each consisting of several hun-
dred SKUs. A 95% service level objective was used for the test. For the dis-
cussion, Robison looked at one product in detail and summarized all seven.
SOLA developed a MOH service level chart (see Figure II-1.1) with
logarithmic trend line. The R2 value (coefﬁcient of determination that
ranges between 0 and 1) is 0.52. The trend line (or the formula) tells us that
it required about 2.5 MOH to achieve the desired service level objective.
Three weeks were selected for analysis. Weeks A and B both had high
service levels, but week A did it with a lot less inventory. Week C had about
the same inventory as week A but a much lower service level. Why was week
A more efﬁcient?
“MOH cannot tell us,” Robison notes. However, with some IPA charts,
a more accurate picture evolves—for example, the IPA shortage chart (see
Figure II-1.2). A linear trend line with R2 of 0.67 is used (the best-ﬁtting
trend line will have the highest R2 value). Weeks A and B, with their high
service levels, both had high coverage (low shortage). Week C had low ser-
vice coverage and low coverage (high shortage). “We were able to hit our
95% service level objective with about 93% coverage, or 7% shortage,” he
explains.
An IPA excess chart, with a linear trend line with very high R2 of 0.837,
was another tool (see Figure II-1.3). Note weeks A and C, with low excess

and low MOH, and week B, with high excess and high MOH. From this
visual, a 2.5 MOH gave a 115% excess inventory. “We could have cut our
total inventory in half and still met our service level objective,” Robison con-
cludes. 
The study, he declared, conﬁrmed the hypothesis that the inventory
proﬁle analysis is a better indicator of service level than is a months on hand
analysis. In addition, the study discovered a very high correlation of MOH
to excess inventory.

How to implement IPA.
You can implement IPA using Microsoft Excel,
Robison reports. Excel will automatically calculate and plot trend lines in
the charts. In addition, it can display the trend-line formula and the R2
value.
Initial decisions include product hierarchy, data source, and reporting
frequency. For forecasts, you need to include both the download date and
the forecasted date. Include any other relevant information, such as the
name of the person responsible for the product. Enter the downloaded ac-
tual and target quantities at the SKU level. For each SKU, calculate the cov-
erage (shortage) and the excess. Sum the target, coverage, and excess quan-
tities.
Coverage is the total coverage quantity divided by the total target quan-
tity. Excess is the total excess quantity divided by the total target quantity.
“You can use the Excel ChartWizard to create a combination chart showing
coverage, target, and excess,” he describes. “Use a scatter (x,y) chart, with
linear trend line, to compare coverage to service level.

With the mounting pressure to reduce and accelerate inventory, manufac-
turers refuse to accept sluggish practices such as long production runs, in-
ventory buffers, or high ﬁnished goods inventory. As a result, there is re-
newed interest in the ﬂow-through concept for both manufacturing and
distribution. The beneﬁts attributed to ﬂow include up to 90% reduction in
inventory, 40% reduction in space requirements, at least an 80% reduction
in manufacturing cycle time, and a decrease of 60% in quality costs.
Flow manufacturing and the importance of kanban.
“Flow uses factory design
as a foundation for linking manufacturing processes to timing of customer
demand for products,” says Tom Grace, senior analyst at AMR Research
(Boston; tgrace@amrresearch.com). “Flow emphasizes speed and customer
focus issues such as product quality and conﬁgurability.”
A critical element of a ﬂow system is the kanban replenishment module.
According to Grace (ERP and Flow: The Status Quo Meets Its Replacement;
AMR Research, Inc.; 617-542-6600), “Aggressive users of ﬂow use kanban
systems to determine optimal replenishment rates in the context of current
demand as well as automating longstanding supplier relationships.” With siz-
414
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

ing calculations and analysis components, the module is distinct from the
kanban function in most ERP systems. These “merely” automate the pass-
ing of predeﬁned supplier signals based on inventory levels.
Implementing ﬂow in an engineer-to-order environment and its impact on inventory.
The ﬂow manufacturing philosophy at Air Products and Chemical’s Semi-
conductor Equipment Center (SEMC; Allentown, Pa.) is designed to min-
imize WIP and inventory-driven computer transactions. Flow manufactur-
ing uses raw inventory located in a stockroom, line kanban locations, and an
intermediate location called raw and in-process inventory (RIP).
“Parts are ‘pulled’ to the line on demand,” explain Paul J. Pfeiffenberger,
materials manager, and James M. Curran, plant manager. Demand is typi-
cally generated by an empty kanban container. The new pull manufacturing
system at SEMC converted the shop ﬂoor from a system driven by output of
a computer to one driven by visual signals. The MRP II terminals were re-
moved from the shop ﬂoor, and the shop ﬂoor control module is no longer
used. 
“Jobs are sequenced into the production line at the beginning of the
manufacturing process,” Pfeiffenberger and Curran told a recent APICS In-
ternational Conference. “Employees pull or ﬂow the work through the fac-
tory based on the in-process kanban [IPK] signal.” If a job is in the upstream
IPK, the employee pulls that job into the workstation and performs the ap-
propriate work. If the downstream IPK is full and a job is completed at the
workstation, the employee moves to an open workstation. “There is no need
to consult a computer to identify which job is next in line,” Pfeiffenberger
and Curran explain.
Previously, routings had to be maintained in the MRP II system. “The
new pull system does not rely on routings to deﬁne the operations needed
to manufacture an end item,” they report. The process maps shows that vir-
tually all of SEMC’s products consume the same processes. Therefore, it was
decided that all SKUs would follow the same path when the production line
was designed.
Flow manufacturing or a pull scheduling system at SEMC has enabled them to meet
several goals.
First, the manufacturing cycle time for an SKU has been re-
duced from 20+ days under the MRP II system to 10 days using the new
pull system. The goal is seven days or less for an SKU.
The decrease in manufacturing cycle time has also reduced the level
of WIP. It has been slashed by 55% since the implementation of pull

manufacturing. In fact, they also converted some of the savings in WIP to
raw materials. This increases their ability to respond to customer require-
ments. To further improvements, SEMC is investigating software that inte-
grates the pull system throughout the business process (see sidebar).
Adopting ﬂow-through in distribution.
Flow-through warehousing uses pro-
cesses that reduce handling and storage requirements while improving cus-
tomer service. “A ﬂow-through distribution center incorporates certain as-
pects of traditional, cross-dock, and sort and stage operations to achieve
maximum efﬁciency,” explain Dave Eyestone and Mike Torch, senior vice
presidents at Transtech Consulting, Inc. (Columbus, Ohio; 614-751-0575).
Flow-through systems minimize handling; decrease storage costs; reduce
shrinkage, damage, and obsolescence; and reduce inventory investment and
carrying costs.
Effective ﬂow-through begins with suppliers, Eyestone and Torch as-
serted at the CLM Annual Conference. Assuming that most suppliers can
provide the necessary documentation for ﬂow-through operations, they re-
view the impact on several of the processes:
• Receiving and processing. With the advanced scheduling information,
you know when trucks will be arriving at your loading dock. Bar coding is
critical to the smooth operation of the ﬂow-through system. With advanced
shipping notices and bar-code license plates on pallets and cartons, you are
able to verify receipt of product and to verify that you have received the cor-
rect items.
• Locating. Whether you are storing items or immediately shipping
them, the system will direct product to the appropriate place. Shipping con-
solidation and staging for cross-dock items and ﬂow-through inventory al-
locations to customer orders are directed by the system.
• Allocation. With the quick response capabilities of a ﬂow-through sys-
tem, you can incorporate a pull methodology, with allocations based on up-
to-the-minute parameters such as predetermined store models and product
availability.
• Putaway/sorting. Radio frequency–directed (RF-directed) putaway
based on product bar coding allows sorting of product for storage, customer
order, or shipping staging instantaneously. Using RF putaway, you can ac-
complish three important tasks: item veriﬁcation, count veriﬁcation, and
putaway location veriﬁcation. This translates to greater inventory accuracy.

Insider Assessment of Status of Flow Software
The present ﬂow manufacturing software market has three segments, accord-
ing to AMR Research’s senior analyst Tom Grace, author of ERP and Flow:
The Status Quo Meets Its Replacement. He identiﬁes them as
1. Contenders. Software providers in this classiﬁcation have full product
suites suitable for pilot tests, dedicated development/support, and active client
implementations. Grace observes that the “missing” pieces are more active
references and lower, more reasonable pilot pricing.
In assessing this group, Grace notes, “American Software and John Con-
stanza Institute of Technology [JCIT] are positioned to duke it out for the pi-
lot market. While JCIT remains the ﬂow-speciﬁc consulting leader, Ameri-
can Software has a stronger reputation for reliable software.” Oracle stands
alone among the big ERP vendors in terms of demonstrated commitment. By
summer, “graphical line design will be a bigger issue once JCIT and Ameri-
can Software prove their new products with this leading-edge feature in the
ﬁeld.”
2. Fence sitters. This group consists of those in early stages of develop-
ment or reselling and those with partial functionality and interested clients.
However, this latter group has yet to commit to full development. Grace be-
lieves that the missing pieces for this group are implementation experience,
live sites, and ﬁrm commitments. “Manufacturers recognize a percentage of
ﬂow manufacturing could be logically handled within their ERP system to-
day. However, they need vendors to assist them with this 20% that makes ﬂow
implementation sustainable.”
Cincom and JBA are more committed to ﬂow at this stage. With cus-
tomer direction, however, others will follow. “With SAP and J. D. Edwards,
the inevitable lag between initial promises and viable product is the cause for
alarm,” he declares. “Companies with a need should not tolerate hang time—
they should pilot with a contender instead.”
3. Benchwarmers. These software providers are developing ﬂow systems
with a chance of being inﬂuential players. Here, the missing piece is a clear
timeline for actual products. PeopleSoft is working with its manufacturing
clients to develop ﬂow functionality. Like Oracle, PeopleSoft is motivated to
capture high-tech manufacturers using ﬂow to deliver highly customized
products.
Cell Fusion/RSI Group, a consulting and software house led by former
SAP managers, is developing a ﬂow product suite. They are working with a
roster of current R/3 users. “With SAP’s commitment to ﬂow still up in the
air, RSI’s experience coupled with a well-designed application could strike an
open opportunity,” Grace asserts.

“Flow-through distribution and its subsets of cross-dock and sort and
stage are going to become more prevalent,” Eyestone and Torch predict.
“The incorporation of ﬂow-through in distribution systems is likely to be
the trend for the next decade.”

Are you currently sitting on top of excess or obsolete inventory? If you want
to dispose of it without having to settle for distressed value, why not con-
sider barter trade as an option? Barter trade (see sidebar) has evolved dra-
matically in the past decade. It is no longer restricted to the simple form of
counter trade, in which exchanges of goods of equal value are negotiated be-
tween companies or through membership-based barter exchanges.

Getting almost full price for the excess/obsolete inventory.
As trade ﬁnance has
become more of a buyers’ market, a new generation of sophisticated corpo-
rate barter companies, with global networks of ofﬁces and contacts, has
sprung up. These ﬁrms typically buy your surplus goods or services at the
full distributor price in a “coin of the realm” currency called Financial Trade
Credits, also known as trade dollars. The barter company then resells the
goods through their global network, making their proﬁt on the resale.
Swapping trade dollars for “other” goods and services.
The trade dollars can be re-
deemed for a variety of goods and services. These can range from shipping,
packaging, and freight-forwarding to long-distance phone calls, airline seats,
and raw materials. The use of ﬁnancial trade credits, moreover, is often not lim-
ited to the inventory of the corporate barter company being dealt with. Most
barter companies now conclude trades with approved suppliers of the trade
credit holder or develop new qualiﬁed sources of supply that will trade.
Barter trading a growth industry.
This sophisticated form of bartering, often
involving multiple players and a number of products in a single transaction,
is growing dramatically. For instance, in North America alone it grew to
$8.2 billion as early as 1997. Fueled by the global ﬁnancial crisis, bartering
in Asia has expanded into a business earning more than $69 billion a year.
Why you might consider trade bartering.
In discussing the possibility of using
this tool with your company’s management, inventory managers should
point out these advantages:
1. Barter company is the buyer. Unlike old-fashioned barter, the barter
company does not attempt to ﬁnd a buyer for excess/obsolete inventory. It
is the buyer who will take title to the goods. However, a slight negative is
that in 90% of cases, the goods or materials will remain on your premises un-
til a ﬁnal buyer is located.
2. Liquidate excess/obsolete inventory at market value. With barter trade you
do not have to be concerned about distress value or closeout prices for your
goods. The excess inventory from canceled orders is liquidated at market
value. In this manner, cash tied up in excess/obsolete inventory can be freed
for other operations.
3. Avoid disruptions in the distribution channel. In disposing of your
inventory, barter companies agree to restrictions on distribution to avoid
Insights from the Pros
419

dislocations to your organization’s market channels. For example, you are
guaranteed that your products will not be distributed in countries and areas
where your company has other license or distribution agreements. As added
protection, a “nondiversion” contract is signed by the end users, prohibit-
ing them from reselling products.
4. Barter company clients attract smaller ﬁrms. In the past, barter company
clients were typically larger organizations—those in the Fortune 1,500 to
2,000 range. Today, smaller to midsized companies are increasingly part of
the market. For example, while $50 million to $100 million used to be the
typical transaction size, barter companies are now handling transactions in
the $500,000 range.
5. Barter companies provide a broad array of products and services. In meeting
with your company team, barter company representatives can discuss your
ﬁrm’s major areas of expenditures to supply trade credits in those areas, in
order to offset costs. Additionally, because barter companies engage in mul-
tilateral trading, they can offer clients a broad array of products and services
that cover most major corporate expenditure categories.

No matter how sophisticated your inventory control software is, or how
savvy your marketing may be, excess inventory is inevitable. Experience has
taught us that problem products are one of the inescapable by-products of
doing business. Typically, two traditional solutions to getting rid of excess
inventory are selling that merchandise to a liquidator or sending it to a land-
ﬁll. However, a third solution is available to inventory managers that can be
more proﬁtable to your organization’s bottom line. In addition, it also avoids
the many problems associated with liquidating or dumping.
The donation approach to removing excess and obsolete inventory.
By donating
excess inventory to charity, a business can qualify for a Federal income tax
deduction. This is done under Section 170 (e)(3) of the U.S. Internal Rev-
enue code.
420
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Regular (C) corporations may deduct the cost of the product donated,
plus half the difference between cost and fair market value. Deductions may
be up to twice cost. And S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietor-
ships earn a straight cost deduction.
As an example, a tool wholesaler purchases a wrench from a manufac-
turer for $10. In turn, the wholesaler sells it to a retailer for $20. By donat-
ing overstocks of that wrench to charity, the wholesaler can earn a deduc-
tion of $15 as a C corporation. The $15 deduction is calculated by taking the
cost ($10) plus half the difference between the cost and fair market value
($20).
Liquidating overstocks not as rewarding as donating it to charity.
Liquidating ex-
cess units of that wrench often provides less than the wholesaler’s cost of $10.
Sending them to landﬁll and writing them off as a loss will provide a deduc-
tion equal only to the $10 cost. Therefore, for C corporations especially, do-
nating is the better option. 
One of the problems of liquidating excess inventory is that it can some-
times come back to compete against the donor company. For instance, the
product can reappear in discount barns or other discount outlets. This oc-
currence may harm the donor’s price structure. In addition, if the donor
company serves a regional market, his customers, especially retailers, might
be hurt by such discounting as well.
Dumping has its share of problems, too.
First, there are landﬁll fees. Then there
is the situation that these sites are quickly ﬁlling with trash—let alone per-
fectly useful products. Finally, and most important, the practice is wasteful.
Eligible types of merchandise that are prime candidates for donations.
The most
obvious are products that sell poorly. Although sales or marketing people
may argue that some of these products are still attractive to customers, the
inventory manager may have to take control by suggesting that donating
them will allow the company to focus on selling better and more proﬁtable
goods. As an example, catalog businesses in particular are well aware of the
need to weed out such slow movers and keep offering fresh, new products.
Returns are frequently overlooked.
As long as the items are not damaged, they
can often ﬁnd a welcome home with a nonproﬁt organization. Donating
returns avoids labor and costs involved in returning that merchandise to
stock.
Insights from the Pros
421

Packaging changes are also good candidates for donation.
Whether it is a package
redesign, or the expiration of a contest or rebate, donating that merchandise
will keep it from confusing consumers and can avoid several market issues.
Canceled orders can be considered for donation.
Again, donating avoids restock
costs. And if the product was custom made, its salability in the general mar-
ket may be doubtful.
Finally, discounted models, styles, and colors are prime donation candidates.
An
obvious example is computer software that is upgraded regularly. The pub-
lisher does not want the previous version on the open market competing
with the new upgrade. Because of the high markup on software, the deduc-
tion can be quite attractive. Housewares and other products that rely heav-
ily on trends are frequently donated, too.
Companies can choose to donate locally in order to generate goodwill in the commu-
nity where they are located.
When doing so, it may be necessary to have your
accountant or tax adviser instruct the recipient organization about what in-
formation to furnish on the tax documentation.
An alternative is to use a free service, such as the nonproﬁt National As-
sociation for the Exchange of Industrial Resources (NAEIR). Founded in
1977, it collects donated products from businesses and redistributes them to
6,000 charities and schools throughout the United States. NAEIR does not
charge donor companies for its placement service. For information, contact

Statistical process control (SPC), a widely used quality measurement tech-
nique in the manufacturing sector, is ﬁnding new application as an inven-
tory management tool. SPC is succeeding because inventory remains the
major element of most companies’ distribution costs.
The application of statistical process control to inventory management is new.
The
key objective of SPC inventory management is to use only historical inven-
422
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

tory and demand data to optimize replenishment ordering and inventory
levels in the future. When calculating the replenishment orders, SPC takes
into consideration not only deviations of expected customer demand of the
next periods but also variations in lead time.
This technique promises to be a new approach for inventory manage-
ment professionals to complete daily stock management, conclude Hans-
Christian Pfohl (pfohl@bwl.tu-darmstadt.de), Oliver Cullmann, and Wolf-
gang Stolzle, all of Darmstadt University of Technology (Darmstadt,
Germany). They examined SPC for inventory management with actual in-
ventory levels and quantities of backorder situations with the 3M Medical
Products Group European Business Center and compared it with simulated
situations. The focus of their study is on ﬁnished goods and in-transit in-
ventory. The following sections come from their work, appearing in the
Journal of Business Logistics, describing the application of SPC to inventory
management. 
SPC technique does not rely on demand forecast.
It takes both variations in de-
mand and lead time into consideration when calculating a replenishment or-
der. SPC only monitors historically the control of the demand and inven-
tory processes over time in control charts. In this manner, they note, it is
possible to recognize nonconforming demand or inventory. This reduces the
probability of either backorder or excess inventory situations. When a non-
conforming output is detected, the special causes can be examined and elim-
inated to avoid further inventory shortages or unnecessary waste of capital to
guarantee customer satisfaction.
How the SPC technique controls inventory.
At the beginning, a database is
ﬁlled with inventory and demand data. The demand gives information about
the quantity of demand over a certain period. The inventory data is the in-
ventory balance at the end of the period.
First, the system tests if the demand and inventory processes are in con-
trol or out of control. This indicates whether the system can handle the pro-
cesses or whether there are statistical abnormalities in past demand and in-
ventory curves that would make it difﬁcult to make a safe reorder quantity
decision using SPC.
If the processes are in control, the SPC decision approach can be applied.
The
support engine examines and interprets the demand and inventory pro-
cesses. Based on defined rules, the SPC decision support system calculates
Insights from the Pros
423

a replenishment order proposal from the information in the database. This
order can be generated automatically. In this case, the system works with-
out any need for any manual intervention by an inventory control spe-
cialist.
If the process is out of control, the SPC decision support system calcu-
lates a reorder proposal. However, due to the statistical abnormalities, the
decision support system indicates a problem and warns the inventory con-
troller that it cannot guarantee safe handling of the situation. In this case, the
inventory controller is forced to check the replenishment order proposal.
If he or she does not agree with the systems information when examin-
ing the demand and inventory history, the order is adjusted manually. Finally,
an adjusted order will be generated.
Calculating the efﬁciency evaluation of SPC.
Because SPC is a new method to
optimize efﬁciency of inventory management, the input factors are deﬁned
as all costs for the use of the method. Output performance can be identiﬁed
as the improvement of replenishment decisions. Performance includes the
dimensions of procurement costs, carrying costs, out-of-stock costs, and the
service objective. 
In contrast to other methods, the SPC inventory control system has two
major advantages when looking for operating costs. First, the costs of col-
lecting all data and information needed for the system to work may be very
low. The SPC system needs only information about the demand and inven-
tory history. Normally these data are available and easy to collect.
Second, a major advantage is the self-contained mode of operation of
the SPC software. Based on its decision rules, the SPC decision support sys-
tem can decide without intervention the replenishment order quantity as
long as the demand and inventory processes are in control. In these cases, the
system automatically generates orders without the intervention of an inven-
tory control specialist.
“The SPC system’s ability to work independently increases the produc-
tivity of the inventory specialist, and the decrease in the number of individ-
uals needed to control all products on stock decreases operating costs,” the
research team concludes.
SPC inventory control system does decrease average levels of inventory.
The SPC
software is an instrument for inventory management that uses historical pro-
jection as its forecasting method. The accuracy that can be achieved for short
424
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

forecasted time periods is good. However, the authors observe that “as with
other instruments that use historical projection, the SPC system is still weak
in forecasting, signaling, and reacting to sudden rapid changes in demand
that happen for the ﬁrst time.” However, SPC rules concerning slow drifts
in demand and inventory cause much faster and better reactions to these fun-
damental changes in the course of time, they agree.
Based on the authors’ initial work, SPC inventory control succeeds in
decreasing the average level of inventory. In this simulation it ranged be-
tween 20% and 65%. This “dramatically” reduced inventory carrying costs,
which consist of capital costs, storage space costs, inventory service costs,
and inventory risk costs. 
With the assumption that capital costs represent about 25% of the total
logistics cost, the overall reduction through savings in capital costs could be
signiﬁcant. In their simulation it amounted to 16.25%.
But a word of warning.
Despite these improvements, the simulations in this
project show that inventory control with the SPC software still leads to more
inventory shortages than does manual inventory control with conventional
instruments. More backorder situations are the reason for an increase of
backorder costs and lost sales costs. 
“These backorder situations could be prevented if the SPC system
would not react as aggressively to excess inventory,” Pfohl, Cullmann, and
Stolzle conclude. Although the inventory reduction would be less, the
amount of inventory shortages would also be less, thus reducing the back-
order costs and lost sales costs, they report.
SPC inventory control system leads to a positive impact on out-of-inventory costs.
Because the inventory control specialist is released from a large part of the
manual workload, he or she can now manage additional part numbers and
deal with inventory problems such as stock shortages more “intensively and
carefully.” In this way, inventory shortages might be eliminated much more
quickly.
The research team is optimistic.
“Since the SPC inventory management, de-
cision support system produces inventory levels that are comparable or even
better than those of conventional systems and simultaneously produces a re-
duced workload, further examination and testing under real conditions is
encouraged,” they conclude.

Shorter product development cycles, product proliferation, and global com-
petition are making it more difﬁcult to manage demand. Too often, prod-
uct availability and order quantities fail to match up, resulting in excessive
inventory, poor customer service, lost sales opportunities, and inefﬁcient
production scheduling. Thus, many ﬁrms are turning to automatic replen-
ishment programs (ARPs) to better manage their inventory.
ARPs help establish an exchange relationship in which the seller re-
plenishes or restocks inventory based on actual product use and stock level
information provided by the buyer. The intent is to make inventory com-
mitment more efﬁcient. Continuous replenishment planning (CRP) and
VMI are the more popular ARPs.
VMI Is Most Popular ARP 
At the University of Oklahoma (www.ou.edu), researchers Patricia J.
Daugherty, Siegfried Professor of Marketing; Matthew B. Myers, Assistant
Professor of Marketing; and Chad W. Autry, doctoral student, have con-
structed a proﬁle of ARPs in the logistics industry. As shown in Table II-1.3,
the most common type of ARP is VMI, which nearly one-half of the re-
spondents to the research study use. CRPs also receive a signiﬁcant level of
involvement: more than two-thirds of respondents.

tory, efﬁcient consumer response, and distributor-managed inventory reﬂect
a lower level of involvement. Slightly over a third of the respondents report
involvement in more than one type of automatic replenishment.
Full ARP Implementation Yet to Come
Survey respondents were asked to indicate their ﬁrms’ implementation sta-
tus for each of 17 items (see Table II-1.4) on a seven-point scale. Automatic
replenishment has been in use, on average, for only about four-and-a-half
years, so it is not surprising that implementation is not complete at most
companies.
Information Systems Capability Proves Strong
When asked to indicate their information systems’ (IS) capabilities (see Table
II-1.5), managers claim that their strength is in providing daily download of
information (5.70). They are doing relatively well at getting daily access to
information needed and are only slightly less capable in information accu-

across functional areas is the predominant goal.
Managers Claim ARP Success
Finally, respondents were asked to rate their ARPs’ performance. ARPs are
achieving some of managers’ most basic program-related goals (see Table
II-1.6). The programs are highly successful in improving customer service

levels (5.47), fewer stockouts (5.33), improved delivery reliability (5.15), and
faster inventory turns (4.94).
Reducing the need to discount product (3.96) is the least successful area.
ARPs attempt to match supply and demand, but mismatches occur even
with careful planning. Thus, many managers mark down products rather
than carrying them in inventory or returning them to vendors.
What You Should Know about ARPs
According to the authors, three essential facts about ARPs are the follow-
ing:
1. IS capabilities are positively inﬂuenced by ARP implementation. The basic
components of an ARP include decision support systems, product identiﬁ-
cation technology (bar coding), and EDI. Thus, ﬁrms with greater ARP in-
volvement have more support data to guide decision making.
2. ARP effectiveness is positively inﬂuenced by program implementation and IS
capabilities. Because inventory management is dependent on information, the
ARP effectiveness is linked to IS capabilities. Timely, usable information is
needed to support quick decisions associated with replenishment.
3. ARP performance is positively inﬂuenced by ARP effectiveness. ARPs can
help you develop a satisﬁed customer base; customers can rely upon prod-
ucts to be in stock as needed. This addresses today’s concern with faster de-
liveries in more tailored shipments.
Involvement in automatic replenishment is expected to yield a range of
beneﬁts, including increased sales per store due to more efﬁcient stocking,
more frequent deliveries, higher selling space productivity because of fewer
stockouts, and less need for backroom storage space for safety stock. If not
totally eliminated, safety stock can at least be dramatically reduced.

Inventory reduction is so important that more than 85% of respondents to
Inventory Reduction Report’s series of manager surveys maintain that inven-
tory reduction will be an important or very important aspect of their re-
sponsibilities during this new year. And their bosses demand it—inventory
is among their chief concerns (see Table II-2.1). Ready to do battle to slice
inventory to acceptable levels, these managers also provide some insight
into the techniques and tactics on which they will focus. Respondents ea-
gerly discussed the “hot” inventory reduction tools they will be applying
this year.
Review ways to reduce inventory.
“We plan to increase the communication of
our ideas and plans with suppliers and all in-house departments involved,”
an assistant inventory management supervisor at a manufacturer of food ser-
vice equipment says. “With the help of various departments, our safety
stocks will be reduced and managed better with the help of techniques such
as cycle counting and by reviewing all available information in determining
order quantities.”
She notes that there will be a greater emphasis on cycle counting. “We
will be spending more time doing cycle counting, and increasing the quan-
tity of the items being counted,” she explains. “We also plan to do it on a
more continuous basis.”
430

Create a build-to-order scenario.
“Previous to last year we built to forecast,”
maintains the director of total supply chain at a large diversiﬁed producer of
household/consumer products. “That, quite frankly, always left us with high
inventory and low customer delivery, as our forecast per item accuracy was
only about 50%, while the family accuracy was higher, at about 90%.”
Since they do not think they could improve on their forecast accuracy,
they are moving to a build-to-order philosophy. With the new build-to-order
concept and the emphasis on delivery, they expect to reduce ﬁnished goods
inventory by 30% and work in progress (WIP) by 15% during the ﬁrst year.
Aggressively use inventory management techniques.
The administrative director
of materials management at a health care facility is focusing her efforts on re-
ducing safety stock levels and reintroducing consignment programs. “My
biggest challenge is safety stock reduction,” she acknowledges. “By closely
tracking usage, we’ve made some progress.” However, emphasis is shifting
to bring more analysis into the usage reports and determining the A, B, and
C inventory levels. “We plan to boost our inventory turns to national bench-
mark levels,” she offers.
Share information with suppliers.
“We will be making production plans avail-
able not only to our Tier 1 suppliers, but also to the Tier 2 suppliers for se-
lected product lines,” says the director of purchasing at a large producer of
ductile iron products. “Our target is to reduce lead time from 22 weeks to
6 weeks, which we estimate will reduce costs by some 25%.
“We’re also looking to reduce our overnight emergency orders and cut
our customer backlog by some 30%,” he explains. “We’re going to do this
in an environment in which we’re forecast to expand our sales 20% over last
year.”

Determine carrying cost of inventory.
“I’m on a crusade to convince operating
managers they don’t need six months of safety stock,” claims the director of
inventory management at a midsize producer of ﬁnishing products. “My
primary tool will be the determination of the inventory carrying cost for this
type of inventory, and others as well.”
The inventory carrying cost data will be distributed to all plants on a
monthly basis, and its reduction will be used as part of each plant manager’s
bonus plan. “We’ll also institute monthly meetings to promote open avenues
to discuss ways to reduce the carrying costs,” he explains. The estimated sav-
ings goal for the ﬁrst year is a “modest” $180,000, which will build in ensu-
ing years.
Expand number of kanban lines.
The logistics manager at a manufacturer of
gaming machines will be expanding the kanban lines to over 700 part num-
bers in 1,500 locations on the production ﬂoor. That covers eight produc-
tion lines and ﬁve subassembly areas.
“My plan is to use the kanbans and integrate JIT [just-in-time] to re-
duce our inventory levels on hand,” he relates. A challenge he expects is to
convince engineering, buyers, and production of the beneﬁts of this con-
cept.
“The problem with our buyers, for example, is that they are measured
on cost savings based on cost of goods,” he explains. “So they routinely buy
stock for up to three months of supply. The challenge will be to break them
of this outdated buying practice.”
Introduce supplier-managed inventory.
“We’re in the process of having our 38
key suppliers get to the point of managing about 60% of our raw materials and
packaging supplies,” says the supply chain manager at a large manufacturer of
diversiﬁed consumer/industrial products. “Our ultimate goal is to have the
materials delivered no more than 24 hours prior to a production run.”
The supply chain manager has already seen a signiﬁcant improvement in
the quality and elimination of obsolete material. “Materials are no longer in-
ventoried and stored, and the plan is to have them ﬂow directly to work cen-
ters and to be consumed within 24 hours,” he explains.
Plan for more reviews and analyses.
“We’re on a mission to remove some $10
million in ﬁnished goods inventory, which represents about 25% for us,”
notes the operations vice president at a major electronics company.
432
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

“We’ll be analyzing each line and reviewing safety stock levels for our
stocked items,” he explains. “We’ll also be looking at creating some tools so
the shop ﬂoor can see the orders and the delivery ship-on date.”
Orders are of three types, he notes. Customer orders are on items typ-
ically not stocked. Replenishment orders are shipped from the company’s
distribution centers (DCs) when stock levels reach a speciﬁed minimum,
and seasonal orders are those where there is not enough capacity during the
busy season to satisfy demand.
The solution will be implemented in ﬁve manufacturing locations in
North America, representing some 300 production lines.
Increase drop-shipping activity.
“We have several large jobs that we are doing
in Canada, Aruba, Costa Rica, and Puerto Rico, and they were ordering the
equipment and having it sent here ﬁrst,” explains the trafﬁc manager at a
small manufacturer of closed-circuit television (CCTV) equipment. “We’ve
been able to reduce our WIP inventory by 60% by having the suppliers and
contract manufacturers drop ship the equipment.”
Focus on reducing replenishment lead time.
An internal consultant at a major
producer of rubber products explains how he is working to reduce lead time
by developing an inventory model based on lead-time performance. “It’s a
reengineering effort, and we’re focusing on processes and systems that will
ultimately reduce the replenishment lead time by 40% to 80%.”
The net impact will be to reduce inventory by 25% and improve ﬁll rate
by eight points.
Shift inventory to the supplier community.
“We’ll be shifting more inventory
to our suppliers,” declares a purchasing agent at a midsize processor of
seafood. Part of the problem is that there is not enough warehouse space to
store what is needed while managing freight costs properly. “We’ve accepted
higher freight rates by ordering what we need instead of always getting full
truck loads, as in the past,” he states.
However, high on the list is moving more inventory to the suppliers.
“We’ve convinced our corrugated supplier to warehouse frequently used
boxes,” he explains. “This action has cut our lead times from seven days to
one day.” In another case, they helped a ﬁlm supplier “arrange to warehouse
ﬁlm near our plant. We now work out of his warehouse, and the lead time
is down to minutes,” the purchasing agent reports.

For many years, inventory managers have said that their top inventory-
reduction best practice is the periodic review. Nothing else comes close:
More than three in ﬁve respondents (61.1%) cite reviews as one of their top
ﬁve practices. Equally impressive is that the periodic review has as strong a
favor with inventory management professionals in small and midsize organ-
izations as it does within larger organizations.
The runner-up (49.1%), as in previous years, is more tightly managing
usage rates, lead times, and safety stocks. Driving this practice are respon-
dents from small and midsize organizations with more than half (53.9%) cit-
ing the practice. It is also strong (41.5%) among those in larger organizations
but lags its top selection by 20 percentage points.
Reducing safety stock, as a best practice, soars.
Better accuracy, the application
of technology, and increased collaboration with partners have enabled in-
ventory managers to do a better job of reducing safety stock levels. As proof,
this year’s survey ﬁnds safety stock reduction among the top four, as it has
been in recent years.
However, safety stock reduction achieved the largest increase from a
year ago of any of the 20 practices listed in Table II-2.2. Reacting to their
success in reducing safety stock, respondents listed the practice in increasing
numbers, resulting in a nearly 21% gain.
Cycle counting remains ﬁrm as a top best practice.
Without a doubt, cycle count-
ing has come into its own as a major best practice among inventory manage-
ment professionals. It is a viable technique that has, in many facilities, elim-
inated the annual physical because of its improvements in inventory record
accuracy.
Cycle counting is in the third slot, repeating last year’s performance.
Cycle counting followed up its big leap in last year’s survey, with a slight gain
this year. Although 41.9% of the respondents rank cycle counting among the
top best practices, it is clearly those in the small and midsize facilities who
feel most strongly about it.
Managing inventory via the 80/20 rule gains in application, moves into top ﬁve.
Rounding out the “fabulous ﬁve” inventory reduction best practices is the
ABC approach, or Pareto’s law. After a slight setback in last year’s survey, it

rebounded nicely this year. Signiﬁcantly, those responding from small and
midsize groups and larger facilities are applying it with equal vigor.
Technology-based practices advance, though moderately.
First detected in last
year’s survey, greater application of technology-based practices continues
this year. For example, increased use of bar coding, radio frequency (RF),
and automated identiﬁcation (ID) systems advanced almost four percentage
points to 19.2%. Vendor managed inventory (VMI) practices advanced more
than three percentage points, to 18.6%. In addition, adding inventory-
related hardware and software was marked off by almost two in ﬁve (19.8%)
of the respondents.
Last year’s big performer (up 118.5%), implementing inventory man-
agement systems, fell a few points this time, but it is still signiﬁcantly higher
than it ever has been. 
What the respondents are saying about their best practices.
Besides citing their
best practices, many respondents explained why they made their choice and
how effective it has been. 
• Periodic reviews were conducted. “The periodic review of inventory and
applying reduction initiatives seems to reap the biggest beneﬁts for us,”
maintains the manager of warehousing and distribution at a midsize facility
of a major builder of mining equipment.
• Usage was the focus. “We adopted a more analytical approach to usage
reports, and the application of A, B, C levels enabled us to increase turns and
to achieve national benchmarks,” remarks the director of materials manage-
ment at a small producer of medical devices.
• Intense cycle counting was initiated. “We implemented an intense cycle
counting program that improved our inventory variances by over 75%,” re-
ports an inventory manager at a midsize maker of disposable garments. “We
are now able to reduce our quarterly inventories to semiannual inventories.
We expect to reduce the frequency to an annual inventory.”
• Safety stock reviews are an essential regimen. “I maintain that safety stock
reviews are part of our preferred practices, whether we’re using the 80/20
rule or applying VMI concepts,” explains the purchasing director at a large
builder of home improvement products. “By reviewing order patterns in
conjunction with other inventory reduction practices, we have improved
turns from four to seven in just six months.”
436
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

• Periodic reviews start the entire inventory reduction process. A typical re-
sponse this year reﬂects an important consideration: It often takes more than
one activity to improve one’s inventory reduction efforts.
A materials supervisor at a midsize manufacturer of food-service equip-
ment said it best. “By reviewing ways to reduce inventory, the rest fol-
lowed,” he explains. “We increased communication of our ideas and plans
with the vendors and all in-house departments involved. With the help of
the various departments, safety stocks were reduced and managed better
with the help of cycle counting and reviewing all available information in
determining order quantities.” Overall, WIP and ﬁnished goods inventories
have fallen, and raw materials are “better controlled.”

“Aggressive” and “assertive” best describe the actions taken by inventory
management personnel to further reduce inventories under their control and
direction. Readers responding to our surveys suggest a myriad of practical
ideas that can be applied elsewhere. 
Getting aggressive.
For example, the administrative director of materials
management at a small producer of custom machined parts answered, “The
aggressive use of inventory management techniques allowed for the reduc-
tion of safety stock levels and the reintroduction of consignment programs.”
In addition, the company also took a more analytical approach to usage re-
ports and introduced an A, B, C inventory classiﬁcation system, all of which
enabled them to increase their turns by a factor of three and to achieve na-
tional benchmark levels.
Becoming assertive.
The assistant supervisor of material management at a mid-
size maker of food-service equipment also launched a comprehensive pro-
gram. “By reviewing ways to reduce inventory, the rest followed,” he replied.
“We increased communication and pushed forward with our ideas and plans
with suppliers and all in-house departments involved with inventory. With
the help of the various departments, safety stocks were reduced substantially
and managed better with the help of a new cycle counting program and by
reviewing all available information in determining order quantities.”

Adding technology.
A logistics manager at a small builder of wood products
considers the new warehouse management system (WMS) as the key ele-
ment. “We linked the WMS with the order entry system and RF scanning
to update production and inventory tracking, from order entry to load se-
quencing cargo,” he states. The results to date indicate 5% faster dock times
and a 3% boost in loading accuracy. Overall, he reports 30% lower inventory
of raw materials, 10% less WIP, and 15% fewer ﬁnished goods in stock.
Switching to third party logistics.
“Using their expertise and automated sys-
tems, we have better visibility of what we have where,” maintains the logis-
tics manager at a small facility producing telephone equipment. They are
also using the same provider to establish a distribution facility that will en-
able them to “order closer to the forecast, store sufﬁcient equipment in a
single location, and cut lead times. The nature of the business does not al-
low us to pursue a JIT approach,” he mentions.
Creating a logistics department.
“By centralizing and consolidating outside
carriers, we have saved several millions of dollars,” announces a logistics
manager at a major producer of ﬂuid systems components. “The creation of
a corporate logistics department provided us with the opportunity to take
control of our transportation requirements. Essentially, we substituted im-
proved transportation for actual inventory,” he reports. Shorter transit times
“have just about taken WIP inventory out of our system.”
Moving materials and controls to production.
The material control manager at
a midsize manufacturer of custom electronic control devices reveals that
they have moved inventory control responsibility “to the production people
who consume those components.” 
In another move, they purchased an inventory storage carousel to store
VMI securely on the production ﬂoor. “This created shorter lead times,
smaller carrying costs, greater efﬁciency, and less material handling because
we do not purchase or receive components until we start production,” he
shares. “This was developed through a careful supplier partnership selection
process,” he adds.
Implementing “forward” cycle counting.
“Constantly changing production
schedules and schedules not being far enough ahead caused constant short-
ages and production interruptions,” reports the warehouse/MRP manager
at a small frozen food producer. To solve the problem, “we installed a for-
438
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

ward cycle count based on production schedules. We generated a report out
of our new Fourth Shift MRP program that shows necessary supplies for
production scheduled, which look out over a three-week period.”
Items needed for production are cycle counted three weeks ahead every
time the schedule is updated, regardless of ABC classiﬁcation. “We’ve now
achieved better control over our inventory,” he reports.
Introducing kanban.
A logistics manager at a midsize producer of automo-
tive lighting systems implemented the kanban transfer of packaging material
from dual suppliers. “This regulated the ﬂow of packaging materials with ac-
tual production and our storage space allotment,” he notes. “We eliminated
our stockpiled just-in-case inventories as suppliers now stock and maintain
inventory at their cost. Under this arrangement, we’ve been able to reduce
our carrying costs and signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of line shutdowns and ex-
pedited freight costs due to stockouts,” he answered.
Reviewing inventory, particularly the slow movers.
“We have put together a
program where we periodically review inventory, focusing primarily on the
slow-moving items,” maintains the director of DC replenishment at a large
provider of automotive aftermarket products. “We identify the products and
quantities to process for the return to suppliers, sell at clearance, salvage, or
destroy.” 
These efforts have resulted in a 30% reduction in excess inventory year-
to-date. The process, as he describes, “entitles each analyst to have access to
information on excess quantities and gives them the responsibility to co-
ordinate disposition with suppliers, warehouses, and merchandising.”
Enhancing the cycle counting practice.
“Throughout the year we make exten-
sive use of control groups that focus on the items that seem to give us the
most problems,” states an inventory control manager at a wholesale distrib-
utor of ﬁne fragrances. “Based on their activity, and correcting the sources
of problems they have found, we have been able to increase inventory accu-
racy from 94% to over 97%.”
Shifting inventory to the suppliers.
A purchasing agent at a midsize processor
of seafood cites two examples. “We convinced our corrugated supplier to
warehouse frequently used boxes, which has cut lead time from seven days
to just one day,” he explains. 
In the other example, they helped the ﬁlm supplier warehouse the ﬁlm
IOMA Readers Report What Works
439

near their plant. “We now work out of his warehouse with lead time in the
minutes,” the purchasing agent relates. The company also orders what it
needs instead of getting a full truckload of supplies.
“We have accepted higher freight rates in lieu of storing greater quanti-
ties of inventory. To date the savings in carrying cost far outweigh the higher
freight rates we pay,” he explains.
Establishing A, B, C inventory classiﬁcations.
“We’re in the process of classi-
fying all of the inventory throughout our seven plants in the United States,”
reports a division purchasing manager at a large producer of bronze memo-
rials. “We’re establishing the maximum inventories allowed based on an A,
B, C inventory segmentation and are monitoring buyers’ responses to these
objectives.”
This was done on a monthly basis as well as year-to-date in the facilities
where they have installed the system. Total inventory reduction during the
last ﬁscal year was in excess of $500,000. 
Moving to synchronous ﬂow manufacturing.
The materials manager at a small
manufacturer of ﬂexible packaging explains that by adopting the ﬂow con-
cept, lead times have decreased signiﬁcantly. “In a matter of three months
we have reduced our ﬁnished goods inventory by 30% and WIP by 25%,”
he explains.
However, he also reports difﬁculty in forecasting the need for raw ma-
terials, which has necessitated a 10% increase in inventory. The reason, he
states, is that “customer lead times are now shorter than the raw material lead
times.” He is in the process of resolving the problem by developing a his-
torical raw material forecast and utilizing vendor consignment stock pro-
grams “to the fullest.”

Used by more than three in ﬁve (61.1%) of our survey respondents, inven-
tory review is the most universally practiced inventory management tech-
nique. What makes periodic inventory reviews so popular—and effective?
In some cases, it is the pure simplicity of the installed process. For instance,
at some facilities the review process is as simple as walking the facility and
440
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

visually checking the inventory, or color-coded tags. At the other extreme,
teams led by upper management review reports and studies and determine
actions to be taken to deplete slow-moving inventory.
Inventory management professionals continue to broaden the scope of
reviews and integrate them for an even more sophisticated, innovative prac-
tice. In addition, periodic reviews work because of the constant focus they
place on inventory. It’s the awareness thing. For instance, a material control
supervisor at a small producer of electrical grounding products says, “We fo-
cus our attention on high-cost items that have high days of inventory.” The
organization’s planners continually review the days of inventory at the item
level, focusing on high-cost items, and recommend methods for their re-
duction.
A transportation manager at a large producer of paper products reports,
“We review inventory in relation to sales forecasts and have signiﬁcantly re-
duced C, D, and E items that had accumulated over time.” 
Meanwhile, other survey respondents have provided more details on
their individual programs for reviewing inventory and the beneﬁts they re-
ceive. Their comments might spark a few ideas for you to consider and im-
plement at your location.
Alert sales and planning staffs.
“Our inventory review may be manual,” says
a global logistics manager at a large producer of computer chips, “but it has
proven itself to be the most effective tool in keeping the available inventory
in front of our sales and planning people.” He notes that managing the ex-
pectations between sales and planning and their tendency to overstock had
always been a “major headache.” He adds, “Sales always forecast too opti-
mistically, while planning always wants safety stock.” Today, the review pro-
cess is critical to the identiﬁcation and formalization of the reduction op-
portunities available, he says.
“We hold monthly meetings with people from sales/marketing, pro-
duction, purchasing, and other areas to review the current month’s sales
forecast,” maintains the ﬁnance vice president at a small maker of naviga-
tional equipment. “From this the production plan is adjusted by item to
achieve agreed-to safety levels for ﬁnished goods. This plan is then fed to the
MRP system,” she details.
Identify slow-moving stock.
“We periodically review our inventory and focus
on identifying slow-moving product and quantity,” explains a DC re-
plenishment director at a provider of aftermarket automotive parts. The
IOMA Readers Report What Works
441

identiﬁed stock is then processed for return to vendors, offered for clearance,
salvaged, or destroyed.
“Our system provides each of our inventory analysts with access to in-
formation on excess quantities,” he explains. “They then have the responsi-
bility to coordinate its disposition with the vendors, warehouses, and mer-
chandizing.” In its ﬁrst year of operation, excess inventory was reduced by
more than 30%.
The production and inventory control manager at a large maker of plas-
tic containers shares, “We bring in our top guns biweekly to look at slow-
moving and obsolete inventory.” The inventory management committee is
chaired by the director of sales and includes the production and inventory
control manager, customer service manager, and marketing director. After
the review, the committee assigns “appropriate account executives to dis-
pose of the inventory.” In the ﬁrst year of existence, the team has disposed of
$1.5 million in inventory, which represents an inventory reduction of 15%.
Inventory reduction starts with the review process.
“By reviewing ways to re-
duce inventory, the rest follows,” declares an assistant supervisor at a small
manufacturer of food-service equipment. “The process gets all of our in-
house departments involved, and we’ve been able to increase our internal
communication of ideas and plans and to share them with our vendors.” For
example, with improved forecast accuracy and better production schedul-
ing, they have enjoyed a signiﬁcant reduction in the safety stock of their ﬁn-
ished goods inventory. “With the help of various departments, safety stocks
were reduced and are now managed better with the application of cycle
counting and reviewing all available information in determining order quan-
tities,” he explains.
A new materials manager at a midsize producer of electrical distribution
systems had to increase the awareness of inventory and what it costs within
the organization. “There was little to no focus on inventory reduction with
my predecessor,” he claims. “As part of my inventory awareness campaign,
we began to perform periodic inventory reviews with material planners.
They also have a key hand in determining the ways we reduce these inven-
tory levels.”
Inventory sliced by half with no downtime due to shortages.
“We have a well-
planned, vigorous, site-by-site review of inventories to identify and dispose
of excess based on usage rates,” maintains a materials leader at a large electric
utility. Regional inventory has been pared 50%, without any adverse impact.
442
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

“Concurrently, we continuously review the 20% of items that make up 80%
of activity to ensure we maintain the appropriate stocking levels,” he explains.
Eliminate the associated carrying cost of building excessive stocks.
“We use the
team approach to periodically review our inventory status and then meet to
discuss ways of removing items from stock to eliminate carrying cost,” an in-
ventory manager at a midsize maker of electrical safety equipment explains.
“In our review, we take stock usage into consideration.”
Although he does not quantify any speciﬁc savings, he does allow that
the “overall result is a lot more space, more accurate inventory control, and
a signiﬁcant reduction in carrying cost.”
The focus is on the A items.
A processing administrator at a large heating,
ventilating, and air conditioning metal former says, “We have undertaken a
massive initiative to lower our inventory, which has the commitment and
support of our top management.” The essential element of the initiative is a
monthly review of A-class inventory items, measuring both inventory turns
and days on hand.
The outgrowth is a “sit-down” with the supplier community to “have
them understand our goals of inventory reduction, and how they can assist
by reducing their lead times. Simultaneously, we’ve also cut down on our
order quantities, while asking the suppliers to increase the number of deliv-
eries,” he details. “The suppliers are all just about on board, and we’re just
beginning to see progress.”
Look in all the right (high-dollar-value) places.
A contracts administrator at a
major health care provider reviewed inventory in departments with high-
dollar equipment and supplies, such as the operating rooms, radiology, and
labor and delivery. “We reviewed the most recent 18-month usage history
on each item we identiﬁed and determined what the ‘pars’ should be,” he
explains. This action reduced inventory investment by $500,000 in the ﬁrst
nine months.
“To ensure that the departments do not stockpile equipment and sup-
plies, we review the par levels semiannually,” he offers. “We also routinely
review items that are requested for the store warehouse. Our goal is to keep
the turn ratio at 14 for these items.” As part of the review process, they
benchmark procedures at comparable hospitals. “We assign teams, review
what supplies are used, and have further reduced our inventory status by
changing several of our practices,” he notes.

443

Review process reduces inventory by 20%.
“Our mantra is to reduce inventory
levels while maintaining high customer service levels,” mentions a ware-
house and distribution manager at a midsize facility producing mining
equipment. “We do periodic reviews and have reduced inventory on the
items having a low usage frequency. We also micromanage—by using the
review process results—the top 100 parts having the most activity so we can
achieve a 100% ﬁll rate on these top-tier items.”
Reviews determine whether turns are achieving objectives.
A plant manager at a small
specialty chemical producer explains that the “inventory review process has
been very successful for our company.” She mentions that the “nature of our
business allows us to rework or ‘requalify’ material for another use or custom-
er.” Additionally, she “totally scrutinizes our inventory turns to make sure the
inventory doesn’t just sit here, and is being used in the most proﬁtable ways.” 
MRO inventory comes under scrutiny.
“We consider an item that has not
turned in two years to be obsolete, and we get it out of inventory,” a pur-
chasing manager at a large meat processing facility explains. “We’ve intro-
duced a review process that we conduct with our maintenance staff to de-
termine whether a part or material is still a valid inventory item.”
In line with this, another consideration is the installation time of high
carrying cost parts and equipment. “If the installation time is greater than 30
minutes, we make arrangements for the local vendor to stock the item rather
than have it on our ﬂoor,” the purchasing manager states.
Complete review of all inventory at all locations. “The most successful inventory
reduction idea we use is to review all planning levels at all locations,” shares
the logistics vice president at a midsize maker of fasteners. “We reviewed all
lead times from suppliers, all lead times between stocking locations, and
changed the replenishment frequency for many locations.” The net result
was lower planned minimum levels and lower actual inventories. “We took
out $5 million by doing this,” he exclaims.
Constant review of MRP parameters.
A materials manager of a small producer
of mechanical systems for the automotive industry notes, “We’re regularly
reviewing the MRP planning parameters, such as safety stock, safety lead
times, minimum buy/builds, and similar measures. We also include planning
of OE service and aftermarket needs to minimize our obsolete inventory and
to reduce our raw materials inventory,” he describes.

Third-party logistics provider is a believer in periodic reviews. “We’re always ana-
lyzing the inventory and placing it into A, B, C, and D categories based on
sales and velocity,” explains the general manager of a midsize third-party
provider facility. “Based on this analysis we determine the distribution strate-
gies for each, such as direct ship, cross-docking A and B items, and ware-
housing appropriate quantities for those classiﬁed as B and C.”
Reviews conducted by family groups.
“The most successful inventory reduc-
tion technique we instituted was to complete reviews of ﬁnished goods in
which we grouped the SKUs by family.” That enabled a team from sales,
marketing, and quality assurance to review the mix issues in greater detail,
while the overall quantity issues were reviewed and acted upon by family.
Weekly review monitors inventory status.
A materials manager at a midsize
manufacturer of capital equipment for the semiconductor industry uses the
weekly A, B, C report to monitor and analyze the inventory situation. “By
downloading the report to Excel spreadsheets, we are able to use many sorts
to identify problems and excess in the inventory. This enables purchasing to
refocus its buying and planning effort.”
Using periodic reviews to establish ﬂow manufacturing.
A superintendent at a large
manufacturer of ofﬁce furniture constantly reviews inventory levels to deter-
mine project and manufacturing priority. “A review of the inventory proﬁle
enables me to determine which projects I will run that will yield manufactur-
ing processes that are linked, and will give us one piece ﬂow,” he details.
Putting inventory performance on display.
“We put inventory ratios on a chart
each week and display them prominently throughout the facility,” explains
a materials manager at a midsize producer of sensors. “At our weekly de-
partment meetings we review all inventory categories and discuss the pres-
ent and emerging situations in an effort to further reduce our inventory lev-
els,” he explains. To date, they have reduced inventory by $500,000, while
enjoying increasing sales of almost $1 million per month.
Weekly team meetings discuss one topic: how to reduce inventory.
The manufac-
turing vice president at a small machine tool builder holds weekly inventory
reduction meetings with his various teams. “At these sessions we review the
receipts of all A items, those costing over $500,” he explains. Further, they
have installed software that identiﬁes new obsolete items on a weekly basis.

Inventory reviews help to boost customer service and return on assets (ROA).
“In-
ventory management, because it is such a key driver for both customer ser-
vice and ROA, is receiving greater attention via frequent periodic reviews,”
says the senior vice president of logistics at a major producer of electronic
systems and assemblies. “Since we’ve instituted the review process, we’ve
been able to reduce old, obsolete stocks, measure our vendors’ ﬁll rates, and
establish consignment inventory programs,” he adds.
Periodic reviews help reduce lead times.
An inventory manager at a small maker
of components for farming implements has in place a process that reviews
“appropriate” levels of lead times. It also stratiﬁes individual suppliers and
parts within each supplier to locate where the inventory and safety stock is
building. “The review process has enabled us to meet with the suppliers and
cite potential lead-time reduction projects,” he states.
Inventory review lessens cash ﬂow cycle time.
The logistics optimization man-
ager at a large chemicals facility credits their monthly review for reducing
inventory levels between 25% to 40%. “The monthly metric review and
business leader accountability for meeting the objective has had the impact
of reducing our cash ﬂow cycle time signiﬁcantly,” he offers. “It also has had
a dramatic impact on our bottom line.”

Cycle counting continues to be among the top inventory management prac-
tices. The increasing popularity and application of cycle counting is due to
its potential for being the preeminent way to improve inventory record ac-
curacy, while also becoming a highly effective inventory reduction tool. Our
reader surveys ﬁnd that more than two in ﬁve (41.9%) respondents cite cycle
counting as one of their most successful techniques for controlling and re-
ducing inventory (see Table II-2.2).
Snapshots of what inventory managers are saying.
It is now solidly placed in the
number three slot, behind periodic inventory reviews and managing usage
rates, lead times, and safety stocks more tightly. Just four years earlier, fewer
than 30% of respondents recognized cycle counting as a primary inventory
446

accuracy and reduction tool. Among the more common themes in the lat-
est survey responses were the following:
• “Enhanced cycle counting practices have reduced our plus and mi-
nus inventory mistakes,” reports an inventory control manager at a midsize
manufacturer of medical equipment. “We catch errors before they affect to-
tal inventory.”
• “Inventory accuracy was once a major problem for us,” offers a ma-
terials resource leader at a large builder of diesel engines. “Today we cycle
count daily, and our material schedulers verify, at least once a week, our JIT
inventory.”
• “Since introducing cycle counting just over a year ago, we have seen
our service levels improve and accountability increase,” mentions a supply/
inventory technician at a small maintenance services organization. “Through
cycle counting, we are now able to identify areas for improvement.” 
• “Cycle counting has greatly reduced the amount of inventory on-
hand by providing us with accurate, real-time balances,” declares an inven-
tory manager at a large electronics manufacturer.
• “With cycle counting, our inventory accuracy went from 70% to
93%,” says a director of materials at a midsize producer of signal processing
equipment. An ancillary beneﬁt was that the “entire facility became more
aware of inventory issues.” 
Applications and Results
Many respondents described in detail their application of cycle counting. A
sample:
• Cycle counting by SKU and location. The operations vice president at a
midsize producer of ceramic tile explains, “We have reintroduced a cycle
counting program into our operations using dual criteria, by SKU, and by
location.” With one dedicated manager and two counters, they have been
able to drive their inventory accuracy to 98.3% after only three months.
• Focusing efforts on items that seem to generate the most problems. “We’re
reemphasizing our cycle counting procedure,” maintains an inventory con-
trol manager at a wholesale distributor. “Throughout the year we make ex-
tensive use of control groups that include the items we seem to have most
problems with.” Working with these control groups, they have been able to
IOMA Readers Report What Works
447

uncover problems related to outdated procedures that they are currently re-
vising. Overall, he notes, “We have improved inventory accuracy, up to a
consistent 97%.”
• Implementing a forward cycle count. The warehouse/MRP manager at a
frozen food producer describes the process: “We generate a report from our
Fourth Shift MRP program that shows all necessary supplies for the pro-
duction schedule, which is kept three weeks ahead of the present. Items
needed for production are cycle counted three weeks ahead every time the
schedule is updated, regardless of ABC classiﬁcation.” 
• Cycle counting only items that show an activity. “We have recently begun
counting bins every morning on only those times that had some activity as-
sociated with them, such as issues, receipts, the previous day,” says a stores
supervisor at a manufacturer of newsprint. 
• Daily cycle counts now routine. An inventory control manager at a large
food processing facility combines daily cycle counts with a “very friendly
warehouse management system.” The reasoning behind this, he notes, is that
“as a company, we did not have control over our inventories. This translated
into our service levels to customers being about 90%, which was not entirely
acceptable.” The new process, he notes, has a 98% service level.
• A most beneﬁcial strategy. “Cycle counting prevents us from becoming
overwhelmed at the end of every month and provides up-to-the-minute re-
porting on a number of raw materials,” says a material control supervisor at
a small producer of wood laminates. He credits cycle counting and improved
sales forecasting for signiﬁcant inventory reductions.
• Cycle counting improves inventory variances by 75%. “We implemented
an intense cycle counting program that signiﬁcantly improved our inventory
accuracy,” says an inventory manager at a small manufacturer of disposable
garments. “We have been able to reduce our quarterly inventories to semi-
annual inventories, and look to doing only an annual.”
• Inventory reduction of $200,000 credited to cycle counting. The purchasing
manager at a small producer of laser-engraved promotional items notes a
high level of inventory reduction (up to 40% in WIP and 30% in ﬁnished
goods) since instituting cycle counting procedures. “We’re now using cycle
counting procedures rather than biennial counts,” he explains.
• Stockouts down, accuracy up. According to a buyer at a small producer
of rubber and urethane custom molding, “cycle counting has greatly im-
448
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

proved the accuracy of our inventory, thus reducing stockouts. The more ac-
curate the inventory, the better we are at managing it.”
• Cycle counting lends assistance in reducing safety stocks. The materials
management vice president at a large facility that produces food products ex-
plains that they have instituted cycle counts to “verify critical ingredients
prior to the production run. This has reduced, by a signiﬁcant factor, the
amount of safety stock we now require.”

Our readers are among the leading practitioners in adopting and adapting
cutting-edge inventory management ideas. We culled the following tips
from responses to our recent survey, in which participants indicated the
“single most successful best practice they implemented over the past year.”
Here’s what’s keeping your colleagues, and competitors, ahead.
Introducing kanban.
“We implemented a kanban system to pull selected ma-
terials through the system and to establish min/max order quantities,” ex-
plains a warehouse and distribution manager at a small producer of electrical
wire for the automotive and white goods industries. “We began with the raw
materials required for speciﬁc products manufactured in-house.” They re-
cruited a cross-functional team that was given the authority to select the end
products, establish the procedures, and implement the process. The team also
was heavily involved in tracking the results. “The cost savings are signiﬁcant,
and more than we had hoped for, but remain proprietary,” he states.
Shifting inventory ownership.
A warehouse supervisor at a midsize manufac-
turer of railroad maintenance equipment states, “Our business encounters
numerous engineering change orders, so by shifting inventory ownership to
the suppliers, we do not need to invest large amounts of dollars in parts and
materials.” The supplier carries a maximum three-month supply of inventory,
for which the buyer is responsible. “In this manner, neither the supplier nor
we have a major investment risk should there be an ECN issued,” he explains.
Enhancing cycle counting.
“We have instituted a procedure whereby we now
fully count A items three times a year, B items twice, and C parts only once
IOMA Readers Report What Works
449

each year,” explains a materials services manager at a major builder of aircraft
engine cases. “We have also introduced a spot check from accounting once
a month to validate what we do weekly.”
The inventory control specialist for a transportation/salvage company in
Missouri says, “My company has made major strides toward overall inven-
tory control. We started a system of pricing product by UPC so that we
could control shrink levels. We also use a cycle counting process that will
eliminate three physical counts per year.”
Applying ABC classiﬁcation system.
The inventory control coordinator at an
assembler of communications equipment and systems reports that very little
effort was expended in the past to control ﬁnished goods inventory. How-
ever, in the past several months they “began implementing the ABC ap-
proach in combination with cycle counting to reduce inventory and to elim-
inate biannual physical counts,” she says. The preliminary results have seen
an increase in inventory record accuracy, which is beginning to translate into
lower inventory requirements.
Introducing the VMI concept.
“By having the suppliers of our critical materi-
als in charge of managing and replenishing our stock, the process enables us
to maximize our run schedules and equipment usage,” explains the vice
president of transportation at a small milling operation. “There’s an addi-
tional beneﬁt for the suppliers, who also report better control over their in-
ventory and more efﬁcient use of their production lines.” In addition, the
transportation executive also has shifted deliveries recently to late evening or
early morning hours in an effort to improve equipment productivity further.
“Vendor managed inventories have saved us hundreds of thousands in
inventory carrying costs,” says a logistics manager for a door and skylight
manufacturer in Maine.
Switching to consigned inventory.
The purchasing manager at a midsize man-
ufacturer of rolling maintenance stock entered into a consignment inventory
agreement with seven suppliers. “Quite frankly, we had difﬁculty in getting
storeroom, assembly, and factory employees adjusted to the new consign-
ment program,” he admits. However, after instituting an education and
training program, they came around and are working with it. Overall, the
purchasing manager points out, in the year and a half that the consignment
inventory agreements have been in place, the credit to inventory has been
well over $1 million.

Using JIT buying techniques.
“The most successful idea that we have imple-
mented in the past 12 months has been the JIT buying process,” offers the
inventory manager at a midsize automotive OEM supplier of control sys-
tems. “Our suppliers ship to us when they receive a faxed ‘pull’ signal,” he
explains. “This keeps our inventory levels at a predetermined level and elim-
inates the buildup of excess materials.”
Better forecasting for demand planning.
Software programs that track histori-
cal customer demand are a common solution to excess inventory. For ex-
ample, “We implemented forecasting and distribution system requirements
planning [DSRP] software,” says the vice president of corporate logistics for
a retail home furnishings company in New York. “We justiﬁed its purchase
with payback in terms of inventory reduction. Within the ﬁrst four months,
inventory decreased from 29,500 pieces at $5.1 million to 26,400 pieces at
$4.1 million with no impact on customer service or stock outs.”
Reducing damage and theft.
This is a subject that most inventory managers
would rather not discuss—inventory shrinkage—through illegal or unsafe
conditions. However, the inventory supervisor at a cigarette manufacturing
and distribution facility agreed that the most focused effort was in the re-
duction of damage and theft.
“This basically entails gaining control of the inventory and storage facil-
ities, as we have found out through our investigation that theft and damage
occur when controls are loose,” he details. “This is a company with an an-
nual growth rate that ranges between 30% to 80%, so inventory was scattered
throughout the facility, and our control procedures were minimal at best,”
the inventory supervisor concedes. “I am still in the process of implement-
ing additional advanced security procedures. What we’ve done to date,
which I won’t discuss for obvious reasons, is paying off rather handsomely in
cutting back on the amount of theft.”
To reduce inventory and product damage, he has assigned several teams
to inspect storage areas routinely, loading and unloading docks, and the plant
ﬂoor. Their purpose is to identify and document potential hazards or unsafe
conditions, photograph them, and recommend improvements. For instance,
in one case they had to rewrite their stacking and binding procedures.
Moving inventory to a secure location.
“We have had to take control of the
inventory and move it to a caged location, where we can now issue it to
the appropriate shop order,” says a material control manager at a small
IOMA Readers Report What Works
451

manufacturer of automation machinery. “This gives the inventory depart-
ment better control over the materials and tools. It also enables inventory
personnel to improve their cycle counting process without having to hunt
all over the shop for the inventory, and it prevents theft, which has emerged
as a problem. The cage is under lock and key.”
Kitting of material.
A materials manager at a gas and electric utility has a sup-
plier who provides prepared kits of speciﬁc materials for individual jobs.
“The kits make it easier in that the various parts are not put into inventory
and picked by our operators, making the operations more efﬁcient and con-
trollable,” he explains. In addition, all materials requests for speciﬁc jobs are
sent to the supplier via EDI transactions.
Hiring additional personnel.
“We were at a point where we had to upgrade
our staff in the materials department,” says the logistics director at a small
maker of medical devices. The company hired a materials manager and a
supply chain analyst. “For the ﬁrst time, with these hires, we had individu-
als whose primary responsibility was inventory management,” he declares.
Since they have been on the job, he notes, they have been responsible for
reducing excess/obsolete inventory by more than 50%, which represents
about $3.5 million. They introduced such techniques as publishing an in-
ternal distressed-inventory price book and partnering with third-party med-
ical equipment resellers who focus on the international community.
Focusing on inventory reduction.
This received a lot of mention from respon-
dents. Essentially, organizations went on a blitz, either through education
and training or through concentrated communication campaigns to raise
employee awareness about inventory. “We explained the importance of in-
ventory, its role and costs,” maintains a production and inventory control di-
rector at a midsize manufacturer of fasteners. “We pointed out penalties as-
sociated with obsolete, excess, and off-spec inventories.” The campaign is a
success: They have reduced inventory across the board by almost 60%.
Make sure everyone knows his or her role. Forging tight interdepart-
mental, as well as external, relationships can ensure that all supply chain par-
ticipants understand the common goal of reducing inventory. This has
proven extremely helpful for the logistics manager of an Illinois-based man-
ufacturing company. He explains, “We secured standard inventory proce-
dures so each department had a complete understanding of their responsi-
bilities and how they ﬁt into the supply chain.”

Many Inventory Reduction Report readers maintain that MRP II systems, bar
coding applications, and other “technologies” are the “single, most success-
ful” inventory control/reduction mechanism they instituted during the past
year. The irony is that for many years these selections remained dormant,
suddenly to emerge in the most recent reader survey that we conducted.
Although we are not about to predict a surge in these activities just yet,
we believe that the rationale for this surge is of interest to other inventory
management professionals. Following are comments and experiences of sev-
eral respondents who have moved in this direction.
Driving inventory costs down by one-third.
The materials manager at a small
remanufacturer of turbochargers declares, “We needed to change from a us-
age-based purchasing method to a market-driven system. With the launch
of the MRP II module to our new ERP system, we anticipate a cost savings
from inventory reduction to be about 30%.” Their goal, he describes, is to
generate more accurate bills of material (BOMs), scrub the database, and get
a more accurate sales forecast. 
Organizing a simpler part numbering system.
“The installation of the MRP II
software forced us to develop a part numbering system and also to reorgan-
ize our inventory,” maintains an inventory manager at a small producer of
satellite communications systems. “The MRP II manufacturing software
forced us to organize our inventory by developing a simple part numbering
system. It also has made us more efﬁcient in tracking inventory with our sub-
contractors.” He adds, “The software has driven us to achieve inventory ac-
curacy greater than 95% consistently.”
Creating a balance between supply and demand.
“We’ve gone the MRP II
route as we’re working diligently to combine customer requirements infor-
mation with supplier production information to achieve the perfect balance
of inventory,” maintains a materials manager at a midsize producer of ﬂex-
ible packaging.
Doing quick cycle counts via bar coding.
A purchasing coordinator at a small
manufacturer of powder coatings notes that when initially implementing bar
IOMA Readers Report What Works
453

coding, it was difﬁcult to indoctrinate the employees because of a number
of computer glitches. However, that has all been overcome. As he relates,
“with the bar code scanners, we now can do quick cycle counts to give us
more accurate inventory readouts.” They have also been able to reduce their
safety stock levels and save hours every day by eliminating visual counts.
Tracking inventory through the production process.
“We are a printing company
that had trouble tracking inventory once it went to press,” the inven-
tory/warehouse material manager at a midsize printer reports. “Prior to bar
coding we had no method of tracking the waste involved in printing, or how
much paper remained from the original order once the job was complete.”
Eliminating the physical inventory with RF technology.
Radio frequency tech-
nology is another application that readers highlighted. As an example, the
inventory administrator at a large manufacturer of consumer products de-
clares, “The addition of RF technology to our current systems is producing
outstanding results.” He explains, “We’re now using ABC cycle counting in
our RF-equipped warehouse, which has enabled us to eliminate our physi-
cal inventory, reduce machine downtime, and increase our inventory accu-
racy to 99.2%”
Providing real-time control of inventory.
In another application, an inventory
manager at a midsize plastics manufacturer installed in-house developed
software to work between RF terminals and AS400 software. He explains,
“We installed RF terminals on all 17 forklifts to provide live-time control of
inventory from the production belt to shipping docks.”
Standardizing the planning parameter input process.
“The toughest thing is get-
ting good data from our ERP systems,” contends a logistics analyst at a large
producer of automation systems. “We have the same program in many dif-
ferent countries, but the way they use it varies just enough to make standard
inventory programs challenging.”
In Mexico, they automated the planning parameter process (forecasts,
economic order quantity, safety stock, ABC). “This replaced the anecdotal
approach that people tend to use,” he says. As a result, inventory turns im-
proved by 50% while customer service remained steady.
Tying different processes together with an ERP system.
Few readers talk about
their successes with ERP installations and better inventory control. How-
454

ever, a logistics manager at a midsize manufacturer of glassware explains,
“We’ve been implementing an ERP system over the past couple of years. It
has allowed us to better plan inventories of ﬁnished goods and all compo-
nents.” 
They opted for a commercial system that ties all their computer systems
together, rather than go the custom route. “This arrangement will enable us
to upgrade the system as needed,” he relates. Also, they are currently inves-
tigating the implementation of VMI on some items and moving to a new bar
code system.

Purchasing professionals are now taking charge and helping to lead the ef-
fort to reduce inventory. While always a force in controlling inventory in-
vestment, Supplier Selection and Management Report surveys show a trend to-
ward more sophisticated and strategic initiatives, as opposed to simply
moving the inventory back up the supply chain. 
A shade less than one in three (32.6%) say that they are focusing on in-
ventory management. In addition, those having inventory management re-
sponsibilities are excelling in their new roles. This is not happening only at
the largest ﬁrms, as Figure II-2.1 shows. The following is a sample of the ex-
periences shared by the respondents of what is being done.
Shifting Inventory to Suppliers
The most widely practiced technique that these purchasing professionals use
is to move the inventory back to the supplier, or to shift its ownership up-
stream. “Our eventual goal was to shift the majority of our inventory needs
to the supplier community,” explains the purchasing manager at a midsize
educational facility. “We began by working with a supplier of ofﬁce supplies
ﬁrst, during which we were able to work out the wrinkles in our process,”
he reports. “Then we began a deliberate process of introducing the concept
and its beneﬁts to the remainder of our MRO suppliers.”
A natural evolution produced a consolidation of the supplier base.
“With fewer suppliers, we were able to increase our volume. This led to bet-
ter pricing and a vast improvement in delivery performance, effecting a po-
sition where we have very little of on-hand inventory,” he explains.

Sharing Information with Suppliers
The MRO purchasing manager at a small maker of footwear praises the idea
of working more closely with the supplier community. “We have substan-
tially reduced our in-house inventory levels and costs,” she says. “This has
been accomplished by working more closely with the suppliers and by hav-
ing more frequent meetings between their representatives and ours.”
Improving communications by sharing more information works for the
director of purchasing at a large producer of large-diameter pipes and ﬁt-
tings. He declares that their best strategy has been to provide their plans and
schedules to suppliers. “This procedure has enabled the suppliers to improve
their delivery performance, which has led us to reduce the number of stock-
outs we experience.” 
“The cooperation between the suppliers and the plant personnel has im-
proved signiﬁcantly. And the sharing of information has been expanded to
include our suppliers’ second- and third-tier suppliers as well.” He estimates
the overall savings at a minimum of 15%.
Sharing can extend to copies of the MRP. A purchasing manager at a
midsize producer of medical disposal products indicates that they provide
their major suppliers with their own copies of the MRP for a rolling six-
month horizon.

Inventory Reduction Becomes a Major Thrust
for Purchasing Professionals

“They commit out for raw materials and produce one- to two-month re-
quirements,” she explains. This reduces both the suppliers’ and the manufac-
turer’s inventory. “The added beneﬁt is that the process also reduces the like-
lihood of obsolescence and allows the suppliers to produce on mutually agreed
upon EOQs [economic order quantities],” the purchasing manager explains.
Reaping Other Benefits
Managers ﬁnd that they achieve numerous other beneﬁts in the process of
working more closely with suppliers and shifting inventory upstream: 
• Building a stronger supply chain. “Having our suppliers take responsi-
bility for inventory has not only reduced our inventory levels signiﬁcantly,
but the participating companies have brought their expertise to the table and
are helping us to manage our inventories better,” proclaims a purchasing
manager at a large food processor.
• Shortening the original lead times. “Packaging materials are now stored
at the supplier using a min/max quantity,” says a purchasing manager at a
midsize facility that processes aluminum coils. “The supplier must have a
minimum number in stock at all times but may build to the maximum level.”
Not only has switching the inventory to the supplier been beneﬁcial in re-
ducing the dollars invested in inventory, but it also has reduced the original
lead times “by a substantial number.”
• Reducing storage space requirements. A supervisor of central supply at a
midsize converter of transportation equipment explains, “By moving the in-
ventory to our suppliers, we have decreased the amount of storage area we
previously needed, and now only order what we need,” she offers. “We ad-
vise the supplier what our monthly usage is, and they keep this amount in
stock at their location.”
• Improving the cash ﬂow situation. “By shifting inventories onto our sup-
pliers, we have essentially established a JIT program that also improved our
cash ﬂow,” explains the purchasing manager at a small producer of medical
lasers. “Our schedules also were easily manipulated, and the economic
quantity to build was placed with the supplier.”
• Establishing a consignment inventory protocol. “Even though we shifted
our inventory ownership to the suppliers, it was actually accomplished
through consignment inventory that we held on our premises,” explains
a materials manager at a small maker of carbon and graphite specialty
IOMA Readers Report What Works
457

products. “There are several advantages that have translated into a series of
cost savings.” They include
• Lead time is reduced to zero.
• Inventory carrying costs are reduced to zero.
• Lost production time waiting for incoming quality approval is elim-
inated.
• Lower pricing was negotiated in exchange for the long-term supply
agreement.
The purchasing manager at a midsize publishing house that has initiated
a consignment program for the strapping process adds, “The savings are not
major, just $5,000 per year, but we no longer are faced with shipping costs
and inventory costs, as we pay for what we use, when we use it.”
Meeting Challenges with Many Other Techniques
Purchasing management is not by any means restricted to curing inventory
problems only by shifting the inventory upstream to its supplier base. Read-
ers report many inventory reduction ideas and experiences that they have
successfully implemented. Among them are
• Installing a kanban process. “We are a custom manufacturer of capital
equipment, which makes it difﬁcult to utilize a pull system,” explains a pur-
chasing manager at a large builder of machine tools. “However, we have
worked out the system and supplier issues and are in the midst of imple-
menting a kanban process. We believe it will have a signiﬁcant impact on our
inventory levels and carrying costs,” he believes.
• Expanding application of external kanbans. “We use JIT with external
kanban for more components and external supplier consignment inventory
control,” says the president of a midsize manufacturer of specialty machine
tools. “We also take advantage of electronic replenishment technology and
self-billing invoice creation to move inventory turns from three to ten.” 
He adds, “Our new procedures also have reduced the number of POs
[purchase orders] issued from 5,000 per month to less than 2,000. This re-
quires excellent control of bills of materials, engineering changes, and in-
ventory management.”
• Implementing an auto-replenishment system. The procurement director
at a small maker of broadcast test equipment partially resolved the company’s
458
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

inventory management challenge through blanket orders, which focused
on the quantity, but not the delivery. “The implementation of an auto-
replenishment system, which places the burden of inventory on the supplier
for delivery, took care of the balance,” he explains. “Inventory turns have in-
creased dramatically on 150 of the 300 parts we currently have assigned on
auto-replenishment.”
• Implementing EDI. “Our suppliers are now managing their products
in our facilities and promising deliveries that are much improved than pre-
viously,” reports a scheduling supervisor at a midsize manufacturer of light
ﬁxtures. “Lead-time issues have caused us to have either too much or not
enough parts and materials. By implementing EDI we’ve been able to save
a considerable amount of time and money as our inventory levels are lower,
costs are down, and customer service is moving up.” They are not stopping
there, however. The supervisor continues, “We’re now pushing our suppli-
ers to open miniwarehouses and distribution points so that they can supply
us more often with smaller lots.”
• Using better forecasting tools. “On a corporate basis, it was customary to
replenish and buy inventoried items in quantities that were sure to last more
than a year,” states a contracting specialist at a ﬁnancial services organization.
“To correct the situation, we recently began a program to educate the req-
uisitioners and buyers about excess inventory. We provided them with fore-
casting tools that used both historical and promotional data to better project
buying needs,” she explains. The result has been a 50% reduction in inven-
tory levels.
• Reducing the supplier base. “We also write more blanket orders with the
fewer suppliers we have,” a commodity manager at a small manufacturer of
adhesive products reports. “The change has enabled us to bring the suppli-
ers into a JIT process that is reducing our inventories, which we carry at a
28% cost rate presently.”
• Storing material at point of use. “We’ve switched to an assemble-to-
order process in our manufacturing area and introduced the kanban replen-
ishment process as well,” maintains the director of materials management at
a small converter of transportation equipment. “Since beginning the process,
which has the supplier delivering the stock to its point of use, we’ve reduced
our inventory by 25%.”
• Focusing on A and B inventory. The procurement manager of a midsize
manufacturer of medical equipment reveals, “We’ve established JIT/kanban
for certain class inventories. Through the new procedures, we have been
IOMA Readers Report What Works
459

able to reduce our inventories by 20%. In addition, we are starting to send
suppliers Excel spreadsheets via e-mail with our forecast attached. Eventu-
ally, we want to implement EDI, and several suppliers already have volun-
teered to be our beta site,” he details.
• Introducing VMI. “We’ve implemented a JIT and consignment stock
program for laboratory chemicals and supplies,” explains the director of pur-
chasing and logistics at a large pharmaceutical organization. “We’re also bar
coding our MRO and supplies, with the system being provided by our pri-
mary laboratory supplier. It’s the key part of our new VMI program.”
“The organization and oversight of our VMI program has been as-
signed to one person who has the primary responsibility of dealing with
and managing the VMI suppliers,” maintains a buyer at a midsize pro-
ducer of synthetic fiber. With the VMI program, she relates, “We’ve re-
duced the number of suppliers and lowered the number of POs and
monthly billing.”
• Bar coding reduces inventory levels and cycle time. “Since asking our sup-
pliers to bar code products and packages, we have reduced the time that is
required to receive inventory into our computer system,” explains the pur-
chasing manager at a large manufacturer of machinery components. “It has
improved our inventory accuracy, which impacts our inventory levels.” Ad-
ditionally, the reduced inventory levels have opened warehouse space to
more “useful” products. Also, “it has reduced the amount of interest we pay
on the inventory collateral loans,” he reports.
• Outsource the parts warehouse. A purchasing redesign director at a large
producer of chemicals has entered into an outsourcing arrangement with a
third party for its parts inventory warehouse. “By using the new supplier’s
purchasing leverage we are able to enjoy better pricing on the parts. The
other major beneﬁt is that we don’t have to worry about carrying all of that
inventory on our books and risk an obsolescence, out-of-stock, or over-
stock position,” he states.

As inventory managers continue to ﬁne-tune practices to reduce inventory
levels dramatically, one practice remains a consistent winner for many.

About half the respondents to an Inventory Reduction Report reader survey
continue to “more tightly manage usage rates, lead times, and safety stocks.”
Their experiences serve as a primer for those who as yet are not tightly man-
aging their usage rates, lead times, and safety stock—but might want to re-
consider.
It begins with supply quality.
A senior materials manager at a leading enter-
tainment company states, “The single most successful inventory control/
reduction concept used in the past year was to tightly manage usage rates
and safety stock levels based on life cycle of the product.” 
In conjunction with managing usage rates and safety stock levels, the
manager is also working with the company’s supplier base to reduce lead
times of all outsourced components and ﬁnished goods. “This was done by
creating a formal supplier quality program and categorizing the supplier base
into primary and secondary suppliers,” the manager explains.
He goes on to say that the initial strategy that spearheaded this success
was the creation of a production planning department three years ago. “This
enabled us to bring in the resources who had experience and were dedicated
full-time to implement and review materials management best practices and
performance measures,” he describes. “Before this, no time or thought was
given to materials/inventory management.”
An extra boost from new MRP II system.
“Since we instituted tighter man-
agement practices, we have been able to reduce both our safety stock level
and other inventory in general,” notes an inventory control manager at a
small facility that makes transportation equipment. “We’ve also experienced
increased inventory accuracy, reduced stock outages, and boosted our in-
ventory turnover performance from 18 to 24.”
The company currently is in the process of implementing an MRP II
system to enhance its forward planning capability. “Coupled with the better
management techniques we’ve installed, we now believe that our target of
52 inventory turns per year is reachable,” he says.
Forget the consultant’s advice.
“Tighter management of usage rates, lead
times, and safety stocks is the way to go. This approach was necessary,” ar-
gues the supply manager at a midsize specialty chemicals production facility.
“Allowing inventory to be a ‘result,’ as the consultants’ advise, was not a
good move. By managing directly, inventory was reduced by $10 million, or
more than 10%,” the manager reported.

Slashing millions in raw material inventories.
“By working with manufactur-
ing locations, our division signiﬁcantly reduced its raw material inventories,”
maintains a vice president at a large packaging manufacturer. To emphasize
the achievement, he explained, “At 12% cost of capital, this generated a $480
million savings.”
He then explained how it was accomplished. “Plants during the annual
budget process lowered safety stock expectations, creating stringently lower
budgeted inventory targets,” he detailed. “Improved communications be-
tween manufacturing plants and suppliers allowed for a better understand-
ing of lead-time requirements.” One solution he cited consisted of having
mixed full-truck shipments bringing in the goods to fulﬁll only immediate
raw material needs.
Start by reviewing ways to reduce operating costs.
A vice president at a small
plant that makes electrical equipment credits tighter management for gut-
ting its stores of obsolete, surplus, and damaged materials. “This alone rep-
resented about 7% of our total inventory,” he said.
Combining tighter management with more thorough analysis of A, B, C inventory
classiﬁcations.
A materials manager at a small producer of hoses and ﬁttings
not only initiated tighter management procedures but also went to work to
improve forecasts and classiﬁcations of A, B, and C inventory items. “This
led to a more balanced inventory to meet customers’ demands. In addition,
days per week have been saved as the review process became more efﬁcient.”
Inventory savings total $38,000 a month—and keep growing.
“Management of
usage rates, lead times, and safety stocks has had a most profound inﬂuence,”
shares a material planning specialist at a midsize manufacturer of electronics
equipment. “The implementation was accomplished by a thorough study of
usage, followed by establishing a closer relationship with suppliers to cut
down on the lead times to our plant.” 
This activity combined to reduce the safety stock requirements. “We
have had a 12% reduction in inventory, and we’re still not through making
improvements,” he notes.
Tracking performance by individual buyer.
The CFO at a small maker of pro-
motion merchandise has improved the usage rates and “keeps no more than
three to four weeks supply on hand.” Inventory is now one-third of the pre-
vious year’s amount, and inventory turns have doubled to eight over the past
462
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

two years. An additional incentive, he mentions, is that they “also track and
report inventory by individual buyer.”
Similarly, a materials manager at a midsize manufacturer of electrical dis-
tribution equipment went about increasing the awareness of inventory and
instituted periodic reviews among his material planners on ways to reduce
inventory. “We implemented a variety of projects, one of which focused on
tightening the management of usage rates and lead times,” he explained.
This activity alone was responsible for reducing inventory by $150,000, he
acknowledged.
Keeping top management informed.
“To enable us to tighten our management
of usage rates and lead times, we formed focus groups and speciﬁc inventory
project teams,” offers the director of strategic planning and inventory at a
large publishing organization. “We also provide our upper management
with quarterly reviews, analysis, and outlooks that these activities develop.”
This step keeps management informed, while also maintaining their interest
in keeping inventories limited, the manager responds.

Is shifting inventory ownership/responsibility to the supplier a legitimate in-
ventory reduction practice? Surveyed readers say that this approach is among
the most effective cost control practice they have instituted within the past
year.
A “smart” move for many practitioners, but one with ulterior motives.
According
to practitioners, this is deﬁnitely a means to reduce inventory levels and in-
vestment and increase inventory velocity and turns. Even if the supplier or
distributor attaches a fee for this “service,” we are told that it is still less than
the 25% to 40% inventory carrying cost that inventory managers would as-
sume. However, we also believe that shifting inventory, in some cases, is a
reaction to the many suppliers who express reluctance to engage a VMI ini-
tiative. 
By shifting inventory ownership/responsibility back to the supplier, we
speculate that the inventory managers are signaling more forceful VMI and
supply chain initiatives for the future. Even though some have reverted to
IOMA Readers Report What Works
463

a “tried and true” inventory reduction strategy, it is being practiced with a
major difference: It is not only “move the inventory back to the supplier.” A
number of practitioners also are insisting on some “value-added” activities.
Among surveyed readers’ comments:
• Company leverages the volume of MRO buys. “We’ve shifted inventory
ownership and management responsibility to several of our key suppliers,”
describes a purchasing manager at a large packaging manufacturer. “We have
leveraged our volume of inventories of MRO items by utilizing fewer
sources and requiring them to provide higher levels of value-added services
for this increased volume.” Although time savings have not been calculated,
he notes that cost savings average 10% to 20%.
• Supply chain review initiates a change in policy. “We shifted inventory us-
age/ownership to subcontractors that previously were supplied inventory
consigned by us,” explains a manager of international subcontracts at a mid-
size maker of portable power devices. “A review of our supply chain revealed
a signiﬁcant amount of inventory was purchased and then consigned to sub-
contractors who didn’t have the partnerships and alliances with our suppliers.
The change in practice has lowered our inventory investment more than
25%.”
• Consignment inventory is a partial answer. “We have moved to a consign-
ment inventory arrangement in which the material is located in our facility,
but the ownership rests with our supplier,” explains a materials manager at a
small manufacturer of lighting systems. “The arrangement provides us with
beneﬁts such as increased inventory turns, and we don’t have to include it as
‘our’ inventory until we use it, and the supplier replaces only what we use,”
he describes. However, “it still consumes ﬂoor space in our facility.”
• Third-party provider comments on “shifting” trend. “For the organizations
we serve, most of them are shifting the inventory responsibility to us,” notes
a vice president of supply chain solutions. “The gain for us is the visibility of
the inventory and all its uses without suffering the waves of inventory based
on forecasts, orders that haven’t arrived, and so forth.”
• Reduced space availability forces move to supplier partnership. “We began to
shift more of our inventory to a third-party logistics/warehouse provider
while also insisting that the supplier maintain ownership of the inventory,”
describes a manager of material distribution at a utility company. “We en-
tered into a partnership arrangement with that supplier.”
464
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

• Company shifts ownership but shares schedules. “When we began to shift
inventory ownership to our suppliers, we also introduced them to our pro-
duction plans and schedules through EDI and autofaxing,” says a planning fa-
cilitator at a midsize producer of ﬂuid control devices. “This effort was the
beginning of a trading partner relationship. Part of the arrangement called for
a quarterly discussion of service, delivery, and other appropriate items.”

Inventory Reduction Report reader surveys indicate that inventory managers
are putting more emphasis on removing excess, obsolete, or slow-moving
inventory. As product life cycles continue to compress and new products ac-
celerate to market at an ever-quickening pace, inventory managers will ﬁnd
their responsibilities growing in the area of identifying and reducing inven-
tory that is no longer required. Here is a sample of survey responses indicat-
ing respondent experiences, actions taken, and the results achieved. 
Deﬁning, identifying, and removing excess inventory.
A global service inventory
manager at a large transportation equipment manufacturer explains, “We fo-
cused on reducing the excess on-hand as well as the excess on-order, at all
of our locations.”
Excess is, by her deﬁnition, “good material that has arrived before we
really need it.” They created weekly reports detailing which parts are held
in excess and when open POs are scheduled to bring in the excess parts. “By
putting these tools in front of the planners and buyers, we were able to re-
duce the inﬂow of material and bleed-off the excess on-hand,” she describes. 
Focusing on large WIP inventories.
“We implemented two processes to re-
duce our WIP inventories,” reports the materials manager at a midsize pro-
ducer of brass valves and ﬁttings. The process involves better synchroniza-
tion of component parts and the introduction of machining centers that not
only machine parts but also test and pack. “We also implemented a parts al-
location software module,” he explains. It has eliminated an unattached parts
allocation program and provided a real-time inquiry into the status of open
production orders.

Selling obsolete and excess inventory.
After publishing an internal “distressed
inventory price book,” the logistics director at a small manufacturer of med-
ical devices was able to remove 50% of his excess and obsolete inventory.
This accounted for $3.5 million. “The book contained signiﬁcant discounts;
and by partnering with third-party medical device resellers, we managed to
move that inventory overseas.” 
Instituting new review procedures slices obsolete inventories.
“We routinely re-
view material usage,” reports an inventory manager at a small producer of
telecommunications equipment. “Now we’re beginning to look at all ma-
terial over $200 that remains unused for the past year.” For parts valued at
less than $100, they are routinely scrapped. For the higher-valued parts, buy-
ers now have the responsibility to review and dispose of the excess material.
To date, excess inventory levels have dropped from $200,000 to $60,000. 
Ridding aged inventory when the market sours.
The director of supply chain
management at a large producer of dehydrated vegetables had a problem
when sales declined in a fringe market. “We had a large supply of aged in-
ventory, which we clearly identiﬁed and then went about disposing,” he ex-
plains. The options included holding a ﬁre sale, reworking the stock, or dis-
posing outright. “Our solutions have greatly reduced our excess inventory
and the wasted time that would have been required to reconcile problem
inventories,” he states.
Educating the maintenance managers.
“Our maintenance managers want to
keep parts ‘just-in-case,’” says an executive vice president at a small injec-
tion molder. “We spoke with them and explained the basics of inventory, its
cost, and the impact it has on the company.” They then had the maintenance
force rationalize parts and materials that are “absolutely necessary” from
those that are “nice but not really critical.” Additionally, they have installed
a software module that has also helped to “shave inventory across multiple
storerooms,” he notes. Additionally, they are presently installing a Web-
based version of the software.
Removing stock after a project is canceled.
A warehouse supervisor at a midsize
builder of specialized maintenance equipment for the rail transportation in-
dustry cites a canceled project with more than $2 million of parts already
bought and placed into inventory. “Since most of the parts are exclusive to
our company, we began an item-by-item analysis to determine whether they

could be used in some other application,” he explains. “We’re doing this by
descending extended cost, and we are still in the analysis phase.”
Removing the “emotion” from discarding obsolete inventory.
“My biggest chal-
lenge is in convincing our branch managers to return stock to vendors at
20% to 30% restocking charge on slow movers,” explains a materials man-
ager at a wholesale distributor of pipes and valves. “They seemed to have an
emotional attachment and resisted discarding obsolete items.” Eventually,
through training and education, the managers became aware of the negative
effects of dead inventory and beneﬁts of returns and write-offs.
Enhancing in-store processor eliminates manual inputs and wrong inventory informa-
tion.
“We do not have perpetual inventory,” explains the planning and in-
ventory control vice president at a large chain of arts and crafts stores. “Our
stores easily become overstocked as we push inventory without having an
accurate on-hand inventory position for them.” Since they need accurate
counts on strategic items, they enhanced the in-store processors to print
count requests, allow input, and transmit to the home ofﬁce. “We removed
a manual process and no longer have the overstock situation we previously
had,” he relates.
Phasing in the write-offs.
“We had a problem with reducing dead stock that
is still on the books but is no longer in the plant,” mentions a purchasing
manager at a beef processor. “We’ve decided to reduce a given amount, such
as $20,000 per week, instead of writing off the inventory all at once,” he of-
fers. “In this way, there won’t be a ﬁnancial shock all at one time, which our
management doesn’t want to take, anyway.”
Removing ﬁeld stock requires a critical review.
A production control manager at
a midsize producer of ﬁre prevention equipment and supplies zeroed in on
reducing the inventory of items kept for ﬁeld service repairs. “We developed
a new service policy and revised our surplus inventory criteria as a result of
this effort,” he explains. Inventory was slashed by 35%.
Organizing a salvation effort for off-spec materials.
“In our business we have our
share of aged and off-spec materials,” reports the logistics and materials man-
ager at a midsize chemical plant. “To drive down the level of these materi-
als we’ve organized a rework plan, became more conscious of FIFO [ﬁrst
in, ﬁrst out], and aggressively sought a buyer for some of the off-spec
IOMA Readers Report What Works
467

materials.” To date, they have reduced the level of these materials by more
than 50%.
Reducing inventory in a short time frame.
An inventory control manager at a
small facility that makes air ﬁlters was given the task of reducing excess in-
ventory in a short time period. By using Pareto’s law (80/20 rule) and work-
ing on the largest items ﬁrst, he was able to achieve a 25% reduction in just
four months.
Bartering excess inventory for advertising space.
A retailer of home furnishings
ﬁnds bartering an effective tool for eliminating “obsolete and nonproduc-
tive inventories,” according to the general manager of physical distribution. 
Deﬁning and communicating criteria for excess and obsolete inventory.
Several re-
spondents explain that they are creating a set of standard procedures relat-
ing to excess and obsolete inventory. The inventory manager at a large
sporting goods manufacturer says it best: “We are currently working to es-
tablish criteria for the identiﬁcation of obsolete inventory and determin-
ing ways to best remove it from our facilities while still getting some value
for it.”

Managers of inventory often feel that their problems are unique. However,
a recent Inventory Reduction Report reader survey ﬁnds more resemblance
than difference. Forecast accuracy, excess inventories, ramp ups, and seasonal
adjustments are among the most frequently mentioned. Culled from hun-
dreds of responses, here are some common denominator problems and their
solutions.
Buffer forecast error with material.
“For a long time, we’ve been stocking ex-
tra material to make up for forecast inaccuracies,” acknowledges the senior
director of production planning and distribution at a large producer of diag-
nostic medical ultrasound devices.
“We ﬁnally got to a point where the excess and obsolete material was
unbearable, so we formed a team of middle managers to resolve the situa-
tion,” he explains. They made sure that the ﬁnancial, sales, and material plans
468
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

all were in sync while ensuring that ﬂexibility was maintained to achieve
revenue and income from operations (IFO) targets.
Excessive raw materials inventory.
“We were carrying an average of almost
$300,000 per day of activated carbon in raw materials,” explains a materials
manager at a midsize organization. They initially proposed instituting a JIT
delivery program of daily shipment. However, by so doing, freight costs
moved from $5,200 per month to more than $20,000 per month.
Instead, she formulated an agreement with the supplier to deliver the
charcoal once per week, on Sunday, but to invoice on Friday. The savings in
inventory amounted to more than $200,000 per week, while freight costs
were almost $15,000 per month.
Sell the organization on an inventory reduction policy.
“Our management was
reluctant to reduce its inventory levels because they feared negative impact
on supply security,” reports a customer service supervisor at a midsize oil ad-
ditive producer. “The issue was resolved by using a supply chain evaluation
showing true cost/beneﬁt analysis.” Part of the solution is using an inventory
analysis tool that makes inventory targets quantitative rather than subjective.
Resolve the matter of “cheap” imported steel and high inventory.
“We used im-
ported steel to cost average inventory,” explains a material control manager
at a small pipe and tube manufacturer. However, when the company suffered
a sales downturn, its inventories escalated. As a solution, they stopped buy-
ing imported steel and, instead, used short domestic lead times to purchase
more closely what is needed.
Accelerated seasonal demand causes out-of-stock situation.
“Our sales volumes
jump notoriously in summer, sometimes by as much as 30% without any
warning,” explains a materials supervisor at a midsize manufacturer of elec-
trical equipment. “This causes parts shortages which in turn drive our on-
time shipment performance.” In answer, she received approval to put addi-
tional kanban inventory in place on critical parts to cover the unplanned
increase. “We added almost $1 million,” she reports. “However, this added
inventory was well worth the investment, as we were able to keep our on-
time customer shipment performance at 95%.”
Minimize forecast demand errors.
“There are no bullet-proof methods,”
concedes the senior manager of global logistics at a major producer of
IOMA Readers Report What Works
469

semiconductors. “Therefore, we have minimized the problem by closely
monitoring outside of a two-week window. The next window of 30 days is
practically ﬂexible (±25%), while the remainder of the forecast is 100% ﬂex-
ible,” he details.
Managing products in a ramp-up/ramp-down situation.
“Both are equally chal-
lenging during a product’s life cycle,” maintains the director of materials at
a small developer of broadcast equipment. “During these periods we’re only
about 40% accurate to forecast. To alleviate these situations, we use build-
to-order when possible, and insist on shorter planning horizons.”
Reevaluate lead times on subassemblies.
A supervisor of planning and logistics
at a small maker of electronic equipment ﬁnds that “vendor adherence to
lead times” is his “biggest headache.” They’ve reviewed the established lead
times and discussed them with the supplier community. “We’ve made
changes where necessary, and emphasized the need for adherence to lead
times in every other situation,” he explains. “This has greatly reduced expe-
diting and late customer shipments while not impacting our inventory lev-
els in a negative sense.”
Obtain funding for supply chain management system.
“We ﬁnally received ap-
proval after using case studies to determine potential ROIs [returns on in-
vestment],” maintains the supply chain management director at a large pro-
ducer of packaged foods. “We also developed a core team to lead the
reengineering effort and to select the appropriate software solution.”
Protect inventory from theft.
The purchasing and stores manager at a small
maker of cement found that he was being victimized by “lost” cylinders of
oxygen and acetylene. He solved that problem by entering into a VMI pro-
cess and instituting a give one/get one policy for employees. 
Educate sales on inventory reduction.
“Our sales department vigorously op-
posed every effort to reduce inventory because they believed it would neg-
atively impact sales,” reports the inventory control manager at a small whole-
sale jeweler. “We began an education program to inform them that reduced
inventory does not reduce sales. Further, we invited the sales managers to at-
tend and participate in our product review sessions,” he explains. “Once we
gave them a voice in the matter, they no longer objected to our inventory
reduction decisions.”

Minimize impact of international forecast inaccuracies.
“The volatility in South
American and Asian forecasts has offset the gains we’ve been able to achieve in
our other inventory reduction efforts,” declares the logistics vice president of a
large manufacturer of construction equipment. “More frequent communica-
tion and forecast changes have minimized the inventory impact,” he reports.

As more inventory managers embrace the JIT philosophy, kanban becomes
the preferred process of materials replenishment. In addition, its practition-
ers have discovered that it is also a driver of continuous improvement activ-
ities. Here are just a few of the comments from readers of a recent Inventory
Reduction Report survey and from participants at a recent Annual Interna-
tional Conference of APICS.
• “We implemented visual replenishment and kanban programs man-
aged by the supplier,” explains the acquisition management manager at a
large manufacturer of industrial controls. “Suppliers come into our building
and download the forecast to their MRP. The supplier also delivers the parts
to the point of use.”
• “Our move to a demand ﬂow philosophy to address a highly conﬁg-
urable product uses kanban as triggers for resupply,” maintains a production
control manager at a midsize producer of medical equipment. “Order lead
times have gone from 15 days to three days for many custom products, and
our WIP inventory has since been cut by almost 80%.”
• “Since implementing an internal kanban pull system, we’ve reduced
ﬂoor stock, stockouts, lead times, and material handling,” explains a materi-
als manager at a small maker of automobile components. “Further, we in-
creased our inventory turns appreciably.”
• Hugh F. Campbell Jr., materials manager at OPW Fueling Compo-
nents (Cincinnati) cites some direct results for parts on kanban. “We have
seen a 10% inventory dollar reduction and a dramatic increase in turns.” He
explained that “some parts are now at 50-plus turns, while overall inventory
turns improved from six to eight. In addition, on-time delivery performance
improved to 95%.”

• At Macklanburg-Duncan (Oklahoma City), kanban systems have
been used to integrate MRP and JIT practices. “By utilizing these concepts,
one can minimize WIP inventories,” maintains Tom Kindinger, CPIM,
CIRM, production planner.
The Move to Electronic Kanbans
In a new development, Toyota Motor Corporation and its key suppliers in
Japan plan to computerize their system of kanban cards. The automaker is
currently introducing its online kanban system after encouraging tests of the
computerized system. 
Reportedly, the data-recording technology enables the system to incor-
porate about 100 times more data than can kanban cards. In addition to in-
creasing the amount of information available to suppliers, the new system
will slash lead times. With the kanban card process, it is reported that it takes
seven to eight hours for the card to reach the production point. 
Under the new system, according to Lean Production Report, parts sup-
pliers will receive ordering instructions online, print them out, and attach
them to the ordered parts, which are then delivered to Toyota. According
to one estimate, if Toyota sent all its transactions with a speciﬁc supplier elec-
tronically, that supplier would save 2,000 to 3,000 hours per month.
Clarifying Kanban Misconceptions
There’s no argument that kanbans work well in an environment where there
are high product volumes and low product variety. However, William M.
Boyst Jr., CFPIM, an Oliver Wight consultant focusing on continuous im-
provement programs, maintains that “kanbans do work equally well in both
low-mix/high-volume and in high-mix/low-volume environments.” 
However, he warns that it is critical to use the right kanban technique
in the right environment. He described the two methodologies at the
APICS meeting:
1. Product-dependent kanban. This is the choice for a high-volume/low-
mix environment. Product-dependent kanbans provide a visible signal of
what to do and when to do it. “When a kanban becomes empty, you simply
replace what was there with another just like it,” Boyst explains. The advan-
tage of this technique is that it is easy to explain and understand. However,
it also requires more inventory and more ﬂoor space.
472
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

2. Product-independent kanban. This is preferred for the low-volume/
high-mix environment. In this practice, kanbans provide a visible signal of
when it is time to do something but do not communicate what to do. The
“what to do” must be communicated independently of the kanban signal
by an external method. The external source can be an MRP II dispatch
list, a final assembly schedule, or a customer order. The advantage of this
technique is that it does not require some of each item at each worksta-
tion. The disadvantage, however, is the difficulty of explaining and un-
derstanding it.
“Most companies start off using product-dependent kanbans because
they are easy to explain and understand,” Boyst explains. “Then, as JIT ex-
pands to include more areas of the company, there is a shift into a hybrid
approach. Finally, as the company converts all its operations to JIT, the ap-
proach changes to all product-independent kanbans.”
Supplier Partnerships Improve Success of Kanban Process
“At SOR [Lexana, Kan.], an important element of the supplier agreement is
the inventory requirement,” explains Michael Weise, production manager.
Suppliers agree to keep on hand a quantity of base stock that approximates
four kanban releases. 
SOR’s releases and supplier shipments are closely controlled and are an
integral part of the program’s success. The release form for all needed kan-
bans is sent by fax to the supplier once each week. The supplier acknowl-
edges receipt of the release in 24 hours by returning the release form con-
ﬁrming that the shipment will be as requested. “SOR will not accept the
delivery of a partial supply kanban or a partial release,” Weise noted.
When the shipment arrives, the entire release is received with one trans-
action that transfers all kanbans into inventory. The supplier uses the release
form as a packing list, which also initiates payment to the supplier within 48
hours after receipt.
Continuous Improvement Process Reduces
Number of Kanbans in System
For each item on a supplier partnership agreement there were initially ﬁve
supply kanbans in the system. Each card represented a one-week usage. Two
supply kanbans covered internal safety stock during the installation phase.
IOMA Readers Report What Works
473

However, through the continuous improvement process, they now have
been eliminated. 
Two-Bucket Kanban System for High-Dollar Parts at OPW
For each kanban item selected, supplier representatives were brought in to
meet the OPW Fueling Components team and learn about the kanban pro-
cess. According to Campbell, goals and objectives were discussed and agreed
to, and fears and roadblocks were addressed. The procedures were then doc-
umented and sent to the suppliers for review along with the recommended
kanban quantities. 
“In several instances suppliers recommended a slightly different quan-
tity due to packaging considerations,” he explains. “We reviewed them and
reached an agreement with the supplier. We began the kanban start-up on
an item-by-item basis.”
Kanban locations, which are bar coded for future cycle count data col-
lection activities, are identiﬁed in the work cell. “As soon as a bucket is
empty, the cell coordinator has a second bucket moved to the location and
pulls a notiﬁcation to ship form,” he details. “This is faxed to the supplier
from manufacturing. Upon receipt of the fax, the supplier ships the next
bucket, and the cycle continues,” he describes.

As an inventory manager, you are feeling the pressure to drive your com-
pany’s inventory to even lower levels. The reason: the annual investment that
companies make in inventory represents between 20% and 40% of invested
capital. In addition, for every dollar by which the inventory is reduced, net
income increases by the same dollar. 
With good inventory management practices you can free up sizeable re-
sources and make a signiﬁcant contribution to your company’s bottom line,
increasingly an adjunct responsibility of inventory managers. The major
stumbling block is how to reduce inventory without degrading customer
service.
How Case Corporation reduces cost through better inventory management.
Mark S.
Miller, CPM, CIRM, purchasing manager (mmiller@casecorp.com), and
Thomas M. Graddy, CPM, CIRM, manager of supply chain management
(Tgraddy@casecorp.com), both of Case Corporation (Racine, Wisc.) have
found the key to this dilemma. At a recent Annual International Purchasing
Conference of the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM),
they described the techniques that they use to reduce inventory costs. 
1. Improve communications in the supply chain. “There is duplicate safety
stock carried at each level of the supply chain,” they explain. “By improving
4 7 5
TEAMFLY
Team-Fly® 

communications, safety stock can be reduced without impacting customer
service.” Two of the tools that help include electronic commerce and in-
house supplier personnel.
With e-commerce, pertinent information can be exchanged through-
out the supply chain electronically. Also, with in-house personnel, supplier
representatives can be located at different levels of the supply chain to expe-
dite orders and manage schedules, among other tasks.
2. Reduce supplier lead times. Lead times have a direct impact on inven-
tory levels, yet studies show that lead times consist of as much as 95% of idle
time. The challenge is to work with suppliers to reduce that lead time.
Miller and Graddy describe two steps that should be considered. First,
track and measure lead time. “Measure how long it takes for each step of the
supply chains,” they advise. Track supplier lead times, inbound transporta-
tion time, transport time to the customer, manufacturing lead times, and dis-
tribution cycle times. “Recognize which suppliers and which commodities
have the longest lead times and start with these.” 
Negotiating shorter lead times is another recommendation. “Challenge
lead times,” they declare. “Ask for a breakdown of the components of the
lead time.” Compare one supplier’s lead time to those of others. Challenge
the supplier to reduce its idle time. Using distributors is another method to
reduce lead times for some products, they offer.
3. Standardize. “Reduce the number of items carried,” advises Graddy.
“Fewer items with greater quantities make forecasting more accurate.”
Fewer items to buy means that lower safety stock is needed and therefore
that inventory is lowered. Among the ways to reduce the number of parts:
substitute for standard parts and consolidate common part numbers.
4. Reduce surplus/obsolete inventory. “Surplus or obsolete inventory can
be reduced without risk to customer service,” they observe. Methods that
they use to dispose of this inventory include using it elsewhere in the com-
pany, negotiating its return to the supplier, selling it to other company, and
donating the inventory to a local charity. 
5. Improve supplier quality. Poor supplier quality will result in added costs
in many areas, including additional inventory. “Become involved in the sup-
plier quality audit process or push the supplier to become ISO [International
Standards Organization] certiﬁed,” they declare. “When suppliers have qual-
ity problems, initiate a corrective action plan and make sure it is followed.”
By improving the supplier quality, less stock will be required.
476
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

6. Challenge minimum order quantities (MOQs) and price quantity breaks.
Make sure that your purchasing department is aware that suppliers’ mini-
mum quantities and price quantity breaks can cause surplus inventory. How-
ever, realize that suppliers require MOQs or quantity price breaks to com-
pensate for their costs of setting up a job.
Therefore, enlist the aid of your engineering department to work with
suppliers to reduce set-ups or recommend an annual commitment agree-
ment with the supplier so that it can build the entire MOQ while agreeing
to hold the inventory and ship it in small quantities.
7. Have parts delivered more frequently. The more often a part is delivered,
the lower the investment in inventory. As an example, Miller and Graddy
cite a situation in which the order frequency of high-volume A and B items
was increased, and the average weeks supply of inventory tumbled from 3.7
weeks to just 1.9 weeks (see Table II-3.1). “However, the cost of ordering
and receiving parts must also be considered when reviewing the order fre-
quency,” they warn.
8. Improve on-time delivery. “One of the reasons that extra inventory is
carried is to compensate for suppliers who can’t be counted on to deliver on
time,” Graddy explains. He recommends applying the following to improve
supplier delivery:
• Measure on-time delivery. There are many methods to measure this pa-
rameter, but the method applied is not as important as long as supplier on-
time performance is tracked.
• Make sure the supplier understands. Talk to suppliers and make sure that
they are aware of how you measure their delivery performance and of how
you deﬁne on-time.
• Set supplier goals. Together with the supplier, set on-time delivery
goals. Make delivery one of the key measures in your supplier-rating pro-
gram.

• Reward supplier performance. Recognize suppliers who achieve their
on-time goals.
9. Set up a supplier-managed inventory program. “Work with key suppliers
to develop a program to manage and hold inventory for you,” Miller offers.
“The idea is to reduce the amount of total inventory and not just to transfer
inventory to the supplier.” Some of the more popular programs in use today
include
• Vendor managed inventory. Here, the supplier performs the inventory
function for the customer.
• Point of sale. The supplier reacts to customer demand and replenishes
the inventory level.
• Consignment stocking. The supplier owns the inventory when it is in
your facility. Payment is made when the inventory is used.
• Supplier stocking. The supplier carries safety stock and ships just in time
( JIT).
10. Give credit for inventory reduction. “Inventory reduction has a direct
impact on your company’s ﬁnancial success,” they remind. Therefore, they
advise recognizing the importance of inventory reduction by
•
Getting everyone involved. “Teach the impact inventory has on the
bottom line,” they recommend. Form a team to focus on inventory reduc-
tion projects. Get suppliers, engineering, manufacturing, ﬁnance, and mar-
keting involved in the team.
• Counting inventory reduction as a cost reduction. In many companies, in-
ventory reduction is not counted as a cost reduction. Miller and Graddy are
adamant: “Inventory reduction is important and should be recognized as a
cost reduction.”

By Kate Fickle (kﬁckle@prtm.com), director, and Manoj Kumar (mkumar@prtm.
com), manager, at Pittiglio Rabin Todd & McGrath. This article is excerpted from a
lengthy case study originally appearing in PRTM’s Insight (www.prtm.com).
A “true” supply chain at a computer peripherals company we recently exam-
ined extended from its suppliers to its customers. However, it was heavy with
478
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

inventory. Part of the problem was attributed to the “bullwhip” effect caused
by each party in the chain adding a hedge to the demand forecast. Another was
its complex push-based replenishment process. While each company recog-
nized the overall problem, none was motivated to tackle a solution on its own.
However, with the application of the supply-chain operations reference model
(www.supply-chain.org), the solution was put into place.
The elementary problem of high inventory.
We were initially engaged by the
sales company and its ﬁnished goods manufacturer to improve inventory
turnover and increase the supply chain’s ﬂexibility. Although both compa-
nies believed, or initially maintained, that their inventory levels were no
worse than average, they also realized that by working jointly they could fur-
ther reduce their inventory and improve their responsiveness to changes in
demand.
The relatively short product life cycle (less than a year) meant that excess
inventory resulted in write-offs, a very undesirable outcome in a very com-
petitive industry. Working with us, the customer and its manufacturer en-
listed the support of the major assembly suppliers to the ﬁnished goods man-
ufacturer, and selected suppliers of components to the assembly suppliers. In
total, we assessed companies representing four stages of the supply chain.
Applying the SCOR model to the supply chain.
In our initial discussions with
the participants in this supply chain, they ultimately conceded that their in-
ventory levels were a “bit high.” We began by evaluating the supply chain’s
overall performance, using the SCOR model and our Integrated Supply
Chain Benchmarking Study as analysis tools. Our analysis revealed that sales
were lost due to poor supply chain ﬂexibility and a worst-in-class overall
level of inventory to support sales.
The pointlessly high levels of inventory were driven not only by weak-
nesses in the planning process but also by deﬁciencies in the supply chain
conﬁguration and weaknesses in the product design from the standpoints of
both design for manufacturability and postponement of ﬁnal assembly. A
Level 2 SCOR model (see the section titled “Pharmaceutical Giant SCORs
with Winning Supply Chain Initiative” in Chapter III-3) of the “plan” pro-
cess, which breaks that process down into multiple categories, revealed the
complexity of the process:
• The plan process required a minimum of 51 discrete process steps be-
tween the sales company and the ﬁnished goods production company.
Case Studies of Success
479

• Each monthly planning cycle took over 45 days. Because of the
length and complexity of the planning cycle, each participant was acting on
demand data from different periods.
• Forecast variability was high. The operant tendency was to overfore-
cast demand in order to hedge against supply chain variability. This resulted
in the upstream suppliers getting routinely and roundly “bullwhipped.”
• The lead times within each company were tight, but the overall, or
“interconnective,” lead times were high. Although the average product life
cycle was a year, the material ﬂow started almost 165 days before the ﬁnished
product reached the distributor. The horizontal lines in Figure II-3.1 grow
longer as the products move closer to their completion dates and represent
no value being added to the product. The most surprising result for the com-
panies involved in this supply chain was that the theoretically best inventory
days of supply given current policies was 113 days.
• Each of the production centers in the supply chain focused on a spe-
ciﬁc manufacturing technology. Products, therefore, moved from one fac-
tory or distribution center to the next until its production was completed.
Some of the parts traveled through as many as six companies and countries
before being shipped to the customer. This inevitably resulted in additional
transportation and planning lead times.

Buildup of Inventory Value

The difﬁculty of solving the problem of supply chain conﬁguration.
This was
harder to solve than the planning process and lead times. Each company
acted independently, and any change in supply chain conﬁguration meant
that one company gained value-added activity while another lost it. Some
of the companies involved in the supply chain are related and have begun to
realign their activities so that more value-add occurs at each physical node
in the supply chain.
The solution to reducing lead times and simplifying the planning process.
After
sharing the results with all of the companies in the supply chain, the sales
company and ﬁnished goods company agreed to work jointly. They began
by implementing a joint service agreement (JSA) that outlined their mutual
roles in managing the supply chain and speciﬁed the performance standards
guiding each party.
To supplement the JSA, the two companies implemented a breadman-
type pull system between them. At the same time, they worked with each
other and their suppliers to reduce lead times. As a result of these initiatives,
the two companies cut their joint inventory from over 100 days of supply to
less than 30 days.
The companies are now extending the JSA implementation and pull
system to the other companies in the supply chain. They are also realigning
their value-added activities to consolidate activities within fewer locations.
The design activities themselves were the last elements to receive attention.
The analysis showed that the high value-add components were added early
in the supply chain, and all conﬁgurable functions built into the product at
early stages of production. This resulted in high levels of inventory dollars
in the supply chain and high obsolescence during product transitions. The
companies are just beginning to introduce postponement concepts into the
design phase.
The individual companies in the supply chain had good supply chain
management. They were average or above average on most supply chain
metrics, except inventory days of supply. By working together to analyze the
supply chain, the companies identiﬁed areas in which coordinated joint ac-
tivity could produce substantial results. The results included reducing plan-
ning and transportation lead times, shifting from push-based to pull-based
inventory planning, simplifying the production planning process, realigning
factories to integrate value-adding operations, and redesigning the product
from a design-for-logistics perspective to enhance postponement.

Hennessy Industries proves that you can actually reduce inventory and im-
prove customer service. A series of problems relating to their relocation from
Chicago to Nashville found them increasing production rates and overtime
work to improve their delivery performance. However, it was all done at the
expense of building huge inventories. “We had a problem with excess in-
ventory that was out of control,” acknowledges Michael C. Moody, CPIM,
CPM, purchasing and materials manager. Today, however, inventories are
down 44% and are moving toward the target objective of 50%.
Establish realistic goals for inventory reduction.
“We began by taking a hard
look at each category of inventory, and started brainstorming for areas of op-
portunity,” he explains. “Being a manufacturer of automotive wheel service
equipment, we had to address raw materials, in-process inventory, and ﬁn-
ished equipment, which included a signiﬁcant inventory of service parts.” 
Hennessy had to maintain adequate service part inventories for all cur-
rent products. In addition, they also had to keep a supply for all products
produced and sold over the previous seven years.
Once they had the essential tools in place for the planners and customer
service to improve customer satisfaction (see sidebar), they turned their fo-
cus to removing the excess inventories. “We established a work plan for re-
ductions, along with realistic targets,” Moody offers.
Company’s continuous improvement philosophy prevails.
“We established a
single-year target for each category of inventory, knowing each subsequent
year would bring new, lower targets for reductions,” he describes. They
benchmarked several General Electric practices, including safety stock lev-
els for ﬁnished goods and raw materials.
“We were cautious on our reduction targets, as our order ﬁll rates were
just beginning to show improvement from the past year,” Moody explained
at an Annual American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS)
International Conference. “We also focused on our excess and obsolete in-
ventories, since we had over $1.5 million in these categories.”
If the product change notice system is not working, get engineers involved.
One of
the ﬁrst realizations was that Hennessy’s change management process was
not functioning effectively.

“We addressed this with an ongoing education process for our engi-
neers, planners, and buyers so they could understand their roles and respon-
sibilities in the change process,” Moody details. Many of them were unaware
of the implications of how a change to one part can create excesses of an-
other part, or even render it obsolete.
Hennessy had hired several new planners and buyers during the plant
consolidation and had not provided them with sufﬁcient training on how
to manage parts changes. A “prime team” was established to analyze the
company’s business processes and to deﬁne which required improvement.
Techniques such as process mapping and cause-and-effect diagrams were
applied.
They also used a professional facilitator to guide the team through a pro-
cess-mapping kaizen of all company processes that led to the creation of ex-
cess and obsolete inventories. “The information gained during the kaizen
provided a basis for several changes to our business practices,” he notes.

Provide New Tools to Achieve Customer Service Objectives
and Spare Parts Management
Hennessy designed a process to manage and track all shipments of parts and
equipment from the plant to a third-party distribution center (DC). “A pro-
gram was written that allows our employees to bar code scan all materials
loaded on a trailer for shipment to the DC,” Moody explains. A tracking
number is created for every part and for the entire truck.
Once the truck is unloaded at the DC and every part received is given a
storage location, the transaction is complete. “An ‘in-transit’ inventory loca-
tion in our computer allows our planners and customer service personnel full
visibility of the materials produced and on their way to the DC,” he details.
To manage the inventories of service parts, accessories, and equipment at
the DC, a “pick list” system has been designed to give material planners a daily
exception report on what materials require replenishment at the DC, using
redeﬁned safety stock levels.
Additionally, an allocation system was designed and implemented. Cus-
tomer orders are prioritized using classiﬁcations, such as emergency, export,
regular, back orders, and new store opening. This provides customer service
personnel with a tool not only for managing key orders but also for manag-
ing service parts or equipment that may be in short supply.
“This program has signiﬁcantly improved our order ﬁll rate, and it en-
sures that our oldest orders are ﬁlled ahead of new orders,” maintains Moody.

Service parts management: the most difﬁcult task.
“We discovered that due to
our lack of an effective change process, we had hundreds of part numbers
that were obsolete but had never been coded as such,” Moody explains. “Af-
ter our engineers and manufacturing personnel had sifted through our parts
records, we saw obsolete inventories grow again.”
Moody and the team then assigned obsolete dates to previously manu-
factured parts so that future obsolescence could be identiﬁed and acted
upon. They also revisited the stocking levels to ensure that the reorder points
were consistent with existing sales levels.
“To provide a basis for ongoing reductions, considering our obligation
to provide service parts for up to seven years after a sale, we developed a re-
port of all service parts for each planner,” he explains. It lists all service parts
in descending dollar value of excess inventory.
This information is used to track excess inventories by planner and in to-
tal so that everyone can focus their efforts on reducing the excesses. Addi-
tionally, each planner now identiﬁes and tracks the top ﬁve excess parts in-
dividually and reports them weekly.
“Once the planners could identify speciﬁc parts for improvement, the
reductions came,” he relates. “We now hold weekly engineering change
meetings by product type, and every planner, buyer, and engineer must at-
tend to represent their areas.”
Kanbans and point-of-use storage take down raw materials inventories.
“If you re-
ally want to reduce raw material inventories, try learning to live without
MRP [manufacturing resource planning], or at least become less dependent
on it,” Moody challenges. “We still use MRP to provide a ‘vision’ of needs
to our suppliers, but we are currently implementing kanban across all pro-
duction lines.”
Supplier relationships are also important. “Shorten your suppliers’ lead
time, and you will reduce the amount of material you need to stock at your
plant,” he advises. “Consider a supplier kaizen to drive this process.”
Use personnel from within your organization who are knowledgeable
in cycle time reduction. Concurrently, establish kanban to release materials
to the factory, as Hennessy does. “Kanban and point-of-use storage help
eliminate wasteful, unneeded inventory,” he notes.
According to Moody, “To achieve signiﬁcant inventory reductions, fo-
cus on the root causes and develop countermeasures and a work plan to ex-
ecute these countermeasures.”

Changing from traditional work-order-based planning and control methods
to true repetitive can help you achieve considerable inventory reduction.
Repetitive assumes that jobs will be intentionally grouped by processing
characteristics to create logical, if not physical, production lines. According
to leading authority Gary Langenwalter, CFPIM, CIRM, president of Man-
ufacturing Consulting Partners International (Bolton, Mass.), “The repeti-
tive approach dramatically reduces setup times, which in turn signiﬁcantly
reduces lot sizes.” These actions translate into massive reductions in inven-
tory, lead times, and cycle times.
Switch to repetitive process slashes work in progress (WIP) 80%.
As an example
of what can be achieved by moving to repetitive manufacturing, Langen-
walter cites the experience of Tier 1 automotive supplier ITT Automotive
(Glencoe, Ontario). Since implementing repetitive practices, the company
has achieved the following:
• Backﬂushing has improved WIP inventory accuracy to 97+%.
• Point-of-use storage is working well as each production cell now
supplies itself.
• With work cells they reduced the number of pay points to one and
directly supported the radical inventory reduction (see Table II-3.2).

• Bills of material (BOMs) were ﬂattened to a single level, reducing the
number of pay points to one, reducing data entry transactions by 75%, and
increasing inventory accuracy.
The end of safety stock?
Additionally, the company installed an automotive
supply-oriented enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that uses elec-
tronic data interchange (EDI) to link them tightly to customers and suppli-
ers. Langenwalter told a recent APICS Annual International Conference
that “the system calculates suppliers’ schedules so accurately that the mate-
rials manager no longer adds safety stock when ordering from suppliers.”
Each shift enters its actual production so that incoming supervisors can eas-
ily determine the production remaining for each part’s run. They run MRP
daily and rerun it during the day if there are major changes. “They have re-
cently implemented electronic advance shipping notiﬁcations.”
Inventory turns triple.
This happened when the inventory was reduced from
three weeks on-hand to one week on-hand. “Management deliberately re-
duced inventory buffers to increase ﬂexibility, reduce total cycle times, and
improve throughput,” Langenwalter reported. Most of the reduction came
from ﬁnished goods and WIP, which moved from one week each to just one
day each. Also, raw materials shrank to just three days from the traditional
one week.
As an encouraging aside, Langenwalter said, “The materials manage-
ment professionals also have cut their work week from 60+ to just over 40
hours per week.”

Inventory management for Solar-Mates, a small manufacturer of non-
premium sunglasses, was a simple, uncomplicated process, but one that
worked well for the organization-that is, until the company acquired Seren-
geti Eyewear Division of Corning Inc., a much larger company (by a factor
of 5), and maker of high quality, premium sunglasses.
Phone call inventory replenishment.
“At Solar-Mates, we literally could see
that we’re going to run out of product this month,” explains Craig Davison,
director of information systems of the renamed Serengeti Eyewear Inc.
486
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

(Sarasota, Fla.; craigd@serengeti-eyewear.com). “All we’d have to do is
make a phone call to the Far East, and we’d have the product we needed to
fulﬁll our customer orders within the next thirty days,” he says.
However, after the acquisition of Serengeti he realized that the new or-
ganization would require a more sophisticated information system. “The old
system was purely accounting based and was very weak in inventory control,
inventory management, and inventory reporting,” explains Davison. Fur-
ther, because the linked databases were proprietary, managers could not get
to the data within the system. “And since we could not access the data, we
couldn’t customize it,” he adds.
Transition into a new business reality and impact on inventory.
Davison cites sev-
eral examples that had a critical impact on the organization’s inventory phi-
losophy:
• From a lead time of 30 days to 120 days. “We had a pretty simple setup,”
he notes. “We used three vendors, all located in the same country in the Far
East, and they handled all the supply, raw materials, and manufacturing. We
[Solar-Mates] acted more as a broker than a manufacturer.”
Premium eyewear is a very different product. The frames are of higher
quality, and the lens technology is totally different from the polarized poly-
carbonate plastic lens found in nonpremium sunglasses. 
Optical-quality lens technology requires many different manufacturing
processes. In fact, the Serengeti premium sunglasses require a lead time of
120 days. “It’s a little harder to manage your inventory when you have to
wait four months after you place an order,” Davison mentions.
• From 12 SKUs to over 2,000 SKUs. “We went from 10 employees to
60 employees in two months,” he describes. “And we went from 12 SKUs
in our system to more than 2,000 in a month.”
Needless to say, they had an initial problem with excess inventory. “We
didn’t have any sales history, but we knew we had four months to build the
next product line,” Davison explains. “We bought what we thought was
right—10,000 units of everything. It always doesn’t sell that way,” he con-
cedes. “So, we had a lot of the wrong inventory, a lot of excess inventory,
and zero technology.”
• From “broker” to manufacturer. The decision was made to manage the
actual manufacturing process of the premium label. “Now, instead of just
calling three vendors and ordering a pair of sunglasses, we have to deal with
Case Studies of Success
487

20 suppliers in six countries, all of whom are doing something different,”
Davison says. 
“We’re now responsible for getting the raw materials for the glass lens;
we have to secure the temple tips; and we have to arrange for the manufac-
ture of the nose pads and get the frames assembled,” he details. “Then we
have to match it all up with the frame for ﬁnal assembly, and move it to Sara-
sota.”
• From a small customer base to a more diversiﬁed base. For the nonpremium
sunglasses, Serengeti has 12 to 15 large discount national chains in the
United States that require large, structured, very periodic deliveries.
The customer base for the Serengeti premium sunglasses is “extremely
diverse.” It includes over 100 large national retail chains in the United States,
Canada, Europe, and Australia, plus 1,200 smaller mom-and-pop type re-
tailers.
Getting the inventory situation under control.
Serengeti initiated a systems se-
lection process that involved reviewing several ERP packages designed for
small and midsize manufacturers. Davison quickly points out a key selection
requirement that is common to many small and midsize organizations: “We
don’t consider ourselves to be a technology-oriented company, so we have
no desire to spend a lot of money on a computer system.” However, they
still had a series of requirements that had to be met.
“Having to manage inventory and allocate scarce production resources
was new to us,” he explains. “We also faced the challenge of developing pro-
cesses to track material around the globe.” Additionally, because they now
make premium products, Davison adds, “We don’t want to make more than
we need, but we want to be able to tell our customers when they can expect
delivery of the product.” 
Serengeti is also an aggressive company, introducing new products every
eight to 12 weeks. “We begin with small production runs, so we have to have
a mechanism to let them know when to expect delivery of the new prod-
uct.”
Narrowing the search to one software vendor.
An additional aspect of his search
was the fact that Corning used the DOS-based version of Macola (Macola
Software, Marion, Ohio; www.macola.com). “With all of the other things
going on, coming up with a brand new system from scratch really wasn’t too
appealing,” he admits.
488
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

“We looked at all the different pieces of the Macola Progression Series
7.5-the ﬁnancial, accounting, MRP, master scheduling, inventory, and or-
der entry modules-and found what we needed to get our business running,”
he shares.
Gaining visibility in the international inventory picture.
Four months after the
acquisition, the new Serengeti Eyewear had $10 million of inventory sitting
in the warehouse that they couldn’t sell. In addition, they had another $10
million in backorders.
“Today we have a better handle on our inventory, and our backorders
have been reduced by 90%,” says Davison. “We’re not carrying too much in-
ventory, and the $1 million on backorders is good for us and for our indus-
try,” he notes. “With a four-month lead time, to have this low level of back-
orders, with an average selling price of $60 to $70 to the distributor, is a
pretty good ratio,” he claims-this while the business has grown by an addi-
tional 10%.
“Less inventory frees up cash to do other things, like improve our infra-
structure-training of people and improving processes,” Davison declares.
“Now that we’ve learned more about the Macola system, we’ve found there
are even more variables, more ﬂexibility still in the system that we didn’t
have any knowledge of in the beginning,” he notes. “It’s improved our cost
management.”
For example, he explains, “It’s given us visibility for the ﬁrst time, so we
could see where our inventory is located. With four months of inventory, six
different countries, and 20 different factories, it could sometimes lead to
double purchasing. Today, we don’t necessarily have that risk as we can see
where everything is, what it costs, and can ﬁnd everything at any point in
time.”
Additionally, and for the ﬁrst time, Serengeti is able to use available-to-promise with
its customers.
The customer service reps are all trained and have access to the
stock status or shipping status on their screens, so they can give accurate dates
to the customer. Further, “all data we can now access is making our buyers
and planners plan more accurately. We don’t have products way out of sync,
and we’re no longer buying 10,000 units of everything.”
The real test for the system and organization occurred several months
ago, when Serengeti’s top customer increased its demand 55% over forecast.
“We were able to look at the schedule and see where all our capacity was in
all of our facilities internationally,” he describes. “We have been able to adjust
Case Studies of Success
489

our capacity, and even with a four-month lead time, have been able to meet
the change in demand.”
As Davison concludes, “With the Macola system, we have been able to
establish efﬁcient new procedures for inventory management, production
planning, and production scheduling-activities we didn’t have previous to
the acquisition.”

By Grace Lin (gracelin@us.ibm.com), manager of extended enterprises systems re-
search, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
The International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, N.Y.) has em-
barked on a global supply chain reengineering initiative to speed up respon-
siveness to customers while minimizing inventory. Key to this successful ef-
fort is a decision support tool, Asset Management Tool (AMT), developed
by IBM Research and IBM’s Integrated Supply Chain team.
To date, AMT has been deployed in approximately half of IBM’s oper-
ations worldwide, with much success. For instance, AMT was used to ana-
lyze the supply chain for a printer product family by the IBM Printing Sys-
tems Company. It studied the effects of forecast accuracy, product structure,
and the introduction of a new DC. In one case, the recommendations led to
a new supply chain process involving direct shipments. The result was the
elimination of 99% inventory at a site, inventory savings that approached $4
million annually, and a 40% reduction in cash-to-cash cycle time.
Personal Systems Group, with AMT, reduces channel inventory by more than half.
Large volumes but slim proﬁt margins and falling prices in the personal com-
puter market made IBM’s Personal Systems Group (PSG) an ideal candidate
for supply chain reengineering. Using AMT, the business unit was able to re-
duce expenses by over $750 million in one year alone. This was achieved in
a number of ways. Inventory was reduced dramatically. Channel inventory
was reduced from over three months to approximately one month. Conse-
quently, the division reduced price protection expenses (what PSG reim-
burses business partners whenever it takes a price action on products that
business partners are holding) by over $100 million from the previous year.
490
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

In addition, the end-to-end inventory had been reduced from four-and-
a-half months to less than two by the end of the year. By closing the gap be-
tween component procurement and product sale by four to six weeks, an
additional savings on product cost of at least 5% was realized. This equates
to more than $650 million in savings.
Applying AMT at PSG.
A cross-functional team was assembled to use
AMT (see sidebar) to design and analyze the supply chain policies and strate-
gies to create an integrated value chain. The team consisted of participants
from PSG’s manufacturing, procurement, distribution, ﬁnance, and reengi-
neering operations divisions and from the IBM Research Division. The
goals were to assess the impacts of the proposed policies and to agree on the
optimal conﬁguration of the supply chain.
The PSG extended supply chain was a hybrid push-pull system in which
products were built (or pushed) to a certain level based on our current fore-
cast and serviceability targets until they were “pulled” by the business part-
ners. To model this type of environment, AMT inventory optimization was
used to periodically set up the build plan, taking into consideration the fore-
cast accuracy and customer serviceability factors. At the same time, the sim-
ulation module was used to generate customer orders, the assembly process,
and the inventory policy used at the business partners, which is based on days
of inventory.
After this study, a worldwide strategic supply chain initiative, the Ad-
vanced Fulﬁllment Initiative (AFI), was formed. The AMT is at the heart of
this initiative, which was deployed to reengineer and restructure the total
supply chain to form a virtual enterprise. The output from the tool provided
the actual basis for the terms and conditions that PSG applied through AFI.
AMT also improves business-partner relationships.
“The Advanced Fulﬁllment
Initiative is viewed as the personal computer industry’s leading initiative to
redesign the supply chain to deliver optimal serviceability to the customer at
minimum cost,” says Bob Moffat, general manager for manufacturing, pro-
curement, and fulﬁllment at IBM Personal Systems Group (Raleigh, N.C.)
“In addition to the improved ﬁnancial returns, we have also seen deﬁnitive
qualitative beneﬁts.”
For example, he cites improved relationships with business partners,
“making them more efﬁcient, productive, and powerful in the marketplace.”

Deﬁning the Asset Management Tool
AMT is a cornerstone of IBM’s extended enterprise supply chain management.
Reaching from the suppliers’ suppliers to the customers’ customers, it is a mod-
eling and analysis system for strategic and tactical supply chain planning.
AMT quantiﬁes the impact of the uncertainty in demand, lead time, and
the supplier’s reliability to support decision making. AMT has been success-
fully applied to solve many reengineering problems. These include channel
assembly, inventory/serviceability tradeoffs, direct/indirect business model
analysis, and collaboration and value chain integration.
With AMT’s built-in optimization engine, the user can perform fast but
very deep “what if” analyses that are beyond the capabilities of standard de-
cision support tools. With a simulation engine, the user can perform periodic
recalculations of the optimal inventory levels while simulating dynamic
supply chain processes and policies. AMT is implemented using a client-
server architecture in which the modeling functionality is separated from a
graphical user interface.
The Asset Management Tool is built on the following functional mod-
ules:
•
The data-modeling module provides a relational data interface, includ-
ing product structures, lead times, cost, demand forecast, and the associated
variability information. It has a built-in explosion of BOMs and data-
reduction capabilities, as well as automatic checks for data integrity.
•
The graphical user interface combines supply chain modeling with dia-
logue-based entry of supply chain data. It allows users to build supply net-
works by dragging and dropping model components such as manufacturing
nodes, DCs, and transportation nodes onto the workspace.
•
The experiment manager facilitates the organization and management of
data sets associated with supply chain experiments. It allows users to view and
interactively modify parameters and policies. Further, it provides automated
access to output data generated during experiments and supports a variety of
ﬁle-management operations.
•
The optimization engine performs AMT’s main function: quantifying
the tradeoff between customer service targets and the inventory in the supply
network. It computes target inventory levels throughout the supply network
to minimize overall inventory capital while meeting customer service re-
quirements.
•
The report generator offers a comprehensive view for the performance
of the supply chain under study. Among the reports are inventory, ﬁll rates,
average cycle times, shipments, and customer service levels. It also generates
ﬁnancial results, including revenues, inventory capital, raw material costs,
transportation costs, and activity-based costs, such as material handling and
manufacturing.

Chain (Somers, N.Y.), expressed, “We have deployed AMT to assist exter-
nal companies in managing their supply chains, with effective results.”
AMT quantiﬁes beneﬁts of channel assembly.
To Briant’s point, the team used
AMT to model the beneﬁts of channel assembly in which business partners
stock a collection of components and build machines to order in their own
facilities when customer orders arrive. AMT was used to assess the impacts
of channel assembly in different product-mix settings.
The analysis helped the division to determine optimal policies for channel
assembly. It also has extended the use of AMT throughout PSG North Amer-
ica and European markets and in the detailed supply chains of several business
partners. The studies have helped improve the PSG extended supply chain.
For example, Jim Manton, president and COO of Pinacor (Phoenix,
Ariz.), acknowledges, “The results that the AMT team delivered on the
supply chain analysis have helped us identify opportunities for optimizing
the product ﬂow between our companies.” 
Further, Mac McNeill, senior vice president of global operations at GE
Capital IT Solutions (Cincinnati), explains, “The modeling allowed us to
develop a base case using actual end-user customer sales and then to quickly
model and optimize many alternatives.” These were based on various levels
of GE forecast accuracy, IBM ﬁll rates, transit times, in-bound and out-
bound delays, and commonality of parts.
“The optimization results allow us to develop action plans to balance im-
proved levels of serviceability with lower levels of inventory,” McNeill relates.
IBM goes commercial with supply chain analysis tool.
Out of the reengineering
initiative and the success of the AMT, IBM has introduced Supply Chain
Analyzer. It uses the technologies and framework to enable companies to
make strategic business decisions about the design and operation of their
supply chains that directly impact ﬁnancial results. The tool enables business
and operational policies to incorporate dynamic supply chain evaluation.

For over 10 years, International Game Technology (Reno, Nev.), relied on
traditional MRP systems to manage inventories. However, as their markets
Case Studies of Success
493

evolved from high-volume/low-mix to low-volume/high-mix, the de-
signer and manufacturer of gaming equipment saw inventories rise over $50
million, inventory turns languish at two per year, and shortages increase ex-
ponentially. To turn this situation around, International Game Technology
used the inventory quality ratio (IQR) technique to prioritize the biggest
opportunities for quick reductions.
“In the past, several programs were undertaken to remedy our inventory
problems,” explains Richard Hardcastle, CPIM, manager of material plan-
ning. “Each one achieved a degree of success but was quickly replaced with
another when business conditions changed.”
The most recent initiative, he notes, was to create a long-term solution.
This solution was bolstered by the speciﬁc short-term objective of reducing
inventory levels by $10 million before the end of the ﬁscal year, which was
less than four months away. 
IQR helps achieve rapid inventory reduction.
“The inventory quality ratio is
both an approach for managing inventory dollars and a new technique for
measuring inventory performance,” explains Gary Gossard, president of
IQR International, Inc. (San Juan Capistrano, Calif.; 949-487-5400). The
IQR logic ﬁrst divides inventory into three groups: items with future re-
quirements; items with no future requirements but with recent past usage;
and items with neither.
The items in these groups are then stratiﬁed into typical ABC-type clas-
siﬁcations using their future dollar requirements, their past dollar usages, or
their current dollar balances, respectively. A target inventory level or rule is
set for each item based on its classiﬁcation. The balance on hand of each item
is compared to the rule, and the dollars of each item are categorized as either
active (A1 or A2), excess (E1, E2, or E3), slow-moving (SM), or no-moving
(NM). These are the inventory quality categories.
“The inventory quality ratio is the ratio of the active inventory dollars
to total inventory dollars,” explains Gossard. In a theoretically perfect situa-
tion, the IQR is 100%.
The IQR in application at International Gaming Technology.
“The IQR meth-
odology examines every item in the inventory, compares it to dynamic tar-
get levels, prioritizes the exceptions based on the dollar impact, and provides
performance ratios for each planner and segment of the inventory,” Hard-
castle said at a recent Annual APICS International Conference. 
Using nominal inventory rules of 4-12-24 weeks’ supply for A, B, and
494
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

C items, respectively, the initial IQR in June 1998 was 30%. “This meant
that 30% of our inventory dollars were active and 70% were tied up in ex-
cess, slow, or no-moving items,” Hardcastle explains. Slow and no-moving
items amounted to nearly 10% of the dollars, and one category (E2) ac-
counted for 50% of total inventory dollars.
Scoring the “big” hit.
“IQR was used to identify and prioritize the biggest
opportunities for us to quickly reduce inventory dollars without creating
more shortage situations,” he reports. “Interestingly enough, these were not
with the slow and no-moving items, but with the $27 million of Excess 2 in-
ventories.”
IQR provided the week’s supply information for the planner/buyers to
monitor and adjust scheduled receipts dates based on assembly requirements
and the impact on inventory dollars. “We were able to reschedule many
high-dollar receipts closer to their actual need date,” Hardcastle notes. Fur-
ther, during the initial rapid reduction phase, a consultant, R. Michael Don-
ovan (Framingham, Mass.), also showed company managers how to use the
information in IQR to adjust lot sizes and safety stock levels as well.
In the two months prior to ﬁscal year-end, purchased parts inventories
were reduced by $10 million, a 20% reduction. In addition, the reduction in
total inventories in the ﬁve-month rapid reduction phase was $16.4 million,
or 31.5%. 
Expanding the application of the IQR approach to all planner/buyers and to addi-
tional inventory segments.
After experiencing the merits of the IQR meth-
odology, the company deployed IQR tools to all planner/buyers. This ex-
panded their ability to use different parameters and material ordering guide-
lines. “We also began importing the dynamic ABC classiﬁcations developed
within IQR back into our MRP system so that our ordering policies re-
mained current,” explains Hardcastle.
Further, based on the success of the initial efforts, it was decided to expand
the use of IQR to additional segments of the inventory that had been excluded
from the rapid reduction phase because of their high mix and relatively low
dollar volume. This addition actually doubled the number of inventory items
being managed with IQR from 10,000 to 20,000 part numbers.
The not unexpected temporary blip in the improvement trend.
“This move in-
creased our inventory dollars and decreased our IQR performance because
these additional parts had not been previously managed,” he explains.

“We consider the hiccup that this caused in our inventory performance
tracking to be a temporary one and are more than willing to include the ad-
ditional inventory items in a management tool that keeps us focused on dol-
lars, regardless of the type of inventory,” Hardcastle maintains.
Moving into the continuous improvement phase, and more inventory reductions.
The continuous improvement approach that IQR recommends is very
simple and is prefaced with a strong, practical suggestion, Hardcastle notes.
To avoid stalling out, the approach should be tailored to ﬁt into the normal
daily routine of the planner/buyers so that progress is made every week. The
majority of the effort should be focused on very few parts that will return the
biggest results. “We took this advice and started by attacking two or three
parts per planner per week,” he explains.
The ﬁrst step was to stop the bleeding.
“With one of the standard tools in IQR,
we reviewed all slow-moving and no-moving inventory that had open pur-
chase orders,” he explains. Within a two-day period they were able to cancel or
defer several hundred thousand dollars of material that was no longer needed. 
They also used IQR to review their open purchase orders every week
and to identify parts with excess inventory already on hand.
Step two: Clean up accumulated inventories.
“Because we design all of our
gaming machines, we have a very high percentage of unique materials that
no other company can use,” says Hardcastle. “We started to look at ‘trapped’
material that could be reworked into something usable, and we sold off sev-
eral hundred thousand dollars’ worth of electrical components.”
Even though they had a “reasonable” engineering change order process,
obsolete inventory did work its way back into stock. Therefore, they used
IQR regularly to catch this inventory and to reroute it accordingly.
Step three: Focus on managing the supply chain.
“We embarked on a process
to manage the supply chain so that the material ﬂow into the plant was se-
quenced with the week’s supply recommendations from IQR,” he details.
By changing the planning parameters in MRP to reﬂect the recommended
weeks-supply rules in IQR, they have been able to change delivery sched-
ules with the suppliers.
“We now specify more frequent and smaller deliveries, which has driven
inventory down,” he notes. A critical part to making this work is the policy
implementation of material ordering guidelines.

This document provides instruction on the use of planning parameters
such as safety stock, over buys, lot sizing, and other factors that affect inven-
tory. It further provides horizons that planner/buyers use to make long-term
commitments to suppliers.
Moving beyond the “low hanging fruit.”
A major part of the $16.4 million re-
duction during the ﬁrst phase was a 53% reduction in Excess 2 inventories,
which had the additional advantage of improving cash ﬂow by over $14 mil-
lion. Simultaneously, they were able to reduce both the balance on hand and
the open order value for items without requirements by nearly 50%. They
also reduced the value of open orders scheduled to arrive early by 60% and
the open orders for excess inventory by 65%. 
After ﬁve months of rapid inventory reduction, most of the low-
hanging fruit has been picked. Only a few months into the continuous im-
provement phase, the results remain encouraging. “In the past 10 weeks we
have reduced inventory by an additional $3.8 million and have increased our
IQR by 1.5% on a larger base,” Hardcastle details. The IQR for A items has
increased from 44% to 52%; B items have remained constant at 63%; and C
items have improved from 46% to 49%.

With the change to a “lean” corporate culture, there was a signiﬁcant em-
phasis on inventory reduction at Vermeer Manufacturing Co. (Pella, Iowa).
The objectives carved out by management directive were stringent:
• Elimination of all warehouse space
• Raw material inventory reduction of 50% per year minimum
• WIP inventory reduction of 60% minimum
• Finished goods inventory reduction of 75% minimum
Why the need to reduce inventory?
Vermeer management made a commit-
ment to grow at a rate of 15% to 20% per year without building any new
buildings or investing in any more racks. “We were going to achieve our ob-
jectives with what we already had in place,” explains Randy L. Gard, vice
president of global planning (rgard@vermeermfg.com). That objective has
Case Studies of Success

led to a distinct change in inventory philosophy at the builder of construc-
tion, environmental, and agricultural equipment.
“In the past, inventory reduction was an operational issue,” maintains
Gard. “Today, there’s a shift away from the former position.” Part of the rea-
son is Vermeer’s sheer size and new philosophy. At the Pella site, Vermeer
manufacturing facilities are located on an 88-acre campus in eight plants, all
of which operate autonomously. Thus, the inventory reduction initiative be-
came very focused.
For example, one of the primary reasons for the inventory reduction is
to free up ﬂoor space to allow for future growth in other areas or products.
“Our warehouse space will go away,” afﬁrms Gard. “We will be building prod-
uct in the former warehouse space, and no longer store anything in there.
To date, we’ve taped up close to a quarter of the former warehouse ﬂoor
space.”
Point of use storage preferred.
Inventory will now go to the point-of-use, on-
the-line concept in each factory. “What we’re doing is carrying ﬁve days of
inventory on the shop ﬂoor instead of having quantities in the warehouse,”
Gard explains. 
A beneﬁt, he notes, is that the cash previously invested in maintaining
and storing the inventory in massive warehouses now “hits the balance sheet
and instead is available to fund future growth, acquisitions, and new prod-
ucts.”
Quality is also a major concern.
Gard relates that “lower inventory levels help
to improve the product quality, as the fewer parts there are in stock, the bet-
ter the control.” There is less chance of building obsolete or excess inven-
tory. 
Less inventory will reduce Vermeer’s throughput, or lead time. “Our
initiative for this year, from the time the customer orders the product until
we ship it, is to cut it in half,” he notes. “It’s a formidable challenge,” he ac-
knowledges, “but we’re working to do it with less on-hand, Vermeer-
owned inventory.” Part of the initiative requires the “full integration of the
suppliers into our supply chain.”
Vermeer’s approach to inventory reduction.
Gard outlined their initiative,
which places increased responsibility on suppliers. For example, Vermeer in-
vited their suppliers in to discuss their goals, both current and future. “The
more you know and the more they know, the better the opportunity to draw
498
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

down inventory,” he explained at a recent NAPM Supply Chain Manage-
ment Conference. 
“To be successful, you have to be willing to talk about numbers-even ﬁ-
nancials-with suppliers, how much you plan to grow and what it means to
them,” he maintains. “We went so far as to tell them what model and what
options, and also gave them a forecast for every model we have and told them
we would be updating it weekly.” In practice, Vermeer e-mails a report to its
suppliers at the end of every day notifying them of the day’s production. 
“We tell them, for instance, that we built eight machines today, instead
of the planned nine or seven, as the case may be,” Gard explains. “This ad-
vises them to adjust the incoming shipment so we don’t overstock or run
short.” 
Vermeer also holds ﬁve-day kaizen events with cross-functional teams,
which include the supplier representatives, in an effort to gain additional in-
put for inventory reduction, cost improvements, and the like. “We brought
in the suppliers, and they spent time in our plants learning what we do, how
we build the products, and how our products work,” he explains. This ex-
ercise helps to convert the supplier sales people into inventory and engi-
neering support people.
Inventory metrics keeps all parties on target.
Vermeer also instituted an exten-
sive measurement program. Included are calculating inventory turns based
on cost of goods sold and measuring actual throughput time in minutes
rather than days or weeks. Additionally, they review and chart forecast ver-
sus actual planning accuracy and track accuracy of low lead times on com-
ponents.
Gard is quick to share another inventory reduction technique: the dust/
rack metric. “We take all of our buyers out into the plants and ask them to
look at the racks, shelves, benches, and tables, and ask them to tell us the part
number that has the largest amount of dust on it,” he relates. “Whatever parts
have gathered the most dust probably means that we have too much of them
in stock, so we tell them to deal with it. The buyers have carte blanche.” In
some cases, the suppliers take it back for a restocking fee. “Based on our cost
of carrying the inventory, we were able to pay the restocking fee and still
come out ahead,” he mentions. 
In the short period of time since the program has been implemented,
the results have been really impressive. Vermeer is a private company that
does not release ﬁnancial data publicly. However, at the close of the last ﬁs-
cal year, the inventory reduction efforts generated multimillion dollar
Case Studies of Success

savings; the parts center has been converted into consignment inventory (see
sidebar), and all safety stock is now carried at supplier locations for “seasonal
bumps in the road.” In addition, the cash ﬂow has improved signiﬁcantly, and
growth has been achieved without requiring new brick and mortar.

When Racal Electronics PLC announced its decision to divest its Racal-
Datacom division, the only directive from top management was to sharply
reduce inventory. The small but determined materials group did just that-
reducing inventory by 50% and still counting-by using a series of tools and
instituting a series of actions that might also serve others who are looking to
slash their inventories.
Bringing reasonableness to the forecasts.
“Like most service-based companies,
we tended to overforecast,” says Donna Aubuchon, materials manager, and
Mac Borgendale, CFPIM, master scheduling specialist, at the successor or-
ganization, Milgo Solutions, Inc. (Sunrise, Fla.; www.milgo.com). “We had
implemented sales and operations planning, but until the crisis we still tended
to forecast more at the unit level than we forecast as total sales dollars.”
The forecast was forced down to the level of historical sales and then

Vermeer Moves to Integrated Supply for Its MRO Inventory
Vermeer recently entered into a ﬁve-year (with options for renewal) single-
source arrangement with Don E. Williams Company (deWco) for its MRO
inventory. According to Don Adams, vice president of deWco, “Previously,
Vermeer owned all the inventory in the four large tool cribs, all the bench
stock, and the inventory kept in the ‘little’ tool cribs on the shop ﬂoor.”
Now deWco owns all that inventory, and Vermeer pays for it as it is used,
or even after it is used, he notes. One speciﬁc that Adams related at the
MRO/PRO 2000 Conference (Institute for International Research) was that
under the agreement, deWco added and manages 16 to 20 point-of-use
“mini” tool cribs that are located on each focused plant shop ﬂoor. “Our per-
sonnel come on site, manage them, and take care of the inventory,” he ex-
plains. Over time, it is expected that this arrangement will expand.
Vermeer will reap still additional beneﬁts from its inventory reduction
initiative.

again to expected sales. “We accepted that this might affect some customers,
as we would no longer have inventory to cover large orders in one or two
weeks,” Aubuchon and Borgendale explained at a recent APICS Annual In-
ternational Conference.
Compressing MRP horizon from one year to six months.
The second action the
materials group took, after reducing the forecast, was to tighten the MRP
horizon. This immediately stopped the purchase of items needed beyond six
months. “Since we had the personnel to handle the inefﬁciencies, we also
instituted a review of all purchase signals, again reducing total purchases,”
they reported. “We expected to absorb inefﬁciency as a cost of inventory re-
duction.”
Instead, as the buyers had fewer open purchase orders, they received
fewer reschedule messages, and their workload went down. “As we analyzed
purchase signals, we found inﬂated lead times, unnecessary lot sizing pa-
rameters, and old, invalid requirements in our MRP system,” they explain.
As they ﬁxed these, purchases and purchase signals continued to drop. After
one year, they have returned to the one-year MRP horizon, but they still re-
view all purchase signals.
Reducing manufacturing lot sizes has an impact on WIP.
“At ﬁrst we reduced
lot sizes because we were uncertain about the future,” they offer, “but then
we reduced them because the forecast was down.” As they reduced lot sizes,
they also effectively reduced the total work in process, making the factory
more efﬁcient and allowing further reductions in lot sizes.
“We also found that, as a by-product of the lot size reductions, we were
able to reduce manufacturing lead time,” they explain. This not only re-
duced inventory through reduced WIP, but it also made the factory more
efﬁcient and responsive. Lead times are down about 50%, and Milgo now
can build from components in one to two weeks. “We no longer need to
stock ﬁnished goods or subassemblies,” they note.
Getting control of the 100,000-plus parts inventory.
With over 100,000 parts
in inventory (about 20,000 active), a signiﬁcant commonality of parts, and a
12-year old MRP system, part classiﬁcation of inventory was not an easy
project. However, with the divestiture announcement, Aubuchon and Bor-
gendale realized that they had to initiate a project to classify the inventory
by product.
“Our ﬁrst analysis was done using a Pareto analysis of top-dollar items,”
they explained. “We analyzed, by hand, the top items, looking at MRP and
Case Studies of Success
501

the BOM where used, and then extrapolated an estimate to the entire in-
ventory.” However, they needed a solution that they could duplicate on a
regular basis. In addition, they wanted to classify all of the parts. They knew
how to extract stock status information from the MRP system, but the ﬁle
was too large for the state-of-the-art spreadsheet software. Instead, they used
available database software to create an index of parts to product family.
“We used software that we already had, and as we slowly perfected our
reports, we also continued to classify parts working down the Pareto list,”
they reported. “Each step down the descending dollar list yielded less result
for more effort, but it also required less accuracy.”
A system to identify parts and inventory dollars.
It took about four months to
ﬁnish, and now it takes about two hours per month to maintain. With the
classiﬁcation index, they are able to identify parts and inventory dollars to
speciﬁc families. This information became critical as families were either sold
or discontinued. “We also are able to identify inventory dollars to the master
scheduler [planner] of each product,” they explain. “Inventory control be-
came the responsibility of the employee making planning decisions, and that
individual now has visibility to understand the impact of his or her decisions.”
While creating the index, they found a number of items that did not ac-
tively relate to any product family. This became their obsolete family, for the
ﬁrst time enabling them to identify what is obsolete. The obsolete family list has
made it possible to salvage or scrap a signiﬁcant chunk of inventory, they note.
How safety stock was cut by almost 90%.
“Like most ﬁrms with high service
goals, we kept a lot of safety stock,” they acknowledged. With 20,000 active
parts, it was hard to manage safety stock levels. “The need to safety stock
some components for assembly-to-order also made it difﬁcult to identify in-
valid [dependent demand] safety stocks,” Aubuchon and Borgendale note.
Four factors enabled them to reduce their safety stock levels:
1. The ﬁrst was the management directive to reduce inventory. This led
to an immediate review and an “immediate, common sense reduction” that
averaged 50%.
2. With management willing to accept longer lead time on large orders,
the safety factor went down, allowing reductions in safety stock. “Quoting
a longer lead time on a large order was no longer career-threatening,” they
declare.
502
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

3. As manufacturing lead times went down and factory on-time deliver-
ies went up, the standard deviation of demand during lead time went down.
4. The critical factor was the index of products, pointing safety stock to
the family and master scheduler.
After one year, two major reviews of safety stock, and weekly reviews
of purchase signals, safety stock is down about 90%, representing a savings of
$2 million.
The impact of product rationalization on inventory reduction.
Typical of high-
mix companies, Milgo Solutions ﬁnds it difﬁcult to discontinue any prod-
uct. “We also ﬁnd it easy to add special conﬁgurations for one or two cus-
tomers,” they reveal.
A major effort was made at the time of divestiture-and it continues to-
day-to rationalize the product offerings. They set out to determine three
numbers for each family. They sought the annual revenue, the inventory in
dollars, and the number of printed circuit assemblies.
After two months of developing data, they found that half of the printed
circuit assemblies, half of the inventory, and half of the overhead supported
only 10% of revenue. “We found that inventory levels are a function of the
number of printed circuit assemblies, and not a function of the revenue gen-
erated,” they declared.
The results, in just a year, have been astounding.
“We are still in the process of
developing future strategy and still taking small steps to continue our im-
provement,” Aubuchon and Borgendale offer. However, they do note the
following achievements to date:
• Inventory has been slashed by more than 50% during the last year, rep-
resenting a savings of $30 million, and inventory continues to drop by almost
$1 million per month. Only about 20% of the reductions were due to scrap
of obsolete inventory. The rest was used to build product for customers.
• The number of product families is down from about 80 to 24, and the
number of printed circuit assemblies being built is down about 50%.
• Customer service levels have increased from 88% on time to 98% on
time, and the response time is down approximately one week.

At long last, the rhetoric of inventory management technology has become
reality. According to our latest reader study, an overwhelming number of re-
spondents—more than three in four—report that they have installed, are
currently using, or are planning to introduce new hardware and software
speciﬁcally focused to manage inventories better.
Encouraged by the dividends from previous technology-oriented in-
vestments, inventory managers are spending more on these solutions.
Greater inventory turns, lower inventory levels, faster inventory velocities,
and higher inventory accuracies are just some of the justiﬁcations cited when
seeking additional funding for technology.
It must be working, as Inventory Reduction Report reader surveys ﬁnd that
technology-oriented practices are gaining in preference at a greater rate than
is any other category. For example, installing new inventory management
software is up more than 53% compared to two years ago. Bar coding, radio
frequency (RF), and automated ID systems applications have shot up almost
25% in just the last year. In addition, more inventory management profes-
sionals are adopting vendor managed inventory (VMI) and quick response
practices and are upgrading or installing new warehouse management sys-
tems (WMSs).
Following are some typical reader responses:
• “Our previous system was archaic, so we purchased new software
(JDA/E3) to manage our inventory, forecasting, and several other related
504

functions that impact on our inventory,” says the ﬁnance vice president at a
large retailer.
• “We are now using a new inventory control system along with DRP
software and other processes to monitor lead-time components to better
control the product ﬂow,” explains the director of logistics at a large pro-
ducer of wireless messaging products.
• “We’ve developed analysis programs that will better enable us to de-
termine and monitor our inventory position by category and SKU. We an-
ticipate this tighter control of order quantity will have a signiﬁcant impact
on our current safety and cycle stock,” advises an inventory analyst at a large
manufacturer of consumer electronics.
• “Our emphasis has been in making improvements to our existing
warehouse management system,” reports a vice president of a large trans-
portation/distribution provider. “The updating involves adding RF capabil-
ities so our management is immediately notiﬁed when a warehouseman has
an inventory problem.”
It is still predominantly a “big” plant thing.
However, a lot of interest in new
technology has been reported also among those employed in facilities with
fewer than 500 employees. While current installations may lag in midsize or-
ganizations, these survey participants are among the most active in planning
future installations.
Many survey respondents shared their experiences in greater detail.
Decrease raw material inventory.
Many of the respondents detailed their tech-
nology selections and provided great insight into where they are directing
their capital funding and into the beneﬁts that they have received. For ex-
ample, a materials manager at a midsize manufacturer of bearing systems
explains, “By implementing an updated software system, we had more ﬂex-
ibility in utilizing different planning and procurement methods. Use of
reorder point purchase planning has helped us to decrease raw materials in
some areas by more than 50%.” She also reports that work in progress (WIP)
inventory is down “signiﬁcantly” because of changes in manufacturing pro-
cesses, the institution of kanban practices, and the elimination of safety
stock.
“We implemented demand chain principles,” explains the director of
purchasing and logistics at a small maker of promotional materials. “We feed
our production plans into a materials deployment planning tool that allows
Technology/Computers/Software

our deployment planners to then pass along the data to the supply base,” he
explains. “Not only has this dramatically reduced our inventory levels, but
it also has led to a vast improvement in the quality of our materials as lim-
ited storage time reduces the potential for crushing, bending, and warping.”
In addition, they have developed and initiated an inventory location system,
an inventory tracking system, and daily cycle counting procedures that have
improved inventory accuracy to 98% since launch.
Improve forecast accuracy to optimize inventory levels.
“We are in a major tran-
sition,” says the material vice president of a steel distributor. “Our long-term
objective is to increase service levels by having stock on the shelf, ready for
customer release. However, at the same time we will be driving down our
raw inventory.” Working toward these goals, the company is now in the im-
plementation phase of an inventory optimization software program. “We
were looking for a mechanism to more accurately predict sales and part
number forecasts,” he notes. “We evaluated several different packages and
selected the one with a projected payback of 18 months.”
Meanwhile, a business/supply planner at a midsize chemical processing
facility describes his major challenge as trying to reduce year-end invento-
ries when that is the highest inventory point in the year because of seasonal
and winter weather contingencies. He outlines the solution: “New inven-
tory setting tools automatically feed a supply/demand planning tool that de-
velops long-range inventory targets. That, in turn, automatically feeds a
scheduling tool that controls inventory to the target levels throughout the
supply chain.” Forecast demand is used as the basis for setting inventory as
well as the standard deviation of the last 12 months of demand at the SKU
level. The data and statistics are automatically generated on a demand man-
agement tool each month, he adds.
“We installed PC-based forecasting software to improve our projections
for aftermarket purchases,” says the director of business coordination and lo-
gistics at a major manufacturer of bearings. “We’ve been able to reduce af-
termarket inventory by 7% and have cut our slow-moving inventory by
15%.” The manufacturer now plans to extend the application beyond the
aftermarket requirements and test an advanced planning system.
Better management of on-hand balances.
The director of materials manage-
ment at a health care services organization responds, “Our acquisition of in-
ventory software in concert with our migration to integrated material man-
agement/ﬁnancial applications has enabled us to acquire tools to better
506
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

manage set/reset order points and on-hand balances. Also, we now are bet-
ter able to assess lead-time requirements by product and by vendor to min-
imize our inventory levels.”
Implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.
“We developed a
core business team of managers to address our business systems and con-
ducted kaizen activities,” reports a production control manager at a large
producer of automotive electronics. “Since installing our ERP system, along
with new MRP II software, we’ve seen an increase in delivery performance
and have reduced our line stoppages due to materials shortages.” They also
have a goal of reducing inventory by $9 million by the end of the year.
“We’re well on target toward accomplishing that,” he predicts.
The business manager at a large manufacturer of telecommunications
equipment says, “We implemented an SAP system at our manufacturing and
distribution facility to increase inventory visibility and automate our pro-
duction planning and purchasing activities.” He acknowledges that raw ma-
terial inventory increased 20% because of a problem with the new system
that handles consigned stock, and ﬁnished goods inventory was up slightly
(10%) because of “poor service performance as a result of system conver-
sion.” However, they are now starting to reﬁne the range of coverage and
safety stock levels. There’s also been a headcount reduction in the materials
planning department.
The materials manager at a small producer of industrial laundry equip-
ment credits the implementation of an ERP system and the continuous re-
view of safety stock, order quantities, and lead times for reducing ﬁnished
goods inventories by 25% over the past three years. “Our ERP system drives
about 95% of product replenishment, which eliminates the emotion from
ordering and time-phased replenishment,” he expresses. “The reports help
us to better identify slow and nonmoving inventory, but we still need to im-
prove our process to deal with engineering changes.”
“We’re in the process of implementing a fully integrated ERP system
with warehouse management, transportation management, and bar coding
software modules,” says an operations specialist at a large petrochemical fa-
cility. “We believe, when complete, we’ll have global visibility of inventory,
as our corporation has plants producing similar or same materials world-
wide.”
A large manufacturer of diagnostic medical ultrasound devices installed
its SAP system in May 1998. “We are still in the process of reﬁning the sys-
tem and educating individuals on how to use the available data,” the senior
Technology/Computers/Software
507

director of production planning and distribution shares. “Disciplines are still
not 100% but are getting better.”
“We have put in place a PeopleSoft ERP system with enhanced reports
and lead-time factors,” states the senior manager of global logistics at a large
producer of semiconductors. “Our major improvement has been in gaining
real-time information.”
“Currently we do not have a formal integrated system, as our inventory
is managed by a series of stand-alone systems,” reports a purchasing and in-
ventory control manager at a midsize maker of truck bodies. “We’re in the
ﬁnal phase of selecting and implementing a materials resource system that
will aid in managing engineering, manufacturing, and inventory, as we’ve
been growing at a 25% annual rate for the past few years.”
Use electronic data interchange (EDI) to improve forecasting efforts.
The supplier
manager at a small producer of weighing scales shares that since installing an
EDI system, they have “better control of our A, B, C, D, E, and F inventory
parts, and gain earlier visibility into potential obsolete inventory.”
Just-in-time (JIT) and bar coding combine to cut inventory and employee levels.
“In one division, we have implemented more JIT work projects using dis-
tributor stock, delivery, and job kitting,” explains a vice president at a large
utility. In addition, they have moved to bar coding technology for receiving,
issuing, inventory counts, and tool room applications. Further, the company
is piloting VMI for fast-moving items. With the improvements, inventory
has been reduced almost 60%, and full-time equivalents for company ware-
house workers have decreased 20%.
Reduce ﬁnished goods and raw materials when sharing plans with customer.
“We’ve
moved to automatic data collection and are in the process of getting all of our
vendors to bar code their materials,” notes an MRP II manager at a large
packaging manufacturer. “We interfaced an RF system to our MRP II sys-
tem and use it for receiving and locating purposes.” He adds, “We’ve worked
on improving the accuracy of production plans by end item, which when
blown through the MRP system creates a better suggestion for raw materi-
als.” Additionally, by sharing plans with customers and including their inven-
tories, “we’ve reduced both ﬁnished goods and raw materials inventories.”
Examining all the variables in the supply chain.
“We use an inventory target-
setting tool that factors in all key supply chain variables,” notes a customer
508
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

service supervisor at a midsize maker of lube oil additives. “Our demand
management, supply/demand planning, and plant scheduling tools have re-
inforced the business process reengineering of the supply chain,” he adds.
On-time performance and supply chain costs have improved substantially
along with an inventory reduction of more than 20%.
Heighten ability to identify slow-moving stock more quickly.
“We implemented
an improved inventory management software solution to forecast slow-
moving items and apply appropriate safety stock distribution to achieve
higher service levels,” maintains an inventory and customer service manager
at a major manufacturer of earth-moving machinery. To date, ﬁnished goods
inventory has fallen by 5%.
The director of logistics at a large medical supplies manufacturer is us-
ing the “capability of our warehouse management system to identify prod-
uct that has not sold in six months and those that have more than six months
of supply in stock.” This has helped to eliminate a lot of “non-value-added
inventory.” The savings he reports translate into a 20% reduction in space re-
quirements and 10 days of supply reduction. He credits the “bottom-up
forecast improvement at the weekly, DC [distribution center], and SKU lev-
els.”
The warehouse supervisor at a midsize maker of maintenance equip-
ment reports, “We added a module to identify and extract part numbers that
do not have any activity during a speciﬁed period.” This has helped in obso-
lescence analysis. “By doing this, the quantity of part numbers to be analyzed
is reduced, saving money,” he says.
Tighten control and improve accuracy during triple-digit sales growth.
“We’ve had
a 100% increase in our sales but wanted to limit our additional raw material,
WIP, and ﬁnished goods stocks,” offers a purchasing manager at a small man-
ufacturer of engineering wood products. “We’ve implemented PeopleSoft
version 7.5 for purchasing and accounts payable,” he explains. “The system
is more user friendly and allows for better inventory accuracy and control.
Since this is an enterprise-wide system, all of our plants and locations have
access to the same vendor base and common item stock numbers.”
Gain control of inventory when business declines.
“We installed an ADP Distri-
bution 2000 inventory management system,” explains a materials manager
at a midsize wholesale distributor. “This has helped us not only with inven-
tory management but also with forecasting and purchasing. It has been
Technology/Computers/Software
509

instrumental in reducing inventory when our business began to slow down,”
he describes. “The system adjusted safety stock levels, demand, and fore-
casting time cycles.”
Couple high-tech system with traditional methods to review inventory opportunities.
“Inventory control is a signiﬁcant priority for our planning group,” states the
director of materials management at a midsize producer of pharmaceuticals.
“We’re operating with 50% higher raw materials and WIP inventory levels so
we can support a 250% increase in plant throughput. But we’ve been able to
decrease ﬁnished goods inventories by 25% due to reduced plant cycle times.”
Additionally, they use an SAP system, coupled with traditional methods
of A, B, C analysis, suggested order quantities (SOQs), and monthly data re-
views to keep their inventories within control.
Replace a manual system to achieve savings.
“We had a software system that
still required a large amount of manual effort,” explains a purchasing man-
ager at a small manufacturer of paper products. “We have since added new
software, and while it’s difﬁcult to put actual savings on it, we believe that
we may be freeing up three to four full-time people.” Further, he advises,
“We’re working a lot closer with our suppliers, electronically sharing fore-
casts and production schedules in an effort to further reduce lead times and
increase our inventory turns.”
“We have had problems with vendor purchasing schedules and as a re-
sult do not know when to order,” explains a purchasing manager at a small
industrial distributor. “Our solution was to develop a day-to-day computer-
ized calendar of purchases for each supplier based on our parts-per-day ba-
sis. This calendar has solved our inventory control and service level prob-
lems,” he notes. Currently, the company is investigating an update to the
automated purchasing system.
A Lawson inventory control, accounts receivable, account payable
package was installed at a midsize manufacturer of wood doors. “There was
no inventory control system in place before, and we essentially guessed on
our inventory,” the purchasing manager acknowledges. “Since installing
Lawson’s version 6.0, we’ve been able to reduce overall inventory by 30% in
two years. We now can track special parts for shorter lead times.”
A controller at a small maker of photographic equipment tells of their
J. D. Edwards inventory control system. “It has allowed us to better control
our inventory levels. Also, we have smaller cycle count variances and an eas-
ier time tracking variances.”

Using bar coding technology to improve ﬁnished goods inventory accuracies.
“Our
bar coding application has made a deﬁnite impact in increasing the accuracy
of our ﬁnished goods inventory,” says the cost/inventory control manager at
a midsize furniture manufacturer. “There has been a tremendous decrease in
labor dollars and manual errors that were formerly associated with the trans-
actions and time spent expediting and searching for product.” Further, she
explains, “We currently offer over 100 fabric selections to our customers.
These fabrics have high minimum-order quantities and long lead times.
Forecasting is difﬁcult due to the lead times and changing trends in selec-
tions.” The organization plans to add a new position of inventory/materials
manager, which will also include a forecasting responsibility. “Since we are
putting more responsibility in this area, we’ll be looking into forecasting
software packages that will help us to further reduce our high levels of fab-
ric inventory.”
Adding a parts allocation module.
“It has eliminated an ‘unattached’ parts al-
location program and provided a real-time inquiry as to the status of open
production orders,” explains a materials manager at a midsize producer of
valves and ﬁttings.
Two-way VMI practice levels inventory.
“We’re a believer of vendor managed
inventory, and we practice it with both our suppliers and customers,” explains
an inventory management director at a steel minimill. “It has enabled us to
lower both our raw materials and ﬁnished goods inventories.” In addition, he
tells of using computerized inventory level control techniques to “capture
35% of the existing merchant bar customer base by guaranteeing 100% order
ﬁll rate with no stockouts. We’ve seen a 10% time reduction in order entry
and a 5% freight reduction since starting this practice,” he explains.
WMS installation enhances loading accuracy.
“The capacity of our ﬁnished
goods warehouse is only three days of production,” explains the warehouse
manager at a small builder of wood products. “The new warehouse man-
agement system has been responsible for helping us to achieve a 15% reduc-
tion in ﬁnished goods inventory, along with shrinking our raw materials re-
quirements by 30%.” The WMS installation also links to their order entry
system and includes RF scanning, which updates production and inventory
tracking, from order entry to load sequencing cargo. “This arrangement has
generated 5% faster dock times and 3% better loading accuracy,” the man-
ager details.

A lead person in inventory control at a major manufacturer of material
handling equipment “implemented a warehouse management system three
years ago to better utilize the cube within our distribution center.” To date,
inventory accuracy has increased 15%, and space utilization has improved
30%.
Upgrading existing MRP systems.
“We are in the process of converting our
Unix-based MRP system to a Windows NT–based system,” says a planning
and logistics supervisor at a small manufacturer of electronic equipment.
“This will allow us greater ﬂexibility, improved efﬁciency, and easier man-
agement of inventory data.”
“We switched to a new scheduling software, called Rhythm, from i2
Technologies,” answers a materials manager at a large manufacturer of ofﬁce
furniture. “Before setting up the new software, we ran a traditional MRP
through our mainframe in which materials were based on weekly require-
ments. Rhythm has taken us from weekly to daily requirements,” she ex-
plains.
MRP II software minimizes inventory increases.
“Our sales have increased by
more than 20%, yet our overall inventory increase is a mere fraction,” main-
tains a production planning manager at a small producer of natural foods.
“Forecasting and safety stock levels have been kept to a manageable level,”
he notes, pointing out that they are “still in the early stages of MRP usage.”
Currently, they are building the correct mix of inventory to maintain high
availability without stockpiling product, the manager shares.
“By installing Alliance MRP II software, we were forced to organize
our inventory by developing a simple part numbering system,” says an ad-
ministrative/inventory manager at a small maker of components for satellite
communication systems. “Now our inventory is always at least 95% accurate
by count, and we’re more efﬁcient in tracking inventory with our subcon-
tractors. It also saved us from hiring an additional person.”
The future: more MRP/ERP integrations.
“One of the most successful in-
ventory management solutions we have witnessed is in implementing MRP/
ERP systems,” declares a management consultant with an extensive supply
chain management practice. “From our experience, we have seen that
better-managed inventories allow for more opportunities to reduce total
supply chain cost without shifting any cost to other parties.” He explains,
“This is an enterprise-wide effort, and not relegated only to inventory man-
512
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

agement. The most important step is to understand the process, then sim-
plify it before automating.” For those considering such an approach, the
consultant estimates that the project takes from four to eight months to com-
plete.
Not now, but in the future.
A number of readers acknowledged not making
any recent upgrades or new systems installations. However, they did em-
phasize that changes were under consideration or in planning. Among the
more common replies were the following:
• “We’re looking into bar code applications. Installation is planned for
midyear and should facilitate speed and accuracy of inventory management
transactions,” offers a production control manager at a midsize producer of
door controls.
• “We have a program that will be installed during the third quarter that
will allow us greater ﬂexibility in reviewing inventory from several different
aspects,” explains a logistics director at a small maker of medical devices.
• “We will be installing a new forecast system during 1999. We want
to take advantage of real time change versus monthly mainframe change, and
we believe we can then make some signiﬁcant and lasting inventory reduc-
tions,” describes an inventory control manager at a small producer of air ﬁl-
ters.

Many small to midsize organizations have purchased, or plan to purchase,
WMSs, inventory management software, or enterprise solutions. However,
smaller installations are a relatively new and untried market segment for
many of the software vendors. Therefore, individuals in these companies
and software vendors alike are not fully aware of the unique problems that
size can present to complicate implementation and threaten success, ac-
cording to one leading expert.
“Implementation challenges are often daunting and may encompass
various issues, from software selection and scalability, to methodology and
mindset, people, and personalities,” describes Jay Taylor, CPIM, executive
director of professional services at Macola Software (Marion, Ohio; www.
Technology/Computers/Software
513

macola.com). He reviews nine speciﬁc challenges that await the inventory
management professional when selecting a software solution and provides
some guidelines that should be considered to reduce the angst.
Challenge #1: Scalability of the software solution.
“One problem small ﬁrms
experience in buying packaged solutions is that the software is not really
geared to the size and scope of their business,” Taylor explained during the
“IT in the Enterprise” track at National Manufacturing Week. “One size
does not ﬁt all.”
It is only logical that applications designed to meet the needs of global
companies will have advanced capabilities and complex features that a
smaller ﬁrm may never need and should not have to pay for, he explains.
“Technology ‘overkill’ is not only more costly to begin with, but will likely
prove to be more complicated to implement and conﬁgure in a small enter-
prise, and will deﬁnitely cost more over the long haul for maintenance and
upgrades,” Taylor notes.
It makes much more sense for small to midsize organizations, he advises,
to source proven solutions scaled to their speciﬁc needs, with the ﬂexibility
to upgrade and expand as business needs change and grow.
Challenge #2: Streamlining implementation methodology.
Large software ven-
dors and systems integrators serving large clients have devised effective im-
plementation methodologies comprising hundreds of individual steps and
milestones that take at least a year. This prolonged implementation is far be-
yond the scope of smaller companies and is totally unacceptable.
A small organization needs to get the job done in far less time. However,
the general framework will be similar to that used in large implementations.
The steps include mapping out the plan, deﬁning the scope, securing man-
agement commitment, modeling the processes, developing the pilot, con-
verting the entering data, and testing comprehensively. Each of the elements
can be simpliﬁed if a software package of the right size has been chosen. 
“Most software vendors provide rapid implementation tools and tem-
plates that enable fast, easy conﬁguration without customized code, speed-
ing implementation and ROI [return on investment],” Taylor assures.
Challenge #3: Setting realistic expectations.
Most small companies do not
have an information systems (IS) department, and usually a single employee
ﬁlls the role. The people involved in deﬁning the business processes and en-
514
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

tering data are the same people who will be using the system after it is in-
stalled. 
Given this scenario, it is essential to establish open, honest communica-
tions among all concerned right from the start. This includes company man-
agement, key employees, system users, the software vendor, and business
partners or integrators. “It might also be advisable to have an experienced
consulting partner who can act as facilitator, mediator, coach, and cheer-
leader through the rigors of implementation,” Taylor suggests.
Challenge #4: Allocation of resources; not just the integrator’s job.
Securing
the commitment of management and enthusiastic buy-in of users is a key
element of any successful implementation. Taylor also notes the increas-
ing trend among companies to ask for a consultant’s guarantee of a suc-
cessful implementation and even link compensation with guaranteed re-
sults. 
“This trend is commendable, so long as the buyer doesn’t abdicate its
own responsibilities, a situation that tends to occur more in smaller compa-
nies, where personnel resources are already stretched,” he warns. “The com-
pany management or project steering committee has responsibility for en-
suring the people assigned to the project will be available, motivated, and
focused, with no political maneuvering or inﬁghting.”
Challenge #5: Overcoming the fear of change.
Handling fear and insecurity is
a task best performed by leaders with change management and project man-
agement skills. They will involve users in the implementation process and
provide frequent reassurance that using the system effectively is doable given
time and training. “Once it becomes demonstrable that the system will make
many of their tasks much easier, most employees will ‘buy in’ and become
enthusiastic supports,” Taylor notes.
Challenge #6: Mapping out key business processes.
When building the new
process model, it makes sense to choose the embedded processes and tem-
plates that are most closely aligned with the business. Companies lacking ex-
perience in process deﬁnition can usually turn to the technology partner for
recommendations based on experience and industry best practice.
Because smaller companies may not be familiar with advanced man-
ufacturing technology and concepts, more pressure and responsibility is
placed on the implementation partner to conﬁgure the application properly
Technology/Computers/Software
5 1 5

and assist in aligning processes. Training users in the application’s operation
and maintenance is also critical and must not be overlooked.
Challenge #7: Technical issues—data conversion and disparate systems.
The
good news is that small companies do not have as much data to deal with as
do larger ones. The downside is that their data are seldom organized in one
repository to provide streamlined data conversion.
In many cases business processes are performed manually. In other situ-
ations there may be a homegrown proprietary system or a series of disparate
functional systems from which data must be extracted, cleaned, and con-
verted. “Ample time must be allotted for these tasks if the new system is to
use the data effectively,” Taylor explains. Another key element is to make
sure the data are accurate.
Challenge #8: Tendency toward taking shortcuts.
The process-modeling phase
is typically the longest and most difﬁcult aspect of an implementation, and it
is the most critical to success. “Smaller ﬁrms often have to be sold on this
concept, since their experience with off-the-shelf software is to simply in-
stall it and run it,” he notes. With enterprise applications, running the soft-
ware without accurately modeling the processes can be disastrous.
The challenge for integrators is to convince the individuals in smaller
organizations to suppress their ingrained “we’ll do it ourselves” mentality, to
slow down and take the time required to model the processes, develop the
pilot, perform parallel testing, and make adjustments. Because of limited re-
sources and a strong desire not to disrupt the business, many small compa-
nies often set an arbitrary due date without allowing adequate time for ﬁne-
tuning, which may take days or weeks.
Challenge #9: Shortchanging training and technical support.
“It is critical for
management to budget for thorough user training, especially in small com-
panies without internal IS resources,” Taylor emphasizes. Whether training
is classroom-based or hands-on, on-site or off-site, the important thing is
not to shortchange this very important process.
“Adequate training in the use and maintenance of the new system will
pay dividends in the maximum utilization of its features and functionality,
and offer a high level of comfort and conﬁdence for users,” Taylor assures. It
is also helpful to have the technology partner be present for the switchover
from the old system to the new, and to return for a few days later to ensure
516
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

that the system is working as expected and to assist users who are perform-
ing periodic tasks for the ﬁrst time. 
“These are major steps that demand extra support,” Taylor insists. “De-
mand it.”

Advanced planning and scheduling (APS) is the current “hot” technology in
enterprise software. Inventory managers are taking a close look at it because
it includes the full spectrum of enterprise and interenterprise planning and
scheduling functions. John Bermudez, group director of supply chain man-
agement at AMR Research, Inc. (Boston; www.amrresearch.com), main-
tains, “APS allows the development of new supply chain processes, reducing
cost and inventory while improving customer service.”
What is APS, really?
According to Bermudez, “APS utilizes new planning
and scheduling techniques that consider a wide range of constraints to pro-
duce an optimized plan that makes the best use of available material and plant
capacity.” This enables the business to meet such objectives as minimizing
total cost (often from inventory and setup reductions) and maximizing over-
all plant operations, he says.
Sara Gillam, CEO of Intuitive Manufacturing Systems (Kirkland,
Wash.; www.mrp9000.com) deﬁnes APS as a planning system that combines
MRP and capacity requirements planning (CRP) to offer available-to-
promise and capable-to-promise scheduling options. However, she and
other experts agree that many different deﬁnitions arise beyond that.
For example, Rami Batlevy, manager of systems and processes for Ray-
theon Systems Company (El-Segundo, Calif.), agrees: “APS is a pretty loose
term that covers a lot of applications.” He listed some of them at a recent
APICS Annual International Conference:
• Long-term strategic planning and supply chain network design. This in-
cludes decisions about how many plants or distribution centers there should
be, which market they should serve or what products should be made to re-
solve conﬂicting objectives like customer service, cash ﬂow, and revenue
margins.
Technology/Computers/Software

• Demand planning and forecasting. This tool can be used to collaborate,
coordinate, and communicate a coherent and repeatedly updated sales fore-
cast, including the impact of promotional events, and to consider the enter-
prise constraints. This can be done intracompany (marketing and produc-
tion) or intercompany as a collaborative effort of the supply chain.
• Resource utilization. APS optimizes the use of on-hand materials and
constrained capacity, overriding MRP to obtain optimal results. Objectives
may be minimum deviation from the schedule, maximum customer service,
maximum work on the ﬂoor, increased short-term deliveries, minimum in-
ventory, improved cash ﬂow, or a balanced mix of several of these objectives.
Know what you’re getting when selecting an APS.
“When selecting an APS
system,” Gillam warns, “it is important to know each vendor’s deﬁnition of
exactly what their APS does, as the label of ‘APS’ is simply no guarantee of
certain functionality.” At National Manufacturing Week, she recommended
that the following questions be asked of each vendor:
• Does the system create an optimized plan based on orders entered?
• Can the system ﬁt new orders into the existing plan? Is this the only
way it can be done?
• Is the APS a linear, mixed integer linear, or heuristic model?
• Are Gantt charts provided? Are they interactive?
• Most importantly: What is required to implement the system? Is it a
“conﬁgure it yourself” or a standard out-of-the-box implementa-
tion?
Is APS for the smaller manufacturer?
APS can be an outstanding tool, but it
comes with a very high price tag. Bermudez notes, “While many manufac-
turers are interested in APS, the too-good-to-be-true claims and high prod-
uct costs have caused most companies to proceed cautiously.” 
“Many APS vendors sell their product for hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars as an entrance price, and implementation costs are even more,” main-
tains Gillam. “Smaller manufacturers need to be aware of these costs, and of
what it will take to achieve the beneﬁts that APS can bring.”
However, she does insist that APS “does have a place in smaller manu-
facturing companies”; however, they should not consider the “big” APS
systems. Just as ERP has been compressed into the smaller market, so has
APS.
518
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Gillam advises those in small to midsize manufacturing organizations to
consider the following points before moving into APS:
• Do not make APS your primary software consideration. “Look internally
at your business and determine if you realistically have the data in place to-
day to make APS worthwhile,” she offers. Most small and midrange manu-
facturers do not, she insists.
To gain the beneﬁt of APS, “you need to have good enough data to take
advantage of this very powerful tool,” Gillam explains. Your routing times
and costs need to be accurate. You cannot get a plan to the second if your
routing times are in hours or minutes.
• Is an APS plan truly your biggest and most immediate problem? For the
smaller manufacturers, most often it is not, she asserts. “The biggest prob-
lems are customer service, inventory management, and the like,” Gillam
notes. Although APS can help these areas, it is not a cure-all.
“The overall ERP backbone with which you work is more important
than the APS piece at this point,” she explains. “It is easy to get caught up in
the APS mania and select your ERP system solely on the ﬂashy APS demo.
You need to remember that APS is only a piece of the whole ERP system.”
• Use your existing ERP vendor to supply you with APS functionality. Keep
in mind that ERP vendors geared to the smaller manufacturers know the
needs of the smaller manufacturer. “They are experts at providing the
smaller manufacturer with solutions that meet their needs at a price that they
can afford,” Gillam explains. But there are risks and rewards to this approach. 
When an APS package is bundled in with an ERP package, you receive
a few beneﬁts that you would not get if you purchased a stand-alone APS
system. Among them are
• Complete integration between your ERP and your APS system
• One single implementation that includes both ERP and APS
• Much more streamlined implementation that will take less time and
money
The streamlined approach is possible because some ERP companies
have taken a new approach to implementation of APS systems (and, for that
matter, ERP systems), she notes. Rather than building the entire system to
meet your speciﬁc needs, you have a system in a box.
“To conﬁgure this system to exactly meet your requirements,” she ex-
plains, “you simply set parameters in a ﬂag setting.” For example, instead of
identifying and conﬁguring the APS system to meet the speciﬁc constraints
Technology/Computers/Software
519

for your company, the planning system would come with the standard con-
straints (lowest cost, least inventory carrying cost, on-time deliveries), and
you simply number them in your highest priority. This allows you to cus-
tomize the system to ﬁt your parameters easily without building the system
from a template to ﬁt your company’s requirements.

To improve their competitiveness and meet the market demand for sustained
growth, Philips Semiconductors reengineered its procedures for forecasting
demand, accepting work orders from customers, making commitments for
orders, and completing product deliveries. “Our delivery performance was
of particular concern,” says Cherie Malmstrom, logistics project manager at
Philips Semiconductors (Albuquerque, N.M.). “We wanted signiﬁcant im-
provement, and we sought it through a next-generation advanced planning
and scheduling system that would help boost customer service, shrink in-
ventory, and reduce cycle times for planning.”
According to Malmstrom, “Our systems were static and cycle-driven.
They were not ﬁnite scheduling systems in any way.” Philips deployed an
APS system (Paragon Management Systems; Los Angeles; www.paragonms.
com) at its North American facilities and improved delivery performance
from 50% to over 97%. It also made major reductions in inventory while im-
proving overall cycle time 10%.
A bevy of beneﬁts from the APS installation.
Malmstrom described the APS
improvements at a recent APICS Annual International Conference. Among
them were the following:
• Delivery performance, before and after. Before deploying Paragon appli-
cations, Philips’s shipping dates were based on historical ﬁxed lead times,
“which did not take into account the product mix, WIP, and dynamic bot-
tlenecks,” says Malmstrom. “The MES drove lots and schedules based on tar-
get average cycle-times but had no visibility on the actual customer-driven
due dates attached to these orders.”
As a result, lots with later due dates took priority over lots with earlier
due dates. The new software changed this by driving the plant to move lots
based on real customer order due dates, while simultaneously driving each
lot to meet target cycle times by respecting resource constraints.
520
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

• Relieving bottlenecks. “Before implementing the new system, WIP
was generated from a predefined number of starts per day,” she describes.
The number of starts was based on capacity availability of certain bottle-
neck resources but was not dynamic. Instead, this number was a static
value that was revised periodically. “As more WIP accumulated, the lead
times increased, causing more late orders,” Malmstrom notes. Philips and
Paragon knew that predefining bottlenecks in fabrication lines was not an
effective approach because bottlenecks shift based on product mix and
availability of equipment. This is an inherent characteristic of process-
oriented industries.
Now, Paragon recommended the “smart release” of lots into fabrication
lines. This means starting the lots at a point of time to minimize the wait time
of lots and use the bottlenecks as much as possible, without compromising
due dates.
• Reliable commitments. Work orders from customers are made several
times a day with a requested due date. Philips then checks the requested
quantity against reserved capacity based on monthly contracts. Finally, they
determine a shipping date based on material and capacity availability. 
By dynamically assigning manufacturing lots to orders based on due dates
and management objectives, the planning engine drives the plant to move lots
in order to keep promised shipping dates. By integrating intelligent planning
and visibility into the order-to-manufacturing-lot connections, the planning
engine allows Philips to control performance at the lot-customer level, rather
than at the more generic total-moves or throughput levels.
• Streamlined manufacturing. At Philips, two fabrication areas feed prod-
ucts into a common test area. Work orders come in from internal customers,
and forecasts are received from each product group as unconstrained de-
mand on a monthly basis. Work orders are routed back with an accurate date
for delivery of the product.
The Paragon software addresses two aspects of this requirement.
Through intelligent planning it optimizes the release and schedule of com-
peting lots on key bottleneck resources. Then, because of the integration
with reports and MES, it is able to update commit dates and manufacturing
lot due dates based on a capacity-constrained model. 
Necessary steps to successful implementation.
The Paragon software, according
to Malmstrom, “serves as the ‘planning engine’ for the production process.
It receives data (routings, resources, and customer orders) and produces a
recommended wafer start schedule.” 
Technology/Computers/Software
521

The software also serves as the engine behind reporting and analytical
tools used by planners to verify data integrity and make planning decisions.
Malmstrom also identiﬁed the following as primary to the implementation:
• Understanding the manufacturing process and business requirements. “This
includes a detailed walk-through and in-depth discussions with the indus-
trial engineers to identify the modeling requirements and to understand how
business restraints impact these requirements,” she describes.
• Integration and data veriﬁcation. Once a working model of the manu-
facturing process is complete, the data need to be “seamlessly” pulled from
a variety of sources, ranging from the MES to spreadsheets that are manu-
ally maintained. “This process is nontrivial because it involves cleansing the
data and verifying the integrity to match Paragon’s software data model
structure and the operational requirements of the plant,” she details.
• Starting output, commitments, and model testing. Once the data are
cleaned and the integration process runs smoothly, the plant uses the soft-
ware to drive two primary business functions as a way of verifying the soft-
ware’s accuracy and functionality. Output of the software is used to deter-
mine the number of daily wafer starts to load into the fabrication line and
the commit date for customer orders based on capacity and inventory avail-
ability. “Based on these two primary outputs, we worked with Paragon to
assess the accuracy of the software,” Malmstrom explains. “Once a comfort
level was reached, we used the software to drive business processes, which
resulted in signiﬁcant performance improvements.”
• Reporting and business process. The planning and scheduling engine, by
itself, serves as a tool. End-users required interfaces and reports to enhance
and supplement their business process. “We used our resources to make the
information and decision support provided by Paragon software visible, us-
able, and interactive for speciﬁc metrics and business analysis by the end-
users,” she describes.
In evaluating the implementation, Malmstrom describes the success fac-
tors as
• Cross-functional involvement and support from the planning and
manufacturing groups
• Change of performance metrics from volume-driven goals to cus-
tomer request and commit dates
• Union of generated plans to a viable and visible execution plan
522
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Future improvement to include reactive dynamic sequencing.
Philips is currently
evaluating the next phase of implementation. One of the steps includes
adding Paragon’s reactive dynamic sequencing module to the test area. The
module provides detailed, shop-ﬂoor-level sequencing of lots based on
complex sorting business rules. 
“The expected beneﬁts from this are recommendations on the precise
order of lots in queue on particular machines based on metrics such as crit-
ical ratio, slack time, due date, and WIP-buffer levels,” Malmstrom de-
scribes. “We plan to use this to schedule optimal preventive maintenance and
achieve higher utilization and lower cycle-times because of the added local
optimization at each resource.” 
The next step for Philips is to directly tie the corporation’s global order
entry to the demand that the plant receives. “This will allow the customer
to place an order with a sales group and receive, in real-time, a reasonable

A certain amount of inventory is an essential ingredient of a successful supply
chain management practice. For example, in a distribution-intensive enter-
prise inventory can be an efﬁcient buffer for managing the complexity of its
supply chain, improving customer service and operating efﬁciency.
Managers seek the inventory management system that ensures that their
organizations receive the most value from their investment in raw material,
WIP, and ﬁnished goods inventories. Yet the rhetoric from inventory man-
agement system providers clouds rather than clariﬁes these issues for many
inventory managers. 
New research report provides some of the answers about inventory management
systems.
Greg Girard, senior analyst of supply chain management at
AMR Research (Boston; ggirard@amrresearch.com) has come to the aid
of inventory managers. He authored a comprehensive report on the crit-
ical functionalities of inventory management systems. Though focused on
applications for distribution-intensive enterprises, his analysis neverthe-
less contains many insights that will be useful for inventory managers. In
our opinion, his report is a resource that should be reviewed and studied
Technology/Computers/Software

before taking on the process of selecting an inventory management sys-
tem.
The key functionalities for evaluating inventory management applications.
“Be-
cause of their complexity and breadth, it’s easy to get bogged down in the
process of deﬁning software requirements and selecting vendors for inven-
tory management systems,” Girard concedes. His research, however, shows
how distribution companies, for one, can derive beneﬁt from these systems
with a relatively short list of core functionalities that can be considered when
evaluating alternatives. Key ﬁndings concerning a shortlist of enterprise ap-
plications identiﬁed by Girard appear in Table II-4.1.
He notes in his report that some supply chain planning vendors
(Manugistics and Logility) offer inventory management systems “within a
broader framework of supply chain capabilities.” Also, some supply chain
execution vendors (Endura) are bringing “robust inventory management
systems to market.”
Parameters that inventory management systems must satisfy. According to Girard,
“The value of inventory management systems increases with the ability to
apply statistical, economic, and trading partner business rules at the level of
item location.” To achieve this type of increase, he recommends that inven-
tory managers seek software solutions that can do the following:
• Scale the application of scientiﬁc inventory management techniques
(statistical safety stock, economic order quantity) to review fairly high vol-
umes of granular item-location replenishment and redeployment decisions
in short (daily or weekly) cycles.
• Automate routine replenishment and redeployment decisions.
• Comprehend the full costs of acquiring, carrying, (re-)deploying, and
disposing of inventory.
• Manage inventory by safety, cycle, build, and investment classes for
each item location in the network.
• Manage inventory allocation decisions based on economic value of
inventory reﬂecting gross margins and turns.
• Map inventory policy by item location to channels and customers
with common service expectations.
• Adjust parameters that control item location replenishment and de-
ployment decisions quickly by the following:
524
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

• Shortening the item-location control review cycle
• Identifying signiﬁcant seasonal, promotional, and life-cycle changes
in demand to adjust forecast in the next review cycle
• Identifying variances in supply lead times and ﬁll rates to adjust safety
stock in the next review cycle
• Identify potential inventory excesses and shortages at item locations
and redeployment network inventory to minimize revenue lost from stock-
outs and product obsolescence, considering transportation and the handling
cost of redeployment and product substitution opportunities.
• Manage replenishment decisions to get the most out of the follow-
ing:
• Suppliers’ trade promotion programs and forward-buying opportu-
nities
• Lot size economies of suppliers, manufacturing, transportation, and
warehousing
• Manage item-location inventory through product life cycles, adjust-
ing replenishment and redeployment control parameters from new product
introduction, through maturity, and into obsolescence.
• Manage product-to-product substitution and product reuse oppor-
tunities.
• Manage aging inventory against shelf-life constraints.

Inventory managers, warehouse managers, and supply chain professionals
could not help but be impressed with the array of software solutions on dis-
play at Distribution/Computer Expo. Niche players, single-source pro-
viders, and best-of-breed vendors came in full force to present their new re-
leases, advanced technology, and expanded product lines.
It’s not just inventory management software anymore.
To be sure, products are
extending beyond exclusive focus on inventory management. While some
pitch inventory management as the heart of their WMSs, others posit
WMS as an integral piece of the broader supply chain management tech-
nology.
The marketplace still carries a caveat emptor warning.
The solutions are becom-
ing more integrated and the packages more complex. Yet the vendors’ mes-
sages still emphasize user friendliness, fast implementation, and customer
service. So when it comes down to distilling the claims of the new features
and beneﬁts provided by the software releases, several attendees cautioned
readers not to be swayed by the technology. Instead, focus primarily on the
solution that will get rid of your problems.
Our list of show-stopper technologies.
More than 200 exhibitors displayed
their products at Distribution/Computer Expo (produced by C. S. Report,
Inc.; Uwchland, Pa.; 610-458-6410). Among those of interest to our read-
ers, we found the following 12 to warrant further consideration:

Purchasing/Supplier Issues/
Vendor Managed Inventory
VMI TCSI
RBPT
Vendor managed inventory (VMI) is becoming a best practice. Considering
the drive to integrate supply chains and remove inventory from within them,
and inventory managers’ own desire to reduce on-hand inventory, VMI is a
concept that deﬁnitely merits consideration.
The trend toward VMI.
J. Paul Dittman, vice president of global logistics
at Whirlpool Corporation (St. Joseph, Mich.; john_p_dittman@email.
whirlpool.com) is one industry leader who concurs with this assessment. At
the Proven Performance Metrics in Logistics Conference (Institute for In-
ternational Research, New York), he conﬁrmed the existence of a mega-
trend of inventory being pushed backward in the channel. “Just like you’re
pushing your inventory back on your supplier through concepts such as ven-
dor managed inventory, if you don’t own your dealer’s inventory today, you
will. Be prepared for it,” Dittman warns.
Inventory reduction beneﬁts are real.
Although there is some debate about the
“real” beneﬁts of VMI, James G. Hutzel, CPIM, who leads the production
inventory control, demand management, and master planning functions at
Werthan Packaging, Inc. (Nashville, Tenn.), is an advocate. “The beneﬁts of
a well-functioning VMI process include reduced lead times and ﬁnished
539

goods inventory in the supply chain,” he explained at an Annual American
Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) International Confer-
ence. “This is facilitated through the tighter control of, and quicker response
to, changes in demand for these items.”
He also estimates savings of up to 20%. In the case of Werthan, “this per-
centage will result in a savings of $1 million of on-hand inventory for our
company,” Hutzel maintains. 
But does it “cement” the customer to the supplier?
Mark K. Williams, CFPIM,
consulting manager at North Highland Company (Atlanta, Ga.) believes
that it does. “Once a VMI system is established, a customer has effectively
outsourced its material management function to its supplier,” he told his
APICS audience. “After a period of time, the customer will no longer have
the resources to perform this role in-house, making him more dependent
upon the supplier. Nothing short of a major breach in a supplier’s perfor-
mance will prompt the customer to search for a new supplier,” he con-
cludes.
However, Drew T. Curtis, CPIM, CPM, strategic programs manager at
TTI, Inc. (Tewksbury, Mass.; 978-851-2000), believes that “a true partner-
ship where both the customer and supplier work in harmony toward a com-
mon inventory management goal can accomplish a great deal and reap sub-
stantial rewards for both companies.” He argues that customers can reduce
their supplier base and decrease their inventory liability while increasing
production ﬂexibility. Suppliers beneﬁt by solidifying their customer base,
which results in better material support and increased communication with
customers.
Supplier selection critical to establishing VMI process.
“There are two key com-
ponents that are unique to supplier-managed inventory programs that need
to be addressed during the evaluation and supplier selection process,” ex-
plains Curtis. They are inventory management and order release.
“A supplier’s inventory management process and capabilities, as they re-
late to supplier-managed programs, are often overlooked and/or misunder-
stood by many customers.” Nevertheless, he declares that it is probably the
most inﬂuential factor in the success or failure of this type of program.
It is not uncommon for customers to remark to the supplier, “I don’t
care what mechanism you use to accomplish the bonded quantity we need;
that’s your business.” Wrong approach, he insists. “As a former procurement
540
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

manager and a current value-added program supplier, I vehemently assert
that you should care. It’s imperative that you qualify the inventory manage-
ment process as thoroughly as you would any other process,” Curtis empha-
sized at the APICS conference.
What to look for in a supplier’s inventory management process.
Speciﬁcally, Cur-
tis advises determining what planning process the supplier will use to estab-
lish a “bond” quantity and assure that it will be in stock when needed. Will
this process be automated based on an electronic transmission of the cus-
tomer’s material requirements planning forecast, or will the planning for
reservation be done manually by the supplier’s personnel?
“Manual planning is a common occurrence, and it is nothing more than
transference of workload from customer to supplier,” he observes. Manual
planning may be acceptable when dealing with a small number of line items,
but it is prohibitive when dealing with higher line counts.
Always ask the following questions, Curtis advises:
• What will you do with the electronic transmission of my manufac-
turing resource planning (MRP)?
• Will you upload it automatically into your planning system, or will
you print it out for someone to analyze?
“If it is uploaded automatically, have the supplier give you a live demon-
stration to qualify their capability,” he strongly recommends. Automatic in-
tegration of the material forecast is the preferred method to ensure timeli-
ness of material reservation and elimination of data entry errors.
Take a look at the order entry process, too.
According to Curtis, it is just as im-
portant to tell the supplier what to ship and when. Most of the release mech-
anisms or “triggers” from customers to suppliers to ship product are similar.
The ﬁve most common methods are
• Electronic data interchange (EDI) 850 purchase order
• Fax purchase order
• Scanning of a bar code
• EDI 830 with embedded purchase order
• Supplier-determined release
Purchasing/Supplier Issues/Vendor Managed Inventory
541

“The releases for this program should be for current shipments only and
should not contain future orders,” he advises. 
Don’t overlook internal organizational issues before dealing with the customer.
Ac-
cording to Hutzel, when on the other side of the aisle, and when VMI ini-
tiatives are initiated, it is important to
• Dedicate personnel to the project and to support on an ongoing basis. “At
Werthan, we have combined the traditional customer service representative
position, the master production scheduler, material requirements planner, and
shop ﬂoor scheduling functions into one position,” he details. This position is
dedicated to performing all aspects of planning product for our customer. It
also minimizes the number of communication links internally within the or-
ganization, and improves communications with both suppliers and customers.
• Educate all of those involved in VMI. “We focused a lot of the initial ed-
ucation with the sales force at the beginning of our project since they were
the ones on the front line,” notes Hutzel. “They did a lot of the preliminary
evaluation to see if a particular customer ﬁt our criteria for VMI and to de-
termine if that customer was interested in participating in the VMI process.”
• Provide the proper justiﬁcation for top management so that you get the required
commitment. “You must convince top management that ‘bottom line’ VMI
is a good business decision,” he declares. This means pointing out that VMI
will help to reduce lead times and inventory and that it is cost effective. “Tell
them it is a priority for us as well as our customers, and it makes us indis-
pensable to those customers who partner with us in VMI,” Hutzel details.
• Realign customer and supplier organizations and contacts to enhance commu-
nication and minimize the links of communication. The primary communication
between companies moves to a direct link with master scheduler communi-
cating to master scheduler/material requirements planner—no more sales
person to the customer’s purchasing agent. “In our case,” Hutzel explains,
“our primary VMI person is a customer demand management representa-
tive.” This person has experience in demand management, forecasting, mas-
ter production scheduling, capacity planning, JIT practices, shop ﬂoor
scheduling, and production and inventory control.
As the experts agree, VMI is the process that will result in less inventory
for both the customer and the supplier, and many companies will be con-
sidering VMI from the perspective of both a supplier and a customer.

VMI holds much promise as an effective inventory reduction tool. Foremost
among its strengths, VMI grants trading partners, and eventually the entire
supply chain, an opportunity to establish more open communications. At
the most basic level, this means the sharing of forecasts and scheduling in-
formation, and possibly automating some routine, transactional functions. In
the ultimate, it is a full-blown collaboration initiative involving joint plan-
ning and development activities among all the parties.
The operations vice president at a large metal-forming facility provides
an example. “We’re in the process of improving the linkage of our suppliers
with our internal systems, processes, and information. We’re going all out to
apply the principle of substituting information for inventory.”
VMI interest is high, but actual applications remain in the planning stages.
Ac-
cording to a recent Inventory Reduction Report reader survey, one in ﬁve re-
spondents says that they are “adopting” VMI strategies. Earlier survey re-
sponses to the question were less than 10%.
In reviewing responses to the survey, we are encouraged by the grow-
ing numbers of readers who have at least one VMI partnership. For instance,
a director of procurement at a utility company says, “Our most effective in-
ventory reduction method appears to be VMI, especially for fast-moving
items and their availability.”
In another case, a major electronics company is actively working with
its customers to establish VMI partnerships. The manager of business plan-
ning explains, “We’re trying to get to critical mass and to get our primary
customers interested in joining with us. We know we can reduce their in-
ventory signiﬁcantly based on the initiatives we already have in place. Ulti-
mately, we’ll also be reducing our own inventories, and that of our suppliers
as well,” he responds. 
Without a doubt, there’s a lot of optimism in the responses we received. As an ex-
ample, a ﬁnance vice president at a small assembler of navigational equip-
ment reports that “efforts are being concentrated on getting our key suppli-
ers on board with the concept and its implementation.”
Similarly, an inventory analyst at an ofﬁce supply distributor says, “We’re
in continuing negotiation with suppliers about VMI inventories. In our ﬁrst
Purchasing/Supplier Issues/Vendor Managed Inventory
543

year we reduced inventory by $50,000, and we expect to double that in our
second year. Now we’re entering discussions with our customers, surveying
their interest in our setting up a VMI stocking program for them. We tell
them we will be able to reduce their lead times and order quantities to match
their customers’ demands.”
VMI focuses on MRO items, for now.
“Our ﬁrst VMI initiative with a key
MRO supplier has enabled us to increase fastener turns over 225%,” reports
a materials manager at a midsize facility manufacturing reduction equip-
ment. “We’re in the process of studying how to optimize supply chain tech-
nology to maximize VMI initiatives. Part of the plan is to integrate logistics
within the supply chain to achieve partnerships in our total business process.” 
VMI implementation rolled out to seven warehouses.
An inventory manage-
ment manager at a large utility established a VMI program for janitorial and
consumable inventories. “We rolled them out, one at a time, over seven
warehouses, after holding extensive brieﬁngs with the union representatives,
our own accounting people, and the director of materials management,” he
reports. To date, they have removed $500,000 from their average inventory
investment. The manager also reports ancillary beneﬁts from eliminating
handling and monitoring activities by warehouse workers and a reduction of
invoice processing to only once a month.
Suppliers have latitude with VMI process.
“We moved into VMI partnerships
with our primary suppliers, those who provide us with our ‘A’ stock and
components,” mentions an inventory control manager at a small producer of
air ﬁltration equipment. “The suppliers are provided with min/max levels,
and they can ship anytime within this window,” he explains. “This results in
the fastest throughput of our ‘A’ items, and no POs [purchase orders] are
ever issued for these items,” he adds.
Storerooms eliminated with VMI practice.
The director of purchasing at a mid-
size maker of thread is currently “working with two suppliers on a VMI sys-
tem. We began by establishing a pilot program to demonstrate the effective-
ness of the practice and technology. From this pilot alone we have been able
to do away with the storerooms,” he explains. 
The director tells of another VMI project in which a supplier will pur-
chase and install the hardware that will automatically “read” the liquid level in
a series of tanks. “This will enable the supplier to monitor and automatically
544
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

reﬁll the tanks for us at the appropriate time. For us, it eliminates the need for
manpower and paperwork associated with controlling this inventory.” 
Information sharing helps to slice lead times.
“We’re sharing more information
of our anticipated and forecasted needs with suppliers and also have in-
creased the amount of preseason planning information we provide them,”
explains a manager in a midsize apparel company. “By so doing, and exper-
imenting with VMI concepts, we’ve been able to reduce our lead times and
overall commitment within the pipeline,” she offers. “We have also in-
creased use of uncommitted reserves at the suppliers.”
Adopting VMI and melding it with bonded inventory a success.
The director of
quality and operations at a small producer of telecommunications test equip-
ment announces that the organization already has implemented a program
to unite VMI and bonded inventory.
“We’ve been able to reduce on-site inventory levels signiﬁcantly, while
also increasing the turnover ratio dramatically,” he explains. “Furthermore,
we’ve been able to just about eliminate any vestiges of obsolete and excess
inventory, which is extremely costly in our industry.” 
Information sharing reduces total cycle time.
A third party logistics provider re-
veals that VMI partnerships have enabled him not only to increase inventory
accuracy but also to reduce the total cycle time of moving products to the cus-
tomer. “We ﬁnd much value in partnerships where we and the customer share
information with each other,” the general manager offers. “We’re currently in-
vestigating how we can apply gain-sharing beneﬁts to these relationships.”
Local warehouse ﬁnds additional business to pay for VMI initiatives.
In an inter-
esting development, an inventory manager at a major producer of medical
instrument assemblies tells of a supplier with whom they entered into a VMI
relationship. The supplier decided to locate a warehouse near the manufac-
turing facility, believing that it would more effectively handle the VMI de-
mands. In reality, the supplier found that they were servicing their entire re-
gional market from this warehouse, enabling them to extend VMI services
to other customers. “In a few months, they were able to recover the costs of
the new facility and VMI technology,” he reports.
VMI initiative helps slash 75% off raw materials inventory.
A materials manager
at a midsize builder of telecommunications systems has entered a “supplier

managed inventory program where the supplier stocks inventory and we
only keep ﬁve days worth in our plant.” He explains, “This is a signiﬁcant
reduction of inventory we normally kept on hand, and it also cuts in half our
need for outsourced ﬁnished goods.”
Seeking additional VMI relationships for the future.
A cost and inventory con-
trol manager at a midsize maker of furniture plans to “further extend our
VMI relationships and increase the number of partnerships with our suppli-
ers. We’ll be doing a lot more sharing of forecast and production plans with
them,” she insists.
However, another reader, the director of logistics at a large supplier of
ofﬁce products, cites an interest in pursuing VMI in the near term but ad-
mits, “We need to learn to walk before we’re ready to run. We’ll start by re-
vamping our supply chain practices, and then look to VMI,” she declares.

Tekelec has implemented a VMI program that is integrated into its manu-
facturing process. We have created a fully integrated, closed-loop, transac-
tionally error-free, and highly auditable process that stretches from customer
shipment to inventory replenishment.
Within only eight months we were able to identify, adapt, program, and
test this system. Fully operational now, we have been running increasing
production levels through the system for ﬁve months and have achieved the
following:
• Inventory turns for the division have increased an average 40.6% from
the preceding year to a current high of 7.9%.
• Inventory levels for the division have been reduced by 30%, and on-
time shipments are up 1% to over 98% .
• Months supply of inventory based on forecast are down 30% from
what they were in January 1997, and we have not had a single stockout. Our
months supply of inventory is 1.5 months, with reported telecom industry
mean of 3.1 and a best in class at 1.7.

I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Identifying project objectives that VMI had to meet.
We began by selecting our
switching division production line for our ﬁrst VMI program. Our decision
was based on the bill of material (BOM) structure of the products, their
growth rate as it relates to the company, and the capabilities of the contract
manufacturer used for the division.
The primary objective was to reduce the cycle time required for re-
plenishing the manufacturing cell inventories (which it has done by 40% to
date) and to better support the pull manufacturing method. We only “pull”
product through the system to replenish shipped product, and we do not
“push” work orders based on MRP outputs.
Our second objective was not to add any liabilities typically associated
with increased inventories (delayed implementation of engineering change
orders, increased scrap risks, increased carrying charges). Last, we wanted to
maintain maximum ﬂexibility by not committing material early in the pro-
cess to ﬁnished goods.
Developing the VMI strategy.
We identiﬁed the core competencies of all par-
ties to be involved in our replenishment process. Once we agreed with the
role that each organization would play, we began to select suppliers. Two of
the component suppliers were already working with another telecommuni-
cations company in a VMI project. They also had a basic understanding of
where we wanted to take Tekelec.
An additional advantage was that the two component suppliers and the
contract manufacturer shared our vision of the potential gains that could be
achieved if we were to work as a dedicated team.
Putting the team to work.
We began by reviewing the existing replenishment
process for redundancy, inefﬁciencies, and monetary risks. Major areas re-
quiring attention included multiple repeat purchase order, excessive han-
dling, and large inventory balances.
The Tekelec process for producing printed circuit boards at a contract
manufacturer was typical of others in the industry. However, we differed in
that we used a two-bin system to replenish our raw materials inventories. Al-
though we achieved a two-week cycle time, which was close to best in class,
we were not comfortable with the level of waste and redundancy in the pro-
cess.
The team identiﬁed several companies (and here the suppliers were es-
pecially helpful) that were considered to be leaders in efﬁcient material man-
agement. We visited their facilities so that the team could see ﬁrsthand what
others were doing in materials management.

Designing the VMI system.
The basic ﬂow of the new Innovative Material
Pull Assembly Concept Team (IMPACT) process has three key differences
from our original process:
• The material is owned by the distributors until it is delivered as an as-
sembly.
• All transactions typically associated with ordering, receiving, issuing,
and paying for materials are highly automated.
• The process has an extremely short cycle time (6 to 8 days) while
maintaining ﬂexibility.
In addition to reducing cycle time by approximately 40% and reducing
component handling by 25%, the new VMI process limits our material lia-
bility to only those components used to assemble products received from
our contract manufacturer. The component distributors maintain ownership
of all material warehoused at the contract manufacturer.
Testing the VMI System.
The required programming was given to the team
for testing in the fourth quarter. After testing the entire process in a dupli-
cate test database supplied by our information systems (IS) department, the
programming changes were loaded into the Tekelec database.
The team began pilot testing the following January. The approximately
two-month pilot process included a ﬁnal phase at complexity levels that
stressed the system beyond any that we would typically see during actual
production.
Adapting the system for installation.
The Tekelec main information system
presented some unique challenges. First, the system was not capable of han-
dling EDI transmissions, which is a key requirement of VMI. This was re-
solved by purchasing an EDI package and integrating it into our system.
Some of the additional programming (done by our own IS department) in-
cluded adding data ﬁelds to the stock ﬁles, modifying the purchasing mod-
ule, rewriting the receiving module, and modifying numerous reports.
All but one transaction in this new process are either electronically gen-
erated or entered as bar code to eliminate any risk of input error. Issuing
“push” items to work order is the one transaction that is not fully automated.
We continue to maintain full control over push items such as custom ICs
or bare PCBs. This transaction remains as in the original process and is eas-
ily audited.

I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Reviewing the new system’s operational controls.
To ensure that there is adher-
ence to established controls, the team signs off the impact checklist monthly.
This validates that they have reviewed their areas of responsibility and that
no unusual issues have occurred during the month. Among the operational
controls introduced are
• Back-ﬂush. Extensive controls were put in place at the receiving dock
to ensure that transaction errors cannot be created here.
• Material and labor costs. All costs are reviewed and, if necessary, nego-
tiated each month. Upon approval by all parties, they are signed off and in-
put for use in the coming ﬁscal month. Because we pay for product as we
consume it, inventory valuation for ﬁnished assemblies runs closer to actual
market value.
• Data accuracy. To ensure that the back-ﬂush process operates correctly,
all pertinent data points in the stock ﬁle must be complete, accurate, and not
in conﬂict. An automatic audit process was developed to monitor these data
during any input or update to these ﬁles. Conﬂicting entries are prohibited,
and changes to the database automatically generate e-mails to both ac-
counting and purchasing. Our suppliers, having conﬁdence with our sys-
tem’s accuracy and control, allow Tekelec to generate the invoices at the
time the material is received.

Many inventory managers are exploring VMI, but few have gone the next
step by combining it with supplier scheduling and enterprise resource plan-
ning (ERP). Werthan Packaging, Inc. (Nashville, Tenn.), has.
Transformation begins with VMI.
“Requests by certain key customers iden-
tiﬁed VMI as a high priority,” asserts James G. Hutzel, CPIM, director of
production and inventory control. Werthan started VMI with their second
largest customer because it had been the most interested in the process.
“This created the need for realignment of customer service, master planning,
and production and inventory control functions,” he reported in a presen-
tation coauthored with Donald P. Belmont, president and COO, and
Mark K. Nichols, who assists in the VMI, ERP, and agile manufacturing
implementation.
Purchasing/Supplier Issues/Vendor Managed Inventory

Werthan hired a demand planner at the outset. The new ERP system
also played an indispensable role within the VMI project by providing pre-
viously unavailable information about demand patterns. “Not even our cus-
tomer had this type of information,” Hutzel declared at a recent Annual
APICS International Conference.
Providing products on a predictable basis.
Werthan created master production
schedules to replenish products on a timelier basis, and customer service
jumped to new levels. “This allowed us to exchange information for inven-
tory,” he explains. “We dedicated a lot of effort to fully analyzing and un-
derstanding our customer demand patterns and calculating run rates and
safety stock levels for ﬁnished goods.”
The demand planner position is extremely important.
It is the primary link with
the customer on a daily basis, he notes. Also, it is the one position “most di-
rectly involved in predicting demand pattern changes and our subsequent
obligation to provide the product.”
With the demand planner working directly with the customer’s planner,
the accuracy and speed of information exchange improved signiﬁcantly.
“The planner soon became more than just a demand planner,” Hutzel notes.
They were soon performing master production scheduling activities, such as
maintaining and loading the planning BOMs, releasing master production
schedule (MPS) orders, releasing customer orders, capacity planning, and
VMI planning.
Later duties included sales and operations planning (S&OP) preparation,
leadership of the S&OP meeting, and leading the daily production control
meeting with master planning and production personnel. “We were broad-
ening this individual’s experience and skills with total exposure to our busi-
ness processes and regular, frequent interface with our customers,” Hutzel
maintains.
Look back into the chain and engage the suppliers.
“Once we had a stable, level-
loaded master production schedule and had cleaned up the shop orders and
other parts of our ERP database, we were able to move to a supplier sched-
uling process,” he explains. Working with the purchasing team, they moved
the MRP items (dependent demand items) for these customers to the de-
mand planner.
In effect, Werthan had vertically integrated four levels of the ERP ﬂow
into one position. “Supplier scheduling was critical to our success since lead
550
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

times for paper, our critical component for all bags, can be ﬁve to six weeks,”
he notes. The only effective way to reduce that lead time is through supplier
scheduling.
Reserve production time with the supplier.
“We have to get projected paper re-
quirements to our suppliers in order to get on their MPS so we do not have
to wait the entire ﬁve- to six-week lead time,” he explains. “We arranged to
buy capacity in their schedule and not part numbers until the demand time
fence was reached.”
A detailed project plan covering all key activities/tasks was the founda-
tion of the supplier scheduling project. They ascertained that fewer than 12
suppliers provided more than 80% of Werthan’s raw material. These became
the targets for supplier scheduling.
“We targeted the A items and the A suppliers,” Hutzel declared. “This
would give us the most beneﬁt for the amount of effort in implementation.”
One of the ﬁrst things they did was to bring in the suppliers for an educa-
tional session. “We wanted to bring them up to speed on what we were do-
ing and how this new process would affect them,” he explains.
Combine VMI with supplier scheduling and make it work.
The linking process
began by involving the master planner in the implementation of this new,
combined initiative. “This was natural since the master planner performed
all activities associated with the ‘top end’ of ERP with these customers,”
Hutzel describes. “One key to this project is we did not give the demand
planner all product lines and all customers. We gave him just A customers
(all items) and all dependent demand materials associated with those ﬁnished
goods-level items.”
They also allocated the MRO and expense items to one buyer so that
this demand planner was spending time on the “valuable” A and B material
and not on 1% items.
“We reorganized the previously horizontal alignment of duties with
several separate associates within the organization to be a vertical one with
one master planner covering all duties and responsibilities for several A cus-
tomers,” he details. “This planner is much more efﬁcient and handles all tasks
involved in supporting one or more customers through to the supply base.”
Werthan set up planner codes for each grouping of items by customer.
This allows the master planner to identify all items associated with a given
customer quickly and easily. “It also allows us to track inventory levels by
planner code and produce other critical reports effectively,” he states.
Purchasing/Supplier Issues/Vendor Managed Inventory
551

The master planner is the key link between customer and supplier.
The master
planner works the VMI process, determines demand rates, sets the planning
BOM, creates the MPS, and does MRP for shop and purchasing require-
ments and supplier scheduling.
“Normal ERP reporting processes are sped up dramatically, since there
is no one else to communicate with,” Hutzel explains. “Instead of relying to-
tally on an ERP system report, many tasks/activities are handled within the
scope of this one position. Follow-up tasks are internal within this function.”
The master planner’s primary contact is a planner position that is similar
in many ways to his or her position. The planner position at the customer’s
or supplier’s operation is deﬁned mostly by those organizations’ directives.
However, Hutzel maintains, “We have seen that the initiation of these new
processes has a positive effect on the level of performance for these external
supply chain planners and that the exchange of information is essential to
creating a well-functioning supply chain process.”

Thirty-three percent of the respondents to a Managing Logistics survey say
that they initiated VMI programs to control logistics costs. How much are
they actually saving? New data from the Distribution Research and Educa-
tion Foundation (DREF), the research arm of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors (NAW; Washington, D.C.; 202-872-0885), offers
advice on how to calculate the savings associated with VMI and determine
if it is right for you. 
One Distributor’s VMI Experience
NAW measured one distributor’s performance in its three branches (small,
medium, and large) before and after implementing VMI across three
parameters: inventory levels, out of stock position, and sales and purchas-
ing effort. 
Measurements began eight months into the VMI installment. At that
point, inventory levels had dropped (after an initial spike up), in-stock per-
centages had leveled out, and the initial purchasing effort required in the
transfer of responsibility for the day-to-day ordering had also decreased. To
552

further reﬁne the analysis, the study averaged the four weeks prior to VMI
and the last four weeks using VMI (see Table II-5.1).
Calculating the Benefits
In analyzing the cost beneﬁt of reduced inventory, subtract current inventory
from previous inventory levels. Then multiply this reduction in inventory by
a carrying cost factor. For the purpose of the NAW study, a carrying cost of
20% was used. The carrying cost includes all costs associated with inventory,
such as cost of money, cost of storage, insurance taxes, increased work effort
to move and work around extra inventory, and the like. The bottom-line
beneﬁt before taxes for each of the branches is shown in Table II-5.2.
Establishing the value of changing service levels can be more difﬁcult.

The primary beneﬁt of increasing service is believed to be increased sales,
but the NAW survey shows that sales increased with VMI, despite a decline
in in-stock percentage. Further, the distributor recognized that an increase
in in-stock percentage might have a far-reaching impact on sales by affect-
ing a customer’s perception of the service being received.
To calculate an increase in sales percentage, multiply the in-stock per-
centage by the lost sales percentage. Then multiply this increase in sales per-
centage by the average weekly sales prior to VMI. Finally, multiply this sales
increase by the yearly gross margin to arrive at an annual bottom-line im-
pact (see Table II-5.3).
In many ways, buyer productivity is the easiest beneﬁt to analyze. In the
case of the NAW distributor, the buying function carried responsibility for
resolving order-to-invoice errors as well as the actual act of placing purchase
orders. Much of the reduction in time came from invoices matching orders
on a more regular basis.
To put a dollar ﬁgure to this beneﬁt, establish the fully loaded cost of an
employee, including insurance, taxes, training, and salary. Then determine

think about how you implemented the VMI program in the ﬁrst place. One
of the greatest snags in the pre-VMI stage is misconception by CEOs, says

Thomas A. Kozak of Pan-Pro (Tinley Park, Ill.; 888-507-5400), a VMI ser-
vice provider. Too often, he says, executives see VMI as a tactical opportu-
nity that departmental people should execute. Everyone involved must view
it as a strategic priority.
Another big hurdle is getting all supply chain partners to see each other
as trust partners with whom they must share data, effort, and beneﬁts. “This
goes against 100 years of close-to-the-vest haggling,” says Kozak. “You
know that once you decide to go for a basic VMI relationship, you have to
stop all of the channel-loading bribing games that make both sides feel like
they have achieved a short-term victory. This winds up undermining the
longer-term, bigger beneﬁts of inventory ﬂow through the pipeline.”
Stephen Kemper, principal at Pittiglio Rabin Todd & McGrath (Moun-
tain View, Calif.; skemper@prtm.com), says that if VMI is to ﬂourish, the
following developments must occur among partners:
• Formal inventory management parameters and mechanisms for tracking ser-
vice performance. Without rules-based inventory models and target service
levels, the amount of inventory will rise to excessive levels.

• Mechanisms for exchanging information on levels of on-hand inventory, daily
consumption, and inventory in transit. For a VMI program to be effective, there
must be nearly real-time visibility of channel inventory levels and required
replenishment actions. Caution should be used when designing these infor-
mation exchange mechanisms to ensure that they are scalable across the var-
ious channel partners’ systems.
• Processes for consistently delivering products to channel partners within set lead
times. Without reliable and timely deliveries, uncertainties about product
availability will result in excessive inventory buffers.

One of the pressing challenges confronting purchasing is reducing cycle
time (see sidebar). However, of the respondents to the Supplier Selection and
Management Report Cost Control Survey who cite cycle time as a problem,
about one in four admits that he or she has not yet solved it. For them and
others who are wrestling with cycle time reduction challenges, this exclu-
sive article by noted authority Richard (Rick) Titone, president of The
Why How Consulting Company (Clifton, N.J.; 973-478-8965), provides
some guidelines and directions.
Procurement lead time is the critical component.
A rule that applies to any man-
ufactured product is that procurement lead time will always be longer than
the manufacturing lead time.

I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T
Where Purchasing Is Guilty of Stretching Cycle Times
Purchasing may “unwittingly foil cycle time reduction efforts,” according to
Richard (Rick) Titone, president of The Why How Consulting Company.
By reviewing its own processes, a company can detect several candidates that
will shorten cycle time requirements. Titone cites some examples of where
purchasing activities do contribute to longer cycle times:
•
How many times have you gone out for multiple quotes on a relatively
simple-to-purchase item? Then you waited around for a few weeks for all
those requests for quotes (RFQs) to come back, just to meet a corporate di-
rective for so many RFQs per dollar or number of buys?
•
Does sourcing an item offshore really make sense if the delivery lead
time and transportation cost increase so signiﬁcantly that it offsets the cheaper
price?
•
Have you ever arbitrarily increased the quantity on a requisition in or-
der to obtain a better price, or just to meet a price break point? It does take
longer to make 10,000 pieces than it does to make 1,000. Even though the
supplier saves some setup time, and you get a price break, the lead time may
have been longer.
•
Have you ever tightened up on specs or quality requirements in an ef-
fort to improve the quality of incoming materials? Doing so may require the
supplier to conduct additional tests or inspections, thereby increasing lead time.

This is the question purchasers must ask: “Are my supplier’s lead times
padded?” And if so, by how much? Supplier visits, comparisons to other sup-
pliers in the commodity ﬁeld, or a check with your own manufacturing en-
gineers will help verify the validity of a supplier’s lead time. Other indicators
are how quickly they respond to emergency orders and how many advance
deliveries they make.
Looking internally for cycle time reduction opportunities.
Purchasing can play a
signiﬁcant role in cycle time reduction on an internal basis. Your actions will
assist other functional areas to shorten their cycle times as well. For instance:
• Establish supplier partnerships that ensure frequent deliveries of high-
quality materials. These will not require intermediate incoming inspection,
and the materials can go from dock to point of use in the factory. This will
reduce manufacturing’s lead-time requirements.
• Specify container or lot sizes in line with manufacturing kanban size.
This will reduce storeroom picking time and material handling time. Also, stor-
age in, as well as reuse or recycling of, the containers is a time and money saver.
• Arrange for some consignment inventory to be stored somewhere
close to the manufacturing facility. This initiative reduces both the trans-
portation time and the availability time of the material for manufacturing.
• Establish an EDI network between the supplier and your company.
This can greatly reduce the amount of time required to call in orders, mail
POs, receive acknowledgments, and receive and pay invoices. An untold
amount of data of a nonproprietary nature can be transmitted via these EDI
networks, and this greatly contributes to the reduction of cycle time in nu-
merous organizations. Further, using the EDI link with the supplier to place
orders automatically on approved supplier partners based on a ﬁxed low-
limit quantity in inventory is another good use of such networks.
Be the one to resolve those problems that arise with suppliers.
Purchasing agents
and buyers are the eyes and ears of the company as far as suppliers are con-
cerned. Therefore, they should know the internal chain of command inside
the supplier’s company, and in many cases they should know the de facto
powers who can really get things done when there is a problem to resolve.
By working with inspection, accounting, production control, quality, and
product and manufacturing engineering, the buyers can greatly assist in ex-
pediting the resolution of problems.

Get involved in product development to accelerate cycle time reduction.
The time
it takes to get new products to market is critical in today’s highly competi-
tive environment. For instance, for the electronics industry, using privately
funded research and development takes two years to bring a new product to
market, with an 80% success rate. In the computer industry, it takes just one
year, with a 95% success rate.
The secret is that in many of these organizations a buyer serves as a mem-
ber of the design or product development team working on the new prod-
uct. Every time designers or engineers specify a new part or material that is
not currently purchased or available, they have to ﬁrst run it by the purchas-
ing member, who determines availability and cost. This process not only
keeps new product costs in line but also prevents designers from specifying
new and exotic materials when something more common and available will
do. 
With these and additional initiatives, purchasing professionals can be
major contributors to successful cycle time reduction initiatives.

Cycle counting has gathered an impressive array of followers. According to
our recent survey, one in three respondents has started a cycle counting prac-
tice in just the last year.
What cycle counting is really all about.
For most practitioners cycle counting
is thought of as a tool to achieve inventory record accuracy. In reality, the
primary objective of cycle counting is to identify and reduce the causes of
inventory error. Leading authority Kenneth B. Ackerman, president of the
K. B. Ackerman Company (Columbus, Ohio), asserts, “The by-product of
identifying and eliminating errors is accurate inventory.”
Meanwhile, cycle counting expert Robert A. Stahl, CPIM, president of
R. A. Stahl Company (Attleboro, Mass.), emphasizes, “As with any well-
designed quality assurance procedure, the role of cycle counting is not only
to measure the level of conformance to expectation but also to provide for
cause and corrective action when conformance is not achieved.”
Deﬁning the “real” goals and objectives of cycle counting.
According to Stahl,
there are two fundamental types of cycle counting. One is geared toward
identifying cause and corrective action (control group cycle counting), the
other toward ensuring conformance to the expectation (random cycle
counting).
561

The distinguishing characteristic of control group cycle counting is a
“short interval of time since the last known and accurate count,” he notes.
Steps to performing a control group cycle count are explained in the side-
bar.
Be wary of early cycle counting successes.
Because control group cycle count-
ing pays a lot of attention to a few items, Stahl observes that the individuals
pay particular attention to the items in the control group. “Therefore, the
errors are not corrected throughout all practices, but only in those practices
that affect the items in the control group,” he warns. Therefore, he advises
changing the control group to different items after success with the initial
control group. “Creating a rolling control group is the solution to this situ-
ation.” 
When to begin the random cycle counting process.
“This type of cycle counting
should not be started on a regular basis until the control group counting has
solved the causes of inventory record inaccuracy,” Stahl advises. “If the ac-
curacy is not meeting expectation, the causes must be identiﬁed and ﬁxed.
Random cycle counting does not provide a good means for doing either,”
he notes. Random cycle counting only establishes whether conformance to
expectation is present. It is a type of mathematical sampling. A sample of the
inventory is taken, and an inference to the entire inventory is drawn. If the
sample yields a 95% accuracy level, then the inference is that the entire in-
ventory is 95% accurate.
What and when to count.
Ackerman follows Pareto’s law (80/20 rule), or the
A-B-C inventory stratiﬁcation concept, in deﬁning what to count. For in-
stance, he advises, “A typical scenario would involve counting 6% of the A
items, 4% of the B items, and 2% of the C items each week.” When should
you count the items? When the counting is easy, he says, citing these examples:
• When an item is reordered
• When an inventory balance is zero or a negative quantity
• When an order is received
• When the inventory balance is low
Looking at the requirements of the individual cycle counters.
Ackerman believes
that the number of people who should do cycle counts depends on the

How to Establish a Control Group Cycle Counting Process
The steps to perform control group cycle counting include the following:
Task 1: Select the Control Group
The selection of the control group should represent the inventory in the tar-
get area, including parts or materials of all types, involving all activities. It
should include
•
high cost vs. low cost
•
hand count vs. scale count
•
high usage vs. low usage
•
big parts vs. small parts
•
stockroom vs. ﬂoor stock
•
discrete issue vs. bulk issue trans.
•
backﬂush
Usually there is a relatively small number of items in the control group. It
makes sense to record the results by area of responsibility, in order to make the
corrective action responsibility more clear as the project expands.
Task 2: Count the Control Group
Physically count the parts/materials of the control group. Take extra care that
the counts are correctly supervised. It often helps to have the material han-
dling or warehousing people perform their own physical counts. This way,
they more easily achieve “ownership” of the process.
The counting interval should be no greater than one week so that they
can most readily identify causes of error. Actual counting, however, can be
done daily; that is, count one-ﬁfth of the items every day.
Task 3: Compare Counts with Records
This administrative step simply compares the physical count with the com-
puter records. Care must be taken to ensure a clean cutoff of inventory trans-
action information.
If reconciliation shows that a discrepancy between the physical count and
the computer records exists, the ﬁrst action is to conduct a second count to
ensure accurate physical accounting. Once it is clear that a discrepancy is iden-
tiﬁed, the counters submit an adjustment to the computer records. This ad-
justment must be approved by the person responsible or accountable for in-
ventory record accuracy (i.e., the stockroom manager).
(continued)

Task 4: Reconcile and Identify Causes of Error
This is the most important task to gaining and sustaining inventory record ac-
curacy. In the initial stages (when errors are high), it is a very time-consuming
effort; however, it is one that must be done thoroughly.
Since the interval to the last known count was only one week, it is highly
likely that the precise cause of error can be found. Regardless, an exhaustive
effort needs to be put forth to determine the certain cause of error. Conclu-
sive evidence is the objective; circumstantial evidence causes people to be un-
certain and defensive.
Task 5: Develop Corrective Action
There are only two ultimate causes of errors in inventory record-keeping
practices:
•
Procedures inadequate to achieve the objective regularly
•
Human error in executing the procedures
Unfortunately, the tendency is to blame people too quickly for errors. If this
is done, the result is often that people feel threatened and spend more time
defending themselves than looking for solutions.
If people are making mistakes, it might be that the procedures are inca-
pable of being executed regularly with normal care. Perhaps the procedures
(or tools to do the job) need to be changed and improved.
There are various techniques that help with this problem-identiﬁcation
and problem-solving part of control group counting. Among them are Pareto
charts, storyboarding, cause and effect diagrams, run charts, check sheets, and
control charts.
If the errors continue, focus on that in discussion: What’s wrong with the
problem-solving process? Simply that if the errors are not eliminated, inven-
tory record accuracy will not be achieved. If the errors continue, do not ac-
celerate the cycle counting effort.
Task 6: Publish Results
Publishing the results takes two directions: to the people doing the work and
to management that is supporting the effort. The results published include not
only the statistical accuracy results but also the causes and corrective actions.

quantity of items in inventory, the desired count frequency, the number of
storage locations for each item, the number of count irregularities (re-
counts), accessibility of items, and physical characteristics of the items.
“A realistic standard for a cycle counter is 40 items per day,” he offers.
“The cycle counters should be familiar with the stock location system, the
warehouse layout, and the items being counted.” He recommends that cycle
counters be assigned to the job permanently, but “it does not mean cycle
counting is necessarily a full-time job,” he insists. Cycle counters also must
recognize the probability of crossovers. “When a count reveals an overage
in one item, the counters should be able to identify and check those items
that would normally be confused with the one that is not in balance,” Ack-
erman explains.
Cycle counting is not a one-shot effort.
Even after success is achieved, “the job
is not done,” warns Stahl. “Maintaining error-free record keeping is neces-
sary.”
“Continuous error investigation is critical to the cycle counting pro-
cess,” afﬁrms Ackerman. Stahl concurs, “Cycle counting is a must to ensure
that as changes occur and when the attention wanes, error-prone practices
don’t return.”

When there’s a problem with inventory accuracy, inventory management
personnel often turn to cycle counting for the remedy. In a recent Inventory
Reduction Report reader survey, almost 70% of the respondents who cited
“maintaining inventory accuracy” as their major challenge listed cycle count-
ing as the tool of choice to correct the condition. 
For example, the manager of quality/materials at a midsize producer of
motors said, “Since establishing an active cycle count program, our inven-
tory accuracy has moved from 80% to 95%, and we’re still improving our
performance with each passing month.” 
Cycle counting is not only for improving inventory accuracy.
Beyond its accuracy-
enhancing beneﬁts, cycle counting is also becoming a prominent inventory
management practice. In the same survey, cycle counting moved into the top

ﬁve practices that readers claim have been the most effective in controlling
their inventory during the past year. Speciﬁcally, one in three respondents
cite cycle counting as an effective practice. Only two years earlier, the re-
sponse was below 30%. 
In our opinion, this growth has accelerated because of the impressive re-
sults that inventory managers are experiencing. In fact, many readers have
shared their experiences and applications. The following excerpts provide
real-world examples of where cycle counting is working successfully.
Making inventory accuracy a priority.
“When I came to this company 10
months ago, inventory accuracy carried a low priority,” says a materials man-
ager at a large producer of power generation equipment for the utility sec-
tor. “One of my ﬁrst priorities was to ‘sell’ the advantages of inventory ac-
curacy within the organization, especially what it means to the bottom line.” 
Simultaneously, he organized a “focused physical inventory,” which was
done “all at one time, and with the proper manning resources.” Following
the physical, which provided the company a base, “We greatly upgraded the
cycle counting program and coupled it with ABC analysis. We now can re-
port that we’ve signiﬁcantly reduced our inventories and have a much bet-
ter understanding of what we have and where it is located throughout the
facility,” he continues.
Payback covers additional salary of one person.
“Our inventory situation was a
mess,” explains a materials manager at a midsize maker of surgical devices.
“Our recommendation was to reinstitute cycle counts. However, since our
resources were rather limited, we had to hire a person and train him in the
technicalities of the process.”
But it was the right move. “The savings we’re recording in less machine
downtime due to inaccurate inventory far exceeds the salary of this addi-
tional individual,” the manager boasts.
Boosting accuracy to 99.7% for ﬁnished goods inventory alone.
“We began a
daily cycle counting program, and together with using the ABC approach,
count about 50 parts per day,” reports a material services manager at a mid-
size maker of highly sophisticated electrical test instruments. 
Over the last 12 months they have counted more than 20,000 parts and
veriﬁed inventory accuracy at 98.2% for parts count and 98.8% for dollar
value on raw materials. Similarly, for ﬁnished goods, accuracy is 99.5% for
parts and 99.7% on a dollars basis.
566
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

“Primary to our success, we believe, is the emphasis we place at identi-
fying and quickly correcting the root causes of errors that cycle counting
brings to our attention,” he declares.
Eliminating plant shutdowns to do physical inventory.
The logistics director at a
large provider of logistics services summarizes his experience: “We enhanced
our cycle counting procedures, which then helped us to eliminate inventory
out-of-stocks, reduce inventory errors and loss, and cut back our quarterly
shutdowns for a physical inventory. Now we do it only once a year.”
Improving planning decisions.
“Our cycle counting and internal audit pro-
cesses have ﬁnally convinced our planners that our inventory accuracy is
consistently high enough for them to make their decisions with much more
conﬁdence,” explains the lead person of inventory control at a large manu-
facturer of material handling equipment. “They no longer have to pad their
decisions because of concerns over inventory accuracy.”
Better view of slow-moving inventory.
A distribution manager at a small sup-
plier of electrical tools maintains that “cycle counting has allowed us to view
patterns in our inventory that show up as slower-moving and obsolete items.
It throws up a red ﬂag that prompts quick action.”
Training initiatives essential to cycle counting program’s success.
“The previous
manager had eliminated the cycle count program, and some material had not
been counted or veriﬁed in over three years,” maintains the corporate mate-
rials manager at a large producer of equipment for the semiconductor in-
dustry. “We did an audit and found our inventory accuracy at a dismal 60%.”
The parts today are all counted, with accuracy moving past the 90%
mark and “climbing every day.” The key to this improvement, he says, is the
training that was provided to the entire warehouse staff. “We taught them
the intricacies of cycle counting and the impact accuracy has on the pro-
duction ﬂoor and bottom line.”
Fixing the causes for errors promptly.
“Our inventory accuracy was horrible,”
relates the plant manager at a small manufacturer of industrial valves. “We
typically kept too much of the wrong inventory. Today we have a daily cycle
counting program, and we cycle through our entire inventory in about two
weeks,” he states. “One thing we learned was to remain dedicated to ﬁxing
the problems that we ﬁnd when we do a cycle count. So, each week we cor-

rect the problems we ﬁnd, and the following week, our accuracy improves
that much more.”
Slashing end-of-month inventories by 90% through vigorous cycle counting process.
The business planning manager at a large maker of wireless electronics prod-
ucts implemented a cycle counting program as part of an internal ﬁnance re-
porting process. 
“Our goal was to reduce the amount of end-of-month inventory that
was at our forwarder,” he explains. “The sales were reversed for the products
that were at the forwarder’s location at the end of the month. This situation
pushed sales to make sure that the product was not just made, but that it also
was shipped,” he details. “Since we began the cycle counting program,
we’ve reduced our end-of-month inventory from an average $3 million to
about $300,000, and it’s still in decline.”
Getting good cycle counting results requires commitment.
“We looked at cycle
counting a few years back, and we just didn’t get the results we thought we
should,” explains the director of purchasing at a small producer of lighting
ﬁxtures. “The lesson we learned from that ﬁrst attempt was that good cycle
counting requires a committed and consistent work group, which we ini-
tially didn’t have.”
The purchasing director, who is now leading a renewed effort to im-
plement cycle counting at the company, is focusing on selecting and edu-
cating the “right” staff before again introducing it at the plant level.
Cycle counting with assistance from bar coding and radio frequency (RF) technology.
“To date, cycle counting has helped us determine the best way to control in-
ventory,” maintains a purchasing manager at a large abattoir. “We imple-
mented cycle counting with an inventory control system that includes bar
coding and RF scanning equipment, and we are getting some great results.”
Annual inventory a thing of the past.
Cycle counting at a midsize producer of
hardware products is serving as a bridge between yesterday’s manual process
and tomorrow’s automated system.
“We do random cycle counting of all inventory, and the use of RF/bar
code technology has helped us eliminate our traditional year-end annual in-
ventory practice last year,” the distribution center manager explains. “We’re
now in the process of studying how to adapt RF/computer cycle counting
into our operation.”

Daily decisions for purchasing and manufacturing are all based directly or in-
directly on forecasts. However, research indicates that forecast accuracy at
the item level by month averages less than 62%. With this type of perfor-
mance and top management pressure to optimize inventory, improve cus-
tomer service, and better utilize resources, the only recourse is to develop
more accurate forecasts.
Industry authority Ann K. Willis, CFPIM, CIRM, education and re-
source manager at ObTech, LLC (Mooresville, N.C.; ann.willis@obtech.
com), puts this need into today’s perspective. “A lot of emphasis has been placed
on purchasing and customer service links in the supply chain,” she explained at
a recent Congress for Progress sponsored by the Mid-Atlantic chapters of the
American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS). “However,
forecasting is often downplayed as having minor importance. In actuality, the
forecast is the driver of the entire supply chain.” Willis maintains that accuracy
improvement begins with a sound forecasting process (see sidebar).
Toward a more accurate forecast.
Experts and practitioners alike agree that
forecasting is never easy. When accuracy is the goal, the challenge intensi-
ﬁes. Martin J. Mirsky, CFPIM, president of Supply Chain Systems, Inc.
(Midland, Mich.; 517-923-3333), advises, “One axiom is not to try to fore-
cast at a detail level more than is reasonable.”
Meanwhile, demand management expert John R. Allen, CFPIM,
CIRM, president of Applied Management Solutions, Ltd. (Chalfont, Pa.;
215-822-5878), says, “We want to work toward a perfect forecast. At min-
imum, we have to be perfect at the product family level, then work for per-
fection at the product level.” 
Similarly, Donald H. Sheldon, CFPIM, CIRM, vice president of Buker,
Inc. (Oxford, N.Y.; 607-843-2510, ext. 52) explains, “In most businesses it
should be recognized that forecasting at the SKU level will probably be in-
accurate.” Like Allen, he develops “product families and using breakpoints
as forecast buckets.”
Why greater customer involvement is necessary.
“It is much easier to use the cus-
tomer’s information to determine future needs than to attempt to forecast
what they will need without their input,” counsels Willis. One technique
she recommends is schedule sharing.

11 Steps to Building Credible Forecasting Process
To be effective, forecasts must provide proper and accurate information to all
facets of the organization. The following policies and procedures will ensure
that happens.
1. Establish forecasting policies and procedures. Address the following:
•
What items are included in the forecast?
•
When and how often is the forecast updated?
•
What horizons and time periods should be used?
•
How are statistical and judgmental considerations combined?
•
What functional area, or combination of areas, is responsible for
the forecast, accuracy, and resultant inventory?
•
What key departments will review and agree upon the forecast?
•
Under what circumstances can the forecast be changed within the
time fence?
2. Determine what to forecast. Analyze the bills of material to determine
at which level the forecast should be done, remembering that the fewer the
items, the more accurate the forecast is. Computer information systems that
support customer-focused forecasting must have the capability to deﬁne and
manage information at multiple levels of detail, from the strategic, down
through market segments and product groups, and ﬁnally at the item level.
3. Modularize options. Forecast made-to-order assemblies and common
components as separate items. Do not attempt to forecast every option avail-
able to a customer.
4. Assign responsibility. Accountability for providing and maintaining
forecast data must be given to a speciﬁc individual or group, preferably some-
one with a vested interest in the forecast performance. The owner of the fore-
cast should manage the process and track performance, merging input from
all groups to prepare the forecast.
5. Select forecasting tools and techniques. These should be part of an over-
all system that allows for demand changes and supports the policies set by the
organization. Use both qualitative (relying on judgment) and quantitative (re-
lying on data) methods. Examples of quantitative methods are moving aver-
age, exponential smoothing, graphic methods, and trend projections. Ex-
amples of qualitative methods are market surveys, historical analogies, panels
of experts, and the Delphi model. Also, it is critical to remember that a single
forecasting approach may not be appropriate for everything being forecasted.

“Schedule sharing provides a way to actually assist the customer in ac-
curately forecasting future demands while increasing the supplier’s future
visibility and adaptability,” she details. The customer’s schedule becomes the
supplier’s schedule, rendering the supplier simply an extension of the cus-
tomer’s facility. Suppliers maintain regular communication with customer’s
current inventory levels, desired minimum and maximum quantities, and
production schedules. “This information determines future shipments re-
quired to reach optimum inventory levels,” Willis notes. 
Audits and Physical Inventory/Accuracy
571
Different approaches and techniques are required for short- and long-term
forecasts and for products in different phases of their life cycles.
6. Determine how data are to be gathered and conditioned. Conditioning or
ﬁltering points out problems such as missing data, extremely high or low
points, and impacts of large one-time orders.
7. Document assumptions. The major assumptions that went into the de-
velopment of the forecast should be documented so that they can be validated
when the forecast performance is reviewed. Documenting assumptions, pro-
motions made, and conditions during the period being reviewed makes it
much easier to apply knowledge going forward. Review the history and the
forecast as it exists. Apply what you know to that information. Why do your
customers want the product? What phase of the life cycle is it in? Are there
factors that may cause changes, such as weather, economic cycles, or what-
ever factors impact your particular business? The key is to use what you know
about the future and the past to modify what history would tell you to do.
8. Review items in a group if possible. Patterns may begin to emerge that
can be useful in reviewing exceptions and that will make it easier to deﬁne the
true exceptions or actions to be taken.
9. Analyze trends, seasonality, and promotional impact on a product line at the
same time. It is also helpful to think of yourself as a consumer during a pro-
motional period. If I know that a product will be going on sale, I will not only
delay purchasing but may buy more than I originally intended while the price
is low.
10. Measure the forecast. You must establish measurements and set targets
that measure the accuracy of each forecast and deﬁne steps for improvement.
11. Monitor the forecast method. Using tracking signals can help determine
when to change methods of forecasting to one that will be more accurate.
Most forecasting packages provide tools for this type of monitoring.

She also mentions distribution resource planning (DRP) as a tool. This
time-phased logistics planning system uses techniques similar to those of
schedule sharing in that it allows a company to substitute valid information
for inventory. Willis also maintains, “The need for forecasting can be re-
duced, and even eliminated, as visibility is gained into customers’ true re-
quirements.”
Once achieved, sustain forecast accuracy.
“A forecast that is not tested for valid-
ity has little value,” states John C. Barry, CPIM, president of Modern Busi-
ness Solutions, Inc. (Brookﬁeld, Wisc.; jbarry@mbsi.com). 
In addition, Sheldon believes that “part of the forecasting process is to
conﬁrm the plan and test it against risks. Eliminating this step puts the busi-
ness at risk when decisions about inventory placement and customer service
imperatives are not addressed.”
However, Willis warns, “The motive for measuring forecast accuracy
should not be to point ﬁngers at the forecaster.” She outlines the following
for sustaining forecast accuracy:
• Analyze the forecast error. This requires more than just a review of past
history, forecasts, and actual demand. The assumptions used to develop the
forecast also are helpful in determining exactly why the forecast was incor-
rect.
• Measure aggregate performance. This evaluates how well actual orders
matched the forecast for a particular product group. It can be useful for
short-term decisions such as overtime or schedule changes. A continual pat-
tern over several periods mandates analysis and review at a more detailed
level.
• Report exceptions when measuring at the item level. This method will
highlight those items that have mismatches. The numbers of each occur-
rence by type of exception, such as unusual demand, should be tracked. This
will identify patterns for items or groups of items, which will be helpful in
determining reasons for inaccuracies. 
• Measure the number of items that experience service level problems due to fore-
cast error. When tracked over time by forecast error, it will highlight those ar-
eas that need more observation, more input from sales, or tighter parame-
ters.

Cycle counting continues to blossom as a best practice among managers of
inventory. According to our latest reader survey, 41.4% of respondents have
instituted cycle counting procedures during the past year. This is up from
32.7% a year ago and 29.6% three years ago. That’s an impressive trend line.
Focus on rooting out the causes of inventory inaccuracy.
Although the responses
to a recent reader study continue to link cycle counting with greater inven-
tory accuracy, the real advance is with the growing numbers of inventory
management personnel who use cycle counting to get at the root causes of
the inaccuracy in the ﬁrst place. For instance:
• “We’ve been enhancing our cycle counting practice for the past three
years,” explains an inventory control manager at a midsize maker of rubber
products. “We’ve increased the quantity of products counted each day and
zealously followed through on determining why there is an error. It’s been
hard work—no doubt about it—but our inventory accuracy has greatly im-
proved, and we no longer have to do a year-end physical,” she proclaims. 
• “We are cycle counting to root out BOM errors and then ﬁx them”
reports a controller at a small producer of recreational boating products.
“This eliminates future shortages and improves accuracy.”
• “Cycle counting has been our most successful venture, enabling us to
pinpoint problem areas between full physicals,” an accounting manager at a
small manufacturer of transportation equipment offers.
Applying the ABC approach to cycle counting.
“We’ve been cycle counting for
almost four years now,” reports the materials management manager at a large
aircraft repair facility. “We use an ABC approach [see sidebar] and count the
fast movers more often. This has permitted us to reduce stock on hand, pro-
vided we control and manage the usage rates, lead times, and safety stocks,”
he explains.
No additional time is required to do the cycle counting.
“We do cycle counting
as part of the normal, daily job function; therefore, no additional costs are
involved,” he maintains.

The Many Methodologies of Cycle Counting
Cycle counting uses a sampling technique and selects a small number of items
to be counted each day. The following are methods of selecting part numbers
for the sample:
•
ABC selection method. This method focuses on maximizing beneﬁts of
accuracy while at the same time minimizing the effort and cost required. The
ABC selection method usually carries a ﬁnancial perspective that comes from
classifying items into Class A, B, or C, based upon dollar/currency value.
For example, Class A items would consist of 10% of the inventory items
which make up 60% of the dollar/currency value. Class B items would in-
clude the next 10% of the items that comprise 20% of the value. Class C items
would be the remaining 80% of the items that are primarily of low dollar/cur-
rency value.
Under the ABC selection method, Class A items would be selected for
counting perhaps monthly; Class B items, quarterly; and class C items, once
or twice per year.
The ABC selection method is not always deﬁned by currency value.
Items may be reclassiﬁed based upon criticality, lead time, and storage space
requirements, or some other factor. Whatever the perspective used, all items
are classiﬁed and different sample sizes, count frequencies, and tolerance lim-
its are applied to each class.
•
Reorder selection method. This method selects the cycle count sample
based on the need to replenish the item. When a reorder is required, it is an-
ticipated that the on-hand quantity will be relatively low, making the physi-
cal count easier to take.
It is also reasoned that a small variation in actual count to computer bal-
ance during this time can interrupt production through unanticipated stock-
outs.
•
Free counts method. This method of cycle counting consists of allowing
the stock area personnel to make “free” counts as the situation presents itself.
Examples of free counts include counting as a replenishment lot is being re-
ceived, counting when pulling the last item from a location, or counting all
items in a location. 
•
Other methods. Items should be included in the count sample any time
a condition implies that a problem exists and needs to be researched. Ex-
amples would include a computer balance that is negative or when there is a
quantity on hand in the computer without a valid stock area location.

Spot checks validate cycle counting results.
“We have enhanced our cycle count-
ing procedures to the point where we now count A items only three times
per year, B items twice, and C parts annually,” reports a materials services
manager at a large builder of aircraft engine cases. “We also have spot checks
from accounting to validate what we do on a weekly basis.”
Aggressive cycle counting for slow moving produce.
The distribution director at
a retail grocery concern explains, “In the fast-turning section of our ware-
houses, we conduct a daily wall-to-wall, while we have an aggressive cycle
count program in other portions of the warehouse for slower-moving
items.” According to the director, these actions, combined with having their
buyers order on a just-in-time (JIT) basis and selling the inventory that they
have in transit, have reduced inventory costs by $20,000 per month.
Inventory accuracy soars into mid-90% level after only one year of cycle counting.
“Our inventory accuracy was an embarrassment,” maintains an inventory
control manager at a midsize producer of janitorial supplies. “About a year
ago, we looked into and adopted cycle counting practices. We do a daily
cycle count with our manufacturing employees and follow up with trained
inventory cycle counters who focus on just the A and B items.”
New technology aids the cycle counting process.
“When we implemented bar
code scanning, it allowed us to do quick cycle counts,” notes a purchasing
coordinator at a small producer of powder coatings. “This has given us more
accurate inventory readouts and has allowed us to reduce our safety stock
levels. It also has saved us many hours of doing daily visual counts.”
Error detection enhanced through cycle counting.
A materials manager at a large
cruise line explains, “Cycle counting on a weekly basis has greatly assisted
our warehouse personnel in identifying problems with particular inventory
items, such as packaging, units of measure, and item number confusion.”
One problem that she discusses, unit of measure issues for stock, is being
solved through bar code technology.
Cycle counting eliminates need for physical inventories.
“We have been using the
ABC cycle counting technique in our RF warehouse environment and im-
proved our inventory accuracy to 99.2%,” maintains the inventory adminis-
trator at a large manufacturer of consumer products. “We’ve also been able
Audits and Physical Inventory/Accuracy

to eliminate costly and time-consuming physical inventories and reduce our
machine downtime signiﬁcantly.”
A by-product of cycle counting is the stocking of more appropriate lev-
els of seasonal inventory. “Cycle counting, together with the use of im-
proved forecasts and a statistically driven scheduling system, has given us the
ideal solution,” he claims.
Introducing cycle counting practice in quest to eliminate excessive inventories.
“There was a general lack of concern and support from upper management
to stop ‘business as usual’ practices that resulted in excessive stock of on-hand
ﬁnished goods,” acknowledges an inventory control coordinator at a small
producer of electronic components.
“We’ve just begun to implement the ABC approach and cycle counting
to try and reduce our inventory,” she explains. “Not only are we looking for-
ward to improving our inventory record accuracy, but we also want to elim-
inate our biannual physical counts.”

Despite widespread improvements, inventory accuracy remains an enigma
to many managers. To others, it’s a quixotic challenge. Inventory Reduction Re-
port readers repeatedly rank achieving greater inventory accuracy as one of
their primary—and often their top—challenges.
Just how accurate should the inventory record really be?
George J. Miller, presi-
dent of PROACTION Management Consultants (Oak Park, Calif.;
Gproaction@aol.com), says that “The conventional Class A ERP inventory
accuracy threshold is said to be 95%-plus. However, I believe this is inade-
quate to run a world-class operation, because it means that one in every 20
items has a signiﬁcant error, which may result in shortages, expediting, air
freight expense, overtime, premium charges, overstocks, and the like.” Based
on his experience, inventory accuracy should be 98+%, preferably 99+%.
Meanwhile, Thomas F. Ribar, CFPIM, president of Management So-
lutions International (Cedarburg, Wisc.; TFRibar@aol.com), declares,
“Old paradigms reverberate through companies of all sizes and industries—
achieving 98% inventory integrity is just impossible to do.” As a result, some
never get started because it looks so difﬁcult. However, agreeing with Miller,
Ribar stresses that 98% inventory integrity is possible.

I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

The cycle counting myth to inventory accuracy.
To many, the application of
cycle counting is tantamount to improving inventory accuracy. “While it is
a very important item in the tool kit of the inventory or materials profes-
sional,” argues Miller, “cycle counting is mainly a measurement, diagnostic
tool. Think of it as statistical process control for inventory accuracy.” 
Ribar maintained at a recent Annual APICS International Conference,
“Cycle counting allows you to ﬁx the process of inventory control, not
merely the on-hand balances. The sole purpose is to identify the root cause
of the inventory integrity problems and then to ﬁx them.” According to
Ribar, cycle counting is the “ﬁnal exam” of an eight-step process for achiev-
ing greater inventory integrity (see Figure II-6.1).
Creating an effective inventory accuracy program.
In an exclusive interview
Miller outlined the fundamentals of an effective inventory accuracy initia-
tive. The major elements include the following:
• Inventory accuracy measurement criteria. This includes item/part number
identiﬁcation, quantity and unit of measure, location, and posting timeli-
ness. Companies also measure related data, such as customer/contract num-
ber, conﬁguration/revision letter, lot, serial number, grade, and expiration
date.
“I have visited companies claiming to have 95%, 98%, or 99+% record
accuracy that quickly shrinks to mid–double digits when we apply our un-
compromising criteria objectively,” Miller argues. Sometimes companies
have invalid criteria; sometimes they deceive themselves; and sometimes
employees deceive them, unconsciously or unwittingly.
• A clearly deﬁned material and document ﬂow. Control and tracking points
should be clearly identiﬁed. These should be marked out in the shop, and
employees should be thoroughly indoctrinated.
• Adequate facilities, space, storage, and material handling systems. “Good
housekeeping practices are a must,” he insists.
• Effective policies and procedures. These are required for material han-
dling, storage, identiﬁcation, packaging, labeling, data collection, counting,
and transactions.
• Training/certiﬁcation/assessment program. Include all people who handle
or track inventory or are in a position to inﬂuence how well that works.
• An ongoing assessment and diagnostic program. This includes cycle count-
ing. “Such programs may be administered in any one of several organizations
in the company, as long as the manager in charge is sensitive to inventory
Audits and Physical Inventory/Accuracy
577

accuracy needs and earnestly dedicates the effort to the program,” Miller ex-
plains. “We believe that third-party oversight, by an internal or external au-
dit group or an outside consultant, is needed to keep the program on track.” 
• An effective cut-off control and reconciliation procedure, including accounting
for all transaction documents. “Don’t dare even think about real cycle counting
578
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T
Figure II-6.1
An Eight-Step Process for Achieving Inventory Record Integrity

until you get control of this,” he warns. “It is recommended, however, that
you start early with a small control group to debug the process and begin er-
ror diagnostics. Expand to larger cycle count problems after you know what
you’re doing.”
• An inventory accuracy oversight group. This group conducts periodic rig-
orous audits to ensure the integrity of the process. This might be the ﬁnance
department, or an outside accounting ﬁrm or consultant.
• Transaction control system. Post transactions and provide inventory sta-
tus to all departments that need it, preferably via on-line computer system.
“Bar code and other automated data collection systems are desirable, if cost
effective, but are by no means mandatory to run an accurate system,” Miller
explains. Visual control systems, such as kanban, two-bin, and pallet squares
can sometimes reduce or even eliminate the need for most transactions and
an automated system, “in the proper circumstances.”
Miller observes, “Discipline is essential, day after day, year after year.
This is not a one-time cleanup job that management can declare victory for
and just go home. It requires that someone be at least a part-time ‘accuracy
czar,’ and to keep the accuracy effort focused and permanent.” 
Manage the risk factors to achieve inventory integrity.
“Inventory integrity is
truly a company project that involves many departments,” states Ribar. 
Gerald L. Kilty, CPIM, CIRM, president of Quality Management Solu-
tions, Inc. (Clearwater, Fla.), concurs. “Top management is responsible for
setting policies as to inventory levels. Sales is responsible for preparing a fore-
cast of demand that can be measured for accuracy. Purchasing is responsible for
managing supplier lead times. Process design is responsible for reducing cycle
time and the structure of the bill of materials. Reducing inventory and main-
taining data accuracy is everybody’s job,” Kilty said at the APICS Conference.
That said, Ribar notes ﬁve most common risks that inhibit companies
from achieving 98+% levels of inventory integrity:
1. Senior management was never totally committed in the ﬁrst place. “They did
not attend regular review meetings and did not deal directly with those that
stood in the way of progress,” Ribar explains.
2. The team did not have the necessary experience. Consequently, the proj-
ect was unable to be effective in a climate where resources are few and time
is scarce.
Audits and Physical Inventory/Accuracy
579

3. Time was never allocated for the project. Establish the initial project pri-
ority by developing a compelling ﬁnancial case for the project.
4. Experience and know-how are not available on the team. “If the inventory
record integrity project team is comprised of at least 50% certiﬁed APICS
professionals, the likelihood of success will increase by 100%,” he declares.
If you cannot enlist certiﬁed professionals, then have an internal project
manager who has accomplished the inventory record integrity feat in an-
other division of your company, or at a previous company. Otherwise, con-
sider some outside coaching assistance.
5. Data lead to blame. Measure and post quantitative metrics “to drive
improvement instead of using it to point ﬁngers and scold the guilty,” he ar-
gues. The published accuracy numbers need to be used to drive continuous
improvement.
In fact, Miller warns, “Not everyone agrees that an inventory accuracy
initiative is important and should be done. It does require a high degree of
consensus on approach, designation of responsibilities, and ‘ownership.’” In
extreme cases, “top management may need to step in to help change the cul-
ture and help oversee the changes.”

“The forecast is wrong!” This is not an uncommon remark made or heard
by inventory and materials managers at one time or another, especially when
the inaccurate forecast directly contributes to stockouts or overly high in-
ventory situations. To their credit, managers are making valiant attempts to
correct the problem (see sidebar). For example, a recent reader poll ﬁnds that
28.2% of the respondents are now focusing on improving forecast accuracy.
That’s a leap of almost eight points since a year earlier.
Several leading authorities and practitioner/experts focused their pre-
sentations on offering solutions to the forecasting problem at a recent An-
nual APICS International Conference. We excerpt three of the most ag-
gressive solutions that were offered.

Five Bonus Issues to Consider for Improving Your
Forecast Accuracy
Leading authorities Terrell J. Harris, managing partner at Chicago Consult-
ing (Chicago; tjharris@aol.com), and Nancy D. Killen, president of Bailey-
Killen Associates (Cutchogue, N.Y.; nkillen@compuserve.com), addressing
forecast accuracy at a recent Council of Logistics Management Annual Con-
ference, answered the following questions:
•
Are forecasts adjusted for unusually high (or low) backlogs? Actually, the
backlog is dependent on fulﬁllment capabilities of the organization and is not
dependent on the marketplace. Sometimes large backlogs are an indication
that the forecast should decrease, especially when cancellations occur or
phantom orders are placed.
•
Do returns impact the forecast, and should they? Probably not, they agree,
“especially if you’re forecasting shipments rather than net sales.” Nevertheless,
some organizations and businesses recycle parts that normally invest heavily in
forecasting returns and do so in a “very separate fashion.” Equipment manufac-
turers who rebuild some of their parts separately forecast that return logistics
ﬂow. “Combining these two forecasts is a very interesting exercise,” they note.
•
Does the forecast have to be in whole numbers? Systems often force some
forecasts to be in whole numbers, as they cannot deal in 1⁄2, for example. “Yet
what’s wrong with 1⁄2 a unit per month?” asks Harris. “That’s one unit every two
months, a pretty legitimate demand in some businesses.” Pareto’s law says that
the vast majority of items are slow movers; so if you round a number like 1.5 to
2, 33% error is automatically introduced. If you round 0.6 to 1.0, a 67% error is
introduced into the forecast by a system that deals only in whole numbers.
•
Is the forecast for the month dependent on the number of trading days? Count-
ing holidays, a month can have as few as 19 and as many as 23 trading days.
That’s a 21% swing. “Most systems would kill for a 20% increase in forecast-
ing accuracy,” Harris and Killen declare.
Similarly, look to ordering patterns within the week, they urge. For ex-
ample, many organizations have a big demand on Monday, and few orders are
placed on Friday. However, a month can have as few as three Mondays and as
many as ﬁve. “So if Monday is your big day, accounting for the number of
Mondays there are in a particular month can improve your forecast accuracy,”
they advise.
•
Would it help to forecast more frequently? There is very marginal gain by
forecasting very, very frequently. In fact, they declare, sometime it leads to a
worst forecast. According to Killen, “I think sometimes it gets confused with
the gain associated with being able to record sales immediately and its impact
on inventory, which is incredibly helpful.”
Audits and Physical Inventory/Accuracy

explains, “By sharing one’s schedule with the supplier, the opportunity to
work with real demand is provided, not a forecast.”
He warns that you must ﬁrst meet with your suppliers and advise them
that you will be sharing information that is highly conﬁdential. Have the
supplier sign a conﬁdentiality agreement to reinforce this goal. Once done,
Williams outlines the following initiatives:
• Segregate the requirements by supplier. This will form the basis of the
information that will be transmitted to the supplier.
• Determine how solid or ﬂuid the quantities and items are within the
company’s time fences. For example, if quantities are frozen within the ﬁrst
four weeks but subject to 25% to 50% swings from weeks four to eight, doc-
ument this information so that it can be discussed with the supplier.
• Meet with the supplier to review how the information is structured.
Keep in mind that manufacturing resource planning (MRP) may be a for-
eign concept to some of the suppliers, so in-depth training may be needed
for them to understand how to use the information to help schedule their
business.
• Guarantee that once an item is called for within the frozen time
fence, it will be purchased. The most effective schedule-sharing agreements
have this provision. Suppliers will not be nearly as reluctant to produce, and
possibly customize, inventory for a customer that guarantees it will be pur-
chased.
• Review seasonal trends and abnormal events with the supplier. This
may include, but is not limited to, vacation shutdowns and special promo-
tions. Obtain agreements about how these special events will be handled.
• Determine how often and in what form the schedule will be trans-
mitted. Should it be sent daily, weekly, or monthly? Sent via mail, fax, elec-
tronic data interchange (EDI), or e-mail?
A process to verify a new customer’s forecast.
Cynthia A. Neuhaus, CPIM,
CIRM, ﬁeld inventory manager at Grainger Industrial Supply, has devel-
oped several techniques that help her assess the validity of getting that ﬁrst
forecast from a new customer. Before doing anything, you must answer
three questions:
• Do they have experience with the line; and is this simply a supplier
change for them, or is it an entirely new line?
582
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

• Are there any differences in marketing approaches between your
company and the new customer that would cause differences in product mix
or seasonality?
• Is it a forecast of their intended purchases or sales to their own cus-
tomers?
Neuhaus next tests the forecast she gets from a customer: “Take all their
item forecasts in a product line or two, a few dozen items, or whatever num-
ber your resources allow, and add them up on a spreadsheet. Then calculate
the percentage of contribution to the mix for each item. Select the same
items from your records, and do the same thing.” If the percentage contri-
bution to the mix for the customer forecast and your own experience are
close, you can use it “pretty conﬁdently,” she notes.
When there’s a difference and they have experience with the line, de-
termine whether they have a market difference and whether that explains the
situation. “For instance, if I were an automotive replacement parts manu-
facturer that served all types of vehicles, and my new customer was one that
serviced just heavy trucks, that would explain the difference,” she allows.
“If the differences can’t be explained, I would use the customer forecast
for the initial order only, because that’s what they think they need, and then
throw it away.” Neuhaus asserts.
“If it is a new line for a new customer, I strongly recommend that you
give them a forecast, rather than the other way around,” she shares. “Your
company has experience, and who better to determine a valid stocking
plan?”
Introducing demand ﬂow leadership to manage the supply chain.
Arne Brander,
CPIM, partner at Bernd Remmers Consultants AG (Zug, Switzerland), and
Tom F. Fischer, CPIM, supply chain manager at Ciba Specialty Chemicals,
explain the focus of demand ﬂow leadership is to manage the supply chain
with the “best possible demand information, and to synchronize the supply
ﬂow.” It also aims to improve all parameters of the supply chain, such as lead
times, lot sizes, and safety stocks. 
“In the past, companies developed forecasts using distribution require-
ments planning, and the forecasts were conﬁrmed by actual orders from the
distribution centers,” they explain. “These requirements forecasts and orders
were too often lumpy through lot sizes, lead times, and, above all, manual
changes of the supply chain managers at the various distribution points.”
Audits and Physical Inventory/Accuracy
583

Demand ﬂow leadership, the current thrust in Europe, involves the fol-
lowing:
• Develop forecasts using the best possible demand information. “Best
possible demand information [ﬁnished goods] is end customer demand,”
Brander and Fischer explain. This demand is summed and forms the basis for
forecasting. In global supply chains, this means that the demand from several
regions needs to be summed. Prerequisites include ﬁxed date for month-end
closing and EDI capabilities to transfer data into the central data warehouse.
The summed data are used to develop an overall computer forecast that is
veriﬁed manually.
• Replenish regional and local DCs using the push method. Establish
optimal distribution inventory levels, which include safety stock and re-
plenishment rules. “Push the products from the factory to the central ware-
house and distribute to the local warehouses according to order point and
fair share,” they describe.
• Synchronize the supply chain and create a ﬂow. The forecast is con-
verted to a master production schedule using gross to net explosion with
lead-time offset. The master production schedule corresponds to the fore-
casts, considering that desired inventory changes and load/capacity are
checked using rough-cut capacity planning. The best way to create a ﬂow-
like supply process using an ERP system is through the use of ﬁrmed planned
orders. These orders can only be changed manually by the planner and
should only be done when the forecast deviates outside deﬁned limits and
thus is systematically wrong or when major problems occur in the supply
process.

In this age of benchmarking, one of the most interesting and informative se-
ries for inventory performance is the PulseMark Benchmarks for U.S. Manu-
facturing Productivity. The most striking feature of this annual study is that the
data refer to the performance within a single plant, rather than an aggregate
for a business unit, division, or entire company.
Further, the inventory turnover benchmarks are segregated into indi-
vidual segments, such as raw materials, work-in-process, and ﬁnished goods
(see Figures II-7.1, II-7.2, and II-7.3). In fact, the series also measures obso-
lete inventory as a percent of net sales (see Figure II-7.4). Finally, the charts
display the data according to the general type of manufacturing operation
being performed at that facility (discrete, assemble-to-order, process, job
shop, engineer-to-order, and repetitive).
The best performers keep getting better.
With the release of the fourth annual
PulseMark survey (produced by the National Association of Manufacturers,
along with McGladrey & Pullen, LLP, and RSM McGladrey, Inc.), we
caught up with Duane C. Oest, executive vice president of RSM Mc-
Gladrey, Inc. (Schaumburg, Ill.; 847-413-6247; duane_oest@rsmi.com). 
In the following exclusive, Oest, who has been an integral part of the
PulseMark benchmark study since its inception, provides us with his insights
into the observations, trends, and developments that he noticed from

reviewing the information provided by 25,000 companies with one or more
manufacturing sites. 
“The most apparent trend taking place is the establishment of a breakaway
group of manufacturing companies,” Oest says. Over the life of the bench-
mark series they have ranked a balanced scorecard of operating and ﬁnancial
individual plant performance indicators across three performance categories:

• Low performers (25th percentile)
• Average performers (50th percentile)
• High performers (75th percentile) 
The three rankings are clear and easy to understand. However, the past
two years have seen the emergence of dominant performers that rank in the
90th to 99th percentiles. “The reason for calling attention to the dominant
performers is due to the magnitude of their performance,” he offers. As an
example, he cites their inventory performance (see Table II-7.1).
What the top leaders are doing is simply astounding.
“While inventory perfor-
mance continues to be a problem for midlevel manufacturing companies, it
appears that time spent focusing on business processes and systems has
yielded sizable performance gains for the dominant performer,” Oest ob-
serves. “We have seen, across virtually all manufacturing types and industries,
a select top 5% or 10% of our companies achieve consistent high perfor-
mance.”
While the PulseMark data are conﬁdential, the study team has spoken
to many of the consistent top performers. What they have found is that
“highly successful companies have simply focused on the key elements that
align and enable their strategy.” As an example, one common theme is the
greater interest in these companies of increasing shareholder value.
“Inventory can play a large part in driving that calculation,” Oest asserts.
“Simply understanding their starting position and then focusing and track-
ing incremental improvement have paid dividends.”
The drivers that have the most impact on inventory performance and shareholder
value.
“Many ﬁrms still see inventory strictly as a converted form of cash
and don’t see it as one of the largest uses of shareholder capital,” Oest details.

tems is the understanding and ongoing measurement of raw material, work
in progress (WIP), and ﬁnished goods. 
“A total inventory turn number, while sufﬁcient for ﬁnancial purposes,
gives operational management little direction if they want to drive better
performance,” he insists. Oest reviews the inventory performance for each
class and provides suggestions for corrective action.
Raw material inventory trend not encouraging.
“Most manufacturers have
shown little or no consistent improvement over the past four years,” he ﬁnds.
“As e-commerce tools are developed and put in place, and supply chain pro-
cesses are established and solidiﬁed, we expect signiﬁcant improvement in
this area.”
Currently, the 75th percentile performers have been steady or have had
a slight decline in overall performance across all industry types. This year, he
notes, repetitive manufacturers had the highest raw turns at 14.4. Generally,
all 75th percentile manufacturers turn their raw material inventory about 12
times a year.
WIP inventory gap accelerates between “best” and “low” performers.
WIP is
highly contingent on the manufacturing process and the degree of integra-
tion used by the individual manufacturer. Overall, WIP shows slight im-
provement (5% to 7%) over the past four years. However, the gap between
the performers in the 75th percentile and those in the 25th percentile con-
tinues to widen. 
Currently, the best performers are outpacing their poorer counterparts
by up to 400%. For the recent benchmark, the best of the best WIP per-
formers are in process (39.0 turns) and assembly-to-order (38.0 turns) man-
ufacturing. Generally, 75th percentile performance is in the range of 37 turns
to 40 turns.
Finished goods inventory performance may already have peaked.
Oest ﬁnds that
most high-performance ﬁrms seem to have peaked and have actually indi-
cated a slight drop in performance this year. “We need to keep in mind that
over the past few years manufacturers have had their hands full with every-
thing from Y2K to the increased use of stockout penalties in some supply
chains and seem to have erred on the side of stocking inventory rather than
risking customer problems,” Oest explains.
As more manufacturers adopt speciﬁc pieces of technology that allow
better supply chain integration and adopt vendor managed inventory (VMI)

programs, there should be better performance in this area in the future. Also,
he notes three basic trends that will help increase inventory turns:
• Internet auction sites have opened lines of communication and in-
creased awareness about the availability of suppliers and products.
• Companies now engage in “instant” communication of production
status across the Internet.
• Better supply chain alignment allows manufacturers to take better
care of their critical customer by understanding current stock status and
varying in-house production to actual customer need. 
However, forces are also working against better inventory turns. One
force is that customers now require a greater voice in product options and
diversity. In addition, lot sizes continue to move lower, and overall lead times
continue to shorten.

New inventory benchmarks derived from raw Internal Revenue Service
data have been transformed into a set of ratios commonly used by the ﬁnan-
cial community and inventory managers alike.
Proﬁtable versus unproﬁtable companies.
The data are unique in that one set of
benchmarks includes only those organizations that reported a proﬁt for the
year, whereas the other includes companies that suffered a loss. Splitting the
data highlights performance ratios that distinguish successful from unsuc-
cessful companies within each industry and allows you to see into which
group your company practice falls.

We have excerpted data from the
latest edition of the IRS Corporate Financial Ratios (Schonfeld & Associates,
Inc.; 847-948-8080), and we track more than 90 manufacturing sectors (see
Table II-7.2). The benchmarks’ deﬁnitions and diagnostics include
• Inventory to sales turnover. Above-average inventory sales turnover can
indicate that a ﬁrm is more efﬁcient at managing its inventories than are its

competitors. However, if a company’s sales growth is high at the same time
that its inventory turns are high, it may not be carrying enough inventory to
meet customer demands; in reality, it is losing sales. Low turnover reﬂects
overstocking, optimistic sales forecasts, obsolescence, or the failure to write
off unsalable merchandise. Examine the underlying causes for low inventory
turns. Correcting them can help increase liquidity and working capital.
• Inventory to cost of goods turnover. Computed by dividing cost of sales
and operations by inventory, this is a measure of the value of inventories held
in relation to the costs of production. If the turnover ratio is above average,
a ﬁrm may be an inefﬁcient producer or purchaser of goods. Or it may be
very efﬁcient at managing the ﬂow of raw materials and ﬁnished goods to
customers. Therefore, it is advisable to examine this ratio against the com-
pany’s gross proﬁt margin. The well-managed company has high margins
and high inventory turns.
• Days of inventory. A low days ﬁgure might indicate that a ﬁrm does not
have sufﬁcient resources to meet ﬂuctuations in demand and therefore can-
not ﬁll customer orders on a timely basis. If higher than industry norms, this
benchmark can indicate that the company has poor inventory controls or
problems with sales forecasting problems or that it is carrying obsolete in-
ventory.
• Inventory to cost of sales and operations. This is the inverse of the inven-
tory to cost of goods ratio. If lower than the industry average, it may indi-
cate that the company is more efﬁcient at managing its resources, especially
if its proﬁt margins are above industry norms. However, if it is lower in both
areas, the company may be losing sales and operating inefﬁciently by not
maintaining enough ﬁnished goods inventory to meet demand. Or it may
not have enough raw materials inventory to schedule production efﬁciently.
• Inventory to working capital. This is a measure of liquidity. A low ratio
indicates high liquidity, which creditors prefer. The lower the ratio, the
greater the protection for current creditors.

Which should be the ofﬁcial performance measurement, turns or days

inventory managers. A recent Inventory Reduction Report reader survey ﬁnds

that slightly more than half of all respondents (50.9%) opt for inventory turns
as their metric of choice. The remainder choose days-on-hand (32.3%) or
use both measures routinely (16.8%).
Among inventory management in companies with fewer than 500 em-
ployees, the preferred methodology is clear. By an almost two-to-one ratio,
inventory turns (55.2%) outweighs days-on-hand (29.5%). However, in
larger organizations (see Figure II-7.5) the preference is not as distinct. Here,
inventory turns (42.9%) shades days-on-hand (37.5%), as “both” scores with
an almost solid 20% of the survey respondents.
Many readers shared the “why” and “where” for their preferred perfor-
mance metric. The following excerpts provide some insights and practices
that you may want to consider for your own operation. 
Why the majority prefers inventory turns.
Most of the reasons for using inven-
tory turns carried common responses, ranging from “it’s simple; everybody
understands it,” to,”it’s the preference of our CFO,” to “my bonus is deter-
mined by this metric.” Many cite it as an industry standard and preferred
benchmarking tool. We found these thoughtful comments among the re-
sponses:
• “It is a benchmark our material director as well as ﬁnance can use to
gauge material ﬂow,” cites a material control director at a small manufacturer
of custom electronic devices.
• “We use inventory turns as a gauge against our material handling ex-
pense and indirect labor,” says a warehouse supervisor at a midsize manufac-
turer of construction equipment.
• “Inventory turns are the ongoing measurement as they have value
content for us,” maintains an inventory coach at a midsize contract manu-
facturer.
• “It helps me to be proactive instead of reactive, therefore having on
the shelf what my customer wants to buy,” offers a purchasing agent at a small
maker of parts for restaurant equipment.
• “With our products changing quarterly, inventory turns give us a bet-
ter idea of volatility and viability,” explains a logistics manager at a major pro-
ducer of gaming machines.
• “Our orders are cyclical, as we may ship the same amount in one
week compared to a month, so turns better gauge our performance,” ex-
plains a materials manager at a large personal products maker.

• “Inventory turns give us a better indication of trends for forecast,”
notes a purchasing manager at a supplier of engraved products to promotion
companies.
• “It helps with our slotting of products within the warehouse,” men-
tions a warehouse manager at a large personal care products manufacturer.
Days-on-hand practitioners relate their arguments.
There are also many com-
mon themes for why inventory management prefers the days-on-hand
metric. Many say that it is easier to understand because it relates to stock
availability to meet customer demand. Others claim that it is easier to
communicate to the workforce. For some, it is how corporate management
grades them on working capital. For many, it is a good monitoring device.
Other meaningful responses include the following:
• “Days-on-hand gives us a better picture of where we stand on any
given day, and it enables us to manage our inventory costs much better,” says
an inventory control manager at a major hospital.
• “Our industry has long lead times with many imported SKUs, and
days-on-hand are more easily computed against lead times,” states a vice
president of operations at a midsize maker of ceramic tile.
• “We measure cash-to-cash cycle time in days, so inventory in days
matches this,” reports the operations director at a large producer of data stor-
age and printing consumables. 
• “We’re highly affected by seasonal demand, and we improved our in-
ventory position since focusing on days versus the number of annual turns,”
relates a supply chain manager at a large producer of consumer/industrial
products.
• “Days-on-hand concurs with how our suppliers, who consign raw
materials, measure inventory performance; it also relates more closely to
ﬂow manufacturing concepts,” explains the materials manager at a ﬂexible
packaging manufacturer.
• “Our supply chain operates in days, so it’s easier to compare perfor-
mance,” shares a materials manager at a major producer of medical devices.
Solid core of inventory management professionals ﬁnds both metrics necessary.
Those who indicated that they routinely use both metrics had their own rea-
sons for doing so. This group shares their innovative practices:
598
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

• “Both are required to ascertain the impact on ordering and planning
philosophy [ just-in-time, MRP, DRP], and we use ABC classiﬁcation to
more tightly manage usage rates, lead times, and safety stocks by line item or
SKU,” relays the president of a small manufacturer.
• “We use both to better track inventory movement by plant location
and inventory classiﬁcation,” offers the division purchasing manager at a ma-
jor producer of bronze memorials.
• “We use turns for ﬁnancial reporting and for standard corporate re-
ports; we also use days because it is more understandable for factory person-
nel,” describes a supply chain director at a major manufacturer of tempera-
ture monitoring devices, regulators, and controllers.
• “For raw materials we use days of inventory; for ﬁnished goods, it’s
inventory turns,” reports a distribution manager at a large maker of heating,
ventilating, and air-conditioning equipment.
• “It makes more sense to us to use inventory turns for our MRO,
while we prefer days of supply measures for our raw materials inventory,”
maintains a purchasing team leader at a large pulp and paper manufacturer.
• “We use inventory turnover as a monthly report, but we rely on days-
on-hand as a day-to-day tool,” shares a division materials manager at a mid-
size fuel tank maker for the automotive industry.
• “I look at both in order to accurately measure our inventory perfor-
mance,” asserts a purchasing manager at a small aerospace maintenance fa-
cility.

In the current metrics frenzy, the focus of most discussion and action is on
the “measure of the day.” Unfortunately, this approach generates streams of
short-term data, but not much in long-term solutions. More emphasis
should be given to the philosophy and development of the measurement
process itself. In essence, ask, “What do we want to know, and what are we
going to do when we ﬁnd out about it?”
Industry leaders craft and apply successful metrics.

Operations (Lancaster, Penn.; shwoodward@armstrong.com) believes,
“Without an effective, well-deﬁned, and communicated strategy, it is difﬁ-
cult to set the ‘right’ type of measurement.” Further, he wants the feedback
“quickly enough so the people receiving the metrics can initiate actions to
correct the problems that have been uncovered.”
Alan L. Milliken, CFPIM, CIRM, manager of supply chain projects
at BASF Corporation (Mount Olive, N.J.; millika@basf.com), explains,
“We’re looking for measurement processes, and not just a list of measure-
ments.” To achieve this, he outlines some primary factors that performance
metrics should provide. They should
• Set expectations. “We align our metrics within the organization and
link them to our customers’ and shareholders’ expectations,” he explained at
the Proven Performance Metrics in Logistics Conference (sponsored by the
Institute for International Research; New York). 
• Control. The applied metrics should enable self-evaluation and facili-
tate control of linked performance.
• Identify opportunities. “We look to the metrics to quantify the gaps be-
tween performance and target, which then facilitates the development of
our action plans,” he says.
Create a framework to judge measurements.
“There are many standards by
which we judge performance measures, but the idea is to create the criteria
ﬁrst, before you just throw the individual metrics out there,” maintains
J. Paul Dittmann, vice president of global logistics at Whirlpool Corp. (St.
Joseph, Mich.; john_p_dittmann@email.whirlpool.com). 
One judgment factor he particularly recommends is integration econ-
omy. “That’s really our challenge in the supply chain, because trying to get
all of the functions operating as a process can be difﬁcult,” he notes. See the
sidebar for other criteria. 
Top management participation critical. “It is essential to keep top management
committed to the initiative,” insists Milliken. At BASF, for instance, the fol-
lowing tactics ensure that management’s attention is not diverted from the
metrics initiative:
• Integrate operational metrics into ﬁnancial reporting. “You don’t want to
have one book for operational results and a separate one for ﬁnancials; that
gives the impression that operational results aren’t important,” he argues.
600
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

• Include “Performance Review” time on all staff-level meeting agendas. “We
do not want periodic meetings to discuss performance measurements; it’s the
worst thing in the world to have a separate meeting,” Milliken insists. “By
integrating it into routine staff meetings, it sends a message that this is just as
important as anything else on that group VP’s plate.”
• Incorporate high-level metrics into management’s compensation objectives. “If
it doesn’t hit you in the pocket, it’s just not as important,” he notes. “Since
1998 we’ve been successful in having several non-inancial measures, such as
on-time delivery performance, begin to impact the pay of our group vice
presidents.”
• Include resources for the measurement process as line items in the annual budg-
eting process. “We have shown that measurements consume resources. No
matter how good a job we do, or how much we may restructure, we need
resources. So, it now gets done,” he says. 
Performance measures should reflect corporate strategy.
Before Whirlpool in-
stituted its metrics program, “we took a step back and asked, ‘What’s

Ways to Evaluate Performance Measures
Criterion and description:
Validity captures the events and activities being measured and controls for any
exogenous factors. 
Robustness is interpreted similarly by the users and is comparable across time, 
location, and organization.
Usefulness is readily understandable by the decision maker and provides a
guide for action to be taken.
Integration economy includes all relevant aspects of the process and promotes 
coordination across functions and divisions.
Compatibility means that the beneﬁts of using the metric outweigh the costs of
data collection, analysis, and reporting.
Level of detail provides a sufﬁcient degree of granularity or aggregation for the
user.
Behavioral soundness means that the metric minimizes incentives for counter-
productive acts or game playing and that it is presented in a useful form.

really important to us?’” Dittmann commented. “We found it was four
things.” He listed them as customer service, cost, working capital, and
cycle time.
“If that’s what’s really important to us, certainly our measures have to
capture those elements,” he explains. “We then set up a series of overarch-
ing principles for our supply chain measures. This is what we’re going to
measure by, or evaluate them by.” Among the factors are the following:
• The measures must be common globally. “We want the same supply
chain measures in all regions of the world,” Dittmann describes. “They
would not be used punitively, but to establish a framework from which we
can create a dialogue and share best practices.” 
• They must be interlinked to avoid suboptimization. If a measure for
inventory is established, there would be an offsetting metric on customer
service. “We don’t want to suboptimize one at the expense of the other,” he
explains. 
• Measures must have an external link to economic value-added
(EVA). “We’ve discovered economic value-added is a measure that is the
most direct link to stock price growth,” he explains. “Basically, it combines
into one measure the balance sheet and income statement so you’re not only
looking at one dimension (income) without considering the assets you’ve
had to employ to generate that income,” Dittmann details.
• Metrics must be fully communicated and understood throughout the
organization. Dittmann and the others insist on this. “Unless that’s the case,
it’s all a waste of time,” Dittmann states. “Linkage is assurance that when we
meet our nonﬁnancial goals, our strategic and ﬁnancial goals are met as
well.”

Over the past two decades inventory reduction performance in the U.S.
high-tech sector has been rather impressive. According to the recent study
from Pittiglio Rabin Todd & McGrath (PRTM), a management consulting
ﬁrm for technology-based industries, these industries nearly doubled their
602
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

inventory turns from 2.5 to 4.8. “Some ﬁrms, such as Apple and Dell, now
operate with six and eight days of inventory, about 61 turns and 46 turns, re-
spectively,” observes Jeffrey Berg, PRTM director (Stamford, Conn.; 203-
353-0600).
But progress has stalled during the past ﬁve years.
PRTM manager Rich Fred-
ricksen (Stamford) concludes, “There has been no substantial progress in in-
ventory-turn performance in the past ﬁve years, with the notable exception
of European companies.” While the U.S. technology sector’s 4.8 inventory
turns (the latest available data) are nearly a quarter-turn improvement from
the prior year, “the sector has otherwise shown ﬂat performance since 1993,”
he observes in PRTM’s Insight (see Figure II-7.6). The Japanese sector has
followed a very similar trend: again, a nearly quarter-turn improvement
year-to-year, but a ﬂat performance since 1994.
Recent U.S. performance in asset turnover is alarming.
The U.S. high-tech sec-
tor managed 1.2 turns in 1993 (see Figure II-7.7) and has been in decline
ever since. “This is in both absolute terms and relative to Europe,” Fredrick-
sen notes. “Continued improvements in European inventory management,
such as a 20 day reduction in cash-to-cash cycle time [see Figure II-7.8] since
1993, demonstrates an increasing awareness of the effects of inventory per-
formance on overall proﬁtability.” Figure II-7.9 reports changes in inventory
as a proportion of revenue.

Sector-by-Sector Analysis
Fredricksen highlights four speciﬁc segments to provide additional insight
into their supply chain and inventory performance. The analysis also in-
cludes a number of lessons to be learned.
Computer sector continues impressive progress.
This sector’s impressive business
growth was accompanied by continued improvement in the sector’s inven-
tory management. Inventory turns increased to 7.6, “capping ﬁve years of
steady gains,” he notes. Inventory as a percentage of revenue also declined
for the ﬁfth straight year, from 13% to 7.6%.
Europe’s computer sector experienced a year of negative growth. How-
ever, it responded with improvements in inventory turns, asset turnover, in-
ventory as a percentage of revenue, and cash-to-cash cycle time. The com-
munity reported improvements in cash-to-cash cycle time (112.9 to 90.3
days) and inventory turns (5.3 to 6.9).
Fredricksen observes, “The segment’s leadership in inventory per-
formance can be attributed to the speed of price erosion and to short prod-
uct life cycles. Inventory has a large impact on costs of goods sold and,
therefore, must be closely managed to ensure profitability. Industry-wide
improvements in supplier management initiatives, such as consumption-
based replenishment and pure JIT methodologies, have driven this perfor-
mance.”
Aerospace and defense inventory performance suffers through sector’s restructuring.
The U.S. aerospace and defense sector was unable to combine its revenue
growth with substantial improvements in inventory management. Inventory
turns did increase (from 4.4 to 4.8), and inventory as a percentage of revenue
did decrease (15.2% to 14.9%). However, the sector’s inventory performance
did not otherwise improve.
In Europe, the sector had similar results. Inventory turns increased
(2.1 to 2.2), but all other measures remained flat. Fredricksen notes, “A
high level of mergers and consolidations has focused the industry on
defining or reconfiguring supply chains as opposed to improving supply
chain performance. Until the industry finishes its restructuring, there is
little reason to expect significant improvement in overall inventory per-
formance.”
Telecommunications sets the pace for delaying inventory ownership.
The U.S.
telecommunications industry had a strong revenue increase (15.7%) over

earlier near-zero growth. It also continued its steady improvement in in-
ventory as a percentage of revenue (from 11.7% to 11.3%). 
Cash-to-cash cycle time improved from 146.2 days to 144.2 days. How-
ever, it is noteworthy that the industry’s annual average over the ﬁve-year pe-
riod was 140.6 days.
Inventory turns reached 4.4, up from 4.0 and close to the ﬁve-year high
of 4.5. Assets turns slid to a ﬁve-year low, as the segment continues to invest
in infrastructure and new technology.
Europe’s telecommunications sector broke out of its lethargic growth
with an impressive 15.2% revenue improvement. This growth saw inventory
turns increase from 3.3 to 3.9 and cash-to-cash cycle time slide from 171.1
to 151.2 days. However, asset turns remained level (1.1).
Fredricksen states, “Telecommunications has increased its use of con-
tract manufacturing and electronic component parts suppliers, causing in-
ventory ownership to be delayed as much as possible and enhancing inven-
tory performance of the industry. “The low and medium range of the
segment is becoming more commodity-like and modular. This has increased
inventory commonality and reduced associated costs.
Pharmaceuticals and chemicals focus on better supply chain performance.
The U.S.
pharmaceuticals and chemicals sector continued its solid revenue growth
performance. The sector improved its inventory turns (3.2 to 3.8). It re-
duced its cash-to-cash cycle (159.1 to 132.3 days) to a ﬁve-year best, from a
ﬁve-year high in one year. The sector also improved its inventory as a per-
centage of revenue performance in each of the ﬁve years, moving from
14.6% to 12.5%. However, the sector’s high capital requirements pushed
down asset turns to 0.9 last year.
Fredricksen explains, “High margins and high capital requirements have
traditionally focused this industry on inventory supply availability. At these
high margins, the impact of a stockout outweighs major initiatives to im-
prove inventory performance to date. However, the improved performance
could indicate an emerging awareness of the need to focus on improving
supply chain performance.”

they abandoned in favor of decreasing time to implement their ERP sys-
tems.”
When these implementations are behind them, he foresees “the typical
company in the PRTM inventory study being able to achieve 5.0 inventory
turns within the next two years,” while more will achieve the present in-
ventory turns posted by Dell and Apple.

Rules for developing a safety stock policy.
“Most companies have safety stock;
however, few have a safety stock policy,” maintains Robert A. Abair, CPIM,
president, Robert Abair Associates, Inc. (Northboro, Mass.). A formal safety
stock philosophy is needed for all major components and product lines, he
advised at a recent American Production and Inventory Control Society
(APICS) Annual International Conference (www.apics.org). Following is an
example of safety stock business rules that he proposed: A items, 2 weeks
safety stock; B items, 4 to 6 weeks safety stock; and C items, 10+ weeks
safety stock. “Safety stock should be primarily established based on customer
demand instability as well as purchasing and manufacturing reliability and
response times,” Abair adds. Additional factors that also should be consid-
ered when setting safety stock levels include the parent item’s inventory class
(ABC); criticality of end use; location of customer; ease of manufacturing;
warehouse space; safety/hazardous material; design of the product life; and
spare parts usage (warranty work, repair).
Electronic transactions with public warehouses to soar.
“To achieve connectivity,
those business partners who store, transport, label, sort and provide a wide
variety of value-added services must be wired into the connectivity web,”
says Bernard J. La Londe of the Ohio State University (Columbus, Ohio;
Lalonde.3@osu.edu) and Terrance Pohlen of the University of North Florida
(Jacksonville, Fla.; Tpohlen@unf.edu). According to a poll of Council of Lo-
gistics Management (CLM) members (The Ohio State University 2000 Survey of
608

Career Patterns in Logistics) respondents say that almost 70% of the transactions
between their ﬁrm and its third-party warehouse partners will be electronic
(50% via the Internet, 18% through electronic data interchange) in 2004.
On declaring a kanban card amnesty day.
Apparently there is a problem con-
cerning the discipline, or lack of it, in handling kanban cards, states the Lean
Manufacturing Advisor. Not realizing how important the cards are in the re-
plenishment system, employees tend to overlook, misplace, or forget about
them. As part of a retraining effort, organizations are holding kanban card
amnesty days. No punishment is involved, but employees are encouraged to
deposit the “misplaced” cards in a box placed in a break room, cafeteria, or
an out-of-the-way area in the shop.
Supply-Chain Council announces release of SCOR Version 4.0.
A signiﬁcant
change in this new release is the inclusion of Return as a Level 1 process.
The expansion to include return activities will extend the scope of the model
into the area of postdelivery customer support. Version 4.0 does not contain
the process elements below Level 1 for Return. The Council plans to vali-
date Level 2 and 3 processes, the associated metrics, best practices, and fea-
tures and document these results in Version 5.0. Version 4.0 (www.
supplychain.org) also completes the changes in the area of services and ma-
jor revisions to the Enable elements (formerly Infrastructure).
Ten ways to reduce inventory costs.
Consulting ﬁrm Herbert W. Davis (Fort
Lee, N.J.; www.hwdco.com) recommends looking at the following options:
(1) Identify obsolete inventory, sell it, and take steps to avoid making more;
(2) identify slow-moving inventory and centralize it to one or two locations;
(3) identify obsolete inventory; (4) periodically conduct a formal slotting
analysis to save labor and space costs of carrying inventory; (5) adjust safety
stock levels often to support ﬁll rates by class of products; (6) audit and up-
date lead times, lot sizes, and economic order quantities (EOQs) in your in-
ventory planning system; (7) improve returns processing to reclaim or dis-
pose of returned merchandise as soon as possible; (8) implement a plant
shipping option to bypass the warehouse network where economical; (9)
store more common product in bulk, boxing and labeling at the distribution
center (DC) just prior to shipment; and (10) conduct a geographic analysis
of sales by item to focus on managing regional and seasonal items.
Look before leaping to an Internet hosting provider.
A primary question that
inventory managers should ask while considering an Internet hosting
New Inventory Management Products, Services, and Ideas
609

solution/provider is whether the host is an expert in your business and ap-
plication. “There are applications that do not warrant critical consideration,
such as accounting, because they are dictated by a standard set of operating
principles,” offers Luc Ringuette, CEO of HotStatus Enterprises, Inc. (Mis-
sion Viejo, Calif.; 95926luc-ringuette@msn.com). Applications such as in-
ventory control systems or warehouse management systems (WMSs) are a
different matter, however. The reason is that there are no generally accepted
operational principles, no standard rule for doing the operation, and every-
one has their own unique method, he detailed at a recent CLM Annual
Conference. Therefore, he advises, “It is important that you and the host
provider match philosophies. So, get to know the people you’re going to be
working with, and make sure they have expertise in your speciﬁc application
and business.”
IristaVision releases a Web-based application that provides users a consolidated view
of inventory.
IristaVision (irista; Milwaukee; www.irista.com) provides
supply chain visibility over the fulﬁllment network by using open standards-
based extensible markup language (XML). The Web-based application pro-
vides a consolidated view of inventory, orders, and shipments moving be-
tween suppliers, inventory storage locations, partners, and customers. Its
capabilities include a rules-based order parsing/sourcing logic that provides
customer service from the most cost-effective locations.

10 guiding principles for logistics outsourcing.
“Adherence to 10 basic rules will
go a long way toward ensuring a successful and mutually beneﬁcial out-
sourcing relationship,” Clifford F. Lynch, executive vice president of Conti-
nental Group (Memphis, Tenn.; clifﬂ@continental-trafﬁc.com) counseled
at the CLM Annual Conference titled redeﬁninglogistics.com. Lynch, au-
thor of the widely acclaimed Logistics Outsourcing: A Management Guide, lists
the following rules: (1) Develop a strategy for outsourcing; (2) establish a rig-
orous provider selection process; (3) clearly deﬁne your expectations; (4) de-
velop a good contract; (5) establish sound policies and procedures; (6) iden-
tify and avoid potential friction points; (7) communicate effectively with
your logistics provider; (8) measure performance and communicate results;
(9) motivate and reward providers, and (10) be a good partner. The latest re-
search book is available from the Council of Logistics Management, 2805

Users of automatic replenishment generally meeting their goals.
Users of auto-
matic replenishment programs, on a scale of one (not effective) to seven
(extremely effective), give high marks for achieving improved customer
service (5.47), fewer stockouts (5.33), and improved reliability of deliv-
eries (5.15). According to Patricia J. Daugherty of the University of Ok-
lahoma (Norman; pdaugher@ou.edu), moderate ratings were given to
achieving faster inventory turns (4.94), reducing inventory (4.79), and re-
ducing overstocks (4.77). Receiving the lowest ratings are reducing costs
(4.56), handling (4.50), product damage (4.46), and discounting (3.96). “I
would be surprised if the survey respondents told me they did a great job
reducing cost and of improving customer service,” she expressed at the
CLM Annual Conference. “You’re not going to accomplish both instan-
taneously.” 
Kewill brings additional enterprise resource planning (ERP) content to Kewill.Net.
Kewill Systems PLC (Marlborough, Mass.; www.kewill.com) has extended
the functionality of its Kewill.Net business portal with Kewill.View. This so-
lution provides MAX and JobBOSS ERP users with on-line supply chain

visibility from the manufacturing status of orders and stock to the physical de-
livery of goods. This added visibility enables Kewill’s small- and medium-size
enterprise customer base to increase operational efﬁciency and provide more
timely and reliable order fulﬁllment without investment in e-commerce in-
frastructure such as ﬁrewalls and other complex security mechanisms. 
The one-minute quiz to a federal tax deduction.

tory availability via the Internet. They can be instantly notiﬁed when a se-
lected fulﬁllment event does or does not happen, eliminating safety stocks
and excess inventory caused by lack of real-time inventory and order infor-
mation.
Interlink Technologies announces WHSe-LINK Release 4.0.

Sustainable competitive advantage is a mirage.
“Today’s businesses must invest
in technology and attitudes that let them change their business models
within six months” states AMR Research (Boston; www.amrresearch.com)
in an advisory. They developed a list of areas that companies need to evalu-
ate as e-business tools take hold of their industry. Of interest to Inventory Re-
duction Report readers are the following: 
New Inventory Management Products, Services, and Ideas
613

1. Sales channels. New mechanisms for getting product to market de-
mand that companies reevaluate how sales channels are managed, particu-
larly third-party distribution channels. 
2. Quick payback. Currently important are the speed with which an ap-
plication can start paying beneﬁts and how much of the company, cus-
tomers, and suppliers the application handles or allows a user to monitor. A
number of leading-edge applications are designed to be available only as
Web-based services. 
3. Outsourcing. The notion of outsourcing entire business processes
with the in-house staffs that support them is a reality. Some previously un-
affordable but very strategic business functions, such as specialized supply
chain and logistics planning, are now available on a rental basis.
Space-age ID systems, or bar codes with an attitude.
They are permanent,
scannable, and sometimes invisible. They are matrix symbols, ﬁrst studied
for use by NASA to help track space shuttle components. The matrix sym-
bol is capable of storing 100 times as much information as a bar code can, in
the same amount of space. The symbol is a small, square-shaped mark re-
sembling a checkerboard. Unlike a bar code, which is scanned using a laser
beam, the symbol is captured by a charged-coupled device, a solid-state chip
that turns light into electric signals. NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center
formed an alliance with the developer of the Data Matrix symbol, CiMatrix
(Canton, Mass.), to develop commercial applications for NASA’s marking
technologies. CiMatrix’s Symbology Research Center has applied readable
symbols on more than 80 materials, including metal, plastics, glass, paper,
fabric, and ceramics. The technology is the method of choice for direct-part
marking in automotive, health, semiconductor, aircraft, and electronic in-
dustries. NASA is soliciting partners to develop handheld devices to read
these invisible markings.

What does that inventory-turn benchmark really mean?
If a ﬁrm achieves a level
of turnover that falls short of competitive benchmarks, it does not necessar-
ily mean that the ﬁrm should work feverishly to reduce inventory, assures a
research report titled Warehouse Inventory Turnover (Warehousing Education
and Research Council; Oak Brook, Ill.; www.werc.org). Before manage-
ment takes action after comparing inventory turns, “it is imperative that they
examine all the underlying factors correlated to the inventory turnover re-
sults,” advises the report’s author, Thomas W. Speh, director of the Ware-
housing Research Center at Miami University (Oxford, Ohio; spehtw@
muohio.edu). “Turns should always be evaluated in light of important cus-
tomer requirements,” he recommends.
Supply chains must become more compressed.
One ﬁnding from an executive
roundtable facilitated by Tompkins Associates is that as customers expect
greater speed, supply chains must become more compressed and ﬂexible.
Main concerns include ﬁnding suitable software, integrating third-party in-
formation, invoicing via the Internet, and working with overseas suppliers.
Supply chain simulation software analyzes inventory strategies.
SimChain (Micro-
Analytics; Arlington, Va.; www.bestroutes.com is the North American dis-
tributor) evaluates strategic and tactical aspects of entire supply chains, as it
analyzes logistics networks structures, inventory strategies, control policies,
and ﬂuctuations in material ﬂows and demand. Interactive map and automatic
updating features allow users to see the results of adjustments in the model. 
Picking rules to change for e-commerce.
“Companies that do not have an ‘each’
picking environment, and only usually pick cases or full pallets, will see
a dramatic impact when picking for e-commerce,” maintains Michael
Wohlwend, director of strategic alliances at Catalyst International, Inc. (Mil-
waukee; mwohlwend@catalystwms.com). He advises that you take the
“eaches” and “put them off in a separate area and pick only eaches from
there.” At Distribution/Computer Seminar (C. S. Report, Inc.; Uwchland,
Pa; www.logistar.com), he recommended initially storing three days of A
(top 20% of your SKUs) items, three weeks of B items, and three months of
C items when setting up the “each” pick area, to minimize replenishment.
Take ownership of your new software.
“As we were implementing our MRP II
[manufacturing resource planning] systems, we were told by responsible
software vendors and consultants that it was critical that we take ownership

of our systems,” maintains Robert E. Beecy Jr., CFPIM, CIRM, CPM, sen-
ior director of planning and customer requirements at Dan River Apparel
Fabrics. “We took that message seriously, but for some reason we have for-
gotten that lesson with supply chain management software and take on le-
gions of outside people who are responsible for all facets of the new system,”
he explained at a recent Annual APICS International Conference. “When
these individuals ﬁnally go away, all your expertise leaves with them,” he
warns. “Make sure you have persons within your organization who take on
the new software and are not afraid of the client-server attributes that make
up the backbone of these systems,” Beecy strongly advises.
Oliver Wight announces 90-day sales and operations planning (S&OP) program.
Drawing on its experience, Oliver Wight (New London, N.H.; 800-258-
3862; info@ollie.com; www.ollie.com) has developed a program to jump-
start a S&OP program that will generate results within 90 days. Clients also
receive the Oliver Wight S&OP Template software tool.
When outsourcing, do not give up the brain trust.
“We ﬁnd it very important
for us to keep the people who are going to make the strategic decisions on
our strategic direction and not to outsource these pieces,” explains Eileen
Long, vice president and general manager of service design operations at
Global Network Services, Unisys (Blue Bell, Pa.; eileen.long@unisys.com).
“We’re asked constantly by high-tech companies to do things like materials
planning for them, to take total control of their networks.” At INTERLOG
(Worldwide Business Research; New York; www.wbresearch.com) she ex-
pressed, “I personally believe this is wrong, for any company to allow the
strategic area of their business to be outsourced. If you take and outsource
your brain trust, you’re taking a large risk,” she emphasizes.
Manhattan Associates releases PkMS 2000R1.
The new release of the PkMS

query order and inventory status via Web browser over the Internet. E-mail
notiﬁcation has also been integrated. 
Design the warehouse for fast inventory turns.
Authority Kenneth B. Acker-
man, president of the K. B. Ackerman Company (Columbus, Ohio; ken-
ackerman@ameritech.net) notes that key goals in warehousing today are to
reduce order cycle time and operate at higher inventory velocity. “For a
cross-dock or fast-turn operation, receiving and shipping doors should be
adjacent to each other,” he recommends in the Journal of Business Logistics.
“Doors one through eight might be used for receiving in the morning and
for shipping in the afternoon, or the odd- numbered doors used for receiv-
ing and the even-numbered for shipping,” he advises. “Such an arrangement
will facilitate cross docking by allowing goods that come in one door to go
out through an adjacent door. The concept of dedicated doors for receiving
or shipping is obsolete,” Ackerman declares.
Business Intelligence Portal for e-intelliprise.
American Software (Atlanta, Ga.;
www.amsoftware.com) announced its fully Web-based ERP solution now
includes a customizable Business Intelligence Portal that provides secured
role-based views of key performance indicators (KPIs). The portal is a
knowledge management system throughout the supply chain, measuring
KPIs versus yearly, monthly, or daily goals and identifying trends that could
affect overall company strategy. The Business Intelligence Portal is accessed
via the Internet and provides a proactive management tool to identify and
analyze performance variants. The user can drill down to necessary detail to
analyze individual data as compared to speciﬁc goals on a graphic screen.
WebPLAN releases e-business demand management solution.
DemandIT (web-
PLAN Inc.; Kanata, Ontario; www.webplan.com), a Web-based, collabora-

market conditions more accurately and proactively formulate strategic plans
to prepare for them. DemandIT integrates data from multiple, disparate
sources into a single model. Another feature of the demand management so-
lution is webPLAN’s unique Flex technology that automatically makes ad-
justments for forecast error. 
Cost of logistics increases to 7.34% of sales revenue.
Herbert W. Davis and
Company (Fort Lee, N.J.; www.hwdco.com) found in their latest survey
that the cost of logistics (transportation, warehousing, order entry/customer
New Inventory Management Products, Services, and Ideas
617

service, administration, and inventory carrying cost) rose 2.21% in 1999
compared to a reduction of 4.30% in 1998. Since 1980, the report explains,
“Costs for the three principal cost elements (transportation, warehousing,
and inventory) have been changing relative to each other.” The 1999 study
shows much higher costs for warehousing (1.84% of sales). Transportation
(3.24%) and inventory carrying cost (1.52%) both declined. “This shift
points to the need for reconﬁguring the logistics system, as optimum ware-
house conﬁguration occurs when warehousing and inventory costs are
about equal to transportation,” it concludes. 
Enhanced collaboration a feature of XA Release 6.0.
MAPICS, Inc. (Al-
pharetta, Ga.; www.mapics.com), announced the release of XA 6.0, the lat-
est version of its AS/400 Extended Enterprise Application. The release of-
fers manufacturers additional Internet functionality to help them collaborate
more efﬁciently with partners in their supply chain. XA Release 6.0 includes
enhancements to the product’s FoundationWeRX family of tools, one of
which is materials management, a Client Architecture application that
streamlines the warehouse data and physical inventory/cycle counting busi-
ness processes. It improves the productivity and accuracy of receipt of ma-
terials and services through inspection, stocking, vendor returns, and debit
memos, while minimizing data entry on receipt transactions and ensuring
that receipts are expedited immediately.
Focus to continue on maintenance of logistics relationships despite Internet.
“In
business-to-business e-commerce, we expect to see even stronger and
deeper relationships as suppliers, transportation carriers, and logistics service
providers become Web-enabled,” maintains Robert V. Delaney, vice presi-
dent of Cass Information Systems (Brighton, Mo.; cass@cassinfo.com). “We
believe that companies will continue to try to work with fewer suppliers and
service providers, not more,” he offered in his Annual State of Logistics Report.
Radcliffe Systems launches new warehousing information portal.
Warehouse
managers and others can register to access warehousing information that is

Survey ﬁnds S&OP widely adopted, but results disappointing.
More than three-
fourths of surveyed companies have adopted S&OP, according to Oliver

Wight (New London, N.H.). However, only 27% judge it to be very effec-
tive. Although 87% say that new product introductions are included in their
S&OP process, only 70% use it for other projects and initiatives. About half
use formal demand and supply planning meetings as a part of their S&OP
processes. Survey results are available from www.ollie.com or by calling
800-258-3862. 
Kewill introduces MAX Data Collection.
MAX Data Collection (Kewill Sys-

Guidelines to improve inventory record accuracy.
Burton A. Schaffer, manag-
ing principal at Tompkins Associates Inc. (Allentown, Pa.; bschaffer@
tompkinsinc.com) recommends (1) establishing a climate of high expecta-
tions; (2) measuring record accuracy frequently; (3) reporting results for all
to see; (4) using accuracy checks to search for and correct causes of errors;
and (5) rewarding improvements and maintenance of high levels of perfor-
mance. Further, at Distribution/Computer Seminar (C. S. Report Inc.;
Uwchland, Pa.; www.logistar.com) he advised establishing formal standard
operating procedures for inventory transactions so that all know how infor-
mation is to be communicated, who is to initiate communication, from
whom and to whom information should ﬂow, and when information ﬂow
is expected to take place.
There is no such thing as “virtual” inventory.
In a new study (Demystifying
e-Fulﬁllment), analyst Chris J. Newton of AMR Research (Boston; www.
amrresearch.com) explains, “Until we can make physical items materialize
out of thin air, there will always be a need to store goods to meet demand.”
While Internet retailers may impress Wall Street and their venture capital in-
vestors by “retreating beyond the physical world, the truth is that there is
nothing virtual about e-fulﬁllment,” he declares. “The Internet has enabled
information about products to move at the speed of light, but the products
themselves still need to be handled physically,” Newton maintains. “Prod-
ucts require warehouse space; people for picking, packing, shipping; and de-
livery vehicles for transport. Pulling together an efﬁcient fulﬁllment process
does not happen by chance.”

QAD enterprise applications to feature kanban sizing, yield calculation.
QAD
(Carpinteria, Calif.; www.qad.com) announced that its customer-driven
Electronics and Industrial Development Group (EIDG) will focus efforts on
creating industry-speciﬁc and e-business functionality into QAD applica-
tions. The next release of QAD enterprise applications, available later this
year, will feature Internet-enabled electronics and industrial applications
with kanban sizing and calculation of yield. These applications will stream-
line inventory and parts planning. Future EIDG projects include enhance-
ments for e-commerce, available-to-promise enforcement, ﬂow manufac-
turing with kanban, and reserved inventory in multinational integrated
supply chains. The EIDG consists of QAD product development executives
and representatives from leading companies across the electronics and in-
dustrial sectors.
Avoiding the pitfalls of WMS selection.
“Be wary of the WMS vendor who
attempts to convince you to adjust your operations to ﬁt its software solu-
tion,” advises Sedlak Management Consultants, Inc. (Richﬁeld, Ohio;
www.jasedlak.com). A software solution is only valuable if it addresses your
business needs, they remind. “Don’t select software that will require major
modiﬁcations, as changes tend to be costly, risky, and time-consuming,” they
warn. The advisory also notes, “Make no assumptions about software func-
tionality. Make sure your interpretation of required functionality matches
the vendor’s interpretation.” The management consultant ﬁrm recommends

Excess, obsolete inventory can be a source for a federal tax deduction.
Corpora-
tions can earn a federal income tax deduction by donating their excess,
nonmoving inventory to charity, according to the National Association for
the Exchange of Industrial Resources (NAEIR). The deduction is available
under Section 170 (e)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. A free guide
is available that includes step-by-step instructions on the donation process,
plus a formula for calculating a company’s potential tax savings. The guide
is available from NAEIR, 560 McClure Street, Galesburg, IL 61401; 800-
289-4551; fax, 309-343-0862; www.naeir.org; jez@naeir.com.
What’s that inventory really costing you?
“To determine your cost to carry in-
ventory, meet with ﬁnance and agree on your company’s annual costs, as a
percentage of inventory dollars, for your critical factors,” advises Mary Lu
620
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Harding, CPM, CPIM, principal at Harding & Associates (Lincoln, Vt.;
Harding@Sover.Net). Among the factors she includes in calculating the in-
ventory carrying costs are (1) the cost of money, (2) the cost of taxes and in-
surance, (3) occupancy cost of the facility (per square foot), (4) obsolescence
reserve. In addition, at a recent National Association of Purchasing Man-
agement (NAPM) Annual International Purchasing Conference, she ex-
plained, “Calculate or estimate costs associated with personnel, capital equip-
ment, and secondary quality costs [how often material is reinspected after
being stored].” Also, estimate the costs associated with the maintenance of
computers and databases. “Estimate what percentage of that is devoted to in-
ventory [the largest and most active database], and include both hardware
and software costs,” Harding advises.

Supply Chain Synthesis—a step beyond supply chain management.
No Bound-
aries: Moving Beyond Supply Chain Management introduces and explains
Supply Chain Synthesis as an environment in which there are no link-
optimizing boundaries. “The synthesis melts the links of the chain into a
continuous ﬂow that is focused not on a particular link, but on the ultimate
customer,” explains author James A. Tompkins, president and founder of
Tompkins Associates (Raleigh, N.C.; www.tompkinsinc.com). The book
describes opportunities and the eight core competencies of Supply Chain
Synthesis and provides instructions on how to design a supply chain with-
out boundaries. Price $24.95. Contact Tompkins Client Relations at 800-

cho Santa Margarita, Calif.; www.dispensesource.com) introduces its Web-
based automated inventory cabinet that contains ofﬁce supplies and con-
sumable inventory. Users enter a password to gain access to the point-of-use
system and remove their items. Analytical and ﬁnancial reports can be
viewed online or interfaced with ERP system. Managers can access individ-
ual, department, and branch usage information.
Performance measures are essential for small companies, too.
“Performance mea-
sures are often thought of as a nuisance or a burden,” charges Glenn W. Mal-
strom, CFPIM, materials manager at Trans/Air Manufacturing (Red Lion,
Pa.; GCMalstrom@aol.com). “This view is both shortsighted and poten-
tially damaging.” In fact, the Trans/Air Value Chain performance measure-
ments include forecasting accuracy, inventory turnover, on-time delivery,
warranty response time, installation quality, and manufacturing productiv-
ity. “Our performance measures identify trends, foster teamwork, and are
easy to understand,” he revealed at Congress for Progress, sponsored by the
Mid-Atlantic chapters of APICS. 
Radcliffe Systems releases WMS ROC v8.02.
Improvements have been
made in ROC version 8.02 that increase the usability of the desktop pro-
gram. For example, Pick Planning and Load Planning have been simpliﬁed
through the reduction of multiple screens. In v8.02 users have several tabbed
options on one screen. A major enhancement, Task Prioritizing, assigns and
prioritizes tasks or work sets to individual employees. Task Interleaving al-
lows the employee to switch between linked tasks, saving travel time in the
warehouse. Work Order Functions, a third enhancement, is designed to

Obtaining benchmarks via the Internet.
Manufacturers wanting to know how
their performance measures up to their peers can now do so in just minutes
using a free ﬁnancial benchmarking service, BenchmarkReport.com (www.
BenchmarkReport.com). It enables manufacturers to compare their ﬁnan-
cial performance against a relevant peer group, in real time on the Web, as
often as they would like. Among the key performance measures are inven-
tory turns and operating, liquidity and leverage ratios. The limited number
of ﬁnancial data points are compared against that company’s peer group as
determined by Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC) codes and annual
revenue. The site is cosponsored by Fourth Shift Corp. (www.fs.com) and
Grant Thornton (www.grantthornton.com).

WMS systems that are within your budget.
“There’s a perception among
warehouse managers that cutting-edge WMS systems are beyond their reach
economically,” maintains Carl Brewer, president of Integrated Warehousing
Solutions (Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.; www.iws-irms.com). “That’s bunk,” he
commented at a press conference at Distribution/Computer Expo. “Appli-
cation Service Providers, or ASPs, virtually eliminate the ﬁnancial and tech-
nological barriers that appear so daunting. Providers, such as our company,
keep their proprietary WMS software on their own host servers, then sell
access to individual companies on a pennies-per-transaction basis,” he ex-
plains. The warehouse is able to access leading-edge applications through
the Internet without an intensive capital commitment, and the cost-per-
transaction can be built into the contracts signed with their shipper cus-
tomers.

With inventory it really is all about service and investment.
“The most impor-
tant aspects of any inventory are the service it provides and the capital it re-
quires,” argues Terrell J. Harris, managing partner, Chicago Consulting (Chi-
cago; 312-346-5080; tjharrisl@aol.com). “As inventory managers, I can’t
imagine anything more important to work on than service and capital, as
these two elements are inexplicably linked to one another,” he expressed at
the CLM Annual Conference. “It almost doesn’t matter to say ‘we provide
98% service.’ What does matter is 98% service and $5 million worth of in-
ventory.” Service and capital are linked to one another very closely, and they
need to be managed together, according to Harris.

How inventory managers can assist ﬁnancial auditors.
The auditor’s work re-
volves around certain ﬁnancial statement assertions (existence or occur-
rence, completeness, rights and obligations, and valuations or allocations).
For inventory, it means that the inventory as reported in the ﬁnancial state-
ments exists and is complete. Hence the importance of the annual year-end
inventory observation by the auditors, maintains Steve Erickson, CPA, part-
ner at Whittlesey and Hadley (Hartford, Conn.). Inventory managers can
smooth the audit process, he advises in the APICS Small Manufacturing SIG
Quarterly, by following just three steps. First, communicate. “Within two
weeks of the observation day, you should have all of the details ﬁrmed and
reconﬁrmed with your auditors,” he suggests. Next, clean up all inventory
areas. Shipping and receiving areas should have minimal inventory. Any-
thing not to be counted must be segregated from that which will be
counted. Backup for why items are not counted should be readily available.
Third, provide documentation. “Have a map of your shop ﬂoor available,
and a written strategy for controlling each of the areas where inventory or
628
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

WIP is located and written instructions for the counters. Also, he recom-
mends making copies of the shipping and receiving records for the previous
ﬁve days leading up to the physical inventory for the auditor’s records.

What CPFR is all about, via the Web.
Syncra Systems, Inc. (Cambridge,

forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR) adoption. They have recently added
a series of overviews that explain the key aspects of CPFR. The latest, by

sourcing, manufacturing, and delivering products and yields results on a
quarterly basis.
CPFR raises the bar beyond VMI-style collaboration.
Greg Girard, senior ana-
lyst at AMR Research (Boston; ggirard@amrresearch.com) notes, “Collab-
orative planning, forecasting, and replenishment is the only approach that
includes both demand-side and supply-side activities within a single frame-
work.” Although it is still more of a “direction than a deﬁnitive standard
practice, it is approaching the point of accelerating market adoption,” he
writes in How Can We Collaborate? Let Me Count the Ways, a recent AMR
Research report. For this to occur, Girard observes, “Manufacturers and re-
tailers ﬁrst need to change the scope and rules of collaboration and extend
the technology footprint of the applications and technologies they use to
collaborate.” Both have found CPFR programs difﬁcult to adopt, he ac-
knowledges. “They take more commitment from both parties, require each
to divulge more information, and are harder to set up in required changes in
information systems, business processes, and corporate culture.” However,
“CPFR pilots now justify their efforts.”
Sixty minutes to size up a warehouse.
If you have only 60 minutes to evalu-
ate a warehouse, the ﬁrst priority is to look at housekeeping, advises Ken-
neth B. Ackerman, president of the K. B. Ackerman Company (Columbus,
Ohio; 614-488-3165). “If trash is found on the ﬂoor, ask who retrieves it
and disposes of it. If damage is found, ﬁnd out about procedures for dealing
with it,” he offers in Warehousing Proﬁtably: A Manager’s Guide. Another
pointer for the one-hour evaluation is that space utilization is another indi-
cator of management. “Always look up,” he notes. See how much of the
practical pile height is actually in use. Find out whether racking systems are
designed to use all of the available space and whether all lift trucks have masts
high enough to reach the highest rack position. Also, look at the locator sys-
tem and see if it works.
When suppliers should manage the inventory in a supply chain.
Educator/con-
sultant Lowell M. Hoffman of Global Sourcing Solutions (Chapel Hill,
N.C.; lmhglobal@compuserve.com) tells Inventory Reduction Report, “The
supply chain process should be mapped to fully understand where critical
management decisions can best be made to achieve jointly developed ob-
jectives.” An integrated set of performance measures can then be established,
and the best supply chain member, who should be managing and reporting
630
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

success, can be selected. As an example, he offers, “In a long-lead-time raw
material, it is the supplier that should manage the entire supply chain, in-
cluding the customer’s inventory and in-plant service levels. Data should be
fed to the supplier for monthly tracking and reporting of supply chain in-
ventory turns, service, and quality metrics.” 
Emerging trends for the new “successful” warehouse.
“Warehouses will remain
vital in supply chain synthesis,” says Brian Hudock, managing principal at
Tompkins Associates (Raleigh, N.C.). For future success they must (1) fo-
cus on the customer, (2) compress operations and time, (3) introduce contin-
uous ﬂow, (4) begin cross docking, (5) use electronic transactions, (6) offer
customized warehousing, (7) advocate third-party warehousing, (8) adapt to
incredible shrinking order, (9) automate, and (10) consider the human ele-
ment.

Fortune 500 companies have not outsourced warehouse and inventory man-
agement functions that are not parts of their core competencies.”
New survey ﬁnds applications of ﬂow manufacturing can double inventory turns.
Be-
coming Demand Driven: The Foundation for e-Business Leadership, a new market
research report, indicates that “while signiﬁcant progress has been made in
fulﬁllment practices, even the best-in-class market leaders are a long way from
having the right strategies in place for e-business success.” The study covers
the four phases of becoming demand driven, from plant-focused strategies,
such as lean and ﬂow manufacturing and the use of advanced planning and
scheduling (APS), to extending these strategies to the virtual enterprise of
supply chain trading partners. Among the ﬁndings were that those primarily
using APS have better success with market growth and achieving number-
one or number-two positions. The report also includes ﬁrst pass yields and
reveals increasing capacity 20% to 30% with the same resources and perfect
order fulﬁllment. Flow practitioners have superior results in bringing cycle
items within order lead times and producing to daily demand rates; they also
saw productivity improvements of 10% to 20%, greater cash ﬂow, higher
gross margins,production cycle times reduced by 50%, and doubling inven-
tory turns. Information: Industry Directions, Inc., 6 Broad Street, New-

Inventory managers must remain knowledgeable and conversant about new technol-
ogy.
Consultant/educator Gary A. Landis, president of G. A. Landis Asso-
ciates (Pell City, Ala.; 205-884-4112), advises, “Don’t think that you have to
react to every single new software change, every new innovation, every up-
grade, every revision that comes on the market. But be knowledgeable and
conversant regarding new systems,” he maintained at the APICS Interna-
tional Conference. “Pick and choose only those functions that are going to
beneﬁt you. If you try to keep up with every new advancement, you’ll ei-
ther go crazy or bankrupt.”

Just-in-time ( JIT) not practical in a process manufacturing environment.
Ken-
neth B. Ackerman, president of K. B. Ackerman Company (Columbus, Ohio;
kenackerman@ameritech.net) declared at a recent Annual Conference of
the CLM, “JIT goes out the window when you have a continuous process.”
He explains, “Where you can never turn the mill off, where product is
rolling out of the plant 24/7, you have to stage the in-bound materials to
keep that line supplied, so it never gets shut down.” In addition, he reminds,
“There is also the signiﬁcant challenge in ﬁnding warehouse space and bal-
ancing the supply of space to the constant surge of material coming off the
line, especially when people are not buying the product.”
Majure Data announces RF Navigator version 11.0.
RF Navigator v11.0
(Majure Data; www.majuredata.com) has been redesigned to incorporate
advanced warehouse management functionality with browser-based tech-
nology. The Web-enabled front-end architecture release also offers ad-
vanced interface capabilities and more robust distribution functionality.
WMS needs to be part of a closed loop of information systems.
Having real-time
information on the activities within its walls is no longer sufﬁcient for the
DC, maintains Chris Newton of AMR Research, Inc. (Boston; www.
amrresearch.com). Instead, the WMS running the DC needs to be part of a
closed loop of information systems that feed and receive real-time informa-
tion to and from the order management system, transportation management
system, inventory management system, and supply chain planning applica-
tions. Such a closed loop enables DC operators to manage orders, inventory,
and assets optimally, he explains in the report Warehousing Isn’t Just about Stor-
age Anymore. “Without access to such information, the DC’s ability to han-
dle merge-in-transit, ﬂow-through, cross docking, and light manufacturing
is greatly reduced,” Newton charges.
Safety stock levels decline directly with reductions in forecast errors.
“A reduction
in forecast error yields a linear reduction in safety stock to achieve any given
level of service,” states John A. Estep, CFPIM, president of E/Step Software
Inc. (Tieton, Wash.; www.EstepSoftware.com). This means that a 25% re-
634
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

duction in forecast error yields a 25% reduction in safety stock. To improve
the forecast error, he suggests in a white paper (The Right Service at the Right
Price: Your Competitive Edge), “forecast each item on the calendar most ap-
propriate for that item.” In the fast food business, for example, this can mean
forecasting weekly, biweekly, and in some cases, daily. For the service parts
environment, it could be bimonthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.

The advance ship notice (ASN), done correctly, is invaluable tool.
The value of a
properly created ASN is in its representation of the actual content of a ship-
ment right down to the exact quantity and SKU level. Therefore, it should
be based on what is placed in a trailer or rail car and closed out when the
doors are sealed, according to Hank Lavery, vice president of logistics solu-
tions at Sterling Commerce (Dublin, Ohio; hank_lavery@stercomm.com).
“Many times, the ASN is created from the shipping system,” he explained at
a recent Annual Conference of the CLM. “Yet, in loading a trailer or other
carrier, what’s on a packing list sometimes doesn’t get packed due to size,
space, or other limitations; therefore, the ASN sent is not fully updated,” he
claims. It is best to create the ASN when the carrier is ready to leave the
dock.

Deﬁne your warehouse customers by level of activity.
“The fundamental chal-
lenge of the warehouse is to provide enough ﬂexibility to be customer-
driven,” maintains Patty Godin of Tompkins Associates, Inc. (Raleigh,
N.C.; www.tompkins.com). One way to remain ﬂexible is to deﬁne cus-
tomers in terms of what they bring to the company revenue. “A customer
who buys $50 worth of product each year should be treated differently from
the customer who buys $50,000 worth of product annually and the cus-
tomer who buys $50 every three years,” she explains. Separating customers
into tiers enables companies to fashion customer satisfaction accordingly.
“The management of accounts by a tier system provides companies with
enough information to know the customer, serve the customer, and satisfy
the customer,” Godin asserts.

New survey ﬁnds inventory turn improvement mixed.
“A substantial proportion
of companies reported modest improvements, anchored by 21% reporting
no improvements in inventory turnover and 15% reporting 3% to 5% im-
636
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

provements,” reports Global Supply Chain Benchmarking and Best Practices
Study—Phase II (KPMG LLP, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology). Approximately 15% reported turn improvements over
20%. Further, improvements in ﬁnished goods inventory turns were the
“most pronounced,” while WIP inventory turns also saw improvement. The
area in which performance improvements seem to be the least dramatic is
raw materials. “Since ﬁnished goods typically account for the largest portion
of inventory investment, it’s an obvious area of focus,” the report offers, but
adds that “WIP and raw materials are potential areas for achieving better as-
set management.”

answer can be found in the value of excess, nonmoving inventory. When
merchandise is donated to charity, it can be worth a federal income tax do-
nation, sometimes as much as two times the donated products’ cost. Con-

Automation and inventory reduction.
“A good automated system can cut your
inventory level substantially,” claims Mike Torch, senior vice president of
TransTech Consulting (Columbus, Ohio). However, technology cannot
do it alone. The following suggestions from WERCsheet together with
technology can help keep your material ﬂowing with effective inventory
management: (1) Perform location audits every 90 to 180 days to prevent
improper location of items; (2) count critical items frequently to avoid
stockouts and establish a system that ﬂags low quantities of important, fast-
moving items; (3) eliminate incoming inspections by perfecting receiving
practices; and (4) require delivery appointments and ASNs to ensure an au-
dit trail. 
MainBoss Mobile Inventory Application software for users who perform physical
counts.
Desktop Innovations, Inc. (Kitchener, Ontario, Canada; 800-563-
0894; www.mainboss.com) has released the ﬁrst in a series of MainBoss Mo-
bile Applications available free from the MainBoss Web site. MainBoss Mo-
bile Inventory Application allows users to perform physical counts and is
designed to work with a Palm III or Palm III units equipped with a bar code
scanner from Symbol Technologies. It is designed to be used either as a com-
panion application to MainBoss 2.6 maintenance software or as a stand-
alone application. For example, when used as a stand-alone application, the
entire inventory database is uploaded from a PC to a Palm III, where the in-
ventory application is used to obtain correct inventory counts. After count-
ing or verifying all the inventory counts in the database, the database is
downloaded to the PC with the correct counts.
Warehousing services remain a favorite application for logistics outsourcing.
Among
the activities outsourced most frequently to logistics service providers are
outbound transportation (62.9%), warehousing (62.9%), freight bill audit-
ing/payment (53.2%), and inbound transportation (48.9%), according to
Third Party Logistics Services: Views from the Customers (University of Ten-
nessee, Exel Logistics, and Ernst & Young). By contrast, those activities out-
sourced less frequently include order entry/order processing (3.8%), cus-
638
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

tomer service (6.5%), and inventory management (9.1%). Based on future
outsourcing plans, among the activities for which companies plan to increase
outsourcing most are freight consolidation/distribution (19.9%), warehous-
ing (16.1%), cross docking (12.4%), and information technology (10.8%).
“The presence of cross docking and information technology lends support
to the notion that priorities for future outsourcing are related to current per-
ceptions of the direction in which supply chain changes are moving,” the re-
search study concludes.

What ROI targets can you expect from a WMS?
A WMS can reduce the
amount of safety stock required by some 25% to 60% of total safety stock,
and the time spent searching for stock can be cut between 50% to 90% of the
current time spent. That is the type of ROI that you can anticipate from an
investment in a WMS, maintains Jim Coker, vice president of logistics prod-
uct strategy at MK Group (Atlanta, Ga.; cokja01@cai.com). Other ROI po-
tentials he cited at the Distribution/Computer Seminar East (C. S. Report,
Inc.; Uwchland, Pa.; 610-458-6410) include a 50% to 90% reduction in the
cost to process shipping errors, a 20% to 50% reduction in overtime hours,
and the complete elimination of annual physical inventories.

On making the inventory/service-level tradeoff.
Leading authority Marshall L.
Fisher of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadel-
phia; 215-898-7721) explains that the application of three strategies helps to
determine accurately the optimum inventory required to deliver a speciﬁc
ﬁll rate/service level. At the International Conference on Product Develop-
ment and the Supply Chain (Management Roundtable; Waltham, Mass.;
781-891-8080; www.ManagementRoundtable.com), he presented them as 
1. Accurate forecasts. “Improve forecasts by getting better data on de-
mand drivers and by developing models to extract insights from the data,”
he explains. 
2. Responsive supply. “Increase supply responsiveness by reducing lead
time and minimum batch size,” Fisher advises. 
3. Optimized inventory. “Employ planning models to derive optimal in-
ventory position based on the margin of error around the forecast and on the
cost of too much or too little inventory,” he details.

help managers recognize and overcome the common obstacles that under-
mine both internal and external integration of value-added logistical opera-
tions. This research-based book focuses on the why the work of logistics is
fundamental to supply chain success. Its contribution is an updated and more
comprehensive framework for achieving effective logistics change manage-
ment. The study, prepared by researchers at Michigan State University, uses
a continuing dialogue of Charlie Change and his hypothetical company,
Spartan Enterprises, to help describe each area of supply chain integration.
The dialogue illustrates how logistical performance can most often be sig-
niﬁcantly improved. The research team also provides many examples to il-
lustrate a particular point or practice. Enclosed with the book is a compact
disc that contains an assessment diagnostic and comparative benchmark data.

Do not clutter your WMS with a myriad of noncritical administrative tasks.
That
is the admonition from WMS guru John M. Hill of Cypress Associates (Wat-
sonville, Calif.; jhill835@aol.com). “A warehouse management system is not
a historical archiving system; nor is it designed to grind out lengthy reports,
graphs, charts, and other documents,” he insisted at Distribution/Computer
Seminar East. “It is an execution system, and as such, its primary mission is
the management of facility resources, work and material ﬂow to maximize
the efﬁciency of moving materials to market.” Although the WMS will gen-
erate data required for activity proﬁling, performance measurements, and the
like, Hill strongly recommends that “data manipulation for analysis is best ac-
complished off-line on a PC or host system.” 
CFOs paying stricter attention to inventory.
A basic approach to cost control—
stricter inventory monitoring—is now the most common tactic that com-
panies employ to maximize their cash ﬂows. According to a recent survey of
1,600 CFOs, 71% say they control inventory more strictly to lift their cash
ﬂows. According to Institutional Investor, 85% of CFOs also try to raise oper-
ating managers’ awareness of the importance of cash ﬂow; another 51% have
also focused their efforts with lower-level, nonmanagement employees.
What has happened to warehouse “blocking and tackling” issues?
Warehousing
expert Ken Ackerman, president of the Ackerman Company (Columbus,
New Inventory Management Products, Services, and Ideas
641

Ohio; 614-488-3165), notes, “Warehousing and logistics management to-
day is focused on supply chain management, alliance building, or other
strategic initiatives. Not enough is devoted to issues such as ﬁnding good
employees, reducing order cycle time, controlling damage, or reducing er-
ror rate.” In Ackerman Warehousing Forum, he emphasizes, “Corporate strat-
egy is lots of fun, but we should never take our eyes off quality and reliabil-
ity, the ‘blocking and tackling’ issues in warehousing.”

Improving effectiveness of inventory performance metrics.
“Once the perfor-
mance measurement system is in place, audit it to ensure its effectiveness,”
suggests Ann K. Willis, CFPIM, CIRM, operations and education manager
at ObTech (Newton, Mass.). At Congress for Progress (Mid-Atlantic Chapters
of APICS), she advised using the following evaluation factors: 
1. Measurements must be based on readily and continuously available
data and must be usable at all levels. 
2. Measurements should be easy to change as needs change. 
3. Measurements must focus on improvement and corrective action,
rather than monitoring or control.
4. Measurements should always be expressed as a positive, rather than
as a negative. 
Develop a supply chain–wide inventory strategy.
“There is too much inventory
in the supply chain, and it costs an enormous amount,” charges Richard
Wilkins, director of sales and marketing at Robocom Systems International
Inc. (Massapequa, N.Y.; rick@robocom.com). “Replace inventory with
information for multiple levels of decision making,” he advised at Distri-
bution/Computer Seminar (C. S. Report, Inc.; Uwchland, Pa.; 800-338-
4112). “Also, design the supply chain structure as a strategic effort, not a tac-
tical one, and use it as a positioning strategy,” he recommends.
642
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Integrated inventory planning for improved forecasts.
“Integrated inventory
planning is the most critical, but often the most insufﬁcient, component of
a good forecasting system,” pronounces John A. Estep, CFPIM, president of
E/Step Software Inc. (Tieton, Wash.; 509-678-5900). “A forecast is not a
number, but a range.” For example, he writes in IIE Solutions, suppose the
forecast for a period is 2,000 units plus another 250 for safety stock to achieve
98% service. According to Estep, “safety stock should be computed from
service target, forecast error, error distribution, replenishment frequency,
and lead time, among other things.” It should not be a ﬁxed-time-supply
guess, which often yields the “frustrating” combination of high inventory
and low service. His advice: “Select a software package that enables you to
specify the service target while it then computes the inventory required for
each item. Or if you specify the inventory, and then let the system compute
the service, that inventory level will deliver.”

Advice on successfully implementing a WMS.
WMS Implementation: Not for the
Impatient or Faint of Heart, teaches that WMS implementation can be ac-
complished successfully by knowing (1) what steps to take in the begin-
ning;,(2) what to expect after you take those steps, and (3) how to handle the
bumps in the road. A free copy of the monograph is available from Tomp-
kins Associates Inc., 2809 Millbrook Road, Raleigh, NC 27616; 919-876-
3667; fax, 919-872-9666; www.tompkinsinc.com.
How to avoid safety stock when scrap/yield is not as planned.
“The MRP pro-
cess is very unfriendly to yield/scrap other than the planned value,” notes
Don Frank, president of D. N. Frank, Inc. (Florham Park, N.J.; 973-377-
6782). “If the yield is greater than planned, there is excess inventory; if it is
less, MRP will—usually too late—set up a new requirement,” he explains.
A sensible way to deal with unplanned yield/scrap is to use safety stock, but
with a proviso, Frank insists. “This only should be used if the schedule will
be disrupted when the yield/scrap is different from the planned value,” he
advises. “If, however, lot sizes are sufﬁciently large to bridge more than one
New Inventory Management Products, Services, and Ideas
643

master schedule requirement and/or lead times are short, no yield/scrap ac-
tion may be needed,” Frank explains.
Pity the poor, ignored bar code label.
“I’ve noticed that one of the most vital
pieces to the warehouse management puzzle seems to get the least atten-
tion—the bar code label,” argues Nancy Rouse, marketing coordinator at
Logmatix, Inc. Since the bar code label, among other things, is critical to en-
suring that your inventory is correct, she advises the following in Outlook
(Materials Handling and Management Society; 704-522-8644): (1) Paper la-
bels will not hold up under humid, dusty conditions; (2) direct thermal la-
bels cannot be used in heat or sunlight; (3) not all labels stick in cold tem-
peratures; and (4) a retroreﬂective label is necessary for long-range scanning.
“Get samples to test, and make the label large enough for your bar code,”
Rouse recommends.
Another truth about inventory: an asset, or expense.
While inventory is listed as
an asset, it can affect cash ﬂow in a negative manner, asserts expert Michael
Harding of Harding Associates (Bristol, Vt.). “Inventory, in reality, is not an
asset but a potential asset,” he insists. “This inventory does not become as as-
set until there is a customer order for that item.” He cites the example of ob-
solete inventory. Accountants recognize the material as unusable but are
reluctant to write it off because that will diminish the book value of the or-
ganization. They tend to wait for a “good” quarter, which may be years
away, to write the inventory off. “In any event,” he argues in NAPM Info-
Edge, “the asset becomes a non-value-added expense with the stroke of a
pen and overhead increases during the holding period.”
What are top executives’ primary concerns about inventory?
According to a re-
cent Inventory Reduction Report survey, readers say that their bosses are most
worried about (1) managing inventory levels (25.7%), (2) inventory carrying
costs (22.5%), and (3) improving inventory turns (9.6%).
Global logistics software makes inventory “visible.”

into and through processing centers and subassembly operations. Honda
now can plan and execute inventory demand planning with its customers
and mill sites.

Trade-offs must be considered when implementing point-of-use inventory.
“These
involve considerations of the amount of stock, its location or locations, and
ease of supply,” reports Rajan Suri (Quick Response Manufacturing; Productivity
Press; Portland, Ore.). Other guidelines he offers include the following: (1)
For parts that are unique to one cell, place bins right in the cell that use each
particular part. (2) For shared parts, further analysis is needed. High-volume
parts justify placing bins in each cell. For medium-volume parts, place them in
a common location that is reasonably accessible to all the cells, or select a lo-

are used sporadically by a number of different cells, Suri does not advise point-
of-use storage. Use a traditional centralized stockroom in this case.

Contingency planning in the warehouse is essential.
“Warehouse management
must develop contingency plans for each area that would be impaired, crip-
pled, or devastated in the event of a crisis,” declares Mike Halsey, project di-
rector at Tompkins Associates (Raleigh, N.C.). With the increased reliance
on computerized data for inventory information, it is recommended that
contingencies be in place for possible hard drive and network crashes.
“Back-ups of staff computers should be performed regularly, if not daily,”
says Halsey. “Networks should be backed up on tape in the same manner.”
Back-up programs should (1) perform the functions automatically to ensure
consistency, (2) alert managers to unsaved ﬁles, and (3) ignore ﬁles that have
not been revised since the last back-up, he advises.
New software enhances supply chain inventory management functions.
PRMS 9.0
(Acacia Technologies, a division of Computer Associates International, Inc.;
Lisle, Ill.), an ERP solution with extensive supply chain management capa-
bilities, contains new enhancements, including VMI and consignment in-
ventory functionalities. Also new is the purchasing receipts in-transit in-
ventory feature, which allows tracking of items received at inbound

Improve warehouse storage productivity through better inventory management.
“Better inventory management can reduce the amount of product kept in
storage and at the same time facilitate a layout which is more effective with-
out making large investments in equipment,” maintains leading authority
Kenneth B. Ackerman, president of the Ackerman Company (Columbus,
Ohio). “Every warehouse manager should identify and kill off the FISH
[ﬁrst in, still here], or the dead items that exist in nearly every inventory.”
Furthermore, he adds, “When your inventory management system identi-
ﬁes which items move fastest, you can create a storage layout to reduce travel
time by placing fast-moving items close to the ﬂoor and to the door.”

New demands on transportation suppliers to increase visibility of in-transit inventory.
Buyers often need visibility to in-transit inventory levels to determine
whether they can support either a production schedule change or additional
product promotions, according to a new white paper, Transportation Man-
agement. Therefore, customers are “demanding” additional information
from their suppliers to increase visibility to in-transit inventories through
EDI, advance ship notices, and product tracking capabilities. For a copy,
write Carolyn S. Morgan, marketing manager, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, 400 Northridge Road, Suite 1000, Atlanta, GA 30350; 770-643-5100;

Inventory turn measurement more meaningful when based on individual categories.
By focusing on speciﬁc inventory categories, attention is brought to those
646
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

areas that need attention. “This visibility is not readily apparent with the to-
tal inventory turnover measurement,” declare Terry W. Campbell, CPIM,
executive director; Craig Hagen, manager of planning and logistics; and
Jerry Tomaz, manager of material control, TVCOM International. The
meaningful categories, they explained at the 40th Annual International
Conference of APICS will be different for each company. At TVCOM, for
instance, the categories include ﬁnished goods, WIP, components, subcon-
tracted assemblies, and engineering inventories. “Subcontracted assemblies
are separated from components to focus on supply chain differences,” they
offer.
Outsourcing inventory management responsibilities still emphasizes cost savings.
Authority Richard D. Armstrong, president of Armstrong & Associates
(Stoughton, Wis.; 608-873-8929), observes, “Although we continue to
point to broader issues in regard to outsourcing, our experience indicates
that decision makers of third-party logistics customers emphasize cost sav-
ings.” As an example of the savings potential in reduced inventory and car-
rying costs, he reports that it is in the range of 7% to 10%. Another interest-
ing ﬁnding in his State on Contract Logistics Report is that most companies
(74%) who outsource logistics functions use a single third-party provider.
Only 3% use more than ﬁve third-party logistics providers.
Latest version of Warehouse BOSS expands RF, tracking capabilities.
The WMS
Warehouse BOSS 6.0, with its enhanced RF receiving capabilities, prom-
ises to streamline the receiving process. Also, through resource reporting
and activity tracking, it deﬁnes tasks, tracks tasks being performed, tracks the
amount of time spent performing the tasks, and determines the quantity of
work completed. The new version also has proactive replenishment plan-
ning, which provides the ability to generate, modify, and commit replenish-
ment plans outside of pick planning. For information, contact Acacia Tech-

Supply-Chain Council releases new version of SCOR.
The Supply Chain Op-
erations Reference model (SCOR), release 3, continues the evolution in de-
veloping a standard for supply chain management. “If we want to assure our-
selves the toolkit that SCOR provides will enable users to describe virtually
any supply chain and across different industries, we must continue to explore
a broad range of performance issues and integration practices,” explained
New Inventory Management Products, Services, and Ideas
647

William Helming, director of PRTM (Weston, Mass.; bhelming@fcg.prtm.
com). Release 3 eliminates process and discrete redundancies in Level 2 of
the Make model element. Also, the software provider information has been
removed from SCOR due to the difﬁculty of keeping it current. However,
the model will still list best practices and software features that will enable
that best practice. Release 3 also includes an enhanced glossary, complete
with metrics deﬁnitions. For information, contact Bill Hakanson, executive

The inventory contained within the total pipeline is important.
Noted supply
chain authority James E. Morehouse, vice president of A. T. Kearney Inc.
(Chicago; 312-223-6500), questions a company’s competitive strategy that
calls for cutting its inventories incrementally and increasing their inventory
turns from, say, seven to 10, or from 10 to 15. “The turns of the typical to-
tal pipeline inventory, from Mother Earth to the ultimate consumer, are
about one per year, and that’s what counts,” he emphasized at a recent An-
nual Conference of the CLM. “That’s where the economy is. It isn’t what
we do in our own company alone that counts; it’s what the whole supply
chain does together,” he explained in the keynote. “Unfortunately, many of
the suggested programs simply move inventory to somebody else in the
supply chain, and that ‘solution’ is not going to change your fundamental
competitive position in the next century,” Morehouse warns. “The real
breakthrough is to put an end to inventory.”

Collaboration must be both internal and external for best inventory management.
Troy E. Carbaugh, regional director of Logility Inc. (Rosemont, Ill.; 847-
292-2106), wants to correct a misconception about total collaboration. “A
lot of the experts, and some practitioners, talk of total collaboration as ex-
tending/sharing information to the customers and suppliers,” he told a
Supply Chain Forum (Institute for International Research). “Without ﬁrst
taking care of your internal organization, and only going after the external
partners, you’re just going to have a big black hole that’s going to suck up a
lot of resources and inventory,” he declares. “You have to have one system
that’ll allow you do one-number planning.”
New software offers end-to-end visibility of inventory throughout supply chain.
En-
ergy DeliveryNet.com, from Descartes Systems Group Inc. (Waterloo, On-
tario; www.descartes.com), is a Web-based delivery management system to
monitor and track the ﬂow of products throughout entire supply chains.
Descartes ofﬁcials note that this is the “ﬁrst community-shared software ap-
plication allowing all shippers, customers, suppliers, manufacturers, carriers,
freight forwarders, and other trading partners to have real-time visibility of
where products are in the supply chain via traditional Web browsers.” The
Energy DeliveryNet.com software suite allows each of its customers to cre-
ate a collaborative supply chain network via the Internet.
Can you justify an investment in APS software?
“Putting aside sophisticated
optimization algorithms for a moment, the simplest APS implementations
will yield faster planning made more accurate by simultaneous consideration
of material and plant capacities,” assures John Bermudez, group director of
supply chain management at AMR Research (Boston; 617-542-6600). Will
this yield enough beneﬁts to pay for APS? he queries in “Supply Chain Plan-
ning” in The Report on Supply Chain Management (AMR Research). “Keep
in mind not all APS products cost millions of dollars. There are many APS
products available in the $100K to $500K price range.” While this is expen-
sive, he analyzes, “A typical manufacturer with $100M in sales with four in-
ventory turns would only need a 3% reduction in inventory to achieve a
one-year payback on a $500K APS investment.”
BOM accuracy critical when analyzing inventory levels.
“The accuracy of your
bills of material is an important factor to consider when analyzing inventory
levels,” maintains Ron Pachura, manager of national manufacturing and
wholesale/distribution practice at McGladrey & Pullen LLP (Schaumburg,
New Inventory Management Products, Services, and Ideas
649

Ill.; rpachura@mcgladreycs.com). He offers inventory managers the follow-
ing guides in IIE Solutions: (1) How often are BOMs reviewed and updated?
(2) Are BOMs accurate; do they contain an engineer’s concept of the prod-
uct from several years ago, or do they reﬂect the actual parts and subassem-
blies that are used on the shop ﬂoor? (3) Are quantities per assembly and
units of measure identiﬁed within BOMs? (4) Has the purchasing lead time
been entered into the item master for each purchased item? (5) Is scrap or
shrinkage factored into the yields? “Bills created using 100% yields are al-
most always incorrect, resulting in shortages or overage due to inaccurate use
of parts,” Pachura details.

Watch the ﬁne print when suppliers agree to hold your inventory.
“When exam-
ined closely, many JIT delivery systems involve nothing more than relocat-
ing inventory from the purchaser to the next company upstream,” argue
Frank Haluch, CPM, Haluch and Associates (Trumbull, Conn.; 203-268-
1005), and Robert J. Trent, Lehigh University (Bethlehem, Pa.; 610-758-
4952). These pseudo-JIT systems do not come without cost. “When sur-
veyed, suppliers have reported that they charge price adders to compensate
for holding a purchaser’s inventory,” they said at an Annual International
Purchasing Conference of the National Association of Purchasing Manage-
ment. “By working together, the buyer and seller may identify the true cost
of holding inventory and develop a better approach for managing inventory
investment. This approach could very well involve joint efforts to create a
true lean supply chain,” they explain.

Customer input really drives inventory management success.
Organizations that
succeed in inventory management do not follow a magic formula for stock-
ing appropriate amounts of inventory. Instead, they actively solicit infor-
mation from their customers and salespeople, according to ﬁndings from a
recent inventory benchmarking study. “Successful organizations measure
customer service level on a regular, ongoing basis,” according to Linda
Mullinix, project manager for the study. “Best practice companies in the
study also consider turnover a less important measure of inventory perfor-
mance than customer service level or return on investment.” The ﬁnal re-
port from the study, Inventory Management: Enhancing Proﬁts by Controlling
Distribution, is available from American Productivity and Quality Center,

Avoid uncertainty and stop building inventory.
“When a supply chain manager
is uncertain, he’s going to build inventory as a defense mechanism,” charges
Peter Stiles, senior vice president of product strategies at EXE Technologies
(Dallas; 972-233-3761). A solution he proposes is to build an information
focal point. “Take all of the documents from all the various sources used to
manage the supply chain and concentrate them in one place,” he explained
New Inventory Management Products, Services, and Ideas
651

at a Distribution/Computer Seminar East (C. S. Report, Inc.; Uwchland,
Pa.). “The idea is to provide visibility throughout the supply chain, enabling
the supply chain manager to see inventory in all states, and inventory in tran-
sit, as well as standing inventory. Then the manager can better monitor ac-
tivity against plan and send alerts if it’s not working according to plan,” he
asserts.

Include the less visible costs to determine true cost of carrying inventory.
Most cal-
culations of inventory carrying costs include the “visible” costs, such as in-
terest rate of money; taxes; insurance; space, occupancy, and utilities; equip-
ment (movement and storage); and scrap and obsolescence. According to
Bill Poole, CPIM, president of Purchasing & Planning Solutions (Roch-
ester, N.Y.; BillPoole@aol.com), there are “additional less visible costs that
cannot be ignored to get a truer picture of inventory carrying cost.” At an
MRO Cost Management Strategies Conference (Institute of International
Research; New York), he identiﬁed them as personnel (planners, analysts,
warehousers); transactions (counting, moving, retrieving, issuing, reconcil-
ing); reinspection (return of defective material); and rework, handling dam-
age, and loss.

Inventory management headed for outsourcing in the near future?
According to
the 1998 Third-Party Logistics survey (Exel Logistics, University of Ten-
nessee, and Ernst & Young LLP), there is a “suggestion” that inventory man-
agement will be among the areas to which ﬁrms will increasingly turn for
outsourced logistics services. The 8.9% response contrasts with the “likeli-
est” activities for future outsourcing of freight consolidation/distribution
(18.7%), inbound transportation (13.8%), trafﬁc management (13.0%), and
warehousing (12.2%). Further, those organizations using third-party logis-
tics providers for cross-docking services surged from 21.7% to 30.9%, em-
phasizing the need for smooth-ﬂowing logistics in the supply chain. 
Are you cycle counting, and just correcting the count?
“That’s the wrong idea,”
asserts authority Terry Lunn, CFPIM, CIRM, Terry Lunn Enterprises (Big
Canoe, Ga.; 706-268-3975). “The most important work in cycle counting
is to correct the cause of error,” he declared at an APICS International Con-
ference. “Companies able to reduce their inventory have a cycle counting
process in place that consistently attacks the causes of errors and improves
the process.”
New software promises inventory reduction within supply chain.

Advanced planning and scheduling systems can help reduce inventory.
Inventory
reduction has long been the classic justiﬁcation for a new planning sys-
tem, including MRP, ERP, and now APS, argues John Bermudez, group di-
rector of supply chain management at AMR Research, Inc. (Boston;
jbermudez@admfg.com). Although no speciﬁc function in APS reduces in-
ventory, he explains in The Report on Supply Chain Management (“Supply
Chain Planning: Where Do You Start?”), it can help (1) reduce inventory
carried to cover long-term planned horizons and planning cycle periods;
(2) reduce just-in-case inventory with more precise, synchronized material
planning; (3) shorten manufacturing cycle time by synchronizing material
arrivals with resource availability; (4) improve inventory deployment
throughout the supply chain; and (5) more accurately match safety stock to
customer service level requirements.

Creating “tight” speciﬁcations to deter product theft.
Bruce Cutler, director of
logistics operations at Compaq Computer Corporation (Houston; 281-514-
1453), recommends developing a series of pallet speciﬁcations to avoid
product damage and theft, yet maintaining pallet integrity and facilitating
ﬂow through the channel. “Our complete pallet speciﬁcations serve mul-
tiple purposes,” he explained at the Proven Performance Metrics in Logis-
tics conference. The detailed specs are to (1) ease receipt at the customer site
through dimensional control, (2) deter theft by specifying proper wrapping
and banding procedures to make carton removal difﬁcult, and (3) avoid
product/package damage though the establishment of stacking standards.
Is safety stock your Trojan horse?
Safety stock may be necessary and beneﬁ-
cial if strategically planned for the right reasons, according to Dave Gar-
wood, president of R. D. Garwood, Inc. (Marietta, Ga.; www.rdgarwood.
com). “It is more often misunderstood, deceptive, and disastrous,” he
charges. When the safety stock parameter (pieces, days, or level of kanban
signal) is increased in a planning stage, he explains, “additional material or
product does not automatically pop up in the warehouse; nor is there a pad-
locked box in the warehouse with this minimum inventory.” It takes more
capacity in the supply chain to make more and, thus, increase buffer inven-
tory or safety stock. “It takes valid schedules, due dates that are the real need
dates, and meeting them 100% on time to ensure the right items are pro-
duced. More planned safety stock will not overcome the root causes of

shortages—lack of capacity or invalid schedules,” Garwood offers. “Beware
of increasing safety stock—it just may be a Trojan horse.”
WMS troubleshooting guide a real time saver.
“A warehouse management sys-
tem troubleshooting guide explains the possible cause, simple diagnostic
tests, and recommended solutions,” explains Catherine Cooper of the Pro-
gress Group (Albuquerque). “It provides quick reference to common prob-
lems with bar code scanners, terminals, software, and other elements of the
system.” Many WMS implementations do not have one because implemen-
tation teams generally do not have the time or resources to create them, she
explains in IIR Solutions. However, she recommends, “The daunting task is
accomplished by designating a spiral notebook as the troubleshooting guide
at the beginning of the project. Team members should then be encouraged
to record, in simple language, frequently encountered problems and how
they were resolved.” The guide then exists as a living document, being up-
dated on an ongoing basis.
Better inventory management through improved supplier relations.
Wholesalers
are developing better relationships with their suppliers to “guarantee a
smoother ﬂow of product through the distribution pipeline,” according to
a survey by The Distributor’s and Wholesaler’s Advisor. The top factors the re-
spondents selected as having the greatest inﬂuence on how they manage
their inventories include (1) better relations with suppliers (29%), (2) upgrad-
ing inventory management system (29%), and (3) upgrading automated pur-
chasing system (14%). Customer orders via EDI (2%) and customers’ de-
mand for JIT deliveries (5%) trail.
What is your boss’s biggest inventory management concern?
According to an In-
ventory Reduction Report reader study, 35.6% of the respondents identiﬁed it
as reducing inventory levels by a wide margin. Lagging behind in second
place is inventory accuracy (18.1%), followed by inventory carrying costs
(17.4%), with inventory turns (9.4%) trailing.
What to do about slow-moving inventory under a consignment agreement.
A key
element in a successful consignment relationship is to keep the inventory
moving, afﬁrms Mark K. Williams, consulting manager at North Highland
Company (Atlanta, Ga.). “Developing inventory turn goals, by individual
product or by product group, can uncover slow-moving items that are in-
appropriate for consignment,” he told a recent APICS Annual International
656
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Conference. During negotiations, it is important to determine which party
will monitor inventory turnover and how slow-moving goods will be han-
dled, he advised. Agreement should be reached about whether they will be
returned to the supplier or purchased by the customer and removed from the
consigned inventory. “Through careful negotiation, consignment can work
not only for the customer but also for the supplier,” Williams expressed.
Total system inventory drives integrated supply chain excellence.
“Inventory
breeds at disconnects in the supply chain,” claims J. Paul Dittman, vice pres-
ident of global logistics at Whirlpool Corporation (St. Joseph, Mich.;
john_p_dittman@email.whirlpool.com). “When measuring inventory, go
beyond the boundaries of your company to your suppliers’ and customers’
inventory and really look at the total system to gain a perspective on how
seamless your supply chain really is,” he advised at the Proven Performance
Metrics in Logistics Conference (Institute for International Research; New
York). “The better the supply chain is operating as a process, certainly the
less inventory will then have to be in the chain.”

to the activity, a clear relationship can be established between sources of ac-
tivity demanded and related costs,” explains Robert Olsen, project manager
at Tompkins Associates (Raleigh, N.C.). incurred, what is initiating the
costs, and where to apply efforts to curb inﬂationary costs. “This can be
of particular value in tracking new products and logistics costs,” he main-
tains.

over the Internet, private networks, or dial-up connections. It is Web-
enabled and fully compliant with the Voluntary Inter-industry Commerce
Standards Organization’s CPFR guidelines.
Where to start reviewing inventory for obsolescence.
“At the receiving dock,” an-
swers Asbury R. Lockett, CPIM, Washington Manufacturing Services. The
object, he suggests in APICS’s Performance Advantage, is to review those items
most likely to be unused if brought in when there are insufﬁcient require-
ments. “In an ABC inventory coding system, you may want to initially limit
the review to A items,” he explains. Other criteria may include (1) inventory
used on products with decreasing demand, (2) inventory subject to supplier
improvements, (3) inventory with limited shelf life, (4) parts easily damaged
by frequent handling, and (5) unique parts used only by particular customers. 
New report from NAW explores potential of electronic commerce.
Practical con-
tinuous replenishment programs and truly interactive Web commerce will
combine to shock the entire distribution channel into creating a new busi-
ness model. That is the message from Electronic Commerce for Distribution
Channels, a report commissioned by the Distribution Research and Educa-
tion Foundation. It contains case studies, interviews, and a clear explanation
of why EDI-based continuous replenishment programs have failed but are
now poised to deliver breakthroughs in lower costs and added value. It
probes the future of interactive Web commerce and how organizations will
invent new channel roles that go far beyond a simple Web catalog that en-
ables online orders. Price: $88 for NAW direct members; $110 for members

Supply chains should provide better service on items that cost less.
“Rarely does
an item’s cost inﬂuence its safety stock,” argues Terry Harris, managing part-
ner at Chicago Consulting (Chicago; 312-346-5080). “Even the newest,
presumably most advanced enterprise-wide systems use the same traditional
techniques embedded in virtually all inventory management systems.” This
means that if two items are otherwise the same, the $1 item will be stocked
the same as will the $1,000 item. “This approach is very costly and results in
lower service and lost customers,” he maintains. As an example of how cus-
658
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

tomers respond to out-of-stock situations, he cites the following: Would you
be more or less satisﬁed to ﬁnd out that your mechanic kept your car because
he was out of a $10 radiator cap or because he was out of a $1,000 engine
block? According to Harris, “We can achieve higher availability by having
better service on less costly items. And since the capital we have to invest in
inventory is limited, we can achieve that higher availability by having better
service on the less expensive items.”
Successful warehouses continue to focus on inventory reduction practices.
Inventory
reduction is a primary goal of supply chain management, concludes The
Changing Role of Warehousing (Warehousing Education and Research Coun-
cil; Oak Brook, Ill.; 630-990-0001). In the future, however, space will be
important, but storage will not, according to warehouse managers who were
interviewed. “Organizations will do whatever they can to reduce costly in-
ventory, limit forecast errors, and increase inventory velocity,” believes
Arnold Maltz, director of research at the WERC. 
Uncertainty builds inventory in supply chains.
“Uncertainty of both kinds,
supply and demand, manifests itself physically in the form of inventories,”
declare John M. Burnham, CFPIM, and R. Nat Natarajan, CPIM, CIRM,
both of Tennessee Tech, and Gerald W. Bapst, CFPIM, CIRM, of the Lo-
gistics Management Institute. The key to reducing inventory in the system
is to identify the underlying sources of uncertainty and substitute informa-
tion for inventory, they told an APICS Annual International Conference.
Even though companies are making strategic investments in information
technology, they observe, and even though “the principle is quite simple, it
still requires the measurement of uncertainties in the supply chain and relat-
ing them to inventories.”

Six steps of a successful third-party provider selection process.
According to
Charles A. Watts, John Carroll University (Cleveland), at Congress for Pro-
gress (Mid-Atlantic Chapters of APICS), success is improved by (1) getting
a third party provider’s assistance in developing requirements; (2) keeping
the request for proposal open for the general improvements you want, but
not how you want these areas addressed; (3) making sure you have narrowed
the list to two to three providers by the request for proposal (RFP) stage; (4)
making sure the RFP includes current conditions and some indication of
how things will change in the future; (5) giving the third-party provider
660
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

plenty of time to respond to the proposal (a minimum of two weeks); and
(6) ﬁnding out who the third party’s project leader will be during start-up
and on-going operation.

Cycle counting can be done in the process industry, too.
Robert A. Stahl, CPIM,
of the R. A. Stahl Company (Attleboro, Mass.; 508-226-0477), explains,
“Traditional control group cycle counting is typically done by many items
and/or locations. In the process industry, since there are few items/locations,
it is more often done on one location [tank] for a category of vessels.” The
single tank is counted on a daily basis until all causes of inaccuracy have been
identiﬁed and eliminated. The solutions are then replicated to the balance of
the tanks (vessels) in that category. “Similarly, there are few items/locations
on which to do random cycle counting,” he explained at Congress for Pro-
gress (Mid-Atlantic Chapters of APICS). “It is therefore done on a daily ba-
sis, but the statistical inference about accuracy is derived from a rolling aver-
age over a relatively large period of time—one or two months—rather than
on each daily/weekly count,” Stahl advises.

Midsize manufacturers use Internet for supply chain functions.
More than half
(58%) of all midsize manufacturers use the Internet to share information
with customers and suppliers, according to a survey by Grant Thornton LLP
(Chicago; 312-856-0001). While 19% of the respondents say they currently
use the Internet for VMI, 31% plan to use it for VMI and 27% for lot track-
ing during the next two years. Manufacturers are considering not only how
the Internet can be used to improve their supply chains but also how other
processes can speed the ﬂow of product to customer. One technique being
used is supply chain optimization, which focuses on making tradeoffs among
operational costs and inventory, delivery reliability and response time, and
service to the customer to meet business objectives.
Time-to-beneﬁt becomes the telling parameter for WMS installations.
Richard
Wilkins, director of sales and marketing at Robocom Systems International
Inc. (Massapequa, N.Y.; rick@robocom.com), observes, “Customers are
looking for faster, more assured implementation of warehouse management
systems as they want to reduce their risk and shorten the time-to-beneﬁt.
However, they also must recognize that due to staff turnover their system’s
usefulness of application degrades by about 20% per year.” His recommen-
dation: “Have the system manufacturer return periodically to retrain and re-
ﬁne operator practices to achieve maximum performance.”
SeeChain supply chain performance measurement suite debuts.
Five applications
are included in the SeeChain suite to allow inventory managers and execu-
tives to see and collaborate across the supply chain. SeeChain Unﬁnished In-
ventory measures the inventory levels of raw materials and semiﬁnished
goods in stock so that potential inventory shortages can be avoided. It also
allows organizations to measure the value of excess inventory in the supply
chain. SeeChain Finished Goods measures the inventory levels of ﬁnished
goods in stock and the value of excess inventory in warehouses and DCs.
SeeChain Demand Accuracy measures the accuracy of the sales forecast
compared to actual sales. The applications can span multiple applications and
enterprises. The software complements existing investments in supply chain

For WMS applications, bid software and hardware separately.
That is the practi-
cal advice from John Seidl, partner at Deloitte Consulting (Atlanta, Ga.;
jseidl@dttus.com). “A lot of people, when they’re out bidding warehouse
management systems, will ask the potential vendors to quote the hardware
and software together,” he explained at Distribution/Computer Seminar
(C. S. Report, Inc.; Uwchland, Pa.; 610-458-6410). “It might be conven-
ient for you to source all your needs from a single point, but it may not be
the best deal ﬁnancially,” he warns. The reason: “What vendors will do in
bidding the system is notoriously underbid the hardware. It gives their bot-
tom-line number the appearance of looking smaller,” he explains. “As a rule
of thumb, if we have them bid the hardware, we bid it separate, or we don’t
consider it when we do the ﬁnancial analysis of the different bids.” 
EXE introduces Exceed Work Order.

Promote inventory performance measurements.
“When you do performance
measurement, make it big. Display it all over and use the power of peer pres-
sure and pride to your advantage,” Michael A. Jacobi, vice president of Buker,
Inc. (Gurnee, Ill.; mjacobi@buker.com), strongly advises. “If it is important,
then permanently display the inventory performance metrics in prominent
places, like the stockroom,” he recommended at Congress for Progress (Mid-
Atlantic Chapters of APICS). “If you make a big deal about it, people will try
hard, too. It’s remarkable what happens when you put a manager’s name right
alongside the performance number and hang it on a wall.”

WebPLAN unveils e-commerce product.
WebPLAN eSupply-Chain is a suite
of native Web applications that enable manufacturers, suppliers, and cus-
tomers to transact supply chain commerce in a high-velocity community. It
includes onPLAN, SupplyIT, OrderIT, and DemandIT. OnPLAN, ﬁrst de-
livered in December 1998, provides performance metrics on the supply chain
and its individual members, with an interface to OLAP technology. Sup-
plyIT, just released, enables suppliers to view supply order details remotely
and simulate multiple fulﬁllment scenarios using the manufacturer’s actual
production schedule. This reduces supplier order response time and enables
extended supplier relationships such as VMI. OrderIT, also new, allows cus-
tomers to place orders, monitor progress, and make modiﬁcations through all
stages of the manufacturing cycle. DemandIT, planned for delivery in fourth
quarter, is a Web application that allows collaborative demand and sales/
operations planning. Modules, priced separately, range from $10,000 to
$35,000. Contact: webPLAN Corp., 600 Terry Fox Drive, Kanata, Ontario,

What’s wrong with this picture?
Analyzing a recent survey, Beth Enslow, re-
search director of business applications for the Gartner Group (Stamford,
Conn.; bizapps@gartner.com), observes that corporate executives, whether
leading a cost reduction supply chain strategy or a revenue enhancement ini-
tiative, overwhelmingly agree that their number-one supply chain priority
is “planning and deploying inventory more effectively.” However, when
looking at the speciﬁc initiatives that could have a profound impact on real-
izing this priority—such as communicating electronically with trading part-
ners, cutting manufacturing cycle time, or reducing order fulﬁllment cycle
time—they were consistently ranked at the bottom of the priority list by the
executives. “Apparently, they know what they want, but don’t know exactly
what is needed to achieve it,” she observed at the Softworld Manufacturing
and Supply Chain Expo and Supply Chain Conference.

Supply chain book and Web site sponsored by Accenture (formerly Andersen Con-
sulting).
The book, Achieving Supply Chain Excellence through Technology,
and Web site (www.ascet.com) contain a collection of thought-provoking
papers and articles on a wide range of supply chain management issues. Ed-
itorial content has been drawn from leaders in all sectors of the supply chain
industry.
On keeping process maps up to date.
“To effectively manage and measure your
supply chain, you have to understand the individual processes,” maintains
Dennis Dreyer, director of logistics, service parts operations, at General Mo-
tors (Grand Blanc, Mich.; 8120-606-4215). “That’s why it’s important to
have a map of all your material ﬂows,” he advised at Interlog (Worldwide
Business Research; New York). “A learning we picked up over the past few
years is that the pace of change is such that you continually have to go back
and reevaluate your network, to make sure that you’re still aware of what’s
going on out there, and the implication it has on the data you’re collecting.”
New inventory control module released for Web-based procurement software.
American Tech (Holmdel, N.J.; www.purchasingnet.com) has added a
100% Web-based inventory control module to its PurchasingNet-SQL pro-
curement software. The inventory software allows companies with multiple
sites, branches, or warehouses to manage inventory levels throughout the
enterprise. Each site can manage its on-hand inventory, reorder points, and
order quantities via any standard Web browser. It also includes transactions
for issues, transfers, adjustments, and returns. The system supports cycle
counting and contains a dynamic JIT inventory reorder analysis that auto-
matically generates replenishment requisitions upon issuance of material.
It is not a matter of choosing whether ERP or supply chain management is better for
your organization.
“Supply chain management is the next logical step in an
ERP implementation,” argues Carol A. Ptak, CFPIM, CIRM, principal,
global ERP solutions group, IBM (Lakebay, Wash.; cptak@us.ibm.com).
ERP is simply a computer tool that facilitates the planning of all resources
in the enterprise,” she explained at Congress for Progress (Mid-Atlantic
Chapters of APICS). “Supply chain management is where there is an auto-
mated integration of demands from customers to the requirements from
suppliers through the calculation of the ERP system,” Ptak offers. Supply
chain management provides the ability to translate demands from the mar-
ket quickly to supplier requirements. “The goal is to minimize the amount

of inventory in the supply chain, improve the agility of each link of the
chain, and, therefore, improve the proﬁtability of all supply chain partners.
Being able to quickly translate those customer demands to supplier require-
ments deﬁnes the requirement for effective supply chain management, and
ERP is the engine that makes that translation happen,” Ptak afﬁrms. “At-
tempting to implement supply chain without effectively using an ERP tool
to manage the internal enterprise is rather like buying a car without an en-
gine,” she insists. 
SCOR overview now available in print.
The Supply-Chain Council (Pitts-
burgh; www.supply-chain.org; info@supply-chain.org) has released an
overview of the SCOR model in print form. SCOR is a standard guideline
used by leading companies to examine the conﬁguration of their supply
chains, identify and measure metrics in the chain, determine weak links, and
then work to achieve best practice where deemed appropriate.
The critical elements in determining stocking quantities.
Thomas C. Uhrig, pres-
ident of TCLogic (Indianapolis; www.tclogic.com), deﬁnes ﬁve critical
stocking factors for building an inventory model. At Interlog (Worldwide
Business Research; www.wbresearch.com) he identiﬁed them as (1) inter-
nal efﬁciency (DC operations, ordering proﬁciency), (2) business goals (in-
ventory turns, service level), (3) suppliers (lead time, order policies, package
quantity), (4) items (criticality, cost, life cycle), and (5) customers (service re-
quirements, demand patterns, product population). 
DecisionTime and WhatIf? software puts forecasting power in hands of decision mak-
ers.
SPSS Inc. (Chicago; www.spss.com) will launch its new time-series
forecasting software system, DecisionTime and WhatIf?, in September. The
package combines the advanced analytics traditionally found in tools de-
signed for skilled analysts with the ease of use found in tools designed for
general business users. The combination enables inventory managers and
materials managers to use the power of forecasting to make better business
decisions. DecisionTime and WhatIf? address the capacity to build models
and make them accessible to more users throughout an organization. The
list price for a single user license of DecisionTime (includes one copy of
WhatIf ?) is $1,999.

Best Inventory Management Tips

Eliminate inventory ownership.
“We have migrated from company-managed
inventory at our company warehouses to using distributors,” says a purchas-
ing and logistics manager at a large manufacturer of communications equip-
ment. “In essence, it has eliminated our ownership of the investment. Ad-
ditionally, this approach saves us approximately $3 million annually in
junking expenses associated with obsolete inventory. We’ve also been able
to improve our delivery performance.”
Create an inventory control position.
“We created a new position for us, that
of an inventory control clerk,” reports a warehouse manager at a soft drink
bottling facility. The inventory control clerk focuses her efforts entirely on
inventory management, controls, and daily variances. The warehouse man-
ager requested the new position because he no longer has the appropriate
time to control inventory variances. The new clerk now allows the ware-
house manager to focus on management and proactive areas for the four-
plus hours it previously took him to do the inventory report. The position
pays $32,000 per year but is expected to more than pay for itself with cuts in
losses and improved accuracy.
Use ABC analysis to gain control over the more expensive inventories.
“We had
to have more control over our top-dollar inventories, so we began by doing
an ABC analysis of the high-value stock,” explains a materials manager at a
large producer of electronics products for aircraft. “We have taken our $40
668

million inventory and reduced it by more than $9 million in less than one
year. Naturally, inventory turns have also increased because of this,” he de-
tails. “Another beneﬁt has been a reduction in the number of planners, from
15 to 8.” They have centralized the planners, who are now focusing on the
A items by commodity. During this year, they are planning to bring B items
under control. “We have one planner for C items, and do not plan to con-
trol these any tighter,” he relates.
Tighten control on inventory stock.
An inventory control analyst at a midsize
manufacturer of components for the natural gas transmission industry re-
lates, “We went to work focusing on reducing our safety stock and lessen-
ing our min/max levels.” The reorders are now based on one to three
months of usage, decreasing the handling of materials and overhead associ-
ated with storing these materials. “Also, use of an ABC management strat-
egy has helped in the identiﬁcation of scrap/surplus materials,” she explains.
New layout, new software boost pick rate 300%.
The operations manager at a
small provider of vitamin supplements rearranged the warehouse to ﬁt the
80/20 rule and is using rolling racks as well as realigning the old racks. “We
also installed a new computer system that dramatically improved our oper-
ations and enabled us to manage our inventory much better,” he shares.
“Now, with all of the changes in place, instead of picking only a few orders
at a time, we have the capability of picking up to 21 orders with cart/pick
list.”
Manage usage rates better.
“We implemented this practice by ﬁrst making a
thorough study of the usage patterns throughout the facility,” maintains a
material planning specialist at a midsize manufacturer of electronic equip-
ment. “We also established a close relationship with suppliers to cut down
on the lead time to our plant, which in turn reduced the safety stock we re-
quired.” The result of these initiatives, she notes, is a 12% reduction in in-
ventory, representing about $40,000 in savings per month.
Reorganize the stock.
“The biggest inventory control idea that we imple-
mented was to organize our stock so we could ﬁnd it,” acknowledges a pur-
chasing agent at a small manufacturer of restaurant equipment. “We bought
more shelving, tagged each aisle, spread out the items to see them easier, put
everything within easy reach, and made sure every item was bagged and
tagged,” she describes. “We saved payroll on inventory day when it took
Best Inventory Management Tips
669

only two hours, instead of eight, to complete the physical.” On a $250,000
inventory, they came within $1,600 of unaccounted items. “This was the
most accurate we’ve ever been, and the new arrangement helps the parts de-
partment do their job better.”
Drive management of inventory down to the part number.
“We’ve increased our
inventory turns by 67% since the material schedulers began to manage in-
ventory at the part number level,” reports a material resource leader at a large
company building midrange diesel engines. “Min/max windows per part
number were established and managed. We also did daily sweeps of geo-
graphical areas by predetermined core carrier base to pick-up at window
times at the supplier and deliver to the warehouse at predetermined window
times.” They also implemented pull signals of empty trailers to pull another
full trailer into the plant. Overall, purchased components were reduced by
$10.6 million.
Establish A, B, C classiﬁcations for all inventories.
A division purchasing man-
ager at a large producer of bronze memorials has classiﬁed all inventories at
all their division plants into A, B, and C categories and has established max-
imum inventory levels for each of the classiﬁcations. “We now monitor our
buyers’ responses to these objectives on a monthly and year-to-date basis,”
he explains. Total inventory reduction attributed to this methodology last
ﬁscal year was in excess of $500,000.
Establish an electronic kanban.
The materials director at a small contract
manufacturer signed a supply agreement with a major electronic distributor.
“With this agreement we also have established an electronic kanban process
for approximately 100 of our high-volume repetitive items. To date, our
major savings have come from inventory reductions, which in some cases has
been upwards of 40%,” he offers.
Move to a synchronous ﬂow manufacturing concept.
According to a material
manager at a small manufacturer of ﬂexible packaging, “Since our move to
synchronous ﬂow manufacturing, our order lead times have fallen signiﬁ-
cantly.” In a matter of three months they reduced their ﬁnished goods in-
ventory by 30% and WIP by 25%. “The move to shorter order lead times
for customer orders has required us to increase our on-hand raw materials
inventory slightly, which has been more than offset by the reduction in WIP
and ﬁnished goods,” he explains. “Customer lead times are shorter than our
670
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

raw materials lead times now.” They’re now in the process of resolving the
raw materials inventory situation by developing historical raw material fore-
casts and looking into consignment programs.
Implement an auto-replenishment process.
“Moving to auto-replenishment of
inventory against a blanket purchase order places the burden of inventory
management on the supplier,” maintains a materials manager at a small pro-
ducer of test equipment for the broadcast industry. “This has relieved the
buyer from the responsibility of having to pull in or push out these items.”
He also reports that since the auto-replenishment system has been put in
place, inventory turns have “increased dramatically on 250 of the 300 parts
currently assigned to auto-replenishment.” 
Adopt a team-oriented sales and operations planning (S&OP) process.
The
worldwide materials manager at a large producer of chemicals shares, “Our
primary challenge has been the reduction of slow-moving, off-spec materi-
als.” To accomplish this, they ensure that all of the functions serving on the
S&OP team, which includes materials management, production, and mar-
keting, understand the cost/value of this inventory. They also ensure that
they work together to develop a joint plan to sell at discount, rework, or dis-
pose of this inventory. “Their activities are now included as part of every
monthly planning meeting,” he notes. To date, they have reduced inventory
investment by 33%.
Switch to third-party logistics.
“Using their expertise and automated systems,
we have better visibility of what we have where,” reports a logistics manager
at a small manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and systems. “We
also are using the same provider to set up our own distribution facility, which
will allow us to order closer to the forecast, store sufﬁcient equipment in a
single location, cut long lead times, and improve our ability to meet market
requirements at minimal cost. Since the nature of our business does not lend
itself to JIT [ just-in-time], this is the best approach for us,” he describes.
Reduce assembly run size.
The manufacturing vice president at a midsize
sporting goods manufacturer has ﬁnally realized success in convincing his
multiple plant production departments that “overruns are costly, distracting,
and a major component of causing high inventory levels.” Since getting the
production departments to reduce assembly run size, the company now has
achieved the joint beneﬁts of producing more different models per month,

while reducing their ﬁnished goods inventories. In a period of 12 months,
he shares, “We have reduced our WIP inventory by 60%.”
Shift inventory ownership to key suppliers.
“We have leveraged our volume of
inventoried MRO items by using fewer sources and requiring they provide
us with higher levels of value-added service in return for the increased vol-
ume,” explains the purchasing manager at a large maker of packaging prod-
ucts. “We’ve shifted inventory ownership and management responsibility to
these few, key suppliers.” Among the value-added services they now provide
are additional technical expertise from the suppliers, point of use delivery, and
continuous replenishment of appropriate inventory. Cost savings are averag-
ing up to 20%, which is being attributed to the increased leverage, he notes.
Gain inventory management visibility at the top.
“We launched an effort to
convince executive management to look at competitive and industry inven-
tory turns by calculating what effect a potential increase in turns would do
to net income and cash ﬂow,” explains a vice president of operations and lo-
gistics at a major provider of health care products. “Additionally, we identi-
ﬁed improvement opportunities in each business sector and region, priori-
tizing each based on estimated beneﬁts, difﬁculty to complete, and resources
needed.” Each prioritized item was then managed as a project to include
leadership, resource allocation, milestones, and follow-up. Results are re-
viewed monthly by the senior management team, and the “top-down” mes-
sages about inventory are noticed by staff.
Focus on inventory accuracy.
“Inventory accuracy had traditionally carried a
very low priority in our organization,” acknowledges a materials manager at
a midsize manufacturer of turbines for the utility industry. “I had to do a very
hard sell within the organization to ﬁnally get recognition of the importance
of maintaining accurate inventory records and to obtain the resources to get
it done. We put together a program which gave us our best physical inven-
tory in years, coupled with a greatly upgraded cycle count program. As our
inventory accuracy improves, our inventory is being reduced, and we no
longer buy materials that are already on the shelf,” he details.
Enlist top management support for inventory reduction efforts.
“It’s not so much
an idea as it is a culture change,” believes a senior vice president at a small
wire and cable distribution facility. “Senior management is taking a much
more active role in the initial stages of planned reduction initiatives. We’ve
672
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

found that with the support from the top, the inventory reduction process
we already have in place is driven to a much more effective level. The mes-
sage is well understood by all,” he explains.
Address slow-moving and obsolete inventory.
“Using our warehouse manage-
ment system [WMS], we identiﬁed codes that had not sold within six
months and those that had greater than six months supply,” says the director
of logistics at a large provider of consumer medical supplies. “This helped us
to eliminate a lot of non-value-added inventory. The result was a 20% re-
duction in ﬂoor space requirements, and some 10 days of on-hand supply,
for some impressive dollar savings,” he maintains.
Analyze all SKUs.
“We analyze all our SKUs and then classify them A
through E,” notes a director of material at a small manufacturer of commu-
nications equipment. “We then try to understand the production rationale
behind the slow movers and the multiple locations to which these are sent,”
she explains. By reducing the lot sizes of the slow-moving inventory and
holding them in a central location, the director anticipates saving more than
$3.5 million in inventory carrying costs alone.
Create a corporate inventory team.
“We assembled a cross-functional, cross-
plant team to develop a set of standard inventory procedures that would be
universally implemented across the corporation,” says a purchasing manager
at a midsize injection molder. Team members include the inventory man-
agers from each of the six plant locations, along with representatives from
purchasing, quality assurance, accounting, and engineering. Other appro-
priate department representatives also serve on the team. “Their task is to
develop and implement inventory practices that will be followed in all our
facilities,” she explains. To start the process, the team met with all depart-
ments that have an impact on inventory or are affected by inventory. “The
goal is to achieve accurate and timely inventory data, and to ensure that the
database is also up-to-date.”
Implement a “pull” process through the supply chain.
“Our component suppli-
ers have bonded franchised material at our contract manufacturer,” offers the
vice president of materials at a midsize manufacturer of communications di-
agnostic systems. “The contract manufacturer does not begin producing un-
til triggered by a shipment from us to the customer.” Once they receive an
empty storage bin, the contract manufacturer has ﬁve days to assemble and
Best Inventory Management Tips
673

deliver the material, replenishing the material used by the shipment to the
customer. “Upon our receipt of the assembled circuit packs, POs are elec-
tronically generated for all the components used to manufacture them, then
automatically received, and simultaneously matched for payment,” he de-
tails. “These orders are sent via EDI [electronic data interchange] to our sup-
pliers, notifying them of consumption as well as the payment coming to
them.” In its ﬁrst year, inventory turns jumped 35%, and inventory levels
have been sliced 30% without stockouts.
Share schedules with suppliers.
“We make our production schedules available
to suppliers via EDI,” offers the director of materials at a small manufacturer
of communications equipment. “The actual release of orders is on a ‘pull’
basis to satisfy ﬁrm customer demand. This greatly reduces inventory on
hand to support the forecast,” he explains. “Inventory is brought in because
it has already been sold.” Inventory turns have accelerated to a new high of
7.0 from the previous high of 4.6 turns per year, he relates.
Work with suppliers to reduce lead time.
“We’ve begun an initiative that in-
cludes creating a measurement system of supplier performance at the item
level and monitoring the variances,” explains an inventory manager at a large
manufacturer of industrial machinery. This is combined with the reporting
of customer backorders on these items that are created by late deliveries or
the inventory impact of deliveries that are too early. “This type of informa-
tion carries a lot of impact in our detailed supplier discussions,” he relates.
Shift inventory to supplier.
“This was actually accomplished through con-
signment inventory held at our location,” says a materials manager at a small
producer of carbon and graphite specialties. There are several advantages to
having the supplier own the inventory. “Lead time is reduced to zero, in-
ventory carrying costs are almost nonexistent, and lost production time
waiting for incoming quality approval is eliminated,” the materials manager
itemizes. In addition, lower pricing has been negotiated in exchange for a
long-term supply agreement.

Deﬁning slow moving parts for new products.
“An area that doesn’t get much
thought is slow-moving parts when we introduce new products,” according
674
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

to Marvin D. Cope, director of parts operations, Customer Service, Maytag
Appliances Sales Company (Newton, Iowa; mcope@maytag.com). To
eliminate guessing on establishing a service parts inventory without a cur-
rent failure history, he advised attendees at INTERLOG (Worldwide Busi-
ness Research; New York; www.wbresearch.com) to (1) tune into engi-
neering for data on predictive failures for individual parts; (2) focus on
functional parts because these determine whether the unit will operate or
not and are more critical to the customer than cosmetic items; (3) commu-
nicate throughout the supply chain and let parts distributors and service con-
tractors know what is happening and what to expect; and (4) set safety stock
levels with review dates. 
Reverse logistics, cash ﬂow, and inventory management.
One of the emerging
challenges impacting inventory management is how to get reverse logistics
parts back so they can be reused without building inventory and avoiding new
purchases. One solution comes from Ken N. Shaw, director of inventory man-
agement, worldwide service logistics, NCR (Peachtree City, Ga.; ken.shaw@
peachtreecityga.ncr.com). “At NCR we create an inventory charge to the ser-
vices organization when they don’t return a part, either new or used, in ﬁve
days,” he explained at INTERLOG (Worldwide Business Research; New
York; www.wbresearch.com). The fee charged is 2% of the price of the part
per month. “The key is we don’t give them a budget, so it’s a pure charge to
their local organization P&L,” Shaw tells Inventory Reduction Report. “We do
get all sorts of emphasis to get the parts returned.” It is effective, besides. “At
one point we had $15 million in new and used returns. It’s now down to
$350,000,” he shares. An indirect beneﬁt is improved data accuracy.
Six ways to improve inventory control of dangerous substances.
To prevent gen-
erating hazardous waste, control the size of your chemical inventory, advises
an inventory manager at a specialty chemicals facility. From her own expe-
rience, she advises the following: (1) Manage all inventory at one central lo-
cation; (2) buy small containers of materials that have limited shelf life; (3)
use a waste-exchange program for disposing of surplus usable materials; (4)
arrange to return surplus material to the supplier; (5) purchase materials in
returnable containers, or recycle the container; and (6) make sure the sup-
plier allows return of damaged containers or products.

Corporation, cautions inventory managers: “Increasingly we’re ﬁnding as
we look at supply chain management issues that where you do work and
where you store those materials around the world will directly affect the
taxes you pay not only to the U.S., but other countries as well. We need to
start looking at the tax consequences of engineering and supply chain deci-
sions that we propose,” he declared.
Managing inventory by segmenting it into “buckets” of opportunity.
Rose Drolett,
manager of materials inventory and catalog at Equistar Chemical, LLP (Hous-
ton; rosem.drolett@equistarchem.com), has developed a creative method-
ology to “get the inventory management message” through to department
managers. “You must analyze the inventory and segregate it into various seg-
ments for them,” she explained at a recent MRO Cost Management Strat-
egies Conference (Institute of International Research; New York). For
example, frequently used consumables are “zone store” candidates. “The
low-cost items are placed in ‘free’ bins right where it’s to be used,” she offers.
In addition, high-dollar, multiple-turn materials are ideal for consignment
initiatives with your suppliers. “Here you have to shrink your supply base and
increase volume with those remaining,” Drolett advises. Excess inventory
should be put up for resale or redeployed. “Move everybody to an appropri-
ate min/max level, after which they have the responsibility to control the in-
ventory. And critical spares should be shared,” she advises.
Career advice for women logisticians.
Kathleen Strange, director of logis-
tics strategy and implementation at Staples Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.;
kathleen.strange@staples.com) and president of Council of Logistics Man-
agement (CLM; Oak Brook, Ill.), shared with a predominantly female au-
dience at a recent annual conference, “I think that women have an interest-
ing opportunity right now, in that competition will be far more ability-based
and include what kinds of technical skills you have. I can’t emphasize tech-
nology enough, and I see a generation coming up that has a much quicker
grasp of how technology works. But, the higher up you go, the better your
presentation skills need to be, and the better sales person you have to be-
come,” she counseled.
An inventory management partnership to reduce inventory.
Electronic com-
merce tools enable Michelin North America (Greenville, S.C.) to create in-
ventory management partnerships with a “selected group of capable and
676
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

committed customers,” according to Lynn Melvin (lynn.melvin@us.
michelin.com), application development manager of electronic commerce.
“The goal is to shorten process cycles, which will lower inventory levels sig-
niﬁcantly,” she told a National Association of Purchasing Management
(NAPM) Electronic Commerce conference. The customers electronically
provide product sell outs, inventory levels, and desired ﬁll-rate levels. “To-
gether, we create inventory models tailored to customer’s business and re-
plenishment schedules,” she describes. The Michelin models recommend a
suggested order, which the customer can approve and submit. “There have
been some great inventory savings achieved, but there’s also a cost involved,
as it requires extensive back-end integration,” Melvin warns.
Activity-based costing to play more prominent role in inventory management.
As
inventory managers increase their focus on managing costs across the supply
chain, activity-based costing will assume greater application. In their quest
to know their cost structures better, inventory managers are getting down to
the SKU level in their costing calculations. For instance, at the CLM Annual
Conference, Terrance L. Pohlen, chief of the business analysis ofﬁce at De-
fense Supply Center (Columbus, Ohio; terrance_pohlen@dscc.dla.mil),
observed, “They want to capture the cost of rolling out full pallets of an SKU
to one customer, versus the difference of sending mixed pallets or very small
orders to another customer for the same product.” The goal, he relates, is to
capture these cost differences down to the individual customer, and then to
begin an initiative to eliminate them.
Use third-party providers to gather benchmarking data.
“When I need assistance
I often go back to my third-party providers to help me get benchmark data,”
reveals Lorraine Lesher, logistics commodity manager at Tektronix, Inc.
(Beaverton, Ore.; lorraine.lesher@tek.com). “We outsource within the lo-
gistics organization such functions as interplant ﬂeet movement, receiving,
freight payment, claims, and all transportation movement. All these differ-
ent providers are really an extension of our logistics organization, so it’s im-
portant to go and talk with them ﬁrst when about to benchmark,” she
explained at the Proven Performance Metrics in Logistics conference (spon-
sored by Institute for International Research; New York). “If you have your
business partner working with you to help you evaluate your organization,
you’ll be a lot more successful in ensuring what areas you want to address
and change.”

Inventory managers’ shifting paradigm: from inventory management to value collab-
oration.
“We’ve focused on moving the material, but now we’re being
challenged to look at the intellectual asset ﬂow because the material may
never come inside our company,” observes Lee Seaton, director of collabo-
rative business solutions at Hewlett-Packard (Cupertino, Calif.). At the
Supply-Chain Council’s Supply Chain World, he explained, “It’s now a col-
laborative model. When we think of people in a collaborative relationship,
this requires a rethinking of not only how we’re going to interact with them,
but we also must deﬁne what kind of information we’re going to share, and
what the basis of that sharing is going to be,” Seaton explains.

Utility Looks to Demand Planning Tool to Reduce Inventory
Situation:
The director of inventory control at a gas utility noted that
“other departments were held ﬂat on their budgets for operat-
ing goods. Meanwhile, our budget for hard goods was slashed
annually for ﬁve years, so we had to operate much more efﬁ-
ciently.”
Problem:
“One way to reduce costs was to tighten inventory control,”
he acknowledges. “We typically inventory steel ﬁttings, plastic
ﬁttings, steel pipe, plastic pipe, valves, regulators, and other
day-to-day necessities for our business.” The goal, he relates,
was to reduce inventory by moving turnover rates from once
or twice per year to at least four times per year.
Solution:
“We needed a forecasting tool to analyze our ﬁnancial data,”
the director reports. The choice was a demand planning sys-
tem (Prescient Systems; www.prescientsystems.com) that
would tightly integrate with lawson.insight (Lawson Software;
www.lawson.com) already in place. According to the director,
the Prescient solution uses data from lawson.insight to answer
questions such as Has the item been in the warehouse too
long? Does our organization use the item any longer, and what
are we doing with it? “Our inventory turns have moved up,
and we now stock 2,100 parts, down from the previous 2,400,”
he explains. In addition, the accuracy of orders to suppliers has
improved, and lead times and transportation costs have been
678
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

reduced. “The most impressive change is that our warehouse
operations are now handled centrally,” he notes.
Enterprise Resource Planning Software Suite Provides
More Informative Inventory Management 
Situation:
A large manufacturer of portable air compressors produces a
large variety of units with a variety of optional engines, while
also providing complete support and service for all products,
both in-house and in the ﬁeld, according to the materials man-
ager.
Problem:
“We required a more informative system to manage our in-
ventory so we could be more cost-effective in replenishing our
inventory and reschedule material plans accordingly,” he ex-
plains.
Solution: 
“We recently installed INFIMACS II enterprise resource
planning software suite [Relevant Business Systems; www.
relevant.com], with the material requirements planning mod-
ule,” the materials manager offers. “It allows us to get a hold of
our inventory levels, thus keeping payables in balance with
cash, making us more ﬂexible. The module provides a mate-
rial plan that meets our production schedule, taking into ac-
count lead times and in-process cycle times for parts and as-
semblies.” It also plans work orders and purchase requisitions.
100% Radio Frequency–Directed Warehouse System
Increases Accuracy to 99.5%
Situation: A leading cable and wire distributor restructured several of its
warehouses throughout the country to improve their level of
customer service, according to the regional distribution center
manager.
Problem:
“In the past we used competing agents to distribute our prod-
ucts,” he explains. “Today, the agents have been replaced by
company-owned regional distribution centers which carry
our full product range.”
Solution:
“It’s been a two-year project, and we’ve put in place Logis-
tics PRO [Intrepa LLC; www.intrepa.com] in all ﬁve of
the regional DCs [distribution centers],” he notes. “Since
Best Inventory Management Tips
679

implementing the solution, we have increased inventory ac-
curacy to 99.52%, and increased our shipping accuracy to
99.57%.” The distribution centers use the software’s functions,
such as radio frequency functionality for pallet consolidation,
demand-only replenishment, pick-to-workload instead of
pick-to-unit, and the ability to conﬁgure multiple reserved
dock areas per carrier. Additionally, since the operations are
100% RF directed, the facility is paperless, eliminating pick-
sheets and picking labels within the warehouse. The manager
notes one additional beneﬁt: “All potential resource allocation
trouble areas are highlighted for a warehouse supervisor, al-
lowing them to be proactive instead of reactive.”
Service Planning Software Reduces Excess Inventories 
Situation:
According to an inventory analyst at a major computer manu-
facturer, its philosophy is to provide next-business day service
to the majority of its customers. “Our service logistics group
provides the majority of this support through forecasting,
planning, and deploying items like hard drives, power supplies,
keyboards, and cables for our customers,” she relates. 
Problem:
“Service level is our primary concern,” the analyst declares.
“We also must focus on our bottom-line contribution to the
proﬁt and loss statement. The amount of money we spend on
new material is also critical. Therefore, the repair process and
the way we manage repair inventory is crucial, because it is
generally more cost-effective to repair than to buy new ma-
terial,” she explains. 
Solution:
“We implemented XelusPlan [Xelus, Inc., Fairport, N.Y.;
www.xelus.com] so our planners could quickly handle the
6,000-plus service orders that ﬂow throughout the facility
daily,” the analyst notes. “The new software supports our drive
to avoid technological obsolescence and excess inventory of
component parts.” XelusPlan forecasts parts and identiﬁes any
excess inventory to that forecast. “This may be excess inven-
tory that we need to work down, or we may determine that
we have extended contracts with certain customers and need
to maintain that inventory,” she explains. “In addition, the
680
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

software provides us with analysis tools so planners can classify
the different reasons excess inventory occurred.” 
Vendor-Managed Inventory Process Brings Common Sense
to Inventory Management 
Situation:
The manager of inventory and procurement at a midsize man-
ufacturer of commercial security systems reveals that he was
hired to lead the reengineering efforts of the organization’s in-
ventory and purchasing operation. 
Problem:
“We faced a new level of the classic inventory management
challenge, that of having parts for manufacturing products in
stock while keeping inventory low, because customers now
want in two or three days what they used to want in two to
three weeks,” he shares. Additionally, the JIT approach was not
an option because of the number of the division’s suppliers and
the specialty engineered parts required. 
Solution:
“Our team adopted a vendor-managed inventory system in
which suppliers own the inventory that is stored at our facility
until it is used,” he explains. To date, more than one-half of the
suppliers are participating. Beneﬁts to suppliers are that they
are paid in one to ﬁve days and that they have better control
for planning and forecasting. The team also created a com-
puter program that provides descriptive, historical, and pricing
information for each part the division buys. For example, it
now buys six months worth of one-cent rivets that are used in
many assembly operations, while the inventory and purchas-
ing group spends more time managing the complex, high-cost
inventory items, such as circuit boards. 
Forecast Software Solution Improves Control
of More Than 2,000 SKUs 
Situation:
A materials manager at a leading producer of household clean-
ing products wanted to ensure that its supply chain had the
most accurate information to “perform smoothly.” 
Problem:
A result of a recent merger was that each organization was us-
ing a different statistical forecasting package. “With more than
Best Inventory Management Tips
681

2,000 SKUs to manage, and the executive focus on increasing
cross-selling opportunities, forecasting became even more
crucial,” he relates. 
Solution:
They selected the ForecastX Wizard (John Galt Solutions,
Inc., Chicago; www.johngalt.com) to deﬁne a new forecast-
ing process. “We have witnessed an increase in the company’s
dollar-weighted monthly forecast accuracy from an average
71% to an average 84% within the ﬁrst three months of imple-
mentation,” he details. “We now have better control over in-
ventory levels.”
Warehouse Management Software Reduces On-Hand
Inventory Levels to Days from Months
Situation:
“A couple of years ago we began a thorough review of our
manufacturing and logistics programs,” describes the opera-
tions vice president at a major manufacturer of hydraulic hose
and related components. “We also had 13 distribution centers
located throughout North America.”
Problem:
“With thousands of SKUs in these distribution centers, our
analysis revealed that we too often had the parts required by
the customer at some other location,” he acknowledges. Ad-
ditionally, the combination of how products were manufac-
tured and the number of distribution centers meant that the
company had an average of 192 days of inventory on hand 
Solution:
To reduce inventory, the company changed the way some of
the products were manufactured and simultaneously began to
reduce the number of DCs. A 100,000 square foot central dis-
tribution facility located adjacent to the major manufacturing
site replaced more than 500,000 square feet of distribution
space in 13 separate facilities. An automated warehouse and
inventory control system (Robocom Systems International;
Massapequa, N.Y.; www.robocom.com) manages and inte-
grates ﬁnal assembly processes with distribution systems, keeps
track of 17,000 part numbers, and helps ship 6,000 lines items
per day. Inventory levels also have been reduced from more
than six months to just days, with greater accuracy and on-
time delivery.

Improved Forecasting Accuracy Slices Excess
Inventory of Perishable Product
Situation:
A major provider of fruit juices focused efforts on lowering its
inventory levels as “even a small improvement in inventory
levels in our high-volume product signiﬁcantly impacts our
bottom line,” says the manager of logistics development. 
Problem:
“We developed weekly forecasts for about 1,500 line items, of-
ten requiring our people to work 60 days straight without a
day off trying to get the forecasts right,” he explains.
Solution:
Today, the forecasting process obtains data by weekly sales by
customer by SKU/by distribution center from ﬁve geographic
areas. These are brought into the new forecasting technology
(Prescient Systems, West Chester, Pa.; www.prescientsystems.
com) along with monthly numbers from ﬁnancial planning.
“Forecasts are developed by logistics, both short-term (two to
ﬁve weeks) and long-term (six to 104 weeks) in about three
days,” he relates. The improvement in the forecasting and con-
tinuous replenishment programs has reduced inventory 20%
and improved inventory turns 27%, all of which translates into
a better bottom line. 
Auto ID, Bar Codes Combine to Improve
Inventory Accuracy for Glass Manufacturer
Situation:
A glass manufacturer supplying the automotive industry ships
to repair and installation facilities from a central warehouse
that contains hundreds of different sizes, colors, and shapes of
windows, windshields, and automotive glass in inventory.
Problem:
“We were losing customers because our distribution center
could not meet delivery requirements on time,” mentions the
warehouse manager. “With hundreds of glass parts to choose
from, workers found it difﬁcult to pick the right type of glass
when required. The situation was complicated when we hired
temporary works during peak demand seasons.”
Solution:
“Our team opted for a methodology where workers could
easily identify each piece of glass and determine its exact lo-
cation so that picking and shipping operations could be
Best Inventory Management Tips
683

improved,” he explains. The solution included portable RF
bar code data collection devices and thermal transfer bar code
printers. “When product is received, each is labeled with the
corresponding qualities [color, shape, size, strength] and
tracked as it is moved into the distribution center. Any inven-
tory movements, whether for internal moves or picks, are
recorded in real time and updated regularly.” He estimates that
hardware investment will be returned within 18 months.
Supply Chain Planning Technology Reduces
Inventory Levels, Planning Cycle Times
Situation:
A project manager at a large manufacturer of eye care products
explains that the planning function is centralized at its head-
quarters location while manufacturing and distribution are
global with plants and DCs located in North America, Europe,
and Asia.
Problem:
“We have a lot of sites and we transfer a lot of product and ma-
terials from site to site,” he explains. “Our existing materials
requirement planning [MRP] system does not generate a plan
that is materials- or capacity-feasible. It doesn’t look across the
site to determine where material shortfalls or surpluses and im-
balances might exist,” he details.
Solution:
“We looked for a tool that would develop a feasible plan out of
the box and eliminate people having to go in and adjust for these
factors that MRP didn’t care about,” the project manager ex-
plains. The answer was found with PeopleSoft Enterprise Plan-
ning (PeopleSoft, Inc., Pleasanton, Calif.; www.peoplesoft.com),
which temporarily has been running with the company’s home-
grown MRP system and a legacy inventory application. When
the implementation is complete, everything will run on the
PeopleSoft solution. Shortening the planning cycle and optimiz-
ing supply chain planning, the project manager estimates that in-
ventory reduction across the supply chain will be about $10 mil-
lion. So far, ﬁnished goods stocking is down by $2 million. With
the last pieces of the PeopleSoft system in place, the entire supply
chain will be modeled, and most of the inventory reduction will
come from eliminating imbalances in the supply chain.

Warehouse Management System Brings Efﬁciency
to New Distribution Center Operations
Situation: A large producer of lift trucks recently opened a DC speciﬁ-
cally for the receiving, inspection, storing, parts consolidation,
and shipping of its products. The 71,000 square foot facility
houses parts for the local manufacturing facility and its after-
market support centers.
Problem:
“This arrangement and the volume of tasks, which total more
than 6,500 per day, call for a technologically advanced inven-
tory tracking system,” the warehouse manager shares.
Solution:
“A Robocom Inventory Management System [Robocom Sys-
tems International; Massapequa, N.Y.; www.robocom.com]
operates the task-oriented system that tracks more than 52,000
parts in the warehouse,” he reveals. All parts are placed on stor-
age-bound skids, which are tagged using Code 39 symbology.
The identifying “license plates” on each skid display order
number, part number locations, description, and quantity.
They are scanned for storage assignment before being placed
on 45-foot-high bay racks. When orders are received, the parts
are picked from storage and scanned before being placed on
another skid. The new system allows the manufacturer to
troubleshoot potential problem areas by providing accurate
inventory information. Workload planning reports mean that
personnel bottlenecks are avoided; in addition, stack-ups in
the consolidation areas are eliminated.
Optimization Solution Cuts Inventory by More Than Half,
Lowers Carrying Costs, Too
Situation:
The logistics vice president at a leading manufacturer of
plumbing ﬁxtures and supplies explains that “for years we’ve
been trying to discern some kind of buying pattern, but order
volume remains highly unpredictable, and is often dependent
on the weather.”
Problem:
“Customers are no longer willing to stock inventory, and they
want just-in-time delivery with the product being shipped
within 24 to 48 hours of their order,” he explains.

Solution:
“We implemented a GAINS supply chain optimization solu-
tion [GAINSystems, Naperville, Ill.; www.gainstech.com] be-
cause it could not only forecast demand, but link into replen-
ishment and stocking to allow us a clearer view of our return
on investment,” he details. “We now can accurately forecast
100% of our manufactured products and commit to shipping
them within two days. And we still have been able to reduce
our inventory investment by 52%.”
WMS Installation Improves Inventory Accuracy to Over 99%
Situation:
The production control manager at a major manufacturer of
communications equipment explains that the organization re-
mains focused on developing wireless technology. It also op-
erates a world-class manufacturing facility.
Problem:
With over 2.5 million square feet of manufacturing and
warehousing space, there is a mobility challenge. “When you
talk about the need for mobility, you’re talking about the
need for current information,” he relates. The people who
are walking or driving around the warehouse selecting ma-
terial have been relying on batched information that was at
least 24 hours old.
Solution:
“We implemented an RF Navigator warehouse management
system [Majure Data, Inc.; Norcross, Ga.; www.majuredata.
com] to handle the storage and shipment of the more than
50,000 telecommunications products the plant manufactures,”
the production control manager reports. It interfaces with the
company’s MRP II system. RF Navigator receives customer
orders from the MRP II system and executes the receiving,
storage, picking, and shipping processes. The inventory data
tracked by the WMS are updated immediately and continually
during each stage of operations. Further, when an operator
needs a certain material, he scans or enters the JIT number for
that material. The JIT number represents a standard quantity,
SKU, and delivery location. The WMS either knows that the
material is in the storeroom and requisitions it, or sends an EDI
request to an outside supplier. The WMS tracks raw materials
and records the location of stored products in real time. In-

ventory accuracy, which had been 95%, now exceeds 99%.
Further, material handling efﬁciency has improved 20%, and
lead time has been reduced, as well as inventory, by 25%. 
Simulation System Reduces WIP by Almost Half
Situation:
An industrial engineer at a major automobile assembly facility
reveals that it is too difﬁcult to manipulate the manufacturing
system according to different production strategies.
Problem:
“There was an excess of WIP throughout the assembly facil-
ity,” he relates.
Solution:
“We looked to a simulation study to help us understand the
causes of changes in variables on our WIP,” he explains. Pro-
Model (ProModel Corporation; 888-776-6633) was the solu-
tion used to gain an insight into the relationships among dif-
ferent variables. “Running experiments of the scenarios
helped to set the rules for the production system to improve
productivity,” he shares. “An insight was gained for under-
standing the relationships between WIP and the others such as
lead times of pieces, lot sizes, and setup times.” As a result of the
modeling effort, there was a 48% average reduction of WIP 
in the plant.
Third-Party Provider Helps to Slash Inventory Investment
by $1 Million
Situation:
A logistics coordinator at a large provider of computer services
for automobile retailers provides turnkey systems, software so-
lutions, and consulting services and must meet 24/7, 4-hour
client delivery requirements.
Problem:
“Recent changes in the computer networks of automotive
dealers dictate that next-day delivery of critical computer
components is no longer a viable option, as they now need
same-day support,” he explains. “They can’t afford to keep
their computers down for a day.”
Solution:
SonicAir, a UPS Logistics Group company (www.sonicair.
com), was engaged to provide the solution. “We gained
access to warehouse and same-day distribution support

24-hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, through their global net-
work of 400 forward stocking locations,” he reports. In addi-
tion, “We now have a better handle on our inventory costs
and have reduced our inventory carrying charges by $1 mil-
lion,” he explains.
Simulation Solutions Provides Greater Inventory Alternatives
Situation:
An inventory manager at a major producer of communica-
tions network components explains the organization annually
manufactures one million printed circuit boards, along with
200,000 mechanical assemblies and other products. The size
of their inventory provides a challenge, he notes, as the com-
pany consumes some 550 million separate components each
year.
Problem:
“To improve our customer service, which is critical in our
industry, we frequently challenge ourselves with alternate
scenarios, which often involve inventory matters,” he offers.
Among the questions they seek to answer are, If that order
were canceled, how would that impact our inventory? Or, if
we moved one project back and accelerated another, what
would the impact be on our inventory? “We often did that
kind of work with paper and pencil and calculators,” the in-
ventory manager notes. “It took up to two weeks to do all the
calculations and arrive at an answer.”
Solution:
“We looked for a software package which could do these sim-
ulations, and which would work well with our existing prod-
ucts and methods,” he explains. The solution was found in
webPLAN (webPLAN Corp.; Chicago; www.webplan.com).
“We can now have that analysis completed in less than four
hours,” he explains. “The accuracy level has increased, and we
have more conﬁdence in the results, because we’re dealing
with much more contemporary data.” The amount of time
spent planning and considering alternative scenarios has been
reduced by 50%, and the analysis of their ability to meet de-
livery dates has been automated. Previously, every component
of an order had to be physically scrutinized and cross-
referenced with inventory.

New Warehouse Management System Drives Inventory
Turns Increase, from Five to Eight
Situation:
A diversiﬁed technology and manufacturing organization
operated a 90,000 square foot warehouse. According to the
warehouse manager, “Inventory turns were about ﬁve, and re-
turns took anywhere from four to six weeks. In addition, or-
ders had a three- to ﬁve-day turnaround, and inventory accu-
racy was in the low 60% area.”
Problem:
Employees used a “time-consuming” card locator system and
“all data was manually entered into our computer system,” he
explains.
Solution:
They selected the ROC v5.0 warehouse management system
(Radcliffe Systems, Inc.; Willowdale, Ontario; www.radsys-
tems.com) that they “customized quite a bit” and use for every
function from the time a product is received to the time it is
shipped out. Since installing ROC, they report that they now
can keep less inventory and save on inventory costs, as smaller
customer inventory orders are the rule. “Customers now are
conﬁdent that we will have the items they need, and that the
orders will be shipped out the same day,” he reports. Today, the
warehouse space is down to 64,000 square feet and houses an
average of 8,500 SKUs. “Receive and putaway functions that
once took four to six days are now a four-hour process,” he
mentions. “Inventory accuracy is now in the high 90s, and the
three- to ﬁve-day order turnaround is now same-day.”
Cycle Counting Eliminates Wall-to-Wall Physical Inventories
Situation:
A logistics manager at a midsize producer of plumbing prod-
ucts sought to improve inventory accuracy and identify the
reasons for errors in inventory levels.
Problem:
“To verify our inventory position, we relied on the traditional
physical inventory practice, which consumed too much time,
didn’t correct the book errors, and didn’t sit too well with our
employees,” the logistics manager concedes.
Solution:
“We looked into adapting a cycle counting procedure,” he
notes. “We concentrated our cycle counting efforts on those
Best Inventory Management Tips
689

SKUs that cause us problems and the ones that had a long
record of inaccuracy. We now count them more frequently
and are seeing accuracy levels improve as we are able to better
identify why the errors are occurring.”
New Warehouse Management System Improves Order Flow,
Inventory Control
Situation:
The 75,000 square foot warehouse at a major producer of
aerospace and industrial products contains almost 25,000
SKUs in over 80,000 possible locations supported by about 75
personnel, according to the material control manager. The
SKUs are primarily stored in one of ﬁve aisles of an automated
storage and retrieval system (AS/RS).
Problem: 
“We were approaching the time when we had to select a new
warehouse management system that would replace our exist-
ing ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out [FIFO] system, and also drive the AS/RS
system,” he relates.
Solution:
They selected the MARC-CS warehouse management sys-
tem (TRW Global Enterprises Solutions, TRW, Inc.; www.
MARCsystems.com) with a new controller code to replace its
former system. “The MARC-CS software does not require
each new receipt to occupy a new location, so like product is
stored in the same location, improving storage utilization and
order processing,” the material control manager explains. “We
now have better warehouse activity control and improved in-
terleaving capabilities related to picking, putaway, and count-
ing tasks.”
Web-Based Collaborative Network Boosts Planning
and Supply Chain Execution
Situation:
“One of our business goals is to improve customer service, and
we believe the answer is through greater accuracy in forecast-
ing and replenishment,” the vice president of a major furniture
company maintains. 
Problem:
“We needed a solution that could be implemented quickly and
is easy to use, while providing a forum for collaborative plan-
ning, forecasting, and replenishment [CPFR],” he reveals.
690
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Solution:
They have decided to participate in a collaborative trading
community (i-Community) designed by Logility Inc. (At-
lanta, Ga.; www.logility.com) for the furniture value chain.
The i-Community (powered by Logility’s Voyager Solutions)
allows organizations to collaborate on sales forecasts and re-
plenishment plans as well as transportation and distribution
center management with trading partners via the Internet.
“We are currently implementing the Voyager Solutions suite,
and we anticipate making signiﬁcant reductions in inventory
and transportation expenses,” the executive explains.
Information Sharing Alleviates Long Lead Time
and Inventory Management Uncertainties
Situation:
The operations manager at a snack foods manufacturer shares,
“Rapid increases and decreases in our business have resulted in
our being out of stock at one end and having an excessive
amount of inventory on the other.”
Problem:
The too much/too little inventory situation was squeezing
their cash ﬂow. “We needed cash, and the inventory situation
became a target for us,” he reports. However, “not only did we
have a lack of data, we had an absence of data-driven deci-
sions,” he acknowledges. 
Solution: 
While trying to resolve their problem and seeking their sup-
plier’s assistance, they also became aware that the supplier had
similar inventory problems due to the extreme variability of
the snack food manufacturer’s business. “Our joint solution
was to allow our supplier to have visibility into our planning
process,” he notes. “If they could see a year’s worth of our
planning, they could then schedule accordingly.” The answer
lies with a “simple” spreadsheet. The spreadsheet shows the
production schedule for the snacks and the ﬁlm printing. “We
take our production numbers and enter them into the spread-
sheet every Friday and e-mail it to our supplier, who then uses
the information to schedule their press runs.” They also enter
their numbers and e-mail it back to the snack food manufac-
turer on Monday. “The spreadsheet/e-mail tool has opened
our communications, and we’ve both been able to save a sig-
niﬁcant amount in inventory,” he declares.

“Theory of Constraints” Software Feature Decreases
Lead Times and Reduces WIP
Situation:
A major producer of rolling mills for the metal producing in-
dustry builds and assembles parts to exact customer speciﬁca-
tions. According to the materials management director, “We
are a combination mass production operation and make-to-
order job shop.”
Problem:
“When we began to examine ways to improve customer satis-
faction, we came to the realization that we needed to reduce
our WIP inventory and to increase the throughput and veloc-
ity of our manufactured products,” the director explains.
Solution:
“After studying our situation, we decided that we needed a
production scheduling system that provided reliable schedules
but required a minimum of expediting effort,” he explains.
“One of the key reasons we chose the Thru-Put Manufactur-
ing solution [Thru-Put Technologies; www.thru-put.com]
was because of the adoption of the Theory of Constraints in the
software package.” A series of special interfaces were created for
transferring data between the software and the company’s pri-
mary MRP II business system. One interface was the creation
of Demand Stream Driver, a specialized demand application.
Other interfaces facilitate the passing of data, such as BOMs,
routings, and inventory status. “With the Thru-Put solution in
place, we have dramatically decreased the lead times of prod-
ucts while limiting the WIP to only that required for customer
orders,” he reports. “The system has helped us to shrink the
amount of time it takes to build individual parts, which has en-
abled us to lower both WIP and raw materials inventory.”
Locator Capability Helps to Alleviate Major Inventory Problems
Situation:
The inventory manager at a midsize manufacturer of hydraulic
ﬁlters and accessories explains, “We make a commodity prod-
uct with very little differentiation from our competitor.”
Problem:
“We add an average of 10 new products each year,” he notes.
Some are manufactured, whereas others are purchased, pack-
aged, and resold. Since it takes about 36 months to reach peak
692
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

demand, they would carry massive amounts of inventory. For
several months very little product would move off the shelf;
then the demand would be there, but they couldn’t respond to
it quickly.
Solution: 
“We implemented software from Fourth Shift [www.fs.com]
that enabled us to get our arms around our inventory, locate
our inventory, and produce our inventory to order and to fore-
cast,” the inventory manager maintains. “The software solu-
tion we adopted allows us to purchase or manufacture accord-
ing to demand or lead time, and make adjustments as demand
builds.” Instead of “hunting and pecking to ﬁnd the right item,
we can go right to it, whether it is ﬁnished goods for an order,
or an item we need for manufacturing.” The locator system has
helped to move inventory accuracy from the low 80% level to
a consistent 95+% accuracy today.
Reengineering Warehouse Efforts Improves
Raw Material Tracking Accuracy
Situation:
A major manufacturer of timepieces had warehouses that op-
erated independently of each other, according to the director
of operations.
Problem:
Each relied on a paper-based batch system that was supple-
mented by stand-alone PC-based systems. “These systems
were homegrown and not compatible, so data communica-
tions was nonexistent,” he explains. 
Solution:
“We entered into a major reengineering initiative, which was
developed around a new warehouse management system
[Manhattan Associates; www.manhattanassociates.com],” he
explains. “It controls all activities, inventory and order fulﬁll-
ment, and communicates with the conveyor control system,
pick-to-light system, and RF scanners, which are used in the
bin shelving pick area, receiving, and putaway.” The exchange
of data between the various systems is now virtually seamless.
“We are now able to accurately track the ﬂow of raw materi-
als going in and the ﬂow of ﬁnished goods going out of the as-
sembly area,” the director offers. “It also tracks the consump-
tion of raw materials, which provides us with a new level of
control.”

Inventory Control System Slashes SKUs
While Improving Turnover Ratio
Situation:
With 25,000 square feet of space and 9,000 SKUs, a distribu-
tor of builder’s ﬁnished hardware was considering expanding
the facility to handle the extra inventory, according to the or-
ganization’s president.
Problem:
“Over the past year we became aware of the concept of prof-
itability based on movement class and inventory turnover,” he
explains. “This brought to our attention the fact that we just
could not do business the way we had in the past.”
Solution:
“We moved to an automated inventory management system,
which has proved very successful,” the president declares. “We
began by taking all of our buyers and management teams
through a videotaped training process. We were taught that
the way we did A, B, C, D buying is really the opposite of what
we should be doing.” Having 14 item classes and buying by
item class was one way they increased their inventory turn ra-
tio. “The system enabled us to free up hundreds of thousands
of dollars in cash that was tied up in inventory,” he explains.
Further, they now have 8,700 SKUs with ample room avail-
able in the original warehouse. The inventory control system,
on an item-by-item basis, monitors activities on each one, giv-
ing everyone in the company access to all current information.
It also does the company’s forecasting and gives suggested or-
ders that are accurate about 90% of the time, according to the
president.
Warehouse Management System Helps Track
Inventory in Real Time
Situation:
A large distributor of plumbing supplies was in the market for
a solution that would manage warehouse space and inventory
in a real-time environment, according to the director of dis-
tribution. Further, the solution was to be implemented in its
regional warehouses as well.
Problem:
“We have to accommodate random storage needs, efﬁciently
utilize space, and accurately track inventory in real time,” the
manager itemized the requirements. “For large orders we have
694
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

multiple products being picked, and we needed a solution so
as not to jeopardize our customer relationships.”
Solution:
“We’ve installed VIAWARE WMS [Provia Software; Grand
Rapids, Mich.; www.proviasoftware.com] at three of our fa-
cilities, with two more sites scheduled to go live in the next 12
months,” the director explains. “The software has been se-
lected as our corporate standard to streamline our warehouse
and distribution activities. The solution gives us complete vis-
ibility of our product from the moment orders are received
until they are delivered.”
Off-Site Staging Facility Removes Inventory
from Manufacturing Facility
Situation:
The logistics vice president for a major builder of made-to-
order ofﬁce systems launched a supply chain management
study to deliver a competitive advantage in the market.
Problem:
“We have an above-average order cycle time for our industry,”
he acknowledged. The industry standard is six to eight weeks.
Solution:
“We engaged a third-party logistics provider who established
an off-site dedicated storage and staging facility, which man-
ages the raw materials inventory process. The activities include
receiving, storing, and staging almost 70,000 component parts
provided by the manufacturer’s suppliers. In fact, the suppliers
own the material stored at the facility, which saves inventory
carrying costs. “Our third-party provider has real-time visibil-
ity to our production schedules, enabling them to monitor in-
ventory usage rates, gauge how production is proceeding, and
instantly checking on the status of materials being shipped
from the suppliers,” he describes. “Our provider ships materi-
als to our manufacturing site every two hours, enabling us to
maintain a nonstop assembly operation.” This has eliminated
all on-site inventory at the plant. In addition, order cycle time,
an important metric, has been cut to just ﬁve days.
Supplier-Managed Inventory Process Trims

increased share of their customers’ business while maintaining
a focus on reducing its inventory investment.
Problem:
“Traditionally, the industry runs high levels of safety stock to
guard against stockouts, which can delay or even halt produc-
tion,” he explains. Additionally, he notes, “We began a series
of reengineering efforts aimed at reducing costs throughout
the supply chain.”
Solution:
“We created a collaborative concept with several of our sup-
pliers and a few of our key customers in which both the sup-
plier and customer agreed to share appropriate information,”
the inventory control manager comments. The supplier-
managed inventory program that was created has the cus-
tomers providing the chemical manufacturer with a weekly
forecast of planned consumption. “Since we now have a bet-
ter understanding of the customer’s usage pattern, it enables us
to forecast more accurately and replenish on a more timely ba-
sis,” he offers. Further, they also share their production infor-
mation with their primary suppliers in a similar vein. The early
results have been promising. At one customer’s facility, safety
stock inventory was slashed by almost 60%, while crisis ship-
ments have been cut by 80%. The chemical manufacturer also
has seen a reduction in its own inventory levels, as well as more
timely shipments from its primary suppliers.
Outsourcing Tool Crib Operations Improves Inventory
Management, Cuts Costs up to 20%
Situation:
The materials manager at a midsize manufacturer of ball bear-
ings believed that tool room operations had become an un-
necessary burden in time and money.
Problem:
“The situation was out of control, with inventory accuracy a
problem and supplies routinely out of stock, or in short
supply,” he ventured. “And the inventory we carried in the tool
cribs was costly, besides.”
Solution:
“We suggested our MRO supplier take over the management
of the tool cribs and the ownership of its inventory,” the ma-
terials manager explains. “With most of the inventory on con-
signment, and the supplier doing a very cost-effective job
managing this inventory, we’ve experienced savings of about
696
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

20% since the start of the program. With this continuing suc-
cess, we’re now negotiating with the supplier to do some
value-added tasks that will provide us with additional savings,”
he adds.
WMS Boosts Inventory Accuracy by 99% Consistently
Situation:
The vice president of logistics at a computer parts distributor
oversees a 155,000 square foot distribution center with some
360,000 SKUs and services customers in 160 countries. Fur-
ther, they offer customers a “fully integrated solution, from
product planning and procurement to inventory storage and
warranty repairs.”
Problem:
With the new mission, the logistics vice president realized that
the existing “bare-bones” WMS had to be replaced because it
was not capable of handling the demands of 20,000 service
providers and supporting next-day delivery of more than
4,000 packages daily.
Solution:
“Our main priority was a perpetual inventory system capable
of telling us the status of our inventory in real time,” he ex-
plains. After investigating various solutions, they selected the
Elite Series Warehouse Management System from TECSYS
(www.tecsys.com). Two months after going live, the ware-
house efﬁciency improved dramatically. Now, it has a consis-
tent accuracy rate of 99% when it comes to no-ships, missed
transactions, and outbound errors. Additionally, write-offs due
to inventory shrinkage have dropped 93% “due to the shrink-
age reduction enabled by the system’s real-time tracking of in-
ventory and quantities throughout the warehouse,” he de-
clares.
New Planning and Scheduling Software Helps
Reduce Finished Goods Inventories
Situation:
“Our two-decade-old planning and scheduling system began
to struggle to keep up with our production plants across the
United States,” describes the product supply manager at a ma-
jor maker of paper products. “We had to modernize our logis-
tics system to remain competitive.”
Best Inventory Management Tips
697

Problem:
“Our system was generating unreliable schedules because it
was using a batch mode approach,” he explains. “Our planners
were scheduling from computer-generated reports rather than
directly from the computer screen. Instead of highlighting ex-
ceptions for action, these reports required manual interven-
tion. Also, the systems at the various facilities were not inte-
grated.”
Solution:
“Our goal was to replace the outdated system with a decision-
support environment,” the product supply manager states.
“We chose Numetrix in part for its Supply Chain Integrator
[SCI], which serves as the interface between a global strategic
and tactical optimizer module, and a master production plan-
ning module of the Numetrix solution.” Part of the solution
provides planners with ﬁnancial data that enables them to
know the costs, such as variable manufacturing, distribution,
storage, and handling, attached for each solution. In addition,
the planners found that they could use the SCI to import sta-
tistical safety stocks into planning models to cover variations in
supply and demand.
Advanced WMS Increases Warehouse Efﬁciency 25%
Situation:
The warehouse at a manufacturing complex operates 24/7.
When materials are requested to meet production schedules,
warehouse personnel pick them from storage and deliver them
to the appropriate sites within the facility, according to the
warehouse manager at a large maker of photographic equip-
ment and supplies.
Problem: 
Management decided to redesign the existing warehouse’s op-
erations to make them more efﬁcient; in the existing system,
inventory was received and accounted for manually, by pen-
ciling in the information on paper forms. “Because this system
could not accurately reﬂect stock levels, it was necessary to
keep an extra day’s stock on hand,” he explains.
Solution:
The team opted for a WMS with an RF option. This option was
at the request of the user representative on the team. He be-
lieved it would eliminate the need for fork truck operators to
travel long distances within the warehouse to pick up work or-
ders. The payback from the system includes increased equip-
698
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

ment use and personnel productivity. Also, inventory turns rose,
which “reduced the amount of inventory needed to support
production,” he explains. The new WMS enabled the organi-
zation to reduce inventory on hand by one day and reduce the
number of leased materials-handling vehicles by almost 20%.
Improving Inventory Accuracy with Cycle Counting
Situation:
The executive vice president of a midsize metal fabricator em-
barked on an initiative to minimize shop-ﬂoor problems.
Problem:
“One of the biggest problems we had was with maintaining
any form of inventory accuracy, as stockouts occurred fre-
quently,” he offers.
Solution:
“Our ERP software offers two programs that helped us to
model our operating procedures,” he explains. The ABC anal-
ysis module sorts item master records and assigns an ABC code
on the basis of each item’s actual demand history and standard
cost, each item’s projected volume, and the percentage of the
total dollar volume of all items being analyzed. Also, the cycle
counting program helped to group items by part number and
ABC code. “Our inventory personnel are trained in the cor-
rect procedures and are highly disciplined in their cycle count
activities,” he notes. Today, they routinely achieve 96.5% in-
ventory record accuracy.
Global Beverage Company Slashes Inventory Carrying
Cost 50% with Better Forecasting 
Situation:
“While our inventory performance benchmarks indicated we
were right up there with the top of the industry, we believed
that we could achieve even greater productivity,” explains the
inventory management director at a leading provider of bev-
erage products.
Problem:
“Sales seasonality, rigorous customer service requirements,
and the growing need to anticipate the ﬁnancial impacts of
new product introductions, discounting, and sales promotions
constitute a complex planning mix,” he offers. “Our slower,
less accurate forecasting system just wasn’t up to the job of han-
dling the new demands we were facing,” he allows.
Best Inventory Management Tips
699

Solution:
“Our new forecasting system integrates SmartForecasts for
Windows [Smart Software, Inc.; www.smartcorp.com] and
the Oracle Express online analytical processing [OLAP] sys-
tem,” he explains. Production forecasts are generated weekly
as 14,000 time series of SKU sales by territory are sent from the
company’s Oracle relational database to the Oracle Express an-
alytical database, which is then fed into SmartForecasts. It se-
lects the best statistical forecasting method for each time series
and automatically generates the forecasts in report and graph-
ical form. The entire forecasting and data analysis process takes
20 minutes. In the two years the system has been in operation,
inventory turns have doubled, and inventory carrying costs
have been halved.
Finite Capacity Scheduling Software Solution Trims
Rug Manufacturer’s Inventory
Situation:
A small company makes custom braided rugs the old-
fashioned way, according to the president. They are custom-
made and hand-sewn on machines.
Problem:
“With a virtually unlimited number of yarn color and rug size
possibilities, it is a production scheduler’s nightmare,” he con-
cedes. In addition, the scheduler goes out on the shop ﬂoor at
the end of each week and physically counts inventory and ﬁn-
ished and partially ﬁnished goods.
Solution:
They installed MAX Finite Capacity Scheduling software
(Kewill ERP; www.kewill.com). “Since installing Finite Ca-
pacity early in 1999, we have been better able to balance or-
ders with workload and improve manufacturing throughput,”
the president reports. “With more than 3,000 rugs going on
the schedule each week, we now have the ﬂexibility and ver-
satility to group sizes and colors more efﬁciently, and also to
manage our inventory better.” Now, he relates, accurate pro-
duction and inventory records are maintained in the system.

ing system according to different production strategies, ex-
plains the logistics vice president. 
700
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Problem:
“The constant manipulation caused an excess of WIP in the
workshop, and we did not fully understand how changes in the
system variables impact these levels,” he maintains.
Solution:
“We introduced a simulation study to try and resolve the WIP
in the workshop,” the vice president explains. ProModel
(ProModel Corporation; www.promodel.com) was used to
gain an insight into the relationships among the different vari-
ables. “Running experiments of the scenarios helped to set
the rules for the production system to improve productivity,”
he explains. “Therefore, an insight was gained for under-
standing the relationship between WIP and the others, such
as lead times of pieces, lot sizes, and setup times.” The pro-
posal for decreasing WIP was divided into two groups: sched-
uling and technology. As a result of the modeling effort, there
was a 48% reduction on the average WIP in the workshop.
The majority of this improvement was gained from applying
scheduling rules, the remainder from technological improve-
ments.
Inventory Optimization Tool Boosts Inventory
Turns More than 150%
Situation:
The inventory manager at a major producer of glass for the au-
tomotive industry sought to increase customer service levels
while simultaneously reducing its inventory investment.
Problem:
The manufacturer, which already operates at world-class ser-
vice levels, looked for an answer that would optimize its in-
ventory levels, costs, and workload throughout the supply
chain.
Solution:
“After reviewing several options and potential solutions, we
opted for the GAINS (GAINSystems, Naperville, Ill.; www.
gainstech.com) Inventory Chain Optimization Solution,” the
inventory manager decided. Since its installation, the organi-
zation has been able to achieve a 60% reduction in inventory
investment while still maintaining its world-class service lev-
els. They also have increased on-time service levels to 99.9%
while making the reduction in inventory investment. Also, in-
ventory turns have improved by more than 150%, according
to the inventory manager.

Notiﬁcation System Monitors Inventory Amounts
and Improves Data Accuracy
Situation:
The materials manager at a large manufacturer of hard disk
drives and storage components faced two major challenges:
streamlining its component supply to lower on-hand inven-
tory and moving away from the traditional labor-intensive or-
dering process.
Problem:
The ordering process involved numerous phone calls and
manual inventory checks. To ensure that production was not
interrupted, the process called for high levels of on-hand in-
ventory. Further, they had to improve the quality of the com-
ponent data in their MRP system, as the incomplete and inac-
curate data caused delays in production.
Solution:
To automate its component supply, the materials manager rec-
ommended an interenterprise system to e-mail reorders auto-
matically to suppliers using an event detection and notiﬁcation
solution (Categoric Software Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif.;
www.categoric.com). The new system scans the company’s
databases twice daily, assessing material requirements from one
application module against inventory levels tracked in another.
Orders are automatically initiated and sent to suppliers as
needed, according to the materials manager. The system not
only notiﬁes suppliers of the quantity of components required
in the immediate orders, but also gives them a window into
the amount of inventory on-hand and future weekly require-
ments. While not citing speciﬁc savings, he does indicate that
savings from inventory reductions will be in the millions of
dollars.
Internet-Based Solution Helps Manufacturer
Reduce Inventory Levels
Situation:
“Our core ERP solution was a heavily modiﬁed system from
the 1980s,” explains the logistics director at a midsize semi-
conductor manufacturer. “The system lacked ﬂexibility and
functionality to compete in today’s fast-changing semicon-
ductor market.”
702
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Problem:
“The system was such that it required extensive rekeying of
data and many quality assurance reviews,” he cites. “Rate-
based production scheduling and ﬁnite scheduling were im-
possible.” The company wanted to have more ﬂexibility, im-
prove its time-to-market, and increase its customer service
performance.
Solution:
The company decided to rebuild its technical infrastructure on
the foundation of an Internet-based extended enterprise ap-
plication solution (Pivotpoint, Inc.; Woburn, Mass.; www.
pivotpoint.com). It implemented Point.Man to manage the
“nuts and bolts” of the manufacturing business—inventory
control, order entry, ﬁnite scheduling, production manage-
ment, and more. With the new system in operation, the logis-
tics director reports a marked increase in on-time delivery per-
formance, a signiﬁcant decline in inventory levels, and a
decrease in the time to market. “A key beneﬁt is the ability to
get information out of the system at any time and in any for-
mat,” he reveals. “It has increased our ﬂexibility.”
Supply Chain Planning Technology Reduces
Inventory and Planning Cycle
Situation:
According to the project manager at a large maker of eyewear
and eye care products, planning is centralized at headquarters,
but manufacturing and distribution are global. “Production of
the various brands is merged,” he explains. “The brands are
supplied and produced as a common product line. We have a
lot of sites, and we transfer a lot of product and materials from
site to site,” he expands.
Problem:
“Our existing MRP system did not generate a plan that was
materials- or capacity-feasible,” the project manager offers. “It
didn’t look across our sites to determine where material short-
falls or surpluses and imbalances might exist.”
Solution:
“We selected PeopleSoft (Pleasanton, Calif.; www.people-
soft.com) supply chain planning technology to reduce inven-
tory levels and planning cycle times for our product lines,” ac-
cording to the project manager. “With the last pieces of the
enterprise planning system in place, the whole supply chain
will be modeled, and most of the inventory reductions will
Best Inventory Management Tips
703

come from eliminating the imbalances in the supply chain.” So
far, they’ve reduced their ﬁnished stocking constraints by $2
million. The total goal is $10 million with other supply chain
initiatives included.
Automated Parts Replacement System Improves
Picking Output 40% in Warehouse
Situation:
“Our parts replacement center receives, stores, and ships more
than 1,775,000 parts to customers worldwide,” maintains the
inventory manager at a large producer of consumer electron-
ics parts.
Problem:
“The rising volume of our business was straining our anti-
quated inventory control system,” she explains. Much of the
system is manual, with operators reconciling shipments on
printed lists, using outdated packing list procedures, and con-
ducting physical searches to ﬁnd locations for new product
parts.
Solution:
“After a long, exhaustive search, we opted for the Exceed.cs
supply chain execution system from EXE Technologies [Dal-
las; www.exe.com],” she relates. “The software, which was
easily integrated with our existing order system, has brought
our inventory under control.” All putaways, moves, picks,
sorts, and quality control are tracked using handheld scanners
that upload into the system. Bar code printers generate labels
as soon as products arrive at the center. The system sends and
receives order, receipt, and status information as soon as it is
available. Since the implementation, picking output has surged
by 40%, and lead times on outgoing shipments have been cut
from ﬁve days to just one and a half, she maintains.
Cross-docking Operations Enhanced with New PC Terminals
Situation:
“The amount of activity in the dock areas of our customer
centers has increased since we implemented cross-docking
capabilities,” offers the vice president of a major less-than-
truckload (LTL) carrier. 
704
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Problem:
“With this new capability we still hadn’t achieved the efﬁ-
ciency levels we had targeted,” he mentions. “Also, we still
could not provide real-time tracking of customer freight.”
Solution:
“We added PC cross-dock terminals at our customer centers
to facilitate the ﬂow of freight and to have a timely and accu-
rate location of customer shipments,” the executive explains.
The wireless LAN-based PC/Rover terminals (Kinetic Com-
puter Corporation, Billerica, Mass.; www.kin.com) are
mounted on the I beam between dock doors and communi-
cate to the terminal computer server via RF link. Cargo un-
loaded from one trailer is scanned by the operator with the
cross-dock terminal and then directly loaded on another
trailer.
Direct Supplier Involvement Helps to
Reduce Supply Chain Inventory
Situation: An inventory manager at a large consumer products company
sought to “convince” others in the organization that “inventory
is a communications opportunity linking the supply chain.”
Problem:
“Inventory is the result of poor/inadequate/inaccurate or with-
held information,” he believes. As such, the manager sought to
improve “linkage” with the supplier community.
Solution:
“We went about involving our suppliers of ‘value-added’ ma-
terial as well as the raw material suppliers in a three-tier joint
management of the supply chain,” he describes. The value-
added supplier assumed responsibility for managing the total
supply chain, for reporting inventory by speciﬁcation, and for
reporting service and quality levels to all three parties. “With
the improved linkage of the suppliers with internal systems,
processes, and information, we are all experiencing, albeit to
different degrees, various levels of inventory reduction.”
Supply Chain Software Helps Toy Maker Bring
New Efﬁciencies to Warehouse Operations
Situation:

president at a leading designer and suppliers of toys and gifts.
Problem:
“We have a labor-intensive, paper-based distribution process
that we’re trying to break away from, to increase our inven-
tory turns and lower operational costs,” he offers.
Solution:
The company selected a supply chain software solution (Op-
tum Software; Costa Mesa, Calif.) and will link it to a newly
acquired SAP R/3 ERP application. “The Optum software
will be installed in all four of our distribution centers and will
dramatically increase our inventory turns and improve our
shipping accuracy,” the executive explained. The application
combines operational logic with real-time order and inven-
tory information to enable workers to execute key operations,
such as unload, putaway, pick, pack, and ship, in concert. For
example, the vice president describes, “On an inbound ship-
ment, the software calculates optimal putaway locations, and
through bar coding and use of RF handheld terminals, auto-
matically records in real time where the product is stored.
Also, when items are picked for outbound shipment, the op-
erators are provided the optimal item location, and as soon as
the item is pulled off the shelf, inventory for that location is up-
dated instantly.”
Reinstalling Cycle Counting Helps Restore
Order to Chaotic Inventory Situation
Situation:
“A previous manager had eliminated the cycle count process,”
a production and inventory control (P&IC) manager at a mid-
size manufacturer of valves reveals. “Some material has not
been counted/veriﬁed in over three years.” 
Problem:
“We knew the inventory had to be in the building somewhere;
we just didn’t know exactly where,” he maintains. “Inventory
accuracy, at best, was only around 60%.”
Solution:
On taking over the responsibility, the new manager immedi-
ately reinstituted the cycle counting process. “My goal is to
improve inventory accuracy and make it a nonissue by having
a repeatable process in place,” he explains. “With our cycle
counting process again in operation, we count our inventory
location by location and know exactly where what is and how
many are there.” Already, the accuracy level is in the mid-90%
706
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

area, and is “climbing each month.” Now, “when we go to
make a pick list to pull orders, we’re more than 99% conﬁdent
the parts are there to satisfy the customer order,” the P&IC
manager insists.
New Advanced Planning System Provides
Better Control of Safety Stock
Situation:
A purchasing manager at a liquor distributor that was experi-
encing growing demand realized that the time had come to
automate its materials planning and purchasing functions to
improve their operating efﬁciencies.
Problem: 
“We had to have a system that would reduce our increasing
frequency of stockouts, yet enable us to improve customer ser-
vice with less inventory,” the purchasing manager explained.
“Further, we had to have a way to move buyers from the man-
ual ordering process.”
Solution: 
“Using the Supply Chain Planner [Celerity Solutions, Inc.;
Concord, Mass.] software, we have been able to construct a
model of our supply chain,” he explains. “We now can proj-
ect future inventory levels based on our sourcing rules, ship-
ping and calendar restraints, lead times, safety stock, and ex-
cess stock level policies.” As the supply and demand change,
he notes, planned supply orders are created, canceled, or ad-
justed automatically. For example, when lead times are
reached, planned orders can be opened automatically or by a
buyer. Also, the system alerts buyers to conditions that re-
quire immediate attention, such as excess stock or predicted
shortages. “Alternatives for correcting the condition are
clearly displayed,” he notes. “Our buyers are now shifting
their focus from ordering to forecasting and inventory plan-
ning.”
Operator Training Helps to Improve Inventory Management
Situation:
“The individuals responsible for managing the inventory had
previously handled a few hundred SKUs for a single manufac-
turing plant,” reports an inventory control manager at a large
producer of specialty machinery components. “Suddenly they
Best Inventory Management Tips
707

were in charge of over a couple thousand SKUs from several
manufacturing sites after a corporate merger.”
Problem:
“Our service level plummeted to a miserable 55%, even
though we had stock of almost a year’s worth of inventory,” he
declares. “Upon reviewing the operation, it was clear that
training was at the root of our problems.” 
Solution:
“We used the APICS [American Production and Inventory
Control Society] certiﬁcation review program as the model
to train these individuals,” the inventory control manager
explains. After going through several of the review courses,
“they began to spearhead major improvements in both inven-
tory turns and customer service level.” 
Move to Paperless Inventory Management Boosts Accuracy
Situation: “We have to keep track of thousands of products in more than
three dozen factories and distribution centers around the
world,” comments an inventory analyst at a large producer of
hose ﬁttings and assemblies. 
Problem: 
“We’ve maintained inventory on paper, wrote information on
charts and lists, and then had it all keyed into a computer,” she
explains. “This manual process produced errors which gave us
false inventory information on an almost routine basis.”
Solution:
“We invested in an automatic identiﬁcation process that en-
ables us to have an inventory management system that tracks
every product we make,” the analyst explains. The process
starts when a product comes out of manufacturing. A bar-
coded label is attached to the product or container before
moving into the warehouse. An operator scans the label and
the bar-coded bin location where it is being stored. When the
product is pulled, it is again scanned and automatically de-
ducted from inventory. “We now have better records and are
assured that when an operator has to pick a part for an order,
it’s there where it’s supposed to be,” she offers.
New Warehouse Management System Improves
Inventory Accuracy
Situation:
The logistics director at a leading provider of nonproduction
goods and services with multisite DCs across North America
708
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

realized it was imperative for the organization to investigate
the feasibility of incorporating a WMS into its operations.
Problem:
“We were looking for a system with ﬂexible system function-
ality and the ability to modify the level of automation at a mo-
ment’s notice,” the director explained.
Solution:
“After reviewing a number of potential solutions, we selected
Celerity’s WMS 4.0 [Somerset Solutions, Inc., subsidiary of
Celerity Solutions, Inc.; Irvine, Calif.],” he notes. The system
includes the standard material-handling interface, which con-
trols high-speed conveyors and a pick-to-light system to ex-
pedite picking functions and to increase inventory accuracy.
With the success of the initial installation, the company will
continue the implementation of WMS 4.0 to its remaining
distribution sites, the director states.
Vendor Managed Inventory Helps Chemical Maker
Rid Itself of Excess Inventory
Situation: Similar to many manufacturers, a small maker of laboratory
chemicals and reagents lacked access to real-time customer
demand and distributor inventory data it needed to make efﬁ-
cient plans, the director of manufacturing reports.
Problem: 
“We were having quite big swings in orders from our distrib-
utors, which in turn caused us either to work overtime or, in
times of drought, to have people basically waiting for some-
thing to do,” the director complained. “We were just building
too much inventory, and it was creating tremendous problems
in our manufacturing cycle.”
Solution:
“We began working with Ediﬁce Information Management
Systems [Riverdale, N.J.], a VMI outsourcing service pro-
vider,” he describes. Powered by Microsoft BackOfﬁce tech-
nologies, Ediﬁce’s VMI system receives daily inventory trans-
actions from the chemical producer’s distributors via EDI.
Based on those data and demand history, Ediﬁce creates an
order plan that the company reviews, edits, and approves
through a Web-based client application. Beneﬁts include an
inventory reduction of 10% while maintaining an order ﬁll
rate of 99%. Also, receivable discrepancies are down from 2%
of line items to 0.2%.

Training of Entire Staff Raises Awareness of
Need for Inventory Reduction
Situation:
A corporate materials manager at a large builder of semicon-
ductor manufacturing equipment sensed that there was a
“creeping level of inaccuracy in inventory records being main-
tained, leading to undesirable amounts of obsolete inventory
being stored.”
Problem: 
An initial review found the inventory record accuracy to be no
greater than 60%.
Solution:
“Our ﬁrst step was to institute a training program,” the man-
ager offered. “Since training was a signiﬁcant issue, we trained
the entire warehouse staff on the intricacies of cycle counting.
We also emphasized the impact of inventory accuracy and the
effect it has on the production ﬂoor and on the company’s bot-
tom line,” he detailed. The company took one additional step.
It assigned a single senior manager to be responsible for and
lead the effort to reduce obsolete and excess inventory levels.
“These efforts have added focus on the inventory situation and
emphasized its importance, and the people are responding,” he
explains.
Stockouts Almost Eliminated and Inventory Slashed
with New MRP II System
Situation:
“Although our market as a whole is static, our company is
achieving strong growth,” describes the logistics director at a
midsize manufacturer of recreational vehicles. “To continue
this continued expansion, while maintaining control over our
inventory situation, information technology is the key to our
continued expansion.”
Problem:
“We have been running a mixture of off-the-shelf and cus-
tomized modules to monitor our manufacturing processes,
and while they were adequate, they will not propel us to
where we want to be in the future,” he explains.
Solution:
A team was formed to improve the company’s computer
systems, and team members also looked at four different
MRP systems and evaluated two. The system ultimately
selected was PRMS (Acacia Technologies, Lisle, Ill.). “The
710
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

full MRP II functionality has improved customer service in
regards to stockouts,” the logistics director maintains. The
company has 8,000 component line items, several of which
have lead times as long as three months. “Our stockouts
have been considerably reduced due to monitoring and con-
trol capabilities of the new system,” he describes. “This im-
provement in service has been made in parallel with a 15%
reduction in inventory.”
Internet Allows Suppliers to Manage/Control
Inventory of Essential Parts 
Situation:
“Our management approved a recommendation to use the In-
ternet and install an ERP system to enhance our supply chain
management practice and to enable us to collaborate with our
trading partners,” offers the operations vice president at a large
manufacturer of heavy machinery equipment.
Problem:
“This has caused our team to do a lot of rethinking as we were
currently using several different software packages,” he ex-
plains. The problem was, however, that they were heavily cus-
tomized and could not be integrated with the systems of their
major suppliers and customers.
Solution:
“We decided to scrap our legacy systems and replace them with
a series of packaged applications, such as SAP R/3 for manufac-
turing and i2 Technologies constraint-based planning for supply
chain management,” the executive details. “We also developed
a common Web-based environment, an extranet where we can
exchange information with our trading partners.” Recently, the
company has been able to extract information about inventory
levels from the system and to put it directly on a secure extranet.
“Now suppliers realize almost immediately when we’re running
low and replenish the stock without having to be notiﬁed,” he
declares. “The suppliers have access to the data and make sure
we don’t run out of supplies,” he assures.
Highly Accurate Inventory Records Key to Inventory Reduction
Situation:
“Our company was in the process of expanding into several
new product areas, and we realized our inventory manage-
Best Inventory Management Tips
711

ment system also had to change if it was to keep pace,” reports
the inventory manager at a midsize custom aluminum fabrica-
tor.
Problem:
“We have as many as 250 different orders in process in a given
week, with lead times ranging from three days to 12 months,”
he explains. Production planning was a challenge. 
Solution: 
“We rewrote our engineering computer programs and inte-
grated them with a central cost accounting system,” the inven-
tory manager describes. This link among engineering, cost
accounting, and estimating teams now provides multiple de-
partments with easy access to the same data. This has enabled
the company to track usage of stock parts better and reduce or-
der quantities. It also has eliminated the annual physical in-
ventory process, which had previously shut the plant for two
days. The better control of inventory and BOMs has led to an
inventory reduction of 30%, while also improving inventory
accuracy to more than 98%.
New Scheduling Software Reduces WIP Inventory 50%
Situation:
“The cost of late product delivery to our customers is as high
as $250,000 per day,” reports the manufacturing systems man-
ager at a large producer of drilling equipment for the oil ex-
ploration industry. “This dictates we deliver products and ser-
vices on time, every time.”
Problem:
“Our MRP system was not designed to schedule in a com-
plex manufacturing environment,” he explains. “It became
counterproductive as it increased lead times to accommodate
unexpected events, forcing us to increase safety stocks.”
Solution:
“We began scheduling the plant manually using the Theory
of Constraints,” the systems manager shares. It was successful
as it saved inventory costs, overtime, and expediting. How-
ever, the manual approached also plateaued. “We selected a
material ﬂow management software [Thru-Put Technologies;
San Jose, Calif.] and completed the implementation in two
months,” he notes. “Within weeks we increased the capacity
of bottleneck resources by identifying the critical disruptions
in plant ﬂow,” he declares. “With the system’s early warning
signals, corrective actions also can be triggered to establish
712
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

routings using nonbottlenecks to avoid excess safety stock lev-
els.” To date, WIP inventory has been cut in half over the man-
ual implementation, saving an additional $2.8 million.
RFDC System Improves Inventory Accuracy 28-fold
at Consumer Products Company
Situation:
“We have some 15,000 SKUs in our distribution center in the
Northeast,” describes the vice president of operations at this
large manufacturer of consumer products. “Some 85% of the
shipments are represented by only two major product lines.”
Problem:
“Increased sales problems began to cause logistics problems,”
he offers. “Manual records of product inventory were not be-
ing entered into the system on a timely basis, which resulted
in outdated information being available to plant workers and
customers.”
Solution: 
“We began a search for a data collection solution for our en-
tire distribution center operations and focused on getting
a better handle on inventory accuracy,” he explains. They
selected an Intermec Technologies Corporation (Everett,
Wash.) solution that consisted of RF-based portable comput-
ers with laser scanners, portable printers, RF ﬁxed printers, RF
vehicle mount units, and RF ﬁxed-mount intelligent readers.
“The new system went live together with a year-end physical
inventory, and within three weeks greater accuracy of the in-
ventory data was being realized,” the executive declares. For
example, the physical inventory in the rack storage area has
improved to 99+%. This is based on a book-to-physical dif-
ference of $78,000 on $30 million of inventory.
ERP Software Provides Extra Beneﬁt:
Supplier Managed Inventory Program
Situation:
“Our production, after several years of 60% growth, was ex-
ceeding the capability of the existing ERP software,” observes
the information technology (IT) applications manager at a mid-
size manufacturer of equipment for the semiconductor in-
dustry.
Best Inventory Management Tips
713

Problem: 
“We needed a solution that could run material planning cycles
on a daily basis—also one that could stay online around the
clock identifying where our inventory was,” he mentions.
Solution:
“One of our sites moved to a new ERP system [Glovia Inter-
national; El Segundo, Calif.], and a second migrated to it two
years later,” the manager explains. “All the sites have been up-
graded to version 3.0, which supports Oracle.” In addition, he
explains, “The Glovia system is also the backbone of our sup-
plier managed inventory program, in which our customers can
manage inventory online by obtaining spare parts and con-
sumables while eliminating the traditional purchase order.”
Cross-functional Team Develops Solution to
Reduce Inventory Costs, Warehousing Space
Situation:
The senior director of materials management and purchasing
at a midsize fabricator of metal products has created cross-
functional teams to focus on speciﬁc inventory/supply prob-
lems that impact internal end users.
Problem: 
“Our team of representatives from inventory, distribution, pur-
chasing, and manufacturing went to visit one of our major sup-
pliers at his warehouse,” the director explains. “We were having
problems with the delivery, storage, and payment for the ma-
terials they provided, which were inhibiting our operations.”
Solution:
“After several follow-up meetings with the supplier representa-
tives, our team was able to work out a structured agreement for
having the supplier provide us with the materials for a period of
three years,” he explains. “In addition, the supplier would store
the material at his warehouse and deliver it to us as we needed
it, delivering it to point-of-use at no additional charge. Further,
we would turn around payment to the supplier within 10 days
of delivery.” Overall, they reduced inventory costs signiﬁcantly,
while freeing expensive warehouse space.
Moving from a Manual to an Automated System
Improves Inventory Accuracy
Situation:
A large auto parts distributor with more than 30 warehouses
nationwide carries an inventory valued as much as $3 billion,
according to the organization’s logistics director.
714
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

Problem: 
“Our growth was causing us to have problems with our in-
ventory, especially in its accuracy and location,” he explains.
“The manual systems we employed just couldn’t do the job any
longer.”
Solution:
“We had to automate and move away from the paper-based
environment,” he declares. “Due to the scope of the project,
and our lack of knowledge of systems availability, we engaged
a consultant to work with us and develop a plan we could pre-
sent to management justifying what we planned to do.” They
developed a plan that quantiﬁed inventory accuracy improve-
ment, reduction of errors, improvement of space utilization,
and reduction of inventory. “We also put a ﬁgure on the im-
provement in productivity, and what it all meant to the bot-
tom line,” the director explains. The solution was a multiyear
project that saw the installation of WMSs, including bar cod-
ing technology and RF hardware. With the complete system
now in place, the logistics director cites a $20 million savings
in inventory costs and a $3 million savings in inventory shrink-
age. “We have almost eliminated inventory shortages and cut
mispicks by half,” he offers. “And productivity has improved
by almost 10%.”
WIP Inventory Reduced by One Week per
Production Line with MES Software
Situation: “We produce 40,000 assemblies of 1,600 different products
each month,” maintains the manufacturing manager at a ma-
jor provider of electronics packaging products.
Problem: 
“Our challenge has been to maintain optimum productivity
and customer satisfaction in our high-volume, multiproduct
manufacturing environment,” he offers. “Part of the problem
was in maintaining too much material on the factory ﬂoor for
the ‘just-in-case’ jobs.”
Solution: 
“We initially installed OnTrack [Real World Technology;
Mount Prospect, Ill.; 847-390-0200], a manufacturing execu-
tion system, on one production line,” he explains. In terms
of inventory, they realized a one-time material reduction off-
the-ﬂoor equaling about one week worth of WIP. Similar re-
ductions were achieved when the software was installed on
three other production lines. “The software tracks product

inventory and helps the users ascertain where product is on the
ﬂoor at any time,” he details. “It helps us to move WIP through
the facility much quicker and keep production at optimal levels.”
Next Generation Advanced Planning and Scheduling Software
Reduces Overall Inventory
Situation:
“To improve our competitive position and meet market de-
mand for sustained growth, we decided to reengineer our pro-
cedures for forecasting demand, accepting work orders from
customers, making commitment for orders, and completing
product deliveries,” describes the logistics project manager at a
large semiconductor fabricator.
Problem:
“We have a difﬁcult environment for planning and scheduling
as we have a large volume operation, long lead times, and
complex interplant dependencies,” she explains. “We also have
a high degree of breakdown, scrap, and rework.”
Solution: 
The project manager and her team considered a number of ad-
vanced planning and scheduling software solutions before they
selected the one from Paragon Management Systems (Los An-
geles). In part, the software enabled them to improve visibility
for cycle times, inventory levels, and other key performance
measures. Also, it offered intelligent routing, including prod-
uct overrides for operations. “With the new software, we have
been able to improve our throughput by better managing starts
and product mix,” she explains. “Overall, we have been able
to reduce inventory levels signiﬁcantly and improve cycle time
by 10%.”
New Virtual Manufacturing Strategy Saves Millions
in Inventory Investment
Situation:
“We have the multiple goals of faster time to market, improved
supply chain management, and better responsiveness to cus-
tomers,” notes the materials director at a midsize telecommu-
nications equipment manufacturer. 
Problem:
“Our existing product data management system made it difﬁ-
cult for our internal groups such as engineering and purchas-

Under the old system, engineering changes were cut in with-
out the knowledge of purchasing. By the time they reviewed
the stacks of ECNs, the changes already were effective, and af-
ter the wrong parts had been purchased. “This led to a tremen-
dous amount of excess and obsolete inventory.” 
Solution: 
“We created a unique virtual manufacturing process in which
the production and development processes are managed by the
team members, who include parts distributors, contract elec-
tronics manufacturers, a bare-board manufacturer, and our
own employees,” she details. Full EDI connects each team
member and “speeds the exchange of plan and build mes-
sages.” A new PDM system (Agile Software Corporation; San
Jose, Calif.) provides the collaborative capabilities for publish-
ing product data and engineering changes across the enterprise
and supply chain. “We’ve slashed inventory, cut cycle time by
nine weeks, and greatly increased collaboration among inter-
nal and external partners,” she details. 
Reviewing Days Supply of Inventory Leads to
a Massive Reduction in Inventory Levels
Situation:
“We revised our inventory management procedures by imple-
menting a new measurement system,” offers the inventory
manager at a large consumer products company. 
Problem: 
“We computed our days of supply for our dry products, and
found it was 32 days across the country. I’m already carrying
about one million cases in our main plant, and it only repre-
sents an eight-day supply. So what kind of inventory do I have
in the supply chain for 32 days?” he asks.
Solution:
“There was no valid reason to have a 32-day supply in the
supply chain,” he notes. Upon investigating, they found that
their manufacturing cycle time was no more than two weeks
on any given dry product. “Adding in a couple of days for tran-
sit, and revising our forecasts, we established 17 days as the tar-
get,” the inventory manager reveals. “In just two weeks after
starting our plan, we moved to 25 days supply; after four
months it was down to 20 days; within six months, we hit our
target,” he maintains. “Our savings are in the millions of dol-
lars, and no one has been caught short of product.”

Theory of Constraints Leads to Lower WIP Inventories
Situation:
An inventory manager at a job shop shares, “We often make
the same product. However, most orders require special ﬁt-
tings, brackets, or other minor but critical ﬁxtures. Also, it is
a rarity for us to make more than one of the same items at a
time.”
Problem:
“Our customers, nevertheless, pressure us to compress our
lead times,” he explains. In the past this meant that the com-
pany stocked ﬁnished and semiﬁnished goods. “But this was an
ineffective, inefﬁcient, and costly solution, at best,” the inven-
tory manager maintains.
Solution:
After attending a Theory of Constraints (TOC) workshop, the
attendees applied TOC principles to the job shop’s operations.
“They found many bottlenecks throughout the various oper-
ations,” he notes. “The team proposed placing the control
point near the end of the process, just prior to ﬁnishing and
shipping, to enable production to be timed to meet shipping
commitments.” From there they established buffers and com-
munications for planning schedules and tracking progress. In
three months after rolling out the solution, there was a 25% in-
crease in throughput and a 35% decrease in WIP.
Kanban Process Improves Inventory Turnover Ratio
by More Than Double
Situation:
The materials manager at a midsize specialty chemicals facility
used a combination of MRP and min/max for inventory plan-
ning and control, and raw material turned about 5 times per
year.
Problem: 
“While we thought we were doing well, we still experienced
about three stockouts per month, and our operators com-
plained of lengthy waits for raw materials at the stockrooms,”
he describes. Additionally, the annual physical inventory con-
sumed about 12 hours.
Solution: 
“We formed a team of stockroom clerks, a buyer, a support
staff member, and myself to consider implementing a kanban-
type system,” the materials manager notes. “We ﬁrst created a
demand forecast for the product families and then reformatted
the BOMs to have only three levels.” Initially, the kanban pro-
718
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

cess was applied to most raw materials, all MRO items, and
some production material. The team also negotiated with the
key suppliers and got their lead times down to one week or
less. “We also implemented a kanban training program for all
shop personnel and monitored their activity,” he explains.
“Now, we’re moving all MRO to consignment within the
kanban process.” Among the beneﬁts he shares: Stockouts
were eliminated; order quantities decreased; and inventory
turns climbed above 13. Also, the annual physical now takes
about two hours to complete.
Web Technology Improves Inventory Management
at Bedding Manufacturer
Situation:
The logistics manager at a large manufacturer of pillows and
comforters typically carries inventory of ﬁll materials from
Asia for fabrics and materials tags.
Problem:
“Typically, we received shipments of raw materials long in ad-
vance of their need, which were based on projections from the
retailers we served,” she explains. “However, the system we
had in place wasn’t able to respond quickly to exceptions,
which meant we couldn’t react quickly to changing situations,
causing stockouts or excess inventories.”
Solution:
“We launched a Web pilot with one of our retailers to get
point-of-sale data showing current inventory on hand at its
stores,” the logistics manager describes. “This automatic shar-
ing of data about what customers have helps us make better de-
cisions about materials on hand, and we can minimize our in-
ventory levels.” The initial effort has expanded to additional
retailers. “In some cases we get the information about the in-
ventory at speciﬁc store locations,” she notes. For the future,
plans are being investigated that will coordinate POS informa-
tion from retailers with automated purchasing of fabric, bags,
and tags from domestic suppliers.
Kanban and MRP Simultaneously Boost
Inventory Turns from 2.5 to 8
Situation:
A leading manufacturer and distributor of health care prod-
ucts customizes one speciﬁc product line to meet customer
Best Inventory Management Tips
719

preferences and individual dimensions. “Our goal is to achieve
a manufacturing process in a demand pull environment,” says
the organization’s inventory manager.
Problem:
“We needed a system that could be rapidly implemented, sup-
port custom manufacturing, provide powerful planning capa-
bilities, and allow data to be exported into corporate ﬁnancial
systems,” the inventory manager explains. “We wanted a sys-
tem ﬂexible enough to ﬁt our needs.”
Solution:
They selected MSS for OBJECTS (Fourth Shift, Minneapolis;
www.fs.com) manufacturing software because it is adaptable
to a demand ﬂow manufacturing environment. “The new
software has made materials planning easier and more efﬁ-
cient,” she explains. Now a planner can handle 1,200 purchase
parts rather than the former 500. Additionally, the company is
able to respond to customer demands and coordinate related
activity via kanbans. “Since using the software in a demand
pull environment, we’ve reduced our lead times from 15 to 6
days and increased inventory turns by more than triple. We’ve
also improved our on-time delivery to a consistent minimum
of 99%.”
WMS Provides Greater Inventory Control,
Eliminates Massive Reconciliation
Situation:
The operations manager at a midsize processor of steel bars ex-
plains that the company had recently completed an acquisition
program to expand its production capabilities greatly. “Since
the consolidation, we have found it necessary to exercise
tighter control over the inventory,” he relates.
Problem:
“Previously, our inventory was limited to just two sites and we
used a three-part paper tag system for ﬁnished goods,” he ex-
plains. This manual system was not too reliable as the infor-
mation on the tags was sometimes in error as they got lost or
misplaced.
Solution:
“Our inventory control and MIS departments worked to-
gether to develop a speciﬁcation for a warehouse management
system,” the operations manager notes. The real-time WMS
uses bar code input and RF mobile data collection terminals.
“Now the inventory is tracked from raw materials receiving
720
I N V E N T O RY  M A N A G E M E N T

through production, putaway, pick/pack, and shipping,” he
describes. Now there is much greater control over inventory
as the salespeople have online access to the inventory at all the
plants. As the operations manager declares, “The time saved
on physical inventory and the other efﬁciencies, plus the low
investment in the system, has paid for itself in under a year.”
Focus on Supply Chain Activity Leads to Inventory
Reduction Initiatives with Suppliers
Situation:
“We’re a wholesaler-distributor that is spending more time in
managing inventory replenishment for our customers,” ex-
plains the company president of the provider of MRO prod-
ucts.
Problem:
“Shortly into the business plan, we came to the realization that
we had to better manage our own inventory before we could
begin to manage that of our customers,” he relates. 
Solution:
“Our inventory turns are at 12, while the competition hovers
around 4,” the president explains. “This performance is
achieved by internalizing the demand forecasting information
available from the customer and working with our suppliers to
reduce the inventory we need to hold.” There has been a less-
ening of activities across the supply chain. For instance, the
industrial distributor has eliminated some major activities.
Speciﬁcally, it arranges direct shipments of OEM and MRO
products from the suppliers to the customer on a JIT basis. In
addition, it has developed a series of VMI programs with both
its suppliers and customers.
New WMS Solution Increases Inventory Accuracy
to a Consistent 95+%
Situation:
The project manager at a major pharmaceutical company
notes that they were in need of a WMS that would provide se-
cure pharmaceutical lot control. “The distribution warehouse
has many ﬂoor locations, and we cannot afford to put two dif-
ferent lots in the same location,” he explains. 
Problem:
“We began our search by examining almost 30 WMS vendors,”
the project manager recalls. Among the other criteria we had to
Best Inventory Management Tips
721

meet were cost, system design, operational design, implemen-
tation and scheduling capabilities, related experience, company
ﬁnancial and technology strength, and support capabilities.
Solution:
The pharmaceutical giant selected the MARC-CS solution
(TRW Logistics Execution Systems, Chicago; www.trw.com/
MARC) for its raw materials and ﬁnished goods warehouse
facilities. MARC’s lot control functionality enables the com-
pany to track this speciﬁc information and determine where a
particular lot should be stored. In addition, inventory accuracy
has increased to greater than 95%. Also, the distribution ware-
house has experienced the greatest improvement with turn-
over now estimated at 80% to 90% of its inventory each
month.
Equipment Tracking System Helps Reduce Tool Shrinkage
by an Initial $200,000
Situation:
“We had no computerized tracking system of the 15,000 tools
we provided our employees,” maintains a maintenance man-
ager at a large shipyard. “We expect a certain amount of attri-
tion because any tool dropped into the deep water is gone for-
ever,” he mentions.
Problem:
“Trouble is, we were losing close to $500,000 annually in
tools,” he complains. “Part of the problem that hindered us in
seeking a solution was the harsh environment in which the
tools were used.”
Solution:
“We worked with a company that specializes in automatic data
collection and label and tag manufacturing which also has ex-
perience in providing labeling solutions in harsh environ-
ments,” the maintenance manager explains. After a three-
month test of different materials, a bar-coded color label was
selected that would satisfactorily adhere to the tools’ surface.
When removing a tool from the crib, employees ﬁrst scan the
tool bar code. Then they scan their personal bar code located
on their helmet or ID badge. The information is cross-
checked when the tool is returned at the end of the shift.
“We’ve saved almost $200,000 in equipment shrinkage for the
six months that the labeling system has been in place,” the
maintenance manager shares.

Automated Storage Cabinet Helps Keep Ofﬁce Supplies
Inventory at Minimum Levels
Situation:
“We were spending almost $2,000 per month on ofﬁce sup-
plies, yet always seemed to be in an out-of-stock situation,” a
department manager complains.
Problem:
“Our company ofﬁce supply ordering agents were interrupted
between 15 and 22 times per day by requests for ordering and
dispensing supplies,” explains the midsize organization’s pur-
chasing manager. “This required them to make phone calls
and fax orders to the suppliers. In emergencies, they even had
to make trips to the local Ofﬁce Depot,” he notes.
Solution:
“We invested in an automated cabinet [SupplyPro, San Diego,
Calif.; info@supplypro.com] that provides for JIT ordering to
help keep inventory at a minimum,” the purchasing manager
explains. It statistically analyzes usage patterns and establishes
minimum stock levels. When a supply falls below the mini-
mum level, the cabinet automatically sends an electronic order
to restock the supply. During the validation test, the company
achieved a 55% savings, which more than pays for the cabinet’s
monthly rental. Additionally, the ordering agents were able to
concentrate on their primary job duties.
Inventory Management Tool Slices Excess Inventories
to Reduce Investment by 24% 
Situation:
According to the inventory manager at a large manufacturer of
telecommunications equipment, there had been a concerted
effort to clear out obsolete inventories. This resulted in a $2
million reduction in inventory investment in a matter of six
months.
Problem:
“Once we rid ourselves of the obsolete inventory, we then had
to concentrate on excess inventory levels,” the inventory man-
ager explains. “But there was difﬁculty in coming to a con-
sensus in how to address the different commodity codes and
product groups.
Solution:
“We implemented the IQR technique [IQR International,
Inc.; San Juan Capistrano, Calif.] that focused on the dollar
value of the inventory,” he explains. “The planner and buyers
Best Inventory Management Tips
723

formed teams, but since they were responsible for different
commodities and products, they had inherently different po-
tentials for inventory reduction.” Taking this into consideration,
some teams were able to achieve a 60% reduction, while others
only had 5%. “Had we issued an edict for a ﬂat reduction target,
I doubt we would have been successful,” he maintains. “The 5%
team would have hurt service levels with a 20% reduction, while
the 60% team would have achieved the 20% target rather easily,
and gone back to business as usual without realizing their full re-
duction potential.” Overall, inventory investment was taken
down by $4 million over a nine-month period.
New Software Reduces Inventory Stock Levels
and Propels Turnover to 6.5 from 3.5
Situation:
A materials manager at a large producer of ﬁre detection and se-
curity control systems reveals that the organization had pur-
chased an MRP system two years previously. “But it wasn’t do-
ing what had been promised,” he describes. “Our inventory
levels were too high, and purchasing had no trust in the system.”
Problem:
“The system claimed multiple planning parameters, but none
of them worked,” the materials manager maintains. “Addi-
tionally, we had difﬁculties exporting data from the system,
and since we couldn’t trust the data, we were overbuying to
cover ourselves in manufacturing.”
Solution:
“We decided to dump the old system and get a new one,” he
explains. “However, we ﬁrst had to run the numbers for what
we thought we could do with improved purchasing and in-
ventory management.” The analysis indicated that if the im-
provements were made, they could pay for the system. They
selected MSS for OBJECTS (Fourth Shift Corporation, Min-
neapolis). “Fourth Shift gives us good visibility into our
inventory issues,” says the materials manager. “It gives us the
ﬂexibility to use different planning parameters based on the sit-
uation. We can take all high-risk, high-dollar parts and plan
them in a unique fashion, and leave everything else for another
planning capacity.” Within a year of implementation, they
were able to reduce inventory levels by more than $1 million
while increasing revenues 22%. Also, inventory turns almost
724

doubled while manufacturing cycle time was reduced from 40
hours to 32 hours.
50% Productivity Increase Credited to Installation
of Voice Recognition System
Situation:
A third-party provider, according to the warehouse manager, was
looking to improve the productivity in its receiving operations.
Problem:
“The level of noise in the dock area made us leery about pro-
ceeding with new technology,” he explains.
Solution:
“We were offered a no-risk trial period, so we installed the
speech recognition technology [Voxware, Inc.; Princeton,
N.J.], which allows receivers to speak the PO number and
store number for each package as it is unloaded from its re-
spective truck,” he details. “With speech recognition, we’ve
been able to increase the number of packages we can process
per hour. Further, the number of missorted packages has de-
creased by 50%.”

For many logistics managers there is still some suspicion about the nature of
supply chains. Similarly, many supply chain initiatives have produced less
than desirable returns. As a result, skeptics continue to ask, “Do I really need
supply chain management?”
“Yes, of course,” Larry L. Hessney, CPM, CFPIM, CIRM, worldwide
supply chain manager at Eastman Kodak Company (Rochester, N.Y.), an-
swers emphatically. At a recent Annual International Conference of the
American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS), he suggested
that “A better question is, ‘What level of sophistication do you need?’” He
differentiated the levels of supply chain management (SCM) as
• Basic SCM, which emphasizes getting the most out of your current
manufacturing resource planning (MRP)/enterprise resource planning
(ERP) tools and combining them with the effective use of SCM best prac-
tices, such as supplier partnerships and vendor managed inventory.
• Sophisticated SCM, which focuses on the newer information technol-
ogy (IT) tools for SCM optimization. “Sophisticated SCM is needed by
companies with large, complex supply chains or companies in industries
where competitive advantage can be gained with optimized supply chains.”
Basic SCM, he says, is adequate for smaller companies with simpler supply
chains, such as make-to-order operations.
729

Set Realistic Objectives
At the same APICS conference, Edward Topor, president of T/K Methods
Inc. (Lake Bluff, Ill.), introduced a supply chain proﬁciency model that
could help alleviate many of these problems.
This assessment tool identiﬁes the logical stages of supply chain proﬁ-
ciency measured against a comprehensive set of business characteristics (see
sidebar). The supply chain assessment model provides logistics professionals
with the means of developing a road map that describes a starting point, a
desired result, and the path to get there.
Prepare for the Proficiency Model
The methodology for completing the supply chain assessment is straightfor-
ward. The process includes the following steps:
1. Create a project plan. “A detailed project plan describes the project and
establishes the resources required to complete it,” says Topor. A project kick-
off meeting communicates the plan to management and all participants.
2. Develop “as is” supply chain proﬁciency model. This step provides the
baseline for supply chain improvements. Because each characteristic must
progress through the stages one at a time, the “as is” model provides the
starting point for analysis. “An objective evaluation of the current proﬁ-
ciency is a critical success factor of the assessment,” he reminds us. It includes
the key criteria for each characteristic that supports the stage assessments.
3. Develop “to be” supply chain proﬁciency model. The “to be” model re-
quires signiﬁcant management participation, he warns. “One can’t assume
Stage IV is a goal for every enterprise.” In developing the “to be” model,
management needs to exercise good judgment. The desirable target should
be a stretch for the organization to achieve. However, it must be a realistic
goal that can be achieved in two to three years. In the deliverable, the proj-
ect team must deﬁne a set of measurable criteria by characteristic for each
target stage. “The more speciﬁc the criteria, the easier it will be to deﬁne
projects,” Topor assures.
4. Perform a gap analysis. This step analyzes the difference between the
current and target situations. The critical success factor for this step is to
address the culture issues. “Supply chain management changes the way the
enterprise thinks,” he declares. “One or more organizational change

II. Aware
A crisis usually shifts management to the supply chain management paradigm. When management commits to supply chain man-
agement, the enterprise tends to take on the characteristics of Stage II. This stage introduces the concepts of cross-functional in-
tegration and cooperation with suppliers and customers. The aware stage focuses on site efﬁciency.
Business Environment. Stage II begins the evolution of an enterprise toward supply chain management. Pockets of excellence
begin to emerge. Although the culture remains focused on internal efﬁciencies, breaking down the walls of the internal supply
chain is a prerequisite to addressing the external supply chain.
Customer and Supplier Relations. Although Stage II activities are not always consciously related to supply chain management,
they indicate an awareness that the traditional model is inadequate. Supplier and customer relations may still have an adversarial
tone, but some cooperation begins to creep into the process. Criteria for this stage include
Customer:
•
Other functions besides sales interface with customers
•
Requirements are understood in greater detail (i.e., on-time delivery of 98%)
•
Participate in some customer-mandated supply chain programs
Supplier:
•
Teaming becomes a practice
•
Purchasing smarter is the mantra
•
End users participate with purchasing on requirements
•
“Team-by-day, scheme-by-night” approach still is prevalent.
Supply Chain Communications. In this stage, the lines of communication start to open, albeit slowly, with suppliers and cus-
tomers. Key criteria at this stage are:

•
Recognition that EDI requires a business focus
•
Expansion of customer EDI transaction sets
•
Initiation of supplier EDI
Information Systems. As the business progresses toward a more effective internal supply chain, integrated information systems
begin to evolve. Initially, these integrated systems tend to address operational requirements.
IV. Proﬁcient
An enterprise achieves full supply chain enterprise in Stage IV. This stage is characterized by a new paradigm. An enterprise can-
not progress to this stage alone. An Integrated Supply Chain (ISC) network allows multiple enterprises to operate as a single en-
tity. The virtual company—where the boundaries of business become blurred—becomes a reality. Criteria include alliances, col-
laboration, and interactive information sharing.
Business Environment. Stage IV fully implements the supply chain management paradigm. The ISC provides collaboration ca-
pabilities where sophisticated sensitivity analysis models determine the effects of change in products, supply sources, delivery op-
tions, and manufacturing alternatives.
Customer and Supplier Relations. At Stage IV the enterprise succeeds in breaking all the barriers of the traditional model.
Suppliers and customers work in total harmony.
Customer:
•
Value chain extends out to ﬁnal consumer
•
ISC becomes extremely sophisticated
•
Full conversion from push to pull demand management
•
Going to market as a supply chain
(continued)

Supplier:
•
Supply chain extends back to raw material provider
•
Supply chain heavily inﬂuenced by customer requirements
•
Working with suppliers, as a single entity, on research and development
•
Collaboration on marketing strategy
Supply Chain Communications. Communications are instantaneous and extend to the lowest practical levels of the supply
chain. Major supply chain communications criteria are:
•
Internet introduced for customer communications
•
Supplier EDI fully implemented
•
Instantaneous communications to all ISC members.
Information Systems. Sophisticated information systems are in place that extend ERP to include collaborative planning soft-
ware. There is an extensive use of the Internet for electronic commerce.

management projects will be necessary within each characteristic.” For each
characteristic, the team must deﬁne projects to progress logically from the
“as is” to the “to be” states.
5. Create a supply chain management plan. The project team organizes
projects across characteristics. “One objective is to achieve some ‘quick
hits,’” he advises. Another is to maintain some semblance of balance across
the supply chain proﬁciency model. The ﬁnal deliverable for this project is
created in this step. For the most part, the team organizes the information
developed in previous steps. An exception is that the team also creates de-
tailed project plans for the next-step projects to be initiated within three
months.
6. Gain management approval. The ﬁnal step of the assessment includes
developing a management presentation that summarizes the contents of the
ﬁnal report, presenting it to management, and gaining their approval to pro-
ceed.

New technology is exciting, but we can’t let it cloud our view of other crit-
ical, but less obvious, elements. Good logistics practice starts with organiza-
tional structure, alliances, and stafﬁng.
Two recent studies, one by a team at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison (UW) and the other from Deloitte Consulting, offer an excellent
way to keep perspective. They conclude that technology is one of four es-
sential supply chain “enablers”:
1. Organizational infrastructure. The respondents to the UW study felt
that the organizational infrastructure was the most important enabler of
supply chain implementation (see Table III-1.1). The UW research identi-
ﬁed a list of organizational attributes, which the survey respondents ranked
in Table III-1.2.
However, a similar study, Energizing the Supply Chain, by Deloitte
Consulting (404-631-2420; www.dc.com), ﬁnds little movement toward
integrating responsibilities for the full supply chain, including reverse logis-
tics, customer service, and production planning. The problem here is that
Insights from the Pros

without cross-functional alignment, companies will fail to deliver optimum
supply chain performance.
2. Strategic alliances. The enabler receiving the most mention in the UW
report centered on understanding the expectations of the alliance partners
(see Table III-1.3). The message here is that shippers and receivers cannot
get the job done alone, but require alliances with suppliers, customers, and
third-party logistics providers.
Despite the beneﬁts of partnering, customers and suppliers are not ready
to collaborate fully in extended supply chain management. This reluctance

may stem from an inability to establish relationships that serve the business
objectives of all parties involved.
In addition, although some are committed to pursuing higher levels of
performance, they are less willing to share knowledge and risk. Once ﬁrms
recognize the importance of information sharing, they will better be able to
integrate the extended supply chain. To support these relationships, many
companies use the Internet (see Table III-1.4).
3. Human resources management. As a factor in enabling successful supply
chain performance, respondents rated human resources management as
slightly less important than technology and strategic alliances. This may re-
ﬂect the possibility that many ﬁrms have not confronted human resource is-
sues when designing and implementing their supply chain practices, the au-
thors write. As many companies struggle to ﬁnd skilled and knowledgeable
labor, it is not surprising that respondents rank hiring skilled management as
a key enabler (see Table III-1.5).
4. Technology. This includes data coding and structures, such as Ameri-
can National Standards Institute (ANSI); data capture, such as bar coding;
data collection, such as global positioning systems (GPSs); handling and

In the UW study, two types of technology were identiﬁed: information
technology and manufacturing/materials handling technology (see Tables
III-1.6 and III-1.7). Despite the importance of this area, however, fewer
than one-third have a formal strategic information systems plan. Even more
problematic, the Deloitte study notes that those that do are having to rein-
vest in the systems in place, because of their ineffectivness in carrying out
supply chain initiatives (see Table III-1.8). Nonetheless, by extending the
enterprise backbone, companies can leverage new opportunities, such as e-
commerce procurement and collaboration forecasting.

Two Key Points
Before jumping into an integration project, ﬁrst make sure you follow a
phased approach to SCM. In conjunction with industry practitioners (in
particular representatives from 3M), UW developed a nine-step approach to
SCM implementation. 
Next, appoint a supply chain leader. The UW study team set out to
identify how widespread the supply chain title had become in organizations.
Among attendees at UW seminars, only 10% had a person with a supply
chain title in the organization. Furthermore, 59% said they were involved in
supply chain initiatives. The UW team reached out to the Council of Lo-
gistics Management (CLM) and found that only 2.5% had supply chain in
their titles.
The authors of the study believe that “companies may have difﬁculty
implementing initiatives if top management does not understand the supply
chain opportunity and appoint a leader to capitalize on the opportunity.”

The new PulseMark benchmarks give purchasing professionals a unique
perspective—all of the data refer to single plant sites. The other appealing
feature of PulseMark is that the benchmarks are categorized according to six
basic production processes (discrete, assemble-to-order, repetitive, process,
job shop, and engineer-/build-to-order). 
Purchasing effectiveness improves signiﬁcantly.

facturers (NAM) together with McGladrey & Pullen, LLP, and RSM Mc-
Gladrey, deﬁnes purchasing effectiveness as the “total yearly purchase price
variance as a percent of total yearly materials purchased.” The purchasing ef-
fectiveness benchmark (see Figure III-1.1), based on data collected from sur-
veys sent to over 25,000 U.S. companies with one or more manufacturing
sites, shows a positive trend from the prior year’s performance.
For example, in the discrete sector the “average” benchmark has fallen
a full percentage point (to 1.9%). In the assemble-to-order category, the av-
erage was slashed by half (to 1.1%), with the “worst” measure freefalling
from 6.9% to 2.2% in the most recent study.
Duane C. Oest, executive vice president of RSM McGladrey, Inc.
(Schaumburg, Ill.; duane_oest@rsmi.com), reports that contributing factors
for the improved performance include reducing the number of suppliers and
entering into supply agreements with preferred suppliers. He also adds,
“When evaluating purchasing effectiveness, purchasing professionals should
also examine the hidden overnight/express freight charges associated with
poorly planned, expedited material purchases.”
Cost of processing a purchase order continues to slide.

are continuing their assault on reducing costs to process a PO (see Figure III-

1.2). According to the PulseMark data, the best performing organizations
continue to lead this downward plunge. 
For example, among those with the “best” performance, those in the
ATO category reported a decrease of $3.25 (to $5.00); among ETO elite the
fall was an impressive $7.00 (to $15.00). For the record, the “average” cost
in most manufacturing categories also showed a similar decline.
Future benchmarks to be impacted by supply chain integration and e-purchasing.
“While it is difﬁcult to distinguish differences between supply chain inte-
gration and Web-based electronic commerce, there is no doubt that this
technology is taking hold,” Oest tells us in an exclusive interview. “From an
aggregated U.S. manufacturing perspective, acquisition of materials across
the Web is well past the introductory stage and is well into mainstream prac-
tice,” he declares.
However, Oest is quick to acknowledge that there are sizable variations
across industries and supply chains. Based on annual PulseMark surveys and
a recent NAM e-commerce survey, for some supply chains—particularly
electronics and automotive—e-Commerce is required, not requested. “The
ﬁrms are fairly advanced in Web-based purchasing,” he notes. “In other
types of ﬁrms with different supply chains and different integration needs,
the amount of material acquisition is down in the 22% to 25% range.”

Standards for Web-based “buy-side” material acquisition not ready for prime time.
The use of the Internet within manufacturing has been divided by software
vendors into the “buy-side” and “sell-side,” explains Oest. The sell-side
strategy is deﬁned as development of electronic processes to present and sell
products through the Internet.
The buy-side provides an increased ability to ﬁnd, price, and purchase
materials through the Internet. In NAM’s survey, only 32% of all manufac-
turers are actively acquiring materials across the Web. Speciﬁcally, from this
base, 92% buy MRO, 43% examine product catalogs, 32% seek customer
service/support, and 23% look for new products. Oest observes, “The def-
inition of MRO items over the past few years has expanded to include a
wide array of ofﬁce- and computer-related supplies.”
Increased productivity to be mirrored in tomorrow’s yardsticks?
The NAM survey
speciﬁcally asked senior manufacturing executives about their core strategies
behind the e-business objective (see Figure III-1.3). Maintaining a “true
supply chain perspective,” the surveyed executives believe that “increased
productivity will be applied downstream to their suppliers.”
However, Oest suggests that “you’ll also need to keep in mind that the
same supply chain streamlining process you’re applying to your suppliers will
be applied by your customers to your company.” As this process continues
to ripple through industries and across supply tiers, the “stress that will be
placed on all supply chain members will be incredible,” he declares. “Link-
age of Web-based tools to the core transaction systems within each company
will be the key that deﬁnes both short- and long-term success for each ﬁrm.”
But Oest issues a warning: “Before participating in either the sell-side or
buy-side, purchasing professionals must have full control of all aspects of their
existing business process.” In other words, “all the ‘old’ issues are back again.”
Knowledge of product costs, margins, ﬂexibility, material costs,
throughput, and quality are going to be required. As a supply chain manager
responded, “This new process provides a real competitive weapon to the
companies that have their core business processes under control; heaven help
those that are ‘winging’ it.”

made with a balanced focus,” maintains Jim Limperis, C.P.M., CFPIM, sen-
ior contracts manager, supply management, at Motorola, Inc. (Mansﬁeld,
Mass.; James.Limperis@motorola.com). The initiatives that Motorola and
its suppliers took to strengthen their supply chain serve as a current model
(see sidebar).
Identify the speciﬁc weak links in the chain.
“It is naive to assume that the
supply chain will always be running on all cylinders,” Limperis reminded at-
tendants at a National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) An-
nual Internal Purchasing Conference. “At any given time there are funda-
mental links in the supply chain that are weaker than others,” he emphasized.
In fact, Limperis goes so far as to acknowledge, “It is not always easy to
see ourselves as we really are.” At Motorola, the suppliers are encouraged to
offer feedback in an open and nonthreatening manner. “If this is not done,
weak links within our functional organizations are not exposed,” he insists. 
Solicit supplier feedback.
Motorola invites feedback, both formally and in-
formally, to “ensure two-way ﬂow of information. The formal method
comprises a one-page checklist of some 20 traits. The supplier rates Mo-
torola on a six-point scale against each trait.
“We also ask the supplier to rate its best customer, whose identity is not
revealed, after Motorola,” Limperis notes. “This provides a worthwhile
benchmark by trait.” Supplier feedback allows the supplier to grade Mo-
torola on attributes such as early supplier involvement, response to cost re-
duction ideas, purchasing professionalism, schedule stability and communi-
cations, ethics, partnership performance, technical support, and forecast
accuracy, among others.
Introduce activity-based costing (ABC).
This is an excellent tool to identify
weak links in the process. “ABC costing can provide the proper discipline to
the customer’s organization to identify cost drivers inherent in the process
and to eliminate them,” he explains. The challenge is to identify cost drivers
that impact the supply chain.
At Motorola, they identify each component within a BOM as a cost ob-
ject. Based on assorted quantiﬁable supply management and component/
quality engineering criteria, a two-letter rating is assigned to each part num-
ber. The four ratings are “preferred,” “acceptable,” “restricted,” and “un-
acceptable.”
Supply management and engineering each assign a rating to the part.

Look beyond Traditional Customer-Supplier Relationships to
Strengthen Supply Chain Links
“Supply chain management integrates and manages the ﬂow of material and
information across organizations to meet customer needs,” explains Jim
Limperis. These linkages must go beyond traditional customer-supplier rela-
tionships to encompass new practices. They include such factors as shared
planning, inventory, human resources, information technology systems, and
even corporate cultures.
Recently, Motorola’s Internet and Networking Group embarked on an
aggressive outsourcing effort. “We worked closely with the qualiﬁed elec-
tronic manufacturing service [EMS] provider to ensure that the customer
would not be impacted by production interruptions while the products were
being outsourced,” he explains. “The EMS provider was viewed as an exten-
sion to our internal factory, and we could not afford any weak links across the
supply chain.” Limperis describes how the various elements came together:
•
Shared planning. The EMS provider and Motorola worked closely with
information technology to ensure that the respective ERP systems electroni-
cally communicated sales order needs in real time. Since the systems were not
compatible at the outset, a weak link quickly developed. “Manual monitor-
ing of forecasted demands and sales orders ensued until the information tech-
nology modiﬁcations patched up the chain,” he explains.
•
Inventory. Supply orders with Motorola’s suppliers were canceled and
reentered between the EMS provider and suppliers so that supply lines were
not impacted. Motorola sold component inventory to the EMS provider on
a quarter-by-quarter basis.
•
Human resources. Because many direct employees were affected by this
outsourcing effort, both human resource organizations worked together to
allow displaced employees an opportunity to work directly for the EMS
provider. This enabled the employees to continue to work in their ﬁelds of
expertise on the same product. For the provider, they gained instant access to
experienced operators with no training required and no recruiting expenses
incurred. For Motorola, they earned goodwill by ensuring continued em-
ployment of displaced employees and smooth transition of the product to the
EMS provider without interruptions to customers. In addition, they reduced
the cost of operation by eliminating the ﬁxed-cost component of cost of
goods sold.
•
Corporate culture. “Although difﬁcult to quantify, it is important that
the ﬂexibility and responsiveness required by Motorola in responding to cus-
tomer needs be communicated clearly to the EMS provider,” Limperis ex-
plains. “Equally important, the EMS provider must assimilate the Motorola
corporate culture so that performance remains unchanged and the physical
outsourcing of the product is transparent to the customer.”

Some of the criteria to establish the overall ratings include lead time, cost,
current supplier, sole versus single source, and custom versus standard com-
ponent. As an example, if a single ASIC has extended lead times due to allo-
cation issues, is expensive, requires adding a new supplier to the database who
needs to be qualiﬁed, will result in a sole source, and is a custom component,
then the part will probably be classiﬁed as restricted or unacceptable.
“We, as the customer, may be the weak link in many of these criteria be-
cause we have been inﬂexible in specifying strict speciﬁcations that prevent
the component from being a standard, single-source, readily available com-
ponent,” he explains. “There may be applications which dictate high per-
formance chips that force our hand. However, there are numerous oppor-
tunities via ABC management to identify and eliminate cost drivers that
impact supply chain value,” says Limperis.
Introduce a supply chain ombudsman.
There are usually three sides to every
story: the customer’s, the supplier’s, and—somewhere in between—the
truth. “Most times it’s the latter,” Limperis concedes. “Unless there is a
diplomatic but forceful ombudsman assessing the degree of ‘over-the-wall-
let-the-supplier-ﬁgure-it-out’ activity that exists, these weak links can cause
rapid oxidation to the supply chain.”
An astute supply chain ombudsman will ﬁnd opportunities to expose
weak links in the supply chain and drive timely resolution to strengthen
them. An example is a supplier review.
Motorola uses a supplier satisfaction score sheet to measure suppliers’
performances on a weekly basis for key electronic service providers. The
score sheet assesses the supplier’s quality, delivery, communication, service,
and technical performance. A grade (A to D) is assigned for each parameter.
Guidelines accompany the report so that the latter scores equate to a quasi-
quantiﬁable metric.
Any scores below a B warrant corrective action by the supplier. “The
advantage of this scoring methodology is that it can be done fairly easily with
minimal data tabulation,” he explains. The disadvantage is the potential sub-
jectivity in scoring, particularly with communication and service. The
supply chain manager can use this tool to drive improved performance both
with the supplier and internally as well.
“There are numerous examples of mismanagement of the supply chain
due to the customer’s myopic view of partner responsibility,” Limperis
shares. “The supply chain manager must assume the role of ombudsman to
change the culture of internal customers so that responsibilities become joint

opportunities to correct problems that impact the supply chain and, ulti-
mately, the customer.”

It is easy to dismiss collaboration as another buzzword in the lexicon of today’s
business world. However, the impact of collaboration on the supply or value
chain and on reducing inventory levels throughout the chain increases daily.
Collaboration and inventory reduction relationship.
A recent survey of 2,000
U.S. manufacturers not only identiﬁes the impact of collaboration on the
supply chain but also reviews the practices that are most effective in reduc-
ing inventory levels. High Performance Value Chains (Cap Gemini Ernst &
Young, www.capgemini.com, in collaboration with Industry Week) ﬁnds
that “innovation, sharing speciﬁc types of information with customers and
suppliers, and improved inventory strategies help to create value chain col-
laboration.”
“As more companies pursue internal models of cross-functional team-
ing, the types of information being shared between trading partners and the
strategies being implemented are the signiﬁcant differentiators,” the co-
authors (Al Youngberg, vice president of global supply chain practice,
al.youngberg@us.cgeyc.com, and Kevin O’Laughlin, vice president of glo-
bal supply chain practice, kevin.o’laughlin@us.cgeyc.com) report. Not sur-
prisingly, the information most shared with suppliers is purchase orders,
followed by inventory and production information. However, sharing data
with customers takes on a “dramatically different perspective,” they ﬁnd.
The data that are shared the most include new product development infor-
mation, followed by production, inventory, and sales order information.
Value chain collaboration involves gaining trust of partners and sharing reliable data.
That is a major conclusion of the survey. “The ﬁndings strongly show that
companies with top-performing value chains share a wider range of infor-
mation with their customers and suppliers than do those with poor-
performing value chains,” Youngberg and O’Laughlin report.
The value chain survey veriﬁes that collaboration and information shar-
ing deliver a wealth of beneﬁts, such as timelier delivery of goods, reduced
inventory costs, and enhanced product quality using the knowledge of all

partners. For example, 51% of respondents in excellent or very good chains
report the tangible beneﬁt of inventory reduction. Only 18% in poor chains
do. Overall, 35% of respondents say they have reduced inventory through
collaboration (see Figures III-1.4, III-1.5, and III-1.6).
Collaborative inventory strategies reduce value chain inventory levels.
“Collabo-
rative inventory strategies are effective in reducing inventory levels when in-
formation replaces inventory,” maintain Youngberg and O’Laughlin. Infor-
mation becomes available by sharing between suppliers and customers or
because collaborative strategies allow decisions requiring requirements to be

delayed until information regarding real demand becomes available, they ex-
plain. According to the survey, the most commonly used inventory man-
agement practices are just-in-time (JIT) delivery, vendor managed inven-
tory (VMI), and real-time inventory tracking. 
“Some collaborative inventory strategies, such as VMI, may not take in-
ventory out of the value chain, but may merely shift the ownership of the
product, thus increasing inventory levels for one party and decreasing them
for another,” they caution. They also note other collaborative inventory re-
duction strategies, although at the present time they are “less widely em-
braced.” They include
• Collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR). One
fourth of the respondents say they practice CPFR, in which both supplier
and customer share information on demand and product availability so that
each can plan more effectively.
• Cross docking. Product is moved directly from the receiving dock to
the shipping dock without placing the product in storage. Cross docking re-
quires real-time communication and information from suppliers, as the re-
ceiving function must know what is on a shipment before it arrives.
• Merge-in-transit. Order components from suppliers are brought to-
gether at a merge hub, consolidated, and then shipped to customers. Because
ﬁnal consolidation takes place immediately before shipment to the customer
based on known customer requirements, there is no need to maintain in-
ventory of consolidated products.

Inventory reductions are most noticeable in the top quartile of the survey responses.
A small number of companies in each industry are very effectively imple-
menting collaborative inventory strategies. In each case, the authors note,
these represent the industry’s top performers, which are “enjoying a signif-
icant competitive advantage due to the adaptation of these strategies.” Fol-
lowing are examples:
• Automotive/industrial products. In this sector, collaborative inventory
strategies such as cross docking with suppliers result in a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in inventory levels. The survey shows that inventory turns for the top
quartile exceed 40 turns for those using cross docking versus 25 turns for the
entire automotive response (see Figure III-1.7). Similarly, inventory turns
for the top quartile of the industrial products industry exceed 13 for those
using cross docking, compared with 10 for the entire industry response. 
• High technology. The companies with high-performing chains are two to
four times more likely to share multiple types of information. Less widely prac-
ticed than other inventory management strategies, cross docking with suppli-
ers does result in inventory reductions among the high-tech companies. Those
companies practicing merge-in-transit with suppliers also realized signiﬁcant
inventory reductions. The top quartile for the industry as a whole reported in-

ventory turns of 12 or greater. The top quartile of those companies using
merge-in-transit report inventory turns of 32 or greater. That represents almost
a threefold reduction in inventory levels using this collaborative strategy.
• Retail/consumer goods. Information sharing is a major component of
the strategic imperative for companies in this sector. Purchase orders, prod-
uct information, inventory levels, and sales forecasts are the top information
items shared. Within consumer goods manufacturing, several collaborative
inventory techniques are used, including JIT deliveries, cross docking, resi-
dent suppliers, VMI, consignment, synchronized demand/supply planning,
and CPFR. The study shows that some of these strategies result in real in-
ventory savings across the supply chain, while other strategies merely de-
crease inventory at one point and increase it at another.

While inventory managers work diligently to apply supply chain manage-
ment solutions, others are pushing the concept to new dimensions. One of
the latest is the legendary Jim Tompkins, president and founder of Tomp-
kins Associates, Inc. (Raleigh, N.C.; www.tompkinsinc.com). He’s now
talking about supply chain synthesis, which “picks up where supply chain
management leaves off.”
Introducing supply chain synthesis.
Tompkins declares, “Supply chain man-
agement as a link optimization methodology does not work. We don’t need
a methodology; we need a process of continuous improvement. That’s
supply chain synthesis,” he explained in his keynote address at a recent Dis-
tribution/Computer Seminar (sponsored by C. S. Report Inc.; Uwchland,
Pa.; www.logistar.com).
In deﬁning supply chain synthesis, he identiﬁes the 10 commandments
of e-SCS as
• Nimbleness. As in responsiveness, “You don’t waste three days on a
12-week WMS implementation, you don’t waste weekends, and you don’t
let the 8 to 5 clock get in the way,” he admonishes. “You use technology to
work 24/7 to get the job done.” Tompkins declares, “We really have to be
nimble in everything we do to make sure we can be responsive to the needs
of that marketplace. We have to understand that the business will change
and, therefore, the e-supply chain synthesis must change with it.”
Insights from the Pros
751

• Speed. “If you don’t ride fast, you will die,” he emphasizes. “The
bumpier the trail, the steeper the slope, the faster you must go.” Therefore,
he advises that you “get a whole new thought process on speed. We need to
understand the issue of speed is different than it once was.”
• Continuous improvement. “Today’s great solution is tomorrow’s pretty
good solution,” Tompkins describes. “We have to adjust constantly.”
• Breadth. “There is no business as usual,” he states. “Everything you do
is different.”
• Holism. “First you need to understand within your own link and then
understand the chain,” he offers. “You don’t create a chain. What you do is
create two links that work together and then add another link, and another.
That’s how you evolve to eSCS.”
• Customer satisfaction. “People tend to use the words customer service and
customer satisfaction as if they mean something similar,” he suggests. Customer
service is about what you do for the customer, while customer satisfaction is
about what the customer gets from you, Tompkins explains.
• Best practices. “We have to understand that best practices are not some-
thing that’s ﬁxed, but something that’s continuously evolving” he offers.
“Your job is not to try to benchmark against someone else who may be ob-
solete. Your objective is to create the new best practice and carry it to the
next level.” 
• Global perspective. Tompkins declares, “There is no longer any re-
gional strategy in business. In fact, where was the location of the Web site
you were on last evening—who cares?”
• Quality communication. “The whole trading exchange concept and
technology is about communication. But if all you have is communications,
you really don’t have an integrated supply chain,” he charges.
• A focus on the bottom line. “We need to better understand where all of
this impacts the bottom line, and to continuously focus attention on it,”
Tompkins declares. Ask the question of every integrated supply chain you’re
working with: what is the return on investment (ROI), return on assets
(ROA), and proﬁtability.
The supply chain synthesis benchmark.
Tompkins has developed a diagnostic
tool to assist in benchmarking your organization and to identify your status
in 10 key areas where your organization must address “integration and tur-
bulence” in the pursuit of supply chain synthesis (see sidebar). A complete

pipeline, and are efforts ongoing to improve total pipeline inventory turns?
•
Has the pipeline been synchronized and aligned to allow for a seam-
less ﬂow of goods and information?
•
Has the market seasonality been documented, deﬁned, and under-
stood, and has the pipeline been conﬁgured to handle this seasonality efﬁ-
ciently and effectively?
4. Synthesis
•

Do we actively seek out information on the changes in our market-
place and work toward harnessing the energy of these changes to our com-
petitive advantage?
•
Do we focus attention on, encourage, and reward risk taking, inno-
vation, and creativity?
•
Is there an effective set of supply chain synthesis performance mea-
sures in place that is widely communicated throughout the pipeline?

The twenty-ﬁrst century supply chain calls for lower inventory levels and re-
duced working capital. Accurate lead times and forecasts, physical staging to
ﬁnd shortages, annual physical inventories, and multiple BOMs are obsolete,
states Dave Garwood, president of R. D. Garwood, Inc. (Marietta, Ga.; www.
rdgarwood.com). They are replaced with supplier-managed inventories, de-
mand planning to reduce variation, simulations to anticipate and avoid short-
ages, and quickly conﬁgured BOMs for custom products (see sidebar).
Garwood’s remarks set the stage at Congress for Progress XXV (spon-
sored by the Mid-Atlantic chapters of APICS), which focused on inventory
management in the supply chain. Experts shared real-life ideas on how to
maximize inventory reduction opportunities in the supply chain. Among
the thought-provoking actions were the following:
Collaborating on identifying system constraints.
William T. Walker, CFPIM,
CIRM, power products supply chain manager at Agilent Technologies
(Rockaway, N.J.), suggests, “Supply chain inventory should be positioned
before the system constraint [constraint buffer] and at the customer end of
the chain [shipping buffer].” The level of inventory in these two buffers can
be managed to a days-of-supply target. The trading partners who do not
own either the constraint buffer or the shipping buffer should then strive to
drive all other inventory out of the system.
You can best manage day-to-day operations by monitoring two global
performance measures, states Walker. Supply chain throughput equals the
net amount of product (shipments minus returns) transferred to the cus-
tomer at the very end of the supply chain. It should be measured daily by
SKU in units.
The daily throughput by SKU at the end of the chain can then be com-
pared with the daily throughput by equivalent SKU and offset by one day to
verify synchronization among each of the trading partners.
The second measure is total supply chain inventory, which is the sum of
equivalent SKUs in the shipping buffer plus the constraint buffer plus each

Supply Chain is Now a “Demand and Supply” Chain
Some 82% of senior executives in Fortune 500 companies with responsibility
for supply chain management believe that Internet technology will have a ma-
jor impact, or totally transform, their supply chain performance within the
next three years. That’s one of the revealing conclusions from a new research
study, Moving the Supply Chain into the Digital Age: Integrating Demand and
Supply (a joint project of the Economist Intelligence Unit and Meritus Con-
sulting; www.eiu.com/latest/meritus.asp).
Another is that although high-quality performance throughout the
supply chain is critical, many companies are ill prepared to integrate digital
technology or reduce their cycle times. The research team observes, “Com-
panies urgently need to achieve major improvements in the current business
processes that support order fulﬁllment, operations, and incoming and out-
going logistics.”
If companies are going to develop the high levels of supply chain perfor-
mance necessary to succeed in the digital age, senior managers must clearly
understand their customers’ expectations, their own company’s performance,
and their suppliers’ performance. “All companies in the supply chain should
be involved in forecasting demand and planning supply,” the report states. 
“Senior executives must ensure that each ‘link’ or node clearly under-
stands and complies with the end-customers’ demand and delivery require-
ments. Because no forecast is perfect, accurate, near real-time information
about the plan should be shared throughout the extended enterprise, includ-
ing employees and business partners, to rapidly facilitate any necessary reme-
dial actions.”
Supply and demand planning is the most important business process needed to integrate
with the supply chain.
Within this category, well over two-thirds of the sen-
ior executive respondents believe that supplier/partner relationships, pro-
curement and sourcing, inventory management, delivery management, and
cost reduction strategies are the most critical integration issues.
“Internet technology is the key to achieving this integration,” the re-
searchers note. “Organizations must go beyond simply building Web sites and
aim to create innovative solutions throughout the extended enterprise, from
fulﬁllment and procurement to knowledge management and training.”
Rapid and effective communications speed inventory data.
The increased outsourc-
ing of almost all business functions (with the exception of materials management,
the survey notes) and supply chain management in its entirety increases the need
for fast and ﬂawless communication. Respondents expect that the supply chain
will increasingly communicate electronically over the next three years. 
Most signiﬁcantly, typical supply chain information—such as inventory
data, requests for quotations, fund transfer, planning data, delivery tracking,
and sales forecasting—is expected to see the greatest increase in digital com-
munications (see Figure III-1.8).

of the in-transit pipeline inventories plus any other undesirable inventory at
each trading partner. It should be measured daily and in units.
Three tools for successful inventory reduction in the supply chain.
Mark K.
Williams, CFPIM, consulting manager at the North Highland Company
(Atlanta, Ga.; mwilliams@north-highland.com) said that it is easy to be a
participant in a world-class supply chain, but another thing to actually pull
it off. “To do so, one needs to change the way one does business and em-
ploy the tools that are critical to supply chain success.” He lists three:
1. Schedule sharing. “By sharing one’s schedule with the supplier, the op-
portunity to work with real demand is provided, not a forecast,” he relates.
This also allows the supplier to reduce the amount of ﬁnished goods safety
stock on hand, thereby reducing costs.
2. Consignment. “If one developed a comprehensive consignment
agreement, which included customer responsibility for insurance, obsoles-
cence, and shrinkage, one could reduce annual inventory carrying cost by
40% to 50%,” he claims.
3. Vendor managed inventory. Here, suppliers actually take on the responsi-
bility of managing their inventory throughout their customers’ supply chain.

The key advantage of VMI, he notes, is replacing the forecast with hard data.
“By knowing exactly how much inventory the customer is carrying, a sup-
plier’s own inventory requirements are reduced since the need for excess stock
to buffer against uncertainty is reduced or eliminated,” Williams explains.
Assessing supply chain capabilities.
Karen L. Alber, CFPIM, director of busi-
ness solutions at Quaker Oats Company (Chicago), recommends conduct-
ing a performance analysis against current and future customer require-
ments. Areas to be assessed include inventory levels, cycle times, delivery
times, and perfect order completion.
In addition, Alber assures that “successful supply chains must link cus-
tomers and suppliers through collaborative planning and forecasting.” Col-
laborative planning allows companies to improve efﬁciencies by comanag-
ing business processes, in which partners share information on forecasts,
product movement, inventory, and demand. 
All of this, meanwhile, increases the focus and commitment to integrated
systems, such as ERP and advanced planning and scheduling (APS), both of
which improve information availability across the organization, she explains.
Prepping for entry into the supply chain.
Jack Symon, CFPIM, CIRM, CPM,
senior manager of e-solutions at Whittman-Hart (Florham Park, N.J.; jack.
symon@whittman-hart.com), had an urgent message for the audience.
“Even if you choose not to actively join the supply chain management move-
ment yourself, most likely many of your suppliers or customers will choose
to do so,” he explains. “As part of their supply chain, you will be assimilated.”
To join the supply chain movement, Symon suggests the following: 
• Reevaluate all internal/external processes and relationships and de-
termine how your business infrastructure will be affected and how your cul-
ture will be altered by entry into the supply chain movement.
• Evaluate the operation and effectiveness of your ERP/MRP system
and supporting processes. Does it support operating and information needs
of the newly shared vision? Can it be integrated to support the needs of cus-
tomers and suppliers? What is the level of inventory accuracy?
• Brainstorm with customers and suppliers to develop an execution
plan for evolving to a supply chain environment. “Establish an achievable
pace,” he urges. “Start simple and then progress—team and learn from
stronger channel partners.”

An interesting trend is emerging in inventory management: The mathemat-
ics of inventory management are changing from the traditional counting of
inventory as a corporate asset to managing inventory as a supply chain asset.
Total inventory investment is coming down.
The recent 21st annual inventory
study by Pittiglio Rabin Todd & McGrath (PRTM) veriﬁes this trend (see
sidebar). “The new ‘hot potato’ math of inventory management says that
companies no longer have to have physical possession of their inventory to
achieve optimum balance that will maximize proﬁtability,” maintains Todd
Bargman, principal, PRTM (Waltham, Mass.; tbargman@prtm.com).
The result is not only a consolidation of supply-chain assets that are
reducing the total inventory investment in the supply chain, but also a

United States Leads World in Inventory Performance
For the past ﬁve years, U.S. companies have led the way in improving inven-
tory performance, according to the PRTM data. For instance, inventory turns
are up over 12%, to an overall average of 5.4 turns, and inventory days of supply
are down 16% to just under 63 days (see Figure III-1.11). “This improvement
trend has been driven by the need to support falling margins (down over 7%)
as overall growth has dwindled from a high of nearly 15% per year to just over
6%,” observes Todd Bargman. Strong price pressures have put most companies
on the offensive to lower costs through improved inventory management.
In Japan, inventory metrics hold constant.
Many inventory management initia-
tives were placed on the back burner due to the Asian crises and overall eco-
nomic conditions. Inventory metrics have held steady despite the signiﬁcant
downturn that has caused negative growth for the past three years. The only
exception is the computer segment, which has shown strong inventory per-
formance improvements in nearly all metrics.
In Europe, focus remains on operational efﬁciency.
Leading ﬁrms in each sector
have centralized distribution and reduced the number of inventory locations
across Europe. Their focus is now on integration with suppliers and key cus-
tomers. Overall, cash-to-cash cycle time in Europe has slowly decreased for
ﬁve straight years (see Figure III-1.12), and inventory as a percentage of rev-
enue has decreased four points to 15%, from a high of 18.7% in 1995. 

dramatic shift of inventory upstream in the supply chain. “Leading compa-
nies have signiﬁcantly lowered their ‘four-wall’ inventory levels by partner-
ing with suppliers and have turned inventory levels from a cost to be con-
trolled to an operating philosophy that is a competitive advantage,” he
explains in PRTM’s Insight.
Why moving inventory up the supply chain is working.
“Advanced information
management tools and techniques are enabling the movement of inventory
upstream in the supply chain,” he reports. Another factor is the redesign of
business processes to the concept of an extended or integrated supply chain.
High-performing companies that have adopted advanced tools are re-
quiring more sophisticated inventory management practices from their sup-
pliers, the PRTM study reports. Supplier/vendor-managed inventory, di-
rect/drop ship, innovative replenishment techniques (breadman, milk run),
consignment inventory, supplier-managed hubs, and third-party logistics
services are the approaches that are here to stay, Bargman concludes.
Rate of adoption not the same for all.
The recent inventory study also shows
that the rate of change varies across the technology industry segments. “Lev-
els of inventory performance previously seen as unattainable have quickly
been reached and surpassed by leading computer companies,” he points out.
Other segments, such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals (see Figures III-
1.9 and III-1.10), are slow, so far, to adopt new inventory practices but are
already starting to see the impact of changes downstream in their supply
chain.

“It is now clearly a vital job requirement of supply chain managers to
have an acute understanding of their company’s and their industry’s state of
evolution in inventory management relative to their competitors and supply
chain partners,” Bargman prods.
The latest look at how various technology segments are doing.
PRTM’s latest in-
ventory study includes over 350 companies across eight technology seg-
ments. This overview includes
• Computers. At the leading edge of the trend, this sector has been fo-
cusing on supply chain management practices in response to heavy compe-
tition and price pressure. Over the past four years, computer companies
worldwide have cut inventory days of supply by 20% to 40%, while inven-
tory as a percentage of revenue has “fallen to rock- bottom levels” (just over
1% in Europe, and 6% to 8% in the United States and Japan). This improve-
ment in the computer sector has come at the expense of components man-
ufacturers. According to Bargman, “despite aggressive supply chain man-
agement improvement efforts,” they have only been able to achieve modest
gains in inventory days of supply (5% to 8%) and no change in inventory as
a percentage of revenue.
• Telecommunications/Equipment/Diversiﬁed. These electronics-related
segments are beginning to follow suit. The telecom industry is starting to
reap the beneﬁts of outsourcing, component storage environments, and
moving inventory upstream. Inventory days of supply hit ﬁve-year lows, at
73 days in the United States and 93 days in Europe. Correspondingly, in-
ventory turns in the telecom segment rose solidly above four in the United
States and Japan. They are also at a ﬁve-year high in Europe, at just below
four. Similar to the components segment, the equipment and diversiﬁed seg-
ments have seen mixed results, according to Bargman. “They are caught in
that tight spot between customers who push back on accepting equipment
until the last minute and trying to move their own material inventories back
to their suppliers.
Other high-tech industries just beginning to make the break.
Bargman details the
following examples:
• Aerospace and defense (A&D). This industry has already started to focus
on inventory management practices. For example, some companies are
making supply chain strategy a key element in the bid process for major con-
764
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

tracts. With the decline in spending, A&D gross margins have held steady
while key inventory metrics have shown impressive gains.
For example, inventory days of supply in the United States are down
over 10% to 77 days. They are down a dramatic 20% in Europe, to 103 days.
In addition, inventory turns are up to ﬁve-year highs, reaching over 4.8 in
the United States, and cash-to-cash cycles times are trending down across all
three geographic regions.
• Pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutical ﬁrms’ inventory DOS are at 1.5 to 2
times those of the average for other industries across three regions. With gross
margins of 60% to 70% (twice those of the study average), the operations em-
phasis is on establishing capacity to meet demand. However, companies are be-
ginning to turn to contract manufacturing and to simplify their manufacturing
supply chains. Bargman notes, “Given the magnitude of the opportunity, where
inventory days of supply are over 120 days, a signiﬁcant change in inventory
practices will certainly provide a competitive advantage to early adopters.”
• Chemicals. Traditionally, the chemical industry has enjoyed relatively
low supply chain complexity. However, as many ﬁrms drive to become spe-
cialty chemical companies, their perspective on inventory management is
also changing. Specialty chemical companies mean more complex supply
chains and less opportunity for cost reduction in technically difﬁcult pro-
duction processes. To control costs, then, they have to focus on inventory
management performance.

Internet-based, or electronic, supply chain management (eSCM) solutions
can link many steps in the supply chain over a central hub cheaply and efﬁ-
ciently. The questions that remain, though, are how important each of the
various linkages is and what that means for logistics managers. For example,
how important is it to create tighter and more transparent cost controls? Or
for sellers to check customs duties, shipping charges, and taxes? Or for buy-
ers to view catalogs with real-time prices?
To get some answers to these questions, Zona Research, Inc., of Red-
wood Shores, California, recently asked managers to rank the importance of
the beneﬁts of virtual logistics to their organizations.

eSCM as Control Method
Overall, 58% of logistics managers felt that tighter and more transparent cost
controls were important or extremely important as part of their eSCM so-
lution; 25% were neutral; and 17% of users felt it would be of little or no im-
portance (see Figure III-1.13). The survey results indicate that many com-
panies expect eSCM solutions to provide cost control beneﬁts to their
business and that the market for eSCM solutions that are able to fulﬁll com-
pany expectations will continue to grow.
As a result of eSCM, companies will become more sensitive to ﬂuctuations
in prices and other costs and will be able to respond much more effectively. The
eSCM will help them receive alerts when upstream suppliers raise prices and
have the ability to shift to other suppliers quickly through online exchanges.
In addition, organizations were asked to rate the importance of reduced
costs through better pricing and purchasing in their sSCM system. Nearly
two-thirds of survey respondents rated these activities as somewhat or ex-
tremely important (see Figure III-1.14).
This shows that capturing better prices when buying supplies through
eSCM systems is a top beneﬁt because of the opportunities for comparative
pricing that these solutions offer.
It also has to do with the fact that greater numbers of suppliers can be
accessed in less time through such systems. Online suppliers can pass along
volume or loyalty discounts through the dynamic pricing regimes that are
frequently available on virtual supply chain systems.

Countering Economies of Scale
Achieving economies of scale can increase inventory costs and even contra-
dict JIT concepts. An eSCM offers several cost-saving features (such as dy-
namic pricing and requests for bids) and eliminates lengthy procurement
procedures.
Zona asked managers to rate the importance of large economies of scale
in an eSCM. Nearly 3 out of 10 said it was extremely important (see Figure
III-1.15). The results indicate that companies with large raw material needs,

such as heavy manufacturers, tend to beneﬁt from economies of scale,
whereas ﬁrms with minimal procurement needs do not beneﬁt signiﬁcantly.
Impact on Workflow
When asked to rate the importance of automatically triggered workﬂow op-
erations in the eSCM, more than 4 in 10 respondents rate such activity as
somewhat or extremely important (see Figure III-1.16). Less than one in ﬁve
felt that such activity was not at all important, and more than one quarter
were indifferent on the issue.
The research shows that only midsize ﬁrms, with 501 to 1,000 workers
or very large enterprises with more than 2,500 employees rate automatic
workﬂows as important. Job-wide, middle-level managers were among the
groups to rate such workﬂows as important, indicating that they know how
much an eSCM can make workﬂows more efﬁcient.
In terms of annual sales, ﬁrms ranked such workﬂows about equally in
terms of importance except for those with $10 million to $99.9 million or
over $1 billion in annual sales, which rated them important far more often
than unimportant.
Reduces Warehouse Inventory
While there are many beneﬁts to eSCM solutions and the cost control they
offer, respondents do not believe that these solutions reduce the need to
warehouse parts and ﬁnished goods (see Figure III-1.17). This is surprising
768
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T
Figure III-1.16
Importance of Automatically Triggered Workﬂow Operations

given that eSCM solutions can indeed help ﬁrms approach build-to-order
production strategies that can lead to savings in warehousing costs. 
With build-to-order systems made possible by eSCM, ﬁrms can be freed
from having to warehouse, from having to guess about how much to sell,
and from having to take a potential loss on goods that are not sold and then
discounted later in secondary markets.
Reduced Order Fulfillment Cycles
Another potential beneﬁt of eSCM is in reducing order fulﬁllment cycles,
yet less than half of the managers believe it is either somewhat or extremely
important when making a decision to purchase an electronic solution (see
Figure III-1.18). This could be because the most noticeable speed increases
are likely realized in the shift to EDI solutions. A higher response was gen-
erated for the increased beneﬁts of customer service, which is a more cru-
cial motivator for purchasing an eSCM.
Optimizes Cross-Border Pricing
When asked to rate the relative importance of using their eSCM system to
help optimize their ﬁrm’s cross-border pricing, half felt it was of little im-
portance, and only one in ﬁve said it was very important (see Figure III-
1.19).
This points to the notion that a sizable number of ﬁrms are not yet con-

cerned about pricing issues in various parts of the world either because they
sell primarily to domestic markets or because pricing issues are not impacted
by their supply chain management efforts. Even so, eSCM is a critical tool
in facilitating cross-border pricing, concludes Zona Research.
Increased Customer Satisfaction
Logistics bottlenecks and botched deliveries can very quickly remove the
shine from any organization’s reputation. Therefore Zona asked logistics
managers to rate the importance of increased customer satisfaction as a po-
tential beneﬁt from their eSCM system.

More than four out of ﬁve say that customer satisfaction is either im-
portant or extremely important, while fewer than 1 in 10 were neutral on
the subject (see Figure III-1.20). In analyzing the responses, companies with
more than 2,500 employees and those with fewer than 250 were among the

Many initiatives, such as vendor-managed inventory, quick response, and ef-
ﬁcient consumer response have contributed to improving supply chain per-
formance. However, these initiatives have not fostered true integration
among supply chain partners. That is where CPFR enters the mix. Collab-
orative planning, forecasting, and replenishment is being embraced by a
myriad of retailers and manufacturers hoping to streamline their supply
chains. How can you incorporate CPFR into your own logistics operations?
By learning exactly what it is and how others are using it, and following the
steps to implement similar procedures. 
The Fundamentals of CPFR
Simply put, CPFR works to ensure that retailers and manufacturers reduce
out-of-stock items and carry less stock while doing it. According to a 1996
Insights from the Pros
771
Figure III-1.20
Importance of Increased Customer Satisfaction

study by the Coca-Cola Retail Council, for every 100 customers going into
a store to buy a speciﬁc product, 8 will not ﬁnd the item because it is out of
stock. In other words, retail product stockouts occur at an average rate of
8.2% (see Table III-1.9). CPFR is designed to eliminate this problem. 
At the core of the CPFR program is the intention that customers always
ﬁnd what they want in stock, says Joseph Fabrizio, senior vice president and
director of stores at Boscov’s (610-370-3766). “CPFR is an agreement be-
tween trading partners to develop a market-speciﬁc plan based on sound
category management principles,” Fabrizio says. Although trading partners
are typically considered only the manufacturers and retailers, the term now
extends to all supply chain partners. “It now encompasses everyone who
touches the merchandise,” Fabrizio explains. This includes the transporta-
tion provider, warehouse, and supplier. “Everyone needs to be involved and
accountable.” According to the Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Stan-
dards (VICS) association (www.cpfr.org), for the CPFR model to work, the
partners must agree to take ownership in the process and the plan. 
Follow the Leaders
How are supply chain manufacturers working to make CPFR principals a
reality? They are creating a plan that addresses what will be sold, how it will
be merchandised and promoted, in what marketplace it will be sold, and in
what time frame. According to VICS, the plan is executed via each partners’
existing systems and is accessible via communication tools such as EDI.
Therefore, CPFR does rely on the Internet and EDI, but it works to create
further integration between supply chain partners. 
Once the plan is established, the supply chain partners use CPFR prin-

ciples to create forecasts. These forecasts, according to VICS, can be auto-
matically converted into shipping plans in an effort to avoid traditional—and
often time-consuming—order processing systems.
“True CPFR in my opinion means forecasting for every SKU,” Fabrizio
says. For example, Wal-Mart has joined with Procter & Gamble to do just
that. According to Fabrizio, the partners are projecting down to the SKU
level to ensure that they experience almost no out-of-stock items. In fact,
Procter & Gamble executives actually work on-site with Wal-Mart to de-
termine future product needs. 
Boscov’s, a billion-dollar retailer located in the Northeast, realizes the
beneﬁts of CPFR and has adopted some of its principles. According to Fab-
rizio, the company is not large enough to implement CPFR fully into its op-
erations. However, EDI and vendor agreements still play a major part in lo-
gistics processes at Boscov’s. In addition, the retailer has developed programs
that ensure replenishment as well as proﬁtability. “We work with vendors to
ensure success,” Fabrizio says. 
If the number of companies that have embraced CPFR is any indication
of its success, CPFR has been well received and should continue to be the
topic of much industry buzz. Like Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble, other
companies such as Kmart, Sara Lee Corporation, Lucent Technologies, and
Kimberly Clark have adopted CPFR principles. However, says Fabrizio, the
results of many of these CPFR practices are still being determined. It’s a fairly
new model, he says. “There’s an awful lot yet that has to be determined.”
Tips for CPFR Success
The CPFR Web site (www.cpfr.org) is an excellent tool to use when learn-
ing about CPFR, Fabrizio says. He also recommends getting a copy of
VICS’ CPFR guidelines. According to VICS, the guidelines are designed to
serve as a road map for suppliers, distributors, and third-party logistics pro-
viders. The manual covers CPFR principles, technological support tools be-
hind CPFR, and change management issues associated with CPFR imple-
mentation. The manual can be ordered via the CPFR Web site. 
When implementing CPFR, it is important to have cooperation from
your supply chain partners as well as your own internal employees. “It takes
100% commitment to make CPFR part of your processes,” Fabrizio says.
“The buyers, executives, distribution centers, and stores all have to partici-
pate.” Of course, you also must have technological tools in place when im-
plementing CPFR into your logistics processes. In addition to EDI and
Insights from the Pros
773

Internet capabilities that link retailers and manufacturers together, you should
have point-of-sale data, forecasting, and distribution center software on hand. 
Although software and hardware are necessary for CPFR success, get-
ting the technology in place is the easy part. “What isn’t easy is the company
culture,” Fabrizio notes. Again, you have to have buy-in from all supply
chain partners, keeping in mind all the while that CPFR is an entirely new
way of doing things. “It’s sharing ideas with vendors,” Fabrizio adds.
“Rather than saying, ‘you will do this,’ it’s saying ‘how will we do this?’”
Last but not least, you should consider networking with VICS members
and maybe even become a member yourself. By benchmarking with some
of the largest retailers in the country—such as Wal-Mart and Kmart—you
can learn how to incorporate CPFR successfully into your own processes. 
If you choose to embrace CPFR, look out. The beneﬁts it may provide
will ﬂoor you. For example, you will likely experience improved commu-
nication among supply chain partners and a more efﬁcient supply chain.
Your customers will ﬁnd the products they want in stock, while you and
your suppliers use forecasts to reduce your inventories. As a result, Fabrizio
says, everyone involved—manufacturers, retailers, and customers—will ex-
perience lower prices. In addition, because you will have fewer out-of-stock
items, you will likely experience increased sales.

Even though logistics managers are inundated with information about
supply chain technology, not everyone knows how to take full advantage of
the power these tools afford. As a result, more upfront detailed planning can
literally put the power of the supply chain in your pocket. That is the mes-
sage that Greg Girard, an analyst with AMR Research of Boston (617-574-
5217), and Greg Schlegel, supply chain senior consultant with IBM in Flan-
ders, New Jersey, relayed to attendees at a recent Council of Logistics
Management annual meeting.
A Focus on Collaboration
Both Girard and Schlegel agree that one of the most important beneﬁts that
supply chain technology affords today’s logistics professional is the ability to
collaborate with trading partners, and thus, obtain a truly optimal pipeline.
774
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

“Collaboration ensures that the best solutions for all are implemented,” says
Girard. “It achieves this by making sure that every partner is exposed to the
right information.”
Logisticians may ﬁnd discomfort in sharing information, continues Gi-
rard. However, he says, there is no better way to make the most optimal de-
cisions for your supply chain. “If your own house isn’t in order, there is no
way you can achieve true collaboration,” says Schlegel. “You are in the busi-
ness of building a supply chain community and you have to do it well.”
Becoming a Change Agent
While it still may be your CEO, CFO, CIO, or vice president of supply
chain who makes the ﬁnal call about what technology to purchase, it is up
to you as a logistics manager to brief senior management about supply chain
management, says Schlegel.
One way to do this is by creating a supply chain council within your
ﬁrm. Gather senior management, representatives from your logistics depart-
ment, and other people who will be impacted by the purchase of new tech-
nology and make sure that everyone understands the value that the technol-
ogy can bring to the organization. “Logistics managers play a bigger role
than ever before in fostering change within their ﬁrms,” says Schlegel.
He points out that if you do not have the capability to foster such com-
munication on your own, look to consultants for outside help. 
Pushing Back the Sales Cycle
Logistics managers also play a pivotal role in selling senior management on
the idea of purchasing supply chain technology. “Logistics managers can help
by pushing back the sales cycle to ensure that their business requirements are
understood,” says Girard. “It is up to them to make sure the organization
doesn’t get snowed over by the technology if it doesn’t ﬁt the business.”
Bear in mind, too, that your input should and will have an impact on
how your organization grows, says Schlegel. Your ultimate objectives should
include reduced cycle times, reduced cost of capital, and increased revenue.
Part of the sales cycle involves educating supply chain technology vendors as
well. This is critical, because when it comes right down to it, “vendors don’t
really understand what you do,” says Girard.
Schlegel says to make sure that the vendors you are considering can
address three primary issues: ﬂexibility, integration, and speed. “As far as
Insights from the Pros
7 7 5
TEAMFLY
Team-Fly® 

flexibility is concerned, you want a system that will offer you the information
you need in various forms and in some type of graphical schematic,” says
Schlegel.
On the subject of integration, make sure that the solution can be applied
to handle everything from order entry to production planning. And make
sure that it offers a bidirectional information ﬂow.
Finally, speed. “This is the life of any good supply chain,” says Schlegel.
“Logistics managers don’t have time to sit around and wait for information.
They want it online and in real time.”
Five Elements for Your Tool Kit
As a logistics practitioner for over 20 years, Schlegel says that his approach to
purchasing supply chain technology is addressed at a personal, rather than
technical, level. These are the ﬁve elements he keeps in his supply chain tool
kit to ensure that any purchase he makes is a successful one.
1. Stay current with emerging tools and technology. The best ways to
do this, he says, are to earn industry certiﬁcations and stay educated.
2. Embrace new technology protocols. “The hardware and software on
the market today only keeps getting more sophisticated,” he says. “It’s not
going away, so learn how to use it.”
3. Pursue people, communication, and team-building skills. Schlegel
says, “Logistics folks have grown up in a functional silo, but today they must
be part of a team, either as a member or a driver. You can no longer be one-
dimensional in a multitask environment.”
4. Enhance the project by making sure management understands what
the business requirements are and the skills required to carry out a success-
ful implementation.
5. Get involved. “As a logistics manager in today’s business culture, you
can’t stand on the sidelines,” says Schlegel. “If you do, your needs will not be
addressed.”

Most ﬁrms will have to transform their traditional supply chains to set up
CDL channels in the next three to ﬁve years just to remain competitive.
Companies such as Amazon.com say you have no choice. While CDL will
776
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

soon be indispensable, only 10% of logistics players currently have the right
skills to do it effectively. If you ﬁnd yourself in this group, advice from lead-
ing practitioners is sure to help you create a CDL supply chain, either as a
core or lateral channel.
CDL Poses Significant Challenges
In the grocery industry alone, CDL is expected to become an $85 billion in-
dustry by 2008, estimates Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting). Two
leaders in this area are Peapod and Procter & Gamble. At a Logicon Confer-
ence, Todd Stark, associate director of logistics and supply chain development
and global consumer direct for Procter & Gamble, explained that, typically,
in a consumer direct process, the consumer enters her order via computer,
fax, phone, or other order entry device. The consumer direct provider pro-
cesses and fulﬁlls the order from a retail store or dedicated distribution cen-
ter. The product is then delivered to the consumer, either at home or work.
Thus, CDL poses some signiﬁcant challenges that conventional supply
chains do not:
• Handling out of stocks and substitutes. In a typical supply chain there are
ways to handle the customer when product will be delayed or out of stock,
but that is not the case in CDL. “These are consumers who are making din-
ner that night and won’t accept substitutes,” Stark says. “If we are not meet-
ing or exceeding their expectations, it will hurt our business.”
The objective is to anticipate demand and receive daily deliveries from
suppliers, says John A. Caltagirone, chief logistics and operations ofﬁcer for
Peapod. “The data we collect on purchases is excellent, so suppliers know
what was shipped and what to automatically replenish.” However, he does
admit that if a product is out of stock (e.g., a brand of ketchup), consumers
will generally accept a substitute.
• Delivering perishable items. In the grocery business, up to 55% of the
order is perishable, so temperature control is critical. Stark says that while
there is nothing unique about multi- or single-temperature supply chain de-
liveries or making deliveries to a consumer’s home, the combination of the
two is unique. “We have to pack and ship product in individualized, multi-
temperature orders in a 12- to 18-foot vehicle. The logistical challenge is
that the product has to be delivered as fresh as possible so that when it reaches
the consumer, he is 100% conﬁdent in the quality.”
Another delivery challenge is meeting consumers’ time windows. At
Peapod, for instance, customers expect to receive their goods within two
Insights from the Pros
777

hours. Caltagirone explains that orders are picked, packed, and staged by
routes to ensure that drivers meet those time windows.
• Making the most efﬁcient transportation decisions. This is where simulation
models can be helpful, Stark and Caltagirone agree. What-if scenarios can de-
termine how many dock doors are needed to make delivery schedules more
ﬂexible and how many deliveries to make in a particular neighborhood.
• Meeting customer expectations. Consumers demand price and billing ac-
curacy, value-added features such as coupons and promotions, very few
mispicks, and efﬁcient product assortment.
• Improving logistics processes. The experts agree that personnel must be
able to pick backroom items three times faster than in traditional supply
chain fulﬁllment processes and keep out-of-stocks under 3%. Stark says that
these elements are challenging because there is currently no template for
success, and logistics models vary by region.
Fulfillment Methods
According to Stark, there are three types of fulﬁllment methods for CDL
(see Figure III-1.21):
778

Figure III-1.21
Operational Model Considerations
Source: Procter & Gamble.

• Store pick: fulﬁllment from an existing retail outlet
• Dedicated distribution center: fulﬁllment from a local distribution
center
• Pick-up facility: fulﬁllment from a kiosk, mobile van, cross dock, or
existing store
“The most reliable and cost-efﬁcient is the dedicated DC,” says Stark.
Consider that the store pick method is not designed for fast, efﬁcient, and
ﬂexible order picking, but to be attractive for customers shopping in the
stores. “Often, items will be out of stock up to 15% of the time in the store,
so you wind up picking from out-of-stock shelves,” he says. And in the case
of the pickup point, if customers are picking up groceries that have already
been selected for them, then they are really not saving a trip to the market.
Role of Logistics Manager
Stark and Caltagirone agree that the role of the logistics manager in a CDL
supply chain is critical but different from that in a conventional supply chain.
To meet performance measures, the manager must make sure that staff is well
trained to pick and pack. It is up to the logistics manager to make sure trans-
portation routes are as efﬁcient as possible.
“Logisticians are talented, but they have been focused on getting prod-
uct into distribution centers and out to retail stores,” says Stark. “The focus
in this business is getting the product to the consumer.”
One way to adjust the focus is by tightening relationships with suppli-
ers. Caltagirone says this relationship is necessary not only from a business
perspective, but from a systems perspective as well. “Our systems are tied to-
gether so that when a product goes off our shelf, they know what to replen-
ish,” he says.
Cost of CDL
Stark and Caltagirone agree that while CDL reduces the cost of picking and
packing, it increases transportation costs. Currently, delivery costs are from
$3.00 to $5.00 per order, and they are expected to jump to between $7.50
and $9.00 by 2008, says Stark.
Procter & Gamble relies on its own ﬂeet and 3PL transportation pro-
viders to make deliveries. Stark says that special vehicles had to be made to
Insights from the Pros
779

handle ambient and refrigerated temperatures for the direct-home deliver-
ies. “We want to be able to control that last mile that the product takes un-
til it reaches the consumer,” he says.
“The costs of CDL are higher than other supply chain models because
we are trying to bend over backwards for the consumer,” says Calta-
girone.

Senior management indifference, out-of-code product, inefﬁcient handling
practices, excessive seasonal product returns, and pallet overhang are some
of the leading causes of unsalable items in the supply chain. But as all logis-
tics managers know, the problems, while easy to identify, are often tricky to
solve. To get some expert advice on the best ways to handle unsalables, we
talked with four logistics leaders at a recent Logicon conference.
Seven Ways to Handle Unsalables
1. Establish a point of contact.
The pros agree that putting someone in
charge of unsalables is the only way to control the problem. Motts just hired
its ﬁrst dedicated source to handle unsalables about one year ago. 
Prior to that, it was a sales function “because it was thought that the sales
folks were the closest to the customer and unsalables were considered a cus-
tomer problem,” explains Ernest Argenio, product recovery manager for
Motts. “Then it was considered a packaging problem, then a ﬁnance prob-
lem. Eventually senior management saw how expensive a problem this
was—costs doubled over two years—so they took action and hired me. It is
a worthwhile investment to have someone full-time dedicated to unsalables.
No one can really understand it otherwise, and you won’t be able to take a
bite out of the escalating costs.”
Gerber Products has a one-man team that reports to the ﬁnance depart-
ment. Michael Mills, national remarketing and product recovery manager at
Gerber, looks for ways to reduce damage internally before the product is
passed along to the customer. “I also work with the customer to identify key
drivers of unsalables for our 3,000 SKUs,” he says.
Quaker Oats has also dedicated resources. It hired a Damage Prevention
Analyst who works with the distribution centers to measure how product is
780
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

being handled. The company also established a whole team, which reports
to the vice president of logistics, to focus on ways to avoid having product
returned, controlling it internally and externally, explains James Hicks, man-
ager of trade damage/unsalables at Quaker Oats.
2. Set up unsalables policies.
Argenio drafted an unsalables policy in the sec-
ond quarter, outlining how Motts products should be handled. “I just tell
our customers that unsalables hurt us both and that we need to reduce the
occurrence,” he says. “Our customers pretty much accepted the policy with-
out a problem.”
Hicks says that Quaker Oats has set up standard operating procedures
(SOPs) with its distribution centers so that they know what constitutes a
shippable product, how to load the product, and how to ship the product.
“We even educate our folks operating the forklifts so they know how to han-
dle the product in storage,” he says.
Gerber’s standard operating procedures include returning goods back to
its DCs if certain criteria are met. If the damage is a Gerber error, it pays the
freight cost. If it is a customer error, they pay the freight cost. 
Other Gerber SOPs include a markdown at the store level to generate
sell through, utilize closeout stores to move certain items, capture dollars by
brand and business unit for all unsalable expense, and establish a new item
introduction budget for new items replacing discontinued items.
3. Consider packaging alternatives.
Hicks says that Quaker Oats is convert-
ing to shipping product on pallets rather than slipsheets because of their
strength. He says that Quaker Oats actually repackaged a brand of product
last year, which reduced unsalables for that year. Hicks warns, however, that
“it can take up to 15 months to see the impact of a packaging change.”
Gerber conducts Package Condition Audits, which require physically
viewing the package to determine why it was returned and to determine
which packages are driving unsalables.
4. Evaluate customers’ equipment.
One of the ways that Quaker Oats con-
trols the reduction of unsalables externally is by evaluating the type of equip-
ment its customers use to pick up the product. “If we don’t like the equip-
ment they use to pick up our product, we reject it,” says Hicks.
In addition, he says, Quaker Oats watches how the customer unloads
the product to make sure that damaged goods do not process through to the
store level.

5. Invest in technology.
The Logicon panel told attendees that it relies on
digital cameras located at their DCs to photograph how product is handled,
how it is loaded, and what could be done differently to ensure that product
is undamaged upon receipt.
“Each DC has a returnable budget,” says Hicks. “The cameras are help-
ing to reduce inefﬁciencies and keep our DCs close to budget. Unsalables is
a quick, unconventional way to reduce costs and see a drop on the bottom
line.”
6. Consider an internal reclamation center.
While many companies opt to
send their damaged product to reclamation centers, Sprint PCS, a cellular
phone distributor, has hired a third party to work on site at an in-house
reclamation center.
“This was a great solution for us,” explains Eric Salisbury, corporate di-
rector of logistics for Sprint PCS. “The center turns product back into a sell-
able state in less than one week.” Telephone handsets that are defective are
returned to the manufacturer.
7. Use a scorecard.
Mills says that Gerber has set up benchmarks to see
how it is doing with unsalables. The scorecard measures the percentage of
orders complete, percentage of orders delivered complete, damaged prod-
uct received at destination, quantity of backorders, and sales dollar back-
ordered. Gerber now boasts a rate of 1.3% of sales compared to 2% two
years earlier.
Since coming on board at Motts, Argenio has reduced unsalables to 1%
of sales from 1.2% a year earlier. He says the industry average is 1.08%. “We
knew we could be better than the industry average.”

Incorporating promotional and seasonal activity into the forecasting process
requires access to inventory information and a true sense of collaboration
among trading partners. Two consumer goods giants, Nike and Warner-
Lambert, have developed such forecasting systems and, as a result, have cre-
ated logistics replenishment programs that are making their promotions and
their supply chains a success.
782

Identifying Gaps in Promotion Management
Warner-Lambert distributes a variety of products, from seasonal items dur-
ing cold and ﬂu season to competitive consumer products such as mouth-
wash and front-end impulse buys such as breath mints. “Our product nu-
ances make it tough to forecast,” says Andrew Helveston, replenishment
manager, corporate business teams, for Warner-Lambert. “We realized that
we weren’t capturing promotions correctly. We either had too many orders
or too few going to the retailer. As a result, the promotion was not lining up
with the customer’s needs.”
In an effort to correct this, Helveston says, Warner-Lambert examined
its three-step approach to promotion management to identify gaps.
1. Planning. This occurs from six months to one year prior to the event.
At this time, the type, price, and time of the promotion are determined. One
mistake the company made here was continually pumping inventory into
the store, without considering the retailer’s amount to date.
2. Execution. This takes place six to eight weeks prior to the promotion.
The vendor receives orders, and the customer receives product. Here,
Warner-Lambert just assumed product was going to arrive at the site.
3. Evaluation. Usually occurring one to four weeks after the promotion,
Warner-Lambert considers whether the event was proﬁtable. Was the in-
cremental gain in sales worth the cost of the promotion? It was up to sales
to make these evaluations, but they were not actually held accountable for
seeing the promotion through to the end.
“Basically, these gaps led to the customer being left with a promotion
and handling it on their own,” Helveston told attendees at a recent Logicon
conference. “It was like a ticking bomb and just waiting for it to go off.”
Planning Is a Collaborative Process
After identifying its weak spots, Warner-Lambert set out to make correc-
tions. In the planning process, it now ensures that the event is comprehen-
sive and details about quantity, timing, and execution are shared with every-
one. Software programs are in place to ensure that stores are not carrying a
lot of inventory when the promotion is over.
In addition, a collaborative forecast is generated and shared with manu-
Insights from the Pros
783

facturing and production to make sure that lead-time requirements are met.
Finally, there is visibility of quantities/timing to the logistics folks to make
certain that shipments are on time.
CPFR is used to manage collaboration with retailers regarding quanti-
ties. This provides visibility to timing of the promotion and expected quan-
tities within the customers’ buying system, explains Helveston.
Monitoring the Execution
Gaps identiﬁed in the execution of the promotion resulted in closer mon-
itoring through to the store shelf. This begins with the order receipt at
Warner-Lambert, ensuring that the inventory is available. The process con-
tinues with the order shipment to the customer, tracking timely delivery and
receipt veriﬁcation. “Logistics analysts make sure every purchase order
makes it to the customer’s distribution center,” he says.
The monitoring ends with the product receipt at the store. An inven-
tory planner reviews the store level inventory. Sales representatives evaluate
the inventory levels after the event, and if inventory is left over, they are to
ﬁnd out why, Helveston explains. “Each step is important,” he continues.
“Planning must be communicated, execution must be monitored, and the
evaluation should be incorporated into future promotions for proﬁtability.”
Evaluating the Profits
Helveston says that evaluation is critical in understanding the success and
proﬁtability of the promotion. Warner-Lambert now considers the cost to
execute the promotion, such as display costs, advertising costs, and mark-
down costs. In addition, there is a concentration on inventory sell-through
(returns and obsolescence).
“Be sure to reduce inventory, or the retailer will try to return it,” says
Helveston.
Additional Replenishment Strategies
Warner-Lambert has set up various replenishment programs to ensure that
it delivers the right amount of product exactly when it is needed at the re-
tail site. First, it has set up vendor managed replenishment (VMR) with sev-
eral of its larger grocery and retail chain clients. Warner-Lambert also relies
on corporate business teams, made up of representatives in replenishment,
784
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

logistics, ﬁnance, and sales. Each of these cross-functional groups is assigned
to service one customer.
When It Has to Be There
Like Warner-Lambert, Nike manufactures and distributes a variety of prod-
ucts, making forecasting a challenge, explains Mary Eck, director of strate-
gic distribution logistics for Nike.
“Sporting apparel, equipment, and footwear have to absolutely be there
for a sporting event, but each product has different lead times and different
processes,” explained Eck at the Logicon conference. “We have to coordi-
nate things just right to get each product to the consumer at the same time.”
She says Nike used to rely on airfreight to do this, but the costs became
too astronomical to have it be the only solution for timely delivery. “Our
forecasts for production were off or our lead times were running late, which
forced us to use air,” she says. “We knew we had to move beyond this.”
Forecasting Tools at Nike
Nike moved beyond this by instituting various forecasting tools:
1. Forecasting through trend analysis. Eck says that forecasting has gotten
easier for Nike because the company now focuses on sporting trends to de-
termine what products are most popular and where they will be used. For
instance, she says, if a certain sport is more popular at a certain time of year
or if consumers are dressing in sporting attire, such as golf clothes, Nike can
use these trends to establish more reliable forecasts. “This helps us determine
what products will be popular at different times of the year,” she says.
2. Country-speciﬁc demand plans. Each country in which Nike is located
does its own demand and inventory plans. “This allows us to react to capac-
ity constraints in individual countries,” explains Eck. “We can get closer to
the market and make products for that country. It allows us to react more
quickly to country-speciﬁc trends.”
3. Use of global systems. Nike relies on ERP software from SAP, will soon
implement a supply chain planning tool from i2 Technologies of Dallas (the
company currently uses a system from Manugistics), and expects to install
an optimization software solution in the near future. Eck says that these
solutions will help Nike gather information from manufacturers, vendors,
Insights from the Pros

logistics service providers, carriers, and the consumer with regard to pro-
duction capacities, forecast projections, and historical product data.
“The information helps us see products across a range of activities,” she
says. “We can see how successful a product is, decide if we should cancel it,
or redirect it to a different region or country. We can even see the accuracy
of our projections, comparing our real-time accomplishment with our real-
istic goals.”
Nike used to rely on a 12-year-old legacy system, which, according to
Eck, had a bunch of bandages on it. “It couldn’t work for all the countries,
regions, and groups of products,” she says. At one time, she says, Nike had
31 order management systems.
The Successful Results
Eck says that these three tools ensure that only the required amounts of stock
are held in inventory, and still enable the company to plan for increased de-
mand. In addition, Nike says it is able to hit its service levels and still reduce
closeouts and cancellations. Finally, it is increasing the accuracy of its de-
mand plan to be more accurate and have less of a negative impact on the
supply chain.
“At Nike, we like to create demand by making great products and tak-
ing risks, but you have to be prepared for the unexpected.”

A recent study (The North American Survey of Trends in Supply Chain Man-
agement; Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group; Toronto) finds two of
three respondents saying that they plan to share information with cus-
tomers and suppliers for collaborating on forecasting and replenishment:
They will synchronize supply chain operations, particularly the strategic,
tactical, and operational planning activities between and among trading
partners.
Previously, we described the concept as a “higher level of vendor man-
aged inventory, or collaborative inventory management.” The key to this
customer partnering agreement is “joint responsibility of the manufacturer
and the customer to establish and develop a collaborative forecast.”
786
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

Collaboration, as applied in supply chain management practice.
In a short time,
however, the concept has broadened. For example, in a recent issue of The
Report on Supply Chain Management, analyst Larry Lapide of AMR Research,
Inc., afﬁrms, “In a collaborative relationship, information is not just ex-
changed and transmitted, but it is also jointly developed by the buyer and
seller.”
Generally, this information deals with future product plans and needs.
Historically, he continues, “this type of information was not jointly devel-
oped on an electronic basis. It was rather developed in person or by fax and
phone.”
Much like an information sharing relationship, information ancillary to
the actual purchase is shared in a collaborative environment. However, un-
like an information sharing relationship, information is not shared on a FYI-
basis, since either trading partner may change it until both parties agree, he
explains.
Information sharing is but a small step toward establishing a collaborative relationship.
We have published many articles citing examples of partners trading infor-
mation. However, Lapide and others insist that these information sharing re-
lationships differ from collaborative ones. Often the recipient is using the
data as-is and is not providing feedback. “While this information is helpful
in improving supply chain performance,” he argues, “it does little to reduce
the uncertainty faced by trading partners in determining future demand.”
According to Lapide, “Since the information shared from one partner
to another is on an FYI basis only, there is no opportunity for the other part-
ner to provide his or her own insight and knowledge of consumer needs. In
addition, there is little opportunity to work together on matching supply
with anticipated demand,” he continues.
In addition, prominent among the information shared with supply chain
partners are data about inventories, including raw materials, WIP, and ﬁn-
ished goods. Others include sharing production schedules, sales forecasts,
and promotional calendars.
In a collaborative effort, as described by Lapide, “trading partners work
together to better understand future demand and to put plans into place to
satisfy it proﬁtably.” As an example, in working collaboratively on consumer
requirements, trading partners might work to decide jointly how many and
when products will be produced to meet expected consumer demand.
Among the types of planning that trading partners can conduct collabora-
tively are

The question is not “if” collaboration, but rather “when.”
According to the best
available information, no companies have yet begun the collaborative pro-
cess on a mass, routine basis. However, there are industry efforts to establish
standards, software vendors developing technology, and reports of some pi-
lot processes. Among them are Heineken USA with its distributors, and
Nabisco with Wegmans.
In the Heineken application, the company collaborates with its distrib-
utors on forecasts via the Internet. The system enables the distributors to
view a Heineken-generated demand forecast. A distributor can reﬁne or ap-
prove the forecast. At completion, the planning module creates a recom-
mended replenishment order.
In the Nabisco/Wegmans pilot, both companies will share common de-
mand and supply forecasts for the Planters product line. Wegmans will fore-
cast consumer demand in its 54 stores, and Nabisco will manufacture to
meet that demand.
Among the industry group initiatives, the following are examples:
• The Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Standards Committee
(VICS), through its CPFR Committee, has published a draft set of volun-
tary business process guidelines by which retailers and their suppliers can
electronically collaborate.
• Value Chain Initiative was started by Microsoft to develop common
frameworks for business-to-business electronic commerce on a supply
chain.
• Automotive Network Exchange, from the Auto Industry Action
Group, is developing an Internet-based extranet to allow automobile mak-
ers and component/subassembly suppliers to exchange information elec-
tronically.

• Demand Activated Manufacturing Architecture, part of the Ameri-
can Textile Partnership, examines supply chain collaboration processes in-
tending to help create a computer-based information highway for soft
goods. It’s developed the supply chain integration program that a planner
can use to perform a supply and demand analysis within a total supply chain
scenario.
Collaborative relationships and their supply chains.
Be warned: one model does
not ﬁt all. Relationships among trading partners will differ, depending on the
companies involved. However, the most important collaboration opportu-
nity areas, cited by Lapide, will result in three major types:
• Manufacturer/suppliers will focus on synchronized production. This will be
realized by electronically sharing schedules with suppliers, allowing them to
provide feedback and make changes based on whether material needs can be
met. This type of collaboration also includes visibility into the raw material,
WIP, and ﬁnished goods inventories of all suppliers to help ensure synchro-
nized, realistic production schedules.
• Manufacturer/customers will focus on demand planning. The major collab-
oration opportunity areas for manufacturers and their customers are in de-
mand planning and inventory replenishment. Here, both parties will need
to cooperate electronically to share and modify each other’s demand plans
and forecasts. When collaboratively developed, a replenishment plan is de-
signed to ensure that adequate product is available to meet demand. This will
require partners to share and modify each other’s ﬁnished goods inventory
replenishment plans electronically, maintains Lapide.
• Companies/third-party providers focus on logistics planning. Here, the em-
phasis will be on joint logistics planning. For example, collaboration be-
tween a company and third parties providing DC services will focus on the
productive use of facilities, labor, and equipment. This will likely involve
electronic sharing of DC inventory replenishment plans with analysis to en-
sure that planned receipts do not overload the receiving function. Also, plans
may be shared to ensure that each DC has enough space to store planned in-
ventories.

Planning and controlling inventory in the global supply chain are essential.
What is needed is a well-designed, integrated business process supported by
an information system that will allow planning how a shipment should move
through the supply chain, how long it will take, and how much it should cost
under normal circumstances. “This will be used not only as a basis for sched-
uling and control of the actual shipment, but to determine the supply chain
cost that must be incorporated into the total product cost to ensure sufﬁcient
margin,” reports Steven M. Purdy, vice president of Herbert W. Davis and
Company (Fort Lee, N.J.; 201-944-5580).
The process and system must incorporate a method of deﬁning the
supply chain, each shipping lane, each transfer point, the transit times, and
associated standard costs in multiple currencies. The system also should be
capable of generating and processing the documents necessary to move the
materials, he explains.
There must be an ability to record actual performance and costs against them.
The
system design and development side of this is not especially difﬁcult, he as-
sures. Also, the technology and infrastructure of gathering far-ﬂung data are
also not that difﬁcult. “The Internet has great potential for moving the
needed data from remote locations to your supply chain management sys-
tem, and there are commercial services in many parts of the world as well,”
Purdy maintained at a recent APICS Annual Conference.
Generally, though, the actual data recording side is difﬁcult.
“At a minimum, for
the process to work, the arrival and departure of shipments at a point need
to be known quickly, as well as any costs associated with the transfer,” he ex-
plains. The problem is getting service providers to provide this information
quickly, accurately, and in a form that can be used.
This may mean providing equipment and training, as well as paying ser-
vice charges, if it can be done at all, he explains. Making an investment of
this kind with third parties “reduces the ﬂexibility in obtaining services in
the open market.”
In some cases, it may be impossible to get the needed services, and there
may be gaps in the coverage. In that case, Purdy notes, “it may have to be
accepted that the best that can be done is to assume that if something arrives,
it must have taken the intervening time to get there.” The actual costs will

then have to be spread back over the process by logic once they are known,
much like back-ﬂushing labor and material in a manufacturing control sys-
tem when detail data are not collected at each manufacturing operation.
Detailed inventory tracking to manage shrinkage is even more difﬁcult.
This is not
often done in the supply chain, even within the United States. “It would in-
volve labeling each master carton in a shipment with a bar-coded license
plate, storing the identifying data about the carton in your database, and hav-
ing each individual carton scanned at each transfer point,” he explains.
To start, if there were a third-party manufacturer, he would have to pro-
duce and correctly apply the label and transmit the associated data to the
supply chain system. Again, Purdy points out, it would require investment
at vendor sites, would reduce ﬂexibility in sourcing, and would depend on
the vendor’s doing the job well.
“The ﬂip side of this, and just as difﬁcult or more so, is getting the li-
cense plates read at each transfer point,” he declares. To do the job right,
every carton has to be scanned every time the material is out in the open,
such as being put into or taken out of a container or truck.
“If this is done, and it may mean doing it both when a load is broken
down and when the product is reloaded for further distribution, we will
know exactly what we have, where shrinkage, if any, has occurred,” he ex-
plains. This will allow the following remedial actions to begin immediately:
1. Deal with the customer service issues.
2. Initiate physical or economic recovery.
3. Take preventive measures for future shipments.
“Monitoring shrinkage this well requires a lot of accurate, frequently
gathered, near real-time data that not only may not be available today, but
for which the infrastructure, policies and procedures, and contractual
arrangements with service providers may not exist,” he explains. “This kind
of inventory tracking over long periods and distances is new territory,” he ac-
knowledges.
However, when done as outlined, and knowing the constitution of the inventory and
its location, other beneﬁts accrue.
For instance, Purdy advises that there is the
possibility of deploying dynamically to distribution warehouses, or even al-
locating and shipping directly to customers when the shipment has landed. 
Insights from the Pros

“Being certain of what is actually in stock on the leg of the shipment be-
fore landing will allow stock to be allocated and the inventory to be cross-
docked for shipment into your distribution network, or shipped direct to the
customer, shortening the supply chain and providing more prompt service,”
Purdy highlights. 
Why inventory managers must be thrust into critical supply chain roles.
“The time
value of inventory investment and the cost of shrinkage in transit and at the
multiple points of transfer inherent in long-distance shipping have become
important in determining true margin and proﬁtability,” contends Purdy.
In another view, John W. Scharlacken, principal consultant, supply
chain management group, Price Waterhouse Management Consulting LLP,
shares in the proceedings of the APICS conference, “The holistic supply
chain planning concept replaces the traditional view of the supply chain as
merely a means of piping product to a customer. It provides control of busi-
ness processes quickly reacting to customers’ current product and delivery
needs, collects information about future requirements, and relays it back
through the network to be shared by everyone with responsibility for man-
aging the supply chain.”
What it is going to take.
David Harland, manager of the logistics and order
fulﬁllment team, global business process integration program, the Gillette
Company (Boston), adds, “In common with other multinational compa-
nies, we see the proﬁt in a JIT, high-service, low-inventory approach to ful-
ﬁlling customer requirements.” According to Scharlacken and Harland, the
primary objectives of the global supply chain planning process include
• Establishing a quick response that provides competitive advantage
• Achieving world-class customer service levels
• Achieving world-class inventory turnover objectives
• Maximizing administrative resources
The tradeoff between inventory turnover and total product cost.
Purdy says, “If in-
ventory is being managed as an asset and the cost of the investment in it is
recognized as it should be, a three-month supply chain represents a maxi-
mum possible turn rate of four.” However, the economics of lower offshore
manufacture may justify the added transportation cost, the lower rate of
turnover, and the associated inventory investment, he itemized.
792
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

“The important thing is to understand the total economics of the man-
ufacturing cost versus transportation and carrying cost tradeoff, and manage
it intensively and intelligently,” Purdy challenges. “When the supply chain
is very long, it is essential to know what the total cost of getting product to
the customer will be, or should be,” he asserts. This is probably the most sig-
niﬁcant difference between manufacturing or buying products domestically
and sourcing globally. “Logistics costs are a signiﬁcant controllable element
in purely domestic operations and are being managed more closely than
ever,” he mentions. But even locally, getting the data needed to manage well
from third-party service providers is not easy.
“In offshore operations, it is that much more difﬁcult,” Purdy advises.
“Often, neither the tools nor the data necessary for improved management
are readily available.”

“The state of the U.S. business logistics system is disappointing,” declares
Robert V. Delaney, executive vice president of Cass Information Systems
(St. Louis; 314-506-5820). “Last year, our business logistics costs were equal
to 10.6% of the U.S. GDP [gross domestic product].” The troubling aspect
is that the 10.6% of GDP has plateaued for the past three years.
Even worse, “when you remove the contribution of favorable interest
rates [for calculating inventory carrying costs], the 10.6% of GDP plateau ap-
plies for most of the 1990s,” he cites in the 10th Annual State of Logistics Re-
port, cosponsored with ProLogis (Aurora, Colo.; 303-375-9292).
Decline in inventory investment efﬁciency contributes to logistics cost stagnation.
Delaney insists, “We must improve the efﬁciency of inventory investment.”
Yet it declined in the late 1990s. The ratio of shipments to unﬁlled orders in
manufacturing businesses that produce to order improved from 1.61 to 1.58
months of supply, but the ratio of shipments to inventory in manufacturing
businesses that produce to stock increased from 1.35 to 1.38 over the com-
parable one-year period.
“We had expected to see a trend developing in which the aggregated ra-
tio of manufacturing, wholesale, and retail trade inventory to monthly sales
would decline to 1.30,” Delaney acknowledges. “But it increased to 1.39.
We appear to be stuck between 1.35 and 1.40 months of supply since the

mid-1990s,” he details. “We have not taken inventory out of the system,” he
claims. “We are merely shifting where inventory is held within the supply
chain.”
Inventory performance is disappointing in view of new concepts.
“We have so
many initiatives to improve the efﬁciency of inventory investment,” Delaney
observes. These include CPFR programs and initiatives in electronic com-
merce and the use of the Internet. Yet as an example, he cites companies in
the consumer direct channel. “They began by testing and hardening their
operating models,” he offers. “They study alternative networks, of facilities
and levels of automation.”
Inventory investment appears to increase in the aggregate as consumer
direct companies implement their fulﬁllment centers. “The reason is that
traditional retailers and distributors do not concede their market to the e-
commerce start-ups,” Delaney explains. “They innovate pricing programs,
expand their product offering, and work at adding value to their customer
service. They will not reduce their inventory until it becomes clear that mar-
ket share has been lost.”
However, he cites the work of St. Onge Company (York, Pa.), a de-
signer of facilities and provider of automation consulting in the consumer
direct distribution and customized production channel. They have identi-
ﬁed 20 categories of products that can reduce their inventory investment by
one-third by the year 2005. These include pharmaceuticals, home decora-
tion, large household appliances, food, computers, and automobiles.
Why the emphasis on inventory investment efﬁciency has become so acute.
During
the late 1990s, the cost of the business logistics system increased 40% from a
decade earlier. This is equivalent to 10.6% of nominal GDP. The cost of car-
rying this inventory is about 3.9% of GDP. He further responded that obso-
lete inventory accounts for 40% of inventory carrying cost. 
According to Inventory Reduction Report studies, obsolete inventory is the
biggest challenge facing inventory managers. “We have not been able to ac-
celerate the velocity of inventory investment,” Delaney argues. “If we could
achieve an inventory to monthly sales ratio of 1.3,” he calculates, “we would
improve our logistics productivity by $25 billion.”
There will be increased pressure on inventory managers to achieve this target.
That is,
if logistics costs have any chance to remain at existing levels or even improve.
The reason? Potentially devastating cost hikes in other areas. Among them:
794
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

• The driver shortage will become even more acute. Some companies
are advertising $4,000 signing bonuses with no waiting period. The average
pay scale for drivers increased by 10%.
• Fuel economy will decrease as the 2002 emission rules take effect.
The related increase in the cost of fuel will be passed through directly to the
prices paid for trucking services.
• The Ocean Shipping Reform Act will provide $2 billion of improved
productivity over the next ﬁve years. However, Delaney charges, “We have
kept $30 billion on the table by prohibiting the states from permitting heav-
ier trucks and by preserving the economic protection of the Jones Act [re-
serves shipping between U.S. coastlines and territories to ships that are reg-
istered and built in the U.S. and are crewed by U.S. citizens].”
“We have to focus on inventory velocity because the costs of environ-
mental protection will make future cost reductions from transportation car-
riers unlikely,” Delaney insists (see sidebar).

ERP Systems: When the Logistics Productivity Gain Stalled
Delaney is harsh when it comes to ERP systems. “We have seen nothing com-
parable to the confusion created by ERP Systems in our 40 years of logistics
management experience,” he declares. “We note the installation of ERP sys-
tems has coincided with the productivity plateau of the 1990s.” He does not
put all the blame on ERP systems, however. Top management shares respon-
sibility.
“Many legacy planning systems that fueled past logistics productivity
gains were set aside in the move to ERP systems,” he reports. “ERP systems
do not appear to be providing logistics professionals with strong alternative
planning support.” Nevertheless, Delaney notes, “Key ERP vendors are re-
ducing interface obstacles by documenting and making their application pro-
grams accessible to supply chain systems.” Also, the Open Application Group
(OAG) has focused a standardized effort on interfaces to supply chain soft-
ware.
However, Delaney insists, “Implementation will lag 6 to 18 months be-
fore beneﬁting logistics professionals and two to four years before impacting
national productivity.” That is not acceptable, even if true. Delaney remains a
skeptic: “Based on experience, we have reason to doubt that it will be true.”
It is time for top management to “face the facts and resolve the logistics issues
and concerns regarding ERP systems,” he challenges in the 10th anniversary
edition of his State of Logistics Report.

With the potential beneﬁts of reduced operating costs, lower inventory in-
vestment, and improved customer service, the lure of outsourcing is strong.
Yet many outsourcing relationships dissolve within two years. According to
one survey, 57% of top high-tech companies expect to expand their out-
sourced services even though more than 44% of those currently retaining
third parties were so unhappy with their services that they had to change
providers.
This ambivalence toward outsourcing is corroborated by the authorita-
tive Mercer Management Consulting annual third-party logistics surveys.
Findings here indicate that ﬁrms routinely achieve a 30% to 40% reduction
in logistics costs, but also that for a large population of manufacturers, logis-
tics outsourcing is a source of failure and disappointment.
Outsourcing to continue its growth pattern.
The beneﬁts of outsourcing are a
strong magnet for many. For instance, industry expert Richard D. Arm-
strong, president of Armstrong & Associates, Inc. (Stoughton, Wis.; 608-
873-8929), estimates potential savings of 7% to 10% in reduced inventory
and carrying costs alone from using a third-party provider. 
Further, the author of Who’s Who in Logistics? Armstrong’s Guide to Third-
Party Logistics Services Providers ﬁnds warehousing providers, for instance, in-
cluding radio frequency, multiple location inventory checking, and other
features, “well beyond traditional service offerings.” Other value-added ser-
vices now routinely include sequencing, metering, kitting, and other ware-
house-related items as well.
Expanded services a deﬁnite drawing card for outsourcing more functions.
“Gener-
ally, most ﬁrms will begin using a third-party logistics provider for a basic
service like warehousing or inventory management and control,” explains
Charles A. Watts, CPIM, John Carroll University (University Heights,
Ohio). “They will then increase their level of involvement with an out-
sourcing partner for more extensive value-added services,” he observed at
Congress for Progress XXIV (Mid-Atlantic Chapters of APICS).
“As customers become more accustomed to a third-party provider, they
may be willing to venture into more value-added services,” he explains.
“These services involve areas of the value chain other than pure logistics
functions.”
796
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

John P. Blest, operations manager, Fulﬁllment Systems International, a
third-party logistics provider, perceives this new market, too. “With the ad-
vent of virtual manufacturing and the evolving trend toward the implemen-
tation of supply chain management strategies, new third-party services—
such as order processing, product and marketing features fulﬁllment, repair
and return services, customer service, pick, pack and ship, and freight for-
warding—are emerging,” he says. Even total inventory management is be-
ing outsourced as organizations concentrate on fully exploiting their core
competencies, he claimed at a recent APICS International Conference.
End-customer contact by third-party provider seeds of discontent.
The potential
problem of outsourcing relationships is pinpointed by Blest. “The signiﬁcant
difference between subcontracting of the past and outsourcing of the future
is the increased potential for third-party suppliers to have contact, directly or
indirectly, with one’s end customer,” he says. “Logistics and distribution pro-
viders have an exceedingly high potential to inﬂuence your relationships
with your customers. Therefore, great care must be taken in the selection
process.”
An insider’s guide for selecting a third-party provider.
“In the search for a
provider, it is important to predeﬁne the elements of the contemplated ser-
vice before listening to sales representatives,” he insists. “For even the small-
est ﬁrm, I would recommend preparing an RFP.”
As he details, “Make sure you deﬁne in this RFP all the needs of your
organization that the potential supplier must meet.” These may include what
you expect to provide in information and timing of the same to the supplier,
such as status of inbound shipments, open purchase orders, part numbers,
and part number ﬁeld length. Other crucial elements are descriptions, de-
scription ﬁeld length, units of measure used, kitting requirements, environ-
mental constraints, lot number tracking needs, and stock rotation require-
ments.
“One should also deﬁne expectations of the ﬁrm with respect to the ser-
vice provider,” he adds. These primarily include informational needs like
shipment arrivals, damaged-in-transit reports, inspection and check-in time,
and when it is added to inventory. Other questions that may need to be sat-
isﬁed and detailed include the following:
• Will you have to visit the third-party provider to conduct periodic as-
sessment of stock count or condition?
Insights from the Pros
797

• When will the item be removed from inventory?
• How will inventory reconciliation be accomplished between your
records and the service provider?
• What happens when inventory shrinkage occurs?
• Who pays for lost goods?
“Ask the prospective provider for at least three current client references
as well as bank and insurance contacts,” he reminds. “If a signiﬁcant portion
of the provider’s workforce is temporary, ask for the temporary employment
agency contact as a reference.”
Five Managerial Practices That Ultimately Lead
to Successful Logistics Relationships 
A team of researchers from the University of Maryland conducted an in-
depth survey of logistics professionals to identify the requirements for es-
tablishing effective third-party relationships. The team (Sandor Boyson,
Thomas Corsi, Martin Dressner, and Elliott Rabinovich) reported the fol-
lowing in the Journal of Business Logistics:
1. Firms should identify potential third-party logistics providers by us-
ing sources of information close to the ﬁrms’ immediate business, and with
no vested interest or biases in providing the information.
2. Firms should rely on internal knowledge capabilities in order to eval-
uate the potential costs and process improvements proposed by third-party
logistics providers.
3. Contracting agreements are central to logistics outsourcing relation-
ships. In general, outsourcing ﬁrms prefer to take a risk-adverse position to-
ward logistics outsourcing. They favor the adoption of preventive measures
to ensure the success of their relationship with third-party logistics pro-
viders. These measures are reﬂected in contract clauses explicitly outlining
the charges for services, monitoring the performance of the providers, and
establishing a structured set of responsibilities.
4. To manage the relationship effectively, it is best for ﬁrms to consoli-
date core logistics capabilities within a single ofﬁce (headed by a chief logis-
tics ofﬁcer who reports to a CEO or VP of operations). Internal logistics ex-
perts need to maintain organizational control of the outsourcing process.
798
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

5. Firms must be aware that to build effective outsourcing relationships,
they need to rely on knowledgeable in-house managers to audit and moni-
tor third-party logistics providers. The extensive use of metrics is a key tool
in managing the performance of third-party logistics providers.
Bottom line: The “burning” issue demands careful management of third-party rela-
tionships.
The University of Maryland researchers conclude, “Maintaining
an internal capability to manage the logistics outsourcing process has
emerged as a critical issue.” Firms engaging third-party logistics providers
need to have the internal expertise to perform a thorough, up-front review
of the providers’ systems and capabilities. Internal logistics experts also are
required to maintain ongoing organizational control of the outsourcing pro-
cess, they insist.
“Increased gains from outsourcing multiple logistics functions suggest
that ﬁrms take a strategic approach to outsourcing,” the team advises. A
strategic approach involves the identiﬁcation of long-term goals and the sep-
aration of supply chain activities into those that are essential to achieving
core goals. Outsourcing, they remind, should only be considered for non-
core activities.
“Companies should evaluate the costs and beneﬁts of insourcing versus
outsourcing for each of the activities, and when advantageous, outsource
multiple activities,” they advise. Furthermore, “companies should ensure
that gains from outsourcing do not dissipate after the initial year by building
into the relationship steps for continuous improvement.”

It might be the right time to take another look at supplier certiﬁcation. Pur-
chasing professionals are complaining of falling supplier quality. Yet, Supplier
Selection and Management Report reader surveys ﬁnd that the activity in sup-
plier certiﬁcation and efforts to help the supplier community improve its
quality performance have been dwindling. In the most recent survey, these
efforts are virtually nonexistent.
Improved supplier quality and supplier certification go together.
We are not
alone with these concerns. For instance, Jerry W. Claunch, CPM, presi-
dent of Claunch & Associates, Inc. (Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.; 561-626-
Insights from the Pros
799

0347), argues, “Many companies desire certified suppliers, yet they are not
developing suppliers who meet the criteria of delivering 100% quality
products.”
Robert J. Trent, Lehigh University (610-758-4952), and Robert M.
Monczka, Michigan State University (517-432-2086), charge, “Many pur-
chasers become complacent once a supplier receives certiﬁcation. This re-
ﬂects a belief that quality certiﬁcation guarantees total quality from certiﬁed
suppliers,” they told a recent NAPM Annual International Purchasing Con-
ference.
There may be some validity here. For example, only four years ago, one
in three Supplier Selection and Management Report survey respondents reported
having active certiﬁcation processes in place. Today, that number is down to
just over 10%. 
Supplier certiﬁcation demands continuous commitment.
What many ignore is
that supplier processes, management, and workforces change over time. To
the NAPM audience, Trent and Monczka emphasized, “Certiﬁcation de-
mands a continuous commitment of resources for regular reassessment.”
Addressing the same NAPM meeting, Claunch charged, “Based on the
desire to eliminate inspection, most companies have reduced the number of
employees in the receiving inspection department, but they haven’t gotten
the supply base to the level necessary to meet their quality requirement.” 
To assist purchasing pros rekindle the certiﬁcation process, he offers an
eight-step process (see sidebar).
Meanwhile, others still forge ahead with their own supplier certiﬁcation initiatives.
For instance, a purchasing director at a midsize producer of die castings says,
“Our purpose in certifying suppliers is to ensure we have a consistent supply
of products conforming to our requirements.” 
Included among the certiﬁcation requirements they insist their suppli-
ers adhere to are a long-term, spotless record of quality and delivery perfor-
mance; an assurance that an SPC process is currently in place; and an assur-
ance that an internal quality audit is periodically performed. “We always
request they make their records available to us,” he notes. 
Currently, they have about 25 suppliers certiﬁed. “We purchase 80% of
our production materials from this group of suppliers,” the director reveals.

Eight Steps That Will Make Supplier Certiﬁcation a Reality
1. Find suppliers who are willing and able to improve their processes. Without
process improvement, your efforts to transform are of little use. Once you be-
gin this transformation, the supplier must then prove that they will improve
their processes.
2. Differentiate between speciﬁcation and tolerance within your company and
your suppliers. To get your suppliers to the level of performance required for
certiﬁcation, it is recommended that all the information you provide to sup-
pliers separates the speciﬁcations from the tolerance. This includes informa-
tion on prints, drawings, handbooks, purchase orders, operation or routing
sheets, and results of receiving inspection. All information provided from re-
ceiving inspection should identify and picture the spread and target of the
items checked at receiving.
3. Conduct risk analysis to determine the features that are important to your prod-
uct performance. Have suppliers conduct risk analysis on their processes to en-
sure your risk features are controlled in their processing. Failure Mode and Ef-
fect Analysis (FMEA) is the recommended risk analysis tool.
4. Require control plans of all suppliers. The makers of the parts are respon-
sible for the quality; your job is to provide meaningful data about the features;
and the supplier must plan how they are going to monitor their processes to
ensure that you get 100% conforming product.
5. Require run charting by supplier on all features identiﬁed in the risk analysis (step
3) to accompany all product that enters your facility. This run chart is just as important
as the product; if it does not accompany the product, rejection of the lot must
occur, and the material be returned. This may delay your production, but it will
only happen once. This step will ensure that the suppliers accept ownership of
quality and your receiving inspection will be able to verify accuracy.
6. Insist that receiving inspection provide information that makes the supplier fo-
cus on their processes and verify that improvements are realized at your company. Have
receiving inspection provide histograms on all product they inspect. This his-
togram must be based on your receiving inspectors readings, not the run chart
supplied by the supplier.
7. Conduct incoming product capability analysis. This is received material ca-
pability information and is a very useful tool to improve the quality perfor-
mance of suppliers. Organized data provides facts. Make decisions on facts and
provide monthly reports on Cp and Cpk of incoming product capability.
8. Insist on a performance level that gets the supplier to a fallout of 0. This will
require that the supplier apply the tools listed above and that they improve
their processes. This is the step that you need to have achieved in order to cer-
tify a supplier.

Missiles Systems, the Boeing Company (St. Louis; 314-233-7337), shares a
unique experience.
“McDonnell Douglas came into the Boeing merger with a supplier cer-
tiﬁcation process recognized in the aerospace industry as the best,” he ex-
plained at an Annual Performance Measurement for the Purchasing Func-
tion Conference (sponsored by the Manufacturing Institute, a division of the
Institute for International Research; New York). 
“We’re moving forward, taking that process, improving it, and using it
for all of the Information, Space & Defense Systems group,” he advised. The
program has three major elements:
1. Continuing performance as determined by supplier performance
measurements
2. Supplier implementation of statistical process control
3. Appropriate processes in place for running their business now and for
the future
“I ask the strategic sourcing teams for each category to get me the right
supply base, develop long-term strategies for that category, and to work on
the improvement of that part of the supply base by identifying the suppliers
we want to certify,” Juergens outlined. “We want to certify only those sup-
pliers that are strategically important to us, and that’s probably 10% to 15%
of our supply base,” he allows.
Tracking qualiﬁed suppliers and identifying candidates for certiﬁcation.
Steven M.
Rose, CPIM, purchasing agent at Exide Electronics (Raleigh, N.C.), ex-
plains that their supplier qualiﬁcation program has been developed internally
by a self-directed materials/purchasing team. “The process continues to
evolve over time as the team builds on its successes and collective experi-
ence,” he told an audience at a recent Congress for Progress, sponsored by
the Mid-Atlantic Chapters of APICS.
Candidates for supplier qualiﬁcation are typically manufacturers of
higher-technology, highly critical components, including circuit breakers,
contactors, batteries, fans, transformers, printed circuit assemblies, cable har-
nesses, and custom switchboards.
Prior to qualiﬁcation, a supplier must submit a self-survey and a copy of
its quality manual. The Exide team then performs an on-site evaluation of
the supplier’s facility. Once the supplier is qualiﬁed, the parts received from
802
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

them are tracked throughout the facility and become candidates for certiﬁ-
cation. “The parts must ﬁrst meet a predetermined number of successive lots
received with no defects,” Rose explains.
“Certiﬁed parts bypass receiving inspection, saving on incoming in-
spection, manufacturing defects, downtime, and overhead costs,” he de-
scribes. The initiative is paying dividends. 
Defect percentages from nonqualiﬁed suppliers have been 0.49%, while
they are only 0.03% from the qualiﬁed group. And since the inception of the
supplier qualiﬁcation program, he offers, “there has been a 97% overall re-
duction in defects.” Additionally, the Large Systems Group currently buys
80% of its purchased dollars through qualiﬁed suppliers.
What these practitioners understand, and what Claunch afﬁrms: “It’s in-
cumbent upon purchasing professionals to select suppliers that have a desire
and management to improve quality, reduce lead time, and provide the cor-
rect quantities of items purchased.” And a vigilant supplier certiﬁcation is the
start.

Purchasing professionals can prepare for an onslaught of new supply chain
initiatives, with more information technology solutions. That is our con-
clusion from reviewing the ﬁndings of a comprehensive, recently released
Vision in Manufacturing study, from Deloitte & Touche and Deloitte Con-
sulting.
The renewed commitment to supply chain management.
Executives in high tech,
chemical, aerospace and defense, automotive, consumer product, and phar-
maceutical industries “increasingly” regard supply chain integration as an in-
dispensable element for success in manufacturing. Now, 73% of the respon-
dents have a high commitment to the future supply chain integration with
suppliers; 68% indicate the same commitment to customer integration. Five
years earlier, it was about 40%.
James H. Quigley, managing director of manufacturing services at De-
loitte & Touche LLP (St. Louis, 314-694-7883), observes, “This new era
will require market leaders to recast their enterprises to improve new prod-
uct development, create customer-centric organizations, tighten global
supply chain links, and harness the intellectual capital of the organization.”

The challenge for purchasing professionals.
What the industries’ top executives
may be thinking will require purchasing professionals to initiate. 
The report, done in collaboration with Aleda V. Roth of the Kenan-
Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
notes, “As the pendulum swings toward globalization, innovation and cus-
tomer orientation, supply chain superiority will be a decisive competitive
advantage. Manufacturers must be able to adapt quickly to the increasingly
unpredictable shifts in customer demand. To achieve greater efﬁciencies in
product development, sourcing, production and distribution, a company
must interface closely with its suppliers. Efﬁcient supply chains are also nec-
essary to extend the links to new overseas markets.”
Current supply chain integration less than ideal.
The results of the Vision in
Manufacturing study reveal that a “typical” manufacturing company is far
from achieving ideal supply chain integration. While nearly half the sur-
vey respondents described their own organization as well integrated, only
40% indicate a high level of “cohesiveness” with their suppliers and cus-
tomers.
For the future, however, there will be an all-out push to improve the
level of integration with every partner in the supply chain. And this initia-
tive will be led by an additional emphasis on more supplier integrations. The
report observes, “As manufacturers continue to feel the pressure to reduce
unit costs, they will further scrutinize the price of materials and supplies.
Many will economize by consolidating and rationalizing their supplier
bases.” This conclusion conﬁrms the results of our reader surveys.
Tighter supplier integration is a worldwide theme.
Regionally, executives in
North America and Europe emphasize integration with raw material sup-
pliers and other suppliers far more than those in the Asia-Paciﬁc region. 
Three-fourths of North American and European executives place a high
priority on tightening these links. By contrast, it is only 45% in the Asia-
Paciﬁc area. According to the report, “The complex distribution channels
in industrialized markets, coupled with the pressure to reduce cycle time, is
forcing executives to prioritize supplier integration.”
Technology to play a major role in improving supply chain performance.
Two-
thirds of the respondents say that they plan to use electronic links, such as
EDI and related Internet-based technology platforms, to enhance supply
chain relationships (see Figure III-1.22). Technology platforms like EDI and
804

ERP systems (SAP, ORACLE, BaaN, PeopleSoft) are integrating suppliers,
manufacturers, and retailers in delivering value to customers.
The Internet provides buyers with a new channel from which to get vir-
tual product information and make purchases. While this adds to the chal-
lenges, the report offers, “it also opens immense opportunities for suppliers
to gather information on consumption patterns and demand changes. This,
in turn, can make manufacturers more responsive to their customers by an-
ticipating their needs.”
Leading manufacturing companies using ERP.
The study ﬁnds that these com-
panies are using ERP systems to deploy advanced planning and scheduling
systems and sales force automation tools. Currently, over one-fourth of the
market leaders use ERP systems compared to only 10% of the “followers.” 
This trend is expected to continue over the next three years. Almost
one-half (45%) of the market leaders and 27% of market followers give high
emphasis to using these systems. Part of this difference is explained by the
facts that market leaders tend to be larger and that they are more likely to
make ERP investments.

Cross-border alliances and joint ventures to grow.
The second most preferred
strategy for supply chain improvement is through cross-border alliances and
joint ventures. The report observes, “Forging these alliances allows manu-
facturers to expand global reach, open new distribution channels, and facil-
itate access to lower-cost suppliers and cheaper labor. Partners also help each
other overcome regulatory barriers and investment restrictions.”

“We’ve discovered—often the hard way—that selecting the supplier with
the lowest price does not always equate to selecting the supplier that can pro-
vide the best product/service,” acknowledges Lorrie K. Mitchell, relation-
ship manager, Supply Chain Management Department, BellSouth Tele-
communications (Atlanta, Ga.: 404-420-6068).
“Nor does it guarantee a successful relationship between buyer and
seller,” she says. “The goal of supply chain management today is ﬁrst to fa-
cilitate the selection of a supplier who can best meet the ‘client’s needs’ and
then at the fairest price.” The “new” process begins with your in-house
client, then moves on to your suppliers. And that experience stems from a
supplier selection process at BellSouth.
Develop your own in-house client guidelines.
“Everything you need will ﬂow
from your client guidelines,” Mitchell declared at a recent NAPM Annual
International Purchasing Conference.
This document is shared with the client to set their expectations and
identify the deliverables they will need to provide you. “Communicate your
game plan to your client,” she offers. “Let them know the activities and in-
formation they will be responsible for providing.” 
When used to its potential, the client guidelines are a one-stop shopping
tool you use to educate and guide your clients through their project,
Mitchell asserts. She detailed the following as the essential elements required
to “ensure the clients include all the pertinent and necessary information for
a supplier to provide a good reply”:
806
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

• Identify what your client is looking for. From this point on you will be
working as a team. She reminds, “As the supply chain manager, you’ll be set-
ting the scene of the activities to follow; therefore it’s important they un-
derstand the process and realize how important their input is, so they’ll be
willing partners.”
• Speciﬁcally, help clients develop their speciﬁcations/capabilities document.
Usually, Mitchell relates, they have never done this before. “True, you don’t
write specs either, but you at least know what a supplier is looking for when
they respond to a solicitation or any request for product or work.” Get the
group to identify and detail the scope of the work to be done.
• Identify applicable documents to be included. This may cover company
publications or applicable forms. “Actuals and forecasted quantities for the
next three to ﬁve years, as appropriate and applicable, also can be quite help-
ful to the prospective suppliers,” Mitchell suggests. The client also will have
to identify what property or services they will provide, and what the sup-
plier is expected to provide.
Questions they might address include, “What systems will be inter-
faced?” and “What are the anticipated quality standards and performance
criteria?” Also, include progress report requirements that describe how the
supplier is doing. “If you share your project timeline with your suppliers,
you’ll be surprised at the cooperation you’ll receive, not to mention the lack
of requests for extensions,” Mitchell observes.
• Decide which suppliers have the product/capabilities you need. In this stage
you will develop the “most important” document in selecting the “perfect”
supplier. It is known as the supplier technical/capabilities questionnaire.
“The reason these questions are so important is that without their answers
you and your client have no way of knowing if a supplier understood what
you were looking for and if they indeed have the capability to provide it,”
Mitchell advises.
To learn what the supplier can do, ask the suppliers two types of open-
ended questions. First, your client needs to identify the general questions to
determine supplier capabilities, size, past business experience, and similar
items. Secondly, speciﬁc questions addressing the product/service outcome
need to be documented.
Once the questions are identiﬁed, the technical selection team deter-
mines the importance or weight associated with each. “This organized sys-
tematic approach in selecting a supplier ensures selection based on capabili-
ties and requested outcome, not solely based on price, while eliminating
Insights from the Pros
807

subjectivity to a large degree,” Mitchell explains. The approach not only en-
sures the client that the best supplier has been selected, but also can provide
a documented summary of reasons why they were selected.
• Negotiate a fair, reasonable price. One important tip she imparts: “When
you issue your solicitation to the suppliers, ask them to package their tech-
nical/capabilities responses and economic responses separately.” The reason?
When you meet with the technical selection team to review the technical
responses, explain to them that while they are evaluating the technical/ca-
pabilities responses, you will be analyzing the economics. “And do that,” she
emphasizes. “Your client wants and needs to know exactly how far this proj-
ect will set their budget back—capital and expense. This needs to be ex-
plained to the team up front.” 
Explain to the team that when they complete the technical evaluation
and a subgroup of suppliers is selected, you will provide them with an anal-
ysis of the supplier pricing for discussion with the team. However, it’s still up
to you to negotiate the price once the subgroup of supplier ﬁnalists is se-
lected.
• Develop and maximize the relationship. This step determines which sup-
pliers would be interested in sharing risk and success with you. “The devel-
opment of the buyer/supplier relationship and the establishment of a per-
formance-based contract will ensure a successful working relationship with
the selected supplier,” she assures. 
A performance-based contract is the necessary tool to foster a long-term
relationship with a supplier. Both the buyer and seller focus on their long-
range ﬁnancial and value-added beneﬁts. “In the past, contracts were nego-
tiated solely with a set fee structure. Occasionally, a penalty clause would be
negotiated, and less frequently an incentive clause was included,” she notes.
“A performance-based contract is the true win-win scenario of the perfect
union of these concepts,” she allows. 
A performance-based contract provides an opportunity for shared risk
while maximizing the opportunity for mutual success. It also develops a
strong mutually beneﬁcial arrangement where both parties have something
to gain and something to lose if their “partner” is experiencing a problem.
The right type of environment makes it work.
There should be strong commu-
nication and sharing of information between the supplier and buyer, as well
as between the supplier and the customer/end user.
Additionally, a good speciﬁcations/capabilities document is critical.
808
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

“Communication and buy-in of the customer/end user are critical since ul-
timately, they will be implementing the performance-based contract,”
Mitchell explains. “Both parties need to know the other will go beyond the
agreed-upon terms and conditions to make this a successful and proﬁtable
relationship.” 
Determining the performance factors.
The identiﬁcation and establishment of
performance indicators and the associated outcome criteria are a must, she
insists. Although performance measurements will vary, each relationship
needs to determine exactly what it will take to make it a success.

Easily one of the most pressing concerns for purchasing professionals today
is the development and initiation of meaningful supplier performance met-
rics. With the growing number of supplier partnerships and the increasing
pressure to form supply chains, performance measurements are even more
critical than previously advocated.
As an example, Terry Sueltman, vice president of supply management
at Industrial Automation & Control, Honeywell Inc. (Phoenix; terry.suelt-
man@iac.honeywell.com), insists, “Even as you may talk of partnerships,
or having supplier representatives on-site, you still have to go back to the
basics and manage supplier performance. You just don’t turn over the busi-
ness to them and forget about it,” he says. “You must measure the supplier’s
performance and tell them how they’re doing, or what you expect from
them.” 
Deﬁning just the right factors and parameters.
For instance, William S. Wehr,
CPM, director of quality systems at Lewis-Goetz and Company, Inc. (Pitts-
burgh; 412-341-7100), declares, “Measurement criteria comprise the ﬁrst
process area to be addressed in starting our supplier partnership management
process. The buyer’s performance goals that are critical for effective support
of his/her customers must be translated into associated goals for the sup-
plier,” he told a recent NAPM Annual International Purchasing Conference.
“In developing a supplier rating system, we ask two questions,” offers
Patrick S. Woods, CPM, CPIM, APP, commodity manager at Emerson
Electric/Fisher Controls (Sherman, Texas; 903-868-8160):
Insights from the Pros
809

1. What types of performance measures of a supplier are important to
my ﬁrm?
2. What are the minimum acceptable criteria in each of these measures?
Debating the speciﬁc factors before selecting them.
Mark S. Miller, CPM,
CIRM, purchasing manager at Case Corporation (Racine, Wis.; 414-636-
6565), acknowledges, “We had much debate as to the most important fac-
tors that should be used to measure supplier performance and about the
weighting the individual factors should get in the overall supplier rating.”
At Case, he told the NAPM audience, they formed a team to study
other companies to decide which factors and weights were being used. As a
result of their benchmarking study, they decided to use delivery (30%), qual-
ity (30%), value (20%), and partnering (20%) as the factors and weights.
The team then had to deﬁne, in greater detail, each of the four factors
being measured. As an example, he shared how they measure the supplier’s
value performance. “We decided that value would be calculated from a sub-
jective survey that buyers would ﬁll out quarterly,” he describes. 
The value survey asks the buyer to look at total acquisition cost, not just
price. “Total acquisition cost considers all costs: freight, handling, quality,
administrative, and not just the price quote,” Miller deﬁnes. Cost reductions
and cost increases compared with the inﬂation rate are also considered by the
buyer.
“Soft” cost reductions, such as cycle time reductions, inventory reduc-
tions, EDI transactions, and assistance in initial designs are also given con-
sideration when rating a supplier’s value performance.
For the supplier’s partnering performance measure, a survey is com-
pleted by a team of buyers, engineers, expediters, and representatives from
receiving, accounts payable, and quality.
There are ﬁve main areas that are measured (accessibility, responsive-
ness/attitude, engineering/technology, administrative practices, and proac-
tive/innovation). Questions in the partnering survey ask the team to con-
sider issues such as supplier sense or urgency, process control plan, use of
EDI, invoicing process, billing procedures, customer service support, design
process, and quality of supplier personnel.
The scoreboard approach to supplier performance measurement.
Edward J. Ram
Jr., senior supply chain manager at Allegiance Healthcare Corporation
(McGaw, Ill.; 847-473-0400), believes in limiting the number of perfor-
mance measures to “provide focus on each one that is selected.” At Alle-
810
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

giance, Ram and his team identiﬁed four service measures and three re-
source measures.
The service measures include EDI, supplier ﬁll rate, supplier ﬁll time,
and distributor service level. The resource measures are return on managed
capital (ROMC), days inventory on hand (DIOH), and excess inventory.
“Since the measures we selected are dependent on other processes in the
supply chain, they indirectly measure those processes,” he explained at a re-
cent Supply Chain Forum (Institute for International Research; New York).
For example, return on managed capital is affected by accounts payable
to suppliers and product cube, while excess inventory is inﬂuenced by fore-
cast accuracy and return policies. “In our case we found that of the seven
measures, ﬁve were readily available each month in an automated format,”
Ram notes. For instance, supplier ﬁll time is captured using the ship date
from either the EDI supplier ship notice, or the bill of lading collected by
inbound transportation. 
For the two others, different approaches were required. Supplier ﬁll
rate, for example, needed to have a proxy developed, since Allegiance is not
yet receiving EDI ship notice from all suppliers. “A program was written that
counted as ﬁrst ship, any PO lines that were received within a four-day win-
dow of the ﬁrst line received against a PO,” he explains.
Developing meaningful rating formulas.
“Rating criteria at Emerson Electric/
Fisher Controls are established via formulas, and each formula is developed
and reviewed in such areas as quality, delivery, and supplier lead time,” Woods
explains. 
There are innumerable ways to measure supplier on-time performance.
At Emerson Electric/Fisher Controls, the acceptable criteria as deﬁned by
the committee are supplier promise date and customer request date.
“The supplier promise date is a reﬂection of the supplier’s ability to meet
its commitments to you and to do what they say they are going to do,”
Woods explained at the NAPM conference. “Delivery by request date is an
attempt to rate the supplier in their ability to meet your customer’s request
for your product that will incorporate the supplier’s item.”
At Case, they also wrestled with the shipment date or receipt date as a
measure of supplier delivery performance. Miller explains the rationale for
their choice: “Since most of our contracts call for FOB-supplier plant, we
decided to measure on-time based on ship date, using ASN. This removes
the performance of carriers or the promptness of internal receiving opera-
tions from the measurement,” he states.

Communication is critical to program’s success.
Sueltman is an ardent advocate
of providing suppliers with feedback from the performance rating process.
“We just don’t send them something on a monthly basis, we actually go to
them and talk about it, going over every point. We also tell them why we
need a speciﬁc kind of performance from them.”
At Allegiance, Ram explains, “We encourage the scoreboard be used
routinely whenever meetings are held with the suppliers.” This, he believes,
reinforces the importance of the scoreboard across all functions. “It also leads
to concrete steps to improve the factors that impact the performance mea-
sures on the scoreboard,” he maintains.

Surprising, if not shocking, conclusions from two recent studies should
sound the wake-up call for purchasing and supplier management. Basically,
the independent ﬁndings reveal that they are not applying practices and con-
cepts proven to bring efﬁciency and effectiveness to the supplier manage-
ment process in a meaningful manner.
Speciﬁcally, in a research study of supply chain best practices (see side-
bar), Kevin McCormack of Complete Business Solutions, Inc. (Birming-
ham, Ala.; kevin_mccormack@cbsinc.com), determined that “many spe-
ciﬁc best practices that they propose as solutions for improving supply chain
management do not have as much of an impact as they are often presented
to have.”
Additionally, Greg Hackett, president of the Hackett Group (Hudson,
Ohio; 330-656-3110), which conducts ongoing benchmark studies of pro-
curement, observes, “It’s remarkable there are established methods for im-
proving costs and efﬁciency in procurement and yet they’re not widely
used.”
A wealth of opportunity being squandered.
According to the most recent ﬁnd-
ings from the Hackett Group’s research, companies using such practices as
bar coding, EDI, procurement cards (P-cards), and blanket purchase orders
are “reaping the beneﬁts of cost savings, better information, and higher lev-
els of customer satisfaction.” Yet, none of them are widely used.
For example, Hackett reports, while top performing organizations use
bar coding to expedite processing, more than 80% of material receipts at the
812
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

average company are processed manually. Similarly, EDI is used, at most,
about 30% of the time.
“Order placement, release and acknowledgment, and shipping notices
remain manual-intensive at the average company,” he reveals. First quartile
companies in the survey use EDI about a third more than average compa-
nies.

Preliminary Supply Chain Management Study Revealing,
but Needs More Input
Admittedly, the ﬁrst supply chain management study commissioned by the
Supply-Chain Council (Pittsburgh; www.supply-chain.org) and conducted by
Complete Business Solutions, Inc. (Birmingham, Ala.; 205-733-2096), is con-
sidered preliminary as the database is rather small. However, at a recent Supply-
Chain Council conference Kevin McCormack agreed, “The descriptive sta-
tistics, although not entirely representative at this point, indicate clear areas of
agreement on the current state of the supply chain decision processes.”
The survey, distributed to the members of the Supply-Chain Council,
was organized to match the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR)
model areas of Plan, Source, Make, and Deliver. 
Several results in the Source process stand out as “interesting.”
“The initial expecta-
tion of the research team was that the Source process was going to be the most
mature in regards to structure and process (measures, documentation, team
structure),” McCormack explains. The preliminary results indicate otherwise. 
For instance, there is a strong correlation about the importance of the
measurement and feedback of supplier performance. Yet 30% of the respon-
dents report this is “never” or only “sometimes” done in their source process.
Only 12% report that it is always done.
Considering the level of emphasis that has been placed on supplier inter-
relationship and procurement process documentation, the response level
again is “surprisingly low.” According to the survey, respondents answered
“never” or only “sometimes” 35% of the time for supplier interrelationship
and 28% for procurement process documentation.
The lack of sharing planning and scheduling information with suppliers
also is unexpected. Almost half (47%) of the respondents answered “never” or
only “sometimes.” “With all of the publicity about supplier cooperation and
now collaboration, this is really a surprising percentage,” McCormack reports.
Nevertheless, this study provides the beginning framework for compari-
son and discussion about practices and principles that relate to supply chain
decision process performance. Further studies will follow.

Only 4% of transactions are executed with P-cards.
According to Hackett, these
cards could possibly handle an estimated 40% to 50% instead. First quartile
companies use P-cards for twice as many transactions as the average com-
pany. “Procurement cards not only reduce transactional costs in purchasing,
the cards typically reduce the cost of making a payment by more than 85%,”
Hackett declares. 
Blanket orders are also underutilized.
Two-thirds of transactions are processed
without blanket POs, while the best companies use blankets more than half
the time. Top performers also rely on long-term contracts to a greater ex-
tent. At the average company, only about 60% of contracts are of a long-term
nature (greater than one year). For companies in the ﬁrst quartile, it’s 72%.
Other ﬁndings show that there is room for much improvement.
More than 1,200
organizations participate in The Hackett Group Best Practices Benchmark Study
of Procurement. Other signiﬁcant ﬁndings of the study include the following:
• On average, a company spends 1% of its purchased costs to manage the pro-
curement function, but the range is wide. This cost includes basic transactions
such as requisition and PO processing as well as activities such as supplier
performance measurement and strategic sourcing.
There are four components to the cost: fully loaded labor (wages,
salaries, beneﬁts), outsourcing, systems (run time and maintenance for pro-
curement systems only), and others, such as facilities, supplies, and corporate
allocations.
While procurement costs the average organization 1% of purchased
costs, the range between the lowest and highest is large. First quartile com-
panies in the study have costs as low as 0.3%, and the fourth quartile have
costs greater than 1.8%.
“Examination of ﬁrst quartile companies reveals they have simpliﬁed their
procurement processes by incorporating best practices in their day-to-day op-
erations,” according to Hackett. “In addition, they’re integrating systems to
provide high-quality contract and price information across the enterprise.”
• Procurement spends bulk of its time on operational support activities. With
76% of procurement’s overall time focused on lower value-added activities
(requisition and PO processing, supplier selection and material receipts pro-
cessing), an appreciable number of purchasing managers and professionals
are engaged in routine, day-to-day control and risk management activities.
814
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

In fact, according to the study, the typical purchasing manager spends less
than 2% of the time helping to develop strategic alliances.
• Procurement staffs have an average of 157 full-time equivalent employees per
billion dollars of purchased goods. Similar to the earlier ﬁnding, only 42% of the
staff are buying specialists, while 46% are clerks and administrative person-
nel. Typically, the breakdown includes 113 operational support employees,
15 in control and risk management, 23 for decision support, and 6 in pro-
curement management. 
• As much as 56% of all supplier price negotiations occur at the business-unit
level. As a result, price and best practices information is seldom shared, lim-
iting the buying leverage across the corporation.
• On average, a billion-dollar company contracts with 12,200 suppliers.
However, the spending distribution among them is far from balanced. Some
90% of dollars are directed to only 18% of suppliers. The remaining 10% are
disbursed as small-dollar transactions among the other 10,000-plus suppliers.
First quartile companies are about 28% more concentrated in spending their
purchase dollars.
• A trend toward reducing the total number of suppliers is underway. The av-
erage company presently has 10% fewer suppliers than one year ago, as ra-
tionalization and strategic alliances take hold.
According to Supplier Selection & Management Report reader survey data,
supply base reduction is more than a trend. We consider it to be an ongoing,
continuously applied best practice. For the past six years, supply base reduc-
tion has been the top rated practice, always cited by the majority of our sur-
vey respondents. 
• Single sourcing remains beyond the reach of most procurement organizations.
While the total number of suppliers is slowly being reduced, some 76% of
companies report low or low-medium utilization of single sourcing. In con-
trast, only 3% claim high usage.
• Procurement is systems-intensive. The typical company has almost 30
procurement systems per billion dollars of purchased costs, according to
Hackett. It is one of the largest in the corporation.
These systems tend to be customized, complex, and not highly inte-
grated. Furthermore, the average age is just over seven years. “Given that
every six to eight years a company typically replaces most of its procurement
systems, many companies are due to update and replace their procurement
infrastructure,” he opines.

Based on the data, Hackett encourages, “Finding ways to boost pro-
curement’s spending effectiveness just 2% could mean an increase of $100
million in shareholder value for a billion dollar company.”

In this emerging age of supply chain management, supplier selection has be-
come an even more critical issue for purchasing professionals. It’s no longer
just a process to select a party to do business with. Now it presents the op-
portunity to evolve into a partnership, or an alliance.
This is why many purchasing professionals are giving more credence to
the selection process itself. For instance, Tony Noe, CPM, director of pur-
chasing at Macklanburg-Duncan (Oklahoma City; 405-557-3528), insists
on creating a documented information ﬁle on all suppliers.
Probe into the supplier’s qualiﬁcations.
“We gather basic information such as
its size, capacity, and history, and we scrutinize its customer list,” he said at
the NAPM Supply Chain Management conference. “Additionally, we look
closely at its equipment, paying attention to its age and upgrades.” 
Another important element is to review its management team, includ-
ing their experience and time with the company. “This is helpful should
there be a sudden and signiﬁcant change within the organization or its busi-
ness practice, as it could provide an insight as to the reason why,” Noe ex-
plains. 
Creating a supplier benchmark audit.
Meanwhile, Patrick S. Woods, CPM,
CPIM, APP, commodity manager at Emerson Electric/Fisher Controls
(Sherman, Texas; 903-868-8160), has created a supplier benchmark audit to
“deﬁne the standard by which to measure a supplier.” For him, the audit is
the precursor to supplier approval.
An essential element is the benchmark audit document (see sidebar). “It
is nothing more than an in-depth questionnaire that allows you to gather in-
formation about the supplier’s technical, operational, or ﬁnancial capabili-
ties,” he explained at a recent NAPM Annual International Purchasing Con-
ference. Items may be added or deleted depending on the importance to
your organization. 
He further advises, “The sample questions represent many different

important areas. Therefore, representatives from each of these areas within
your company should be involved in the development of the questions, and
as part of the team involved in benchmarking the supplier.”
Evaluating the supplier.
Assign points to each question, such as a scale of zero
to ﬁve, where zero is the worst, and ﬁve is the best. Then assign a weight to
each section, as each is not considered equally. At Emerson Electric/Fisher
Controls a perfect score is equal to 100 points.
Applying this logic to the audit questions could present a problem, he
concedes. Listed in the audit are 67 questions. Assuming that each question,
on average, would rate a three, the total points possible would equate to 201.
“To correct for this situation, each major section is assigned a maximum
number of points with a quality point adjustment factor, and then the sum
of the points for all sections is equal to 100 points,” Woods details.
“It also would be beneﬁcial to allow the supplier to review a copy of the
benchmark study ahead of time, and rate themselves,” he advises.
Developing the supplier survey scorecard.
The speciﬁc ratings for each survey
question, both supplier self-assessment and team assessment, are then sum-
marized in a scorecard format. The overall rating equates to “best in class”
(85 points or higher); “acceptable” (75 to 84 points); “marginal” (60 to 74
points); or “unacceptable” (below 59 points).

related industry that has demonstrated best-in-class capabilities, to bench-
mark. This will give you a true basis of comparison that your supplier should
work toward in its continuous improvement program,” he emphasizes.
Applying the ﬁndings.
“The standards will allow you quickly to sort out the
supplier’s strengths, weaknesses, and neutral points,” he describes. Key ques-
tions to consider would be:
• Do this supplier’s strengths outweigh their weaknesses?
• Are such weaknesses acceptable, or do they need to be corrected?
• Does this supplier already have an action plan in place to correct its
deﬁciencies, or is there an attitude of complacency?
• Are the supplier’s deﬁciencies correctable, or should I move on to an-
other source?
Should you choose to share the data with the supplier (and our recom-
mendation is that you should), Woods notes, “They also can beneﬁt since
you evaluated them in a clearly deﬁned, quantitative method, targeting spe-
ciﬁc areas for improvement.”

Purchasing professionals, as part of their routine supplier management re-
sponsibilities, often must wrestle with the complexities of contracts, com-
mercial law, the UCC, and the CISG (see sidebar). Now, they also must be-
come aware of the provisions of the equal opportunity and fair employment
laws. It appears that there are instances where purchasing professionals can
be held accountable for the actions of their suppliers or the employees of in-
dependent contractors.
The following highlights some key issues that are of special interest to
purchasers. The excerpts are taken from the authoritative Purchaser’s Legal
Adviser (Business Laws, Inc.; Chesterland, Ohio). As always, when con-
fronted with one of these situations, consult with your legal counsel.
Purchasing is responsible for sexual harassment by outsiders.

Fair Employment Laws: Compelling Issues Purchasers
Should Know About
1. Sexual harassment by outside salespeople against your employees is illegal,
and the company may be held responsible if it knew about the harassment
and did nothing. Has the purchasing department clearly stated to vendors
that harassment will not be tolerated?
2. Has your company clearly stated to vendors that harassment of the vendor’s
employees by your company employees will likewise not be tolerated?
Have you provided a speciﬁc procedure or person to contact if such ha-
rassment occurs?
3. The law on what the company is required to do in addressing harassment
is rather complex, but it almost always requires a prompt investigation. Do
your purchasers have a clear understanding of this, and do they know
whom within the company to contact? Have they been cautioned against
trying to ﬁx the problem themselves?
4. The ADA requires the company to provide accessible facilities, including
off-site facilities used for various functions. Do your contracts and proce-
dures for arranging for the use of outside facilities comply with the ADA’s
requirements? Do you inquire of your own people about speciﬁc arrange-
ments that must be made to accommodate certain people?
5. The ADA requires that new construction comply with detailed accessibil-
ity speciﬁcations. Do your contracts and procedures for new construction
(including remodeling) account for these speciﬁcations?
6. While most laws in the commercial environment do not require the com-
pany to police the fair employment practices of their suppliers, sometimes
as a business decision, doing so would be desirable. Do you have provisions
in your contracts that allow you to terminate a supplier if it does not com-
ply with fair employment laws and practices?
7. Many laws and company policies require or encourage a drug-free work-
place. How do you address this in contracts for work to be done on your
premises: 
(a) a simple prohibition against drugs on the company’s property and
against allowing any independent contractor’s employees who are un-
der the inﬂuence of drugs onto the property? 
(b) a policy requiring the contractor itself to have a drug-testing program?

appropriate policies and procedures addressing this matter. Less publicized
and not recognized is the harassment of your employees by outsiders. This
may involve a representative from the supplier community, or an employee
of an independent contractor who is doing some work in your facility.
Most sexual harassment litigation involves sexual harassment between
employees of the same company. However, the position of the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission is that “companies are responsibly for
sexual harassment by outsiders just as they would be for harassment by their
own employees.” According to Purchaser’s Legal Adviser, this ruling has never
been “expressly rejected by a court.”
What purchasers must do to avoid liability.
Typically, the company is respon-
sible for harassment by outsiders if it has reason to know that the harassment
is occurring and fails to take steps to deal with it. Therefore, purchasing pro-
fessionals should not ignore a coworker who complains about being the vic-
tim of unwanted advances. Instead, you have a responsibility to promptly re-
fer the complaint to the appropriate person within the company. This should
be done within hours of receiving the complaint.
The reason: In cases where the company has been absolved of liability
by the courts, they had undertaken a “very prompt and thorough investiga-
tion of the complaint.” This has been interpreted as a matter of hours and
days, rather than weeks or months. 
Communicate the antiharassment policy to your suppliers and contractors.
Some
purchasers publicize a policy that is distributed to suppliers that makes it clear
that any harassment will not be tolerated. Also, include the antiharassment
policy in the contract with independent contractors when people will be
coming onto your property to work.
Make sure that the policy addresses both sides. For instance, encourage
any supplier employee who is harassed by anyone in your department to
promptly report it. Warning: Because of the seriousness of the situation and
its legal implications, do not try to resolve the problem yourself (unless that
happens to be the company policy).
Become familiar with the ADA’s Title III requirements.
In many cases, pur-
chasing professionals arrange remodeling or similar work to be done on the
company site. Therefore, you also must be aware of the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act’s (ADA) Title III provisions.
824
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

Essentially, if a company is a commercial enterprise, it is required to
“make sure that any new construction complies with the detailed physical
speciﬁcations of barrier removal contained in the Act.” And the emphasis is
on the word “detailed.” 
Therefore, purchasers should make sure that contracts for construction
work are reviewed by someone within the company or by an outside con-
sultant who is knowledgeable of the speciﬁcations and can ensure that the
provisions meet those detailed requirements.
Are you responsible for your supplier’s compliance with equal employment opportunity
laws?
It depends. If you are purchasing under a government contract, de-
pending on its size, you have a legal obligation to get a representation from
the supplier that they do not discriminate. You might even have to get ad-
ditional representation that they also have an afﬁrmative action program to
hire and promote minorities.
However, in “purely commercial” procurement, there is no legal re-
sponsibility to “police” the equal employment opportunity compliance or
fair employment practices of the suppliers. Nevertheless, purchasers should
exercise some caution here, too—especially where a supplier may be em-
ploying illegal immigrants in this country, or a foreign supplier who is abus-
ing child labor.
One suggestion offered by Purchaser’s Legal Adviser is to include provi-
sions in your contract to the general effect that the supplier agrees to com-
ply with all fair employment laws. The intent is to have negotiation leverage
in this kind of situation rather than to actually use it to police supplier com-
pliance.
Extending the “drug-free workplace” to independent contractors.
The behavior of
the employees of independent contractors working on company property is
a legitimate concern for purchasing professionals. In general, there are three
options that can be taken, according to the publication:
1. Do nothing. A purely commercial entity having no government con-
tracts and no other special factors can probably get away without addressing
drugs in the workplace in independent contractor agreements. 
2. Include a speciﬁc provision. It should state that the contractor under-
stands that the company has a drug-free workplace, that no drugs can be
brought onto company premises, and that no one under the inﬂuence of
Insights from the Pros

drugs can be sent to work on the premises. The prevalent thinking is that
this is a far better approach than doing nothing.
3. Be explicit. This requires a certiﬁcation from the contractor that it also
has a drug-testing program and that all employees it sends to your facility will
have passed a drug test.

The supplier scorecard has proven to be the deﬁning tool for many pur-
chasing managers navigating the transition from transactional to strategic
planning (though it has its drawbacks—see sidebar). Where other supplier
performance measurements fail because of narrow scope, poor communica-
tion, and the like, the scorecard provides a comprehensive and consistent ap-
proach to ongoing improvements. 
The anatomy of the scorecard.
“The scorecard should be a compilation of sup-
plier-to-buyer transactions or events that have been individually coded based
on mutually established measurement methods,” explains William S. Wehr,
CPM, director of quality systems at Lewis-Goetz and Company, Inc. (Pitts-
burgh; 412-341-7100). Included in the scorecard, he maintains, is the time
period covered, total number of transactions, total number of conforming
and nonconforming transactions, and an indication of current performance
relative to the goal.
“All scorecard elements should be included on the agenda for all re-
view meetings to permit discussion and understanding of performance
trends,” Wehr said at a recent NAPM Annual International Purchasing
Conference.
Meanwhile, R. David Nelson, vice president of worldwide supply man-
agement at Deere & Company (Moline, Ill; dn49010@deere.com), who
calls his program “Achieving Excellence,” has the scorecard focus on supplier
ratings for quality, delivery, warranty, and cost management. “In addition, it
has a ‘wavelength’ rating, which is a subjective measure,” he noted at a re-
cent Annual Strategic Sourcing Management Conference (Institute for In-
ternational Research; New York). The wavelength rating relates to the sup-
plier’s responsiveness, technical support, and attitude, as determined by
Deere’s employees.

The power of the scorecard.
Margaret (Peggy) A. Williams, CPM, director of
procurement at Compaq Computers, Inc. (Cupertino, Calif.; williams_
peggy@compaq.com), declares, “The supplier scorecard is the process that
moved us from a tactical organization to a strategic one.” As an example, she
notes that her staff was previously 100% tactical and was achieving about 2%
in annual cost reductions. Since implementing the supplier performance
program, with scorecard, her staff is about 40% strategic, and annual cost sav-
ings are in the double digits. 
Joseph V. Joy, vice president of business and supplier development at
Solectron (West Columbia, S.C.; joejoy@sc.slr.com), maintains, “It’s almost
less important what the scorecard is, but it’s essential to have one with your
Insights from the Pros
827
The Downside of Report Cards
Granted, the beneﬁts of a report card program outweigh the negatives. How-
ever, before embarking on a scorecard initiative, Williams suggests looking at
some of the negatives. For instance:
•
The scorecard takes time to develop and sustain. “I like to do things in baby
steps,” she notes. “At ﬁrst, we only took a couple of suppliers and did the
scorecard in a pilot form. As we gained experience, we expanded it to a couple
more, and a couple more.”
•
Many statistics are manually developed. “While most of the data can be
attained automatically, you’ll ﬁnd that there’s a volume that cannot be auto-
mated, especially the subjective ratings.”
•
Methodology changes are difﬁcult to implement and bridge. “We change our
methodology frequently, probably two times a year, sometimes three,” Wil-
liam explains. “But we let the suppliers know we’re making the change and
merge them into the change.” One tactic she has found successful when mak-
ing changes is maintaining two scorecards for a short period. “In this manner
we show the supplier what their report card is under the new methodology
and what it would have been with the former process.”
•
Pulling quarterly meetings together is challenging. “Scheduling everybody
can be a problem,” she concedes. At Compaq, for instance, the supplier score-
card quarterly management reviews are attended by a cross-functional group.
Representatives include the commodity manager, purchasing and quality
manager, development engineer, and manufacturing engineer. Also, the di-
rector of quality and supplier management, the supplier quality engineer and
buyer, customer engineering, and the manufacturing vice president.

strategic suppliers. It enables you to meet with them, go through the issues,
and let them know you are there for them.” 
Compaq’s supplier scorecard totals 100 points and considers two primary elements.
The broad scorecard elements are service, support, quality, and reliability.
However, within each is a more detailed listing of measures. For instance,
under support and service, suppliers are measured on factors such as on-time
delivery, lead-time reduction, ﬂexibility, value-added contribution (pri-
marily engineering support), receiving discrepancies, and responsiveness.
Within quality and reliability are product quality performance, reliability,
sustained performance, and quality management system.
Solectron’s initiative part of continuous improvement process.
The Supplier Val-
ued Added performance measurement tool is used by Solectron’s supply base
management group to “improve the performance and value-added by our
suppliers,” explains Joy. The elements of the SVA scorecard (see Figure III-
1.23) include quality/reliability, delivery/ﬂexibility, technology, price, and
service.
“We use data to manage the supply line process,” he maintains. “A
monthly report card is developed that includes ﬁve key metrics for each pre-
ferred supplier.” These 32 suppliers, he notes, represent 80% of the com-
pany’s incoming needs. “Solectron SBM focuses its attention on those ‘vital
few’ suppliers that account for the highest dollar value received or the high-

est return to our customers,” Joy explains. “We depend on these preferred
suppliers to consistently provide us with the highest standard of quality and
on-time delivery performance.”
Focus on key suppliers.
Compaq’s Williams notes, “With the scorecard we’re
talking about the high-level supplier. The suppliers we measure are the pre-
ferred and strategic suppliers.” Obviously, due to time and other restraints, a
report card cannot, and should not, be maintained for every supplier. She
further reveals, “Our supplier scorecard measures major business and per-
formance elements over time. That’s the most important thing. I don’t care
where the supplier starts on the scorecard; what I care about is what trend
they have.”
The process also promotes continuous improvement.
As Joy relates, “We provide
a balanced scorecard for measuring performance and for regularly commu-
nicating status as well as our expectations and goals to strategic and key sup-
pliers.” As evidence, he points to some results of the program. 
The average SVA score increased from 53 to 86 over a two-year period.
Further, three suppliers, accounting for 32% of what Solectron Systems En-
gineering and Services spend, achieved ratings above 90. Expanding on this,
Williams explains that the scorecard also provides a forum for setting goals
and celebrating achievements. 
The report card provides a visual method of communications, especially to manage-
ment.
“Our scorecard gives the procurement function visibility with up-
per management, about what we’re doing, and how we’re helping the cus-
tomer,” Williams describes. In fact, at the quarterly supplier review, Compaq
executives meet with the top management representatives of these key sup-
plier companies. 
Similarly, Joy mentions that the executive supplier review is held with
the Solectron executive team and the executive team from each of the
preferred suppliers. “The main purpose of the executive supplier review
is to provide an executive level forum to discuss the overall business rela-
tionship in the context of TCO and mutual competitiveness,” he de-
scribes.
As a ﬁnal note, Williams says, “The scorecard process is really evolu-
tionary. It’s always changing. We’re always revising it, and we’re always rais-
ing the bar.”

Traditionally, purchasing has been associated with managing supplier rela-
tionships. For a growing number of companies, however, it is becoming a
supplier of services for its own set of customers. Today, many purchasing
professionals emphasize the satisfaction of their internal customers while
seeking feedback on their performance. 
How are we doing?
The recent Annual Strategic Sourcing Management
Conference (Institute for International Research; New York) provided
timely examples of this trend, as well as useful tips for those who want to get
on board. Ronald D. Casbon, CPM, general manager of purchasing and
transportation at Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Bethlehem, Pa.; rdcasbon@
bethsteel.com) shares, “Every year we conduct a survey of all our key clients
throughout the corporation.” The purpose, he stated, is to “provide feed-
back on how we’re doing, what we should change, and how we can improve
our performance.”
Similarly, Mark S. Miller, CPM, CIRM, purchasing manager (Mmiller
@Casecorp.com), and Steven R. Fogle, CPM, purchasing team leader
(Sfogle@Casecorp.com), Case Corporation (Racine, Wis.), describe the
tactics they use to improve the “customer focus of our purchasing depart-
ment.” They are to
• Establish common customer service goals. “We have established common
customer service goals for everyone in the company based on customer ser-
vice index,” they described at a recent NAPM Annual International Pur-
chasing Conference. The customer service index is based on customer sur-
veys that are done continuously to measure “how we’re doing in the
customer’s eye.”
• Establish a process organization. “We have established a process versus a
functional organization,” they maintain. One solution was the formation of
cross-functional teams with the charter to improve processes. Also, they
consolidated some functional areas to form work teams using a matrix ap-
proach. “For example, we combined purchasing, inventory control, and ex-
pediting into material control teams,” Miller and Fogle describe. “Forming
teams to improve processes and combining functional groups into teams are
good ways to improve customer focus,” they agree.

• Get out and talk with customers. “To better serve the customers you ﬁrst
must meet and understand their needs,” they declare. “Hold meetings with
your internal customers and identify areas that can be improved. Then form
cross-functional teams to improve the processes you have identiﬁed,” they
insist. At Case, they hold monthly meetings with their internal customers to
review the results of the process teams and to identify new areas of oppor-
tunity.
• Include suppliers in the process. “We involve our suppliers in customer
service, too,” Miller and Fogle explain. “Each time we meet with suppliers
we explain how we measure customer service and show how they can con-
tribute to our customer satisfaction.”
• Move away from the transactional. At Merck & Co., Inc. (Rahway, N.J.),
purchasing moved into a different direction. According to Jennifer L. Hunt,
manager of Rahway procurement (huntjenn@merck.com), purchasing pros
moved from a transactional focus to one that is strategic. This involved a
change in many former existing practices and philosophies, and the imple-
mentation of new technology. But above all, she told a recent Annual Per-
formance Measurement for the Purchasing Function Conference (Institute
for International Research; New York), “We want our ‘stakeholders’ to look
at us as supplying value, not in just cost savings, but also in the service we
provide.” A tool they use to evaluate just how well they are perceived is a
procurement customer satisfaction survey. 
• Ask procurement’s customers for input. At Merck’s Rahway facility, of the
4,500 employees at the site, more than 2,200 are procurement “customers.”
About 1,000 end users were randomly selected to receive the ﬁrst survey
conducted at the site. Its focus was to determine how the client base viewed
purchasing’s service, skills and knowledge, values, principles, and systems, in
terms of satisfaction and importance. There also was a provision for the re-
spondent to offer general comments as to the activities’ strengths and weak-
nesses. Using the company intranet, each was asked to ﬁll in all of the ﬁelds
in the survey. In addition to the example, the survey asked for personal in-
formation (name), and demographics (how often do you use procurement
services, which of the global procurement services have you taken advantage
of in the past six months, and which commodities are most of your transac-
tions with; also site location, division, and type of procurement system typ-
ically used).
• Provide feedback to the customers as well. One of the major failings of a
customer satisfaction survey is that the results are compiled and procurement

fails to take action on the responses, or they don’t even share the details and
comments of the survey. Not so with Merck. In fact, the reason Merck re-
quires respondents to identify themselves is to provide them with a copy of
the survey results. Similarly, Casbon also shares the survey results with the
respondents. “Every employee who participates in the survey has the bene-
ﬁt of feedback that we receive across the company.” In fact, the survey re-
sults are put on display at Bethlehem Steel. “If there are things that we’re not
measuring up on, and need to be addressed, it’s up to us to address them,”
Casbon states emphatically.

There’s been a ﬂurry of activity surrounding the formation and operation of
the supply chain. Little initiative, however, has been focused on helping pur-
chasing professionals to assess their current status and plan for the advance-
ment of supply chain activity. But help is at hand.
Transform Your Supply Chain: Releasing Value in Business (International
Thomson Business Press) offers a practical approach to developing and ap-
plying supply chain management strategies.
How to measure your supply chain’s present state.
What especially impressed us
was the comprehensive supply chain audit outlined in the book. Clearly
identifying business priorities and supply chain initiatives—it provides all
the information that supply chain practitioners, managers, and executives
need to benchmark their present performance (see Figure III-1.24). 
The information can also be used to map improvement implementation
or to identify the next level of supply chain initiative. For instance, a busi-
ness focus we highlight (see Table III-1.10) concerns “developing relational
competence.” Within the category, there are 10 “levers of change” to con-
sider, along with four audit questions that, when answered, provide an ex-
cellent guide for what steps to take.
The authors ( Jon Hughes, Mark Ralf, and Bill Michels) have established
the necessary credentials through their experience in developing and apply-
ing supply chain strategies in over 30 countries worldwide. The lessons they
have learned are shared in this book. Hughes is senior partner, Wind-
sor Foundation for Business Development; Ralf is group purchasing and

Supply chain management is the purchasing profession’s, maybe even the in-
dustry’s, most discussed, analyzed, and practiced philosophy. While some
practitioners merely adopt the supply chain management banner, focusing
only on fundamental activities, purchasing’s leaders and visionaries seize the
opportunity to extend their scope of responsibility and achieve increasingly
sophisticated supplier management.
Redeﬁne your role in the supply chain management philosophy.
The ongoing
question purchasing professionals wrestle with is, “How far can I go?” The
parameters are not easy to deﬁne.
For instance, Timothy L. Ortel, CPIM, new products materials project
manager, Applied Komatsu Technology, declares, “Suppliers can make or
break supply chains.” He pointed out at a recent APICS Annual Interna-
tional Conference, “As higher percentages (up to 80%) of direct cost origi-
nate outside the enterprise, careful supplier selection early in product devel-
opment enables repeatable supply chain success.” This is clearly an extension
of the traditional purchasing responsibility.
In addition, Walter J. Pietrak, CFPIM, internal consultant, North Ameri-
can MRPII development team, Procter & Gamble, believes that “supply
chain management is not a stand-alone process, and is much more than just
procurement.”
Creation of extended supply chain linkages.
Michael Katzorke, sees a “grow-
ing number of increasingly strong linkages between buyers and their suppli-
ers.” Katzorke, who designed and initiated the supply chain management
rollout as director of materials at AlliedSignal before moving to Cessna Air-
craft as vice president of material, lists the following examples of extended
purchasing responsibility:

• Suppliers are now managing the inventory of their products at their
customers’ facilities.
• Direct computer-to-computer interfaces of MRP-generated re-
quirements and supply data are becoming common between buyers and sup-
pliers.
• The whole just-in-time and efﬁcient consumer response movements
require direct linkages from customers to suppliers.
• Some companies ask key suppliers to place planners and others into
their plants and facilities to ensure that the suppliers are knowledgeable
about their needs. 
• Receiving inspection at the buyer’s facility has been replaced by pro-
cess control at the suppliers’s locations.
Move beyond the primary supply base.
Leading companies such as Harley-
Davidson are advancing toward Tier 2 and 3 suppliers—“their supplier’s
suppliers.” It’s an attempt, says Leroy Zimdars, CPM, director of develop-
ment purchasing, to include and align them to become a value-added part
of the supply chain.
Meanwhile, Portland State University’s Lee Buddress, CPM, and Alan
Raedels, CPM, explain that one large multinational ﬁrm observed that many
of the suppliers in its third tier and below were not even aware that they were
suppliers to the multinational.
Virtually all agree that there is a deﬁnite need for the purchasing profes-
sional to move further up the linkage in the supply chain and work with
these suppliers as well. And many probably do need the direction as they are
smaller and have fewer resources. 
As Buddress and Raedels observe, “Leading-edge practitioners are in-
creasingly concerned with their suppliers’ suppliers, processes, and systems.
In fact, they tell of one electronics manufacturer that has a 15-person group
within the purchasing organization whose sole function it is to evaluate and
improve lower-tier suppliers.
Purchasing professionals can inﬂuence movement of goods throughout the chain, too.
Another key consideration is addressing supply chain coordination re-
quired to move goods and products throughout the supply chain. “Trans-
portation coordination and management is becoming as much of a supply
chain management issue as are lower tier suppliers,” the Portland State duo
declare.
836
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

“Minimizing suppliers of transportation services the same way we have
done for product suppliers” is one suggestion they offer. Further, by “di-
recting the coordination of supply chain processes from the OEM level,
supply chain costs decrease and collective efﬁciencies increase.”
Supply chain communication.
If, via EDI or other electronic or Internet
means, information can be made to ﬂow more accurately and efﬁciently, an
OEM’s order to its ﬁrst tier supplier for subassemblies is disaggregated by the
supplier’s computer. Purchased parts are automatically ordered by the ﬁrst
tier supplier’s computer from the second tier’s. Similar disaggregation ﬂows
the many orders down through multiple levels of the supply base. This can
be done in minutes without the data entry steps at each level that often cre-
ate errors. 
Avoid becoming the supply chain’s weak link.
“When a company has poor cus-
tomer service, it becomes the weak link,” declares James P. Knechtges, di-
rector of purchasing at Impact Products, Inc. “When a company is not prof-
itable in the supply chain, at any customer or supplier level, it becomes a
weak link.” 
Cash ﬂow, cycle times, poor quality, inventory, excessive transportation
costs, and poor communication can all create weak links in the supply
chains, notes Charles A. Watts, CPIM, John Carroll University (Cleveland),
copresenter with Knechtges at APICS. “The more positive impact small
businesses can have on improving these processes, the better off they will
be,” he offers. “Small businesses can take advantage of a number of tech-
niques and breakthroughs in supply chain management.”
Where small companies can ﬁt in the supply chain equation.
Knechtges and
Watts have developed a matrix of potential supply chain relationships (see
Figure III-1.25). In quadrant one, for instance, powerful supply chain mem-
bers, whether manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers, often force their will
on suppliers and customers.
This quadrant is the worst one for small companies to be in because they
are at the mercy of the more powerful members and because relationships
do not matter. In quadrant two, there is a more long-term relationship as the
controlling supply chain leader recognizes the need for selecting suppliers
for a longer term based on their capabilities. This is a better quadrant for
smaller businesses, as long as they are continually improving and satisfying
the supply chain leader.

Smaller companies do better in a cooperative relationship.
In quadrant three, se-
lection of the supply chain member is based on value, which includes price,
quality, and service. In these supply chains, members will commit resources
to help improve those who may need to improve technical or managerial ca-
pability.
A small business that can willingly function in quadrant three will even-
tually move into the fourth quad. Most chains follow an evolutionary step
that begins in quadrant three and ends in four, Knechtges and Watts observe.
And small companies that are ﬂexible with speciﬁc capabilities will survive
in this quad. “The reason that supply chains in quadrant four are the most
successful is that it allows ﬁrms to truly coordinate their activities,” accord-
ing to Knechtges and Watts.

Purchasing professionals have been aggressively reducing their supplier base
for a decade. Many of the initiatives have achieved such astounding success
that the activity still remains a top priority in most organizations, large and
small alike. Recent Supplier Selection and Management Report reader surveys
ﬁnd that almost half of the respondents are still working in this area.
More responsible reductions through innovative approaches.
Routinely, the re-
spondents provide us with descriptions of their methodologies as well as
their results:
• “We had 25 PCB [prototype circuit board] suppliers but have re-
duced the number to only ﬁve and have realized a cost savings in excess of
15%,” reports a materials director at a large assembler of electronic assem-
blies.
• “We not only consolidated our supplier base but also entered into
longer-term agreements with the suppliers to give us leverage for greater
yearly costs savings,” explains a purchasing manager at a small manufacturer
of medical devices.
• “Our focus on reducing the supplier base includes combining pur-
chases from multiple plants, establishing longer term contracts with fewer
840

MRO suppliers, and using price indexes with raw material suppliers,” a pur-
chasing manager at a midsize producer of carpet backing describes.
Others developed programs and established practices that were ingen-
ious. 
Consolidate 240 MRO suppliers into only one.
“We implemented a supplier-
managed in-plant store for designated categories of MRO materials that re-
sulted in an annual cost reduction of $100,000,” maintains a manager of cor-
porate purchasing at a midsize manufacturer of temperature sensing devices.
This action also eliminated the processing of 6,200 annual transactions re-
lated to POs, receipts, and invoices. 
Realize price reductions up to 30%.
“It’s not uncommon to see price reduc-
tions from a supplier consolidation process,” agrees a purchasing director at
a large producer of industrial ﬂow control equipment and systems. “How-
ever, we’ve also seen an improvement in service levels from being a national
account and in many cases are receiving value-added services and assistance
in implementing best practices.” The supplier reduction process was under
the direction of commodity teams, members of which were appointed by
the CEO and division presidents. “Their responsibility was to develop the
selected suppliers,” he maintains.
Create an entirely new process.
A resource specialist at a major management
consultant ﬁrm shares that they went to work on their own supplier base, es-
pecially for ofﬁce supplies. “We gathered data on the total number of sup-
pliers we used in each category, selected new suppliers, sent out RFQs [re-
quests for quotes] and invited potential suppliers in for a workshop,” she
explains. Finalists were then selected from which the eventual supplier was
chosen. “We consolidated the spend with the newly selected supplier while
also instituting rules for compliance and have realized savings in excess of
15%,” she details.
Share manufacturing resource planning (MRP) data with the supply base.
A pur-
chasing manager at a midsize producer of disposable medical supplies ex-
plains that they have “balanced their purchasing from a reduced supplier base
while still ensuring a consistent supply of material.” 
Major suppliers, she relates, “now receive their own copies of the MRP
for a rolling six-month horizon.” The suppliers now can commit for raw
IOMA Readers Report What Works
841

materials and produce in one- to two-month requirements. “This process
now reduces their inventory levels, and ours, which also reduces the likeli-
hood of obsolescence and enables the suppliers to produce in mutually
agreed upon EOQs [economic order quantities],” she maintains. 
Educate ﬁrst, reduce base next.
The purchasing director at a large producer of
ductile iron pipes, valves, and ﬁttings concedes that cultural barriers and
prior performance of the purchasing department originally made it difﬁcult
to even think about reducing the supplier base. “Two years ago we began a
massive teaching effort discussing the concepts of and the pros and cons in-
volved with supplier selection, relationships, and alliances,” he explains.
“We still have a few problems in some locations with who controls the
supply base, but we’re making headway.”
Recently, he shares, “We’ve been providing the consolidated supply
base with our production plans and schedules, and have saved from 5% to
15%, depending on the commodity. Where we’ve had the opportunity to
trim the number of suppliers, we’ve also experienced better delivery perfor-
mance and reduced stockouts through better communications and cooper-
ation,” he maintains. “This has made an impression on those few sites that
are still holding out, and they’re now starting to come around.”
Switch to distributors and move away from a “standard” supplier/manufacturer base.
“On-time/complete [OT/C] is probably the most important metric we
hold our suppliers to,” explains the purchasing vice president at a large
builder of “vertical” transportation equipment and systems. “If suppliers are
not OT/C, our costs associated with delays can soar.”
The company has 60 U.S. locations, and the most successful technique
has been switching to distributors for some goods. “We now utilize a key
electrical distributor in lieu of nearly 500 electrical products companies that
we had been using,” he cites as an example. “Savings are realized not only in
single invoicing, volume discounts, and similar matters, but also throughout
our branches, which now can focus on their core business rather than seek-
ing supply solutions to their electrical needs.”
Breaking prior relationships is hard to do.
The director of purchasing at a ma-
jor builder of residential furniture realized that the supplier base had become
too large and that the existing buyers “were not on top and really in control
of the selection process.” They began a program to leverage the buy of top
raw material purchases by reducing the number of suppliers. “Quite frankly,
842
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

the prior relationships established by some of the divisions were hard to
break for this program to be successful,” he explains. 
“In fact, our senior management had to step in and take a ﬁrm stance
and make a commitment to support us in this endeavor.” Once done, the re-
sistance began to fade, albeit very slowly. “With fewer suppliers we were able
to realize better pricing, have them agree to consigned inventory, rebates,
and 60 day terms with discounts,” he explains.
Increase leverage with a smaller number of suppliers.
“We maintain a quality in-
dex of supplier performance,” explains a materials manager at a small pro-
ducer of lawn and garden tools. “Obviously, defective parts cannot be used
even if on time and economically priced.”
This became the primary tool for evaluating the supplier base when
the decision was made to review it with an eye on cutting the number of
suppliers with which they do business. “For those that successfully passed
our scrutiny, we increased the volume of business we gave them, to im-
prove our leverage,” he explains. “The increased volume made our ‘pack-
ages’ much more attractive to them, which also allowed our suppliers to
take advantage of economies of scale and long-term planning,” he declares.
“In fact, they began a similar program with their suppliers, also, to all of
our benefit.”
Lowering total supply chain costs also an achievement.
The materials manager at
a large manufacturer of sensors reveals that they undertook and realized
complete supply chain integration of demands from the customer through
to the second and third tiers of suppliers. 
“This added value by freeing up our buyers to spend more time sourc-
ing, selecting, and negotiating cost reductions,” he explains. “It also led to
the rationalization and consolidation of our supply base, with the remaining
suppliers receiving increased volumes of orders, which in turn lowered the
prices we paid.”

Reducing the supplier base has become a double-edged sword for many
purchasing professionals. While it is still considered a primary best practice
by a large bloc of Supplier Selection and Management Report readers (41.8%
IOMA Readers Report What Works
843

according to our latest survey), others (20.8%) list it as their biggest challenge
(see sidebar).
And many work to surmount the problem.
Internal and external forces are
working against supplier consolidation, readers report. Yet the advantages of
a smaller supplier base greatly outweigh the negatives, forcing purchasing
professionals to continue on.
As an example, the procurement director at a leading maker of refriger-
ators acknowledges, “Supply base rationalization was a major obstacle in our
drive toward strategic improvements. However, through measurement and
high visibility, we have been able to reduce our supply base by more than
50% in the last 12-month period,” he explains.
The beneﬁts of optimization are real.
In another example, the purchasing di-
rector at a midsize producer of industrial ﬂow control equipment remarks,
844
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T
Why Reducing the Supplier Base Is a Problem
Overwhelmingly, readers responding to the open-ended question cite the
“special” relationship between the end user and the supplier.
For example, the purchasing redesign director at a large chemical manu-
facturer anguishes, “We are nowhere close to resolving our objective of re-
ducing the supplier base. The biggest barrier that we continually encounter is
the established relationship between the end user and the supplier.”
Similarly, the purchasing vice president at a midsize manufacturer of elec-
trical components offers, “How do you tell a supplier with whom you’ve dealt
with for many years and have a special relationship that it’s over? It’s the most
difﬁcult decision we must make, and the hardest to deliver.”
A global commodity team with the task of optimizing the supply base
was thought to be the answer at a producer of shocks and suspension systems
for automobiles. However, the purchasing director explains, “We formed
teams in select areas and included representatives from each business group to
review products, supplier performance, and other parameters. Yet, we still
have some sites steadfastly hanging on to their local suppliers instead,” she
complains.
The most unique response came from the executive vice president at a
midsize metals service center. He ﬁnds “most suppliers are ‘niche-ing’ them-
selves more and more, which makes it difﬁcult, if not impossible, to get every-
thing from only one or two suppliers.”

“It’s not uncommon to see 20% to 30% price reductions from supplier con-
solidations. We’ve also experienced improved service levels, received several
value-added services, and gained major assistance in implementing best
practices,” he notes.
What leading purchasing professionals are doing to optimize their supplier base.
To
their credit, procurement professionals are not of the slash-and-dash school
of supplier reduction. Instead, according to our poll and their unaided re-
sponses, much study and analysis go into making the decision. And the meth-
odology is often creative. For example, the purchasing director at a midsize
manufacturer of extruded products introduced a “new approach to buying:
initiating a supply chain program and focusing resources on fewer suppliers.”
They formed cross-functional teams, made wish lists, met with suppliers,
and visited supplier sites.
“We conducted very structured negotiations and awarded multiyear
supply agreements,” he reports. The savings have gone beyond 20%, and a
“signiﬁcant amount of administrative time also has been removed,” he notes.
Consolidating multisite requirements.
One of the more popular approaches is
the attempt to consolidate the needs and requirements of various plant loca-
tions and individual divisions, located both domestically and internationally.
“We consolidated the commodity spend information from six domestic
manufacturing facilities and used this information to reduce the supply base
to a single source,” reports the division purchasing manager at a large maker
of electrical circuit protection devices. The ﬁrst commodity completed was
chipboard. On a $2 million spend, they achieved a 46% cost reduction.
Work is now actively focused on corrugated cartons, fasteners, and solder
and screw machine parts.
Instituting a supplier-managed in-plant store program.
A corporate purchasing
manager at a large producer of lawn and garden equipment consolidated 240
suppliers of MRO material into one. “We implemented a supplier-
managed, in-plant store program for designated categories of MRO,” he re-
lates. This action resulted in annual savings of $100,000 and eliminated more
than 6,200 annual transactions relating to POs, receipts, and invoices.
Increasing leverage with fewer suppliers.
“Our most successful strategy over the
past year was the reduction of the supplier base,” says the materials manager
at a small maker of household appliances. “By increasing our volume with
IOMA Readers Report What Works
8 4 5
TEAMFLY
Team-Fly® 

fewer suppliers, we also were able to improve the leverage we had with
them.” He relates, “This increase in volume made us much more attractive
as a customer, and enabled our suppliers to take advantage of the economies
of scale and long-term planning.”
Entering into long-term agreements.
“We once had 26 PCB suppliers, and
have reduced them to only ﬁve,” reports the director of materials at a large
computer components manufacturer. “Our savings are upwards of 15% and
were achieved by entering into a major renegotiation based on the expanded
volume and a longer-term contract.”
“Longer-term agreements with fewer suppliers deﬁnitely gives us much
more leverage in dealing with the supplier base,” agrees a purchasing man-
ager at a midsize maker of medical devices. “We’ve also been able to imple-
ment performance measures for yearly cost savings, and have the advantage
of fewer POs and invoices, besides.”
“We’ve rationalized our supply base to increase volume for the remain-
ing suppliers, which has reduced our total cost,” maintains a materials man-
ager at a large producer of sensors. “Fewer suppliers enable us to strengthen
our remaining partnerships, and the improved leverage enables us to demand
additional improvements in quality and lower overall supply chain costs.”

For the sixth consecutive year, “reducing the supplier base” tops the list of
practices that Supplier Selection and Management Report readers say have been
most effective for controlling costs. Most impressive is the staying power of
this practice. Not only is supply base rationalization the only one to draw a
majority of the response this year (53.2%), but its popularity continues to
grow, as it widened its margin over the runner-up practice (renegotiated ex-
isting supplier contracts) to six percentage points—the largest spread to date.
Why supplier base rationalization remains a top practice.
One reader explains it
best: “Our procurement infrastructure could not support the multitude of
continuous improvement initiatives without a dedicated process to rational-
ize our current supply base,” declares the purchasing director at a major
manufacturer of consumer appliances.
“Our procurement center identiﬁed the issue of supply base rationaliza-
846
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

tion and subsequently formalized it within our strategic procurement plan,”
he describes. The plan is known by an acronym denoting the number of sup-
pliers they intend to have corporate-wide and the quality level they antici-
pate the reduced supply base to achieve. “We have realized tremendous op-
portunities and beneﬁts that directly correlate to the supply base reduction
process.” 
Consistency marks top six best practices.
It is apparent that readers retain a high
degree of loyalty to the practices that work best for them. The top six (see
Table III-2.1) have been the same (although their relative positions—two
through six—change year to year) since we launched the ﬁrst reader survey
in the early 1990s. Examples of comments we received relative to the run-
ners-up include this: “For us, renegotiating existing supplier contracts have
saved a substantial amount of money, estimated at $400,000 for the ﬁrst two
quarters of 1998,” explains a purchasing engineering manager at a midsize
manufacturer of printing ink.
Readers are also tough on price increases.
For instance, a purchasing manager
at a midsize die caster shares, “We notiﬁed suppliers that price increases
would not be accepted. In cases where suppliers forced an increase, the item
went back out for quoting. This usually resulted in an alternate or new sup-
plier that either lowered cost, gave us better terms, or maintained minimal
price increases,” she details. 
A decided shift to foreign suppliers.
Despite year-to-year consistency, we ap-
plaud our purchasing professional readership for a sense of dynamics among
the practices they introduce each year. For instance, the practice that showed
the greatest year-to-year gain is “global sourcing.” We have reported on this
activity, and anecdotal evidence continues to build about domestic buyers
moving offshore to foreign suppliers. 
However, our surveys just did not indicate signiﬁcant movement in this
arena. In fact, only two years ago, a mere 4.9% of the respondents said that
they were sourcing offshore. Last year it more than doubled to 10.2%. This
year, foreign sourcing soared to 18.3% of the audience. A surprise, however,
is that the activity is being “driven” by respondents in the small and midsize
companies (18.9%) by a slight margin over their larger counterparts (17.8%).
Typical responses among those moving to foreign suppliers include the
director of procurement at a large maker of motion control products. “We
shifted domestic procurement of an item offshore, and in the ﬁrst year alone

we realized a 56% net savings, that is, after freight, duties, and start-up costs,”
he shares.
Similarly, a procurement manager at a midsize service provider tells of
“a cost savings of almost 40% within one material category since shopping
among offshore suppliers.”
A renewed look at supplier quality and certiﬁcation.
One particular result in the
survey heartens us. It is in the “resurgence” of boosting supplier quality ini-
tiatives. For instance, supplier certiﬁcation was cited by almost one in ﬁve
(18.3%) respondents. This is more than a 70% improvement over last year’s
response. Additionally, efforts to improve supplier quality moved up 21%, to
24.8%.
As an example of what is happening in the quality improvement area, a
senior buyer at a small manufacturer of electronic test equipment shares,
“During the past year or two, we have been implementing a series of activ-
ities, but the one that’s been the most successful has been in improving sup-
plier quality. We’ve also undertaken an intensive process of qualifying sup-
pliers with the capabilities required of our most intricate parts.”
Supply chain management practices making rapid strides.
This year’s reader sur-
vey ﬁnds respondents making a greater push in initiating total supply chain
management performance activities. Almost one in ﬁve (18.8%) participants
say that they are making the effort, which represents the largest response to
date.
This is up an impressive 55% over last year’s result. As expected, this ac-
tivity is deﬁnitely being driven by the respondents in larger companies. For
example, a purchasing manager at a large producer of baked goods explains,
“We have focused on developing the supply chain as there are a lot of dol-
lars wasted in hidden costs and redundancy that are just being uncovered.
From our initial efforts we know that there are many more opportunities
that will be realized as we reﬁne the supply chain.”
Purchasing card (P-card) draws well in its initial appearance.
In previous years,
readers, unaided, frequently mentioned the application of P-cards as a suc-
cessful method of controlling costs. It had reached a level where we believed
it should be listed as a separate item on the questionnaire.
In its debut among 25 cost control practices, almost 15% of the partici-
pants cited P-cards as one practice that they successfully employed. This is
indeed an impressive ﬁrst-time showing, and it bodes well for the future.
IOMA Readers Report What Works
849

Two responses, in particular, made an impression about P-card practice.
A man-
ager of procurement and sourcing at a midsize producer of eyewear prod-
ucts and supplies offers, “We had a global roll-out of the P-card, in the U.S.,
Europe, and Asia. Already we’ve realized a reduction approaching 40% in
purchasing and accounts payable transactions. We’ve also eliminated non-
value-added activities and have reassigned some of our resources to other
cost savings teams,” she details.
The group vice president at a midsize producer of replacement parts also
launched a P-card program during the year. “This has improved lead times
and reduced paperwork that in turn has reduced time in purchasing, ac-
counts payable, and in our support groups,” he explains.
Two signiﬁcant practices not faring as well as might be expected.
We may be ex-
tremely critical, but we anticipate that a couple of related practices will re-
ceive a lot more attention, according to our reportage and discussions with
purchasing professionals throughout the year.
One is the activity of cross-functional teams (which is holding around
the 20% response level, after a drop-off from the mid-30s two years ago).
The other is involving the supplier earlier in the design process. Since ﬁrst
including this practice in the survey three years ago, and despite all the rhet-
oric, it has not made any signiﬁcant movement from the upper teens.
Yet those who practice one or both are impressed.
For example, a purchasing
manager at a small manufacturer of telecom monitoring systems shares,
“Since we began involving suppliers early in the design process, we’ve been
able to avoid designing in costly processes and materials. We include the sup-
pliers in our concept and design reviews as we consider them an extension
of our design team.”
The senior director of materials management and purchasing at a gov-
ernment agency ﬁnds value in using cross-functional teams. “Since we es-
tablished cross-functional teams, we have been better able to focus on spe-
ciﬁc inventory/supply problems which affect end users, accounts payable
functions, procurement, and suppliers. Some teams are product-speciﬁc,
some department-speciﬁc, and others, supplier-speciﬁc. All groups focus on
the desired results and bottom-line cost issues,” he details.
In review, what we may be seeing in the results from the latest reader
study may actually be the threshold to a new era of some very new and in-
teresting practices taking hold in supplier management.

Within the purchasing community, experts are working diligently to deter-
mine not only the right suppliers with whom to do business but also the op-
timum number to include. This is borne out by the priority that purchasing
management continues to give to its supplier base optimization initiatives. 
For the past six years, Supplier Selection and Management Report surveys
consistently found that supplier base consolidation ranks as the number one
focus of readers. And since the NAPM began asking its members two years
ago, they also concur that optimizing the supply base is their top strategic
initiative.
Moving beyond purchase price considerations is the new objective.
There is still a
fair amount of purchasers who are reducing their supply base just to gain
price leverage. And that motivation will always remain. However, the lead-
ers of the profession have moved beyond price into new vistas. More than
half (53.2%) the respondents to the most recent Supplier Selection and Man-
agement Report survey say that they are actively reducing their supplier base.
Few, however, mention price as their primary reason. Instead, the new goals
span a wide range of strategic objectives. With the expectation that they will
stimulate new ideas and tactics, we share some of the hundreds of responses
purchasing professionals provided us. 
Support for continuous improvement initiatives.
“We have a goal to get down
to 300 suppliers corporate-wide at a quality level of 3 ppm within four
years,” shares the purchasing vice president at a major manufacturer of con-
sumer appliances. “Our procurement infrastructure could not support the
multitude of continuous improvement initiatives without a dedicated pro-
cess to rationalize our current supply base.”
They identiﬁed the issue of supply base rationalization and subsequently
formalized the initiative. “The process of supplier selection can be very
emotional,” he acknowledges. “Establishing an objective process of supply
rationalization through auditing of key business and quality criteria has been
instrumental to our success.”
Reduce total cost of acquisition.
“We’re concentrating our material require-
ments into fewer—although not necessarily single or sole—source
IOMA Readers Report What Works
851

suppliers,” maintains the purchasing vice president at a midsize producer of
alcoholic beverages. “Essentially, our objective is to be ‘important’ to exist-
ing suppliers.” To date, “We’ve been able to lower our cost of acquisition via
improved internal efﬁciencies and better machine utilization on the part of
our suppliers.”
Less time for buyers to work on the traditional aspects of purchasing.
“By consol-
idating our supply base to fewer key suppliers, our buyers beneﬁt by spend-
ing less time contacting suppliers, preparing orders, and doing other trans-
actional duties,” offers the sales/purchasing manager at a midsize provider of
electronics assemblies. “Our buyers are now more involved with studying
the markets, developing supplier selection criteria, and other strategic activ-
ities.”
Global consolidation leads to longer-term contracts.
“We’ve formalized a pro-
gram for consolidating worldwide requirements into global procurement
initiatives resulting in corporate contracts,” reports the director of world-
wide supplier management for a large provider of over-the-counter phar-
maceutical products. “We’ve also entered into a number of longer-term
contracts, out to three years, as opposed to the typical one-year pacts.”
There was some resistance to the plan by individual regions, as they be-
lieved they would lose local autonomy, he explains. “To alleviate this situa-
tion, we solicited the input from regional purchasing, plant, and quality
people in drafting the RFPs [requests for proposals]. Further, we instituted
supplier days at the local plant level to review the requirements and hear sup-
plier presentations.”
Consolidated purchasing initiative removes suppliers and saves cost.
“We did a
company-wide sweep of suppliers and found we were doing business with
more than 20 suppliers for business forms alone,” reports a division purchas-
ing manager at a large manufacturer of circuit protection products. “We
immediately instituted a forms management process, which enabled us to
move to just one supplier. We expect our ﬁrst year savings will be as great as
$200,000, which we’ll track and report monthly,” he shares. 
Better speciﬁcations are the outcome of supplier reduction initiative.
The opera-
tions vice president at a small maker of laboratory wares tells of consolidat-
ing the suppliers of plastic resins and packaging materials. “This situation
directly led to improved cooperation between our engineering and
852
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

manufacturing operations. As a result, they worked together and with pur-
chasing and the suppliers to jointly develop better speciﬁcations, which im-
proved our yield and processing operations, reducing our costs overall.”
Less inventory with fewer suppliers.
“Since reducing the supplier base and
contracting with a regional distributor, we’ve been able to reduce miscella-
neous transaction charges, have fewer deliveries, and reduce our on-hand in-
ventory,” maintains the materials management director at a midsize provider
of health care products.
Cross-functional teams help “right-size” supplier base.
The director of key sup-
plier development at a large forest products company shares, “We now have
beneﬁcial long-term supplier relationships since we used a series of cross-
functional teams to help us determine the proper number of suppliers we re-
quired in each of several categories.” 
The director acknowledges that the challenge was in managing the
change created in the supplier base but with improving supplier relationships
and better performance by the suppliers. “Our internal customers came
around to accepting what we’re doing now as an ongoing initiative.”
Stronger relationships with suppliers now possible.
A plant buyer at a small
maker of specialty chemicals ﬁnds that reducing the supplier base has en-
abled him to develop a stronger relationship with those suppliers that re-
main. “Our raw materials are delivered more frequently, and we now have
less on-hand materials that we have to store,” he notes. “Besides, I now have
time to learn more about the supplier and their capabilities.”
Supply base rationalization accounts for $6 million in savings.
“In one area we
started with ﬁve suppliers and established a series of success criteria,” explains
the chief purchasing ofﬁcer at a large preparer of frozen food products. Af-
ter three years, and based on the ability to meet the criteria consistently, the
number of suppliers was cut to two.
“The success of our supplier rationalization process, which originally
was met with much skepticism, is attributable to top management support
and the formation of cross-functional teams which drove the selection and
review processes.” He did not downplay the need for a great deal of internal
selling and believes that the team participation helped turn the project into
a winner—“especially when we held the teams accountable for the supplier
selection,” he notes.

Like you, your peers are confronting wide-ranging challenges. They extend
from the perennial—price increases and supplier quality issues—to those of
a more recent vintage—supplier alliances, cross-functional teaming, and
foreign sourcing. In the latest Supplier Selection and Management Report sur-
vey, respondents share both the nature and resolution of their most pressing
problems (see sidebar).
The following excerpts, culled from hundreds of responses, provide a
real-world, practical compendium for purchasing problem solving.
854
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T
Some Problems Don’t Ever Seem to Go Away
While the majority of respondents report success in meeting speciﬁc chal-
lenges, others still have difﬁculty resolving theirs. Some found the time to ex-
plain their continuing difﬁculties:
•
“Changing suppliers of major components is a slow and arduous pro-
cess of supplier selection, prototype production, and engineering testing here
and at our parent company in Japan,” explains the general manager of pur-
chasing at a midsize manufacturer of material handling equipment. “Signiﬁ-
cant barriers remain in communicating with the Japanese engineers, and in
having an insufﬁcient local engineering staff to address the priority projects.”
•
“Offshore sourcing for medium-volume purchases remains a problem
due to a lack of management commitment to the up-front investment re-
quired to develop sufﬁcient, quality offshore sources,” maintains a purchasing
director at a large gear manufacturer. 
•
“Having a supplier certiﬁcation process intuitively seems like a good
idea,” a purchasing manager at a large maker of electric tools explains. “How-
ever, I can’t get it past the management board because of the difﬁculty in jus-
tifying the extra administrative costs involved.”
•
“I’ve attempted to implement a procurement card program but have
only met with resistance from our ﬁnance group,” explains a purchasing man-
ager at a large producer of wireless products. “It’s no closer to being resolved
as the primary barrier is ﬁnance’s adamant resistance to change existing pro-
cedures.”

Get management’s acceptance for supplier partnerships.
“One of my most press-
ing problems has been to get executive management to allow us to treat sup-
pliers as partners rather than adversaries,” related the senior director of ma-
terials management and purchasing at a large government agency. “It was
resolved when we demonstrated the potential cost savings of a cooperative
effort. Naturally, we kept management aware of our progress as we devel-
oped the plan.” 
Work through supplier’s subpar quality and delivery performance.
“Due to rapid,
unplanned growth, a key supplier/partner’s quality and delivery perfor-
mance plummeted,” maintains a purchasing manager at a small producer of
telecom test/monitoring systems. “To resolve this situation we have imple-
mented an intensive program that involves weekly conference calls, formed
project improvement teams to look at all problem areas, and begun to issue
monthly report cards on performance.” The project teams include repre-
sentatives from the supplier.
Maintain the focus of internal resources on the desired goals.
“We have set some
aggressive goals, such as a 30% purchase part cost reduction over ﬁve years,
100% quality of purchased parts through our manufacturing process, and
100% on-time delivery,” speciﬁes a procurement manager at a midsize maker
of aircraft safety systems. “We realized early on that these goals could not be
met without the support of engineering, manufacturing, and quality assur-
ance,” he acknowledged. 
Since each of these functions also has its own priorities, it was decided
to “synergize the goals of the four departments and allocate resources from
each group to form a cross-functional team.” The team meets regularly and
publishes meeting minutes that include action items listed by commodity,
completion dates, and speciﬁc personnel for ownership. The team also gives
an executive review twice a year. In the last year, the effort of this seven-
person team has generated more than $800,000 in savings.
Replace foreign supplier due to repeated, major problems.
“We were not pleased
with our European manufacturing supplier,” maintains a purchasing man-
ager at a small software producer. “We attempted to correct the situation by
working more closely with the supplier, but it didn’t take. Finally, we had to
conduct a supplier search. We assembled a cross-functional team and visited
three candidates, reviewing their capabilities and facilities,” he explains. “It’s
IOMA Readers Report What Works

an expensive process, but the results we’ve been achieving more than repay
the investment.” 
Alert engineering about working alone with suppliers.
“Our engineers and plant
people have their own preferences when it comes to speciﬁc suppliers,” a
purchasing engineering manager at a midsize producer of printing inks re-
marks. “The suppliers know this as well, and it creates a very noncompeti-
tive situation for us.” The solution was discussing alternative options with
engineering and operations personnel before they make the purchase. “One
point we stressed was that they had to get at least two bids on speciﬁc pur-
chases,” he explains.
Resolve lead-time issues to maintain correct inventory balances.
A scheduling su-
pervisor at a large producer of lighting ﬁxtures relates that unresolved lead-
time issues are causing them to have either “too much or not enough of
certain critical materials.” Electronic data interchange (EDI) has helped
somewhat. “However, we are in serious discussion with our suppliers to
open miniwarehouses and distribution points to supply us more often with
smaller lots,” he explains.
Break from the “three quote and a cloud of dust” philosophy.
The manager of
procurement at a midsize producer of heat exchangers relates how they are
trying to do away with a traditional practice: getting three quotes on every-
thing. “Now, we are starting to have the various suppliers come into our fa-
cilities and meet representatives from other departments, such as engineer-
ing, materials, production, and quality,” he explains. “It’s part of our new
initiative to break down the barriers that may exist between our suppliers and
ourselves. We’re beginning to see some positive results from these new re-
lationships.”

Case Studies of Success

GL
The transition to a lean corporate culture has dramatically impacted the pro-
curement organization at Vermeer Manufacturing Co. (Pella, Iowa). For
one, there has been a pronounced change in the procurement mission and
methodology at the major manufacturer of construction, environmental and
agricultural equipment. Here is why, how it was done, and what it achieved.
A radical shift in purchasing culture.
“We put together a corporate procure-
ment team that developed and implemented a total acquisition cost reduc-
tion system to provide us with a competitive advantage,” explains Randy L.
Gard, vice president of global planning, who previously was director of cor-
porate procurement (rgard@vermeermfg.com). The objective was to “ac-
complish our mission through long-term value-added partnerships with
suppliers, other manufacturers and customers.” 
The overall strategy for corporate procurement was to leverage volume
to lower costs and to purchase best value from best-in-class suppliers. Be-
cause Vermeer is a private company and holds its ﬁnancial data proprietary,
they describe their success for ﬁscal year 1999 generically as the following:
• Steel supplier consolidation and renegotiated contracts resulted in a
signiﬁcant savings in purchase price variance.
857

• Freight supplier consolidation and renegotiated contracts resulted in
major “hard” dollar savings.
• Long-term alliance with Vermeer’s major hydraulics suppliers re-
sulted in a rate of projected savings into the double digits.
• Other initiatives resulted in additional projected savings, which are
described as “very signiﬁcant.”
Creating a new procurement organization and over-communicating to gain buy-in.
The change began in October 1998 with the formation of a procurement
group that sets purchasing strategy and policy at the corporate level through
the director of procurement. Additionally, the company created six supplier
alliance specialist positions, one for each commodity.
“The individuals ﬁlling these positions were either senior buyers or ma-
terials managers at our focus factories,” Gard explained at a recent NAPM
Supply Chain Management Conference. “They no longer cut POs or ﬁght
ﬁres.” Instead, within the new organization, they now are responsible for
negotiating, leveraging, and managing the long-term agreements with se-
lected best-in-class suppliers.
Buying steel in the new organization.
The supplier alliance specialist who
handles steel shows an example of the impact of the new organization. “Pre-
viously, we had 28 different suppliers, and each focus factory bought the
same steel from the same company, but each would pay a different price, de-
pending on the aggressiveness and behavior of the individual buyers at the
focus factory,” Gard describes.
Today, Vermeer has only two suppliers for their steel requirements, with
a consistent price package. “We went through the entire exercise of walking
through and doing site surveys,” he notes. “Internally, the people at the fo-
cus factories, from the buyers to the operations managers, told us we couldn’t
cut 26 of their suppliers. But we did, and successfully, at that.” 
Part of the solution was to over-communicate. “We found that we had
to regularly meet with the buyers and materials people, sometimes almost
daily, to get our message across,” he explains. Part of the problem was that
Vermeer is located on an 88-acre campus, in eight plants, with each operat-
ing autonomously.
Currently, the procurement staff includes 11 at the corporate level (six
supplier alliance specialists plus support people). Recently they added two
other positions to handle corporate warranty matters. They found one of
858
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

their highest costs was not work in the ﬁeld, but warranty variances in the
process. So, now they’re more aggressively recovering costs from the sup-
pliers of faulty product.
There are 25 buyer/planners at the focus factories who manage the in-
ventory and provide the materials for each manufacturing division. They
handle the day-to-day activities and continue to report to the focus factory
management.
Emphasizing new series of metrics.
At the start of this reorganization, Vermeer
had 4,000 suppliers. They are now at 2,000 and are trying to reduce it still
further, to 400 suppliers. A Pareto analysis they did found that 195 suppliers
account for 83% of the annual spend.
“For the procurement team to be successful, we need to measure exactly
what we want to accomplish and to develop a plan to accomplish that,” Gard
explains. For instance, they measure ppv, like many others. Also, they
looked at payment terms.
“As a culture, for a long time we said that net 30 is how we would pay our
bills, so we could hold onto our money as long as possible,” he recalls. “When
we analyzed this and developed several scenarios, we found that when we went
to 2% ten, taking that 2% gave us a far greater return than holding onto the cash.”
Introducing supplier report cards and performance indices.
“We measure supplier
performance in quality and delivery, and they also measure our perfor-
mance,” maintains Gard. The entire purpose is to be a better customer and
to drive down the total acquisition cost.
“The report card quantiﬁes the things we know or think we know,” he
mentions. However, he does emphasize that they keep the measurement
simple. “We don’t get into a lot of bizarre algorithms, like ppm,” he notes.
“It’s essentially, did you get it here on time, yes or no?”
In addition, they have created a value-based supplier performance in-
dex. It takes into consideration the part cost plus the nonconformance costs
to provide an index. The nonconformance cost equals those charges associ-
ated with warranty, time-based delivery, poor quality as gathered from the
report card, and others (see Table III-3.1).
“Essentially, we put a number against that nonconformance, or what
does it cost us when that particular event occurs,” he explains. For example,
when a part comes in early by a day, or is late by a day, what is the cost to the
company. When the part is a day late, there are phone calls to be made; when
it is early, you have to ﬁnd a place for it.

“You can make it as subjective or tangible as you would like it,” Gard
explains. “We said, as an example, for every day early or late it costs us $60
(not the real ﬁgure).”
When you roll all of the nonconformance costs into the formula, the re-
sultant performance index when calculated into the bid provides a deﬁnitive
“value” determination. Now, Vermeer has a report that it shares with the
supplier, and can use as a counter to a supplier’s low price bid argument.
“The index tells me how much more it costs to deal with that particular sup-
plier, based on its past performance,” Gard explains.
Creating more opportunities for the suppliers.
The new philosophy means
greater supplier involvement. But ﬁrst, Vermeer’s supplier partners must
meet certain qualiﬁcations. As Gard details, they must
• Understand Vermeer’s business and proactively help them reach their
goals
• Seamlessly integrate themselves into all facets of Vermeer’s business,
from new product development Kaizen teams to current operations
• Lead their industry in quality, total cost, innovation, and continuous
improvement plans (which they must present to Vermeer)
• Grow their business as Vermeer grows
However, Gard emphasizes, this is not a one-way street. Vermeer will
• Give its supplier partners the information and feedback they need to
improve
• Provide signiﬁcant growth and new business opportunities for its
supplier partners

supplier partners in Kaizen events, and the expansion of the Kaizen events
into supplier facilities for even further cost reduction opportunities. Addi-
tionally, Vermeer is converting to an integrated supplier for MRO require-
ments. “The supplier will control that inventory completely and save us a
signiﬁcant amount of inventory investment,” Gard adds.

One of the more controversial concepts in supplier management is that of
the resident supplier. In practice, all it means is having a representative from
a critical supplier on site, who has “ready” access to your information and
people. While traditionalists pan the initiative, forward thinking profession-
als like Terry Sueltman, vice president of supply management at Industrial
Automation & Control, Honeywell Inc. (Phoenix; terry_sueltman@iac.
honeywell.com), advocate it.
Resident suppliers respond.
“Our study clearly shows more cost savings come
from resident suppliers than from nonresident partners,” he explains. Fur-
ther, the latter group also accounts for more cost savings than from suppli-
ers that are in a more traditional relationship with Honeywell IAC. And the
beneﬁts do not stop there. Sueltman maintains that resident suppliers have a
better on-time delivery performance and provide better quality than other
types of supplier relationships. They also make more improvement sugges-
tions.
Honeywell’s survey also found that the sales with resident suppliers grew
at a higher rate than the overall supply base expenditures. The program is a
success, as there are 25 suppliers on site at Honeywell IAC, and more than
100 at other Honeywell Inc. locations, he told a recent NAPM Supply
Chain Management Conference. Success is also spelled AlliedSignal. Since
the merger, Sueltman has been asked to extend the concept to the former
AlliedSignal locations.
Case Studies of Success
861

The criteria for a resident supplier.
Sueltman is quick to point out that each
program must be unique to the needs of the speciﬁc location. “There should
be sufﬁcient current and future business for the supplier to justify the in-
vestment,” he told Supplier Selection and Management Report
in a post-
conference interview. “We require no speciﬁc dollar amount, but most
likely $1 million to $2 million minimum annual business would be needed.”
He insists that the supplier must see an advantage to doing this, “so pre-
thinking about the win-win for both customer and supplier is helpful to de-
termine the probability of success.”
Honeywell creates a win-win supplier/customer matrix, which the
buyer must ﬁll in. For example, if a resident supplier is a beneﬁt to the cus-
tomer (Honeywell, in this case), what is the beneﬁt to the supplier? Among
the supplier wins are more business, access to new product designs, less sell-
ing expense, assured sales, and access to information earlier.
The progression to resident supplier status.
“Next, there should already be a
good relationship with the supplier,” he continues. When starting a resident
program, Sueltman advises starting with a pilot program so that both parties
can learn to do it right. “Be committed to making it successful,” he empha-
sizes. “There should be a deﬁned and measurable set of goals for both par-
ties. Review progress regularly on a monthly or quarterly schedule.”
These relationships need time to develop.
Sueltman also recommends pursu-
ing the resident supplier concept (see Table III-3.2) with a supplier whose
products you expect to buy for at least two to three years and whose busi-
ness is likely to grow rather than decline. “A world-class supplier to us is the
result of mutual supply chain development and improvement,” he main-
tains. “Some people think they need to ﬁnd a world-class supplier, but most
likely, they just need to invest resources in developing the current relation-
ship.”
Valuable advice on managing the resident supplier relationship.
According to
Sueltman, “The essence of the resident supplier concept is that the supplier
be integrated into the business more than a traditional relationship would al-
low and that it generate value beyond what would be possible otherwise.”
One challenge is to get the supplier and the person representing the sup-
plier accepted by various groups within the company. For this, he insists on
getting buy-in from all groups involved. Another challenge is to keep work-
ing for greater value in the relationship and not letting it stagnate at a tacti-
862
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

cal role for the supplier. “After a few years the challenge is to keep the rela-
tionship fresh and adding value to both parties,” he acknowledges. Some-
times a change in resident personnel will trigger this.
“I also believe that we have a responsibility to look after the resident
person who has a unique situation by being remote from their own com-
pany, yet not being a fully accepted part of the customer’s company either,”
Sueltman discusses. “Their job satisfaction needs to be a shared responsibil-
ity.”
Curb the supplier’s appetite to seek a price hike, or other unwarranted concessions.
Having a supplier on-site and creating value for the customer can result in a
temptation for the supplier to increase the price for this service, he admits.
The supplier may believe that the cost to the customer is too high to change
the source, while ignoring the beneﬁt of increased business. This may occur
after two or three years and must be challenged and prevented. Part of the
reason, Sueltman admits, is to discourage the other resident suppliers from
following suit, believing that they too can raise prices unilaterally.
He points out that if a supplier starts to look at having a person on-site
as a cost of doing business, “we don’t need them.” There are other suppliers
waiting on line to participate in the program.

Honeywell’s policy insists on ﬁnal approval over the supplier rep in residence.
“We
interview and approve the person who comes on site,” he notes. “Some sup-
pliers offer to hire one of our retirees as an on-site representative, which we
always ﬁrmly reject. We want somebody here who knows the supplier’s
business.”
The residents are colocated throughout the organization. Therefore, the
skill set of the resident person will depend on the goals set for the resident
supplier project. For example, if the resident is in development engineering,
then he or she should be technically knowledgeable of the supplier’s prod-
uct or offerings. If the rep is to be in the factory with the goal of reducing
inventory and shrinking replenishment times, then the skill set would be fo-
cused on knowing the supplier’s production system.
“The rep is deﬁnitely expected to call upon the supplier’s expertise to
help with any issues that arise,” Sueltman explains. “One advantage of hav-
ing an on-site person from the supplier is that he or she would know the sup-
plier’s organization better than we, so would know where to go for answers
and get issues resolved quickly.” The rep is also expected to know who to
contact within Honeywell and is encouraged to be proactive in communi-
cating with Honeywell people.
Communication and involvement are critical.
“Communicate with the supplier
is key,” says Sueltman. “This is how I get the supplier and supplier reps to re-
spond.” For example, although many purchasing professionals still do not
share information with suppliers, Sueltman goes to another extreme. “We
involve the resident supplier in our business,” he declares. “I have a half day
quarterly all-employee meeting. We have someone from ﬁnance come in to
talk to us about proﬁts, ﬁnancials, and other issues.” Speakers come from
other functions, like engineering, sales, and HR. This may be counterintu-
itive, but Sueltman requires the supplier rep to attend the meeting. “I want
them to know we’re doing great, or are having a problem, whether it’s about
budgets, headcounts, or whatever.” After all, he insists, “they are part of the
family.”

Hennessy Industries (Nashville, Tenn.) deﬁnes “supplier development” as the
actions undertaken by both the supplier and the buyer to strive for continu-
864
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

ous improvement in quality, delivery, and cost. “Part of the development pro-
cess for the suppliers is clearly articulating the expectations we have,” explains
Michael C. Moody, CPM, CPIM, purchasing and materials manager. “We
must ensure that they know our expectations for quality, delivery and cost.”
“Since our customers (automobile assembly plants) expect our products
to work out of the box, ﬁrst time, every time, we cannot develop a partner-
ship with any supplier until they have demonstrated their capability to pro-
vide 100% usable parts in every shipment,” Moody declared at a recent
APICS Annual International Conference. “We must expect our suppliers to
meet our delivery needs, ﬁrst time, every time. They must demonstrate their
process capability and control, or they cannot be our supplier.”
Buyers are now responsible for the supplier’s quality.
At Hennessy, the quality de-
partment is no longer responsible for the supplier’s poor quality: the buyer is.
“The buyer must help suppliers in their efforts, or ﬁnd another supplier,” he
emphasizes. The cost of poor quality is high, as it can create line stoppages,
customer service issues, and customer unhappiness with the product. Further,
it can increase total costs through increased warranty costs, Moody explains.
At Hennessy, quality is measured in several different ways. They measure
line rejects, but they do not inspect parts at receiving. They also measure
quality through warranty claims from the customers. When they detect a sup-
plier with a major quality issue that is affecting quality to customers, they re-
view the quality issues with the suppliers and request corrective action.
Supplier documentation is via 8-D analysis form.
“The supplier’s root cause
analysis and countermeasures for permanent elimination of the quality issue
are required,” according to Moody. The analysis form notes the issue, root
cause, corrective action, responsibility for the action, and date of comple-
tion. Oral feedback is no longer accepted.
Once the quality problem has been identiﬁed, the buyer is responsible
for ensuring that the supplier provides satisfactory corrective action.
The suppliers also are evaluated using a formal supplier development
manual, which documents the Hennessy certiﬁcation process. The supplier
life cycle encompasses the following:
• Approved supplier. A supplier approved for business transactions.
• Qualiﬁed/preferred supplier. A supplier that has demonstrated a level of
performance to allow incoming skip lot inspection of product and has a po-
tential for business growth. Qualiﬁed status may be awarded if an approved
Case Studies of Success

supplier achieves high marks on Hennessy’s internal business survey form,
which evaluates their production and quality processes.
ISO registration also helps support this rating. In addition, to achieving
a “good” rating on the business survey, suppliers must demonstrate delivery
of conforming products to the factory for two consecutive quarters.
• Certiﬁed supplier. A supplier at the highest level of achievement, al-
lowing access to all business within the corporation. Status can be awarded
if a qualiﬁed/preferred supplier achieves a rating of “excellent” on the busi-
ness survey and demonstrates four successful quarters of quality deliveries to
the factory.
Hennessy purchasing professionals develop a plan to audit and certify
their key suppliers by month. Each buyer develops their plan for each sup-
plier, schedules onsite business surveys with the supplier, and then conducts
the audit along with a quality control (QC) engineer and/or a manufactur-
ing engineer. “We track our progress and provide countermeasures should
we fall behind our schedule,” he explains.
Buyers also teach and coach suppliers in the ways of kanban.
“After quality, de-
livery of quality parts from the supplier to support our customer’s delivery
expectations is important,” Moody notes. Short lead times are essential to
meeting the company’s just-in-time (JIT) production requirements. Addi-
tionally, working capital turns and lower inventory levels are essential.
“Kanban is the delivery method of choice we have selected,” Moody
maintains. “This term has been much overused and greatly misunderstood,
but has been proven to lower inventory levels, while providing more con-
sistent delivery of products.” 
The buyer’s role at Hennessy is to teach and coach the supplier into a
kanban delivery process. This not only helps them to lower inventory levels
and ensure consistent delivery of parts, Moody explains. “It also helps the
supplier understand how kanban can help them manage their production
levels,” he offers.
“Suppliers with long lead times must either reduce their lead times or
carry a calculated amount of ﬁnished or semiﬁnished parts on their shelves
to meet our lead time expectations,” Moody describes. In many cases, the
suppliers learn how to improve their processes to avoid increasing their over-
all inventory levels.
Total cost is the only true measurement for purchased parts.
Hennessy’s buyers
consider all aspects of costs, including
866
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

• Delivery costs (transportation)
• Inventory costs (increased levels for suppliers with long lead times)
• Cost of poor quality (low productivity, increased inventory to buffer
poor quality performance, warranty costs, customer unhappiness/lost
future sales)
• Lost time for buyer and plant personnel (resolving quality, delivery,
or cost issues from poorly performing suppliers)
“It is the purchasing department’s responsibility to drive quality, deliv-
ery, and cost improvements to their current supply base,” Moody declares.
It is also their role to reduce their supply base to the minimum number nec-
essary to support their operation. “Only through the reduction in the total
number of suppliers we buy from can we focus our efforts more effectively
on helping suppliers develop and learn how to implement continuous im-
provements in quality, delivery and cost,” Moody explains.
Continuous improvement and the buyer’s increasingly critical role.
“Total cost im-
provement is an expectation, just like continuous improvement in quality is
an expectation,” insists Moody. Once buyer and seller negotiate a price, the
supplier is expected to continuously review its processes, materials costs, and
quality costs, and to make ongoing improvements to its costs.
As he explains, “We help our suppliers reduce their total costs. We
single-source our total business needs to those suppliers who can meet our
needs. And, we share our business changes with our suppliers.”

There is a broad misconception that supply chain management strategies and
techniques that work well in the manufacturing sector cannot be successfully
adapted to the service sector. John R. MacLean, vice president of purchas-
ing at American Airlines, Inc. (Dallas; john_maclean@amrcorp.com), has
led the effort, since joining the airline seven years ago, to dispel the fallacy.
In a compelling presentation at a recent Annual NAPM-New York Con-
ference, MacLean described how he uprooted myths of supply chain man-
agement and replaced them with seeds of progress.
You can build a strong supply chain management organization in a service com-
pany.
“One of the ﬁrst steps was to change the reporting relationship of
Case Studies of Success
867

purchasing, which we did,” MacLean argued. When he arrived at American
Airlines in 1992, purchasing was “very deep within the bowels of the or-
ganization.” Purchasing now reports one level below the CEO. “As a con-
sequence, we are able to discuss and even educate our executives on the ben-
eﬁts of supply chain management and get their support to build a strong
organization,” he maintains.
Carefully scrutinize new department hires.
“In the past few years we have up-
graded our organization of professional people so that 100% have degrees,
with more than 20% holding advanced degrees,” he describes. 
In 1992 purchasing’s main function was to process POs, do contracts,
and meet sales people. “We reshaped the purchasing agent’s job to a com-
modity manager and built an organization to support an integrated supply
chain management activity,” according to MacLean. Today, commodity
managers are supported by a team of supply quality specialists, cost, systems,
and logistics analysts, strategic planners and warranty specialists.
Manufacturing’s supplier management strategies can work in a service company.
American now uses 14 different strategies in the management of its supplier
base. It spends $4.5 billion on purchases as diverse as jet fuel (its biggest buy),
which is a traded commodity, to food and beverage (second), to parts and re-
pair services required to maintain the aircraft. MacLean reviewed several of
the “manufacturing” strategies employed:
Use integrated suppliers for nonstrategic buys.
“We use integrated suppliers for
business forms, ofﬁce supplies, employee uniforms, and parts management
for our ground equipment,” MacLean explains. One example he cited is us-
ing an integrated supplier for employee uniforms. “It used to take six weeks
for ordering uniforms, and 20-plus suppliers to provide ties, jackets, sweaters
and vests,” he detailed. “None of the pieces would arrive at the same time.
Some never arrived at all.”
Today, the cycle time for ordering uniforms is only 48 hours, and the
employees can expect to get all the “components” to arrive at the same time
and in the right size “98.6% of the time,” he attests. Additionally, they have
removed 10,000 monthly transactions from the system as they reduced the
supplier base from 20 to just one.
Involve the suppliers earlier.
“We also found a way to adapt earlier supplier in-
volvement into our business,” he offers. For instance, when an airline buys new
868
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

airplanes, it specs the interior and the features it wants. For the purchase of the
new 777 and 737 aircrafts, purchasing established a cross-functional team from
marketing, engineering, and purchasing to select the supplier for the seats.
MacLean describes the process: “We had to ﬁnd a supplier that under-
stood early supplier involvement. We also established pricing to target cost-
ing which guaranteed the supplier an agreed upon proﬁt level. Since weight
is critical, we also assigned a target weight for the seats as well.” Additionally,
purchasing was active in conducting joint design reviews, establishing proj-
ect milestones, and design freeze dates.
Global sourcing is now a key element in American’s strategic sourcing plans.
To-
day, they source more than $700 million offshore—a triple increase from
earlier. The strategy follows two paths. One is geographic, where they
source local suppliers (jet fuel, security, catering, and food) to support their
operations in each of the cities they service. The second is strategic, where
they select the best worldwide supplier for a particular commodity, “one
who will support our worldwide needs from a single point,” he explains. Ex-
amples include aircraft seats, galley equipment, aircraft engine parts, china-
ware, ﬂatware, and electric power ground equipment.
Measure nonproduction supplier performance.
“We have stolen shamelessly
from manufacturing on this one,” he acknowledges. However, they have de-
signed their own process to measure nonproduction supplier performance.
It is their Supplier Excellence 2000 process that communicates American’s
expectations to the suppliers, assesses their capability, measures their perfor-
mance, and ultimately recognizes and rewards the “best of the best.”
“We measure all our suppliers in four categories: cost, quality, delivery,
responsiveness,” he describes. “It’s the same categories across the board.
What’s different is that each category is deﬁned uniquely to the commodity.” 
Supply chain management strategies create strong value for American Airlines.
Dis-
pelling the myth of value creation, MacLean declares, “This is my favorite.”
And for good reason, as he details:
• “We have reduced our supply base by 80% since 1995, which drives
down costs, workload, quality defects, and complexity.”
• “We have improved our suppliers’ performance by 31% in just two
years through the implementation of Supplier Excellence 2000.”
Case Studies of Success
869

• “We’ve increased our spending with diversiﬁed suppliers by 39%
since 1995,” he notes. “We consider that value-added as it is very important
to us to have our proﬁle of suppliers mirror that of our customers.”
• “We have improved the cycle time of order delivery of our non-
strategic buy from integrated suppliers by 11 times, and provides our em-
ployees with a hassle-free procurement process.”
The measure MacLean is most proud of is purchasing’s direct contribu-
tion to the bottom line. “We have driven down the cost of what we buy each
and every year for the past ﬁve years,” he maintains. “We can say with a high
degree of certainty that we have had deﬂation for ﬁve years, and because of
our strategies and training, that deﬂation has translated into $250 million of
cost savings right to the bottom line.”

In an effort to build long-term plans, Sun Microsystems’s European opera-
tions designed a supply chain strategy that would ensure that its logistics and
information technology processes were scalable for the future. “We weren’t
good at looking too far into the future,” says Hugh Aitken, vice president of
European operations for Sun’s computer systems. “We moved from quarter
to quarter in a reactive mode.” To solve problems, Aitken designed the Sun
supply chain strategy to take the company out three years. A logistics team
worked through the ﬁrm’s current state of affairs, future goals, and what it
would take to achieve them, explains Aitken. 
Bringing Suppliers and Customers Together
“First, we needed information technology that would get the information
passed quickly to our trading partners when they needed it. The second pri-
ority was improving our logistics processes. Our former one-size-ﬁts-all ap-
proach was killing us. High-volume products have to be moved differently.
That includes everything from geography to delivery methods.”
One of Sun’s more radical supply chain strategies is getting customers to
talk directly with suppliers. “We spend $4.4 billion outside of the company
and $3.8 billion of that is with less than 20 suppliers. So we haven’t got thou-
870
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

sands of suppliers.” Aitken says that by introducing key customers to suppli-
ers, Sun is removed from the process. Such meetings are still in the early
stages, but moving forward.
When an order is received at Sun, it is sent to the supplier who ﬁlls the
demand. Aitken says suppliers have access to Sun’s inventory, which takes
time out of the process and improves response time. “This has made a big
difference in bridging the gap between our supplier base and the customer.”
Zero Warehouses
The ﬁnal aspect of Sun’s supply chain strategy is to have zero warehouses
within the next three years. Aitken admits the complexity, since it some-
times takes six suppliers to ﬁll one order. “Rather than having those com-
ponents sit in a ﬁnished goods warehouse, we would like to have the parts
merge while in transit.”
But the key will be a stronger information technology base and a sound
logistics process, he says. “In the computer industry, our customers are con-
stantly raising the service level bar and it is up to us to meet their cost, avail-
ability, and time-to-market demands.”

Eastman Chemical Company (Kingsport, Tenn.; 423-229-6031) had three
familiar logistics problems: 
1. A legacy forecasting system
2. Layers of decision-making 
3. Realization that forecasting customer demand was critical to com-
petitive advantage
It turned to collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment
(CPFR) as the next great supply chain initiative, creating efﬁcient ﬂow of
information among trading partners. A great resource for CPFR informa-
tion is the Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment Com-
mittee. Check out their site at www.cpfr.org.
“We had multiple forecasts throughout the organization,” says Eastman’s
Case Studies of Success
871

John A. Hewson, manager of global forecasting, who spoke to an audience
at a recent Logicon conference. “Nobody knew who was accountable,
everything was random. There was no forecasting; customer involvement
and changes were made unilaterally, resulting in lots of uncertainty.”
“Collaboration can change all that as it is focused on the information
process,” says Andrew White, vice president, product strategy for Logility,
Inc. (Atlanta, 404-264-5967). “It is all about sharing information about con-
sumer demand with multiple layers of the supply chain at the same time.”
While getting its start in the retail industry, experts believe that CPFR
should be of interest to any logistics organization that wants to get closer to
the customer in meeting their demands.
Benchmarking at Eastman
Eastman contracted the University of Tennessee to do a Forecast Benchmark
and identiﬁed the weaknesses noted above, along with a series of steps that
could be utilized to improve the forecasting process.
One of the components involved setting up a central forecasting group
at Eastman that would “own” the forecast process. Another was adoption of
a sophisticated Advanced Planning and Scheduling software package that
would enable delivery of a “one number planning” forecast.
At the conclusion of the benchmark study, Eastman began a software se-
lection process that sought a solution that would meet the need for more ac-
curate forecasts, develop SKU demand forecasts generated from the bottom-
up, support timely input from a global sales force, and be compatible with
its SAP R/3 enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Ultimately, East-
man selected Logility’s Demand Chain Voyager.
The Voyager product allows for remote users, featuring a secured access
to the database of forecasts over the Internet. “The Internet is very hot now,”
says White. “It provides global access 24 hours a day.” 
Savings Are Anticipated
Hewson says that it is still too early to predict what savings Eastman will
achieve with CPFR, but he is anticipating some very signiﬁcant results. “Ini-
tial results show a reduced cycle time in forecasting by 75%, a 10% increase
in accuracy, and a reduction in costs in terms of time and data collection.” He
also expects annual supply chain savings in the range of 2% to 4% of total
company revenue, which is approximately $100 million to $200 million.

The Internet can beneﬁt the supply chain in wide-ranging, lucrative, and, in
many cases, immediate ways. But conducting electronic business has its
challenges, says Mary Murphy-Hoye, manager of strategic programs at In-
tel. “We need to relearn how to market, produce, accept, and fulﬁll orders
and supply our product to this larger customer base,” she said at a recent
Logicon conference.
Integrating the Supply Chain
By integrating supply chain partners through the Internet, Murphy-Hoye
anticipates four key results:
• A more synchronized supply chain
• Optimized customer response
• Real-time detection and correction
• Rapid adaptability to customer issues
The bottom line, she says, is that all the trading partners will have com-
plete visibility to the product’s life cycle.
Supply Chain Activities on the Net
Murphy-Hoye identiﬁes ﬁve areas that are ideal e-business strategies to con-
duct via the Internet (see Table III-3.3):
• E-procurement/e-commerce: This is the capability to engage in on-line
commerce transactions between business entities. This can take the form of
electronic catalogs, on-line approval, on-line contracts, electronic purchase
orders, invoices, and payment.
• E-collaboration: This is the capability to facilitate real-time communi-
cation and interaction between multiple business entities to drive synergy.
For instance, at Intel, Murphy-Hoye says that e-collaboration has been par-
ticularly useful in working with the design and engineering teams. “We have
on-line discussions with these groups, which has led to more rapid product
designs.”

• Integrated planning/manufacturing: This involves the electronic transfer
of system-generated information between business entities to provide de-
mand/supply visibility. Product forecasts, inventory status, and supply/de-
mand requirements can be communicated across the supply chain via the In-
ternet.
• Integrated delivery: Here, the company reviews sales data against tar-
geted forecasts and adjusts production accordingly. Information about sales
and inventory levels is provided real-time over the Internet to the distribu-
tion center and throughout the supply chain.
• On-line marketing: “You want to give customers an Internet experi-
ence about the product they are looking at if you want to compete in your
marketplace,” she says. “The site has to offer them more than a place to just
view your product. You want them to be able to experience the product.”
This is especially critical for Intel, as it wants consumers to test the products
they are interested in right on line. 
There are several issues to keep in mind before integrating the supply
chain via the Internet:
1. Know what drives your business. “Select the top three reasons you want
to go after new business this way and make your decisions based on those

reasons,” says Murphy-Hoye. Some might include better inventory man-
agement, improved supplier relationships, logistics management, continu-
ous improvement, cost reductions, faster cycle times, integrated supply
chains, and to go after new markets.
2. Provide access control. It is critical that your Web site provide security,
privacy, and authorization from the consumer’s perspective.
3. Understand the concept of personalization. “More and more customers
want things their way and the Internet gives you a chance to rise to that chal-
lenge,” she says.
4. Perform data mining. “From our perspective, we did a great job now of
collecting data, but not a good job changing that information into ways to
better serve our customers.” Thanks to the Internet, Murphy-Hoye says the
information is collected and used to develop better products and services.
5. Build upon relationships and trust. “You have to change the way you
treat your integration partners because without the supply chain, you are
nothing.” 
6. Assign risk. Murphy-Hoye says: “If you want to optimize the supply
chain, someone will have to hold inventory and they will need the incentive
to do that. This will make the supply chain more powerful.”
7. Set communication standards. There are many ways to communicate
electronically: EDI, on-line chats, interactive Web, and various Internet
standards. Figure how you want to communicate and take advantage of as
many as you can.
If these above issues are addressed, the beneﬁts of e-business will be
plentiful: improved customer satisfaction, reduced operations costs, the abil-
ity to communicate with more constituents in the supply chain, increased
knowledge of the behavior along the supply chain, and increased revenue.
She says, “The capabilities of Internet technology will change the way we
do business with our suppliers and customers, as well as change the face of
business, in its process and techniques and in the deﬁnition of business itself.”

help in this endeavor. This was a key topic at a recent Logicon conference.
Here, attendees learned how such models are being used at Kellogg’s to
make a difference in their supply chains.
“You can’t optimize only one portion of your supply chain or else the
supply chain will be suboptimized. You need a holistic approach,” says Don
Scott, vice president of North American Logistics for Kellogg’s Company.
Making the Right Product at the Right Plant
In the late 1980s Kellogg’s relied on traditional MRP and DRP systems to
run its business. However, those solutions did not account for the costs as-
sociated with manufacturing or inventory deployment. Therefore, the com-
pany built optimization models for the cereal portion of its business.
More recently, Kellogg’s has been using its optimization models to help
determine where to manufacture its products, based on transportation costs.
“Getting products to customers faster puts pressure on the supply chain to
react,” says Scott. 
Weekly optimization production plans are now used to determine what
to make, when to make it, how much to make, and where to make it. The
model then helps optimize the deployment of the product once it is made.
In the ﬁrst year alone, Kellogg’s saved $4.5 million thanks to improved
sourcing decisions.
Integrating the Key Players
The logistics organization at Kellogg’s is responsible for capacity planning,
transportation, forecasting, and customer service. In addition to integrating
those functions within one department, the company has integrated its total
supply chain—from the supplier to the retailer—in an effort to make all
partners successful in their endeavors. 
This has proven especially worthwhile in bringing supply and demand
closer together. “Key managers from both sides meet once a month to inte-
grate planning decisions for the next one to six months,” explains Scott.
“They discuss the risks and opportunities involved in forecast planning and
meeting customer demand. The optimization model allows them to carry
out this task within hours.”
Overcoming Planning Challenges
Scott says that the planning challenge at Kellogg’s is making sure that infor-
mation is available to predict the future. For instance, trade deals are common
876
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

in the cereal market, and these drive demand over short periods of time as
high as 200%. In addition, new products are being introduced all the time in
this very competitive sector, forcing the logistics folks to ensure that enough
inventory is in the channel to meet the demand surge at introduction.
“We have turned to our optimization model to help us set aside the ca-
pacity and inventory to meet these demands,” says Scott. “The model helps
us predict production line throughput and uptime to maximize our capac-
ity.”
Driving Out Nonvalue Dollars
The ﬁnancial and logistics departments work closely at Kellogg’s to share the
company’s mission with its suppliers. The idea is to “drive out every non-
value-added dollar from the supply chain because each one that doesn’t add
value takes away from the perception that our customers have about our
products,” says Scott. “We make sure that every component and activity in
the supply chain adds value.”
If, for example, Kellogg’s were not able to deliver to a retailer because
the retailer was unable to accept the shipment at the time of delivery, Kel-
logg’s would work with that customer to see why that occurred and how it
can be prevented in the future, explains Scott. “If our product is not in the
stores when the consumer wants it, that impacts our value.”
Kellogg’s has invested in customer logistics representatives to preserve
that value. These representatives will actually visit the retailer to ﬁnd out
why a delivery could not be carried out.
The State of Affairs So Far
Since implementation ﬁve years ago, Kellogg’s has increased inventory turns
by 6%. “It’s not a lot in the general scheme of things, but with our volume
[one billion pounds of cereal/year], it is a lot,” says Scott.

Although distributors cannot mandate supply chain management, they are a
strategic link in the process. As mediators, they can point out the beneﬁts of
supply chain management to suppliers and customers and reap their own re-
wards in the process.
Case Studies of Success

One company that has done this successfully is electronics manufacturer
Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc. (Cleveland; 216-587-3600). Since mak-
ing a focused effort to integrate supply chain management strategies, the
company has increased sales per employee from just over $650,000 to nearly
$900,000 over three years.
SCM Softens Distributor Pressures
Pioneer-Standard is a primary example of the competitive pressures elec-
tronics distributors are facing today—namely, to deliver product quickly and
efﬁciently at the lowest possible cost. Here is how they addressed these daily
pressures through the use of SCM:
Cost containment.
Many distributors are under proﬁt margin pressure and
cannot raise prices. Instead, they move to reduce internal costs and total ac-
quisition costs for their customers.
“Take out costs or else” is the message that many electronics distribu-
tors are getting from suppliers and customers, says Cynthia Bova, director of
Pioneer-Standard’s Integrated Inventory and Logistics Services. Distributors
that succeed as a strategic link between suppliers and customers keep the
business they have and gain a competitive advantage over others who insist
that the costs of specifying, acquiring, delivering, and using products and
services are ﬁxed.
Differentiation.
Distributors have the opportunity to stand out in a value-
added way by working with suppliers and customers to create demand for
suppliers’ products, instead of fulﬁlling demand that would be there even if
the distributor were not part of the supply chain, says Bova.
Pioneer-Standard differentiates itself in the supply chain by introduc-
ing its suppliers’ technology to target markets, incorporating the tech-
nology into its customers’ products, and improving its customers’ proﬁt
opportunity with business solutions that exceed their expectations, she
explains.
Increase sophistication.
“Distributors don’t have to keep large inventories of
all products,” says Jim Kosakowski, Pioneer-Standard’s director of supply
chain management. “We stock the most important and use forecasting in-
formation and the relationships with customers and suppliers to meet all
other needs in a timely, cost-effective way.”
878
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

Three Focus Areas
In an effort to tackle the pressures that it faces daily, Pioneer-Standard is fo-
cusing its SCM strategies on three primary areas: 
• Develop a new way of thinking so that the entire supply chain works together
as an extended enterprise to beneﬁt customers. In many cases, says Bova, the so-
lution is for designers, manufacturers, and distributors to standardize as many
parts and components as possible and to introduce the differentiators much
closer to the customer and the time of purchase.
• Cultivate new business processes and relationships that focus on partnerships,
common goals, and shared performance measures. “We’re educating our cus-
tomers and suppliers, and at the same time, learning from them,” Bova says.
“We must understand how their internal processes work, how our processes
should link with them, and how all of us might have to change for the ben-
eﬁt of the supply chain.”
In one instance, Pioneer-Standard is helping a large electronic contract
manufacturer (CM) simplify its component ordering and sales forecasting
functions. It is providing order quoting for an entire computer board by ag-
gregating the costs for the commodity parts. The relationship has the po-
tential to reach a point where all bills of material are handled electronically
and Pioneer-Standard manages the manufacturer’s warehouses.
“Establishing trust and respect has beneﬁts for everyone,” says John
Kump, Pioneer-Standard’s director of interactive sales and marketing. “We
gain a large customer, the CM gets less costly and simpliﬁed procurement,
the CM’s customer has shorter lead times, and the end customer has inex-
pensive access to leading-edge technology.”
• Invest in technology as an enabler that automates processes and connects mem-
bers of the supply chain. According to Kosakowski, technology can only be ap-
plicable and efﬁcient if it can accommodate three types of transactions: day-
to-day, planning and decision making, and strategic analysis.
Pioneer-Standard’s Internet services are designed as interactive cus-
tomer service tools, says Kump. The company’s Online Catalogs and Order
Center provide online ordering of more than 350,000 electronic compo-
nents. Customers get real-time order tracking, inventory management, ship-
ping information and account administration. An automated e-mail pro-
gram helps customers track orders placed through other sales channels.
In addition, EDI connections with suppliers and customers facilitate
two-way sharing and information transfer as well as the movement of
Case Studies of Success

products through the supply chain. The company also helps customers use
its Warehouse Integrated Network software to automate ordering and in-
ventory management processes.
SCM Benefits at Pioneer-Standard
Pioneer-Standard believes that its focus on supply chain management strate-
gies will result in a reduction in total acquisition costs, time to manufacture,
and time to market for customers, as well as improved customer access to
new products and technologies, and supplier access to growth markets and
new customers.
Supply chain management has also enabled Pioneer-Standard to im-
prove its internal processes, making employees more efﬁcient and more re-
sponsive to customer demands.

Honda Trading America Corporation (Marysville, Ohio), in 1993, recog-
nized that to support its growth opportunities and meet its strategic objec-
tives to become a complete global supply chain organization, it had to gain
better access to its information. Its most pressing issue was the management
of the entire steel and aluminum supply chain. 
According to Greg Norval, senior manager of accounting/administra-
tion, there were “four crucial events that had to be met for the supply chain
to be considered a success”:
• Inventory had to be completely visible throughout the system. Steel and alu-
minum are received directly at Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc., or
at as many as ﬁve different processing centers (for slitting, cutting, stamping)
and 30 to 40 subassemblers. “Operating in a tight delivery environment,
Honda Trading must be assured that inventory is available to meet demand
throughout the supply chain while maintaining minimal ﬂoor inventory,”
Norval explains.
• Steel and aluminum have to be tracked and costed through slitting, cutting and
stamping at the processors. The system has to provide comprehensive transfor-
mation audit trails with a history of the converted product back to the plant.
880
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

In fact, every steel piece and part has to be tracked back to its original steel
coil for complete quality management. 
• Waste resulting from slitting and cutting at the processors had to be visible.
“To efﬁciently control ﬁnished costs through the entire transformation pro-
cess, tracking the costs related to the waste and recycling the scrap had to be
managed within the software solution selected,” he describes.
• Integrity of inventory cost had to be maintained at the SKU level. There was
also the critical requirement to report raw material inventory cost as it
moved through its various transformations.
Other needs required from the supply chain management software solution.
Honda
Trading America also had to consider its export/import needs. “We needed
a system that allowed us to upload and track multi-line orders, often greater
than 1,000 lines, validate the information, and prepare all export documen-
tation,” Norval offers. Operating in a global trading environment, the com-
pany required a system that supported multiple languages for documentation
and multiple currencies for accounting purposes.
Further, the solution also had to have a solid integrated accounting sys-
tem. “The proper solution would provide us with the ability to balance our
accounts quickly so we could pass accurate information to other enterprise-
wide systems at our business partners.”
Honda ﬁnds solution at a small niche software developer.
For the supply chain
management implementation to be successful Honda Trading had to support
its steel procurement and inventory management group; its metals, plastics
and recycling group; its import and export department; and provide com-
plete cost control throughout the system. 
After an in-depth search and review of potential solutions, Norval
reports the team decided to partner with Blinco Systems Inc. (Toronto).
“The company demonstrated to us a significant expertise in international
supply chain and logistics solutions,” he declares. “And a review of its
3RDWAVE software model convinced us it was adaptable to the rigors of
our environment.” Additionally, he offers, “Blinco representatives exhib-
ited a quick and comprehensive understanding of our current and future
requirements.”
Honda/Blinco collaboration leads to achievement of primary objectives.

(Ned) Blinick, vice president of Blinco Systems, reﬂects, “3RDWAVE’s

fully integrated core solution provides a comprehensive foundation that
could be customized to meet Honda Trading’s speciﬁc needs.”
For instance, the core solution of purchase order management, trafﬁc
control, inventory management, sales order processing, and accounting
modules touched on Honda’s main business processes. “The solution also
provided us with gateways to automate communications with our suppliers,
customers and other corporate systems,” Norval describes. “Through the
collaboration with Blinco’s development team, we have been able to achieve
all of the primary objectives,” he reports.
Inventory visible throughout the process.
Today, Honda Trading is able to
closely match its supply and demand requirements. With 3RDWAVE pro-
viding complete inventory status throughout the global supply pipeline,
Honda Trading can “immediately” determine availability of inventory to
meet demand.
Working closely with its processors, Honda gathers demand data within
the software, analyzes it, and drives its purchase orders to the mills. “This
process ensures that the right product is produced and delivered according
to actual demand needs,” Norval explains.
EDI receipts of advanced shipping notices (ASNs) from its suppliers
streamlines Honda Trading’s receiving processes. “This virtually assures the
accuracy of inventory throughout the supply pipeline,” he notes.
If delivered to a processor, 3RDWAVE monitors the inventory derived
from the parent, its waste and its cost. “Providing visibility into the status of
inventory through the transformation process insures that delivery to Honda
of America Manufacturing and its tier one suppliers are met according to its
tight JIT programs,” Norval insists.
Beneﬁts realized in related supply chain activities as well.
With the software’s in-
tegrated purchase order management, sales order management, documenta-
tion, trafﬁc and accounting modules, Honda Trading has full visibility into
the status of domestic, export and import orders.
For instance, the company has been able to increase the accuracy and
dramatically streamline the time required in documentation preparation for
its export business. A process that took days to complete is now accom-
plished in several hours.
With 3RDWAVE, Honda Trading generates the pro-forma invoice,
commercial invoice, packing lists/manifests, bills of lading and other docu-
mentation in multiple languages, as required.
882
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

In addition, the company has achieved its accounting objectives.
“Maintaining accounts in the currency of their transaction and being able to
mediate exchange rates against the U.S. dollar provides us with accurate ac-
count statuses,” Norval details. In addition, the system provides complete
exchange rate proﬁt and loss analysis.
“With the complete cost integration within 3RDWAVE, we’re also able
to balance inventory costs with the general ledger and analyze any variances
quickly,” he explains. “We now close our books within days of period end
to provide more timely accounting reporting.”
Norval adds, “Since we now have access to accurate information in real-
time, we’re better able to support the functional needs of our operators and
the strategic requirements of management.” The new solution ensures that
accounts are in balance throughout the system with complete audit trails.
“The information we report across the system now has full integrity,” Nor-
val declares.

One perplexing problem for inventory managers is reducing inventory
while supporting a guaranteed service level to customers. The major chal-
lenge is predicting and optimizing the inventory required to meet this ob-
jective. Rick Balla, group manager, purchasing and materials management,
GTE Supply (Irving, Texas; 972-751-4305) faced a similar situation (see
sidebar). However, he solved the dilemma by using inventory planning soft-
ware that optimizes the inventory required to provide the guaranteed avail-
ability. 
The solution he adopted streamlined GTE’s supply chain activities to
support a 98.5% service level with 40% less inventory within six months, for
an annual cost savings in inventory of almost $30 million. 
Improving the typical tradeoff between inventory turns and service level.
“To ini-
tially address product availability, there was a large planning effort within
GTE Supply guided by results-oriented and meaningful metrics,” Balla ex-
plained at a recent Council of Logistics Annual Conference. “This resulted
in multiple inventory strategies deployed across different types of inventory.”
The process, he allowed, did hit the availability target. “We obtained the
material needed to address customer requirements, but we also incurred

How GTE Supply Applies the LogicStock Solution
LogicStock analyzes each item and its total demand to determine the item’s
stocking strategy. In determining which items to stock, the software consid-
ers each item’s unique situation concerning sales activity, criticality and supply
strategy. In the case of GTE Supply, the stocking rules consider the criticality
of the item and the item’s level of sales activity.
When determining stocking quantities, LogicStock calculates the overall
availability level given each item’s constraints and speciﬁcations. It determines
the stocking quantities that yield the most availability per cost. “Since there
are a number of variables inﬂuencing our inventory decisions, LogicStock has
the ﬂexibility to allow us to incorporate a number of them into the model,”
Balla notes. They include:
Business environment.
Speciﬁcally, LogicStock’s ﬂexibility models varying
environments and conducts ‘what if’ scenarios. As an example, in one busi-
ness unit, there are 1,000+ suppliers and two GTE Supply logistics centers.
From the logistics centers the product ﬂows directly to the end-user customer.
“For rapid implementation, GTE Supply used the supply chain as a ﬁxed
input to LogicStock,” explains Uhrig. The implementation focused on im-
proving the inventory stocking logic that goes into the process, and GTE
Supply gauged the improvement potential without making changes to the
supply chain.
“There was no consolidation of distribution centers, no changes to the
ordering patterns from suppliers, and customers continued to order to the
same schedules,” Balla offered. Further, LogicStock also considers ﬁnancial
objectives such as targeted number of inventory turns.
Customer demand.
While customers require off-the-shelf availability within
a 24 hour period, the demand for products is seasonal and full of spikes. In-
ventory strategy, thus, changes with changes in seasonal demand forecasts.
The software considers the accuracy of the demand forecast. Demand
patterns are subject to a validation/veriﬁcation/sensitivity process to deter-
mine the reasonableness of the pattern. 
GTE Supply updates the forecasts on a monthly basis, therefore, Logic-
Stock is also run monthly to obtain the new inventory model. It also deter-
mines where to stock an item in the supply chain. 
Item characteristics.
The items in inventory change constantly. The model
identiﬁes these changes through the item planning process. At the item level,
LogicStock can specify the minimum availability target.

a large inventory investment,” he acknowledged. Inventory turns were a
low 3.3.
Examining the inventory stocking issues.
Not satisﬁed that they were achiev-
ing the availability target with the least cost inventory, Balla began to inves-
tigate the following:
• What inventory does GTE Supply need to meet guaranteed service
levels?
• Is it possible to lower the inventory level and still maintain a 98.5%
service level?
• Which items does GTE Supply need to stock and which items can
they obtain directly from the supplier?
• What quantity of each item should GTE Supply stock?
• How much will it cost?
• What is the optimum mix of items to stock?
To answer these questions, Balla used LogicStock, a PC-based inventory
optimization software system (TCLogic, LLC; Indianapolis).
Software model ﬁnds stocking strategy out of sync.
To determine the least cost
inventory stocking strategy, TCLogic ran a pilot at GTE Supply that mod-
eled the operating environment. The pilot revealed 300 large impact items.
According to Thomas C. Uhrig, president of TCLogic (317-464-5152),
“These items were greatly out of sync with the stocking strategy suggested
by LogicStock.” There were almost 100 items understocked, and 200 items
overstocked.
Case Studies of Success

While the user can establish parameters for a class of items, the software
enables them to provide a higher resolution of stocking by allowing them to
specify parameters on an individual, item by item basis.
Supply strategy.
The amount of inventory GTE Supply has to carry is very
dependent upon the suppliers and their capabilities. Therefore, the TLCLogic
model incorporates factors such as manufacturing lead times, order policies
and order multiples. It then decides whether to order direct or stock those
items.

“Our planners looked at the items and made sure there were not out-
side factors the model did not consider, such as supplier capacity issues,”
Balla explains. “We then made extensive use of the item-level strategy lists
and focused on the large impact items.”
By focusing on the 300 large-impact items, inventory levels were de-
creased from $12.2 million to $7.1 million over ﬁve months while main-
taining the guaranteed 98.5% service level. The current inventory level, ac-
cording to Balla, is $5.3 million.
Expanding the LogicStock application to other business units yields additional bene-
ﬁts.
GTE Supply then applied the software at ﬁve other business units. The
business units vary from a retail, customer-oriented business unit to an
industrial-supply business.
Each business unit required the application of different rules. For ex-
ample, in the consumer-oriented business, the product life cycle is so short,
new products supersede older products before the older ones can generate a
sufﬁcient demand history for creating valid forecasts.
“The implementation process highlighted a number of data requiring
cleanup or veriﬁcation,” Balla maintains. Previously, a scorecard process in-
formed the material suppliers if the data with which they were working was
good enough for making decisions. Because of data veriﬁcation through
LogicStock, material planners are now making better decisions, he assures. 
For all business units, GTE Supply uses the new software for
• Service guarantee analysis (what it is going to cost to maintain differ-
ent service levels)
• Monthly item planning (what changes are needed in inventory stock-
ing levels to accommodate forecasted demand)
• Determining what must be stocked (location by location)
Improvements do make a bottom-line difference.
LogicStock reports the overall
strategy and a detailed strategy for each item, Balla offers. “The reports make
it easy for the material planners to focus on high impact activities,” he explains.
“It changes the way the planner spends his/her time, especially in reducing the
time spent reacting to situations and handling transactions and orders.”
Now, the material planners spend more time analyzing events and plan-
ning. Further, the software generated data now points out high impact areas
on which the planners should focus.
886
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

“In our case, those high impact areas were supplier lead times and fore-
cast accuracy,” Balla reveals.
In addition, he cites the following beneﬁts that have been achieved and
can be attributed to LogicStock:
• Inventory reduction of 30% to 40%
• Line item availability of 98.5%
• Reduced inventory carrying costs
• Improved inventory turns, from 3.3 per year to 7.3 annually
• No changes needed in the existing supply chain
• Results achieved with current purchasing and planning systems

Supply chain management is a driving force in the pharmaceutical industry.
Take the case of Boehringer Ingelheim’s Roxane Laboratories (Columbus,
Ohio). It used a combination of the Supply-Chain Operations Reference
Model (SCOR) and a system of benchmarks to initiate a series of actions that
improved inventory turns by 44%. Simultaneously, the company’s customer
service level improved signiﬁcantly, catapulting it into a world-class industry
performer.
“You can improve service levels by throwing inventory at it,” claims
James P. Mellody, head of materials management (614-272-4709). “Our
goal was to improve our customer service while simultaneously reducing in-
ventory.”
SCOR gets everyone moving in the same direction.
“We look at supply chain
management as a real marquee activity in our business,” Mellody cites. “The
twin external factors of growing our market share and driving costs out of
the supply chain to maintain our margins provided the incentive to make
supply chain management a core competency,” he offered at a Supply-Chain
World conference (Supply-Chain Council, Inc.; www.supply-chain.org).
“However, if you talked with our executives about supply chain manage-
ment four years ago, you would have gotten wildly different ideas from
each,” he concedes. That’s where the SCOR model (see Figure III-3.1) ini-
tially proved itself.
Case Studies of Success
887

“The SCOR model gave us the framework and nomenclature to do
many things,” Mellody says. “One most important was a consistent deﬁni-
tion of elements like plan, source, make and deliver.” Armed with this struc-
ture and deﬁnition, they were able to benchmark.
Benchmarking helps to focus on “real” problems.
“One of the biggest problems
we faced was trying to ﬁgure out what to work on ﬁrst,” he offered. “First
with SCOR, then through benchmarking, we were able to deﬁne where to
focus our efforts.” They use an industry service that gathers and provides
benchmarking data within the pharmaceutical industry. It provides a proﬁle
of 20-to-30 metrics that compares the speciﬁc company, item by item,
against its competitors. While not commenting speciﬁcally about Roxane
Laboratories’ speciﬁc proﬁle, one of the metrics may indicate relative com-
parison in an area of inventory planning. “It’s a detailed benchmarking study

of supply chain performance measures,” he explains. “They’re very quanti-
tative and measure on a consistent deﬁnition, which is where SCOR is help-
ful.”
Response to market pressures complicates supply chain.
Another situation that
focused Mellody on supply chain management was the decision to rational-
ize production facilities. Manufacturing of all product lines now would be
concentrated in two facilities, one in Ohio and one in Mexico City. “It com-
plicated the logistics and supply chain,” he reported. “We were faced with
shipping products across borders, and we also had to transfer the technology
and inventories for our products to these locations.”
However, they seized the opportunity to use the supply chain project as
a “way to ensure that the consolidation activities would be successful.” They
focused on
• Improving processes and systems.
• Increasing customer service and inventory performance
• Creating ﬂexibility to do away with the uncertainty of the markets
Again, the SCOR model was most helpful. “We used the SCOR model
to communicate not only among ourselves, but also with our external part-
ners (suppliers and customers),” Mellody explained. “Despite many differ-
ent deﬁnitions of a supply chain that were out there, through SCOR we had
a language that was consistent.”
Getting one’s own house in order ﬁrst.
The ﬁrst step was to form a sales and
operations planning (S&OP) group. “We integrated two major groups into
a business process that would manage the supply chain activities of source,
make and deliver,” said Mellody. “We then focused on what other opportu-
nities there were within our own arena of source, make, and deliver that
could result in performance improvement, such as boosting customer ser-
vice and increasing inventory turns.”
The conversion to an S&OP operation enabled the introduction of balanced scorecard
metrics.
“We put in a number of ﬁnancial metrics on the same page. This
enabled the executives from marketing, operations, and ﬁnance to jointly
look at business performance across a broad spectrum instead of just focus-
ing on their own speciﬁc functions.

“That was a powerful change for our company, to move away from a fo-
cus on a single functional metric,” he maintains. “It forces us to look across
the full range of make, source, and deliver and how a decision impacts the
performance of the total supply chain.” Previously, each function did a great
job optimizing its own activities—often at the expense of others.
“Moving to S+OP forced us to address the supply chain as an end-to-
end process from an organizational standpoint,” Mellody maintains. “That
enhanced the trade-off decisions we make over the inventory we managed.”
Extending the supply chain beyond the “four walls.”
The pharmaceutical giant
partnered with consultant Pittiglio Rabin Todd & McGrath (Waltham,
Mass; www.prtm.com), a driving force and developer of SCOR. “We
looked to PRTM to provide a disciplined approach to supply chain perfor-
mance,” he explains. “We used it to map a supply chain grid, to extend the
SCOR concept beyond our company.”
Says Mellody, “We have thousands of suppliers but only a handful that
can be considered key. To these we wanted to extend our S+OP approach
and share our production plans. Additionally, some of our suppliers are lo-
cated on-site.” Overall, these steps have sliced the lead times and improved
delivery performances—further assisting inventory reduction. 
The next step is to extend this concept to the customer. “We’re getting
more involved with the customer in determining how to service them bet-
ter and give more value,” he explains. A ﬁnal key to success is the internal
supply chain council. It consists of top executives from marketing and sales,
ﬁnance, operations, and the supply chain manager. “Clear, strong, cross-
functional executive leadership is essential.”

In recent years, key performance measures at the Dry Products plant of Eli
Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, Ind.) have been on a continuous roller
coaster ride. To prevent this constant up and down cycling, an effort was ini-
tiated to become an MRP II Class A Certiﬁed factory.
One essential element was to improve supplier relationships.
“Our belief was that
formal processes, policies and performance measures dictated by MRP II
would instill operational discipline in the plant and help stabilize and im-
890
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

prove our key performance measures,” according to Robert Daniel, CPIM,
senior purchasing agent, and Allison Leer, CPIM, MRP II project leader.
“We also identiﬁed supplier on-time delivery performance as a key require-
ment for the plant to achieve Class A performance.”
Purchasing’s quest to achieve 95% supplier on-time delivery.
“We recognized we
had several internal and external issues to resolve,” Daniel and Leer ac-
knowledged at the Congress for Progress XXIII (sponsored by the Mid-
Atlantic Chapters of APICS). First among the internal solutions was to im-
prove system data accuracy.
This information is used by the MRP sytstem to indicate what, when,
and how much to purchase. “We discovered that any inaccuracies in this in-
formation could affect supplier on-time delivery by requiring suppliers to
perform to unrealistic demands, due dates, and lot quantities,” according to
Leer.
One focus area was the planning data ﬁelds. “In our system, these were
only reviewed in emergency situations,” Leer offered. “We identiﬁed the
critical planning data ﬁelds in our MRP system that control how our MRP
system determines demand and suggests supply of material.” A new proce-
dure was written to review these critical planning ﬁelds annually.
Purchase lead times were another area rarely reviewed in the system.
It was up-
dated only when suppliers called, advising that lead time was increasing.
However, it was never adjusted back when lead times decreased.
“We identiﬁed lead time in our system as purchase lead time and safety
lead time,” the presenters explain. Purchase lead time was deﬁned as the num-
ber of days needed to issue, build, and ship an order to our dock. Safety lead
time is the number of days needed to receive, inspect, and release the order.
Supplier input required to develop lead-time data.
“We contacted all suppliers
to determine the number of business days they required to build and ship all
items,” they explain. “We told suppliers they were required to inform us of
any change in lead time immediately and that we were going to measure
their conformance to this lead time,” according to Daniel. The time required
to issue a PO was set to ﬁve days for all components.
Safety lead time was determined by joint meetings with purchasing and incoming
quality control.
It included the time needed to receive the part, inspect the
part, perform laboratory analysis, and release the part.
Case Studies of Success
891

“We set safety lead time by part family since inspection time was similar
by family,” he explains. These part families were commodity package items,
printed package items, primary containers, and raw materials.
Review of open purchase orders ﬁnds many past due.
“We also analyzed our
open purchase orders and found at least 25% had due dates that were more
than ﬁve days past due,” Daniel notes. 
They developed a report to track the number of purchase orders with
due dates greater than ﬁve days past due. This is generated weekly. “We also
made a requirement to update purchase order due dates in the system im-
mediately upon notice of any delivery date change,” Leer said.
Another weak link: inaccurate bills of material.
“BOM accuracy was excellent
for established and stable manufactured items,” they note. However, new
bills and changes to bills were not created nor updates until about two weeks
before the product was scheduled to run in production.
It was decided that the new bills and changes to bills had to get into the
system ASAP. “This was accomplished by educating the plant on the need
for accurate and timely BOM updates and by transferring the ownership of
the BOM to individuals closer to the changes,” he describes.
Working on supplier relationships meant major changes.
After the plant began
maintaining a stable schedule and consistently meeting it, and after purchas-
ing also had corrected all their data and processes, it was time to begin work-
ing with the suppliers. The approach included improved supplier commu-
nication. Key suppliers were brought into the Lilly plant for a presentation
on the goals and a review of the recent internal process changes. The dis-
cussion focused on how the changes could beneﬁt the supplier and on the
supplier’s role in helping Lilly to achieve its goals. 
A letter was sent to all suppliers outlining the 95% on-time delivery goal.
In it,
the effort to reach MRP Class A, and the key measures that would be im-
plemented was discussed. Further, the suppliers were notiﬁed they would be
provided with an 18 month planning forecast, more stable schedules, and
fewer orders placed within the lead time.
• Moving toward strategic sourcing. Strategic sourcing, at Lilly, is a corpo-
rate initiative. The intent is to provide two suppliers for all primary contain-
ers. According to Daniel, primary containers include items that “touch” the
892
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

product. “Contracts were established with our strategic suppliers specifying
lead times, delivery requirements and quality requirements,” Daniel de-
tailed. Penalties were noted for poor quality and/or poor delivery perfor-
mance. To further develop relationships, quarterly review meetings with all
strategic suppliers are scheduled.
• Creating a supplier planning report. “Our suppliers had little knowledge
of upcoming ﬁrm orders and forecasts,” he explains. “It was, therefore, very
difﬁcult for them to maintain stated lead times and delivery requirements.”
A report was developed listing all suggested and ﬁrm purchase orders. This
report is sent to all suppliers quarterly. Strategic suppliers also are given ap-
proval to buy raw materials for ﬁrm and suggested orders three months out.
“This ensures that lead times are met,” maintains Daniel.
• Changing supplier behavior. Historically, the suppliers seldom called re-
garding late orders. “Our goal was to change this behavior, by meeting with
suppliers and communicating our expectations,” he explained. “We re-
inforce our expectations by calling suppliers on every order that was due the
following week,” he declared. “Our intent was to continue calling on every
order until suppliers had demonstrated a change in behavior.”
“After improving data in our system and developing good supplier rela-
tions, on-time delivery was improved,” Daniel concluded. “When both par-
allel improvement paths were completed, the 95% on-time supplier delivery
became a reality.”

Raising suppliers’ performance level can ultimately have a huge effect on
your customers. But getting their performance up can sometimes mean tak-
ing the drastic step of extending your management techniques into their op-
erations.
Introducing supplier kaizen.
Supplier kaizen is a method of bringing suppli-
ers to the same level of operations as the parent company, through training
and improvement projects, to ensure superior performance and nurture the
trust required for strong partnerships.
Sikorsky Aircraft (Stratford, Conn.) developed a new supply base
Case Studies of Success
893

management system that “created internal and external ratings and targeted
an ambitious improvement in the supply base,” according to Catherine R.
Forman, CPIM, and David H. Vargas, CPIM, both project leaders, agile
manufacturing department. 
Two years later, the company realized the supply base would not pro-
gress at the rate desired and it established a group to conduct supplier kaizen.
Over 40 suppliers in eight different commodities have gone through the
program.
S2000 supplier certiﬁcation program.
The program was created to develop a
world-class, continuously improving supplier base, to bring the supplier base
to the “right size” and to improve suppliers’ quality, delivery, lead time, and
cost metrics. A manual was written describing the attributes of a world-class
supplier.
“Suppliers submitted a self-assessment of their internal capabilities, or
were audited by a Sikorsky team, which were scored against others in their
commodity group,” Forman and Vargas explained at a recent APICS Annual
International Conference. Suppliers also were rated on their quality, deliv-
ery, and responsiveness performance to Sikorsky. Every year suppliers are
given an overall assessment and rated as “basic,” “advanced,” or “world-
class.”
Supplier kaizen at work.
“We deﬁne kaizen as ‘making people’s jobs easier
by taking them apart, studying them, and making improvements,’” explains
Forman. A “kaizen event” is a focused activity that uses a dedicated team to
improve a process in a short period.
To date, 40 events have been conducted. They have resulted in millions
of dollars of savings on multiyear contracts and substantial lead-time reduc-
tions (see sidebar).
“The kaizen events have either jump-started a new continuous im-
provement program, or served to energize programs already in place,” Var-
gas shares. Another important aspect has been to improve relationships with
the suppliers, establishing contacts for further communication and problem
solving.
There is no set form for a supplier kaizen.
They have ranged from a two-day
business process event, to a week-and-a-half manufacturing event that built
cells, and a series of events that addressed both technical and lean manufac-
turing issues. However, every event follows the same four steps: 
894

Examples of Sikorsky’s Kaizen Events
•
Sikorsky’s Overhaul and Repair Center needed a 30-day turnaround
to support its customers. The repair work at an electronic supplier was six
months. The team, made up of the agile team representative, the buyer, and
the planner, spent three days with their counterparts at the supplier. They did
an analysis of the interface between Sikorsky and the supplier in the ordering
process and found that details were not ordered until after the teardown eval-
uation was complete, pricing agreed to by Sikorsky, and a purchase order
placed. The team developed a long-term agreement with standard pricing,
and the supplier committed to stock the detail components. The team also
streamlined the evaluation and quoting process at the supplier. Lead time was
cut to 40 days.
•
Quotes from a sheet metal supplier were 60% over target. They
claimed to be losing money at the previous price. The kaizen was conducted
in two weeks, one to improve the forming of the details and the other to im-
prove assembly. The ﬁrst reduced setups, eliminated unnecessary inspections,
and improved workplace organization. The second created shop aids for as-
sembly, eliminated defects passed to assembly from time, and decreased the
testing required for spot welding. The price was brought down to 10% over
target.
•
A servo had been on the short-to-load list for over a year. The Kaizen
team did a two-day investigation visit, where they analyzed the whole pro-
cess and identiﬁed multiple problems with the casting. Several meetings with
the casting supplier resolved the defects. A week-long kaizen at the servo sup-
plier focused on improving and standardizing the machining setups to make a
good part ever time. Scrap dropped to zero from 35% and the supplier is no
longer delinquent.

stresses. “The agile team works with the buyers, commodity team leaders,
and managers at every step in the process.”
Suppliers are selected for a kaizen event by purchasing managers along
with the commodity team leaders. “Only those the commodity team has de-
cided to develop are candidates for kaizen, except when the part cannot be
re-sourced and there is a critical problem with that supplier,” according to
Vargas.
Event planning.
There are two essential elements to ensure a successful
kaizen event:
• Identifying an opportunity area which, if improved, will affect the
objective
• Gaining the support and enthusiasm of the supplier’s management for
an event
At the site visit, the agile team introduces kaizen and lean manufactur-
ing principles, explains the objectives set by purchasing, reviews the sup-
plier’s continuous improvement activities, and takes a plant tour, “walking
the process” for a typical Sikorsky part.
Sikorsky and the supplier select project areas that could be resolved in a
kaizen event. “Frequently, to get supplier support and to develop trust, an
event will cover both the areas of opportunity identiﬁed by the supplier as
problems with their interface with Sikorsky, and the areas of opportunity the
agile team identiﬁes in the supplier’s internal processes,” Forman describes.
If the supplier agrees to engage in kaizen with Sikorsky, a project plan is
written that formalizes
• Opportunities to be addressed by the kaizen
• Scope of the project
• Targets for improvement
• Date of the event
At the same time, the buyer prepares a memorandum of agreement that
commits the supplier to
• Share the savings that result from the kaizen
• Develop a continuous improvement plan for the company
896
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

• Designate a continuous improvement leader
• Conduct follow-up on kaizen events
The supplier also identiﬁes a team roster sent to Sikorsky for review. It
is recommended to the supplier that the leader of the supplier team be the
person who will be responsible for the supplier’s continuous improvement
program. Also, the team should represent a cross-section of the company,
process owners, and “outside eyes.”
• Supplier kaizen should not be limited only to improving manufac-
turing processes. Substantial savings in lead time are usually found in busi-
ness processes and in the interface between the companies.
• In all events, the principles of lean manufacturing and waste elimina-
tion must be taught. The most important beneﬁt of supplier kaizen is the
long-term commitment to continuous improvement and to partnering with
Sikorsky in future growth.

Have you ever dreamed of how efﬁcient it would be if purchasing was in
charge of inventory and quality control, coordinating all aspects of materi-
als management? Here’s how one materials manager turned this dream into
reality.
Lifetime Products, Inc., Basketball Division (Clearﬁeld, Utah), experi-
enced exceptional growth. Not an unusual situation, but it created a fast-
paced, “get it built, get it shipped” environment. Unfortunately, with this
success also came a multitude of problems, according to John W. White, for-
mer materials manager.
The materials department was no exception.
The materials department had been
organized in a fairly traditional manner: Purchasing and stores were separate
and distinct departments, with both managers reporting to the general man-
ager. Inventory stores was led by a manager who had two inventory supervi-
sors reporting to her. And quality assurance was completely independent of
purchasing and inventory control and reported to the general manager.
The purchasing manager was responsible for a team of four buyer/
Case Studies of Success
897

planners, who each purchased a speciﬁc commodity. The metals buyer pur-
chased steel tubing, stampings, steel sheet, and steel round bar. The packag-
ing buyer was responsible for everything in packaging the products, includ-
ing corrugated material, polystyrene foam, printed labels, stretch wrap, and
pallets.
The plastics buyer brought in small injected molded parts, large blow-
molded parts, and ﬁberglass and acrylic basketball backboards. The hard-
ware/miscellaneous buyer brought in everything else, including inks, hard-
ware, basketball nets and basketballs, White, now materials manager, Alpha
Technologies (Bellingham, Wash.) shared details at a recent APICS Annual
International Conference. Together, they spent approximately $45 million
supporting the production line.
Initial attempts at improving the situation were not sustainable over the long haul.
The materials department seemed to have only one mandate: “Whatever
you do, don’t run out of material,” The warehouses were bulging at the
seams, and material was brought in by the truckload. “Unfortunately, much
of the material was not needed and material shortages were completely out
of control,” according to White.
In keeping with its philosophy of delivering product on time and at any
cost, Lifetime’s management began allocating the needed resources to the
materials department. “People were hired and fundamental materials man-
agement disciplines were put in place,” White described. Signiﬁcant im-
provement was made in a relatively short time. However, the department
was ﬁnding it more difﬁcult to get to the next level.
Determining what the interrelationships are all about.
The materials group de-
cided to take a step back and look at the relationships between purchasing,
inventory control, and quality control. “We found their ability to individu-
ally succeed was directly related to their ability to work together, to keep
their departments’ long-term visions in harmony, and to maintain sound dis-
ciplines in each of their areas,” White described. Following are some of the
interrelationships that were uncovered:
• Purchasing relies heavily on inventory accuracy to manage buying
and planning properly.
• Purchasing needs to catch poor quality material at the receiving dock,
not the production ﬂoor.
898
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

• Purchasing must have quick feedback and accurate documentation
whenever out-of-spec material is found on the receiving dock.
• Purchasing wants assurance that correct receiving speciﬁcations are in
place and receiving is using them correctly.
• Purchasing needs inventory control to do inventory transactions on a
real-time basis, all the time.
• Inventory control relies heavily on purchasing to provide accurate
inventory forecasts to plan space and resource requirements.
• Inventory control relies on purchasing to enforce suppliers to bring
in material ﬁt-for-use, including standardized containers, correct quantities,
and correct paperwork.
• Both inventory control and quality control want assurances that qual-
ity issues with suppliers get the appropriate attention.
Placing purchasing at the head of the new materials organization.
“Our conclu-
sion was that we needed synergistic management,” explains White. To syn-
ergize the materials organization, they took the former four basic com-
modities and created four procurement teams. 
Each team would be responsible for the entire materials function for
their speciﬁc commodity: sourcing, engineering design assistance and con-
sultation, planning, buying, receiving, storing, issuing to production, and
raw material quality.
Purchasing agents were in a natural position to coordinate materials
functions and were designated commodity material managers. Most buyers
had actually managed storerooms at one time and were most familiar with
the entire process.
“By accepting all the responsibility for raw materials from the time it left
R&D until it hit the production ﬂoor, purchasing could, at least in theory,
control its own destiny,” White explained. “We convinced Lifetime’s steer-
ing committee the strategy would work, and they gave us the approval to re-
organize both the purchasing and inventory control departments.”
The quality department was dismantled and completely restructured.
The new raw material quality coordinator reports to the materials director
and supports commodity teams. The inventory control manager position
was eliminated.
New materials department eliminates “us against them” mindset.
Having buyers
now acting as materials managers allowed for several things to happen.
Case Studies of Success
899

“Changes in how we did anything within the department could be made
immediately,” allows White. “Communication was quicker and more use-
ful.”
Also, direction was consistent among the disciplines. “It created the ‘we’
environment, and more importantly, it allowed buyers to make changes in
other areas that signiﬁcantly impeded on their ability to succeed and ensured
that stores and quality were getting the attention from purchasing that was
due,” he detailed.
Another signiﬁcant advantage to implementing the commodity pro-
curement teams is how they align with Lifetime’s core technology improve-
ment teams. These teams consist of representatives from engineering, pro-
duction, materials, and quality that meet regularly to work together for
improvement within a commodity.
“Both production and engineering have felt the positive effects of hav-
ing a more focused and specialized materials department,” White explains.
“All material questions and concerns now are addressed by one person,
which allows for a quicker and more informed response. It also allows ma-
terials to fairly represent themselves in decisions that affected stores and pur-
chasing.
The new management philosophy is working—and how!
Since implementing
this new strategy, Lifetime has been able to capitalize on many signiﬁcant
improvements. “We have reduced the number of materials managers from
four to three by merging commodities together,” offers White. Also, they
have reduced the number of warehouse personnel by 18. “Meanwhile, our
level of support to both production and engineering increased signiﬁcantly,
and we maintained or improved all existing materials measurements includ-
ing increasing inventory accuracy to 99%,” he details.
Most positive effect is in how materials people have increased their understanding of
the materials ﬂow process.
“They now see the big picture,” he declares. For
example, materials managers now understand that by buying parts as a stan-
dard they can have them delivered in containers of 100, which not only will
make it easier for receiving to inspect and inventory to cycle count, but also
will allow for easier handling and storage. In addition, it just happens to be
the exact quantity that production requested to most efﬁciently support
their line.
“Everyone within the commodity procurement teams now has a better
understanding as to how the team affects the bottom line,” maintains White.

“The materials manager now can easily explain why decisions are made and
more importantly, can easily access input on decisions from those closest to
the problem.”

Porter-Cable Corporation, a division of Pentair, Inc., like many other man-
ufacturing organizations, is sharing planning information with its suppliers.
However, there is a difference in their approach. They have also transferred
the scheduling responsibility to suppliers, requiring them to meet an actual
need date, rather than the traditional PO due date. The process seldom re-
quires calling the supplier to expedite an order. Also, it reduces the buyers’
involvement in day-to-day scheduling activities. Company ofﬁcials believe
that as this new program matures, they will realize substantial savings in ex-
pediting and schedule follow-up and buyers will be able to focus more time
on value-added sourcing. 
Creation of the supplier advanced scheduling report.
“We present the MRP de-
tail normally seen and used by the production planners directly to the sup-
plier,” explains Dan G. Salley, CFPIM, production control manager. “The
responsibility of meeting the detailed schedule date is now the suppliers’.”
To assist this movement of responsibility, they developed a new sched-
uling tool. The supplier advanced scheduling report (see Table III-3.4) is the
direct output of the ﬁnal assembly/master schedule, netted against on-hand
inventory and time-phased to indicate the exact date the material is needed
in assembly. In essence, it provides a summary of all parts required from the
supplier.
“The report is printed at the beginning of each week after the MRP re-
generation and on demand,” Salley told a recent APICS Annual Interna-
tional Conference. It contains the supplier’s number, name, and the main
contact at the supplier with their fax number.
The buyer/planner reviews the report before faxing it to the supplier.
This ﬁrst re-
port is simply a summary listing of all parts purchased from that supplier,
with a requirement in the next 12 shop days. A table is set up at the
item/supplier master level to load pieces per box, box size, how many boxes
ﬁt on a skid, and how many pallet positions a skid takes up in a trailer.
Case Studies of Success
901

Table III-3.4
Supplier Advanced Scheduling Report Format and Trailer Loading Report Format

This item master information is referenced next to the part number and
description of each line item. The last receipt date for this part and its quan-
tity is pulled from the purchase order history to give all parties a common
reference point when discussing or reviewing the report.
The planned receipt line from the traditional MRP planning grid is
printed to the right of the appropriate part number. This represents the ﬁnal
assembly requirements in the speciﬁc quantity and date due in the ﬁnal as-
sembly area.
Trailer loading report evolves from the advanced scheduling report.
A second re-
port has been developed, the supplier advanced scheduling trailer loading re-
port (see Table III-3.4). This worksheet contains the same information as the
summary sheet with the addition of the calculations for trailer loading. The
planner does the math. “This report can be used either by the production
control group for lot sizing, or by a warehouse/shipping group for order
picking and ﬁlling,” Salley describes the process. 
Some of Porter-Cable’s suppliers build-to-stock. They use the blanket
ordering information to schedule their shop or suppliers, and “merely use
[their] ﬁnal loading report to complete the order process,” he notes.
Using the item master information, the bare requirement is sized to
match either the box quantity or the skid quantity as a lot size, he explains.
The logic in the system is arranged to look at whether there is a box or skid
quantity loaded at the item master level. If there are both, the skid quantity
is the minimum lot size. If there is only the box quantity, then it becomes
the minimum lot size.

The goal of many purchasing professionals is to develop a signiﬁcant strate-
gic sourcing capability by using the strength and diversity of cross-functional
teams. Unfortunately, most initiatives never realize their full potential, with
quite a few collapsing in absolute failure.
One exception to the “rule,” however, is the initiative and practice
developed by Steelcase Inc. (Grand Rapids, Mich.). Joseph Erba Jr., vice
president, sourcing and logistics management, observes, “We have become
a much more efﬁcient sourcing organization, and now have more people
trusting our ability to get things done.” For years, he admits, “Sourcing/
Case Studies of Success

purchasing was kind of like the lost cousin in Steelcase. Today we have more
people coming to us and asking for our services.”
Steelcase Leadership System, the genesis of the turnaround.
Steelcase had re-
turned to a process focus after three unsuccessful years of being a business
unit organization. “We again have functional groups (sales and marketing,
manufacturing, sourcing and distribution) but we focus on the process,
which is cross-functional,” Erba relates.
“We basically manage our organization using three key process areas,
with each process involving all of the different functions in the organiza-
tion,” he told a Supply Chain Forum presented by Institute for Industrial
Research (New York). 
Adaptive management process key to success.
“We have a policy team that sits
on top of the organization and that group of eight individuals establish the
strategy for the corporation, both short term and long term,” explains Erba.
“Where our process becomes unique is once the policy team sets those
strategies, it moves to the process management teams, which are based in the
horizontal process orientation groups.” These teams then take over and di-
rect all the initiatives we create during the course of the year.
“I am the leader of a number of different process teams, most of which
do not just include people from my group,” he notes. “Most often there’ll
be participation from manufacturing, the area I interface with quite a bit, but
also sales and marketing and product development.”
How the system works to create a supplier certiﬁcation process.
To provide an in-
sight into the workings of the process, Erba described how he applied its
principles to initiate a supplier certiﬁcation program.
When Steelcase “did not have a certiﬁcation process for our supplier
base,” he began, “ﬁguratively, we had 8,000 purchasing agents. Basically
everyone in the factory could make a decision to buy whatever they wanted
to buy. There wasn’t an awful lot of control,” he admitted.
Project gets off with a kaizen start.
The goal was to establish a supplier certi-
ﬁcation process to reduce disruption costs, improve on-time delivery, and
eliminate receiving inspection.
The process was initiated by the operations management team, which
included representatives from quality, sourcing, engineering, production
904
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

and inventory control, manufacturing and distribution. A kaizen group ini-
tiative was then launched.
“This is a high-intensity, dedicated group that came together for a week
to review the problem,” Erba describes. One of their outputs was to map out
a “should-be” and “as-is” situation. Due to the nature of the project, they
gave a midterm report to representatives of other functional groups that
would be affected by their recommendations. 
At the end of the week the group called in management and made their
presentation. The team’s plan received buy-in from the executives, however,
they ran into some problems using the tool.
What was learned when trying to put the supplier certiﬁcation process into place.
“The team process was a success,” Erba declared. However, “the implemen-
tation struggled because we did not have accountability of the functions
strictly deﬁned and assigned. We didn’t have the folks made accountable that
were to do the implementation. We didn’t put it into their individual ROIs
[responsibilities, objectives, indicators],” he detailed. ROIs are the annual
goals and responsibilities that are established once a year for every employee
within the organization.
Also, there was a conﬂict among functions, those who would carry out
the certiﬁcation process with the suppliers. “We came up with the sugges-
tions and gave them to the purchasing group to start with suppliers,” he ex-
plains.
However, since the purchasing group also had a number of projects in
which they were involved, the supplier certiﬁcation process kept being de-
layed.
“We initiated a corrective action project in which we completed a gap
analysis to decide where the problems were and undertook some corrective
actions,” Erba explained. “These steps took about six months to set up, but
we do have a successful supplier certiﬁcation now in place.
Introducing sourcing into new product development initiatives—another example.
Three years ago the sourcing group was given a signiﬁcant cost reduction
mandate: reduce material costs by $100 million over three years. 
“One of the critical areas, yet it was difﬁcult to resource product devel-
opment,” he admits. “Nevertheless it was important for us to be connected
to new product development.”
Unfortunately, while sourcing had this major cost reduction mandate,

Steelcase was in the throes of developing a major new product that required
a lot of sourcing support.
Getting the suppliers involved on the team.
“We put a small team of people
from marketing, industrial design, product engineering, manufacturing
engineering, quality, and sourcing/materials management together and co-
located them with the product development team,” he details. “They were
to coordinate all sourcing activities.”
Additionally, several key suppliers were asked to join the team and be-
come involved. They were asked to do things that the supply base was not
asked to do before: provide ﬁnished goods to customers directly from their
location.
Deliverables generally met, but a new sourcing role had to be created.
“The sourc-
ing team did a good job of supplying their internal customers, and most of
the deliverables were met,” he offers. While the sourcing team became in-
tegrated into the product team, it had become disconnected from the pro-
curement team. The result was that supplier selection and supplier manage-
ment activities became disjointed.
This experience led to the creation of a new role within the sourcing or-
ganization, advanced sourcing. “It’s part of the supplier development team.
We now have four individuals assigned to advanced sourcing. Their job is to
stay linked with product development and bring back appropriate informa-
tion to the procurement group,” according to Erba.
What about the $100 million cost reduction mandate?
By the end of Steelcase’s
three-year time frame, Erba reports his group not only met, but it exceeded
the $100 million cost reduction target—by $3 million. Again, this was the
result of another cross-functional team effort, one which also relied on the
supplier community. The team had a mandate to create a structured cost re-
duction process, which it did.
Continually Advance Supplier Excellence (CASE) was the outcome.
The program was designed to aid Steelcase suppliers in identifying cost
reduction activities. “This was a very cross-functional team, from sourcing,
manufacturing, and suppliers,” Erba reports. “It’s also an ongoing process
and we involve the suppliers right up front and set performance objectives.”
Most of the projects to achieve the $103 million in cost reduction have
come out of the CASE initiative. “It wasn’t from deeper price discounts or
cheaper products,” he asserts, “it was working through product teardowns
906
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

and having suppliers, even competing suppliers, tear a part or product apart
and tell us how we can build it more competitively. Also, initiating process
improvements and single sourcing on a lot of our products.” 
Steelcase’s total manufacturing purchasing budget is $500 million. In
three years they saved over 20% of that, by developing strategic sourcing
techniques through cross-functional teams.

Today, the Dun & Bradstreet purchasing organization is a lean operation
that also is a major contributor to the corporation’s bottom line. The de-
partment now manages fewer than 3,000 suppliers, down from 8,600 only
four years ago. More important, they have developed preferred relation-
ships with about 100 key suppliers. As a result, the purchasing staff now
consists of just 14 individuals versus 70 a few years ago, of which 80% were
clerical.
“We also generated savings of $8.3 million, which added three cents in
earnings per share to the corporation’s bottom line,” asserts Douglas F.
Greene, global purchasing director, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation
(Purchase, NY; 914-933-3195). 
Additionally, at 18 focused suppliers, paper invoices are down from
86,000 three years earlier to zero today. Also, they have automated 506,000
transactions. And, while the P-card now is used for 16,000 transactions, POs
have been taken down from 55,000 four years ago to less than 2,000 within
three years.
Key to change: having the courage to look at purchasing critically and honestly.
“To
unlock the value of our purchasing function we had to have the ‘courage to
critique,’” he offered. “And we did.”
Describing the former situation at an NAPM-NY Annual Purchasing
Executives’ Symposium, Greene put it rather bluntly: “The whole thing was
an uncoordinated mess—and a model of inefﬁciency.”
The startling transformation becomes a textbook case of reorganization and refocus.
“In our own house we found the tools for identifying problems, extracting
opportunities, and yielding actionable information by putting data into con-
text,” Greene relates. “I ordered our own medicine. We took the data tools
Case Studies of Success
907

and analytics for which D&B is known, along with the vendor information
resident in our database, and we turned it all inward on ourselves.”
The change juggernaut gathers momentum.
“Once we decided to change, we
resolved to go all the way,” Greene insists. “We centralized the purchasing
function and created a single mindset with shared values and objectives.”
“We did some aggressive and unconventional things, like looking where
we could add value by getting into areas that we had never before been in,”
he offers. “We went to marketing and suggested they consolidate ad agen-
cies. We talked about consolidating all travel.” 
They listened. Today, the 265 travel agencies have been reduced to one.
Introducing cross-functional teams.
“We formed, for the ﬁrst time, cross-
functional teams that merged business and functional experts,” he explains.
“We brought the sides together, and we rationalized the requirements and
supply.”
This enabled purchasing to manage total costs, and to negotiate higher
levels of quality and service, based on the “real” needs of the team members.
“We also worked with the business units to learn where outsourcing might
be appropriate.” 
The quest to become a center of value creation.
They established that a three-
prong approach converted purchasing into a value creator. The individual
elements include the following:
1. Taking costs out of the procurement process. Underpinning this effort is the
ongoing effort to dissect and understand the components of cost. “Not just ac-
quisition price, but organizational costs like headcount, operating budgets, the
ﬁnancial demands of management focus, efﬁciency and information,” Greene
itemizes. “We also investigated process costs, like acquisition and payment
processes, research time, the cost of noncompliance, and the ability to gather
information.” They looked to capture hidden costs, too, focusing on quality
and service levels, cycle times, supply and maintenance costs, insurance—
effectively all the costs associated with owning and managing assets.
“We discovered that innovations in purchasing can reduce cost,” Greene
declared. For example, new acquisition and payment processes can reduce
bureaucracy and transactions, contract terms and conditions can reduce ex-
posures, and better relationships with suppliers foster trust, innovation and
investment.”
908
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

2. Establishing innovative supplier relationships. “We sought agreements
with best-in-class suppliers so they would invest in us in unconventional
ways,” Greene offered. This played out as automated billing practices, qual-
ity and service initiatives, and in continuous, measurable improvement.
Further, purchasing staffers set out to improve quality and service levels
and brought suppliers on site to help them. 
“We also negotiate contracts that protect us from hidden risks,” he ex-
plains. “Our temp agreement comes with insurance provisions. Our reloca-
tion contracts come with environmental indemniﬁcation. We have service
level guarantees.” 
Additionally, they have incorporated electronic feeds into D&B’s bud-
get software so department managers get “better information, more quickly,
so they can manage their budgets,” he allows.
3. Communicating results, expectations, and requirements. “We also moved
to master the art of the relationship, to strengthen the way we form, im-
prove, and measure them,” he maintains. “And I don’t mean just relation-
ships with suppliers, but also with employees and the business units.”
As an example, he advises, “Senior management understands earnings
per share. So if you can put your achievements in that context, or relate it to
the bottom line in any way, you’ll ﬁnd a universal language that communi-
cates well.”
Greene also boasts of his current staff: “We’re a stronger department be-
cause they’re the right fourteen. They’re aggressive, creative, well trained,
and not satisﬁed with the status quo.”

Purchasing professionals do a commendable job of measuring Tier 1 sup-
plier performance. However, the system tends to break down with the sub-
tier suppliers. Recognizing this situation, Harley-Davidson Motor Com-
pany (Wauwatosa, Wis.) initiated a new process that called for participation
of Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers. 
“The reality today is we deal closely with Tier 1 suppliers in our busi-
nesses. We measure their performance, we work with them, and we see
them,” explains Leroy Zimdars, CPM, director of development purchasing
(414-616-1757). “However, we don’t talk to the Tier 2 and 3; neither do the
Case Studies of Success
909

Tier 1 suppliers, in a lot of cases.” And as Zimdars has experienced, “The
problems we have in launching a new product are not from Tier 1 suppliers,
but somebody downstream.”
A disappointing beginning, but a valuable lesson learned.
Years ago, Zimdars
developed a presentation to train Harley-Davidson’s suppliers in how to de-
velop an effective value chain. They hosted a conference for their primary
suppliers.
“We also had each Tier 1 supplier invite its major Tier 2 supplier to the
same conference. At the meeting, we challenged each one, in each value chain,
to come back with one area of improvement that they were going to work on
over the next year,” he told an NAPM Supply Chain Management Confer-
ence. The result was: “We gave them the tools, and we trained them,” he ex-
plained. “But they didn’t work together because they didn’t have alignment and
there wasn’t anyone driving them to become value-added as a chain.”
Piloting a new concept that creates trust in a value chain.
Harley-Davidson is
leading the pilot for the trust-building and cooperation module of the
National Initiative of Supply Chain Integration (NISCI; Chicago; www.
NISCI.org) supply chain integration process (see Figure III-3.2). NISCI
helps member businesses research and develop ways to optimize the perfor-
mance of supply chains between three or more trading partners. 
Two modules (measuring chain economic performance and architec-
ture for consensus decisions), also in the pilot stage, are led by other charter
910
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T
Figure III-3.2
NISCI’s Supply Chain Integration Process

member companies of NISCI. Pilots for the remaining three are planned for
the future. 
“I’m assigned to the trust-building and cooperation module, and we be-
lieve that’s the entry into the entire supply chain process,” Zimdars explains.
“Companies that don’t know who their value chain members are often don’t
trust them. That’s the issue we’re dealing with and how we believe you come
into the process.”
In this particular chain are Harley-Davidson and its Tier 1 supplier of
die castings (Aallied Die Casting Co. of Illinois; Franklin Park, Ill.), along
with the Tier 2 suppliers who do the plating and polishing (Southwest Metal
Finishing Co.) and provide the die and tooling (Ram Tool, Inc.) for the
casting. “This value chain produces every chrome-plated casting for our
engines,” according to Zimdars. “We don’t want parts, we want jewelry,” he
said in describing the demand the suppliers must meet.
Cooperation Day, and the detailed work begins.
A good deal of preparation is
necessary before Cooperation Day. For instance, the champion for the chain
is selected. Zimdars chose Scott Torphy, manager of administration at Aal-
lied Die Casting (847-455-1950).
Also, the “mandate” team members are identiﬁed. For this particular
chain, Harley-Davidson representatives come from purchasing, design, pro-
duction, ﬁnance and sales. The supplier mandate team also has representa-
tion from matching areas. Overall, the team has 21 team members. 
Included in the prework activity is the determination of areas and activ-
ities the chain should work toward to achieve consensus decisions. Among
the topics to be ﬂushed out are program plans and timing, technology ac-
quisition and development, and integrated, concurrent design and manu-
facturing. Also included are opportunity scanning, competence sharing,
knowledge acquisition and development, resource utilization, and measure-
ment methods.
Meet once, then all follow up done via Internet.
Cooperation Day is the one
time that all members of the chain gather together. For many, it’s the ﬁrst
time they have met. During the day and a half they meet, smaller “links”
gather together to identify and discuss the concerns they have and the issues
they share. “About 90% of the issues get identiﬁed,” according to Zimdars,
and “it’s done in a very nonconfrontational manner.” The chain members
look at these issues to ﬁnd a common thread for which they can offer im-
provement and from which each can beneﬁt. 
Case Studies of Success
911

Getting to the speciﬁcs.
“Each link then has an assignment, on which the
members must work when they get back to their individual work sites,” Tor-
phy explains. The “links” identiﬁed operating goals such as
• Reduce rejected parts by 50% at all inspection areas
• Shorten cycle time by 30%
• Reduce amount of waste by 20% of the total cost
• Ensure that the commitment for the business is long enough to pay
back the costs of investment
Building Internet competence is critical.
“Once Cooperation Day is over, all of
the work, communication between and among the teams, and status reports
are done via the Internet,” Torphy explains. Therefore, they spent about
three hours having the team members “surf the net” to become familiar with
the chain’s Web site structure, features and operation. It’s just the beginning,
but Harley-Davidson believes it’s on the right track in aligning their supply
chains and moving them in a positive direction.

Sequent Computer Systems, Inc. (Beaverton, Ore.), has separated its sourc-
ing organization into a strategic side and a tactical side. The strategic sourc-
ing process focuses on long-term supplier relationships and corporate supply
chain goals. The tactical side of the house handles day-to-day execution of
supply chain deliverables. The strength and uniqueness of the reorganiza-
tion, however, are in its application. 
Separating strategic logistics from tactical logistics.
“On the strategic side, world-
wide strategic sourcing manages the logistics supplier strategies, provides
leadership to the logistics team, and develops service and repair supplier
strategies,” explains Martha (Marti) H. McMahon, worldwide logistics man-
ager (503-578-7580). 
On the tactical side, some activities (see Figure III-3.3) report through
worldwide manufacturing while the balance go through customer service
or international subsidiaries. The organizational structure is similar for pro-
curement. 
912
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

Figure III-3.3
Sequent’s Logistics Organizational Structure

The strategic management of all suppliers comes under worldwide
strategic sourcing, McMahon’s organization. Meanwhile, the tactical activ-
ities (order placement, JIT delivery management) are within the worldwide
manufacturing organization. “The reorganization now enables us to focus
on the strategic relationships and, in our case, the logistics road maps much
more effectively,” she explains.
Logistics strategy developed through a commodity team.
“We run our logistics
strategy through a logistics commodity team,” McMahon explains. The
team has a manager who reports to her. Among the members of the team
are the corporate distribution manager, customer service logistics manager,
import staff, export staff, trafﬁc staff and McMahon, as worldwide logistics
manager.
“We frequently bring in consultant members from other organizations,
such as accounts payable, computer applications, warehouse staff, packaging
commodity manager, and international subsidiary logistics staff,” she offers.
Formal selection process, but few suppliers to choose from.
From a material man-
agement point of view, Sequent’s shipping proﬁle is primarily by air, with-
out ocean or rail transport. There is a little LTL. “We have a very narrow sup-
plier base with our logistics providers,” she noted at a Proven Performance
Metrics in Logistics Conference (Institute for International Research; New
York). “Our focus is to try to increase business with existing providers to
keep the number of providers limited.”
The formal supplier selection process begins with the request for quote
activity. “We try to keep this down to a very small selection base, often less
than ﬁve potential suppliers quoting,” McMahon describes. The commod-
ity team conducts the evaluation. In some cases the team is extended to in-
clude members from Sequent’s international subsidiaries. “In these cases
we’ve done the supplier selection process through video conferencing,” she
explains. Suppliers can make their presentations to an international audi-
ence, and international team meetings can also be conducted in this manner.
The evaluation process includes supplier presentations, and site visits:
“all pretty typical,” she notes. “We also use a weighted average point system
in making the assessment.”
One provider per type of service.
Sequent prefers this arrangement. Therefore,
it has one provider for each service, such as courier, international air freight
forwarder, heavyweight air carrier, and LTL provider. Also, small package air
914
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

domestic and international, third party logistic provider for warehousing
support service, and van lines.
“One beneﬁt of a limited supplier base is that it really minimizes sup-
plier management cost,” McMahon insists. “We focus our energy with the
supplier who has a major impact, instead of spreading ourselves over a large
supplier base.”
Logistics costs slashed by a third, and other beneﬁts.
A small supplier base also im-
proves the quality of supplier management, she attests. “When we initiated this
program, we brought our logistics costs down by over a third. We also entered
into multi-year agreements which have protected us from annual price in-
creases,” she details. Some of the agreements have extended out four years.
“We also have the beneﬁt of receiving special consideration from our
suppliers, which fall into a variety of categories,” she conﬁdes. As an ex-
ample, she mentioned the UPS strike. “There was no impact to our pickup
and delivery time.”
Further, with some of the suppliers Sequent serves as a beta site to prove
out a new technology. For instance, she tells of utilizing a new tracking sys-
tem that “wasn’t quite on board yet” for a supplier’s other customers.
Benchmarking long-term contracts.
“Our formal written, multiyear contracts
are typically for a period of three years,” McMahon describes. “We also
benchmark in the second year of the contract so we know that our rates are
still competitive within the marketplace. We try to be in the ﬁrst quartile of
the competitive pricing that we benchmark.”
Additionally, she admits “our contracts are lengthy in nature, as we try
to fully deﬁne the actual business relationship. This includes the metrics
we’ll be using, the types and frequency of meetings we’ll hold, and any cost
recovery elements. We try to put everything we can into the agreement, so
that if I’m not there, someone else can understand what’s happening in this
business relationship,” she explains.
Meetings scheduled with all suppliers.
“In our formal logistics supplier man-
agement process, we have regularly scheduled meetings with our providers,”
McMahon notes. “We produce an annual calendar each year that speciﬁes
when all meetings will be conducted.” This includes all quarterly reviews,
and the semi-annual executive performance reviews. 
“Here, our executives, often the vice president of strategic sourcing,
will meet with the appropriate supplier executives to discuss the state of our
Case Studies of Success
9 1 5

mutual business relationship,” she explains. Further, a report card is prepared
before the meeting. 
Performance metrics are developed in conjunction with the suppliers.
“We have
quarterly goals that are established for each metric. They are in writing and
agreed to by the suppliers and ourselves,” she explains. “We note the results
of each performance measure each quarter and rate each as ‘exceeded,’
‘met,’ or ‘did not meet expectations.’” Typically the report will have be-
tween 15 and 25 monitored expectations.
The logistics commodity team tracks the trends and documents all as-
pects of the relationship. In addition, the suppliers are asked to complete a
section of the report card on Sequent’s performance. 
Getting feedback from the supplier community always an interesting exercise.
How
are we doing as a customer for them? “We ask our suppliers to assess our per-
formance,” McMahon mentions. “However, this is a challenge for them.
Typically, they’re conservative and nervous expressing what they really
think.” 
McMahon and her team try to be supportive of the feedback process.
“We encourage them, and we frame the approach as, ‘What are we doing
that makes sense? What drives you crazy? How can we ﬁx it together?’” Af-
ter a slow start, she acknowledges that “we’re now starting to get meaning-
ful feedback from the suppliers.”
As a ﬁnal note, she offers, “I cannot emphasize how important it is to
overcommunicate with suppliers. You’re dealing with a different culture.
They’re outside the ﬁrm. The more you communicate, the better you’re go-
ing to get your message across and be successful together.”

Most purchasing managers make an effort to assess supplier quality, but few
have gone as far as Roberts Sinto Corporation (Lansing, Mich.). They are es-
tablishing a quality system that is QS 9000 compliant and looking for their
supplier base to join them on the journey. A signiﬁcant part of this initiative
requires suppliers to complete a survey proﬁling their quality documentation
and methodology practices. has a copy of the survey (an excerpt of which ap-
pears in the sidebar), and commends Roberts Sinto for taking this action.
916
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

We consider it a thorough, well-conceived document. In fact, we would
recommend it as a model for other readers who are interested in helping
evaluate/improve their suppliers’ quality environment.
100% supplier response expected.
In an exclusive interview, Karl Dorr, qual-
ity manager (800-748-0384, ext. 1528), shared, “We will use this informa-
tion to classify the supplier’s quality level compared to a minimum standard
under QS 9000 requirements. Further, we also are prepared to help our sup-
pliers establish any improvement or corrective action processes that they re-
quire to achieve these new quality levels.”
He anticipates full cooperation from the supplier community. “Those
who don’t mail back the survey by the deadline will get phone call reminders
from us,” he explains. “We are looking for 100% cooperation.”
If they still do not respond, Dorr reveals, “we’ll alert the appropriate
people within Roberts Sinto of their lack of response, and advise them not
to place any additional business with that supplier. When the supplier is
eventually alerted to this reality, they ﬁll out that survey pretty quickly and
get it in to us,” he explained. 
A fair self-evaluation.
From previous experience with these type surveys,
Dorr anticipates receiving a “realistic” set of ratings that will enable him to
draw accurate proﬁles. “If anything, I have found the individual suppliers in
their self-evaluations to be harder on themselves than we would be if we
were auditing them,” he offers. 
The questions are self-explanatory, with plenty of examples.
The survey contains
nine sections, and each question is rated on a scale of zero to 5. As part of
the package, a scoring matrix is enclosed to help the supplier understand
how the survey will be scored and what expectations will be applied for the
partnering effort.

All of the efforts that purchasing professionals have put into forming supplier
partnerships and alliances over the past few years are ﬁnally paying off. This
is most evident in the many continuous improvement initiatives and the sup-
pliers’ role in them.
A top best practice—right from the beginning.
Ever since Supplier Selection and
Management Report began tracking the “creating new supplier partner-
ships” best practice in 1995, it has been one of the most used, always men-
tioned by about 40% of respondents. So it is no surprise that in the latest
survey purchasing professionals say that their supplier partners are very in-
volved with continuous improvement projects. Here’s what your col-
leagues report:
• “Through supplier partnerships we leverage our suppliers’ expertise
to help us improve our business,” states the procurement vice president at a
large manufacturer of medical products. “We have done this in several areas,
both in direct and indirect supplies, and have seen an improvement in our
bottom line. The lesson is to require trust and build on the successes.”
• “Our supplier partners learn our business inside and out and because
of this are able to provide us with value-added contributions for process im-
924

provements and cost reductions,” according to the purchasing director at a
large ﬁnancial services organization.
• “We use a supplier quality assurance process with our supplier part-
ners in which all of the stakeholders get together to identify redundant costs
and removal processes,” offers a director of strategic sources at a leading man-
ufacturer of ofﬁce supplies. “They meet quarterly to review cost improve-
ment targets.”
• “Supplier partnerships have helped us develop new products which
are not only lower in cost of procurement, but are also easier to use in man-
ufacturing,” according to the director of procurement at a food/beverage
manufacturer.
How supplier partners are helping in continuous improvement projects.
Almost
every respondent of the more than 150 survey replies received shared a “pos-
itive” story of how supplier partnerships/alliances are contributing to their
continuous improvement initiatives. The following are excerpts from some
of them.
Enroll suppliers into a focused supply chain value improvement program.
The sen-
ior procurement director at a large producer of consumer goods explains,
“Our procurement team has launched an initiative focused on the various
elements of the supply chain that qualify for waste elimination. It’s a long-
term business strategy for eliminating waste and growing value throughout
the supply chain.”
This is an outgrowth of another program in which suppliers were en-
couraged to make suggestions to reduce costs and improve value. “A thor-
ough understanding of cost drivers within our supply chain led our supplier
partners to make many valuable suggestions to what was one of the most
successful cost reduction initiatives we have had with our suppliers,” he re-
ports.
“Our goal for the new initiative is to work with the suppliers to deliver
a six percent year over year value improvement to the existing supply chain
system by removing waste from the process,” the senior director explains.
“The ideas and associated values developed by individual suppliers will be
reviewed by the respective executive management teams during their peri-
odic meetings. We will continue to share any and all supplier-initiated im-
provements with them on an equitable basis,” he continues.

Suppliers work hard at new technology to keep the existing business.
The pur-
chasing manager at a large builder of test equipment explains, “With all of
the competition out there, our current suppliers are working harder to
maintain our business through added value services.” One such activity she
notes is the redesign of a Web site by one of the suppliers to enhance the or-
dering process.
“The site also provides us with new ideas and alternative methods in our
product design, suggesting new solutions to internal and external processes,”
she explains.
Work with suppliers to save the cost of processing orders.
A purchasing agent at a
midsize pharmaceutical manufacturer has been working with suppliers to re-
duce the cost of processing orders. “One way was to develop an order form
for low-dollar items and place orders weekly, rather than daily, as some de-
partments did,” he explains.
Another supplier started an on-site storeroom that is managed by the
supplier. “This inventory belongs to the supplier until delivery to the end
user,” the purchasing manager explains. “Both of these programs are still be-
ing ﬁne-tuned, but have cut processing costs tremendously.”
Value engineering with the supplier community.
“Suppliers have gained a better
understanding of our true needs and we now understand what requirements
are driving costs and can be eliminated or modiﬁed,” explains the director of
materials at a small manufacturer of recreation equipment.
Quality improvements soar through closer supplier contact.
“By working closely
with our suppliers, we make them more familiar with what is acceptable ma-
terial,” explains a senior buyer at a small producer of biological safety cabi-
nets. “We have them come into our factory, and look at our manufacturing
processes, which then allows them to work on their quality issues.” She also
reports, “We have improved the quality of our product since the supplier has
improved their product. Our rework has been cut signiﬁcantly due to the
changes that have been implemented by the supplier community.”
Sharing information helps to align supply chain to optimize plant efﬁciencies.
“We
now routinely share data such as usage needs and production schedules with
the supply base,” maintains a procurement manager at a small provider of
suppliers to the utility industry. “Similarly, the supplier also shares their
926
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

schedules with us. By now knowing a supplier’s production schedule we can
make a better selection of a supplier to satisfy our future needs.”
Early supplier involvement means getting them involved in the design of new prod-
ucts.
The manager of supplier quality at a midsize maker of ﬂoor care prod-
ucts shares, “We involve our suppliers in the early stages of product devel-
opment. This allows them to offer suggestions that will reduce total scrap,
improve yields, and ensure the highest quality product,” she explains.
Greater visibility through supplier Web site a major improvement.
The applica-
tion-speciﬁc integrated circuits (ASIC) commodity manager at a large pro-
ducer of industrial controls reports, “Being able to view open order status
and inventory status real-time on one of our supplier’s Web sites has been a
very beneﬁcial continuous improvement initiative.”
Jointly focusing on the supplier’s quality brings beneﬁts to both companies.
“Our
partnership with a PCB [prototype circuit board] manufacturer enabled
them to develop quality programs with our inﬂuence, and from there they
have moved on to become qualiﬁed in most quality standards,” maintains a
senior planner/buyer at a large electronics manufacturer. One result has
been a signiﬁcant reduction in price as they have improved their yield many
times over.

The link between forming supplier partnerships and creating supply chains
is uncontested. However, although purchasing professionals are not the least
bit hesitant to forge new partnerships, they tend to resist taking the next step:
building them into supply chains.
Leading industry observers and top practitioners insist that it is a necessary move.
“In a world of global organizations, supplier partnership building has be-
come a critical skill,” declares Nancy Wendorf, program manager, Informa-
tion Security Systems and Products Division, Motorola (Scottsdale, Ariz.).
“Corporations that build strong supplier partnerships enhance their com-
petitive advantage by leveraging the capabilities of their supplier partners.”
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating
927

Mark K. Williams, CFPIM, consulting manager at the North High-
land Company (Atlanta, Ga.; mwilliams@north-highland.com) expands the
thought by stating, “To be truly efﬁcient and cost-effective, companies need
to form alliances with other companies so that all of their niches, when com-
bined, could form the links of a solid supply chain.”
Dave Garwood, president of R. D. Garwood, Inc. (Marietta, Ga.;
Garwoodofc@aol.com), dispels the myth that supply chain management is
only materials management. “Strategic alliances with suppliers to develop
true partnerships are a part of supply chain management,” he stated at Con-
gress for Progress XXV (sponsored by the Mid-Atlantic Chapters of
APICS). “While suppliers undergo tremendous changes from traditional bus-
iness practices, customers probably experience even larger changes as their
demands directly drive their suppliers’ schedules.”
Potential for losing control of the supply chain.
Jack Symon, CFPIM, CIRM,
CPM, Eisner Consulting (Somerville, N.J.), observes that many small and
midsize organizations “consider themselves too small and prefer to pass on
the supply chain management movement right now.” However, at Congress
for Progress XXV, he explained, “With the prevalence of the Internet and
the introduction of lower-cost, entry-level supply chain management solu-
tions, businesses of all sizes can begin to join the supply chain management
movement.” Failure to do so, he warns, may have consequences. “Most
likely many of your suppliers or customers will choose to implement a
supply chain management solution, and as a part of their supplier chain, you
will be assimilated.”
Supplier alliance characteristics the same that make for supply chain management suc-
cess.
Wendorf explains, “True strategic alliances are characterized by syn-
ergy, collaborative strategy development, sharing of beneﬁts and risks, joint
processes, working toward common goals, trust, long-term commitment,
increased information sharing, and effective and timely communication.”
Speciﬁc discussion points, included in a checklist, can help to differentiate
suppliers for this initiative (see sidebar).
Symon, taking this lead, provides his recipe for building a supply chain
that “survives and thrives.” It includes the following:
• Aligning your objectives to be in sync with your customers and sup-
pliers. “Look beyond just products to process improvement potentials to
create a ‘value chain’ and not just a supply chain,” he describes.
928
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

• Developing a shared vision and strategy upon which the supply chain
will operate.
• Developing a collaborative planning effort and being synchronized in
its execution.
• Sharing information instantaneously.

Twelve Talking Points for Moving Supplier Partnerships into
Your Supply Chain
1. Does the supplier understand the level of commitment required to
achieve the targeted gains in quality and cycle time, and does it have the
resources required to sustain that involvement?
2. Will the supplier be able to grow with us and to continue to offer im-
proved value in the future?
3. Does the supplier really have the necessary technical competence, and
will it be willing to contribute that expertise?
4. Does the supplier have a team approach to quality, purchasing, and pro-
duction and a positive attitude toward cooperation and collaboration, in-
cluding win-win negotiating?
5. Is the supplier’s senior management committed to the processes of coop-
eration, collaboration, and conﬂict-resolution required for strategic part-
nering? What have they done to demonstrate that commitment?
6. How much future planning is the supplier willing to share with us? Is
their management willing to share the necessary proprietary information
with us and, at the same time, treat our proprietary information in a con-
ﬁdential manner? Is there a fundamental level of trust in the relationship?
7. How well does the supplier know our business? Has its management
made the necessary investment of time and effort to become truly knowl-
edgeable about our operation and our problems?
8. Has the supplier demonstrated commitment in the past by willingness to
make necessary investments in plant, equipment, and other resources?
What has been the level of that commitment?
9. What will the supplier demand of us in return? What assurances and guar-
antees will this supplier require as a condition of partnering?
10. Who are the supplier’s key suppliers, and what can they contribute to the
ESI process?
11. Does the supplier have the technical expertise available in a time frame
appropriate to our requirements?
12. Who are the supplier’s technical experts who will be available to support
the design and manufacturing processes?

• Developing shared common systems and processes. 
• Developing common, effective performance measures.
• Striving for continuous improvement to maintain value in the supply
chain.
One important change: sharing of schedules.
“Purchasing professionals need to
change the way they do business and employ the tools of companies that
have been successful, tools which are critical to supply chain success,” Wil-
liams declared at Congress for Progress XXV. One of these tools is schedule
sharing.
“Sharing your schedule with the supplier provides the opportunity to
work with real demand, instead of a forecast,” he explains. “This also allows
the supplier to reduce the amount of ﬁnished goods safety stock on hand,
thereby reducing costs.” Williams also provided some guides for sharing
your schedule with suppliers.
“Meet with the supplier and impress on them that the information
you will be sharing with them is highly confidential,” he advises. “You
don’t want to have your schedule ending up in the possession of a com-
petitor.” Have the supplier sign a confidentiality agreement to reinforce
this goal.
With an MRP or an ERP system in place, purchasing professionals eas-
ily can generate requirements to the supplier. Williams notes the following:
• Segregate the requirements by supplier. This will form the basis of the
information that will be transmitted to the supplier.
• Determine how solid or ﬂuid the quantities and items are within the
company’s time fences. For example, if quantities are frozen within the ﬁrst
four weeks but subject to 25% to 50% swings from weeks four to eight, doc-
ument this information so that it can be discussed with the supplier.
• Meet with the supplier to review how the information is structured.
“Keep in mind that MRP may be a foreign concept to some of the suppli-
ers, so in-depth training may be needed for them to understand how to use
the information to help schedule their business,” Williams explains.
• The most effective schedule sharing agreements include a guarantee
from the customer that once an item is called for within the frozen time
fence, the supplier will purchase it. Suppliers will not be nearly as reluctant
to produce, and possibly customize, inventory for a customer that guaran-
tees it will be purchased. 
930
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

• Review seasonal trends and abnormal events such as vacation shut-
downs or special promotions with the supplier and obtain an agreement as
to how these special events will be handled.
• Determine how often and in what form the schedule will be trans-
mitted. Should it be sent daily, weekly, or monthly? And, should it be sent
via mail, fax, EDI, or e-mail?
In these times of change, supply chain management needs an integrated continuous
improvement process.
Karen L. Alber, CFPIM, director of business solutions
at Quaker Oats Company (Chicago), strongly emphasizes, “Companies
must continually evaluate the balance between their supply chain and cus-
tomer demand.” As an example, she cites the many changes that have taken
place in the consumer products industry. “Consumer demand has changed
signiﬁcantly over the past decade,” she notes. In addition to the demand-
creation opportunities the company generates through marketing activities,
there are simply more varieties requested by consumers.
Deﬁne the continuous assessment process.
“Based on the notion that most
supply chains were not originally designed to meet the demands being
placed upon them today, a company must identify where they must improve
to remain competitive,” Alber discussed at Congress for Progress XXV. “A
performance analysis needs to be conducted to see company performance
against current and future customer requirements.” A gap analysis will por-
tray where gaps are, and these can then be assessed against industry bench-
marks to understand the greatest areas of opportunity. Speciﬁcally, perfor-
mance measurements should be modiﬁed.
“Performance metrics should measure each area of the supply chain not
only on its own performance, but the impact of the other nodes in the supply
chain to guarantee supply chain synchronization versus silo management,”
she details. Garwood also mentions that “old yardsticks such as purchase price
variance, direct labor efﬁciency, equivalent utilization, and product develop-
ment budget performance are no longer adequate.” Instead, he suggests a new
set of metrics to motivate and reward the right behavior, such as quality of the
demand plans, which would replace forecast accuracy, and ﬂexibility instead
of lowest purchase price. Alber also stresses the requirement of information
availability. “There are customers that are demanding the use of improved
information technology in order to do business with them,” she explains.
“Companies must assess how to improve their internal information systems
as well as their ability to interact with their external partners to survive.”

Supply chain management promises to revolutionize they way business
is done. Therefore, as Williams concludes, “Purchasing managers must con-
tinue to lead the transformation of their companies into becoming solid links
in a strong supply chain.”

Many purchasing professionals have obtained impressive beneﬁts from closer
supplier relationships, while others have been frustrated in their efforts. Some
have found an effective way of collaborating with one speciﬁc supplier, which
is a disaster when attempted with another. However, a tool has passed the test
of consistently building working arrangements with external partners. It’s the
Joint Service Agreement (JSA). The purpose of a JSA is to describe in detail
the “responsibilities, expectations, and entitlements of each party to a client-
supplier agreement,” says Kate Fickle, director of Pittiglio Rabin Todd & Mc-
Grath (PRTM; Mountain View, Calif.; kﬁckle@prtm.com).
JSAs do not typically serve as the legal contract between customer and supplier.
Al-
though a JSA may resemble a business contract in length and format, Fickle
explains, “it’s drafted with ﬂexibility of action rather than rigid enforcement
of terms in mind.”
With a JSA, the signatories are not bound to actions or practices that
may suddenly become impractical or counterproductive due to changed
business circumstances. It grants each party the freedom of action to respond
to change for the beneﬁt of both parties.
JSAs are effective tools for cementing supplier-customer relationships.
Like any
good tool, JSAs should be used selectively where supplier-customer rela-
tionships are of high importance to both parties. Not every supplier contract
calls for a JSA, she notes. Since an agreement can take months to draft and
implement, it is generally impractical for a company to develop a JSA with
more than 15% to 20% of its suppliers.
Although the purchasing professional usually initiates the JSA with the
supplier, it is important that it does more than enumerate the customer’s re-
quirements. “The operative word in JSA is ‘joint,’” Fickle emphasizes. “The
more effective JSAs represent a real meshing of both the customer’s and the
supplier’s expectations.”
932
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

How the purchasing professional beneﬁts from a JSA.
Buyers can derive signif-
icant internal beneﬁts from JSAs:
• The development of a clear statement of the supplier relationship’s objectives.
In deﬁning how the supply chain will operate under the proposed JSA, it of-
ten becomes apparent that the different members of the customer team (pur-
chasing, planning, engineering, and management) have different, and some-
times conﬂicting, ideas about the basic purpose of the supplier relationship.
Across-the-board internal agreement on the supplier relationship’s over-
riding purpose is a vital precondition to drafting a viable JSA.
• The realization that certain business processes are not working properly. In the
course of the operational scrutiny during the JSA drafting stage, it is often
revealed that some business processes are not working as they should. The
work of ﬁxing these broken processes may take many months before JSA
discussions with the supplier can begin. But that work has to be done for the
company’s sake, she advises.
• It forms the foundation for training in supplier management. The third in-
ternal beneﬁt to the customer is that the core components of the JSA, those
that do not change signiﬁcantly from supplier to supplier, form the founda-
tion for cross-functional training in the area of supplier management. 
JSAs provide a foundation for an ongoing periodic review process.
One focus of
the typical JSA is to measure customer-supplier relationships continually.
These performance metrics can be the foundation for supplier scorecards.
“We must emphasize again that it’s a mistake to focus on supplier perfor-
mance to the exclusion of customer performance,” she declares. “When
both are examined from a qualitative and a quantitative standpoint, both the
customer and the supplier obtain more beneﬁt from the JSA.”
How does a JSA get done?
The supplier and customer, after agreeing in prin-
ciple that a JSA is in their mutual interest, proceed to outline the contents of
the agreement.
This is followed by a series of meetings to discuss the proposed content
of the JSA and deﬁne mutual performance objectives. “It often takes two or
three months before the JSA is signed, depending on the two parties’ level
of preparation and their prior familiarity with each other,” she offers.
“Most executives who have participated in JSA negotiations assert that
the face-to-face process of working out the agreement is ultimately more
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating

important to solidifying the relationship than the resulting JSA document,”
Fickle observes. As the representatives of the two companies work together
to deﬁne and resolve the obstacles to the JSA, they reach common under-
standings that form the real basis for the companies’ partnership.
“We’ve found that it is important to maintain the JSA through regular
management reviews,” she advises. Semiannual meetings have proved to be
the most effective forums for reviewing expectations, updating processes,
and discussing performance issues. However, more frequent opportunities
for informal communication must be maintained as the need arises.

Purchasing professionals establish relationships/alliances with particular sup-
pliers to reduce their supplier base, improve quality, and reduce the varia-
tions received from multiple sources. According to recent Supplier Selection
and Management Report reader surveys, creating new supplier partnerships is
an active and healthy activity, with two in ﬁve participating.
Yet the reality is that 50% of supplier partnerships fail. “Although we’d
like to believe that strategic supplier alliances will last forever, we must real-
ize that they have a natural life cycle and will inevitably come to an end,”
maintains Lorrie K. Mitchell, supplier alignment leader at BellSouth Tele-
communications, Inc. (Atlanta, Ga.; Lorraine.Mitchell@bridge.bellsouth.
com).
Why alliances end.
The end of a strategic alliance may sound disastrous, im-
plying a failure on someone’s part, or a breakdown in the process, according
to Mitchell, a member of the Supplier Selection and Management Report Edito-
rial Advisory Board. At a recent National Association of Purchasing Man-
agement (NAPM) Annual International Purchasing Conference, she out-
lined reasons why many alliances end:
• Changing focus of organizations. “If either the purchasing organization
or the supplier organization has shifted their strategic direction, an existing
alliance relationship might no longer be of value,” she mentions.
• Overall focus of organization is the same, but needs for certain products/ser-
vices change. This is a situation that might occur if a supplier’s product or ser-
vice is becoming obsolete within the purchasing department’s needs. 
934
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

• Supplier cannot accommodate needs. Although this situation might occur
with a negative tone if the original intent of the alliance was to meet certain
objectives that now cannot be met, it also may come about as change occurs
that no one could predict.
• Relationship just not “working.” This situation is the scenario that most
alliance partners fear, according to Mitchell. It could result from different
corporate cultures that do not blend well, individual and unresolvable per-
sonnel issues, continuing conﬂicts that require great effort to repair, or the
results of the relationship are just not meeting expectations.
In addition, Susan I. Scott, CPM, CIRM, senior consultant at Harris
Consulting, Inc. (Lexington, Mass.; Susiscott@aol.com), suggests that the
most prevalent reason for dissolving a supplier partnership is broken trust.
“Once you can no longer rely on a partner to back up their word with ac-
tion, to tell the truth about downtime or quality issues, or to share true and
accurate cost information, the relationship deteriorates quickly,” she ex-
plained at the NAPM annual conference. 
How to prepare for a divorce.
“Always have a backup plan,” Mitchell asserts.
“Have a mental, if not written notes of what action you will need to take,
whom you would interface with in every aspect of the supply stream.” There
are some speciﬁc steps you may want to consider. “Naturally, you will al-
ready have documented the main issues that have brought you to this point,”
she declares. You may be questioning whether a signiﬁcant price increase or
pricing structure initiated by the supplier is warranted. 
Perhaps service level agreements are consistently not being met, or per-
haps quality is the issue. “You may be receiving daily calls from your clients
questioning the quality and technical capabilities of your supplier,” Mitchell
explains. These concerns need to be listed and evaluated with a similar list-
ing of positive forces in the current relationship.
Consult with groups and departments that could be affected by a change in suppliers.
“Meet with those in charge and ﬁnd out what a change would do to their
part of the process,” Mitchell advises. “Once you have checked all processes,
personnel, cost, and other repercussions a change of suppliers would cause,
communicate this to your end users’ upper management.”
Construct a pros and cons statement of remaining or changing the al-
liance relationship. A key element here is to determine the dollar cost of the
change. “If the costs are astronomical, you may want to rethink switching

suppliers,” she offers. Evaluate what time and resources you are using to keep
the alliance relationship aﬂoat and compare it with the time and resources to
ramp up for a new supplier.
If the list of pros to stay with the current alliance is greater than the list
of cons, Mitchell recommends creating a joint (purchaser/supplier) action
plan that identiﬁes the concerns and also the steps on both sides that will be
taken to improve the situation. “Of course, complete dates with appropri-
ate checks in between should occur,” she emphasizes. “Mutually agreed-
upon measurements should also be included.” However, if the reasons to
change outweigh the reasons to stay with the current supplier, then it is
probably the time to issue a solicitation, probably a request for proposal
(RFP).
Involve the end user in decision making.
Scott maintains that the “change
be invisible to the user. At best the user will notice improved service and
quality, but suffer no downside from the change.” Mitchell, meanwhile,
maintains, “As in any alliance relationship, the decision to terminate can-
not be made in a vacuum nor can one side make it without input of the
other.”
These determinations need to be made not only by the partners but also
by end users of the product/service. “It is hard to imagine that you would
have a problem with the supplier without them being affected by the impact
too,” she explains. Chances are that your discussions with the suppliers are
based on or were initiated by conversations of incidents described by your
end users. “If you are considering signiﬁcantly changing or eliminating the
alliance relationship,” Mitchell says, “it is imperative that you have the buy-
in of your customer or end users. They will be very interested in the alter-
natives you will be describing to them,” she encourages.
When you decide to move on.
The time will always come in any alliance re-
lationship when you will issue that solicitation to determine who will now
provide that particular product/service. “The main thing is that you don’t
terminate one alliance relationship until you have selected a new partner,”
she cautions. “A partner who is willing and anxious to work with you will
understand that there will be a period of transition.”
So, no matter how anxious and apprehensive your current supplier has
made you regarding the possibility of switching suppliers, there is always an-
other supplier ready and willing to start an alliance relationship with you,
Mitchell assures.

Logistics managers that excel in supply chain management do so by main-
taining strong supplier partnerships (see sidebar). Working closely with sup-
pliers can help you to leverage the supplier’s competencies and achieve even
higher economic, productivity, and operational efﬁciencies.
Companies that have deﬁned and altered their partner relationships are
now among those considered world class. Best Practices in Supply Chain Part-
nership and Certiﬁcation, published by Best Practices, LLC (Chapel Hill,
N.C.; 919-403-0251), offers eight tips for managing supplier relationships
and explains how some of today’s leading companies are putting them to use.
1. Require suppliers to develop and implement internal quality pro-
grams. Florida Power & Light asks vendors to focus internally on quality

Other Factors That Must Be Considered
There are several issues you may want to take into consideration:
1. Legal. It is always helpful if you can synchronize the timing of the ex-
piration of the current supplier’s agreement with the time you would like to
terminate the alliance relationship. Giving too much advance warning to your
current supplier can be risky business. You may be letting yourself open to ei-
ther a decrease in service level or a major play for the business. If you have a
dollar commitment agreement, you will need to evaluate what this switch will
do to you ﬁnancially. Perhaps you can negotiate a settlement of sorts, but you
will have to determine some reasons why the supplier would be interested in
exiting the alliance relationship.
2. Conﬁdentiality Agreements. You already have agreed to purchaser and
supplier’s proprietary rights language in your executed agreement. If you have
executed a nondisclosure or information exchange agreement covering a par-
ticular body of knowledge, that information will be protected as agreed upon
and for the period of time agreed upon.
3. Intellectual Property Issues. If there are any open intellectual property is-
sues, it may be difﬁcult to bring them to fruition. It is likely that these issues
were discussed and agreed upon prior to the execution of the agreement. Typ-
ically any issues of this sort are deal breakers and would be protected by the
terms and conditions of the agreement even if it has expired.

Seven Supplier Relationships
To get started, you ﬁrst have to deﬁne the type of supplier relationship you
want. James A. Eckert, assistant professor of marketing and supply chain man-
agement at Northeastern University (Boston; 617-373-5307), deﬁnes seven
types of relationships between suppliers and customers by level of trust, fre-
quency of interaction, and commitment to the relationship (see Figure III-
4.1). They are
1. Nonstrategic transactions. These can be one-time or multiple transac-
tions. The predominant characteristics include limited trust of the other party,
limited communication, limited dependence on the other party, limited ca-
pability of the other organization, limited volume conducted between the or-
ganizations, and very little investment in the other party.
2. Administered relationship. Like nonstrategic transactions, these include
one-time or multiple transactions, but with a stronger emphasis on managing
the relationship through less formalized strategies. Trust is generally low, but
communication high. These relationships have a high percentage of transac-
tions over multiple products and services, which increases the level of de-
pendence.
3. Contractual relationship. Contractual terms are popular in supplier-
customer relationships and reduce the need for direct communication be-
tween boundaries. Interactive skills are critical, and managers must be aware
of the contractual obligations to appropriately address key issues.
4. Specialty contract relationship. These exist for narrowly designed prod-
ucts or services that are exchanged between suppliers and customers. Success
here requires strong personal relationships and a signiﬁcant amount of trust.
Such a relationship might exist between a manufacturer and a logistics services
provider.
5. Partnership. An example here might be a supplier of critical compo-
nents to a manufactured product delivered on a weekly basis. Trust and com-
mitment must be high, but interaction is low. Partnerships require both par-
ties to invest heavily in the relationship to prove their commitment.
6. Joint venture. This is generally associated with some form of investment
by the parties in the relationship to accommodate mutual beneﬁts. For in-
stance, two manufacturers with complementary technologies might form a
joint venture to produce a completely new product. Since the parties are tied
by ﬁnancial obligations, managers should be aware of their respective internal
responsibilities.

improvement, detailing plans for deployment problem solving and proactive
strategies.
2. Require suppliers to meet cost requirements. AlliedSignal asked its
supplier base to reduce their prices by 10% to 15%, reduce lead times by 30,
and continue to meet quality standards. Suppliers who did so were awarded
long-term contracts.
3. Measure internal customer satisfaction with suppliers to ensure end-
user quality. GTE uses its Supplier Quality Program to determine whether
the supplier offers the best product or service that its expertise can provide,
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating
939
7. Strategic alliance. Signiﬁcant trust is required to achieve levels of com-
munication and increased investment. An example might be a supplier who
provides a dedicated engineer to work with a customer’s new product devel-
opment team. 
Eckert says that managers must develop negotiation and relationship
management strategies for each type of relationship and adapt their ap-
proaches to the unique characteristics of each relationship. This is done by an-
alyzing where the relationship currently stands and where they would like it
to go, where the other party considers the relationship to stand and where
they would like it to go, and what action they can take to increase trust, in-
teraction, and communication.

whether the supplier is reliable and consistent, whether documentation is
accurate, and whether the supplier is responsive and timely in addressing
problems.
4. Conduct performance reviews to monitor supplier performance.
GTE develops criteria for each supplier’s product or service, based on value,
delivery, documentation, and customer service. Each score is measured on a
scale of 1 to 10 (10 being excellent). A minimum score of eight is required
to become a supplier. If a supplier receives a score below eight, GTE will
outline measures for improvement. Within 30 days, the supplier must sub-
mit a detailed action plan that reﬂects the improvements. If the supplier does
not attempt to reach the minimum levels, it is dropped from GTE’s supply
chain.
5. Deﬁne key measures to manage the supplier performance process.
AT&T UCS measures its suppliers according to mutually agreed-upon ser-
vice standards. Regular meetings are held with key suppliers to discuss
plans, review results, and address issues important to the success of the part-
nerships.
6. Employ classiﬁcation designations to regulate the frequency of per-
formance reviews. Xerox reviews its largest suppliers ($20 million and more)
quarterly, midsize suppliers ($1 to $5 million) every six months, and small
suppliers (under $1 million) annually. Standards for quality and lead times are
reviewed at these times.
7. Employ a self-renewing supplier evaluation process to foster contin-
uous improvement. General Motors has suppliers rate themselves in terms of
quality, cost, delivery, technology, and management. 
8. Develop a structured process to manage relationships with top sup-
pliers. Corning Telecommunications Products Division has a tight structure
for developing relationships with Level I suppliers. Suppliers are rated on
their strengths and weaknesses in performance, quality, technology, and
price. The process has reduced the level of defective product received from
Level I suppliers by a factor of ﬁve.
Another leading organization, Hoffman-La Roche Inc., has put to-
gether a four-phased vendor certiﬁcation program for establishing partner-
ships with suppliers of raw materials and components to attain quality im-
provement.
In phase I, vendors are chosen for certiﬁcation and are evaluated on their
commitment to quality. During phase II, the vendor is assessed and quality
940
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

improvement programs are implemented. Phase III requires the vendor to
fulﬁll all certiﬁcation criteria, and if the vendor meets all the requirements
of phases I to III, certiﬁcation is achieved.

The average life cycle of a supplier partnership is about three years. For per-
fectly logical reasons, however, purchasing professionals continue to seek
and create new supplier partnerships. Two in ﬁve Supplier Selection and Man-
agement Report subscribers indicate that this is one of their preferred best
practices.
For many, entering into new supplier relationships is an opportunity to
improve a lagging performance objective; for others, it is a means of lever-
aging a scarce resource. Most of the responding purchasing professionals
shared with us their reasons for, and the beneﬁts achieved from, these new
partnerships. The following are excerpts from their replies.
Achieve better supplier quality.
“Creating new supplier partnerships has been
the way we addressed our top priority, improving supplier quality,” main-
tains a purchasing manager at a small manufacturer of exhaust systems. “The
quality improvements go beyond material supplied. They also include ser-
vice, processing, and other parameters.”
An essential element of the partnership agreement was to have frequent
joint meetings. “This way, we gain a better understanding of each other’s pro-
cesses and work to accommodate each other’s needs,” he shares. “Key sup-
pliers and/or quality-poor suppliers were targeted ﬁrst.”
Improve inventory performance.
“We have increased our inventory turns by
20%, which has resulted in a savings of $84,000,” according to a purchasing
manager at a small maker of employee service awards. “Since creating new
supplier partnerships and sharing production plans and forecasts with our
supplier partners, they have been better able to serve us by decreasing lead
times,” he relates. “Our savings are a result of being able to keep less prod-
ucts on our shelves.”
Provide a better ﬁt with business model.
The commodity manager at a major
producer of silicon explains, “We are now implementing new ASIC parts
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating
941

and have created a new supplier partnership that is a better match for our
business model and design direction.” He also reports that through this new
relationship, “We expect to save upwards of $1 million per year.” 
Move to a just-in-time ( JIT) purchasing system.
“We switched to suppliers
with more efﬁcient delivery methods, which reduced backordered items
and allowed us to conﬁdently implement our JIT purchasing system,” main-
tains a purchasing manager at a midsize manufacturer of laundry equipment.
One immediate beneﬁt has been a reduction in storage needs.
“Sourcing new suppliers also gives us multiple backups to further our
ability to not order until we actually need that item,” he shares. However,
this purchasing manager does acknowledge, “It is very difﬁcult to change
from a supplier who just can’t do what you require in terms of price and ful-
ﬁllment when you have been with them for years.”
Expand a total buying program.
“We formed a partnership arrangement
across our global business unit with a supplier, which has reduced our initial
costs, gained a rebate based on overall purchases, and enabled us to reduce
our supplier base,” details a purchasing manager at a midsize facility of a large
nonferrous metal producer.
The latter achievement is critical, she mentions, as one of her biggest
challenges is the “neverending buy-outs or takeovers of our suppliers, which
requires the need to recertify them.”
Gain access to better technology.
“The area in which we’ve been focusing our
efforts for the past few years has been in forming new supplier relationships,”
acknowledges a buyer at a small maker of heating elements. “To build up
these new relationships we spend a lot of time and attention on these sup-
pliers, so everyone on both sides knows and understands the goal.” The new
suppliers, she adds, “have better technology and manufacturing processes
than previous suppliers.”
Enhance material ﬂow.
“Our new supplier partner made a suggestion and of-
fered us an incentive to try a new approach,” describes a procurement man-
ager at a small builder of specialty machinery. “They suggested that we al-
low them to purchase the components that up until then were supplied by
us for their assembly.” The new approach, she mentions was “very effective
both in substantial cost savings and efﬁcient material ﬂow.”
942

Reduce supplier base.
“Since focusing on creating new supplier partnerships,
we have been able to combine three suppliers/distributors into one,” says a
purchasing director at a small healthcare provider. “When we made the com-
mitment to have them take 80% of the business in speciﬁc product lines, we
realized a cost savings of about 12%, plus an additional 30% in time and la-
bor savings.”
The purchasing manager at a midsize maker of advertising specialties
also tells of using supplier partnerships in an effort to reduce the supply base.
“We have been able to decrease the cost of product in exchange for volume
buys or blanket orders.”
Achieve cost reductions.
A materials manager at a large manufacturer of med-
ical devices tried to utilize the existing supplier base as all new products must
be reviewed by purchasing. “As a medical device manufacturer, our goal is
to keep minimal inventory, velocity high, and experience no quality snags.”
However, the time had come to source a new supply of PVC resin. “We
conducted a supplier audit and validated material after negotiating a favor-
able cost,” he reports. “We entered into a new supplier partnership for this
raw material. Overall, it will mean an annual savings of $750,000.”
Guarantee critical materials availability.
“Our work is based on having essen-
tial supplies available to do experiments in our research departments,” main-
tains an administrator for materials management at a major medical insti-
tution. “To achieve our delivery objective, we have signed key partnership
agreements. Additionally, we have also signed on with a group purchasing
organization and are using their contract to achieve signiﬁcant savings in
supplies and capital equipment purchases.”

Turf battles and functional silos have built up walls between procurement
and logistics organizations (see sidebar). As the two groups begin to realize
that they impact each other and cannot operate as separate entities for the
good of their companies, however, those walls are starting to crumble.

cer Management and leader of Mercer’s Strategic Sourcing Practice. “More

Internet-Based Procurement Support Systems
The onslaught of Internet-based procurement sites is helping supply chain or-
ganizations increase their level of sophistication when it comes to procuring
raw materials (see “Five Levels of Procurement”). “E-business procurement
will streamline internal processes such as requisition approval and purchase
order creation,” states Christoph Hesterbrink in a recent report from Price-
waterhouseCoopers, E-Business and ERP: Bringing Two Paradigms Together.
“Suppliers will be able to monitor inventory levels and improve their own
ability to forecast, truly integrating themselves into the value chain.”
While several e-procurement Internet sites have popped up in just the last
few months, we recommend checking out the following solutions for their
range of offerings:
•
Sourcing Net from Dun & Bradstreet (973-408-6656) is an Internet-
based site that allows customers access to 11 million U.S. suppliers. You can
source based on demographics, geographic, and socioeconomic indicators
such as minority, women-owned, and small business preferences. Another
reference is by quality standards, such as ISO 9000 certiﬁcation. The annual
fee schedule reﬂects three levels of service—$10,000, $25,000, and $50,000.
•
PurchasingCenter.com is an online portal Web site focused on the
needs of MRO buyers in small and midsize companies. It provides a supplier
directory and a searchable database of 6,000 distributor locations. Unique is
the “Your Purchasing Page,” which lets members build their own purchasing
home page and publish information for use by their suppliers and customers.
•
SupplierMarket.com enables buyers to broaden their supply base. The
SmartMatch feature nominates a number of suppliers based on the online
RFQ submission requirements. When the deal is complete, the supplier pays
a small commission fee to SupplierMarket.com; there is no charge to the
buyer. 
•
Virtual Source Network (vsource.net) allows buyers to create an In-
ternet-based purchasing system. It provides support for consortium buying
groups for leveraged procurement. A low initial access fee and ongoing trans-
action fees are based on usage.
•
ShareMax.com just released the Agile Sourcing model featuring a
proprietary supplier database. It includes extensive RFI data and enables users
to ﬁnd more suppliers for speciﬁc categories.
•
E-SupplierLink from RockySoft Corp. (www.rockysoft.com) links
planning data from multiple tiers of a global supply chain across the Net. Users
need a Web browser and a connection to their planning data to run
e-SupplierLink. “RockySoft’s approach has the potential to go well beyond

today’s collaborative planning and information-sharing concepts toward con-
nected execution,” says Bob Ferrari, senior analyst of Supply Chain Manage-
ment for AMR Research.
•
Nistevo.com is a subscription-based service, requiring a browser to
access. Its collaborative planning features have attracted ﬁrms like General
Mills Operations, which will use the solution to collaborate with its various
logistics service providers to manage annual service agreements. Nistevo.com
will also allow General Mills Operations to adjust supply chain plans to meet
changing customer demands. “We are constantly looking for innovative ways
to improve the efﬁciency of our supply chain,” says Dick Hanson, vice presi-
dent of distribution and logistics for General Mills. “We’re excited about the
logistics enhancements we’re looking to implement with the Nistevo.com
network.”
•
NEXstep Inc. (Plano, Texas; 214-495-5641) offers a fulﬁllment solu-
tion for online retailers. This transaction-based fee model focuses on all supply
chain areas that go into order fulﬁllment, including procurement.
Five Levels of Procurement
Les Artman, vice president of Mercer Management and leader of Mercer’s
Strategic Sourcing Practice, says that logistics organizations are working with
procurement departments to enhance their level of purchasing sophistication.
While he believes most companies are at level 1 in terms of their sophistica-
tion, “there is lot of opportunity for improvement and moving up the so-
phistication ladder.”
The ﬁve levels are:
0 Individual user groups buy their own supplies; not centralized.
1 Centralized procurement organization utilizes corporate leverage; can
save 20% to 25% of procurement costs.
2 Procurement organization develops an integrated plan with suppliers,
getting them involved with product design; can result in another 5%
to 15% improvement.
3 Procurement performs benchmarking activities of suppliers on price
and service.
4 Procurement ﬁgures out ways to procure product more quickly so that
ﬁnished goods orders can be fulﬁlled more rapidly. The goal here is to
reduce costs and increase revenue.

and more companies are moving procurement into their supply chain or-
ganizations, along with logistics, to create a synergy between the two
groups.” Some of the ways that these ﬁrms are creating synergies include the
following:
• Sharing information. “Procurement can represent up to 70% of the cost
of goods,” says Artman. “If you add that to other supply chain costs, that is
a high percentage of the cost of doing business.”
When information is shared, the supply chain organization will get a to-
tal picture of supply chain ﬂows and costs. In addition, there will be a better
understanding of the tradeoffs between buying more product at a lower cost
or buying less product at a higher cost and what this all does to inventory
levels.
• Making procurement part of the supply chain organization. The supply
chain manager will take responsibility for procurement as it relates to the
tradeoffs, explains Artman.
• Putting together performance measures. Measuring working capital (in-
ventory + receivables/payables) gives the supply chain organization a better
grip on deciding when to purchase supplies and how they impact inventory.
Artman says, “Measures can incent the organization to optimize the link be-
tween the supply chain organization and the procurement group.”
• Changing ways of thinking. Rather than categorizing costs by func-
tional areas, think about the net landed cost of delivering a product to the
customer, beginning with procurement to warehousing and transportation.

Not only are supplier report cards a staple of sound supplier management,
but purchasing professionals are increasingly asking suppliers to prepare a re-
port card on their performance as well. Lorrie K. Mitchell, supplier align-
ment leader at BellSouth (Atlanta; Lorraine.Mitchell@bridge.bellsouth.
com) tells Supplier Selection and Management Report, “We have a formal report
card/scorecard in place designed to promote a cooperative relationship be-
tween both parties. Both the buyer and supplier come to realize early on that
it is beneﬁcial to assist the other party in any issue or weakness they may
have,” she maintains.
946
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

H. Ervin Lewis, CPM, director of purchasing at Wellman, Inc. (John-
sonville, S.C.; erv.lewis@wellmaninc.com), who does not have a formal feed-
back process, nonetheless routinely asks suppliers to rate Wellman’s perfor-
mance as a buying organization. “Our objective is to be a ‘world-class’ buyer
in the supplier’s eyes and in our minds that means helping the supplier be-
come successful,” he told us. 
Overcoming the reluctance of suppliers to provide “real” feedback.
Of the profes-
sionals we spoke with on this question, virtually all acknowledge that in the
beginning it is difﬁcult to get the supplier’s cooperation. “Don’t tell us what
you think we want to hear,” stresses Randy L. Gard, vice president of glo-
bal planning at Vermeer Manufacturing Company (Pella, Iowa; rgard@
vermeermfg.com), to his supply base. “It doesn’t work that way.”
Gard’s experience is not unique. In fact, Lewis argues rather forcibly,
“We need to hear from the supplier if we are doing something that makes
their business life more difﬁcult or raises their costs.” That is not to say that
every supplier suggestion will be implemented, Lewis notes. “But it provides
a starting point from which we can work together to ﬁnd solutions that sat-
isfy both parties.”
The quest to be a better customer.
“We need to be signiﬁcant to our suppliers
to obtain the best possible service,” argues Terry Sueltman, vice president of
supply management at Industrial Automation & Control, Honeywell Inc.
(Phoenix; terry.sueltman@iac.honeywell.com). “We always ask them what
we’re doing to make life easier or more difﬁcult for them,” he declares.
In Vermeer’s case, Gard wants the organization to be a better customer
to help drive down total acquisition costs. “If we’re hard to do business with,
if we give the suppliers an inaccurate forecast, if they can’t get in touch with
us, we want to know about it,” Gard insists. Vermeer’s report card is rather
simple (see Figure III-4.2), he explains. “Did we ignore the lead time? How
many times?” Or, was the delivery date or quantity changed? And how of-
ten did this occur during the time period?
Another example of a report card format is that of the Galesburg Re-
frigeration Products Division of Maytag Corporation. This report card is in
the form of an opinion survey (see Table III-4.1). Scott W. Giles, director of
procurement (sgiles@maytag.com), explains that the suppliers review each
statement and mark off to what degree they agree or disagree with it. A
unique feature is having the supplier identify which customer they consider
best-in-class in each category.

Wisconsin Tissue also has a supplier’s evaluation form (see Table III-
4.2). It classiﬁes the evaluated criteria as either day-to-day or long-term.
Brian Higgins, CPM, purchasing area manager at Wisconsin Tissue, a divi-
sion of Chesapeake Corporation (Menasha, Wisc.; 920-727-8820), told a
recent NAPM Supply Chain Management Conference that if a supplier
rates one of the criteria a 3 or less (degree of dissatisfaction), they request an
explanation.

Develop a supplier technical/capabilities questionnaire.
“Buyers are always seek-
ing to maximize value in purchases,” maintains Lorrie K. Mitchell, relation-
ship manager, supply chain department, BellSouth Telecommunications,
Inc. (Atlanta). “They want to select the most appropriate supplier to provide
the requested product/service and meet all of their needs, but somehow
price tends to get in the way.”

One tool she recommends to avoid this situation is a supplier techni-
cal/capabilities document: “It’s the most important document in the sup-
plier selection process as it ensures the selection is based on capabilities and
requested outcomes and not solely on price.”
Open-ended questions work best at getting the answers.
The supplier techni-
cal/capabilities questionnaire asks the supplier candidates two types of open-
ended questions.
“The reason these questions are so important is that without their an-
swers, you and your client have no way of knowing if a supplier understands
what you are looking for and if they indeed have the capability to provide
it,” Mitchell emphasizes.

First, have the client (at BellSouth it is the technical selection team)
identify general questions to determine supplier capabilities, size, past busi-
ness experience, and so forth. Second, there should be speciﬁc questions
addressing the product/service outcome needed. “Once the questions are
identiﬁed, the team needs to determine the importance or weight associated
with each question,” Mitchell says. “This approach not only ensures the
client the best supplier is selected, but it also can provide a documented sum-
mary of the reasons why they were selected,” she explains.
Ensuring the longer-term prospects for the supplier you select.
L. Wayne Riley,
manager of global materials services at Intel Corp. (Chandler, Ariz.), agrees
that many buyers and companies have “expertly documented formulas for
analyzing their respective suppliers for acceptable performance and materi-
als/service ﬁt.” However, he questions whether they also are able to “per-
form a proﬁcient analysis of their suppliers to project long-term success.”
According to Riley, “Buyers place little attention and effort on the align-
ment of the suppliers’ manufacturing operations to their own speciﬁc man-
ufacturing operation.” This, he claims, has the most important impact on
current and future cost and performance.
What the buyer should study about potential suppliers.
According to Riley, be-
fore a buyer “engages with a supplier to provide materials or services,” she
must
• Know how the manufacturing, technology, and service directions of
the suppliers’ materials/products coincide with the manufacturing
direction of their own products
• Understand the suppliers’ commitments and business needs
• Provide the appropriate level of analysis
Alignment of product/process structures is critical for success.
Buyers can analyze
their suppliers for capability, stability, resourcefulness, and competitiveness
(the four components that cover the suppliers’ ability to manufacture and
deliver quality materials/service). However, before doing so, “they must en-
sure their suppliers’ product and process structures are aligned with their
own company’s product and process structures.” 
“Buyers have the responsibility to analyze their own company’s situa-
tion, then to determine that of their respective suppliers,” Riley continues.
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating
951

A match also eliminates the need to conduct extensive supplier evaluations
for future supply due to the inability of the supplier to fulﬁll orders.
Putting management back into supplier management.
“Even though supplier re-
lationships may have existed for many years, neither partner may have taken
the initiative to manage the relationship,” maintains William S. Wehr, CPM,
director of quality systems at Lewis-Goetz Company, Inc. (Pittsburgh).
Lewis-Goetz has developed a supplier partnership management process
(SPMP) that provides a deﬁned structure for managing and continually im-
proving partnerships with key suppliers. It consists of seven process features
that are integrated to provide performance accountability, defect identiﬁca-
tion, cost improvement commitment, problem solving, and two-way com-
munication. “These process features establish a baseline for measuring the
success of the partnership while allowing areas of improvement to be clearly
identiﬁed,” explains Wehr.
Setting goals that are meaningful for all the parties.
One area Wehr stresses is
that of establishing performance goals to deﬁne acceptable and unacceptable
performance. “Goal setting is always a sensitive issue because any evaluative
assessment of the supplier’s performance will ultimately be communicated to
the supplier’s top management through the periodic review meetings,” he
explains. Goal setting should take into account only those performance ar-
eas important to the buyer and meaningful to the supplier, Wehr advises.
Consideration also should be given to those performance areas that can
be quantitatively measured (on-time delivery, material defects), and the ex-
tent data is readily available. “A key principle that always must be considered
is that partnership goal setting is a dynamic process, as buyer and supplier
performance expectations change over time to meet increasing customer de-
mands,” Wehr maintains. “Therefore, performance goals must be continu-
ally reassessed and changed to meet these new expectations.”
Effective management of supply chain requires streamlined, partnership-based rela-
tionships with suppliers.
That is the common thread, or message, that the
presenters are communicating. Similarly, George L. Harris, CPM, presi-
dent of Harris Consulting, Inc. (Lexington, Mass.), emphasizes that these
types of relationships require a substantial amount of resources and atten-
tion from both buyers and suppliers. He also advises, “Partners should be
few in number, yet involve many people from both supplier and buyer or-
ganizations.”
According to Harris, the supplier partnership development process in-
952
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

volves a four-step approach. The assessment phase entails the review of data
on purchasing volume, part families, current suppliers, extent of competi-
tion, state of technology, and supplier volatility and performance. Once
these data are developed, a plan can be constructed for execution. 
In the optimization phase, the purchasing professional moves to the best
suppliers by using evaluation strategies such as stair-step, pass/fail, or con-
tinuous reduction tactics. Results are collected and measures are mutually
agreed upon, with the supplier receiving feedback on performance. Action
plans are then developed.
“There is always some trepidation about optimizing the supply base, as
it could be viewed as increasing the risks taken by an organization,” Harris
notes. These risks include higher pricing due to single sourcing, lack of con-
tingencies due to natural disaster, or sheer supplier nonperformance and the
lack of leverage. 
Put it in writing.
“That’s why measures of progress must be put in place to
allow for periodic evaluation of performance,” he says. “We also recommend
the terms of the partnership agreement be put in writing, given the mobil-
ity of procurement and supplier management personnel.” The terms must
survive the personnel turnover and relocation of staff originally involved in
the establishment of the agreement.

In today’s dynamic environment, purchasing professionals must be on the
alert for sudden price change requests from the supplier community. Ac-
cording to Supplier Selection and Management Report readers, this often means
an unexpected price increase.
However, almost half the respondents to a recent reader survey say that
they take exception to the so-called automatic upward price adjustment and
are instead taking a tougher stand on price increases. Patrick S. Woods,
CPM, CPIM, APP, commodity manager at Emerson Electric/Fisher Con-
trols (Sherman, Texas; 903-868-8160), believes that more companies should
include in their purchase orders or contracts “speciﬁc and concise language
to address price change.” 
Not only increases should be considered when it comes to price changes.
He also ad-
vises, “Price changes include both increases as well as decreases due to a
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating
953

softening in the marketplace, and cost savings through the practice of tech-
niques such as value analysis.”
At an Annual International Purchasing Conference of the National As-
sociation of Purchasing Management, Woods recommends “at least negoti-
ating within the agreement that with exception to material costs, the sup-
plier is to ﬁx or hold ﬁrm the other cost drivers (labor, outside services, and
overhead) throughout the term of the agreement.” These then can be re-
negotiated at the agreement’s expiration.
Material costs are a different matter, however. He believes that material
costs are least within the control of the supplier.
How to deal with ﬂuctuations in material costs.
Determine whether there is an
applicable index on which to base the changes. In the event that more than
one base material makes up the total part material, try to negotiate for the
leading material. For instance, in brass, the leading material is copper; in
plastic, it is petroleum.
Woods recommends “talking with your direct supplier, their supplier,
and even the raw material producer. They can possibly even recommend an
index that both you and they can agree as an indicator of price change.”
If that strategy does not work, consider the Producer Price Index (PPI),
which is published monthly by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Additionally, he reminds, the price change should reﬂect
only the portion that the material represents in the overall total part price. 
When to consider making a price change.
There are two schools of thought for
handling the timing of price changes, according to Woods: “You may wish
to negotiate with the supplier that prices will be reviewed and changed in
set intervals, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.”
The alternative is to set a ﬂuctuation window with a +% or –% ﬂuctua-
tion prior to price changes. The key here is to set a base material cost with a
ﬂuctuation window above or below.
“If the price increases, but not outside the ﬂuctuation range, the cus-
tomer beneﬁts by not having to pay the higher price,” he analyzes. Similarly,
the supplier beneﬁts when the base price decreases, but not when it remains
within the agreed-to range.
Putting it all into the appropriate language.
This rationale must be incorpo-
rated into speciﬁc language through price change clauses incorporated into
the agreement (see sidebar).

Sample Price Change Clauses For Your Contracts
A. Price change clause based on time interval (6 month) adjustment
Pricing Adjustments Based on Raw Material Only. The price for each customer
product may be adjusted in the event of a change in _____ material price. At
the end of each six (6) month period after the establishment of this agreement,
based on a six month average, deﬁned as a “semi-annual period,” the parties
to this agreement shall determine the average price for the speciﬁc “semi-
annual period” which will equal the average price per unit of _____ material
as published in the _____ index or PPI during such “semi-annual period.”
The supplier will subsequently decrease or increase the price of each customer
product containing _____ material by an amount of the average price change
multiplied by the percentage of that customer product that is comprised of
_____ material. Such price change will be effective for the next six month pe-
riod.
B. Price change clause based on adjustment window (+ or –20%) read as follows:
Pricing Adjustments Based on Raw Material Only. The price for each customer
product may be adjusted in the event of a change in _____ material price. If
any price of _____ material as published in the _____ index or PPI is 20%
greater or less than the preestablished base price then the supplier will subse-
quently decrease or increase the price of each customer product containing
_____ material by the amount of the price change multiplied by the percent-
age of that customer product that is comprised of _____ material. Such price
change will be effective for the next invoice.
C. Price change clause based on both time interval (6 month) and window (+ or
–20%) adjustment
Pricing Adjustments Based on Raw Material Only. The price for each customer
product may be adjusted in the event of a change in _____ material price. At
the end of each six (6) month period after the establishment of this agreement,
based on a six month average, deﬁned as a “semi-annual period,” the parties
to this agreement shall determine the average price for the speciﬁc “semi-
annual period” which will equal the average price per unit of _____ material
as published in the _____ index or PPI during such “semi-annual period.” If
any average price is 20% greater or less than the average price for the imme-
diately preceding “semi-annual period,” the supplier will subsequently de-
crease or increase the price of each customer product containing _____ ma-
terial by an amount of the average price change multiplied by the percentage
of that customer product that is comprised of _____ material. Such price
change will be effective for the next six month period.

What about supplied services, and ﬂuctuations other than materials?
If you pur-
chase services or if the supplier of the manufactured item insists on allowing
ﬂuctuations for other factors, primarily labor, take the following approach.
Normally, labor rate changes, along with overhead increases (such as
utilities and rent), generally follow inﬂation rate changes. The best overall
indicator to capture such changes, according to Woods, is the Consumer
Price Index (CPI).
The sample clauses A, B, and C could again be used, but by substituting
labor costs for material and the CPI in place of the PPI or other index. “As
was the case previously, you can negotiate the price change based on a time
interval, ﬂuctuation window, or combination of both,” Woods maintains.
Language when the price change results from a cost reduction initiative.
“A pro-
active way to encourage the supplier to hold pricing, even the material cost
factor, or to even lower the pricing, is through cost reduction based on value
analysis,” he shares.
“However, you as the customer have the responsibility to provide your
supplier with the channel and resources to achieve the value analysis pro-
grams,” he declares. “All too often, suppliers simply give up because they feel
this program is one-sided.”
In addition to the value analysis clause in the agreement (see sidebar,
clause D), some purchasers go a step further to propose a 50/50 sharing of
the beneﬁt from these ideas, Woods notes.
956
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T
D. Price change clause based on cost reduction through value analysis
Pricing Adjustments Related to Cost Reduction Efforts. Both customer and sup-
plier agree to work together on cost reduction projects through value anal-
ysis. When such efforts lead to tangible and measurable cost reduction over
a 12 month period, the dollar savings will be shared 50/50 between both
parties (or depending on your negotiability you may stipulate a minimum
amount to you with any percentage over to be shared equally). Supplier’s cap-
ital investment and all other related expense attendant to the realization of the
actual cost reduction will be recouped at 100% through the cost reduction be-
fore customer is entitled to receive ﬁnancial beneﬁt from the effort. Customer
will receive its share of the reduction in the form of price reduction on the
products directly affected by the cost reduction effort.

The quest for supplier partnerships remains unabated. Purchasing manage-
ments continue their pursuit of suppliers that will enable them to achieve their
long-term objectives while simultaneously enabling them to begin serious
progress toward building an effective supply chain management practice. 
Respondents to the recent Supplier Selection and Management Report
reader survey conﬁrm that creating new supplier partnerships remains a crit-
ical priority, as almost two in ﬁve (37.2%) claim to be fostering this type of
relationship. Coupled with those who are initiating supply chain manage-
ment initiatives (almost one in ﬁve), it is no wonder why supplier partner-
ships are critical.
What impresses us is the focus and determination that purchasing pro-
fessionals bring to this process. The following excerpts from reader responses
suggest what you can do in establishing or expanding existing new supplier
partnerships.
Establishing a long-term agreement with a key supplier.
“One of our buyers, af-
ter reviewing the various performance measurements that we maintain on
our suppliers, strongly recommended that we enter a long-term relationship
with a supplier of a critical material,” shares a manufacturing engineer at a
midsize facility producing fuel systems for the aerospace industry.
“The supplier has brought its performance to an even higher level since
it now has direct access to demand data,” he offers. “The supplier gets the
minimum amount to us at the right time in the right location, signiﬁcantly
reducing the aggravation factor.”
Looking for suppliers that are only industry leaders.
“We’re actively creating
partnerships with world-class global suppliers that can show the ability to
lead their industry technically and economically,” offers a group manager of
materials and logistics at a large producer of precision stampings and me-
chanical springs.
“We’ve already accomplished this with two suppliers of raw materials
and one ofﬁce supplies vendor,” he declares. “Our facilities in multiple
countries will realize signiﬁcant cost savings.”
Looking to the partnership as an inventory reduction tool.
“We created teams of
representatives from purchasing, engineering, manufacturing, and sales to
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating
957

work with suppliers on their quality,” declares a materials manager at a mid-
size manufacturer of refrigeration equipment.
“We then created supplier partnerships with some suppliers and assured
them a certain volume of our business will be placed with them,” she re-
sponds. “In return, they agreed to maintain our inventory, which lowered
our carrying costs, and we also achieved a reduction in material cost of be-
tween 5% and 7%.”
Sourcing locally paying dividends.
“We’ve entered new supplier partnerships
with U.S. companies that have offered more competitive pricing and more
responsive service,” maintains a purchasing manager at a small manufacturer
of electronic products. “Traditionally, we have sourced materials from our
parent company in Japan, or transplant companies that are not competi-
tive.”
According to the manager, “It took a major effort to get the parent com-
pany to understand U.S. manufacturing capabilities before they relented and
allowed us to pursue other sources.”
Supplier partnerships initiate other best practices.
“We establish supplier al-
liances and partnerships because they allow us to enjoy other beneﬁts,” ex-
plains the purchasing manager at a major electric utility. “Since we’ve en-
tered several partnerships, we have involved the suppliers in engineering
issues, improved our quality, introduced JIT concepts, and determined total
cost of ownership on purchases.”
Sharing with the supplier—what a partnership is all about.
“We’re into supplier
partnerships,” agrees the director of corporate purchasing at a midsize sup-
plier of HVAC systems. “We’re into constant communications with the sup-
pliers to explain our position and how we need them as our partners. They
get more business, and we’ve seen our costs tumble. Last year alone we low-
ered cost by more than 5.2% of the total dollars spent,” he declares.

The reality is this: Supplier partnerships are, at best, short-lived. Most end
within three years. According to Supplier Selection and Management Report
reader surveys, however, many (almost half ) respondents continue to seek
958
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

out and form new partnerships. Essentially, they seek from the partnership
what they cannot achieve alone. 
For example, William S. Wehr, CPM, director of quality systems at
Lewis-Goetz and Company, Inc. (Pittsburgh; 412-341-7100), places a ma-
jor emphasis on maintaining partnerships with several key suppliers. The ob-
jective, he explained at a recent NAPM Annual International Purchasing
Conference, is to “increase customer service, reduce inventories, and min-
imize total operating costs.” 
Meanwhile, supplier relationship authority Tim Underhill, president of
Underhill & Associates (Tulsa; 918-494-8085), gets to the basics, observing,
“If a partnership is not beneﬁcial to your suppliers, and it’s not beneﬁcial to
you, it’s going to end.” The idea is to form a relationship that is mutually
beneﬁcial.
Potential is great for signiﬁcant savings.
According to Underhill, “picking the
‘low-hanging fruit’ of a relationship, meaning consignment inventory or re-
duction in the number of transactions, typically represents about 30% of the
savings you can get from your suppliers.”
The real decision that purchasing professionals must make is whether it
is worth their time and effort to go after the other 70% of the total savings.
“Those that have learned how to bring beneﬁt to the supplier and themselves
have had tremendous impact on their company’s bottom line,” he declared
at NAPM’s Supply Chain Management Conference.
“Alliances are based on your ability to be more proﬁtable,” he told the
assembled purchasing professionals. “You’re not going to do an alliance be-
cause you want to have this great relationship with a supplier; you want to
do it for bottom line impact,” he emphasizes.
What about partnerships with service providers?
Opportunities for service al-
liances should not be overlooked in this era of partnering. “Much of what
is true about alliances for materials may also be said about alliances for
services,” maintains R. G. Roberts III, CPM, alliance manager at SONAT
(Birmingham, Ala.; Robby.Roberts@sonat.com). However, he acknowl-
edged at the NAPM purchasing conference that “selecting potential service
providers may be much more of an art than materials partners.”
Similarly, service alliances differ in that fewer potential supply partners
may be available. This means that more suppliers must be developed. “Sup-
plier development has been successful with materials suppliers, so it also
should be considered with services,” he declares.
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating
959

How to develop the service alliance.
Roberts and copresenter Larry R. Smelt-
zer of Arizona state University recommend the following:
1. Identify suppliers that can beneﬁt from an alliance. “The unfortunate real-
ity is that many buyers look at potential alliance from only their own per-
spectives,” they agree. Similar to Underhill’s message, they insist that both
the buyer and supplier must beneﬁt from a service alliance.
In many instances, the greatest beneﬁt to a supplier is that labor may be
better utilized because the buyer can assist with forecasting demand. An-
other advantage to service alliances is that the supplier may train employees
for procedures speciﬁc to the purchaser.
“But the main point is that it is essential to ﬁnd suppliers who will ben-
eﬁt from the alliance so they will be motivated to ensure its success,” main-
tains Roberts. “It also may be necessary for the buyer to speciﬁcally point
out the advantages to the supplier.”
2. Develop total cost model. The purpose of an alliance is to increase over-
all efﬁciencies, not simply to reduce prices, as purchasing pros continually
hear. However, service providers are often small organizations, so it may be
necessary for the purchasing organization to assist the provider to develop a
cost model. A cost model used for materials may be adapted for services.
3. Clearly deﬁne the roles of both parties. “Both parties must be clear on
which company and precisely who within the company is responsible for the
various alliance activities,” explains Smeltzer. For service alliances especially,
the major responsibility may include the approval of variances. Therefore, it
is important to know who may approve last minute variations.
4. Develop evaluation measures. Simply said, however, in service alliances
the evaluation may be subjective. Because it is subjective, it is important that
the supplier understand the evaluators’ biases and how best to work with
them. Also, it is helpful to develop a checklist to assist the process.
“Evaluation measures should ideally be developed by the alliance part-
ners,” Roberts notes. “Each party likely has differing expertise and perspec-
tives.” Therefore, joint collaboration on the development of the measures
will ensure that the parties take advantage of the expertise and consider both
perspectives.
Wehr adds, “Mutually acceptable measurement methods must be de-
ﬁned to include both data collection and data analysis. This is particularly
critical since the buyer and the supplier may use different criteria for assess-
ing the same performance area.”
960
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

5. Establish formal communication systems between both parties. It must be
formal, Roberts insists. Again, it is important that the communication pro-
cedures be agreed upon early in the alliance discussions. “Formal commu-
nication is especially important with services because service conditions and
standards may vary from day to day,” according to Smeltzer. “It is important
these variances are understood by both parties.”
6. Continually evaluate service performance. As opposed to materials, ser-
vices cannot be put on the shelf. Services are generally independent of each
other and may require independent evaluations.
While related to measurements and formal communications, the rec-
ommendation is to communicate the measurements among the parties.
Also, the more frequent the evaluation is, the better. It must be balanced on
number and complexity, however. Here again, a primary difference between
services and materials is that the service provider is often being directly eval-
uated. Evaluating people is far different from evaluating a product.
7. Develop problem-solving and dispute resolution procedures. No alliance is
without some problems. If both parties know they have a vehicle by which
their concerns may be heard, they will probably be more willing to express
their viewpoints and suggestions.

Purchasing professionals are becoming increasingly aggressive when rene-
gotiating contracts with their suppliers. In their quest to achieve the best cost
proﬁle, improve supplier performance, and garner additional services, buy-
ers are not hesitant to bring the supplier “back to the table.”
Contract renegotiation, driven by small and midsize companies (less
than 500 employees), is quickly becoming the hottest supplier management
technique in use. Among the purchasing professionals in these facilities, the
rate has soared by more than 20%. Overall, Supplier Selection and Management
Report reader surveys show an almost 17% increase in contract renegotiations
over the past three years alone. 
Readers are achieving wide-ranging success in their renegotiation ini-
tiatives. Many have shared their experiences with us. Next we present some
of the tactics, challenges, and beneﬁts of their efforts.
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating
961

Cost reduction a primary consideration.
A purchasing engineering manager at
a midsize maker of ink ﬁnds that renegotiating existing supplier contracts
saves “substantial amounts of money.” In fact, for the last two quarters, sav-
ings amounted to more than $400,000.
Additionally, “engineering and plant operations people have their own
preferences, and the suppliers know it,” he mentions. In the past this rela-
tionship had created a noncompetitive situation. However, the purchasing
engineering manager resolved it by discussing alternative options with the
engineers before the purchase, and requested at least two bidders on certain
types of purchases.
Take advantage of falling prices.
“Don’t only look to renegotiate an existing
contract when prices are increasing,” advises the purchasing vice president
of a midsize manufacturer. “Our buyers continuously monitor the suppliers’
market, and with the downward trend in the cost of oil, energy, and other
raw material components, they began to renegotiate our existing contracts
to reﬂect these lower supplier costs,” he explains. “We also have worked with
our domestic suppliers to counter the lower-priced Asian imports,” he adds. 
Initiate supplier cost improvement programs.
“We use ‘should cost’ analysis to
renegotiate existing supplier contracts,” maintains the manager of coordi-
nated purchases at a large producer of water sports equipment. “Going
through this exercise has allowed us to call in our current suppliers and ask
for price concessions and encourage them to begin their own cost reduction
initiatives.” 
To help them with their “should cost” models, the organization has cre-
ated a “new data ﬁle on our suppliers which identiﬁes cost drivers and de-
tails on their operations. Many of our suppliers are cooperating and sharing
their conﬁdential information with us,” he reveals.
Contract renegotiation helps to reduce inventory.
“Our biggest challenge has
been to take 30% out of the total raw material and purchased goods inven-
tory,” a director of materials at a large customizer of trailers and coaches of-
fers. “We’ve already taken it down by about one-third by renegotiating lot
sizes with our suppliers and having them make smaller, more frequent de-
liveries to our site.” In addition, he tells of providing more information to
key suppliers. “The results are very positive, even though our freight cost has
increased slightly,” he mentions.

Move the suppliers to the level needed to support the buying organization.
“We
have established a supplier quality management process and a supplier de-
velopment process to improve the performance of our primary suppliers,”
says the materials director at a midsize producer of projection systems. “We
then renegotiated the existing supplier contracts based on activity-based
costing and supplier benchmarking.” Annual savings moved to $14 million
against the prior year’s purchase price paid.
Renegotiation leads to greater product improvements.
“For the ﬁrst time in our
history, we’ve begun to renegotiate our existing supply agreements,” says the
director of global sourcing at a large manufacturer of packaging products.
“We implemented the new provisions by sharing more information with
our suppliers and expanding the business we do with them.” In addition, the
new contracts call for the suppliers to become more active in product im-
provement processes. All in all, the company has achieved more than $2 mil-
lion in cost reductions.
Revisit pricing issues on single-source items.
“Several single-source items were
introduced to other potential suppliers for cost reduction ideas and pricing,”
describes a materials manager at a midsize manufacturer of luggage. “We ad-
vised our existing supply base what we were doing. They quickly renegoti-
ated their contracts, coming back with substantial price reductions to ensure
that they kept the business.” 
New contract involves suppliers in inventory management.
“Since renegotiating
our existing supplier contracts, we have saved time for our buyers and money
for the corporation,” says a buyer at a small producer of linear motion sys-
tems. “The suppliers are now responsible for the inventory, monitoring it
and stocking it on a weekly basis, according to our needs.” 
New business conditions create the “opportunity” to renegotiate.
A director of
purchasing at a large maker of consumer products is challenged by the num-
ber of mergers and acquisitions taking place in the commodity market. “Ne-
gotiating and keeping a contract is difﬁcult and time-consuming under these
circumstances,” he laments. “But we’re continually renegotiating existing
supplier contracts because of the dramatic changes in supply that have oc-
curred from these mergers, and the increasing demand we have due to busi-
ness growth.”

Review value of goods with the suppliers.
“We’re actively renegotiating our
existing contracts,” maintains the materials group director at a small pro-
ducer of lighting ﬁxtures. However, as part of the renegotiation process,
they call in their suppliers and discuss the market value of their goods. Ad-
ditionally, the director researches alternative suppliers. “What we’re doing
in renegotiation is putting the supplier in control of its own destiny,” he ar-
gues.
Advantageous negotiation position a beneﬁt from being acquired.
“We have been
acquired by a larger organization with facilities that purchase similar mate-
rials from numerous suppliers,” explains a purchasing manager at a midsize
company that makes body panels for trucks. “One of the ﬁrst activities we
undertook was to reduce our supply base and to concentrate on the volume
purchase of these similar materials.” To date, they have successfully renego-
tiated supplier contracts for glass, resin ﬁlm, and coatings, saving over $1 mil-
lion annually.
Falling currency exchange rates create an opportunity to renegotiate.
The sourcing
vice president at a large producer of recreational vehicles renegotiated
“economies” on power train components with its foreign sources. “We
leveraged competitive source alternatives with the weakening currency to
yield a 12% improvement in component cost,” he explains. Annual savings
total more than $3 million.
Rework contract to maintain credibility with customer.
For a unique reason, a
senior buyer of materials at a small producer of hot forged parts renegotiated
its steel contract with its present supplier. “We extended the contract to
three years with a minimum volume,” he describes. “The reason it was done
was to maintain credibility with our primary customer and assure that we
had a reliable and steady raw material supply.” Nevertheless, the new terms
in the renegotiation resulted in a six-ﬁgure savings.

Purchase order (PO) terms and conditions (T&Cs) are legal documents. As
such, they require periodic review and revision. Because individual com-

pany management determines what to include, T&Cs can range from a
simple statement to a comprehensive document covering any and all possi-
bilities. 
To help establish what should be in a “good” set of PO terms and con-
ditions, we present the following examples from Purchaser’s Legal Adviser
(Business Laws; Chesterland, Ohio; 404-729-7996). We endorse them as a
foundation from which to draft a version that ﬁts your requirements. As
usual, consult your corporate counsel before ﬁnalizing your own T&C lan-
guage. 
“Acceptance. Seller’s acceptance of any PO shall be expressly limited to
the terms of the contract. The purchaser objects to contrary terms contained
in any quotation, order, acknowledgement, invoice, or other document
originating with the seller. Any terms and conditions printed on any pur-
chase order, any release order, acknowledgement, invoice or other docu-
ment issued by either seller or purchaser that conﬂict with these terms and
conditions are superseded by these terms and conditions. By shipping goods
or performing services after receipt of a purchase order, seller shall conclu-
sively be deemed to be bound by these terms and conditions and all other
provisions of the contract.
“Price. The price shall be that stated in the purchase order. That is, un-
less that price exceeds the lowest price at which the seller is selling items or
similar items to its other customers as of the date of delivery to purchaser. In
this case, the lower price shall control.
“If there is no price stated in the purchase order, the price shall not be
higher than that last charged or quoted purchaser for such items by the seller.
If there has been no charge or quotation by the seller to purchaser for items
previously, and if no price is set forth in the purchase order, purchaser shall
have the right to return items with seller paying the cost of transportation.
That is, if the seller charges a price which is in excess of the lowest price at
which the seller is selling items to its other customers as of the date of deliv-
ery to the purchaser. 
“If prior to delivery of the items, purchaser is able to purchase a portion
of all of the items, or similar items of like quality, and at a price which is less,
purchaser shall notify seller. Should seller fail to meet the lower price, pur-
chaser may, at its option, purchase from the other source at the lower price.
In this event, purchaser and seller shall be relieved of their obligations under
the contract in respect to the items or similar items purchased from the other

source. The price shall include any freight charges or sales, use or other sim-
ilar taxes. No such charges or taxes shall be paid by the purchaser.
“Drawings and speciﬁcations. Speciﬁcations, drawings, notes, instructions,
engineering information, or technical data furnished by either purchaser or
seller to the other, or referred to in the contract shall be incorporated into the
contract by the reference. Seller shall be fully and solely responsible for ob-
taining product data adequate to design, manufacture, fabricate, construct,
and deliver the items in compliance with all requirements of the contract.
“Purchaser shall retain title to all such documents which it provides or
causes to be given to seller. Seller shall not use any of such documents or the
information contained therein for any purpose other than in performance of
the contract. 
“Seller shall not disclose such documents or information to any party
other than the purchaser or party duly authorized by the purchaser. Upon
purchaser’s request, seller shall promptly return to purchaser all such docu-
ments and copies.
“Changes. Purchaser shall have the right to make changes (including ad-
ditions and/or omissions) from time to time in the items, any speciﬁcations
and/or drawings which are part of the contract, method of shipment or
packing and/or time and/or place of delivery. Purchaser shall give seller
written notice of any such change.
“The notice may include any increase or decrease in the cost of, or the
time required for performance of the contract determined by the purchaser
to be appropriate. If seller does not agree with such adjustments, or if the no-
tice does not contain any such adjustments, seller shall still be obligated to
proceed immediately with all of the changes directed by the purchaser with-
out waiting to reach an agreement on any adjustments.
“Any claims by the seller for adjustments after its receipt of purchaser’s
change order must be asserted in writing to purchaser not more than ten days
after such receipt by seller or such claim shall be null and void.
“Delivery. The seller shall deliver the items to purchaser on the date(s)
indicated in the purchase order. If seller fails to make delivery of any part of
the items on the date(s) indicated, the purchaser may terminate the contract
and pursue other remedies.
“All shipments shall be delivered FOB to the destination designated by
the purchaser in the purchase order. Risk of loss of shall remain with the
seller until the items in a completed state are received by the purchaser, its
agent or consignee, regardless of whether or not purchaser has made full
payment for the items.

“A packing slip must accompany each such shipment. If a shipment is to
a consignee or an agent of the purchaser, a copy of the packing slip shall be
forwarded concurrently to the purchaser. If no such packing slip is sent, the
count or weight by purchaser or its agent or consignee is agreed to be ﬁnal
and binding.
“The seller, or the carrier it uses to transport items, whichever is appli-
cable, shall maintain a satisfactory safety rating from the U.S. Department of
Transportation. The seller or carrier shall provide purchaser with written
proof of such rating on request if the carrier is a motor carrier. 
“It shall maintain comprehensive general liability body injury and prop-
erty damage insurance in the amount speciﬁed in the T&C relating to insur-
ance. That is, unless a larger amount is required by any federal, state, or local
regulatory agency. In that event, such larger amount shall be maintained.
“Warranty. Seller warrants that for a period of four years after the deliv-
ery of or performance of the items to or for the purchaser, the items will be
of merchantable quality. Also, ﬁt for the purchaser’s particular purpose, be of
high quality, and free from defects in material and workmanship. In addi-
tion, they shall comply with the most stringent of purchaser’s or seller’s spec-
iﬁcations, performance guarantees, and requirements; and, comply with all
nationally recognized codes and established industry standards.
“All items shall be sold by the seller to the purchaser free and clear of any
encumbrances. Seller’s warranties and guarantees shall survive inspection,
delivery and acceptance of the items and/or payment by purchaser. If items
do not conform to any of these warranties, then, at the purchaser’s option,
seller shall repair or replace the defective items, FOB purchaser’s designated
site at seller’s expense. Or, in the case of services, re-perform the services at
seller’s expense.
“Seller shall be responsible for all expenses and damages which pur-
chaser incurs, including, but not limited to incidental and consequential
damages. The foregoing warranties and obligations also shall apply to the
items supplied by the seller in such repair, replacement, or re-performance.
Seller shall pass on to purchaser the beneﬁt of any manufacturer warranties.
“Payments and invoices. The speciﬁc terms of payment for all items are
stated in the purchase order. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, there or in a sepa-
rate written instrument signed by the purchaser, no invoice shall be issued
before shipment or performance of the items covered thereby. No payment
shall be made before receipt of items and of a proper invoice for such items.
“Purchaser may withhold any payment otherwise due under the con-
tract to such extent as necessary to protect purchaser from loss. That loss may

Supplier negotiations can (and sometimes should) be contentious. But even
less pleasant, and far less useful, is a negotiation that is not grounded in fact.
The way to avoid such a situation is to present a supplier brief. A supplier
brief is your company’s formal statement of its preferred arrangement with
the supplier. An essential component of any complex, fact-based negotia-
tion, a supplier brief can transform the process and accelerate it toward its
logical conclusion.
Even a simple brief, comparing price indexes against individual suppli-
ers, can provide the supplier with a powerful weapon.
Why a supplier brief?
Brieﬁng your suppliers on your preferred positions
prior to negotiation serves several important purposes:
Control.
By starting the discussion with an explanation of your needs, you
can take control of the process. Further, negotiations have a tendency to
wander off track, especially if multiple contentious issues are on the table.
The brief, written for all to see and available to everyone in the meeting,
provides a starting point to return to whenever the process starts to slip away.
Documentation.
As a complex negotiation continues, promises may be
made on both sides regarding seemingly small points. Laying these points
out in advance provides a visual checklist of the progress of the negotiation.
An annotated copy of the brief serves as a record of agreements and out-
standing issues after the meeting has concluded.
Developing the brief.
Synthesize the facts about the supplier and its rela-
tionship with your company into a compelling argument. This can be as
968
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

simple as a few ratios and trends insights or as sophisticated as a detailed sup-
plier cost model.
If you identify a target cost for the supplier’s products, and a reasonable
schedule for meeting the terms, the supplier will be forced to raise speciﬁc
objections to your points. Throwing up his hands and objecting to the pro-
cess will not help his cause at this point.
Present the information in a logical structure.
This will convey to the supplier
the importance of the company’s requirements. The organization might in-
clude:
• The current situation as you understand it.
Here, explain your request.
A presentation of the situation should include a summary of your opinion of
your relationship with this supplier. Include both its history and your vision
for the future. Also, restate their case to demonstrate your understanding and
highlight the areas you want to address.
• Deﬁne the problem you want resolved.
This section should be well sup-
ported by relevant data (see sidebar, below). The points made here can in-
clude purchasing trends in volume and market share, estimates of the sup-
plier’s cost structure in input prices, labor rates, and expected margins. The
sustainability of the business, the history of the supplier’s delivery perfor-
mance, and the quantitative impact that all of this is having on your com-
pany also comprise useful information.
The message should be straightforward and easily understood, but gen-
erally not a laundry list of complaints.
Recommend how to restore or extend the relationship.
This section of the brief
should state your business requirements in both ﬁnancial and quantitative
terms. It also should propose ways to resolve the issue together. If need be,
it may simply state what the supplier must do to retain your business.
Consistent application of this brieﬁng format with the same suppliers
will enable them to grasp the information more quickly, understand your
company’s reasons for presenting it, and even refute those of your arguments
that may not quite hit the mark.
Anticipate the response.
You also must anticipate the supplier response and
develop a strategy for conducting the negotiation. For your most important
accounts, you may even consider holding a “mock trial” in which members
Partnering Techniques and Negotiating
969

of your procurement organization play the roles of the supplier’s negotiators.
Among the objections the suppliers might put forth are the following:
• “Indexes and cost structures are averages, and don’t apply to us.” A truly pre-
pared supplier will often bring his own brief intended to refute what he an-
ticipates your arguments will be.
• “We have a better quality product that requires us to charge more.” A quan-
titative analysis of which product attributes are important to you and which
are not can resolve this dispute.
970
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T
How Relevant Data Can Be Presented in Supplier Brief
Consider a brief suggesting improvements in the supplier’s cost structure, and
the impact that the pie chart (see Figure III-4.3) of the supplier’s cost struc-
ture could have on a supplier’s arguments. Suppose that the producer price in-
dex for the supplier’s industry has been trending upward. In this case, though,
the particular supplier uses an alternative input—Raw material #2—whose
cost has actually been dropping. Thus, while costs for the rest of the industry
may have been up signiﬁcantly, total costs in this relationship have been nearly
ﬂat. Without a deconstruction of the supplier’s inputs, this understanding of
the speciﬁc cost structure would have been lost. Information like this enables
the negotiating team to assess the impact of those changes on the supplier’s
overall cost. If the company has leverage, it can negotiate with the supplier to
share in those savings.
Without question, it is often difﬁcult to determine a supplier’s exact cost
structure. However, estimating the cost structure based on industry informa-
tion and discussing the ﬁndings with the supplier may cause the supplier to
yield useful data about its speciﬁc cost structure. The information revealed can
be very important in understanding the reality behind the numbers.

• “Your buyers accepted those price increases when they were ﬁrst imposed.”
Putting supplier briefs into your negotiating program can startle your long-
time suppliers. This does not, however, change the economics of your busi-
ness or the relationship.
What will you agree to?
Outlining your fallback plan in the brief can focus
the supplier’s attention by showing him how serious you are. Take care,
however, not to reveal just how much of his preferred position you will ac-
cept before opting out. You will want to preserve maneuvering room within
the negotiation. 
Are you going through this process with everyone else?
Though its exact mean-
ing is elusive, suppliers often seem more satisﬁed with fairness. Supplier
briefs should be developed for any signiﬁcant negotiation simply out of the
economic beneﬁts they bring.
Present, discuss, negotiate.
The ﬁnal steps in the process are to present the
brief, listen to the supplier’s position, and negotiate an agreement that meets
the deﬁned goals. The brief should support this ultimate goal by properly
framing the discussion.
In general, the outcome of the negotiation will most strongly depend on
the underlying economics—that is, who in the relationship holds the bal-
ance of power. But properly phrasing the question does not hurt. That is, be-

cause you are unlikely to get that for which you do not ask, your stated so-
lution should stretch the supplier’s abilities. The negotiations themselves will
uncover what is reasonable in the long term.
Finally, the conclusion of the negotiations should include a discussion of
the effectiveness of the brief. Reactions of individuals should be noted and
maintained in a ﬁle so that the information is available for the next round or
the next time you entertain bids.
Constructing a supplier brief is not a small feat. But because it can be so
effective as a supplier management tool, you should capitalize on every use-
ful lesson gleaned from its application.

“While the Web can alleviate clerical functions, it is not going to replace hu-
man intelligence for strategic sourcing and supplier relations,” maintains
Thomas T. Stallkamp, vice chairman and CEO of MSC International, Inc.
(Southﬁeld, Mich.; www.msxi.com). “You may be able to auction off mops
and brooms online, but no one should auction off a company’s relationships
with its suppliers,” he emphasized in his keynote address at a recent National
Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) Annual Internal Purchas-
ing Conference.
Purchasing at a true crossroad in its direction?
“After the decade of the ‘nineties,
where we sort of came into our own as a respected and even sought-after
discipline, the current business discourse is about how purchasing might be
eliminated by the Internet and the wonder of industry supply exchanges,”
said Stallkamp, the former vice chairman of DaimlerChrysler and member
of the management board of DaimlerChrysler AG.
“Well, I for one don’t think so,” encouraged Stallkamp, who is credited
with revolutionizing procurement practices and supplier management rela-
tions in the automotive sector—if not industry in general—by fostering
supplier involvement through partnerships and alliances, while serving in
various purchasing and operational positions at Chrysler before being named
president in 1998.
973

What does the Web mean to me and my job?
“We need to recognize that the
Web is really here and offers a great opportunity to free us from clerical
drudgery,” Stallkamp emphasized. It also
• Permits more strategic buying. “It allows purchasing professionals to plan
commodity/supplier strategies,” he notes.
• Provides opportunity to be the in-house expert. “It’s more than a ﬁnance
tool or a cost reduction mechanism. But as supply professionals, you need to
quickly seize the opportunity to inform and guide your management on
how to use the exchanges,” maintains Stallkamp.
• Opens the door for supply chain management. “Now is the time to em-
brace the changes and broaden the role of purchasing to include the larger,
more centralized aspect of total supply chain management,” he continues.
“Some of these initiatives won’t make you the most popular person with
your peers, but if you approach it constructively, you can make your current
assignment more interesting and valuable to you personally and to your
company.”
He urges, “We should all become champions of supply chain manage-
ment and educate and inform senior management of its advantages.”
Web procurement’s role and the purchasing professional.
“By itself, the Internet
will not automate you away,” Stallkamp assures. “It is a tool to be mastered,
not feared. What it can do is free you up to spend more time thinking and
planning, rather than reacting or performing clerical functions,” he shares.
“The Web-based exchanges offer the best, cheapest, and fastest way to
communicate to customers, suppliers, and manufacturers,” he explains. He
has distilled the common elements of a successful Internet buying exchange
into the following:
• Establish true neutrality. “The exchange must operate independent of
a company’s control to make suppliers believe they aren’t being ‘used,’” he
declares.
•
Deﬁne who owns the data. It cannot be left to “happen.”
•
Guarantee the proprietary nature of data. He recalls how one automo-
tive OEM got into “enormous” trouble by sending supplier drawings to
others in the chain without permission.
•
Share savings from higher volume. The savings must be shared with the
974
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

chain instead of retained by the owner of the exchange, he explains, ad-
vancing a practice he instituted at Chrysler with the individual suppliers.
• Provide broad access to industry competitors. “Let everyone in, rather than
form company-speciﬁc portals,” he urged.
“Web procurement portals offer to free companies from the cost, time,
and errors of clerical transactions,” Stallkamp repeats for emphasis. The
transactions that can be reduced or eliminated by the Web include things
such as vendor identiﬁcation and selection, review and approval, order pro-
cessing, and payment. Most of these items are related to the issuance of
quotes and orders.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs goes beyond these clerical areas to “pick up
the inventory and cycle time reductions that the Web can eventually pro-
vide.” They estimate that current procurement costs can be reduced by a
third through the Web. “The savings in the chain equals over $4.5 billion
per year,” he reports. “No wonder CEOs and CFOs have awakened to the
intrigue of Web procurement,” he comments.
The “new” opportunity for supply chain management.
“But I believe the future
offers even more,” Stallkamp declares. “For more than half of my profes-
sional life I’ve been trying to move companies beyond purchasing into
supply chain management,” he shares. Purchasing is only one component of
supply chain management.
True supply chain management deals with strategic buying, production
control and scheduling, inventory management, demand forecasting, and
warranty or customer follow-up. “All of the functions in your company can,
should, and will continue as Web communication accelerates the speed of
information ﬂow,” he believes.
However, his view of the supply chain has changed over the years.
“Most people, to explain a chain, usually show a horizontal connection of
the links supporting a manufactured product or services as it moves toward
customers.”
Instead of a horizontal chain, it is really a vertical X, with the pinch
point, or control mechanism, at the point of intersection. “All chains have a
control, whether expressed or not,” he explains.
“We can use the Internet to communicate with the various links in the
chain,” he offers. As a tool, the Internet offers many advantages. He cites
instantaneous connections of information, sharing plans and information
throughout the chain, consolidating volume for lower costs of standard
E-Purchasing/E-Supply Chain

components, and signiﬁcantly improving the engineering “learning” so that
they do not have to reinvent for each new project or product.
Stallkamp’s point of differentiation.
“There is much more out there than on-
line auctions for the lowest bid or whipping commodities lower,” he ob-
serves. “Web procurement has a true role as a tool to allow companies to get
out of the cost of clerical functions. But we must rise above that issue and re-
alize that managing supply and supply relationships is more challenging,” he
insists.
To rise to this challenge, supply professionals must combine ﬁnancial
skills with negotiation and strategic planning. They must master oral and writ-
ten communication and have the ability to see a broader picture than the cost
per unit of an item.
“No matter what new tools or systems we use, the fact remains that
companies can have strong relationships, just like individuals,” he explains.
“The Internet should not be allowed to depersonalize those relationships.
The development and management of a company’s supplier relationships is
the responsibility of the purchasing and supply functions of a ﬁrm,” Stall-
kamp ﬁrmly declared.

If there were ever any doubts about the viability of e-procurement, the re-
cent NAPM Annual International Purchasing Conference (www.napm.org)
dispelled them. The following should help get you to the next step in
e-commerce.
Build your e-procurement roadmap.
Richard G. Weissman, CPM, director of
purchasing at PurchasingCenter.com (Burlington, Mass.; weissman@pur-
chasingcenter.com), points out that e-commerce tools “must match both
your organizational and personal needs.” A member of the Supplier Selection
and Management Report editorial advisory board, Weissman recommends that
purchasers “build an e-commerce roadmap.” This roadmap must
• Align business goals. “Make sure the goals of your supply management
organization match the goals of your business and customers,” he empha-
sizes. Only then can you translate these requirements to the supplier com-
976
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

munity. It is important that this alignment reﬂect the entire business func-
tion, not just e-commerce-related processes, he warns. “The rewards come
from automating good practices.”
• Assemble a cross-functional team. “Do not do it alone,” he stresses. There
are levels of expertise throughout your organization, so seek team members
who have passion, subject matter knowledge, and commitment.
• Develop a technology plan. “E-commerce need not be expensive, nor a
proprietary software program,” Weissman assures. Review basic technol-
ogies and business needs. The prevailing advice is to start small and grow the
process. Speak with your suppliers and customers. “Design an e-commerce
process that is applicable and scalable to your business and organization,”
he advises. “Benchmark, research, and investigate. Be open, but cautious,” he
encourages.
• Motivate and train employees and suppliers. Buyers may have to sell the
merits internally and with suppliers. Make e-commerce education and train-
ing part of supplier and employee reviews. Set reasonable and obtainable ex-
pectations and track performance, he itemizes.
• Review, revise, and revisit. “E-commerce is exploding and changing on
a daily basis,” Weissman notes. “Be prepared to react to those changes.”
Sort out your options.
Kevin J. Williams, purchasing specialist at ESPN, Inc.
(Bristol, Conn.; kevin.j.williams@espn.com), readily acknowledges that
“getting your e-commerce efforts off the ground is usually the hardest part.”
His approach begins by “sorting out what your options are, determining
which are viable, and identifying what resources are needed to make these
options happen.” Once done, group them into three categories, which will
help you develop an e-commerce plan:
• Easy options. “These require little, if any, changes to the systems you
already have in place,” he notes. They will typically include generic external
options and may include some internal systems. An “easy” option is e-mail,
which is “ideal for any task that requires tracking, is extremely well-suited
to expediting and follow-up, and is invaluable for bidding work,” Williams
says. Another tool is e-fax, which can be sent directly to your desktop,
viewed online, and attached to electronic purchase orders (POs) for backup.
• Moderate options. These require a little effort but can be implemented
in a relatively short period of time (6 to 12 months). He lists scanners as one
moderate option. “With good-quality models costing as low as $135,
E-Purchasing/E-Supply Chain
977

scanners allow you to convert hardcopy bids, sales literature, and even pol-
icy and procedure documents into ﬁles that can be attached into your other
systems,” he explains.
Web-based price comparison sites are another. Even if you do not in-
tend to purchase directly from the merchants that are linked to these ser-
vices, you can develop a strong feel for what you should be paying for a given
product.
• Challenging options. “These require additional time, often more than
a year, and money that you may not have at your disposal immediately,” he
explains. The key here is to make the most effective use of the time it will
take. For example, shop around to get a feel for what your favorite e-
commerce solutions cost. Work on the justiﬁcation and budget requests well
before your budget ﬁgures are due,” he suggests. “This will allow for proper
planning and a higher likelihood of success.”
Estimate the “true” costs for e-procurement systems.
Russ Boyd, supply con-
tracts manager at Perot Systems Corporation (Plano, Texas; russ.boyd@ps.
net) warns, “Oftentimes cost will be erroneously equated to the price of the
software while many of the other true costs are ignored or forgotten.” He
identiﬁes some of the relevant costs as the following:
• Software cost. This is the most obvious and sometimes the biggest cost
involved with an e-commerce procurement solution. “It is important to do
as much research as possible to benchmark the right solution cost for your
company size and application goals,” he explains.
• Implementation cost. This cost can rival software cost, and it is critical
to capture both external (supplier-provided) and internal costs. Some of the
key internal resources required may include a project manager, systems an-
alysts, business analysts, programmers, procurement personnel, and others.
• Hardware cost. Most of the e-commerce procurement solution pro-
viders have recommended hardware to run the solution effectively. Make
sure you analyze this cost early in the decision process so that there are no
surprises in the end.
• Additional software cost. Most of the providers can help identify what
additional software is required to run their solution on a given hardware and
operating system platform, but identify the required additional software
early in the process.
978
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

• Software/hardware maintenance costs. There will be ongoing mainte-
nance and support costs, which are typically in the range of 12% to 20% of
the purchase price of the hardware/software. “Make sure the software main-
tenance costs include all updates and enhancements, as well as error correc-
tions,” Boyd details. “Make sure that priority deﬁnitions, response times, and
resolution time service levels are included along with an escalation proce-
dure, and remedies for failure to meet agreed-upon service levels.”
• Ongoing support costs. These costs are for any required consulting, cat-
alog maintenance, internal system maintenance (backups, help desk), ongo-
ing training and updates, and transaction fees associated with the chosen so-
lution. Identify these costs in the purchase decision process, he emphasizes. 
• Miscellaneous costs. These are the most overlooked and include train-
ing, customization, facilities, and utility allocations related to the required
hardware and software, telecommunication costs, among others.
Capture the anticipated savings.
“E-commerce procurement solutions offer a
huge and varied savings potential,” Boyd explains. To determine the poten-
tial savings, “determine what the cost of doing business is under the current
system.” The potential areas of savings include the following:
• Productivity improvement savings. “Savings related to productivity im-
provements are sometimes difﬁcult to sell to management and ﬁnance since
there is no reduction of head count,” Boyd acknowledges. But if expressed
as a future cost avoidance, the ability to increase workload without the ad-
dition of head count, a best-in-class company will recognize these improve-
ments as actual cost savings, he notes. Examples include time saved in creat-
ing requisitions, tracking submitted requisitions, and approving requisitions.
• Procurement resource reallocation savings. E-commerce procurement so-
lutions automate the procurement process and eliminate non-value-added
redundant work. Therefore, buyers may be retrained as supply managers,
sourcing specialists, and contract managers focusing on the strategic man-
agement of the supplier. This will lead to a reduction in head count in the
procurement department and reallocation of those resources to other areas
of the company. The savings from this should include not only annual salary
but also beneﬁts and overhead allocations.
• Material cost reduction savings. E-commerce procurement solutions
help to eliminate maverick purchasing and consolidate procured goods and
E-Purchasing/E-Supply Chain
979

services to preferred suppliers. Typical savings from this consolidation is 1%
to 3% of the total annual spend of goods and services.
• Increased P-card utilization savings. A key feature of a “good” e-com-
merce procurement solution is the ability to process transactions directly and
electronically with a supplier using a P-card for payment. Savings accrue
from increased rebates (for buying speciﬁed volume levels) and a decrease in
the number of invoices required to be processed by accounts payable.
• Electronic expense report savings. This feature or option (depending on
the solution) increases productivity since the time required to create an ex-
pense report is reduced. It includes automatic population of the expense re-
port, automated routing and approval using the same work-ﬂow routing and
approval engine as the procurement solution, and reduced follow-up on ap-
provals and payment of expense reports. Additional savings are achieved in
accounts payable through the reduction of paper expense reports and elec-
tronic processing.
• Cycle time reduction savings. These are the most difficult savings to
determine and validate. Depending on your type of business, the reduc-
tion in the cycle time from requisition creation to order placement, and
extending to delivery from the supplier, may be able to be calculated as
cost savings, Boyd offers. “If your business is time-dependent upon the de-
livery of goods and services, then this is probably the case. Your senior
management and finance organization can help you with this determina-
tion,” he explains.

The Web-based procurement revolution is underway, as a walk through the
exhibit area at the recent NAPM Annual International Purchasing Confer-
ence quickly showed. Additionally, an on-site Visa USA survey of conferees
revealed that 67% currently engage in some form of e-purchasing, up 10
percentage points from last year. Of those who do not, 80% said they would
in the future—up 26 percentage points from just two years ago. The inter-

A successful online procurement implementation includes a strategy for e-
procurement, a comprehensive software evaluation, and a sound business
plan. One company that was able to derive a successful e-procurement so-
lution by following this approach is the Mobil Corporation.
Mobil’s nine-week e-procurement project.
Typically, e-purchasing projects can
go on for an indeterminate time. However, Mobil devised a nine-week se-
lection process—and stuck to it.
Dan Quinn, former electronic commerce manager of procurement,
Global Products Organization, Mobil Corporation, expresses, “When you
look at the work that was done in a nine-week period, it’s pretty amazing to
go from really not knowing what you’re going to do, to having a great idea
about what you want to do.”
988
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

Quinn, now senior manager at Ernst & Young LLP (McLean, Va.;
daniel.quinn@ey.com), outlined the Mobil e-procurement approach at
ePurchasing 2000 (International Quality & Productivity Center; Little Falls,
N.J.; www.iqpc.com). The fundamentals critical for a successful e-procure-
ment effort include the following:
• Determine scope/priorities, clarify objectives, and write charter. “Take the
process approach, ignore organization boundaries,” he advises. “It’s really
important to get your business strategy right up front.” At Mobil, for ex-
ample, one fundamental strategy for the procurement group was to put low
spend on P-cards. However, when investigating the various e-procurement
front-end solutions, they found that some do not support a P-card.
• Pick team with appropriate skills. “This has gotten a lot harder than it used
to be because no one person knows all of the technology or business proces-
ses,” Quinn describes. “Get all of the right skills on the team covered, or the
team’s not going to work and you’re not going to get the results you need.”
For one project, the team’s business side was represented by the team lead,
ERP data coding specialist, commodity lead, ﬁeld procurement specialist, and
a staff procurement specialist. Technical side representatives included the IS
team lead and specialists knowledgeable in electronic catalog and ERP, Inter-
net, and IT internal plumbing and EDI. Other skills, as identiﬁed, were avail-
able to the team on an as-needed basis, usually for a day or two at a time.
• Establish project plan with aggressive timetable. It is difﬁcult to gain re-
sources and commitment for long-term projects. Quinn advises, “Available
resources are too tight as it is, so the question becomes how can you boil this
down and do it fast.”
• Conduct a rigorous evaluation of the available e-procurement alternatives.
“Really think this through,” Quinn advises. “The devil’s in the details and
you have to really understand these various packages because the answer for
one company is not necessarily the answer for yours.”
For one project the team began with 24 potential e-procurement solu-
tion providers. “We ﬁrst did two hour telephone interviews with each to see
which would make it to our short list,” Quinn describes. They put together
a one-page list of questions, conducted the phone interviews, and whittled
the list to 10 potentials. Each of these then received a 30-page RFP, and a
description of Mobil’s purchase-to-pay process.
“The half-day demos by the vendors had to follow our prescribed sce-
narios and not their dog-and-pony show,” Quinn explains. “We wanted
E-Purchasing/E-Supply Chain
989

them to show us how their system was going to do our transactions.” Inter-
estingly, when the vendors got to a certain step, they either did not do it or
could not complete it.
“We would not have known about that if they just came in and did their
own thing,” he allows. “But when they had to follow our script and do all of
the steps, it showed us what their system could do and couldn’t do. It was
very revealing.”
• Develop a business case for an e-procurement solution. “We did a business
case, it pays out a lot of money, and it’s deﬁnitely worth doing,” notes Quinn.
The beneﬁts of e-procurement fall into three buckets: total system costs,
transaction costs, and internal controls. According to Quinn the major cost
saving contribution is found in the reduction of total system costs (see Table
III-5.1). “A lot of people are spending time on the other two, but this is
where the money is.”
• Recommend a solution, develop an implementation plan. “There are three
choices: do nothing, do a pilot, or roll it out globally,” Quinn explains.
There is no one right answer, as each method has its own set of risks and
rewards (see Table III-5.2).

At Mobil the choice was to do a pilot. “In doing a pilot we got a lot of
valuable experience in three areas,” Quinn notes. They include the following:
• How difﬁcult is it to “really bring up my suppliers electronically?” Accord-
ing to Quinn, “A pilot gives you a feel for how easy this is going to be to
hook up suppliers. In our case, we’re not talking about one or two, but about
hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of suppliers.”
• How easy is it to integrate with my ERP? “Vendors all tell you it’s easy,
but how long does it take? How expensive is it? How integrated is it, really,
at the end?” he inquires. “After running through a trial, you’re going to un-
derstand what it means to integrate this front end with your ERP,” he ex-
plains.
• How easy is it for my buyers to purchase items with this solution? “I may
bring them into the room during selection to test it, but the real test is what
do they think about it after using it for three months?” he asks. “Run the pi-
lot for ﬁve months, no longer, and you’ll understand a lot more than you did
beforehand.”

Inc. (Boston; llapide@amrresearch.com), observes, “Innovative companies
have gained control of their supply chain by electronically connecting to
trading partners using EDI and the Internet.”
He further believes that more companies will follow suit. However, in
a special report (The Innovators Will Control the E-Supply Chain) he recom-

mends purchasing professionals adopt the following to achieve success and
satisfaction:
• Develop a formal e-supply chain strategy. “Outline how you will use
the Internet to improve your supply chain operations and support your 
e-commerce efforts,” he explains. Determine your core competencies and
eventually push out the rest to trading partners through electronic connec-
tivity in real time. This will enable you to coordinate a total process, dis-
tributed among trading partners without adding processing time.
• Assess what starting or joining an online trading exchange means for your
supply chain operations. “If all it is doing is squeezing your suppliers on price
or gouging your customers, it’s probably not worth it in the long run,”
Lapide cautions. Trading exchanges are the most useful when they help con-
nect trading partners to share information and coordinate distributed busi-
ness processes. “If a trading exchange does not have a vision beyond buyers
getting the best price and availability for a commodity or indirect manufac-
turing items, it will not improve your supply chain much,” he declares.
• Do not connect just to your trading partners. To improve supply chain op-
erations, your internal enterprise systems need to be connected, enabling
trading partner system-to-system and human-to-human communication. 
Master the e-procurement conundrum.
E-procurement expert Bruce D. Tem-
kin, research director at Forrester Research, Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.; btemkin
@forrester.com) declares, “The Net will change procurement. However,
we don’t believe that the activities today are going to get you all the poten-
tial beneﬁts,” he told NAPM’s Leveraging Supply Chain Management and
e-Business conference
Temkin did offer some guides that purchasing professionals should re-
view when “evolving your e-procurement strategy.” The major points are
the following:
• Proactive net sourcing. Simply put, this is looking at new supplier quali-
ﬁcation agreements. “As you buy more and more online, make sure that your
supplier is able to handle this new online world,” he explains. “Create new
online standards.” Additionally, insist on metric-driven agreements. “Start to
measure suppliers responses, but also build that responsiveness into your
agreements,” is Temkin’s advice. Insist on rigorous content standards. “Insist
that all of your long descriptions are ﬁlled out,” he insists. “Insist that to buy
E-Purchasing/E-Supply Chain

from them, they need to clean up their item master. You as a buyer have to
make sure that happens.” Use multiple sourcing venues. “Learn how to use
the many new environments that are available, whether they’re auctions, re-
verse auctions, aggregation, and exchanges,” he guides. “You, the buying or-
ganization, need to know how to use all of these different methods.”
• Continuous supplier management. “Actively consolidate SKUs,” he rec-
ommends. “Understand what people are buying that’s similar so you can cut
down and get favorable pricing on it.” Create merchandise buying paths for
end-user buyers to make it easier for them to ﬁnd the right item, or preferred
supplier. Also, ﬂag the “specials” that may become available and that they
might need. Temkin also notes, “Maintain ongoing performance analysis,
because it’s not good enough to just set-up the supplier relationship, you also
have to manage it on an ongoing basis.”
• Hands-free procurement. These are processes that are designed for the
Internet, and not just procurement. They are managed by exception and op-
timized continuously. Essentially, with hands-free procurement the buyer is
only handling exceptions.
Words to the wise from the practitioners.
Alex Brown, director of corporate
supply management at Advanced Micro Devices (Sunnyvale, Calif.), who
led the transition to e-commerce in supply management, told the audience
at the NAPM meeting about the following lessons learned:
• Build consensus at senior management levels early. “Within six months of
the process we demonstrated the capability to the president of the company
and had his buy-in,” Brown shared. “But we still had to deal with product
line vice presidents and manufacturing executives, so we still had to get work
done at this level.”
• Implement change management with the strategy. “During the early days
we talked about the ‘leap strategy’ of moving the organization from purchas-
ing to procurement, and eventually to supply management,” he explained.
“We didn’t go through change management with some organizations, and
we got resistance to buy-in. We even had difﬁculty within procurement, es-
pecially from some of the senior people who looked at it as a threat, so they
resisted.”
• Divide project into achievable deliverables. “Anybody who has done a
project and project management recognizes the beneﬁt of having early suc-
994
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

cesses,” Brown explained. “Show progress and that you’re moving from one
level to another, especially to your senior support as you continue to ask for
funding and resources. Also, make sure to allocate your resources to the right
subprojects at the right moments.”
• Build consensus often. The key here is to maintain interaction with all
the organizations involved with the transition. Brown advises, “Communi-
cate plusses and deltas continuously; don’t surprise internal stakeholders and
customers.”
What American Honda Motor learned from implementing its e-procurement solution.
Nicolas M. Nomicos, corporate purchasing manager at American Honda
Motor Co., Inc. (Torrance, Calif.; nick_nomicos@ahm.honda.com), ob-
served, “We have always focused on high-dollar items as part of our pur-
chases. The issue we always had is that on the low dollar items we did not al-
ways utilize agreements, even though we had some, because we did not have
an easy way to pass the word around,” he explained at the NAPM meeting.
“That’s what e-procurement is giving us to a large measure.” American
Honda Motor is also using e-procurement to move senior buyers to do stra-
tegic contracting. “Out of a staff of 15, I now have 10 already in strategic
functions,” he reported. Additionally, he shared the lessons he learned from
their e-procurement installation:
• Control scope. “Prioritize your wishes,” he expressed. “Otherwise,
controlling the project scope is very difﬁcult as there’s so much you want to
put up front.”
• Partner selection. “We went through RFPs for partners, but what it
came down to was, at that time, there were not too many people with Ariba/
PeopleSoft implementation experience,” he explained. “So we just didn’t
look at the company, but we also closely looked at the individuals that were
to be on their team.” The process even involved scrutinizing the people’s re-
sumes. “In our negotiations, we insisted that our partner assign speciﬁc in-
dividuals to the team who had the experience we needed. Otherwise, they
will be learning the job, and it would be at our expense.”
• Training. “We started with a solution that needed no training on the
procurement piece, but did require some for the expense reporting solu-
tion,” he noted. “If we had to do it over again, we would insist on manda-
tory training, all around,” Nomicos declared.

The goal of supply chain management has always been to deliver on time
and defect-free, and the Internet holds the key to ﬁnally achieving it. That
is the consensus of senior supply chain management executives in Fortune
500 companies. In fact, 82% of those surveyed believe that Internet tech-
nology will have a major impact on—if not totally transform—their supply
chain performance within the next three years.
Is the supplier community up to the challenge?
Research from the Economist
Intelligence Unit (EIU) and Meritus Consulting Services reports that “al-
though high-quality performance throughout the supply chain is critical,
many companies are ill-prepared to integrate digital technology or reduce
their cycle time.”
The level of supplier performance expected by senior executives is “ex-
traordinarily high and uncompromising.” For example, 38% of respondents
always expect shipments to be delivered on time; 40% always expect ship-
ments as requested; and 44% always expect defect-free shipments. “Yet few
suppliers meet these expectations,” concludes the research report (Moving
The Supply Chain Into The Digital Age: Integrating Demand and Supply; www.
eiu.com/latest/meritus.asp).
Buying organizations must also accept the challenge.
The research also reveals
some remarkable ﬁndings about the current inadequacy of supply chain per-
formance and the lack of reliable management information: 
• Only 4% of the executives surveyed believe their customers are com-
pletely satisﬁed with their fulﬁllment performance.
• As many as 30% of the respondents were unable even to estimate their
supply chain performance. 
• Over half of the executives (53%) expect their suppliers to deliver as
requested 96% of the time, yet only 22% meet this standard with their own
customers. 
The supply chain’s evolution into a demand and supply chain.
The EIU/Meri-
tus research ﬁnds “it all starts with demand,” with customers “calling the
shots.” Therefore, it recommends that organizations develop more inte-
996
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

grated supply chain processes that are responsive to demand, with continu-
ously shortened lead times.
To that extent, senior executives must “ensure that each link or node
clearly understands and complies with the end-customers’ demand and de-
livery requirements.” Since no forecast is perfect, “accurate, near-real-time
information about the plan should be shared throughout the extended en-
terprise, with employees and business partners, to rapidly facilitate any nec-
essary remedial actions, “ the researchers advise.
Integration of process and technology is the key to success.
Great improvements
in purchasing and fulﬁllment can be achieved through the seamless integra-
tion of supply chain processes, from customer through to supplier. It is es-
sential that the chain act as a single entity to the customer. Senior executives
identiﬁed supply and demand planning as the most important process they
need to integrate into the supply chain. Within this category, well over two-
thirds of respondents believe that supplier/partner relationships, procure-
ment and sourcing, inventory management, delivery management, and cost
reduction strategies are most critical integration issues. Yet, the report notes,
none of the senior executives responsible for supply chain management were
completely satisﬁed with the level of integration in their organization or
with their suppliers or their customers.
Internet technology is the key to achieving integration.
Firms must go beyond
simply building Web sites and aim to create innovative solutions throughout
the extended enterprise-from fulﬁllment and procurement to knowledge
management and training. Survey respondents predict that Internet tech-
nology will become the second most important business process (right be-
hind supply and demand planning). This is a major leap from its current sta-
tus as one of the ﬁve least important processes. More than half of respondents
also classify process design as a future priority, which further emphasizes
need for Web-based utilities. 
Collaboration, outsourcing, and the need for better communication.
The tradition
of vertical integration is eroding. Instead, there has been a shift to focusing
on the most critical business processes and doing them exceeding well.
Therefore, companies and purchasing professionals are moving to develop a
collaborative approach, ensuring that many organizations contribute to serv-
ing their customers better. 
The research of EIU/Meritus indicates that many companies are
E-Purchasing/E-Supply Chain
997

emulating this approach. Senior supply chain executives view manufactur-
ing as the most important core competency, with sales and marketing a close
second. The order is, however, expected to reverse in three years.
As companies focus on core competencies, they have a need to outsource peripheral
business functions.
Respondents anticipate increased outsourcing of almost
all business processes and activities except for materials management, sales
and marketing, and research and development—all of which will continue
to be largely in-house activities. “Outsourcing, and indeed all supply chain
management, increases the need for fast and ﬂawless communication,” the
report insists. Respondents expect that the supply chain would increasingly
communicate electronically over the next three years.
Most signiﬁcantly, supply chain type information is expected to see the
greatest increase in digital communication. This includes inventory data, re-
quests for quotations, fund transfer, planning data, delivery tracking and sales
forecasting.
Almost all the companies in the survey recognize the potential for In-
ternet technology to provide a competitive edge in this area. “The technol-
ogy allows the customer’s initial demand to be automatically and seamlessly
communicated throughout the process, from product selection through or-
dering, scheduling, pricing, delivery, payment, and conﬁrmation,” they de-
scribe. “It can all be done as one transaction in near-real time, based on the
customer’s input, with little or no support from the manufacturer.” 
When asked what they consider the most effective means of real-time
communication now and in three years, the respondents clearly predict a
move away from EDI towards Internet communication, also including in-
tranets/extranets.

Anyone who’s been ignoring the e-purchasing revolution will get a jolt from
General Motors and Ford Motor Company, who simultaneously announced
impending massive Web-based supplier exchanges. Ford, in alliance with
Cisco Systems and Oracle is creating Auto-Xchange, an initiative to wire
more than 40,000 of its suppliers and dealers to the Internet.
Meanwhile, GM, in concert with Commerce One, is establishing
TradeXchange, an Internet site on which it will place its $87 billion annual

purchasing budget and have its 30,000 suppliers trade with each other. Both
projects are ambitious, and most suppliers continue to “evaluate” both sites,
as they well should. There is also conjecture that the transition to an Inter-
net-dependent supply chain could take time, more than the automakers are
anticipating.
Not ready for prime time.
We believe that e-purchasing is a deﬁnite “next”
concept to impact procurement organizations. Right now, however, it is pre-
mature to adopt the position of most academics, consultants, and e-purchasing
vendors that “if you haven’t incorporated the technology by now, you’re out
of business.”
A recent Supplier Selection and Management Report reader survey found
that almost three in ﬁve respondents (57.8%) do not have or use e-purchas-
ing. A recent Deloitte Consulting survey (Leveraging the e-Business Market-
place) of more than 200 global corporations also found that 60% of their re-
spondents are either planning, have under consideration, or do not plan to
implement e-purchasing at this time.
Purchasing professionals with whom we have talked hesitate to leap into
the electronic arena for various reasons. Prominent among them: overselling
of technology and its beneﬁts; caution about capabilities of providers; con-
cern over security and risk involved; and confusion about the “real” ﬁnan-
cial and infrastructure investments that must be made.
Plan now to reduce risk when transitioning to e-purchasing.
e-Purchasing is real,
and while the majority of purchasing professionals may not be implement-
ing this technology right now, they must begin planning for it immediately.
There are key questions to answer before selecting and implementing an
e-purchasing system. In fact, Russ Boyd, supply contracts manager at
Perot Systems Corporation (Plano, Texas; russ.boyd@ps.net), recommends
“deﬁning the minimum system and functional requirements of the e-
solution and incorporating those requirements into an RFP.” 
At a recent NAPM Annual International Purchasing Conference, he
provided some guidelines for types of requirements to consider (see sidebar).
He also advised that purchasing should form a cross-functional team to
gather required input from affected parties.
One plan of action to consider.
Timothy Van Mieghem, partner of the Pro-
Action Group (Chicago; 312-726-6111), acknowledges that “e-Com-
merce will not eliminate non-value-added purchasing tasks if it used as a

cally exchange information related to the sale of goods and services,” he ex-
plains.
• Understand what tasks the purchasing department completes. A traditional
purchasing organization will source the products they wish to buy, develop
an agreement with a supplier to purchase those products, plan and order the
products, select delivery methods, pay for the products, and monitor and
track the supplier. Understanding these steps allows the company to identify
those it wants to automate, he offers. “Each step will have components that
can be leveraged to the Web and ones that cannot,” he explains. Identifying
them is the ﬁrst step.
• Select the appropriate e-commerce package (or supplier that provides the soft-
ware). Many suppliers today offer e-commerce packages as a normal part of
their services, Van Mieghem advises. This is especially true for integrated
suppliers who want to make it easy as possible for a customer to order all
of their needs fast and with little effort. “Additional value can be added
by integrating the e-commerce package to other modules,” he explains.
“Some suppliers will even provide the resources to program the necessary
hooks.”
• Reengineer purchasing procedures to incorporate e-commerce, not vice versa.
“The tool will not be enough,” he declares. “The organization will need to
learn how to use the tool, and the procedures it will need to be updated.” In
addition, in order to take advantage of automated purchase order develop-
ment, the company will need to develop and program bills of material,
sourcing guides, routing guides, and internal controls.
• Review and test supplier base for e-commerce preparedness. “Like any new
procedure or approach, the least risky avenue normally includes selected
testing and monitoring,” Van Mieghem maintains. Through this step, tran-
sition suppliers to e-commerce processing one at a time.

• Closer supply chain collaboration, which improves “design for man-

• Supplier performance reports allow smarter buying decisions.
• Contract management support increases both the percentage of parts

Despite the talk of electronic exchanges, it is still the telephone, fax, paper,
and electronic data interchange (EDI) that dominate the media of informa-
tion and business documents exchange among companies. Nonetheless, lo-
gistics managers must not overlook the fact that transportation and logistics
exchanges are the wave of the future and offer some truly great beneﬁts.
Namely, they integrate the identiﬁcation of transportation and logistics ser-
vice providers, initiate service requests, and transmit replenishment orders to
suppliers and transportation providers. With such beneﬁts, here are six ways
to prepare your supply chain for online trading exchanges.
1. Companies Should Be Working on Readiness.
Internet-driven processes
force internal and external organizations to come together and resolve prob-
lems of trust, collaboration, standard practices, and taxonomy. All constit-
uencies need to focus on a readiness timeline for the potential integration of
trading exchanges into supply chain practices.
A variety of software vendors plan to offer supply chain collaboration
and integration tools and applications in the next few months. Some of these
vendors include Adexa, Inc., of Los Angeles, Ariba, Inc., of Mountain View,
Calif., Commerce One, Inc., in Walnut Creek, Calif., i2 Technologies, Inc.,
in Irving, Texas, IBM Corp. of Armonk, N.Y., J. D. Edwards & Co. of Den-
ver, Manugistics, Inc., in Rockville, Md., Oracle Corp. in Redwood Shores,
Calif., and webPLAN, Inc., in Kanata, Ontario. In addition to relying on
software to get your company ready for online exchanges, executive
E-Purchasing/E-Supply Chain
1003

commitment is needed. Senior management must view the Internet as a sup-
portive, integral, and supplemental means of doing business.
2. Companies Must Justify Exchanges.
Supply chain organizations need to
justify the use of online exchanges on the basis of the depth of services pro-
vided and the set of beneﬁts. The keys to enabling an e-supply chain will be
supply chain-wide visibility, integrated planning, speed of information, lo-
gistics, and transactional and customer service capability. 
To get the most from a trading exchange, make sure that it offers
• direct and indirect procurement
• dynamic sourcing
• collaborative demand planning and forecasting
• inventory visibility and management
• supply planning and optimization
• intelligent order promising and real-time order status
• collaborative logistics planning
3. Business Practices, Processes, and Supporting Technology Must Align.
Com-
panies will have to bridge or supplant information from their internal enter-
prise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management, e-business re-
lationship management, and legacy applications to one or many trading
exchanges (see sidebar), either via a Web browser or system-to-system com-
munication.
4. Established Relationships Remain a Priority.
Companies must determine
whether a private or public exchange will enhance relationships and brand
loyalty. If a trading exchange squeezes suppliers on price or compromises
services to customers, it is not worth it. Rather, private electronic services
that complement and add more value to established channel relationships
will prevent a better alternative.
If trading exchanges are not the sole or immediate answer to electronic
connectivity within your supply chain, consider establishing collaborative
processes with your trusted channel partners. 
5. Companies Need to Consider Building Electronic Portals.
Companies man-
aging their own complex global supply chains and those with smaller more

Recommendations for Using Logistics Exchanges
•
Do not ignore the implications of the Internet on the supply chain.
Devote quality management time in understanding and inﬂuencing your
company’s value proposition for the Internet and its implications to both cur-
rent and future supply chain practices.
Online trading exchanges can be positioned as an end-to-end supply
chain cost savings alternative. Evaluate long-term use of a trading exchange
based on its ability to impact supply chain best practices and provide quantiﬁ-
able supply chain beneﬁts.
•
Rigorously assess whether an exchange’s services impact the critical
supply chain competencies of plan, source, make and deliver. 
•
Online selling, fulﬁllment, procurement, and service present chal-
lenges. Don’t make the mistake of believing that electronically-driven supply
chain processes are an intergalactic concept.
•
Consider the use of electronic portals with supporting integration
tools as the conduit for information integration with an external community.
Get educated on standards and industry consortium practices for the elec-
tronic exchange of information.
•
Seek out customers, suppliers and trading partners that have adopted
the Web as a way of conducting business. Use this group as your benchmark
for learning.
Four Online Trading Exchanges
Supply chain organizations need to determine whether a trading ex-
change selected as part of their selling, procurement, logistics or dis-
tribution strategy remains viable into the future. And while AMR
Research, Inc. (Boston, 617-542-6600) has identiﬁed four types of
exchanges (see accompanying table, below), each should provide cer-
tain degrees of beneﬁt for the supply chain. At a minimum, these in-
clude
•
information visibility and integration
•
integration of sourcing with procurement
•
collaborative and synchronized forecasting, planning, and logistics
•
streamlined transaction costs

streamlined supply chains will be better able to take advantage of trading ex-
changes by establishing their own electronic portals as an entry and exit
point for electronic interactions.
Portals supplement communications with external business communi-
cations with styles that include personalization or ﬁltering information to an
individual user. Portals manage and personalize content such as catalogs,
parts listings, and planning information and they can also support automated
system-to-system communications and allow users to analyze data from
multiple sources.
Finally, they give the supply chain professional a tool to facilitate the
handling of alerts and exception messages. They can help coordinate logis-
tics and transportation execution. 
Vendors supplying products to build portals include Adexa, i2, Manu-
gistics, Xelus, Inc., of Fairpoint, N.Y., and webPLAN.
6. Smaller Companies Have the Most to Gain in Utilizing Trading Exchanges.
Beneﬁts accrue from the selling, buying, and customer responsiveness as-
pects of their businesses. By participating in a private or industry-focused
exchange, smaller companies gain the beneﬁts of reach and speed of trans-
action ﬂow. The added capability of auctioning services to sell or buy un-
committed inventory or even post excess available capacity is open to smaller
ﬁrms.

Companies looking to establish collaboration among supply chain partners
have found their solution on the Internet. Web-enabled tools and solutions
allow for the development of cost-efﬁcient and service-effective supply
chains. Here are some great examples of those solutions and how today’s
best-in-class organizations are using them to synchronize with partners in
the areas of product design, purchasing, inventory management, and com-
munications.
Internet Enhances Product Design
Many ﬁrms are using the Web to collaborate with trading partners on prod-
uct innovation. Shrinking product life cycles requires companies to form
partnerships to better customize product-to-customer demands in reduced
time-to-market periods.
A collaborative design process over the Internet allows ﬁrms to iterate
more design alternatives with suppliers: product upgrades can be achieved
more efﬁciently; products can be rolled out faster; and product complexities
are minimized, reducing supply chain inefﬁciencies and related logistics
costs.
Hewlett Packard is one of the early adapters of eDesign. On the design
and production of laser printers, internal and external design teams collabo-
rated to develop a supply chain-friendly product, with modular parts and
differentiating components that could be assembled at regional distribution
centers rather than multiple dedicated production facilities.
National Semiconductor uses product design portals to allow customers
and supply chain partners to collaborate in the early stages of design for a
new circuit. And Adaptec, a hardware and software developer, has reduced
design-to-delivery cycle times and saved $10 million in inventory by using
Web-based collaboration with key suppliers.
Web-Based CPFR
Collaboration online also strengthens customer relations. Sun Microsys-
tems has developed Web-based collaborative planning tools to exchange
forecast and product status information with customers on orders, ship-

ments and promotions, and help Sun manage its products through the en-
tire life cycle.
This has substantially reduced lead times and forecast availability, im-
proved inventory turns, increased customer satisfaction and more efﬁcient
supply chain operations.
Extranets Are Alternative to EDI
Many companies have used Internet technology to develop extranet systems
to electronically link users in various locations in a move toward collabora-
tion. These ﬁrms believe that an extranet yields the same beneﬁts as electronic
data interchange (EDI), but are easier to build and cheaper to maintain.
General Electric, for example, has halved its 14-day purchasing cycle by
communicating with suppliers over an extranet, according to a survey of
world-class companies conducted by Best Practices, LLC (Chapel Hill,
N.C.; 919-403-0251).
And Lord Corp. introduced its own system, New Generation Data In-
terchange, to combat some of the difﬁculties with EDI. Here, PC-to-PC
modems allow the company to interface with suppliers, allowing vendors to
monitor their orders and performance measures.
Extranets can also help manage customers’ inventory and eliminate pro-
duction and billing inefﬁciencies. Shell Chemical is deploying Lotus Notes
as the backbone to a customer inventory management system and considers
the system an improvement over traditional EDI. The system change re-
sulted from increasing confusion in the company’s production planning
group and difﬁculties in reconciling bills on last-minute shipments. Shell de-
cided to emulate the relationship it had with its water supplier: One com-
pany supplied the need, the water was there on demand, and Shell made pay-
ments through an electronic billing system once a month.
With Lotus Notes, Shell could manage its customers’ inventory and
place orders for the customers rather than waiting for the customers to real-
ize they were in short supply. Shell now bills the companies monthly for ac-
tual consumption instead of on a per shipment basis.
A server in the customer’s purchasing department replicates any changes
to Shell’s internal server and makes them available to Shell account repre-
sentatives. The system also calculates and issues an electronic bill to cus-
tomers on a monthly basis.
Shell estimates that the new process has increased revenue by encourag-
1008
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

ing many of its customers to make Shell their sole supplier. The additional
revenue has exceeded implementation costs by a ratio of 10-to-1.
Improve Purchasing with Intranets
Intranet links are also being developed to support corporate and manufac-
turing purchasing programs. Ford’s intranet program, called Direct Data
Link, allows suppliers to get exact ordering and scheduling information for
parts by accessing Ford’s mainframe.
Ford factory workers, in turn, choose the right colors and conﬁgurations
as a car or truck moves down the assembly line. The cost for this low-tech
communication system is a $40 modem and a 386 computer.
Another online procurement option is the e-marketplace. Buying and
selling product via Internet exchanges allow companies to lower procure-
ment transaction costs, lower product acquisition costs, tap into unlimited
supply sources to respond to changing market needs, and proﬁtably dispose
of unused excess inventory.
Matching Virtual to Physical
Leading organizations are also collaborating with supply chain partners to
fulﬁll online orders. While the fulﬁllment process is done in the real world,
online synchronization is crucial to ensuring that orders are taken and ﬁlled
on time.
“The advent of the e-economy is pressuring the fulﬁllment operations
of many companies, whether they are shipping small packages to individual
consumers or operating tightly synchronized business-to-business trans-
portation,” says David L. Anderson, a partner in Accenture’s (formerly An-
derson Consulting) Supply Chain Practice (917-452-3536). “Companies
will look for innovative ways to continue to reduce order-to-delivery
times.”
Accenture recently launched a Web site (www.ascet.com) that investi-
gates the Internet’s impact on the supply chain. A book, Achieving Supply
Chain Excellence through Technology, Volume 2, accompanies the Web site.
No matter how you utilize the Internet, the pros recommend that you
realize that true collaboration is only possible with the right partners; that
data sharing requires trust and openness; and that low-cost supply chain op-
erations remain critical.

Traditional opinion holds that companies closely aligned with their trading
partners will have the best control of their supply chains. Internet connec-
tivity is making this a foregone conclusion by using e-business technology
to connect to partners in real time. We believe that the following companies
have successfully mastered virtual manufacturing and distribution businesses.
Here is how they have done it.
Link to All SCM Partners
Cisco Systems, a supplier of Internet switching, routing and networking
equipment maintains an Internet system that links its suppliers, customers,
manufacturers and processes via the Web. Orders are shipped directly to a
customer’s location, enabling a partial virtual distribution process.
Additionally, in a move to virtually eliminate all its warehouses over ﬁve
years, Cisco has partnered with Federal Express Corp. to hand over all ship-
ping and warehousing functions. Fulﬁllment will be accomplished by ship-
ping order lines directly from plants and suppliers, possibly up to 100 order
lines from different countries. Order lines will be consolidated and merged
in transit to allow them to arrive within hours of each other for assembly at
a customer’s site. This replaces the method that requires Cisco to carry ﬁn-
ished goods inventories in plant warehouses to ensure coordinated delivery.
Moving to Build-to-Order
Ingram Micro, a wholesale distributor of technology products and services
is a virtual build-to-order manufacturer of PCs (see sidebar). The company
has worked to shrink order cycle times by replacing traditional communica-
tion methods, such as telephone and fax, with EDI and Internet-based mes-
saging.
Under the new system, orders placed on a reseller’s Web site are elec-
tronically sent to Ingram’s systems, which then automatically send order in-
formation to the factory and to logistics providers who hold and ship sup-
pliers’ inventories. The factory receives the inventories, assembles the PCs
and ships them directly to the reseller or its customer.
Dell has also been successful in moving to a build-to-order manufactur-
ing model while holding no inventory. To enable this environment, Inter-
1010
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

net orders are sent every two hours to warehouses for ﬁnal assembly or for
component delivery to a plant within two hours.
Around-the-Clock Customer Care
Marshall Industries, an industrial electronic components wholesale distribu-
tor, has established a Web site to enable around-the-clock customer self-
service. The site is linked to its internal systems to provide customers with
unallocated inventory status, order history information, and design support.
It is also linked to transportation carriers for order tracking. This streamlined

Four E-Supply Chain Business Models
Electronic connectivity that is Internet based will allow manufacturers to out-
source and reassemble their supply chains, enabling real-time coordination of
fulﬁllment and processes among trading partners. This will spur the adoption
of one of four new e-supply chain business models deﬁned by AMR Re-
search, Inc. of Boston (617-542-6600).
1. Virtual Manufacturer—This organization does not manufacture any-
thing; nor does it have any plants. It does, however, control product develop-
ment, marketing, and sales, as well as coordinate customer service for its prod-
ucts. It hires contract manufacturers and third-party logistics and fulﬁllment
service providers to make, assemble, and ship ﬁnal products to its customers.
Sun Microelectronics, a division of Sun Microsystems, Inc., in Palo Alto,
Calif., is such an organization, as it outsources the manufacture of electronic
boards, which are shipped by suppliers directly to customers.
2. Virtual Distributor—This company does not distribute anything and
does not have any warehouses. It markets products and takes orders for mul-
tiple suppliers. The virtual distributor controls marketing and sales and coor-
dinates order fulﬁllment. It relies on suppliers to make, assemble, and ship ﬁ-
nal products directly to its customers. Ingram-Micro represents this type of
organization.
3. Virtual Retailer—Better known as an Internet retailer, this ﬁrm does
not own any brick-and-mortar stores. It merchandises products in virtual
stores and controls order fulﬁllment and products directly to its customers.
Amazon.com, Inc., is the best example of this type of retailer.
4. Virtual Service Provider—This organization does not own any assets,
but does provide SCM services. This includes Lead Logistics Providers that
perform logistics management for a company.

operation, eliminating handwritten sales reports, paper-based catalogs, and
telephone calls. It has also improved customer service.
Speed Up the Supply Chain
HP Printers and PC Division has accelerated fulﬁllment on the outbound
side by requiring all customer orders to come in via EDI or to be converted
to EDI format by automatic loading into HP’s ERP system.
During the order fulﬁllment cycle, customers and transportation carri-
ers are connected via EDI links to speed up delivery and automatically up-
date systems with order information. The organization only works with car-
riers that have Internet-based shipment tracking systems to ensure that
customers can view shipment status electronically. A secure Web site allows
customers to obtain order status information.
Purchase E-Business Functionality
Seizing the opportunity to help these eSCIs (e-Supply Chain Innovators),
software vendors have started to offer products that can help. This deluge of
new product offers has come from SCM, ERP and Internet procurement
software vendors. Those most aggressively developing such functionality
include i2 Technologies Inc. (Irving, Texas), Manugistics, Inc. (Rockville,
Md.), Oracle Corp. (Redwood Shores, Calif.), Aspect Development, Inc.
(Mountain View, Calif.), Ariba Technologies, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.),
and Commerce One, Inc. (Walnut Creek, Calif.).
While each vendor approaches the market differently, they are develop-
ing software technology that can be deployed in three ways:
• As licensed software to enable a company to establish its own ex-
change with its trading partners
• As part of a hosted site for use by a company and its partners, run by
a third-party provider
• As a service within a public trading exchange, for use by a company
and its trading partners
Each method helps establish real-time electronic connectivity with
trading partners to coordinate and collaborate on supply chain activities.

For logisticians looking to electronically synchronize with suppliers over the
Internet, a set of specialty startup vendors can help. These Order Visibility
Exchange (OVE; see sidebar) vendors specialize in Supply Chain Event
Management (SCEM), which includes an end-to-end approach to supply
chain management. Companies using OVEs get more control over the re-
plenishment of direct production goods, potentially reducing inventories
and cycle times. OVE functionality can also help expand the numbers of
suppliers to which you are electronically connected and is a means to mi-
grate your current EDI connections to the Internet.
Linking Procurement Electronically
Bloomﬁeld, Connecticut–based Kaman Aerospace, a manufacturer of heli-
copters, is using an OVE solution from Eventra (Milford, CT; 203-882-
9988) to manage its planning, forecasting, and collaborative supplier com-
munications.
“Our company had no electronic linkage to manage the supply chain,”
E-Purchasing/E-Supply Chain
1013
Look Who Offers Visibility
A number of software companies can provide OVE functionality, but only
four privately held startups specialize in the area:
Eventra (Milford, Conn.; 203-882-9988) focuses exclusively on order
management functionality with an additional logistics focus. Its product, Ven-
dorSite, supports freight, logistics, and barcode data.
Sendorder.com (Mountain View, Calif.; 650-316-3991) targets smaller
companies that cannot afford a license.
Efﬁnity (Alisa Viejo, Calif.; 949-643-9700) offers functionality beyond
OVE to include collaborative forecasting. The second version of its product
has just been released.
Baker Street Technologies (Toronto, Ontario; www.bakerstreettech.
com) offers OVE functionality through a Web site–hosted service only. Baker
Street provides functionality to track orders sourced to multiple suppliers.

says Jack Bergquist, vice president of contracts management and procure-
ment. “All transactions were completed via phone, fax, or mail. With the
Eventra VendorSuite, we look forward to greater efﬁciency and cost savings
by having our direct materials suppliers linked electronically.”
In order to convert Kaman to VendorSite, Eventra had to interface with
the company’s legacy system. Eventra just ﬁnished Kaman’s VendorSite pilot
stage with 15 test suppliers and will increase to 40 suppliers by the end of the
year. Vendors range from small businesses to manufacturers that supply hun-
dreds of parts.
Visibility around the World
Network Appliance is using the new WorldChain solution to manage order-
ing, shipping, and delivering spare parts and inventory to customers around
the world. “Network Appliance began to search for a way to leverage the In-
ternet to link together our trading partners in customer service and support,”
explains Chris Liotta, senior vice president of Customer Satisfaction at Net-
work Appliance, Inc. “We required a solution that provides real-time visibil-
ity for our customers to our outsourced partners’ data and processes, could
be rapidly implemented, and integrated transparently with existing IT in-
frastructures. The WorldChain [Santa Clara, Calif.; 408-245-2400] solution
speeds time to market, enabling us to improve upon our Service Level
Agreement performance and meet or exceed our customers’ expectations.”
WorldChain’s hosted solution will be integrated with the Network Ap-
pliance Web site where the company, its customers, and its service partners
can securely view, verify, and control all critical information relating to the
movement of inventory through the supply chain. Network Appliance can
eliminate manual procedures in its service and support operations and auto-
mate supply chain processes to enhance customer satisfaction globally.
Four Types of Order Management
Whether your trading partners are located worldwide or domestic, OVEs
provides you with the following:
1. Data Translation Services—Allow trading partners to send to, and
receive information from, an exchange in a variety of protocols, including
EDI, XML, Internet, pager, fax, and e-mail, as well as simple browser soft-
ware. This lets trading partners communicate with the site.
1014
S U P P LY  C H A I N  M A N A G E M E N T

2. Transaction Management—Keeps track of the real-time status of
purchase orders, order releases, acknowledgements, advance shipment no-
tices, load tenders, and back-order notiﬁcations in a secure environment.
3. Notiﬁcation and Alert Messaging—Lets trading partners know
when the status of an order changes or when something goes awry, allowing
exception-based order management.
4. Analytics—Enables users to generate performance reports from or-
der history.

Logistics managers are well aware that electronic commerce has and will
continue to make a signiﬁcant impact on their organizations and supply
chains. To help you take better advantage of all that technology has to offer
your logistics operations, here is a quick update on the tools and vendors at
your disposal.
LIS Speeds Things Up
Logistics Information Systems (LIS) are useful in carrying out EC initiatives.
LIS can quickly and accurately concentrate, group, and process the needed
logistics information involved in transportation, loading and unloading, cus-
tom clearance, storage, inventory control and distribution processing. Due
to customers’ growing demand for diverse products, smaller quantities and
increased frequency, the LIS is inevitable and necessary.
One of the primary beneﬁts of LIS is its ability to integrate Internet Lo-
gistics Management practices (ILM). ILM is deﬁned as coordinating and
centrally managing logistics activities to reduce total cost, improve customer
service, and alleviate interdepartmental conﬂict. Research presented at the
Council of Logistics Management annual conference indicated that 61.4%
of logistics managers are using LIS for this purpose (see Figure III-5.2).
Extranets Prove to Be Cost-Effective
When suppliers and customers are added to the mix, managers are less likely
to invest in technology. A comparison of resellers to manufacturers here
E-Purchasing/E-Supply Chain

TEAMFLY
Team-Fly® 

shows that while resellers are more interested than manufacturers in devel-
oping extranet capabilities to manage supply chain activities, neither group
has rushed to implement them (see Table III-5.3). 
Brian Gibson, associate professor of logistics at Auburn University
(Auburn, AL; 334-844-2460) and Craig R. Gustin, principal, CGR Man-
agement Consultants (Atlanta; 404-633-8058), who conducted the research
study, found that the beneﬁts of EC may be the cost savings and efﬁciencies
garnered from supply chain improvements. While sales increases generate
publicity, taking cost out of a supply chain has a more direct impact on bot-
tom line proﬁtability.

“Both manufacturers and resellers need to be more proactive in lever-
aging the cost-effective capabilities of extranets,” states Gibson.
A Lucrative Market for Providers
Aiding managers in this leverage are supply chain management service pro-
viders. According to International Data Corp. (Framingham, Mass.; 508-
988-6757), current market conditions are causing logistics managers to seek
out ﬁrms that provide supply chain consulting, implementation, operations
management, training support, and supply chain services (see Table III-5.4). 
“The increasing complexity and variety of the available software solu-
tions, the demands of the new e-business paradigm, and the need for ever-
shortening implementation time frames are just some of the factors causing
companies to seek the help of supply chain management service vendors in
strategizing, planning, enhancing, integrating, and managing their supply
chains,” says Nelly Zaharinov, senior research analyst with International
Data Corp.’s Supply Chain Services research program. 
“In the past, supply chain management projects were undertaken by
companies that wanted to differentiate themselves in the marketplace and
achieve operational excellence,” continues Zaharinov. “Today, however,
these projects are becoming a necessity for many of the big, middle-market,
and dot-com organizations due to their growing need for collaboration and
integration.”

Growth in the e-tail market has turned retail logistics processes upside down.
To be prepared, managers need to concentrate their efforts on four logistics

areas (see sidebar): order management, fulﬁllment, shipping, and reverse lo-
gistics.
It’s All in the Software
Robert L. Olsen, CPIM, project manager, Tompkins Associates (Raleigh,
N.C.; 919-876-3667), recommends software as the easiest and most effec-
tive tool to manage these four areas. Here is how to go about it.
1. Ordering over the Net. Companies should evaluate order management
systems by their capability to receive and process orders from the Internet
without the need to manually enter or review every order. The ability to in-
terface directly from the enterprise database to the Internet software is critical.
Also consider how freight and other charges will be processed by the or-
der management system. And, look for a system that can calculate sales tax
for all states.
2. Fulﬁlling “Each” Orders. Consider the distribution operation that has
traditionally served the retail market. The operation has most likely dealt

How Do You Know if E-Tailing Is Right for Your Firm?
The e-tailing group (www.e-tail.com) suggests that you ask yourself the right
questions in order to determine if your company has the logistical ability to
sell its products over the Internet.
•
Is your company Web-enabled?
•
Will your product sell online?
•
Are you currently missing an opportunity to reach your customers
online?
•
Are you facing the likelihood of competitors within your product cat-
egory?
•
Can you improve business productivity through Web transactions?
•
Will your cost structures likely be impacted by e-commerce?
•
Are you concerned about your market cap without an Internet pres-
ence?
•
Can the Internet deliver your company a global presence likely to in-
crease overall revenues and market share?

with full case or pallet movements with order volume reaching 100 orders a
day. If an item is in short supply, the distribution center might ship short. The
delivery system is most likely common carrier, with delivery times of four to
seven days.
Under the e-tail business model, the fulﬁllment requirement becomes
an “each.” The total number of items shipped does not change, but the or-
der volume does, from 100 to several thousand a day. Shipping, manifesting,
and labeling requirements are now imposed on the supply chain.
The makeup of the warehouse will need to change drastically to support
consumer-direct marketing, most importantly, the ability to pick large quan-
tities of small orders. At a minimum, ﬂow racking is imperative. Pick-to-
light automation, carousels, and A-frame or V-frame picking systems may
be required to handle the extra volume.
Realize that parts of orders may be picked manually while others are
handled by automation. Scheduling them and bringing the information and
inventory together calls for systems and capabilities that many current sys-
tems cannot handle.
3. Develop a Multicarrier Strategy. Shipping is one of the more interesting
aspects of e-tail. At the current rate of growth, the industry’s impediment is
the inability of parcel carriers to accommodate the growing volume of pack-
age shipments to residential addresses. 
The requirement for the emerging e-tail organization is to develop a
multicarrier strategy and have a single integrated parcel management system
in place that can accommodate all the carriers. 
Be aware that parcel carriers are moving to strict labeling requirements
to expedite handling and in some cases, new bar code symbols are required
that call for new software and printers on your part.
An added element is the need to interface the shipping system to the en-
terprise or warehouse management system. Shipping at larger volumes re-
quires the shipping system to retrieve data from the order ﬁle. Scanning the
order number bar code on the pick ticket or label should sufﬁce to initiate
the shipping process.
4. Handling the Returns. The rate of return in e-tail is much higher, oc-
curs everyday, and will come in one item at a time. Accommodating this calls
for physical and system preparations.
Physically, the operation must have an efﬁcient space for receiving and
processing the returns. This will include opening, inspecting, disposing or
repackaging and crediting the customer with the return. Repackaged items

must be placed back in stock as quickly as possible, and you might need vis-
ibility of the inventory before actually reshelving, in order to prevent over-
purchasing the material.
The system requirements for this process involve the warehouse opera-
tions to direct and manage the movements. Interfaces must also be supported
to the enterprise system for accounting, inventory and sales update informa-
tion.
