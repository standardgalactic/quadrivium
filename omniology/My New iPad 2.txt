Acknowledgments
The most important person responsible for nurturing this book from a wild idea 
into an honest-to-goodness product is Bill Pollock, the founder and publisher of 
No Starch Press, who took a chance years ago to publish the types of books he 
wanted to see and to allow authors free reign to take risks and see what might 
­happen next. 
Some other people who were crucial to getting this book completed were 
Tyler Ortman, Kim Wimpsett, Ansel Staton, and Riley Hoffman. They looked over 
this manuscript and designed the pages to make sure that everything I wrote actu-
ally made sense and looks easy to read as well.
Two other people who deserve thanks include Bill Gladstone and Margot 
Hutchison from Waterside Productions. Without their help for so many years, I 
might never have gotten the chance to write so many books on a variety of com-
puter topics over the past two decades.
I also want to acknowledge all the stand-up comedians I’ve met, who have 
made those horrible crowds at comedy clubs more bearable: Darrell Joyce (http://
www.darrelljoyce.com/), Leo “the Man, the Myth, the Legend” Fontaine, Chris 
­Clobber, Bob Zany (http://www.bobzany.com/), Russ Rivas (http://www.russrivas 
.com/), Doug James, Don Learned, Dante, and Dobie “The Uranus King” Maxwell. 
Another round of thanks goes to Steve Schirripa (who appeared in HBO’s hit show 
The Sopranos) for giving me my break in performing at the Riviera Hotel and Casino 
in Las Vegas.
Additional thanks goes to Moe Abdou (http://www.learnfrommylife.com/) 
for opening my eyes on a variety of topics all the time, Jon Fisher (http://jonbfisher 
.blogspot.com/) for showing me how an entrepreneur should work (with his book 
Strategic Entrepreneurism), Dane Henderson for getting me involved in various 
radio shows all the time, and Joe Polish (http://www.joepolish.com/) for sharing 
crazy ideas that prove how creativity and imagination can be far more important 
than any formal education.
Final thanks go to my wife (Cassandra), my son (Jordan), and my cat (Nuit) for 
being part of my life and always wondering how anyone can make a living by just 
sitting in front of a computer all day long.

There’s an old story about blind men examin-
ing an elephant. Based on what they feel, each 
man concludes that the elephant is something 
completely different—one man believes the 
elephant is a tree, another man a snake, the 
third a wall. When you first share your iPad with 
your family and friends, you might find them 
disagreeing in much the same way.
The iPad offers so many features that 
one person may focus on its ebook reading 
­features, another may focus on its video and 
music play­ing capabilities, someone else might 
be interested in browsing the Internet, and still 
another might focus on the ability to type and 
edit text to create slide show presentations, 
spreadsheets, or business reports.

Introduction
To help you learn the multiple features of the iPad, this book will gently guide 
you through the basics of using your iPad for personal and business use. With an 
iPad, you actually have a miniature computer for both viewing and creating con-
tent, and this book will show you how to make your iPad work best for you.
If you already use an iPhone or an iPod Touch, you already know how to use 
most of the iPad’s features. If you use any type of smartphone that offers touch 
screen gestures, you’ll find many of the iPad’s touch screen gestures familiar as 
well. Even if you’ve never used any type of touch screen device before, you’ll find 
that the iPad can be friendly, forgiving, and fun. 
Think of the iPad as a multipurpose, portable computer that you can take 
wherever you go and use whenever you need it. The iPad isn’t just a replacement 
for an existing computer, but a versatile device that offers an infinite number of 
possible uses, limited only by your imagination. 
How This Book Is Organized
To help you get started using your iPad right away, this book is divided into short 
chapters that act like recipes in a cookbook. Each chapter explains how to accom-
plish a specific task and then lists all the steps you need to follow. 
By following the book’s hands-on instructions for accomplishing common 
tasks, you can learn how to achieve specific results using your iPad right away. Best 
of all, you don’t have to read this book in any specific order. Just bounce around 
and follow the chapters that catch your interest while ignoring the chapters that 
you don’t care about. 
Although the iPad comes packed with plenty of features, don’t feel you need 
to learn everything at once. Just learn the features that you need right now and 
have fun right away. By following the chapters in this book, you’ll learn how to use 
your iPad and make it a useful and indispensable tool that you can rely on wher-
ever you go.

Part 1
Basic Training


1
Your iPad can be in one of three states: on, off, 
or sleep. If you have the 3G model that can con-
nect to a cellular phone network, you can also 
put your iPad in airplane mode. By learning the 
advantages of each state, you’ll know when and 
why to use them.
When your iPad is on, you can use it. When 
your iPad is in sleep mode, you’ll conserve its 
battery power while keeping it ready to start up 
right away. Sleep mode is best when you are not 
using your iPad but plan to return to it soon.
Airplane mode turns off your iPad’s ability 
to access email or surf the Web through a 3G 
cellular phone network. This essentially cuts off 
your iPad from the rest of the world while ­letting 
you do most other tasks, such as play music, read 
books, check your calendar, or browse your list 
of contacts. As its name suggests, airplane mode

is perfect for when you’re in an airplane and can’t risk having your iPad interfere 
with the airplane’s navigation systems. 
If you know you won’t need to use your iPad for a lengthy period of time, you 
might as well turn it off to keep it from running down its battery. 
In this chapter you’ll learn how to turn on your iPad, put it to sleep, put it in 
airplane mode, and shut it off completely. 
What You’ll Be Using
To turn an iPad on and off, you need to use the following:
>
>
The Sleep/Wake button
The Settings screen
Turning On Your iPad
When your iPad is off, you can turn it on by following these steps:
1.	
Hold down the Sleep/Wake button at the top of your iPad, as shown in Fig-
ure 1-1, until the Apple logo appears on the screen. 
Q
Q Note: If you see a blank screen after pressing the Sleep/Wake button, your 
iPad may not have enough power to start. 
2.	
Wait a few seconds until the Home screen appears. This tells you that your 
iPad is now on.

Turning Off Your iPad 
The main difference between turning your iPad off and putting it to sleep is that 
turning the iPad off conserves its battery power. The drawback is that if you turn 
the iPad off, it takes a few seconds longer to start up again when you need it.
When your iPad is on, you can turn it off by following these steps:
1.	
Hold down the Sleep/Wake button until a red “slide to power off” arrow 
button appears at the top of the screen. 
2.	
Slide the red arrow button to the right (or tap Cancel if you don’t want to 
turn off your iPad after all).
Putting Your iPad to Sleep
After you’ve turned on your iPad, you can change it from on to sleep mode to con-
serve battery power while still being able to quickly access your iPad the moment 
you need to use it again (rather than wait for it to boot up).
At a glance, you cannot tell whether an iPad is turned off or in sleep mode. If 
you press the Home button and your iPad turns on, then you’ll know it was asleep. 
If you press the Home button and nothing happens, then you’ll know that it’s 
turned off. You’ll have to hold down the Sleep/Wake button to start it.
To put an iPad to sleep that is already turned on, press the Sleep/Wake but-
ton. The screen darkens.
Q
Q NOTE: If you have a Smart Cover, just use it to cover your iPad’s screen to put 
the iPad to sleep.
Putting Your iPad to Sleep Automatically
Since sleep mode is critical in conserving your iPad’s battery, you may be happy 
to know that if you leave an iPad on, it will put itself into sleep mode after a fixed 
period of time. To change this fixed period of time, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 1-2.
3.	
Tap Auto-Lock. The Auto-Lock settings screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 1-3.
4.	
Tap one of the available options: 2 Minutes, 5 Minutes, 10 Minutes, 15 Min-
utes, or Never.
5.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.

Waking Up Your iPad from Sleep Mode
When you put an iPad to sleep, you must wake it up to change its state from sleep 
mode to on. To wake up an iPad in sleep mode, do this:
1.	
Press the Sleep/Wake button on top of the iPad, press the Home but-
ton, or, if you have a Smart Cover, lift an edge away from the screen. A slider 
appears on the screen.
2.	
Drag the slider to the right. The Home screen appears.
The slider forces you to slide your finger to unlock your iPad. That way, your 
iPad won’t accidentally turn on if you press its Sleep/Wake button in your briefcase 
or purse.
Q
Q Note: If you fail to use the slider to unlock your iPad after a few seconds, 
your iPad will automatically return to sleep mode.
Turning Airplane Mode On and Off  
(3G iPad Models Only)
On many airlines, you are not allowed to access a cellular phone network to avoid 
possible interference with the plane’s navigational systems. To comply with this 
rule but still use your iPad for other tasks, such as jotting down notes or watching 
videos, you can put your iPad in airplane mode by following these steps:
1.	
Make sure your iPad is turned on. 
2.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Set-
tings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Airplane Mode. The button will show ON, 
and an airplane icon will appear in the upper-left 
corner of the screen, as shown in Figure 1-4.
To turn off airplane mode, just go into Settings 
again and tap the Airplane Mode switch a second 
time. It should now read OFF.

Additional Ideas for Turning Your iPad On 
and Off
As a general rule, turn off your iPad whenever you know you won’t be using it for a 
while. If you plan on using your iPad soon, then put it in sleep mode. 
Airplane mode is most useful when you’re stuck in an airplane and don’t 
feel like interacting with any of your fellow passengers, preferring to let your iPad 
amuse you instead. It’s also a good way to save your battery life. 
Now that you understand the basics of turning your iPad on and off (and 
everything in between), the rest of this book will teach you how to use all the other 
features of your iPad so you can do something useful with it. 

2
Your iPad should last approximately 10 hours on 
a single charge. Of course, playing videos will 
likely drain the battery faster than just reading 
an ebook, so your actual battery life may differ 
depending on what you do. There are ways you 
can minimize power usage, thereby extending 
the daily life of your battery. 
Like all batteries, your iPad’s battery will 
eventually wear out, but by then you’ll prob-
ably have a newer iPad model anyway (or you 
can take your iPad to an Apple store and pay a 
minimal fee for an entirely new iPad). 
In this chapter you’ll learn how to maximize 
the charge of your battery to allow your iPad to 
run as long as possible.

Chapter 2
What You’ll Be Using
To maximize your iPad’s battery life, you need to use the following:
>
>
The iPad USB cable
The Settings screen
>
>
The iPad USB power adapter
Recharging an iPad
There are two ways to recharge your iPad. If you want to use your iPad while it’s 
recharging, plug its USB cable and adapter into an electric outlet. This is also the 
fastest way to recharge your iPad.
You can also plug your iPad into a computer’s USB outlet to recharge it. 
Some computers with high-powered USB outlets will let you use your iPad as it 
charges. But if you plug the iPad into your computer and try to use it, you may see 
a “Not Charging” notice near the battery indicator. This indicates that your com-
puter’s USB outlet is not high-powered, and that you cannot use the iPad as it is 
charging. (If you put your iPad to sleep while it’s plugged in, it will slowly recharge.)
Q
Q Note: To ensure a full battery, plug your iPad into a wall outlet overnight. 
That way, the iPad will be fully charged the next morning.
Q
Q Warning: Hot weather (95°F, or 35°C) can irreversibly harm your iPad’s bat-
tery, so avoid storing your iPad in direct sunlight. If your iPad feels excessively 
warm while it’s recharging inside a carrying case, take it out of its case before 
recharging. Cold weather will only temporarily prevent your iPad’s battery 
from holding a charge. Once you move your iPad to a warmer area, its battery 
will hold its charge normally.
Turning Off Push Accounts
One handy feature of the iPad is the push account. If you have a supported email 
account, your email server can deliver new messages to your iPad automatically so 
you receive the information almost the instant someone sends it to you.
Since a push account requires that your iPad periodically contact your email 
account over the Internet, it uses energy. If you don’t need or care to receive email 
messages as quickly as possible, you can turn off the push account by following 
these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars. The Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings 
screen appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
3.	
Tap Fetch New Data. The Fetch New Data settings screen appears, as 
shown in Figure 2-2.
4.	
Tap the Push on/off switch to make it read OFF.

5.	
Tap an option under the Fetch category, such as Every 15 Minutes or Hourly.
6.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
Turning Off Location Services
Location Services is a fancy term that means some iPad apps, such as the Maps 
app, rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and triangulation of cellular phone 
towers to identify the physical location of your iPad. If it knows your physical loca-
tion in the world, an iPad app can then help you find the nearest restaurant or gas 
station, for example.
Unfortunately, Location Services burns up battery energy. If you don’t need 
this type of service, you can turn it off to reduce power consumption by following 
these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Location Services. The Location Services settings screen appears on 
the right side of the screen, as shown in Figure 2-3.
4.	
Tap the Location Services on/off switch so it reads OFF. As an alternative, 
you can selectively tap the on/off switch of the different apps stored on your 
iPad. That way you can turn off Location Services for certain apps but keep it 
turned on for other apps.
5.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.

Monitoring Battery Life
To let you know how much battery life is left, your iPad displays a battery gauge 
in the upper-right corner of the screen. The more filled this battery gauge appears, 
the more charge your battery has remaining.
Since this small visual gauge may be hard to read, your iPad can also display 
the battery charge remaining as a percentage. A fully charged battery appears 
as 100% charged, while a weaker battery charge will have a lower percentage. 
When your battery life reaches 20% and 10%, warning messages alert you to 
recharge your iPad soon.
In case you find this battery percentage indicator annoying, you can turn it 
off (or on) by following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Usage. The Usage settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 2-4.
4.	
Tap the Battery Percentage on/off switch. When set to ON, the battery 
percentage indicator appears next to the battery gauge. When set to OFF, 
the percentage indicator does not appear.
5.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
Figure 2-4: The Battery Percentage on/off switch appears on the 
Usage settings screen.

Turning Off Bluetooth
Bluetooth is primarily used to connect an iPad wirelessly to a headset or keyboard. 
If you don’t use Bluetooth devices such as an external keyboard, turning off Blue-
tooth can save power and increase your iPad’s battery life. To turn off Bluetooth, 
follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Bluetooth. The Bluetooth settings screen appears.
4.	
Tap the Bluetooth on/off switch to change it to read OFF.
5.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
Additional Ideas for Conserving Power
The most important way to conserve battery power for your iPad is to put it to 
sleep (or to turn it off completely) when you’re not using it. The iPad’s brightness 
setting is the second-most important factor in preserving its battery (though there’s 
no sense in preserving the battery but straining your eyes looking at a dim screen). 
You can adjust the brightness in the Brightness & Wallpaper pane of the Settings 
screen.
	
Although the iPad’s battery can last approximately 10 hours, you may want 
to invest in a battery pack. Although these external battery packs may be cumber-
some to lug around, you can use them in emergencies when you need to use your 
iPad but find that its power has drained away. 
Rather than rely on a battery pack, you could also buy a solar panel that can 
recharge your iPad as long as you can place the solar panel in the sun. You can also 
buy a car charger that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter to provide power to 
your iPad while you’re driving around. If you combine conservation techniques with 
additional power sources, there’s no reason why you should ever run out of power 
for your iPad.

The iPad represents a minimalist design, so you 
won’t see ugly ports or extra buttons protruding 
from every side like a typical laptop or netbook. 
Instead, the iPad offers only four physical but-
tons: Sleep/Wake, Silent/Screen Rotation Lock, 
Volume Up/Down, and the Home button. By 
learning how to use these buttons, you can 
control how your iPad behaves.
Besides these physical controls, the iPad 
also provides virtual controls for locking the 
screen orientation or adjusting the sound. By 
learning to use the iPad’s physical and virtual 
controls, you can control the major features of 
your iPad.

Viewing the Home Screen
The Home button appears at the bottom of the iPad on the front, as shown in 
Figure 3-1. No matter what app you may be using at the time, pressing the Home 
button immediately displays the Home screen, which displays icons that represent 
all the apps you can run on your iPad. (Try it now!)
Adjusting the Volume
To make it easy for you to increase or decrease the volume, the iPad includes Volume 
Up and Volume Down buttons on its right side (shown earlier in Figure 3-1).
You can adjust the volume by pressing one of the volume buttons or by hold-
ing it down. When you adjust the volume, the iPad displays a ringer icon with a 
horizontal bar underneath that visually displays the current volume level, as shown 
in Figure 3-2.

Q
Q Note: Many apps, such as the iPod or YouTube app, also let you adjust the 
volume with a volume slider that appears on the screen. By moving this vol-
ume slider left or right, you can lower or raise the volume without touching 
the physical Volume Up/Down buttons on the side of the iPad.
Another way to adjust the volume is through the volume slider on the screen, 
which you can display and adjust by following these steps:
1.	
Press the Home button twice. A list of icons, representing different apps, 
appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.
2.	
Swipe this list of icons to the right. You may need to do this several times 
until you see the Volume Control slider, as shown in Figure 3-4.
3.	
Slide the Volume Control slider left or right.
4.	
Press the Home button when you’re done.

Chapter 3
Multitasking with the Home Button
The iPad can run two or more apps simultaneously and switch between them at 
the touch of the Home button.
To switch between multiple apps,  follow these steps:
1.	
Press the Home button twice. A list of icons, representing different apps, 
appears (shown earlier in Figure 3-3.)
2.	
Tap the icon of the app you want to switch to using.
Q
Q NOTE: If you want to remove an app from this list, you can press and hold 
your fingertip over an icon until all the icons wriggle. You’ll see a small red 
minus sign on the apps—tap it to remove an app.
Configuring the Silent/Screen Rotation 
Lock Switch
The Silent/Screen Rotation Lock switch appears on the side of the iPad. If you play 
audio often and need to quickly mute the sound in a hurry, you’ll want to configure 
this switch to silence the audio. If you don’t want your iPad to adjust the screen 
rotation automatically, such as when you’re holding the iPad while laying down, 
then you may prefer to configure this switch to lock the screen rotation instead.
To configure the Silent/Screen Rotation Lock switch, follow these steps:
1.	
Tap the Settings icon. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appear. 
3.	
Tap either Lock Rotation or Mute, as shown in Figure 3-5.
4.	
Press the Home button once.
5.	
Test it out by flicking the switch. An icon appears to let you know you were 
successful. Your iPad is now muted or locked.

Muting the Volume or Locking the Screen 
Rotation Without the Side Switch
You can also mute your iPad or lock its screen using the Home button. If you’ve 
configured your side switch to mute the iPad, you can still quickly lock the screen 
using these steps (and vice versa):
1.	
Press the Home button twice. A list of icons appears (see Figure 3-3).
2.	
Swipe this row of icons to the right until you see the Mute or Screen Rotation  
Lock icon, as shown in Figure 3-6.
3.	
Tap the Mute or Screen Rotation Lock icon to mute the volume or lock or 
unlock the screen rotation. The icon that appears will depend on whether 
you configured the side switch to Mute or Lock Rotation.

Adjusting the Screen Brightness
Since you can take your iPad anywhere you go, you’ll probably use it in differ-
ent lighting conditions, such as out in the bright sunlight or in a dark room while 
­someone else is giving a boring presentation. In case you need to adjust the 
screen brightness, you can drag a brightness slider to make your iPad’s screen 
easier to see.
To adjust screen brightness, follow these steps:
1.	
Tap the Home button twice. A row of icons appears at the bottom of the 
screen.
2.	
Swipe the icons at the bottom to the right until the controls appear (shown 
earlier in Figure 3-4). 
3.	
Drag the Screen Brightness slider to the left or right.
4.	
Press the Home button once.
Additional Ideas for Controlling Your iPad
The two most commonly used buttons are the Sleep/Wake button and the Home 
button. Since you’ll be using the Home button often, take the time to practice 
returning to the Home screen by pressing the Home button once. If you press the 
Home button twice in rapid succession, you can lock the screen rotation, adjust 
the volume, or switch to another app.
Locking the screen rotation can be handy if you like curling up in a chair or 
sofa with your iPad. Without locking your screen, the image might flip back and 
forth between portrait and landscape mode.
Switching between apps can be handy when you don’t want to end an app 
but want it to retain its current state, such as letting you play a game while tempo-
rarily checking your email. 
Finally, don’t forget that the Volume Up/Down buttons can help you crank up 
your music or lower it so you don’t disturb others. Physically adjusting the volume 
through the Volume button is easy, but you can also adjust the volume by pressing 
the Home button twice and then swiping your app icons to the right to view the 
volume control slider. 
If you really need to quiet your iPad down in a hurry, just configure the 
side switch to Mute and then use the physical Silent/Screen Rotation Lock switch 
instead.
By acquainting yourself to the purpose of these physical and virtual controls, 
you can quickly control your iPad. Once you know how to control your iPad with 
these physical and virtual buttons, the next step is to start learning how to control 
it using the more common touch gestures on the screen.

If you’re already familiar with using an iPhone or 
iPod touch, you practically already know how to 
use the iPad’s user interface. However, if you’re 
new to any Apple products that use a Multi-
Touch interface, you’ll still find that the iPad is 
easy to learn.
The Multi-Touch screen is how you’ll interact 
with your iPad. By tapping, pinching, or sliding 
your finger across the screen, you can select 
items, manipulate objects, or scroll across the 
screen. Nearly every app uses one or more 
touch gestures, so it’s important to learn how 
to use them all. 
In this chapter you’ll learn how to control 
your iPad using touch gestures on the Multi-
Touch screen. 
Controlling 
the iPad User 
Interface

22	
|	
Chapter 4
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to control your iPad’s user interface, you need to use the following:
The Safari app
The Maps app
Using the Multi-Touch Screen
The Multi-Touch screen functions as both a display and a user interface that you 
can control with your fingertip. These are the three main touch commands:
>
>
Select (tap)
>
>
Scroll (drag)
>
>
Zoom (pinch or double-tap)
Q
Q Note: The Multi-Touch screen lets you tilt the iPad vertically (portrait mode) 
or horizontally (landscape mode) to make it easy to view data. No matter 
how you tilt your iPad, the Tap, Drag, Pinch, and Double-Tap touch commands 
work the same.
Using the Select Command
The simplest command is Select, which lets you touch an item that you want to 
select. To use the Select command, point at an icon or button, press it lightly, 
and then lift your finger off the screen. When done correctly, the Select command 
involves nothing more than a quick tap on the screen. This Select command is 
called tapping throughout the rest of this book.
Q
Q Note: The Multi-Touch screen works only when it detects your fingertip 
touching the screen. If you tap the screen with your fingernail or while wear-
ing gloves, the Multi-Touch screen won’t recognize this physical contact.
To see how the Select command works, follow these steps: 
1.	
Press the Home button. The Home screen appears, showing all the apps 
available on your iPad.
2.	
Tap any icon, such as the Calendar. Your chosen app appears on the screen.
3.	
Press the Home button. Notice that your iPad displays the Home screen 
once more.

	
Controlling the iPad User Interface

Using the Scroll Command
Sometimes an app might need to display more information than can comfortably 
fit on the screen. When this happens, you can view multiple screens by choosing 
between two different scrolling commands: Controlled Scroll and Quick Scroll.
Controlled Scroll lets you scroll horizontally or vertically by sliding or drag-
ging your finger across the screen. To practice the Controlled Scroll and Quick 
Scroll commands, try the following to acquaint you with the App Store, where you 
can buy and download new apps for your iPad:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap App Store. 
2.	
Tap the Featured icon at the bottom of the screen. The App Store appears, 
as shown in Figure 4-1.
3.	
Near the bottom of the screen, slide your finger up and down the screen. 
Notice that the screen scrolls up and down as your finger slides up and down 
the screen. As soon as you lift your finger off the screen, it stops scrolling. 
This is a Controlled Scroll.
4.	
Near the bottom (or top) of the screen, slide your finger up or down quickly, 
and lift your finger off the screen in a quick flicking motion. Even after you lift 
your finger off the screen, the screen should continue scrolling in the direc-
tion you flicked your finger. This is a Quick Scroll.
Figure 4-1: The App Store 

24

Chapter 4
5.	
Repeat the previous step, except before the screen can stop scrolling, tap 
your finger on the screen. This immediately stops the scrolling and is known 
as a Quick Scroll Stop. 
6.	
Press the Home button. The Home screen appears. 
Since the iPad’s screen can’t display multiple, overlapping windows like an 
ordinary computer screen, apps often display multiple windows as individual, side-
by-side panes. One pane is always visible, but other panes are tucked out of sight 
to the left or right of the screen.
To let you know that a screen consists of multiple panes, two or more dots 
are displayed at the bottom of the screen—each dot represents a screen (see Fig-
ure 4-2). A bright dot represents the current screen, while dimmed dots represent 
hidden screens. To view these additional screens, you need to slide the current 
screen left or right with your finger.
The Home screen actually consists of multiple panes (up to a maximum of 11 
panes). To practice scrolling horizontally to view other panes, follow these steps to 
get acquainted with the Home screen:
1.	
From the Home screen, slide your finger to the right across the screen. The 
Search screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-3.
2.	
Slide your finger to the left across the Search screen. The Home screen pane 
appears again.

Q Note: When you start downloading apps, they’ll appear on additional Home 
screen panes, which you can access by pressing the Home button and then 
sliding your finger to the left to view each additional pane.
Using the Zoom Command
The iPad’s screen can display entire web pages. Of course, the images and text 
may appear too small to read comfortably, so the iPad gives you the option to 
zoom in and zoom out. To enlarge or shrink an image, you can use two fingers in 
a pinching motion. Touch the screen with your fingers spread out and bring them 
closer together to cause the iPad image to shrink. If you start with your fingers 
together and slide them apart, the iPad image enlarges. This gesture resembles 
a pinching motion with two fingers.

Q
Q Note: Not all apps allow you to zoom in and out. If you find yourself wanting 
to zoom in closer on the Home screen or within apps that don’t allow it, you 
can enable the accessibility feature called Zoom. Read Chapter 27 for instruc-
tions on how to enable it.
Additional Ideas for Controlling Your iPad
Touch gestures represent the primary way to control your iPad, so be sure to prac-
tice using the tap, scroll, and pinch gestures until they become second nature. By 
knowing these three commands, you’ll be able to get the most out of your iPad no 
matter which app you may be using at the time. 
In a few apps, such as the Photos app, you can use a fourth touch gesture 
known as the rotate command, which lets you rotate an image on the screen. Just 
place two spread fingers on the screen, and then rotate your two fingers in either 
a clockwise or counterclockwise direction to rotate the image currently displayed 
on the screen.
Try these common touch gestures on different apps, both the built-in ones 
that come with your iPad and any additional ones you may have downloaded from 
the App Store. You’ll quickly see how you can control almost any app with your 
fingers alone. Some applications also use the iPad’s orientation as a control, and 
nearly all apps will change depending on how you hold your iPad: in portrait or 
landscape mode.

One of the most unique features of the iPad is 
its virtual keyboard, which displays a keyboard 
on the screen and lets you type directly on the 
surface of the iPad. While typing on a flat piece 
of glass might initially feel odd, you’ll soon find 
that you’ll adjust and be able to use the virtual 
keyboard nearly as well (or perhaps even bet-
ter) than using a physical keyboard that can get 
clogged with crumbs, dust, and spilled liquids. 
To make the virtual keyboard easier to use, 
you can customize its behavior. After a little 
practice, you’ll soon find yourself capable of 
typing happily away on the iPad whether you 
need to type a note to yourself, an email mes-
sage, or a website address.
In this chapter you’ll learn how to customize 
and use the virtual keyboard on your iPad.

Chapter 5
What You’ll Be Using
To customize the virtual keyboard, you need to use the following:
The Notes app
The Settings screen
Displaying Different Virtual Keyboards
Because of the limited screen size available on the iPad, the virtual keyboard 
behaves differently than a physical keyboard. A physical keyboard displays every 
key, including letter and number keys in addition to cursor movement keys and 
function keys. Although this makes all the keys available, it also tends to clutter the 
keyboard with groups of keys you might rarely use, such as the function keys or the 
numeric keys.
The iPad’s virtual keyboard works differently by displaying only the groups 
of keys you’re most likely to use. The three main types of virtual keyboards display 
letters, numbers, and symbols.
To see what these three virtual keyboards look like, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Tap anywhere on the right side of the screen that looks like a yellow notepad. 
The virtual keyboard displaying letters appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.

Q NOTE: To save yourself a few extra taps when typing a single piece of punc-
tuation, you can just press and hold the .?123 key and then release it once 
you’ve found the right character. Your keyboard will automatically swap back 
to the ABC keyboard.
4.	
Tap either of the #+= keys. The virtual keyboard changes to display symbols, 
as shown in Figure 5-3.
5.	
Tap either of the 123 keys. The numeric virtual keyboard reappears (shown 
earlier in Figure 5-2).
6.	
Tap either of the ABC keys. The main virtual keyboard with letters reappears 
(shown earlier in Figure 5-1).
7.	
Tap the Hide Keyboard key in the bottom-right corner of the screen. The 
virtual keyboard disappears completely. 
8.	
Tap anywhere on the right side of the screen on the yellow notepad image. 
The virtual keyboard appears.

Chapter 5
Typing on a Virtual Keyboard
Typing on the virtual keyboard is nearly identical to typing on a physical keyboard. 
The main difference is that the virtual keyboard does not offer any arrow keys. 
(You have to touch the screen to move the cursor.) In addition, if you type part of 
a word, the virtual keyboard may display the correct and complete spelling of that 
word, which you can choose by pressing the spacebar. 
Typing Text
To create text, you can type it yourself or let the virtual keyboard suggest and 
automatically type any words that you’ve partially typed. To see how typing on the 
virtual keyboard works, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Tap anywhere on the right side of the screen that looks like a yellow notepad. 
The virtual keyboard displaying letters appears (shown earlier in Figure 5-1). 
3.	
Start typing Appl. Notice that when the virtual keyboard thinks it recog-
nizes what you’re typing, it displays Apple as a suggested word, as shown in 
Figure 5-4.
4.	
Tap the spacebar to let the virtual keyboard finish typing the suggested word 
automatically. (If you don’t want to choose the suggested word, keep typing 
or tap the X in a circle that appears to the right of the suggested word.) 
5.	
Type more text. Try misspelling a word by typing Testung—the iPad will 
automatically correct your spelling to Testing. To make your new text appear 
on another line, tap the Return key.
6.	
Tap the Shift key, then try pressing a letter. Notice it’s now uppercase. Tap 
the Shift key again, and press the button labeled !/,—you have inserted the ! 
character.
Moving the Cursor
With a physical keyboard, you can move the cursor by pressing the arrow keys or 
by pressing any of the other cursor movement keys such as Home or End. With the 
virtual keyboard, there are no cursor movement keys since you must directly place 
and move the cursor by touching the iPad’s screen. 
Figure 5-4: The virtual keyboard tries to guess 
the word you want before you finish typing.

You can move the cursor in two ways: tapping your fingertip to move the cur-
sor before or after a word or touching and sliding your fingertip to move the cursor 
within text. Holding your finger on the screen displays a magnifying glass that lets 
you see the exact position of the cursor so you can slide your finger to move the 
cursor where you want it to appear.
To see how to move the cursor, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Type a few sentences of text.
3.	
Tap anywhere in your text. Notice that the cursor appears wherever you tap. 
(However, the cursor will not appear in blank areas where there is no text.)
4.	
Hold your finger on any part of the text that you’ve typed. A magnifying 
glass appears, letting you see the current position of the cursor, as shown in 
Figure 5-5.
Q
Q Note: If you’re having trouble getting the magnifying glass to appear, make 
sure you do not slide your finger up or down.
5.	
Slide your finger to move the cursor. Notice how this method lets you move 
the cursor accurately.
6.	
Lift your finger when you’re happy with the current location of the cursor. A 
Select, Select All, and Paste menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
7.	
Press the Home button.

Selecting, Copying, and Cutting Text
Just like with a regular computer, you can select text to copy, cut, and paste it 
in another location. When selecting text, you have three choices: select a single 
word, select all of your text, or just select part of your text.
After you select text, you can delete it by tapping the Backspace key, or you 
can cut or copy the selected text to paste it somewhere else.
Selecting a Single Word
You can select a single word in two ways. First, you can tap a word twice to select 
it. Second, you can hold your finger on a word for a moment and then release. 
When a menu appears, tap Select. To try selecting a single word, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Type a sentence of text.
3.	
Tap a word twice. Your chosen word appears highlighted, as shown in Figure 5-7, 
along with a Cut, Copy, Paste, and Replace menu. At this point, you can tap 
Cut or Copy to cut or copy your selected text.
4.	
Press your fingertip over another word, and lift your finger off the screen. 
Notice that a Paste menu now appears.
5.	
Tap Select. (If you tap Select All, you’ll select all the text.) Your chosen word 
appears selected, and a Cut, Copy, Paste, Replace menu appears. At this 
point, you can tap Cut or Copy to cut or copy your selected text.
Selecting Part of Your Text
Normally the virtual keyboard only selects entire words. However, you may want to 
select just part of a word, which you can do by following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Type a sentence of text.
3.	
Tap any word twice. Your chosen word appears highlighted along with begin-
ning and ending markers; each marker appears as a vertical line with a circle 
on the top or bottom of the line.
4.	
Hold your finger on one of the vertical lines, and slide your finger to select 
more or less text, as shown in Figure 5-8.
5.	
Lift your finger when you’ve selected all the text you want. At this point you 
can tap Cut or Copy to cut or copy your selected text.

magnifying glass appears to let you see where the cursor appears.
6.	
Lift your finger off the screen. A Select, Select All, and Paste menu appears.
7.	
Tap Paste. Your previously cut or copied text appears at the cursor’s location. 
Note that you can even copy and paste to and from different applications. 
For example, you might copy the recipe from a web page in Safari into an 
email message to your aunt in Mail.
Q
Q Note: You can shake your iPad to Undo a Cut, Paste, or even a bit of typing—
just be careful not to drop it!
Spellchecking
The iPad’s virtual keyboard offers a limited form of spellchecking that flags possibly 
misspelled words with a red underline. You must first tap a possibly misspelled 
word, and then the virtual keyboard displays a list of possible correct spellings.
To see how to spellcheck text, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Type Greeetings. (Make sure you deliberately misspell the word by typing 
three es.) The misspelled word appears with a dotted line underneath to 
identify it as a possible misspelling, as shown in Figure 5-9.
3.	
Tap the word. A menu appears, listing possible correct spellings, as shown in 
Figure 5-10.
4.	
Tap the correct spelling, and your iPad replaces your word.

Q
Q Note: If you tap a word twice to select it, a Cut, Copy, Paste, and Replace 
menu appears. If you tap Replace, you can select a list of alternate words to 
replace your currently selected word.
Customizing the Virtual Keyboard
To make the virtual keyboard easier to use, you may want to customize its behavior. 
Five features you can customize include auto-correction, auto-capitalization, spell-
checking, caps lock, and a neat shortcut to insert periods (“.”) automatically. 
Auto-correction means the virtual keyboard tries to guess which word you 
want to type after you’ve typed only part of that word—the iPad will also attempt 
to autocorrect misspellings as you type. Auto-capitalization means that the first 
letter of every sentence automatically gets capitalized. Spellchecking automati-
cally highlights potentially misspelled words. Caps lock lets you tap the Shift key 
twice to turn on caps lock so you can type capital letters without tapping the Shift 
key each time. The shortcut for inserting a period automatically is to simply press the 
spacebar twice. All of these features are on by default—if you find them annoying, 
just turn them off. 
To customize the virtual keyboard, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears. 
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Keyboard. The Keyboard settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 5-11.

Q
Q Note: Additionally, your iPad can speak any corrections it makes to your 
typing aloud. You can enable this feature by tapping Settings, General, 
Accessibility and then tapping the Speak Auto-text on/off switch.
Turning Off Audible Keyboard Clicks
Typing with the virtual keyboard doesn’t give you any physical feedback when 
you’ve pressed a key. To overcome this problem, you can turn auditory feedback 
on or off so your iPad makes a slight clicking sound to let you know when you’ve 
pressed a key. By default, this auditory clicking is turned on, but if it annoys you, 
you can turn it off.
To turn on (or turn off) these auditory keyboard clicks, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears. 
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Sounds. The Sounds settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 5-12.

Chapter 5
Typing Foreign Characters
If you regularly need to type characters in foreign languages that display accent 
characters above or below the letter, or type the symbol for euro dollars or yen 
instead of American dollars, the virtual keyboard offers a unique press-and-hold 
feature. Just press your finger over a key and hold it there. After a few seconds, a 
menu of different characters appears, allowing you to slide your finger over the 
character you want to type.
To see how to type foreign characters, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Tap on the Notes screen to make the virtual keyboard appear. 
3.	
Press your finger over the E key and hold it until a menu of different characters 
appears.
4.	
Press and hold your finger over the A, I, O, U and C keys to see the character 
choices for those letters. 
5.	
Tap the .?123 key to switch to the numeric keyboard.
6.	
Press and hold your finger over the $ and ? keys to see the choices for those 
characters.

Additional Ideas for Using the  
Virtual Keyboard
Getting familiar with the virtual keyboard may take time, especially if you’re used to 
using physical keyboards. If you’re a hunt-and-peck typist, you may find the iPad’s 
keyboard perfectly suited to your typing style. 
The key to using the virtual keyboard is to practice in order to get over your 
initial unfamiliarity. To make typing more comfortable and natural, consider buying 
an optional case, which can prop the iPad up at an angle. 
If you prefer a physical keyboard even after practicing with the virtual one, 
you can wirelessly connect any Bluetooth-enabled keyboard to your iPad. If you 
buy the optional camera connection kit, you can plug an adapter into your iPad 
that provides a USB port. Then you can plug an ordinary USB keyboard into this 
port and type on this keyboard.

The Home screen displays icons that repre-
sent all the apps available on your iPad. Since 
you’ll be staring at the Home screen all the time, 
you may want to customize its appearance by 
re­arranging icons on the screen, moving them 
off (or on) to additional panes, or just deleting 
certain apps altogether.
In addition, the Home screen lets you choose 
a background image as your wallpaper. You can 
choose one of the photographs that Apple pro-
vides or use any of your own pictures that you’ve 
loaded on your iPad. You can put a picture of 
your kids making silly faces on your iPad or use a 
picture of your dog or cat. The choice is yours.

What You’ll Be Using
To customize your iPad’s Home screen, you need to use the following:
>
>
The Home button
The Settings screen
>
>
The iPad’s USB cable
iTunes on your computer
Rearranging Icons on the Home Screen
You might find yourself using the Calendar and iPod apps every day but rarely 
using the Contacts or Notes apps. To make it easy to access the Calendar and 
iPod apps, you might want to put these icons in the corner of the screen and bury 
seldom-used app icons in another pane that’s hidden out of sight. There are two 
ways to rearrange your Home screen: directly on the iPad or through iTunes on 
your computer.
Rearranging Icons on the iPad
The fastest way to rearrange icons on your Home screen is to manipulate and 
move those icons directly on your iPad. To rearrange icons on the Home screen, 
follow these steps:
1.	
Press the Home button. The Home screen appears. (Skip this step if the 
Home screen is already visible.)
2.	
Press and hold your finger on the icon that you want to move to a new 
­location until all the icons on the Home screen start wriggling, as shown 
in Figure 6-1.
3.	
Drag the icon to where you want to move it. When you move an icon in 
between two other icons, those two icons glide out of the way. You can now 
drag any app to a new location.
Figure 6-1: Pressing and holding your finger on an icon will make all 
the Home screen icons wriggle.

Q
Q Note: Remember, the Home screen actually consists of multiple panes. To 
move an icon off one pane and onto another one, slide your finger to the left 
or right of the screen until the other pane appears.
4.	
(Optional) Tap the close button of any app icon that you want to remove 
from your iPad. It’s the little X in the upper left.
5.	
Press the Home button to stop all the Home screen icons from wriggling.
Rearranging Icons Through iTunes
If you have a lot of apps stored on your iPad or want to move app icons from one 
pane to another, it’s much faster to do it through iTunes instead. Not only can you 
use your mouse (or laptop trackpad) to move icons across multiple panes faster than 
you could do this on your iPad, but you can also see thumbnail images of each Home 
screen pane, which makes it easier to see the arrangement of all your app icons at 
once. To rearrange icons on the Home screen through iTunes, follow these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPad to your computer through the USB cable.
2.	
Run iTunes on your Mac or PC.
3.	
Click the name of your iPad under the Devices category in the iTunes window.
4.	
Click the Apps tab and make sure a check mark appears in the Sync Apps 
check box. The right side of the screen displays your Home screen panes, as 
shown in Figure 6-2.
5.	
Drag any app icons to a new location using the mouse.
Figure 6-2: iTunes displays your Home screen.
First, select your 
iPad in Devices.
Then select a 
category of apps.
Uncheck any apps 
you don’t want.
Drag apps to 
rearrange them.

Chapter 6
6.	
(Optional) Using the mouse, point to any app icon that you want to delete. 
A close button appears in the upper-left corner of that app. Click this close 
button to remove the app from your iPad.
7.	
Click Apply. Wait until iTunes finishes syncing your iPad before disconnect-
ing it from the USB cable.
Rearranging Icons into Folders
One problem with storing too many apps on your iPad is that your screen can soon 
look cluttered with so many app icons all over the place. To fix this problem, you 
can organize multiple apps into folders. To create a folder, follow these steps:
1.	
Press your finger over any app icon that you want to store in a folder. All the 
app icons start wriggling.
2.	
Drag the app icon toward a second app icon that you want to store in the 
same folder. A dark border appears around this second app icon.
3.	
Drag the app icon over this app icon with the dark border around it. After 
you lift your finger from the screen, the contents of your folder appear on the 
screen, allowing you to drop your currently selected icon into the folder, as 
shown in Figure 6-3.
4.	
Press the Home button. 
5.	
(Optional) If you want to change the name of your folder later, just tap and 
hold an icon until they wiggle. Tap the folder you wish to rename, tap the 
title, and use the virtual keyboard to type a new folder name. Press the 
Home button when you’re done typing.
Taking Icons out of a Folder
After you have created a folder that contains two or more app icons, you can always 
take an app icon out of a folder and place it back on the desktop. To remove an 
icon from a folder, follow these steps:
1.	
Tap the folder icon that you want to modify. The contents of the folder 
appear underneath the folder icon (see Figure 6-3).
2.	
Press your finger over the app icon that you want to move out of the folder. 
The app icons start wriggling.
3.	
Drag the icon out of the folder and on to the desktop. 
4.	
Press the Home button to stop all your app icons from wriggling.

Putting Apps on the Dock
At the bottom of the screen, your iPad initially displays four app icons (Safari, Mail, 
Photos, and iPod). This area acts like the Dock in Mac OS. It displays its apps at all 
times, even if you switch to a different Home screen pane. If you find yourself using 
certain apps all the time, you may want to place those apps on this Dock area so 
they will always be available. You can put up to six applications on the Dock.
Adding App Icons to the Dock
To add an app icon to the Dock, follow these steps:
1.	
At the Home screen, touch and hold the app icon that you want to move to 
the Dock. All your app icons start wriggling. You can release your finger.
2.	
Drag the app icon to the Dock and then lift your finger off the screen. Your 
app now appears on the Dock.
3.	
Press the Home button to stop all your app icons from wriggling.
Q
Q Note: You can also put folders on the Dock.
Taking App Icons off the Dock
If you find that you don’t use certain apps on the Dock very often, you can always 
move them off the Dock by following these steps:
1.	
At the Home screen, touch the app icon that you want to move off the Dock 
until all your app icons start wriggling.
2.	
Drag the app icon off the Dock, move the app icon anywhere on the screen, 
and then lift your finger off the screen.
3.	
Press the Home button to stop all your app icons from wriggling.
Modifying the Wallpaper
The wallpaper image appears behind all your app icons so you have something 
interesting to look at rather than just a blank screen. To customize the appear-
ance of your wallpaper, you can adjust the brightness or just choose a new image 
altogether.
Adjusting the Wallpaper Brightness
The wallpaper on your iPad is meant to provide an interesting image to look at, but 
if it seems too light or too dark, you can always modify this brightness by following 
these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.

Additional Ideas for Customizing Your 
Home Screen
You’ll spend most of your time looking at your Home screen, so you might as well 
customize it so you’ll enjoy looking at it. Group together your most commonly 
used apps on the Home screen, and set your favorite image as your wallpaper. 
Chapter 10 shows you how to find, buy, and install new apps. Chapter 12 explains 
how to add your favorite websites to your Home screen.
Since you can choose your own wallpaper images, put pictures of animals, 
landscapes, artwork, or people on your iPad. If you’re comfortable with creating 
graphic images and transferring them to your iPad, turn your daily or weekly to-do 
list into a graphic image and then make it your wallpaper. Every time you turn on 
your iPad, you’ll see your tasks and goals. By putting your own images on your iPad, 
you can truly customize its appearance so nobody will ever mistake your iPad for 
their own.

Doesn’t it seem that children gravitate toward 
the most expensive and valuable items we own, 
just so they can play with them, break them, or 
lose them? Although you do need to protect 
your iPad from excessive handling from over-
eager children, you also need to protect your 
children from your iPad—or at least the adult-
oriented content they could access on it.
Since banning your children from touching 
your iPad is probably not a practical solution, 
you can turn on parental controls to limit what 
a child can see on your iPad.
Making an iPad child-friendly involves 
restricting access to certain features, including 
playing videos with explicit content, browsing 
the Internet, watching YouTube videos, playing 
iTunes, and installing new iPad applications.

Chapter 7
What You’ll Be Using
To restrict access to certain iPad features, you need to use the following:
The Settings screen
Blocking iPad Features
To restrict access to certain iPad features, you use a four-digit passcode. The only 
way someone (including you) can access these blocked features is by typing the 
correct four-digit passcode.
Q
Q Note: The four-digit passcode needed to modify parental controls can (and 
should) be completely different from the four-digit passcode used to access 
your iPad, as explained in Chapter 8.
Some of the features that you can block include:
>
>
Accessing the Internet with the Safari web browser
>
>
Watching YouTube videos
>
>
Listening to music through iTunes
>
>
Installing and deleting iPad apps 
>
>
Defining your iPad’s location
>
>
Changing email accounts
>
>
Making in-app purchases
>
>
Playing multiplayer games in Game Center
>
>
Adding friends to Game Center 
Q
Q Note: Your iPad can block only those video and audio files tagged as Explicit 
that you bought through iTunes. If you load an R-rated movie or adult-content 
audio file onto your iPad that you received from another source, your iPad 
may not recognize the file as explicit.
By blocking access to different parts of your iPad, you can prevent your kids 
(or anyone else) from peeking at adult-oriented content, goofing off when they 
should be doing something more productive, or running up charges by installing 
apps or burning up time connecting to the Internet through your iPad’s cellular 
telephone network plan.
Finally, you may want to turn off Location Services, which can prevent your 
iPad from identifying its current location. Turning Location Services on can be 
handy for using the Maps app, but it can also pinpoint the location of your child 
(carrying your iPad) as well, which you may not feel comfortable allowing.

Q
Q Note: When you turn a feature off, such as YouTube or Safari, the icon for 
that feature disappears from the Home screen.
Filtering Content
Another way the parental controls feature can protect your children is by letting 
you choose what type of content (music, podcasts, movies, TV shows, and apps) 
you’ll allow on your iPad. For example, you may not want your children to view any 
movies rated R or higher or listen to any music or podcasts rated Explicit. The fol-
lowing are some of the content you can filter:
>
>
In-App Purchases  Blocks or allows installed apps to purchase additional 
content, such as a magazine app that charges a fee for new content.
>
>
Ratings For  Defines which nation’s ratings system to use, such as United 
States or Germany.
>
>
Music & Podcasts  Blocks or allows music or podcasts labeled Explicit.
>
>
Movies  Blocks all movies or just those above a certain rating such as R 
or NC-17.
>
>
TV Shows  Blocks or allows TV shows depending on their ratings such as 
TV-14 or TV-MA.
>
>
Apps  Blocks or allows apps depending on their ratings such as 9+ or 17+.

Additional Ideas for Using Restrictions on 
Your iPad
The main reason to restrict access to different iPad features is to keep your kids 
from certain content. However, you may also want to restrict your own access to 
certain features to avoid the temptation to waste time.
For example, suppose you’re addicted to the Internet and keep paying 
way too much for Internet access through your cellular network provider. Simply 
restrict access to Safari and/or YouTube and remove the temptation from your 
home screen.
To make this even more effective, have someone else type in a passcode 
to restrict your access to certain features. Now you won’t be tempted to turn off 
these features since even you won’t have the proper four-digit passcode. (Just 
make sure that you trust the person restricting your access to your own iPad, or 
else you may never gain access to those features without completely resetting 
your iPad.)

Right now, anyone can pick up your iPad, turn 
it on, and see all the information stored on it, 
such as your email messages, appointments, 
or important contacts (names and phone num-
bers). To help keep your iPad’s information 
private, you can turn on the passcode feature.
The passcode feature, which is different from 
the parental controls discussed in Chapter 7, lets 
you set a four-digit code that someone must 
enter before they can use your iPad. If someone 
tries guessing your pass­code, you can even have 
your iPad automatically erase its data after 10 
failed passcode attempts. By turning on this 
passcode feature, you can protect your data 
from spies and nosy relatives.
In this chapter you’ll learn how to define a 
passcode to limit access to your iPad and keep 
others from identifying the location of your iPad.

Chapter 8
What You’ll Be Using
To protect your privacy, you need to use the following:
The Settings screen
Setting (or Removing) a Passcode
Initially, your iPad does not require a passcode to start using it. Just press the 
Home button or the On/Off button, slide your finger across the screen to unlock 
the Home screen, and you (or anyone else who gets a hold of your iPad) can start 
peeking through your data. A passcode simply acts like a password that locks out 
strangers from using your iPad.
Setting a Passcode
You can define a simple or regular passcode to block access to your iPad. A simple 
passcode lets you define a four-digit number to block access. A regular passcode 
lets you define a passcode of more than four characters that can consist of letters 
and symbols. To set a simple or regular passcode, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Passcode Lock. The Passcode Lock settings screen appears, as shown 
in Figure 8-1.

Chapter 8
Defining When to Ask for a Passcode
If you often turn your iPad off and on in short intervals throughout the day, you 
may not want to keep typing in a passcode. In that case, you can adjust the time 
interval before your iPad will ask for the passcode. The longer the time interval, the 
less chance you’ll constantly need to keep typing in a passcode each time you turn 
on your iPad. However, the longer the time interval, the greater the chance that 
someone can steal or peek at your iPad and see all your data.
To define the time interval before your iPad asks for a passcode, follow 
these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Passcode Lock. An Enter Passcode screen appears.
4.	
Type your passcode. The Passcode Lock settings screen appears.
5.	
Tap Require Passcode. The Require Passcode settings screen appears, as 
shown in Figure 8-3.
6.	
Tap an option such as Immediately, After 5 minutes, or After 1 hour.
7.	
Press the Home button.
Erasing Data After 10 Incorrect Passcodes
Turning on the passcode feature can prevent a thief from peeking at your iPad’s 
data. However, for even more security, you can make your iPad automatically erase 
its data if someone tries 10 incorrect passcodes in a row. To turn on this data-
erasing feature after you have already defined a passcode, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
Figure 8-3: The Require Passcode settings screen 
lets you define a time interval for the iPad to wait 
before asking for a passcode.

Additional Ideas for Protecting Your iPad
Since the iPad is so small and light (and popular), use a passcode to deny thieves 
access to your data if they happen to steal your iPad. For more security, read Chap-
ter 30 to learn how to use MobileMe (http://www.apple.com/mobileme/) to locate 
your iPad whenever it’s turned on and near a Wi-Fi or 3G network. You’ll also learn 
how to encrypt your backups. 
Perhaps the best way to keep strangers from peeking at your iPad is to 
keep your iPad out of sight whenever you’re in a public area, especially when 
you’re outdoors. If you stare at your iPad in a public place, your attention will be 
diverted from your surroundings, which makes it easy for a thief to grab your iPad 
since you’ll be unaware of the thief’s approach. Use your iPad indoors, or make 
sure you’re aware of your surroundings if you use the iPad outside. By always 
being alert for possible thieves who might target your iPad, you can minimize the 
chances that you’ll lose your iPad.
Figure 8-4: You can 
enable a data-erasing 
feature for when some-
one types an incorrect 
passcode 10 times.

There are two ways to connect to the Internet. 
First, you can connect through any Wi-Fi net-
work. Second, if you have the 3G version of the 
iPad, you can connect through a cellular tele-
phone company’s network.
A Wi-Fi network is faster, but it won’t always 
be available, especially if you’re outside. 3G ser­
vice is usually available almost everywhere. Since 
connecting to the Internet can make your iPad 
so much more useful, you need to learn both 
ways of getting on the Internet with your iPad.
In this chapter you’ll learn how to set up an 
Internet connection for your iPad.
Setting Up 
an Internet 
Connection

Chapter 9
What You’ll Be Using
To set up an Internet connection, you need to use the following:
The Settings screen
Setting Up a Wi-Fi Connection
No matter which type of iPad you have, you can always connect to the Internet 
through a Wi-Fi connection. Many public places offer free Wi-Fi connections, and 
your home or office may have a Wi-Fi network.
To set up a Wi-Fi connection with your iPad, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi Networks settings screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 9-1.
3.	
(Optional) Tap the Ask to Join Networks on/off switch. When turned on, 
your iPad always asks for permission before accessing a Wi-Fi network. This 
can let you see exactly which Wi-Fi network your iPad may be accessing. 
It’s usually a good idea to know exactly what network you’re connecting to, 
especially when you’re travelling.
4.	
Tap the Wi-Fi on/off switch so that the switch reads ON. Your iPad tries to 
recognize any Wi-Fi networks. If there are multiple Wi-Fi networks avail-
able, a window lists them all and you can tap the one you want to use. If the 
Wi-Fi network is password-protected, a Password screen appears. (If your 
iPad can’t recognize a Wi-Fi network that you know exists, you’ll need to tap 
Other and type in Wi-Fi settings yourself.)
5.	
(Optional) Type the password to access the Wi-Fi network and tap the 
Join key on the virtual keyboard. Your iPad connects to your chosen Wi-Fi 
network.
Figure 9-1: The Wi-Fi Networks settings screen lets 
you define and choose a Wi-Fi network to use.

Forgetting a Wi-Fi Network
After you’ve connected to a Wi-Fi network once, your iPad will try to automatically 
connect to it in the future. This can be handy the next time you need to use that 
particular Wi-Fi network. However, if you find your iPad trying to latch on to a Wi-Fi 
network that you don’t want to join, you can have your iPad forget that network. 
Forgetting a network is especially useful when a Wi-Fi connection is very slow or 
doesn’t work at all (many Wi-Fi networks in hotels or airports allow you to connect 
but require payment, for example).  
To forget a Wi-Fi network, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi Networks settings screen appears, as shown earlier in 
Figure 9-1.
3.	
Tap the white arrow inside the blue circle that appears to the right of the 
network you want your iPad to forget. The network info screen appears.
4.	
Tap Forget this Network at the top of the screen.
5.	
Tap either Forget or Cancel when prompted.
Connecting to a 3G Cellular Network
If you have the 3G version of the iPad, you have the option of connecting to the 
Internet through a 3G cellular telephone network. Depending on your cellular tele-
phone provider, you can purchase 3G access on a monthly basis for a fixed fee that 
gives you a fixed amount of data.
To set up a 3G account on your iPad, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Cellular Data. The Cellular Data settings screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 9-2.
3.	
Tap the Cellular Data on/off switch to make sure it reads ON.
4.	
(Optional) Tap the Data Roaming on/off switch to turn it ON or OFF. 
(Data Roaming means that your iPad constantly checks the Internet for

email messages, and, in many 
countries, each time it checks 
the Internet you could incur 
a fee.)
5.	
Tap View Account. The 
Cellular Data Account win-
dow appears, as shown in 
Figure 9-3.
6.	
Type in the required informa-
tion and choose a data plan.
Q
Q Note: To sign up for a data plan, 
you must type in a credit card 
num­ber. If you are in an area 
where you can’t get 3G cellular 
tele­phone access, you will have 
to wait to sign up for a 3G data 
plan when you can access a cel-
lular network.
Canceling (or Switching) a Cellular Data Plan
When you sign up for a data plan, it runs for a fixed amount of time, such as 30 days, 
starting with the date that you signed up for that data plan. You’ll receive three alerts 
when your data plan limit reaches 20 percent, 10 percent, and zero. Each alert gives 
you the chance to sign up for your current plan or choose a different plan.
Your data plan will automatically renew every time period until you specifi-
cally turn it off. To turn off (or switch) your data plan, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Cellular Data. The Cellular Data settings screen appears (see Figure 9-2).
3.	
Tap View Account. The Cellular Data Account window appears showing 
your current data plan.
4.	
Tap Cancel Plan or one of the other data plan buttons to switch to that 
data plan.
Additional Ideas for Connecting to the 
Internet
Don’t forget, you can also connect your iPad to the Wi-Fi broadcast from a por-
table hotspot device and to certain smartphones (including the latest iPhones). 
Piggy­backing off your device’s existing wireless Internet connection will let you 
use any provider’s wireless connection—and spare you the second bill.
Figure 9-3: The Cellular Data Account 
window lets you choose a data plan.

If you use a Windows or Macintosh computer, 
you can buy software in a store, over the Inter­
net, or through the mail. No matter how you 
get a program, you can install it on your com­
puter. The iPad is different. You can’t buy iPad 
software from anyplace other than through 
Apple’s App Store.
The reason for this is security. When you 
install programs from any source, there’s always 
the chance of malicious software (aka mal­ware) 
sneaking on to your computer and infecting it. 
By distributing iPad software (more commonly 
known as applications or just apps), Apple can 
inspect all apps to make sure they don’t do 
anything sneaky like capture your password 
and send it to some hacker in another part of 
the world.
In this chapter you’ll learn how to install (and 
uninstall) apps on your iPad.

The iPad’s USB cable
iTunes on your computer
The App Store
Finding Apps on Your iPad
Before you can install apps on the iPad, you need to visit the App Store and find 
an app that you want. You can visit the App Store directly through your iPad or you 
can use iTunes on your computer.
The advantage of accessing the App Store on your iPad is that after you 
download an app, you can start using it right away. The drawback is that you need 
an Internet connection to access the App Store.
The advantage of using iTunes on your computer to access the App Store is 
that you can download apps much faster than you can on the iPad. The drawback 
is that after you download an app into iTunes, you’ll need to transfer that app to 
your iPad before you can start using it.
To find an app for your iPad, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap App Store. The App Store screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Featured icon at the bottom of the screen. The Featured list of iPad 
apps appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1: The Featured list shows certain apps that Apple wants 
people to notice.

Q Note: The iPad can run both iPhone and iPad apps—if you already have an 
iPhone, all the apps you purchased or downloaded will be available to install 
on your iPad. However, iPhone apps may not take advantage of the iPad’s 
ability to rotate or fill out the entire iPad screen.
Installing an App
There are so many choices that just browsing through the App Store can feel like 
getting lost in a shopping mall. But once you find an app that you want, you can 
install it by following these steps:
1.	
Browse through the App Store until you find an app that you want.
2.	
Tap the Price button that appears to the right of the app name. Common 
prices are FREE or $4.99, as shown in Figure 10-5.

From the Home screen, tap App Store. The App Store screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Updates icon at the bottom of the screen. The Updates screen 
appears, listing any applications that you need to update. At this point, 
you can choose which updates you wish to update and install.
Deleting Apps from the iPad
If you’ve installed any apps on your iPad, you can always delete those icons and 
uninstall those apps. (You cannot uninstall any apps that came pre-installed on the 
iPad, such as Notes, Maps, or the Calendar.) You can delete apps from your iPad or 
using iTunes on your computer.
Deleting an App from the iPad
The simplest way to delete an app is directly from your iPad. To delete an icon and 
uninstall the app that the icon represents, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, press and hold your finger on the app icon that you 
want to delete. Your apps will start wriggling. An X in a circle appears in the 
upper-left corner of your chosen icon. (If an X in a circle does not appear, 
that means you cannot delete that icon and uninstall that app.)
Q
Q Note: Press the Home button if you suddenly decide you don’t want to 
delete the icon after all. The X in the circle disappears from your chosen icon.
2.	
Tap the X in the circle. A Delete dialog 
appears, as shown in Figure 10-6.
3.	
Tap Delete. Your chosen icon disappears 
from the Home screen.
4.	
Press the Home button to stop your apps 
from wriggling.
Figure 10-6: The Delete 
dialog alerts you that 
you are uninstalling 
an app.

Deleting an App Using iTunes
To delete an app by using iTunes on your computer, you need to connect your iPad 
to your computer and then follow these steps:
1.	
Run iTunes on your computer.
2.	
Click the name of your iPad under the Devices category in the left pane of 
the Tunes window.
3.	
Click the Apps tab. The screen displays your Home screen panes with all 
your currently installed apps.
4.	
Move the mouse pointer over an app icon that you want to delete. An X in a 
circle appears in the app icon’s upper-left corner.
5.	
Click this close button (the X in the circle). Your chosen app icon disappears.
Q
Q Note: If you select the check boxes of apps displayed in the Apps tab of the 
iTunes window, you can re-install any downloaded apps back on to your iPad.
Running iPhone Apps on the iPad
If you have an iPhone and have already bought iPhone apps, you can install them 
on your iPad too. Although you can run iPhone apps on the iPad, most iPhone 
apps won’t use up the full screen of the iPad, as shown in Figure 10-7.
However, you can expand an iPhone app so it fills up the entire iPad screen. 
Just tap the 2x button in the bottom-right corner of the iPad screen to blow up an 
iPhone app, as shown in Figure 10-8.
Figure 10-7: Most iPhone apps won’t use the entire iPad screen.

To shrink an expanded iPhone app screen back to its normal size, tap the 1x 
button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
Additional Ideas for Installing and 
Uninstalling Apps
Every day, new apps pour into the App Store, so to avoid cluttering up your iPad, 
resist the temptation to keep downloading the latest free and commercial apps. 
Since you can easily delete and re-install apps, you could always pick those apps 
you need right now, such as installing a bunch of children’s apps so your kids can 
play them on your iPad during a trip, and then delete those apps after you get 
back home and can retrieve your iPad from your kids again.
By deleting apps you don’t need and selectively installing and removing 
apps you may not need temporarily, you can keep your iPad lean and ­uncluttered 
so you can actually get your work done and have fun at the same time. As an 
alternative to deleting apps, consider combining multiple apps into a folder as 
explained in Chapter 6.
To turn your iPad into a productivity tool, download and install the iWork 
office suite for the iPad, which will allow you to transfer files between iWork on 
your iPad and iWork on your Macintosh, as described in Chapter 29.
Figure 10-8: You can expand an iPhone app to fill up the iPad screen.

Part 3
Getting on 
the Internet


11
Every iPad comes with the Safari app, which 
lets you browse websites on the Internet. If you 
have used any browser on a computer before, 
you will find Safari on the iPad works in ­similar 
ways. While you’re surfing the Web, you can 
rotate your iPad to portrait or landscape mode. 
Portrait mode lets you see more vertical content 
of a web page, while landscape mode makes 
it easier to see the entire width of a web page. 
No matter which way you decide to view Safari, 
you’ll find that browsing with Safari is easy 
and fun.

What You’ll Be Using
To browse the Internet with Safari, you need to use the following:
>
>
An Internet connection 
(Wi-Fi or 3G)
The Safari app
Navigating Safari 
When using a browser on a regular computer, you can use a mouse to click links, 
menus, and icons. Safari on the iPad works similarly except instead of menus, it just 
displays icons to tap. Any link that you would normally click with the mouse, you 
can just tap with your finger. 
To see how to navigate with Safari on the iPad, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-1.
2.	
Tap the Address field. The virtual keyboard appears. 
3.	
Press the Backspace key, or tap the X that appears to the far right of the 
Address field to clear the contents of the Address field.
4.	
Type a website address such as www.nostarch.com. As you type, a list of 
previously viewed website addresses appears.

Tap the Go key on the virtual keyboard. Your chosen website appears.
7.	
Tap the Back arrow icon. Your previous web page appears.
8.	
Tap the Forward arrow icon. The web page you viewed after the current one 
now appears.
9.	
Place two fingertips on the screen, and move them away from each other to 
zoom in on the currently displayed web page. 
10.	
Place two fingertips on the screen, and move them closer together to zoom 
out on the currently displayed web page.
11.	
Double-tap on a column of text. Safari zooms to the column. Double-tap 
again, and Safari zooms out.
12.	
Tap the very top of the iPad's display, without hitting the address or search 
bar. You jump all the way to the top of the page you were reading.
13.	
Tap any link on the currently displayed web page. The new page opens.
Searching in Safari
Typing a website address can be cumbersome, so a faster way to find a website is 
to use a search engine. Safari displays a Search field in the upper-right corner of 
the screen, which lets you search using Google, Bing, or Yahoo!.
To search the Web, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Search field that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. 
The virtual keyboard appears at the bottom of the screen.
3.	
Tap the Backspace key, or tap the X that appears to the far right of the 
Search field to clear the contents of the Search field.
4.	
Type a word or phrase that you want to find, and tap the Search key on the 
virtual keyboard. (While you’re typing, a list of possible words or phrases 
appears, which you can select by tapping.) Safari displays the results from 
your search.
Safari’s default search engine is Google. You can change your search engine 
by tapping the Settings icon from the Home screen, tapping the Safari section, 
tapping the Search Engine button, and then tapping the search engine you want 
to use, such as Google, Yahoo!, or Bing.
Opening Multiple Web Pages
On a regular computer, you can open multiple browser windows or display web 
pages in separate tabs within a single window. On an iPad, Safari handles multiple 
open web pages differently. You can still open multiple web pages, but only one 
web page can appear on the screen at a time.
There are two ways to open multiple web pages in Safari. First, you can 
open a blank web page and then type in an address (such as www.nostarch.com) 
or use a search engine. Second, you can hold your finger on a link and choose to 
open the link in a new page.

Chapter 11
Opening a Blank Web Page
If you’re looking at a website (such as one related to work) and suddenly decide 
you want to check out another website (such as one displaying the latest sports 
scores or movie listings) but don’t want to close the first website, open a blank 
web page and view another website in this other web page.
To see how to open and switch between multiple open web pages, follow 
these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Address field. The virtual keyboard appears.
3.	
Tap the Backspace key, or tap the X that appears to the far right of the 
Address field to clear the contents of the Address field.
4.	
Type a website address such as www.nostarch.com, and tap the Go key on 
the virtual keyboard. Your chosen website appears.
5.	
Tap the Pages icon (it looks like two overlapping pages). The screen shows 
your currently open web pages and a New Page web page icon, as shown in 
Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2: Safari displays open web pages as thumbnail images. 
The X in the upper-left corner allows you to close web pages.

the screen and Address and Search fields at the top of the screen.
7.	
Tap the Address field, type a website address (such as www.apple.com), 
and tap the Go key on the virtual keyboard. (Alternatively, tap the Search 
field, type a word or phrase to search, and tap the Search key.) Safari dis-
plays your chosen web page.
8.	
Tap the Pages icon. Safari displays thumbnail images of your open web 
pages. Now you can switch between the web pages just by tapping on 
the web page thumbnail image that you want to view. You can have up to 
nine web pages open at a time.
9.	
(Optional) Tap the Close button of a web page that you want to close. Your 
chosen web page disappears.
Opening a Link in Another Web Page
Normally if you tap a link on a web page, the linked web page replaces the cur-
rently displayed web page. If you don’t want to lose track of a website, you might 
prefer having a linked web page appear in its own web page.
To see how to open a link as a separate web page, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Address field. The virtual keyboard appears.
3.	
Tap the Backspace key, or tap the X that appears to the far right of the 
Address field to clear the contents of the Address field.
4.	
Type a website address such as www.nostarch 
.com, and tap the Go key on the virtual keyboard. 
Your chosen website appears.
5.	
Press and hold your finger over any link on the 
web page. After a few seconds, a menu appears 
as shown in Figure 11-3.
6.	
Tap the Open in New Page button. Your linked 
web page appears. (Tapping the Open button 
replaces the current web page with the linked 
page.)
7.	
Tap the Pages icon. Notice that your linked web 
page appears as a separate thumbnail image.

Printing a Web Page
If you find a particularly interesting web page, you may not only want to bookmark 
it (see Chapter 12), but you may also want to print a copy, too. To print from an iPad, 
you need a wireless printer or a printer connected to your computer, although not 
all printers will work correctly with your iPad. 
To print a web page, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
2.	
Visit your favorite website (by either typ­ing the complete address such as 
www.nostarch.com, or by searching for it in the Search field).
3.	
Tap the Action icon (it looks like a square with 
a curved arrow). A menu appears, as shown 
earlier in Figure 11-4.

Additional Ideas for Browsing the Internet
Browsing the Internet through Safari on your iPad is nearly identical to browsing 
web pages using a browser on your computer. Browsing the Internet on your iPad 
can be a great way to kill time; whenever you have a spare moment, you can look 
up sports scores, movie reviews, or the latest news from around the world. 
With access to the Internet at your fingertips, you can browse for fun, for 
work, or for education. With Safari and an Internet connection, your iPad is a win-
dow to another world.
Figure 11-5: Printing a 
web page


If you frequently visit the same websites, you 
may tire of typing the same website addresses 
or search phrases each time you want to find 
those sites again. To make finding sites easier, 
you can create bookmarks.
As you browse, Safari automatically stores 
the websites you visit in a History window. This 
History window of recently visited websites can 
be handy when you want to find a site that you 
recently visited, but if you like a particular web-
site, you might want to bookmark it so you can 
access it any time, at the tap of a finger, without 
having to peruse the History window.
In this chapter you’ll learn how to create, 
display, and delete bookmarks of your favorite 
websites using Safari.

What You’ll Be Using
To use bookmarks with Safari, you need to use the following:
>
>
An Internet connection  
(Wi-Fi or 3G)
The Safari app
The Settings screen
Using the History Window
As you browse the Internet, Safari automatically keeps track of each website that 
you visit and stores each address in a History list going back the past week. Now 
if you remember visiting a particular site but don’t recall how you found it, just 
visit the History window, find the website’s name, and tap on its name to view that 
website.
Revisiting a Website Stored in the History Window
To see how the History window works, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Bookmark icon (it looks like an open book). A Bookmarks window 
appears, as shown in Figure 12-1. It lets you find a previously viewed or saved 
website address.
3.	
Tap History. The History window lists all the websites you’ve recently visited, 
including those viewed in the past week, as shown in Figure 12-2.

(Optional) Tap one of the day folders, such as a folder labeled Friday or 
Monday, to view the website addresses you visited on that particular day.
5.	
Tap a website to view that site.
Clearing the History Window
Since Safari automatically adds every website address you visit to its History win-
dow, that History window can get cluttered. If you know you won’t need to visit 
any previously visited websites, you can clear this History window to make it look 
neater—or to cover your tracks. To clear the History window, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Bookmark icon and then tap History. The History window appears.
3.	
Tap Clear History. A red Clear History button and gray Cancel button 
appear at the bottom of the History window.
4.	
Tap Clear History (or Cancel).
Q
Q Note: Clearing the History window wipes out the past few days worth of your 
previously visited websites. You cannot undo this action, so make sure you 
really want to clear your History window. You can also clear the History list in 
Safari via your iPad’s settings, which you can access from the Home screen.
Adding and Managing Bookmarks
Safari comes with a list of bookmarks already created for you, but you’ll probably 
want to add your own bookmarks to store your favorite websites. You can store a 
bookmark in three places.
First, you can store a bookmark within the Bookmarks window. This keeps 
your bookmark out of sight until you need it.
Second, you can store a bookmark in the Bookmarks Bar, which you can 
optionally hide or display at the top of the Safari screen. This makes your favorite 
bookmarks visible at all times. This is handy if you visit the same set of sites often.
Third, you can save your bookmark as an icon on your Home screen. This 
type of bookmark makes it easy to access your favorite websites with just a single 
touch from the Home screen, without even opening Safari.
Adding a Bookmark to the Bookmarks Window or 
Bookmarks Bar
To store a bookmarked website in the Bookmarks window, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
2.	
Visit your favorite website (either by typing the complete address such as 
www.nostarch.com or by searching for it in the Search field).
3.	
Tap the Action icon (it looks like a square with a curved arrow). A menu of 
options appears, as shown in Figure 12-3.
4.	
Tap the Add Bookmark icon. An Add Bookmark window appears (see Fig-
ure 12-4) with a virtual keyboard.

5.	
Edit the name of your favorite website as you want it displayed.
Q
Q Note: Ideally, keep your website names short. 
Long website names take up more space if you 
store them in the Bookmarks Bar.
6.	
(Optional) Tap the Bookmarks icon, and tap 
either Bookmarks or Bookmarks Bar, as 
shown in Figure 12-5.
7.	
Tap Save. Your bookmark gets saved in your 
chosen location either in the Bookmarks 
window or in the Bookmarks Bar.
Showing (or Hiding) the Bookmarks Bar
When you store bookmarks on the Bookmarks Bar, you can access them in two ways. 
First, you can access them through the Bookmarks window. Second, you can access 
them through the Bookmarks Bar, which appears at the top of Safari.
To save space, the Bookmarks Bar may not be visible, but you can make it 
visible by following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Safari. The Safari settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap the Always Show Bookmarks Bar  
on/off switch to turn it ON (or OFF if you want to hide the Bookmarks Bar).

Tap Done in the bookmarks pane.
Q
Q Note: If you open the Bookmarks window and tap the Edit button, you can 
rearrange, delete, or rename a folder. To rename a folder, just tap the Edit 
button, and then tap the folder name.
Additional Ideas for Bookmarking Favorite 
Websites
If you regularly visit certain websites, you can store these websites as icons on 
the Home screen and then organize all the website icons on a separate pane 
on the Home screen. That way, you can switch to that Home screen pane to see 
all your important websites.
If you share an iPad with others, create folders with each person’s name, and 
then let each person store their own favorite websites in these separate, named 
folders. Then others don’t have to wade through bookmarks of websites that 
they’ll never visit in a million years.
By saving bookmarks, you can browse the Web without ever needing to type 
in a convoluted address again or dig through search engine listings—unless you 
want to find something new.
Figure 12-7: You can 
­create and name a folder 
to store bookmarks.

To help you stay in touch with people around 
the world, you can set up one or more email 
accounts on your iPad. As long as you can 
access the Internet on your iPad, you’ll be able 
to use Gmail, Yahoo!, MobileMe, AOL, Micro­
soft Exchange, or any other email account that 
you want.

Additional Ideas for Setting Up and 
Customizing Email Accounts
Since you can set up multiple email accounts, consider creating one account for 
work and a second one for personal use. That way, you won’t accidentally send a 
flippant message about your vacation to your boss or a serious message about 
work to your nine-year-old nephew.
After you’ve set up one or more email accounts, consider customizing your 
signature to display or advertise your website, your business, or your own unique 
skills. For example, if you’re a carpenter or a doctor, your signature could publicize 
your line of work such as “The Most Honest Carpenter in Denver” or “The Doctor 
That Children Trust.” The more free advertising you can get through email signa­
tures, the more exposure you’ll get, which will be better for you.
If email is important to you, you can read and write messages on your iPad 
and never lose contact with anybody. Now all you have to worry about is giving out 
your email address sparingly only to those people you trust. Otherwise you’ll risk 
getting overrun with unsolicited messages.


After you have set up at least one email account 
on your iPad, you can read messages that you’ve 
retrieved and write new messages to send to 
others. As you receive messages from others, 
you may want to move them to different folders 
or just delete them altogether.
In this chapter you’ll learn how to read, write, 
and organize email on your iPad.

>
An Internet connection  
(Wi-Fi or 3G)
The Mail app
Reading Email
Each email account you set up on your iPad contains multiple folders for storing 
messages. When you receive messages, they get stored in the Inbox folder. If 
you have set up multiple email accounts, you’ll have a single inbox that displays 
new mail for all accounts called All Inboxes, as well as an individual Inbox for each 
account, as shown in Figure 14-1.
To read your messages stored in an email account, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Mail. The Mail screen appears, displaying what 
you last viewed.
2.	
Tap the Back button that appears in the upper-left corner of the screen. 
If you have set up multiple email accounts, a list of your email accounts 
appears.

Tap the Inbox folder. A list of messages appears.
5.	
Tap the message you want to read. Your message appears in the right pane 
of the screen, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Moving a Message to a Folder
Since your Inbox folder constantly receives messages, you may want to organize 
them in different folders that you can create through your email provider. By mov-
ing messages to different folders, you can stay organized. In addition, moving 
messages also lets you retrieve deleted messages from the Trash folder.
Moving a Single Message
To move a single message to a different folder, follow these steps:
1.	
While using the Mail app, tap the Move icon (it looks like a folder) that 
appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. A list of folders appears 
in the left pane, as shown in Figure 14-3.

Replying to, Forwarding, or Printing an 
Email Message
The simplest way to write a message is to reply to an existing message that you’ve 
already received. That way, you can send the message back to the sender’s email 
address to provide a little context with your response without having to type it all 
over again. Another option is to forward a message. This lets you send a received 
message to someone else. If you have a wireless printer, you can also print a mes-
sage so you have a copy you can review later.
Replying to a Message
To reply to a message, follow these steps:
1.	
Follow all the steps in “Reading Email” on 
page 96 to view the message to which 
you want to reply.
2.

Deleting Messages
The more messages you receive, the more you’ll likely need to delete messages to 
keep your Inbox folder from overflowing with too many messages. To delete mes-
sages, you can delete them individually or select multiple messages and delete 
them all at once.
To delete a message, follow these steps:
1.	
Follow all the steps in “Reading Email” on page 96 to view the message 
you want to delete.
2.	
Tap the Delete icon at the top of the screen. The currently displayed mes-
sage gets moved to the Trash folder.
3.	
(Optional) To delete multiple messages, tap the Edit button to display 
radio buttons to the left of each message. Tap the radio button of each mes-
sage you want to delete and then tap the Trash button at the bottom of the 
screen.
Q
Q Note: To permanently delete messages, you’ll need to delete all the messages 
stored in the Trash folder.
Searching Email
After you’ve received multiple messages, you may lose track of all of them. One 
way to deal with this flood of information is to constantly move messages into their 
own folders. Since this takes constant effort, you may find it easier just to search for 
a particular message instead.
You can search for text that appears in the From, To, or Subject fields, or you 
can search for text that appears in any of those three fields. This lets you search for 
messages that you received from a specific email address, messages that you sent 
to a particular email address, messages with certain types of subjects, or all three 
(the From, To, and Subject fields).
To search for a messages stored in an email account, follow these steps:
1.	
While using the Mail app, tap a folder that contains the messages you want 
to find. A list of messages appears.
2.	
Tap the From, To, Subject, or All button at the top of the folder window.
3.	
Tap the Search field. A virtual keyboard appears at the bottom of the screen, 
as shown in Figure 14-8.
4.	
Type a word or phrase. As you type, the folder window displays only those 
messages that match your search criteria.

Additional Ideas for Reading, Writing, and 
Organizing Messages
After you’ve read a message, you may want to store it in another folder right away or 
delete it to keep your Inbox folder easy to manage. If you allow a flood of messages 
to fill your Inbox folder, it will be harder to find the one message you really want.
The Search feature can help you find a particular message, but to ensure that 
this Search feature works, train yourself to type descriptive words or phrases in the 
Subject field of all your outgoing messages. That way, you’ll be able to search for a 
particular message using the Subject field.
Take time periodically to browse through your messages and weed out the 
ones you don’t need. The less cluttered your Inbox folder, the easier it will be to 
find what you need when you need it.

Video, Music, 
Photos, and 
Ebooks


You can think of your iPad as an independent 
computer, but it’s really an extension of a desk-
top or laptop computer. Since you probably 
already have important data stored on another 
computer, you need to learn how to transfer 
files to your iPad so you can use those files 
wherever you go.
To transfer files from your computer to 
your iPad, you’ll need to use the iTunes pro-
gram. Every Macintosh comes with iTunes, but 
if you have a Windows computer, you’ll need to 
download and install iTunes directly from the 
Apple website (http://www.apple.com/itunes/).

What You’ll Be Using
To transfer files to your iPad, you need to use the following:
>
>
The iPad’s USB cable
iTunes on your computer
The iBooks app
Importing Files to iTunes on Your Computer
Before you can transfer files to your iPad from your computer, you must store 
those files in the iTunes program on your computer. You can buy music and movies 
directly from iTunes on your computer, or you can get them from another source. 
For example, you can get a copy of an audio file from a friend or download it from 
another source, such as Amazon.com. Most people capture photographs using a 
digital camera or a mobile phone, which they can then transfer to their computer.
Q
Q Note: You can also buy and download songs directly to your iPad using the 
iTunes app on your iPad. In most cases, movies and TV shows are too big to 
download directly to your iPad, so you’ll first need to download them on your 
computer and then transfer them to your iPad from the iTunes program on 
your computer, like you’re doing in this section.
No matter where you get your photo, audio, ebook, and video files, you must 
make sure that any files you import into iTunes are stored in file formats that iTunes 
(and your iPad) can recognize. Table 15-1 lists the most popular file formats that 
iTunes supports for each type of file.
Table 15-1: Common File Formats Recognized by the iPad
File Type
iPad-Compatible File Format
Photo
BMP, JPG, GIF, PSD, TIF, SGI, and PNG 
Audio

Ebook
EPUB and PDF
Video
MPEG-4 and MOV
Q
Q Note: To convert files into one of the file formats recognized by the iPad, 
you may need a special audio/video file conversion program, such as Audacity 
(http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) or Handbrake (http://handbrake.fr/). Pro-
grams such as iPhoto or Photoshop Elements can convert graphic images to 
a compatible file format for your iPad. Programs such as iMovie and Premiere 
Elements can convert video to different video formats as well. Flip ahead 
to “Converting Files to EPUB Format” on page 116 for hints on converting 
ebooks.

To import an audio or video file into the iTunes program on your computer, 
follow these steps:
1.	
Run the iTunes program on your computer.
2.	
Choose File4Add to Library (Mac OS X) or File4Add File to Library 
(Windows). An Add to Library dialog appears.
3.	
Click the file that you want to import into iTunes, and click Choose (or Open). 
Your chosen file gets loaded into iTunes. Depending on the type of file you 
chose, your file may appear in a different iTunes category, such as Music or 
Movies.
Q
Q Note: Alternatively, you can simply drag your files from Finder or Windows 
Explorer into iTunes. With photographs, you don’t need to import them 
directly into iTunes. Instead, you can store them in iPhoto (on a Macintosh) 
or in any folder.
Transferring Music to Your iPad
The most common type of audio files you can store in iTunes and transfer to your 
iPad are songs, audio lectures, and voice memos (which are typically recorded 
from an iPhone). You’ll probably find the bulk of your audio files stored in the Music 
category.
To transfer music and other audio files to your iPad, follow these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPad to your computer using the USB cable that came with 
your iPad.
2.	
Run the iTunes program on your computer.

Synchronizing Podcasts
Podcasts can consist of multiple episodes; some podcasts are audio only, while 
others are video. Since it’s possible to download podcasts directly to your iPad 
or on your computer, it’s possible that you could download a podcast episode to 
your iPad and a newer episode of that same podcast on your computer. When you 
connect your iPad to your computer, iTunes is smart enough to synchronize the 
different podcast episodes together so both your computer and your iPad contain 
identical podcast episodes.
When synchronizing podcasts, you need to choose not only which podcasts 
to transfer, but also which episodes of that podcast to synchronize. You can select 
individual episodes, or you can automatically sync episodes based on criteria, such 
as all unplayed episodes or only the most recent episodes.
To synchronize podcasts with your iPad, follow these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPad to your computer with the USB cable, and run the iTunes 
program on your computer.
2.	
Click the name of your iPad in the Devices category, and then click the 
Podcasts tab. The Podcasts screen appears.
3.	
Check (or uncheck) the Sync Podcasts checkbox. If you uncheck the Sync 
Podcasts checkbox, you won’t be able to choose any other options. If you 
check the Sync Podcasts checkbox, you’ll be able to select which podcasts 
and which episodes to transfer, as shown in Figure 15-2.
Figure 15-1: Additional checkboxes appear to let you select 
playlists, artists, genres, or albums.

Converting Files to EPUB Format
If you have non-EPUB or non-PDF documents (such as Microsoft Word .doc/.docx 
files) that you want to store on your iPad, you have several choices. You can use 
the iWork app to open and view these files (see Chapter 29 for details). Or you can 
convert the file to the EPUB file format. Some websites that offer free EPUB conver-
sion are 2EPUB (http://www.2epub.com/), EPUB 2 Go (http://www.epub2go.com/), 
and ePubConverter (http://www.epubconverter.org/).
Q
Q Note: Converting any file into another file format, such as a Microsoft Word 
file into the EPUB file format, may not always be accurate. This could mean 
text is formatted incorrectly or pictures may be missing.
If you’d rather not hassle with converting files, you can download free EPUB 
books from sites such as ePubBooks.com (http://www.epubbooks.com/), Project 
Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/), and Google Books (http://books.google 
.com/). Many classic books are freely available for download because they are in 
the public domain.
Rather than convert files to EPUB format, you might find it easier to convert 
files to a PDF file instead. On a Macintosh, you can choose the Print command to 
convert any file (such as a word processor or spreadsheet file) into a PDF file. On a 
Windows PC, you may need to use PDF creation software, such as Adobe Acrobat, 
to convert files to PDF. 
Figure 15-7: The Books tab lists all the available EPUB and 
PDF books stored on your computer.

yourself and open the attachment in the Mail app. 
If you’re ready to learn how to read ebooks and navigate the iBooks app, flip 
ahead to Chapter 19.
Synchronizing Contacts
On the iPad, contact information gets stored in the Contacts app. If you’re using 
a Macintosh, this information is probably already stored in your Address Book 
program. If you’re using a Windows computer, this contact information is likely in 
Microsoft Outlook or Windows Live Mail.
In addition, you can also store and synchronize contact information that you 
may have saved in Google Contacts or Yahoo! Address Book. Syncing means that 
any new contact you add to your address book of choice will automatically appear 
in your iPad (and vice versa).
To synchronize your contact information, follow these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPad to your computer using the USB cable.
2.	
Run iTunes on your computer.
3.	
Click the name of your iPad in the Devices category.
4.	
Click the Info tab. The Info screen appears.

Synchronizing Appointments
Appointments can help keep you on schedule so you know where you have to 
be and when. On the iPad, all this information gets stored in the Calendar app. If 
you’re using a Macintosh, this information gets synchronized into your iCal pro-
gram. If you’re using a Windows computer, this contact information gets synchro-
nized into Microsoft Outlook. To synchronize appointments, follow these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPad to your computer using the USB cable.
2.	
Run iTunes on your computer.

Synchronizing Mail, Notes, and Bookmarks
Most people rely on email to stay in touch with friends and business associates. 
Since staying in touch through email can be crucial for many people, you may want 
to synchronize your email accounts between your computer and your iPad.
Synchronizing email affects only your account settings, not the actual mes-
sages. Synchronized settings let you access your email from either your computer 
or your iPad without having to retype all those cryptic mail account settings.
After you’ve synchronized email account settings on your computer and 
iPad, you’ll be able to read and access the same messages on either device. This 
lets you read a message on your iPad while you’re on the road, then return back to 
your computer to read and respond to that message on your computer.
On the iPad, you can synchronize email account settings from the Mail app 
and the Mail program (Macintosh) or Microsoft Outlook or Windows Live Mail 
(Windows).
If you often get good ideas and need to jot them down, you could scribble 
them on the nearest scrap of paper. However, it might be better to store them in 
the Notes app on your iPad and then synchronize those notes to the Mail program 
on a Macintosh or Microsoft Outlook on Windows. Notes act like miniature word 
processor documents for storing text.
Finally, you may have a group of favorite bookmarks that you’d like to 
transfer between your iPad’s Safari browser and your computer web browser. By 
keeping your favorite bookmarks synchronized, you’ll be able to visit your favorite 
websites whenever you need them.
To synchronize email, notes, and browser bookmarks, follow these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPad to your computer using the USB cable.
2.	
Run iTunes on your computer.
3.	
Click the name of your iPad in the Devices category.

Additional Ideas for Syncing Data
You can freely erase and transfer different audio, video, and ebook files to your 
iPad, so don’t think you need to cram everything from your computer onto your 
iPad. You can transfer a handful of audio or video files from your computer that you 
want to hear or watch for that day and then pick an entirely different batch of audio 
or video files to use the next day.
If you’re learning a foreign language, you can store audio files of that lan-
guage in the iTunes program on your computer and then transfer them to your 
iPad so you can hear them wherever you go. You can load motivational lectures as 
audio files and take them with your iPad, too.
Figure 15-10: The Info tab lets you choose information to 
synchronize with your iPad, such as email account settings, 
browser bookmarks, or notes.

Many people have audio CDs that they can 
store in iTunes on their computer and then 
transfer these music files to their iPad. It’s also 
easy to download music files from other online 
services, such as Amazon.com, and transfer 
them into iTunes.
However, one of the simplest ways to add 
new content to your iPad is through Apple’s 
online stores. If you want to buy music, mov-
ies, TV shows, or audiobooks, you can use the 
iTunes Store.
If you want to buy new ebooks, you can visit 
the iBookstore. With so many ways to get the 
latest movies, TV shows, hit songs, and best-
selling books, you’ll never run out of ways to 
keep yourself entertained with your iPad.

Shopping for Music, Movies, TV Shows, and 
Audiobooks
Shopping online on the iTunes Store is like getting lost in a huge shopping mall. 
With so many options available, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number 
of choices. To help you navigate your way around iTunes, iTunes lets you choose 
separate Music, Movies, TV Shows, and Audiobooks categories. Within each cat-
egory, you can choose to view the latest featured products or the top sellers. For 
even more help locating what you want, you can choose different genres.
Q
Q Note: Somewhat confusingly, iTunes on your Mac or PC is a full-fledged music 
player where you can also buy music. But on the iPad, you play music through 
the iPod App. iTunes on the iPad is how you’ll buy new media.

Shopping for iBooks
If you want to find the latest best sellers, you could rush to your nearest bookstore 
and carry around a handful of bulky books that weigh more than your iPad. A bet-
ter alternative is to download the ebook version of those books directly on your 
iPad through the iBooks app.

Q Note: You must download and install the free iBooks app before you can 
browse the iBookstore. See Chapter 15 for instructions on installing it.
To browse the iBookstore, follow these steps:

Additional Ideas for Shopping Online
Buying audio, video, and ebooks through one of Apple’s online stores represents 
the most convenient way to load new content onto your iPad. Although most peo-
ple naturally seem to gravitate toward the latest releases, don’t overlook the huge 
library of older products that you might find interesting as well.
Browse through iTunes using the Genius feature, and iTunes can analyze your 
current music library to determine which songs by other artists you might be inter-
ested in hearing. By exploring similar but different artists who you may never have 
heard before, you can expand your audio and video library without wasting your 
money randomly guessing which artists you might like next.
For ebooks, just remember that for every latest best seller, there are prob-
ably dozens of similar books that have been written, and those older books are 
probably much less expensive than the latest best seller. Many classics are now in 
the public domain and are totally free.
Figure 16-7: You can browse for books based on the author’s name.

If you have an iPod or other portable digital 
music player, you can put it aside because your 
iPad essentially duplicates all the features of an 
iPod (except for the smaller size). Besides listen-
ing to music, you can also listen to podcasts, 
audiobooks, or even iTunes University lectures.
Before you can play any audio files, you’ll 
need to load them into your iPad, as explained 
in Chapters 15 and 16.

Rather than search through individual categories, such as the Music or Podcasts 
libraries, you might find it easier just to search for a particular audio file by typing 
part or all of the recording artist’s name, song title, or album name.
To search for any audio file stored in your iPad, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap iPod. The iPod screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Search field that appears in the upper-right corner of the iPod 
screen. A virtual keyboard appears, as shown in Figure 17-11.
3.	
Type a word or phrase. As you type, the iPod app displays a list of matching 
items. Tap the one you want to play.
4.	
Tap the Hide Keyboard key at the bottom right of the virtual keyboard.
Additional Ideas for Listening to Audio Files
With the iPad, you have your choice of blasting your audio files through the iPad’s 
speakers or plugging in headphones and listening to your audio files in private. 
However you choose to enjoy your audio files, your iPad can help you take your 
audio files wherever you go and enjoy listening to them at any time.
If you suddenly need to access the iPod app, don’t forget you can press the 
Home button twice and swipe to the left to view the iPod controls, or just tap the 
orange iPod icon and jump into the full app.

Although you can watch some videos through 
the iPod app (such as iTunes U courses or pod-
casts stored as video files), you may not want to 
wade through the mix of audio and video files 
stored in the iPod app. When you just want to 
watch video, you can use the Videos or YouTube 
app and turn your iPad into a portable viewing 
device.
In this chapter you will learn how to watch 
and control video files stored on your iPad, 
stored only on your computer, or stored in 
YouTube’s video library collection.

Choosing a YouTube Video
For those times when you want to watch something for just a few minutes, you can 
browse the massive selection of videos available on YouTube. On your iPad, you 
can access YouTube directly without going through your browser at all. All you 
need is a reliable and (preferably) fast Internet connection, and you’ll be ready to 
watch short video clips whether you’re standing in line or sitting down.
Before you start browsing YouTube’s massive library of videos, make sure you 
have a reliable Internet connection. If you have a weak Internet connection, you may 
spend your time staring at a screen that appears frozen but occasionally lurches 
forward to display a few additional frames before grinding to a halt once more.

1.	
From the Home screen, tap YouTube. The YouTube screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Search field that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. 
The virtual keyboard appears.

Additional Ideas for Watching Videos
By loading educational podcasts or iTunes U courses, you can improve your cur-
rent work skills or develop new ones. For the intellectual challenge, download 
video iTunes U courses on topics that interest you so you can turn your iPad into a 
portable educational tool.
Bring along a pair of headphones or ear buds so you can watch a video on 
your iPad without disturbing others (although others will likely disturb you so they 
can see how the iPad works). 
To avoid cramming too many videos onto your iPad, you can store videos on 
your PC or Mac and then stream your video to your iPad. This lets you watch videos 
on your iPad without having to store them on your iPad.
To stream videos, you need a Wi-Fi network. On your computer, open iTunes, 
click the Advanced menu, and choose the Turn On Home Sharing option. You’ll 
need to get a free Apple ID to turn on this feature, but then you’ll be able to watch 
videos on your iPad without going through the hassle of transferring those video 
files between your iPad and your computer.
To get even more out of watching YouTube videos, visit YouTube’s website 
(http://www.youtube.com/) and create an account for free. With a free YouTube 
account, you can upload your own videos (and view them using the My Videos 
icon), create video playlists (and view them through the Favorites icon), or sub-
scribe to certain YouTube video creators.

For those who love to read, an iPad can become 
an indispensable device since you can cram 
thousands of different books into an iPad with-
out the drawbacks of the physical weight or bulk 
of these books. With ebooks, you can read the 
latest best sellers, the best from classic litera-
ture, or anything in between.
To read ebooks on your iPad, you’ll need to 
download the free iBooks app from the App 
Store. After you install the iBooks app, you can 
start downloading and reading ebooks directly 
from Apple’s iBookstore.

Tap the screen, and tap Library in the upper-left corner of the screen. The 
virtual bookshelf screen reappears. You can now choose another book to 
read.
Turning the Pages of an Ebook
In addition to simply paging through your ebook, you can also jump to a new page 
by using bookmarks or the table of contents.
Turning One Page at a Time
While reading an ebook, you’ll spend most of your time turning pages one at a 
time. If you want to turn to the next page, place your finger on the right margin and 
swipe your finger to the left. If you want to see the previous page, place your finger 
on the left margin and swipe your finger to the right. Either swiping motion curls 
the page as if you were turning a real book page, as shown in Figure 19-3.
You can also just tap the right margin (to view the next page) or the left mar-
gin (to view the previous page).
To turn pages when viewing a PDF file, just swipe your finger to the left (to 
view the next page) or to the right (to view the previous page).

Jumping to Any Page in an Ebook
Rather than turn pages one at a time or jump to specific chapters or sections in an 
ebook, you might just want to jump to a certain page in your ebook. To jump to 
any page in an ebook, follow these steps:
1.	
While reading an ebook in iBooks, flip through several pages, and tap a 
page.
2.	
Notice that the bottom of the screen displays the current page number, the 
total number of pages in the ebook, and how many pages are left in that 
particular chapter. In addition, a line of dots appears at the bottom of the 
screen, which represents the pages of the ebook. A current page icon (it 
looks like a brown square over one of the dots) can show you the relative 
position of the currently displayed page compared to the total number of 
pages in the ebook, as shown in Figure 19-6.
3.	
Place your finger over the current page icon and slide it left or right over the 
row of dots. As you slide the current page icon, a pop-up appears, telling 
you the current chapter (or section) and page number.
4.	
Lift your finger off the screen to view a page. Your chosen page now 
appears.

Making Ebooks Easier to Read
If you find that the text is hard to read with a paper book, you either have to buy a 
magnifying glass, get a special large-print version of the book, or just do nothing 
and suffer. Fortunately with ebooks, you can modify the text to make it more read-
able by adjusting the font, font size, and screen brightness.
Q
Q Note: You cannot change the font or font size of a PDF file, but you can

Additional Ideas for Reading Ebooks
There’s a saying that goes, “Leaders are readers.” With iBooks, you can easily carry 
and read all types of books to help you become a better person, whether you want 
to read for work, pleasure, or education.
If you purchased Amazon’s Kindle or Barnes & Noble’s NOOK and bought 
Kindle or NOOK ebooks, download the free Kindle or NOOK app for your iPad, 
and you can transfer and read all your Kindle or NOOK ebooks on your iPad. Now 
your investment in all those ebooks won’t be a waste of money when you wind 
up carrying your iPad everywhere and leaving your old reader to collect dust in 
a closet.
If you also read ebooks on your iPhone or com-
puter, you can sync your iBooks across devices. Just 
click Sync when prompted by iBooks, as shown in 
Figure 19-16. To change your ebook synchronization 
options, tap the Settings icon from the Home screen 
and tap iBooks (under the Apps category on the 
left-hand side) to view your iBooks synchronization 
options.
As ebooks grow in popularity, you can expect to 
find more choices covering a wide variety of topics, so 
you should never run out of reading material, unless 
your iPad runs out of battery power first.
Figure 19-16: Apple 
will sync your iBooks 
and bookmarks 
between devices.

The latest version of the iPad includes a front- 
and back-facing camera for capturing still or 
video images and videoconferencing with your 
friends and family. Apple calls their videocon-
ferencing system FaceTime, and you’ll be able 
to video chat with anyone who has a new iPad, 
iPhone, iPod touch, or even just a Mac with a 
webcam. If you capture stills or videos, you can 
transfer them to your computer to edit them, 
or use apps like Photoshop Express (photos) or 
iMovie (videos) to edit them directly on your 
iPad. As long as you have your iPad with you, 
you can capture pictures wherever you go.

Setting Up FaceTime
Perhaps one of the more practical uses for the iPad’s cameras is to chat with some-
one through a videoconference using FaceTime. To use FaceTime, both you and 
the other person need an iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, or a Mac with a webcam, and 
Wi-Fi access.
To call someone who has an iPhone, you simply need that person’s iPhone 
number. To call someone who has an iPad, iPod touch, or Mac, you need to use 
that person’s email address, which they have assigned as their FaceTime ID.
Before you can make a FaceTime call, you must assign an email address to 
your iPad’s FaceTime account. To define one or more email addresses, follow these 
steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears. (If you 
start FaceTime without setting up an account, you’ll be prompted to enter an 
existing Apple ID.) 
2.	
Tap FaceTime. The FaceTime screen appears, as shown in Figure 20-4.
3.	
If you already have an Apple ID and password, type that in the user name 
and password text fields. Otherwise tap the Create New Account button to 
display a dialog where you can define a user name, as shown in Figure 20-5.
4.	
Type your name, email address, password, and other information to create a 
FaceTime account. Then tap Done. Another screen appears where you can 
define an email address for your FaceTime account, as shown in Figure 20-6.

a FaceTime chat. Tap Next to display the FaceTime screen again, as shown in 
Figure 20-7.
6.	
(Optional) Tap the FaceTime on/off switch to turn FaceTime on or off, or 
tap the Add Another Email button if you want to associate your FaceTime 
account with two or more email addresses. At this point, anyone else can 
contact you through FaceTime by using the email address you assigned to 
your FaceTime account.

Making a FaceTime Call
When you want to make a FaceTime to call to someone else who uses a Macintosh, 
iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch, make sure you are in a Wi-Fi hotspot and then follow 
these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap the FaceTime icon. The FaceTime screen 
appears, using the front-facing camera so you can see how you will look to 
others, as shown in Figure 20-8.
2.	
(Optional) If you have already used FaceTime on your iPad, you can tap the 
Favorites or Recents icons in the bottom-right corner of the screen to con-
nect with someone you chatted with before.
3.	
Tap the plus sign in the upper-right corner of the screen to define a new 
FaceTime contact. A New Contact window appears, as shown in Figure 20-9.
4.	
Type a name and an iPhone phone number or email address associated with 
someone else’s FaceTime account and tap the Done button. Your saved 
name and FaceTime contact information appears.
5.	
Tap the iPhone number or email address to start a FaceTime videoconference. 
Your face appears as a thumbnail image in the corner of the screen while the 
other person’s face fills the screen, as shown in Figure 20-10.
6.	
(Optional) Tap the Mute or Switch Camera icons to shut off the volume or 
switch the view of your iPad from the front-facing to the back-facing camera.
7.	
Tap the End button when you want to stop your FaceTime videoconference.

Additional Ideas for Using the iPad’s 
Cameras
If you’re in a meeting or class, you can turn on the iPad’s camera to record notes 
jotted down on a chalkboard or whiteboard, or take pictures or video of a slide-
show presentation. 
If you like using videoconferencing but need to reach people who don’t 
have FaceTime, then you can use Skype instead. Skype works nearly the same as 
FaceTime, allowing you to make audio or video conferences with almost anyone. 
Best of all, Skype can run on a Windows or Linux PC, which you can’t call through 
FaceTime.
Finally, don’t forget that while the iPad’s cameras may not offer the sharpest 
resolution, they’re still available anywhere you take your iPad. If you get in a car 
accident, use your iPad to take pictures of the accident scene. If everyone takes 
their iPad with them everywhere they go, maybe one day we’ll finally get a decent 
picture of a UFO or Bigfoot that isn’t blurry or out of focus. 
Figure 20-10: The FaceTime screen lets you chat through video.

If you own a digital camera (or a mobile phone 
with a digital camera), you probably already 
have dozens of digital photographs scattered 
all over your computer.
To get photographs into your iPad, you’ll 
need to synchronize them using iTunes (see 
Chapter 15) or buy Apple’s optional camera con-
nection kit, which lets you plug a digital camera 
into an iPad through a USB port or through a 
Secure Digital (SD) card. No matter how you 
get your pictures into your iPad (or even if you 
just take photos with the iPad itself), you’ll be 
able to view and use them in different ways.
Remember, you aren’t just limited to storing 
digital photographs in your iPad. You can store 
any type of graphic image that’s in the JPEG, 
TIF, PNG, or GIF file format. That means you

can store artwork that someone has created using a program, such as Photoshop 
or Corel Painter or engineering drawings created by a computer-aided design 
(CAD) program.
In this chapter you will learn how to view pictures (digital photographs, 
graphic images, and so on) on your iPad.
What You’ll Be Using
To view and share pictures on your iPad, you need to use the following:
The Photos app
The Settings screen
Viewing Pictures
The Photos app provides several ways to view your pictures:
>
>
Photos  Lists every picture individually for you to choose
>
>
Albums  Groups pictures into categories
>
>
Events  Groups pictures based on the date they were captured
>
>
Faces  Organizes pictures based on the people in them
>
>
Places  Organizes pictures based on where they were taken
Q
Q Note: To take advantage of the Faces feature covered in this chapter, you’ll 
need to use iPhoto or Aperture (on a Macintosh) to tag pictures with each 
person’s face. If you’re using a Windows computer, you won’t be able to use 
the Faces feature. No matter what type of computer you use, you’ll be able 
to use the other features because most digital cameras capture the date a 
picture was taken and some of the newest ones can even identify the location 
where a picture was taken.
To see all the different ways of viewing your pictures, make sure you have 
loaded some pictures into your iPad, and then follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Photos. The Photos screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Photos tab at the top of the screen. Thumbnail images of all your 
pictures appear, as shown in Figure 21-1.
3.	
Tap any picture. Your chosen picture expands to fill the screen.
4.	
Tap the screen to display controls at the top and bottom of the screen, as 
shown in Figure 21-2. (After a few seconds, these controls automatically dis-
appear.) Notice the thumbnail images of pictures that appear at the bottom 
of the screen.

Navigating Through Pictures
Being able to find and view all the different ways your iPad has organized your pic-
tures is the first step to looking at them, but once you’ve chosen a particular way to 
find a picture (Photos, Albums, Events, Faces, or Places), you need to learn how to 
navigate your way through multiple pictures. To view your pictures, you can choose 
the following commands:
>
>
Tap  Selects a picture from a group of thumbnail images of multiple 
pictures
>
>
Swipe  Displays the next or previous picture in a group
>
>
Slide  Lets you scroll through multiple images quickly
To see how these three ways of navigating through groups of pictures work, 
follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Photos. The Photos screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Photos tab at the top of the screen. Thumbnail images of all your 
pictures appear (shown earlier in Figure 21-1).
3.	
Tap a picture to view it. Your chosen picture appears on the screen.
4.	
Swipe your finger left or right to see the next or previous picture.
5.	
Tap the screen to make thumbnail images of all the pictures appear at the 
bottom of the screen, as shown earlier in Figure 21-2.

Tap and hold any thumbnail image and slide your finger left or right to 
quickly scroll through your pictures. 
7.	
Lift your finger off the screen when you’ve found a picture you want to view.
Creating a Slideshow
Viewing pictures by yourself can be fun, but it may be more enjoyable to show your 
pictures to others. With your iPad, you can create a slideshow to display pictures 
one at a time, with various transitions between each picture or even background 
music.
You can create a slideshow in two ways. First, you can create a slideshow 
within the Photos app. This can be handy for showing off your latest vacation pic-
tures or pictures of your child’s birthday party.
A second way to create a slideshow is to turn your iPad into an electronic 
picture frame, which can display pictures when you’re not using your iPad, such as 
when you’ve put your iPad in a recharging dock.
Making a Slideshow Within the Photos App
Creating a slideshow within the Photo app can be handy for impromptu presenta-
tions. To create a slideshow, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Photos. The Photos screen appears.
2.	
Tap a tab at the top of the screen, such as Photos or Albums. If you choose 
the Photos tab, thumbnail images of all your pictures appear (shown earlier 
in Figure 21-1). Otherwise, different groups of your pictures appear, which 
you’ll need to tap to display all the pictures stored inside.
3.	
Tap Slideshow in the upper-right corner of 
the screen. A Slideshow Options window 
appears, as shown in Figure 21-5.
4.	
(Optional) Tap the Play Music on/off switch. 
If you turned the switch to read ON, tap the 
Music button to choose from a list of the 
songs you have stored in the iPod app.
5.	
Tap Transitions and then tap a transition, 
such as Cube or Ripple.
6.	
Tap Start Slideshow. Your slideshow starts 
playing using all the pictures stored in the 
group you selected earlier. The slideshow 
automatically ends after it has displayed all of 
your pictures or when you tap the screen.
Turning Your iPad into an Electronic Picture Frame
Apple sells an optional recharging dock where you can prop up your iPad in a 
base that holds it upright. If you have this optional dock or if you just like the idea 
of propping your iPad up while it’s plugged in, you can turn your iPad into an elec-
tronic picture frame and display pictures stored in the Photos app.

Additional Ideas for Using Your Pictures
With so many different types of pictures that you can store on your iPad—from 
digital photographs to artwork created or modified with programs such as Photo­
shop or Corel Painter—you can use your iPad as a portable picture frame or a stor-
age device before sending your pictures to others by email.
Taking, viewing, organizing, and sharing pictures may not be the only reason 
you got an iPad, but it’s one of many ways you can make your iPad more useful.

Since ideas can be so fleeting and precious, it’s 
important to capture them as quickly as pos-
sible. With your iPad, you can jot down ideas, 
notes, or entire letters and reports.
The iPad comes with a Notes app that mim-
ics a yellow notepad so you can type ideas for 
an upcoming project, a daily to-do list, or a 
rough draft of a report you need to write later. 
Once you’ve written some notes on your iPad, 
you can email them to yourself (or someone 
else).

What You’ll Be Using
To type and manage notes on your iPad, you need to use the following:
The Notes app
Typing a Note
Depending on how you hold your iPad (portrait or landscape mode), the Notes 
app either displays a single yellow notepad (portrait mode) or a yellow notepad 
on the right with a list of all your notes displayed on the left (landscape mode), 
as shown in Figure 22-1.
To type a note, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. If you haven’t created any notes yet, 
you’ll just see a blank yellow notepad screen.
2.	
Tap the position on the notepad where you want to place the cursor. A mag-
nifying glass appears, letting you precisely place the cursor by sliding your 
finger on the screen. (If you haven’t created any notes yet, just tap the note-
pad to place the cursor.) The virtual keyboard appears at the bottom of the 
screen.

Creating New Notes
The Notes app lets you store text on a single page, where each page represents 
another note.
To create new notes, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Tap the plus sign that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. A new 
blank page appears with the virtual keyboard at the bottom of the screen so 
you can start typing your new note.
Navigating Through Your Notes
Over time, you may wind up with dozens of notes. Since you may have created 
each note at different times, there won’t be any logical order to the way your notes 
are organized. To find a note, you can scroll through notes one at a time, jump to 
a specific note using the Notes window, or search for text that appears in specific 
notes.
To see all three methods of searching notes, make sure you have created a 
handful of notes, and then follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The 
Notes screen appears.
2.	
Tab the Previous or Next arrow icons 
at the bottom of the note, as shown in 
Figure 22-5. (If an arrow is dimmed, that 
means you’re viewing either the first or 
last note.) Another note appears with 
the animation of a real page flipping.
3.	
Tap a note that appears in the Notes window. (If you’re holding your iPad in 
portrait mode, you’ll need to tap the Notes button in the upper-left corner of 
the screen to see the Notes window, as shown earlier in Figure 22-3.)
4.	
Tap the Search field at the top of the Notes window. The virtual keyboard 
appears at the bottom of the screen.
5.	
Type a word or phrase that you know appears in one of your notes. The 
Notes window lists only those notes that contain that word or phrase.
6.	
Tap Clear (it looks like an X inside a gray circle at the far right of the Search 
field) to display all your notes in the Notes window again.
Sending a Note by Email
After you’ve written a note, you may want to send it to yourself or to someone else. 
To transfer a note out of your iPad, you can email it by following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Find a note that you want to send using any of the methods explained in the 
previous section.

Additional Ideas for Typing Notes
One of the simplest and most productive tools is to write down your goals for each 
day. Most people write their to-do list of goals on a piece of paper, but you can 
write them in the Notes app so you can constantly review them while you’re using 
your iPad.
Another handy use for the Notes app is to write drafts of email messages. 
By using the Notes app, you can store your draft and modify it over time. When 
you’re done writing, just email this note, and all your text automatically appears in 
the message text field of your email. As long as you have your iPad with you, you’ll 
always have a way to jot down notes at any time, anywhere.

the Trash icon displays a

Since the iPad is so small and light, you’ll probably 
wind up taking it with you almost everywhere 
you go. When you’re travelling, you’ll often need 
to look up someone’s address, phone number, 
or email address. Storing all this information 
on your computer is a start, but synchroniz-
ing this information to your iPad gives you the 
ability to search your list of contacts wherever 
you happen to be. (If you’ve already stored con-
tact information on your computer, such as in 
the Address Book program on a Macintosh or 
Microsoft Outlook on a Windows computer, 
you can transfer that data to your iPad as 
explained in Chapter 15.)
To store your valuable contact informa-
tion on your iPad, you’ll use the Contacts app. 
Besides storing text information, the Contacts

app can also include a picture of each person so you’ll remember what that person 
looks like. And if you want to email your friend or even find driving directions to his 
house or business, it’s just a click away.
What You’ll Be Using
To store and manage contact information on your iPad, you need to use the 
following:
The Contacts app
Viewing Contact Information
The Contacts app mimics a paper address book. The left side of the screen dis-
plays your list of names, and the right side shows a single person’s contact infor-
mation, as shown in Figure 23-1.
Besides displaying a list of names and more detailed information about a 
single person, the Contacts screen also displays various controls to help you find 
or do something with your contact information:
>
>
Index  Appears on the left side of the screen and lets you jump to any con-
tact by last name.

>
>
Share button  Lets you send the currently displayed contact information to 
someone by email.
To find a particular name stored in the Contacts app, you can scroll up and 
down your list of names. For a short list of names, this may be all you need, but if 
you have a long list of names, you can tap the index that appears along the left 
side of the screen. Just tap a letter, such as D or T, to find all last names that begin 
with D or T, respectively. You can even search your address book if you just know 
part of someone’s name.
To view your contact information, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Contacts. The Contacts screen appears, display-
ing the last name you viewed.
2.	
Scroll through your list of names on the left side of the screen. (You can flick 
your finger to scroll quickly or just slide your finger up or down slowly to 
scroll much slower.)
3.	
Tap a name. The information for your contact appears in the right side of the 
screen (shown in Figure 23-1).
4.	
Tap in the Search field. The virtual keyboard appears.
5.	
Type part of a name. As you type, a list of matching names appears.
6.	
Tap the name of the contact information you want to view.
Q
Q Note: If you have organized your contacts into groups using the Address 
Book program on a Macintosh, you can view those groups by tapping the 
red Groups button (it looks like a red ribbon bookmark) that appears in the 
upper-left corner of the screen.
Adding a New Contact
When you’re travelling with your iPad, you may meet someone and want to store 
that person’s information into the Contacts app. (Later you can synchronize this 
contact information with your computer as explained in Chapter 15.) To add a new 
contact, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Contacts. The Contacts screen appears.
2.	
Tap the plus sign that appears in the middle of the screen (look in the 
bottom-right corner of the left page). The New Contact window appears 
along with the virtual keyboard at the bottom of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 23-2.

3.	
Tap each text field where you want to add 
information (such as the First and Last text 
fields). You don’t need to fill in every text 
field. For example, you might only want to 
store a person’s name and email address 
but not a street address or home phone 
number.

Sending Contact Information by Email
Oftentimes you may have contact information about someone that you’d like to 
share with others. The simple way to do this is through email. Just pick the contact 
information you want to send, and your iPad attaches this contact information to 
an email message as a vCard (.vcf) file that practically every contact management 
program can import.
To email contact information, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Contacts. The Contacts screen appears.
2.	
Find a contact that you want to send.
3.	
Tap Share at the bottom middle of the screen. An email message and the 
virtual keyboard appear on the screen with your contact information stored 
as a vCard file, as shown in Figure 23-6.
4.	
Tap the To text field, and type an email address. (If you tap the plus sign 
at the far right of the To text field, you can pick a name stored in your 
Contacts app.)

Q
Q Note: You’ll learn all about maps and driving directions in Chapter 25.
Additional Ideas for Using Contacts
The Contacts app is just a simple database, so feel free to store any kind of text 
information in it, whether it’s information about your stamp collection or a list of 
celebrities you’d like to meet.
You can use the iPad to store emergency contact information, your software 
serial numbers, or just the hotel room numbers of your own room and those of 
your co-workers during your next business trip. Now when you need to reinstall a 
program or find the right room, just look in the Contacts app on your iPad.

By using the Calendar app on your iPad, you can 
organize your schedule and set appointments. 
To make sure you don’t forget an appointment, 
you can set an alarm to alert you.
Since you may be tracking appointments 
on both your computer and your iPad, you may 
need to synchronize all your appointments as 
explained in Chapter 15. By doing this, you can 
make, edit, and delete appointments on either 
your computer or iPad and then synchronize 
this information with both devices.
If you’re using Gmail and Google’s online 
calendar service (or another online mail and cal-
endar service, such as Yahoo!), you can sync your 
calendar when you set up your email account 
(see Chapter 13).

Searching for an Appointment
You may have set an appointment and suddenly can’t remember what date you 
assigned it. Rather than waste time scanning your appointments, you can search 
for it by typing a word or phrase that is part of your appointment, such as the loca-
tion or name of the appointment.
To search for an appointment, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Calendar. The Calendar screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Search field that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. 
A virtual keyboard appears.
3.	
Type a word or phrase that appears in the appointment that you want to 
find. As you type, a Results window appears, listing all appointments that 
currently match what you typed (even if it’s just one letter), as shown in 
Figure 24-7.

Additional Ideas for Using Calendars
Calendars can help keep your life organized (just as long as you take your iPad 
with you so you can see your calendars). If you’re trying to achieve a goal, such as 
losing weight or giving up smoking, set a repetitive appointment with words of 
encouragement.
Since you can store appointments far into the future, take a moment now 
to set an alert for important dates, such as upcoming anniversaries, birthdays, or 
other events that you can’t afford to forget. Now your iPad can help make you look 
like a genius when you remember all those birthdays of loved ones.

Maps can be fun to study just to see unusual 
locations. However, most people will likely use 
a map to help them find their way around. If 
you’re in an unfamiliar area, just load the Maps 
app, find your current location, and then fig-
ure out how to get back to a freeway or which 
roads you need to take to head in a certain 
direction.

Viewing a Map
Unlike a paper map, the Maps app can show you a dynamic map that can change, 
move, or expand so you can see finer details or zoom out to see a larger overview 
of a particular area.
Besides showing you a map, the Maps screen also displays various controls 
around the screen to help you use the Maps app, as shown in Figure 25-1.

3.	
Press your finger on the map screen and slide it around. The map moves so 
you can see other parts of the map. By scrolling, you essentially have an end-
less map.
Changing the Appearance of a Map
Depending on how you like looking at maps, you can change a map’s appearance 
in one of four ways:
>
>
Classic  Displays the map as a graphic image
>
>
Satellite  Displays an actual photograph of an area
>
>
Hybrid  Displays an actual photograph with cartoon streets drawn over it
>
>
Terrain  Displays a graphic map with elevation levels included
To see the four different ways to display a map, follow these steps:
1.	
While using Maps, tap the gray area in the bottom-right corner of the screen 
where the corner of the map looks like it’s folded back. A list of map appear-
ance options appears, as shown in Figure 25-2.
2.	
Change your map’s appearance by tapping Classic, Satellite, Hybrid, or 
Terrain. The map now displays its new look, as shown in Figure 25-3.

Finding Your Current Location
Every map is useless if you can’t find where you are. That’s why shopping center 
maps always have a big “You Are Here” arrow. To identify your current location, 
your iPad needs an Internet connection.
To find your current location on a map, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Location icon. Your current location appears as a blue dot and a 
circle, as shown in Figure 25-4.
Using the Compass
A map can be handy to help you find your way around, but if you don’t know which 
direction you’re facing, you may not know whether you’re heading the right way. To 
help you find your direction, the Maps app offers a compass.
To use the compass, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Current Location icon twice. A compass appears in the upper-
right corner, as shown in Figure 25-5. (Note how the Current Location icon 
changes when you turn on the compass.)
Figure 25-4: A blue dot identifies your current location on the map.

208	 |	
Chapter 25
3.	
Rotate the iPad. The compass shows you the direction of north, while a trian-
gular area on the blue dot shows which direction you’re currently facing. Try 
moving your iPad around—notice that as you change directions, the iPad’s 
indicator moves with you.
4.	
Tap the Current Location icon once to make the compass disappear. You 
can also just drag the map.
Finding Places on a Map
Sometimes you know exactly where you want to go. Other times you may be 
searching for something you need, such as the nearest pizza restaurant, gas sta-
tion, supermarket, or coffeehouse. Whether you want to find a specific address or 
need to find a certain kind of place, your iPad can show you the way.
Searching for an Address
If you know the exact address you want to find, you can locate it on your iPad by 
following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Search tab in the upper-left corner of the screen. (It may already be 
selected.)
3.	
Tap the Search field in the upper-right corner of the screen. The virtual key-
board appears at the bottom of the screen.
4.	
Type an address and city. Then tap the Search key on the virtual keyboard. 
The map displays a red pin to identify the address, as shown in Figure 25-6.

matically when you tap the Search field. You 
can clear this list by tapping the Clear button 
in the upper-left corner of the Recents window.
Searching for Types of Places
If you’re looking for pizza or a supermarket, the Maps app is smart enough to fig-
ure out what you want and display multiple pins identifying locations of businesses 
that match your search. You can also use the Search feature to find particular cities, 
towns, and even well-known landmarks like the Empire State Building or Golden 
Gate Park.

Bookmarking Favorite Locations
When you find a location on a map, you can bookmark it. That way, if you find a 
great restaurant, bookstore, or bar that you know you’ll want to return to, you can 
save this location for future use or send an email message to a friend so they’ll be 
able to find that place too.
Saving or Sharing a Location
To save a location or email it to a friend, follow these steps:
1.	
Search for a location using one of the instructions in “Finding Places on a 
Map” on page 208. Your chosen location appears on the map, marked by a 
red pin.
2.	
Tap the Information icon that appears (it 
looks like a white lowercase i in a blue circle). 
A window pops up, listing information about 
that location, as shown in Figure 25-10.
3.	
(Optional) Tap Add to Bookmarks. The Add 
Bookmark window appears. Type or edit a 
descriptive name, and tap Save.

Done button. If you tap Add to Existing Con-
tact, you’ll need to pick a name in your Con-
tacts list to store the location information.
5.	
(Optional) Tap Share Location. A new email 
message appears, with the contact informa-
tion attached. 
Placing Your Own Bookmark
Rather than look for an address or place and then create a bookmark, the Maps 
app also gives you the option of placing a purple pin on a map to identify any loca-
tion you want. This can be handy for identifying a particular area without caring 
what that street address might be.
To place a bookmark on a map, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears.
2.	
Tap the gray corner in the lower-right corner of the screen. A list of options 
appears, as shown in Figure 25-11.

need to retype this address into the Maps app to find its location. Instead, you can 
just tap that person’s name, and the Maps app will find that location for you.
To see how to find an address from the Contacts app, make sure you have 
stored someone’s street address, and then follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Bookmark icon. A window appears.
3.	
Tap Contacts at the bottom of this window. Your list of Contacts appears.
4.	
Tap a name. The map displays a red pin identifying the location of the 
address stored with that name. (If you choose a name that doesn’t have a 
street address stored with it, you’ll see a “No Street Addresses” message.)

Getting Directions
Many times you want to know where you are and the shortest route to get to your 
destination. Not only can your iPad show you the fastest driving directions, but it 
can also show you public transportation options or directions for walking. All you 
need to know is your current location and your destination.
Getting Directions to a Specific Address
If you know a specific address that you want to go to, you can type that address 
into the Maps app and get driving, mass transit, or walking directions to your des-
tination by following these steps:

From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears.
2.	
Tap the Bookmarks icon, tap Contacts at the bottom of the window, and 
tap a name. Or tap the Search field, and type a business that you want to 
find, such as supermarket or gas. A red pin appears on the map, along with 
the name of a person or business, and the blue Information icon. Tap the 
Information icon.

Tap Directions To Here. A blue bar appears at the bottom of the map, let-
ting you choose driving, mass transit, or walking directions. Tap one of these 
choices, and tap Start.
Additional Ideas for Finding Places and 
Getting Directions with Maps
Before you go to a location that you’ve never been to, locate it on the Maps app, 
and then look at its picture so you can see the surrounding area. If you’re looking 
for something to eat, just type in the food you want in the Maps search field, such 
as pizza, Thai food, or seafood. When you see all the nearby restaurants, just tap 
on a name, get directions (driving, mass transit, or walking), and find a new restau-
rant where you can enjoy your meal.
The Maps app acts like an interactive guide to help you find your location 
and find nearby businesses. If you travel often, take your iPad, and you may never 
be lost again (unless you lose your iPad).

If you want to find an app, a song, a video, an 
email message, or another item stored on your 
iPad, you have two choices. You could manu-
ally search your iPad, which takes time and still 
doesn’t guarantee that you’ll find what you want. 
A much faster and more accurate method is to 
search your iPad using Spotlight.
In this chapter you will learn how to use 
Spotlight to search for apps, songs, videos, 
and email messages on your iPad.

What You’ll Be Using
To search for apps and other items, you need to use the following:

>
Spotlight
The Settings screen
Searching with Spotlight
Spotlight is a special feature that acts like a search engine on your iPad. Just type 
all or part of a word, and Spotlight tries to find an item that matches your search 
criteria. By default, Spotlight will search through your Apps, Audiobooks, Calendar 
appointments, Contacts, Mail messages, Music, Notes, Podcasts, and Videos.
To search for any of these items, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, swipe your finger from left to right. The Spotlight 
screen appears with a Search iPad field at the top and the virtual keyboard 
at the bottom, as shown in Figure 26-1. (You can also get to the Spotlight 
search page by pressing the Home button when you’re at the Home screen.)
Figure 26-1: The Spotlight screen appears when you swipe the Home 
screen to the right.

	
Searching Your iPad with Spotlight

2.	
Tap the Search iPad field, and type part of the word that represents what 
you want to find. For example, if you want to find a name stored in your Con-
tacts app, type that name. If you want to find a note in the Notes app that 
contains certain information, such as your grocery list, type a word that you 
know appears on that note, such as milk or eggs. As you type each ­letter, 
Spotlight displays the items that match your search criteria, as shown in 
Figure 26-2.
3.	
Tap the item you want, such as a song, an app, or a note. Your iPad displays 
or plays your chosen item.
Customizing Spotlight
You can also customize the order that Spotlight searches for things. If email mes-
sages are more important to you than audiobooks, tell Spotlight to search through 
your email messages first and not bother searching for audiobooks until you’ve 
searched for everything else.
To customize Spotlight, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Spotlight Search. The Spotlight Search settings screen appears, as 
shown in Figure 26-3.
4.	
Tap any item, such as Music, Podcasts, or Mail. Spotlight will search for any 
item with a check mark next to it and ignore any items that do not have a 
check mark next to them.
Figure 26-2: As you type, Spotlight displays items that match your 
search criteria.

Chapter 26
5.	
Place your fingertip over the three horizontal lines at the far right of an item, 
and slide your finger up or down. This lets you rearrange the order that Spot-
light searches for items, starting from the top.
6.	
Press the Home button. The Home screen appears. Try your search again, 
and see the results!
Additional Ideas for Searching with 
Spotlight
If you collect dozens of apps, trying to find the one app you want can involve swip-
ing through multiple panes of the Home screen. For a faster method, just swipe to 
reveal the Spotlight screen, and type the name of the app you want to run.
If you store notes in the Notes app, give each note a descriptive heading. 
Not only will this help you organize your notes within the Notes app, but it will also 
make it easier for Spotlight to find your note again if you can remember to search 
for that heading (such as “To-Do” or “Daily Goals”).
With Spotlight on your iPad, you can quickly search for anything you’ve 
stored so you don’t have to worry where you put it. As long as you know what you 
called it, you’ll be able to find it again courtesy of Spotlight.
Figure 26-3: The Spotlight Search settings screen lists the order of 
items to search.

Additional Tips

Using the iPad is a totally different experience 
from using an ordinary computer because you 
don’t have a physical keyboard or a mouse to 
point to the screen. You may find the touch 
interface even easier to use than a traditional 
keyboard and mouse. Plus you can use some 
built-in features to make your iPad even more 
accessible.
The iPad can invert its color scheme so that 
text appears in high-contrast white on black. 
Also, your iPad can make it easy to zoom in on 
the screen to quickly enlarge images and text.
The iPad can also use a synthesized voice to 
read the various text, buttons, and controls on 
the screen. As you slide your fingers over the 
screen, your iPad will read whatever your finger 
is touching, so you’ll know whether it’s a button 
you want to press.

If you are deaf or hard of hearing, you may want to turn on closed captioning 
when you watch videos. You can also switch the audio to mono (rather than stereo), 
which can be easier to hear if your hearing is better in one ear than the other.
What You’ll Be Using
To change your iPad’s accessibility settings, you need to use the following:
The Settings screen
Improving the Visual Quality of the Screen
To make the iPad’s screen more readable, you can turn on “White on Black” or 
Zoom features. These two features are independent—you can use them together 
or separately.
Turning on the White on Black setting will render most text in white against a 
black background—as well as inverting all other colors on your iPad.
Turning on the Zoom feature lets you use three fingers to zoom the screen 
in and out so you can read the screen more easily. To enable the accessibility fea-
tures, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Accessibility. The Accessibility settings screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 27-1.

Tap the Zoom on/off switch. Note the instructions on the page.
6.	
Tap the Accessibility button to return to the Accessibility settings screen 
(see Figure 27-1).
7.	
Tap Large Text. A screen appears, listing different text sizes, as shown in 
Figure 27-2.
8.	
Tap a text size and then tap the Accessibility button to return to the Acces-
sibility settings screen.
9.	
Tap the White on Black on/off switch. When turned on, the screen displays 
white text on a black background.
Turning On VoiceOver
You can also turn on the VoiceOver feature, which makes your iPad read whatever 
is on the screen as you touch it with your fingers. By touching the screen and hear-
ing where your fingers are, you can control your iPad.
Q
Q Note: Because Zoom and VoiceOver use the same set of shortcuts, you can 
enable only one or the other at a time.
To turn on the VoiceOver feature, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Accessibility. The Accessibility settings screen appears (shown earlier in 
Figure 27-1).

Chapter 27
Q
Q Note: Enabling this setting does more than just read the iPad’s screen aloud—
it actually changes iPad’s behavior. Instead of single-tapping to open apps, 
press buttons, and toggle switches, you’ll need to double-tap. You’ll also 
need to double-tap to type. Instead of scrolling with one finger, you’ll need 
to scroll with three fingers. This is because the usual single tap will activate 
VoiceOver rather than the screen element.
6.	
(Optional) Tap the Speak Hints on/off switch. Speak Hints provides a bit of 
context with each selection—for example, when you single-tap an app on 
the Home screen, your iPad will read its name aloud and say, “Double-tap 
to open.”
7.	
(Optional) Slide the Speaking Rate slider to make the iPad’s synthesized 
voice speak faster or slower.
8.	
(Optional) Tap Typing Feedback to display the Typing Feedback settings 
screen, which lets you define whether the iPad should give you audio feed-
back after each character, entire words, or both. Tap an option, and then tap 
the VoiceOver back button to view the VoiceOver screen again.
9.	
(Optional) Tap the Use Phonetics on/off switch to make your iPad pro-
nounce words on the screen phonetically.
Figure 27-3: The VoiceOver settings screen lets you define how your 
iPad can read its controls to you.

(Optional) Scroll down and tap Braille to allow your iPad to connect via Blue-
tooth to a Braille device.
12.	
(Optional) Tap the Web Rotor, Language Rotor, or Include in Rotor on/off 
switches to modify the rotor, which lets you use a two-finger rotation gesture 
to quickly move through text displayed on the screen.
13.	
Press the Home button. The Home screen appears again.
Turning On Closed Captioning and Mono 
Audio
Closed captioning lets you read what people in a video say. This can be handy 
if you are deaf or hard of hearing, or for watching a video in a noisy environment 
where you might not be able to hear the sound coming out of your iPad’s speakers 
very well. To turn on closed captioning, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Video. The Video settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap the Closed Captioning on/off switch.
4.	
Press the Home button.
For clearer audio, you might also want to try the Mono Audio setting. Just 
tap Settings from the home screen, tap General, tap Accessibility, and finally tap 
the Mono Audio on/off button.
Turning Accessibility Features On and Off 
Rapidly
Going through the Settings screen every time you want to turn an accessibility 
feature on or off can be tedious, so to simplify this process, you can access these 
features by triple-clicking the Home button. This gives you the option of turning on 
(or off) VoiceOver or the White on Black feature.
If you prefer, you can also make triple-clicking the Home button display a list 
of options so you can turn different accessibility features on or off. To define triple-
clicking the Home button, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Accessibility. The Accessibility settings screen appears (shown earlier in 
Figure 27-1).
4.	
Tap Triple-click Home. The Home settings screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 27-4.

5.	
Tap an option, such as Toggle VoiceOver. If you choose Ask, triple-clicking 
the Home button displays a dialog that gives you a choice of which accessi-
bility features to turn on or off.
6.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
Additional Ideas for Making Your iPad 
Accessible
The iPad’s accessibility options can be great for anyone, so give them a try. You 
may find that you prefer reading white-on-black text or like closed captioning on 
videos to make them easier to watch. You can even use the FaceTime app (see 
Chapter 20) to communicate in sign language, giving you yet another way to chat 
through your iPad. With so many different tools for controlling an iPad, you just 
need to think about what you want to do with it next and modify your iPad to make 
it easy for you to use.

Most physical keyboards are designed for a 
particular language, such as English, French, 
Russian, and so on. To type in another ­language 
with a physical keyboard, you often have to 
switch to a completely different keyboard or 
rely on odd keystroke combinations to type the 
characters you really want.
Fortunately, on the iPad, the virtual keyboard 
lets you switch between multiple languages 
quickly and easily. One moment you can be typ-
ing in French, the next in Russian, and the next 
in Chinese or Japanese. If you need to type in 
foreign languages on a regular basis, you’ll be 
pleased to know that the iPad will likely accom-
modate the languages you need.
Using Foreign 
Languages

Chapter 28
What You’ll Be Using
To type in a foreign language, you need to use the following:
The Settings screen
Switching the iPad’s Default Language
Depending on where you bought your iPad, it will start out with an initial default 
language, such as English or French. If you move to another country, sell your iPad 
to someone in another country, or just want to practice your foreign-language 
skills, you can switch to a different language and make everything appear in that 
language.
To choose a different default language, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap International. The International settings screen appears.
4.

Defining a Foreign-Language Virtual 
Keyboard
If you need to type in a second language, your iPad lets you switch to virtual key-
boards for different languages at the tap of a key. That way, you can type in Eng-
lish, switch temporarily to French, Spanish, or Chinese, and then switch back again 
to English.
Before you can type on a foreign-language keyboard, you have to define 
which foreign language to use. To define a foreign-language keyboard, follow 
these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Tap Keyboard. The Keyboard settings screen appears.
4.	
Tap International Keyboards. The screen displays all the available virtual 
keyboards on your iPad. Initially, it will display only the default language.
5.	
Tap Add New Keyboard. The Add New Keyboard screen appears, as shown 
in Figure 28-3.
6.	
Tap a foreign language. You’ll return to the Keyboards page. You can follow 
the same steps to add another language.

Using a Foreign-Language Virtual Keyboard
After you have defined one or more foreign-language virtual keyboards, you can 
switch to that foreign-language keyboard any time the virtual keyboard pops up, 
such as when typing an email message or a note in the Notes app.
To use a foreign-language keyboard, follow these steps:
1.	
Run an app that displays the virtual keyboard, such as the Notes app.
2.	
Tap the International key (it looks like a globe) that appears next to the 
spacebar. One of your foreign-language virtual keyboards appears, as shown 
in Figure 28-4.
3.	
Type something, and when you’re ready to switch to another language, tap 
the International key again until the keyboard you want appears.
Q
Q Note: The virtual keyboard also includes a Chinese character recognition 
keyboard that lets you draw a character. Then the keyboard displays a list 
of similar characters so you can tap the one you want to type, as shown in

Additional Ideas for Using Foreign 
Languages on Your iPad
Anyone learning a foreign language can switch to their foreign-language keyboard 
and start typing in that particular language. 
If you have children, teach them the basics of typing in a foreign language. 
Typing foreign words is often more fun than writing them by hand, so this gives you 
a chance to turn your iPad into a simple foreign-language tutor for yourself or for 
others. 
If you regularly travel to different parts of the world, or just live in a neighbor-
hood where people often speak multiple languages, experiment with different 
foreign-language options so you can use your iPad no matter where you might be.

What makes the iPad so versatile isn’t just its 
interface or touch screen but its ability to run 
apps to make your iPad do practically anything. 
Although it’s possible to use your iPad with-
out installing a single extra app, half the fun of 
having an iPad is downloading and using the 
thousands of apps available in the App Store 
(see Chapter 10 for more information about 
downloading apps from the App Store).
Surprisingly, some of the best apps are free, 
and others are far less expensive than compara-
ble software for desktop or laptop computers. 
Whether you decide to buy apps or just down-
load the free ones, you’ll find plenty of software 
to expand the versatility of your iPad in ways 
that may surprise you.
In this chapter you will learn which types of 
free and commercial apps might be most use-
ful to download and install on your iPad.

What You’ll Be Using
To browse and download apps, you need to use the following:
>
>
An Internet connection  
(Wi-Fi or 3G)
The App Store
Office Productivity Apps
To work with word processor documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, you 
need an office suite for your iPad. While the iPad doesn’t come with an office suite, 
you can buy several inexpensive apps that can turn your iPad into a replacement 
for a laptop.
Pages, Numbers, and Keynote
The most popular iPad office suite is Apple’s own iWork, which consists of Pages, 
Numbers, and Keynote (shown in Figure 29-1). The three apps are sold individually, 
so you can pick the ones you need and skip the others.
If you use iWork on a Macintosh, you can transfer files between your Mac 
and iPad without converting file formats. If you use Microsoft Office files, you can 
open and edit them in iWork on your iPad, then transfer them back to your com-
puter again.
Figure 29-1: Keynote is just one app that’s part of the iWork office 
suite.

Documents To Go and QuickOffice
If you don’t use iWork and rely more on Microsoft Office files, you can use Docu-
ments To Go to create and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. For added con-
venience, Documents To Go can store and retrieve files from cloud services, such 
as iDisk, Dropbox, and Google Docs. This lets you access your files as long as you 
have an Internet connection.
Another solution for creating and editing Microsoft Office files is Quick­
Office. Like Documents To Go, QuickOffice can create and edit Microsoft Word 
and Excel files, as shown in Figure 29-2. However, at the time of this writing, Quick-
Office can only view but not edit a PowerPoint presentation, so if editing presenta-
tions is something you need on a regular basis, check the latest version to find out 
if it can create and edit PowerPoint presentations.
Bento and FileMaker Go
The Contacts app that comes with the iPad is great for storing names, addresses, 
and phone numbers but not so flexible if you need to store other types of informa-
tion. For those who need a more versatile database, grab a copy of Bento. If you 
have Bento on your Macintosh, you can share databases, but even if you just get 
Bento for the iPad, you can create custom databases for storing any type of infor-
mation you might need.
Figure 29-2: QuickOffice makes it easy to edit and create Word and 
Excel files.

238	 |	
Chapter 29
For a more sophisticated database, get FileMaker Go. Not only can you 
develop databases directly on your iPad with FileMaker Go, but you can also use 
a Wi-Fi or Internet connection to remotely access FileMaker databases on your 
desktop computer. This gives you the ability to view and edit your database’s data 
without storing it on your iPad.
Evernote, Simplenote, AudioNote, and PaperDesk
The Notes app that comes with the iPad can be handy for typing notes, but to syn-
chronize your notes with your computer or an online storage site, you might want 
to use Evernote or Simplenote instead to make sure you never lose an idea.
If you need to store notes and record audio at the same time, then consider 
AudioNote. This feature can be especially useful when recording lectures so you 
can hear playback of exactly what was spoken while you review your typed notes. 
PaperDesk lets you type notes, record audio, and draw and save pictures 
in your notes, as shown in Figure 29-3. One unique feature of PaperDesk is that if 
you tap a word that you’ve typed, PaperDesk will jump to the specific location in 
the audio recording when you typed that word so you can replay exactly what you 
heard when you jotted down a particular note. 
Offline Pages
No matter which type of iPad you have (Wi-Fi only model or Wi-Fi and 3G model), 
you may occasionally find yourself in places without Internet access, such as on an 
airplane. To prepare for times without Internet access, use Offline Pages to store 
copies of your favorite web pages (when you do have Internet access) so you can 
view these pages later (when you don’t have Internet access).
Figure 29-3: PaperDesk lets you sketch and type notes.

PCalc Lite
If you’re familiar with the iPhone, you 
know that it comes with a free calcula-
tor app. Oddly enough, the iPad lacks 
this simple calculator app, so grab a 
free copy of PCalc Lite, which gives 
you a full-blown scientific calculator, 
as shown in Figure 29-4. Plenty of free 
alternative calculators are available in 
the App Store as well—just search for 
them!
Air Display
Need a little extra real estate while working on your desktop or laptop computer? 
The Air Display app lets you wirelessly turn your iPad into a second monitor. That 
way you can prop your iPad next to your computer and see more without the has-
sle of buying or connecting a second monitor.
News and Information
The simplest way to get the latest news is to load Safari and visit your favorite news 
websites. However, it’s often easier to use a special app that retrieves the type of 
news that you want.
ABC News, AP News, BBC News, Fox News, NPR News, and 
Reuters News Pro
Many of the top news sites provide their own unique (and free) apps specially 
designed for retrieving and displaying news on an iPad. By using one of these free 
apps with an Internet connection through your iPad, you can read world, sports, 
and financial news, as shown in Figure 29-5.
The Weather Channel
If you want to know the local forecast, tap into the Weather Channel app. Not 
only can you see the forecast, but you can also view maps, track storms heading 
through your area, and watch videos of weather occurring in your area and other 
parts of the world, as shown in Figure 29-6.
Bloomberg for the iPad and NASDAQ QFolio
If you invest in the stock market, you may be interested in tracking your stock 
portfolio and keeping up with the latest financial news. (Naturally, this requires an 
Internet connection.) Both the Bloomberg and NASDAQ QFolio apps provide a list 
of the latest financial news headlines along with a list of your stocks so you can see 
how they’re doing throughout the day.

iPad a calculator app.

Painting and Drawing Apps
The iPad’s touch screen surface and portability make it a perfect canvas for creat-
ing anything from simple drawings to complete works of art. Get an optional stylus 
or just use your finger to create paintings and drawings that rival anything you could 
create on a computer using a dedicated graphics program, such as Photoshop or 
Corel Painter.
SketchBook Pro
For serious artists, grab a copy of 
Autodesk’s SketchBook Pro. It includes 
Layers, Brushes, and other advanced 
features graphic artists will be familiar 
with. Based on the computer version 
of SketchBook Pro, this app essentially 
turns the surface of your iPad into a 
canvas for drawing or painting with 
your finger, as shown in Figure 29-7.
Doodle Buddy
For kids or anyone who just enjoys 
creating simple drawings, get a free 
copy of Doodle Buddy. Besides letting 
you draw and paint by mimicking chalk 
or paintbrushes, this app also includes 
pre-drawn images that you can paste 
into your creations so you can create 
interesting pictures even if you aren’t 
much of an artist yourself.
Adobe Photoshop Express
While some people are capable of creating a picture from scratch, others prefer 
taking a real picture and modifying it. On a computer, you can use a program like 
Photoshop, but on an iPad, you can use a similar program from Adobe called Pho-
toshop Express.
With Photoshop Express, you can modify digital images and turn them into 
art or just draw mustaches on people you don’t like or scribble funny pictures on 
images just to keep yourself amused while waiting in line at a bank or airport (see 
Figure 29-8).
Figure 29-7: SketchBook Pro turns 
the iPad into an artistic canvas.

Entertainment Apps
Most people don’t get a computer to balance their budget or write business 
reports. Instead, most people really get a computer to play games and have fun. 
While you can use your iPad exclusively for business, you can easily turn your iPad 
into an entertainment center to watch videos, listen to Internet radio stations, or 
read the latest classics or best sellers.
iBooks, Kindle, and NOOK
iBooks, Apple’s free reading app, gives you access to the iBookstore and lets 
you organize and read your ebooks. If you have a Kindle, download a free copy 
of the Kindle app so you can read all your Kindle ebooks on either your Kindle or 
your iPad.
For another alternative to Apple’s iBookstore, download a free copy of the 
Barnes & Noble NOOK app. Just like the iBooks and Kindle apps, the NOOK app 
organizes your ebooks and lets you shop online for more books. With so many 
options for reading ebooks on your iPad, you can choose what you like best.
Figure 29-8: With Photoshop Express, you can use your iPad to add 
artistic effects to your photos.

Netflix
If you subscribe to Netflix, download this free app, and you can watch streaming 
video directly on your iPad. Now you can watch movies or TV shows at your conve-
nience without waiting for the mail to arrive.
ABC Player
Watching movies through Netflix can be nice, but if you want to watch your favorite 
ABC TV shows, then get the ABC Player app for free. With this app you can see 
what’s playing or stream episodes of your favorite shows and watch them on your 
iPad, as shown in Figure 29-9.
JamPad and Virtuoso
One way to keep yourself amused with your iPad is to sing along while listening to 
the songs you’ve stored on your iPad. Another way to amuse yourself with music 
is to create your own songs. Although it’s not always practical to carry around an 
electronic keyboard, it is possible to turn your iPad into a musical instrument with 
JamPad or Virtuoso, as shown in Figure 29-10.
Figure 29-9: The ABC Player app lets you watch your favorite ABC 
shows on your iPad.

244	 |	
Chapter 29
Virtuoso can help you learn the notes on a keyboard while JamPad lets you 
play keyboards, guitar, or drums to develop your music skills, or just play sounds 
to keep yourself or your kids amused on a long car ride or plane trip. If the racket 
gets too annoying for others to hear, bring headphones or ear buds to restrict the 
noise you make to your own eardrums.
Remote
While you’re at home, you may prefer to play your music collection from your PC 
or Mac computer. The free Remote app lets you use your iPad to control iTunes on 
your computer from any room in the house—your iPad and computer just need to 
be on the same Wi-Fi network. 
Pandora
No matter how large your music collection may get, chances are good you’ll want 
to listen to something different. To help you find songs from different artists that 
you might enjoy, download the Pandora app.
Pandora lets you type in the name of your favorite recording artist or song, 
and then it plays only those songs that are similar to your chosen artist or song. By 
doing this, Pandora can help you discover new recording artists and songs that you 
might never have heard before.
Figure 29-10: Virtuoso can teach you the notes so you can practice 
your keyboard skills.

iMovie and GarageBand
For aspiring movie makers and musicians, two of the best apps are iMovie and 
GarageBand. With iMovie, you can edit any video footage you capture through 
the iPad’s cameras. This lets you capture a video from your iPad’s camera, and 
then edit it to create a more polished video clip that you can share with others or 
upload to a video sharing site like YouTube.  
GarageBand lets you turn your iPad into different musical instruments, such 
as drums or a keyboard, and then record your music, turning your iPad into a por-
table recording studio. Whether you’re just learning to play an instrument or have 
years of experience, GarageBand can turn your iPad into an indispensable tool to 
further your musical aspirations. 
Flipboard
The Flipboard app takes your favorite news sites, blogs, or social networking sites 
and turns them into an attractive digital “newspaper,” as shown in Figure 29-11.
Figure 29-11: You can also use Flipboard to read 
Facebook or Twitter.

Games
The iPad has hundreds of small, cheap, and fun games perfectly suited for wasting 
your time. The App Store lists today’s best sellers, and most games have free trials. 
If you’re looking to try your very first iPad game, you 
should try Angry Birds, a simple and addictive physics 
game with more than 100 million total downloads. 
You can compare high scores with your friends 
and family by creating an account in the iPad’s Game 
Center app. 
Annoyed by the Game Center notification (shown 
in Figure 29-12) while playing games? You can turn off 
Game Center notifications (and any other notifications 
that might bother you) in the Notifications pane of the 
Settings screen.
Additional Ideas for Using Apps
Every day new apps arrive in the App Store, so the possibilities for your iPad con-
tinue to grow. If you still can’t find an app that does what you need, you can always 
learn to program, create, and possibly make money distributing your own app for 
others to download and enjoy.
The key to the iPad’s versatility is its software. No matter how old your iPad 
may get, it need never become obsolete as long as you can keep loading it up 
with apps that let you use your iPad in new and unexpected ways. Put your most 
crucial apps on your main Home screen, put the apps that your children play with 
on a different pane, and put your own entertainment apps on yet another screen.
Now with the swipe of your finger, you can convert your iPad into a business 
productivity tool, an entertainment center, a children’s play toy, or anything else 
you want. All you need are the right apps.

Although the iPad is trouble free 99 percent of 
the time, it’s still a computer, and like any com-
puter, it’s prone to foul-ups and mishaps. When 
your iPad doesn’t cooperate with your wishes, 
you could have a defective iPad or, more likely, 
your iPad just needs a swift kick in its electronic 
behind to make it start working again.
In this chapter you will learn several steps 
you can take to get an uncooperative iPad back 
in working condition again.
Troubleshooting 
Your iPad

What You’ll Be Using
To troubleshoot your iPad, you need to use the following:
>
>
The Home button
The Settings screen
>
>
The On/Off button
iTunes on your computer
>
>
The iPad’s USB cable
An App Is Frozen
It’s rare, but sometimes the iPad seems to freeze when you’re running an app, 
and your iPad’s screen becomes unresponsive to your touch. The fix is quite 
­simple—just press the Home button and you’ll quit the app. If the app doesn’t 
quit, try pressing and holding the Home button for five to ten seconds. If the 
program continues to misbehave after you restart it, you may want to check for 
updates to the app or even uninstall it. Updating and uninstalling apps are cov-
ered in Chapter 10.
Your iPad Runs Sluggishly or Freezes
If you’re familiar with the old world of computers, you know that one of the simplest, 
yet mysterious, solutions to fixing a broken computer is to turn it off and turn it 
on again. On Windows PCs, you can accomplish this task by pressing the magical 
ctrl-alt-del keystroke combination, but with the iPad, you can duplicate this reset 
process by simply turning your iPad off, waiting a minute or two, then turning it 
back on.
The process of turning a computer off and back on clears its memory of any 
misbehaving programs that may have somehow managed to foul up your com-
puter. Sometimes a poorly written app can mess with your iPad’s memory, prevent-
ing other apps from running correctly. If an iPad app seems frozen, unresponsive, 
or sluggish, you may need to restart your iPad.
To restart your iPad, follow these steps:
1.	
Hold down the On/Off button and Home button at the same time. After a 
few seconds, the red slider appears at the top of the screen, and then the 
screen should flash off and your iPad should shut down.
2.	
Release both the On/Off button and Home button.
3.	
Wait a bit.
4.	
Press the On/Off button to turn your iPad back on.
5.	
(Optional) If that doesn’t do the trick, try restoring your iPad (see “Restoring 
Your iPad” on page 250).

iTunes Won’t Recognize Your iPad
To transfer files back and forth between an iPad and a computer, you must 
use iTunes. However, sometimes you may connect your iPad to your computer 
and iTunes won’t recognize that it’s connected, which means you can’t transfer 
any files.
To fix this problem, you have several alternatives:
>
>
Unplug your iPad’s USB cable from the computer and plug it back into the 
computer, using the same USB port or trying a different USB port. Plug it 
directly into the computer’s USB port and not in a USB port on a hub. Also 
try unplugging other devices plugged into USB ports.
>
>
Keep the iPad plugged into your computer and restart your computer.
>
>
Choose iTunes4Check for Updates (Macintosh) or Help4Check for 
Updates (Windows) to download and install the latest version of iTunes.
>
>
Make sure you have the latest operating system version for your computer 
(Mac OS X or Windows).
Your iPad Cannot Access the Internet
If you’re trying to get on the Internet but can’t seem to connect, there could be a 
multitude of problems that may not be related to your iPad at all, whether you’re 
trying to connect using Wi-Fi or a cellular telephone network. First, you could be in 
a “dead zone” for Wi-Fi or cellular telephone connectivity, which could be caused 
by buildings or poor coverage in your particular area.
If possible, try connecting through Wi-Fi using another device (such as a 
laptop computer) or connect to your cellular telephone network using a mobile 
phone. (Just make sure that mobile phone uses the same cellular telephone net-
work as your iPad.)
If you’re positive that there is adequate Wi-Fi or cellular telephone cover-
age in your area, then check to make sure you have turned Airplane Mode off and 
turned Wi-Fi on. As a last resort, you can reset the network settings. To do this, 
follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings.
2.	
Make sure the Airplane Mode on/off switch is OFF.
3.	
Tap Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi Networks settings screen appears. Make sure the 
Wi-Fi on/off switch is ON. If you don’t see any networks displayed under 
the Choose a Network category, there may not be any Wi-Fi coverage in 
your area.
4.	
(Optional) Tap General in the left pane. The General settings screen appears.
5.	
(Optional) Scroll down the General settings screen and tap Reset. The Reset 
settings screen appears.
6.	
(Optional) Tap Reset Network Settings.

Q
Q Note: If you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network and you still can’t browse the 
Web or check your email, the Wi-Fi network you are connected to may not 
have Internet access. (For example, you might be in an airport or hotel where 
they’d like you to pay money to connect.) To stop automatically connecting to 
that bad Wi-Fi network, you want to forget it. See “Forgetting a Wi-Fi Net-
work” on page 61 for instructions.
Restoring Your iPad
Each time that you connect your iPad to your computer through its USB cable, the 
iTunes program on your computer makes a backup of your entire iPad. That way if 
your iPad malfunctions or fails completely, you can restore your backed up data to 
a new iPad and start working right away as if nothing had happened.
Restoring from a Backup
Restoring your iPad is an easy fix for many software troubles—give restoring a try 
if your iPad starts to malfunction or fails to sync properly and restarting doesn’t 
work. Even if you lose your iPad, you can get a new one, restore your backups to 
this new iPad, and essentially clone your old iPad onto your new iPad.
To restore a backup from iTunes to your iPad, follow these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPad to your computer through its USB cable.
2.	
Right-click on the name of your iPad under the Devices category in the 
iTunes window. A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 30-1.
Figure 30-1: Every time you connect your iPad to your computer, 
iTunes can back up your data.

3.	
Choose Restore from Backup. A Restore from Backup dialog appears.
4.	
Choose the backup you want to use (if you have multiple choices) and click 
the Restore button.
Encrypting Your Backup
Normally iTunes on your computer just backs up your data without encrypting it. 
However, if you want to protect your backed up data with a password, you can turn 
on backup encryption by following these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPad to your computer through its USB cable.
2.	
Run the iTunes program on your computer.
3.	
Click the name of your iPad under the Devices category in the iTunes 
window.
4.	
Click the Summary tab and select (or unselect) the Encrypt iPad backup 
check box. A dialog pops up, asking you to type in a password twice as 
shown in Figure 30-2.
5.	
Type a password twice and click the Set Password button.
Q
Q Note: You can change your password later by clicking the Change Password 
button on the Summary tab. Before you can restore your backup to your iPad, 
you’ll need to type in your password, so don’t forget it!

Deleting a Backup
Backing up your iPad is a good idea, which is why iTunes does this automatically. 
However, if you’re selling or giving away your computer, you probably don’t want 
to keep your iPad backups on that computer anymore. To remove your backups, 
follow these steps:
1.	
Run the iTunes program on your computer.
2.	
Choose iTunes4Preferences (Macintosh) or Edit4Preferences (Windows). 
A window appears.
3.	
Click the Devices icon or tab. A list of your backups appears, as shown in 
Figure 30-3.
4.	
Click the iPad backup you want to delete and click OK.
Resetting Everything
If you want to return your iPad to its original factory settings, you have two choices. 
First, you can reset your iPad but leave all your data (photos, video, music, and so 
on) intact. Second, you can wipe out everything, including anything you have saved, 
such as photos or apps that you’ve downloaded.
Saving Your Data While Resetting the iPad
If your iPad starts acting weird and restoring doesn’t do the trick, then you might 
need to completely reset it while preserving any data you have stored on it. To 
reset your iPad while preserving all your data on it, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.
3.	
Scroll down and tap Reset. The Reset settings screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 30-4.

Resetting the Keyboard Dictionary
As you type on the virtual keyboard, it gradually learns and adapts to the words 
you use most often. As you type part of a word, the virtual keyboard will display 
the words you’ve used before.
Of course, after the virtual keyboard’s dictionary gets trained to display 
certain words, you may change your writing style, so the keyboard dictionary may 
start suggesting words that you don’t want to type. To avoid this problem, you can 
reset just the keyboard dictionary settings by following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General settings screen appears.

Resetting Location Services
If Location Services is turned on, your iPad can identify its current location. 
When you use certain apps, such as the Maps app, a dialog may pop up asking 
whether you want to use your current location in the app.
After you allow apps to use your iPad’s current location, they will eventually 
stop asking for permission to use your current location again. However, if you pre-
fer having a dialog alert you when your iPad is trying to identify its current location, 
you can reset your iPad’s location warning by following these steps:

Finding a Stolen or Lost iPad
If someone steals your iPad or if you misplace it in a restaurant or office, you can 
track it down using Apple’s free “Find My iPad” service.
The basic idea is that you register your iPad (and iPhone or iPod too!) using 
a free Apple ID. Then if you lose your iPad, you can use any computer to locate 
your device on a map or send a message to its screen. If you have sensitive data 
that you’re worried might get into the wrong hands, you can send a command to 
“wipe” all data from your iPad! And if you’ve just lost your iPad among your couch 
cushions, you can get the iPad to play a sound for two minutes—even if it has been 
muted. 
Turning On the Tracking Feature
Before you can track down an iPad, you must first associate it with a MobileMe 
account. (If you already have an Apple ID from buying music on iTunes or using the 
FaceTime app, you can use that email address and password for your MobileMe 
account.) Then turn on the tracking feature on your iPad by following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars. The Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings 
screen appears.
3.	
Tap Add Account. The Add Account screen appears.
4.	
Tap MobileMe. A MobileMe window appears. Enter your current Apple ID 
and password or tap Create Free Apple ID if you don’t have one yet, and 
then follow the instructions to set up your MobileMe account.

your MobileMe account by clicking on a verification link. After you click the 
link, you will be able to access your MobileMe account by visiting http://www 
.me.com/.
6.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and 
then tap your MobileMe account. A MobileMe account window appears, as 
shown in Figure 30-5.

Locating a Lost iPad
When the Find My iPad switch is set to ON, you can locate your iPad on a map by 
following these steps:
1.	
Visit http://www.me.com/ and sign in using your MobileMe account and pass-
word. MobileMe displays a list of one or more iPad, iPhone, or iPod devices 
you have configured to broadcast its location.

Display Message or Play Sound, Lock, or Wipe, 
as shown in Figure 30-7.
>
>
Display Message or Play Sound  This lets 
you display a message, such as your contact 
number or email address, on the iPad screen 
so that someone finding your device can reach 
you. As an alternative, you can have your iPad 
play a sound so you can locate it in your house 
or office.
>
>
Lock  This lets you block anyone from using your iPad if they don’t 
know your current pass­code. (If you didn’t set up a passcode, go back 
and follow the steps in Chapter 8.)
>
>
Wipe  This lets you erase all your data to prevent unauthorized access. 
Q
Q WARNING: Clicking the Wipe button will return your iPad to its factory set-
tings, but then you will not be able to identify its location or remotely lock it 
with a passcode. 
4.	
Click the Display Message or Play Sound, Lock, or Wipe button, as shown in 
Figure 30-7. Depending on which option you choose, you may see additional 
options.
Additional Ideas for Troubleshooting 
Your iPad
iPad customers are eligible for free phone support from Apple for the first 90 days 
of ownership—US customers can call 1-800-APL-CARE (1-800-275-2273). You can 
also reach Apple’s customer support web page at http://www.apple.com/support/. 
All new iPads come with a one-year limited warranty.
 If you’re fortunate enough live near an Apple Store, take your iPad in and 
compare its behavior to the iPads in the store. Then ask for help from one of the 
geniuses at the Genius Bar, and let them worry about the strange behavior of 
your iPad.
Despite Apple’s reputation for producing quality products, there’s always 
the possibility that you could have gotten a defective unit. If possible, back up all 
your data from your iPad and get a replacement. Then you can restore all your data 
from your computer to your new iPad.

three options after 
you have located 
your iPad
