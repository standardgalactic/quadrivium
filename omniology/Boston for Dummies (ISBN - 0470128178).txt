Introduction
B
oston, one of North America’s oldest cities, is also one of youngest.
Our omnipresent college students help create a youthful atmos-
phere, to be sure, and the wave of construction that’s washing over
parts of downtown is transforming the very face of the city. But the envi-
ronment of innovation and discovery goes deeper than that. Boston has
always anticipated the future even as it embraced the past. Visitors at
this crucial juncture in the city’s history benefit from both its legacy and
its forward-thinking philosophy.
In Boston, past, present, and future collide. Right beside a 21st-century
skyscraper stands a building that housed a turning point of colonial 
history. To reach a tempting boutique, you pass a street musician who
turns out to be a student at one of the Boston area’s world-class conser-
vatories. Follow your nose to a tempting ethnic restaurant; immigrants
have shaped Boston for nearly 400 years, and your tasty meal may come
with an introduction to the latest newcomers.
The more time you spend in Boston, the more you understand, but even
a one-day visit can give you a good sense of this multifaceted city.
About This Book
Remember that Boston For Dummies, 4th Edition, is a reference book, not
a “travel narrative.” You don’t need to read the chapters in order from
front cover to back, and you don’t need to remember everything you
read. Just dip into the sections that particularly interest you. If you
already know that you’ll be staying on your friend’s couch, for example,
you can skip the accommodations information. If you’re burning to do
some serious shopping . . . well, you probably don’t have your nose
buried in the Introduction, anyway.
In assembling the information, suggestions, and listings in this book, I
take a “greatest hits” approach. I present discriminating choices rather
than encyclopedic directories. The focus is on what you need to know,
not on “in case you were wondering” observations. Throughout the
book, I offer plenty of insider advice to make you feel as comfortable 
as possible.
In addition, although I can’t physically protect you every step of the 
way, your safety is important to me. I encourage you to stay alert and be
aware of your surroundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, back-
packs, portable electronic devices, and wallets — all favorite targets of
thieves and pickpockets.

Conventions Used in This Book
Like any reference book, Boston For Dummies uses some shorthand
phrases and abbreviations. The most obvious are “Boston” and “the
Boston area.” Throughout eastern Massachusetts, you’ll find people
born in Newton, raised in Wellesley, educated in Cambridge, and living 
in Quincy who say they’re “from Boston” without thinking twice. Instead
of subjecting you to “Boston, Cambridge, sometimes Brookline, occa-
sionally Somerville, and maybe a few other nearby suburbs,” I use the
shorter terms. When you need specifics (as in addresses), you get them.
Also note the “T” that appears in hotel, restaurant, and attraction list-
ings. The T is the name of Boston’s rapid transit system, and the listings
include the name of the closest T stop.
I use the following credit-card abbreviations in the text:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I’ve divided the hotels into two categories — my personal favorites and
those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still get my hearty seal
of approval. Don’t be shy about considering these “runner-up” hotels if
you’re unable to get a room at one of my favorites or if your preferences
differ from mine — the amenities that the runners-up offer and the serv-
ices that each provides make all of these accommodations good choices
to consider as you determine where to rest your head at night.
I’ve given each accommodations and dining review a dollar-sign designa-
tion to help you get a sense of the price category of the lodging or restau-
rant at a glance. The following table gives you the key to the dollar-sign
designations for accommodations and restaurants; hotel prices are for
one night, double occupancy; restaurant prices include an appetizer,
main course, dessert, and nonalcoholic drink.

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

Please be aware that travel information is subject to change at any time,
and that this caveat is especially true of prices. I suggest that you surf,
call, or write ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans.
For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area,
it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs might be as a traveler. Here’s what I assumed about you:
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Boston and wants expert advice when you finally do get a
chance to enjoy the city.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Boston and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information
available about Boston or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or
attraction available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that
focuses on the places that will give you the best or most enjoyable
experience in Boston.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Boston For Dummies gives you the

This book consists of six parts that lead you through the process of
arriving in and navigating the city, finding a great place to stay, searching
out the restaurants that cater to your tastes, discovering the worthwhile
attractions and shopping areas, perhaps taking a day trip, and generally
having a great time.
Introduction 3

Part I: Introducing Boston
In this part, I acquaint you with a city that always seems familiar but
never fails to surprise. You get an insider’s view of Boston’s top destina-
tions and a quick look at the city’s history. This part also includes the
lowdown on the best times to visit.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Boston
Now you move from the theoretical to the specific. How much should
you budget? How will you get to Boston? Where can families, seniors,
travelers with disabilities, and gay and lesbian travelers find information
tailored to them? What else do you need to know before you leave
home? I answer it all in the chapters in this part.
Part III: Settling Into Boston
In this part, I outline that final leg of your journey, from the airport to
your hotel. I sketch the city’s neighborhoods and explain how to get
around and between them. You figure out which hotel is right for you,
and you get the lowdown on Boston’s diverse restaurant scene.
Part IV: Exploring Boston
Here, I give you the scoop on the city’s sights and attractions, from
museums and historic buildings to tours and cruises. If those places
sound too highfalutin, check out this part for my tips on sports and
shopping. I also recommend some favorite itineraries and day trips.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Boston Nightlife
Boston makes up for its somewhat anemic nightlife with enough cultural
offerings to class up a wrestling match — and enough bars and pubs to
make up for early closing hours. You can’t dance till dawn, but you can
have a ball into the wee hours. I set the scene in this section.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Veteran For Dummies readers know about The Part of Tens, and new-
comers will recognize the value of the chapters here: interesting stuff
that doesn’t seem to fit anywhere else. I offer facts, pointers, and obser-
vations that complement the rest of this book. Enjoy!
Appendix: Quick Concierge
In back of this book, I include an appendix — your Quick Concierge —
containing lots of handy information you may need when traveling in
Boston, such as phone numbers and addresses of emergency personnel
or area hospitals and pharmacies, protocol for finding a baby sitter or a
taxi, and more. Check out this appendix when searching for answers to
lots of little questions that may come up as you travel. You can find
Quick Concierge easily because it’s printed on yellow paper.

Where to Go from Here
For over 20 years, I’ve called Boston home. My refusal to relocate befud-
dles my friends — until they hear me talk about my adopted hometown.
I still can’t get enough of Boston’s sights and sounds, its history and
geography, its walkability, and its proximity to the full range of New
England’s natural resources. From the salty ocean smell that comes in
on the east wind to the flood of visitors that comes in with the autumn
foliage, it’s a thrill. And I’m thrilled to be able to share it with you.

Part I
Introducing Boston

In this part . . .
I
ntroducing a stranger to a new city is a bit like selling
yourself to a job interviewer or a prospective blind date.
You start with the high points — the fascinating history, the
great shopping, the lively dining scene. Maybe you touch on
the hotels, but you don’t dwell on how expensive they can 
be. And you’ll have plenty of time later to mention the rotten
trafﬁc.
In this part, I introduce Boston by spotlighting my favorite
experiences. I brieﬂy explore the history of this fascinating
city and give you an overview of its architecture, cuisine, and
unique (to put it mildly) accent. Finally, I help you schedule
your trip to coincide with interesting events, pleasant
weather, and bargains on airfare and lodging.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of Boston
In This Chapter
 Searching out the city’s best activities, sights, and experiences
 Finding the top places to stay, dine, and shop
 Seeing the most enjoyable local historical sites and attractions
 Discovering the best spots for kids to have fun
P
eople from all over the world seem to feel a connection to Boston.
Even if you haven’t visited the city, you probably know something
about it. Maybe your best friend went to college here, your internist did
her residency at Massachusetts General, or your next-door neighbor got
a tattoo after the Red Sox won the World Series. You see Cheers reruns
and the Boston Pops’ Fourth of July concert on TV, Fidelity manages
your retirement savings, or you remember something about a tea party.
You’re thinking that Boston sounds like a fun place to visit. You’re right.
The city’s historic and cultural attractions, entertaining diversions, and
manageable size make Boston a popular vacation, business, and conven-
tion destination. To help you plan the most enjoyable trip, in this chap-
ter I let you in on my favorite places and activities.
Throughout this book, the “Best of the Best” icon flags the establish-
ments and experiences I like the most.
The Best Travel Experiences
If you want choices, Boston’s got ’em. Whatever you prefer — strolling
through gardens, exploring museums, watching live sports, sight-
seeing (on land and water), shopping, or wandering through historic
neighborhoods — this city has something for you.

 Dotted with tulips, covered in snow, choked with tourists, or fram-
ing a wedding party, Boston’s Public Garden is unforgettable in
any season. The first botanical garden in the country, established
in the mid–19th century, is also home to an admirably diverse col-
lection of statuary. See Chapter 11.
 Two of the best art museums around are in Boston’s Fenway neigh-
borhood — they even share a T stop (cleverly named “Museum”).
The Museum of Fine Arts offers an incredibly wide-ranging over-
view; the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum focuses on European
and American works beloved by its founder and eponym. See
Chapter 11.
 A visit to Fenway Park incorporates the past, present, and future 
of baseball. The oldest park in the Major Leagues benefits from 
the attention of some of the most visionary owners in professional
sports. The team constantly introduces new features, from seating
in unusual places (such as the top of the left-field wall, or “Green
Monster”) to year-round tours. See Chapter 11.
 A Boston Duck Tour explores the city and then hops into the water
for a cruise around the Charles River Basin on an amphibious sight-
seeing vehicle. It’s a unique perspective and an entertaining experi-
ence. See Chapter 11.
 Shopping on Newbury Street, the “Rodeo Drive of New England,”
can cost as little or as very, very much as you like. Take the window-
shopping and people-watching route or wear out your gold card at
a dazzling variety of stores and boutiques. See Chapter 12.
 Sightseeing is great, but sometimes a little loitering can be even
better. A picnic lunch near the river or the harbor or an aimless
walk through an unfamiliar neighborhood (try the North End or
Beacon Hill) can show you aspects of Boston that a guided tour
can’t. Build a little downtime into your travel schedule; you won’t
regret it.
The Best Hotels
All travelers have the same basic needs, but who wants to settle for
basic? The following lodgings offer something extra for everyone from
the jaded business traveler to the once-a-year vacationer. Splurge or
save on your accommodations by choosing one of the fine establish-
ments listed here. For more in-depth descriptions of these hotels and
others, see Chapter 9.
 The Four Seasons Hotel isn’t just the best hotel in Boston — it’s
the best hotel in New England. It offers top-of-the-line everything,
from beds to spa treatments, plus service so good that you almost
forget how much it’s all costing.
Part I: Introducing Boston 
10

 Spectacular water views literally set the scene at the outrageously
plush Boston Harbor Hotel. Beautifully appointed rooms, a 60-foot
lap pool, great business amenities, and easy access to the Financial
District are a few of the features that make it the top downtown
hotel choice.
 The Marriott Residence Inn Boston Harbor also overlooks the
water. The views aren’t as breathtaking as the Boston Harbor
Hotel’s vistas, but neither is the bill. Rates even include breakfast.
Every spacious room has its own kitchen, and families can spread
out in a one- or two-bedroom unit.
 The Charlesmark Hotel has its own version of a marvelous view:
the Boston Marathon finish line. The reasonable prices include
such extras as local phone calls and continental breakfast, so there
will be plenty of money left in your budget for shopping on Newbury
Street, just a block away.
 The MidTown Hotel is another great deal: Rates include parking
(for one car), which saves you at least $25 a night in this conven-
ient neighborhood. Kids enjoy the seasonal outdoor pool, and you
can book them a connecting unit if you don’t feel like sharing a
room.
 The best lodging in Cambridge is The Charles Hotel, located in a
prime spot between Harvard Square and the river. Luxurious but
not frilly, it’s a superb choice for travelers who need every business
perk and vacationers who want to take advantage of the excellent
spa, pool, and restaurants.
The Best Restaurants
In the name of research, I’m constantly trying out new places to eat —
for better or (more often than you’d think) worse. My favorites are the
restaurants I return to because I want to, not because I have to. From
seafood to pizza and from high-end dining to neighborhood cafes, you’ll
have no trouble eating well in Boston. For more detailed listings of these
and other eateries, see Chapter 10.
 The first two steps of the quintessential arrival in Boston are
unpacking and ordering a lobster, and not necessarily in that order.
The best place for lobster and anything else fishy is Legal Sea
Foods. I know, I know — you’re expecting to hear about a little
place in a back alley, and I’m suggesting an internationally famous
(oh, the horror) chain. Trust me.
 Speaking of alleys, Casa Romero is a place you can walk past a
thousand times and never notice. In an alley a stone’s throw from
Newbury Street, this romantic hideaway serves flavorful traditional
Mexican cuisine.
Chapter 1: The Best of Boston 11

 In chain-store-choked Harvard Square, Mr. Bartley’s Burger
Cottage is a welcome slice of authenticity. A mom-and-pop place
that serves yummy burgers (beef, turkey, and veggie) and phenom-
enal onion rings. A quirky delight.
 For fine dining in an elegant town-house setting, try Mamma 
Maria — the best restaurant in the North End. It’s a romantic 
special-occasion destination that deftly combines the traditional
(great osso buco and short ribs) with super-fresh ingredients and
creative techniques (excellent seafood specials).
 At the other end of the culinary spectrum but only a few blocks
away, Pizzeria Regina is the classic North End pizza parlor. The
ferocious brick oven produces a superb crust that perfectly com-
plements the tasty toppings. Just don’t get in the way of the
whirling-dervish waitresses.
The Best Stores
From cheap to chic, boho to bourgeois, the Boston area boasts consis-
tently excellent shopping. For more information on these top retail desti-
nations and others, see Chapter 12.
 Boston’s excellent museums have excellent gift shops. (See Chapter
11 for more specific information on museums.) I particularly like
the options at the Museum of Science, the New England Aquarium,
and the Children’s Museum, which feature educational but not
homeworky toys and games. My favorite is the Museum of Fine
Arts, which carries everything from jewelry based on pieces in the
museum collections to a huge selection of books. The MFA’s satel-
lite location in Faneuil Hall Marketplace offers a wide range of qual-
ity goods as well.
 Filene’s Basement is the big name in New England discount shop-
ping. The enormous selection and great prices bring out the hunter
and gatherer in every bargain shopper who walks through the
doors.
 The Newbury Street gallery scene isn’t as intimidating as you may
think; if you’re curious, wander around. Whether the gallery’s spe-
cialty is painting or photography or antique botanical prints or
modern sculpture, dealers and other staff members are on hand
and (usually) eager to explain why they fell for the work that’s on
display. Don’t miss the International Poster Gallery.
 My idea of a great gift is something the recipient absolutely loves
but never thinks to buy for him- or herself. Of the dozens of worthy
competitors in the Boston area, my top destination is Joie de
Vivre, outside Cambridge’s Porter Square. If you want to borrow
my “one for them, one for me” rule and pick up a game, card, or
even kaleidoscope for yourself, be my guest.

The Best Ways to Explore History
Colonial Boston is as tangible as the 21st-century city. In ways both big
and small, all of New England preserves and celebrates the past, and the
Boston area, in particular, has an especially rich legacy. I promise you
that walking around and seeing historic sites in person is more fun that
reading about them. Here are some excellent places to investigate.
 The Freedom Trail may be a cliché, but like most clichés, the 
3-mile path attained its status for a reason. I have two favorite 
ways to approach it: as a guide to downtown Boston’s most inter-
esting historic attractions and as the jumping-off point for innumer-
able entertaining detours. See Chapter 11.
 The most interesting stop on the Freedom Trail, the Paul Revere
House, recalls the days when downtown Boston consisted almost
entirely of flammable wooden buildings. Built around 1680, the
house stands within sight of downtown’s glittering glass towers,
allowing you to take in nearly 400 years of history without even
taking a step. See Chapter 11.
 The main Harvard University campus captures more than 350
years of history in a couple of verdant quadrangles surrounded by
brick and granite structures that no longer drip with ivy (it dam-
ages the building materials). Stroll around, imagining yourself walk-
ing in the footsteps of everyone from George Washington to Natalie
Portman. See Chapter 11.
 A visit to Concord is a trip back in time — not just to the dawn of
the Revolutionary War, but also to the heyday of 19th-century tran-
scendentalism and Little Women author Louisa May Alcott. This
one-time country village, now a lovely suburb, celebrates its past
all over town. See Chapter 14.
The Best Experiences for Kids
What can the kids do in Boston? A better question may be “What can’t
the kids do in Boston?” Whether your goal is family togetherness or just
getting everyone home in one piece, a visit to a fun attraction can help.
Here are some of my favorite child-friendly excursions, all thoroughly
road-tested by members of the “Are we there yet?” set.
 Little kids (younger than about 10 years old) can’t get enough 
of the Children’s Museum. The interactive exhibits encourage
everything from climbing around to blowing soap bubbles. See
Chapter 11.
 The Museum of Science appeals to a wider age range — even
teenagers won’t be too embarrassed to be seen with the ’rents. It
offers hundreds of interactive displays and fun activities, as well as
Chapter 1: The Best of Boston 13

IMAX movies and a planetarium that schedules laser shows. See
Chapter 11.
 Did you follow Charlotte’s Web and Stuart Little with E. B. White’s
other children’s classic, The Trumpet of the Swan? Then your family
will definitely want to check out the Swan Boats, which ply the
lagoon in the Public Garden from mid-April through mid-September.
The employees pedal while you try to convince the kids that you
see Louis, the trumpeter swan. (The resident swans are actually
named Romeo, Juliet, Castor, and Pollux.) See Chapter 11.
 Less tame, longer, and considerably more exciting is a harbor
cruise. It doesn’t have to be a full-length sightseeing excursion,
either — a ferry ride between Long Wharf, on the downtown water-
front, and the Charlestown Navy Yard is both fun and cheap ($1.70
one-way). See Chapters 8 and 11.
 Every day trip from Boston I cover in this book offers countless
family-friendly activities and diversions. Ask your friends who grew
up in the area — particularly popular school field-trip destinations
include Concord, Salem, and Plymouth. See Chapter 14.
The Best Walks
When I’m sprinting across an intersection where the traffic lights have 
a seven-second “walk” cycle, the nickname “America’s Walking City”
doesn’t seem to suit Boston particularly well. At other times, when I’m
contemplating a small-scale architectural detail, a tree in full bloom, or a
particularly enticing window display, it makes perfect sense. Here are
some excellent routes for pedestrians.
 Yes, it’s obvious, but the Freedom Trail springs to mind because
there’s nothing else quite like it. Banish “should” and “must” from
your vocabulary for a little while and consider the fact that you’re
walking in nearly four centuries’ worth of other people’s footsteps.
For example, Ralph Waldo Emerson led his mother’s cows to graze
on Boston Common each day before he headed to school on School
Street. See “The Best Ways to Explore History,” earlier in this chap-
ter, and Chapter 11.
 Commonwealth Avenue (“Comm. Ave.” to the locals) begins at the
Public Garden, the loveliest park in downtown Boston. You can con-
fine your walk to the Public Garden — make sure to swing by the
Make Way for Ducklings sculptures — or wander the Commonwealth
Avenue Mall, which is basically a long, narrow park between lanes
of the Parisian-style boulevard. Comm. Ave. begins across the
street from the equestrian statue of George Washington in the
Public Garden, and its 19th-century architecture is a welcome dis-
traction from the random collection of statuary on the mall. See
Chapter 11.
Part I: Introducing Boston 
14

 One block away, Newbury Street is a festival of retail and one of
the city’s best venues for people-watching. From the elegantly
coiffed matrons wandering into the luxe boutiques to the extrava-
gantly pierced students devouring ice cream, it’s a cross section of
Boston. See Chapter 12.
 Harvard Square is both a pedestrian paradise and the intersection
of several great walking routes. John F. Kennedy Street leads past
John F. Kennedy Park to the banks of the Charles River, both lovely
places to take a break. On Brattle Street, retail gives way to gor-
geous residential architecture, which peaks at the exquisite Long-
fellow National Historic Site. See Chapter 11. Finally, on Mass. Ave.,
Cambridge’s main artery, the people-watching is as good as it is on
Newbury Street. A stroll north to Porter Square or east to Central
Square exposes you to some of the Boston area’s best shopping.
See Chapter 12.
 The path around Concord’s Walden Pond has been a popular route
for hundred of years — and for good reason. Whether surrounded
by winter snow, spring buds, summer sunbathers, or (best of all)
fall foliage, the pond is a wonderful destination all year. See 
Chapter 14.

f you’re like most visitors, you won’t get out of Boston without at
least a brief, painless history lesson. You can immerse yourself in the
past, visit innumerable colonial and Revolutionary landmarks, and stuff
your head full of random facts. But you don’t need to — merely walking
around exposes you to the Boston of a bygone age.
In this chapter, I offer a brief overview of the city’s fascinating history. I
also tell you about local architecture, suggest where to sample regional
culinary specialties, translate local accents and figures of speech, and
recommend books and movies set in Boston.
History 101: The Main Events
When Europeans established their first permanent settlement in Boston,
in 1630, the peninsula’s landmass was about one-third the size of the
modern city. The outline of part of the original shoreline appears around
the base of the statue of Samuel Adams in front of Faneuil Hall. Thanks
to its excellent location on the deep, sheltered harbor, Boston grew
quickly, becoming a center of shipbuilding, fishing, and commerce.
The Puritans who founded Boston dominated the young society, creating
a legacy that endures to this day. They founded Harvard College in 1636
to train young men for the ministry. Four years later, the town fathers
across the river set aside the land that’s now Boston Common as public
land. Another survivor of colonial Boston is the Paul Revere House,
erected around 1680 and still standing in the North End.

In the 18th century, relations between the Massachusetts Bay Colony
and the British Crown steadily worsened. The first armed conflict, in
1770, was a skirmish between occupying troops and civilians that’s now
known as the Boston Massacre. A marker on State Street commemorates
the event, and the victims’ graves are in the Old Granary Burying
Ground. Both are stops on the Freedom Trail (as is the Paul Revere
House; see Chapter 11). Boston, Cambridge, Lexington, and Concord
(see Chapter 14) preserve a number of other sites that recall the area’s
prominent role in the American Revolution.
After the Revolution, Boston again developed into a center of business.
The city trailed New York and Philadelphia in size and influence, but 
the “Athens of America” became known for fine art and architecture —
including the luxurious Federal-style homes you can still see on Beacon
Hill — and a flourishing intellectual community.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel
Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau were just a few of the big names
on the local literary scene. Homes of the first three are now open to 
visitors. Longfellow’s is in Cambridge, and Emerson’s and Hawthorne’s
are in Concord (where you can also see the site of Thoreau’s cabin at
Walden Pond). William Lloyd Garrison established the weekly Liberator
newspaper, a powerful voice in the antislavery and social-reform move-
ments. Boston was an important stop on the underground railroad; walk-
ing the Black Heritage Trail on Beacon Hill can help you explore that
history.
The landfill projects of the 19th century transformed Boston’s coastline
and skyline. All over the city, the tops of hills (including Beacon Hill)
were cut off and dumped into the water, and Boston tripled in area. 
The largest project, executed from 1835 to 1882, was the filling of the
Back Bay, the body of mud flats and marshes that gave its name to the
present-day neighborhood. It’s the only central Boston neighborhood
laid out in a grid.
Also around the 19th century, waves of immigrants flooded Boston,
changing the social landscape as dramatically and permanently as the
physical one. The upper crust benefited the less fortunate with cultural
institutions: The Boston Symphony, the Boston Public Library, and the
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Boston 17
The alphabet song
The streets of the Back Bay go in alphabetical order, starting at the Public Garden with
Arlington Street and continuing with Berkeley, Clarendon, Dartmouth, Exeter, Fairfield,
Gloucester, and Hereford. Mass. Ave. then jumps in, but if you study a map of the
Fenway, you can make out a few more letters (on streets that are off the neat grid):
Ipswich, Jersey, and Kilmarnock.

Museum of Fine Arts all opened between 1870 and 1895. Irish immi-
grants and their descendants broke the Brahmins’ grip on the political
establishment. Boston elected its first Irish mayor in 1885, and in 1910
John F. Fitzgerald assumed the office. “Honey Fitz” is best known today
as the father of Rose Fitzgerald, a North End native whose second son
was John F. Kennedy.
The next great upheaval came after the Second World War, when the
local student population swelled dramatically, thanks in part to the G.I.
Bill. That development led directly to the high-tech boom that continues
to this day. Old-timers and newcomers alike bonded over sports — the
Celtics from the ’50s to the ’80s, the Bruins in the ’70s, and always the
Red Sox.
At the close of the 20th century, the Big Dig dominated Boston. The gar-
gantuan highway-construction project rerouted I-93 from an elevated
expressway above downtown to a tunnel beneath it, all without closing
the interstate. The 15-year undertaking wound up costing somewhere in
the neighborhood of $15 billion (nice neighborhood!) and reconfigured
many of the city’s main roads, extending I-90 to the airport in East
Boston and spanning the Charles River with the gorgeous Leonard P.
Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge. The Big Dig is technically com-
plete, but it lingers like a bad dream as construction on the parks and
buildings intended to replace it drags on.
Building Blocks: Local Architecture
Boston is downright beautiful. Red-brick buildings and cobblestone
streets contrast delightfully with modern glass towers (and concrete
boxes that seemed like a good idea at the time). The wide and wild vari-
ety of architecture makes the city a visual treat.
Built around 1680, the Paul Revere House on North Square is a reminder
that for Boston’s first two centuries, most buildings were wood, and
huge portions of the town regularly burned to the ground. The house is
colonial in age but Tudor, rather than typically “colonial,” in style. The
casement windows and overhanging second floor are medieval features,
and when the Reveres moved in, in 1770, the house was no longer fash-
ionable. The one next door would have been: the Pierce/Hichborn
House (ca. 1711), a sturdy brick structure with the symmetrical design
that typifies the Georgian architecture often seen in 18th-century
Boston.
After the Revolution, the Federal style dominated; it was the rage from
1780 to 1820. Austere features characterize the style: Ionic and Corin-
thian detailing, frequently in white against red brick or clapboard; fan-
lights over doors; and an almost maniacal insistence on symmetry. In
Boston, the new style was closely associated with architect Charles
Part I: Introducing Boston 
18

Bulfinch. His work is all over Boston, most conspicuously in the Massa-
chusetts State House (1797) and in many Beacon Hill residences.
At 141 Cambridge St. (1796), the first home Bulfinch designed for
Harrison Gray Otis, the obsession with symmetry resulted in the inclu-
sion of a room with one false door to balance the real one. Bulfinch
designed St. Stephen’s Church (1804) in the North End; Harvard’s
University Hall (1814); and the central part of Massachusetts General
Hospital, now known as Bulfinch Pavilion (1818). Bulfinch also planned
the 1805 enlargement of Faneuil Hall, which is now three times the size
it was when it opened in 1742.
No other architect is as closely associated with Boston as Bulfinch, but
in a brief visit, you’re likely to see just as much of the work of several
others. Alexander Parris designed Quincy Market (1826), the center-
piece of Faneuil Hall Marketplace. The columns and facade facing the
original Faneuil Hall epitomize Greek Revival style, which was wildly
popular at the time. Across State Street from the marketplace, the 1847
Custom House Tower has a Greek Revival base. (It gained its colorful
tower in 1915.)
Across town in Copley Square, Trinity Church (1877) is H. H. Richardson’s
masterwork. The heavy stone structure, with its polychrome building
materials and distinctive tower, is a Romanesque showpiece. Facing it is
Charles Follen McKim’s Boston Public Library (1885–1895), an imposing
structure with columns and majestic staircases influenced by the Biblio-
thèque Nationale in Paris; it combines elements of the beaux-arts and
Renaissance Revival styles.
Fascinating architectural areas lie north and south of Copley Square.
Heading north, you come to the Back Bay. The street grid was planned
in the 1860s and ’70s, mostly by Arthur Gilman, and the Parisian flavor of
the boulevards reflects his interest in the French Second Empire style.
It’s also evident in Gilman’s design (with Gridley J. F. Bryant) of Old City
Hall (1862), downtown on School Street. Its mansard roof was an early
example of a style duplicated by countless Back Bay town houses. South
of Copley Square is the South End, another trove of Victoriana, whose
park-studded layout owes more to London than to Paris.
Elaborate early-20th-century buildings adorn the city. The Cutler Majestic
Theater (1903), at 219 Tremont St. in the Theater District, fairly drips
with the ornamentation that characterizes beaux-arts style, from the
intricate facade to the interior arches. Classic Art Deco structures, char-
acterized by dramatic geometric forms and graceful curves, include the
1932 Paramount Theatre, on Washington Street near Downtown Crossing
(look for the huge vertical sign), and the 1931 building, originally the
post office that gave Post Office Square its name, that’s now the
McCormack Federal Courthouse.

Boston Timeline: 1630–2007

1630 John Winthrop leads settlers to present-day Charlestown. Seeking
better water, they push on to the Shawmut peninsula (on Beacon Hill),
which they call Trimountain. On September 7, they name it Boston in
honor of the English hometown of many Puritans. On October 19, 108
voters attend the first town meeting.

1632 Boston becomes the capital of Massachusetts.

1635 Boston Latin School, America’s first public school, opens.

1636 Harvard College is founded.

1704 America’s first regularly published newspaper, the Boston News
Letter, is founded.

1770 On March 5, five colonists are killed outside what is now the Old
State House, an incident soon known as the Boston Massacre.

1773 On December 16, during the Boston Tea Party, colonists dump 342
chests of tea into the harbor from three British ships.


The architecture of the building boom that started in the 1960s owes a
great deal to the fertile mind of a former Harvard instructor, I. M. Pei.
His firm’s sleek designs use mirrored glass to good effect in the Christian
Science Center (1973), the John F. Kennedy Library (1979), and the
West Wing of the Museum of Fine Arts (1981). The landmark John
Hancock Tower (1974) is the most dramatic point in the Boston skyline
but began its life by shedding panes of glass onto the street below. (The
problem has been corrected.)
To see other noteworthy 20th- and 21st-century structures, cross the
river to Cambridge. The only building in North America designed by the
Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier is the Carpenter Center for the
Visual Arts (1963), at 24 Quincy St. on the Harvard campus. The long-
time dean of the university’s architecture school, José Luis Sert, designed
a number of other Harvard buildings, but the MIT campus is a better
destination for visitors interested in contemporary architecture. Alvar
Aalto conceived the sinuous Baker House (1949) on Memorial Drive;
Eero Saarinen designed the Kresge Auditorium (1955), off Mass. Ave.;
and I. M. Pei creations dot the campus. The public is so interested in
Frank O. Gehry that the information desk on the ground floor of the
2004 Stata Center, on Vassar Street off Main Street, distributes a pam-
phlet describing a self-guided tour.
A considerably less-successful modern building is Boston City Hall, a
utilitarian concrete monstrosity designed in the aptly named Brutalist
style and opened in 1968. A small park breaks up the vast brick waste-
land of City Hall Plaza, but it’s still basically an enormous windswept
desert that’s most useful for occasional concerts and for publicity-
hungry politicians who propose leveling the dark, drafty edifice. The
best thing about the plaza at the moment is its sweeping view of a big
chunk of the post–Big Dig landscape. As the new downtown evolves, City
Hall Plaza will be a good place for keeping track of its progress.
Taste of Boston: Local Cuisine
First, let me assure you that if you’re not a big fan of New England clam
chowder, Boston baked beans, and Boston cream pie, you won’t go
hungry. Local menus offer a lot more than stereotypical New England food
(though many do still serve the renowned chowder, beans, and pie). The
Part I: Introducing Boston 
22
A neat trick
Architecture buffs, try this: Standing on the Cambridge Street side of City Hall Plaza or
in front of Faneuil Hall, face City Hall and hold up a nickel with the “tails” side turned
upside-down. The resemblance to Monticello (Thomas Jefferson’s Virginia estate) is
eerie.

locals eat tons of seafood, appreciate chefs’ devotion to local and organic
produce, and demonstrate a willingness to try just about anything once.
Some pointers: Scrod or schrod is a generic term for fresh white-fleshed
fish, usually served in filets. Local shellfish includes Ipswich and Essex
clams, Atlantic lobsters, Wellfleet oysters, scallops, mussels, and shrimp.
Restaurants price lobster by the pound; they typically charge at least
$15 to $20 for a “chicken” (1- to 11⁄4-pound) lobster and more for bigger
portions. If you don’t feel like wrestling with an ornery crustacean, let
someone else do the work and order lobster in a “pie” (casserole), in a
“roll” (sandwich served in a hot-dog bun), stuffed and baked or broiled,
in or over pasta, in salad, or in bisque.
Well-made New England clam chowder is a white soup studded with
fresh clams (but not tomatoes) and thickened with cream. If you want
clams but not soup, many places serve steamers, or soft-shell clams
cooked in the shell, as an appetizer or main dish. They come with a con-
tainer of broth, for rinsing off any lingering grit, and a cup of drawn
butter for dipping. More common are hard-shell clams — littlenecks
(small) or cherrystones (medium-sized) — served raw, like oysters.
Traditional Boston baked beans date from colonial days, when the
Puritans’ strict rules about not working on the Sabbath meant no cook-
ing on Sunday. A pot of beans would go into the oven in a brick kitchen
fireplace on Saturday and cook in the retained heat. House-made baked
beans can be hard to find (Durgin-Park does an excellent rendition), but
where you do find them, you’ll probably also find good cornbread and
brown bread — more like a steamed pudding of whole wheat and rye
flour, cornmeal, molasses, buttermilk, and usually raisins.
Finally, Boston cream pie is golden layer cake sandwiched around cus-
tard and topped with chocolate glaze — no cream, no pie.
For restaurant listings, turn to Chapter 10.
Word to the Wise: The Local Lingo
How much time do you have?
Seriously, the hard-core, I-pahked-my-cah-in-Hahvud-Yahd Boston accent
is not as prevalent as it once was. The occasional dropped “r” is more
typical than the full-blown “youz guys” dialect. It’s all about pronuncia-
tion, which walks the line between British and big-wad-of-gum-in-the-
mouth: for example, aunt is “ahnt” (not “ant”).
Mispronouncing a geographic term is the fastest way to be exposed as
an out-of-towner. Copley is cop-ly (not cope-ly); pronounce the “w” in
Charlestown (not Charleston); Peabody is pea-b’dy (not pea-body); the
“c” in Quincy makes a “z” sound (quin-zee); and Tremont has a short “e”
(treh-mont, not tree-mont).

Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
For children’s book recommendations, see the box “Boston on the chil-
dren’s bookshelf” in Chapter 6.
For adults, the options are numerous and diverse. My top choices are a
tiny fraction of the excellent titles available.
 Paul Revere and the World He Lived In (Mariner Books, 1999), a
Pulitzer Prize winner by Esther Forbes (author of Johnny Tremain),
originally published in 1942, is a portrait of the city and the man at
a crucial time — for both.
 Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three
American Families (Vintage edition, 1986), by J. Anthony Lukas,
uses small details to illustrate a sweeping story about the busing
crisis of the 1970s. Common Ground won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for
nonfiction.
 The Perfect Storm (Perennial; Harper edition, 1999), by Sebastian
Junger, is the story of a fishing boat trapped at sea by a devastating
storm. It’s a compelling portrait of Gloucester, as well as a gripping
account of the perils of getting food onto your plate (it was the basis
for the 2000 movie of the same name starting George Clooney and
Mark Wahlberg). You’ll never again take fresh fish for granted.

Putting words in your mouth
Familiarizing yourself with some common terms, phrases, and idioms can make navi-
gating Boston a little easier. If you’re curious (or can’t figure out whether that remark
was a compliment or an insult), a great site to explore is www.boston-online.
com/glossary.html. Here are a few terms to get you started.
Comm. Ave.: Commonwealth Avenue
Faneuil: rhymes with “Daniel”
frappe: rhymes with “slap”; means “milkshake”
Mass. Ave.: Massachusetts Avenue
Mem. Drive: Memorial Drive
regular coffee: coffee with cream and sugar
So don’t I: so do I
T: the MBTA subway; also used to refer to a particular station (for example, “Meet me
near the Arlington T”)

 Cityscapes of Boston (Houghton Mifflin, 1992; Mariner, 1994), by
Robert Campbell and Peter Vanderwarker, uses before-and-after
photos of locations all over town to demonstrate how the face of
the city has (and hasn’t) changed.
 Boston A to Z (Harvard University Press, 2001), by Thomas H.
O’Connor, offers a range of delightfully miscellaneous information
about the city’s past and present.
 “Paul Revere’s Ride,” the classic Longfellow poem about April 18
and 19, 1775, is historically questionable, but it’s just as stirring
today as it was nearly 150 years ago. Check it out before following
the Freedom Trail or touring Lexington and Concord. You can 
pick up a copy of this poem at many gift shops along the Freedom
Trail — mine cost about $3 at the Old North Church — or invest in
a read-along version such as Puffin Books’ 1996 edition, illustrated
by Ted Rand.
For a list of suggested guidebooks, see the “Where to Get More
Information” section of the Appendix.
Many movies are interesting solely for their scenery and others simply
because you can hear them — and their dreadful renditions of the iconic
Boston accent. But only a few films manage to combine a good story,
not-too-embarrassing accents, and the thrill of recognizable locations.
 Good Will Hunting is my favorite Boston movie. Coauthors and
costars Matt Damon (a Harvard dropout) and Ben Affleck grew up
in Cambridge, and their authentic accents almost make up for
Robin Williams’s brogue. At press time, Affleck’s Boston-set directo-
rial debut, Gone, Baby, Gone (2007), was generating positive buzz.
 Mystic River features locations that will never make it onto the back
of a postcard — in other words, actual blue-collar neighborhoods —
and a compelling, if disturbing, plot.
 The Departed (a reinterpretation of the Hong Kong hit Infernal
Affairs) sets a knowing look at the worlds of law enforcement and
organized crime against a backdrop of familiar and relatively undis-
covered locations.
 Next Stop Wonderland is a sort of valentine to the subway, of all
things, with many great shots of the New England Aquarium. It’s
also an enchanting story of fate and coincidence.
 The Verdict is a memorable portrait of the local legal establish-
ment, from ambulance chasing to blue-blood snobbery.
 Love Story is as sappy as they come, with gorgeous montages of
the Harvard campus. Keep an eye out for a cameo by the young
Tommy Lee Jones, class of ’68.

E
very season is a good time to visit Boston. The climate is relatively
temperate — with some exceptions, which I cover in this chapter.
Citywide events are generally entertaining but not overwhelming — with
some exceptions, which I also cover in this chapter. The people are typi-

Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
For those of you lucky enough to have the luxury of traveling whenever
you want to, this section presents the highlights and drawbacks of the
four seasons.
Between April and November, Boston typically experiences few slow
periods. Conventions take place all year, clustering in the spring and fall.
The Convention & Visitors Bureau (see the Appendix for contact infor-
mation) can tip you off to especially large gatherings.
Lots of places claim to be the inspiration for the weather cliché “If you
don’t like it, wait ten minutes,” but a few days in Boston may persuade
you that New England’s climate gave birth to the expression. Table 3-1
gives you an idea of the conditions you can expect.

Springtime in Boston
The tenacious New England winter makes spring in Boston short —
really just April and May. Here are the best reasons to take advantage 
of Boston during these two months:
 As it awakens from its long winter’s nap, the city is both good-
looking and good-natured. Spring flowers abound, and happy 
locals flock outdoors to enjoy moderating temperatures.
 Patriots’ Day activities and Boston Marathon spectating are two 
of the most authentic and popular local experiences — because
they’re so much fun.
But keep in mind the following springtime pitfalls:
 Snow can linger into April. Snow or not, early spring is the height of
mud season.
 Booking a hotel room for Marathon weekend can be tough, and
Patriots’ Day marks the start of a school vacation week — not
exactly a restful time to visit.
 College graduation season begins in May. As a result, hotels fill in
somewhat random patterns as confused out-of-state drivers flood
the area.
Summer in Boston
June, July, and August are madly popular months to visit Boston. Here
are some of the high points:
 The weather turns reliably pleasant, and the long hours of sunlight
mean that you can pack a lot of outdoor fun into a single day.
 Harborfest, which includes Boston’s over-the-top Independence
Day celebrations, is one of the most fun events in the country.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 27

But summer isn’t perfect, and here’s why:
 Graduation pandemonium lingers into June, translating into a jump
in hotel occupancy rates and room rates.
 In July and August, vacationing families flock to Boston, creating
long lines and lots of tantrums.
 Summer is about the only time of year when you may encounter
consecutive days of 90-plus temperatures, usually accompanied by
debilitating humidity and abysmal air quality. Be ready to concen-
trate on indoor activities or willing to take it slow outside.
Fall in Boston
Autumn is the most popular — and expensive — time to visit Boston.
Here’s a look at the pluses of visiting in September, October, and
November:
 After Labor Day, the weather turns cooler, and humidity drops.
September and October are the months most likely to include a run
of exhilarating weather, with comfortably warm days and cool to
chilly nights.
 During foliage season, from late September to mid-November, 
the Boston area makes an excellent jumping-off point or base for
“leaf-peeping.”
 The Head of the Charles Regatta, on the third weekend of October,
is a quintessential New England event that attracts hundreds of
thousands of people. Crew racing is both fun to watch and a great
excuse for a huge outdoor party.
And the minuses:
 Foliage season is the toughest time of year to book a room —
tougher than summer, even. The tour buses causing gridlock in the
streets are full of travelers who drive up hotel room rates.
 College starts in earnest, and post-adolescents crowd the streets;
watch out for moving vans, especially on September 1.
 In November, the days shorten, and the weather may turn cold and
raw. Many outdoor activities (such as walking tours and sightsee-
ing cruises) shut down for the winter.
Winter in Boston
December through March is the slowest travel season of the year.
Visiting at this time comes with the following advantages:
 Many hotels offer great deals, especially on weekends. Hard-up
hoteliers offer holiday-shopping specials in December and deep
discounts in the New Year.
Part I: Introducing Boston 
28

 The original family-oriented, no-alcohol New Year’s Eve celebration,
Boston’s renowned First Night, incorporates more activities and
performances than you can possibly fit into one day.
But there are some disadvantages:
 The default weather condition is bitter cold with biting winds.
You’ll probably have to concentrate on indoor activities. In addi-
tion, a big storm can disrupt your travel schedule.
 On New Year’s Eve, rooms fill with suburbanites who don’t want to
deal with driving home after midnight; book far in advance. During
the February school vacation week (starting with Presidents’ Day),
kid-oriented places and activities fill up fast.
 Some suburban attractions close in the winter.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Crowds flood Boston for many of these popular events. Expect full
hotels and overbooked restaurants. To avoid disappointment, double-
check before scheduling a trip to coincide with an event.
Spontaneous travelers and others who haven’t planned ahead can 
pick up suggestions from the event hot line of the Greater Boston
Convention & Visitors Bureau (% 800-SEE-BOSTON or 617-536-4100;
www.bostonusa.com), the listings in the Boston Globe’s daily “Sidekick”
and Thursday “Calendar” sections (www.boston.com/globe), and the
“Edge” section of the Friday Boston Herald (www.bostonherald.com).
January/February
 Mid-January: Events surrounding Martin Luther King, Jr., Day
(third Mon of Jan) include gospel celebrations and other musical
happenings, lectures, and panel discussions at various venues.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 29
A weather report, for better or verse
This poem is the second-best rhyme about Boston to know (after “Paul Revere’s Ride”).
The description applies to the short column of lights on top of the old John Hancock
building in the Back Bay.
Steady blue, clear view;
flashing blue, clouds due;
steady red, rain ahead;
flashing red, snow instead.
(In the summer, flashing red means bad weather has postponed the Red Sox game.)

Check special listings in the Thursday Globe “Calendar” section for
specifics.
 Late January or early February: For Chinese New Year, the
dragon parade draws a crowd to Chinatown no matter how cold it
is, and the Children’s Museum (% 617-426-8855; www.boston
kids.org) puts on special programs. The date depends on the
Chinese lunar calendar: In 2008, it’s February 7; in 2009, it’s January
26. The parade usually occurs on the weekend closest to the holi-
day. Contact the city Office of Arts, Tourism & Special Events 
(% 617-635-3911; www.cityofboston.gov/arts) for information.
 February: Special museum exhibits and children’s programs high-
light Black History Month. Many institutions schedule concerts,
films, and other activities. National Park Service rangers (% 617-
742-5415; www.nps.gov/boaf) lead tours of the Black Heritage
Trail.
 Mid-February: During School Vacation Week, which starts on
Presidents’ Day, most Massachusetts elementary and high schools
close. Special cultural activities include kid-oriented exhibitions,
plays, concerts, and tours. Contact attractions for information on
special offerings and extended hours.
March/April
 Mid-March: The New England Spring Flower Show is a perfect
antidote to cabin fever. At the end of an especially snowy winter,
expect huge crowds. Plan to use public transit. The Massachusetts
Horticultural Society (% 617-536-9280; www.masshort.org) pre-
sents the show during the middle of March at the Bayside Expo
Center in Dorchester.
 Late March through early April: The Big Apple Circus performs 
in a heated tent on City Hall Plaza for about one month every
spring. Proceeds support the Children’s Museum. Visit the 
museum box office or contact Ticketmaster (% 617-931-ARTS;
www.ticketmaster.com).
 Late April: On Patriots’ Day, the third Monday of April, New
England marks the unofficial end of winter. The state holiday 
commemorates the events of April 18 and 19, 1775, when the
Revolutionary War began. Lanterns (as in “two if by sea”) hang in
the steeple of the Old North Church (% 617-523-6676; www.old
north.com), and riders dressed as Paul Revere and William Dawes
travel from Boston’s North End to Lexington and Concord. “Minute
men” and “redcoats” reenact the battles on the town green in Lex
ington and at the Old North Bridge in Concord. See Chapter 14 for
information on visiting Lexington and Concord.
 Late April: The legendary Boston Marathon starts in stages at 10 a.m.
on Patriots’ Day, the third Monday of April. The leaders cross the
finish line, on Boylston Street in front of the Boston Public Library,
Part I: Introducing Boston 
30

beginning a little after 2 p.m. Good vantage points include Comm.
Ave. and Kenmore Square. For information, visit www.boston
marathon.org or call % 617-236-1652.
May/June
 Mid-May: Lilac Sunday is the only day of the year when the Arnold
Arboretum permits picnicking. The gorgeous botanical garden, in
Boston’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood, boasts sensational spring
flowers, including more than 400 varieties of lilacs. Call % 617-524-
1717 or visit www.arboretum.harvard.edu. Second or third week-
end of May.
 Late May: When the Street Performers Festival takes over Faneuil
Hall Marketplace, musicians, magicians, jugglers, sword-swallowers,
and artists strut their stuff. Call % 617-338-2323 or check www.
faneuilhallmarketplace.com for more information.
 Mid-June: The region’s largest gay-pride parade is the Boston
Pride March. The procession on the second Sunday of June 
from the Back Bay to Beacon Hill caps off a week of celebrating
diversity in New England. Call % 617-262-9405 or visit
www.bostonpride.org.
July/August
 July 4: The Fourth of July is the high point of Boston Harborfest
and a guaranteed blast. Events include fireworks, concerts, guided
tours, cruises, the Boston Chowderfest, and USS Constitution’s
annual turnaround. Call % 617-227-1528 or visit www.boston
harborfest.com for more information.
 July 4: The centerpiece of Fourth of July festivities is the Boston
Pops Concert and Fireworks Display, at the Hatch Shell amphithea-
ter on the Esplanade. Live music begins in the evening, but this
event is an all-day affair — fans arrive at dawn to stake out pieces
of the lawn in front of the stage. The program includes the “1812
Overture,” with actual cannon fire, and amazing fireworks at about
10 p.m. (If you’re not keen on roasting in the sun, wait until dark,
ride the Red Line to Kendall/MIT, and watch the pyrotechnics from
the Cambridge side of the river.) Visit www.july4th.org for more
details.
 August: The North End is always fun to explore, and during the
Italian-American feasts on summer weekends, it rocks. The street
fairs begin in July and include food, games, live and recorded
music, and dancing in the streets. The Fisherman’s Feast in the
middle of August and the Feast of St. Anthony at the end of August
are the biggest. Check their Web sites, www.fishermansfeast.com
and www.saintanthonysfeast.com, for highlights.

September/October
 Mid-October: It’s not your imagination — elephants really are
having lunch in the North End. It must be time for the Ringling
Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus’ annual two-week visit to
the TD Banknorth Garden (% 617-624-1000; www.tdbanknorth
garden.com).
 Late October: Thousands of rowers plus hundreds of thousands of
spectators flood Boston and Cambridge for the Head of the Charles
Regatta. A huge party (without alcohol) rages on the banks of the

bration endures in Plymouth. The “stroll through the ages” show-
cases 17th- and 19th-century Thanksgiving preparations in historic
homes. Plimoth Plantation (% 800-262-9356 or 508-746-1622; www.
plimoth.org), which re-creates the colony’s first years, offers a
reservation-only Victorian Thanksgiving feast. (Trust me, you’re
not sorry to miss out on Pilgrim food.) For visitor information, call
% 800-USA-1620 or check out www.visit-plymouth.com. Fourth
Thursday of November.
 November through December: Boston Ballet’s Nutcracker, one of
the country’s biggest and best, starts its annual run the day after
Thanksgiving. The spectacular sets help make the ballet an enticing
way to introduce children to theatergoing. Contact Tele-charge 
(% 800-447-7400; www.telecharge.com) as soon as you plan your
trip, ask whether your hotel offers a Nutcracker package, or check
for returned tickets in person at the Opera House box office at 
539 Washington St.

hotels. Factor in a pricey meal, some unexpected incidentals, and the
siren song of low (or no) sales tax on clothes, and watch your carefully
calculated budget fall apart.
You can take a lesson from the Boston area’s ever-present students.
They occupy a parallel universe where food is plentiful and reasonably
priced, entertainment is cheap or free, and the whole point of shopping
is getting the most out of your (and your parents’) hard-earned money.
Of course, if you imitate the students too slavishly, you can wind up
sleeping in a stranger’s bathtub and eating mystery meat. You get the
idea, though: Know what’s important to you, and try not to overpay for it.
Planning Your Budget
A well-constructed budget is like a tricky jigsaw puzzle. Making it work
can be as satisfying as dropping that 1,000th puzzle piece into place.
Think hard (and ask your companions to do the same) about what’s
important to you, and consider the pointers in this chapter.

34

Transportation
Airfare (or the cost of another mode of transportation) is your first big
fixed cost. If you travel during foliage season or at the height of summer,
you can expect to pay peak prices. Visit at a slower time, and you may
land a great promotional rate. Turn to Chapter 5 for more information.
Driving to Boston can appear to be a budget-conscious option, if you
resign yourself to parking the car when you arrive and not retrieving it
until you leave. But before you shout “road trip,” compare the cost of
tolls, gas, parking, and incidentals to the best airfare you can find — you
may discover that driving isn’t such a great deal after all.
Fortunately, once you arrive in Boston, the price of transportation is
quite budget-friendly — in fact, it can be free. In this compact city, many
popular destinations are easiest to reach on foot. (If you want to prorate
the wear on your walking shoes, be my guest.)
I plan to harp on this point until out-of-state drivers are as rare as
mastodons: You do not need a car to get around Boston and Cambridge.
The things you think you get — flexibility and convenience — are
exactly the things you sacrifice. Boston in particular is as nightmarish
for drivers as New York or San Francisco. If you decide to rent a car —
say, for a day trip — make sure that the price the company quotes
includes all taxes and fees.
Taxis are expensive and can be hard to find, but you can track one down
eventually. The money you save by not renting a car can pay for several
days’ worth of cab rides. (See Chapter 8 for information on taxis.)
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), known locally
as the T, provides cheap transportation ($1.70–$2 for the subway, $1.25–
$1.50 for the local bus) in and around the city. A LinkPass, good for
unlimited local rides for one day ($9) or seven days ($15), can make
public transit a better deal — but only if you plan to use it enough. Note
that service shuts down by 1 a.m. and doesn’t go everywhere — that
means more cabs. (For the lowdown on public transit, see Chapter 8.)
Lodging
Boston is a relatively small city with relatively expensive hotels. Although
new properties have opened in recent years, demand still outstrips
supply at busy times. Fixed costs are high, and even with a big discount,
an outrageous rate drops to merely pricey. The average double-room
rate flirts with $190. A great package or online deal can seriously under-
cut the average price, but at busy times, you’re more likely to hear “take
it or leave it” than “let’s make a deal.” See Chapter 9 for the lowdown on
hotels.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 35

If you can’t book a relatively inexpensive B&B and prefer something
nicer than a hostel, expect to spend at least $140 a night in high season.
That figure doesn’t include a 12.45 percent hotel tax. The price of a cen-
trally located chain hotel may seem high (except in the dead of winter).
Just remember that the lower cost of many suburban establishments
doesn’t include the time and expense of commuting to downtown attrac-
tions and businesses — or the psychic damage Boston-area traffic inflicts.
Dining
Thank the students: You can find tasty, inexpensive food all over the
place. But don’t get carried away. If you’ve been waiting for years to try
fresh lobster, this is not the time to cut corners.
Serious penny-pinchers can enjoy a decent breakfast for $5 or less,
lunch for $6 or so, and a more-than-adequate dinner for as little as $15. If
your budget, appetite, or both are small, a good strategy is making lunch
the big meal of the day. Or start with a bagel and coffee or juice ($2–$3),
lunch on a sandwich or salad ($5), and go wild at dinner.
Sightseeing
I would be remiss if I didn’t tell you that plenty of people visit Boston
just to shop, eat, and watch sports (namely the Red Sox and Patriots,
plus the Celtics, Bruins, and local college teams). If you want to soak up

Wolves in cheap clothing: 
Bargains that aren’t
Looking back on other trips you’ve taken, you tend to focus on obvious missteps —
the hotel renovation special, the discount tour with a guide your uncle saw on
America’s Most Wanted, and the time you said, “If it’s that terrible, would it be a ‘fea-
tured destination’?” — dumb moves you know not to repeat.
The cost-cutting steps to worry about are the ones that sound so good that you may
forget they can be mistakes. Here are two biggies.
 Sacrificing convenience for price. Sometimes the deal is so good that you can’t
ignore it. (I’ve flown out of Providence rather than Boston to save $600, and I’d do
it again.) But before you decide to save $50 by leaving at 6 a.m. and returning at 
1 a.m. — a mere seven hours before your workday starts — think hard about just
how good a deal that is.
 Paying for things you don’t need. The seven-day transit pass saves tons of money,
but only when you use it enough. If you don’t eat breakfast, the room rate that
includes a big buffet is subsidizing someone else’s meal. The weekend special at
a hotel with a great spa is no deal for someone who just wants a lap pool. A bar-
gain is a bargain only if you get something you wanted anyway.

some more culture, turn to Part V, make a list, and start adding those
admission costs. First, check out potential deals. The Boston CityPass
and Go Boston card offer good deals on attractions (see Chapter 11 for
details), and many institutions, such as the Children’s Museum, Museum
of Fine Arts, and Institute of Contemporary Art, schedule hours when
admission is cheap, by donation, or free.
Shopping
Budget what you like, not forgetting souvenirs — and also not forgetting
that a great deal from Filene’s Basement makes a better keepsake than
another T-shirt or refrigerator magnet ever can. Shopping-wise, Boston
is celebrated for high-end arts and crafts, merchandise from its dozens
of colleges, and deals on clothing. That doesn’t mean that prices are
especially good — it means the 5 percent sales tax doesn’t apply to
clothing priced below $175. For more information on Boston’s shopping
scene, check out Chapter 12.
Nightlife
If culture is your main motivation, start with, say, the Boston Symphony
Orchestra (known as the BSO) and build the rest of your budget around
that. Good seats for the BSO, the Boston Pops, Boston Ballet, or a
Broadway-bound show likely will set you back at least $50 a head. Less
expensive but equally enjoyable options include numerous local per-
forming-arts companies and superb jazz clubs (see Chapters 15 and 16
for details).
Even if a splashy night out isn’t your thing, consider reserving time,
money, and energy for an after-dark excursion. Boston offers lots of rela-
tively inexpensive cultural opportunities, such as half-price theater tick-
ets and cheap or free student performances in every artistic field. Or
warm yourself at a congenial pub; a couple of hours and a couple of
pints with the locals can often tell you more about the city than an army
of tour guides. (For information on the city’s nightlife, see Part V.)
Cutting Costs — But Not Fun
You may hear that Boston is a great bargain because it’s a college town.
True, but a typical college kid isn’t buying meals, snacks, subway passes,
and souvenirs for a family of four. Here are some tips to help you trim
your travel costs.
 Go off-season. If you can visit Boston during nonpeak times (Nov
through mid-Apr, and especially Jan–Mar), you find hotel prices dis-
counted as much as 50 percent from their high-season rates.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may lock in a cheaper airfare. When you inquire
about airfares, ask whether flying on a different day reduces the
rate. See Chapter 5 for more tips on getting the best airfare.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 37

 Reserve your flight well in advance. A ticket purchased 14 to 21
days in advance can save you more than $500 on a full fare. See
Chapter 5 for details.
 Reserve your flight only a couple of days in advance. Last-minute
Internet fares (released Wed for the weekend that starts two days
later) aren’t a sure thing, because you never know what destinations
they’ll include, but they sure are a bargain. Check out Chapter 5 for
more information.
 Don’t fly to Boston. You’ll get to Boston eventually. Flying to
Manchester, New Hampshire, or Warwick, Rhode Island, can be
much cheaper than flying to Boston’s Logan International Airport. 
If you have more time than money, these alternate cities are worth
checking out. See Chapter 5 for details.
 Try a package tour. An arrangement that includes airfare, lodging,
airport transfers, and perhaps some extras (such as a trolley tour)
can save money and time. Turn to Chapter 5 for more details.
 Bring only as much luggage as you can carry easily. A pile of
heavy bags weighs you down so much that jumping on the T isn’t a
reasonable option. So you’ll wind up hailing a cab, which costs an
awful lot more than the subway, and possibly tipping skycaps and
bellmen. Plan to handle your own lightly packed luggage, and don’t
forget to leave room for souvenirs you may carry home.
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. It may not
feel like as much of a vacation if you do your own cooking and
dishes, but eating in restaurants three times a day can be pricey.
Even if you only make your own breakfast and take an occasional
bag lunch, you’ll still save money — and maybe calories, too.
 Always ask for discount rates. All that money you pay to belong to
the auto club, AARP, a trade union, or another organization with
group bargaining power can pay off — but only if you remember to
ask about deals. When you book transportation and accommoda-
tions, have your membership cards handy.
 Water is free. It is at the hotel and at water fountains in attractions
and Visitor Centers, anyway. Bring a bottle from home, and fill it
before you go sightseeing. If that seems a bit maniacal, consider
picking up a six-pack at a drugstore or supermarket and stowing
bottles in your room. It may sound silly, but buying individual bot-
tles (for as much as $3) throughout the day can really add up.
 Ask whether your kids can stay in the room with you. A room
with two double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with
a queen-size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional-
person rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you.
Even if you have to pay $10 or $20 extra for a rollaway bed, you’ll
save hundreds by not taking two rooms.
Part I: Introducing Boston 
38

 Don’t rent a car while in Boston and Cambridge. If you’re plan-
ning an out-of-town day trip, go wild. Otherwise, save the expense
of renting and parking.
 Keep a lid on incidentals. In a day of spending $1 here and $5 
there — on postcards, stamps, maps, snacks, sunscreen, and other
random items — you can easily spend $20 or $30 and barely notice it.
 Buy an MBTA pass. But only if you plan to use it. The pass can be a
great deal if you use it enough (see Chapter 8 for details).
 Buy a Boston CityPass or Go Boston card. The CityPass covers
just six attractions (including the Museum of Fine Arts) but repre-
sents a 50 percent discount if you visit all of them. The Go Boston
card covers a broader range of businesses, for a correspondingly
higher price — which is also a good deal if you use it enough. See
Chapter 11 for details.
 Take advantage of free or cheap museum admission. The USS
Constitution Museum is free; the Children’s Museum costs $1 after 
5 p.m. on Friday; the Institute of Contemporary Art is free after 5 p.m.
Thursday; the Harvard art museums are free before noon Saturday;
and the Harvard natural history museums are free on Sunday morn-
ing year-round and Wednesday during the academic year from 3 to
5 p.m. The Museum of Fine Arts is pay-what-you-wish after 4 p.m.
on Wednesday.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner. Your
lunch tab can be a fraction of the dinner bill at the same establish-
ment, and the menu often includes many of the same specialties.
 Pass on the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories
should be the best mementos of your trip. If you’re worried about
money, you can do without the T-shirts and trinkets.
 Let the kids do some planning. You may be pleasantly surprised to
discover that they consider a ride on a Swan Boat and a session of
duck feeding at the Public Garden a full and fulfilling morning.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying
and of your favorite alternate form of currency. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat every meal out when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 39

Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine), sometimes referred to as a “cash machine,”
or “cash point.” The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com)
and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe;
the NYCE network (www.nycenet.com) operates in the eastern United
States. Look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re
on, and then call or check online for ATM locations at your destination.
Be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN) before you
leave home, and be sure to find out your daily withdrawal limit before
you depart. Also, keep in mind that many banks impose a fee (rarely
more than $2 for domestic transactions) every time you use your card at
a different bank’s ATM. On top of this charge, the bank from which you
withdraw cash may charge its own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees
within the United States, use www.bankrate.com.
If your ATM card is also a debit card, consider carrying at least one con-
ventional credit card. When using a debit card, you’re spending the
equivalent of cash — and depleting your checking account. Some banks
“freeze” part of the money in your account when you use a debit card for
a transaction without a set amount (like a car rental or a tank of gas).
The largest banks in Massachusetts are Bank of America (% 800-432-
1000; www.bankofamerica.com) and Citizens Bank (% 800-922-9999;
www.citizensbank.com); Citibank (% 800-627-3999; www.citibank.
com) is rapidly establishing itself. Their ATMs accept most networks’
cards, subject to a service fee. State law says banks must warn you
before imposing a fee for using a “foreign” bank card and offer you the
chance to cancel the transaction.
The SUM network (www.sum-atm.com) gives customers of smaller banks
and credit unions free access to other members’ ATMs. Check to see
whether your bank belongs to the SUM network or has another arrange-
ment that can help you avoid fees.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses. You can withdraw cash advances from
your credit cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If
you’ve forgotten yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number
on the back of your credit card, and ask the bank to send it to you. It
usually takes five to seven business days, though some banks will pro-
vide the number over the phone if you provide your mother’s maiden
name or some other personal information.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
(including Boston) have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small
Part I: Introducing Boston 
40

amounts of cash as needed. However, keep in mind that you will likely be
charged an ATM withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own, so if you’re
withdrawing money every day, you may be better off with traveler’s
checks — provided that you don’t mind showing identification every
time you want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
You can also get American Express traveler’s checks online, subject to a
service fee, and over the phone by calling % 800-721-9768; AmEx gold
and platinum cardholders who use this number are exempt from the 
1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500,
and $1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can
obtain Visa checks for a $9.95 fee at most AAA offices or by calling 
% 866-339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-
223-9920 for a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all of your credit-card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss. Most credit-card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen;
they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an
emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency
numbers in the United States:
 American Express % 800-992-3404 (for cards) or 800-221-7282 (for
traveler’s checks)
 MasterCard % 800-627-8372 or 636-722-7111
 Visa % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free-number directory at 
% 800-555-1212.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
by Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you lose your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 888-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you lose all forms of photo ID, call your air-
line and explain the situation; you may be able to board the plane if you
have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the police
report you’ve filed.

In this part . . .
C
areful travel planning can feel like ditch digging, but it
can pay off like gold mining. This part puts you (ﬁgura-
tively and perhaps literally) on the road to Boston. I explain
the nitty-gritty of budgeting, give you the information you
need to book your trip, and discuss the pros and cons of
package deals and escorted tours. Travelers with special
needs and interests can ﬁnd out about resources tailored just
for them. Finally, I double-knot the loose ends — including
buying travel insurance (or not) and renting a car (or not) —
and send you on your way.

f the details of trip planning start to bog you down, you may begin to
suspect that the longest distance between two points is a straight line.
You don’t have to feel that way. In this chapter, I give you all the informa-
tion you need to make the decisions that are right for you.
Flying to Boston
Logan International Airport (% 800-23-LOGAN; www.massport.com/
logan; airport code: BOS) serves Boston and is the primary air gateway
to New England. In the popular “hub-and-spoke” airline model, Boston is
typically a spoke — a destination, not a transfer point. No major airlines
make their headquarters here.
Finding out which airlines fly there
The major domestic airlines that serve Logan are AirTran (% 800-247-
8726; www.airtran.com), American (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com),
Continental (% 800-525-0280; www.continental.com), Delta (% 800-
221-1212; www.delta.com), JetBlue (% 800-538-2583; www.jetblue.
com), Midwest (% 800-452-2022; www.midwestexpress.com), Northwest
(% 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com), United (% 800-241-6522; www.ual.com),
and US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com).
International carriers include American (% 800-433-7300 in the U.S.,
8457-789-789 in the U.K. outside London, 207-365-0777 in London; www.
aa.com), British Airways (% 800-247-9297 in the U.S., 0870-850-9850 in
the U.K.; www.british-airways.com), Delta (% 800-241-4141 in the
U.S., 0845-600-0950 in the U.K.; www.delta.com), United (% 800-538-
2929 in the U.S., 0845-8444-777 in the U.K.; www.united.com), and Virgin
Atlantic (% 800-821-5438 in the U.S., 08705-747-747 in the U.K.; www.
virgin-atlantic.com) from England; Aer Lingus (% 866-886-8844 in
the U.S., 0818-365000 in Ireland; www.aerlingus.ie), American Airlines,

and US Airways from Ireland; and Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.air
canada.ca) from Canada. From Australia, Qantas (% 800-227-4500 in
the U.S., 13-13-13 in Australia; www.qantas.com.au) flies to the West
Coast of the United States and can provide connecting service to Boston.
Looking at attractive airport alternatives
If you have lots of time but not lots of money, booking a flight into Man-
chester, New Hampshire, or Warwick, Rhode Island (outside Providence),
can be a great deal. Southwest Airlines (% 800-435-9792; www.southwest.
com) broke these markets open, and many other carriers now serve both
cities. Getting to Boston can be a hassle — allow at least one and a half
hours for the trip to or from either of these airports — but the money
you save on airfare may be worth it.
Manchester-Boston Regional Airport (% 603-624-6556; www.fly
manchester.com; airport code: MHT) is about 51 miles north of Boston.
Under a pilot program, the airport currently offers free Manchester
Shuttle van service to and from Boston (the Sullivan Square Orange 
Line T stop, to be precise); check the Web site for details. In addition,
Vermont Transit (% 800-552-8737; www.vermonttransit.com) oper-
ates bus service to and from South Station and Logan Airport ($18.50
one-way; $37 round-trip).
Manchester is currently preferable to T. F. Green Airport (% 888-268-
7222; www.pvdairport.com; airport code: PVD), which is in Warwick,
Rhode Island, about 60 miles south of Boston. Public transit does not
serve this airport directly from Boston, creating a serious logistical chal-
lenge. Amtrak (% 800-USA-RAIL or 617-482-3660; www.amtrak.com), the
MBTA commuter rail (% 800-392-6100 or 617-222-3200; www.mbta.com),
and Bonanza bus (% 800-556-3815; www.peterpanbus.com) connect
Boston to Kennedy Plaza in downtown Providence, and the local bus,
operated by the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (% 800-244-
0444; www.ripta.com), runs to and from Warwick. Pack light!
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of 
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or their companies pay)
the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your ticket
far in advance, can stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel
midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive
price, which is usually a fraction of the full fare. On most flights, even
the shortest hops within the United States, the full fare is close to $1,000
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Boston 
46

or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance purchase ticket may cost less than
half of that amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, lowering prices on their most
popular routes. These fares have advance purchase requirements and
date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As you plan
your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend to take
place in seasons of low travel volume — November to mid-April, with
the best deals from January through March. You almost never see a sale
around the peak summer vacation months of July and August, during the
fall foliage season, or around Thanksgiving or Christmas.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety
records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress
(Flights.com) (% 800-TRAV-800; www.eltexpress.com) has excellent
fares worldwide, particularly to Europe. FlyCheap (% 800-FLY-CHEAP;
www.1800flycheap.com) is owned by package-holiday megalith MyTravel
and so has especially good access to fares for sunny destinations. Air
Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is
based in Montreal and leverages the currently weak Canadian dollar for
low fares; it’ll also book trips to places that U.S. travel agents won’t
touch, such as Cuba.
Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but it does entitle you
to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and prompter service
if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or delayed, or if you
just want to change your seat. And you don’t have to fly to earn points;
frequent-flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing
your everyday shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs
on the market, consumers have never had more options. Investigate the
program details of your favorite airlines before you sink points into any
one. Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and,
of those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances, given
your most common routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your best
advantage, consult Randy Petersen’s Inside Flyer (www.insideflyer.
com). Petersen and friends review all the programs in detail and post reg-
ular updates on changes in policies and trends.

Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for www.expedia.co.uk and www.opodo.co.uk.) Each has differ-
ent business deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the
same flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will
also send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes avail-
able to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It pur-
ports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality only beats competitors’
fares as often as other sites do.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service such as Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia
to Chicago via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or
11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to
play their “name our price” game. Note: In 2004 Priceline added non-
opaque service to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact
flights, times, and airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid on 
opaque fares as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the air-
line sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. You
can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to Smarter
Travel (www.smartertravel.com), or you can go to each individual air-
line’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking, and
information on late-breaking bargains.

Chapter 5: Getting to Boston 49
Avoiding cabin fever
Whether you think of flying as an adventure or an ordeal, you’re probably not thrilled
by the prospect of a bone-dry cabin and a ration of personal space that would make
a sardine claustrophobic. (Imagine how I’d sound if I didn’t love flying.) Here are some
strategies that may make your trip more tolerable:
 Try to get a bulkhead seat, located in the front row of each cabin. These seats
usually offer the most legroom. Don’t storm forward just yet. Without a seat in front
of you, you must fit your carry-on bag into the overhead bin. The front row may
not be the best place to see the in-flight movie, and many airlines save these seats
for full-fare frequent fliers.
 Try to get a seat in the emergency-exit row. Like bulkhead seats, seats in the
emergency-exit rows also offer extra legroom. Ask when you check in whether
you can be seated in one of these rows; assignment is usually first-come, first-
served. You must be at least 15 years old and able to open the emergency exit
door and help direct traffic, if necessary.
 Wear comfortable clothes and dress in layers. The supposedly controlled cabin
climate can leave you sweltering or shivering. You’ll be glad to have a sweater or
jacket.
 Drink a lot of water. This task won’t make you any friends if you’re in a window
seat, but aisle-huggers won’t be sorry. Not only does your body stay hydrated, but
walking back and forth to the lavatory also helps keep your legs from cramping.
 Bring some toiletries on long flights. Take a travel-size bottle — no larger, or 
you may run afoul of Transportation Security Administration (www.tsa.gov) 
regulations — of moisturizer or lotion to refresh your face and hands at the end
of the flight. On an overnight flight, always pack a toothbrush. You’ll probably also
want some lip balm or petroleum jelly to keep your lips from cracking while you
sleep in the dry cabin. If you wear contact lenses, take them out before you board
or at least bring eye drops.
 Order a special meal if you have special dietary needs, or pack your own — a
good idea even before cutbacks made the in-flight meal an endangered species.
Most airlines can accommodate dietary restrictions, and nobody has to know that
your restriction is that you’re a picky eater. The airlines make special meals (veg-
etarian, kosher, and so on) to order, unlike the mass-produced chow they feed the
other passengers.
 If you’re flying with kids, pack chewing gum to help with ear-pressure problems.
Don’t forget diapers, toys, and a brand-new distraction (however small) — if a
meltdown’s looming, you want the element of surprise on your side.

Driving to Boston
The roads into Boston look perfectly manageable — on paper. But even
with the new roads created by the Big Dig, navigating downtown Boston
is no picnic. Highway access to the Boston area is good, however. If you
avoid rush hour and don’t venture all the way into town, your trip prob-
ably won’t be too awful.
The Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90), or Mass. Pike, is an east–west toll
road that runs from the New York border to East Boston. Exits are in
Cambridge, downtown, and at the airport. The main north–south route
through Boston is I-93, which extends north into New Hampshire. The
main north–south route on the East Coast is I-95, which detours around
Boston as a sort of beltway about 11 miles from downtown, where it’s
also known as Massachusetts Route 128.
Try not to approach downtown Boston from 7 to 9 a.m. and 3:30 to 
6:30 p.m. weekdays. Friday afternoon is especially problematic — make
sure that the car has plenty of gas and coolant. Here are some basic
directions for driving into Boston:
 From New York City, points south, and southwestern Connecticut,
you have several options. My favorite is to take the Hutchinson
River Parkway into Connecticut, where it becomes the Merritt/
Wilbur Cross Parkway. Note that you can’t use these roads if your
car has commercial plates. About 20 miles south of Hartford, follow
signs to I-91 north and take it to I-84 east. At Sturbridge, Massa-
chusetts, pick up I-90, the Mass. Pike. (I-95 from New York, a busy
truck route, is sometimes a bit faster.)
 From Vermont and western New Hampshire, take I-89 to Concord,
New Hampshire, and then I-93 south.
 From Maine and southeastern New Hampshire, take I-95 south to
Route 1 or I-93 south.
 From Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, you’re stuck with 
I-95. Where it intersects with I-93/Massachusetts 128, follow signs
to Braintree and Boston.
Taking the train to Boston
Amtrak (% 800-USA-RAIL or 617-482-3660; www.amtrak.com) runs to
Back Bay Station and South Station from the south and to North Station
from the north (Portland, Maine). Use Back Bay Station, on Dartmouth
Street across from the Copley Place mall, if you’re staying in the Back
Bay or the South End. Back Bay is also an Orange Line stop. Go to South
Station, on Atlantic Avenue near the waterfront, if you’re staying down-
town or in Cambridge. (South Station is also a Red Line subway stop.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Boston 
50

Airline-style booking strategies increasingly apply to train travel.
Booking far ahead usually lands you a discounted excursion fare.
Discounts don’t apply during high-volume times such as Friday after-
noon, Sunday afternoon, and periods around holidays.
Amtrak also operates Acela (www.acela.com) high-speed service on its
Northeast Corridor route, between Boston and Washington, D.C. Trip
time on the Washington–Boston route is just under six hours. Delays and
equipment problems have plagued Acela almost since its inception,
though; always call ahead to check the schedule before you run to catch
this train. Call Amtrak or check its Web site for more details, schedules,
and fares.
Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because tour operators buy packages in bulk and resell
them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a warehouse
club — except that the tour operator is the one who buys the 1,000-
count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a time at a cost that
undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for
lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell char-
ters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days
may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and
independent vacations; others allow you to add just a few excursions or
escorted day trips (also at discounted prices) without booking an
entirely escorted tour.
Details of packages to Boston don’t vary much, which makes compari-
son shopping relatively easy. Lodging options aren’t extensive, simply
because there aren’t that many places to stay — something some pack-
agers try to finesse by including hotels that are closer to New Hampshire
than to downtown Boston. The sightseeing component, if there is one,
usually is a free or discounted one-day trolley tour rather than a cus-
tomized offering.
Don’t automatically add a rental car to your package. If you use the car
every day and have access to free parking, it can be a good deal. If the car
sits in the hotel garage racking up parking fees, you’re wasting money.
On the other hand, an excursion to a suburb can be a worthwhile addi-
tion to your vacation. If time is short and you just can’t leave town with-
out seeing Plymouth (or Gloucester or another destination), paying
someone to handle the logistics of a half- or full-day trip may be worth
the money.
Chapter 5: Getting to Boston 51

To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.
libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast
and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers. Another travel behe-
moth, Gray Line (% 800-472-9546; www.grayline.com), offers pack-
ages that include a choice of a huge variety of full- and half-day escorted
tours to destinations throughout New England.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air-land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-654-6559; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), Midwest Airlines
Vacations (% 888-235-9693; www.midwestairlinesvacations.com),
United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com), and
US Airways Vacations (% 800-455-0123; www.usairwaysvacations.com).
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz,
Site59, and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If
you’re unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the
Better Business Bureau in the city where the company is based or go
online at www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based,
don’t fly with it.
If you live close enough to take advantage of Amtrak Vacations (% 800-
AMTRAK-2; www.amtrakvacations.com), you may find the train a rea-
sonable option. But don’t book a trip without at least checking your air
options. Also, don’t assume this choice is more reliable during bad
weather. Snow falls on train tracks, too.
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect during
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront, and in the case of
the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take
you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time
with the least amount of hassle.
The typical escorted tour that includes Boston bundles it with other
destinations, which may be as close as the suburbs or as far away as
coastal Maine. Whether it’s the “autumn color extravaganza,” the
“American history fiesta,” or some other wacky theme, the usual tour
seldom includes more than a day or two in Boston. If you hope to get to
know the city more than superficially, you’re probably better off with a
package deal (see the previous section).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Boston 
52

If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, there’s no reason to think it will fulfill its insurance obligations,
either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell you
more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the company cancel the trip
if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you’re
unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the company
cancels?
 How jampacked is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain
escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this information, because they may not know
the exact size of the group until everybody has made reservations,
but they should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum, and
the operator may cancel the tour if it doesn’t book enough people.
If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close the company is
to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their answers,
but the information may help you select a tour that’s sure to happen.
Chapter 5: Getting to Boston 53
A new leaf
Every fall, New England’s colorful trees exert a magnetic pull over millions of people.
Travelers sign up for bus tours that start and end in Boston and return home with the
false impression that they’ve seen the city. I’m not telling you to skip these tours, but
do consider this: Foliage season offers no guarantees. “Peak color” may not start or
end when you think it will, and insane traffic and gloomy weather may keep you from
making the best of your visit. If you’re lucky enough to get a flight to Boston in October,
consider making the city your base, keeping your itinerary flexible, and scheduling a
day trip or two — after you’ve seen the forecast — that includes some leaf-peeping.

 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. An excursion may include
a box lunch, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be included but not
wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you opt out of certain
activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with no exceptions?
Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you choose your entree
at dinner, or does everybody get the same chicken cutlet?
Literally hundreds of tour operators offer itineraries that include Boston.
On a busy fall weekend, out-of-state plates on lumbering buses are the
rule rather than the exception all over town. And every single bus seems
to wind up double-parked near the North End while the passengers
sprint across a crowded street under the direction of a guide who’s 
fretting because she’s already half an hour behind schedule.

O
ne-size-fits-all travel is a myth; all travelers, especially those with

with disabilities, and gay and lesbian travelers.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the
morning, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an
insurmountable challenge. But family travel can be immensely reward-
ing, giving you new ways of seeing the world through smaller pairs 
of eyes.
Families from around the world flock to Boston because many, if not
most, Boston-area activities appeal to children, and nearly every hotel
and restaurant caters to kids. Just getting around becomes a family
activity, because you’re bound to do a fair amount of hand-in-hand
strolling — a positive if walking tires the kids enough to make for an
early bedtime, but a negative if it does the same to you.
Some simple advice for family travelers: Give your kids a voice in the
planning process. Also, make sure that everyone knows what to expect.
(This suggestion is all too easy to forget even when you’re traveling only
with adults!) A huge part of Boston’s appeal is that it’s a working city,
not a theme park, but that’s no consolation to a child who thinks that
vacation always means roller coasters and cotton candy.

So give your children some time with this book and a not-too-
overwhelming assortment of other planning materials. (For a lesson 
in life skills, you can even ask your kids to lend a hand with the vacation
budgeting.) After everyone contributes suggestions, all of you will have
a better sense of what the other family members have in mind for your
Boston vacation.
Look for the Kid Friendly icon throughout this book for family-oriented
tips and activities.
Family-friendly flying
To make traveling more manageable, book a nonstop flight. If you can’t
book a nonstop flight, try to fly early in the day. If you can’t fly early in
the day, try to at least avoid booking the last flight of the day. A canceled
connecting flight may leave you stranded, especially in the winter, when
weather delays plague the entire East Coast.
If you fly, remember to pack chewing gum to help with ear-pressure
problems.
Keeping the kids entertained
Flying or not, pack diversionary materials and toys — crayons or mark-
ers, a deck of cards, computer game, MP3 player or personal stereo with
headphones, or a favorite book. Keep a surprise diversion in reserve.
These items are handy on the road and can buy weary parents some TV-
free downtime in the middle of a busy day in Boston.

Boston on the children’s bookshelf
Your kids may know more about these tiny slices of Boston than you do (or more than
you remember). Literally hundreds of children’s books about Boston are available. Here
are three of my favorites.
 Make Way for Ducklings, by Robert McCloskey. You may have lost count of how
many times you’ve read this one to your preschoolers. Adorable bronze render-
ings in the Public Garden illustrate the delightful story of the Mallard family.
 The Trumpet of the Swan, by E. B. White. He’s not as famous as Charlotte the
spider, but Louis the trumpeter swan has wonderful adventures in Boston. Like
the Mallard family, Louis frequents the Public Garden.
 Johnny Tremain, by Esther Forbes. This book offers a boy’s-eye view (with sev-
eral strong female characters) of events in Boston before the Revolutionary War.
Johnny’s interesting escapades make this book a painless introduction to the
people and history of the period — and a cracking-good story.

Relying on baby-sitting services
Don’t put off thinking about child care. I strongly recommend that you
book a sitter in advance — if possible, when you reserve your room.
Most hotels in the Boston area can recommend reliable baby sitters. If
you choose to use a child-care referral service, keep in mind that referral
fees are steep. If you’re in town on business, ask whether your host com-
pany has a corporate membership in a child-care referral service. If the
company does, you may be able to save some serious money. See “Fast
Facts: Boston,” in the Appendix, for details about the local agency
Parents in a Pinch.
Exploring Boston together
Be realistic. You may need to adjust your expectations to accommodate
your traveling companions’ short legs and shorter attention spans. Here
are three important reminders: Don’t try to do too much; don’t forget to
schedule some playtime; and don’t assume that more expensive is better.
 Prioritize. You probably have a sense of your sightseeing timetable
from the groundwork you laid at home. If your schedule isn’t set,
try this: Ask each child for a short list of top activity picks (no
more than three, and no make-or-break choices). Then ask each
child to select one activity from someone else’s list. This process
cuts down on the cries of “this wasn’t my idea.”
 Split up. Larger groups may consider splitting up for a while and
reuniting to swap notes over a family dinner. This idea works espe-
cially well if the children are far apart in age. For example, the
teenagers can explore the New England Aquarium while the younger
kids check out the Children’s Museum. This approach can help
keep the peace and keep everyone satisfied.
 Plan ahead. For more Boston-specific advice and listings, visit the
Web site of the Boston Parents Paper (http://boston.parenthood.
com). You can also find good family-oriented vacation advice on the
Internet from sites like the Family Travel Forum (www.family

tours and tour operators for families. 
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Many Boston-area businesses — including hotels, restaurants, museums,
and movie theaters — offer discounts to seniors who present valid iden-
tification. The cutoff age usually is 65 or (less often) 62.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 57

To get around Boston, seniors 65 and older are eligible to receive a
photo ID card that allows them to ride the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority) subways, local and express buses, commuter
rail, and Inner Harbor ferries for at least half off the regular fare. The
Senior Pass is available from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays at the Down-
town Crossing station and at the Office for Transportation Access, Back
Bay Station, 145 Dartmouth St. (% 617-222-5976 or 617-222-5854 [TTY];
www.mbta.com). Passes are no longer available by mail.
Mention the fact that you’re a senior when you make your travel reser-
vations. Although all the major U.S. airlines except America West have
canceled their senior discount and coupon book programs, many hotels
still offer discounts for seniors.
Always ask whether a business offers a senior discount. Restaurants and
theaters that extend discounts usually do so only during off-peak hours,
but museums and other attractions may charge reduced rates at all
times. Carry your driver’s license or other document that shows your
date of birth.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277;
www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and car rentals. AARP
offers members a wide range of benefits, including AARP: The Magazine
and a monthly newsletter. Anyone older than 50 can join.
An America the Beautiful Senior Pass from the National Park Service is
one of the best deals around. For $10, it gives you and up to three adults
traveling with you free admission to all properties administered by the
National Park Service, including parks, monuments, historic sites, recre-
ation areas, and wildlife refuges. The passport, which is good for your
lifetime, can pay for itself in one visit to the Boston area. For example, it
covers the Longfellow House in Cambridge and the Maritime National
Historic Site in Salem, among many other destinations. It’s available 
to citizens and permanent residents 62 and older at any Park Service 
site that charges an entrance fee. Besides free entry, an America the
Beautiful Senior Pass also offers a 50 percent discount on fees for such
activities as camping, swimming, parking, boat launching, and tours. 
For more information, go to www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm or call

Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 800-454-5768; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs for those ages 55 and older (and a spouse or companion of
any age) in the United States and in more than 80 countries around the
world. Most courses last five to seven days in the United States (two to
four weeks abroad), and many include airfare, accommodations in uni-
versity dormitories or modest inns, meals, and tuition. INTRAV (% 800-
456-8100; www.intrav.com) is a high-end tour operator that caters to
the mature, discerning traveler, not specifically seniors, with trips

Accessing Boston: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Boston is a generally accessible city, with some problematic exceptions.
Widespread construction and uneven walking surfaces can keep you
from getting around as quickly as you may like. I recommend that you
allow plenty of time to reach your destinations, especially near the con-
struction that has succeeded the Big Dig, which dominates downtown
between North Station and South Station.
The narrow streets, cobbled thoroughfares, and brick sidewalks that
make older neighborhoods like Beacon Hill and the North End so pictur-
esque can make navigation difficult. Fortunately, after you reach the
areas, almost all attractions are accessible. However, the upper levels of
some historic buildings — for example, the second floor of the Paul
Revere House — can’t accommodate wheelchairs. If you have severe
mobility issues, contact attractions in advance for accessibility 
information.
Many North End and Beacon Hill streets don’t allow buses and trolleys.
Motor tours touch on the edges of these neighborhoods, but the tours
don’t get up close. If you want to experience these areas, you must dis-
embark from public transit and venture out on your own. (Beware of
salespeople who try to tell you otherwise.) For example, the Paul Revere
House is 4 blocks from the closest trolley stop.
VSA Arts Massachusetts, 2 Boylston St., Boston, MA 02116 (% 617-350-
7713 or 617-350-6836 [TTY]; www.vsamass.org), is an excellent source
of information. The comprehensive Web site includes a searchable data-
base of general access information and specifics about more than 200
arts and entertainment facilities in the state.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 59

Most Boston-area lodgings comply with the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA), but the true level of accessibility can be harder to gauge
without asking some pointed questions. Be explicit about your needs
when you make your reservations. If you have a specific concern that a
certain hotel can’t address, the staff should be able to direct you to a
more appropriate establishment.
The Royal Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge (% 800-SONESTA) trains its 
staff in disability awareness; at the Westin Copley Place Boston (% 800-
WESTIN-1), 48 accessible rooms adjoin standard units.
Under the ADA, all forms of public transit must provide special services
to patrons with disabilities. Newer stations on the Red, Blue, and Orange
lines are wheelchair accessible, and the MBTA is in the process of con-

W
hat’s worse than the nagging feeling that you forgot something,
but you’re not sure what it is? Probably the sensation of remem-
bering what it was just as your plane leaves the ground.
This chapter attempts to relieve that sense of impending doom (or at
least inconvenience) with a roundup of topics that can simplify your
final planning.
For more information about money, budgeting, and cutting costs, turn to
Chapter 4.
Renting a Car — Or Not
If you visit Boston and Cambridge, you won’t have any problem getting
around without a car. Public transportation and your feet are reliable,
safe, and cheap. Parking is scarce and expensive — in both categories,
among the worst in the country. Traffic is dreadful, worsening the closer
you get to downtown, where a traffic jam can spring up at any hour of the
day or night. Boston drivers in particular are hostile and unpredictable.
If you drive to the Boston area, park at the hotel and save the car for day
trips. You can even arrange for the car to come to you: Some companies,
including Enterprise (% 800-261-7331), offer pickup and drop-off serv-
ice. If you decide to rent for a day or two, here’s the scoop:

Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the rental period, where and when you pick up and
drop off the car, where you drive, and a host of other factors. Asking a
few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars.
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you keep the
car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the daily
rate. Ask whether the rate is the same for pickup Friday morning as
Thursday night and whether you incur a penalty for early drop-off
of a weekly rental.
 Some companies may assess a drop-off charge. You may incur this
fee if you don’t return the car to the pickup location. National is
one of the few companies that doesn’t charge this fee.
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many companies add a fee for
drivers younger than 25 — or don’t rent to those drivers at all.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, be sure to
ask for that specific rate. If not, you may be charged the standard
(higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP,
and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle you to
upgrades or to discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite (or
most used) airlines likely to send you discount coupons, but most
car rentals add at least 500 miles to your account as well.
 Use the Internet to comparison-shop for a car rental. You can
check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. All the major
booking sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia
(www.expedia.com), Yahoo! Travel (www.travel.yahoo.com),
and Cheap Tickets (www.cheaptickets.com), for example — 
utilize search engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates.
Once you enter the size of the car you want, the pickup and return
dates, and the location, the site returns a price. You can even make
the reservation through any of these sites.
In addition to the standard rental prices, optional charges apply to most
car rentals (as do some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes). Many
credit-card companies cover the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW),
which frees you from having to pay for damage to the car in a collision.
Check with your credit-card company before you go so that you can
avoid paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day).
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your
luggage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at
home probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if
your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage. (Ask your
car-rental agent for more information.) Unless you’re toting around the
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 65

Hope diamond — and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk
anyway — you can probably skip the personal-effects insurance. How-
ever, driving around without liability or personal-accident coverage is
never a good idea; even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be,
and liability claims can be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for
your initial full tank of gas upfront and return the car with an empty gas
tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you don’t
get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this option, you
pay only for the gas you use, but you need to return your rental car with
a full tank or face charges of $3 to $4 a gallon for any shortfall. In my
experience, gas prices in the refueling packages are at the high end. I
usually forgo the refueling package and allow plenty of time for refueling
en route to the car-rental return. However, if you usually run late and a
refueling stop may make you miss your plane, you’re a perfect candidate
for the fuel-purchase option.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost
and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more than a
dozen companies. Here is my advice on all three types of travel insurance.
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel.
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies con-
sidered high-risk by AIG Travel Guard (www.travelguard.com).
Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance with a credit
card — by law, consumers can get their money back on goods and
services not received if they report the loss within 60 days after the
charge is listed on their credit-card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure that the tour company is a reputable one,
however: Some experts suggest you avoid buying insurance from
the tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s better
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Boston 
66

to buy from a “third-party” insurer than to put all your money in
one place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip 
doesn’t make sense for most travelers. Most existing health poli-
cies cover you if you get sick away from home — but check before
you go, particularly if you belong to an HMO.
 Lost-luggage insurance isn’t necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see
whether your homeowner’s policy covers your valuables or get
baggage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance
package. Don’t buy insurance at the airport, where it’s usually over-
priced. Be sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items with
you in your carry-on luggage — airline policies don’t cover many
valuables (including books, money, and electronics).
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended
insurers: Access America (% 800-729-6021; www.accessamerica.
com); AIG Travel Guard (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.
com); Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travel
insured.com); and Travelex Insurance Services (% 800-228-9792;
www.travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. (Of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you.)
For domestic trips, most reliable healthcare plans provide coverage if
you get sick away from home. See the Appendix for listings of local hos-
pitals. For information on purchasing additional medical insurance for
your trip, see the previous section of this chapter.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart 
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour 
hot line.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 67

Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
Staying in touch with the folks at home (or with each other) is much
easier these days thanks to the rapidly expanding cellphone networks
and various plans that give you plenty of unlimited minutes. Access to
the Internet from your phone or at hotel or public terminals (or from
your own laptop, using a wireless connection or dial-up modem) also
makes communicating while traveling much less complicated.
Using a cellphone across the United States
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it works else-
where in the country (thanks to our nation’s fragmented cellphone
system). But it’s a good bet that your phone works in major cities. To be
sure, look at your wireless company’s coverage map on its Web site
before heading out. The Boston area, including popular day-trip destina-
tions, is well wired; the only places you’re likely to encounter dead spots
are in the countryside.
If you’re not from the United States, you may be appalled at the poor
reach of our GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which
is used by much of the rest of the world. (To see where GSM phones
work in the United States, check out www.t-mobile.com/coverage).
Your phone probably works in most U.S. cities, but you may not be able
to send SMS (text messages) home. Assume nothing — call your wireless
provider and get the full scoop. In a worst-case scenario, you can always
rent a phone; InTouch Global (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.
com) delivers to hotels, but be aware that you’ll pay $1 a minute or more
for airtime.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Boston

Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis, or as it’s known in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome,” is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and
stretch your legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventive
measures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water, and
avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis, heart
disease, or another condition that puts you at high risk, some experts recommend
wearing compression stockings or taking anticoagulants when you fly; always ask
your physician about the best course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis
include leg pain or swelling, or even shortness of breath.

Using the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and surf the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop, PDA, or modem-
equipped electronic organizer gives you the most flexibility. Free and
paid wireless access is available throughout the area, even in several of
Boston’s parks.
Without Your Own Computer
Even if you don’t have your own computer, you can still gain access 
to your e-mail and even your office machine from copy shops and 
cybercafes.
Boston is home to surprisingly few cybercafes. It’s one of the most wired
cities in the country, which makes cybercafes less vital (and less numer-
ous) than they are in less-plugged-in areas. Why pay for access when it’s
free at work, school, and any number of other places? Tech Superpowers,
252 Newbury St., third floor (% 617-267-9716; www.newburyopen.net),
is both a cybercafe and the hub of the free-wireless paradise that is
upper Newbury Street (the Mass. Ave. end). Trident Booksellers & Café,
338 Newbury St. (% 617-267-8688; www.tridentbookscafe.com), is
part of Tech Superpowers’ upper Newbury Street free-wireless network.
Most youth hostels have at least one computer guests can use. And
most public libraries across the world offer Internet access free or for a
small charge. The Boston Public Library offers free wireless access, but
only to people with BPL library cards. Though it’s hardly a hangout,
FedEx Kinko’s (see the Appendix for addresses) is an option in many
neighborhoods. Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re willing to
pay exorbitant rates.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their concourses. These kiosks, which you also see in shopping malls,
hotel lobbies, and tourist information offices around the world, give you
basic Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cyber-
cafe prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high price mean that they should
be avoided whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with
Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com) or MSN Hotmail (www.hotmail.
com). Your home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-
based account automatically.
If you need to open files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to manipulate a distant PC from anywhere —
even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an always-on
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 69

connection to the Internet. The service offers top-quality security, but if
you’re worried about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a cyber-
cafe computer to tap into the GoToMyPC system.
With Your Own Computer
More and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless
fidelity (Wi-Fi) “hotspots” from where you can get high-speed connection
without cable wires, networking hardware, or a phone line. Mac owners
have their own networking technology, Apple AirPort. T-Mobile HotSpot
(www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up wireless connections at more
than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops nationwide. Boingo (www.boingo.com)
and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and
high-class hotel lobbies. IPass providers (see later) also give you access
to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby setups. To locate other hotspots
that provide free wireless networks in cities around the world, go to
www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
Eastern Massachusetts is a hotbed of free wireless access — some
Boston parks are even wired. Visit www.wififreespot.com for a com-
prehensive, well-maintained directory.
Where free access isn’t available, you’ll have to pay to get online. Most
business-class hotels throughout the world offer dataports for laptop
modems, and a few thousand hotels in the U.S. and Europe now offer
free high-speed Internet access. In addition, major Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) have local access numbers around the world, allowing
you to go online by simply placing a local call. The iPass network has
dial-up numbers in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up
with an iPass provider, who will then tell you how to set up your com-
puter for your destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.
ipass.com and click on “Individuals Buy Now.” One solid provider is
i2roam (www.i2roam.com; % 866-811-6209 or 920-235-0475). 
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’re fine
if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and two
hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an airline
employee, and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children younger than 18
don’t need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they
do for international flights to most countries.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Boston 
70

E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. With an E-ticket, you
can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks or
even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-in
involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, plugging in your reserva-
tion number, and printing your boarding pass — and the airline may
even offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier
card. Print your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the
security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking
bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you’re able to do so using most
airline kiosks. Even smaller airlines are employing the kiosk system, but
always call your airline to make sure that these alternatives are avail-
able. Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few
airlines still ban it; call before you go. Gate check-in is no longer an
option at U.S. airports.

Online traveler’s toolbox
Veteran travelers usually carry some essential items to make their trips easier.
Following is a selection of handy online tools to bookmark and use.
 Airplane seating and food. Find out which seats to reserve and which to avoid
(and more) on all major domestic airlines at www.seatguru.com. And check
out the type of meal (with photos) you’ll likely be served on airlines around the
world at www.airlinemeals.net.
 Foreign Languages for Travelers (www.travlang.com). Learn basic terms in
more than 70 languages and click any underlined phrase to hear what it sounds like.
 Intellicast.com (www.intellicast.com) and Weather.com (www.weather.
com). View weather forecasts for all 50 states and for cities around the world.
 Google Maps(http://local.google.com) and MapQuest (www.mapquest.
com). Mapping sites let you choose a specific address or destination, and in sec-
onds, you can view a map and detailed directions.
 Subway Navigator (www.subwaynavigator.com). Download subway maps
and get savvy advice on using subway systems in dozens of major cities around
the world.
 Time and Date (www.timeanddate.com). See what time (and day) it is any-
where in the world.
 Visa ATM Locator (www.visa.com), for locations of PLUS ATMs worldwide;
MasterCard ATM Locator (www.mastercard.com), for locations of Cirrus ATMs
worldwide; or NYCE ATM Locator (www.nycenet.com) for NYCE locations.

Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter, but some doozies remain.
If you have trouble standing for long periods, tell an airline employee;
the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing
metal objects such as big belt buckles. If you have metallic body parts, a
note from your doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screen-
ers. Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers are allowed past secu-
rity, except for folks escorting disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
liquids and gels are subject to ever-changing limits and regulations.
Bring food in your carry-on instead of checking it, because explosive-
detection machines used on checked luggage have been known to mis-
take food (especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in
the United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item”
such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all
sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still
considered a personal item. The Transportation Security Administration
(TSA) lists restricted items on its Web site (www.tsa.gov); check ahead
to avoid delays at security.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. “TSA recognized” luggage locks with a special code or
key allow screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching
is necessary. Brands include Travel Sentry (www.travelsentry.org)
and Safe Skies (www.safeskieslocks.com). For more information on
the locks, visit www.tsa.gov. If you use something other than TSA-
approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.

Part III
Settling Into Boston

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I help you get oriented with a look at Boston’s
airport, neighborhoods, and public-transit system. After
you know where you’re going and how to get there, I try to
make sure that you get enough sleep and some good food. I
explain the city’s lodging options and various ways of book-
ing a room so that you can choose a hotel that’s right for you.
You also get the lowdown on one of the liveliest restaurant
markets in the country.

B
oston’s streets appear to have minds of their own. They head off in
random directions, they change names at the drop of a Red Sox
cap, and an awful lot of them aren’t wearing signs. How can you find
your way around? Ask directions, for one thing. And remember: You
can’t get that lost.
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
This orientation to Boston begins at your arrival point. Whether 
you arrive by plane, train, or car, I tell you how to get to your next 
destination — your hotel.
If you arrive by plane
Logan International Airport is New England’s principal gateway to the
rest of the world, and it’s just as busy and crowded as that description
suggests. Given the general unpredictability of air travel and the region’s
volatile weather, you should always be ready for air and ground delays.
Logan has four terminals: A, B, C, and E (that’s not a typo — there’s no
Terminal D). Gates are on the upper level, and baggage claim and ground
transportation are on the first level. Terminal C has a shopping con-
course and children’s play space. Each terminal has an ATM, Internet
kiosks, a fax machine, and an information booth (near baggage claim).
The booth in Terminal C is a Visitor Service Center, where staffers can
arrange hotel and restaurant reservations, theater and sports tickets,
and tours.

The airport is in East Boston, 3 miles across the harbor from downtown.
Signs in the terminals indicate the curbside stops for each mode of
transportation (shuttle bus, taxi, and so on). Nearby tunnels connect
“Eastie” to downtown.
When traffic is heavy — rush hours, Sunday evening, any holiday 
period — or the weather is bad, public transportation is the fastest way
to reach downtown. If you have another destination, crossing the harbor
by boat or train and grabbing a cab can still be faster than driving.
The Massachusetts Port Authority (% 800-23-LOGAN; www.massport.
com/logan) coordinates airport transportation. The phone line has
information about getting to the city and suburbs. The line is open 24
hours a day, with live operators weekdays from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Taking public transportation to downtown Boston
Free airport shuttle buses run in a loop from 5:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily.
Number 11 runs terminal to terminal; numbers 22, 33, 55, and 66 connect
to public transit.
The quickest way to downtown is by water; crossing the harbor takes
just seven minutes and costs $10. The number 66 bus serves the airport
dock. The following companies serve the downtown waterfront and
other points around Boston Harbor: Boston Harbor Water Taxi (% 617-
593-9168), City Water Taxi (% 617-422-0392; www.citywatertaxi.com),
and Rowes Wharf Water Taxi (% 617-406-8584; www.roweswharf
watertaxi.com). The MBTA (% 617-222-6999; www.mbta.com) con-
tracts out scheduled ferry service to Harbor Express, which connects
the airport to Long Wharf, off Atlantic Avenue near the New England
Aquarium. If you’re leaving the airport and plan to take a water taxi, ask
the driver to radio ahead to let the operators know that passengers are
en route; on your way out of town, you must call from the dock for serv-
ice. Months and days of operation for water transportation are subject
to change; visit the airport Web site (www.massport.com/logan) or
check with individual companies for up-to-date information.
The T offers two fast options that can be more convenient than water
transportation.
The Silver Line bus connects all four airport terminals with South
Station, making this the most convenient way to go if your final destina-
tion is that part of downtown or Cambridge (South Station is a Red Line
subway stop). The trip takes about 20 minutes.
To reach Airport station on the Blue Line of the subway, take shuttle
number 22 or 33. Before 7 a.m. and after 10 p.m., number 55 covers both
routes.
State (for the Orange Line) and Government Center (for the Green Line)
are transfer points from the Blue Line. Transfers are free. Trips to
Government Center take ten minutes. The best way to reach Cambridge
Part III: Settling into Boston 
76

is the Silver Line (see earlier), but if you take the subway, switch to the
Green Line at Government Center, go one stop, and transfer at Park
Street to the Red Line.
Taking private transportation to your hotel
Taxis queue up at every terminal. The trip takes 10 to 45 minutes,
depending on traffic and time of day. The fare to downtown or the 
Back Bay should be about $22 to $30.
Cab companies pass along government charges to customers. At press
time, these charges included $6.50 in airport and tunnel fees. The meter
starts at $1.75, which means you’re out $8.25 before you even fasten
your seat belt (which you should always do). The surcharges seem to
jump every year or so — the staff at the information desk inside the ter-
minal can give you the total.
The Ted Williams Tunnel connects the airport to South Boston. On a
map, this path looks like a pricey detour, but it’s the fastest route to the
Back Bay and Cambridge. When traffic is bad, the tunnel is the best way
to parts of downtown, too.
For a list of private van services authorized to operate at the airport,
visit the Web site www.massport.com/logan. Prices start at $14 per
person. Call or surf ahead for reservations and exact fares.
To arrange limousine service, you must call ahead — drivers can’t 
cruise for fares. Ask whether your hotel recommends a company or 
try BostonCoach (% 800-672-7676; www.bostoncoach.com), Carey
Limousine Boston (% 800-336-4646 or 617-623-8700; www.carey.com),
or Commonwealth Limousine Service (% 800-558-LIMO outside
Massachusetts, or 617-787-5575; www.commonwealthlimo.com).
The major car-rental companies operate shuttles. If you must pick up a
car immediately, ask the staff to map out a route to your destination.
Make sure that you obtain directions for returning, too, but don’t worry
if you go astray — the main airport road is a loop.
If you arrive by car
If you’re staying downtown, call your hotel the day before you plan to
arrive to ask for directions and the latest traffic patterns. For Back Bay
hotels, take the Mass. Pike to the Copley exit. For Cambridge hotels, take
the Mass. Pike to the Allston/Cambridge exit.
If you arrive by train
South Station is a train and commuter rail terminal, bus station, and
subway stop at Atlantic Avenue and Summer Street. Cabs line up on
Atlantic Avenue.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 77

Back Bay Station is on Dartmouth Street between Huntington and
Columbus avenues. This station is the next-to-last Amtrak stop and
serves the Orange Line and commuter rail. Cabs line up on Dartmouth
Street.
North Station is on Causeway Street in the same building as the TD
Banknorth Garden. Amtrak trains from Portland, Maine, arrive at this
station, which also serves the commuter rail. Also here are the North
Station stops on the Green and Orange lines of the T. Cabs line up on
Causeway Street.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
The following neighborhoods contain the city’s main attractions. Most
are small and walkable, with loose boundaries and (except in the Back
Bay) confusing street patterns. Try to familiarize yourself with the city’s
layout by taking a look at the “Boston Neighborhoods” map in this chap-
ter. Then start wandering.
Considering Boston’s well-founded reputation as a city of neighbor-
hoods, the question of location is surprisingly easy to answer. The cen-
tral city is so tiny, and the neighborhoods so small, that the most
popular parts of Boston break neatly into two main sections. Spread out
the map in this section and find Boston Common. For your purposes,
downtown is north and east of this area, and the Back Bay is west and
south. Cambridge and slightly less central areas such as Brookline,
which I describe as “in the vicinity,” are the other major options.
Throughout the rest of the book, including the hotel listings (see
Chapter 9), the neighborhood designations given correspond to the
descriptions in this section. Here’s a rundown of the high and low points
of each area, including reasons you might want to stay there.
Downtown
I define downtown as the Waterfront, North End, Faneuil Hall Marketplace,
Government Center, Beacon Hill, Downtown Crossing, the Financial
District, and Charlestown. Here are descriptions of each:
 The Waterfront: Located along Commercial Street and Atlantic
Avenue, the Waterfront faces the Inner Harbor. Here you find the
New England Aquarium and the wharves that handle tour boats
and ferries. The South Boston waterfront, sometimes called the
Seaport District, runs perpendicular to the downtown waterfront,
on the other side of the Fort Point Channel along Northern Avenue
and Seaport Boulevard. This area is home to the convention center,
Institute of Contemporary Art, and Children’s Museum.
 North End: The Freedom Trail runs through the North End, which
lies east of I-93. No longer separated from the rest of downtown by
Part III: Settling into Boston 
78

an elevated highway (thanks to the Big Dig), the North End is easy
to reach. The longtime immigrant enclave maintains a reputation as
the city’s Italian neighborhood (which the locals never call “Little
Italy”), but these days, newcomers to the North End outnumber
Italian-American residents. The Paul Revere House and the Old
North Church are here.
 Faneuil Hall Marketplace: Where the North End meets the Water-
front, cross Atlantic Avenue to find Faneuil Hall Marketplace (also
called Quincy Market, the name of the central building). This
tourist magnet abounds with shops, restaurants, and bars.
 Government Center: This cluster of ugly city, state, and federal
office buildings is across Congress Street from Faneuil Hall.
 Beacon Hill: Rest your eyes with a stroll around Beacon Hill, the
architectural treasure that rises between Government Center,
Boston Common, and the river. If you conjure a mental picture of
Boston, it probably includes Beacon Hill’s Federal-style homes and
red-brick sidewalks.
 Downtown Crossing: This shopping and business district is across
Boston Common from Beacon Hill, adjacent to Chinatown. Most of
the Freedom Trail stops are in this area.
 Financial District: The Financial District lies east of Downtown
Crossing and west of the Waterfront. The area’s giant office towers
loom over the landmark Custom House and the colorful clock
tower.
 Charlestown: Home to the last two stops on the Freedom Trail,
Charlestown lies across the Inner Harbor from the North End.
Advantages to staying downtown include
 Easy access to many popular attractions and business destinations.
 Convenient public transportation.
 The lively atmosphere, especially during the day and around
Faneuil Hall Marketplace.
Drawbacks include
 The distance from the Back Bay and Cambridge. Factor in the time
and cost of getting back and forth.
 The less-than-lively atmosphere at night, particularly in areas that
aren’t near Faneuil Hall.
 The Big Dig. Gone but hardly forgotten, the Big Dig has given way to
a sizable construction area as buildings and parks spring up to
replace the ugly elevated Expressway that came down in 2005.

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

The Back Bay
For my purposes, “the Back Bay” covers hotels in the centrally located
neighborhoods outside downtown, including the Back Bay proper. The
other neighborhoods I lump in are (working east to west) Chinatown, the
Theater District, the South End, and Kenmore Square. This area is a safe
one, with the exception of the parks and a small part of the Theater
District, where you should be cautious at night. Incidentally, Boston has
no “midtown” or “uptown.”
The neighborhood Bostonians know as the Back Bay starts at the Public
Garden and the river and extends, approximately, to Massachusetts
Avenue (or Mass. Ave.) — though some say to Kenmore Square — and
Huntington Avenue. One of New England’s prime shopping destinations,
particularly on Newbury and Boylston streets, this area has a posh air
but also abounds with budget-conscious students. Trinity Church, the
Boston Public Library, the Hancock Tower, Copley Place, the Prudential
Center, and the Hynes Convention Center also are in this area.
Remember “two if by sea”? Incredibly, the Back Bay was the “sea.” (In
the Longfellow poem, Paul Revere watched the steeple of the Old North
Church for a signal telling him whether to alert the Minutemen to watch
for British troops approaching over land — one lantern — or by water —
two lanterns.) In 1775, when British troops set out for Lexington and
Concord, present-day Charles Street (between Boston Common and the
Public Garden) was the shoreline. This neighborhood was a marshy
body of water until 1835, when development began pushing west from
downtown. The Back Bay attained its current contours by 1882.
Chinatown is a congested area where you find an enormous assortment
of Asian restaurants and shops. This neighborhood lies south of Down-
town Crossing and west of I-93. The Theater District, a small area around
the intersection of Tremont and Stuart streets, holds Boston’s largest
professional theaters. Widespread sprucing-up notwithstanding, it’s not
a great area to wander around late at night.
Victorian brownstones distinguish the South End, which lies south of
the Back Bay proper. The landmark district underwent extensive gentrifi-
cation, beginning in the 1970s. The South End has a large gay community
and some of the best restaurants in the city.
At Beacon Street and Comm. Ave., Kenmore Square spreads out below
an enormous white-and-red Citgo sign, one of the city skyline’s most
famous features. Fenway Park lies 3 blocks away.
Here are some of the perks of staying in this area:
 The abundance of hotel rooms and the range of prices.
 Decent public transportation. The creaky Green Line is no prize,
but the Orange Line isn’t bad. The bus to Cambridge runs along
Massachusetts Avenue, better known as Mass. Ave.
 Everything you need to shop ’til you drop.

Here are some of the drawbacks:
 The need to commute to the downtown attractions.
 The inconvenience of getting to Cambridge (the subway can be
slow, the bus slower).
 Everything you need to shop ’til you drop.
Cambridge
The Red Line of the subway cuts through the city known (but only to the
tourist office) as Boston’s “Left Bank.” Harvard Square — where you
find upscale shops, historic landmarks, and, oh yeah, a big university —
is the most popular destination. The city’s other world-famous institu-
tion is Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in and around
Kendall Square. Central Square, a rapidly gentrifying area that abounds
with ethnic restaurants and clubs, lies between the two. Porter Square,
where you find quirky shops like those that once characterized Harvard
Square, is one stop past Harvard.
Harvard Square offers a good mix of transit access, sightseeing, and
shopping. This isn’t a typical bohemian college town but a generally
expensive area that centers on the Harvard T stop. The train station sits
beneath the intersection of John F. Kennedy Street, Brattle Street, and
Mass. Ave. Moving away from the train station, things grow quieter; the
peaceful Charles River is nearby. Downtown Boston is a 15- to 20-minute
subway ride away, and the Back Bay is approximately 30 minutes away
on the Mass. Ave. bus.
Pluses of staying in Cambridge include:
 The energetic, student-oriented atmosphere.
 Good public transportation.
 Excellent shopping and sightseeing options.
Drawbacks include:
 The price of lodging.
 Crowds of students, shoppers, and sightseers.
 The commute to Boston attractions.
In the vicinity
If busier, more centrally located areas aren’t for you, consider staying a
little farther out. The large town of Brookline begins just past Kenmore
Square. Prices are generally lower, and life is less rushed, but most of the
popular attractions are less convenient. Without a car, you’ll essentially
be a commuter (it’s 15–30 minutes to downtown), usually on the ancient
Green Line. (One hotel in this area, the Doubletree Guest Suites, isn’t on a
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83

public-transit line.) Check a map — only spoiled Bostonians seriously
think of this area as out-of-the-way, but Brookline can feel inconvenient,
especially at night and when you’re spending a lot of time in Cambridge.
Good reasons to stay in the vicinity include:
 Generally lower prices.
 A more residential, less frantic atmosphere.
 Easy access to the Back Bay and Fenway Park.
Drawbacks include:
 The distance from most of the top attractions.
 The necessity of relying on the Green Line.
 The inconvenience of getting to Cambridge, unless you rent a car.
Finding Information After You Arrive
Make your first stop the concierge desk or front desk of your hotel. Many
hotels have racks full of brochures and other information.
The Boston National Historical Park Visitor Center, 15 State St. (% 617-
242-5642; www.nps.gov/bost), across the street from the Old State
House and the State Street T station, is another good resource. The
center is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except January 1, Thanksgiving 
Day, and December 25. You can find other information centers at the 
following locations; the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau
(% 888-SEE-BOSTON or 617-536-4100) operates the first two:
 The Boston Common Information Center, 146 Tremont St., on the
Common (open 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Mon–Sat, 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Sun); this is
the starting point of the Freedom Trail.
 The Prudential Information Center, on the main level of the Pru-
dential Center, is open 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday,
11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday.
 At Faneuil Hall Marketplace, between Quincy Market and the
South Market Building, a small booth is staffed in spring, summer,
and fall 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, noon to 6 p.m.
Sunday.
 In the heart of Harvard Square, in Cambridge, a kiosk (% 617-497-
1630) near the T entrance at Mass. Ave. and John F. Kennedy Street
is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday, 1 to 5 p.m.
Sunday.

Getting Around Boston
Some people consider an African safari an adventure. Others say white-
water rafting in the Rockies is a daring experience. Still others, perhaps
overdramatic but no less serious, call driving in downtown Boston the
scariest thing they do.
Congestion, construction, unmarked streets — Boston has it all. My goal
is to scare you into walking everywhere. (How am I doing so far?) But
sometimes you can’t — destinations are too far, or you’re too tired or
running late. This chapter contains pointers for getting from place to
place by foot and, because you may need to take another means of
transportation, by subway, bus, boat, taxi, and car — all without steer-
ing you into adventure territory.
On foot
You packed your good walking shoes, right? The compact size and baf-
fling layout of the central city make it a pedestrian’s pleasure. Every-
where you turn, something picturesque catches your attention, and not
being in a speeding vehicle means that you can check out sights for as
long as you like.
Here are some trekking tips to keep in mind:
 The only steep areas are Beacon Hill and Copp’s Hill, in the North
End behind the Old North Church.
 All over town, brick and cobblestone sidewalks ripple gently, just
waiting to trip you and mess up the heels of your good shoes. Step
carefully.
 The Back Bay is the only neighborhood laid out in a grid. The cross
streets begin at the Public Garden with Arlington Street and pro-
ceed alphabetically (until Mass. Ave. jumps in after Hereford).
 At many downtown intersections, the timing mechanism that con-
trols the traffic light allows pedestrians just 7 seconds to walk
(sprint, really) across. Ignore the jaywalking locals, and stay put
until the light changes.
 Always look both ways before crossing — careless drivers, bikers,
and skaters blithely ignore one-way signs.
By public transit
The full name of the T is the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority,
or MBTA (% 800-392-6100 or 617-222-3200; www.mbta.com). The system
operates subway lines, surface transit, trains to the suburbs, and Inner
Harbor ferries. Call the main information number for round-the-clock
automated information and assistance from live operators 6:30 a.m. to 
8 p.m. Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends. Visit the
Web site to view maps and schedules.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

You’ll hear subway stops called “T stops,” “T stations,” and just “T,” as 
in “I’ll meet you near the Government Center T.” If someone gives you
directions that include a subway ride, be sure you know which exit to
use (most stations have more than one).
On subways and buses, up to two kids younger than age 11 accompa-
nied by a paying adult ride free. 
The fare-collection system
In 2007, the MBTA completed the transition to an automated fare-collection
system, replacing tokens and passes with CharlieCards and Charlie-
Tickets. The new payment methods are available at subway stations and
local merchants. Visit the Web site www.mbta.com for locations or to
order online, or request a CharlieCard at the first subway station you
use. You can add money at the vending machines near the entrance to
each station.
The plastic CharlieCard contains a “smart” chip that allows the user to
tap the card on the reader (a black rectangle on the subway turnstile or
the trolley or bus fare box) and enter or board immediately. To use the
paper CharlieTicket, the passenger inserts the ticket into the turnstile
or fare-box reader, then waits a moment for the device to return the
ticket — and pays a surcharge for the privilege. LinkPasses good for one
day, one week, and one month cost $9, $15, and $59, respectively; you
load the value directly onto your CharlieCard or CharlieTicket at a vend-
ing machine. The one-day and one-week passes cover the subway, local
bus, Inner Harbor ferries, and Zone 1A of the commuter rail; monthly
passes are good for the subway and local bus only. Taking $9 worth of
rides in one day requires doing little else, but the one-week pass is a
good deal.
The subway and trolley systems
Red, Orange, and Blue Line subways and Green Line trolleys, which
cover most areas you’re likely to visit, are the quickest nonpedestrian
ways to get around. The T is generally dependable and safe, with a
couple of caveats: The Green Line is sometimes unreliable, and you
should take the precautions (such as watching out for pickpockets) 
that you would on any big-city transit system.
The local fare is $1.70 with a CharlieCard, $2 with a CharlieTicket; trans-
fers to the local bus are free.
The T operates from about 5:15 a.m. until at least 12:30 a.m., but no later
than 1 a.m. On New Year’s Eve, service is free after 8 p.m. and shuts
down at 2 a.m.
The antiquated Green Line, which serves many areas of interest to visi-
tors, is the most complicated. When riding the Green Line, make sure
that you know which branch (B, C, D, or E) you need. Each starts and
ends at a different station; all four serve every stop between Government

Center and Copley. If you take the wrong westbound train, you may need
to backtrack and switch lines; ask the conductor to leave you at the right
stop.
System maps, available on request from T employees at most stations,
display the subway lines (in the designated colors) and the commuter
rail (in purple). The maps in this book also show subway stops. To get
route and fare information before your visit, check the Web site.
Renovations are underway to make the Green Line wheelchair accessi-
ble. Updated system maps show accessible stations on other lines, but
not all stations display up-to-date maps. (Check the date, if you can find
one.) To find out more, call the main information number (% 800-392-
6100 or 617-222-3200), or contact the Office for Transportation Access
(% 617-222-5976 or 617-222-5854 [TTY]; www.mbta.com). Also see
Chapter 6 for more information on getting around.
Check a map that shows T stations superimposed on a street map before
automatically hopping on the subway to get around downtown. South
Station to Aquarium, for example, is a three-train trip but an easy ten-
minute walk.
The bus system
T buses and trackless trolleys (electricity-powered buses) serve Boston,
Cambridge, and other nearby suburbs. The local fare is $1.25 with a
CharlieCard, $1.50 with a CharlieTicket or cash. Transfers to another
local bus are free if you pay with a CharlieCard or CharlieTicket, but not
if you pay cash. Express-bus fares start at $2.80, which includes a trans-
fer to the subway if you use a CharlieCard. Buses with wheelchair lifts
cover many routes; call % 800-LIFT-BUS for information.
Here are local routes you may find useful:
 Number 1, along Mass. Ave. from Dudley Station in Roxbury
through the Back Bay and Cambridge to Harvard Square. During
off-peak hours, this route is usually faster than the subway.
 Numbers 92 and 93, between Haymarket and Charlestown.
Freedom Trail walkers may be too tired for anything except the
bus, but the ferry (see the following section, “The ferry system”) is
more fun.
 Number 77, along Mass. Ave. north of Harvard Square to Porter
Square, North Cambridge, and Arlington.
The ferry system
Water-transportation options change periodically, according to demand
and other factors. The most useful route for visitors connects Long
Wharf, on State Street near Atlantic Avenue, with the Charlestown Navy
Yard; this is a good break from the Freedom Trail. The fare is $1.70; the

conversion to automated fare collection is scheduled for 2007. Call 
% 617-227-4321 or visit www.mbta.com for more information.
By taxi
Taxis are pricey and can be tough to hail. At busy times such as rush
hours and early morning (when bars and clubs are closing), you 
shouldn’t have much trouble — the drivers go where the business is.
Otherwise, find a cabstand or call a dispatcher.
Cabs line up near hotels and at designated stands. You’ll find cabs queu-
ing at Faneuil Hall Marketplace (on North Street and on State Street),
South Station, Back Bay Station, and on two stretches of Mass. Ave. in
Harvard Square — near Brattle Street and near Dunster Street.
If the hour is late and you’re desperate, look in front of a 24-hour busi-
ness such as Dunkin’ Donuts.
To call ahead for a cab, try the Independent Taxi Operators Association
(% 617-426-8700; www.itoataxi.com), Boston Cab (% 617-536-5010),
Town Taxi (% 617-536-5000), or Metro Cab (% 617-782-5500; www.
boston-cab.com). In Cambridge, call Ambassador Brattle (% 617-492-
1100) or Yellow Cab (% 617-547-3000). Boston Cab can dispatch a
wheelchair-accessible vehicle; advance notice of an hour or so is 
recommended.
The drop rate (the rate for the first 1⁄4 mile) is $1.75. After that, the fare
adds up at 30¢ per 1⁄8 mile. Wait time (the time the driver waits for you) is
extra, and the passenger pays all tolls, as well as $6.50 in fees (which
include the tunnel toll) on trips leaving Logan Airport. The law forbids
charging a flat rate within Boston. If you need a cab to a suburb, the
driver will charge you the price on the Police Department’s list of flat
rates (and show the list to you if you ask).
Cabs licensed in Boston are painted mostly white. Strenuously enforced
regulations call for acceptable maintenance of vehicle and driver.
Always, always ask for a receipt, which should state the name of the
company. And always fasten your seatbelt. If you lose something or want
to report a problem, call the Police Department (% 617-536-8294).
By car
Driving is not a good idea, but sometimes you have no choice. Start by
buckling up, even if you never do at home. No kidding.
When you reach Boston or Cambridge, park the car and then walk or use
public transportation. Do all you can to stay off the roads during rush
hours and weekend afternoons. Make sure that you have a map and, if
possible, a cool-headed navigator. Most streets are one-way, and your
out-of-state plates make you more of a moving target than an object of
sympathy.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 89

Be alert — no snacks or phone calls. Watch out for cars that change
lanes or leave the curb without signaling. Look both ways at intersec-
tions, even on one-way streets. Also keep an eye out for wrong-way 
bicyclists.
You may turn right at a red light after stopping when traffic permits,
unless a sign says otherwise. Seatbelts are mandatory for adults and
children; children younger than 12 must ride in the back seat; and
infants and children younger than 5 must be strapped into car seats.
Under state law, pedestrians in the crosswalk have the right of way, and
vehicles already in a rotary (traffic circle or roundabout) have the right
of way. Most suburbs post and enforce the crosswalk law; signs state the
right-of-way law in every rotary, with little discernible effect.
Had enough? It’s time for the round-the-clock headache of parking.
Meters regulate most street spaces, where nonresidents may park for no
more than two hours (sometimes much less), and only between 8 a.m.
and 6 p.m. The penalty is at least a $40 ticket, and parking-enforcement
officers work long hours every day except Sunday. Most Boston and
Cambridge meters take quarters only. In busy areas, that quarter buys
you only 15 minutes — start hoarding now.
To see whether your “missing” car is in the city tow lot, call % 617-635-
3900. Make sure that you have your wallet, because the fines and fees
can easily top $100. Then take a taxi to 200 Frontage Rd., South Boston,
or ride the Red Line to Andrew and flag a cab.
A parking lot or garage is easier but still no prize. The daily rate down-
town, reputedly tops in the country, can be as much as $45; hourly rates
(as much as $18) are outrageous, too. Weekends and evenings usually
are cheaper. Many establishments discount weekday rates if you enter
and exit before certain times. Some restaurants have deals with nearby
garages; ask when you make your reservation.
Prices are slightly lower than public-lot rates at the city-operated garage
under Boston Common (% 617-954-2096). The entrance is on Charles
Street between Boylston and Beacon streets. The Prudential Center
garage (% 617-236-3060) offers a discount if you make a purchase at the
Shops at Prudential Center and have your ticket validated. Enter from
Boylston Street, Huntington Avenue, Exeter Street, or Dalton Street (at
the Sheraton Boston Hotel). The Copley Place garage (% 617-375-4488)
extends a discount to shoppers, too. The garage is off Huntington
Avenue near Exeter Street. Many Faneuil Hall Marketplace shops and
restaurants validate parking at the 75 State St. garage (% 617-742-7275).
Other good-sized garages are at Government Center off Congress Street
(% 617-227-0385), Sudbury Street off Congress Street (% 617-973-
6954), the New England Aquarium (% 617-367-3847), Zero Post Office
Square (% 617-423-1500), and near the Hynes Convention Center on
Dalton Street (% 617-421-9484).
Part III: Settling into Boston

Harvard Square is even less hospitable to motorists than downtown
Boston. The congested area has a few costly garages and parking lots,
and many tow-away zones disguised as tempting university spaces. Be
patient, and have a backup plan and budget in case you don’t find a
metered space (maximum stay, 30 minutes–two hours).
Parking is free on North Harvard Street and Western Avenue, on the
Boston side of the Charles River near Harvard Business School. Harvard
Square is some distance away (use the bridge at Memorial Drive and
John F. Kennedy Street), but it’s not a bad walk, and the price is right.

Best Hotels

S
ome people book a room by calling a hotel, asking for a reservation,
and agreeing to the price the clerk quotes. These people also pay
sticker price for their cars. That won’t be you, though, because this
chapter shows you how to find the best hotel rates.
The Boston area offers travelers many options. Although prices tend to
be high, amenities and service are good, and just about every property
is in excellent shape. The options that suit your wishes and wallet are
out there. This chapter helps you find the landing pad that’s right for you.
Getting to Know Your Options
The Boston area offers a full range of accommodations, but not in the
same abundant numbers as other destinations. At busy times, you may
find yourself on the business end of a tough lesson about the law of
supply and demand. Here’s a look at what to expect.
The Goldilocks factor: What hotel feels right?
Giant chain hotels tend to be well appointed, centrally located, and
somewhat boring. But don’t reflexively dismiss the chains — the bene-
fits of size include a larger supply of rooms and a wider range of prices.
The listings in this chapter include some agreeable choices, and the sub-
urbs boast plenty of reliable options as well. (See the Appendix for a list
of the major chains’ toll-free numbers and Web sites.)
Independent hotels tend to compare favorably with the megachains,
with less of a cookie-cutter feel and more personal service. These smaller
establishments can’t compete with chains in every area, though, so

know which features are most important to you. (If you must swim a mile
every morning, even remarkable service won’t make an on-premises
pool materialize.)
This chapter also lists some motels, inns, and guesthouses. These
smaller properties tend to be less conveniently located, less luxurious,
and less expensive than larger establishments. If all you want is a comfy
place to rest your head, this choice can be just right.
The only truly underrepresented category of lodging in the immediate
Boston area is moderately priced family-oriented chains; they gravitate
toward suburbs with less expensive real estate. You won’t even find the
strip of cheap motels that’s under the flight path of most other airports
(in Boston, that’s in the harbor).
See Chapter 8 for descriptions of the neighborhoods in these listings.
Indexes of the properties by neighborhood and price appear at the end
of this chapter.
The ABCs of B&Bs
A room at a bed-and-breakfast can be a viable alternative to a hotel
room, especially if money is tight (though some properties are just as
opulent and pricey as plush hotels). Your best bet is to use an agency
that specializes in B&Bs. Here are some reliable choices:
 Bed and Breakfast Agency of Boston (% 800-248-9262 or 617-720-
3540; % 0800-89-5128 from the U.K.; www.boston-bnbagency.com)
 Bed & Breakfast Reservations North Shore/Greater Boston/Cape
Cod (% 800-832-2632 outside Massachusetts, 617-964-1606, or 978-
281-9505; www.bbreserve.com)
 Bed and Breakfast Associates Bay Colony (% 888-486-6018 or
781-449-5302; % 08-234-7113 from the U.K.; www.bnbboston.com)
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency-exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Boston’s Best Hotels 93

Smart shopping
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them, how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering business toward
that hotel.) A package tour may include a cheaper room than you can
book on your own. See Chapter 5 for information about package tours.
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number, and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rises and falls. See the calendar of events in Chapter 3 for information
about citywide events that may drive up prices. And note that even
within a given season, room prices are subject to change without notice,
so the rates quoted in this book may be different from the rate you
receive when you make your reservation.
The most expensive time to book a room in Boston is fall foliage season,
followed closely by summer, which begins with college-graduation
season in May. New England weather makes January through March the
only truly slow season, especially if conditions are cold and snowy. (A
mild winter can be surprisingly busy.) The hospitality industry aims its
midwinter “Boston Overnight! Just for the Fun of It” campaign largely at
suburban weekenders, but travelers from farther away can take advan-
tage of discounts, too. Check the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors
Bureau Web site (www.bostonusa.com) for information.
Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, or
any other corporate rewards programs you can think of — or your hon-
orary membership in Uncle Joe’s Elks lodge, for that matter — when you
call to book. You never know when the affiliation may be worth a few dol-
lars off your room rate, especially if you try this approach: Ask for the
price and then mention the status that qualifies you for a discount.
Boston and Cambridge levy a 12.45 percent room tax. When you make
your reservation, be sure to ask whether the quoted rate includes taxes.
Package rates generally do. The rate in Brookline is just 9.7 percent, but
don’t choose a hotel based on that — the savings are negligible and
probably don’t offset the extra transportation costs.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Travelers generally shop online for hotels in one of two ways: through
the hotel’s or chain’s own Web site or through an independent booking
Part III: Settling Into Boston 
94

agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). Many hotel and chain
Web sites guarantee that their prices are the lowest available. Meanwhile,
mind-boggling numbers of Internet agencies compete for the business of
millions of consumers surfing for accommodations around the world.
This competition can be a boon to consumers who have the patience
and time to shop and compare the online sites for good deals — but
shop they must, because prices can vary considerably from site to site.
And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing may be there for
no other reason than that they paid for the placement.
Turn to Chapter 5 for a description of package tours, which can 
save you big bucks even at the busiest times. You’ll want to compare
aggressively — the prices for virtually identical packages can vary from
operator to operator (or hotel chain, airline, or other packager) by hun-
dreds of dollars.
The “big three” sites all post unvarnished customer reviews, distinguish-
ing themselves with bells and whistles such as Orbitz’s links to Frommer’s
reviews, Travelocity’s property rankings (according to the AAA rating
system), and Expedia’s “virtual tours.” Also reliable are Hotels.com and
Quikbook.com. TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.com) and Kayak (www.
kayak.com) can help you search multiple hotel sites at once, even ones
you may never have heard of. Travelweb (www.travelweb.com) is
partly owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt, and
Starwood chains) and is therefore plugged directly into the hotels’ reser-
vations systems — unlike independent online agencies, which may have
to fax or e-mail the hotel their reservation requests. If you choose to
book a room through any of these Web sites, consider calling the hotel
to confirm your reservation. More than once, travelers who booked
rooms online have arrived at the hotel only to be told that they have no
reservation. And always get a confirmation number and print a copy of
any online booking transaction.
What some establishments consider “convenient to downtown Boston”
is downright laughable. Before booking anything, plot the hotel on a
mapping site (not the booking site), and check out the route and travel
time to an attraction or restaurant that interests you. 
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline (which is affiliated with
Travelweb) and Hotwire are even better for hotels than for airfares; with
both, you pick the neighborhood and quality level of your hotel before
offering up your money. Priceline’s hotel product even covers Europe
and Asia, though it’s much better at getting five-star lodging for three-
star prices than at finding anything at the bottom of the scale. On the
downside, many hotels stick Priceline guests in their least desirable
rooms. Be sure to go to the BiddingForTravel Web site (www.bidding
fortravel.com) before bidding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features
a fairly up-to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both
Priceline and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Boston’s Best Hotels 95

Note: Some hotels do not provide loyalty program credits or points or
other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room through opaque
online services.
The Web sites of the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau
(www.bostonusa.com) and the Massachusetts Office of Travel and
Tourism (www.massvacation.com) offer searchable databases and
secure online reservations. But don’t book through either site until you
do enough shopping to know that you’re getting a competitive price.
Reserving the best room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two pointed questions
can go a long way toward making sure that you get the best room in 
the house.
 Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t
always cost more.
 Request a room on a high floor. Upper floors often hold club- or
concierge-level rooms; if you don’t want to pay for extra features,
ask for the highest standard floor.
 Ask whether the hotel is renovating. If it is, request a room away
from the construction work.
 Inquire, too, about the location of the restaurants, bars, and
discos in the hotel. All are sources of annoying noise.
If you need a room where you can smoke, be sure to request one when
you reserve. If you can’t bear the lingering smell of smoke, tell everyone
who handles your reservation that you need a smoke-free room or floor.
Smoking is illegal in just about every public place in Massachusetts,
which means that smokers often retreat to their hotel rooms to light up.
Finally, if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, return to
the front desk right away. If another room is available, the staff should
be able to accommodate you, within reason.
Arriving without a Reservation
You didn’t make arrangements in advance? If it’s foliage or graduation
season, hang your head. Let it droop all the way down to the floor of the
airport terminal, because that may be where you spend the night. Or
stand up straight and try one or more of the following strategies:
 Call the Hotel Hot Line (% 800-777-6001). A service of the Greater
Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau, it can help with reservations
even during the busiest times. People, not recordings, handle calls
until 8 p.m. weekdays, 4 p.m. weekends.
Part III: Settling Into Boston 
96

 If you’re at the airport, head to the Visitor Service Center in
Terminal C. Staff members with concierge training can lend a hand.
 Phone hotels from the airport or train station. Ask everyone 
you reach who doesn’t have a room available to suggest another
property.
 If you drive from the west, stop at the Massachusetts Turnpike’s
Natick rest area, and try the reservation service at the visitor
information center.
 Call a B&B referral agency and ask whether any properties have
cancellations. (See “The ABCs of B&Bs,” earlier in this chapter, for
details.)
 Rent a car and head for the suburbs. Although not being down-
town is inconvenient, many lodgings lie within commuting distance.
If you have a favorite chain, call the toll-free reservations number
for information about Boston-area locations and tips for reaching
the properties from the airport.
Boston’s Best Hotels
Although I complain about Boston’s limited lodging choices, keeping this
list to a manageable size is difficult. The hotels in this chapter are my
favorites, the ones I suggest when friends call to ask for recommenda-
tions. Although I list my top picks, these lodgings are by no means the
only acceptable choices. Near the end of this chapter, I also include
options that can be helpful if you find my favorites booked. I also include
indexes that list hotels by neighborhood and price.
Each listing in this chapter includes a $ symbol that indicates the price
range of the hotel’s rack rates. Prices are for a standard double room for
one night, not including taxes. The following table explains what to
expect in each price range:

These establishments generally don’t

places are more centrally located, and
some offer access to pools or fitness
rooms. (Ask whether an extra charge
applies.) In a less competitive market,
most would be inns and family-run motels.
In Boston, many are part of moderately
priced chains.
$$$
$226–$325
Now things get confusing. In this range, the
repeat business customer is the gold stan-
dard, and these hotels cater to that market.
Rooms tend to be decent-sized and well
appointed, with abundant business ameni-
ties. Each hotel offers a range of perks and
facilities, but every property defines essen-
tial differently. For example, some don’t pro-
vide minibars or swimming pools. Ask
about features that matter to you.
$$$$
$326 and up
Here, you find tycoons, international trav-
elers whose currency is strong against
the dollar, and honeymooners. Expect
everything you’d get at a $$$ hotel, deliv-
ered to your huge room by an employee
who calls you by your name and can’t do
enough for you, plus such extras as cour-
tesy cars and personal office equipment.
In Boston’s tight market, a hotel that doesn’t offer every imaginable 
perk can still get away with charging breathtaking prices. The feature
that’s most likely to be missing in the $$$ and $$$$ price ranges is an 
on-premises health club with a pool. They don’t all offer 24-hour room
service, and many of these costly properties either don’t have wireless
Internet access or charge extra (as much as $15 a day) for it. If a certain
amenity is crucial to you, be sure to ask about it.
This icon indicates hotels that are especially family-friendly. Most of
these accommodations have swimming pools, some offer family pack-
ages (usually on weekends), and all supply their all-ages clientele with
plenty of patience and good advice. Bear in mind that every hotel in town
accommodates children’s needs; a listing without this symbol doesn’t
mean “kid-unfriendly.” Most properties allow kids to stay free with their
parents, but the cutoff age varies. Always ask when you’re booking.

Every hotel in this chapter is clean and safe. As I said, I’d send a friend
to any one of these properties — but I wouldn’t send every friend to
every one. These hotels all offer TVs and air-conditioning; almost all
rooms have phones and private bathrooms. And all are within walking
distance of the T.
Anthony’s Town House
$
In the Vicinity (Brookline)
The Green Line runs past Anthony’s Town House, embodying the pluses
and minuses of this well-kept, old-fashioned brownstone. The trolley is
handy, but the street is busy and can be noisy. The price is great, but you
don’t get your own bathroom or phone. Each floor holds one bathroom
and three good-sized rooms with high ceilings, TVs, and air-conditioning;
units that face the street are larger but less quiet. The agreeable residen-
tial neighborhood lies about a mile from Boston’s Kenmore Square and 15
to 20 minutes from downtown.

Boston Harbor Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Downtown (Waterfront)
This luxurious edifice overlooking the harbor is one of the finest hotels
downtown. It offers every perk or appointment you may want or need —
from easy access to the airport (by water taxi from the dock out back) to
top-of-the-line business and fitness facilities, including a 60-foot lap pool.
Guest rooms are spacious and plush, with traditional mahogany furniture
and great views. The hotel has a restaurant that focuses on food and wine
pairings and a lobby cafe that offers seasonal outdoor dining.

Chandler Inn Hotel
$$
Back Bay (South End)
You can’t beat this location at this price. The rooms and bathrooms are
comfortable but small — a real-estate ad may say “cozy,” which is accu-
rate in this case. The contemporary-style rooms contain queen-size or
double beds or two twin beds and have hair dryers and climate control.
The location is convenient, and the staff is accommodating and friendly.
This property is the largest gay-owned hotel in town, and the inn is popu-
lar with bargain hunters of all persuasions. Fritz, the bar off the lobby, is
a lively neighborhood hangout.

$$$–$$$$
Cambridge
The most prestigious short-term address in Cambridge, The Charles rep-
resents an appealing contrast of sleek, contemporary style and luxurious
appointments. In a great location off Harvard Square, the hotel offers large
rooms with Shaker-style furnishings and indulgent extras such as a Bose
Wave radio in every room and a TV in each bathroom. Room rates include
access to the pool and facilities at the adjacent WellBridge Health and
Fitness Center. The pool sets aside time each afternoon for children
younger than 16. The hotel complex also includes a posh day spa; two
excellent restaurants; and the Regattabar, one of the best jazz clubs in the
area (see Chapter 16).

Charlesmark Hotel
$–$$$
Back Bay (Copley Square)
A great location and reasonable prices make the Charlesmark a prime
example of a lodging style I call “budget boutique.” The hotel has a wel-
coming staff and a high comfort level without a lot of the extras that can
drive up the bill at larger lodgings. Although the rooms in the renovated
1886 building are small, thoughtful design and sleek custom furnishings —
such as pillow-top mattresses and tons of built-ins — make them feel
bigger. Rates include breakfast, local phone calls, use of the computer and
printer in the second-floor lobby, and light refreshments (such as bottled
water and fruit) available at all hours.

Back Bay
The Copley Plaza is classic Boston: a stately, old-fashioned luxury hotel
that evokes an era of grand accommodations, excellent service, and ornate
architecture. The Edwardian elegance of the 1912 building belies the up-to-
date features of the large guest rooms, which contain every perk you can

nishings. The hotel, which completed a $34-million overhaul in 2004, has
two restaurants, two bars, a business center, and a fitness center (but no
pool).

Four Seasons Hotel
$$$$
Back Bay
This hotel is the best in New England. You may stay here at the same time
as a movie star, CEO, rock legend, or head of state, and (here’s the key)
the superior staff makes you feel as important as the celebrities. The
accommodations, amenities, business center, health club, and restaurants
are all top of the line. The bill is, too. The second-floor restaurant,
Aujourd’hui, is one of Boston’s best, and the Bristol, off the lobby, serves
a celebrated afternoon tea (as well as breakfast, lunch, and dinner).

rates: $425–$650 and up. Ask about weekend packages. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Harvard Square Hotel
$$–$$$
Cambridge
Comfortable and unpretentious, this well-maintained hotel occupies a
great location that makes up for the lack of bells and whistles. In the heart
of Harvard Square, the hotel is a good place to retreat after a day of sight-
seeing, visiting a student, or doing business. Rooms aren’t large, and at the
busiest times, they’re expensive for what you get. This hotel is not the
place for coddled business travelers, but the low-key atmosphere makes
it a good alternative to pricier competitors in the area.
See map p. 106. 110 Mount Auburn St. (at Eliot Street). % 800-458-5886 or 617-864-
5200. Fax: 617-864-2409. www.harvardsquarehotel.com. 73 units. T: Harvard
(Red Line); follow Brattle Street 2 blocks, bear left onto Eliot Street, and go 1 block.
Parking: $35. Rack rates: $129–$269. Ask about corporate, AAA, and AARP discounts.

Hilton Boston Back Bay
$$–$$$$
Back Bay
A business hotel with terrific weekend packages, the Hilton offers a full
range of chain amenities in a handy location across the street from the
Prudential Center complex. The hotel is near the Back Bay action but not
right at the center — which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The large, con-
temporary rooms are quite plush; units on higher floors offer excellent
Chapter 9: Checking In at Boston’s Best Hotels 101

views. The hotel has a swimming pool and 24-hour health club, a restau-
rant, and a bar.
See map p. 104. 40 Dalton St. (off Boylston Street at Belvidere Street, opposite the
Hynes Convention Center). % 800-874-0663, 800-HILTONS, or 617-236-1100. Fax:
617-867-6104. www.bostonbackbay.hilton.com. 385 units. T: Hynes/ICA (Green
Line B, C, or D); turn left onto Mass. Ave. and left onto Boylston Street, take the 1st
right onto Dalton Street, and walk 2 blocks. Parking: Valet $36; self $20. Rack rates:
$149–$399 and up. Ask about packages and AAA discounts. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport
$–$$$$
In the Vicinity (Logan Airport)
An airport hotel that courts a business clientele may not seem a logical
choice for sightseers, but the airport Hilton is a sensible option for both
types of travelers. It offers proximity to downtown, good access to public
transit, and fine weekend packages. The spacious, quiet guest rooms con-
tain plentiful business perks. A health club with a lap pool is off the lobby;
the hotel has a restaurant, a pub that serves lunch and dinner, and a coffee
bar. The 24-hour shuttle bus serves all airport destinations, including car-
rental offices and the ferry dock.
See map p. 104. 85 Terminal Rd., Logan International Airport (between Terminal A [a
short walk] and Terminal E [a long walk]). % 800-HILTONS or 617-568-6700. Fax:

Parking: Valet $30; self $26. Rack rates: $99–$399 and up. Ask about weekend and
other packages. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Holiday Inn Boston Brookline
$$–$$$
In the Vicinity (Brookline)
A pleasant residential setting and good access to downtown make this
Holiday Inn a reasonable alternative to hotels that are more convenient
but more expensive. The large, well-maintained guest rooms offer no sur-
prises (pleasant or unpleasant) — basically, this is an agreeable chain
hotel. The inn has a small indoor pool, whirlpool, and exercise room. The
Green Line stops out front; downtown Boston is about 15 minutes away.
Coolidge Corner, a nongeneric shopping destination, is a five-minute walk
away.
See map p. 104. 1200 Beacon St. (at St. Paul Street). % 800-HOLIDAY or 617-277-1200.
Fax: 617-734-6991. www.holiday-inn.com. 225 units. T: St. Paul (Green Line C).
Parking: $15. Rack rates: $149–$229 and up. Ask about AAA and AARP discounts. AE,
DC, DISC, MC, V.
Hotel Commonwealth
$$$–$$$$
Back Bay (Kenmore Square)
The Commonwealth’s traditional facade belies its ultra-plush interior and
great business features. Although it looks older, it opened in 2003, just a
stone’s throw from Boston University and Fenway Park. It’s more centrally
Part III: Settling Into Boston 
102

located than the nearby all-suite Eliot Hotel, which is more romantic and
generally more expensive. Units that overlook Comm. Ave. each have a
heavy curtain that guests can pull across the center of the room, separat-
ing the bed from the “parlor.” Smaller Fenway rooms face the Mass. Pike
and the ballpark. The hotel has two restaurants, a shopping arcade, and an
exercise room.
See map p. 104. 500 Commonwealth Ave. (at Kenmore Street). % 866-784-4000 or
617-933-5000. Fax: 617-266-6888. www.hotelcommonwealth.com. 150 units. T:
Kenmore (Green Line B, C, D); left at turnstiles. Parking: Valet $34. Rack rates:
$249–$389 and up. Ask about packages and AAA discount. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Hotel 140
$–$$
Back Bay
Small rooms at small prices are the selling point of this conveniently
located hotel on three upper floors of a 14-story building. The contempo-
rary style of the rooms — each holds a double or a twin bed — suits the
no-frills atmosphere and the crash-and-dash clientele of leisure and busi-
ness travelers. Room rates include continental breakfast; it’s quite a deal,
especially for this neighborhood. The 1929 building, a former YWCA, is
also home to a cafe, a theater, a high school, and residences.
See map p. 104. 140 Clarendon St. (at Stuart Street). % 800-714-0140 or 617-585-5600.
Fax: 617-585-5699. www.hotel140.com. 40 units. T: Back Bay (Orange Line); exit
onto Dartmouth Street, turn right, go 1 block, turn right and follow Stuart Street 1
block. Parking: $18 in nearby garage. Rack rates: $109–$179 and up. AE, MC, V.
Longwood Inn
$
In the Vicinity (Brookline)
This Victorian guesthouse in a quiet residential area projects a homey feel
to go with affordable rates. Seventeen units include private bathrooms,
and all rooms have air-conditioning and phones. Guests may use the fully
equipped kitchen and common dining room, coin laundry, and TV lounge.
An apartment, which sleeps four, has a private kitchen and balcony. The
tennis courts, running track, and playground at the school next door are
open to the public.
See map p. 104. 123 Longwood Ave. %617-566-8615.Fax: 617-738-1070. www.longwood-
inn.com. 22 units. T: Longwood (Green Line D); turn left, walk a half-block to
Longwood Avenue, turn right, and walk 2 1⁄2 blocks. Or Coolidge Corner (Green Line C);
walk 1 block south on Harvard Street (past Trader Joe’s), turn left, and go 2 blocks on
Longwood Avenue. Parking: Free. Rack rates: $109–$129 ($99–$139 for 1-bedroom
apartment). Ask about winter discounts. No credit cards.
Marriott Residence Inn Boston Harbor
$$
Downtown (Charlestown)
Location, amenities, and value make the Residence Inn a real find, despite
its somewhat generic vibe. On the Freedom Trail adjacent to the Charles-
town Navy Yard, the hotel consists of studio and one- and two-bedroom

suites with full kitchens; you may not even need to use your kitchen,
because room rates include breakfast. Views are excellent all the way from
the lobby, where you find the lap pool and fitness room, up to the eighth
(top) floor. Patrons tend to be business travelers on weeknights and fam-
ilies on weekends. The location is even better from April to October, when
the water taxi (from $10 one-way) connects the dock off the lobby with
more than a dozen stops around the harbor.
See map p. 104. 33–44 Charles River Ave. (off Chelsea Street, near Rutherford
Avenue). % 866-296-2297, 800-331-3131 (Marriott), or 617-242-9000. Fax: 617/242-5554.

Aquarium and ferry from Long Wharf to Navy Yard; exit through main gate and walk
1 block. Or Green or Orange Line to North Station; follow Causeway Street 2 blocks
south (with TD Banknorth Garden on your left) to North Washington Street, turn left,
and cross bridge; hotel is on the right (total walking time 10 minutes). Or Orange Line
to Community College; cross Rutherford Avenue using pedestrian bridge, turn right,
and go 2 long blocks (past City Square Park; total walking time 10 minutes). Parking:
Valet $25. Rack rates: $179–$209. Ask about packages and AAA, government, long-
term, and winter discounts. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
The MidTown Hotel
$–$$$
Back Bay
This two-story establishment near the Prudential Center is a good deal for
motorists — parking costs about one-third as much here as at other hotels
in the neighborhood. The rooms are large and attractively outfitted in con-
temporary style, but bathrooms are small. Business travelers have easy
access to the Hynes Convention Center; families can ask for adjoining
rooms with connecting doors. The hotel’s popularity with tour groups and
convention-goers is a potential drawback, as is the busy street — rooms
on the Huntington Avenue side of the low-rise building can be a little noisy.
The heated outdoor pool is open from Memorial Day through Labor Day.
See map p. 104. 220 Huntington Ave. (at Cumberland Street, near Mass. Ave.).

units. T: Symphony (Green Line E); from the corner diagonally across from Symphony
Hall, walk 1 block on Huntington Avenue. Or Mass. Ave. (Orange Line); turn left, walk
2 blocks, turn right, and go 1 block on Huntington Avenue. Parking: $12. Rack rates:
$119–$259 and up. Ask about AAA, AARP, and government-employee discounts. AE,
DC, DISC, MC, V.
Newbury Guest House
$$
Back Bay
Considering its location, the Newbury Guest House is a bargain. In a pair
of renovated 19th-century town houses, it has a comfortable atmosphere
and helpful staff. Rooms are modest in size but thoughtfully appointed and
mercifully quiet. Rates include a buffet breakfast served in the ground-level
dining room, which adjoins a brick patio. This B&B operates near capac-
ity all year; reserve early.

(Green Line); follow Dartmouth Street 1 block away from Copley Square (past Old
South Church), turn left on Newbury Street, and go 2 1⁄2 blocks. Or Hynes/ICA (Green
Line B, C, or D); exit onto Newbury Street and walk away from Mass. Ave. for 2 1⁄2
blocks. Parking: $15 (reservation required). Rack rates: $140–$195. Minimum 2 nights
on weekends. Ask about winter discounts. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Onyx Hotel
$$–$$$
Downtown (North Station)
A drab side street near North Station is the unlikely location of this con-
temporary boutique hotel, part of the chic Kimpton group. The medium-
sized rooms, decorated in rich jewel tones, feel bigger because they have
high ceilings. Units on higher floors of the ten-story building afford intrigu-
ing city views. The rapidly improving neighborhood sits within walking
distance of downtown and Beacon Hill. The Onyx has a lobby lounge and
a basement exercise room.
See map p. 104 155 Portland St. (off Causeway Street). % 866-660-6699, 800-KIMPTON,
or 617-557-9955. Fax: 617-557-0005. www.onyxhotel.com. 112 units. T: North Station
(Green or Orange Line); with TD Banknorth Garden on your right, follow Causeway
Street to Portland Street, turn left, and go a half-block. Parking: Valet $32. Rack rates:
$209–$329 double. Ask about packages and AARP and AAA discounts. AE, DC, DISC,
MC, V.
Radisson Hotel Boston
$$–$$$$
Back Bay (Theater District)
The central location, business features, and relatively reasonable rates
make this Radisson popular with business and leisure travelers. The well-
maintained guest rooms are among the largest in the city; each opens onto
a private balcony, with terrific views from the higher floors. The hotel has
an indoor pool and exercise room. On the premises are a restaurant and
the Stuart Street Playhouse, a professional theater that usually presents
one-person and cabaret-style shows.
See map p. 104. 200 Stuart St. (at Charles Street South). % 800-333-3333 or 617-482-
1800. Fax: 617-451-2750. www.radisson.com. 356 units. T: Boylston (Green Line);
follow Tremont Street away from Boston Common 1 block, turn right onto Stuart
Street, and go 2 blocks. Or New England Medical Center (Orange Line); turn left, walk
a half-block, turn left, and go 3 blocks. Parking: Valet $30; self $28. Rack rates:
$159–$359. Ask about weekend and theater packages. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Sheraton Boston Hotel
$$–$$$$
Back Bay
The Sheraton courts three major markets with scads of meeting space and
features for convention-goers, well-outfitted rooms for business travelers,
and a gigantic indoor/outdoor pool with a retractable dome that’s a
magnet for vacationing families. Direct access to the Prudential Center
Chapter 9: Checking In at Boston’s Best Hotels 109

complex increases the hotel’s appeal to travelers of all stripes. Rooms are
fairly large, with pillow-top beds; bathrooms are medium-sized but (unless
you have a magazine named after you) better appointed than your bath-
room at home. Units on upper floors afford excellent views. The hotel has
a large, well-equipped health club, restaurant, and lounge.
See map p. 104. 39 Dalton St. (at Belvidere Street, between Huntington Avenue and
Boylston Street). %800-325-3535 or 617-236-2000. Fax: 617-236-1702. www.sheraton.
com. 1,181 units. T: Prudential (Green Line E); facing tower, bear left onto Belvidere
Street and walk 1 block. Or Hynes/ICA (Green Line B, C, or D); turn left onto Mass.
Ave. and left onto Boylston Street, take 1st right onto Dalton Street, and walk 2 blocks.
Parking: Valet $35; self $33. Rack rates: $129–$409 and up. Ask about weekend pack-
ages and student, faculty, and senior discounts. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Sheraton Commander Hotel
$$–$$$$
Cambridge
The Sheraton Commander’s low-key atmosphere appeals to guests who
find the Charles too trendy (and too pricey). The hotel’s well-kept guest
rooms are moderate in size and traditional in décor. A restaurant, cafe, and
small fitness center are on the premises. Harvard Yard is 4 blocks away.
See map p. 106. 16 Garden St. (at Waterhouse Street, opposite Cambridge Common).

north 1 or 2 blocks to Garden Street, turn left, and walk 4 blocks. Parking: Valet $18.
Rack rates: $129–$385 and up. Ask about weekend packages and AAA and AARP
discounts. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
The Westin Copley Place Boston
$$–$$$$
Back Bay
A giant chain hotel that doesn’t feel generic is a real find, and this is one
(the Sheraton Boston, mentioned earlier in this chapter, is another). In a
great location adjoining the Copley Place–Prudential Center complex, the
hotel has the full range of business amenities, plus an excellent health club
with a pool. Guest rooms are large and well appointed, and the views
(rooms are all above the seventh floor) are amazing. Two first-class restau-
rants, the Palm and Turner Fisheries, face the street at ground level; there’s
a lounge off the second-floor lobby.
See map p. 104. 10 Huntington Ave. (at Dartmouth Street, accessible through Copley
Place). % 800-WESTIN-1 or 617-262-9600. Fax: 617-424-7483. www.westin.com.
800 units. T: Copley (Green Line); walk 1 block on Dartmouth Street past the Boston
Public Library. Or Back Bay (Orange Line); walk 11⁄2 blocks on Dartmouth Street past
Copley Place. Parking: Valet $36. Rack rates: $179–$479 and up. Ask about weekend
packages. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.

Chapter 9: Checking In at Boston’s Best Hotels 111
Getting out of town: The 
suburban motel question
After you read the hotel listings in this chapter, you’ll have an idea of what you can
expect to pay for a stay at specific Boston properties. When your budget won’t allow
it, the notion of a moderately priced suburban chain hotel tends to arise. After all, stay-
ing outside the city is an excellent option in many other places. Whether it works for
you depends on your answers to the following questions:
 What season is it? You may land a great deal by heading for the ’burbs, but if you
plan to visit Boston during the foliage and graduation seasons, just finding a place
to stay somewhere in the state of Massachusetts can feel like a triumph.
 Do you mind commuting? You’ll likely drive or take the commuter rail (or both) to
downtown Boston. Before you reserve your room, nail down the specifics of the
journey, including prices (for train tickets and parking at the station), whether the
hotel operates a shuttle to the station, and how late and how often the train runs.
If it sounds like a hassle, try another place.
 How long will you be in the Boston area? A few extra days of vacation may mean
that you don’t mind spending some time commuting. In addition, not being stuck
downtown can make day-tripping easier.
 Are you behind the wheel? If you must drive, you may welcome the combination
of a chain hotel’s free parking (if offered) and driving yourself into the city.
 Are the kids with you? Their expectations may be entirely different from yours.
(A swimming pool, vending machines, and a game room were usually enough to
satisfy me and my siblings.) Talk to your kids before booking an expensive hotel
with business features youngsters don’t care about and easy access to activities
that have little appeal to kids.
 How deep are your pockets? An out-of-the-way location doesn’t necessarily
mean a deal. Account for hidden costs before you book a room. For example, if
you need to drive to Boston or Cambridge, parking fees can easily add $25 a day
to your travel expenses. If the “bargain” room rate saves $30 a day, that’s no deal.
If you opt for a suburban motel, check with your travel agent, pick one from a guide-

a room in the Boston area. (You can find contact information for hotels in the
Appendix.) Be sure you understand the definition of Boston area before you hang up
the phone — you can find motels as far away as Rhode Island and New Hampshire
that claim to be in the Boston area.

Dining and Snacking 
in Boston
In This Chapter
 Discovering the best local places
 Exploring the ethnic scene
 Grabbing a quick bite on the go
 Dishing up options by price, location, and cuisine
O
ut-of-towners ask the same question everywhere: Where do people
who live in Boston (or Paris or Seattle or Sioux City) go to eat? This
chapter offers an overview of the local dining scene. For more informa-
tion about local cuisine, see Chapter 2.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
New England cuisine abounds with seafood and local produce, but
there’s no particular “Boston style.” Thanks to constant turnover,
though, every chef in town seems to have supervised or worked for
nearly every other chef. Many kitchens show signs of similar influences,
particularly in the mingling of ethnic elements and ingredients.
Boston has shaken a reputation for stodgy food and stodgier restau-
rants, even among hard-core snobs and wannabe New Yorkers. Pockets
of Gotham-esque see-and-be-seen action enliven the market in various
neighborhoods. The hottest places as I write (they could be different as
you read) are Toro, 1704 Washington St., South End (% 617-536-4300);
Bin 26 Enoteca, 26 Charles St., Beacon Hill (% 617-723-5939; www.
bin26.com); and the 24-hour Miel Brasserie Provençale, in the Inter-
Continental Boston hotel, 510 Atlantic Ave., downtown waterfront 
(% 617-217-5151; www.intercontinentalboston.com).
As in any city of neighborhoods, the local standby occupies an honored
place. Depending on the neighborhood, this dependable establishment
may be a pocket-sized bistro, an ethnic counter, a diner, or an elegant
dining room. I suggest a few here, but never dismiss a restaurant just

because you can’t find it in a guidebook. Your friends who can’t shut up
about the great place around the corner may be ahead of the curve.
You don’t need to know much else to pass for a local. Here’s a quick
cheat sheet:
 Book ahead for Friday or Saturday night at any restaurant that
takes reservations. If you know where you want to eat, try to call
before you leave home. If the night you want is booked, call when
you reach Boston and ask about cancellations. At lunch, a party of
two usually shouldn’t have trouble landing a table, but a reserva-
tion is a good idea for larger groups.
 Bostonians tend to eat early, even on weekends. Don’t count on
dropping in and getting a table at what seems to you to be an off-
peak hour. “Early” is 5:30 or 6 p.m., and “too late” can be as early as
9:30 p.m., especially in the winter, when business is slow.
 The state meal tax (which also applies to takeout food) is 5 percent.
 A few restaurants ask that men wear jackets at dinner, but most
restaurants have no formal dress code. At casual places near cam-
puses and in tourist areas, just about anything goes, particularly at
lunch. That includes shorts in the summer and jeans and sneakers
all year. At more upscale places, if you take the time to look pre-
sentable, you’ll fit in better, and the staff may even take you more
seriously. Save your breath — I’ve heard all the arguments. In
theory, yes, you should get the same treatment whether you’re in
footie pajamas or a tux. Get over it.
 Some places let you eat at the bar without a reservation. The loca-
tion is not ideal, and the menu may have different choices from the
menu in the dining room, but eating in the bar can be a great option
if you’re desperate to check out a particular restaurant. Make sure
that the host or hostess knows you’re willing to move to a table if a
last-minute cancellation occurs.
 Finally, remember that smoking is illegal in all Massachusetts
workplaces, including restaurants. Take your filter-tipped little
friend outside — you won’t be alone.
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
Boston dining is terrific, but you’re not here just to eat. You’ll probably
want some cash left over for other activities.
The best cost-cutting move is to eat your big meal at lunch. Many restau-
rants serve dinner only, but the ones that open at midday (or even for
breakfast) offer great values at lunch.
Remember, many locals are students who arrive in Boston from all over
the world with lots of ambition and tuition, and often not much else.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Boston 117

When going out to eat, they’re willing to experiment but not to overpay.
Seek out a busy place near a campus when you’re looking for generous
portions and reasonable prices.
Other strategies include the following:
 Split an appetizer or dessert.
 Skip the alcohol.
 If possible, skip beverages altogether — those $4 Diet Cokes can
really add up.
 Order the fixed-price or prix-fixe menu (not available everywhere,
but always a good deal).
 Walk or take the T; valet parking can cost as much as $25.
 Plan a picnic for lunch and run up the bill at dinner.
A server who rattles off daily specials without prices may be busy or 
forgetful — or may be counting on your reluctance to look cheap in front
of your friends or family. Always ask, and no $23 plate of noodles (true
story) will ever sneak up on you. And if you’re with a large group (six,

The online world of dining is even more diverse than the real-world community, with an
unwieldy collection of amateurs, professionals, reviewers, bloggers, PR experts, and
other interested parties slinging wisdom and misinformation all over the virtual “place.”
Here are a few reliable sites you may find helpful as you make your culinary plans:
 Citysearch (http://boston.citysearch.com): Nearly encyclopedic, 
with a helpful search function. Editorial reviews tend not to be opinionated; 
user reviews range from indispensable to incomprehensible, and some are badly
out-of-date.
 OpenTable (www.OpenTable.com): Handles reservations for an impressive
variety of restaurants, mostly pricey but with a good smattering of more afford-
able places. Each reservation earns points; rack up enough and trade them in for
a voucher. If the restaurant is booked, check here — but also check directly with
the restaurant if OpenTable doesn’t have the date and time you want. 
 Chowhound (www.chowhound.com): A thriving food- and restaurant-obsessed
community known for its message boards; posters can get a little snippy, but the
enthusiastic (mostly) amateurs offer unvarnished reviews and even some insider
info.
 BostonChefs.com (www.BostonChefs.com): A helpful but by no means com-
prehensive resource. Menus, service info, and gorgeous food photography make
up for the almost comically uncritical write-ups of “member” restaurants.

eight, or more, depending on the restaurant), the check may include a
service charge, typically about 18 percent. Examine the total before acci-
dentally tipping twice.
A final thought: A fancy dinner every night can get old, even to a hard-
core foodie. Give yourself a break, dip into the less expensive categories,
and chow down.
Boston’s Best Restaurants
Hungry? If you’re not already, you probably will be soon. This section
lists and reviews my favorite restaurants. I also suggest neighborhoods
to seek out when you’re in the mood for something ethnic.
The Kid Friendly icon indicates restaurants that your family will like and
that will like your family. Most have children’s menus; all offer friendly
service and not-too-challenging fare that can make any homesick young-
ster feel a little more settled. (Adventurous palates will find reasonable
options, too.) As with hotels, the absence of the icon doesn’t necessarily
mean kids are unwelcome — but think twice if your youngsters tend to
get rambunctious. If you’re unsure, ask someone at the restaurant before
you make a reservation.
The dollar symbols ($) that accompany each review give an idea of the
price of dinner for one. That covers an appetizer, main course, dessert,
and one nonalcoholic drink, not including tax and tip. The listings also
include a price range (see Table 10-1) for main courses. The price ranges
are estimates — adjust accordingly if you order truffles, lobster, and
wine from Château d’Expensive, or if you split an appetizer, drink water,
stick to pasta, and skip dessert.

fine-dining mecca, but The Blue Room is a revelation: The kitchen grills,
roasts, and braises up a storm, creating gutsy, flavorful food in a sleek but
comfortable setting. You’ll find the best roast chicken in town among the
inventive main courses, which always include admirable vegetarian
options. In warm weather, seating on the brick patio is available.

Bob’s Southern Bistro
$$
South End
AMERICAN
Exposed-brick walls and big windows create a sophisticated setting for
homey Southern food: “glorifried” chicken, meatloaf, pan-fried catfish, bar-
becued ribs, and more, served with your choice of two side dishes. I like the
mac-and-cheese and the collard greens; your friendly server can help you
decide. The décor evokes a jazz club, and that’s the soundtrack here — it’s
live Thursday though Saturday nights (when there’s a modest cover
charge) and at Sunday brunch.

Border Café
$$
Cambridge/Harvard Square
SOUTHWESTERN
Huge crowds don’t necessarily mean high quality — unless the crowds
have been huge for over two decades. The nonstop party at the Border
Café runs on heaping portions of Tex-Mex, Cajun, and occasionally
Caribbean food — and, of course, beer and margaritas. The cheerful but
frantic staff keeps the peace with plenty of chips and salsa. Except at off
hours, there are no quick meals (the wait for a table can stretch out), so
be in the mood to linger and join the party.

Traditional French brasserie fare (choucroute garnie, onion tart, shellfish
so fresh you want to slap it) contrasts deliciously with the sleek dining

Jo a tasty destination throughout the day.

Buddha’s Delight
$
Chinatown
VEGETARIAN/VIETNAMESE
It’s hard to believe that food this good is actually good for you. Buddha’s
Delight looks like a run-of-the-mill Asian restaurant, but it doesn’t serve
meat, poultry, fish, or dairy. (Some beverages contain condensed milk.)
Instead, the chefs transform tofu and gluten into chicken, pork, beef,
shrimp, and even lobster taste-alikes. Head here for bounteous portions of
unusual but delicious food. Try the delightful fresh spring roll appetizer,
then start experimenting.

Reservations not required. T: Chinatown (Orange Line); follow Washington Street
(past the China Trade Center) 1 block and turn left onto Beach Street. Main courses:
$6–$13. MC, V. Open: Sun–Thurs 11 a.m.–9:30 p.m.; Fri–Sat 11 a.m.–10:30 p.m.
Café Jaffa
$
Back Bay
MIDDLE EASTERN
Newbury and Boylston streets are consumer central, and the last thing you
want in the middle of a shopping spree is a meal that weighs you down —
physically or financially. Café Jaffa is a favorite with shoppers and stu-
dents, who come here for low prices, high quality, and good-sized portions.
Traditional Middle Eastern dishes such as falafel, baba ghanouj, and
hummus make a not-too-filling break from bargain hunting; kebabs (lamb,
beef, or chicken), burgers, and steak tips are heartier and equally tasty.
The exposed-brick, glass-fronted room makes a good setting for midafter-
noon coffee, too.
See map p. 120. 48 Gloucester St. (between Boylston and Newbury streets). % 617-
536-0230. Reservations not required. T: Hynes/ICA (Green Line B, C, or D); use Newbury

Casa Romero
$$$
Back Bay
CLASSIC MEXICAN
Hidden in an alley, Casa Romero is a romantic destination a stone’s throw
from busy Newbury Street. The peaceful atmosphere and dimly lit rooms
almost make the food secondary, but this food demands attention. The
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Boston 125

authentic cuisine is nothing like what you find at Tex-Mex drive-throughs —
the food is fresh, savory, and not too heavy. Unusual ingredients (cactus
salad is an unexpectedly good starter) and flavorful sauces make meat,
poultry, and seafood shine. The enclosed garden is pleasant in warm
weather.
See map p. 120. 30 Gloucester St. (off Newbury Street; entrance in alley). % 617-

Chacarero
$
Downtown
CHILEAN SANDWICHES
If you serve only one thing, that one thing had better be pretty darn good,
and the sandwiches here are scrumptious. You choose: small or large
(small is plenty) with one of five fillings — grilled or barbecued chicken,
grilled or barbecued beef, or vegetarian — on a homemade roll. For the
full experience, order yours “with everything,” which means tomatoes,
Muenster cheese, avocado, hot sauce, and green beans. Having started out
as a takeout window, Chacarero now occupies a small, colorful storefront
with limited seating and long lines at lunchtime. The sandwiches are worth
the wait.

Daily Catch
$$
North End
SEAFOOD AND SOUTHERN ITALIAN
For a true North End experience, try this tiny storefront under an awning
that reads “Calamari Café.” The open kitchen cranks out hearty, garlicky
food that often revolves around squid, right down to the garlic-and-oil
pasta sauce (which includes chopped calamari) and the black pasta (the
color comes from squid ink). The casual atmosphere — some dishes land
on the table still in the cooking skillet — is part of the fun.

Dalí
$$
Cambridge/Somerville
SPANISH
Appetizers with no main course make a good dinner-party menu at home —
and they can be even better at a restaurant. The main attraction at this
boisterous place is delectable tapas. The appetizer-like plates of hot or
cold meat, seafood, vegetables, and cheese are so tasty that you won’t

126

miss the big platter of one boring thing. Instead, you’ll want to ask for
another order or two of sausages, goat cheese, potato salad, salmon cro-
quettes, or whatever catches your fancy. The wait at the bar can be long,
but the atmosphere is festive and the payoff huge — unlike the bill. (A con-
ventional meal of Spanish classics will push the tab into $$$ territory.)

Durgin-Park
$$
Downtown
NEW ENGLAND
If you prefer hearty food and sassy service to fancy ingredients and unpro-
nounceable dishes, Durgin-Park is the classic New England experience.
Bostonians and out-of-towners come to the long, multiple-party tables
(smaller ones are available) for generous helpings of delicious, down-to-
earth fare. The cornbread and baked beans are famous, the prime rib and
fresh seafood are delicious, and the strawberry shortcake is as fresh as
some of the waitresses. That’s right — like a 19th-century theme restau-
rant, Durgin-Park (founded in 1827) has a shtick: borderline-belligerent
service. Many waitresses are actually quite pleasant, but a trip into the
orbit of someone who takes the gimmick seriously can be an eye-opening
experience.
See map p. 120. 340 Faneuil Hall Marketplace (in the North Market building). % 617-
227-2038. www.durgin-park.com. Reservations accepted for parties of 15 or

The Elephant Walk
$$$
Back Bay
FRENCH AND CAMBODIAN
The Elephant Walk is the worst-kept “secret” on the Boston culinary scene,
but it does feel like a great find. The unique combination of French and
Cambodian isn’t the mishmash that plagues fusion cuisine; rather, each
side of the menu stands alone and complements the other. On the French
side, you may find pan-seared filet mignon. On the Cambodian side, curry
de crevettes (yup, that’s French) is a perfect shrimp dish. The accommo-
dating staff offers excellent advice, and tofu can replace animal protein in
many dishes.

Giacomo’s Ristorante
$$
North End
SEAFOOD AND SOUTHERN ITALIAN
For pure inconvenience — long lines, no credit cards, improbably cramped
space — you’ll have a hard time beating Giacomo’s. So why the crowds?
You can’t beat the food. Go early, before the queue gets too long. Check
the board for outstanding daily specials, take the chef’s advice, or create
your own dish from the list of ingredients and sauces. Salmon with sun-
dried tomatoes over fettuccine is my favorite, but I’ve never had anything
short of fabulous. Portions are large, and even dainty eaters who declare
themselves stuffed can’t help trying just one more mouthful.

Grill 23 & Bar
$$$$
Back Bay
AMERICAN
The best steakhouse in Boston earns that title with an irresistible mix of
macho atmosphere and splendid food. Grill 23 is a favorite business des-
tination with a raucous crowd that always seems to have sealed a deal min-
utes before. If they’re smart, the young (and old) turks give a moment’s
thought to their plates. The steak and chops are magnificent, and the more
inventive options — for example, top-notch meatloaf — are equally satis-
fying but not as Flintstones-like. As at any self-respecting steakhouse, the
side dishes (à la carte) and desserts are diet-busting delights.

The Helmand
$$
Cambridge/Kendall Square
AFGHAN
In Cambridge’s United Nations of dining, The Helmand stands out. This
restaurant offers the tasty food, friendly service, and reasonable prices for
an ethnic restaurant in an elegant setting that may make you wonder what
the catch is. (The Helmand is too popular, would be my grumpy answer.)
Afghan cuisine is Middle Eastern with Indian and Pakistani influences, fill-
ing but not heavy, redolent of spices. Vegetarians will be happy; meat
accents many dishes instead of dominating, and many meatless choices
are available. My pick is baked pumpkin with meat sauce, but it’s hard to
settle on one favorite — everything is flat-out delicious.

Icarus
$$$$
South End
ECLECTIC
This subterranean hideaway is the most romantic restaurant in town (an
insanely competitive category), a grand space that abounds with personal
touches like mismatched chairs and antique lighting. The regularly chang-
ing menu is equally quirky and equally enjoyable. Chef and owner
Christopher Douglass simply transforms his fresh local ingredients. The
no-nonsense descriptions (lemony grilled chicken with garlic and herbs, or
polenta with braised exotic mushrooms) can’t do justice to the imaginative
interplay of flavors and textures. Save room for an unbelievable dessert;
even chocolate fiends love the fruit sorbets.

As newcomers push the North End up the nouveau scale, neighborhood

NEW ENGLAND AND FRENCH
Diners disappear into this elegant 19th-century town house like guests
arriving at a dinner party, and in a way, that’s just what they are (well,
except for the pesky matter of money). The gorgeous dining rooms make
a lovely backdrop for chef-owner Frank McClelland’s innovative, deliri-
ously good food. French techniques and fresh local ingredients — seafood,
game, unusual produce, artisan cheeses — collide to produce unusual
dishes that never cross the line into brain-teaser territory. The dessert
cart is worth a look, and this is one of the best places in town to check out
the after-dinner cheese tray.

sine is an artful mix of local ingredients and bistro favorites, such as
braised lamb shank with garlic purée. The quirky neighborhood (techni-
cally, the Leather District) attracts business lunchers and a stylish dinner
crowd that lingers for live jazz in its own dining room.

Piccola Venezia probably loses some business because of its location: on
the first block of the North End’s main drag. Banish “maybe we’ll find
something better” from your mind — you won’t be sorry. The menu com-
bines home-style specialties with less red-sauce-intensive options, all in
generous quantities. To give you some idea of the scope, tripe is a house
specialty, polenta with mushrooms is a great starter, and a recent special
of seafood lasagna made a delectable dinner and a filling lunch the next
day. It’s a cliché, but spaghetti and meatballs is a good choice, too.

(lunch menu Mon–Sat until 3 p.m.).
Pizzeria Regina
$
North End
ITALIAN
Regina’s is the only Boston pizza place that competes with New York in
quality and ambience. True, it’s hard to find, and the line can be long
(though it moves quickly). The too-good-to-be-true atmosphere is the real
thing, right down to waitresses who call you “honey” while warning you
not to burn your mouth on the bubbling-hot pie that just arrived. The
pizza, fresh from the brick oven, is that hot. And that good.

BARBECUE
“New England barbecue” doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. But you’ll want
these treats rolling right into your mouth after just one whiff of this place.
The festive crowd and whimsical décor make an appealing first impres-
sion, and the down-home food backs it up. Expatriate Southerners, raven-
ous college students, and celebratory families relish the lively atmosphere
and authentic fare. Barbecue in all incarnations shares the menu with
Southern specialties such as catfish and pecan pie, all in abundant por-
tions. Try to get a table at street level, not in the barlike space downstairs.
Suck down a beer, make a dent in a pile of pulled pork or baby-back ribs,
and you’ll understand why there’s a stack of paper napkins on every table.

Rialto
$$$$
Cambridge/Harvard Square
MEDITERRANEAN
Rialto has the sleek-chic vibe you’d expect at the Charles Hotel, but never
to the point of feeling snooty. The restaurant assembles the elements that
make a memorable dining experience unforgettable: a glamorous but com-
fortable space, attentive service, and, most important, Jody Adams’s amaz-
ing food. She makes good use of seasonal local products, creating an
overall effect of a sun-drenched field overlooking the Mediterranean. Try
any seafood dish, any vegetarian option — anything, really. Now you’re so
cutting edge.

Street 2 blocks, bear left onto Eliot Street, and go 2 blocks. Parking: Valet and vali-

p.m.; Sun 5:30–9 p.m. (Lounge opens at 5 p.m. and closes 90 minutes after dining room.)
S&S Restaurant
$
Cambridge/Inman Square
AMERICAN
The best brunch in the area draws huge weekend crowds to this Inman
Square standby, which is also a fine place for a tasty meal during the week.
Never mind the long walk from the T — on the way back, you’ll be work-
ing off calories from the huge omelets, inventive pancakes and waffles, and
excellent baked goods. On weekends, arrive early, or schedule your day
to allow for waiting time (and people-watching). During nonbrunch hours,
the traditional deli menu includes breakfast any time.

and turn left at turnstiles; then take the number 69 (Harvard-Lechmere) bus to Inman
Square, walk 3⁄4 mile up Cambridge Street, or take a $6 cab ride from the station. Main
courses: $5–$15. AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Wed 7 a.m.–11 p.m.; Thurs–Fri 7 a.m. to mid-
night; Sat 8 a.m. to midnight; Sun 8 a.m.–10 p.m. (brunch weekends until 4 p.m.).
Sel de la Terre
$$$
Downtown
MEDITERRANEAN
The atmosphere at this upscale-but-not-too-upscale cousin of L’Espalier
may be the neatest trick in town: Although Sel de la Terre sits near the
Waterfront and not far from the Financial District, you’d never know it. Not
that you’ll imagine you’re in Provence, but that’s clearly where Executive
Chef Geoff Gardner’s heart is. He transforms fresh local ingredients (espe-
cially seafood) into flavor-packed cuisine that’s never overwhelming. The
crowd is businesslike at lunch, chic at dinner. Carb addicts can load up on
baked goodies at the boulangerie (bakery) near the entrance, which also
offers delicious takeout sandwiches and salads.
See map p. 120. 255 State St. (at Atlantic Avenue; 1 block from the New England
Aquarium). % 617-720-1300. www.seldelaterre.com. Reservations suggested.
T: State (Blue or Orange Line) or Aquarium (Blue Line), if open; walk 4 blocks toward
the harbor on State Street. Main courses: $26. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri
11:30 a.m.–2:30 p.m.; Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–3:30 p.m.; daily 5–10 p.m.
Dining and Snacking on the Go
Multiple courses, starched tablecloths, and courtly service have their
time and their place; that’s usually not in the middle of a busy day of sight-
seeing. In this section, you get the scoop on grabbing a bite (outdoors and
indoors), plus pointers on afternoon tea, dim sum, coffee, and ice cream.
Picking the picnic option
With the harbor here and the river there, acres of waterfront space offer
perfect opportunities for picnicking, and you can find plenty of places in
Boston and Cambridge to fill up your metaphorical picnic basket. Here
are some airy options:
 Gathering food for your outdoor feast is a picnic (ouch!) at the
Colonnade food court at Faneuil Hall Marketplace (T: Government
Center [Green or Blue Line] or Haymarket [Orange Line]), which
has enough variety to satisfy a large group. When you’re set, cross
Atlantic Avenue and seek out the benches and lawns of Christopher
Columbus Waterfront Park, next to the Marriott Long Wharf.
 In the North End, Il Panino Express, 266 Hanover St. (T: Haymarket
[Green or Orange Line]; % 617-720-5720), cranks out superb sand-
wiches, pasta, and pizza. Cross Hanover Street to Richmond Street
and follow it 4 blocks downhill to Christopher Columbus Park.
Part III: Settling Into Boston 
134

 At the foot of Beacon Hill (near the Esplanade, a destination for
concerts and movies all summer), Savenor’s Market, 160 Charles
St. (T: Charles/MGH [Red Line]; % 617-723-6328) lets you load up
on gourmet provisions before heading across the footbridge to the
Charles River Basin. From the Back Bay, gain access to the river-
bank from Mass. Ave. after hitting Trader Joe’s, 899 Boylston St.
(% 617-262-6505), for the makings of your alfresco feast.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Boston 135
Around the world in 80 
plates: Ethnic dining
Boston and Cambridge boast a virtual United Nations of ethnic restaurants. Space
doesn’t allow me to suggest more than a few restaurants here, but the following neigh-
borhoods are all good places to wander around and follow your nose. You don’t want
to be the first one through the door (trust me, the empty places are empty for a reason),
but if the menu looks promising, don’t let a less-than-full room stop you, especially on
a weeknight. Here’s a brief guide of what to expect in these area’s eateries:
 If you head to the North End (Haymarket stop on the Green or Orange Line), you’ll
find Italian food of every description in every price range. Ordinarily, I can’t abide
waiting, but in this area, lines are good. You’ll see some locals in restaurants on
high-traffic Hanover and Salem streets, but some of the best neighborhood places
are on the side streets. Check out Artú, 6 Prince St. (% 617-742-4336), for excel-
lent sandwiches, pastas, and roasted meats; and J. Pace & Son, 42 Cross St. 
(% 617-227-9673), a superb deli that has a small year-round seating area and
tables outside when the weather’s fine.
 Chinatown (which has an Orange Line stop) is another promising neighborhood,
and not just for Chinese food. Reasonably priced Asian cuisine of all descriptions
abounds on Beach Street and the narrow streets that branch off between
Washington Street (where the T stop is) and the Greenway (where the landmark
Chinatown Arch is). Pho Pasteur, 682 Washington St. (% 617-482-7467), is the
original location of a local Vietnamese minichain that specializes in authentic
noodle soup, and Penang, 685–691 Washington St. (% 617-451-6373), is part of a
New York–based chain of Malaysian restaurants.
 Cambridge’s Central Square is a social and culinary melting pot, with food from
almost every corner of the globe. Follow Mass. Ave. in either direction from the T
stop (Red Line to Central), and you’ll probably find something that gets your nose’s
attention. I generally head straight for either India Pavilion, 17 Central Sq. (% 617-
547-7463), the oldest Indian restaurant in Cambridge, or Asmara Restaurant, 739
Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-864-7447), for Ethiopian and Eritrean food.
 Try taking take the Red Line to Central, turn the corner at Starbucks, and walk up
Prospect Street to Inman Square, where you’ll find everything from Brazilian bar-
becue (at the Midwest Grill, 1124 Cambridge St.; % 617-354-7536) to bibimbap
and sushi (at Koreana, 154–158 Prospect St.; % 617-576-8661) to sandwiches of
every description (at All Star Sandwich Bar, 1245 Cambridge St.; % 617-868-3065)
within about 5 blocks.

 Harvard Square also affords easy access to the Charles. Head a few
blocks west and outfit yourself with inventive sandwiches and
salads at Darwins Ltd., 148 Mount Auburn St. (T: Harvard [Red
Line]; % 617-354-5233). Stake out a bench on the riverbank, a
block away, or backtrack a bit and find a comfy spot at John F.
Kennedy Park at Kennedy Street and Memorial Drive.
Checking out the chains
National chains abound, but really, can’t you do that at home? One
exception that’s especially useful if you’re traveling with teenagers is the
Hard Rock Cafe, which recently moved to 24 Clinton St. (at North
Street), across the street from Faneuil Hall Marketplace (T: Haymarket
[Orange Line] or Aquarium [Blue Line]; www.hardrock.com). If you
don’t know what to expect, ask the kids.
Local chains offer a less generic experience. Check out my favorite picks:
 The upscale pizzerias of Bertucci’s appeal to adults and kids alike.
The little ones can concentrate on the wood-burning brick ovens,
and their caddies can exclaim over the plain and fancy pizzas and
pastas. Handy branches are at Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Merchants
Row, off State Street (% 617-227-7889); 43 Stanhope St., off Claren-
don Street, Back Bay (T: Back Bay [Orange Line] or Copley [Green
Line]; % 617-247-6161); 533 Commonwealth Avenue, Kenmore
Square (T: Kenmore [Green Line B, C, or D]; % 617-236-1030); and
21 Brattle St., Harvard Square, Cambridge (T: Harvard [Red Line];
% 617-864-4748).
 The fresh, tasty soups, sandwiches, and baked goods at Au Bon
Pain are never particularly unusual or disappointing. Locations are
all over town, including the Prudential Center, 800 Boylston St., Back
Bay (T: Prudential [Green Line E] or Hynes/ICA [Green Line B, C, or
D]; % 617-421-9593); and downtown at 53 State St. (T: State [Blue
or Orange Line]; % 617-723-8483), a block from Faneuil Hall Market-
place. The patio at the Harvard Square location, in Holyoke Center,
1350 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge (T: Harvard [Red Line]; % 617-
497-9797) is one of the best people-watching perches in New England.
Taking teatime
The original Boston Tea Party, a colonial rebellion, couldn’t be further
from the experience of a proper afternoon tea in a posh hotel. Finger
sandwiches, pastries, scones, clotted cream, and other niceties make this
the most polite way I know to make a pig of yourself. These hotels are
within walking distance of the Arlington T stop (Green Line). You’ll need a
reservation, especially on weekends. Put on your daintiest attitude at:
 The Four Seasons Hotel, 200 Boylston St., Back Bay. The Bristol 
(% 617-351-2037) serves tea daily from 3 to 4:30 p.m. Expect to
pay $28 per person, more if you spring for the signature kir royale
(a champagne cocktail).
Part III: Settling Into Boston 
136

 The Taj Boston, 15 Arlington St. (% 617-598-5255). The legendary
Lounge in the former Ritz-Carlton serves tea Wednesday through
Sunday at 2:30 and 4 p.m. for $20 to $40 a person.
Bao, wow: Dim sum
Dim sum, a Chinese midday meal, is a perfect way to sample a variety of
small dishes. To enjoy the most options, go on a weekend with at least
one other person. Waitresses make the rounds, pushing carts loaded
with bao (steamed buns), steamed and fried dumplings, spring rolls,
sweets, and more. Point at what you want (unless you speak Chinese),
and the server stamps your check with the symbol of the dish; most
cost $1 to $3. For around $10 per person, this option is a thoroughly sat-
isfying experience.
If you don’t care for fried food, pork, or shrimp, dim sum may leave you
feeling more deprived than satisfied.
The top dim sum destinations, all near the Chinatown T stop (Orange
Line), include the following:
 Chau Chow City, 81 Essex St. (% 617-338-8158)
 China Pearl, 9 Tyler St., second floor (% 617-426-4338)
 Empire Garden Restaurant, 690–698 Washington St., second floor
(% 617-482-8898)
Espresso express
Boston and Cambridge overflow with congenial coffee outlets (college
and stimulants seem to go together), but the classic caffeine-related
experience is a spell in a North End caffè. Check out the pastries, order
an espresso or cappuccino (decaf, if you insist), sit back, and watch the
world go by. To get to the North End, take the T to Haymarket (Green or
Orange Line) and follow signs.
My favorite destinations include Caffè Vittoria, 296 Hanover St. (% 617-
227-7606), and Caffè dello Sport, 308 Hanover St. (% 617-523-5063).
Caffè Paradiso, 255 Hanover St. (% 617-742-1768), is the place to watch
big European soccer matches. Mike’s Pastry, 300 Hanover St. (% 617-
742-3050), is a popular bakery with table service. Find what you want in
the case and then sit down and order — or try something tasty to go and
head down to the harbor for a dessert picnic.
I scream, you scream
The New Yorker in me still can’t believe the year-round popularity of ice
cream in the Boston area. (For the record, that’s not a complaint.) After
encyclopedic research and great personal sacrifice, I can attest to the
quality of the following establishments.

Part IV
Exploring Boston

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I reach the heart of the matter: the experiences
and activities that led you to choose Boston over every
other potential destination. (If the meeting planners or the
bride and groom or your parents chose for you, think of this
part as the “maybe they know what they’re doing” section.)
You can approach Boston as a history lesson, an art gallery, a
seafood buffet, or even a giant shopping center. You can con-
centrate on a speciﬁc interest or skip around. You can spend
a day, a weekend, or a month and still only scratch the sur-
face. You can pick a neighborhood and settle in or use it as

Chapter 11
Discovering Boston’s 
Best Attractions
In This Chapter
 Finding the best destinations and most entertaining activities
 Mapping the Freedom Trail
 Enjoying a Guided Tour
B
oston stimulates all your senses: You see great paintings and sculp-
ture, hear classical and popular music, taste ocean-fresh seafood,
smell the perfume of Public Garden flower beds, and feel the breeze off
the harbor in your hair. The preceding chapters address getting to
Boston and finding shelter and food. This chapter describes the most
popular attractions and contains separate sections on the world-famous
Freedom Trail and guided tours.
The best thing you can do at this stage is to forget that you know the
words should and ought. Listen to yourself (and me, of course), not to
the friends who say you must see or do something that sounds, to you,
as dull as watching paint dry. If you think it’s boring, it is — and there’s
no reason to be bored in Boston.
The Top Attractions
Many Boston-area attractions are government property, with the same
concern for security that Americans have come to expect at other fed-
eral, state, and local institutions. You may have to pass through a check-
point, have your bag inspected, clear a metal detector, or stay a certain
distance from some buildings or public spaces.
Faneuil Hall Marketplace
Downtown
This is one of the city’s most popular attractions for a reason: It’s an agree-
able amalgam of recreation, retail, and restaurants. Brick plazas and plenty
of outdoor seating surround the five-building “festival market” complex,

which buzzes with activity from just past dawn until well past dark in
pleasant weather year-round. Dozens of stores, shops, boutiques, and
pushcarts share space with restaurants, bars, and food counters.
The marketplace is busiest in summer and fall, when street performers
and musicians make the rounds outside. The shopping ranges from generic
to quirky, and the dining ranges from fast to fancy. Dozens of food counters
run the length of the central building, Quincy Market. You don’t need to
spend a penny to enjoy the fun, though. Between entertainers on the
streets and visitors from all over the world, the marketplace also offers
great people-watching. True, this spot is touristy, especially in warm
weather — but sometimes you just need to relax and let your inner tourist
look around.
See “The Freedom Trail” section, later in this chapter, for information about
Faneuil Hall.
Between North, Congress, and State streets and I-93. % 617-338-2323. www.faneuil

plaza, walk down the stairs, and cross Congress Street. Or Haymarket (Orange Line);
follow Congress Street (with City Hall Plaza on your right) for 2 to 3 blocks. Open:
Marketplace Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–9 p.m.; Sun noon to 6 p.m. Food court opens earlier;
restaurant hours vary.
Harvard University
Cambridge
It’s old, famous, and known for educating many notable people — but that
also describes dozens of other institutions of higher learning. Harvard glo-
ries in its status as the country’s oldest (established in 1636) and best-
known college, as well as the alma mater of six American presidents. The
heart of the campus, two hopelessly picturesque quadrangles known as
Harvard Yard (or just “the Yard”), sits behind the brick walls that run
along Mass. Ave. and Quincy and Cambridge streets.
The Yard is the oldest part of the campus and contains Harvard’s oldest
building, Massachusetts Hall (1720), home to the university president’s
office. Also in the Yard, in front of University Hall, you find the John Harvard
Statue (1884), a magnet for photographers from all over the world. Campus
legend nicknames it “the Statue of Three Lies” because its inscription reads
“John Harvard — Founder — 1638.” The truth: The college dates to 1636;
Harvard bestowed money and his library on the fledgling institution but
wasn’t the founder; and sculptor Daniel Chester French’s model reputedly
was either a descendant of Harvard’s or a student.
Across Mass. Ave., the Information Center distributes maps and self-
guided tour directions and has a bulletin board that lists campus activi-
ties. You may also want to visit the university’s art and science museums;
see the listings later in this chapter.

Institute of Contemporary Art
South Boston Waterfront
The attention of the art world turned to Boston in 2006, when the Institute
of Contemporary Art (known as the ICA) moved here from the Back Bay.
The first new art museum in Boston in almost a century, the dramatic can-
tilevered structure — designed by the rising-star New York firm Diller
Scofidio + Renfro — is a work of art in its own right. It takes full advantage
of the waterfront site, allowing breathtaking views of the harbor from all
over the 65,000-square-foot building. For the first time, the ICA has a per-
manent collection, complementing temporary exhibits of 20th- and 21st-
century art in every imaginable medium. Come for the architecture; stay
for the welcoming, mind-expanding curatorial approach that makes even
the least familiar styles and subjects approachable and relatable.
100 Northern Ave. % 617-478-3101. www.icaboston.org. T: South Station (Red
Line), then Silver Line bus to Courthouse; walk 1 block east (away from downtown)
on Seaport Boulevard and turn left onto Northern Avenue at 1st traffic light; entrance
is on the right. Admission: $12 for adults, $10 for seniors and students, free for chil-
dren younger than 18. Free to all Thurs after 5 p.m. and to families (up to 2 adults with
children younger than 13) last Sat of each month. Open: Sat–Sun and Tues–Wed 
10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Thurs–Fri and most Mon holidays 10 a.m.–9 p.m.
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Fenway
Arts patron Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) designed this magnificent
home in the style of a 15th-century Venetian palace. After Gardner’s death,
the home became a gorgeous museum — and a testament to the timeless
judgment of a fascinating, iconoclastic woman. The collections include
European, American, and Asian painting and sculpture, and furniture and
architectural details from European churches and palaces. Allow at least
two hours to peruse works by Titian, Botticelli, Raphael, Rembrandt,
Matisse, James McNeill Whistler, and John Singer Sargent. Under the terms
of Gardner’s will, the arrangement of the galleries does not change; special
shows go up in a separate space two or three times a year.
280 The Fenway (at Museum Road, off Huntington Avenue). % 617-566-1401. www.
gardnermuseum.org. T: Museum (Green Line E); walk 2 blocks straight ahead
(away from Huntington Avenue, with the Museum of Fine Arts on your right).
Admission: $12 adults, $10 seniors, $5 college students with ID, and free for children
younger than age 18 and adults named Isabella with ID. Open: Tues–Sun 11 a.m.–
5 p.m. and some Mon holidays. Closed Thanksgiving, Dec 25, and Dec 31.
Chapter 11: Discovering Boston’s Best Attractions 151

John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum
Dorchester
A magnificent building designed by I. M. Pei, the Kennedy Library cele-
brates the life and legacy of the 35th president. History buffs will want to
spend at least 90 minutes exploring exhibits that recall “Camelot.” The dis-
plays include audio and video recordings, replicas of the Oval Office and
the office of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, a film about the Cuban
missile crisis, and imaginatively displayed documents and memorabilia. A
17-minute film about Kennedy’s early life introduces the museum, which
regularly updates displays and schedules special exhibits, lectures, and
other events. Allow for travel time — 30 minutes from or to downtown
Boston.
Columbia Point (off Morrissey Boulevard). % 866-JFK-1960 or 617-514-1600. www.
jfklibrary.org. T: JFK/UMass (Red Line); then take the free shuttle bus, which
runs every 20 minutes. By car: Take I-93/Route 3 south to Exit 15 (Morrissey

parking lot. Admission: $10 adults; $8 seniors, students with ID, and youths 13–17;
free for children younger than 13. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. (last film at 3:55 p.m.).
Closed Jan 1, Thanksgiving, and Dec 25.
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
152
Time- and money-saving suggestions
Here are two good options for visitors spending more than a day or two:
 The Boston CityPass (% 888-330-5008; www.citypass.com) includes tickets
to the John F. Kennedy Library, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Museum of
Fine Arts, Museum of Science, New England Aquarium, and Prudential Center
Skywalk. At press time, adults pay $39; children ages 3 to 11 pay $21. For adults,
that’s a 50 percent savings if you visit all six attractions (and you don’t need to wait
in line!). The price is subject to change as museum fees change. The passes are
good for nine days from the date of purchase during high season; in winter, they’re
valid all season, which CityPass defines as December 15 to March 31. Buy yours
at participating attractions, through the Web site, from the Greater Boston
Convention & Visitors Bureau (% 800-SEE-BOSTON), and at some travel agents
and hotel concierge desks.
 The Go Boston card (% 800-887-9103 or 617-742-5950; www.gobostoncard.
com) includes admission to 60 Boston-area museums and attractions, dining and
shopping discounts, a guidebook, and a two-day Beantown Trolley ticket. It’s
expensive — $49 for one day, $79 for two days, $109 for three days, $149 for five
days, or $169 for seven days with discounts for children and for winter travelers —
but if you strategize wisely, it’s a great value. The Go Boston Card is available
through the Web site, at the office in the state Transportation Building at 16 Charles
St. S. if you’ve prepaid, at several information centers and many concierge desks,
and as part of some hotel packages.

Museum of Fine Arts
Fenway
Out-of-towners typically hear about the MFA because of special exhibitions
and traveling shows, not because of the real appeal: an unbeatable com-
bination of the familiar and the unexpected. The galleries contain so many
classic pieces that you’ll probably feel as if you’ve bumped into an old
friend at least once during your visit. The collections span the centuries
and the globe — from Old Kingdom Egyptian collections (that means mum-
mies, kids) to contemporary photography. The celebrated Impressionist
paintings include dozens of Monets. And you’ll always run across some-
thing, ancient or modern, that leaves you glad you made the trip.
Schedule at least half a day to explore; art fiends should allow more time.
The museum recently launched an expansion project that may affect cer-
tain galleries during your visit; if a particular object is a “must” for you,
check ahead to see whether it’s on exhibit. The best way to get an overview
is to take a free guided tour. They start on weekdays (except Mon holidays)
at 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.; Wednesdays also at 6:15 p.m.; and Saturdays at
10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. If you prefer to explore the sprawling galleries on
your own, pick up a floor plan or family-activity booklet at the information
desk. Check ahead for special family- and child-friendly activities, which
take place year-round.
The MFA is one of the most expensive museums in the country; if your
plans allow, a Boston CityPass can be a great investment.
465 Huntington Ave. (at Museum Road). % 617-267-9300. www.mfa.org. T: Museum
(Green Line E). Or Ruggles (Orange Line); walk 2 blocks on Ruggles Street. Admission,
good for 2 visits within 10 days of purchase: Adults $15, students and seniors $13.
Children younger than 18 $6.50 on school days before 3 p.m., otherwise free.
Voluntary contribution Wed 4–9:45 p.m. Surcharges may apply for special exhibitions.
No fee to visit only shop, library, or auditoriums. Open: Entire museum Sat–Tues 
10 a.m.–4:45 p.m.; Wed 10 a.m.–9:45 p.m.; Thurs–Fri 10 a.m.–4:45 p.m. West Wing only
Thurs–Fri 4:45–9:45 p.m. Closed Jan 1, Patriots’ Day, July 4, Thanksgiving, and Dec 25.
Museum of Science
Science Park (between Boston and East Cambridge)
A superb destination for children and adults, the Museum of Science enter-
tainingly introduces visitors to scientific principles and theories. Hands-on
displays and exhibits explore every field you can imagine, but — I can’t
emphasize this enough — always in a fun, accessible way.
Allow at least a couple of hours; if you plan to take in a show (see the next
paragraph), you may want to set aside a day. The Virtual FishTank, acquired
when the science museum joined forces with the Computer Museum, is one
of the most popular exhibits. You can “build” your fish using your home
computer (visit www.virtualfishtank.com) or on the scene, and then
watch as your new pet interacts with other people’s creations.
A show at one of the museum’s theaters, which charge separate admis-
sion, is well worth your time. The Mugar Omni Theater shows IMAX
Chapter 11: Discovering Boston’s Best Attractions 153

movies on a five-story domed screen; the Charles Hayden Planetarium
schedules daily star shows, weekend rock-music laser-light extravaganzas,
and shows on special astronomical topics.
Buy all of your tickets at once, not only because you save money but also
because shows may sell out. You can buy tickets in person or order them
in advance (subject to a service charge) over the phone or online using a
credit card.
Science Park (off Route 28). % 617-723-2500. www.mos.org. T: Science Park (Green
Line); follow signs along elevated walkway onto bridge. Admission: Exhibit halls $16
adults, $14 seniors, $13 children 3–11, free for children younger than 3. Mugar Omni
Theater, Hayden Planetarium, or laser shows $9 adults, $8 seniors, $7 children 3–11,
free for children younger than 3. Discounted admission tickets for 2 or 3 attraction
combinations. Open: Museum Sat–Thurs 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Fri 9 a.m.–9 p.m. Shows
during museum hours and some evenings; call or check the Web site for the sched-
ule. Closed Thanksgiving and Dec 25.
New England Aquarium
Waterfront
A sprawling complex that overlooks Boston Harbor, the Aquarium is home
to more than 15,000 fish and aquatic mammals. The centerpiece is the
200,000-gallon Giant Ocean Tank; other exhibits focus on local ecology, the
medical center, and a roster of regularly changing special topics. Allow at
least two and a half hours for the aquarium, plus an hour or so if you plan
to take in a film in the state-of-the-art Simons IMAX Theatre. Check ahead
for information about harbor cruises and discovery cruises, and see the
“Whale-watching” section, later in this chapter, for information about going
out to sea in search of some of New England’s biggest celebrities.
At busy times, the Aquarium can be uncomfortably crowded and the lines
unbearably long. The Boston CityPass is a good option — in time more so
than money — on hot summer days when having a ticket allows you to go
straight to the entrance. Seriously consider investing in the pass, espe-
cially if you’re traveling with restless children. If you don’t buy a pass, try
to make this spot your first stop of the day, and arrive when the doors
open.
Central Wharf (off Atlantic Avenue at State Street). % 617-973-5200. Simons IMAX
Theatre: % 866-815-4629. www.newenglandaquarium.org. T: Aquarium (Blue
Line). Admission: Aquarium $18 adults, $10 children 3–11, free for children younger
than 3. Simons IMAX Theatre $10 adults, $8 children 3–11. Aquarium and IMAX $23
adults, $15 children 3–11. No fee to visit outdoor exhibits, cafe, and gift shop. Open:
Aquarium July–Labor Day Mon–Thurs 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Fri–Sun and holidays 9 a.m.–
7 p.m. Day after Labor Day–June Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Sat–Sun and holidays 
9 a.m.–6 p.m. Simons IMAX Theatre year-round daily 10 a.m.–9 p.m. Closed Dec 25
and until noon Jan 1.
Part IV: Exploring Boston

Prudential Center Skywalk
Back Bay
The observatory on the 50th floor of the Prudential Tower boasts Boston’s
only 360-degree view. The interactive displays (which include multimedia
exhibits from the now-closed immigration museum Dreams of Freedom)
are quite interesting, and the panorama can’t be beat. Visit at twilight on
slightly overcast days to enjoy spectacular sunsets. The 52nd floor holds
the Top of the Hub restaurant and lounge (see Chapter 16).
Note: Adults must show a photo ID to enter the Prudential Tower.
800 Boylston St. (at Fairfield Street). % 617-859-0648. T: Prudential (Green Line E) or
Copley (Green Line B, C, or D); walk toward tower. Admission: $11 adults, $9 seniors
and college students with ID, $7.50 children younger than 12. Open: Mar–Oct daily 
10 a.m.–10 p.m.; Nov–Feb daily 10 a.m.–8 p.m. Always call ahead because the space
sometimes closes for private events.
Public Garden/Swan Boats
Back Bay
One of the most pleasant spots in the city, the Public Garden is 8 square
blocks of peaceful greenery surrounding an agreeable body of water. The
oldest botanical garden in the country boasts thriving blooms from spring
through late fall, and the action on the lagoon is always diverting. Children
love the geese, ducks, and swans. Adults get a kick out of the sculptures
and monuments, which commemorate George Washington, the first use of
ether as an anesthetic, and other apparently random people and events.
The Swan Boats have been synonymous with Boston since 1877. Still oper-
ated by the same family, the fiberglass birds on pedal boats (the atten-
dants pedal, not the passengers) make a great low-tech break. Fans of The
Trumpet of the Swan, by E. B. White, can’t miss this experience. Allow 30
minutes.
Near the corner of Charles and Beacon streets, nine little bronze figures
immortalize Robert McCloskey’s book Make Way for Ducklings. Nancy
Schön’s renderings of Mrs. Mallard and her babies inspire delighted shrieks
from small visitors.
Chapter 11: Discovering Boston’s Best Attractions 155
A room with a view, times two
A sensational view is its own reward, and it’s so much more rewarding if it’s free. Not
far from the Aquarium are two buildings with public observation areas that overlook
the harbor, the airport, and the South Boston waterfront. Admission is free, but be
ready to show an ID and perhaps sign in. The viewing area on the 14th floor of
Independence Wharf, 470 Atlantic Ave., at Northern Avenue, is open daily from 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Foster’s Rotunda, on the ninth floor of 30 Rowes Wharf (in the Boston Harbor
Hotel complex), is open Monday to Friday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Between Arlington, Boylston, Charles, and Beacon streets. T: Arlington (Green Line).
Or Charles/MGH (Red Line); follow Charles Street 5 blocks to Beacon Street. Open:
Daily year-round. As in any park, be careful at night, especially if you’re alone.
Swan Boats % 617-522-1966. www.swanboats.com. Admission: $2.75 adults, $2
seniors, $1.25 children 2–15. Open: Daily, 3rd Sat of Apr to mid-Sept; summer 
10 a.m.–5 p.m.; spring 10 a.m.–4 p.m.; fall weekdays noon to 4 p.m.; fall weekends 
10 a.m.–4 p.m.
The Freedom Trail
Saying “16 historic sights make up the 2.5-mile Freedom Trail” gives no
sense of the role the trail (www.thefreedomtrail.org) plays for visi-
tors to Boston. Not only are the attractions interesting, but the trail — 
a line of bricks or red paint on the sidewalk from Boston Common to
Charlestown — also makes finding your way around considerably less
confusing than it would be otherwise.
This section lists the stops along the trail, starting with Boston Common
and ending with the Bunker Hill Monument. I cover them in the order
that usually appears in pamphlets, maps, and other publications, but
you don’t have to speed-walk from one end to the other, go in exact
order, or even see everything. Start in Charlestown and work backward,
skip a stop or two, or even get “lost” — this area is too small for you to
go too far astray. I insist on just one thing: Wear comfortable walking
shoes.
The Freedom Trail takes at least two hours, even if you don’t linger too
long at any one stop. If that’s too much time, consider a free 90-minute
walking tour of the “heart” of the trail with a National Park Service ranger.
The Freedom Trail Foundation (% 617-357-8300; www.thefreedom
trail.org) offers 90-minute tours led by a costumed guide; tickets cost
$12 for adults, $10 for seniors and students, and $6 for children younger
than 13. Tours begin at the Boston Common Visitor Center or Faneuil Hall.
To head out on your own, start at the Visitor Information Center at 147
Tremont St., on Boston Common. Take the T to Park Street (Red or Green
Line).
Boston Common
Downtown/Beacon Hill
In 1634, the town of Boston bought what’s now the country’s oldest park.
In 1640, the land became common ground; it later served as a cow pasture
(until 1830), military camp, and all-purpose municipal gathering place.
Plaques and memorials abound. One of the loveliest is up the hill from the
T station, on Beacon Street across from the State House. Augustus Saint-
Gaudens designed the bas-relief Robert Gould Shaw Memorial, which
honors Civil War veterans Colonel Shaw and the Union Army’s 54th

Center % 800-SEE-BOSTON or 617-536-4100. T: Park Street (Red or Green Line).
Massachusetts State House
Beacon Hill
Governor Samuel Adams laid the cornerstone of the state capitol in 1795.
The great Federal-era architect Charles Bulfinch designed the imposing
central building and landmark golden dome. Free tours — guided (call
ahead) and self-guided (just show up) — leave from the second floor. Visit
the rear of the building, off Bowdoin Street, to see a 60-foot monument that
illustrates the hill’s original height (material from the top went into 19th-
century landfill projects).
Beacon St. (at Park Street). % 617-727-3676. www.mass.gov/statehouse. 
T: Park Street (Red or Green Line); walk up Park Street 1 block. Admission: Free. Open:
Weekdays 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Tours Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
Park Street Church
Downtown/Beacon Hill
Henry James described this 1809 structure as “the most interesting mass
of bricks and mortar in America.” Plaques arrayed around the entrance
describe its storied history, which includes the first public performance of
“America” (“My Country ’Tis of Thee”) on July 4, 1831.
1 Park St. (at Tremont Street). % 617-523-3383. www.parkstreet.org. T: Park
Street (Red or Green Line). Admission: Free. Open: July–Aug Tues–Sat 9:30 a.m.–3:30
p.m. Year-round services Sun 8:30 and 11 a.m., 4 and 6 p.m.
Old Granary Burying Ground
Downtown
This cemetery, which dates to 1660, was once part of Boston Common.
The graveyard contains the final resting places of patriots Samuel Adams,
Paul Revere, John Hancock, and James Otis; merchant Peter Faneuil
(spelled “FUNAL”); the victims of the Boston Massacre; and Benjamin
Franklin’s parents. The wife of Isaac Vergoose, who historians believe was
“Mother Goose” of nursery-rhyme fame, is also buried here.
Gravestone rubbing is illegal in Boston’s historic cemeteries (and pretty
bad karma, if you ask me).
Tremont Street (at Bromfield Street). T: Park Street (Red or Green Line); walk 1 block
on Tremont Street with Boston Common behind you. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m. (until
3 p.m. in the winter).

King’s Chapel and Burying Ground
Downtown
A squat granite structure, King’s Chapel is historically and architecturally
interesting. The current structure replaced a wooden chapel, and con-
struction (1749–1754) went on around the previous building. It was the first
Anglican church in Boston, but after the Revolution, in a rejection of the
royal religion, King’s Chapel became the first Unitarian church in America.
The burying ground, on Tremont Street, is the oldest in the city (1630).
Elaborate colonial headstones dot the graveyard, which is the final resting
place of John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay
Colony; William Dawes, who rode with Paul Revere; and Mary Chilton, the
first female colonist to step ashore on Plymouth Rock.
58 Tremont St. (at School Street). % 617-227-2155. www.kings-chapel.org. 
T: Government Center (Green or Blue Line); walk 1 block on Tremont Street.
Admission: $2 donation suggested for adults visiting chapel. Open: Chapel year-round
Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.; summer Mon and Thurs–Fri 10 a.m.–4 p.m., Tues–Wed 1–4 p.m.
Check Web site for up-to-date hours. Services Wed 12:15 p.m., Sun 11 a.m. Burying
ground daily 8 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (until 3 p.m. in winter).
First Public School/Benjamin Franklin Statue
Downtown
A colorful folk-art mosaic embedded in the sidewalk marks the site of the
first public school in the country, which opened in 1634 (two years before
Harvard). The school’s illustrious alumni include John Hancock, Benjamin
Franklin, Charles Bulfinch, Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and
Leonard Bernstein. Now called Boston Latin School, the institution still
exists, in the Fenway neighborhood.
A statue of Boston native Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) stands inside
the fence. The plaques on the base describe Franklin’s numerous accom-
plishments. The elegant granite building behind the statue is Old City
Hall, built in 1865 and designed in Second Empire style by Arthur Gilman
(who laid out the Back Bay) and Gridley J. F. Bryant.
School Street (at Province Street). T: State (Orange or Blue Line); walk 2 blocks on
Washington Street, turn right, and walk 1 block.
Old Corner Bookstore Building
Downtown
This land once held the home of religious reformer Anne Hutchinson, who
wasted no time in ticking off the church authorities — in 1638, a mere eight
years after the establishment of Boston, they excommunicated her and
expelled her from the community. In the middle of the 19th century, the
brick building (which dates to 1712) held the publishing house of Ticknor
& Fields. Publisher James “Jamie” Fields’ wide circle of friends included
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Harriet Beecher Stowe.

3 School St. (at Washington Street). T: State (Orange or Blue Line); walk 2 blocks up
Washington Street.
Old South Meeting House
Downtown
The Boston Tea Party started in this building, which remains a religious
and political gathering place today. On December 16, 1773, revolutionaries
protesting the royal tea tax assembled here and wound up dumping the
cargo of three ships into the harbor. An interactive multimedia exhibit tells
the building’s fascinating story. This structure, with a landmark clock
tower, dates to 1729; the original went up in 1670.
310 Washington St. % 617-482-6439. www.oldsouthmeetinghouse.org. 
T: State (Orange or Blue Line); walk 3 blocks up Washington Street. Admission: $5
adults, $4 seniors and students, $1 children 6–18, free for children younger than 6.
Freedom Trail ticket (with Old State House and Paul Revere House) $11 adults, $3
children. Open: Daily Apr–Oct 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov–Mar daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Old State House
Downtown
Built in 1713, the Old State House served as the seat of the colony’s gov-
ernment before the Revolution and as the state capitol until 1797. The gilded
lion and unicorn that adorn the exterior are replicas — the original symbols
of British rule went into a bonfire on July 18, 1776, the day Bostonians first
heard the Declaration of Independence read from the balcony. Inside, you
find the Bostonian Society’s museum of the city’s history. Displays include
an introductory video on the history of the building and changing exhibits
that showcase the society’s enormous collection of documents, intriguing
photographs, and artifacts. Plan on at least 45 minutes if you enjoy history,
considerably less if you’re more interested in architecture (or in getting to
Faneuil Hall Marketplace for some shopping and eating).
206 Washington St. (at State Street). % 617-720-3290. www.bostonhistory.org.
T: State (Blue or Orange Line). Admission: $5 adults, $4 seniors and students, $1 chil-
dren 6–18, free for children younger than 6. Freedom Trail ticket (with Old South
Meeting House and Paul Revere House) $11 adults, $3 children. Open: July–Aug daily
9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Feb–June and Sept–Dec daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Jan daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Boston Massacre Site
Downtown
Look for the ring of cobblestones on the traffic island in the middle of State
Street alongside the Old State House. This spot marks the approximate site
of the Boston Massacre, a conflict that took place March 5, 1770, and
helped launch the colonial rebellion. Angered at the presence of royal
troops in Boston, colonists threw snowballs, garbage, rocks, and other
debris at a group of soldiers. The redcoats panicked and fired into the
crowd, killing five men, who lie in the Old Granary Burying Ground.
State Street at Devonshire Street. T: State (Blue or Orange Line).

Faneuil Hall
Downtown
The “Cradle of Liberty” was a gift to the city from prosperous merchant
Peter Faneuil. Built in 1742, the site grew to more than twice the original
size in 1805, using a Charles Bulfinch design. On the Congress Street side
stands a statue of Samuel Adams (yes, as in the beer), one of the countless
orators whose declamations shook the building in the years before the
Revolution. Faneuil Hall also played host to advocates of abolition, tem-
perance, and women’s suffrage. Under the terms of Faneuil’s will, the build-
ing remains a public meeting (and concert) hall, and the ground floor holds
retail space. National Park Service rangers give free 20-minute talks every
half-hour in the second-floor auditorium and operate a Visitor Center on
the first floor.
The French Huguenot name “Faneuil” more or less rhymes with “Daniel”;
Fan-yoo-ul is another pronunciation.
Across North Street on Union Street, you see a series of glass towers in a
small park; this is the New England Holocaust Memorial (% 617-457-
8755; www.nehm.org). Built in 1995, the memorial is a moving reminder, in
the midst of attractions that celebrate freedom, of the consequences of a
world without it. The pattern on the glass is 6 million random numbers,
one for each Jew who died during the Holocaust.
Dock Square (Congress Street off North Street). % 617-242-5675. T: Government
Center (Green or Blue Line) or Haymarket (Orange Line). Admission: Free. Open: 2nd
floor daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; ground floor Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–9 p.m., Sun noon to 6 p.m.
Paul Revere House
North End
Remember “Listen, my children, and you shall hear / Of the midnight ride
of Paul Revere”? Paul Revere’s ride started here, at what’s now one of the
most enjoyable stops on the Freedom Trail. On April 18, 1775, Revere set
out for Lexington and Concord and into the American imagination (cour-
tesy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) from his home, which he bought in
1770. The oldest house in downtown Boston, the modest wooden struc-
ture dates to around 1680. The self-guided tour permits a glimpse of 18th-
century life and many family heirlooms.
19 North Square (at North Street between Richmond and Prince streets). % 617-
523-2338. www.paulreverehouse.org. T: Haymarket (Green or Orange Line).
Follow signs to the North End and follow the Freedom Trail. Admission: $3 adults,
$2.50 seniors and students, $1 children 5–17, free for children younger than 5.
Freedom Trail ticket (with Old South Meeting House and Old State House) $11 adults,
$3 children. Open: Daily Apr 15–Oct 9:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m., Nov–Apr 14 9:30 a.m.–4:15 p.m.
Closed Mon Jan–Mar, Jan 1, Thanksgiving, and Dec 25.
Chapter 11: Discovering Boston’s Best Attractions 161

Old North Church
North End
Formally named Christ Church, this is the oldest church in Boston, dating
to 1723. In the original steeple, sexton Robert Newman hung two lanterns
on the night of April 18, 1775, alerting Paul Revere to the movement of
British troops. The second beacon told Revere the redcoats were cross-
ing the Charles River by boat, not on foot (“One if by land, two if by sea”).
Markers and plaques dot the building and gardens; note the bust of George
Washington, reputedly the first memorial to the first president. The quirky
gift shop, in a former chapel, is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and all
proceeds go to support the church.
Robert Newman was a great-grandson of George Burroughs, one of the vic-
tims of the Salem witch trials of 1692. I found this out by studying the
plaques and tablets in and around the hideaway garden on the north side
of the church (to the left as you face the outside of the front doors). The
garden makes a peaceful respite from the throngs on Salem Street.
193 Salem St. (at Hull Street). % 617-523-6676. www.oldnorth.com. T: Haymarket
(Green or Orange Line); follow signs to the North End and walk 6 blocks on Salem
Street. Admission: Free; $3 donation requested. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Services
(Episcopal) Sun 9 and 11 a.m.
Copp’s Hill Burying Ground
North End
The Mather family of Puritan ministers, Robert Newman, and Prince Hall
lie in the second-oldest graveyard (1659) in the city. Hall, a prominent
member of the free black community that occupied the hill’s north slope
in colonial times, fought at Bunker Hill and established the first black
Masonic lodge. The highest point in the North End enjoys a great view of
the Inner Harbor, the Zakim Bridge, and Charlestown (look for the masts
of USS Constitution).
Between Hull, Snowhill, and Charter streets. T: North Station (Green or Orange Line).

On the trail of Charles Bulfinch
On Hanover Street between Prince and Fleet streets — between the Paul Revere
House and Old North Church stops on the Freedom Trail — is St. Stephen’s, the only
church still standing in Boston that was designed by the preeminent architect of the
Federal style, Charles Bulfinch. The church was Unitarian when it was dedicated in
1804. St. Stephen’s became Roman Catholic in 1862 to serve the North End’s burgeon-
ing immigrant population. Rose Fitzgerald, mother of President John F. Kennedy, was
baptized in this church in 1890. During refurbishment in 1965, it regained its original
appearance, with clear glass windows, white walls, and gilded organ pipes.

3 p.m. in winter).
USS Constitution
Charlestown
In modern terms, “Old Ironsides” retired undefeated. Launched in 1797 as
one of the U.S. Navy’s six original frigates, USS Constitution never lost a
battle. The tour guides are active-duty sailors in 1812 dress uniforms, hon-
oring the ship’s prominent role in the War of 1812. The frigate earned its
nickname during an engagement on August 19, 1812, with the French war-
ship Guerriere, whose shots bounced off Old Ironsides’ thick oak hull as if
it were iron. Tugs tow the Constitution into the harbor every Fourth of July
and several other times during the summer, usually on weekend mornings;
look for the accompanying tugboats and helicopters.
The nearby USS Constitution Museum (% 617-426-1812; www.uss
constitutionmuseum.org) contains participatory exhibits that illustrate
the history and operation of the ship. Also at the Navy Yard, National Park
Service rangers (% 617-242-5601) staff an information booth and give free
one-hour guided tours of the base.
Charlestown Navy Yard (off Constitution Road). % 617-242-5670. T: North Station
(Green or Orange Line); follow Causeway Street to North Washington Street, turn
left, and cross the bridge. (Total walking time is about 15 minutes.) Or T: Aquarium
(Blue Line); take ferry from Long Wharf to Navy Yard and then follow signs. Admission
for tours and museum: Free; museum donations encouraged. Open: Museum daily
May–Oct 15 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; daily Oct 16–Apr 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Constitution summer
Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (tours every 30 minutes until 3:30 p.m.); winter Thurs–Sun
10 a.m.–4 p.m. (tours every 30 minutes until 3:30 p.m.). Closed Jan 1, Thanksgiving,

Bunker Hill Monument
Charlestown
One of Boston’s best-known landmarks, this 221-foot granite obelisk
honors the colonists who died in the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775.
The victory proved costly for the British; half of their troops died or were
injured. The battle led to the British decision to abandon Boston nine
months later. A flight of 294 stairs leads to the top — there’s no elevator.
The tiny windows afford views of the harbor, the river, and the Zakim
Bridge. The ranger-staffed lodge at the base holds dioramas and exhibits.
Call ahead to see whether long-planned renovations have closed the mon-
ument during your visit.

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
Well-known, high-profile attractions are great — that’s why they’re so
popular, right? But when you get comfortable with Boston, you may feel
ready for something more offbeat. The sights and activities in this sec-
tion don’t have the same broad appeal as those described earlier in this
chapter, but they’re equally fun. In fact, if you’re particularly interested,
these attractions may even be more fun. In this section, I offer sugges-
tions for keeping the kids (small and large) happy, entertaining travelers
with specific interests, and captivating sports fans.
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
164
Neighborhood watch
Boston and Cambridge are famous for neighborhoods that make good destinations for
out-of-towners interested in exploring beyond the usual attractions. I particularly enjoy
these three ’hoods (two in Boston, one in Cambridge), but if you’re visiting friends who
want to explore an area you’ve never heard of, jump at the chance — it’s one of the
best ways to get to know a new city.
 Beacon Hill, west and north of the golden dome of the State House, is one of the
city’s oldest neighborhoods, a festival of brick and brownstone that looks like the
picture of Boston you probably have in your head. Wander downhill toward
Charles Street, making sure to explore the lovely side streets and tiny parks. One
of the oldest black churches in the country, the African Meeting House, is at 
8 Smith Court.
Between Beacon Street, Embankment Road, Cambridge Street, and Park Street.
T: Charles/MGH (Red Line) or Park Street (Green Line).
 The North End, traditionally an Italian-American neighborhood, today is more than
half newcomers, but the area retains an Italian flavor. You see Italian restaurants,
caffès, bakeries, pastry shops, and food stores. This detour is easy from the
Freedom Trail and worth more than just a quick trip for a pasta dinner. Hanover
and Salem streets are the main drags; you can find plenty of action on the side
streets, too.
Between Cross Street, Commercial Street, and North Washington Street. T: Hay-
market (Green or Orange Line); cross under the elevated highway.
 Harvard Square, Cambridge’s best-known intersection, attracts a kaleidoscopic
assortment of students, shoppers, street musicians, and sightseers. This area is
a retail playground (see Chapter 12) that’s especially lively on weekend afternoons.
Stop at the information booth near the main T entrance (% 617-497-1630; Mon–
Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m.), visit Harvard University (see the listing in this
chapter), or explore on your own. The area’s three main thoroughfares and the
connecting side streets make great places for wandering.
Intersection of Mass. Ave., John F. Kennedy Street, and Brattle Street. T: Harvard
(Red Line).

Especially for kids
Nearly every attraction in the Boston area appeals to children, and I’m
not just saying that — kids clearly have fun all over town. That doesn’t
mean every child loves every destination, however. For example, the
little ones feeding the birds at the Public Garden may find the Museum
of Science overwhelming, while an older sibling may be more interested
in the New England Aquarium. And leading anyone, child or adult, on a
forced march along the Freedom Trail is cruel and unusual — especially
in the summer.
Make sure that you know what your kids are looking forward to and that
they know what to expect in Boston. The Web is a great tool for this
research — a virtual visit from home can make a new destination feel
more familiar.
The Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum (% 617-338-1773; www.boston
teapartyship.com), long a fixture on the family-sightseeing circuit,
closed after a devastating fire in 2001. A full-scale replica of one of the
three merchant ships used in the pivotal pre-Revolutionary uprising, it
was a fun stop on the way to or from the Children’s Museum. Check ahead
to see whether it has reopened; at press time, they were hoping to reopen
in fall 2008.
Children’s Museum
Waterfront/Museum Wharf
Visitors younger than 10 or so usually have a great time here, and most
older travelers admit that they have fun, too. The novelty of raising your
voice in a place with museum in the name is just the beginning; the exhibits
combine recreation and education to good effect. The permanent displays
include “Science Playground,” where everyday objects such as golf balls
and soap bubbles illustrate principles of physics; “Boats Afloat,” where
kids operate model vessels on a giant water tank; the “Japanese House,”
which lets visitors experience life in an authentic Japanese home; and the
“Boston Black,” which introduces the various cultures and customs of
Boston’s black community. At press time, the museum was in the midst of
an extensive renovation and expansion, but it should be complete by the
time you read this; check the Web site for a preview of the new discover-
ies and diversions that await you. A room is reserved for toddlers, and the
gift shop is tremendous. Allow at least two hours.
Museum Wharf, 300 Congress St. (at Fort Point Channel). % 617-426-8855. www.
bostonchildrensmuseum.org. T: South Station (Red Line); walk north on
Atlantic Avenue 1 block (past the Federal Reserve Bank), turn right onto Congress
Street, follow it 1 long block, and cross the bridge. Admission: $9 adults, $7 children
ages 2–15 and seniors, $2 children age 1, free for children younger than 1; Fri 
5–9 p.m. $1 for all. Open: Sat–Thurs 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Fri 10 a.m.–9 p.m. Closed Thanks-
giving, Dec 25, and until noon Jan 1.
Chapter 11: Discovering Boston’s Best Attractions 165

Especially for teens
Occupying teenagers can be tricky, but keeping the lines of communica-
tion open can pay off for everyone. For example, does a campus tour
count as fun or as pressure? Talk things out.
Shopping options abound. Two excellent malls — the Shops at Pruden-
tial Center and Copley Place — connect through a skybridge so that
you don’t need to go outside. The CambridgeSide Galleria mall offers
almost nothing unusual but is about five minutes on foot from the
Museum of Science. For information on these places and other stores,
see Chapter 12.
The shopping in Harvard Square also tends toward the generic, but
with plenty of unconventional items, too. (For more information, see
Chapter 12.) And the neighborhood scene, especially in “the Pit,” near
the main T entrance, is always . . . well, let’s just call it eye-opening.
Nightlife may not be the first thing that springs to mind when you’re
thinking about teen diversions, but a trip to a theme restaurant or the
theater can be a great family excursion. Kids love the food and music at
the Hard Rock Cafe, and the interactive theater of Shear Madness and
Blue Man Group. During the day (kids aren’t allowed at night), teens
also enjoy bowling at Kings; in the evening, alcohol-free Club Passim is a
good choice if your teens enjoy folk music. For family-oriented nightlife
suggestions, turn to Part V and look for the Kid Friendly icon.
Finally, consider a campus tour. The Boston area is home to dozens of
schools. Most admissions offices are eager to show you around, and
every college-oriented high school student knows where to find a few
top choices on the Web. Tours are fun, free, and potentially inspirational
for the younger kids in your party. Among the many schools in the
Boston area are Bentley College, Boston College, Boston University,
Brandeis University, Emerson College, Harvard University, Lesley Uni-
versity, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Northeastern
University, Simmons College, Suffolk University, Tufts University, the
University of Massachusetts, and Wellesley College.
Especially for sports fans
The beloved baseball team and its iconic home field are the city’s best-
known sports figures, but Boston offers fans more than just the Red Sox.
Included here are a few other teams and places to round out your sports
tour.
Fenway Park
Kenmore Square
The Red Sox play from April until at least early October. Tickets go on sale
in December; the most expensive seats in baseball start at $12 for a few
sections in the bleachers, but most tickets are $23 and way up. Just about
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
166

every seat in the place is narrow, cramped, and delightfully close to the
action. If you failed to plan your trip months in advance, not to worry:
Check with the ticket office when you arrive in town or visit on the day of
the game you want to see. A limited number of standing-room tickets ($20)
go on sale the day of the game, and ticket holders sometimes return
unused ones. Your concierge may be able to lend a hand, too.
Given a choice between a right-field grandstand seat (in sections 1–11 or
so) and the bleachers, go for the slightly less expensive bleachers and the
better view. The most coveted tickets are for “Green Monster seats,” above
the famed left-field wall. They go on sale in batches throughout the season;
check the Web site for details.
You can also take a tour of Fenway Park, which includes a walk on the
warning track. Tours begin on the hour Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. and Sunday noon to 4 p.m., or three hours before game time
(whichever is earlier). Tours operate year-round except on holidays and
before day games. Admission is $12 for adults, $11 for seniors, $10 for chil-
dren younger than 15. Call % 617-236-6666 for more information.
Red Sox ticket office, 4 Yawkey Way (near the corner of Brookline Avenue, in the park).
% 877-REDSOX-9 or 617-267-1700. www.redsox.com. T: Kenmore (Green Line B, C,
or D) or Fenway (Green Line D). Games usually begin at 6 or 7 p.m. on weeknights, 
1 or 3 p.m. on weekends.
TD Banknorth Garden
North Station
The Garden is home to two professional teams and a museum. The NBA’s
Celtics (www.bostonceltics.com) play from early October to April or
May. Prices start as low as $10 for some games. The NHL’s Bruins (www.
bostonbruins.com) play from mid-September through early April. Their
tickets sometimes sell out despite being among the most expensive in the
league (technically, $10 and up, but serious fans should plan on spending
at least $50 a head).
Also at the TD Banknorth Garden, you can get a sense of how the Boston
area earned its reputation as a sports paradise. The Sports Museum of
New England (% 617-624-1234; www.sportsmuseum.org) occupies the
arena’s fifth- and sixth-level concourses. This museum offers a specialized
collection, most appealing for devoted fans of regional sports. Admission
is $6 for adults; $4 for seniors, students, and children 6 to 17. Hours are
daily 11 a.m. to 3 or 5 p.m., but they’re subject to change during events —
always call first.
Visitors may not bring any bags, including backpacks and briefcases, into
the arena.

tion. www.tdbanknorthgarden.com. T: North Station (Green or Orange Line).

Gillette Stadium
Foxboro
The 2002, 2004, and 2005 Super Bowl champion New England Patriots
(% 800-543-1776; www.patriots.com) consistently sell out Gillette
Stadium. Plan as far ahead as possible. The team plays from August
through December or January. In the unlikely event that they’re available,
you’ll pay at least $59 for a ticket. In warm weather, Gillette Stadium is 
the home field of Major League Soccer’s New England Revolution (% 877-
GET-REVS; www.revolutionsoccer.net). It’s also a major concert venue.
Route 1. Call the Patriots’ number or check the Web site, both listed in the preced-
ing paragraph, for stadium information. Special commuter rail service runs from
Boston and Providence before and after games. You may also be able to catch a bus
from South Station or the Riverside Green Line T station to the stadium (call 
% 800-23-LOGAN for information about the bus).
College sports are much less expensive than their pro counterparts, and
they’re loads of fun. Ice hockey is the most hotly contested of the dozens
of sports in which local teams compete. Check the papers to see what’s
up during your visit and then call to check ticket availability. The Division
I schools are Boston College (% 617-552-GOBC), Boston University
(% 617-353-GOBU), Harvard University (% 877-GO-HARVARD or 617-
495-2211), and Northeastern University (% 617-373-4700).
Especially for art lovers
Art galleries cluster on Newbury Street in the Back Bay and Harrison
Avenue in the South End and dot many other Boston and Cambridge
neighborhoods. If you enjoy seeing workspaces as well as the final prod-
uct, visit www.bostonopenstudios.org while you’re planning or check
the Friday, Saturday, or Sunday Globe when you arrive to see whether
one of the area’s artist-intensive neighborhoods has scheduled “open
studios” during your visit. Or just head to Newbury Street; the big names
tend to be near the Public Garden end, but the whole street is worth
wandering. At your first stop, pick up a copy of the free Gallery Guide.
When strolling along Newbury Street, remember to look above the first
floor, where you’re sure to find many more galleries.
Harvard University Art Museums
Cambridge
Harvard’s three art museums house more than 200,000 works. The Fogg
Art Museum consists of 19 rooms, each displaying something different,
from 17th-century Dutch landscapes to contemporary sculpture. The
Busch-Reisinger Museum is the only museum in North America devoted
to the art of northern and central Europe, specifically Germany. The
Arthur M. Sackler Museum houses the university’s collections of Asian,
ancient, Islamic, and later Indian art.

For something different
Mapparium/Mary Baker Eddy Library
Back Bay
One of the most unusual attractions anywhere, the Mapparium is a hollow
glass globe 30 feet across. The 608 stained-glass panels show the political
divisions of the world as they were from 1932 to 1935, during the globe’s
construction. Visitors walk through the globe on a bridge below the equa-
tor, enjoying the view and the unusual acoustics. The Mapparium is part
of the Mary Baker Eddy Library, a research center that includes two floors
of multimedia and interactive exhibits.

This museum highlights the history of blacks in Boston and Massachusetts
with fascinating displays and interactive exhibits. The complex includes
the African Meeting House, 8 Smith Court, also known as the “Black
Faneuil Hall.” This place of worship is the oldest standing black church in
the United States (1806).

For architecture admirers
Sheer variety makes Boston a unique treat for architecture buffs. Areas
that boast fairly consistent style include Beacon Hill, where Federal-era
construction abounds (and Draconian zoning keeps things that way),
and the Back Bay, which didn’t exist until the 1830s and remains a 19th-
century showpiece. Elsewhere in Boston and Cambridge, the most
enjoyable feature is the juxtaposition of classic and cutting edge.
Here’s a convenient twist: Two of the city’s architectural gems face each
other across Copley Square.
Boston Public Library
Copley Square
This library is home to a museum-quality art collection — and that’s just
in the main entrance. The 1895 building, an Italian Renaissance–style
design by Charles F. McKim, overflows with gorgeous doors, murals, fres-
coes, sculptures, and paintings. Pick up a brochure, or take a free Art and
Architecture Tour. The 30-minute excursions focus on the McKim build-
ing, which boasts ornamentation by such late-19th-century giants as John
Singer Sargent, Daniel Chester French, and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.
700 Boylston St. % 617-536-5400. www.bpl.org. T: Copley (Green Line) or Back

Thurs and Sat 11 a.m., Sun (Sept–May only) 2 p.m.
Trinity Church
Copley Square
This Romanesque masterwork by H. H. Richardson sits across the square
from the Boston Public Library. Completed in 1877, the church rests on a
foundation of 4,502 vertical supports called pilings. (Remember, most of
the Back Bay is landfill.) Brochures and guides can direct you around the
building, one of the finest examples of American church architecture. On
Fridays, you can enjoy an organ recital beginning at 12:15 p.m.

For history buffs
The Paul Revere House (see “The Freedom Trail,” earlier in this chap-
ter) is the foremost historic house in Boston but hardly the only one.
Charles Bulfinch, the renowned Federal-era architect, designed two
Beacon Hill houses that are open for tours; another residence nearby
offers a look at a later era. You must take a tour to visit these house
museums. Across the river, you can walk in the footsteps of one of the
most famous American poets. A tour is not mandatory but greatly
enhances the experience.
Otis House Museum
Beacon Hill
Charles Bulfinch designed this house in 1796 for a promising lawyer who
was later mayor of Boston. The historic furnishings and anecdote-laden
tour give a sense of the life of a prosperous family in the young republic.

Longfellow National Historic Site
Cambridge/Harvard Square
The books and furnishings at Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s longtime
home have remained intact since the legendary poet died in 1882. The
house was already famous: When the British laid siege to Boston in the
winter of 1775 to 1776, General George Washington made camp here. The
ranger-led tour tells the story of the lovely house and famous occupants.

late in the season. Tours: 10:30 and 11:30 a.m., 1, 2, 3, and 4 p.m.
Nichols House Museum
Beacon Hill
The furnishings and fine art at the 1804 house reflect the taste of several
generations of the Nichols family. Charles Bulfinch designed the building
(and the neighboring one at number 57), which was a family home before
becoming a museum in 1960. The neighborhood’s only private-house
museum, it’s a singular chance to see how the upper crust lived.

Gibson House Museum
Back Bay
This 1859 house overflows with elaborate decorations that personify the
word Victorian. To modern eyes, that seems synonymous with “over the
top.” The only design element more outrageous than the ornamentation
is the accessories — including a little pink pagoda for the cat.

For a walk in the park
The Public Garden (see listing earlier in this chapter) will probably sat-
isfy most horticultural cravings. Its gorgeous seasonal plantings (which
change as soon as specimens start looking tired) complement a variety
of trees and shrubs arranged to allow aimless strolling and quiet con-
templation. Nature fans can also visit the following attraction.
Arnold Arboretum
Jamaica Plain
Devoted green thumbs may want to set aside half a day for a trip to this
botanical garden. Founded in 1872, it’s one of the country’s oldest parks,
with about 15,000 ornamental trees, shrubs, and vines from all over the
world on its 265 acres. The lilacs are especially noteworthy.

For more Cambridge destinations
The MIT campus isn’t just for students. Just a mile or so down Mass.
Ave. from Harvard Square, across the Charles River from Beacon Hill and
the Back Bay, it’s a great place to spend a few hours. To get there, take
the bus, the subway, or a stroll along the river.

Whale-watching
The waters off New England are choice whale-migration territory, and
Boston is a center of whale-watching. The magnificent mammals seek
out the feeding grounds of Stellwagen Bank, which extend from
Gloucester to Provincetown about 27 miles east of Boston. The most
common species are the finback and humpback, but you may also see
minke whales and rare right whales. The aquatic mammals often per-
form for spectators by jumping out of the water, and dolphins some-
times join the show. Trained naturalists serve as tour guides, identifying
animals and interpreting activities.
The trip to the bank is long. (Children who are accustomed to immediate
gratification may not appreciate the journey.) The tedium vanishes in an
instant when the first whale appears.
Dress in plenty of layers to fend off the cool sea air, and add sunglasses,
a hat, and rubber-soled shoes. Don’t forget sunscreen and, of course, a
camera. If you tend to suffer from motion sickness, take precautions
before you leave the dock.
New England Aquarium whale-watching expeditions (% 617-973-5200
for information, 617-973-5206 for tickets; www.newenglandaquarium.org)
Chapter 11: Discovering Boston’s Best Attractions 173

operate daily from May through mid-October and on weekends in April
and late October. On-board hands-on exhibits help pass the time and
prepare passengers for spotting duty. The trips take four to five hours;
check departure times when you make reservations. Tickets are $35 for
adults, $32 for seniors and college students, and $29 for children 3 to 11.
Children must be 3 years old and at least 30 inches tall. Reservations are
strongly recommended. The T stop is Aquarium (Blue Line).
If the aquarium whale-watches are booked, try Boston Harbor Cruises
(% 617-227-4321; www.bostonharborcruises.com) or Massachusetts
Bay Lines (% 617-542-8000; www.massbaylines.com).
Seeing Boston by Guided Tour
The most important question about guided tours is “Why?” If your time
is limited, you have trouble getting around, or you haven’t a clue what to
expect from Boston, a general tour may be right for you. Visitors inter-
ested in a particular topic often want a guide who knows the details
cold. And if you crave something offbeat, Boston has tours that cover
land and water.
“Why not?” is an equally good question. Maybe a day trundling off and
on a trolley sounds touristy, or you can’t bear the cookie-cutter same-
ness of standard tours. Don’t let that turn you off all tours, though — a
special-interest walking tour may be perfect. One thing to note: Don’t
waste money on a tour ticket that covers a whole day if you think one
circuit of a trolley is all you need (or can stand). You’ll be cheating your-
self out of the rich experiences you can enjoy only at ground level.
Boston offers four main types of guided tours: walking, trolley (a bus
with a trolley-style body), cruise, and duck.
 Walking tours place you face to face with the city. Boston abounds
with small pleasures — a whiff of ocean air, sunlight through a
blown-glass window — and walking tours put you in touch with
them. But the tours don’t cover everything. Most are brief, and
they can be tiring. And most regularly scheduled walking tours
don’t run in winter.
 For an overview, a narrated trolley tour can be a reasonable
option. You can choose specific attractions on which to focus or
take advantage of the all-day pass to visit as many places as you
can. Some trolley stops, especially in the North End, lie some dis-
tance from the attractions. And piling off a trolley with a little
sticker on your shirt (it allows you to reboard) is very much a “typ-
ical tourist” thing. But these tours operate year-round.
 Sightseeing cruises offer sensational scenery and an unusual van-
tage point. Tours on the Inner Harbor pass the airport (a hit with
aviation buffs), include some maritime history, and make pleasant
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
174

alternatives to walking or driving. But these generally pricey tours
aren’t comprehensive or long-lasting, and they close for the winter.
 Boston Duck Tours, the only amphibious operation in town, offers
a great deal of fun for a fair amount of money. These tours, too,
shut down in cold weather.
Walking tours
Check the Thursday Globe “Calendar” section when you arrive to see
whether any operators are offering special-interest or one-shot tours to
coincide with events or anniversaries during your visit.
Free 90-minute Freedom Trail walking tours with National Park Service
rangers as guides start as often as four times a day during busy periods,
once daily in the winter. These tours cover the “heart” of the trail, from
the Old South Meeting House to the Old North Church (see “The Freedom
Trail,” earlier in this chapter). Schedules change seasonally. You don’t
need reservations, but try to arrive 30 minutes prior to the start of the
tour, especially during busy times; groups are no larger than 30 people.
Tours depart from the Visitor Center, 15 State St. (T: State [Orange or
Blue Line]; % 617-242-5642; www.nps.gov/bost), off Washington 
Street across from the Old State House. Call to check on tour times 
and schedules.
The best private walking tour provider is the nonprofit organization
Boston by Foot (% 617-367-2345; www.bostonbyfoot.com). From May
through October, this company offers historical and architectural tours
that concentrate on certain neighborhoods and topics. The volunteer
guides love the subjects — they pay for their own training! — and wel-
come questions. The 90-minute tours run rain or shine; you don’t need
reservations. Buy tickets ($12 for adults, $8 for children age 6–12) from
the guide. Excursions that leave from Faneuil Hall meet at the statue of
Samuel Adams on Congress Street. The regularly scheduled tours
include the following:
 The “Heart of the Freedom Trail” tour starts at Faneuil Hall daily
at 10 a.m.
 The Beacon Hill tour starts at the foot of the State House steps on
Beacon Street weekdays at 5:30 p.m., Saturday at 10 a.m., and
Sunday at 2 p.m.
 The Victorian Back Bay tour starts at the steps of Trinity Church at
10 a.m. Friday and Sunday and at 5:30 p.m. Monday.
 The North End tour starts at Faneuil Hall on Friday and Saturday 
at 2 p.m.
 The “Boston Underfoot” tour ($14 for adults, including T fare)
includes the subway and the Big Dig. This tour starts in front of the
State House steps Sunday at 2 p.m.
Chapter 11: Discovering Boston’s Best Attractions 175

 The “Literary Landmarks” tour starts at Borders, 10–24 School St.,
at Washington Street, at 2 p.m. on Saturday.
 The “Boston by Little Feet” tour for 6- to 12-year-olds spends 60
minutes concentrating on the architecture along the Freedom Trail
and on Boston’s role in the American Revolution. Children must be
with an adult; tickets are $8 apiece. This tour starts at the statue 
of Samuel Adams on the Congress Street side of Faneuil Hall on
Saturday at 10 a.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., and Monday at 10 a.m. — 
rain or shine.
Historic New England (% 617-227-3956; www.historicnewengland.org)
offers a tour that focuses on life in the upstairs/downstairs world of
Beacon Hill in 1800. “Magnificent and Modest” ($12) starts at the Otis
House Museum, 141 Cambridge St. (see “For history buffs,” earlier in 
this chapter), at 11 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays from May through
October. The price includes a tour of the museum; reservations are 
recommended.
The Boston Park Rangers (% 617-635-7383; www.cityofboston.gov/
parks) offer free tours of the “Emerald Necklace,” pioneering landscape
architect Frederick Law Olmsted’s loop of green spaces. The tours
include Boston Common, the Public Garden, the Commonwealth Avenue
Mall, the Muddy River in the Fenway, Olmsted Park, Jamaica Pond, the
Arnold Arboretum, and Franklin Park. The full six-hour walk happens
only a few times a year; one-hour tours that highlight a location or
theme take place year-round. Check ahead for topics and schedules.
From October through early May, free volunteer-led tours of Symphony
Hall, 301 Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-266-1492; www.bso.org), take 
visitors around the landmark building and relate the Boston Symphony
Orchestra’s fascinating history. The hour-long tours start on Wednesday
at 4:30 p.m., except during the last three weeks of December, and on the
first Saturday of each month at 1:30 p.m. Reservations aren’t necessary;
meet in the lobby at the Mass. Ave. entrance. For information about per-
formances, see Chapter 15.
National Park Service rangers lead free two-hour walking tours of the
Black Heritage Trail, a 1.6-mile route on Beacon Hill that includes sta-
tions of the underground railroad, homes of famous citizens, and the
first integrated public school. Tours leave from the Visitor Center, 46 Joy
St. (% 617-742-5415; www.nps.gov/boaf); check ahead for schedules.
To explore on your own, pick up a brochure from the Visitor Center;
these brochures include maps and descriptions of the buildings.
The Boston Women’s Heritage Trail creates walking tours that include
homes, churches, and social and political institutions associated with
influential women. You can buy a guide at the National Park Service
Visitor Center at 15 State St.; you can also check local bookstores and
historic sites. For more detailed information, call % 617-522-2872 or
visit www.bwht.org.

Trolley tours
These popular tours are an easy way to “see” everything without getting
a good sense of what Boston is like. Don’t fall into that trap — if you can
manage the journey, climb down and look around.
The cutthroat competition among operators makes their offerings virtu-
ally indistinguishable. Each has slightly different stops, but all cover the
major attractions. The 90- to 120-minute tours usually include a map and
all-day reboarding (so that you don’t have to do it all at once).
The guide makes or breaks the tour; if you have time, shop around to
find one you particularly like before you pay (ask for a tryout). Local
news outlets periodically “break” the story that guides are embellishing
the facts in narratives (a whole summer of reciting the same stories
would probably get to you, too), but most are on the level. And some of
the most improbable-sounding stories are actually true. (For example,
Trinity Church really is built on wooden pilings and the story of a woman
and her lover buried alive by her husband truly did inspire Edgar Allan
Poe’s creepy story “The Cask of Amontillado.”)
Trolley tickets cost $30 to $35 for adults, $12 or less for kids; check Web
sites or the brochure rack at your hotel for discounts and special offers.
Stops usually are at hotels, attractions, and tourist information centers.
To start, look for busy waiting areas where you can check out the guides
to see whether you click with one. Trolleys line up near the New England
Aquarium and near the corner of Boylston Street and Charles Street
South, where the Common meets the Public Garden.
Each company has cars painted a different color. Orange-and-green Old
Town Trolleys (% 617-269-7150; www.trolleytours.com) are the
most numerous. Beantown Trolleys (% 800-343-1328 or 781-986-6100;
www.grayline.com) are red, and CityView Trolleys (% 617-363-7899;
www.cityviewtrolleys.com) are silver. The Discover Boston Trolley
Tours (% 617-742-1440) vehicle is white; tours are available with taped
narration translated into Japanese, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.
Special-interest trolley tours change from time to time, depending on
demand. Always make a reservation. A perennially popular evening-only
option is Ghosts and Gravestones (% 617-269-3626; www.ghostsand
gravestones.com); a guide in a gravedigger costume leads this tour,
which focuses on the eerie side of Boston’s history. The 90-minute tours,
which involve some walking, cost $32 for adults, $19 for children age 3 to
12 (but aren’t recommended for very young kids).
Sightseeing cruises
Seeing Boston from the water gives you a sense of the city’s maritime
history — and confirms that (except in winter) the water is cooler than
the land. On a sweaty summer day, a breezy cruise makes an enjoyable
break from a march along the tourist track. The new perspective will
Chapter 11: Discovering Boston’s Best Attractions 177

help you remember that the city remains an active port, and the sheer
number of sailboats will make you wonder if every office in Boston is
empty.
The season for narrated cruises runs April through October, with spring
and fall offerings usually on weekends only. If you get seasick, check the
size of the vessel before you pay; larger boats are more comfortable.
Boston Harbor Cruises, 1 Long Wharf (% 877-SEE-WHALE or 617-227-
4321; www.bostonharborcruises.com), operates 90-minute historic
tours of the Inner and Outer Harbor at 11 a.m., 1 and 3 p.m., and 6 or 7
p.m. (the sunset cruise). Tickets are $19 for adults, $17 for seniors, and
$15 for children 4 to 12. The 45-minute Constitution round-trip cruise
takes you around the Inner Harbor and docks at the Charlestown Navy
Yard so that you can go ashore and visit “Old Ironsides.” Tours start
every hour on the half-hour from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and leave the
Navy Yard on the hour from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets are $14 for adults,
$12 for seniors, and $10 for children. Trips leave from Long Wharf, off
Atlantic Avenue between the New England Aquarium and the Marriott.
The Charles Riverboat Company (% 617-621-3001; www.charles
riverboat.com; T: Lechmere [Green Line]) operates out of the Cam-
bridgeSide Galleria mall, on First Street in East Cambridge. From the
Charles, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Boston (including the
towers of the Back Bay) and Cambridge (the landmark dome indicates
that you’re approaching MIT). The 55-minute cruises depart seven times
a day, daily in June, July, and August and on weekends only in May and
September. Call for the time of the sunset cruise. Tickets (cash only) are
$12 for adults, $10 for seniors, and $6 for children 2 to 12.
The cheapest “cruise” is the $1.70 ferry ride from Long Wharf to the
Charlestown Navy Yard. The MBTA’s LinkPass (see Chapter 8) covers the
ferry, which makes a great way to finish the Freedom Trail.
Boston Light is North America’s oldest lighthouse (1716) and the only
lighthouse in the country that’s still staffed by the Coast Guard. Excur-
sions to the 102-foot lighthouse include a narrated cruise; 90 minutes to
explore the island; and, if you’re at least 50 inches tall, a chance to climb
the spiral stairs to the top. The three-and-a-half-hour tours leave from
the Moakley Courthouse at Fan Pier, 2 Northern Ave. Trips run from mid-
June to early October, Thursday at 10 a.m. and Friday through Sunday at
10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Tickets cost $28 for adults, $25 for seniors, $17 for
children 3 to 11, free for children younger than 3. Only 50 people may
take each tour; reservations (% 617-223-8666; www.bostonislands.
com) are strongly recommended.
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
178

Duck tours
The most unusual excursions in town are 80-minute Boston Duck Tours
(% 800-226-7442 or 617-723-DUCK; www.bostonducktours.com), which
operate from April through November. These tours are relatively expen-
sive, but you definitely get your money’s worth. The vehicles are recon-
ditioned World War II amphibious landing craft known as “ducks” — and,
like the real thing, they move easily between land and water. Tours leave
from behind the Prudential Center on Huntington Avenue or from the
Museum of Science. Your duck cruises around Boston, passes most of
the major sights, and then heads to the Charles River dam and right into
the water for a 20-minute turn around the basin.
Tickets, available at the Prudential Center, the Museum of Science, and
Faneuil Hall Marketplace, cost $27 for adults, $24 for seniors and stu-
dents, $18 for children 3 to 11, and $5 for children younger than 3. Tours
run every 30 or 60 minutes from 9 a.m. to 1 hour before sunset. Reser-
vations are not accepted for groups of fewer than 20, and tickets usually
sell out, especially on weekends. Try to buy same-day tickets early in the
day (the booths open at 8:30 a.m.), purchase tickets online (subject to a
per-ticket service fee), or check ahead for tickets available starting five
days in advance. Tours do not run from December through March.

Chapter 12
Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter
 Checking out the big names and other famous labels
 Exploring the main shopping areas
 Finding the right place for what you want
B
efore you feel guilty about shopping when there’s so much sight-
seeing to do, consider this: Visitors to Boston consistently list
shopping as their favorite activity, even ahead of visiting museums.
Retail outlets of every description await you, from unusual boutiques to
indistinguishable chain stores. In this chapter, I concentrate on the off-
beat destinations, with plenty of attention to big national names and
retail-intensive neighborhoods. All over town, you’ll also find tons of
businesses you recognize from the mall at home.
Unless otherwise noted, see the “Boston Shopping” map in this chapter
for the locations of the stores I mention.
Surveying the Scene
The first thing to know is that the 5 percent Massachusetts sales tax
doesn’t apply to clothing priced below $175 or to food items. (The 5 per-
cent meal tax applies to takeout, though.) On each article of clothing
that costs $175 or more, the tax applies only to the amount over $175.
But if you’re shipping merchandise to a state where the store has a
branch, the sales tax for that state usually applies.
Stores usually open at 9:30 or 10 a.m. and close at around 6 or 7 p.m. 
A few don’t open on Sunday, but most do, from noon to 5 or 6 p.m.
Exceptions include shopping malls, which stay open later; art galleries,
which typically don’t open until 11 a.m. and are closed on Monday; and
smaller shops, which often keep odd hours. When in doubt, call ahead.
Checking Out the Big Names
The biggest name in Boston shopping is Filene’s Basement, 426 Wash-
ington St., at Summer Street (% 617-542-2011; www.filenesbasement.

com). Founded in Boston in 1908, “the Basement” (now part of a Mid-
western chain) has outlived its original parent company and maintained
the cachet accumulated in a century of great deals on men’s, women’s,
and children’s clothing and accessories.
The famed “automatic markdown” policy applies only at this store. After
merchandise has been on the racks for four weeks, the price drops by 
25 percent. Boards hanging from the ceiling bear the all-important dates;
the original sale date is on the back of the price tag. Prices continue to
fall until, after eight weeks (and 75 percent off), everything remaining
goes to charity. With the rise of other discount chains, killer deals are
harder to find here than they once were — which makes a hard-earned
bargain all the sweeter. To fit in with the locals, be aggressive, and don’t
be shy about telling people how much — actually, how little — you paid
for that stunning designer outfit. And if you can’t make up your mind
about something, just buy it. You can always return merchandise, but
you can’t always come back and find that special something the next
day. Yes, this is the voice of experience talking.
The store is open weekdays 9:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 
7:30 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Hours may vary during special
sales. Crowds can be huge at lunch and after work; try to shop in the
morning or midafternoon. Take the T to Downtown Crossing (Red or
Orange Line); enter directly from the station or through Filene’s, the
unaffiliated department store upstairs.
Filene’s Basement has a branch in the Back Bay, at 497 Boylston St. (at
Clarendon Street; % 617-424-5520). Many of Boston’s other high-profile
retailers are branches, often of chains based in New York. I single out a
few in the neighborhood descriptions that appear later in this chapter;
for that only-in-Boston feeling, check out the following:
 The Museum of Fine Arts (www.mfa.org) operates a satellite gift
shop in the South Market Building at Faneuil Hall Marketplace 
(% 617-720-1266). Though far smaller than the real thing, it makes
a fine substitute, especially if you’re short on time.
 Newbury Comics (www.newbury.com) is a Boston-based regional
chain of fantastic music stores that responded to the online-music
boom — and outlasted its national and international competitors —
by beefing up its selections of gifts and comics. Here are three handy
locations: 332 Newbury St., Back Bay (% 617-236-4930); 1 Washing-
ton Mall, Washington Street off State Street, Downtown Crossing 
(% 617-248-9992); and 36 John F. Kennedy St., in the Garage mall,
Harvard Square, Cambridge (% 617-491-0337).
 Shreve, Crump & Low, 440 Boylston St., Back Bay (% 617-267-
9100; www.shrevecrumpandlow.com), is the oldest jewelry store in
the country; it opened in 1796. At press time, “Shreve’s” was refo-
cusing on the classic baubles that established it as Boston’s answer
to Tiffany’s. Check out the estate jewelry.

Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 183

Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
Here, I zero in on some consumer-friendly areas and single out some
favorite stops. By no means does that suggest that these areas are the
only parts of town worth strolling through or that the shops I mention
are the only ones you should visit. Ask at your hotel if you have a spe-
cific item in mind. Or just follow your nose.
The Back Bay
From name-dropping socialites to skateboarders in droopy pants, every-
one shops in the Back Bay. The main shopping streets are Newbury and
Boylston (T: Arlington or Copley [Green Line]).
For locations of shops on Newbury Street, see the “Newbury Street
Shopping” map in this chapter.
Newbury Street is the Rodeo Drive of New England, home of the area’s
toniest boutiques and art galleries. It’s a retail wonderland from Arling-
ton Street — where you find Chanel, 15 Arlington St., in the Taj Boston
(% 617-859-0055; www.chanel.com), and Burberry, 2 Newbury St. 
(% 617-236-1000; www.burberry.com) — to Mass. Ave., where a branch
of Best Buy, 360 Newbury St. (% 888-BEST-BUY; www.bestbuy.com),
faces Urban Outfitters, 361 Newbury St. (% 617-236-0088; www.urban
outfitters.com). You’ll see a huge assortment of other famous names,
including dozens of upscale fashion brands. As a rule, the merchandise
gets funkier — but not necessarily cheaper — the farther you get from
the Public Garden.
I tend to seek out smaller retailers that celebrate specialties in an 
attitude-free parallel universe: for exquisite jewelry, John Lewis, Inc., 97
Newbury St. (% 617-266-6665; www.johnlewisinc.com); for museum-
quality artisan work, the Society of Arts and Crafts, 175 Newbury St. 
(% 617-266-1810; www.societyofcrafts.org); and for Gothic home
accessories (not as far-out as it sounds), Gargoyles, Grotesques &
Chimeras, 262 Newbury St. (% 617-536-2362). Though they’re part of
chains, two skin-care and bath-product purveyors are well worth a visit:
Lush, 166 Newbury St. (% 617-375-5874; www.lush.com), and Kiehl’s,
112 Newbury St. (% 617-247-1777; www.kiehls.com). And when you
need a pick-me-up, bypass the coffee purveyors and make a beeline 
for — talk about truth in advertising — the well-stocked candy store
Sugar Heaven, 218 Newbury St. (% 617-266-6969; www.sugarheaven.us).
Dozens of art galleries are Newbury Street’s other claim to fame. Pick up
a copy of the free Gallery Guide (at any gallery and many other busi-
nesses), or start at Arlington Street and work your way west. Remember
that some of the most interesting collections are above ground level.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions — the people hanging around the
gallery, who often include the manager, love to talk about the art. 
You’re sure to find a gallery that matches your taste; my favorite is

Newbury Street Shopping
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 185

the International Poster Gallery, 205 Newbury St. (% 617-375-0076;
www.internationalposter.com).
Boylston Street retail really gets going at Arlington Street, with Hermès
of Paris, 22 Arlington St. (% 617-482-8707; www.hermes.com), and
extends past the entrance to the Shops at Prudential Center (see later
in this section). This street is where you find the Boston branch of Paper
Source, 338 Boylston St. (% 617-536-3444; www.paper-source.com),
which carries stationery from formal to whimsical and offers a delightful
selection of gifts. Branches of chains here include Restoration Hard-
ware, 711 Boylston St. (% 617-578-0088; www.restorationhardware.
com), and Lord & Taylor, 760 Boylston St. (% 617-262-6000; www.lord
andtaylor.com).
Boylston Street also holds one entrance to the giant consumer wonder-
land of the Shops at Prudential Center, 800 Boylston St. (T: Prudential
[Green Line E] or Back Bay [Orange Line]; % 800-SHOP-PRU or 617-267-
1002; www.prudentialcenter.com), and Copley Place, 100 Huntington
Ave. (% 617-375-4400; www.shopcopleyplace.com). Skybridges link
the malls, which incorporate dozens of national chains that allow you to
pretend you’ve never left home, plus a smattering of unique boutiques.
The “Pru” contains a food court; a Legal Sea Foods (% 617-266-6800)
restaurant (see Chapter 10); a huge Barnes & Noble (% 617-247-6959;
www.barnesandnoble.com); a branch of the cosmetics wonderland
Sephora (% 617-262-4200; www.sephora.com) and of Club Monaco
(% 617-262-2658; www.clubmonaco.com), for upscale, trendy women’s
and men’s clothing; dozens of other shops; an entrance to Saks Fifth
Avenue (% 617-262-8500; www.saksfifthavenue.com); and various
pushcarts that sell souvenirs, crafts, and accessories. The Greater
Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau (% 800-SEE-BOSTON or 617-536-
4100; www.bostonusa.com) operates the information booth.
Copley Place is a more upscale complex — Tiffany & Co. (% 617-353-
0222; www.tiffany.com) is one of the first stores you see as you enter
from the Pru. Neiman Marcus (% 617-536-3660; www.neimanmarcus.
com) is the anchor store; its neighbors include such big names as
Barneys New York (% 617-385-3300; www.barneys.com), Gucci
(% 617-247-3000; www.gucci.com), Jimmy Choo (% 617-927-9570;
www.jimmychoo.com), London haberdasher Thomas Pink (% 617-267-
0447; www.thomaspink.com), and Legal Sea Foods (% 617-266-7775).
Independent retailers tend not to thrive in this location; a welcome
exception is the Artful Hand Gallery (% 617-262-9601), which carries 
a discriminating selection of jewelry, wood and glass pieces, ceramics,
and sculpture.
Faneuil Hall Marketplace
Boston’s top attraction, Faneuil Hall Marketplace (T: Government Center
[Green or Blue Line]; % 617-338-2323; www.faneuilhallmarketplace.
com) draws much of its appeal from abundant consumer enticements.
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
186

Most street-level shops are chain outlets that you’d see in the mall at
home. Somewhat less common names include fly-fishing and sportswear
specialist Orvis (% 617-742-0288; www.orvis.com), Urban Outfitters
(% 617-523-0651; www.urbanoutfitters.com), and a free-standing
branch of department-store cosmetics favorite Origins (% 617-742-
7447; www.origins.com). Second-floor shops tend to be quirkier inde-
pendents, as do the pushcarts that cluster between the North Market
Building and Quincy Market.
Charles Street
Beacon Hill’s main street is both a neighborhood hangout and a gift-shop
magnet. Charles Street (T: Charles/MGH [Red Line]) is also home to
some excellent antiques shops and a curiously refined 7-Eleven —
thanks to the strict zoning laws that cover the landmark district.
Head for a specific destination, or just stroll up one side of the street
and down the other. My favorite gift shops are Koo De Kir, 34 Charles St.
(% 617-723-8111; www.koodekir.com), and Black Ink, 101 Charles St.
(% 617-723-3883; www.blackinkboston.com). Upstairs Downstairs
Antiques, 93 Charles St. (% 617-367-1950), is a good place to start
antiques hunting.
Downtown Crossing
At the corner of Washington and Summer streets lies the intersection
that gives its name to Downtown Crossing (T: Downtown Crossing [Red
or Orange Line]). Here you’ll find Macy’s, 450 Washington St. (% 617-
357-3000; www.macys.com), and within a block or three are Filene’s
Basement (see “Checking Out the Big Names,” earlier in this chapter),
dozens of other shops, and a healthy variety of pushcarts. The shopping
here isn’t as highfalutin as in the Back Bay or as touristy as at Faneuil
Hall Marketplace. Downtown Crossing is where the locals shop.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 187
Craft shows
New England is a hotbed of fine craft creation, and the Boston area affords many
opportunities to explore the latest trends in every medium and style you can imagine.
Prominent artisans often have exclusive relationships with galleries, so an excellent
way to get an overview is to attend a show and sale. The best-known craft exhibitions
are prestigious weekend events that benefit nonprofit organizations. Crafts at the
Castle (% 617-523-6400, ext. 5987; www.fsgb.org/catc.htm) takes place in late
November or early December at the Hynes Convention Center, 900 Boylston St., and
CraftBoston (% 617-266-1810; www.craftboston.org) is in late March or early
April at the World Trade Center.

Washington and Winter streets overflow with discount clothing and shoe
stores, souvenir carts, and places for office workers to grab a quick
lunch. An exception is the tony British haberdasher Thomas Pink, 280
Washington St. (% 617-426-7859; www.thomaspink.com). Another
Bostonian necessity is a well-stocked bookstore, and Downtown Cros-
sing has two. Borders, 10–24 School St. (% 617-557-7188; www.borders.
com), carries a predictably huge range of books, music, and movies. The
stock at the Brattle Book Shop, 9 West St. (off Washington Street; % 800-
447-9595 or 617-542-0210; www.brattlebookshop.com), is an unpre-
dictably huge assortment of used, rare, and out-of-print titles.
The North End
The North End is known for its authentic, delicious pasta dinners. In
Chapter 10, I tell you where to find my favorite restaurants in this neigh-
borhood. But if you want to make your own pasta back home, the North
End (T: Haymarket [Green or Orange Line]) is also the place to stock up.
Italian groceries and fresh meats and cheeses cram the tiny Salumeria
Italiana, 151 Richmond St. (% 617-523-8743; www.salumeriaitaliana.
com). Your sweet tooth can lead you to Dairy Fresh Candies, 57 Salem
St. (% 800-336-5536 or 617-742-2639; www.dairyfreshcandies.com).
The neighborhood has nonfood retailers, too. For unique and unusual
gifts, crafts, and jewelry, visit Shake the Tree Gallery, 95 Salem St. (% 617-
742-0484). The inventive and classic designs at High Gear Jewelry,
204 Hanover St. (% 617-523-5804), on the Freedom Trail, are catnip to
costume-jewelry fans.
Cambridge
Harvard Square (T: Harvard [Red Line]) grows less individualized by
the day, but this area is still worth a trip if you know where to look.
Bookstore enthusiasts and T-shirt collectors will be particularly happy.
(For locations of stores in this section, see the “Harvard Square
Shopping” map.)
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
188
Fired up
A good souvenir is something you’d never find anywhere else, and a Boston Fire
Department T-shirt is a great one. They cost about $15 at most neighborhood fire-
houses. The handiest for out-of-towners are Engine 8, Ladder 1, on Hanover Street at
Charter Street in the North End (off the Freedom Trail), and Ladder 15, Engine 33, on
Boylston Street at Hereford Street in the Back Bay (near the Hynes Convention Center).

Harvard Square Shopping
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 189
Agreeable chain stores in the neighborhood include Urban Outfitters, 
11 John F. Kennedy St. (% 617-864-0070; www.urbanoutfitters.com),
Lush, 30 John F. Kennedy St. (% 617-497-5874; www.lush.com), and
Barnes & Noble, which runs the book operation at the Harvard Coop,
1400 Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-499-2000; www.thecoop.com).
“The Square” is great for window-shopping, and the best displays are at
Calliope, 33 Brattle St. (% 617-876-4149), a terrific children’s clothing
and toy store. Colonial Drug, 49 Brattle St. (% 617-864-2222), a family
business that specializes in hard-to-find fragrances, is 1 block away. A sib-
ling of the Beacon Hill favorite, Black Ink, 5 Brattle St. (% 617-497-1221),

is one of the best places in Harvard Square for that I’ll-know-it-when-I-
see-it perfect gift. A more distant relative — a cousin, perhaps — is the
Museum of Useful Things, 49 Brattle St. (% 617-576-3322; www.themut.
com), which stocks stylish yet utilitarian items for the home and office.
Now, how about those bookstores? One of the area’s best general-interest
stores is here: the Harvard Book Store, 1256 Massachusetts Ave. 
(% 800-542-READ outside the 617 area code, or 617-661-1515; www.
harvard.com). The basement overflows with discounted and used
books.
Two worthwhile special-interest bookstores are Curious George Goes to
WordsWorth, 1 John F. Kennedy St. (% 617-498-0062; www.curiousg.
com), an excellent children’s store, and the Globe Corner Bookstore,
90 Mount Auburn St. (% 617-497-6277; www.globecorner.com), where
you’ll find travel books, maps, narratives, and atlases.
Harvard Square also makes a good starting point for a shopping stroll.
Mass. Ave. runs north to Porter Square (T: Porter [Red Line]) through
boutique country and southeast toward funkier Central Square (T:
Central [Red Line]). Heading toward Porter, be sure to leave time for 
a stop at Abodeon, 1713 Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-497-0137), a
quirky home-furnishings store; Joie de Vivre, 1792 Massachusetts Ave.
(% 617-864-8188), a superb gift shop with a great, kaleidoscope collec-
tion; and a branch of Paper Source, 1810 Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-
497-1077; www.paper-source.com), with its funky gifts and gorgeous
handmade papers. On the way to Central Square, you pass Bowl &
Board, 1063 Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-661-0350), which specializes 
in upscale home accessories, and The Games People Play, 1100 Massa-
chusetts Ave. (% 800-696-0711 or 617-492-0711), which carries tons of
board games, as well as puzzles, chess sets, and more. Just outside
Central Square, Ten Thousand Villages, 694 Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-
876-2414; www.tenthousandvillages.com), is part of a nonprofit craft-
and-gift-shop chain; a friend of mine fondly calls it “the Third-World
tchotchke emporium.” This fair trade organization provides a way for
artisans in poor countries around the world to make a living (in case,
unlike me, you need an excuse to go shopping).
In East Cambridge, the CambridgeSide Galleria, 100 CambridgeSide
Place (% 617-621-8666; www.shopcambridgeside.com), is a three-level
mall that would be at home in any suburb in the country. It holds more
than 100 specialty stores, including a huge J. Crew store (% 617-225-
2739; www.jcrew.com), a branch of Borders (% 617-679-0887; www.
borders.com), several restaurants, and a food court. Part of the appeal
is how astonishingly generic this place is; it may be just the bargaining
chip you need to lure your teenagers to the nearby Museum of Science.
T: Lechmere (Green Line) and then walk 2 blocks. Or Kendall/MIT (Red
Line) and then the free shuttle bus, which runs every 10 to 20 minutes
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. and Sunday from 
11 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Chapter 13
Following an Itinerary:
Seven Great Options
In This Chapter
 Plotting one-, three-, and five-day adventures
 Keeping the kids entertained
 Dabbling in the art world
 Playing, watching, and loving sports
 Reliving history
F
rom the moment you land in a new destination, you can almost hear
the clock ticking. An unfamiliar place offers so much for you to see,
and you never seem to have enough time to explore all the possibilities.
So consider two things: First, Boston is a compact place; you can get a
good sense of the city in a short time. Second, you can’t master any des-
tination of appreciable size in just a few days.
Do what you want with the time you have. Be realistic — for the record,
scheduling more than three major destinations in a day is trying to do
too much, and sometimes two is pushing it — and remember to sched-
ule some just-sitting-around time. In this chapter, I suggest outlines for
trips of certain durations or focuses; feel free to mix and match as you
see fit.
Boston in One Day
Two itineraries leap to mind if you can spend only one day in Boston:
You can concentrate on one attraction or neighborhood (such as the
Museum of Fine Arts, Harvard Square, Newbury Street, or the Museum of
Science) without the smallest pang about not doing more, or you can try
to sample enough of the city to get a sense that you’ve actually been
here, not just seen everything. Here, I offer suggestions for the latter.
This itinerary works in a loop — you can start at the beginning in the
morning or pick things up in the middle and go from there.

Start with an hour or less at Filene’s Basement (see Chapter 12). Be
there when it opens at 9:30 a.m., or earlier if the store is offering a spe-
cial sale — check the newspapers when you arrive. Then follow the
Freedom Trail from Boston Common to Faneuil Hall Marketplace or
take a 90-minute National Park Service ranger tour (see Chapter 11).
Have lunch at the marketplace (see Day 1 in the next itinerary, “Boston
in Three Days”) as you evaluate your options for what to do after lunch.
Pick one of these four: Finish the Freedom Trail, take a sightseeing
cruise (see Chapter 11), explore the New England Aquarium (see
Chapter 11), or head to the Children’s Museum (see Chapter 11). In the
late afternoon, make your way to the Back Bay and enjoy the view from
the Prudential Center Skywalk. Sunset is the perfect time to visit; let
your appetite and the time of year determine whether you eat dinner
before or after. If you can’t leave town without a lobster, three branches
of Legal Sea Foods (see Chapter 10) are close by. If trekking to the Back
Bay doesn’t appeal, have dinner at the waterfront Legal’s, and wander
over to the North End for dessert at a caffè (see Chapter 10).
Boston in Three Days
Day 1: In the morning, follow at least part of the Freedom Trail. The trail
officially starts at Boston Common, but you can start in Charlestown,
somewhere in the middle, or at the National Park Service Visitor Center
with a ranger tour (see Chapter 11). The trail takes at least two hours.
On the first section, consider a shopping detour to Filene’s Basement
(see Chapter 12), especially if you can get there before the lunch rush.
Break for coffee, snacks, or lunch at Faneuil Hall Marketplace, where
takeout counters and sit-down restaurants satisfy nearly every taste.
Durgin-Park (see Chapter 10) is a good choice for the latter. If the
weather is fine, take a picnic — stock up in the Quincy Market food
court — across Atlantic Avenue to Christopher Columbus Waterfront
Park.
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
194
On top of the world
The Prudential Center Skywalk, 800 Boylston St. (% 617-859-0648), offers a 360-
degree view of Boston and far beyond. From the enclosed observation deck on the
50th floor of the Prudential Tower, you can see for miles, even (when it’s clear) as far
as the mountains of southern New Hampshire to the north and the beaches of Cape
Cod to the south. Away from the windows, interactive audiovisual exhibits chronicle
the city’s history. Call before visiting because the space sometimes closes for private
events. Hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily from March through October, 10 a.m. to 8
p.m. daily in the winter. Admission is $11 for adults, $9 for seniors and students with ID,
$7.50 for children younger than 12; adults must show a photo ID to enter the Prudential
Tower. T: Green Line E to Prudential, or B, C, or D to Hynes/ICA.

In the afternoon, push on to the North End. Between the Paul Revere
House and the Old North Church, pause on Hanover Street for espresso
or cappuccino and a pastry at a caffè (see Chapter 10). If you opt to
finish the trail — and I’m not saying you have to — return downtown on
the MBTA ferry to Long Wharf from the Charlestown Navy Yard. When
you arrive at Long Wharf, look for a branch of Legal Sea Foods across
the street from the ferry dock; you can grab some dinner here (but first,
you may decide to visit your hotel to rest and wash up — the people at
the next table certainly will appreciate it). If all this activity sounds
exhausting, pick a restaurant near your hotel instead. If you’re still up
for more, make evening plans that include a trip to the Prudential Center
Skywalk or back to Faneuil Hall Marketplace before or after dinner.
Day 2: This is museum day. Be there when the doors open at the
Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) at 10 a.m., or the Museum of Science at 9
a.m., and plan to stay at least through midday — both museums offer
decent options for lunch. If art is your interest, consider spending part
of the afternoon at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, up the street
from the MFA. From the Museum of Science, a strenuous but rewarding
walk leads to the Bunker Hill Monument (the last stop on the Freedom
Trail, in case you didn’t get there on Day 1). The walk takes about 30
minutes, and most of it is uphill.
If none of that appeals to you, start the day at the John F. Kennedy
Library and Museum or the Children’s Museum.
Any of these options can land you in the Back Bay by midafternoon, the
perfect time for a Duck Tour, a Swan Boat ride, or just some downtime
in the Public Garden. Collect yourself and do a little shopping on New-
bury or Boylston Street (see Chapter 12). Freshen up and head to the
North End for a hearty Italian dinner. Follow with dessert and people-
watching in a Hanover Street caffè (especially if you didn’t indulge on
Day 1). Or plan a visit to a bar or club — maybe the Comedy Connec-
tion, Cheers, or the Black Rose, all at Faneuil Hall Marketplace (see
Chapter 16).
Check the forecast when you arrive; inclement weather may mean
scheduling your museum-visiting day to coincide with nasty outdoor
conditions.
Day 3: Now you’re off to Cambridge. This area can occupy a whole day
or just half. (If it’s the latter, use the extra time to further explore one of
the options in the Day 1 or 2 itineraries earlier in this section.) Start with
breakfast in the heart of Harvard Square — continental at Au Bon Pain,
1360 Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-497-9797), or full at the Greenhouse
Coffee Shop, 3 Brattle St. (% 617-354-3184). Then tour the Harvard
campus (see Chapter 11), visit one or more of the university museums

Darwins (see Chapter 10). In the afternoon, continue to explore or shop
in Cambridge, or head back to Boston. Spend this time hitting Filene’s
Basement, if you haven’t yet (or even if you have). For the evening, con-
sider activities that don’t strain your budget, starting with dinner at one
of Boston’s neighborhood restaurants (see Chapter 10). Follow with a
student play or performance, or a free concert or film. If you’re up for
another big night out, consider a Boston Symphony Orchestra perform-
ance or a pre- or post-Broadway play (see Chapter 15).

Boston in Five Days
If you have five days in Boston, follow the itinerary in the preceding sec-
tion for the first three days and then continue with the following:
Day 4: Road trip! Turn to Chapter 14, and pick a town or two where you
can spend the day. Explore Lexington, Concord, Salem, Marblehead,
Gloucester, Rockport, Plymouth, or some sensible combination thereof.
You don’t need to rent a car for this trip, but you may want to; at busy
times, book the car when you reserve your flight and hotel. Have dinner
at your day-trip destination, or return to Boston or Cambridge. After-
ward, you can hear jazz at the Regattabar in Cambridge or Scullers in
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Seven Great Options 199
Suggested evening itineraries
If you’re traveling as a family, you may be setting up your evening itineraries based on
the TV listings. If not — or if you had the foresight to book a sitter — here are some
suggestions. See Chapter 10 for detailed restaurant reviews and Chapters 15 and 16
for comprehensive nightlife listings. You can find all the following restaurants and
nightlife venues in those sections of this book.
 Dinner in the North End, and coffee and dessert at an Italian caffè. Afterward, a
show at the Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall or the Improv Asylum, and a drink
at the Cheers bar in Quincy Market.
 Dinner at Legal Sea Foods in the Prudential Center, followed by a visit to the 50th-
floor Prudential Center Skywalk or a drink in the lounge at Top of the Hub on the
52nd floor.
 Summer only: Assemble a picnic, and head to the Hatch Shell for music or a movie
or to Boston Common for a play or concert.
 Winter only: A Boston Symphony Orchestra or Boston Ballet performance and
then a late supper at Brasserie Jo or dessert at Finale.
 Dinner at the State Street Legal Sea Foods and then a stroll along the harbor. Hit
the food court at Faneuil Hall Marketplace for dessert.
 Dinner at Bob’s Southern Bistro and music at Wally’s Café or a Huntington Theatre
Company performance.
 Dinner at Rialto and music at the Regattabar or Scullers Jazz Club.
 Shopping at the Coop or the Harvard Book Store, and then dinner at Mr. Bartley’s
Burger Cottage.
 Dinner at the Green Street Grill, ice cream at Toscanini’s, and music at the Middle
East or T.T. the Bear’s Place.
 Dinner at the Blue Room or Oleana and then music at the Cantab Lounge.

Boston, or barely hear yourself think at a club in Cambridge, Somerville,
or Boston (see Chapter 16).
Day 5: Today, you tie up loose ends that would have left you saying, “If
only we’d had time for (fill in the blank).” Leaf through Chapters 10 and
11 to refresh your memory about places that sounded good — a historic
house? The New England Aquarium? The Freedom Trail stops you
skipped? A special-interest walking tour? One of the museums you
couldn’t fit in on Day 2? Yet another restaurant? In the evening, check
out a sporting event, one of the earlier nightlife suggestions, or your
room (you need to pack, right?).
Boston with Kids
Here’s an outline of a single kid-centric day in Boston. This itinerary is
designed for warm weather; at colder times of the year, you may want to
concentrate on indoor destinations such as museums or, if you must,
malls. This plan is flexible enough to allow lingering at some stops and
trimming (or even eliminating) others, and the schedule cries out to be
personalized.
Start with a Boston Duck Tour (see Chapter 11) from the Prudential
Center, which Bostonians call the Pru. Buy tickets in advance or when the
booth opens (no later than 9 a.m.). If you face a wait before your tour,
wander around the shopping plaza or check out the Christian Science
Center reflecting pool, across the street from the back of the Pru.
Later, use the Boylston Street exit at the front of the Pru, turn right, and
walk 3 blocks to Copley Square. The square contains a fountain, benches,
and The Tortoise and Hare at Copley Square, a two-piece sculpture
by Nancy Schön. Where’s that camera?
Continue on Boylston Street 2 more blocks, and you come to the Public
Garden. The Swan Boats make a good low-tech break. The vessels share
the lagoon with live swans, ducks, and geese; please don’t feed them.
Make Way for Ducklings, another enchanting work by Nancy Schön, is
near the corner of Beacon and Charles streets (diagonally across from
where you enter the Public Garden).
Kids with liberal TV privileges may want to head across the street for
lunch at Cheers in Beacon Hill, formerly the Bull & Finch Pub (see
Chapter 16) and the inspiration for the classic sitcom. Solid pub fare
(including fine burgers) and a children’s menu may make up for the fact
that the real thing looks nothing like the set of the show. Alternatively,
walk half a block on Boylston Street and try to score an outdoor table at
the Parish Café (see Chapter 16).
In the afternoon, pick a museum or other learning experience: the
Children’s Museum for the younger set, the Museum of Science or 
the New England Aquarium for older kids.
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
200

Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Seven Great Options 201
For dinner, let the children name the restaurant — perhaps a North End
pasta place, the Hard Rock Cafe, or the multiple options across the
street from the Hard Rock at Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Finally, if this
plan doesn’t blow anyone’s bedtime, spend the evening taking in a live
performance of Shear Madness or Blue Man Group (see Chapter 15).
Boston for Art Lovers
Would-be artists and would-be art collectors flock to Boston for inspira-
tion of all sorts in museums and galleries. From the dazzling Impressionist
paintings at the Museum of Fine Arts to works by promising artists and
craftspeople in cutting-edge galleries, the city abounds with aesthetic
treats. (Unless otherwise noted, see the map in Chapter 11 for most of
these locations.)
Check ahead for special museum shows. Short-term exhibits often
require separate tickets, usually priced separately and sometimes good
only at a specific time.
For high-profile traveling exhibitions, many large hotels arrange pack-
ages that include museum tickets. Start investigating as soon as you
hear about the show. You may not save money, but the tickets usually
are valid at any time — an invaluable perk if your schedule is uncertain.
Stop one is the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), which opens at 10 a.m. Take
a free tour at 10:30 a.m., or help yourself to a floor plan and wander. I
can cheerfully spend a day here, but you may not have that kind of time.
Go in with some sense of what you want to see; the Web site (www.mfa.
org) is a great planning tool. When you’ve had your fill, move on (2
blocks or so) to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Have lunch in
the MFA’s cafeteria, cafe, or restaurant (you may need a reservation) or
in the Gardner’s cafe. Then hop on the Green Line and head for the
Copley or Arlington stop. One block away is Newbury Street, home to
more art galleries than you can possibly see in half a day — or even a
whole day. If time allows, plan for an hour or so at one of the historic
Ordering tickets online
Many museums and other attractions sell tickets online, subject to a service charge,
through their Web sites or by linking to an agency. This can be handy, but it can also
cost you some flexibility and perhaps some money. If there’s even a small chance that
your plans will change, make sure you understand the refund policy before you enter
your credit card info — you may not be able to return or exchange prepaid tickets.
Also be sure that you understand how you’ll receive your tickets; you may be able to
pick them up at the entrance, or they may arrive by mail (allow enough time for deliv-
ery before your departure).

houses nearby (see Chapter 11) before or after you hit the galleries.
Wind down with afternoon tea (see Chapter 10) or a drink in the elegant
confines of the Four Seasons or the Taj Boston (see Chapter 16). If
you’ve kept your spending under control at the art galleries, you may
want to have a little caviar with your tea.
Boston for Sports Fans
Boston enjoys a well-deserved reputation as a great sports town and reg-
ularly ranks high on lists of physically fit cities. Whether as a spectator
or a participant, you can make yourself an honorary Bostonian with rela-
tively little effort.
Start by slapping on a Red Sox cap. Then head out to the team’s home
field, Fenway Park, which offers tours year-round — a good fallback if
you can’t land tickets to a game. Tickets were tough to get even before
the Sox won the World Series in 2004 for the first time since 1918 (maybe
you heard a little something about this victory). See Chapter 11.
Now lace up your walking or running shoes (or inline skates, if you have
them with you). In all but the nastiest weather, Bostonians flock to the
Esplanade, between Storrow Drive and the Charles River on the edge of
Beacon Hill and the Back Bay, to exercise and take in the river views.
This area is equally well known as the home of the Hatch Shell amphithe-
ater; see Chapter 15.
When snow piles up or the wind howls off the river, the Esplanade turns
positively arctic. The Frog Pond skating rink (% 617-635-2120; www.
bostoncommonfrogpond.org) on Boston Common is an excellent alter-
native. It’s an open-air rink with an ice-making system and a clubhouse.
Admission is $4 for adults and free for children younger than 14; skate
rental costs $8 for adults, $5 for kids. Weekend afternoons are the most
popular and crowded time to skate; try to go in the morning or on a
weekday.
Before or after you go jogging (or skating), head to the TD Banknorth
Garden to visit the Sports Museum of New England (see Chapter 11).
Depending on the time of year and time of day, you’ll probably be able to
fit a game into this itinerary. If you can’t buy (or afford) tickets to the
Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics, or Bruins, consider a college event. The
Boston Globe publishes daily schedules; you can also check individual
schools’ Web sites before you hit town. Men’s hockey is the marquee
event for Boston College, Boston University, Harvard, and Northeastern
University, but you might find anything from a nationally ranked lacrosse
game to a Saturday-morning crew race. (The finish line is on Memorial
Drive, across the street from the Hyatt Regency Cambridge.)
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
204

Boston for Day-Tripping Historians
Make Boston your home base while you explore American history in
roughly chronological order. Take as little as three days or as long as a
week to meet the Pilgrims, trace the steps of the revolution-minded
Minutemen, and explore the spoils of the China trade. A car makes this
itinerary more manageable than relying on public transit, but buses and
trains will take you nearly everywhere. Unless otherwise indicated, turn
to Chapter 14 for details of the destinations in this itinerary.
The Pilgrims kicked things off in Plymouth, and you will, too. “American’s
Hometown” can be a half-day jaunt, if you visit only attractions that
sound especially appealing (starting with Plymouth Rock), or an all-day
destination, if you study every artifact (starting with Plymouth Rock)
and immerse yourselves in the experience of Plimoth Plantation.
From the 17th century, move on to the 18th. A day split between Boston
and Cambridge — with special attention to the colonial and Revolu-
tionary destinations on the Freedom Trail and to the Longfellow
National Historic Site (see Chapter 11), where George Washington once
lived — fits well here, but you can also head straight to Lexington.
Visit the Village Green and at least one of the Historical Society’s well-
preserved houses. Continue to Concord, a fascinating town that
abounds with sites associated with both the Revolution and the 19th-
century intellectual glory days known as the “flowering of New England.”
Nathaniel Hawthorne spent the final years of his life in Concord, but he
made his reputation in Salem, which attained such prosperity in the
years following the Revolution that many traders in the Far East
believed it was an independent country. The North Shore and Cape Ann
make up the final leg of this itinerary. Let your interests dictate how you
organize your time. Salem’s Peabody Essex Museum offers a good
overview of the area. You may already know something about the 1792
witch trials; less familiar but equally interesting is the China trade of the
Federal era, when much of the North Shore’s magnificent residential
architecture originated. The area also encompasses the prosperous
yachting community that centers on Marblehead, as well as the com-
mercial fishing port of Gloucester. Both Gloucester and Rockport have
been popular destinations for artists since the 19th century. Both the
Rocky Neck section of Gloucester and downtown Rockport retain their
artsy associations, to the delight of 21st-century visitors like you.

Chapter 14
Going Beyond Boston: 
Four Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Remembering the Revolutionary War in Lexington and Concord
 Meeting sorceresses and sailors in Salem and Marblehead
 Enjoying seafood and scenery in Gloucester and Rockport
 Imagining the Pilgrims in Plymouth
P
art of Boston’s appeal is its proximity to other fascinating destina-
tions. Lexington, Concord, Salem, Marblehead, Gloucester, Rock-
port, and Plymouth all lie within an hour or so of downtown, and they all
make enjoyable day trips. (For the locations of the towns in relation to
Boston, see the map on the inside back cover of this book.) Each boasts
abundant historical associations and excellent sightseeing, with enough
shopping and dining opportunities to keep everyone happy.
In this chapter, I suggest ways to combine visits to some of the nearby
municipalities. I start with general pointers and then offer specific tips
on getting there and making the most of your day by planning what to
see and where to eat.
General Pointers
Rental cars and overnight stays are two items that can inflate the cost of
your day trip. If your visit to the Boston area is relatively short, I suggest
you skip the room but consider the car — packing up and moving for the
second time in just a few days is more disruptive than convenient, but
having wheels increases your flexibility and touring range. That said,
remember that reliable public transportation serves each of the towns
in this chapter; if you don’t want to deal with a car, you don’t need to.
(For information about the commuter rail and buses, contact the T at 
% 800-392-6100 or 617-222-3200; www.mbta.com.)
If you want to plan an overnight stay, the Chamber of Commerce or
other tourism authorities in each town will eagerly advise you. One good

option is a bed-and-breakfast; see Chapter 9 for names and numbers of
agencies that can book one for you.
Summer and fall weekends are the day-trip version of rush hour. In pleas-
ant weather, gridlock is a problem. If you can, try to schedule your trip
for a weekday, preferably in the spring or fall, when car and pedestrian
traffic are more manageable and the weather is relatively predictable.
Some businesses and attractions close for the winter, but if you visit
then, the open ones will often be practically empty.
Finally, if you don’t want to worry about details, consider a guided half-
or full-day bus trip. For a good selection and fair prices, contact Gray
Line’s Brush Hill Tours, 435 High St., Randolph, MA 02368 (% 800-343-
1328 or 781-986-6100; www.grayline.com).

(% 800-231-1620 or 508-747-0100; www.seeplymouth.com)

Lexington and Concord
The Revolutionary War started in these prosperous suburbs, which 
were then country villages. With an assist from a Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow poem, the events of April 1775 vaulted Lexington and
Concord into immortality. After you visit, you’ll understand why.
A visit to both towns makes a reasonable one-day excursion. Lexington
is a half-day trip; if Concord appeals to you, you can spend the whole
day there. Some attractions close for the winter and reopen after Patriots’
Day, the third Monday of April.
Hit the Boston Public Library (Chapter 11) or the Old North Church gift
shop (Chapter 11), and track down Longfellow’s poem “Paul Revere’s
Ride,” a classic but historically dubious account of Revere’s journey on
April 18 and 19, 1775. You’ll hear about the poem all over Lexington and
Concord, and you may already know a little. (The first lines are “Listen,
my children, and you shall hear / Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.”)
Getting to Lexington
To drive from Boston (9 miles) or Cambridge (6 miles), take Soldiers
Field Road or Memorial Drive west and pick up Route 2 west. Exit at
Route 4/225, and follow signs into the center of town. From Route 128 
(I-95), use Exit 31A and proceed into town. Parking is available on Mass.
Ave., and a public metered lot is near the corner of Mass. Ave. and Wal-
tham Street. The National Heritage Museum and Minute Man National
Historical Park have free parking lots.
Public transportation is more complicated. Start by riding the Red Line
to the last stop, Alewife. From there, bus route numbers 62 (Bedford)
and 76 (Hanscom) serve Lexington. The buses run Monday through
Saturday, hourly during the day, and every 30 minutes during rush
hours. They don’t operate on Sunday. The one-way bus trip takes about
25 minutes and costs $1.25 with a CharlieCard (the transfer is free if you
paid your subway fare with the CharlieCard), $1.50 with a CharlieTicket
or cash.
Taking a tour of Lexington and Concord
The Liberty Ride (% 781-862-1450; www.libertyride.us) is a narrated
tour that connects the attractions in Lexington and Concord, including
Minute Man National Historical Park. At press time, the service ran from
late May through mid-October. The fare is $20 for adults, $10 for students
5 to 17, and free for children younger than 5. That’s steep if you have a
car, but worth the money if you’re using public transportation — and
your ticket gets you discounts at businesses around both towns.

Chapter 14: Going Beyond Boston: Four Day Trips 209

Seeing the sights in Lexington
Pick up maps and other information at the Chamber of Commerce
Visitor Center, 1875 Massachusetts Ave. (% 781-862-2480). The center
is open April through November daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and December
through March daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Displays include a diorama
that illustrates the battle.
The Visitor Center is on the Village Green or Battle Green, site of the
Revolution’s first skirmish. The monuments and memorials include the
Minuteman Statue (1900) of the militia commander, Captain John Parker,
who instructed his troops, “Don’t fire unless fired upon, but if they mean
to have a war, let it begin here!” It takes about an hour to check out the
center displays and outdoor sights on the Battle Green.
The Lexington Historical Society (% 781-862-1703; www.lexington
history.org) operates the town’s most compelling attraction, the
Buckman Tavern, 1 Bedford St. The tavern, built around 1710, was the
minutemen’s gathering place on April 19, 1775. Costumed guides lead an
outstanding tour that describes the building’s history, the battle, and
details of colonial life. Even if time is short, don’t miss this one.
Tours of the society’s other two properties are well worth your time but
are short of can’t-miss experiences. The 1698 Hancock-Clarke House,
36 Hancock St., a third of a mile from the Green, houses artifacts of the
Revolution and some original furnishings. The 1690 Munroe Tavern,
1332 Massachusetts Ave., is about a mile from the Green in the other
direction. During the battle, the tavern fell into British hands and
became the headquarters and, later, field hospital. Items on display
include memorabilia of George Washington, who visited in 1789.
To see the houses, you must take a guided tour, which lasts 30 to 45 min-
utes per house. The Buckman Tavern is open daily from April through
October; tours start every 30 minutes from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Hancock-
Clarke House and the Munroe Tavern are open weekends from the third
weekend in April (Patriots’ Day) through June and daily from July through
October. Tours of the Hancock-Clarke House start every 30 minutes from
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Munroe Tavern tours start every 30 minutes from 1:30
to 3 p.m. Admission for adults is $5 per house, $8 for two, and $10 for all
three; for children 6 to 16, $3 per house, $5 for two houses, and $7 for
three. Group tours are run by appointment only.
The other major attraction in Lexington is the National Heritage Museum,
33 Marrett Rd. (Route 2A), at Mass. Ave. (% 781-861-6559; www.national
heritagemuseum.org), which takes a fun approach, illustrating history
with cultural artifacts. It’s anything but a stuffy old museum — the cura-
tors wisely remember that pop culture is culture, too. In recent years,
subjects of the temporary exhibits have included The Beatles, Elvis
Presley, circus posters, mail-order catalogs, jigsaw puzzles, American
pets, and Frank Lloyd Wright, to name a few. For another look at the
Revolution, visit the permanent installation on the Battle of Lexington.

For a tasty lunch, visit the Courtyard Café. The Scottish Rite of Free-
masonry sponsors the museum. Admission is free; the museum is open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon
to 5 p.m.
Dining in Lexington
The center of town, near the intersection of Mass. Ave. and Waltham
Street, offers a number of choices. For a muffin or scone to start the day,
Lexington has a branch of Great Harvest Bread Co., 1736 Massachu-
setts Ave. (% 781-861-9990). For lunch, you may want to hold out until
Concord. If you can’t, the Courtyard Café at the National Heritage
Museum (% 781-861-6558, ext. 4143) is a popular spot for soups, salads,
and sandwiches. Or try Bertucci’s, 1777 Massachusetts Ave. (% 781-
860-9000), for pizza and pasta.

Seeing the sights en route from Lexington to Concord
Minute Man National Historical Park (www.nps.gov/mima) spreads
over 900 acres in Lexington, Concord, and Lincoln. The park encom-
passes the scene of the first Revolutionary War battle and a 4-mile piece
of the road that the vanquished British troops used to retreat from
Concord to Boston. Artwork and artifacts illustrate the displays at
Visitor Centers in Lexington and Concord, either of which makes an
excellent starting point. Visiting the park takes as little as half an hour
(to see Concord’s North Bridge) or as long as several hours, if you
include stops at both Visitor Centers and maybe a ranger-led program.
The park is open daily year-round. Admission is free; charges for special
tours may apply. Concord’s North Bridge Visitor Center, 174 Liberty St.,
off Monument Street (% 978-369-6993), overlooks the Concord River
and the bridge. The center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (11 a.m.–
3 p.m. in winter). In Lexington, the Minute Man Visitor Center is off
Route 2A, a half-mile west of I-95 (Massachusetts Route 128), Exit 33B
(% 781-862-7753). The center is open from April through October daily
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; call ahead early and late in the season.
Walden Pond State Reservation, Route 126, Concord (% 978-369-3254;
www.mass.gov/dcr), preserves the site of the cabin where Henry David
Thoreau lived from 1845 to 1847. Besides being a literary pilgrimage site,
this spot is popular with visitors who hike around the pond, picnic,
swim, and fish. In fine weather, call before heading over to make sure
that the parking lot has space available (there’s no additional parking).
Parking costs $5 year-round.
To get to Walden Pond from Lexington, take Mass. Ave. west to Route 2A,
bear left onto Route 2, and turn left onto Route 126. From Concord, take
Walden Street (Route 126) south, away from Concord Center; cross
Route 2; and look for signs pointing to the parking lot.
Getting to Concord
To drive from Lexington, take Mass. Ave. west, across Route 128, and
pick up Route 2A. Pass through Lincoln and bear right onto Lexington
Road in Concord. Follow HISTORIC CONCORD signs into the center of town. If
you miss the turnoff, continue about a half-mile, and take the next right
onto Cambridge Turnpike, which runs into the center of town. To go
straight to Walden Pond, take what’s now Route 2/2A another mile or so,
and then turn left onto Route 126. From Boston (18 miles) and Cambridge
(15 miles), take Soldiers Field Road or Memorial Drive west to Route 2. In
Lincoln, stay in the right lane. Where the road makes a sharp left, go
straight onto Cambridge Turnpike. Parking is available throughout town
and at the attractions.
By public transportation, the commuter rail takes about 45 minutes from
North Station in Boston, with a stop at Porter Square in Cambridge. The
one-way fare is $6.25. (The only transportation between Lexington and
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
212

Concord is the seasonal Liberty Ride tour.) The station is about three-
quarters of a mile from the town center. The attractions are accessible
on foot but not all that close together; in hot or cold weather, make
appropriate preparations (hats, water, sunscreen, and such).
If you want to fit in, pronounce it conquered (not con-cored).
Taking a tour of Concord
The Chamber of Commerce (% 978-369-3120; www.concordchamber
ofcommerce.org) offers 90-minute guided walking tours from mid-
March through October on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Tours
start at the Visitor Center on Main Street and cost $18 for adults, $12 for
seniors and students 13 to 18, $10 for children 6 to 12, free for children
younger than 6. Also check to see whether Park Service rangers from the
North Bridge Visitor Center (% 978-369-6993; www.nps.gov/mima) are
leading tours during your visit.
For information about a tour of Concord and Lexington, see the listing
for the Liberty Ride, earlier in this section.
Seeing the sights in Concord
The monuments and descriptions around and in the North Bridge Visitor
Center and the bridge itself (a reproduction) give a good sense of Con-
cord’s best-known event: the Battle of Concord. The town is equally
famous for literary associations, and indications of that abound, too.
Visit Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, off Route 62 west (% 978-318-3233;
www.concordnet.org), and climb to Author’s Ridge. In this area, you
find the graves of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry
David Thoreau, and Louisa May Alcott and her father, Bronson Alcott,
among others. The cemetery is open daily from 7 a.m. to dusk and 
doesn’t allow buses; call ahead for wheelchair access.
Concord Museum
The Concord Museum offers a fascinating, comprehensive look at the
town’s storied history. The best features of the galleries aren’t the abun-
dant objects and artifacts, although they’re impressive; even more inter-
esting are the accompanying descriptions and interpretations that place
the exhibits in context. For example, you can see one of the lanterns that
signaled Paul Revere from the steeple of the Old North Church. This dis-
play includes just enough explanatory text to show why that’s a big deal.
To help orient the kids, pick up a family activity pack near the entrance.
Lexington Road and Cambridge Turnpike. % 978-369-9609 (recorded info) or 978-369-
9763. www.concordmuseum.org. Follow Lexington Road out of Concord Center
and bear right at museum onto Cambridge Turnpike; entrance is on the left. Parking:
In lot or on road. Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors and students, $5 children younger
than 16. Open: June–Aug daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Apr–May and Sept–Dec Mon–Sat 
9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m.; Jan–Mar Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–4 p.m., Sun 1–4 p.m.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Boston: Four Day Trips 213

The Old Manse
The Reverend William Emerson, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s grandfather, built
this house in 1770 and watched the Battle of Concord from the yard. For
almost 170 years, the house was home to his widow, her second husband,
their descendants, and (briefly) newlyweds Nathaniel and Sophia Peabody
Hawthorne. The tour traces the history of the house and its occupants,
using a rich trove of family memorabilia.
269 Monument St. (at North Bridge). % 978-369-3909. www.oldmanse.org. From
Concord Center, follow Monument Street until you see North Bridge parking lot on the
right; The Old Manse is on the left. Guided tours: $8 adults, $7 seniors and students,
$5 children 6–12, $25 families. Open: Mid-Apr to Oct Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Sun
and holidays noon to 5 p.m. Last tour at 4:30 p.m. Closed Nov to mid-Apr.
Orchard House
If you are or were a preadolescent girl, this stop may be one of the best
parts of your trip. Louisa May Alcott lived and wrote at Orchard House,
the setting for her best-known book, Little Women (1868). If you loved the
book, don’t leave town without seeing the house; if you don’t understand
what the fuss is about, this attraction may not be the best use of your time.
The tour offers an intriguing look at 19th-century family life, overflowing
with anecdotes and heirlooms. Note: Call before visiting; an ongoing
restoration project may affect open hours and days.
399 Lexington Rd. % 978-369-4118. www.louisamayalcott.org. Follow Lexing-
ton Road out of Concord Center past Concord Museum; the house is on the left.
Parking: In lot; overflow parking lot is across the street. Guided tours: $8 adults, $7
seniors and students, $5 children 6–17, $20 families (up to 2 adults and 4 children).
Open: Apr–Oct Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sun 1–4:30 p.m.; Nov–Mar Mon–Fri 11 a.m.–
3 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sun 1–4:30 p.m. Closed Jan 1–15.
Ralph Waldo Emerson House
Emerson is a household name in Concord, where he remains such a tow-
ering presence that guides here still call him “Mr. Emerson.” The philoso-
pher, essayist, and poet lived in this house from 1835 until he died, in 1882.
The tour highlights Emerson’s domestic life and the house’s over-the-top
Victorian décor.
28 Cambridge Turnpike. % 978-369-2236. Take Cambridge Turnpike out of Concord
Center; just before Concord Museum, house is on the right. Guided tours: $7 adults,
$5 seniors and students; call to arrange group tours. Open: Mid-Apr to Oct Thurs–Sat
10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Sun 1–4:30 p.m. Closed Nov to mid-Apr.
The Wayside
Nathaniel Hawthorne lived at The Wayside from 1852 until his death, in
1864. The Alcott family lived here, too, as did Harriett Lothrop, who wrote
the Five Little Peppers books under the pen name Margaret Sidney. This
house is part of Minute Man National Historical Park; rangers lead the

455 Lexington Rd. % 978-369-6975. www.nps.gov. Follow Lexington Road past
Concord Museum and Orchard House; the Wayside is on the left. Guided tours: $4
adults; free for children younger than 17. Open: May–Oct; hours and days vary (call
ahead). Closed Nov–Apr.
Dining in Concord
Concord’s Colonial Inn, 48 Monument Sq. (% 978-369-2372; www.
concordscolonialinn.com), is a traditional establishment (the main
building dates to 1716) with a fine restaurant and two friendly lounges.
The food is certainly tasty, but you’re really here to soak up the atmos-
phere. The inn serves afternoon tea from Wednesday through Sunday.
(Make a reservation by calling % 978-369-2373.)

In an off-the-tourist-track location, Nashoba Brook Bakery & Cafe, 152
Commonwealth Ave., West Concord (% 978-318-1999; www.slowrise.
com), is a delightful soup–salad–sandwich place that also serves fantas-
tic breads and desserts made in-house. From Concord Center, take Main
Street west, cross Route 2, and proceed to the traffic light in front of the
West Concord train station, bear right, and go 3 blocks. Park on the
street or in one of the handful of spots in the lot, or continue on Comm.
Ave. as it bears right and cross the bridge to reach the overflow parking
lot on Winthrop Street. The cafe is open Monday through Friday from
6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., weekends from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
For picnic fixings, visit the Cheese Shop, 25–31 Walden St. (% 978-369-
5778), near the town center.
Salem and Marblehead
The North Shore played a prominent role in the Revolution and attained
great prosperity by dominating the China trade in the early Federal era,
but we both know that’s not why you flipped to this page. When you
read “Salem,” you thought, “Witches!”
The witch trials of 1692 left an indelible mark on Salem, which good-
naturedly welcomes the association — while never forgetting that 20
people died in the unfounded hysteria. When you discover this pleasant
city, you may want to hang around and find out about its rich maritime
history, too. Salem shares that legacy with the affluent, picturesque
town of Marblehead, which (Newport be hanged) is the self-proclaimed
“Yachting Capital of America.”
Much like Lexington and Concord, Salem and Marblehead together make
a full day trip. You can also easily spend an entire day in either place.
Getting to Salem
To drive from Boston (17 miles), take the Callahan or Ted Williams
Tunnel to Route 1A north past the airport and into downtown Salem. Be
careful in Lynn, where the road turns left and immediately right. Or take
I-93 or Route 1 to Route 128 and then Route 114 into Salem. From Marble-
head, follow Route 114 (Pleasant Street) west. Park on the street or in the
municipal garage across from the National Park Service Visitor Center.
Bus route number 450 runs from Haymarket (Green or Orange Line), and
commuter trains operate from North Station (Green or Orange Line).
The bus takes an hour; the train, 30 to 35 minutes. The one-way bus fare
is $2.80 with a CharlieCard, $3.50 with a CharlieTicket or cash. The train
costs $5.25 each way.
The seasonal Salem Ferry (% 978-741-0220; www.salemferry.com)
operates daily from Memorial Day weekend through October. The 45-
minute catamaran trip connects Central Wharf, next to the New England
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
216

Aquarium (T: Aquarium [Blue Line]) to the Blaney Street Wharf, off
Derby Street, a 15-minute walk or quick hop on the Salem Trolley (see
later) from downtown Salem. The peak adult fare (before 4 p.m. from late
June to early Sept) is $12 one-way, $22 round-trip, with discounts for sen-
iors, children, families, and evening passengers. The one-way off-season
fare is $8 for all.
Taking a tour of Salem
The Salem Trolley (% 978-744-5469; www.salemtrolley.com) oper-
ates daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. from April through October; check
ahead for November hours. Tickets ($12 adults, $10 seniors, $3 children
5–14) are good all day, and you can get off and on as much as you like at
any of the 15 stops. The driver narrates a one-hour tour while making a
loop around town; the first stop is at the Essex Street side of the National
Park Service Visitor Center on New Liberty Street.
Seeing the sights in Salem
The National Park Service Visitor Center, 2 New Liberty St. (% 978-
740-1650; www.nps.gov/sama), distributes brochures and pamphlets,
including one that describes a walking tour of the historic district. The
center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Architecture buffs will want to
see Chestnut Street, a gorgeously preserved example of colonial style;
the whole street is a registered National Historic Landmark.
The House of the Seven Gables
Nathaniel Hawthorne visited this house as a child, and legends about the
building and its inhabitants inspired his 1851 novel of the same name. If
you haven’t read the book (or even if you have), watch the audiovisual
program that tells the story before you start the tour. The six rooms of
period furniture in the main house include pieces mentioned in the book
and a steep secret staircase. Costumed tour guides can answer just about
any question about the novel, buildings, and artifacts.
54 Turner St. % 978-744-0991. www.7gables.org. From downtown, follow Derby
Street east 3 blocks past Derby Wharf. Guided tours: $12 adults, $11 seniors, $7.25
children 5–12, free for children younger than 5. Open: July–Oct daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m.;
Nov–June daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed 1st 3 weeks of Jan.
Peabody Essex Museum
This fascinating institution has dramatically elevated its profile in recent
years, transforming itself into one of New England’s foremost museums.
The signature exhibit in its nationally and internationally acclaimed assem-
blage of art and architecture is an entire 18th-century Chinese house. Yin
Yu Tang, which dates to the Qing dynasty, is the only example of Chinese
domestic architecture outside that country. It was disassembled, shipped
from southeastern China, and reassembled here to be the centerpiece of
a dramatic new wing, designed by Moshe Safdie and opened in 2003.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Boston: Four Day Trips 217

The museum’s sprawling collections of objects and artifacts preserve the
legacy of this historic New England seaport from its earliest days to the
present, encompassing everything from toys to animal specimens to East
Asian and Native American art. Visitors can tour a historic house or gallery
or take a self-guided tour using a pamphlet from about a dozen available
on various topics. The museum cafe is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
East India Square. % 866-745-1876 or 978-745-9500. www.pem.org. Take Hawthorne
Boulevard to Essex Street, following signs for Visitor Center, and enter on Essex or
New Liberty Street. Admission: To museum $13 adults, $11 seniors, $9 students with
ID, free for children younger than 17; to Yin Yu Tang (available only with museum
admission) $4. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Salem Maritime National Historic Site
The waterfront linked Salem to the world for many years before the city’s
chipping businesses began to decline in the early 1800s. On this harbor-
front land, National Park Service buildings and displays recall the port’s
heyday. In the water alongside the orientation center is an irresistible
exhibit: a full-size replica of a 1797 East Indiaman merchant vessel. The
excellent ranger-led tour includes the three-masted 171-footer Friendship.
174 Derby St. % 978-740-1660. www.nps.gov/sama. Take Derby Street east, just
past Pickering Wharf; the orientation center is on the right. Admission: Free; guided
tours: $5 adults, $3 seniors and children 6–16. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Salem Witch Museum
The Salem Witch Museum is so memorable that I’m fighting the urge to
call the place “haunting” (oh, well). The informative and frightening
museum’s three-dimensional audiovisual presentation uses life-size figures
to illustrate the witchcraft trials and the accompanying hysteria. That
sounds a little corny, but the 30-minute narration does a good job of
explaining the historical context and consequences. (One “man” dies when
others pile rocks onto a board on his chest — you may need to remind
small children that he’s not real.)
The “witch” on the traffic island across from the Witch Museum is Roger
Conant, who founded Salem in 1626. Nice outfit, Roger.
191⁄2 Washington Square. % 978-744-1692. www.salemwitchmuseum.com. Follow
Hawthorne Boulevard to the northwest corner of Salem Common. Admission: $7.50
adults, $6.50 seniors, $5 children 6–14. Open: July–Aug daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m.; Sept–
June daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; check ahead for extended Oct hours.
Dining in Salem
The Lyceum Bar & Grill, 43 Church St. (at Washington Street; % 978-
745-7665; www.lyceumsalem.com), is one of the best restaurants north
of Boston. The bar and grill serves creative American fare at lunch on
weekdays, dinner daily, and Sunday brunch. For any meal, make a reser-
vation. For a quick bite, try Red’s Sandwich Shop, 15 Central St. (% 978-
745-3527), a local favorite that serves breakfast and lunch daily. The

fare’s cheap, good, and served fast; cash only. Victoria Station, Pickering
Wharf, at the corner of Derby and Congress streets (% 978-745-3400;
www.victoriastationinc.com), serves American cuisine with a terrific
view of the marina.
Getting to Marblehead
To drive from Boston (15 miles), take the Callahan or Ted Williams
Tunnel and follow Route 1A past the airport north through Revere and
Lynn. Bear right where you see signs for Swampscott and Marblehead.
Follow Lynn Shore Drive into Swampscott, bear left onto Route 129, and
follow it to Marblehead. Or take I-93 or Route 1 to Route 128, and then
Route 114 through Salem into Marblehead. From Salem, take Route 114
east. Parking is limited — grab the first spot you see, and be sure you
know your time limit.
Bus route number 441/442 runs from Haymarket (Green or Orange Line)
in Boston to downtown Marblehead. During rush periods on weekdays,
the number 448/449 connects Marblehead to Downtown Crossing (Red
or Orange Line). The 441 and 448 buses detour to Vinnin Square shop-
ping center in Swampscott; otherwise, the routes are the same. The one-
way trip takes about an hour and costs $2.80 with a CharlieCard, $3.50
with a CharlieTicket or cash.
Seeing the sights in Marblehead
The Marblehead Chamber of Commerce operates an information booth
on Pleasant Street near Spring Street. The booth is open from mid-May
through October, weekdays from noon to 5 p.m. and weekends from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. (When it’s closed, visit the office at 62 Pleasant St., just up
the hill.) You can pick up pamphlets and a map in person or download a
walking tour from the chamber’s Web site (www.visitmarblehead.com);
the town is ideal for wandering, especially around “Old Town,” the his-
toric district. Be sure to visit Crocker Park or Fort Sewall, on the harbor
at opposite ends of Front Street; the view from either place is amazing.
Marblehead is a top-notch shopping destination. Shops, boutiques, and
galleries dot Washington and Front streets, with another prime area on
Atlantic Avenue.
Abbot Hall
The Selectmen’s Meeting Room houses Archibald M. Willard’s painting The
Spirit of ’76. That title may not ring a bell, but the painting will when you
see the widely imitated drummer, drummer boy, and fife player. Cases in
the halls contain objects and artifacts from the collections of the
Marblehead Museum & Historical Society; a stop here takes five or ten min-
utes at most.
Washington Square. % 781-631-0528. www.marblehead.org. From the historic
district, follow Washington Street up the hill toward the clock tower. Admission: Free.
Open: Nov–Apr Mon, Tues, Thurs 8 a.m.–5 p.m., Wed 7:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Fri 8 a.m.–1 p.m.;

Sat 9 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m.
Jeremiah Lee Mansion
The 1768 Lee Mansion is one of the most appealing features of this appeal-
ing town. The original hand-painted wallpaper is the headliner, and the
house is an excellent example of pre-Revolutionary Georgian architecture.
The Marblehead Museum & Historical Society’s informative guides bring
history to life with stories about the home and its renovations. The Visitor
Center across the street at 170 Washington St. (free admission) contains
two galleries and is open June to October Tuesday through Saturday 10
a.m. to 4 p.m.; November to May Tuesday to Friday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
161 Washington St. % 781-631-1069. www.marbleheadarts.org. Follow Wash-
ington Street uphill toward Abbot Hall; the mansion is on the right. Guided tours: $5
adults, $4.50 seniors and students. Open: June–Oct Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed
Nov–May.

King Hooper Mansion/Marblehead Arts Association
Robert Hooper was a shipping magnate who earned his nickname by treat-
ing his sailors well. His 1728 mansion, which gained a Georgian addition in
1747, now contains period furnishings. Although the pieces aren’t original
to the house, the furnishings give a sense of upper-crust life in the 18th cen-
tury. The building houses the Marblehead Arts Association, which stages
monthly exhibits and operates the gift shop, which sells members’ work.
8 Hooper St. % 781-631-2608. www.marbleheadarts.org. Look for the colorful
sign off Washington Street at the foot of the hill near the Lee Mansion. Guided tours:
Free; donation requested. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.; Sun 1–5 p.m. Call ahead;
no tours during private parties.
Dining in Marblehead
The Driftwood Restaurant, 63 Front St. (% 781-631-1145), a diner-style
neighborhood hangout, serves excellent fresh seafood at lunch, and
breakfast all day (until 5 p.m. in the summer, 2 p.m. in the winter). The
casual Maddie’s Sail Loft, 15 State St. (% 781-631-9824), enjoys a well-
deserved reputation for fresh seafood and strong drinks. It serves lunch
daily, dinner Monday through Saturday.
Gloucester and Rockport
Gloucester, Rockport, Essex, and Manchester-by-the-Sea make up Cape
Ann, a dizzyingly beautiful peninsula that generally plays second fiddle
to another cape — Cape Cod. That’s a shame, because Cape Ann is a
uniquely appealing destination. Gloucester is a city in transition, a sight-
seeing and whale-watching center that’s also one of the few commercial
fishing ports remaining in New England. The fading industry traces its
roots even farther back than the city’s first European settlement in 1623.
Rockport, at the tip of the cape, is nearly as old but has a less hard-
scrabble history. Rockport enjoys a reputation as a summer community
overflowing with gift shops and galleries.
The contrast of Gloucester and Rockport makes for an enjoyable one-
day trip; exploring either can also fill a day.
Getting to Gloucester
To drive from Boston (33 miles), take I-93 or Route 1 to Route 128, which
ends in Gloucester. Exit 14 puts you on Route 133, a longer but prettier
approach to downtown than exits 11 and 9. You shouldn’t have trouble
finding on-street parking; if you do, head to the free lot on the causeway
to Rocky Neck.
The commuter rail runs from North Station in Boston to Gloucester. The
trip takes about an hour and costs $7.25 one-way. The Cape Ann Tran-
sportation Authority, or CATA (% 978-283-7916; www.canntran.com),
runs buses on Cape Ann (from the Gloucester station to the waterfront,

for example) and operates special routes during the summer; call for
schedules.
Remember that Gloucester rhymes with roster; it’s pronounced glos-ter.
Taking a tour of Gloucester
Pick up a Gloucester Maritime Trail brochure, which describes four excel-
lent self-guided tours. You can find this brochure at the Visitors Wel-
coming Center (% 800-649-6839 or 978-281-8865), open summer only at
Stage Fort Park, off Route 127 near the intersection with Route 133; or
the Cape Ann Chamber of Commerce, 33 Commercial St. (% 800-321-
0133 or 978-283-1601), open daily in summer and weekdays in winter.
The most popular tours around Gloucester are whale-watches; see the
box “Where to watch whales” for details.
Seeing the sights in Gloucester
On Stacy Boulevard just west of downtown, the statue that symbolizes
the city testifies to the danger of the seafaring life. More than 10,000 fish-
ermen lost their lives in Gloucester’s first three centuries; Leonard
Craske’s bronze Gloucester fisherman, The Man at the Wheel, memorial-
izes them.
To reach East Gloucester, follow signs from downtown or use Exit 9 from
Route 128. On East Main Street, follow signs to the Rocky Neck Art
Colony, the oldest continuously operating art colony in the country.
Park in the lot on the tiny causeway and follow the crowds to Rocky
Neck Avenue and its studios, galleries, and restaurants. Most galleries
are open daily in the summer from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Just east of downtown is the Crow’s Nest, 334 Main St. (% 978-281-
2965), the fishermen’s bar that gained fame through the book and movie
The Perfect Storm. The bar is a local hangout.
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
224
Where to watch whales
Whale-watching is even more popular in Gloucester than in Boston (turn to Chapter
11 for a full description of whale-watching). Prices run $35 to $40 for adults, less for
seniors and children; most tour companies will match any competitor’s offer, includ-
ing guaranteed sightings, AAA discounts, or coupons. Making a reservation is always
a good idea. Downtown, you’ll find Cape Ann Whale Watch (% 800-877-5110 or
978-283-5110; www.caww.com), Capt. Bill’s Whale Watch (% 800-33-WHALE or 978-
283-6995; www.captbillandsons.com), and Seven Seas Whale Watch (% 888-
238-1776 or 978-283-1776; www.7seas-whalewatch.com). At the Cape Ann
Marina, off Route 133, is Yankee Whale Watch (% 800-WHALING or 978-283-0313;
www.yankeefleet.com).

Beauport (Sleeper-McCann House)
Henry Davis Sleeper decorated this “fantasy house” to illustrate literary
and historical themes, which you can learn about during the fascinating
house tour. Sleeper, an interior designer, drew on huge collections of
American and European art and antiques to create the home from 1907 to
1934. The entertaining tour visits most of the house’s 40 rooms. Note that
the house, operated by Historic New England, is not open on summer
weekends.
75 Eastern Point Blvd. % 978-283-0800. www.historicnewengland.org. Follow
East Main Street south to Eastern Point Boulevard (a private road), drive a half-mile
to house, and park on the left. Guided tours: $10 adults, $9 seniors, $5 students and
children 6–12. Open: Tours on the hour June–Sept 14 Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–4 p.m.; Sept
15–Oct 15 daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed summer weekends and Oct 16–May.
Cape Ann Historical Museum
Cape Ann’s history and artists dominate the displays at this lovely museum.
The American Luminist painter Fitz Hugh Lane (also known as Fitz Henry
Lane), a Gloucester native, has a gorgeous gallery. Other spaces hold con-
temporary works, and the maritime and fisheries galleries contain fasci-
nating exhibits, models, photographs, and even entire boats (you won’t
believe how small some of them are).
27 Pleasant St. % 978-283-0455. Follow Main Street west through downtown and
turn right onto Pleasant Street; the museum is 1 block up on the right. Parking:
Metered street parking or in pay lot across street. Admission: $6.50 adults, $6 sen-
iors, $4.50 students, free for children younger than 6. Open: Mar–Jan Tues–Sat 
10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Feb.
Dining in Gloucester and nearby Essex
The Gull Restaurant, 75 Essex Ave. (Route 133), at the Cape Ann Marina
(% 978-281-6060; www.thegullrestaurant.com), serves sandwiches
at lunch and large portions of ocean-fresh seafood in a picturesque loca-
tion overlooking the Annisquam River. The Gull is closed from November
to early April; a good year-round alternative is Halibut Point Restaurant,
289 Main St. (% 978-281-1900; www.halibutpoint.com), a downtown
tavern that serves terrific burgers in addition to tasty seafood. Another
option: Follow the locals to the Stage Fort Park snack bar, the Cupboard,
41 Hough Ave. (% 978-281-1908), for fried seafood and blue-plate specials.
Going to or leaving Cape Ann on Route 128, turn away from Gloucester
on Route 133 and head west to Essex. This beautiful little town is both a
center of great antiques shopping and an important culinary landmark:
the birthplace of the fried clam. According to legend, that’s Woodman’s
of Essex, 121 Main St. (% 800-649-1773 or 978-768-6451; www.woodmans.
com). Woodman’s draws locals and out-of-towners for lobster, steamers,
onion rings, and — oh, yeah — fried clams. This dining spot is mobbed
year-round, with locals as well as out-of-towners, but the line moves
quickly. They don’t take credit cards but there’s an ATM on the premises.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Boston: Four Day Trips 225

Getting to Rockport
By car from Boston (40 miles), take I-93 or Route 1 to Route 128. Just
before Route 128 ends, follow signs to Route 127, and go north into
Rockport. Or continue to the end (Exit 9), turn left onto Bass Avenue,
and go about a half-mile to Route 127A north, which runs into the center
of town. From Gloucester, follow Main Street to Eastern Avenue (Route 127)
or Bass Avenue. Route 127A is more scenic but longer than Route 127. In
downtown Rockport, circle once to look for parking and then try the
back streets. Or use the parking lot on Upper Main Street (Route 127) 
on weekends. Parking is free; the shuttle bus to downtown costs $1.
The commuter rail runs from North Station in Boston to Rockport. The
60- to 70-minute trip costs $7.75 one-way. The station is off Upper Main
Street, less than a mile from the center of town.
The Cape Ann Transportation Authority, or CATA (% 978-283-7916;
www.canntran.com), runs buses from town to town on Cape Ann.
Seeing the sights in Rockport
Pick up the pamphlet Rockport: A Walking Guide from the Rockport
Chamber of Commerce, 3 Whistlestop Mall (% 888-726-3922 or 978-
546-6575; www.rockportusa.com). The office is open daily in summer
and weekdays in winter; the chamber operates an information booth
from mid-May to mid-October about a mile from downtown on Upper
Main Street (Route 127), just before the WELCOME TO ROCKPORT sign.
Rockport boasts no must-see attractions, but there’s more to the town
than knickknack shopping. The knickknack shopping is excellent,
though. Wander around downtown, making sure to detour onto Bearskin
Neck, which has more gift shops than some whole cities. (And an inter-
esting name — read the plaque at the entrance to the street to learn the
story.) Walk all the way to the end of the neck for a spectacular water
view. All over downtown, shops sell jewelry, gifts, toys, clothing, novel-
ties, handmade crafts, paintings, and sculpture.
Opposite Bearskin Neck on the town wharf, you’ll see a red wooden 
fish warehouse called Motif No. 1. The warehouse exerts a mysterious
totemic power over Rockport residents and visitors — or is a testament
to the fact that anything can become a tourist attraction. Motif No. 1 is
famous for being famous. No, I don’t know what the big deal is.
More than two dozen art galleries display the works of local and nation-
ally known artists. In addition, the Rockport Art Association, 12 Main St.
(% 978-546-6604; www.rockportartassn.org), sponsors major exhi-
bitions and special shows throughout the year. The association is open
in the summer Monday through Saturday midmorning to late afternoon,
Sunday noon to late afternoon; in the winter, it closes for most of
January and on Mondays but otherwise keeps the same hours.
Part IV: Exploring Boston 
226

To get a sense of the power of the sea, take Route 127 north of town to
the tip of Cape Ann. Halibut Point State Park (% 978-546-2997; www.
mass.gov/dcr) has a staffed Visitor Center, walking trails, tidal pools,
and water-filled quarries — but no swimming. This park is great place to
wander around and admire the scenery. On a clear day, you can see
Maine. Admission is free, and parking costs $2 from Memorial Day to
Columbus Day.
Dining in Rockport
Woodman’s of Essex (see “Dining in Gloucester and nearby Essex,” ear-
lier in this chapter) is well worth a detour; if you stay in Rockport, I sug-
gest a picnic. Head to Halibut Point (see “Seeing the sights in Rockport,”
earlier in this chapter), the end of Bearskin Neck, or another agreeable
spot. Stop for provisions at the Greenery, 15 Dock Sq. (% 978-546-9593;
www.greenery-restaurant.com), or the Portside Chowder House, 7
Tuna Wharf, off Bearskin Neck (% 978-546-7045), and then sit back and
admire the scenery.
Plymouth
The Pilgrims reside in our collective memory, wearing tall black hats and
buckled shoes. A visit to this town may cause elementary-school flash-
backs, but the trip may also leave you with a new sense of the difficul-
ties those early settlers overcame. Best of all, you get a real sense — the
attractions that are replicas are faithful reproductions, but many are
genuine 17th-century relics.
Plymouth is a reasonable day trip that’s especially popular with chil-
dren. The town makes a good stop between Boston and Cape Cod.
Getting there
By car from Boston (40 miles), follow I-93 south about 9 miles and bear
left onto Route 3. Take Route 3 to Exit 6A (Route 44 east) and then follow
signs to the historical attractions. Or continue on Route 3 to the Regional
Information Complex at Exit 5 for maps, brochures, and information. To go
directly to Plimoth Plantation, use Exit 4. The trip from Boston takes 45 to
60 minutes if you avoid rush hour. The downtown area is compact, so
park where you can. The waterfront meters are particularly convenient.
The commuter rail serves Plymouth (at peak commuting times, service
is to nearby Kingston) from Boston’s South Station during the day on
weekdays and all day on weekends; the trip takes one hour, and the one-
way fare is $7.75. Plymouth & Brockton buses (% 617-773-9401 or 508-
746-0378; www.p-b.com) leave from South Station and take about the
same time; they drop off and pick up passengers at the park-and-ride lot
at Exit 5 of Route 3. The bus is more expensive than the commuter rail
($12 one-way, $22 round-trip) but runs more often. The Plymouth Area
Link bus (% 506-222-6106; www.gatra.org/pal.htm) connects the
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Boston: Four Day Trips 227

train stations and bus stop with downtown and other destinations. The
fare is $1.
Taking a tour
A narrated tour with Plymouth Rock Trolley (% 800-698-5636 or 508-
747-3419; www.plymouthrocktrolley.com) includes unlimited on-and-
off privileges. The trolley operates daily from Memorial Day to October
and on weekends through Thanksgiving. Trolleys serve marked stops
downtown every 20 minutes and stop at the plantation every hour in the
summer. Tickets cost $15 for adults, $12 for children 3 to 12.
To get a Pilgrim’s perspective, take a 90-minute Colonial Lantern 
Tour (% 800-698-5636 or 508-747-4161; www.lanterntours.com).
Participants carry pierced-tin lanterns as they walk around the original
settlement under the direction of a knowledgeable guide. Tours run
nightly from April through Thanksgiving. The standard history tour
begins at 7:30 p.m. The “Ghostly Haunts and Legends” tour starts at 9
p.m. Call for reservations and meeting places. Tickets are $15 for adults,
$12 for seniors and children 6 to 16, free for children younger than 6.
Narrated cruises run from April or May through November. Capt. John
Boats, 10 Town Wharf (% 800-242-2469 or 508/746-2643; www.capt
john.com), offers a variety of options, including narrated 75-minute
harbor tours on a paddle-wheeler ($14 adults, $12 seniors, $10 children
2–12) and whale-watches.
Seeing the sights
The Visitor Center, 130 Water Street (across from the town pier; % 508-
747-7525), distributes information on Plymouth’s attractions. The center
is open seasonally (spring through Thanksgiving); in the winter, stop at
the Regional Information Complex at Exit 5 off Route 3 before heading
into town.
The sight to see (ask the kids) is Plymouth Rock, which history tells us
was the landing place of the Mayflower passengers. Originally 15 feet
long and 3 feet wide, the rock is now much smaller, having been moved
and broken several times. It sits at tide level on the waterfront not far
from the Visitor Center; signs at nearly every intersection in town point
the way to the stately portico. Yes, it’s just a rock, but the descriptions
are absorbing, and a solemn sense of history surrounds the enclosure.
Mayflower II
A stone’s throw from Plymouth Rock, Mayflower II is a full-scale reproduc-
tion of the type of vessel that brought the Pilgrims from England to
Plymouth in 1620. Full scale is a mere 1061⁄2 feet — you may want to remind
the kids that it’s not a scaled-down model. Costumed guides provide first-
person narratives about the voyage and the vessel, and displays illustrate

the Pilgrims’ experiences and the history of the ship, which was built in
England from 1955 to 1957. Plan to spend at least an hour here.
State Pier. % 508-746-1622. www.plimoth.org. Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors,
$6 children 6–12, free for children younger than 6. Admission for Plimoth Plantation
(good for 2 consecutive days) and Mayflower II: $25 adults, $22 seniors, $15 children
6–12, $90 families (2 adults and up to 4 children 6–17), free for children younger than
6. Open: Apr–Nov daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Dec–Mar.
Pilgrim Hall Museum
This museum illustrates the daily lives of Plymouth’s first white residents
with unbeatable props: original possessions of the Pilgrims and their
descendants. Displays include one of early settler Myles Standish’s
swords; an uncomfortable chair that belonged to the Pilgrims’ original
leader, William Brewster (you can sit on a modern-day model, not on the
original); and Governor Bradford’s Bible. The intriguing temporary exhibits

focus on one topic per year — recent subjects have included maritime his-
tory and the treatment of children. Allow at least an hour.
75 Court St. % 508-746-1620. www.pilgrimhall.org. From Plymouth Rock, walk
north on Water Street and up the hill on Chilton Street. Admission: $6 adults, $5 sen-
iors and AAA members, $3 children 5–17, $16 families, free for children younger than
5. Open: Feb–Dec daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Closed Jan.
Plimoth Plantation
Allow at least half a day to experience this re-creation of the 1627 village.
The “settlers” are actors who assume the personalities of members of the
original community; if you chat them up, the actors will pretend not to
know anything contemporary, which many kids enjoy. Extensive exhibits
and a film produced by the History Channel help place the village and the
adjoining native home site (included in plantation admission) in context.
The settlers also take part in typical activities, using only the tools and
cookware available at the time; you may be able to join the cast in activi-
ties such as harvesting or witnessing a trial. Wear comfortable shoes,
because you’ll be walking all over, and the plantation isn’t paved.
Route 3. % 508-746-1622. www.plimoth.org. From Route 3, take Exit 4, “Plimoth
Plantation Highway.” Admission (good for 2 consecutive days): $21 adults, $19 sen-
iors, $12 children 6–12, free for children younger than 6. Admission for both Plimoth
Plantation and Mayflower II: $25 adults, $22 seniors and students, $15 children 6–12,
$90 families (2 adults and up to 4 children 6–17), free for children younger than 6.
Open: Apr–Nov daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Dec–Mar.
Dining in Plymouth
On Town Wharf, off Water Street, the Lobster Hut (% 508-746-2270) is a
self-service seafood restaurant with a sensational harbor view. Try the
soups and the excellent “rolls” (hot dog buns with your choice of
seafood filling). You can order beer and wine, but only with a meal.
Closed January. The Run of the Mill Tavern (% 508-830-1262) is near
the water wheel at Jenney Grist Mill Village, in Town Brook Park off
Summer Street. The tavern doesn’t have a great view, but it serves tasty
bar fare and seafood in an attractive setting; the clam chowder is great.

Part V
Living It Up after
Dark: Boston
Nightlife

In this part . . .
B
oston offers patrons of the performing arts an abun-
dance of options: an internationally renowned sym-
phony orchestra, the beloved Boston Pops, a top-notch ballet
company, theater a step away from Broadway, and student
performances of every imaginable type. This part outlines
your choices and steers you toward sources that can provide
you with more information.
You may notice that I’m not rushing to tout the area’s nightlife
options. They’re nowhere near as encyclopedic as the cul-
tural offerings, though some can be just as entertaining. This
city loves bars and embraces clubs that schedule everything
from comedy to folk to jazz to rock. True, the post-midnight
scene is sketchy, but that’s not to say that you can’t howl at
the moon into the wee hours. Just don’t expect to have a lot
of company.

Applauding the 
Cultural Scene
In This Chapter

 Listening to live music — classical and popular
 Enjoying an evening of theater, ballet, or film
M
aybe you make your nightlife plans months ahead and don’t
worry about them again. Perhaps you prefer to wait until after
dinner before deciding what to do next. Boston ably accommodates
both strategies. In this chapter, I help you lay the groundwork and then
direct you toward the resources you need to keep up on the classical
and popular music scenes, as well as the theater and film worlds.
For the locations of the venues I recommend, see the maps in this chap-
ter. (The bars and clubs that I describe in Chapter 16 also appear on the
maps in this chapter.)
Getting the Inside Scoop
The cultural scene in the Boston area is one of the liveliest in the country.
True, it’s not New York or Los Angeles — but what is? Your choices may
be limited, but you still have more options than you can ever take advan-
tage of. And Boston’s compact size means nearly everything worth seeing
is easy to reach. From world-class classical musicians in a legendary con-
cert hall to a mime on a grimy sidewalk, people express themselves
through their art all over town. Many of those artists are college stu-
dents, whose performances are generally both cheap and enjoyable.
The main destination for pre- and post-Broadway shows is the Theater
District, which centers on the intersection of Tremont and Stuart streets,
on the edge of Chinatown. Other major arts destinations: Symphony Hall
is at the corner of Mass. Ave. and Huntington Avenue, a block from the
Boston University Theatre; Harvard Square is in Cambridge; and the TD
Banknorth Garden sits above Boston’s North Station.

If you take a cab or (heaven help you) drive to a show or performance,
allow plenty of time, which you’ll spend sitting in traffic and trying to
park. The best way to get practically everywhere is to take the T or walk
(or both). To reach the Theater District, go to Boylston or Arlington
(Green Line), or New England Medical Center or Chinatown (Orange
Line). South Station (Red Line) is about 15 minutes away on foot.
Symphony Hall has a T stop: Symphony (Green Line E). Or get off at
Mass. Ave. (Orange Line) or Hynes/ICA (Green Line B, C, or D) and then
walk five or ten minutes on Mass. Ave. The TD Banknorth Garden is at
North Station (Green or Orange Line). Harvard Square has a stop on the
Red Line.
Just as you don’t need to dress for dinner, you don’t need a suit and tie
for the theater or a concert. You won’t be out of place in something
dressy, but for most events, anything clean and neat is fine. If you insist
on wearing jeans to the symphony, theater, or ballet, I doubt I can stop
you. But I will suggest that a big evening out feels a lot splashier if you’re
dressed for the occasion.
Whatever you wear, finish primping early. If you’re not in your seat when
the curtain goes up, you’ll have to wait for a break in the action, and that
may take a while.
If your plans for the evening include a meal, see the sidebar “Dining
before or after a show” (later in this chapter) for suggestions.
Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
To take a broad look at the performing arts events Boston has to offer,
check a general resource such as the Boston Globe’s Web site (www.
boston.com). Major pop and rock performers play at the TD Banknorth
Garden (% 617-624-1000; www.tdbanknorthgarden.com). Even the
smallest venues and performing arts companies operate Web sites that
list upcoming shows. Also visit your favorite performer’s or group’s Web
site to check schedules.
A hotel package that includes tickets to a show can be a terrific conven-
ience. The ticket price may not reflect great savings, but knowing for
sure that you have seats for The Nutcracker will save a lot of worrying.
Some companies and venues sell tickets by phone or on the Web; many
use an agency. The major Boston agencies are
 Ticketmaster (% 617-931-2000; www.ticketmaster.com)
 Next Ticketing (% 617-423-NEXT or 617-423-6398; www.next
ticketing.com)
 Tele-Charge (% 800-447-7400; www.telecharge.com)
Part V: Boston Nightlife 
234

Before you finalize your ticket order, be sure to ask for the total price,
which will include a service charge and possibly other fees, such as a
building-restoration charge. The service charge can be hefty, and it
applies per ticket, not per order. If there’s even a tiny chance that your
plans may change, double-check the refund policy before you hand over
your credit-card number.
Major events appear months (sometimes years) in advance on venues’
Web sites; check ahead to see whether your favorite group, company, or
artist is scheduled to play Boston. Knowing this information in advance
may influence your travel plans.
If you haven’t made plans in advance, the “Sidekick” section of the
Monday through Saturday Boston Globe, the “Calendar” section of the
Thursday Globe, the “Edge” section of the Friday Boston Herald, and the
Sunday arts sections of both papers overflow with possibilities. Other
good resources are the weekly Boston Phoenix and biweekly Improper
Bostonian — available free from newspaper boxes all over town.
When you find something appealing, call the box office to see whether
the event is sold out. If you’re looking for a deal, check at a BosTix booth
(% 617-482-2849; www.bostix.org). BosTix booths are at Faneuil Hall
Marketplace (on the south side of Faneuil Hall) and in Copley Square (at
the corner of Boylston and Dartmouth streets). They sell same-day thea-
ter and concert tickets for half price, subject to availability. No credit
cards, refunds, or exchanges are allowed. Check the board or the Web
site for the day’s offerings. BosTix also sells full-price advance tickets
and offers discounts on theater, music, and dance events. Half-price tick-
ets go on sale at 11 a.m. The booths are open Tuesday through Saturday
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Copley Square booth
is open Monday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 235
Dining before or after a show
Most restaurants in and near the Theater District can accommodate the beat-the-
clock dining style of patrons with an 8 o’clock curtain to catch, but you must remem-
ber to alert (and, if necessary, remind) the staff. Two of my favorite destinations are
Buddha’s Delight, 5 Beach St. (% 617-451-2395), for vegetarian Vietnamese and Asian
food, and Finale, 1 Columbus Ave. (% 617-423-3184), which specializes in desserts.
The Legal Sea Foods at 36 Park Sq., between Columbus Avenue and Stuart Street 
(% 617-426-4444) is also convenient for a pre-show meal. Harvard Square has a
branch of Finale at 30 Dunster St. (% 617-441-9797), about five minutes from most
Harvard University performance spaces, including the American Repertory Theatre.
Turn to Chapter 10 for restaurant reviews.

If a show sounds great but is sold out, ask for help from your concierge,
who may have ticket connections. Finally — this is a long shot, but
worth a try — visit the box office in person. Patrons sometimes return
tickets (good ones, too), and some venues block seats before configur-
ing the performance space and then release the extras.
Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
Before plunging into specifics of venues and companies, I want to recom-
mend two eclectic series. The first is summer only, outdoors, and free.
From early June to mid-September, the Hatch Shell amphitheater (T:
Charles/MGH [Red Line] or Arlington [Green Line]; % 617-727-5215) on
the Esplanade, located on the Boston side of the Charles River, between
Storrow Drive and the water, books music and dance performances and
films. (If you’ve seen the Boston Pops’ Fourth of July concert on TV,
you’ve seen the Hatch Shell.) Seating is on the grass or on a blanket, if
you have one. Check ahead for schedules.
The other top series coordinates performances by international stars of
classical music, dance, theater, jazz, and world music. The Celebrity
Series, 20 Park Plaza, Boston, MA 02116 (% 617-482-2595, or 617-482-
6661 for Celebrity Charge; www.celebrityseries.org), takes place at
venues throughout the Boston area. Tickets are available to individual
performances or in packages to three or more events.
Classical music
The Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) and the Boston Pops perform
at Symphony Hall, 301 Massachusetts Ave. (at Huntington Avenue; T:
Symphony [Green Line E]). The hall, known around the world for its per-
fect acoustics, turned 100 in 2000; when the main tenants are away,
other companies and artists fill the schedule. The BSO is in residence
from September to April, and the Pops from May to early July and for
three weeks of holiday shows in December. Symphony tickets start at
$28 and top out north of $100; seeing the Pops will set you back $17 to
$75. Call % 617-266-1492 or 617-CONCERT for program information, or
% 617-266-1200 for tickets, or check www.bso.org.
The Pops also schedules several free outdoor performances, including
the renowned Fourth of July concert, in early July at the Hatch Shell.
Visit the box office two hours before a BSO or Pops showtime, when
returns from subscribers go on sale (at full price). A limited number of
Symphony “rush” tickets (one per person, same day only) go on sale for
$8 at 9 a.m. Friday and 5 p.m. on Tuesday and Thursday. Wednesday-
evening and Thursday-morning rehearsals are sometimes open to the
public; call to see whether rehearsal tickets ($16) are available.
The highly regarded Handel & Haydn Society (% 617-266-3605; www.
handelandhaydn.org) schedules “historically informed” concerts,
Part V: Boston Nightlife 
236

often with a choir, year-round. The ensemble uses period instruments
and techniques in interpreting baroque and classical music.
Students and faculty members at three prestigious institutions perform
frequently during the academic year; admission is usually free or cheap.
Most other area colleges schedule student performances, but these are
the big three:
 Berklee College of Music (% 617-747-2261; www.berklee.edu)
 New England Conservatory of Music (% 617-585-1122; www.new
englandconservatory.edu)
 Longy School of Music (% 617-876-0956; www.longy.edu)
Pop and rock music
The TD Banknorth Garden, 100 Legends Way, off Causeway Street 
(T: North Station [Orange or Green Line]; % 617-624-1000; www.td
banknorthgarden.com), is the major arena for touring groups and
artists. Built in 1995, the Garden is a top-of-the-line facility, but the seat-
ing is at a pretty shallow angle; bring binoculars.
The Bank of America Pavilion, 290 Northern Ave., South Boston 
(T: South Station [Red Line] and Silver Line bus; % 617-374-9000; www.
bankofamericapavilion.com), is a huge white tent open only in the
summer. The pavilion books pop, jazz, folk, country, and some rock and
rap artists. The airy outdoor setting makes this spot especially enjoyable.
Plan to take the Silver Line, or be ready for at least a 30-minute walk 
from the T station; call ahead for shuttle-bus and water-transportation
information.
Turn to Chapter 16 for listings of smaller places to hear live rock and
pop, as well as for jazz, folk, and blues clubs.
Theater
Pre-Broadway tryouts still play Boston, as do touring national compa-
nies of shows that do well in New York. It’s not unusual for shows to be
up at every major professional stage. Two noted repertory companies
and dozens of colleges also contribute to the buzz.
Most Broadway shows play in the Theater District at the following 
locations:
 Colonial Theatre, 106 Boylston St. (% 617-426-9366)
 Opera House, 539 Washington St. (% 617-880-2400)
 Shubert Theatre, 265 Tremont St. (% 617-482-9393)
 Wang Theatre, 270 Tremont St. (% 617-482-9393)
 Wilbur Theater, 246 Tremont St. (% 617-423-4008)

More often than not, the promoter is Broadway Across America 
(% 866-523-7469; www.broadwayacrossamerica.com). The Shubert
and the Wang are part of the Citi Performing Arts Center (www.citi
center.org).
Two university spaces are home to professional troupes. The Hunting-
ton Theatre Company plays at the Boston University Theatre, 264
Huntington Ave. (T: Symphony [Green Line E]; % 617-266-0800; www.
huntingtontheatre.org). The American Repertory Theatre (ART,
pronounced A-R-T, not art) performs at Harvard University’s Loeb Drama
Center, 64 Brattle St., Cambridge (T: Harvard [Red Line]; % 617-547-
8300; www.amrep.org).
The Huntington and the ART tend to be more adventurous than their
Theater District counterparts; for something even more audacious, 
head to the South End. The Boston Center for the Arts, 539 Tremont St.
(between Berkeley and Clarendon streets; T: Back Bay [Orange Line]; 
% 617-426-2787; www.bcaonline.org), boasts five performance spaces,
including two gorgeous new theaters, and an apparent willingness to try
just about anything.
Children old enough to be interested in the theater can enjoy a good
introduction at either of two long-running shows: Blue Man Group and
Shear Madness. How old should your child be to attend these shows? I’d
say 10 or so — this is a lot of money to spend on someone who may not
stay engaged until the curtain falls — but that’s your call. Blue Man
Group (www.blueman.com) consists of three cobalt-colored performance
artists and a rock band. The show incorporates goofy props (including
food), music, and willing spectators who become participants — one
even gets painted. Shear Madness (www.shearmadness.com) is a “comic
murder mystery” set in a hair salon. The audience helps solve the crime;
the details have been different at every performance since the show
opened in Boston in 1980.
Both shows run (on different stages) at the Charles Playhouse, 74
Warrenton St., off Stuart Street, in the Theater District. Tickets for Blue
Man Group cost $48 and $58; Shear Madness tickets run $40. Buy tickets
at the box office or through Ticketmaster.
Dance
If you’ve heard of Boston Ballet (% 617-695-6955; www.bostonballet.
org), that’s probably because of The Nutcracker — an excellent reason,
but not the only one. The company presents classic and modern works
from October through May. Tickets run $45 to $105; students should
check ahead for information about discounted “rush” (same-day) tick-
ets. Performances of the regular repertory are at the Wang Theatre, 270
Tremont St.; The Nutcracker runs at the Opera House, 539 Washington
St.; tickets cost $25 to $150.
Part V: Boston Nightlife 
242

Built as a movie palace in the 1920s, the Wang presents certain difficul-
ties for the ballet audience — namely, awkward sightlines and the sensa-
tion that you’re about to fall out of the balcony. Pack your opera glasses.
Film
Free Friday Flicks (% 617-727-5215; www.wbz.com) projects films on a
large screen in the amphitheater at the Hatch Shell on the Esplanade (T:
Charles/MGH [Red Line] or Arlington [Green Line]). These are family
movies, with a tendency to lean toward the last couple of Disney or Pixar
releases rather than the classics. However, the season is long — a
couple of gems usually sneak in.
Classic movies and new independent releases turn up at a number of
theaters. Film buffs can check out the Brattle Theatre, 40 Brattle St.,
Cambridge (T: Harvard [Red Line]; % 617-876-6837; www.brattlefilm.
org); the Coolidge Corner Theater, 290 Harvard St., Brookline (T: Cool-
idge Corner [Green Line C]; % 617-734-2500; www.coolidge.org); and
the Harvard Film Archive, 24 Quincy St., Cambridge (T: Harvard [Red
Line]; % 617-495-4700; www.hcl.harvard.edu/hfa).

Chapter 16
Hitting the Clubs and Bars
In This Chapter
 Visiting Boston’s bars and lounges
 Listening to live music in small venues
 Dancing and laughing your way through the clubs
 Exploring the gay and lesbian scenes
E
ven if you know nothing about Boston except what you saw on the
TV show Cheers, you already know something important: The neigh-
borhood bar is a big deal. Spending time in a local watering hole is a
great way to get to know any new city, and Boston is no exception. Many
nightspots schedule live music; if you’d rather shake your booty than
bend your elbow, you’ll find a number of places to do that, too. In this
chapter, I guide you toward the most congenial spots to visit.
For locations of recommended nightspots, see the maps in Chapter 15.
The Basics
The state drinking age is 21; you must have a valid driver’s license or
passport. Have an ID ready if you look younger than 35 or so, especially
near college campuses.
When a club advertises a “21-plus” show, that means that only patrons
21 or older may enter; “18-plus” means 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds may
enter but can’t drink alcohol.
By law, bars close at 1 a.m. or earlier, clubs at 2 a.m. Most clubs open
between 7 and 10 p.m., but bars generally open by noon. The T shuts
down by 1 a.m. system-wide, with the last car from some stations run-
ning shortly after 12:30 a.m. Be ready to spring for cab fare. 
Unless otherwise noted, the establishments in this chapter don’t impose
a cover charge; of course, that’s subject to change, depending on the
entertainment on a particular night. Hours are subject to change, too,
depending on who’s playing, who’s booking, and whether a show is all-
ages or 21-plus. If you need specifics, always call ahead.

The information in this chapter is the most volatile in the book. I steer
you toward some reliable places and neighborhoods, but I can’t promise
that what’s hot tonight will even be there next month. Dance clubs that
usually book DJs sometimes feature live music; live-music clubs rarely
restrict themselves to one genre. Check the “Sidekick” section of the
Monday-through-Saturday Boston Globe, the Phoenix, the Improper
Bostonian, the “Calendar” section of the Thursday Globe, or the “Edge”
section of the Friday Herald when you’re making plans.
Hanging Out: Boston’s Best-Known Bars
You’ve probably already heard of these talked-about spots; they’re cele-
brated for good reason.
 Cheers is the most famous tavern in town. The long-running sitcom
remains so popular that the owners of the original bar, which
looked nothing like the one on the TV show, opened a bar that
looks exactly like the set. That bar is in Faneuil Hall Marketplace,
on the north side of Quincy Market (T: Government Center [Green
or Blue Line] or State [Orange Line]; % 617-227-0150; www.cheers
boston.com). Cheers is open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. (food
service until 11:45 p.m.).
 The original Cheers, formerly the Bull & Finch Pub, is at 84 Beacon
St., Beacon Hill (T: Arlington [Green Line]; % 617-227-9605). Some-
what improbably, this location retains a loyal neighborhood clien-
tele, but most patrons are out-of-towners looking for souvenirs 
and snapshots. The exterior sign is the one you remember from all
those late-night reruns. This popular spot is open daily from 11 a.m.
to 1 a.m.; your friend can snap a picture of you in front of the sign
anytime.
 The Hard Rock Cafe, another tourist magnet, was packing up to
move across town at press time. For information and hours, visit
the Web site (www.hardrock.com) or just stop by the new location,
24 Clinton St., at North Street, across the street from Faneuil Hall
Marketplace and the Millennium Bostonian Hotel (T: Haymarket
[Orange Line] or Aquarium [Blue Line]). The Hard Rock features
rock-’n’-roll memorabilia and generous portions of better-than-
average food. And guess what? You can buy a souvenir.
Where Everybody Knows Your 
Name: Neighborhood Bars
This list barely skims the surface and comes with a suggestion: If your
wanderings take you past an agreeable-looking establishment, pop in.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 245

 In Harvard Square, Cambridge (T: Harvard [Red Line]), try Casa-
blanca, 40 Brattle St. (% 617-876-0999), Grafton Street, 1230
Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-497-0400), and Grendel’s Den, 89
Winthrop St. (% 617-491-1160). A colorful mix of patrons — all
ages, with an overrepresentation of pompous academics — makes
for superior eavesdropping.
 In Central Square (T: Central [Red Line]), the Field, 20 Prospect St.
(% 617-354-7345), is an outstanding Irish pub in an area that reveres
Irish pubs. Another excellent example is a few blocks away: River
Gods, 125 River St. (% 617-576-1881).
 On Beacon Hill (T: Charles/MGH [Red Line]) in Boston — which
caters to the postcollegiate set — check out the clean-cut types
swilling beer at the Sevens Ale House, 77 Charles St. (% 617-523-
9074), and the Hill Tavern, 228 Cambridge St. (% 617-742-6192).
 Radius, 8 High St. (T: South Station [Red Line]; % 617-426-1234),
attracts a chic Financial District crowd (no, that’s not a contradic-
tion). The restaurant is the headliner here, but the sleek bar is
almost as much of a see-and-be-seen spot.
 In the Back Bay (T: Arlington [Green Line]), the Parish Café and
Bar, 361 Boylston St. (% 617-247-4777), offers indoor and outdoor
seating. Another after-work hot spot, this place is also a popular
lunch stop because of a terrific sandwich menu.
 In the South End (T: Back Bay/South End [Orange Line]), two
friendly, cramped spots pack in the locals: Anchovies, 433
Columbus Ave. (% 617-266-5066), and the DeLux Cafe, 100
Chandler St. (% 617-338-5258).
My Goodness, My Guinness: Irish Bars
In one of North America’s most Irish cities, Irish bars occupy an honored
place. Ponder which came first — the bartending job or the brogue —
while you sip a Guinness.
 Mr. Dooley’s Boston Tavern, 77 Broad St. (T: State [Orange or Blue
Line]; % 617-338-5656), a popular Financial District spot, is my
favorite. World-class bartenders, hearty food, music, and imported
draft beer in an authentic atmosphere — what more could you
want? There’s a $3 to $5 cover charge on weekend nights.
 The Black Rose, 160 State St. (at Faneuil Hall Marketplace; T: State
[Orange or Blue Line]; % 617-742-2286), is considerably larger and
rowdier. The Black Rose’s live entertainment delights huge crowds
who often sing along. The location makes this bar popular with
tourists, but you’ll find some clued-in locals, too. You’ll pay a cover
of $3 to $5 at night.
Part V: Boston Nightlife 
246

Shaken, Not Stirred: Boston’s Best Lounges
When you’re feeling James Bond–ish, head up to Top of the Hub, 800
Boylston St. (T: Prudential [Green Line E]; % 617-536-1775), on the 52nd
floor of the Prudential Tower. The lounge is an atmospheric place to
begin or end a big evening out. Sunset offers the best view, but any non-
foggy time is good. Top of the Hub schedules live jazz and dancing
nightly; dress is casual but neat. The lounge is open Sunday through
Wednesday until 1 a.m., and Thursday through Saturday until 2 a.m.
Other top-shelf martini shakers reside in elegant, expensive hotel bars,
which stay open into the early morning. (Don’t think of them as pricier
than a regular bar; think of them as cheaper than booking a room.) Dress
up a little.
 The Bristol, in the Four Seasons Hotel, 200 Boylston St. (T: Arling-
ton [Green Line]; % 617-351-2000), is a refined destination for
cocktails, luscious American food, afternoon tea, and (on weekend
nights) the decadent Viennese dessert buffet. The Bristol schedules
live piano music every night.
 The Oak Bar at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, 138 St. James Ave.
(T: Copley [Green Line]; % 617-267-5300), is the clubbiest place in
town. Wood paneling, a raw bar, and nightly live entertainment set
the scene. Proper dress is required. The Oak Bar is open daily at
4:30 p.m.
 The bar at the Taj Boston (formerly the Ritz-Carlton, Boston), 15
Arlington St. (T: Arlington [Green Line]; % 617-536-5700), was
famous long before Cheers was a prime-time staple. The attraction
is a combination of Brahmin atmosphere and killer martinis.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 247
Out on the town with the kids
Maybe there’s a better way to look cool in front of your kids than taking them to a
trendy nightlife destination (in the afternoon, but still). I just can’t think what it is.
The most reliable destination when you’re putting on this particular show is the Hard
Rock Cafe. A less predictable option is a high-class bowling alley: Kings, 10 Scotia St.
(% 617-266-BOWL; www.backbaykings.com), is a 25,000-square-foot complex in
a former movie theater with 20 bowling lanes (four of them private) and an eight-table
billiards room. Also here are a retro-cool bar, the DeVille Lounge, and a branch of the
Cambridge restaurant Jasper White’s Summer Shack. Scotia Street is off Dalton Street,
across from the Hynes Convention Center. Kings is open Monday 5 p.m. to 2 a.m.,
Tuesday through Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 2 a.m.; after 6 p.m., patrons must be 21.

Shaking Your Groove Thing: 
The Best Dance Clubs
Boston’s most popular nightlife destination is Kenmore Square, specifi-
cally Lansdowne Street, off Brookline Avenue outside the square, across
the street from Fenway Park. A close second is Boylston Place, an alley
(known cleverly as “The Alley”) off Boylston Street near Tremont Street.
 The city’s best dance club, Avalon, 15 Lansdowne St. (T: Kenmore
[Green Line B, C, or D]; % 617-262-2424; www.avalonboston.com),
is probably reinventing some aspect of itself as you read this book.
This multilevel space near Kenmore Square often books concerts,
but the consistent reason to come here is “Avaland,” the Friday-
night dance party. Management imports high-profile DJs and turns
house dancers loose. The cover is usually $10 to $20 but jumps for
special events. Avalon is open Thursday through Sunday 10 p.m. to
2 a.m. The dress code forbids jeans and athletic wear, and requires
jackets and shirts with collars for men.
 Under the same management, Axis, 13 Lansdowne St. (T: Kenmore
[Green Line B, C, or D]; % 617-262-2437), boasts a younger (colle-
giate and postcollegiate), looser crowd. Deafening rock, house, and
techno music keep the leather-clad crowds moving. The cover
charge is around $7 to $11. Axis is open Monday and Thursday
through Saturday 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.
 The Alley constantly evolves to stay within the attention span of its
recent-college-graduate core clientele; if that’s you, you’re sure to
find a congenial landing spot. The granddaddy of this scene is the
Sweetwater Café, 3 Boylston Place (T: Boylston [Green Line]; 
% 617-351-2515; www.sweetwatercafeboston.com), which
appeals to laid-back 20-somethings. The see-and-be-seen crowd is
next door at Mansion, 1 Boylston Place (T: Boylston [Green Line];
% 617-351-7000), a two-level space that schedules top-notch 
local DJs.
Turning Up the Volume: The Best Rock Clubs
Cambridge’s Central Square (T: Central [Red Line]) draws enthusiastic
crowds that go for music-making over scene-making. Many shows are 
18-plus, with room for 30-pluses who can keep their fogeyish musings to
themselves. (But boy, these places are loud.)
 The Middle East, 472–480 Massachusetts Ave. (% 617-864-EAST;
www.mideastclub.com), is the best rock club in the area. Enthu-
siastic crowds pack its four performance spaces for rock of all
stripes every night. The cover ranges from $7 to $15.
Part V: Boston Nightlife 
248

 T. T. the Bear’s Place, 10 Brookline St. (% 617-492-0082, or con-
cert line 617-492-BEAR; www.ttthebears.com), runs the musical
gamut with eclectic bookings. This place is a little crowded; expect
to get to know your neighbors. The cover runs from $3 to $15 but is
usually under $10.
Across the river in Boston, you find a somewhat more sophisticated
clientele at the Paradise Rock Club, 967 Commonwealth Ave. (T: Green
Line B to Pleasant Street; % 617-562-8804, or 617-423-NEXT for tickets;
www.thedise.com). This club is one of the best-known live-music venues
in the area — the medium size allows artists who aren’t ready to tour
solo to headline. This club is also famous for tangling with the Boston
Licensing Board over the question of underage patrons; you must have
an ID. Tickets run $10 to $30.
Focusing on the Music: The Best 
Jazz, Folk, and Blues Clubs
The local jazz, folk, and blues clubs in Boston are some of the best in the
country — an enjoyable dilemma for devotees, a great opportunity for
novices. You simply can’t go wrong at any of the places listed here.
 The Regattabar is in The Charles Hotel, 1 Bennett St., Harvard
Square (T: Harvard [Red Line]; % 617-661-5000, or 617-395-7757
for tickets; www.regattabarjazz.com). Crowds in the large space
sometimes get a little distracted (and chatty). Tickets run $12 to
$36. The Regattabar is open Tuesday through Saturday and some
Sundays. Check the Web site for showtimes.
 Scullers Jazz Club is in the Doubletree Guest Suites hotel, 400
Soldiers Field Rd. (% 617-562-4111; www.scullersjazz.com). The
room overlooks the Charles. The difficulty of getting to the hotel,
which is not near the T, means the crowd includes fewer casual
fans — a plus if your favorite artist is playing. Ask about dinner
packages, which include preferred seating. Show tickets cost $15 to
$50. Check the Web site for showtimes.
 Near a nondescript corner in the South End is a club that’s as
famous with touring musicians as it is unknown to many locals.
Wally’s Cafe, 427 Massachusetts Ave. (T: Mass. Ave. [Orange Line]
or Symphony [Green Line E]; % 617-424-1408; www.wallyscafe.
com), a legend since shortly after it opened in 1947, schedules live
jazz nightly at 9 p.m. Management doesn’t charge a cover but does
impose a one-drink minimum.
 If folk is your thing, you probably already know about Club Passim,
47 Palmer St. (T: Harvard [Red Line]; % 617-492-7679), one of the
few remaining legends in Harvard Square. It lives up to its interna-
tional reputation as a folk-music proving ground. The coffeehouse
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 249

(which does not serve alcohol) has been around for more than 30
years; your favorite folk artist has almost certainly played here.
The cover charge is usually $5 to $12 or so; for big names, it may
top $20. Open daily 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
 Johnny D’s Uptown Restaurant & Music Club, 17 Holland St.,
Somerville (T: Davis [Red Line]; % 617-776-2004, or concert line
617-776-9667; www.johnnyds.com), schedules a wild assortment of
musical genres and styles. No matter what your taste, the schedule
is worth checking out. If your taste runs to food, Johnny D’s has
that, too. Cover $3 to $20, usually $12 or less. Open daily 11:30 a.m.
to 1 a.m. Somerville is just north of Cambridge.
 Central Square’s Cantab Lounge, 738 Massachusetts Ave. (T: Central
[Red line]; % 617-354-2685; www.cantab-lounge.com), is a neigh-
borhood bar that happens to book great music — usually R&B or
rock, sometimes jazz. The crowd is a cross section of the funky
neighborhood, and the cover charge seldom tops $8. Open Sunday
through Wednesday until 1 a.m. and Thursday through Saturday
until 2 a.m. The kitchen is open 5 to 11 p.m. Monday through
Saturday; it’s closed Sunday.
Laughing the Night Away: Comedy Clubs
Get ready to clutch your sides and smile until your cheeks hurt at these
spots.
 The Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall, on the upper level of
Quincy Market (T: Government Center [Green or Blue Line] or Hay-
market [Orange Line]; % 617-248-9700; www.comedyconnection
boston.com), is the best comedy club around. Promising locals
and big-name visitors have packed the spacious room since 1978.
Tickets run from $8 (for unknowns) to more than $30 (for sitcom
stars and the like).
 You’ll find fewer famous names but more potential in Cambridge 
at the Comedy Studio, in the Hong Kong restaurant, 1236 Massa-
chusetts Ave. (T: Harvard [Red Line]; % 617-661-6507; www.The
ComedyStudio.com). This place is good for improv, inspired spar-
ring with the audience, and sketch comedy.
Stepping Out: The Gay and Lesbian Scene
Some dance clubs (see earlier in this chapter for locations and tele-
phone numbers) schedule a weekly gay night. The largest and best
known is Sunday at Avalon; at neighboring Axis, Monday is gay night.
Buzz is the name of the Saturday party at Aria, 246 Tremont St., beneath
the Wilbur Theatre (T: Boylston [Green Line]; % 617-267-8969; www.
buzzboston.com). For women, the can’t-miss night is Sunday at Jamaica
Part V: Boston Nightlife 
250

Plain’s Milky Way Lounge, 401 Centre St. (T: Stony Brook [Orange Line];
% 617-524-3720; www.milkywayjp.com), which features a wide variety
of live entertainment.
For up-to-date entertainment listings, check www.edgeboston.com and
boston.lesbiannightlife.com as well as the Web sites of the weekly
publications Bay Windows (www.baywindows.com) and the Phoenix
(www.bostonphoenix.com).
The following are some reliable hangouts:
 Club Café, 209 Columbus Ave., South End (T: Arlington [Green
Line] or Back Bay [Orange Line]; % 617-536-0966; www.clubcafe.
com), is a lively spot, but not so noisy as to restrict conversation.
Club Café attracts both men and women. Thursday is see-and-be-
seen night. The club is open Sunday through Wednesday until 
1 a.m. and Thursday through Saturday until 2 a.m.
 Jacques, 79 Broadway, in Bay Village, next to the Theater District
(T: Arlington [Green Line]; % 617-426-8902; www.jacques
cabaret.com), is Boston’s only drag venue. Jacques attracts a
mixed (gay and straight) clientele with live music and performance
art, too. The club is open daily until midnight.
 The Ramrod, 1254 Boylston St. (T: Hynes/ICA or Kenmore [Green
Line B, C, or D]; % 617-266-2986; www.ramrodboston.com), is a
leather bar that opens daily at noon. Downstairs is the wildly popu-
lar (especially on Fri night) dance club Machine (% 617-536-1950;
www.machinenightclub.com). 
 Fritz, in the Chandler Inn Hotel, 26 Chandler St. (at Berkeley Street;
T: Back Bay [Orange Line]; % 617-482-4428), will make you feel
right at home: It’s a neighborhood sports bar that’s open daily 
until 1 a.m.

you may want to adopt a “when in Rome” approach and try to blend in.
This chapter offers suggestions for fitting in without becoming so assimi-
lated that people are asking you for directions. But if they do, maybe you
can help — by now, you probably know where the maps are in this book!
Always Dress in Layers
Even on the steamiest summer day, a midafternoon change in wind
direction (or a stop at an enthusiastically air-conditioned store) can
mean a sharp drop in temperature. You’ll be glad to pull on a long-
sleeved T-shirt or light sweater. And a spring or fall day that starts 
with a foggy morning can become toasty after the haze burns off — 
not a good time to have nothing on under your sweatshirt.
Keep Moving
Bostonians reputedly walk and talk faster than any other Americans —
even New Yorkers. While sightseeing, step to the curb to check your
map, count heads, or admire the architecture. Remember that the neigh-
borhoods that attract hordes of tourists are also places where regular
people live and work. When you block locals’ paths while you get your
bearings, you’re forcing the home team off the sidewalks and into the
paths of (scary sound effect) Boston traffic.

Stay in Touch with the Freedom Trail
Distinguished by red paint or red brick smack in the middle of the side-
walk, the Freedom Trail won’t steer you wrong. If you lose track of where
you are, follow the trail to an intersection or landmark. You don’t need
to keep to the trail religiously; in fact, I strongly suggest a bit of wander-
ing. One important note: If you’re standing right smack on the trail as
you tangle with your map, you’ll look like a big ol’ tourist.
Don’t Exclaim “That Must 
Be the Old North Church!”
As you follow the Freedom Trail away from the Paul Revere House, you
come to a house of worship on Hanover Street. This building is St.
Stephen’s, the last remaining Boston church designed by legendary
architect Charles Bulfinch. The Old North Church is across the street, a
block beyond the Paul Revere statue that faces St. Stephen’s.
Be in Your Party Clothes Early
Bars close at 1 a.m. or earlier, clubs wrap things up at 2 a.m., and the
line between “fashionably late” and “shut out” is all too thin. If the only
admirers of your hot new outfit are the other people at the 24-hour
doughnut shop or convenience store, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Bring Cab Fare
If you manage to scout out some late-night action, don’t expect to jump
on the T when you’re through. On Sunday through Thursday nights, the
T closes by 1 a.m. (Every station posts the time of the last train in either
direction.) After that, you’re at the mercy of friends and cabbies.
Watch What You Say about Baseball
In cities that take sports less seriously, you can start a casual conversa-
tion with “How ’bout those (insert the name of the local nine)?” But
Boston has alarmingly few casual fans. Unless you’re ready to hear the
gory details of where your cabbie — or cardiologist or manicurist or
friend’s grandmother — was during every nail-biting moment of the Red
Sox’s march to the 2004 World Series title, break the ice with a quip
about the weather.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
256

Likewise, Chowder
This issue is less contentious than it once was, but it is still divisive. The
dispute concerns a certain red ingredient in the clam chowder in a big
city some 200 miles south of the right-thinking people of Boston. You can
sidestep the issue by ordering the version Legal Sea Foods attributes to
Rhode Island (never Manhattan), but few other restaurants north of
Connecticut will accommodate your heretical preference. In short, 
New England clam chowder does not contain tomatoes. Deal with it.
Pack the Right Shoes
Especially if you visit downtown, think twice before strapping on san-
dals. The Big Dig acted as a sort of gravel farm, and the closer you get to
the aftermath, the likelier you are to wind up with something uncomfort-
able in your shoe. Stick to closed footwear. And if you believe wearing
socks with your sandals is an acceptable alternative, I’m sorry, but I’m
going to have to pretend that we’ve never met.
Save the “I Pahked My Cah” Jokes
Everybody has an accent, even you — you just can’t hear your own. The
Boston accent isn’t exactly poetic, but making fun of someone who
speaks with one is both provincial and rude. That doesn’t mean you
can’t enjoy the accent, though. Use your curious ear for discreet eaves-
dropping (the T is great for this pastime), and you’ll soon be so wrapped
up in a discussion of how your fellow passenger’s “ahnt” had the wrong
“idear” that you may miss your stop.

The Top Ten Free (or Almost
Free) Activities
In This Chapter
 Finding free — or practically free — cultural events
 Touring Boston on the cheap
 Locating the best people-watching spots
W
hether your budget resembles an impoverished student’s or a
software magnate’s, a few extra bucks are always welcome. In
this chapter, I point you toward activities that can help create financial
wiggle room. For general information on all things budgetary, turn to
Chapter 4.
Music Outdoors
In warm weather, musicians take to the streets and outdoor venues in
droves. The free performances range from impromptu jam sessions to
huge concerts that promote local radio stations. One congenial series
brings jazz to Christopher Columbus Park, on the waterfront across the
street from Faneuil Hall Marketplace, at 6:30 p.m. on summer Fridays.
Copley Square, City Hall Plaza, and the Hatch Shell on the Charles River
Esplanade book larger events. Check around (in the papers or at the
front desk of your hotel) when you arrive — you’re sure to find some-
thing that appeals to you.
Music Indoors
Colleges and churches take up the slack when cold weather drives tune-
smiths indoors. Students and instructors at local universities as well as
prestigious conservatories perform throughout the school year.

The big academic names are the Berklee College of Music (www.
berklee.edu), the New England Conservatory (www.newengland
conservatory.edu), and Cambridge’s Longy School of Music (www.
longy.edu), but there’s no telling what you may find while in Boston.
Churches schedule secular performances as well as religious works; the
best-known series runs year-round at historic Trinity Church, in Copley
Square, Fridays at 12:15 p.m.
Check listings in the Globe (calendar.boston.com) or the Phoenix
(www.bostonphoenix.com) before or when you arrive for more informa-
tion about the Boston area’s abundant free and cheap activities.
National Park Service Tours
At the Park Service sites that dot eastern Massachusetts, free or inex-
pensive tours help interpret the historical and cultural attractions.
Check the Web site (www.nps.gov) or drop into the Boston National
Historic Park Visitor Center, 15 State St. (% 617-242-5642), for more
information.
Movies
The Free Friday Flicks (www.wbz.com) film series brings family movies
to the Esplanade every summer. The kid-friendly picture will probably
be something that’s available on video, but the experience — under the
stars, ruffled by a breeze off the river — makes this series feel like more
than just another movie.
The Boston Public Library (www.bpl.org) schedules free movies year-
round at the main branch, in Copley Square, and at neighborhood
branches all over the city. Check ahead; you may stumble upon a gem.
Theater
Theater is another area with a substantial college component, and the
usual potential and pitfalls of amateur stagecraft. Again, local listings
can point you in the right direction. For the less adventurous (or more
discriminating, if you prefer), professionals perform free on Boston
Common in July and early August with the Commonwealth Shakespeare
Company (www.freeshakespeare.org). The top-notch troupe mounts
one production per season. 
Chapter 18: The Top Ten Free (or Almost Free) Activities 259

Museums
Your low-budget options are few but fun. 
 Free: The USS Constitution Museum, the Institute of Contemporary
Art on Thursday from 5 to 9 p.m., the Harvard University Art
Museums until noon Saturday, and the Harvard natural-history
museums until noon on Sunday year-round and Wednesday from 
3 to 5 p.m. during the school year. 
 Cheap: The Children’s Museum charges $1 per person on Friday
from 5 to 9 p.m., and most Freedom Trail sites that do charge
admission don’t charge too much — the Bostonian Society’s
museum in Old City Hall is $5 for adults; the Paul Revere House is
$3. The Museum of Fine Arts schedules pay-what-you-wish hours
on Wednesday from 4 to 9:45 p.m. but “suggests” that adults
“donate” $15. If you’re just interested in shopping (and believe me,
you’re not alone), remember that every museum will let you into
the gift shop without paying an admission fee.
People-Watching
For the price of a cup of coffee or a drink, you can camp out and enjoy a
passing parade just about anywhere. Three favorite destinations: side-
walk tables and window seats on Newbury Street in the Back Bay, the
Hanover Street caffès in the North End, and the outdoor tables at the Au
Bon Pain in Harvard Square.
Haymarket
Haymarket can fall under “People-Watching,” but this is such an unusual
experience that it deserves special attention. The open-air market con-
sists of stalls piled high with fruits, veggies, and sometimes fish. Located
on Blackstone and North streets, near Faneuil Hall Marketplace and the
North End, the market operates only on Friday and Saturday. If you’re on
the Freedom Trail, slow down and have your camera ready — the gregar-
ious vendors, fanatical bargain-hunters, and colorful produce make a
perfect photo op.
Street Fairs
You can find alfresco diversions, from fashion shows to pony rides, all
over town on weekends throughout the summer and fall. The North End,
the Back Bay, Harvard Square, and Central Square stage notable multiple-
block parties; check the newspapers or ask at your hotel’s front desk for
details of festivities during your visit.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
260

Hydrotherapy
Check out a map of Boston and Cambridge, both of which abound 
with waterfront property. Pack a lunch, a camera, or just a craving for a
little downtime, and head toward the harbor or the river to kick back.
Maritime traffic constantly crisscrosses the harbor, which lies within
view of Logan Airport’s flight patterns. Recreational craft on the Charles
River include graceful sailboats and college crew shells.
You can find excellent spots for a water break in downtown Boston along
Long Wharf (follow State Street to the end) and off Commercial Street at
Fleet Street and at Hull Street, in Charlestown near the harbor ferry dock,
and in the Back Bay on the Charles River Esplanade. The Cambridge side
of the river is essentially one long park, with particularly enjoyable spots
near Harvard and Kendall squares.
Another great experience involving water and not too much money is
the ferry between Long Wharf, near the New England Aquarium, and the
Charlestown Navy Yard. The $1.70 one-way fare includes a million-dollar
view of the harbor.

Chapter 19
The Top Ten Things to 
Do in Bad Weather
In This Chapter
 Cooling off in the heat of the moment
 Taking shelter from the storm
 Warming up — baby, it’s cold outside
T
he most familiar cliché about New England weather — “If you don’t
like it, wait ten minutes” — is often true. But what if the forecast
calls for round-the-clock sweltering heat or nonstop bone-chilling cold?
In this chapter, I share some coping strategies for the days when peeling
off or piling on clothes just isn’t getting the job done.
Soak Up Some Culture
Climate control keeps museum artifacts in tiptop condition; a happy side
effect is comfortable patrons. In particularly daunting weather, make a
day of it. The Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) is the size of a small town,
with multiple dining options, excellent shopping, and even a movie 
theater. The art’s pretty great, too. Take a tour, enjoy a meal, immerse
yourself in a particularly appealing gallery, and even go shopping. Before
you know it, the guards will be shooing you out. Wednesday, when the
museum is open for nearly 12 hours, is the best day to seek refuge from
bad weather. See Chapter 11.
Find a Secret (Indoor) Garden
The MFA (see preceding section) can be a bit overwhelming. A stone’s
throw away, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is home to a less
encyclopedic collection in an even more beautiful building. The pictur-
esque interior courtyard abounds with seasonal flowers and greenery
year-round, making it a peaceful refuge from both heat and cold. Here,
too, you can dine without leaving the premises and do a little shopping.
See Chapter 11.

Smell the Popcorn
The coldest place downtown is also one of the coolest. The AMC Loews
Boston Common movie theater, 175 Tremont St. (% 617-423-3499; T:
Boylston [Green Line]), is almost as big as an airport terminal — 19
screens — and almost as air-conditioned as the frozen-foods aisle of the
supermarket. Pick the summer blockbuster with the longest running
time, and don’t forget your sweater.
See the World
The Museum of Science and the New England Aquarium are fascinating
destinations that incorporate IMAX theaters. Before, during, or after a
visit to either institution’s main building, you can explore the natural
world in air-conditioned or heated comfort. The museum’s Mugar Omni
Theatre takes you everywhere from the bottom of the sea to the top of a
mountain (and if you’d rather explore outer space, the complex has a
planetarium, too). The Simons IMAX Theatre at the aquarium shows
both educational films and versions of Hollywood blockbusters that take
good advantage of the 3-D format. See Chapter 11.
Shop ’til You Drop
Newbury Street is a peerless shopping destination, with tons of unique
shops, but it’s also outdoors. In inclement weather, head a couple of
blocks away to the Shops at Prudential Center. Sure, it’s a mall, but it’s
a really nice one. When you’ve had enough, take the skybridge across
Huntington Avenue to even-more-upscale Copley Place. Between the
two shopping centers, you can easily spend half a day or longer out of
the elements. On the other side of the river, the CambridgeSide Galleria
mall is a reasonable alternative to the Back Bay’s retail megalopolis. See
Chapter 12.
Feel the Wind in Your Hair
On a hot day, sightseeing and whale-watching cruises can liberate you
from the steamy city. The water is cooler and breezier than the land
(except in winter), and even a quick trip can be delightfully refreshing.
You can spend as long as a half-day searching for whales or as little as
ten minutes on a ferry slicing across the Inner Harbor. The one-way fare
from Long Wharf (near the New England Aquarium) to the Charlestown
Navy Yard is $1.70. See Chapter 11.
Chapter 19: The Top Ten Things to Do in Bad Weather 263

Set Sail
The Charles River is cool and wet, too. If you have the time and the
money, head to Community Boating, 21 David Mugar Way, on the
Esplanade (% 617-523-1038; www.community-boating.org). Two 
days of unlimited use of the center’s watercraft (13- to 23-foot sailboats,
Windsurfers, and kayaks) costs $100. Steep, yes, but in the middle of a
crushing heat wave? Priceless.
Consider Pyromania
A blazing fire — in a fireplace, please — can be your best friend on
unseasonably cold days (and nights) in spring and fall, as well as the
depths of winter. The bar at the Taj Boston (the former Ritz-Carlton,
Boston) is home to perhaps the most famous fireplace in the city. Across
the river, Grendel’s Den, a longtime Harvard Square favorite, is a cozy
bar with a just-off-the-slopes atmosphere; order fondue to preserve the
illusion.
Try Bibliomania, Too
Bibliomania is an obsession with books, which is a roundabout way of
suggesting that you seek out a branch of the Boston Public Library
(www.bpl.org). All are climate controlled and offer comfortable seating.
The main branch, in Copley Square, also has a cool courtyard and pass-
able restrooms.
Get Out of Town
After a few days of 90-plus days and 70-plus nights, Boston’s brick side-
walks start to feel like the walls of a brick pizza oven. When you just
can’t take it anymore, head to the beach. You don’t even have to drive —
the MBTA (% 800-392-6100 or 617-222-3200; www.mbta.com) stops so
close to the Atlantic that you can smell the salt water. The cheapest 
road trip is actually by subway: Take the Blue Line to Revere Beach or
Wonderland, cross Revere Beach Boulevard, and wriggle your tootsies 
in the sand of Revere Beach. For a less urban experience, ride the com-
muter rail to Manchester-by-the-Sea. The three-quarter-mile walk to gor-
geous Singing Beach isn’t much fun in the midst of a summer scorcher,
but it’s well worth the effort.

Internet Access and Cybercafes
Wireless access, often free, is widely
available at businesses throughout Boston
and Cambridge and even at some public
parks in Boston. A good directory is at
www.bostonwag.org/projects/
hotspots.php. If you’re traveling with-
out a wireless-enabled computer, FedEx
Kinko’s offers pay-as-you-go Internet
access at its numerous locations, includ-

Liquor Laws
The legal drinking age is 21. Always be
ready to show identification. At sporting
events, everyone buying alcohol must
show ID. Liquor stores and a few super-
markets and convenience stores sell alco-
hol. Sunday alcohol sales, which only
recently became legal, begin at noon. 
Boston For Dummies, 4th Edition 
266

Some smaller restaurants don’t have full
liquor licenses; they serve wine and beer
or wine, beer, and cordials, but no hard
liquor. If you must have a mixed drink, ask
when you make your reservations.
Maps
Pick up a map at any visitor information
center (see Chapter 8 for more informa-
tion), at most hotels, and from the clerks in
most T stations.
Pharmacies
Nearly every neighborhood has a CVS; ask
at your hotel’s front desk. Downtown
Boston has no 24-hour drugstore. The CVS
in the Porter Square Shopping Center, off
Mass. Ave. in Cambridge (% 617-876-
5519), is open 24 hours, 7 days a week. The
pharmacy at the CVS at 155–157 Charles
St. in Boston (% 617-523-1028), next to the
Charles/MGH Red Line T stop, is open until
midnight. Some emergency rooms can 
fill your prescription at the hospital’s 
pharmacy.
Police
Call % 911 for emergencies. Dialing 911
on a cellphone connects you to the state
police; to reach the Boston police in an
emergency, call % 617-343-4911. The non-
emergency number is % 617-343-4200.
Post Office
The main post office at 25 Dorchester Ave.
(% 617-654-5302), behind South Station, is
open 24 hours, 7 days a week (subject to
change depending on budget constraints).
Neighborhood post offices typically are
open weekdays 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday 
8 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Radio Stations
WBUR-FM, 90.9, is the local National Public
Radio affiliate. WBZ-AM, 1030, carries news,
sports, and weather, with traffic reports
every ten minutes on weekdays. The local
sports talk station is WRKO-AM 850.
Restrooms
The visitor center at 15 State St. has a
public restroom, as do most tourist attrac-
tions, hotels, department stores, and public
buildings. The CambridgeSide Galleria,
Copley Place, and Prudential Center shop-
ping areas, most Starbucks locations, and
most large chain bookstores have rest-
rooms. Freestanding self-cleaning toilets
(25¢) are in several high-traffic areas
downtown. Inspect these facilities care-
fully before using them — the generous
time limit makes some of the toilets popu-
lar with IV-drug users. If you’re walking the
Freedom Trail, especially with children, be
sure to use the restrooms at Faneuil Hall
Marketplace before venturing into the
North End, which has no public facilities.
Safety
Boston and Cambridge are generally safe
for walking. As in any city, stay out of parks
(including the Esplanade) at night, unless
you’re in a crowd. Use common sense:
Walk confidently; try not to use ATMs at
night; avoid dark, deserted streets.
Specific areas to avoid at night include
Boylston Street between Tremont and
Washington streets, and Tremont Street
from Stuart to Boylston street. Watch your
step near the Big Dig aftermath (that is,
most of downtown), where walking 
surfaces can be uneven and lighting is
often poor. Public transportation in the
areas you’re likely to visit is busy and 
safe, but you should always watch out for
pickpockets.
Smoking
State law forbids smoking in all work-
places, including restaurants, nightclubs,
and bars. An unfortunate consequence is
Appendix: Quick Concierge 267

that outdoor seating areas at restaurants
and bars tend to be extremely smoky.
Taxes
The 5 percent state sales tax doesn’t apply
to food, prescription drugs, newspapers, or
clothing priced less than $175. The state
meal tax (which also applies to takeout
food) is 5 percent. The lodging tax is 12.45
percent in Boston and Cambridge.
Taxis
To call ahead in Boston, try the
Independent Taxi Operators Association
(% 617-426-8700), Boston Cab (% 617-
536-5010), Town Taxi (% 617-536-5000), or
Metro Cab (% 617-782-5500). In Cam-
bridge, call Ambassador Brattle (% 617-
492-1100) or Yellow Cab (% 617-547-3000).

Where to Get More Information
Local tourist information offices
 The Cambridge Office for Tourism (% 800-862-5678 or 617-441-
2884; www.cambridge-usa.org; 4 Brattle St., Cambridge, MA
02138) provides a free guide to Boston’s “Left Bank.”
 The Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau (% 888-
SEE-BOSTON or 617-536-4100; www.bostonusa.com; 2 Copley
Place, Suite 105, Boston, MA 02116-6501) offers a comprehensive
visitor information kit for $10.25. The kit includes a travel plan-
ner, guidebook, map, and coupon book with shopping, dining,
attractions, and nightlife discounts. The “Kids Love Boston”
guidebook costs $5. Smaller guides to specific seasons or events
often are available free.
 Massachusetts Office of Travel & Tourism (% 800-227-6277 or
617-973-8500; www.massvacation.com; 10 Park Plaza, Suite 4510,
Boston, MA 02116) gives away the Getaway Guide magazine,
which includes information about attractions and lodgings, a
map, and a seasonal calendar. Because this office covers travel
and tourism for the whole state, it distributes less Boston-
specific material than the Convention & Visitors Bureau. But 
the information is still useful (and free!).
Newspapers and magazines
 Boston.com (www.boston.com), the Boston Globe’s city guide, is
the most complete and up-to-date resource around, with every-
thing from weather forecasts to movie reviews, plus enough
links and listings to keep you busy for hours.
 The Boston Phoenix (www.bostonphoenix.com), Boston’s
alternative weekly, offers abundant arts and entertainment cov-
erage (listings and reviews), plus excellent listings for the gay,
lesbian, and bisexual community.
 Boston magazine (www.bostonmagazine.com) is a slick
monthly that covers the arts, entertainment, and politics; gives
the annual Best of Boston awards; and runs the city’s best
money-is-no-object ads.
Other sources of information
 Frommer’s Boston gives a comprehensive look at “the Hub,”
with more hotel, restaurant, and attraction listings than this
book can accommodate. I have this on very good authority: 
The author wishes you well.
Appendix: Quick Concierge 271

 Frommer’s Boston Day by Day is a portable, full-color guide
that helps you plan your visit by suggesting itineraries and walk-
ing tours for diverse interests and schedules. It’s loaded with
maps and photos.
 Frommer’s New England is the perfect accessory on a multiple-
state or -city visit to this appealing region.
 Frommers.com (www.frommers.com) posts online updates to
Frommer’s books, as well as up-to-date deals and news, trip
ideas, and message boards where you can ask and answer 
questions.
 Citysearch.com (http://boston.citysearch.com) contains
copious lifestyle and entertainment listings, including restaurant
reviews.
 The Massachusetts Port Authority (www.massport.com), which
runs the airport, constantly updates this site with the latest
weather and air-traffic information. The visitor-information area
includes many useful links.
 Mayor’s Food Court (from www.cityofboston.gov, navigate to
the Inspectional Services Department page) offers results of
restaurant inspections (and reinspections), with pop-up win-
dows that explain the regulations. Gross, but addictive.
