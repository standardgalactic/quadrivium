SHOPPING FOR SOFTWARE? LOOK NO
further than these pages. This month it
seems as if there's never been a wider
choice of program available and you have
to congratulate the software houses in the
ingenuity of their staff.
Ariolasoft info
Ariolasoft is making headlines and movies
this month. Did you ever think that you
could play at being Steven Spielberg
with the aid of your C64? Movie Maker
allows you to do just that. You can create
your own animated pictures with the aid
of this program. You probably won't
make as much money as the great
directors but you should have some fun.
Claims for the program include:
mixing text and graphics, creating tracks
of up to 30 frame each, and combining six
of these in a single animated sequence.
There are also hundreds of built in
pictures, ready for use plus the power to
create your own. There are numerous
animated greetings cards and a music and
sound library. You can videotape your
efforts and bore your friends with them -
if you feel that way inclined.
It's on twin disks and costs E16.95.
Two other newies from this Covent
Garden based house- they've just moved
- a r e  Starship Andromeda a nd
Panzadrome.
The latter is a futuristic war game set
on a robot inhabited island. The Robots
are tanks and hostile, of course, and you
must build a better one in order to defeat
them. Look out for mines and mortars.
Panzadrome costs f8.95 and is a
product of the programming and design
skills of the Ramjam Corporation.
Starship Andromeda sees you battling
the evil tyrant Alana, who wears a crystal
around her neck which just happens to be
the security key to the great computer
which controls the galaxy. A  tough
situation - especially since the only thing
that will free the crystal is a Proton lance.
Get the lance and get the crystal. Easy,
huh?
The program includes 12 arcade/
strategy games and 10.000 locations. It's
also E9.95.
Not content with these launches,
Ariolasoft is entering the Amiga software
market with a collection of Electronic
Arts' utilities.
Deluxepaint is an incredible graphics
program which allows the beginner to
explore the Amiga's capabilities whilst
giving the more experienced user an
excellent tool. Features include tools to
create lines, curves, shapes and textures.
There's also split screen zoom enlarging
and colour cycling to create animation.
DeluxePrint is a sister program with 15
formats for easy customisation of print
outs - in colour or black and white. The
formats include greetings cards, business
cards, stationary, calendars, letterheads,
• • sters and many more.
A6 Amiga range from Ariolasoft
Ariolasoll, Electronic Arts and the Amiga

N e w s
DeluxeVideo brings another
dimension to computing. Make video
slide shows, animation, business present-
ations. Find out about wipes, fades, and
dissolves. Also compression of images,
control of the foreground and back-
ground and much more.
Ariolasoft's Ashley Gray said: "The
Deluxe series of Amiga programs are the
most powerful, integrated, creative tools
ever released for a personal computer."
Maybe you should try them when
you've saved up for your Amiga?
Activision — Out of Time?
WANTED -  DEAD OR  ALIVE! SAM
Harlow, that's you, a marked man. Your
past has caught up with you, punk.
They're out to get your - but you don't
know who they are. Check your ﬁles, Sam,
you need to prevent your own murder,
and it's one of those bums who you've put
away behind bars during your auspicious
career.
Interested? Activision's latest
adventure - Borrowed Time - puts you in
the position of both hunter and prey.
There are 20 serious suspects who are out
of your blood. Track the murderer down
before it's too late.
Perils including getting shot at,
burned, anaesthetised, beaten up, strung
up, sentenced t o life imprisonment,
bopped on the head, ripped to pieces by
mad dogs etc.
If you've got £14.99 and want to die
horribly then you know how to spend it.
And the Rest
IF YOU'RE AN AVID WATCHER OF NOEL
Edmond's ridiculous Late Late Breakfast
Show, then you'll know the background
to Mr Puniverse. Now Mastertronic has
jumped on the bandwagon yet again to
bring you Big Mac - 2 which features the
character immortalised in this hilarious TV
spoof. It's on the C-16 and is in the £1.99
range of course.
Halley's Comet fever has now hit the
software industry with a release from
Firebird to mark the approach of the
space probe Giotto to the heart of the
comet.
It's one of those games in which, once
again, you play the part of an intrepid
spaceman coming to the aird of the entire
human race. This time the danger involves
germ bags from the comet which are
threatening the health of the world.
The game has three phases starting
with the launch, followed by controlling
the ship's computer in its ﬂight to the
comet (the spaceman is in suspended
animation at this point), and ﬁnally the
destruction of the germbags so that they
won't reproduce and infect the globe.
f 7.95 on the CM, and available now.
Rino Software is taking the bull by the
horns in its decision to call a spade a spade
- or more accurately a shoot 'em up a
shoot 'em up.
The Astron integrated Circuit Card
5
Gone are the days when zappy games
had zappy names. Rino's new release is
for the CM, priced at £2.99 and is
unabashedly entitled Shoot 'Em Up.
Generally Speaking
IN THIS HIGHLY TECHNOLOGICAL BUS-
iness, the Japanese are still the people
who are often ﬁrst with the newest ideas.
Now Cumana has brought another
Japanese invention to this country in the
form of the Astron IC card.
Physically, the card resembles a credit
card but contains integrated circuitry
which enables it to be used as a solid state
memory device. It has a 38 pin connector
which plugs into a cheap (about E2) socket
and does not need a magnetic or laser
reader.
There are four different types of card:
ROM, Masked ROM, EPROM and RAM.
AMMO M I N
•  s i o e t  tam  gams
•  s e e  t h e  t o t e h r l a l
Cumana claims that they are totally
reliable and durable and are unaffected
by electromagnetic/electrostatic condi-
tions, extreme temperatures, humidity
and minor scratches. It is also an added
protection against software piracy.
Adaptors for the cards will be available
for the CM and C128.
Cumana has proposed a  host of
applications for the new card: Memory
for telecommunication devices; identiﬁ-
cation for security keys, bank accounts,
computer input and cashless shopping;
speech for vending machines, language
labs, measuring and sensing warning
devices; instructions for robots and other
automated equipment; personal identity;
applications and ROM software; portable
memory f or  hand he ld micros,
programmable printers, process control,
alarm systems. And this is only the tip of
the iceberg. Look out for them.

Mike Mahoney and Tony Crowther
After an absence of two years, Games
programmer Tony Crowther has returned
to Alligata software and as you can see
from the picture he seems to be having
quite a good time there already.
Because o f  this new arrangement
Alligata is promising some exciting
releases in the near future.
If you've bought an  A'n'F game
recently or in the past then a new service
is being offered to you by the company to
help you out with any problems which
you may have run into.
A new mail order and queries line has
been established which will provide a 24
hour service. The number is Rochdale (0706)
341111. There's also been an announce-
ment from A'n'F that a  new arcade
adventure is in  the pipeline at  the
moment. We'll bring you more news on
that as soon as we have it.
A company called Mupados has come
up with an original idea. It has launched a
software/audio cassette. I t  combines
theme tunes in 'full, fantastic stereo'
dance mix from some popular games -
namely Rambo, Neverending Story,
Ghostbusters, Crazy Comets and Hyper-
sports - with a database called Softwhere?
which should help you organise a
reference system for your programs,
games, or record collection.
The idea behind it is apparently to
combine the purely functional with pure
entertainment. Whether the punters will
think this worthwhile is another question
but at 14.99 from W H Smiths it may be
worth a shot.
On Line
MICRONET USERS HAVE RALLIED
round and forked out to make the lives of
some disabled young people a lot easier.
A user called Jon Bye, who became
non-vocal as the result of an accident
several years ago, let Micronet know, via
mailbox, that communications services
had made an incredible difference to his
life.
His comments created a lot of interest
amongst other users. John lives at Hatch-
ford Park School in Guildford and an
appeal put up on Micronet to raise f 300
for 10 other non-vocal residents was
greeted with a fantastic response.
Not only did members donate over
1350 in 24 hours, but also Keith Rose of
Modem House offered all the required
modems free.
Rick Wakeman tackles Commodore's Music System
*Ales' •?'"
Hard Lines
COMMODORE 128 OWNERS WH O
have had trouble ﬁnding a  suitable
monitor for their computer (other than
Commodore's own product) could ﬁnd
that Cascade has come to their aid.
The RGBI output of the 128 is incomp-
atible with the majority of monitors on the
market. Commodore's 1901 monitor is
expensive and peoplewho already own a
Microvitec probably feel that this is a high
price to pay.
Cascade has come up with an interface
which provides a full RGB 80 column
display via the RGB TTI input. Microvitec
1431 dual mode monitor can now provide
full 40 column composite video and 80
column RGB with simple switching
between modes, thus allowing full use of
the 128's three operating modes.
At 119.95 it could be a worthwhile
investment.
Musical computer owners will b e
tempted by Commodore's new Complete
Music System. It costs 1330 including a
C64 and the Music Expansion system
priced at 1149.99 for those who already
own a C64 or C128, contains everything
needed t o  produce music which is
normally only possible on expensive syn-
thesisers. Or so Commodore claims.
Launched at the Ideal Home Exhibi-
tion the products should be in your local
shop now.

In the ﬁrst of a new
series, Eric Doyle
introduces you to the
secret of your
Commodore's
memory.
WE ALL TAKE THE CHIPS IN-
side our computers for granted
but a greater understanding of
them c a n  le a d  t o  better
programs. Over the next few
months I hope to clarify the A n o t h e r  difference is that
function of each chip and to RO M is  a  permanent, non-
reveal the inner workings and volatile store which cannot be
hidden secrets of the Comma- erased by turning the power on
dare range of computers: the and off but RAM is volatile and
Vic 20, C64, C-16, Plus/4 and its  contents disappear when
C126. 
t
h
e
 computer is switched off.
The heart of any computer R O M  is  where the Basic
is the central processor and the operating system is stored and
most common application of at power up it reserves certain
the computer is to run Basic parts of RAM for storing the
programs so this is where our transient values generated as its
Odyssey will begin, r o u t i n e s  are executed.
The microprocessor i n
Commodore micros is a one of
several derivatives o f  t h e
Motorola 6500 series micro-
chip. This processor is  the
number cruncher inside which
are the registers that assist in all
of t h e  computer's mathe-
matical operations. Diagram 1
shows the basic architecture of
all 6500 range microprocessors.
As far as the processor is
concerned the whole of the
computer memory is an exten-
sion o f  its elf f r o m  whic h
numerical values can be loaded
(read) or sent (written).
A good way of imagining
memory is as a large, pigeon
hole internal mailing system.
Each box represents a byte of
memory and can contain a
value from zero to 255. Don't
worry if you don't know how
computers deal with numbers
larger than 255, all will become
clear later.
Memory comes i n  t w o
varieties Read Only Memory
(ROM) and Random Access
Memory (RAM). As the name
implies ROM can only be read
from but RAM can either be
read from or written to if it is
necessary to change its value.
For example variables deﬁned
by a Basic program must be
stored in RAM for two reasons.
Firstly, because it must have a
value written to it to start with
and, secondly, because that
value may change later on in
the program.

Load and run Listing 1 to see
how the processor operates.
The program counter tells
the processor w her e t h e
current instruction is located in
RAM/ROM memory. When
commanded to execute a piece
of machine code, the current
value of the program counter is
stored in  a  special reserved
area o f  RAM memory (the
processor stack area) and the
internal stack pointer is ad-
justed to point to the next free
location in the stack. The start
address of the new machine
code routine is then placed
into the counter. This value is
then loaded into the address
buffer which directs the data
bus to the correct location.
The data bus copies the
information found in the given
location and carries this back to
the processor which is expect-
ing a machine code operator.
When this is evaluated in the
instruction decoder it deter-
mines whether an operand or
two will follow. Depending on
the ty pe o f  operator, any
operands are evaluated and
stored in the X or Y register or
in the accumulator,
If the operator is a ﬁnite
address the address buffer is
given this value and the data
bus reacts accordingly. If the
value is an offset address, the
ﬁnite address has the value of
the X or Y register added to it
and this value is passed to the
address buffer.
All mathematical work is
performed in the ALL,' which
can access all of the registers
which merely act as passive
stores for transient values.
The instruction decoder
determines whether the data
bus is reading or writing its
encoded infor mation a n d
which i n t e r n a l  r e g is t e r
provides o r  ac c epts  t h e
information.
When an RTS command is
detected the last value to be
stored on the stack is read into
the program counter and the
processor c ontinues  f r o m
where it  was before it  was
asked to execute the routine.
I have said that the proces-
sor only responds to machine
code routines so how does it
respond to Basic?

M e m o r y
Down to Basics
When t h e  c o m p u t e r  i s
switched o n  t h e  program
counter automatically loads
the value i t  ﬁnds at VFW,
which causes the processor to
run the ROM machine code
routine for power reset. This
organises the memory ready
for Basic and ends by printing
READY o n  the screen_ The
routine then loops  around
until k r a v h o 3 r d  in p u t  is
After typing in or loading a
program, the command RUN
brings t h e  Basic execution
system in t o  operation. T o
understand how this works we
have t o  look  at the way a
program is stored in memory.
Now enter Listing 2 to reveal
the structure of a line of Basic.
The program PEEKs t h e
program storage area and
writes the actual contents of
the memory locations to the
screen. The ﬁrst screenful of
information shows t h e  ﬁrst
three lines. Notice how all the
lines end with a  zero byte
which causes t he operating
system to start a new line when
LISTing t o  the screen o r  a
printer.
The ﬁrst four bytes of infor-
mation have been coloured to
highlight their special signif-
icance. The yellow pair of bytes
gives the line number. Their
actual value can be revealed in
the following way:
i) Write down the ﬁrst of the
two bytes and then write the
second byte after it (e.g. 2C
01 becomes 012C).
ii) This i s  t h e  hexadecimal
value of the line number_ To
convert it to decimal multi-
ply the ﬁrst ﬁgure by 4096,
the second by 256, third by
16 and the fourth by one_
Then add the new values
together. e. g.  (0'4096) +
(1*256)+(2*161+(12*1)=300)
Remember that A=10. B=-11
etc_
The cyan coloured ﬁgures
also reveal a two byte number
in t h e  same way  b u t  this

this note tht the green ﬁgures
are tokenised keywords. Yes, a
word like PRINT is converted
into a single ﬁgure when the
line is encoded but a variable
such as SB would occupy two
bytes corresponding t o  the
CHR$ ( or  ASCII) values for
each letter.
Another point worthy o f
note i s  t h a t  a r it h m e t ic
operators have a value which is
at variance with their ASCII
values. When words such as
PRINT or arithmetic signs are
used within quotes they are not
given their special status and
are just evaluated as normal
ASCII characters.
Slow Motion
Now back to the question of
how a program RUNs.
First o f  all the operating
system causes the processor to
check if there is a program in
memory. If the ﬁrst two bytes of
user RAM have a value then the
system assumes a program is in
residence. These two bytes are
assumed to be a line link and
are stored away for reference.
The whole line up to the link
location is copied into a special
area of memory for analysis.
This is the Basic buffer. Simil-
arly the line number bytes are
stowed away  elsewhere i n
RAM.
After the line number the
system expects t o  ﬁn d  a
command of some sort. Evalua-
tion of the token value repre-
s enting t h e  c o m m a n d
(reserved word) is found by
storing t h e  v alue i n  t h e
processor's accumulator and
ornparing this value with a list
of values stored in Basic ROM.
It no match is found the line is
scanned i n  t h e  buffer b y
sequentially loading each byte
into the accumulator to see if
there is an equals sign. The
system is also comparing the
accumulator's value with the
token v alues  o f  v ar ious
punctuation marks or looking
for the end-of-line zero byte. If
one of these is found instead of
the equals sign an error is
signaled_
When such an error is indic-
ated a SYNTAX ERROR IN LINE
message is  printed o n  t h e
screen by loading each letter
into t h e  accumulator a n d
moving it into screen display
RAM. Next, the line number
stored in RAM is dragged out,
converted into a decimal value
and printed after the message.
If the system has detected a

M e m o r y
variable being created it checks
the syntax of the variable name.
Then an area of RAM is used to
store the value along with the
variable name.
If a reserved word has been
found the position of the token
value i n  t h e  R O M  l i s t
determines where the program
jumps to in the Basic ROM to
verify the correct syntax of any
characters which follow the
word until a colon or zero byte
is discovered, For example, if
the line was PRINT "HELLO",
the PRINT token would be 99
Hex, The system would then
expect a  variable name, a
quotation mark, a colon or a
zero. I n  this case it ﬁnds a
space. which is ignored, fol-
lowed by  a quotation mark.
The system then takes the
ASCII code from between the
quotes one by one. The ASCII is
converted into a screen POKE
value and this places the letters
which spell HELLO on the next
available screen location.
When the end of a line is
found the line link is retrieved
from memory and the next line
link is stored along with the
new line number. The line is
then copied int o the Basic
buffer and the line is scanned
and interpreted as before.
This process continues until
there are no more lines left or
an END or STOP command is
located.
Obviously w it h  a l l  this
memory movement, evalua-
tion and syntax checking going
on the program runs a lot more
slowly than a pure machine
code p r o g r a m  w r i t t e n
speciﬁcally to create the same
effect but it should be remem-
bered that all programs are
executed by the microproces-
sor in machine code, Basic is
only a ﬁgment of the ROM's
memory. When a  language
such as Logo or Pascal is loaded
the Basic ROM is switched out
in favour of the new machine
code routines which interpret
the syntax of the new language.

great care is taken.

the insides of the
Commodore Amiga.
Whenever t h e  w o r d  ' A m i g a '  i s
mentioned, s o m e o n e  w i l l  h a v e
something to say about Commodore's
wonder-baby. At ﬁrst all that was said was
how wonderful this machine was, and
how it would take the world by storm;
gradually, however, people saw the Atari
520ST, at less than half the price — and
started wondering.
I have owned an Amiga for nearly six
months now, and in that time I think it is
safe to say that I have formed a very
personal view about a machine which, if
used to its potential, can really show the
true power of a personal computer.
What makes the Amiga so different
from all the other personal computers is
its sheer versatility. Being a true multi-
tasking machine means that it can do
almost as  many things as y ou want
simultaneously, enabling you t o jump
from o n e  task t o  another with the
knowledge that all the other tasks will
continue.
Hardware
To successfully explain the Amiga you
must really s plit t he hardware int o
different s ec tions ; s pec iﬁc ation,
workbench, graphics, s ound, a n d
peripherals. Although this cannot cover
everything to do with the Amiga, it should
give y ou a  valuable insight into this
machine.
Speciﬁcation
The speciﬁcation given here is of the
American Amiga, when launched i n
Europe it will probably come with two
disk drives and 512K as standard.
Basically the components of the Amiga
are:
Motorola M C  68000 16/32 b it  main
processor.
256K bytes of internal RAM, expandable
to 512K,
256K bytes of ROM containing a real-
time, multi-tasking, operating system with
sound, graphics and animation routines.
Built in 3 "  double sided disk drive.
Expansion port for up to 3 external disk
drives with either 3
sided.
Fully programmable serial port.
Fully programmable parallel port.
Two button mechanical mouse.
Two 9 pin D type controller ports.
Detached 89-key keyboard with numeric
keypad, 10 function keys and cursor
section.
Ports for analog or digital RGB output, as
well as composite video.
Workbench
Left and right stereo audio output ports.
Expansion connector that allows you to
add R A M ,  h a r d  dis k s , o r  o t h e r
peripherals.
At present, to start up an Amiga system,
you must ﬁrst insert a disk that loads the
operating system into write-protected
RAM. Although this does take time, it
means that in the future, when new
versions are released, you will not have to
mess about switching chips around.
Having done this you will be requested to
insert what is called a Workbench disk.
This is the program that makes the Amiga
so easy to use, and enables a complete
beginner t o  s tar t harnessing t h e
machine's power.
Once in the Workbench, most people
will im m e d ia t e ly  r ec ognis e t h e
Macintosh-esque windows and icons,
however this time they are in colour!
Workbench is  provided for  two real
reasons; ﬁrstly it lets you control the
computer's functions via a mouse, and
secondly it lets each individual owner
customise his Amiga. Using a program
called Preferences, you can choose the
colour o f  tex t, t h e  c olour o f  t h e
background, how sensite you want the
mouse to be, and also redeﬁne the cursor
which indicates the mouse position. On
the more technical side, Preferences
allows you to set baud rates, and redeﬁne
the bit images required for your printer.
The Wor k benc h s c reen, w h e n
operated, displays one large window,
within which are a variety of draws, On
selecting a draw with the mouse, a new
window will appear, giving you another
selection of Icons to choose from. Icons
can best be described as small pictures
which appear on the screen representing;
tools, projects, disks, draws and t he
Trashcan. Windows le t  y ou see t he
contents of projects, drawers, disks, and
the Trashcan. Windows can be altered
both in size and position.
On t h e  c urrent version o f  t h e
Workbench disk (v1.1) there are four
draws — Demos, Utilities, System and

the detailed stor
Empty. Demos  a r e  thr ee different
programs which show well how efﬁcient a
multi-tasker, the Amiga really is, Utilities
gives you an on-screen calculator and
notepad, a la Mac, and System prod uces a
disk copier. The Empty draw allows you to
create a personal ﬁle for the Workbench
disk.
To make the most of the system, it is
preferable t o  c r eat e y o u r  o w n
Workbench disk t o  suit the type o f
application you will be running, I, for
instance, would rather use the keyboard
than the mouse, and have my Workbench
set up accordingly.
Graphics
If one feature makes the Amiga stand out
in a crowd more than any other it has to be
the graphics. What makes this, and the
sound, so outstanding are the three
dedicated chips designed by Jay Miner,
founder o f  Amiga.  Thes e c hips ,
affectionately called AGN US, DENISE,
and PAULA, effectively allow the main
CPU to do other things while they take on
speciﬁc roles, such as controlling graphics
and sound.
In exact terms, the Amiga has four
resolutions; 320 * 200, 320 * 400,640 • 200,
and 640 • 400. However, the two modes
that involve the use of 400 vertical pixels
are more difﬁcult to control as it requires
a special feature called Interlacing. This
allows the programmer t o  utilise the
unused spaces to double the vertical
resolution.
In each different mode you also have
different amounts of available colours. In
total the Amiga has a palette of 4096
colours, and in low-resolution you can
put up to 32 different colours onscreen at
once. However, the higher resolution
modes h a v e correspondingly les s
available colours. One clever trick that
can be used in certain situations however
is called HAM (Hold And Modify). This
method allows all 4096 colours to be
displayed o n  screen simultaneously,
while only sacriﬁcing 48K. By producing
this quality of colour resolution you can
produce pictures of a standard as yet
unsurpassed on a personal computer.
One word that will be recognisable to
almost all of you is sprites. The Amiga can
cope with up to eight sprites on screen at
once, each of which can be as tall as is
required, although only 16 pixels across.
For animation purposes the Amiga also
has something called a  Blitter (Block
Image Transferrer), and although this is by
no means limited to graphics, it can be
used to move large amounts of graphics
data around t h e  screen a t  amazing
speeds, creating s ome outstanding
effects.
It is features such as the colour palette,
as well as the Blitter, that make it obvious
what potential the Amiga has as a graphics
machine.
Sound
To complement the Amiga's graphics, it
comes with a dazzling potential for sound
generation. Controlled by the Paula chip,
it can produce stereo output through the
left and r ight external sockets, and
without too much difﬁculty, can produce
sounds to rival some more expensive
synthesisers.
The Amiga provide5 the user with four
separate sound channels, each of which
can be used to carry a wide range of
sounds, they  d o  n o t  hav e t o  b e
monophonic. By  using digital sounds
and envelopes, the Amiga is quite capable
of producing sounds which have been
sampled, and then converted t o  the
correct format, only to reproduce them
perfectly later.
As well as producing excellent quality
sound, the standard Amiga can produce
quite breathtaking speech, simply by
using simple commands, thus narrating
software packages are no longer a thing of
the past!
Peripherals
If you want a machine that will grow as a
system, then the Amiga certainly has the
potential. With its plethora of ports (I), it
should be possible to interface almost
anything to this machine, with the right
software,
Printers are well provided for in the
Preferences program, with most popular
makes s u c h  a s  Ep s o n ,  D i a b l o ,
Commodore, and others a ll having
software alr eady  w r it t en t o  t a k e
advantage of the graphics,
Modems too are easy to rig up, with a
totally programmable serial port, it should
just be a question of plug in and go. I am
currently running a 1200 baud modem
with no troubles.
Conclusion
Although I have only managed to touch
the surface of what the Amiga is really
capable of, it is clear to me that, lilt  is
marketed properly, this machine could
succeed by creating a market, rather than
ﬁtting in as a run of the mill PC,that would
be a real shame!

Gareth Thomas brings
you your own type-in
C64 Database.
The Mic Loader
MICROFILE64 IS A COMPLETE
database c r e a t i o n  a n d
management system for  the
C64. It consists of a suite of
three programs, t h e  ﬁr s t
program is mainly a machine
code loader but it also carries
out 'once only' operations such
as setting up the SID and VIC
chips etc. for the main pro-
grams, and then auto-runs the
management program. T he
management program consists
of shell-metzner sorting rou-
tines, a  very powerful data
search and edit system and a
unique data access method for
tape a n d  dis k . T h e  t h ir d
program is the format program,
this allows the user to design a
complete screen layout for the
input of data using any of the
available colours, rvs video,
graphics characters and even
the fullscreen editing facilities
of the 64. Then by using a sprite
cursor and an overlayed pop-
up me n u ,  i t  deﬁnes  t h e
parameters affecting each of
the ﬁelds i.e. length. datatype,
input position and name.
The mic  is placed above
Basic in the 4K block at SC000
from $CA43 t o  SCAC5. So
taking no Basic memory. The
m/c is wedged between the
stored screen deﬁnition which
is split into two; the screen
memory from $C000 and the
colour 'memory from SCCO5
using mic  routines the screen
can b e  stored and recalled
instantly for updating the ﬁle.
Being stored i n  this  block
means that over 28.5K is free for
data. This is allocated to 200
records of up to nine ﬁelds
each one being allowed a maxi-
mum length of 255 characters
this number of records could
easily be altered up to two or
three times more and although
the maximum ﬁeld length is 255
this would probably never be
used and is set at this to impose
no constraints on the user.
Since string storage is dynamic,
the ﬁeld length could be set to
this a n d  i t  w o u l d  n o t
immediately be allocated 255
bytes. Details on how to extend
the program will be given later
in the documentation).
The leader itself stores 5
m/c routines. They are:

Basic input routine and use the
full cursor editing. This has
three purposes: t o  stop the
cursor scrolling the screen by
denying it access to the top and
bottom lines; de-activate the
colon and comma keys while
allowing their  shifted, c on-
trolled and CBM functions to
be registered: allows  t h e
INPUT routine to be exited by
pressing function keys as well
as RETURN.
2. I nput routine  ( S C A M  -
SCB43): This routine simulates
the Basic input routine but
improves on it by adding: the
ability to preset the maximum
number o f  characters t o  be
entered; allowing only certain
data to be entered which can
be preset and can be of four
types -  alphanumeric, digit.
numeric o r  f o r  any  other
numeric data being entered it
is possible to specify a part-
icular amount i.e. less than„
greater than or between.
3. Cursor. AT(SCB46 - SCB72):
this simulates the PRINT AT
command found in many other
Basics. It uses the kernal PLOT
routine at SHFCland a few Basic
ROM calls to allow parameter
passing of the row and column
positions from the SYS call.
4. Screen sdlore (SCB73 -
SCBBB): This stores a copy of
the screen layout deﬁned by
the format program (except for
the top and bottom rows). It
stores the screen memory at
$CCO5, the colour memory at
SC000.
5. Screen recall (SCBBC -
SCC04): This recalls a copy of
the screen stored b y  t h e
routine above.
If you wish to use the system
on d is k  t h e n  t h e  t h r e e
programs must be saved under
the ﬁlenames  MF64.M/C,
MF64. MAIN and MF64. FORM
in order to maintain the com-

character. This gives a visual
representation o f  t h e  ﬁeld
length, but on the bottom line
is a count of the number of
characters. The cursor may be
moved until either a length of
255 is  reached, o r  another
character is  encountered i n
front o f  the cursor. RETURN
sets the length and DEL allows
you to move back the cursor.
The ﬁnal part of this section
of the program is typing in the
ﬁeld name. Y o u  w i l l  b e
prompted to do this on the
bottom line after deﬁning the
length. All the processes dis-
cussed t h e n  hav e t o  b e
repeated for each ﬁeld. As in
the pr ev ious  s ec tion f o r
deﬁning the screen layout, in
this section the function keys
have certain uses. They are; Fl
(Exit) returns bac k  t o  t h e
beginning of the program; F3
(Clear) homes the cursor and
resets the ﬁeld count to one; F5
(Back) allows you to go back
and redeﬁne the previous ﬁeld
if you made a mistake.
When y ou have ﬁnished
deﬁning t h e  database t h e
program will ask if you wish to
save the data to tape or disk. If
you choose tape remember to
take note of the tape count.
You must also wind the tape
back to the position of the main
program so that it can be auto-
run (of course on disk this is
automatic).
Management or Main
Program
When the main program has
auto-run, press any key to exit
the intro screen so that you are
then presented with the main
menu. In the top right of the
screen is printed the number of
empty records remaining i.e.
how many more records can be
input. Laid out below this are
the 10 main functions of the
management program which
can be accessed by  pressing
zero t o  n in e ,  Wh e n  t h e
program i s  ﬁrst r u n  only
options one and eight can be
selected s inc e n o  data is
present and also there is no
'format' where it can be held.
The formatting can be done
using option eight, which will
be described later, or option
one can be used to lead in a
format or any data.
To describe how to use the
program r il go through each
option in turn:
1 —  Press this  yields y et
another menu with ﬁve more
options all of which are really

C 6 4 / C 1 2 8
self-explanatory. When any of
these are selected you will be
asked to supply a ﬁlename. This
must be n o  longer than 16
characters. Typing 'E' will exit
to t h e  main menu. Before
describing other parts of DATA
I/O, I must ﬁrst describe the
unusual method in which the
program handles data ﬁles_
Files can be loaded/saved in
one o f  t w o  for ms  either
program data, i.e. the actual
records of data or the format
data. The format data takes a
while to load/save even with
disk since it is itself split into
two halves. Firstly, the format
parameters are saved i.e. ﬁeld
length, name etc, and then the
screen layout data which takes
the time to load. Saving the
data as two separate ﬁles may
sound strange but it creates a
very ﬂex ible system. F o r
example, i f  y ou select load
from tape and a  format is
already present ( if not then
pr ogr am a u t o m a t i c a l l y
assumes you wish t o load a
format), ﬁrstly, y ou will b e
prompted to enter the type of
ﬁle to be loaded: "Format or
data?". This means that if you
select data you can load in
different sets of data for the
same format, so it is possible to
create many data ﬁles from one
format ﬁle s o overcoming
memory limitations. I f  y ou
select format and load a new
format then the data present
will be erased and new data ﬁle
must be loaded.
If you try to load a ﬁle which
is data but you select format
when prompted the computer
will give an error message after
reading the ﬁle header and
return to the menu.
Note
The data I/O option cannot be
used to load a transfer ﬁle from
the format program. Option
eight must be used for this.
The next, option two, is
print ﬁle. I  have left this
unwritten since I  hav e n o
printer and also there are many
different types, but provision
has been made for  a  sub-
routine. If pressed the menu
will just be listed again. My
suggestion is  t o  place t he
subroutine starting at line 4200
which means the third line
number (30) i n  t h e  O N ...
GOSUB at line 35 must be
altered. To help you t h e  sir at
4005 will list all the records
found by a search. Also look at
the view option. Finally, the

array B$ holds the format data
and B$ 'ﬁeld number two)
contains the name of each ﬁeld
and records are held by AS in
the form A$ (ﬁeld number,
record number).
The third option Update-
allows the updating of the ﬁle
i.e. typing i n  new  records.
When pressed, the layout you
designed us ing t h e  format
program, should be displayed
rind a blue non-ﬂashing cursor
will be at the ﬁrst ﬁeld. Type in
the necessary data and press
RETURN to store and move to
the next ﬁeld, In the top right
hand corner,a number displays
the current record being typed
in, as usual the function keys
have been used which are also
displayed on the top line they
are: (Exit) will exit back to the
main menu, this will not update
the record counter and any
data that was typed for the
current record will be last: F3
(REDO) this allows the user to
retype the previous ﬁeld, while
deleting any data that has been
typed on the current ﬁeld; FS
(Memory) displays o n  t h e
bottom line the number of free
bytes remaining, this may take
a few seconds and is due to
FRE(0) and not to my program.
The number will remain on the
bottom line until any key is
pressed.
The fourth option - Edit- is
probably the most complex in
the program but has some very
powerful func tion. W h e n
pressed you are presented with
another menu. Again I will go
through these options in order
starting w i t h  Ed it .  A f t e r
selecting this and entering the
number of the record you wish
to edit, onc e entered, the
screen will display the record,
and the bottom line will list the
key function. The top right
shows t h e  record currently
being displayed us ing t h e
inequality keys ( <, >). You can
look at other records going
backwards/forwards and when
you have deﬁnitely found the
record y o u  wis h t o  edit,
pressing 'D ' will delete the
whole record, 'E' will exit back
to the menu or 'A' will allow
you to alter it. Selecting 'A'
changes the prompts on the
bottom and top lines and also
turns the data in the ﬁrst ﬁeld to
inverse video. Using the cursor
up/down key, you can select
the ﬁeld to alter when you have
it, pressing RETURN w i l l
change the prompts again for
the third and ﬁnal time asking
you to select the 'Edit option',
D will delete all the data in the

ﬁeld or ' 0 '  will allow you to
overwrite new data into it. If
you made a mistake selecting
theﬁeld,Ewill let you exit back
to choose another ﬁeld.
Next on the EDIT menu is
SEARCH and REPLACE.Thisisa
very powerful feature using
fully all the SEARCH routines in
the program. After selecting
the ﬁeld you wish to search,
type in the search data. The
String must be preﬁxed with
character t o  indicate which
type of search is to be done.
The sixdifferenttypesarelisted
at the top of the screen (for
information on these see the
documentation o n  f o r  t h e
search option).
If scan string is used it can
be made to insert data in a
number of records e.g. to insert
a middle name into MARK
ANTHONY you would type;
Search data ?@ANTHONY
Replac e d a t a ? AN D R EW
ANTHONY
The name ANDREW would
then b e  inserted a t  every
occurrence of this name, but
be careful since the routine
searches f o r  t h e  ﬁr s t
occurrence of the string within
a ﬁeld, Le. if you wanted to
insert my middle name DANIEL
into GARETH THOMAS you
could not use the shortened
version e.g.
Search data?@TH
Replace data?DANIEL TH
since t h e  result would b e
GAREDANIEL T H  THOMAS
because TH occurs twice in my
name, instead you would have
to type the whole e.g.
Search data?gTHOMAS
Replace data?DANIEL THOMAS
Search and Delete is similar
in operation and replace. If you
select any of the search options
apart from '@' scan string the
whole ﬁeld will be deleted.
Using scan string can enable
you to delete from inside a
string e.g. to delete my middle
name;
Search data? @ DANIEL
Note the space before DANIEL,
since otherwise t h e  result
would b e  CARETHTHOMAS
because t h e  n e w  string is
reassembled a r o u n d  t h e
position o f  the old one and
their are two spaces around the
old one.

For b o t h  e d i t  r elated
searches it  should be noted
that the ﬁrst occurrence of the
string is used and also that the
whole o f  !the ﬁle w ill b e
searched for the necessary data
even if one alteration is made.
The ﬁnal EDIT option is
Block Delete. This allows you to
delete large chunks of records
quickly, just enter the numbers
of the ﬁrst and last records to
be deleted and the program
will do the rest.
Now back t o  t h e  main
menu. Next is the view option
ﬁle. This is very simple, you can
either view one record (this
uses the format layout) or you
can select a record to start from
and scroll the whole ﬁle. If you
wish to view all the records,
holding down a key will cause
them to scroll down the screen.
If y ou release the k ey  the
records will pause. Pressing 'E'
will exit back to the start.
Sixth on the main menu is
the Search option. To make it as
fast a n d  easy a s  possible
information is entered about
the ﬁeld and search type in one
string e.g. to search ﬁeld three
comparing d ir e c t ly  a n d
searching for  LONDON y ou
would enter;
:MON DON
The computer will then tell
you how many records it ﬁnds
but it will not display them.
Instead the screen is set to its
original for m and y ou ar e
prompted for more data. The
next search done w ill n o t
search all the records but it will
search only these found by the
previous search, this means
that you can continually search
a dec reas ing n u m b e r  o f
records using different search
formats a n d  s o  narrowing
down the records to the few
you are looking for. This is a
very powerful feature if used
properly. Suppose a ﬁle was
created o f  n a m e s  a n d
addresses of people for a tennis
club, you might need to search
for all the people living in
BATH who play singles and
have a name beginning with A.
Let's suppose that ﬁeld one is
Name, two is Address and three
is type of player. You would
enter 2@BATH (need to scan
all of the address for the string
BATH)

If you do not wish to search
the records found b y  t h e
previous search then typing 'c'
will clear the records found
and allow you to search the
whole ﬁle again. This must be
typed before every search if it is
to be of the whole ﬁle. The
different searches are;
1. wildc ard - this isn't a true
wildcard since it only compares
the ﬁrst few letters of a string
i.e. typing l*SA will search ﬁeld
one for all strings starting with
SA.
2. c ompare directly -  this is
self-explanatory i t  compares
directly the whole string with
the whole o f  the ﬁeld Le.
2IEDINBURGH will search ﬁeld
two for any records containing
EDINBURGH, so in this case, if a
ﬁeld contained EDINBURGH
CASTLE, it would be ignored.
3, @ search string -  this will
search arthe data in a ﬁeld for
the occurrence of a string i.e.
2 @DE will search ﬁeld two for
any occurrence of DE so JADE
EVANS would turn up.
4. 5. and 6. -  these are the
inequalities and t h e  same
applies to all, with less than and
greater than it is less than or
greater then but NOT equal
to. Also the search can be
used for alphabetic as well as
numeric data i.e.'A'<
Next on the main menu is
seven - sort. The simplest of all
the options. Just enter the ﬁeld
to be sorted and the rest is
done automatically. The eighth
option is Format which when
selected will ﬁrst ask you if you
wish to load program or data.
The program is  the format
program, if 'p' is pressed this
will be loaded and auto-run
otherwise pressing 'd' will load
the transfer ﬁle of data 'format'
created by the format program.
Both these operations w ill
require (if you are using tape)
the winding of the tape to the
correct position. The program
will prompt you through all
this. So if you run the format
23
program by selecting 'p', then
design your format, and lead
the main program back in, you
will use 'd' to load the ﬁle saved
by the format program.
The penultimate option,
nine, is  new data, this will
prepare the program for new
data t o  be loaded or  for a
completely new ﬁle i.e. format
and data will be erased. When
this is selected you are asked
whether you wish to erase data
only or  data and deﬁntiions,
obviously i f  you select data
only the format will remain,
allowing you to load in another
data created under this format.
The ﬁnal option, 0, is to exit
the program, this uses the
KERNAL routine to completely
re-initialise the computer, so
be careful.
To ﬁnish, I  said i n  t he
section for the mic loader, that
the max number of records set
at 200 could easily be extended
to more. The lines that have to
altered are 9980 and 1800 - the
changes are obvious. It in the
event that the program should
lock up to an I/O  error or an
unforeseen bug should crash it
and CONT will not continue,
then GOTO 30 will return you
to the program data intact.
Note
Regarding t h e  us e o f  t h e
format ﬁle - the ﬁle stored by
the format program is only
used as a facility to transfer data
quickly across t o  t he main
program - a copy of the screen
is not saved as this takes a lot
longer and remains intac t
above Basic anyway, therefore
once you have the format ﬁle in
memory after using option
eight then remember to save a
full copy o f  the format i.e.
screen and deﬁnition data by
using option o n e  selecting
save, and pressing 'f' for format
when prompted t o  b y  t he
computer. This is a proper copy
of the format!

Runecaster delves once more
into the secrets of
adventuring.
AS W E  WATCH M AN Y SOFTWARE
houses striving to improve the graphics
which now illustrate most adventures, it is
interesting to talk to the actual players of
these modern-day marvels.
Whilst nearly everyone agrees that
swiftly drawn, colourful graphics can
always enhance the appearance of an ad-
venture. most of the players I have spoken
to recently, also go on to say that unless
the pictures have some relevance to the
game play, then the contents -  either
descriptive text and/or good puzzles - is
what really matters.
Following this is usually a discussion
on the attributes of the latest parsei
These too seem to become more complex
as time goes by, with longer and longer
sentences b e in g  under s tood a n d
actioned with astounding accuracy. But
do many players use these wonder-
workers? Most, it seems, tend to use the
least possible number o f  words and
letters. T h e  exception occurs when
repeating a set series of commands to get
to a previously attained position.
Interesting ain't it? Who are we all
trying to kid? Probably the only people to
gain from all this are the promoters of
programs -  you have to admit it sounds
better if you are advertising an all-singing,
all-dancing program. Then there is the
newcomer t o  adventures. I t  certainly
provides something to look at while trying
desperately to think about what to do
next!
Let us know what you think. And give
us some examples of what you like listed
in t h e  or der  o f  preference. Whilst
thinking about it, try playing a text only
adventure like The Secret of St Brides.
Back to School
St Brides is a real location and a real
school. Girls pay money to stay there but it
is no ordinary school. It is as though time
was stopped 50 years ago. The scenario is
straight out o f  those storybooks our
parents used t o  read, although this
adventure takes things a step further.
You play the part of a recently joined
'pupil', puzzled by the apparently total
belief of all the others, that the time is 1929
and not 1986. Your self-determined quest
is to ﬁnd out The Secret of St Brides.
The program has been around for
some time for the Spectrum but has only
recently been produced for the C64, It is a
Quill-based game and is not easy! There is
plenty of descriptive text and lots of things
to ﬁnd. The problem is working out what
to do with them.
There are two approaches to the game
- the basic one of tracking down what is
91ti
ss
kommoomE64
going on and also an additional one to
ﬁnd the Amulet, If you can ﬁnd it and let
St Brides know, the school will award you
an 'A' Level in Adventuring.
The vocabulary is fairly extensive and
the problems met along the way are
devious -  the instructions suggest that
they may all be solved by logic, inventive-
ness and a little homework. All I can say is
that I  must have missed some of the
lessons w her e they  explained t his
homework. I'm stuck!
A neat touch is the option to save a
game position to either disk or tape the
program is on tape). It is not an expensive
program but it will keep you frustrated for
hours. Try it and see, then let me know
what to do with the cat basket!

Come Home Mike Hammer
Thr latest detective adventure to hit the
C64 is  from US Gold's All American
Adventure series. It's entitled Masquer-
ade. This is a fairly middle of the road
program without unusual features t o
make it remarkable. It is only available on
disk, from which the graphics aee called
up each time they are needed and take
about eight seconds to appear.
The pictures are clear and colourful
and are in a semi-cartoon style that comes
across well. There are three modes of
presentation -  text only, all graphics
shown, and a neat variation called up by
the command 'MIXED'. This will display
text only but a null 'RETURN' ﬂips the
display into 'all graphics' until the next
null 'RETURN'.
You play the part of a private-eye on
the trail of a Mr Big in the crime world.
The accent is on observation and you
must n o t  expect t o  see everything
immediately a t  ﬁrst glance. Various
messages and descriptions ar e n o t
repeated so have your notebook handy!
There is a time element to your play, as
the initial locations will explode into thin
air, 75 minutes (not real time!) after you
start out on your investigations. This could
be 'crucial as  y ou must intercept a
telephone message before this happens!
The command interpreter is the basic
VERB/NOUN input and the vocabulary
does not appear to be very large. The ﬁrst
ﬁve letters of most commands must be
given for them to be actioned. This is very
important since the response to anything
it does not recognise is "SORRY CAN'T
DO THAT RIGHT NOW". Fortunately this
does not apply to direction commands
(N,S,E,W) and things like inventory (I) and
look (L).
The general style is reminiscent of
Mindshadow (which is now available on
cassette) but does not have quite the same
polish exhibited by Activision's game, It
should prove an ample challenge to the
detective brigade and although n o t
excessively difﬁcult, is probably not to be
recommended to the novice adventurer.

A d v e n t u r e s
Diabolical
I always knew that I had a strong tendency
towards t h e  m o r e  ac tiv e t y p e  o f
adventure games -  Halls of Death, The
Valley, Exodus: Ultima i l l  and more
recently the reconstituted Temple o f
Apshai Trilogy - but I never thought that I
would suffer a program that crashed so
many times, that I lost count.
Just browsing through the shelves of a
software emporium not so far from home
base, I came across Telengard produced
by Eclipse Software for The Avalon Hill
Game Company. I thought I remembered
seeing this advertised in some American
magazines but could not remember it
being pushed at all in this Country, so, at
f7.95, I gave it a try.
There have been many attempts to
reproduce Dungeons and Dragons style
games on computers. Some have been
reasonably successful, some have been
pretty ghastly. Telengard, I ﬁnd horribly
addictive, but it is true to the main aim of a
D & D type of scenario.
Telengard is a graphics adventure in
which the main aim is to gain experience
and ﬁnd treasure whilst ﬁghting off all the
nasties that hinder your progress. The
graphics are reasonable and the tension
mounts from the ﬁrst few moves to the last
moments of life.
You start at the bottom of stairs that
lead up to a congenial inn. So far so good.
All around you is a maze of passages.
These you must explore to ﬁnd treasure,
gems, gold, silver, even refuse! You start
out with sword, shield and armour, all of a
pretty mediocre brand, because if you
search diligently y ou can ﬁnd better
quality items, indicated by such as "A+7
SWORD".
All of this is very much par for the
D & D course, even the opening deter-
mination of your characteristics is very
sensible. You see a series of random
numbers allocated for your character's
attributes -  strength, intelligenc e,
wisdom, constitution, dexterity and
charisma.
These series of numbers will con-
tinually b e  updated until y ou press
'RETURN' to signify your acceptance of
the present batch. This may sound as
though you can cheat to get the character
you want, but in practice, all this means is
that you can sway the result by concen-
trating on one or two characteristics - you
are not likely to see an 'all 18s' series very
often! Yo u  may  als o choose y our
character's name.
The instruction booklet ﬁrmly recom-
mends that you choose a character with a
sound constitution! Heed the advice well,
it's based on knowledge, of the game. A
character's 'hit points' are initially equal
to its constitution. As these are whittled
away each time you are hit by a monster,
the larger the starting value the better.
Lost 'hit points' may be regained by a
restful night's zizz at an inn, Unfor-
TELENGARD
C O M M O D O R E  6 4

tunately, it is not often possible to return
alive to said inn in time to recuperate!
Although you start beneath an inn, this
is by no means the only inn to be found -
there are lots of them. Thank the gods for
small mercies! On arriving at an inn, any
gold you have with you is banked safely
away and your experience credited with
the amount o f  gold with which you
arrived.
All valuable treasure - gems, silver etc.
- is converted to the gold standard for this
calculation. Neither does it matter which
inn you decide to visit, they are all linked
by 'computer-inn'. a  fantasy wor ld
version of Barclay's Bank!
27
As your experience increases, certain
values trigger a change in your 'hit points',
this means that you can take more punish-
ment and c an venture further in t o
Telengard in search of more dangerous
monsters and greater loot.
Amongst the maze o f  rooms and
caverns which you explore will be found
numerous stairways that reach down into
the depths of Telengard - travel that way
at your peril! It is quite dangerous enough
for even the Level three adventurer to
travel far from the initial position, let
alone look  for  further trouble down
below!
Not o n l y  w i l l  y o u r  le v e l b e
incremented by  your increase in  ex-
perience but also your ability to cast spells
will increase. Initially you only have the
skill to cast level one spells, and only one
of those between visits t o  rest and
recuperate at one of the thoughtfully
provided alehouses.
Magical spells are divided into six
levels of relative power. Each spell level
has six distinct spells. Characters at.ex-
perience Level one or two, have only the
six spells at level one at their disposal. As
characters gain levels of experience the
use of higher level (and therefore more
powerful) spells becomes possible.
Every thr ee levels o f  experience
gained, permits the use of the next higher
level of spells. Spells are of roughly two
types -  'combat' spells and 'duration'
spells. The former are active offensive
spells such as 'magic missile', lightening
bolt* or 'ﬁreball'. The latter allow you to
cure wounds, search for traps or pass
through walls etc
All commands ar e given v ia t h e
keyboard as single key inputs and, except
in the novice's training exercise (entered
by calling your character Demo!), action
takes place in 'real time', so you have to
have your wits about you, There is in fact
plenty of lime to take the appropriate
action - but it does not seem like it when
you ﬁrst start!
Commands are divided into two types
- 'action' and 'encounter', There are nine
of the ﬁrst type and they are very easy to
remember. 'H' for help will tell you what
they are! The 'encounter' commands are
'E'vade, 'C'ast (a spell) and to picl.
up something you will be prompted to
press 'RETURN'. Movement is controlled
by the four keys W,XS,A (NSEW), U and
D.
There ar e 2 0  different types o f
monsters roaming around Telerigard.
Most of them are hideously opposed to
your continuing existence! A very small
proporticn meet you with the greeting
that they -
taken two ways to start with, initially
thought they were going to eat me but,
they actually help you, perhaps curing
you of all wounds or maybe giving you a
powerful weapon.
The monsters have a similar system to
you and your experience, so they have a
different level, this level and their rank
(Gnoll, lowest -  Dragon highest), deter-
mines how many experience points you
gain in defeating them. It also determines
how difﬁcult they are to defeat! Although
you may be only on the ﬁrst level, a
surprising number of powerful creatures
appear right from the start.
When I ﬁrst came up against a level 60
Giant, I thought there must have been a
glitch in the program but then I found the
instruction booklet hints at level 76! As
beﬁts a game of this type, some of the
monsters have quite nasty habits - several
drain your energy and knock you down a
level of experience. Dragon ﬁre is not
much fun either!
There are a number of 'features' such
as stairways, pits, altars etc. which remain
at the same locations -  if you can ﬁnd
them again. Fountains seem to crop up
quite often. The water from these varies in
colour as does its properties when drunk.
Some c olours  ar e beneﬁcial, and,
surprise. surprise, some are not!
There are potions to heal and also
those to increase your strength. Various

A d v e n t u r e s
artefacts found have 'plus' factors. Careful
that y o u  d o n ' t  inadvertently press
'RETURN' to pick up an item which has a
smaller 'plus' factor than the one you
already have. Its very easy to do in the heat
of the moment! Sadly, you will have lost
the one you were carrying.
I have found items up to 'plus 8' but I
suspect that there are more powerful
creations deeper down. One of the most
useful is a 'Ring of Regeneration', this aids
the recovery of your hit points by its 'plus
factor' with each step you take, a deﬁnite
necessity for exploration below level two.
There are also the useful 'Scrolls of
Rescue' -  you may pick up several of
these. Using one will take you back to
your original place of entry to Telengard
(under that inn), but there is a cost, any
gold you have with you is lost on the way.
This is sometimes a fair price to pay if you
have been teleported to an unknown
corner of the underworld.
Characters may be saved on a separate
cassette and I would recommend doing
this immediately you enter the game -
especially if you have taken any time in
trying to get the character's attributes to
your liking!
The instruction booklet burbles on
about being able to load dead characters
if their name begins with SV - I think this
must be a throw back to a disk based
predecessor, as I died with monotonous
regularity and had n o  trouble time-
shifting my character to a 'save' before he
died!
I hope I have whetted a few appetites
of the more adventurous amongst you
with what has gone before perhaps now is
the time to look at the other side of
Telengard.
For a start, it cannot be in the true spirit
of the dedicated D  &  D  game. Why?
Because I do not think you could stay alive
for long enough to ever get anywhere
without 'saving' your character to tape at
very frequent intervals. I was prepared to
accept this as part of the 'overall battle',
others may not be so sanguine about it.
There are other problems you have to
overcome too. And not part of the game
either! I have never had a program crash
so often before. It loaded perfectly and
within the ﬁrst few moments crashed with
a SYNTAX ERROR I N  LINE XXXX.
Sometimes RUN got it going again, only to
crash once more with a syntax error in a
different line!
Once past the ﬁrst few minutes, things
were OK until I 'saved' a character. Most
times this went perfectly but there were
many occasions when t h e  program
crashed after a successful 'save' and the
main program had to be loaded from
scratch (about four minutes).
The program as  y ou mus t hav e
guessed from the above is written in Basic
and of course is a little slow to re-draw
your character's surroundings as y ou

was, I do not think I could have become so
involved, In this day and age it is sur-
prising that the present version was not
compiled. One must surely ask -why not?

For all these genuine criticisms, I have
to admit I enjoyed the game enormously.,
quite addictive i n  fac t, and that's
something, for someone who plays as
many adventures as I do. But then I'm a
simple barbarian at heart.
I do not think that Eclipse Software still
exists -  it was an 'imprint' for Longmans
(the publishers) but the program is still for
sale. The cost is not high, so if you are a
frustrated 'dungeon dweller' why not
have a try - I really would like to hear what
you think of it.
If you cannot ﬁnd it in your local shops
you can get it  direct from: Customer
Services Dept, Longmans Group Ltd, 4th
Avenue, Pinnacles, Harlow, Essex CM19
5AA. The price is £7.95 plus 75p post and
packing. Mine may have been a rogue

consider it as part of the adventure, and
please do not complain - you have been

lain Murray provides al
program to smarten
up your cassette
library.
This program allows the u5er to
produce neat inlay cards for
cassette tape boxes for music
tapes or computer data tapes
using a  Commodore 1520
Printer/Plotter. It uses many of
the features o f  t h e  1520
including the four character
sizes, four colours, and vertical
text for the spine of the inlay.
The program requests input
of the tape number, a title for
the tape and for each side, and
the option to list up to 10 items
on the index of each side of the
tape. I f  any input is  made
incorrectly, t h e n  pressing
RETURN on its own at the next
input will cause a jump back to
the previous prompt. T he
plotter will then produce the
required inlay card.
The plotter draws an outline
for cutting out and folding the
card. The tape number and title
are then printed, followed by
the title and index for each
side. The tape number and title
are then printed on the spine.
The character size is set auto-
matically depending o n  the
length of the titles required.
Finally, the tape title and side
titles are printed on the back
ﬂap (though if the tape title and
side titles are the same, then
only one will appear). On com-
pletion of the card, the option
to print another is given.
Control characters in  the
text are detailed in preceding

Stuart Cooke puts Ariolasoft's
I
IF, LIKE ME, YOU USE A COMPUTER FOR
a lot of your work it is very important that
it gives quick access to everything that you
wish to do. For example you may do a lot
of wordprocessing and require access to a
database or a spreadsheet occasionally.
No problem, I hear you say, buy one of
each program. This is a great idea, but one
major thing is being forgotten, time.
The C64 and its disk drive are not
exactly well known for their speed, in fact
most people moan about the lack of it. A
typical wordprocessor will take about ﬁve
minutes to load, a database around the
same. N o w  t h e  pr oblem becomes
apparent. I f  you need to do a lot of
swapping between programs then a lot of
time is wasted loading them all in, de-
feating the whole point o f  having a
computer around in the ﬁrst place. Why
use a database when a card index box is a
lot quicker?
Obviously, if all of the programs that
you require are available on one disk, a lot
of time can be saved in exchanging disks
etc. This is exactly what Ariolasoft has
done with one o f  its latest releases,
Homepak. A  wordprocessor, database,
and communications program are all
available on one disk.
It is also possible t o go one step
further. Wouldn't it be great if all of the
programs that y o u  needed t o  us e
regularly could all be in the computer's
memory at the same time? Press a couple
of keys and the program needed would
burst into life ready to obey your every
command. Team-Mate, a program that
Homepak
looks extremely similar t o  t h e  3+1
software that is found on a Plus/4, offers
just this facility. With Team-Mate up to
three programs can be in memory at any
one time. The programs are a Word-
processor, a Database and a Spreadsheet.
As an added bonus a graphics package,
for drawing graphs, pie charts etc. is also
present on the software disk.
A5 previously mentioned this suite of
programs goes some way to solving some
of the speed problems of the CM as all of
the programs are on one disk. However
they are all quite slow in loading and a
great deal of disk swapping is necessary if
you need to use the other programs.
Each of the available programs are
extremely well presented and easy to use
- the 61 page manual makes sure of that -
and hav e facilities that y ou w ould
probably only expect to see on individual
pieces of software costing as much as this
complete package.
The manual, even though it is very
good, can only be described as micro-
scopic, It has been reduced so that it will
ﬁt inside ihe standard disk box that the
programs come in. Get a magnifying glass
if you are going to be reading a lot of it at
once, you'll probably need it.
Each of the programs are dealt with in
turn. Screen shots are used to give you a
general idea of what you should see on
the screen when certain menus are
accessed. And a handy crib sheet at the
end of each program's documentation
gives a  handy reminder o f  the keys
needed to operate the software. I must
admit that I fail to see the relevance of a
very large section of the manual (seven
pages) being given over to an explanation
31
of how to use the telecommunications
software with Compuserve and the Com-
modore Information Service, these are
American software services. Come on
Ariolasoft, you've gone to the trouble of
printing your name on the front of the
manual, why not alter the last section so
that it refers to a British system such as one
of the many bulletin boards available or
even Telecom Gold. I  wouldn't have
thought that too many people would be
phoning America so that they can follow
your instructions.
Hometext - yes you've guessed it -the
wordprocessor, has  some extremely
interesting features. All of the available
commands are selected from 'pull down
menus' that a r e  controlled b y  t h e
function keys. This means that when you
press the relevant k ey  a  menu, for
example the printer format menu, will
appear on the screen on top of your text,
replacing the text underneath when you
have ﬁnished using the menu. This is great
as you never have to memorise any of the
commands, such as those for headers or
setting margins, as they can all be called
up on screen. There is one slight gripe
here however. A  reminder could have
been put on the editing screen so that you

could see at a glance what function key
brought up which menu, it's frustrating to
go through them all every time you want
to do something. I suppose if you were
really bothered you could always stick a
bit of paper over your function keys.
When you have ﬁnished typing your
latest novel you can have a look at what
the page layout looks like with the view
function, This 'draws a picture of every
page with each letter being represented
by a dot. This does come in very useful
when things need t o  b e  positioned
correctly, it may even help you to spot
your mistakes in the layout.
Of course all of the normal printer
facilities such as underlining and spacing
are catered for, though headers and
footers are dealt with in a strange way. Not
only do you have to tell I lometext where a
heading starts you must also tell it where
the heading ﬁnishes. This means that it is
possible to have headers that run over
more than one line of the paper when
printed. I must admit this did leave me a
little confused at ﬁrst as I didn't tell the
program where my header ﬁnished the
ﬁrst time that I tried to use this function.
The view option showed that something
was amiss and I was able to correct the
problem before I sent the document to
the printer, I  told you that view was
handy.
Homeﬁnd -  the database i s  a little
strange. In case you have never used a
database I should explain how you would
normally use one. Your computer is
treated as an electronic card index box.
You would set up a series of ﬁelds into
which you should enter information. You
can then ask the computer to ﬁnd speciﬁc
information from what it has stored on
disk. An example of a layout for a database
may be:
NAME
ADDRESS
TELEPHONE
You can n o  doubt see where the
similarity to the old card-index comes in.
Well, Hometind is totally different Yes, it
is still used for information storage and
retrieval but there is no ﬁxed format as to
what can be entered into the system. For
example a few entries to the database may
be:
Fred's Birthday's August 23rd
jim's Birthday's June 5th
Fred's Address's 123 Main Street
As you can see you almost talk to the
computer, and any information can be
stored. Once the information has been
stored you can ask questions such as:
What's Fred's Address?
And the answer will appear as if by magic.
There is  n o  provision within the
program for getting printouts of speciﬁc
information though it is possible to keep a
printed copy of any 'conversations
you have with the computer. And of
course information can be stored on disk
for later inclusion in the wordprocessor.
Personally, I ﬁnd this structure for a
database very restricting, I can't see any
way that you could use the program to run
a mailing list or store information about a
record collection. Even so the program is
very clever and great fun to use. No dou bt
many people will love the 'friendliness' of
the program and use it for just those
things that I said I couldn't see a way of
doing.
IP
Hometerm I consider to be one of the
most impor tant things  about t his
program. Modems are becoming cheaper
all of the time and more and more people
are becoming interested in communi-
cating via computer. Before I  go any
further it  is  worth stressing that this
program is a terminal emulation program
which can be used to access bulletin
boards and systems such as Telecom Gold.
It is not a Viewdata type system and
cannot be used with systems such as
Prestel or Compunet.
With Hometerm and an RS232 modem
it is possible to talk to your friends who
have this software and modems, swap
programs with each other and talk to each
other via your computer keyboard. Many
of the bulletin boards now have Commo-
dore sections on them so you can ask
questions to other people who use the
system etc. In fact the day of the elect-
ronic ofﬁce is here. One person can write
an article using Hometext. Send it t o
someone else via Hometerm and they can
then print it out using Hometext
For the more technical bods out there
the following data formats are catered for,
ASCII, CBM (commodore characters),
Vidtex and the very popular )(modem.
32
One handy facility that the program
has is that of Macros. It is possible to set up
a ﬁle that holds information such as your
name, and your password. These macros
can then be used to send the information
required to the computer saving you a lot
of typing if you access a particular system a
lot.
Not much more can be said about
these packages. They are all very good
and would be worth a look at if the asking
price was just for one of them. As I have
said I found Homeﬁnd a little limiting but
no doubt others will love it. All of the
programs are well presented and easy to
use. If you need any of the programs then
the package is well worth the price even
though some o f  the 'polish' may be
missing t h a t  i t s  m o r e  expensive,
individual program, competitors have,
All in one
The other package mentioned is Team-
Mate. What makes this program stand out
from the rest is the fact that it is possible to
have all of the programs in memory at any
one time. Obviously, this means that you
are limited to how much space is available
at once for a speciﬁc task. Team-Mate gets
around this in a very clever way, It allows
you to choose, upon loading the software,
exactly what you want in memory. Below
is the menu presented when you load the
software:
(1) Desktop (3 prgs)
(2) Plus Graph (1 prg)
(3) Write File (2 prgs)
(4) Home Ofﬁce (2 prgs)
(5) Utilities

C 6 4
1
Dealing with each option in term.
Desktop comprises of a Wordprocessor.
Spread sheet and ﬁle manager (database)
all of which are loaded into memory at the
and very easy t o  switch
same time
between.
Plus Graph is a stand alone business
graphics program that is used to display
information from either the spreadsheet
or entered by hand.
Write ﬁle comprises o f  the word-
processor and the ﬁle manager both now
with a help facility.
Horne Ofﬁce is Wordprocessor plus
help and a spreadsheet plus help.
Utilities are such things as 'Format
Disk' and 'Rename File'.
As can b e  seen fr om the above
breakdown quite a number of differing
tastes ar e catered for . M y  personal
favourite is Writeﬁle. This allows me to
have a database at my ﬁngertips with
information such as company addresses
and telephone numbers, and access to a
fairly decent wordprocessor at the same
time. Up until now the only that this has
been possible was to have two C64s on my
desk.
hit the streets. Granted that the software
does have its limitations but in my eyes
these a r e  m o r e  t h a n  adequately
overcome d u e  t o  t h e  software's
convenience.
As with the Plus/4 only 99 lines of text
can be entered into the wordprocessor.
This doesn't sound too many but when
you realise that a line is 80 characters a
quick calculation will show that around
1000 words can be entered before you run
out of room. T
the standard letter that you wish to write.
All of the usual commands are present in
the wordprocessor, such as line spacing
and margins. There are however some
notable omissions, such as the lack of
headers and footers. An interesting way of
overcoming this problem is given in the
manual, but more of this later.
Obviously the wordprocessor is not as
sophisticated as many of its competitors.
There are no fancy menus or icons in this
program. Don't forget that you do have
the H elp function i n  t he expanded
versions which soon solves this problem.
It is remarkably easy to transfer data
from both the spreadsheet and database
into the wordprocessor. In fact the only
As I have previously mentioned the
software is very similar to that found in the
Commodore Plu5/4 computer. The layout
of the programs and the instructions for
use are very similar, i.e. the same. For this
reason the software will probably get the
same stick that the Plus/4 did when it
arrived on the market, 'only 99 lines in the
wordprocessor a n d  o t h e r  s u c h
comments abounded when that beastie
way t o  pr int information f r om t h e
database is via the wordprocessor. It is
even possible to select certain ﬁelds for
printing, this makes the program very
good for addressing letters or printing
labels. It is this facility that allows you to
add headers to articles, Simply leave room
at the top of every page for the header
when you print your text. Then set up
your header as a database ﬁle, then put
33
your paper back in the printer and tell the
program to print the information in the
database at the top of every piece of
paper, clever huh!
As with Homepak a preview function
is also available within the wordprocessor
(this function is not present in Desktop)
this prints out the text to the screen as it
will appear on the printer. The 40 columns
of the screen act as a window over the
larger BO columns of the text.
The database or ﬁle manager is more
of what I  would call a real database.
Before you use the program you must set
up a speciﬁc format for all entries, such as
the one given earlier in  this article.
Information is then entered as requested
by the program and stored on a disk for
retrival at a later date. Again no fancy
icons or prompts in this program and it is a
little awkward to use in places. But it does
its job and is very handy.
Commands available allow the user to
move to speciﬁed records, search for a
speciﬁc piece o f  information, review
records, update records and even copy
records. It is possible to sort records using
a speciﬁed ﬁeld, it is even possible to do a
sort on disk with up to three ﬁelds.
The expanded ﬁle manager, available
from write ﬁle but without the word-
processor present, offers even more
facilities for  the more advanced user.
Examples o f  added commands ar e
'makekeyﬁeld' and 'showkey' whic h
make a speciﬁed ﬁeld the main ﬁeld in a
record, speeding up all searching and
sorting and print the contents of the key
ﬁeld respectively.
The Spreadsheet is not exceptionally
large, 50 rows by 17 columns. This means
that it is not suitable for use in a large
business but is great for working out
budgets o r  totalling expenses. Don't
forget y ou c an even get the word-
processor to print out a letter taking
information from the spreadsheet making
printing bills very easy. In fact one very
nice touch is the ability to have half of the
screen displaying the contents of the
wordprocessor and the other half the
spreadsheet. This makes it very easy for
you to see exactly what you are doing.
The manual for the suite of programs is
written in such a way that even a beginner
could get started without t oo muc h
difﬁculty. All aspects of the programs are
dealt with via little examples, for instance
the section on the spread sheet shows
how you could set up a budget sheet
showing all the money that you have
spent or saved.
Team-mate can only be described as
the program that a lot of C64 owners have
been waiting for. OK, so it has its limita-
tions but there are ways to get around
these. The fact that the programs you are
going to need can be loaded into memory
just the once and that data can be stored
on one disk is  superb. Load in  the
programs in the morning and that's it.
Everything is at your ﬁnger tips. Now I've
started using the programs I wouldn't be
without them.

HAVING WATCHED COUNT-
less episodes of Star Trek, I
always thought that Captain
Kirk had things very easy
commanding a  space ship.
Especially if you have a reliable
crew to carry out your every
order quickly and efﬁciently.
Psi 5 Trading Co., from US Gold
seemed to be just the game I
needed to prove my point. All I
had to  d o  was to  select a
suitable crew to enable me to
deliver a cargo to some remote
outpost of the universe and
collect a  handsome bonus.
One hour into the game and I
was a total wreck. My crew
were tearing their hair out in
despair and countermanding
my orders, looters were
stealing my cargo willy-nilly
and I no longer knew whether I
was coming or going.
Your ﬁrst decisions are
involved with crew selection
and the success of your mission
could well be put into jeopardy
straight away i f you get i t
wrong. There are ﬁve positions
to be ﬁlled in the scanning,
weapons, navigation, engin-
eering and repair departments
with six candidates for each
job. A screen illustrating the
candidates is displayed - they
may be humanoids, aliens or
vaccdroids and you can call up
details of each applicant before
making your selection. From
these resumes, you can learn
about a character's qualiﬁca-
tions, education, experience,
strengths and weaknesses. For
example, you may learn that
whilst someone knows their
job inside out, they fall to
pieces under pressure, whilst a
rival might be a loner and a
poor communicator but won't
bat an eyelid when the ship is
under heavy attack.
Having agonised over your
recruitment, it  is  on t o  the
mission its elf. T h e  screen
depicts y o u r communication
console with your current view
displayed to p  left and the
appropriate crew member top
right. The bottom half of the
screen gives various status
reports whilst the central bars
contain assorted indicators for
you to monitor and a menu of
your current choices.
Your initial menu allows
you to read all the pending
messages or contact a speciﬁc
department. If you don't keep
in touch wit h  sections regu-
larly, they will go off and do
their own thing. Most of your
decisions involve what t h e
Americans call prioritizing -
working out which orders take
precedence. I s  i t  mo re
important t o  g e t  t h e  s hip
travelling a t full speed o r
should you divert some power
into defensive shields? Which
items should be repaired ﬁrst?
Strangely, every department
thinks that they should have
priority. As things get worse, so
the animated pictures of the
crew show their feelings -
totally laid back or gibbering
wrecks. To give some idea of
what you have to control, here
is a  q u ick lo o k a t  t h e  ﬁve
departments and their various
tasks.
The scanning department is
in charge of the radars and will
try and identify and track other
spacecraft. I n  time, they can
determine whether a craft is
friend or foe, lock on to it and
recommend which weapon is
best to use against it.
Once an enemy ha% been
identiﬁed, the weapons section
can attack i t  w ith missiles,
blasters, cannons and thermos.
By analysing various statistics,
you can assess how efﬁcient
your crew is with each weapon
type.
The navigation section will
estimate the time of arrival at
your destination and show you
the risk involved with various
routes. You can change speed
and t a k e  evasive a ctio n  i f
necessary.
All sections of the ship have
various p o we r requirements
and allocating that power is the
responsibility of the engineer-
ing department.
It will not be long before
your ship suffers damage and it
is necessary to  request the
services of the repair section.
Items can be operable (at a
higher power cost), repairable
or destroyed. There are several
droids at y our disposal and
again, you will need to decide
what needs to be done, who's
available to do it and how long
it will take.
Control of the game is very
simple via either joystick or
keyboard - it is just the deci-
sions that are difﬁcult. There is
so much going on, that it will
take some considerable time to
get t h e  hang o f  things.
Graphically, th e  game i s
stunning so you can always sit
back and watch as your ship is
destroyed around you. A
highly original and thoroughly
excellent game.

Evidently you know where
the treasure is. at least the
instructions say that you do,
but in order to gain access to
the treasure you must collect a
number o f  keys that are
scattered around n o  fewer
than 178 screens. Yes, that's
right, somehow Anirog has
managed to get a 178 different

You would expect that the

damsel can be rescued Bongo

makes a change from being

CLOSELY GUARDED COPY-
rights had to be skirted around
in the production of this game,
based around television's most
successful science ﬁction
series. The BBC seem pleased
to b e  associated with t h e
product but I suspect that the
series' creator decided that it
was against t h e  national
interest to tarry with Micro-
power. No doubt royalty fees
lie at the heart of this situation.
The result is reﬂected in the
appearance of, dare I say it.
Dalek-like creatures called
Controllers w ho guard t he
TIRU machine which t h e
Doctor must disable before the
fabric of the time-space con-
tinuum is torn to shreds.
The TIRU (Time Instant
Replay Unit) is a  temporal
editing suite. An instant in time
can be recorded, edited and
replaced f o r good o r  evil
sur soses by the use of this
machine. It is therefore the real
time equivalent of our humble
VHS video system_ The source
of its power lies in rods of
Heatonite crystal which is only
found in sufﬁcient quantity on
the planet Rijar. For obvious
reasons this is where the TRU
has been built and it is now
controlled b y  t h e Doctor's
arch-enemy, the Master.
The pre-publicity claims
that the game starts with the
familiar Dr Who theme. Well, if
this is true then rm a toreador.
Maybe, there w ere mo re
copyright - problems b u t
judging by the voicing of the
existing tune it appears that we
haven't missed much. I strongly
advise that you play this game
with the volume turned off_
The good old Police Box
Tardis gradually materialises at
the start of the game and out
pops the Doctor and his new
assistant Spinx. the robotic cat.
i his white feline is an amazing
invention of the Time Lords
and i t  can wander at  will
through t h e  ensuing u n -
observed b y all except the
Doctor. It is a secret weapon in
every sense of the word and if
lost it will be impossible for the
good Doctor to complete his
mission to destroy the TIRU
and recover the plans_
Splinx can be programmed
to perform a range of tasks as
long as it does not involve
climbing! Whether it suffers
from vertigo o r not is not
explained but the only way to
persuade it to go up a ladder is
to force the Doctor to carry it. It
is nonetheless a very useful
beast which can be sent to
recover any item whith is near
one of the markers which the
Doctor can throw around the
place.
Ii is not long before Splinx's
assistance is necessary. After a
short exploratory walk around
the Heatonite mine a dinosaur-
like creature, a Madrag, will be
encountered. Normally this
will ﬁrst be in the form of
Madrag eggs which hatch
spontaneously as soon as a
suitable food source comes
near. Guess Who is suitable!
The eggs are also jealously
guarded by mother Madrag
and this is a useful key to the
solution of the ﬁrst of many
problems which must be faced.
The documentation with
the game is superb. an area in
which Micropower usually
excells_ Apart from the usual
loading and playing instruc-
tions the pack also includes a
sealed solution to the Madrag
problem, a  detailed break-
down of the main elements of
the game, a map of part of the
mining complex and a printout
of t h e  m a j o r  o b j e c t s
encountered in the game. The
ﬁnal card in the pack is vital
because it gives the code used
to recover the memory capsule
containing the TIRU plans_ By
far the greatest challenge is an
encounter with a  controller_
They are fast and persistent in
their pursuit of an enemy. As
long as they can see which way
you went they will give chase.
Fortunately, they cannot climb
ladders or move off the grid
ﬂoor which supplied their
power.
The Doctor regenerates
each time he is killed. This
means that he returns to the
TAR DIS or the last Cryogenic
Sleep Chamber (CSC) that he
passed. All of the objects which
have been found and tucked
away in his copious pockets will
be retained but he will always
have to relocate Splinx. The
CSCs have a second, important
purpose. By standing next to
one of these the game can be
saved until another day.
Graphically. the game is
quite pleasant. the casual lope
of the Doctor is particularly
impressive. The challenges are
difﬁcult but logical and, apart
from t h e nagging music. I
wholeheartedly recommend
this game.

THIR I Y SIX. TWENTY FOUR.
Thirty six. Hup! Hupt Yes, after
considerable delays, Ocean's
Superbowl has ﬁnally arrived
amidst considerable razzama-
tazz and waving of pompoms.
Most of the delays were due to
various gameplay problems
(scores of over 100 points were
being recorded) but these have
now been sorted out.
Fans of American Football
will know that despite initial
appearances, there is actually a
great deal of skill involved in
the game, organising tactics
and running to predetermined
patterns. Ocean has managed
to pack a lot of detail into this
game although some patriotic
prejudice is displayed with a
reference to real football in the
instructions! For people who
know nothing at all about this
thrilling game, there isan audio
tape included in the package
which gives you a quick run
down on the rules, terms and
basic tactics. This works very
well and is a lot better than the
normal 12 page booklet that
you usually get.
The screen is divided into
two main sections. On the right
is an overhead view o f  the
playing area. This depicts the
starting positions of the move
that y ou want t o  tr y  and
execute and then follows the
move through once the ball has
been snapped. You control
one previously determined
player although it is possible to
change this during the course
of the play if  you are fast
enough. Eleven men On each
side running in 22 different
directions takes quite a bit of
getting used to!
The left hand side of the
screen serves two functions. As
a purely decorative part of the
game, an action replay of the
previous play appears on the
giant screen. This shows the
players r unning, throwing,
tackling and catching the ball
and i s  n ic e ly  a n im a t e d
although it tends to get a bit
repetitive after a while (you can
stop the display with a quick
press of the ﬁre button).
The nitty gritty part of the
game -deciding on your tactics
is determined through a series
of menus. Starting with the
offense, an initial menu gives
you the chance to try a long or
short pass, a rushing play or a
special p l a y  ( ﬁe ld  g o a l
attempts, punts and goal line
rushes). These choices lead
into sub-menus giving you a
choice of starting formations
with such esoteric names as
shotgun and split red. Selecting
"view next frame" from the
menu allows you to watch the
players m o v in g  t o  t h e ir
designated positions -  a very
useful option that gives you
some understanding o f  the
theory behind the manoeuvres.
You can also change which
player you want to receive the
ball once 'the move has started.
When you are happy with
your choices, the "play games"
option allows your opponent
(or the computer) to decide on
their defensive strategy. As
soon as that is ready, the move
is ready to be executed. The
center snaps the ball back to
the quarterback whilst t h e
other players start t o  move
upﬁeld according t o  y our
instructions. A quick press of
the lir e  button moves the
cursor around t h e  eligible
receivers starting with the one
that you previously designated.
As your ﬁnger is removed from
the button, so the ball is thrown
and the receiver comes under
joystick control. He must then
move to where he thinks the
ball is  going t o  land as he
endeavours to catch it.
Instead of passing the ball,
the offense may try to kick it,
either attempting to score a
ﬁeld goal or simply punting to
relieve their lines. Keeping the
ﬁre button pressed brings up a
power scale s howing t h e
percentage o f  the maximum
kick currently chosen. I t  is
tempting to go for full range
every time but this is wrong as
the ac c urac y  o f  a  k ic k
decreases with power.
The defense is somewhat
more complicated to organise.
Apart f r o m  choosing y our
initial formation from 3-4-4, 4-
3-4, 4-2-5 and 7-1-3, you must
also decide who is going to
mark whom, which players are
going to go for the opponent
holding the ball and which
offensive players will remain
unmarked. Again, y ou c an
decide which player you wish
to control in the ensuing move
(number 7 3  William 'T he
Fridge Perry is likely to be a
popular choice).
Superbowl i s  t h e  bes t
American Football game seen
to date. Based on this January's
game in which the Chicago
Bears thr as hed t h e  N e w
England Patriots 46-10, it is an
extremely credible situation.
Devotees o f  the game need
look n o  further. For people
who know absolutely nothing
about the game, why not try
your hand before the new
season starts on Channel 4.

ARCHON II: ADEPT

ARCHON WAS ONE OF THE
most original strategy games
ever w r it t e n ,  jus tiﬁably
winning several awards. Now
Electronic Arts has released a
sequel on the Ariolasoft label.
Archon I I .  Adept sees y ou
taking sides in an epic struggle
between the Master of Order
and the Mistress of Chaos in a
game featuring both strategy
and arcade elements.
The strategy takes place on
a screen featuring the four
concentric rings representing
the classical elements of Earth
Water, Air and Fire. In addition,
there are two neutral squares
which represent the void and
the home squares for each side
- the Fortress of Order and the
Temple of Chaos.
The aim of the game is to
occupy six power points. Two
of these are the void squares
and the other four  are the
outer corners of the elemental
bands, These four rotate in turn
from band to band. You can
also win by the total annihila-
tion of the opposition's forces.
You start the game with four
adepts - one in each element.
Each turn, they can either move
or cast a spell providing that
you have sufﬁcient energy to
carry out your choice. There
are seven spells to choose from
but the one that you will use
more t h a n  a n y  o t h e r  i s
summon". This is  used t o
bring another piece o n the
board.
The other spells available to
you are: heal one o f  your
pieces, weaken an opponent's
piece, imprison a n  enemy,
release o n e  o f  y our  o w n
imprisoned pieces, banish a
hostile enemy or  something
called apocalypse which is a
ﬁnal battle used to put your
adversary out of  his misery.
Casting spells costs varying
amounts of energy depending
on its  potency. H ow  much
energy y o u  hav e a t  y our
disposal depends on how many
power points you occupy.
There ar e t w o  types o f
pieces that can be summoned,
demons and elementals, Both
sides have the same demons at
their disposal -  juggernauts,
wraiths, gorgons and chimera
whilst their  elementals ar e
different. Order can call on the
services o f  a  giant, kraken,
thunderbird and salamander,
representing earth, water, air
and ﬁre whilst Chaos has a
behemoth, siren, it r it  and
ﬁrebird available to him.
All these characters have
different strengths and weak-
nesses w hen i t  comes t o
combat. Sirens for example just
have to sing and the opposition
starts to die. Salamanders hurl
ﬁreballs, gorgons paralyse
whilst wraiths get stronger as
you get weaker - they are also
invisible most of the time and
'so make extremely formidable
opponents. Not quite as bad as
a juggernaut though which is
best described as pure energy
on wheels. It just steamrollers
opposition out of the way.
Combat occurs when two
pieces want to occupy the same
square. The scene switches to
the battleground where you
must make instant decisions as
you ltry to probe the opposi-
tion's weaknesses and utilise
your own strengths t o their
best advantage. Each piece's
strength is  displayed as  an
energy bar down the side of the
screen. This reduces for each
successful wound inﬂicted.
When the bar reaches zero, the
icon dies leaving the victor in
sole possession of the disputed
square.
As might b e  expected,
pieces ﬁght best when in their
home element e.g. krakens in
the water band. After you have
ﬁred y o u r  thunderbolt o r
whatever, it takes time before
you are allowed to ﬁre your
next. This time interval varies
from piece to piece and the
computer lets you know with a
ping - high or low depending
on which side you're on. The
battle ground has a number of
barriers w•hich must be dodged
round or used strategically. The
different elements  hav e
differing effects on missiles and
icons. F o r  ex ample, ﬁr e
wounds an ic on but leaves
missiles untouched whilst earth
destroys missiles and slows
icons.
Control o f  t h e  game is
entirely via a joystick. Spells are
selected from a menu whilst
movement i s  achieved b y
moving a  s quare s haped
cursor. Mov ing r ound t h e
combat screen is  straight-
forward. Aiming a  missile
involves pressing t h e  ﬁr e
button and moving the joystick
in t h e  des ired direc tion.
Adepts can move their missiles
whilst in ﬂight a  useful trick to
know.
Archon II features a wide
range o f  options t o  choose
from: Which side you play,
number of players and their
skill levels. Be warned though.
the computer plays a  very
mean game and you are likely
to be thrashed in your ﬁrst few
games. I  w o u l d  s tr ongly
recommend that you watch the
demonstration games a  few
times so that you can get some
idea of the strategies and tactics
required.
Archon II is  an excellent
strategy game and one that will
take you a lifetime to master -
then you can play with the
other side and learn a totally
new set o f  tactics. Whilst it
doesn't quite reach the exalted
standards set by the original,
that is no real criticism and the
game c an b e  unreservedly
recommended.

Save your ﬁngers a lot of
work with our new software
[service.
IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
You sit at the computer keyboard having
Just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of  the superb programs
from Your Commodore. Your ﬁngers
reach for the keyboard and press the
letters R .  U  and N i .  You s it back
expet tautly and...nothing happens.
Well. I'm sure that we have all had
problem before now. When it  does
happen it's a matter of spending hours
searching through the program for any
typing mistakes. No matter how long you
look or how many people help you, you
can usually guarantee that at least one
little bug slips through unnoticed.
Here, at YOUT Commodore, we pride
ourselves on the quality ot listing that we
print. Unfortunately, this usually means
that they are also very long, thus taking
longer to type in and leaving more room
for errors. All of  the listings in Your
Commodore are taken straight from a
printout o f  working programs, i t  is
therefore very unusual f or  errors t o
appear in the magazine.
Because of the length of our programs
we do get a large number of requests from
readers who would like us to put speciﬁc

programs o n  tape o r  disk for  them.
Obviously this is very time consuming and
means that we can't spend as much time
working on the magazine as we would
like.
We are therefore proud to announce
the start of the Your Commodore Soft-
ware Service'. Most of the programs from
each issue of the magazine will now be
available on a single cassette for a price of
just €4.00. We will not be making disks
available since they would have to be a lot
more expensive and more difﬁcult to
post. This  shouldn't cause y ou any
I would like to order the following cassettes: (please tick box)
problems though as none of the programs
will be protected and it will be a simple
matter t o  save the programs t o  disk
yourselves.
All programs on the cassette will be
saved us ing a  tape tur bo routine.
However, we cannot guarantee that all
programs will work correctly with this
turbo routine present We  therefore
recommend that betore you use any of
the programs you make a copy of the
programs on your own cassette or disk
and use this version of the program not
the original.

COMMODORE LISTINGS ARE RATHER
well known for the horrible little black
blobs that always abound. Unfortunately
the graphics characters which are used to
represent graphic and control characters
do not reproduce very well and they are
also difﬁcult to ﬁnd on the Commodore
keyboard
In future all control and graphics
commands will be replaced by a mnemonic
within square brackets. This mnemonic is
not typed out as printed in the magazine
but rather the corresponding key or keys
on the keyboard are pressed. For example
[RIGHT] means press the cursor right key,
you do not type in [RIGHT]. All of the
keywords, what keys to press and how
they are shown on the screen are shown
below
Any character that is accessed by pressing
shift and a  letter will be printed as
(Sletter].
[SA] s hift and A
[St] s h if t  and +
Any chdracter that is  accessed by
pressing the Commodore key and a letter
will be printed as [Cletter]

THE CREATOR SERIES
Now you can let your mind go in a
crescendo of creativity. You may think
you are unable to program, you may
know nothing about computing but now
YOU are able to write  stunning original
machine code programs. ARCADE
A R C A D E  CREATOR
CREATOR, the ﬁrst release in the
CREATOR SERIES, allows you to
program your own arcade games in the
language you know best - English.
If you prefer the complex mind
stretching world of the strategy
program, then the second in the series,
BATTLE CREATOR, is for you. Using
simple commands you can devise your
own brain buster, without busting your
own brain in the process.
For the budding musician, the third in
the series, MUSIC CREATOR, helps you
to compose your own melodies and
rhythms.

Gordon Hamlett explores the
complexities of US Gold's
Ultima IV.
SINCE THE MENACE OF EXODUS WAS
destroyed, Lord British is  looking for
someone to improve the quality of life
throughout the land of Britannia. This in-
volves ﬁnding or achieving something
called Avatar about which. everybody hds
heard and nobody appears t o  know
an
How you came to be volunteered for
this quest is an interesting story. Whilst
walking in  the countryside, you see a
bright light and hear d strange noise. From
then o n ,  things g e t  curiouser and
curiouser and you are inexorably lured by
some music into a gipsy caravan. There, an
old woman asks you some questions
based o n honour, valour, justice and
other virtues. Depending o n  y our
answers, your character is assessed and
your profession determined. This may be
one o f  eight types including ﬁghter,
mage, druid and ranger.
The land of Britannia is a large and
varied place. There are eight major towns,
each one specialising in one of the eighth
professions. , The people ins ide ar e
friendly and you will need to talk to every-
one you meet, trying to glean useful
scraps of information. There are castles
and villages to be explored too- if you can
ﬁnd them. Outside of the towns, the land
is more hostile- wandering bands of orcs,
rogues, trolls and two-headed ettins etc.
roam the countryside intent on trying to
kill you. The land itself can also be hostile
- marshes give off poisonous gases that
can r apidly  deplete y our  strength
although there are healers in several of
the towns who will cure you - for a price_
There are dungeons to be discovered
and explored, and shrines to be sought
out. Travel is usually on foot although you
may be able to beg. steal or borrow horses
to speed up your journey. You will cer-
tainly need a ship to visit the islands, not
all of which are on your map and you will
have to learn how to use the moongates
efﬁciently. There is also rumoured to be a
balloon o r  something similar hidden
away.
As you travel the land and talk to the
people, you can try and persuade them to

join your party. Up to seven others can
join - one from each of the other profes-
sion types -  paladin, bard, tinker and
shepherd being the others. Some will only
join you when you prove yourself worthy
to a certain degree. Experience points are
awarded for killing an enemy. Visit Lord
British and he will promote you when you
have gained sufﬁcient points.
Magic plays a crucial part in the game.
There are 26 spelk to be mastered but
before you can think about casting one,
you need to know the ingredients and mix
them in their correct proportions. There
are six main ingredients that can be
bought at any good herb shop but all the
powerful spells require mandrake o r
nightshade which are not so easily come
by. The spells range in power from simple
ones, such as healing wounds or casting a
magical light, through ﬁreballs and
assorted protections to kill and jinx -  a
jolly lit t le  tr ic k  t h a t  causes y our
opponents to attack themselves instead of
you. Everybody except ﬁghters and shep-
herds has some magical ability although
how much depends on your job and
experience level.
There is a lot of ﬁghting to be done if
you are to attain your quest. Combat takes
place on a variety of tactical displays and
you can move, attack or cast spells for
each of your characters in turn. How the
battle goes depends on what weapons
and armour your party owns and how you
deploy your forces. The use of slings and
bows, especially by the members at the
back of your party is recommended. The
monsters - over 20 different types - ﬁght
intelligently and will run away if hard
pressed leaving behind a treasure chest,
although this is frequently trapped as you
try to open it.
So what of the quest itself? The ﬁrst
part involves attaining a partial Avatar-
hood in the eight virtues- honour, valour,
humility, sacriﬁce, honesty. compassion.
justice a n d  s pirituality . T h e  s eer
Hawkwind keeps you informed as to your
progress and should be visited frequently.
At the appropriate time, you have to go
and meditate at a shrine - provided that
you have found the correct rune to gain
you admission and have learned the
apposite mantra to chant. Only then will
you be granted a vision. Apart from that,
you will need to ﬁnd some coloured
stones - I found the red one on the eight
level of Dungeon Destard. After that, I
don't know apart from the fact that there
will be some ﬁnal conﬂict in a place
known only as the Abyss.
Other things to look out for are secret
passages (which abound in castles and
dungeons) and the guild where you will
need to purchase magical keys and gems
(very useful for mapping dungeons). A
sextant will also be an essential purchase-

The display is in three main boxes. A
large map displays your current position
(line of sight vision only). The top right
hand box displays the statistics for you and

for command entry and as a general

which usually only require a single word.
The game comes beautifully packaged
with tw o large books, a map and a

Ultima IV is a superb game and streets
ahead of any of its rivals. To date. I have
played it for well over 60 hours and still
feel that I have only scratched the surface
of it. If you only buy one game this year,
make sure it's Ultima IV.

Alien Webb takes youl
l
[your quest to master
[machine code.
LAST MONTH WL STARTED TO
look at the various ways of mov-
inv data about. Whils t w e
concentrated on the screen,
the principles apply equally to
movement of data anywhere. I
hope you found the homework
easy. With t he material w e
covered last time, you should
be able to come up with two or
three s olutions  t o  eac h
problem.
First. I wanted a routine to
put a row of stars along the top
of t he screen. Here is  one
solution:
10 ASSEMBLE 100, I
100 REM * -
110 REM LDA i19
120 REM JSR SFED2
130 REM WY £0
140 REM WA [42
150 REM .LOOP: JSR SEEM
160 RLM INY
170 REM CPY E40
180 REM BNE LOOP
190 REM RTS
200 REM
This uses the print character
routine i n  R O M  t o  pr int
asterisks to the screen at the
current cursor position. Lines
110 and 120 pr int  HO ME
(CHRS(19)). I used this method
since there is no need to worry
about updating t h e  c olour
matrix. Those of you with old
ROM 64s will n o  doubt be
aware that when you set the
cursor c olour , t h e  c olour
matrix is  not updated. That
means that if you move data
direct to the screen memory,
you will not necessarily get the
colours you want. New ROM
64s have had this ﬁxed.
1he second problem asked
you to print the character set
on the screen. Here is  my
solution:
10 ASSEMBLE 100,1
100 REM •=SC000
W E L C O M E  T O  T H E
110 REM LDY EO
120 REM .LOOP: TYA
130 REM STA E0400, Y
140 REM IDA ﬂ
150 REM STA $D800, Y
160 REM INY
170 REM BNE LOOP
180 REM !US
190 REM 1
In this routine, I have used
simple in d e x in g  t o  p u t
characters at the start of the
screen memory. Since I don't
want t o  change the address
indexed, indirect indexing is
unnecessary. There ar e 256
characters with POKE values
ranging from /ero to 255. I use
this fact in line 120 by using the
Y register t o  update t h e
character to be POKEd. Lines
140 and 150 take care of the
colour matrix for  old ROM
routines. The Basic equivalent
to this routine is:
10 FOR I = 0 to 255
20 POKE 1024+1, I
30 POKE 55296,1
40 NEXT I
Line 170 acts in a slightly
different way to the looping
we've used previously, but I'll
cover that shortly.
There i s  o n e  m o r e
addressing mode which you
should be aware of. This is an
infrequently used mode called
Pre-Indexed Indirect Address-
ing. This mode uses the X
register to look for an address
in a  table and act o n the
address. The mnemonic for this
mode has the form:
(address,X)
where address is a zero page
location. H e r e  a r e  s ome
examples:
LDA (SFB,X)
STA (SSAA,X)
IN operation takes a little
understanding, b u t  her e is
what it does. Imagine that you
have a table of 16 bit addresses
stored as a table in zero page
starting at SAA.
$AA low byte address 1
SAB high byte address 1
SAC low byte address 2
SAD high byte address 2
SAE low byte address 3
SAT high byte address 3
and so on...
Amon&
It X contains the value zero,
the instruction I D A  (SAA•X)
does the following:
1) Adds the contents of X (i.e.
zero) to the address IAA to give
SAA.
2) the accumulator is loaded by
the contents o f  the address
held in the resulting byte pair
IAA and SAB.
Similarly, if X contains two,
then the accumulator will be
loaded with the contents of the
address pointed at by SAE,SAE.
This is not an addressing
mode that you will use often,
but it's worth knowing about,
in case you have a need for it
one day.
Last month, I  introduced
the u s e  o f  c o n d it io n a l
branchng. At that time, it was
simply to allow us t o  make
progress a n d  I  made n o
attempt to discuss it at length. It
is now necessary to look at it in
some depth.
In the microprocessor is a
register c alled t h e  Status
Register. This eight bit register
is used to hold seven ﬂags, each
using one bit. The ﬂags held are
as follows:
i) The Carry Flag (C)
This ﬂag is  used t o  carry
in f o r m a t io n  o n  w h i c h
arithmetic operations  a r e
performed. If, for example., two
numbers are added to give a
result greater than 256, the
carry ﬂag is set so that you can
take appropriate action. We'll
discuss this when I deal with 16
bit arithmetic.
ii) The Overﬂow Flag (V)
Only the ﬁrst seven bits are
used f o r  holding data, the
eighth being a sign bit. Hence
only numbers in the range +127
to - 1 2 7 a r e  us ed. I f  a n
operation attempts t o  store
greater than +127, then the
overﬂow ﬂag is set. Again,we'll
discuss at a later date.
iii) The Negative Flag (N)
This is set if an operation results
in a negative answer.
iv) The Decimal Flag (0)
This is set if you wish to work in
decimal (BCD) mode.
vi) The Interrupt Flag (I)
Set if an interrupt is in progress.
vii) The Zero Flag (l)
Set if an arithmetic operation
gives a zero result.
The branch instructions test
the status of  a ﬂag and act
accordingly. The instructions
provided are:
BCS — branch if carry ﬂag is set
BCC — branch if carry ﬂag is
clear
BEC? — branch if zero ﬂag is set
BNE — branch if zero ﬂag is
clear
BMI — branch if negative ﬂag is
set
BPL b r a n c h  if negative ﬂag is
clear
BVC b r a n c h  if overﬂow ﬂag
is clear
BVS br anc h if overﬂow ﬂag is
set
You will generally use these
instructions directly after an
arithmetic operation. [he most
usual are:
CMP —  this  compares the
accumulator t o  data o r  the
contents of a location.
CPY — compares the Y register
to data.
CPX — X analogue to CPY,

C 6 4
These three instructions
perform a  non-destructive
comparison by subtracting the
data fr om t he register and
updating t h e  s tatus  ﬂag
accordingly depending o n
whether the result is  zero,
positive or negative.
Register =  Data — set carry
ﬂag
Register =  Data — set zero
ﬂag
Negative register is changed by
the sign bit.
So to detect various results, you
use:
Register =  data — use BCS,
e.g.
CMP £4
BCS LOOP
br anc hes  o f  L O O P  i f
accumulator holds  f o u r  o r
more.
Register d a t a  — use BCC,
e.g.
CPY ﬂO
BCC LOOP
branches to LOOP if Y register
holds less than 10.
Register data — use BEQ. e.g.
CPX £6
BEQ LOOP
branches if X register holds six.
Register d a t a  — use BNE.
e.g.
CMP f 3
BNE LOOP
branches if accumulator does
not hold three.
If you now look back at last
month's examples you will see
how these tests ar e used.
Arithmetic instructions such as
INY,INX,INC,DEY,DEX,DEC
change the negative and zero
ﬂags depending on the result.
(INC and DEC increment and
decrement a memory location
by one.)
My answer to question two
from last month's homework
uses this  effect, Line 160
increments the counter. When
it reaches 255, adding one
more will result in zero, Since
this signiﬁes that w e  have
ﬁnished, I use BEQ in line 170 to
detect this situation.
Now w e ' v e  c o lle c t e d
together the basic tools, let's
start wr iting s ome dec ent
routines. In the last part, we
discussed t h e  us e o f  NO P
instructions to create delays. To
achieve m o r e  substantial
pauses we need to use more
complex routines. Here is a
simple delay routine:
100 ASSEMBLE 110.1
110 REM *=$C000
120 REM LDX f$10
130 REM .1.00P1: LDY 1$10
140 REM 100P2: DEY
150 REM BNE 1.00P2
160 REM DEX
170 REM BNE LOOP1
180 REM RTS
This routine uses a pair of
nested loops to wait a short
lime. The values loaded into
the X and Y registers in lines 120
and 130 decide the delay. Lines
140 and 150 count down the Y
register to zero. This process is
then repeated the number of
times in the X register. The
Basic equivalent of this routine
would be a pair of nested loops
such as:
FOR X=0 TO 10: 1 OR Y=0 TO
10: NEXT Y„X
An alternative method is to
call the routine at SEEB3. This
routine generates a  o n e
millisecond delay.
Let's use this delay routine
to generate a synapse tweaking
pattern. Consider the routine:
100 ASSEMBLE 110,1
110 REM *=$C000
120 REM LDA 16
130 REM STA 998
140 REM I DA  E4
150 REM STA 999
160 REM .LOOP: INC $D020
170 REM INC 1000
180 REM JSR DELAY
190 REM JSR $FIE1
200 REM BEQ FINISH
210 REM IMP LOOP
220 REM .FINISH: RTS
230 REM .DELAY: LDX 998
240 REM 1 0 0 P 2 : LDY 999
250 REM 1 0 0 P 1 : DEY
260 REM BNE LOOP1
270 REM DEX
280 REM BNE LOOP2
290 REM RTS
300 REM I
You'll immediately recog-
nise lines 250 onwards as being
our delay routine. The delay
55
parameters a r e  h e l d  i n
locations 998 and 999 rather
than being loaded as direct
values. The line 120 to 150 set
up the delay parameters. The
core of the routine is lines 160
to 210. I t  is an inﬁnite loop
which changes the colour of
the border, delays a bit and
then l o o p s  b a c k .  T h e
subroutine call in line 19 tests
the RUN/STOP key. If this key
is pressed, then the Z ﬂag is set.
Line 200 checks this and stops if
the ﬂag is  set. Try messing
about with the delay values and
see the effect. If you use a bit of
care and possibly the odd NOP
to ﬁne tune it, you may be able
to g e t  s o m e  s tar ionar y
coloured bands in the border.
The next, and last example,
is a little more useful:
100 ASSEMBLE 110.1

Again t he delay routine
uses two locations to hold the
parameters. T his  r o u t in e
simulates a device rather like
the "vidiprinter" used on the
Saturday afternoon football
results service o n  T V.  A
message i s  s lowly  pr inted
across t h e  screen w i t h  a
ﬂashing asterisk cursor. The
routine is quite simple.
Line 160 zeros the Y register
which will act as our counter.
Lines 170 and 180 print an
asterisk in the top left hand
corner of the screen. Lines 190
and 200 update the colour
matrix for you folks with old
ROM machines. The next three
lines force a delay. The TYA and
TAY either side of the call to the
delay loop save the contents of
the Y register since it is used in
the delay. Lines 240 and 250
erase the asterisk with a space
and we wait a while longer.
Finally, lines 290 and 310 take a
letter from the table and put it
on the screen. Line 300 checks
for a zero value in the table.
This is used to mark the end of
the table so that the routine
stops at the end of the message.
Line 3 5 0  inc rements  t h e
counter and provided that we
dont go over a value of 255,
line 3611 sends us back for the
next character,
I realise that I'm spending a
lot of time explaining how the
routines work. As we progress.
I will make briefer comments
since you should soon be able
to s us s  t h in g s  o u t  f o r
yourselves.
OK, homework time, First, I
want a routine which will ﬁll
the entir e screen w it h  a
speciﬁed character. I  don't
expect the best solution but
I've told y ou enough for a
crude but effective routine.
Secondly, I want a routine
which will more a block of data
from the top line of the screen
to, say, the 20th line. A single
line of data will sufﬁce but you
can easily move u to 256 bytes.
This s o r t  o f  r o u t i n e  i s
frequently used in a range of
situations.
Finally, how about a routine
•
which will scroll the top line of
the screen one step to the right
with t h e  leftmost character
replaced with a space?
Next month we'll explore

The supply of new educational software
seems to have dried up, so I decided to
look around the local shops to see what
was on offer. The answer seems to be, very
little. The reasons for this could be
threefold:
1. My hometown is poor for shops selling
software.
2. The storeowners are very cautious
about stocking educational software.
3. There may genuinely be little software.
I suspect that notwithstanding the
claims of the value of computers for
education, the reality is that education is
poor business. Much more money can be
made by selling games. The majority of
games only require good programming
whilst educational material requires
detailed teaching knowledge as well as
programming ability. These rather
disappointing facts of life were only too
evident at the last PCW show where a
number of exhibitors stated that they
were no longer interested in educational
software since it had no future. This is all
rather sad since quite a  lot of the
important pre-school spade work can be
carried Out with computer assistance with
the software acting as a type of expert
system (parents aren't always teachers).
For the older children, software can be
used to provide revision material and to
support conventional didactic methods.
Whilst rummaging through the shops,
however, I did see an interesting item.
Not a new product, this is a triple pack of
Hill MacGibbon software for a touch less
than the original price of one. Hill
MacGibbon is an interesting company in
that it has produced software for most of
the popular computers. In some of these
packages there has been collaboration
with well known companies such as
Collins and Pan.
In light of this, this is a good time to
take a  look at which packages are
available for the C64. The triple pack
contains Ballooning, Car Journey and
Secret Agent. Between them they provide
quite a comprehensive package, each
coming with a colour booklet dealing
with diverse aspects of the topic and ideas
for further work.
Ballooning
The title is self explanatory. The booklet
deals with the historical aspects of
mono
ballooning and then goes on to look at the
Hindenburg disaster and how a hot air
balloon works, The ability to read and use
a map is very important when ﬂying a
balloon and this topic is also covered. The
software provides a balloon simulator
with controls showing y o u r
(it's a hot air balloon), rate of climb and
atmospheric temperature. Using the
information given on the instruments,
you must guide the balloon over varying
terrain. In this way, ballooning covers
aspects such as physics, map-reading,
mathematics and geography.
Car Journey
This would appear to be a misnomer since
the software involves the operation of a
light haulage business. In it you must run
the ﬁrm and keep it ﬁnancially viable. This
is done by judiciously securing contracts
to move goods from point to point and
selecting the optimum routes. You get
bonuses or  penalties depending on
whether to keep to the time limits.
Naturally, you must attempt to choose
• contracts which end up at the starting
points of other contracts. It doesn't pay to
run a n empty truck 1 Different size
vehicles are available to suit different size
consignments.
The accompanying booklet deals with
aspects of the car, how it works and its
history. It also covers the history of roads
and transport and the motorway system. A
nice touch is an extract from Toad of Toad
Hall describing Toad's discovery of the
joys of  motoring. The pack covers
reading, mathematics, geography and
mechanics.
Special Agent
This package puts you in the shoes of a
budding James Bond searching Europe
for the dastardly enemy agent who's gaily
killing off your operatives. The game
centres around a map of Europe showing
the major cities. From time to time
intelligence reports ﬂash up at the foot of
the screen. Some of these are in code
presenting additional problems. You
must act on the received information and
travel from city to city. You must choose
your trains and planes from timetables.
As usual, the booklet covers subjects
connected with the central theme. You
are introduced t o the elements of
as
cryptography, the capital cities of Europe
and a little information on real life spies is
given. I t  covers geography, reading,
lateral thought and some mathematics.
Hill MacGibbon also offers a number
of packages covering more speciﬁc
subjects. Teaching the mechanics of
reading isn't that much of a problem
since children generally soon grasp the
form of words. What is more difﬁcult to
grasp and contributes most t o the
subtleties of  English is punctuation.
Punctuation Pete is a program intended to
help in this area. The child is presented
with a graded piece of text which has had
all punctuation and capital letters
removed. The child must read the text and
attempt to punctuate it so that the
meaning is clear. When he feels that all is
ﬁnished, the program marks the result
showing any mistakes. Surprisingly,
ﬁnding the correct punctuation is quite
tricky.
Technically, the program is slick with
large legible text and the use of an
animated man as the cursor. I highly
recommend it.
The last two programs are for the
younger child. First, there is Picture
Builder. As the name suggests, this
program allows the manipulation of basic
shapes such as squares, circles and
triangles for the creation of pictures. The
shapes can be stretched, shrunk, rotated
and painted to give the required effect.
Multicolour mode is used to allow up to
four colours. For those of you with
printers, there is a hard copy facility —
nicely done and easy to use.
Finally, we have Run Rabbit Run. This
is a simple game played on a matrix of
squares, rather like a board game. You
must guide a number of rabbits to their
homes and away from the hungry fox. The
game tells you how many squares your
rabbits may jump on each move. These
jumps must be distributed between the
rabbits. There are bushes in which the
rabbits can hide, if the fox isn't there ﬁrst.
The game ends when all rabbits are home
or have been eaten.
This game is quite tough and forces the
child to use a little logic, lateral thought
and some counting skills.
The impressive features about Hill
MacGibbon software are that a  high
standard of programming is used and
there is a decent level of content. Unlike
some educational material, there is
evidence of real teaching input.

P Green brings you
some hints on saying
time and memory.
TIME AND MEMORY CAN BE
wasted when a Basic program
contains a lot of numerical data
statements. T h i s  a r t ic le
suggests ways in which you can
save both, even on programs
copied from magazines.
The Facts and Figures
If you have a lot of numerical
data to be stored, there is a
fairly quick and easy way to
save time and memory. Save
the block of memory straight
on to the disk or tape and get
the Basic program to load this
data straight in t o  memory
instead of POKEing it in.
Time i s  saved b y  t his
method because when you use
data statements w it h in  a
program, you must ﬁrst load
the data in Basic form and then
run the program to POKE the
data into memory. This takes 12
seconds for the ﬁrst half of the
operation a n d  s ix  f o r  t h e
second half for  each 1K o f
memory when using a  disk
drive. Alternatively, to transfer
the data straight into memory
from disk takes only ﬁve sec-
onds for each 1K of memory. Of
course, t he saving is  much
greater- if you are using tape
since tape loading is a much
more lengthy process.
Memory can be saved, both
in the computer and on the
disk or tape. In the computer,
1K of directly entered data, of
course, takes u p  just 1K o f
memory. On the disk or tape, it
takes up just over 1K of storage
space. On the disk, this is ﬁve
blocks. In the case of Basic data
statements, besides occupying
the 1K of memory once the
program has been run, the
Basic data als o takes u p
memory -  just under 3K. Al-
together this method actually
uses just under 4K of memory.
On the disk or tape, it takes up
well over 3K of storage space -
that is, 15 blocks on the disk.
Saving the Data
So, ﬁrstly, how can we save a
block o f  memor y ? A n d
secondly, how can we get our
Basic program to load it again?
DATA, TIME
°MEMORY
This can be done in two
ways. You can use a machine
code monitor to save an area of
memory. To do this you will
have to get the start address of
the block of memory that you
wish to save and then calculate
the end address and add one.
Your m a c h i n e  c o d e
monitor, of course, must not
occupy the same area as the
memory which y ou wish t o
save.
The procedure should be as
follows;
1. Load and r un t he Basic
program. or at least the part
which POKEs the data into
memory.
2. New the Basic program and
load t h e  ma c h in e  c o d e
monitor.
3. O n  mos t machine code
monitors, the instructions to
save a  block o f  memory is
something like:
S "ﬁle name",C000,C200,08
This will save the block o f
memory from $C000 (the start
address) t o  SC1U (the end
address) on a disk drive with
the device number of 8 or 08
hex (01 f o r  tape) w it h  a
ﬁlename "SPRITES
choose the ﬁlename although
you do not actually need one
for ﬁles saved on tape).
4. You may need to save more
than one block o f  data, for
instance, a block of character
data at 12288 and a block of
machine code data at 49152. All
you need to do for this is to
repeat instruction three for the
new block of data, bearing in
mind that for disks you will
need a different ﬁlename.
Another and possibly easier
method i s  t o  alter certain
pointers in the zero page of
memory so that you fool the
computer into thinking that the
block that you wish to save is a
Basic program. The locations to
note are 43 to 46 inclusive.
Locations 43 and 44 are the low
58
and high bytes of the start of
Basic which are normally one
and e i g h t  r es pec tiv ely .
( 2 5 6
Basic area). Locations 45 and 46
are the low and high bytes of
the start of variables which is
normally the end of the Basic
program Plus one.
The procedure is as follows:
1. Calculate the start and end of
the block of memory which
you wish to save, not forgetting
to add one to the end.
2. Calculate the high and low
bytes from these ﬁgures in
decimal.
3. Run the Basic program. or
the section of it that POKEs the
data into memory.
4. In direct mode, POKE in
these ﬁgures into locations 43
to 46.
5. Save the block of memory by
typing in SAVE "ﬁlename",13.1
or SAVE "ﬁlename",1,1
6. Repeat this for other blocks
of memory if necessary.
The Basic Loader
Now that you have saved your
block of memory, how do you
get your program to load it
again automatically? There are
two ways in which you can do
this. The ﬁrst is to write a short
machine code routine to load
the blocks o f  memory. The
second is to add one or more
lines to the beginning of your
Basic program. The machine
code method requires a n
understanding o f  h o w  t h e
KERNAL load routine works
and would take too long to
describe here. Instead, I will
concentrate on describing the
Basic method.
It is actually very easy to get
your Basic program to do the
loading f o r  you. T he most
important thing to remember is
that once the ﬁrst block of
memory has been loaded, the
program will start again from
the beginning and if you do not
do something to prevent it, the
same block w ill b e  loaded
again and again.
The ﬁrst thing to do is save a
copy of the full program, data
statements and all, i n  case
sornthing goes wrong, and
keep it safe. Next, remove the
data statements and the READ-
POKE routine and any error
traps, and save the program
again.
The ﬁrst line of the program
can be used to load the block of
memory by using a line such as:
10 X=X+1 IFX=1THENLOAD
"ﬁlename",8,1
This ﬁlename is the same as
the one you used to save the
block of memory. If a tape is
used, then ﬁrst change the
eight to a one, and then, don't
use a ﬁlename. The ﬁgure one
after the eight or one is re-
quired so that the block of
memory goes back to whence
it came.
If there is more than one
block o f  memory t o  load,
another lin e  needs t o  b e
added, as follows:
20 I F  X=2THENLOAD" 2nd
ﬁlename",8,1 etc.
or, in the case of tape, the ﬁrst
line can become:
10 X=X+1 IF X 3THENLOAD"
",1,1
Do not use a ﬁlename. This
will load the ﬁrst two blocks of
memory found on the tape.
The way in which the loader
works, is as follows:
1. When the program is run,
X=0.
2. Al line 1, X becomes 1 and
the ﬁrst load takes place.
3. After the load, the program
starts again at line 10 but the
variable X is still 1. Therefore X
becomes 2 and since this is not
equal t o  1 ,  t h e  program
continues to the next line.
4. This will go on until all the
blocks of memory have been
loaded and the rest o f  the
program can continue.

R e v i e w
FONT
Evelyn Mills looks at a new
product from Impex.
THE FONT FACTORY (FF) IS APTI.N
named and works hard for you, doing
overtime at your request!
Firstly the requirements are a disk
drive, printer and word processor. The
printer should, for preference. be the
Commodore Vic 1525/MPS 801 although
directions are given for using a printer
interface emulating the MPS 801 or 803. It
is claimed that FF will work with most
word processors with open sequential
ﬁles and I have used Easyscript through-
out with no problems; however it would
be worthwhile doing a double-check with
the distributors before purchase if you
have another word processor as some do
not link up.
Noticeably t her e i s  n o  manual
supplied with FF; instead the program
gets to work right away printing out full
instructions using the directions given.
The resulting 16 page manual is in two
parts -  one for Font Factory and one for
Signwriter 64. Both are very well written
and the full concepts of the programs are
easily understood - no hidden complaints
here!
Before using FF ,create a ﬁle document
with your word processor and save this to
disk. There is no necessity to use the
commands of your processor other than
direct typing mode. However and this is
most important - your MUST enter • ii fni'
at the beginning followed by (return).
Should you wish to use a different font in
the middle of your document, insert a
new ' Oln2 header, followed by (return).
FF has eight in-built fonts with which to
play around.
Having saved your ﬁle to disk, load FF
and let it take over. Initially I suggest that
you use option three t o  print y our
document (there are plenty of screen
instructions to help you along), Essentially
FF will ask you to deﬁne your ﬁrst font by
selection from a list of eight; this will then
be processed for you. The second font
style will then be requested and FF gets
back to work. When you have deﬁned the
number of fonts in your document, a
simple (return) will exit you to the next
option. If you select the parameters given
on the screen (a good idea initially) insert
your document when told to do so and FF
will print your letter in the fonts selected.
very simple indeed and very effective.
There are eight in built fonts including
Micro, Bold. Roman, Gothic and, most
important of all, the Descender. The latter
gives you 'true type face' of a high quality
as its name implies.
FF is full of options using normal or
double width letters and has a  very
comprehensive lis t  o f  embedded
commands for  centering, setting line
width, left and right margins, optional
page numbering and line spacing. All
these commands are speedily screen
controlled, Fonts may also be changed
within y o u r  doc ument ( d id  I  s ay
versatile?).
More to come. You may deﬁne your
own fonts, if desired, or edit existing ones.
The whole process is extremely easy to
use and 15 fonts may then be accessed at
any one time within your document,
including the in built fonts. Instructions
are clear, concise and readily handled.
In effect you can create an entire
character set or change characters from
an existing set; if you do not like the A in
Gothic font then change it! If you want to
design the Greek alphabet - do it!
FF also has a signi.vriter program which
may be loaded independently. Here again
instructions are readily handled, when
complemented with the manual. This
functions independently o f  a  w or d
processor. character widths are Normal.
Skinny or Double width and the output
has t w o  options; o n e  selects pr int
according to the printing characters in
your slogan while the other selects solid
line printing (note -  the word cat in
normal width prints a banner around two
feet long!) F5 will stop the printer if you
have been too enthusiastic.
As in FF, fonts may be changed and
stored on disk. There is one Standard fon
in signwriter.
I see no problems in this program.
consider it excellent value for money and
doubt if you will be disappointed with its
performance.
A really professional tool, agreeahly
prices and certainly "user friendly"

to add to
This month we are pleased to
print t h r e e  s hor t u t ilit y
programs. The First of these
comes from Steven Freeman
from Orpington and is a list
utility.
How often have you tried to
list a program on the screen of
your C64 only to have the line
that you want scroll off the top
of the screen before you can
read it? OK so you can slow this
listing down with the CTRL key
but the program still scrolls.
Steven's handy routine alters
the speed of the LIST command
by changing the list vectors so
that it jumps to a short machine
code routine in spare memory
(locations 679 to 702). Line 30 of
the Basic loader contains the
POKE that alters the speed of
the list, you can change this if
required. The other controls
are:
CI To pause the listing
13 To slow down the listing
For all of those people who
have stored machine c ode
prOgrams o n  tape only  t o
forget where they  load i n
memory, M r  K Peppin from
Little Neston has provided an
extremely handy Tape Header
Reader program. The routine is
very handy  f o r  locating a
machine code program and
giving its length.
This routine is reliant on a
machine code call to the Kemal
ROM which searches for any
header t o  a  program. The
information is then stored in

the cassette buffer, address
828-1019, where it can be easily
used
The ﬁnal routine in  this
monthrs Scratchpad is a very
handy cassette tape catalogue
system from N V Newen from
Oxford_ T he objec t o f  the
program is to allow easy access
to e i t h e r  p r o g r a m s  o r
subroutines stored on a master
cassette.
The program as it stands will
store 10 sections of approx 8K
in length on a C60 cassette but
this c ould quite easily b e
changed t o  s uit individual
requirements. if you use the C-
16/Plus/4 fast tape routine
from our Feb '86 issue about 10
programs of 25K can be saved.
The data can be altered to suit
the names of your programs.
Don't for get t o  p u t  t h e
program number at the start of
each line as it is this that you
will have to press to access that
ﬁle.

you how to kill the
WELCOME BACK T O  THE
saga of the Frog. This month we
will b e  adding t he routine
which controls the status panel
at the bottom of the screen,
and the routine which kills the
Frog. Although the latter will
not function until the checking
routines are added in the next
issue.
Info
The routine begins by printing
the value of LIVES on to the
status panel. ONLY indicates
whether the frog is dead or
alive and if dead (ONLY = 1)
then we exit from the routine.
The next four instructions
print the values in FOOD and
FOOD+1 and the following
seven use the X register as an
index to point to the ﬁve digits
of MURES and SCORE and to
place them correctly on the
screen.
One of the features of the
game is that it becomes more
difﬁcult as you progress, and
this is achieved by increasing
the speed of the BIRD and the
FLY. Their speed is increased by
a small amount every time
another 100 points is scored.
The next two lines store the
current digit in the 100 column
of the score into NXTHLJN. The
code which carries out the
increase in speed appears later
i n the routine.
Lines 10010 t o  10100
decrease the two byte delay
METDEL a n d  METDEL2 t o
check whether another metre
has passed. If not then we jump
to FOD, which simply returns
from the routine.
The next eight lines use the
X register as  a n  index  t o
int rease the METRES value. If
the d ig it  b e in g  increased
reaches nine- plus - one i n
value, (i.e. 10), then that digit is
set t o  zero, and t h e  next
highest digit i s  increased.
Mt ISPD contains the value
which i s placed hack into

METDEL2, so by changing this
value (line 1360) you can adfust
the distance that must b e
travelled before the value of
METRES is increased.
The same principle used for
increasing the metres is used
next to decrease FOOD and
increase SCORE,
Which brings us to 0K24, If
the v alue o f  NXTHLIN i s
different to the current value of
SCORE+2, then it  is time to
decrease t h e  delays whic h
control the speeds of the BIRD
and FLY, BRDSPD and FLSPD.
Finally they are checked t o
ensure that their values have
not decreased too far.
Dead
This routine prints the dead
frog and decreases the value of
LIVES.
I he ﬁrst step is to check
whether the variable DED has
been s et b y  t h e  collision
routines which we will add next
issue.
Lines 10820 to 10850 set up
the sprite deﬁnitions to point
to the correct sprites for a dead
frog. 10860 to 11010 simply ;et
up the correct X and Y co-
ordinates of the frog he would
look pretty silly hovering in
mid air!). Next the colours are
set up in lines 11020 to 11040.
Now the interesting bit!
Remember t h e  inter r upt
handling routine, 'HANDLE'
that we added in the second
article? Well, unless we stop
this from being called, the dead
frog w ill c ontinue mov ing
(actually t h e  bac k ground
would move, not the frog),
To stop this from happen-
ing, w e point the interrupt
vector at $0314 and $0315 to the
end o f  t h e  r outine, thus
executing no code.

1This month David Janda
begins a look at C — a very
L
language.
C IS AN  APPLICATIONS LANGUAGE.
That is, it's used by programmers to write a
variety of programs such as text editors,
programming utilities and such like. It is
also the 'ﬂavour of the day' in the micro
world. Partly because of the popularity of
the UNIX operating system (of which C is
the language) and partly because of other
features such as its compactness, porta-
bility and speed of execution.
The good thing about C is that it is a
language f o r  programmers. M a n y
programming languages get designed by
committee, but not C. C has gained its
popularity not because of any hype or
backing from a government (as the USA
has backed ADA), but because program-
mers LIKE C.
So what is C, what can you do with it,
and how good is it?
Why C?
C has many virtues. I t  is  a  modern
language whic h incorporates modern
control features. It is  also a compact
language; C  can be installed on small
micros - such as the 64 - and the code that
it produces is compact and fast. Another
beneﬁt of C is that it is portable. We have
all heard claim that this or that language is
portable, only to discover that a major re-
write is necessary before a program can
be run on a different system. But with C it
really i s  portable between different
computers. If any changes to the source
code are necessary, it  usually means
altering a few lines in a 'header* ﬁle which
can accompany the main program.
For those of you who are interested in
the 'real' world of programming, it is
worth noting that C is the programming
language of the UNIX operating system.
UNIX is already an accepted operating
system in the PC world, and the EEC have
decided t o  adopt i t  as their ofﬁcial
operating system.
C i s  a  compiled language. T he
program (referred to as source code) is
ﬁrst written using a text editor or word
processor. T he source c ode is  then

submitted t o  t h e  c ompiler, whic h,
providing their are no errors, will compile
the program into machine code and store
it as a ﬁle which is called the object code.
The steps in developing a C program
are a bit more complex than what was
mentioned above, but it should give you a
rough idea.
Here is a small C program:
1) # include <:stdici.h
2) main () /* This is a demo */
3
4) int num;
5) num = 1;
6) printf ("I am a simple");
7) printf ("computer. \ n");
8) printf ("My favourite number is %d
because it is ﬁrst. \ n",num);
9)
This will print to the screen:
I am a simple computer.
My favourite number is 1 because it is ﬁrst.
On a line analysis, this is what the
program does (note line numbers are not
part of C). Line one tells the compiler to
incorporate information found in the ﬁle
stdio.h. Every C program must incorpo-
rate at least one function, and line two
identiﬁes the function called main (the
parentheses are there to identify main as a
function). T h e  open c ur ly  bracket
identiﬁes the beginning of the function
body. Line four is a declaration statement,
here the variable num has been declared
of the type integer. In line ﬁve num has
been assigned with the value one and
lines six to eight print the output.
Line nine indicates the end of the
function.
The '%d' instructs the micro where
and in what form the value held in num is
going to be displayed_ The \  n means
new-line carriage-return.
In next month's article I shall explain
data types and control structures.

C Power V2.4 by P r o
Software Ltd
To the best of my knowledge., thec power
package is the only C compiler available
in the UK so far. By the time you read this a
cheaper package called Super C should
be available from First Software. The
reason f o r  t his  longer-than-normal
review is to give you an idea of what the
package offers and is capable of, as it is not
the cheapest available!
On with the review! C  Power is a
complete C development package that
will enable the user to produce stand-
alone C  programs. Mo s t  language
packages available for the 64 fall into one
of two categories: educational or deve-
lopment. Educational packages (such as
the ADA tutorial) do not offer a com-
prehensive package that can be used to
develop software. Instead, the emphasis is
on introducing the user to the language.
Development packages o n  the other
hand (such as OCS and Orpheus Pascal)
offer an excellent package, but are not
too good when it comes to documenta-
tion. I  was therefore surprised with C
Power, because it is a very 'full' compiler
offering lots  o f  facilities as well as
providing an excellent tutorial book that
used in conjunction with the compiler
will enable beginners t o  learn t h e
I anguage.
The package itself consists of a double
sided disk which contains the compiler,
shell, libraries and example programs. A
44 page user guide gives details on the
compiler and very little else. The big plus
is the C Primer Plus book that is also
supplied with the package, and which can
be regarded as a complete tutorial to C.
Implementation Details
One of the beneﬁts of C is its portability -
the ability to run C programs that were
written on other machines. Because of
this compatability is an important factor
when developing a C package. Pro-Line

P r o g r a m m i n g

has got a very compatible package with C
Power, but of course, there are some
differences.
In brief, the omissions from standard C
are: n o  bit ﬁeld manipulation; static
pointers may not be initialised except for
character points initialised with strings;
certain operators under certain condi-
tions will not work unless the expressions
are parenthesised. M o s t  o f  thes e
omissions are not serious, and can be got
round quite easily.
The following table lists the size, in
bytes of all data types supported by the
compiler:
Type 
S
i
z
e
char 
1
short 
2
int 
2
long 
2
unsigned 
2
ﬂoat 
5
double 
5
pointer 
2
Looking at the table, you can see that
types short, int and long are the same, as
are ﬂoat and double. This practice is not
uncommon in micro implementations of
C. but is a strange one. For a package of
this price I would have expected to see
long and double supported.
The library supplied with the C Power
compiler is quite standard. However, it
would have been a good idea to include
functions dependent on the 64, such as
some sound and graphics functions.
Documentation
The user manual is supplied as sheets of
paper which is stapled near the top.
Punch holes enable the manual to be
ﬁtted into a ring binder, which is a good
suggestion as my copy started to fall to bits
after a  short while. The manual itself
makes no attempt to teach or introduce
the user to C -  that's left to the tutorial
book. Instead t h e  manual provides
information on the implementation of C
Power and descriptions of the editor,
compiler, linker and so on. One section
lists the functions provided with the
library that is part of the package. The
majority of functions are listed with name,
number, order and types the function
takes, description of the function and an
example. A good idea this, as it will enable
the us er who wishes to port C source
from another machine, to check up on
functions to see if they are compatible.
The book 'C Primer Plus' by Waite,
Praia & Martin (Sams, $19.95, ISBN 0-672-
22090-3) is supplied with the C Power
package. Q uite simply i t  is  the best
language tutorial book I have ever read!
This hefty tome (531 pages) takes the
reader from the concept of programming
right up to detailed discussion on C I/O.
What's more, it is well written in a friendly
(and amusing) manner with plenty of illu-
strations, summary pages and so on. Even
if you don't intend to get the C Power
package get this book!
C Power in Use
The user manual suggests that the system
disk should be backed up. To do this, the
shell, editor, syntax checker, linker and so
on should be copied on to one disk.
Another disk should be used to copy the
ﬂip side of the system disk; this contains
the Stdlib.1 and Syslib.1 function libraries.
TABLE 1 — COMMANDS SUPPORTED BY THE SHELL
list work disk directory
Is l i s t  system disk directory
rm s c r a t c h  ﬁle from work disk
my r e n a m e  ﬁle on work disk
pr l i s t  contents of a ﬁle on work disk

cc c o m p i l e  C source

NOTE: All the commands are followed by
arguments such as ﬁle names, drive or
device numbers.
65
The compiler itself is copy protected (not
very well though) so once working copies
are made, three disks should be at hand:
One containing the shell etc; another the
libraries; and the third being the master
disk.
The SHELL is the ﬁrst program that is
run when using C Power. SHELL itself is a
mini-command interpreter. I t  supports
command line arguments and I/O  re-
direction along with the compiler and
other programs that are designed to work
under it. The nearest comparison would
be Basic's screen editor, which can be
used to develop, edit and run programs as
well as issue I/O commands (such as disk
directory, opening ﬁles  etc ). T h e
command available from the Shell are
listed in Table 1.
Entering some C  source code ﬁrst
requires the editor to be loaded and run.
This is  simple done by  entering 'ed'
(optionally followed by a ﬁle name if an
existing ﬁle is to be amended). The editor
is a very comprehensive bit of code that
provides numerous  commands f o r
moving about the text buffer. Once the
code is written it can then be saved to
disk. A syntax checker is also provided
which does what its name suggests -
checks the syntax of a C source ﬁle. The
program is listed as it is being checked,
and will stop if an error in syntax is found.
If this is the case, a couple of key presses
and you are back into the editor at the
place where the error was found. Need-
less to say that the editor, syntax checker
and all the other Shell commands are
written in C!
The next stage is to invoke the com-
piler by entering cc ﬁlename. This loads
and runs the compiler which produces an
object code ﬁle.
The ﬁrst stage is to load and run the
linker. This will produce a runable ﬁle and
three options are available. First it  is
possible to produce a C program that will
run under the Shell (just like the Shell
commands). It is also possible to specify a
starting address, this means that the C
program will have to be loaded and a SYS
call made to the starting address. The third
option is to produce a ﬁle that starts at the
start of Basic.
Summary
Without a doubt C Power is a very power-
ful package. It is quite feasible that it can
be us ed t o  dev elop c ommer c ial
programs, and its numerous features give
the user a great deal of ﬂexibility.
The only drawback with C Power is its
price. It's a very expensive package, and I
would have expected such things as more
C64 dependent functions, long integers
and double precision ﬂoating point.
Having said that, its pros far outweigh
the cons, and I would recommend the C
Power package to the novice as well as the
professional.

William Fong adds a
little more power to
your M N
Simply type it  in  as you
would any other program and
SAVE it. When you RUN it, any
typing errors in the data will be
found and the line of the error
given. Correct any offending
lines and run again until the
program r uns  without any
errors. Do not attempt to use
the program before 411 errors
have been found or you could
cause your machine to crash.
Once the program is  in
memory you can get rid of the
loader by typing NEW, Then
type SYS 49152 t o  initialise
better matrix. A 3D title/menu
page s hould b e  displayed
showing y o u  t h e  s imple
controls that are needed to use
the program.
Trying It Out
When everything is working
type in the short program in
Figure 2. Now press function
key 3, which will give a blue
border, and RUN the program.
Not very nice is it?
Now press function key 1,
which will give a cyan border,
and RUN the program again.
This time the letters will have
descenders.
Better matrix should there-
fore give a better appearance
to many o f  y our printouts.
However, a s  eac h w o r d -
processor is  different i t  is
impossible to say whether it
will work with them loaded
into y our  machine. A t  the
moment better matrix sits at
memory location $C000 (49152)
so it will deﬁnitely not work
with progrms that use this area
of memory.
THE COMMODORE MPS 801
is an extremely popular printer
because of its cheap price. If
you a r e  o n l y  a f t e r  t h e
occasional computer listing
then it  is quite adequate. A
problem arises however if you
wish to use the MPS 801 to
produce quality text output as
none of the lower case letters
have descenders. This means
that a letter '1' would simply sit
on the same line as a letter 'a'.
This makes it very difﬁcult to
read large amounts of text.
If you want to enter the
wonderul w o r ld  o f  wor d-
BETTER
MATRIX
processing and are thinking of
trading in your MPS 801 and
purchasing a more expensive
printer then wan a  minute.
Before you take any money out
of your depleted bank account
take a look at Better Matrix.
So how does it help? Well
Better Matrix uses a  similar
method of printing as the more
expensive near letter quality
(NLQ) printers. First one part of
the letter is printed then the
printer goes back over the
letter and adds the missing
parts of the letter to the page.
By implementing this on the
MPS 801 w e  can obtain an
acceptable print resolution of
14 dots by 16 dots. Obviously
this does n o t  improve the
deﬁnition of the character, as
proper NLQ does, but it does
allow you to print characters
with descenders. Take a look at
Figure 1  whic h shows t he
normal printout of the MPS 801
compared to that of the newer
matrix.
However, printing in  this
manner does have a disadvan-
tage. As the printer has to go
over each line of text more
than once it takes a tot longer
to print out any text, this is not
only common to the MPS 801
but all NLQ printer suffer in the
same way. On the MPS 801 the
speed is  reduced fr om SO
characters per second t o 20
characters per second.
Getting It In
Better matrix is quite short and
the program is all in machin
code but is presented here in
the form of a Basic loader.

you've never heard of
t r =
[want to know how to get on I
[one — read on. David Janda 1
!shows you how.1
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF DOMINAT-
ing Communic ation C or ner  w i t h
M'Net/CNET blurb. Well, as promised,
here is ta refreshing) change. This month
the subject is bulletin boards.
A bulletin board (BB from now on) can
best be compared to a community bulle-
tin board. A BB is usually run by a hobbiest
in his/her own spare time on a home
micro with disk drive and auto-answer
modem. A BB will allow one user at a time
to browse through the ﬁles stored on the
board. These can include messages from
other users, general information, special-
ists info, you name it you can put in on a
I3B.
Compared to Micronet or Cornpunet
I.1 k n e w  I  w o u l d  me n t io n  t h e m
sometime!) BBs are not technically bril-
liant, but they are by no means crude.
One o f  the best things about using W h a t ' s  T her e?
different BB's (board-walking) is that they
are not bureaucratic, ofﬁcial or run by
money makers -  and that makes a
difference!
What Type?
The UK currently has over 200 BBs that
operate at regular times, and the number
is growing. There are basically two types
of BB from which to choose. First there is
the traditional scrolling type of BB. To
access this , y ou w ill need terminal
emulation (often referred to as dumb
terminal) software. Most comms packs
include this type of facility. In case you are
a Viewdata (Prestel) user who does not
have this type of package, Dialsoft on
page 600617160a at 0,50 should get you
going. Compunet users can purchase TTY
which is at 114007 for £4.99.
This type of software does not give you
any colour or graphics, but enables you to
log on to most types of BB.
The second type of BB operates on
Viewdata (Prestel-like) standards. This
type of board presents information with
colour and low-res graphics in a page
format. Micronet-Prestel subscribers will
not need to buy any additional software,
but Compunet subscribers will need the
free Viewdata proggy at 2020. Again, as
with the dumb terminal software, most
comms software has a Viewdata mode.
Which Modem?
Most of the BBs are run at 300 baud. This
means that you'll need a modem such as
the Voyager 7, Nightingale o r  Multi
modem from Miracle Technology. All
three modems will also allow you to
access boards at 1200/75 Prestel and
scrolling formats. CBM modem owners
need not feel hard done by. Many boards
now allow access at 1200/75 baud, and
some even operate at 1200/1200.
Each BB has its own unique character. But
most have an E-Mail (Electronic Mail)
option that enables you t o  send and
receive messages. These messages can be
private, i.e. to another user, or be posted
on the general board for everyone to see.
Other features on BBs typically include
free downloadable software. Down-
loading is done in several ways. but by far
the most popular is the X-Modem format,
so check to see if your comms package has
this option, Another common feature to
be found on BBs are the SIGs -  Special
Interest Groups, These are areas which
contain information on one particular
subject such as a micro, comms, politics or
whatever.
There are many other features to be
found on BBs. Some even have on-line
adventures that you can play.
When u s in g  a  BB,  it ' s  w o r t h
remembering that the service which you
are using is two-way. That is, it's up to you,
the user, to help supply the board with
information. Have you got any software
(of your own)? Then why not upload it for
everyone to use. How about asking the
System Operator (SYSOP) to set up an SIG
dedicated to Commodore machines if
there is not one there already?
The List
Opposite is a very small selection of BBs
that are currently in operation. All the
boards listed operate on a 24 hour basis.
V/Data means that you will need Prestel
type software to access the board.1200-75
means that you need scrolling type soft-
ware and a modem, such as the one from
CBM, to access the service. Finally, 300
means 300-300 baud access which needs
scrolling software. CBM modem users will
NOT be able to access this type of board.
All the boards listed have a section
which contains phone numbers for other
boards. Have fun!
What About the 64?
To the best of my knowledge, there are
only three bulletin boards which are run
on t h e  Commodore 64, O n e  is  i n
Aberdeen, one in Dublin and the third in
Denmark! No doubt there are quite a
few in the good ole U$ of Reagan which
shall check out next month. I also under-
stand that there is some public domain
(free) BB software knocking about in
Ireland which I shall also track down. As
you can see below, running a Bulletin
Board on a C-64 is perfectly feasible.

SUBJECT :A NOTHE R CBM BBS!!
DATE : T H U R S D A Y  20/ 2/86
USER IS A : N O N  MEMBER.
Hi folks! I have set up a BBS in Dublin.
Ireland, running on a Commodore
64 with W52000 and 2 disk drives. I am a
heavy CBM fan. The BBS software (by
me) is called SIBBS. It is an
interpreter - no menus! And it is all in
machine code. Give it a ring and you
will see. It is QUITE different. It is
refreshing to see another BBS running
on a Commodore 64. Also, what does
All think of the new SFID 1001 CBM disk
drive with 1MB per disk?? Anyway,
the board (run by moi for the Irish
Amateur Computer Club) is called the
IACCBBS, and ring Dublin 903341 (24
Hours) on 8 bits, no par, 1 stop. 300

Last but not Least
Well that's it for another month. I shall be
reviewing at least two moderns and some
comms packages. Fin a lly, a  sp e cia l
mention to  Richard James (CNET R812)
•,vho wanted his name to appear in THE
magazine in THE column. Null said! Don't
forget to drop me a line on Compunet ID

Vit
Lewis They gives you the
[update from across the
Atlantic.
HAS THIS BEEN FOR COMMODORF the
"winter of discontent, or just a winter of
the big freeze? In the US programs like
Freeze Frame from Cardco, and lsepic
from Starpoint Software, seem to reﬂect
in their names the low point reached by
Commodore's stock. By midwinter it had
dived to its lowest level ever of six, down
from an all time high of SO on the NY Stock
Exchange.
Is this great company on its way out?
How can a company that has sold over
four million units of the C64 be in such
trouble? Even this past Christmas it is
rumoured that 60% of the sales were of
the old reliable, that the C128 was so
sluggish that an artiﬁcial shortage in the
C64 was created by holding back supplies
of them in the east coast, Other guesses
were that the C64 was -
order t o  raise its price and/or to re-
introduce it in a new case with some fancy
new touches. T he abov e rumours,
incidently, are through the courtesy of
Felix Riveria who writes in what is perhaps
the outstanding computer support group
publication in the US. "The New York
Commodore Exchange Network News" is
published monthly in newspaper format.
To subscribe, write Brian A Glover, Editor,

My contact with user groups was
greatly expanded by attendance at the
1986 West Coast Commodore Association
"Commodore Show II" this February in
San Francisco. At least a dozen groups
were represented. Leading the ﬁeld was
the grand daddy of them all, The Toronto
Pet Users Group, followed by such US
giants a s  t h e  O r egon bas ed U S
Commodore Users Group, P.O. Box 2310,
Roseburg, Oregon 97470 USA, and the
above mentioned NYC conglomerate. No
less than nine smaller California groups
were listed in the show catalogue.
What's a BIG West Coast computer
show like? Jammed packed with people
and programs! The people were a little
older on the average than those I've seen
attending the shows at Earls Court or the
International Commodore Show i n
London last year. But they were deﬁnitely
not like the three-piece suit, business
types that I ran into in San Francisco at an
IBM compatible software show that was
being held at the same time.
Now f o r  t h e  programs whic h I
mentioned earlier. Freeze Frame b y
CARDCO. Inc., 300 S Topeka, Wichita, KS
67202 w i l l  quietly  s it  ins ide y our
computer, totally transparent to any other
programs you may wish to load and use.
Then when you want to make a screen
dump, you call it with two keystrokes and
voila!, the frame is frozen and sent to your
printer. Y o u  then continue t o  r u n
whatever you may have as your main
program.
Don't confuse two different programs
coming from the US both called Snapshot.
One is a utility from COMPUTE!s Gazette
magazine written in machine language
which can store whatever you have on the
TEXT screen (up to 53 screens) and then
retrieve it for display or for printing. The
other is a cartridge named Snapshot 64
which comes from those ﬁne people at
CSM Software., Inc.. P.O. Box 563, Crown
Point., Indiana 46307 who developed the
best of the 1541 Disk Drive Alignment
Programs (buy the Version 2.0 at $44.95
plus shipping).
Snapshot 64 is touted as the "ultimate"
backup utility since you are able to "stop
most any program after the protection
check a n d  t h e n  r es ume.. .totally
bypassing the protection check." Price on
this utility is $49.95 plus shipping costs.
Remember t h e  exciting advertise-
ments from Starpoint Software of Gazelle.
CA 960347? They announced a utility
called STARDOS which would do every-
thing (even makes great coffee). Well,
they were blocked from releasing it by a
lawsuit slapped o n  them by  SKYLES
Electric Works, 231E South Whisman
Road, Mountain View, CA94041. Skyles
says that is was too much like their cart-
70
ridge 1541 FLASH (i59.95 - on sale, plus
$15.00 UK shipping charge) which was
developed by the same computer expert.
Starpoint is  delivering one of the
bargains of the year. They are marketing a
256K RAM board for the Amiga function-
ally identical to the Commodore 1050
RAM board for £99.95 + $6.00 shipping
outside the USA.
Isepic, whic h is  also a  Starpoint
product at $64.95, is a combination hard-
ware and software package that closes this
little survey o f  new utilities. I t  "de-
protects" by  capturing and saving the
protected program as it runs in the 64's
memory. "This 'snapshot' [so help me,
they advertise this one as a "snapshot",
tool becomes accessible to the user for
complete inspection and alteration." The
q u o t a t io n  i s  f r o m  S t a r p o in t ' s
advertisement.
The midnight mo d e m madness
continues. Commodor e associated
QUANTUM LINK is giving away a 300
baud autodial modem if you subscribe for
four months at $9,95 monthly. Viewtron
charges you only $49.95 for a 300 baud
Volks 6420 by Anchor Automation. They
throw in a ﬁrst hour on Viewtron for free.

The thaw has certainly come to Amiga.
Hardware prices are falling and software is
ﬂowing from the developers like warmed
up maple syrup. The Electronic Arts
Deluxe Paint program begins to really
show what this amazing machine can do
in presenting visual ideas. What's more it
integrates w ith the Deluxe Graphics,
Music and Printing modules of the same
company. The games have arrived too.
Flight Simulator from Sublogic, Napoleon
at Waterloo by Krentek Software, Skyfox
and a re-issue of the Software Golden
Oldies, i.e. Pong, Eliza, Adventure and
Life from EA are available now.
The C128 is  less fortunate in  the
issuance o f  new  programs designed
especially for it. True, some very ﬁne old
programs are being updated such as
Vizawrite and SuperScript. And now that
Commodore has issued a new version of
CP/M for the 128, which really works this
time, all those wonderful o ld  CP/M
business programs are there for  the
taking.
may be including a mention of the PC
10 in upcoming columns if the announce-
ment by a PR (that's Public Relations in US
english) man for  X-PRESS Information
Services is true. Commodore is going to
try and hit the business world with a wire
service which is compatible with IBM
machines. They'll distribute the PC 10 in
the US to clients who want the service
compatible with IBM and may even offer
a free Plus/4 to the less ﬂuent businesses
who want to try their service. This will all
be tied in with QuantumLink to give a
truly total service as well as ﬁnd a use for
all those great (and unsold) PLUS/4's.

Joe Nicholson
continues his look at
the C-16. This month
— clocks and timers.
IN THIS ARTICLE I SHALL AT-
tempt to explain some of the
techniques involved in timing,
interrupts and so on. I shall start
with the keyboard interrupt as
this is the easiest to explain.
Every 1/50th of a second the
computer interrupts its normal
processing to execute a 'service
routine'. This updates the clock
and r eads  t h e  k ey board,
putting any new keys pressed
into the keyboard buffer. I t
then resumes processing. The
address contained i n  bytes
$0314 and $0315 are the low and
high bytes o f  t h e  indirect
values for the location of the
interrupt. These values can be
redirected in order to make the
C-16 j u m p  t o  y o u r  o w n
machine c ode routine. This
method was used in the play
routine and t h e  synthesiser
article explained last month.
After the user routine has been
completed the program can
then jump back into the service
routine to update the counter
etc. Alternatively it is possible
to jump straight back int o
processing.
The interrupt is  normally
on. The machine code instruc-
tion SEI turns the interrupt off
and CLI will turn it on again.
The following routine will set
the interrupt vector:
SEI i n t e r r u p t  off
IDA low byte
STA $0314
LDA high byte
STA $0315
CLI i n t e r r u p t  on
RTS r e t u r n
Similarly to restore the original
interrupt:
SEI
WA SOE
STA $0314
LDA SCE
STA $0315
CLI
RTS
Note that most of the prog-
ramming associated w i t h
interrupts has to be done in
machine code for speed, for
instance it is not possible to
disable t h e  interrupts fr om
Basic. At the end of the user
interrupt r outine us e t h e
instruction MAP SCEOE to return
PROGRAMMING
THE
to the service routine. To jump
back from the user routine to
continue processing, ignoring
the C-16's service routine, use
the instruction jMP SFCB6 (IRQ
exit). I won't include a demon-
stration of this type as the play
command published i n  the
December 1985 artic le o n
sound, and the sound syn-
thesiser article published last
month s e r v e  a s  ﬁt t i n g
demonstrations.
Internal Timers
There are three internal 16 bit
timers in the C-16. The timers
operate at a frequency of 885
KHz o n  o u r  PAL system
machines. It therefore takes on
0.0741 seconds to count all the
way from 65535 to zero. Timer
# 1 has the facility of being able
to activate an interrupt upon
reaching zero. Each timer is
arranged a s  t w o  eight b i t
registers in memory, using the
normal protocol of high byte
(i.e. multiples o f  256) last,
preceded b y  t h e  lo w  byte
(remainder 0-255),
The registers are arranged
in memory as follows:
SFFOO Timer I:11 low byte
$F f
SFF02 Timer # 2 low byte
SFF03 Timer ft 2 high byte
SFE04 Timer # 3 low byte
SFF05 Timer# 3 high byte
To set a timer simply load the
timer's registers w it h  t h e
starting value; it will then count
down to zero. As the timer will
obviously have to be set in two
parts, (one POKE or STA for the
low byte and one for the high
byte) there should therefore be
a delay of no greater than 125
us between writing the low
byte and the high byte, other-
wise the timer will start t o
count down and therefore to
be set incorrectly.
To eliminate this problem,
therefore, the timer registers
should be set in machine code
using the following type of
routine:
SEI disable interrupts. ( w e
don't w a n t  a  k ey boar d
71
interrupt t o  o ccu r between
writing the low byte and the
high byte)
LDA low byte of start time
STA Low byte of timer
LDA high byte of start time
STA high byte of timer
CLI turn the interrupts back on
RTS return
The Timers and
Interrupts
16
Timer tt 1 is a more sophisti-
cated timer than timers # 2 and
ft 3. When this timer is written
to, it sets the timer to that value
as expected, but also sets the
'timer tri reload registers' to
that value. The timer then
counts down to zero, at which
point an interrupt is generated
if bit three of  the interrupt
mask ﬂag is set. Bit three of the
interrupt status register is then
set. The timer is then reset to
the reload value, and t h e
counter carries o n  dec re-
menting until it reaches zero
when another interrupt is
generated etc.
Timer tt 1 is  potentially a
very useful timer  allowing
periodic interrupts of speciﬁed
delay length, f o r  instance
timers are used t o  generate
accurate inter bit delays in a fast
tape loading system which is
under development.
Timer #2 and timer # 3 are
simpler timers. These timers go
back to 65535 after they have
reached zero, instead of being
reset to a reload value. They
still have the ability to generate
interrupts when they  reach
zero however. To turn inter-
rupt for timer # 2 off/on, set/
reset bit six of the interrupt
mask register. When the inter-
rupt takes place, bit six of the
interrupt status register is set
high.
The Interrupt Mask
The interrupts are turned on
and off by setting/resetting bits
on a  regis ter c alled t h e
interrupt mask at SFIOA o r
decimal 65290. Bits one t o
seven control the t o l l o v
Bit 1 raster interrupt
Bit 2 light pen
Bit 3 timer 1 interrupt
Bit 4 timer 2 interrupt
Bit 6 timer 3 interrupt
Bit 7 interrupt request
Setting a bit high on the mask
byte will enable the approp-
riate interrupt. Bit 2 light pen?
There is no connection for a
light pen on the edge connec-
tor, but there may be on the
joystick port.
The Interrupt Status
Register
This byte (at SFF09 or  65289
decimal) r ec or ds  w h i c h
interrupt has interrupted. It is
important f o r  t he interrupt
service routine to know just
which interrupt has been used
so that it knows how to act. The
arrangement o f  bits i n  this
register is  the same as the
interrupt mask register (e.g. Bit
four is the timer # 3 interrupt
bit). Strangely, to set a bit 'on'
in this register, write that bit
with a zero. Similarly write the
bit with a one to reset that bit.
Any interrupts from the C-16
are recorded b y  t h e  C-16
setting the appropriate bit of
this register.
Timer Interrupts
It is interesting to note that the
three timer interrupts can still
be used even when the raster
and interrupt requests have
been disabled with t he SEI
c ommand. T h i s  i s  t h e
technique used in the saving
and loading of programs in the
C-16. The routine at $E364, for
instance (Figure 1)  is  used
before loading/saving a block/
header in the C-16. The routine
at $E378, shown in Figure 2, is
the opposite of the routine of
$E364 and is used after loading/
saving a block/header.
However it  is not always
necessary t o  perform timing
exercises using t he method

described above, thanks to a
very useful RO M routine at
$E2EA. If quite accurate time
delays are all that are required,
the routine at $E2EA can be
used. Calling this routine will
generate a  delay o f  1/50th
second. This routine is used to
generate d e la y s  i n  t h e
saying/loading routine, e.g.
the 3 / 5  s ec ond betw een
printing SAVING or LOADING
and turning the screen off on
saving/loading is:
LDX $1E
JSR $E2EA
DEX
BNE 4:L1
CCI
Note that as the routine at
$E2EA turns the interrupts off
to get better timing, the CCI
command is used to re-enable
them i f  you want them on
again.
The Clock
The registers $0312 and $0313
are the low  and high byte
pointers for the 'update clock'
routine which is called every
1/50th second by  the C-16's
service routine. This is usually
set to $CE42 but can be re-
directed to go to a user routine.
Figure 3 shows the assembly
text for a clock which displays
its time continuously in the top
right hand c or ner  o f  t h e
screen. It also has an alarm with
sound and a facility to iump to a
machine code routine upon
the event o f  an alarm. The
clock redirects t h e  pointer
$0312 and $0313 (786 and 787) to
a new service routine stored at
$0660. T he whole machine
(ode program is 308 bytes long
and resides between $0600 and
$0728, a free area of memory in
the C-16. To type this in use the
C-16 Assembler published in
the June 1985 copy of Your
Commodore. Alternativ ely
Figure 4 shows the code for this
program i n  data statements
with a machine code loader at
10000 to POKE the bytes in. The
time and the alarm time can all
be set with Basic commands.
The routine is stored at $0600
(1536 decimal).
Description of Clock
Program
Lines 10120-10220 initialise the
routines own variables.
Lines 10300-10380 turn off the
clock b y  r eloc ating t h e
'update clock' routine to its
original value.
Lines 10500-10580 tur n o n
clock; diverts 'update clock
routine' to new service routine.
Lines 10600-10700 set time. To
set the time, type: 5YS1577,12:
43:23. The latter three numbers
are the time in hours, minutes
and seconds. The system for
scanning the line used in this
subroutine will be explained in
a later article on extending the
Basic. Line 10690 then turns the
clock on.
Lines 10800-10910 set the alarm.
This works in the same way as
the 'set time' routine. I t  is
located a t  $103D  ( 4157
decimal), so SYS1601,12:43:23
sets the alarm and initialises it
so that it sounds for 30 seconds
when t h e  alar m t i m e  i s
reached.
Lines 11000-11990 -  c loc k
service routine.
Lines 11000-11990 count each
1/50th second jumping t o
$CE%2 if the next second has
not been reached.
Lines 11200-11340 updat e
seconds.
Lines 11400-11500 updat e
minutes.
Lines 11550-11690 update
hours, s witc hing bac k  t o

23:59:59.
Line 11700 calls the routine
which handles the alarm sound
it it is on.
Line 11710 calls the r •utine to
print the time on the screen.
Lines 11800-11860 check to see
if the alarm time has been
reached by comparing the time
($D1-$DB) and the alarm time
($D9$F0) byte by byte.
Lines 11900-11990 the alarm has
been reached. Line 11910 calls
the alarm sound subroutine
which starts the alarm sound if
it is required.
Lines 11950-11980 c a ll a
machine code routine whose
address is stored in bytes 5E2
and $E3, if $E8 is set.
Lines 12000-12200 -  Alar m
routine. This handles the 30
second bleeping alarm if it is
on.
Lines 1  21 0 5-1 2 20 0 a r e
concerned with marking the
bleeping.
Lines 12500-12680 initialise
alarm sound. If an alarm has
been reached and the register
$E4 is 0  to signify that the
alarm sound is  enabled, an
alarm sound is generated in
voice 2.

Bill Bremner begins a series
designed to help you get the
most out of your disk drive.
BEFORE I TRY TO EXPLAIN HOW THE
1541 Disk Drive works, let us discover
what brought about its unique design and
unravel some of its peculiarities.
Most modern computers employ an
all-singing all-dancing (albeit expensive)
Floppy Disk Controller or FDCtoconnect
up to a disk drive. A software package
called a Disk Filing System (DES) or Disk
Operating System (DOS) is then loaded
into RAM or plugged in as ROM and
manages the controller, to perform such
tasks as formatting, reading, and writing.
Of course, the more complex the DFS or
DOS required, the more space is taken up
inside the computer (the BBC micro uses
the plug in ROM method, Apple and Atari
both load their software into RAM). There
are quite a few advantages in using this
type of system: fast loading and saving,
and a variety of increasingly complicated
and fashionable drives. However, the
restraint on memory usage restricts the

versatility of supporting software, data
storage is, on the whole, less efﬁcient, and
incompatability problems often arise with
third party and tape software.
The 1541 Disk Drive evolved from the
1540. which was designed for the Vic-20,
and, because of the limited amount of
memory in the Vic, Commodore had to
ﬁnd a way around a memory based DOS.
So was born the 1540, an intelligent serial-
bus device which controlled all its own
formatting, reading and writing, as well as
intricate sequential and random-access
ﬁle handling. Unfortunately, it was serial
(sl000www), not parallel (fast), and it had
quite a few bugs (it sometimes thought it
was a dual drive), but, after all, anything
was better than tape. When the 64 arrived
on the home computer scene, it was
decided a new disk drive should follow
with it, but as the Vic was still selling, the
new drive would have to be compatible
with that too. So was born the 1541, still
slow, still with bugs, but relatively cheap,
quite efﬁcient, and pretty reliable.
Because the drive is intelligent, and
thus sell-supporting, there is no need for
either disk controller or dedicated disk
software inside the 64. The control unit
inside the 1541 is a 6502 based computer
much like the Vic or 64, with RAM, ROM
and Interface chips. This means that at the
end of your serial lead is a fast storage
device, which, with a little understanding,
can be programmed much the same as the
host computer it is attached to.

Inside the 1541
If you are prepared to open up the 1541
you will ﬁnd relatively little inside that
looks like a computer. The circuit board,
sitting atop the mains transformer and the
drive mechanism, contains the control
electronics at the front end, and the actual
computer circuitry at the back. This is
much more Spartan than the Vic or 64
boards, as it  needs neither audio nor
visual related chips. Two 6522 Versatile
Interface Adaptors handle serial bus
communication and control the drive
mechanism, as well as supplying timing
and interrupt facilities for the processor.
The Disk Operating System software is
held in two 8K ROM chips,and 2K of RAM
not o n l y  pr ov ides  t h e  necessary
workspace for the 6502, but is also used as
buffer storage, A handful of other support
chips, including an address decoder,
complete the quota,
1541 Block Diagram
The 16K of DOS is split into two sections:
the Interface Processor or !FP for short,
which manages the host computer related
functions such as ﬁle manipulation and
serial bus  communications, and t h e
Floppy Disk Controller or  FDC which
controls the Read-Write head and data
storage. The 6502 Processor has to share
Data Encoding Scheme
time between the FOC and the !FP, which
often reduces the effective operating
speed of the 1541. The F IX. I P  and
Interface Chips will all be elaborated on
individually as  t he series progresses,
together with a full RAM memory map.
Disk Format
In order for the DOS to ﬁnd its way
around the disk a format routine is used to
divide the disk surface up into tracks and
sectors. 35 tracks are formatted in all, track
one being the ﬁrst and outermost, and
track 35 the innermost, with the directory
on track 18, Each Track is further divided
up into 17 or more 256 byte sectors,
numbered zero upwards. To pack as
much data into the available space, Com-
modore adopted a scheme where the
number of sectors on a track increases the
further out, and thus longer, the track is.
However, this method by itself would not
have worked because even if the Read-
Write head is positioned on track one or
35, it still takes the same amount of time
for the disk surface to rotate once. The
larger the track, the higher the velocity it
has when it passes under the head, so to
counter this the data is actually written
and read to and from the disk at a faster
rate depending on how far out the track
is, The data bits are "clocked" in and out
at approximately 300,000 bits/sec on the
outermost tracks and 250,000 bits/sec on
the innermost. The track layout is divided
into four different zones:
Commodore again opted for  a more
space-efﬁcient recording method to store
the individual bits on the disk. The most
commonly-used storage scheme is FM
GCR Table
76
(Frequency Modulation) which involves
writing a stream of clocking bits, with a
data bit occurring in between if a ''1"
needs to be written. This is expensive in
data storage space and so the 1541 was
designed to use a self-clocking method
called Group Coded Recording, GCR for
short (Apple micros also use GCR). Prior
to being written on to the disk, every data
byte is converted into a form which can
neither be confused as a sync mark nor
affect reading accuracy. This is achieved
by splitting the byte into two halves, or
four bit nibbles, and using a look-up table
in the ROM to convert each half into a ﬁve
bit result.
For example, to convert the eight bit byte
$A5 (10100101) into GCR, the byte is ﬁrst
split into two four bit hi-lo order nibbles
1010 and 0101. Using the conversion table
these nibbles now become 11010 and
01111 respectively, and so our completed
GCR byte is, 1101001111. Using Group
Codes Recording, no combination of any
ﬁve bit GCR nibbles will ever produce
nine consecutive binary ones (used as a
sync mark), and n o  more than t w o
consecutive binary zeros will appear in a
10-bit GCR byte or combination of bytes
this is for speed accuracy when clocking
bits back into the 1541 during a read).
However, we now have a problem when
manipulating this data. The 6502 can
address only one eight bit byte at a time,
whereas our new byte is now 10 bits long.
Therefore the conversion routine inside
the DOS actually converts four bytes at
the same time. This is the minimum
amount of bytes that can be converted by
an eight bit processor (4* 10-bit bytes= 40
bits = 5 * 8-bit bytes), Thus, when writing
data, four eight bit bytes are collated and
then converted into four GCR 10-bit

This all sounds a bit confusing (if you'll
pardon the pun) so s h o w  you an
example:
4 8-bit bytes : $08, $AA. $01, $01
in Binary : 00001000, 10101010, 00000001,

4-bit nibbles : 0000.10001010,1010.0000,
0001, 0000, 0001,
in 5-bit GCR : 01010. 01001, 11010, 11010,
01010, 01011, 01010, 01011,
in 8-bit GCR 01010010. 011101010,
10100101, 00101101. 01001011
in hex : $52, $75, $A5. 52D, $43,
Thus our original four eight bit bytes $08-
$AA-S01-$01 are actually written on to the
disk surface as  $52-$75-$A5-S2D-$4B.
Reading GCR bytes off the disk is merely
the same process reversed.
5 GCR bytes : $52, $75, $A5, 52D, $43,
in 8- bit G CR :  01010010, 01110101,
10100101, 00101101. 01001011

Simple, really!
Sector Format
Each sector on a track is comprised of two
main parts: the Header Block. or ID Field,
which supplies information o n  t h e
position of the sector, and the Data Block
of data. Preceding each of these ﬁelds is a
unique synchronisation Field o r  Sync
Mark, used to identify the beginning of
the block and immediately following the
block is a short gap which gives the IDC
breathing space to allow for ﬂuctuations
in drive speed. The sector header is
written only once, during formatting, but
the data ﬁeld, including its sync mark, is
re-written every time data needs to be
recorded on the disk.
Header Block
a) Sync Mark: Written as ﬁve eight bit
GCR SFI bytes ( 40 consecutive one bits)
the sync mark is a ﬂag to tells the DOS that
a. block is coming up next.
b) Header Block ID: This is the Block
Identiﬁer Byte which informs the DOS
that this is a header ﬁeld. Its value is always
$08.
c) Header Block Checksum: This is the
header ﬁeld checksum byte created by
EORing together the track number, sector

the format sequence, which contains a
routine which times how long the disk
takes to rotate once. The gap size is
calculated fr om this  timing, and s o
explains not only why the format routine
takes s o  long, b u t  als o w hy  "Fast
Formatters" are occassionally unreliable.
Commodore used ﬁxed gap formatting
on earlier drives but found that the last
sector on the track sometimes over-wrote
the ﬁrst slightly. Fast Formatters use ﬁxed-
gap formatting (usually eight bytes long).
Our sector is now larger and much
mare complicated than at ﬁrst sight. Its
actual size is calculated like so:

Stuart Cooke takes a look at a
new range of disk based
budget software.
IF YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO BUY A
wordprocessor, database or  any other
type of business software for use with
your Commodore computer then you will
have been amazed at the price. Ills not
unheard of for over £100 to be asked for a
wordprocessor. A  f e w  companies,
notably Supersoft and Mastertronic, have
produced a  few cheap, 'professional'
programs at around the f15 mark. Now a
new range of disk based budget software
is set to hit the streets at a price of only
f7.99. This makes it far cheaper than a
great deal of software that is available on
cassette.
So what's the drawback? A disk for
only eight quid must have at least one
fault. Well, there are a few corners cut in
getting this software out s o cheaply.
There is  no fancy packaging. A  clear
plastic pack is used so that the disks can
hang on pegs in shops. There are no
manuals with the software, the instruc-
tions on the packet simply tell you how to
load the program. Finally, most of the
programs are in Basic.
Don't let any of the above factors put
you off the software though. The lack of
instructions is usually -  I  say usually
because one important program has no
instructions- overcome by very clear help
options within the program. Even though
many of the programs are written in Basic
they all work extremely well and do what
they should. In fact many of the programs
in the range work better and look better
than their more expensive competitors.
The name o f  this new range o f
software is  Load'N'Col The range is
imported over from America. In the States
the programs sell extremely well i n
supermarkets with a price tag of around
$5. Who knows, we may soon be able to
buy a Wordprocessor at the same time as
our cornﬂakes.
Load 'N'Gol software falls  in t o  a
number of different series. The series that
is being marketed over here at the
moment is  t h e  'Home Management
Series'. A  lot of this range of software
could be put to good use in either a small
business or at home, its main purpose is to
make life easier for you.
So what's the software really like? The
best way to answer this question is to have
a l o o k  a t  s ome o f  t h e  packages
individually.
Love Letters
At £7.99 Master Word must b e  the
cheapest wordprocessor available. It has
many of the functions of its dearer com-
panions such as search and replace and
the ability to set line spacing and margins.
It does however lack the more 'up market'
fancy bits such as page numbering and
headers a n d  f o o t e r s  A n o t h e r

Wordprocessor is due to be released at a
later date that will have all o f  these
facilities plus many more.
As wordprocessors go this one isn't
particularly fancy. It will however regurgi-
tate y our latest masterpieces without
complaining at all. In fact if you're not too
good with the old pen a selection of
Business letters (You're ﬁred etc). Home
letters (birthday etc) and love letters
(Yuck!!!) are provided on the disk.
Another program in the series is 'Personal
Spreadsheet'. This one is a. little disap-
pointing. For a start there are no clear
instructions anywhere. There are no help
functions, except with the different types
of calculation. This means that the only
way to ﬁgure out what the package does is
to actually use it. If you have never come
across a  spread sheet before then I
suggest that you ﬁnd out what one is and
how it works before you look at this
program. I f  you have already used a
spreadsheet then you will more than
likely be disappointed with this package.

On Time
Basically 'Persona! Spreadsheet' is a
gloriﬁed calculator. Y o u  c an s tore
numbers in the columns and rows and
then perform simple calculations o n
them. You cannot set up formulae in
locations as you can on other spread-
sheets. Since a spreadsheet is supposed to
help you if you have a lot of formulae to
work with, I think this program is the
biggest let down of the pack. A normal
calculator will perform the same job as
this program, and a lot quicker.
If, like me, you are always forgetting
appointments or forgetting what time you
are supposed to be somewhere, you will
ﬁnd 'Electronic Schedular' a must.
This program is used for recording all
appointments. You are asked for the
name of the person who the appointment
is for, this means that you could put the
whole ofﬁces appointments into this
program. Wh a t  t im e  and date t h e
appointment is, who the appointment is
with, where it is and any comments that
you need.
Once you have entered in the data you
can search for all meetings for a certain
person after certain dates. You can list all

meetings between dates. I t  is  even
possible to print details of all meetings at a
certain place or with certain people.
How o n  earth did I  ever manage
without this one?
Money Matters
A couple o f  ﬁnancial organisers are
included in  the series. These are 'Pro
Financial Organiser' and 'Home Finance
Organiser 1', Both disks offer checkbook
and address lis t programs while the
Financial organiser also has a calendar and
the Home ﬁnance package has a budget
program.
One very nice feature in the Mail List
manager on the Pro disk is the ability to
code names and addresses, with say an 'F'
for friend or 'B' for business. When you
want to print out your labels you can then
print them out for just one group.
A very nice 'extra is the Christmas card
list. For each record you must specify
whether you want them on your christmas
card list or not. You can then get a count
of how many Christmas cards you will
need and then get the computer to print
out all the labels.
The calendar is one of those silly
'PLEASE GIVE ME THE YEAR' type of
programs. You know, you give it the year
and the month and it prints out a calendar
for you. One extra feature is the ability to
highlight a speciﬁc date. This would be
great if you could highlight all dates with
say birthdays of friends but since you can
only highlight one day in every month this
is probably out of the question. What a
silly fault!
The titles explain the functions of the
other programs on these disks and I don't
think that I need say anything more about
them apart from that they work well. In
fact if you used either of the chequebook
programs you would know exactly how
your ﬁnances were at any time.
Both disks are good in certain areas. If
you want addresses then go for the Pro
Finance pack, if you want budgeting and
cheques then I  think that the Home
ﬁnance pack is a little better.
The packs are so cheap that it may well
be worth buying both.
More Info
If you require more information with your
address ﬁle then you could have a look at
the Home and Business Card File disk.
81
This is  very similar t o  t he address
programs that are mentioned above but it
also allows ﬁelds f o r  business and
telephone numbers. I  did have a few
problems with this program. For a start
there wasn't enough room for many of
the addresses that I tried to enter and
secondly they are in the American formal
of City. State and Zip. Since the programs
are in Basic it would only have been a
simple task to turn these formats into
'English'. It may even be possible to make
the changes yourself.
Even better than this is 'g' base. This is a
proper database program. By proper, I
mean that you can deﬁne your own ﬁelds
for data entry. This means that if you
wanted to make an address list you aren't
stuck with ZIP etc. If you wanted you
could even use the program to keep a
catalogue of your records or stamps. In
fact ' g '  base can b e  used t o  store
information about anything that y ou
could put on a card. Having the infor-
mation on computer means that it is a
simple task to ﬁnd speciﬁc details or print
out a list etc.
Keeping Tabs
Obviously with disk software becoming
so cheap the number of disks in your
collection is bound to grow. How on earth
are you going to keep track of them all?
Well, 'Disk Utilities' will solve this
problem for you. This program will store
information on up to 300 disks. You can
search for a speciﬁc program and you will
be told what disk it is on. You can get a
print out of the directories of all your
disks. It is even possible to print out a list
of all the IDs that you have used. As you
are probably aware the Commodore disk
drive uses a two digit ID to identify each
disk. If two disks have the.same ID, the
disk drive may not know if you swap the
disk, thus messing up the contents.
The list of used IDs is printed in the
form of a grid with letters arid numbers
being across the top and edge of the grid.
It is now easy to mark off new disks as you
format them.
As well as the catalogue program there
is also a utility program. This will allow you
to backup disks (riot protected ones),
format disks etc.
At a price of only E7,99 this disk is a
must for any disk drive owners.
Verdict
Most o f  the programs available are
around t he same quality as a  good
magazine listing. They are all functional
and do what they set out to do without
any frills.
At 17.99 this software should make a
very big impact o n  the home/small
business market, perhaps with the same
sort of impact that Mastertronic made
when it launched its 0.99 tapes.
Who knows, good business software at
this price may make people start to use
their computers for something other than
games, this wouldn't be such a bad thing.

H a r d w a r e
1.11111111r
doommt,
Eric Doyle has been trying I
out a real hardware bargain.
WHEN I READ THAT THE IBICO LIR-1
printer claimed letter quality printing and
that the price was less than 000, my
immediate reaction was, to say the least,
one o f  disbelief. After unpacking the
beast I remained unimpressed, the printer
head looked very Mickey Mouse-ish but
when I  tr ied printout m y  attitude
changed.
Surprisingly, t h e  mac hine does
produce letter quality and it does so in a
very nov el way . T he pr inter  head
resembles an ofﬁce date stamp. You know
the kind, rotate the wheels to get the
correct date, then ink the rubber-faced
letters on a pad and stamp away. In this
novel little printer the characters are
carried on a cylinder which carries four
bands of characters. At the back of the
wheel is an inked cylinder which brushes
against the letters as they rotate and each
character is pressed against the paper
when required t o  produce very high
quality letters. High-tech still has a place
for the good old principles pioneered by
Guttenberg!
The limitation of the printer lies in the
ﬁxed roller idea. The characters you get
are the ones you're stuck with. N o
graphics screen dumps or characteristic
Commodore symbols, just plain and
simple alphanumerics and punctuation.
The paper is friction fed through the
printer w ith n o  facilities f or  tractor
feeding. This means that as a  cheap
printer for wordprocessing applications it
can use high quality, headed paper.
Indeed, a good wordprocessor would be
a boon to anyone owning this machine
because it doesn't have a 'paper out'
indicator. When the printer reaches the
bottom of a page, t h e
on the paper and the head carries on
printing to and fro across the same line. A
wordpro with the facility to stipulate a
page length would overcome this fault.
For most people the main application
they would look for is the ability to print
out listings of their latest project for a
leisurely debugging session. Obviously
the problem here is that most listings ﬁll
T
82
more than a  sheet o f  A4 paper and
estimating how many lines to a page
would be a  nightmare. I  found that
normal A4 tractor feed paper would not
ﬁt the platten mounting but you can buy
paper which is A4 width including the
perforations and this is ﬁne for most
purposes as long as the paper doesn't slip
in the platten rollers.
Control of the printer is limited to the
basic character codes of the Commodore.
For example, CHR$(10) followed b y
CHR$(13) will initiate a line feed and
home the printer to the beginning of the
next line. CHR$(28) sets the printer to
normal line spacing and CHR$(29) will
allow double spacing for extra clarity.
The number of characters available is
limited to 126. This includes all the alpha-
numeric characters and punctuation
marks. In the main these correspond to
Commodore's version of ASCII but some
of the characters around CHR$(90) vary.
The most important difference is that the
pound sign has an ASCII value of 123
instead of 92 but a little bit of thought
should overcome this problem.
Despite t h e  H e a t h  R obins on
appearance of the printer, the quality of
the printout is excellent. After a while the
letters may get a little faint or the entirity
of their outlines become broken but this
can be remedied by the simple applica-
tion of more ink on the roller giving a
result indistinguishable from the quality
of a typewriter.
The speed of the printer is comparable
NIPOIMIMp
doosEN6
dinnoth
to that of  a daisywheel. Because the
printer face has to move up and down the
paper frequently, this means that a speed
of 10-12 characters per second is the
maximum that can be achieved. In real
terms this means that a 60-line page of A4
text will take about ﬁve minutes to print
which is not too bad considering the
quality.
The total size of the printer is about 12
inches by nine by two, which means that it
takes up very little room on a desk and the
only control is the paper advance and the
on/off switch so it is not too complex to
use.
My only qualms about this machine
are the tendency of the friction feed to
slip and the problem of what happens
when the print head wears down. To be
fair, mine is a review machine which may
have seen hard use at the hands of others
and the resilience of the printer head
seems to promise a fairly long life.
The cost of the printer should be seen
in the light of the need for a centronics
interface. I  believe Boots sell one for
around f 20, so if you're in the market for a
cheap printer with high quality result and
you're willing to accept the 20th Century
adage that budgeters can't be choosers
then this  is  deﬁnitely a  machine t o
consider. The only other printers at this
price are thermal printers and with the
cost of thermal paper these day5 it could
be worth while considering a machine
with low post-sales overheads, in which
case this could be the one for you.

you get your ﬁnances
in order with the help
of your C64.
IF Y O U ' R E  T I R E D  O F
wondering jus t h o w  muc h
money you've got in the bank
and whether you're going to
last until your next pay packet
comes through, then look no
further. This program can be
used to monitor all of your in-
comings and out-goings so that
you, a n d  n o t  y o u r  bank
manager, are the ﬁrst to know
where y ou stand, ﬁnancially
speaking.
Introduction
Using Budget (A you can divide
your bank  account in t o  a
maximum o f  2 0  separate
categories, each covering a
different s ec tion o f  y our
ﬁnances e.g. gas, electricity.
Before we delve into the
workings of the program, there
are one o r  t w o  things t o
remember. The structure of the
program is such that, when it is
working at full capacity, it uses
nearly a l l  o f  t h e  available
memory. Only 2-3K remains.
Also, from time to time, pauses
will occur. This does not mean
that the computer has crashed.
Just wait for a few seconds and
it will carry on. The delays are
caused by  the complexity of
the pr ogr am.  t h e  m a n y
variables used and the amount
of memory involved.
When the program is ﬁrst
run, you are presented with a
title screen and a question:
'LOAD OLD FILE Y/N'. If you
are starting afresh, then type
'N'. Details of loading your ﬁle
will be explained later.
Next the computer will ask
you how many categories you
wnat. These are the different
sections of your bank account.
Enter the number you want
plus one, then enter their
names.
The ﬁrst category is pre-set
as 'MASTER SHEET' a n d
combines all the others to give
a grand balance.
Once all the names have
been entered, the main menu
is displayed. Pressing a key will
display up to three pages of
transactions for each category.
You have the choice of display
on the screen, the 1520 Printer
Plotter or a standard printer.
The printer used when this
program was written was a Star
SG-10C d o t  matrix printer.
However, using other printers
should cause no problems.
Included in the display are
reverse characters to identify
the origin of each transaction.
Press the k e y  followed by the
character o f  the transaction
which you wish to identify.
At the bottom of the main
menu is  'OTHER OPTIONS'.
These are:
ACTIVATE ACCO UNT : E n -
ables you to add or subtract
from any of your categories.
The process is straightforward
and simple.
SAVE A FILE: Will save your ﬁle
on tape. The option o f  an
access code is  included t o
prevent other people fr om
loading your ﬁle.
ENTER WAGE: This option can
be used if, for instance you
wanted to divide E100 between
different categories. Enter the
total amount deposited and
press return. The amount will
be displayed o n  t he other
options menu and any other
areas where is could be useful.
As y ou spread your money
between the categories, the
amount y o u  enter ed w i l l
decrease. When it reaches zero
it will disappear.
Options E  a n d  F  wor k
together with option D. If you
remove the messager from the
U D G E
83
screen, the amount will remain
the same until you bring it
back.
R E
the category which you wish to
re-name. Make sure that it is
empty of money as its memory
will be cleared when you re-
name it.
MONEY TRANSFER: Enter the
two categories involved, then
proceed as  f o r  'ACTIVATE
ACCOUNT'.
ADD A CATEGORY: Type in
the name of the new category.
PERFORM CALCULATIONS: If
you want to do arty arithmetic
you can use this option.
Finally t o  load your ﬁle,
press 'Y' at the start. Then enter
your access code if you have
one.
