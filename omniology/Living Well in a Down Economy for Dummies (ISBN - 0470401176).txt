Introduction
A
sk an economist what a recession is, and you’ll likely
get the answer “a decline in gross domestic product
lasting two or more consecutive quarters.” (Gross domes-
tic product, or GDP, is the total value of goods and serv-
ices produced in a country.) At the time of this writing,
America isn’t officially in a recession (although many ana-
lysts say it’s just a matter of getting the numbers that’ll
prove that the second-quarter decline has actually
occurred), but the economy is definitely in a downturn.
Home values are falling, employment is down, real
income is down, and energy costs are skyrocketing.
So how long will this downturn last? No one knows. Some
think it’ll be over in a matter of months; others predict
the recession could last a year or longer.
None of this is good news. Fortunately, you can do more
than cross your fingers and hope for good luck. During a
recession, you have the following main objectives:
 Prepare yourself in case you lose your job. As com-
panies earn less, they look for ways to save money.
Unfortunately, payroll reduction (read “layoffs and fir-
ings”) is a key way to save. Fortunately, by preparing
a resume and seeing this as an opportunity to explore
alternative careers and ways to work, you can be
proactive in protecting yourself in case you find your-
self on the job market.

 Take control of your finances. Figure out what you
have and what you spend and then make deliberate
decisions about ways to rein in your spending. Your
goal should be to live within your means if you’re
not already, to preserve your long-term financial
goals, and to save enough to see you through a
period of unemployment in case you lose your job.
 Continue to live and enjoy your life while main-
taining control of your finances. The key isn’t just
to scale back but to do so in a way that you don’t
feel deprived. You can save a lot just by being a
savvier consumer and by spending your money a
little differently.
 Have a plan to follow if the worst happens. In
uncertain times, you may find yourself, despite your
best efforts, facing a financial catastrophe like a
bankruptcy or foreclosure. Even in these circum-
stances, you still have options — maybe not many,
and maybe not pleasant ones, but options that can
help you weather even these storms.
Bottom line: In a stumbling economy, you have to tread
carefully, but you can still move forward. This book helps
you one step at a time.
About This Book
Living Well in a Down Economy For Dummies contains
more than 125 tips and suggestions to help you through
tough economic times. How can you scale back on cele-
brations without sacrificing the fun? How can you con-
tinue to save for retirement when you need all your
income to make ends meet now? What do you do when
college loans — or tuition — come due and money is
tight? How can you save money on household expenses?
Living Well in a Down Economy For Dummies 
2

This book answers these and other questions for people
looking to save money without sacrificing quality of life.
Each part of this book is divided into tips containing
information relevant to that part’s theme. The great thing
about this book is that you decide where to start and
what to read. It’s a reference you can jump into and out of
at will. Thumb through to glance at a variety of tips, or go
to the Table of Contents to find the different categories 
of tips.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book uses a few conventions to help you navigate
through:
 Italics are used for emphasis and to highlight new
words or terms that are defined.
 Boldfaced text indicates keywords or phrases and
the action part of numbered steps.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made some assumptions about you:
 You feel uneasy about the economy and want to get
yourself and your family in a better financial position.
 You worry about losing your job, or you’ve already
lost your job, and you need advice on finding work
and cutting your expenses.
Introduction

 You want to know how you can continue to plan for
long-term financial goals like retirement and college
savings when money’s tight.
 You want to be a savvier, more thoughtful consumer
so you can continue to enjoy life’s pleasures without
spending too much.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into parts so you can find informa-
tion quickly and easily. Each part represents a particular
category of tips.
Part I: Facing Off Against a
Recession
When facing a gloomy financial picture, the first hurdle is
taking back control. You may not be able to whip the
economy into shape by yourself, but you can regain con-
trol of your personal finances and attitude. This part pro-
vides tips that can help.
Part II: Bumping Up Your 
Bring-Home
A key challenge during a slowing economy is to ensure you
have enough money to take care of your financial obliga-
tions. That means being prepared to find a new job, changing
careers if you must, and coming up with alternative ways to
earn a living if the traditional route (read “a 9-to-5 job work-
ing for others”) isn’t working out the way you’d like.

Part III: Putting Your Personal
Finances on Firm Footing
Financial security doesn’t just mean having a bunch of
money in the bank; it means being smart about your
financial decisions, especially during uncertain economic
times. This part includes tips that help stabilize your
financial position now and allow you to continue to pre-
pare for the future.
Part IV: Living a Recession-
Busting Life
The bulk of your income probably goes to your everyday
home life. By cutting back on your household expenses —
groceries, energy bills, auto and home maintenance
costs, for example — you can save enough to put your
personal finances on steadier ground. And here’s a
secret: Reducing household expenses doesn’t require
that you downscale to a pup tent and a pot of beans. The
tips in this part tell you how.
Part V: Making the Most of
Holidays and Other Special
Events
Who says recessions have to be a drag? Nearly everyone,
actually. But that doesn’t mean you have to forego life’s
pleasures. This part offers tips on how to keep the good
times rolling in a way that doesn’t send your bank

account into the red after every holiday or special event.
In fact, you’ll likely discover that being more thoughtful
about what you spend results in more meaningful 
celebrations.
Part VI: Staying Afloat if the
Boat Starts to Sink
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, things spiral out of
control. If you find yourself facing out-of-control credit,
bankruptcy, or foreclosure, your choices can determine
how much you lose and how long it’ll take you to recover.
This part gives suggestions that can help you make the
right decisions.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Want to know ten ways to handle financial hurdles? How
about ten ways to trim the money tree? Then this part is
for you.
Icons Used in This Book
Many people, when facing stressful times, become very
focused. In addition to myriad tips, this book uses the fol-
lowing icons to highlight information:
This icon appears beside especially important informa-
tion: stuff that you absolutely need to know to make
informed, wise decisions.

When times are tough and money is tight, mistakes are
especially dangerous. This icon warns you about things
that may have serious negative consequences.
Where to Go from Here
Whether you read this book from front to back or jump in
and out as the need arises, you’re certain to find a variety
of ways to cut your expenses and stabilize your finances.
Look at the Table of Contents to find general categories of
tips, look in the index to find specific tips, or just flip
through until something catches your eye.

In this part . . .
R
ising costs, falling income, uncertain employ-
ment, and no real idea how long the downturn
will last: Harbingers like these can make anyone feel
that economic stability is slipping beyond his
grasp. Although it’s true you can’t control what’s
going on with the economy (even the Federal
Reserve seems to be having a particularly difficult
time of it lately!), you can take hold of your own
finances and your attitude. And because everyone
deserves a break during stressful times, this part
also gives you some useful relaxation tips.

#1
Determine Your Net Worth
A
net worth statement is simply a listing of all you own
and all you owe; the difference between the two is
your net worth. Your net worth is like a financial report
card. Knowing your net worth gives you a good idea of
your financial situation.
To figure out your net worth, fill out the following work-
sheet. This information becomes a benchmark you can
use to measure your current financial status relative to
others and to where you want to be, from year to year.
Unhappy with your net worth?
If your net worth isn’t what you want it to be, don’t despair. Prioritize both
your assets and your liabilities. Which assets are most important to you
and your standard of living? Are there any you could do without? Which
liabilities need to be paid off first? Consider interest rates and other terms
for any loan you have, and then come up with a plan to pay down your
debt. Part III can help.

Calculate Spendable Income
T
o figure out your spendable income, first gather two
to four copies of recent paycheck stubs and complete
the worksheet that accompanies this tip. Note: Some
deductions occur monthly rather than per pay period, so
two to four consecutive paychecks should reveal all
deductions. If you receive two paychecks per month and
a certain deduction occurs only on the first paycheck,
divide this amount by 2 when completing the worksheet.

Subtract Required Expenses
Your required expenses, or needs, must come first. To
figure out what your required expenses are, fill out the
next worksheet. (Sorry — no enhanced phone services,
cellphones, cable TV, or high-speed Internet, unless
required for employment, are included in needs.)
Cut back on unrequired expenses
You can reduce the amount of money you spend in all kinds of ways, and
many of them don’t require that you reduce your standard of living —
only that you make more deliberate decisions about what’s important to
you and what you need. For example, consider the following:
 Can you change your phone package to eliminate the services you
don’t use and the fees associated with them?
 Can you downgrade your cable package to save money and still get
the majority of the channels that matter most to you?
 Are you paying a monthly service fee to have a checking account?
You don’t have to; you can find lots of options on the Internet and in
your community.
 Are you paying an annual fee for your credit card? Are you getting
substantial value out of paying that fee? If not, cancel that card and

Solve for Shortfalls
If you have a shortfall after you calculate your required
expenses (refer to the preceding worksheet), something’s
gotta give. Consider the following suggestions when
you’re faced with a shortfall:
 Don’t completely cut any required expenditures.
You may be tempted to drop insurance coverage
and/or save the amount of money you need to be
saving for a rainy day. You aren’t doing yourself any
favors by skipping these items, and the decision will
come back to haunt you sooner or later.

 Review each of the needs categories and consider
ways to reduce necessary expenses. You may be
able to obtain less expensive insurance and save
money on groceries, clothing, and transportation by
shopping around.
 Consider your employment. Often, the only reason-
able option you, your spouse, or your partner has is
to increase income by working overtime (if that’s an
option), taking on a part-time job, or changing jobs.
Tracking your expenses is especially useful when your
outgoing cash flow exceeds your income. For a clear pic-
ture of what you’re spending money on (you’ll be sur-
prised how much you fritter away), keep a log of every
cent you spend. Write down everything, whether you pur-
chase a soda at work, buy gasoline on the way home, or
go to the movies. Also track whether you paid by cash,
check, or debit or credit card; who you paid; and whether
the expenditure falls into the need or want category.

Create a Monthly Budget
D
oes the word budget send chills up your spine? It
shouldn’t. Budgets allow you to be organized and
have some control over what you spend. They help you
to decide how to spend your money, plan for your future,
pay off existing debt, and save a few pennies each month
by reducing wasteful and impulsive purchases.
Step 1: Categorize Your Expenses
When you begin setting up a monthly budget, start with
big categories before breaking your budget down into
smaller expense categories. A good list of basic budget
categories to begin with includes the following:
 Housing: Mortgage/rent, repairs, property taxes,
cleaning supplies, homeowner’s/renter’s insurance,
utilities, furnishings, decor
 Food: Groceries, meals out, pizza delivery, snacks
and beverages at work
 Transportation: Car payments, insurance, gas, oil
changes, parking, repairs and maintenance, public
transportation fees

 Medical: Insurance, out-of-pocket expenses such as
deductibles and non-insurance covered medical
services, pharmacy, eye care, dental
 Clothing: New purchases, dry cleaning, repair
 Personal: Cosmetics, haircuts, cleansers
 Insurance: Life insurance and any other insurance
not covered under home, transportation, or medical
expenses
 Education: Tuition, dues/fees, school pictures, year-
books, school supplies, books
 Credit accounts: Major credit cards, department
store cards, lines of credit through your bank or
other lender, any other outstanding debt
 Gifts: Holidays, birthdays, graduations, weddings,
showers
 Recreation: Vacations, movies, books, magazines,
newspapers, cable TV, restaurants, sporting events,
sports equipment
 Savings: Long-term and short-term goals, as well as
retirement
 Taxes: Property and excise tax, for example
 Donations: Charities, religious groups, and so on
Be sure to set aside money each month for those yearly
and quarterly payments that often sneak up on you when
you least expect them. If you spend $1,200 on your yearly
property taxes, divide that number by 12 and set aside
$100 per month so you aren’t caught off guard by your
property taxes, insurance payments, or any other peri-
odic bills.
Create a Monthly Budget 21

Within each general budget category, some items are
essential (the mortgage or rent payment, electric bill, and
groceries); others are extra (new furniture, gifts, and pizza
delivery). From your first list of general budget items,
develop two separate budget lists, one for essentials and
the other for extras. Then look through these lists to find
flexible budget expenses where you can cut back by using
the tips and advice throughout this book. Put a star next to
these flexible items so you can identify them.
Step 2: Estimate What You Spend
Go through your checkbook and any other receipts or
records you’ve kept over the past few months so you can
track how much you actually spend on essentials. Then
for one month, keep a detailed diary of all your extra pur-
chases, even for cheap things like newspapers or coffee
from the vending machine at work. Little expenses
quickly add up to big money when they’re made on a
daily basis. These smaller, out-of-pocket purchases are
frequently made with cash, so they usually don’t show up
in your check register; writing them down makes you
aware of where the cash is dribbling out of your life.
For keeping track of your budget, take a look at office
supply stores for an easy-to-use, inexpensive family 
budgeting book. If you want something small that you 
can carry with you at all times, the BudgetMap (budget
map.com) is a specially designed ledger that fits in your
personal checkbook and takes the fuss out of making and
sticking to a budget.
Part I: Facing Off Against a Recession 
22

Step 3: Calculate and Adjust
Are your spending habits keeping you in the red? To find
out, add up the essentials list and the extras list separately.
Subtract the essentials total from your monthly income. If
you have money left over, subtract the extras total from
that amount. If you still have money left over, great! Look
into a savings or investing plan (talk to your bank or a certi-
fied financial planner for help setting up a plan).
If your extras list takes you into negative numbers, start
looking for places to cut back (for example, cancel your
newspaper delivery or eat out once a month instead of
once a week). You can also trim from the extras list to put
more money toward debt repayment if that’s a high prior-
ity in your financial picture.

Breathe Away Tension
A
s the economy heads south and you tighten your
budget to keep spending under control, stress and
tension creep into your life. You can’t control the econ-
omy, but that’s okay — truly living well is about far more
than money. On the other hand, no matter how good
things get, stress always leeches the fun out of the good
life. Breathing properly is one of the simplest and best
ways to drain your tension and relieve your stress.
Simply by changing your breathing patterns, you can rap-
idly induce a state of greater relaxation. If you control the
way you breathe, you have a powerful tool in reducing
bodily tension and increasing your joie de vivre.
Change the Way You Breathe
Changing the way you breathe can change the way you
feel. Here’s one of the best and simplest ways of introduc-
ing yourself to stress-relieving breathing:
1. Lie down or sit comfortably, and put one hand on
your belly and your other hand on your chest.

2. Inhale through your nose, making sure the
hand on your belly rises and the hand on your
chest moves hardly at all.
3. As you inhale slowly, count silently to three.
4. As you exhale, slowly count to four, feeling the
hand on your belly falling gently.
Pause slightly before your next breath.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 for several minutes
and whenever you get the chance.
Breathe through an Emergency
Breathing properly is no big deal when you’re lying on
your bed or vegging out in front of the TV. But what’s
your breathing like when you’re caught in gridlock, when
you’re facing down a deadline, or when the stock market
drops 20 percent? You’re now in a crisis mode. You need
another form of breathing. Here’s what to do:
1. Inhale slowly through your nostrils, taking in a
very deep diaphragmatic breath.
Fill both your lungs and your cheeks.
2. Hold that breath for about six seconds.
3. Exhale slowly through your slightly parted lips,
releasing all the air in your lungs.
Pause at the end of this exhalation.
4. Now take a few normal breaths.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 two or three times and
then return to what you were doing.
This form of deep breathing should put you in a more
relaxed state.

Tense Your Way to Relaxation
T
he uncertainty of a faltering economy can tie anyone
in knots, despite even the best of efforts to keep
things in perspective, set priorities, and take control.
Fortunately, one of the better relaxation techniques actu-
ally uses tense muscles to your benefit. It derives from a
method called progressive relaxation, or deep muscle
relaxation.
This method is based on the notion that you aren’t aware
of what your muscles feel like when they’re tensed. By
purposely tensing your muscles, you’re able to recognize
what tension feels like and identify which muscles are
creating that tension. This technique is highly effective
and has been proven to be a valuable tool for quickly
reducing muscle tension and promoting relaxation.
Relax Your Body, Part by Part
When you have some time, follow these steps for progres-
sive relaxation:
1. Lie down or sit, as comfortably as you can, and
close your eyes.
Find a quiet, dimly lit place that gives you some
privacy, at least for a while.

2. Tense the muscles of a particular body part.
To practice, start by tensing your right hand and
arm. Begin by making a fist. As you clench your
fist, notice the tension and strain in your hand
and forearm. Without releasing that tension, bend
your right arm and flex your biceps, making a
muscle the way you might to impress the kids in
the schoolyard.
Don’t strain yourself in any of these muscle tens-
ing maneuvers. When you tense a muscle group,
don’t tense as hard as you can. Tense about 3⁄4 of
what you can do. If you feel pain or soreness,
ease up on the tension, and if you still hurt, defer
your practice until another time.
3. Hold the tension in the body part for about ten
seconds.
4. Let go of the tension fairly quickly, letting the
muscles go limp.
Notice the difference in the way your hand and
arm feel. Notice the difference in feelings
between the sensations of tension and those of
relaxation. Let these feeling of relaxation deepen
for about 30 seconds or so.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4, using the same
muscle group.
6. Move to another muscle group.
Simply repeat Steps 1 through 4, substituting a
different muscle group each time. Continue with
your left hand and arm and then work your way
through the major muscle groups listed in the fol-
lowing section.
Tense Your Way to Relaxation 27

After you finish relaxing each of these areas, let your
body sink into an even deeper state of relaxation. Let go
more and more. Mentally go over the sensations you’re
feeling in your arms, face, neck, shoulders, back, stom-
ach, and legs. Feel your body becoming looser and more
relaxed. Savor the feeling.
Use the Quickie Method
When pressed for time, you can use a quickie version of
the progressive relaxation exercise explained in the pre-
ceding section. This technique compresses all the muscle
tensing and relaxing sequences into one. Think of it as
one gigantic scrunch.
In order to do this, you have to master the gradual ver-
sion first. The success of this rapid form of relaxation
depends on your ability to create and release muscle ten-
sion quickly, skills you master by slowly working through
all the muscle groups individually. Here’s what to do:
1. Sit or lie comfortably in a room that’s quiet and
relatively free of distractions.
2. Tense all the muscle-groups listed here, 
simultaneously:
• Clench both fists, bend both arms and
tense your biceps.
• Lift both legs until you notice a moderate
degree of tension and discomfort.
• Scrunch up your face, closing your eyes,
furrowing your brow, clenching your jaws,
and pursing your lips.
Part I: Facing Off Against a Recession 
28

• Bring your shoulders as close as you can to
your ears.
• Tense your stomach muscles.
3. Hold this total scrunch for about five seconds
and then release, letting go of any and all 
tension.
Let your legs fall to the floor or bed, let your
arms fall to your sides, and let the rest of your
body return to a relaxed position.
Repeat this sequence at various points throughout 
your day.

Stretch Away Your Stress
S
tretching is one way your body naturally discharges
excess tension. You automatically feel the need for a
stretch when you wake up in the morning and just before
retiring at night. But a good stretch can drain away much
of your body’s tension at other times, too. You may be
deskbound or sitting for long periods of time during the
day, causing your muscles to tense and tighten. Consider
adopting one or more basic stretches and taking a
stretch-break at various points throughout the day.
Following are two tension-relieving stretches that help
you drain off a lot of excess tension. They’re simple and
shouldn’t evoke much comment or ridicule from friends
or co-workers.
 The Twist: This stretch is great for your upper body.
Sitting or standing, put both your hands behind the
back of your head, locking your fingers together.
Move your elbows towards each other until you feel
some moderate tension. Now twist your body
slightly, first to the right for a few seconds and then
slowly to the left. When you finish, let your arms fall
to your side.

 The Leg-lift: This stretch is good for your lower
body. Sitting in your chair, raise both your legs until
you feel a comfortable level of tightness in them.
Maintaining that tension, flex and point your toes
toward your head. Hold that tension for about ten
seconds or so and then let your legs fall to the floor.
If doing this with both legs together is a wee bit
uncomfortable, try it one leg at a time.
Stretch slowly and don’t overdo it. You’re trying to relax
your muscles, not punish them.
Stretch Away Your Stress 31
Find a local yoga class
If the deep breathing and stretching exercises in this Part appeal to you,
consider giving yoga a try. In addition to the benefits from exercise and
meditation, some yoga practices actually focus on things like content-
ment and abstaining from an attachment to possessions — two defini-
tive steps toward living well, regardless of the economy! If yoga seems
too trendy or New Age, remember that this practice has endured for
thousands of years.

Lift a Finger for Self-Massage
W
ith all the stress and turmoil going on in the world
and in your own budget, you could probably use a
good massage to release some tension. Hold onto your
cash and let your fingers do the work.
For Your Hands
Hold your left palm in front of you, fingers together. The
fleshy spot between your thumb and index finger is a key
acupressure point that should spread a sensation of
relaxation when massaged. Using your right thumb, mas-
sage this spot in a circular motion for a slow count of 15.
Switch hands and repeat.
For stress-related fatigue, pinch just below the first joint
of your pinkie with the thumb and index finger of the
opposite hand. (Pressure should be firm but not painful.)
Increase the pressure slightly. Make small circular move-
ments in a counterclockwise direction while maintaining
pressure. Continue for 20 seconds. Release. Wait for ten
seconds and repeat up to five times.

For Your Feet
Try this sole-soothing exercise. Take off your socks and
shoes and sit comfortably with one leg crossed over the
other. (The sole of your foot should be almost facing
you.) With both hands, grasp the arches of your foot and
apply pressure, especially with your thumbs. Knead
every part of your foot (like you would bread dough,
using your thumbs and fingers), working your way from
your heel right up to your toes. Give each of your toes a
squeeze. Now massage the other foot in a similar way.
If crossing your legs is more stressful than it used to be,
go to the kitchen and get your rolling pin. Sit in a chair
and position the rolling pin next to your foot. Gently roll
your bare foot back and forth slowly for two minutes or
so. Then try it with the other foot. Now wash the pin. If
you don’t own a rolling pin, work with a tennis ball. Place
it under the arch of your bare foot, put some pressure on
that foot, and move the ball backward and forward. Keep
this rhythm going for about two minutes, and then switch
to your other foot.
For Your Neck and Shoulders
Stress most often finds its way to your neck and shoul-
ders. To dissipate that tension, take your left hand and
firmly massage your right shoulder and the right side of
your neck. Start with some gentle circular motions, rub-
bing the muscle with your index and middle fingers. Then
finish with a firmer massage, squeezing the shoulder and
neck muscles between your thumb and other fingers.
Now switch to the other side.
Lift a Finger for Self-Massage 33

For Your Face
Start by placing both of your hands on your face with the
tips of your fingers resting on your forehead and the
heels of your palms resting just under your cheeks.
Gently pull down the skin on your forehead with the tips
of your fingers while pushing up the area under your
palms. Rhythmically repeat this movement, contracting
and releasing your fingers and palms. You can also try
pulling on your ears in different directions.

Practice Habits of Effective
Stress Managers
T
he following is a short list of the qualities most
important for reducing stress and creating stress
resilience:
 Practice relaxation techniques. You need to know
how to let go of tension and be able to relax your
body and quiet your mind.
 Eat right and exercise often. Be careful about what
you put into your mouth. Engage in some form of
physical activity regularly during the week.
 Get enough sleep. Try not to burn the candle at
both ends. Get to sleep at an hour that ensures you
can get enough rest.
 Don’t worry about the unimportant stuff. Know the
difference between what’s truly important and
what’s not. Put things into perspective.
 Don’t get angry often. Avoid losing your temper,
but if you do become angry, try to remain in control
of your anger so that it doesn’t become destructive.
 Get organized. Feel a sense of control over your
environment. A cluttered and disorganized life leads
to a stressed life.

 Manage your time effectively. Be in control of your
schedule.
 Have and make use of a strong social support
system. Spend time with your family, friends, and
acquaintances. Have people in your life who listen
to you and care for you.
 Live according to your values. Make sure that you
spend your energy and time on things that are
meaningful to you and that your goals are significant
and worthwhile.
 Have a good sense of humor. Laugh at life’s hassles
and annoyances. Don’t take yourself too seriously.
If you realize that you currently employ only some (or
none!) of the habits in this list, don’t worry — you can
change old habits and learn new ones. Managing your
stress isn’t a magical process; rather, it’s one that means
mastering new behaviors and finding new ways of looking
at yourself and your world.

you can increase your income by changing the way

Update and Customize Your
Resume
W
hen you see a job that you hope has your name
on it, you won’t have time to start from scratch
and write a targeted resume that shows why you’re the
one to interview. The answer is to begin building a core
resume — a basic resume that you customize — before
the pressure hits. Use this resume as a base to spin off
targeted editions when you need to move quickly.
Constructing a targeted resume is easier when you follow
this three-step game plan.
Step 1: Prepare Your 
Core Resume
Probe your memory to jot down every factor in your
background that you could use to customize a resume,
from experience and education to competencies and
skills. This draft is your working model, a resume you’ll
never submit to an employer but a rich well you’ll draw
from time and time again. Use as many pages as you need.

Part II: Bumping Up Your Bring-Home 
40
When you begin drafting your core resume, consider the
following four categories of essential information:
 Education: List your highest degree first — type of
degree, major, school name, and date awarded. If
you have a college degree, omit high school or prep
school. If you have a vocational-technical school
certificate or diploma that required less than a year
to obtain, list your high school as well.
 Experience: Describe — with quantified achieve-
ments — your present and previous positions in
reverse chronological order. Include specific job
titles, company names and locations, and dates of
employment. Show progression and promotions
within an organization, especially if you’ve been
with one employer for eons.
 Skills: Skills today are the heart and soul of job find-
ing, and as such, they encompass a variety of experi-
ences. In job-search terms, a skill is any identifiable
ability or fact that employers value and will pay for.
That means that “five years” is a skill, just as “word
processing” is a skill; employers pay for experience.
 Competencies: A competency-based approach is a
method that focuses on the skills, talents, and
behaviors needed to perform a particular task to a
certain standard. Although not all businesses use
this hiring approach, some — usually larger, sophis-
ticated employers — do.

Step 2: Research Job
Requirements
If you’re responding to a specific advertised job, jot down
the requirements that the ad lists. Don’t confuse the job
duties and the stated requirements. Deal first with the
requirements and then see how you can show experience
or education that matches the most important job duties.
When you’re not responding to a specific advertised job
but are posting your resume in an online database, study
many job ads to figure out the most commonly requested
qualifications for a given occupation or career field.
Step 3: Customize Each 
Spinoff Resume
After compiling the requirements you must satisfy in a
tailor-made resume, scour your core resume to see
whether you can add secondary items mentioned in the
ad that further improve your chances. Then start writing.
Never forget the resume-interview connection. To nab
one of the better jobs and to move up the rewards chain,
your targeted resume has to attract a decision-maker
who will invite you to an interview to further explain how
you can give that employer precisely what his or her
organization says it wants and needs to succeed. If your
employer wants A, you offer A. If your employer wants B,
you offer B.
Update and Customize Your Resume 41

To accomplish this custom-fit hiring, make sure your tar-
geted resume convinces the employer that your value
proposition (a buzzword meaning reason for hire) is a per-
fect fit for the job, not a maybe fit for the job. Meet as
many of the employer’s requirements as you truthfully
can. Admittedly, doing so isn’t a walk in the park. In a
world growing not only more global but also more com-
plex, expect to do some head scratching and creative
thinking from time to time.

Make Your Resume Stand Out
H
ow much are you worth to employers? When
employment rates are stagnant and many compa-
nies are freezing or slowing hiring, you want to make sure
your resume inspires employers to answer that question
with “a lot.” To do so, create a resume that’s a compelling
portrait of your strengths and skills.
Don’t Tell It — Sell It
Basic descriptions of what you did on a job are boring.
You want to instill excitement! List your background
facts, but make sure you position them as end-user
(employer) benefits. To sell your value and your benefits
to an employer who has the power to hire you is to get
specific. Communicate the importance of what you’ve
done by using details — numbers, names, achievements,
outcomes, volume of sales or savings, and size of con-
tracts, for example.
Focus Your Resume
When your resume looks as though it’ll collapse under
the weight of a mishmash of jobs unconnected to your
present target, eliminate your previous trivial pursuits.

Group the consequential jobs under a heading that says
Relevant Work Experience Summary. If this approach
solves one problem — the busy resume — but creates
another, such as a gaping hole where you removed incon-
sequential jobs, create a second, abbreviated work his-
tory section that covers those holes, labeling it Other
Experience.
Use Keywords
Recruiters and employers use keywords to search and
retrieve e-resumes in databases for available positions.
Employers search for keywords — chiefly nouns and
short phrases, but also adjectives and action verbs —
when trying to fill a position; they name the essential
hard skills and knowledge needed to do the job.
When you use industry abbreviations (for example, “ROI”
for return on investment), spell out the term at least once
in your resume. Even though many systems are smarter
than they used to be, a lot of older technology products
out there won’t get it unless you spell it out.
Massage Your Years of
Experience
Sometimes a job posting calls for a specific number of
years of experience — say, three years of experience. If
you come up short — with only two years of experience,
for example — but you know you can do the job, the
basic technique is to work with what you have. Dissect
your two years of experience and then add a statement in
Part II: Bumping Up Your Bring-Home 
44

parentheses that says “skills acquired equivalent to three
years of experience.” The expansion technique doesn’t
work every time, but it’s worth a shot.
Address Negative Perceptions
Even when it wasn’t at your initiative, holding five or
more jobs in ten years can brand you as a job hopper.
Currently being out of work underscores that impression.
Even employers who are guilty of round after round of
employee dismissals instinctively flinch at candidates
they perceive to be hopping around. Take pains to
reverse that disapproval. When you draft your resume,
post a list of negative perceptions on your desk; when
you’re finished writing, compare your resume with the
list. Offer information that changes negative perceptions
of you as a job hopper.

Get Acquainted with New
Interview Trends
A
re you having trouble staking out your future
because you can’t close the sale during interviews?
Recharge with knowledge of the new trends and changing
developments that impact your job interviews.
 Expect new kinds of interviewers. If the last time
you interviewed you went one-to-one with a single
interviewer, get ready for a different set of question-
ers, like a veteran team of six managers — individu-
ally or collectively; a hiring manager (especially in
technical and retail fields) who’s two decades
younger than you; or someone of an ethnicity and
heritage different from yours.
 Be prepared to answer the direct or implied ques-
tion, “What can you do for our company immedi-
ately?” Because you can’t count on being on the job
more than a few years — or in contract assignments,
a few months — the hiring spotlight lasers in on
skills you can use from Day One.
 Be prepared for a video interview. Computer
Webcams make it easy and cheap for an employer
and job seeker to see and talk to each other no
matter where each is hanging out — around the

block or around the globe. Video interviews may
also replace phone screening interviews.
 Focus on fitting in. Disappointed job seekers who
ask employers why they didn’t get hired are often
told they aren’t the best fit for the job. In the work-
place, “fit” refers to how an individual fits into a
company’s culture. Instead of losing sleep over a fit-
based turn-down, move on. Do better pre-interview
research so you don’t waste time on companies
well-known for being a fortress of round holes when
you’re a square peg.
 Cut the loyalty oath. At some point you’ll be asked,
“Why do you want to work here?” The old “I’m look-
ing for a home and I’ll be loyal to you forever” state-
ments don’t play as well as they once did. Instead of
pledging eternal fidelity, discuss your desire to do
the work. Talk about how you’re driven to funnel
substantial amounts of productivity into the job
quickly. Talk about wanting to use your superior
technology skills. Talk about your interest in work
that excites you, work that matters. Talk about work
that — with its combination of work-life balance and
stimulating tasks — is too tempting to pass by.
 Revisit the dramatic pause. A pause is effective
body language and works great in face-to-face inter-
views. But in telephone or online video interviewing,
dead air time can make you appear dull-witted
rather than contemplative. Exercise judgment in
using the reflective pause as a communications tool.
(When you just don’t know the answer immediately,
that’s another story; stall by asking for clarification.)
Get Acquainted with New Interview Trends 47

 Polish your storytelling skills. Interviewers ask can-
didates to tell them a story of a time when they
reacted to such and such a situation. How did you
handle an angry customer? Can describe an example
of a significant achievement in your last job? The
more success stories you can drag in from your
past, the more likely those interviewers using this
approach will highly rate your chances of achieving
equivalent success in the future.
 Learn new lines for small-business jobs. As layoffs
and downsizing increase, prime-timers are discover-
ing that the small company sector is where the
action is for them. Interviewers at big companies
and small companies have different agendas.
Emphasize different aspects of your work personal-
ity than those you emphasize when interviewing for
a big company.

Stand Out in an Interview
T
hese ten super tips are sure to make the hiring gods
favor you at job interviews. Read on to get hired:
 Be prepared. Preparation makes all the difference in
whether you get the best offers as you face intense
scrutiny, probing questions, and employers who are
afraid of making hiring mistakes. You must show
that you’re tuned in to the company’s needs, that
you have the skills to get up to speed quickly, and
that you’re a hand-in-glove fit with the company.
Fortunately, never before has so much information
about companies and industries been so easily
accessible, both in print and online.
 Distinguish screening from selection interviews.
The purpose of the typical screening interview is to
weed out all applicants except the best qualified.
Screeners can reject, but they can’t hire. During this
interview, be pleasant and neutral. Volunteer no
strong opinions. Raise no topics, except to reinforce
your qualifications. If you make it past the screening
interview, you’re passed on to a hiring manager or
panel who makes the selection. At this interview,
move from neutral into high gear if the person doing
the interview will be your boss or colleague. No
more bland behavior — turn up the wattage on your
personality power. This is the best time to find out

whether you’ll hit it off with the boss or colleagues
or fit into the company culture.
 Verify early what interviewers want. Almost as
soon as you’re seated, ask the interviewer to
describe the scope of the position and the qualifica-
tions of the ideal person for that position. The goal
here is to confirm your research. If you’re wrong,
you must know immediately that you need to shift
direction. Confirming your research or gaining this
information on the spot is the key to the entire inter-
view. This technique permits you to focus on the
factors on which the hiring decision is made, with-
out taking verbal detours that don’t advance your
candidacy.
 Connect all your qualifications with a job’s
requirements. If a quick glance at your notes
reminds you that the interviewer missed a require-
ment or two listed in the job posting when describ-
ing the position’s scope and the ideal person for it,
help the interviewer by tactfully bringing up the
missing criteria yourself.
 Master a one-to-two-minute commercial about
yourself. Almost certainly you’ll be asked to
respond to some version of the “Tell me about your-
self” question. For your answer, memorize a short
description of your background (education, experi-
ence, and skills) that matches your strengths to the
job. After briefly relating the facts of your back-
ground, add a sentence or two about your curiosity,
commitment, and drive to build mountains atop
your already good skills base. A few well-chosen
words enliven a dry recitation of facts with a splash
of your personality.
Part II: Bumping Up Your Bring-Home 
50

 Allow the interviewer to direct the improv. Some
job search advisers seem to suggest that you take
charge of the interview, directing the discussion in
your favor. Not such a hot idea. Wrestling the inter-
viewer for control can easily backfire when you
appear to be usurping the interviewer’s prerogative.
 Try not to talk money until you know they want
you. When the salary question comes up at the begin-
ning of an interview, say that money isn’t your most
important consideration (and it really shouldn’t be at
this point). Only when you know the scope of the
position and its market value — and that the com-
pany wants to hire you — are the stars in alignment
to bargain in your best interest.

Nail the Video Interview
V
ideo interviewing (a form of videoconferencing) is a
live, two-way electronic communication that permits
two or more people in different geographic locations to
engage in face-to-face visual and audio exchange. Miles
separate them: sometimes few, sometimes many, and
sometimes oceans. As companies look to trim expenses
associated with interviewing and hiring, video interview-
ing is becoming more common.
The content of a video interview is much the same as
that of an in-person interview, but the execution differs.
For example, lag time occurs when data is compressed
and sent from one location to another. Remember to
allow for the delay and not step on the interviewer’s
lines, and don’t be surprised if the interviewer inadver-
tently cuts you off in mid-sentence. In addition, you may
feel performance pressure. When it’s your turn to speak,
you have very little time to look away, down, up, or side-
ways to process your thoughts. When the green light
goes on, the pressure on you is somewhat like that on a
contestant at a quiz show: talk or walk.
Here are some tips to help you gracefully navigate your
way through a video interview:

 Send materials for show-and-tell in advance if the
interviewer wants to ask questions about an
updated resume or project.
 Run a technical check to make sure all video equip-
ment is functioning properly.
 Pay attention to your appearance.
 Keep your movements calm.
 Introduce yourself simply and remember the sound
delay.
 Look directly at the camera as often as possible
when speaking.
 Let the interviewer end the interview.
 Sign off with a virtual handshake. You can say some-
thing as simple as “Thank you for interviewing me. I
enjoyed it. Let’s talk face to face very soon.” When
you’re in a professional setting, push the mute
button and leave the room. When you’re at home,
mute the mike and close the camera.

Make the Most of a Phone
Interview
A
lmost everyone knows someone who’s been con-
tacted by a recruiter for a screening interview.
Sometimes the recruiter purposely tries to catch you off
guard, hoping surprise strips away the outer layers of
your preparation, exposing genuine, unrehearsed
thoughts and feelings. These recruiters also see unantici-
pated calls as useful for measuring your ability to think
on your feet. Because most people don’t prepare for over-
the-phone screening interviews as rigorously as they pre-
pare for face-to-face meetings, the casualty fallout is
heavy.
If you don’t like surprises, schedule an appointment for
your phone interview. You don’t want to answer ques-
tions on the fly when the call comes in because you won’t
be prepared and you won’t do your best. Instead, say
you’re walking out the door to a meeting across town and
will call back as soon as you can.
Before your phone interview, make sure you have all your
essentials where you can access them easily during the
interview. Must-haves include your current resume, a list
of your professional accomplishments and brief stories
that illustrate your qualifications, background information

on the employer, questions about the company and posi-
tion, and a calendar with all scheduled commitments and
open dates.
When the time comes for your phone interview, follow
these tips for optimal success:
 If you have a home office, use it. If not, take your
phone into a quiet room stocked with all your inter-
view essentials.
 Gather essential information from the caller.
 Don’t rush or drone on.
 Be a champion listener.
 Get specific.
 Punt the salary question. When the phone screener
asks how much money you want, evade the question
for now. Wait until a face-to-face interview to talk
money (see Tip #12, “Stand Out in an Interview,” for
details).
 Push for a meeting. As the call winds to a close, go
for the prize: “As we talk, I’m thinking we can better
discuss my qualifications for [position title] in
person. I can be at your office Thursday morning. Is
9:30 good, or is there a better time for you?”
When the interviewer agrees but can’t set a specific
time, simply suggest when you’re available and ask
when would be a good time to follow up. What you
want is an in-person meeting. Assume you’ll get it
and give the interviewer a choice as to the time.

Look for Good Jobs Online
T
he Internet makes uncovering hoards of job opportu-
nities easier than ever; the trick is to find the right
ones for you. As you launch your job-finding campaign,
start with vertical job search engines as a destination for
your targeted resumes; if you don’t seem to be scoring
winners, add general and niche job boards.
Use Vertical Job Search Engines
Vertical search engines — also called verticals or VJSEs or
aggregators — are the job seeker’s new best friends, and
they’re changing the online recruitment game in dramatic
ways. You can think of VJSEs as “Google for jobs.” That is,
the verticals work as a search engine, except they search
only for job listings.
With verticals, you go to one place and see virtually all
the jobs that fit your personal criteria on the Internet.
The best-known verticals include the following:
 SimplyHired.com
 Indeed.com
 Jobster.com

 GetTheJob.com
 Yahoo! HotJobs (hotjobs.yahoo.com)
Here are the general steps you’re likely to follow when
using a vertical search engine:
1. Create a personal account.
2. Decide how often to receive the jobs: daily,
weekly, and so on.
3. Set preferences indicating which jobs you’re
shown.
4. Become familiar with related options on the
vertical site.
5. Narrow your search.
6. Track and save your searches.
7. Upgrade to an advanced search if you need it.
Check the Job Boards
If you’ve been in the job market during the past 15 years
or so, you probably know that a job board is a Web site
where you can look for a job. Employers pay job boards
to post their open positions. Job seekers typically view
job listings for free.
You can apply through a job board for specific positions,
or you can post your resume in the board’s resume data-
base. When you mouse aboard a job board, you can
search for job listings by career field, occupation, job
title, location, and job detail keywords. The emphasis is
on local job markets because most people won’t move for
a job unless they have little choice.
Look for Good Jobs Online 57

You find job boards in two basic flavors:
 General job boards, such as CareerBuilder.com and
Monster.com, cover all kinds of jobs.
 Specialty (or niche) job boards cover a specific
group of jobs, according to factors like industry
(EducationAmerica.net), geography
(AtlantaRecruiter.com), or job-seeker qualifications
(MBACareers.com).
Job boards are established hunting grounds for vertical
job search engines. You can, of course, skip the verticals
if you prefer and go straight to a job board. Many people
do. Go to www.topjobsites.com to get the latest site
rankings, which are published monthly.

Look into Federal Jobs
I
f you’ve ever thought about looking into a federal job,
time’s wasting. Uncle Sam’s 1.8 million civilian work-
force (not counting postal service employees) averages
20,000 vacancies every day. Benefits are handsome: great
health insurance, decent retirement plans, and flexible
leave. Annual pay raises — often 3 to 4 percent — are
automatic. You may not even have to relocate; many fed-
eral jobs exist in locales across America and even over-
seas. The number-one way to spot a federal job that may
interest you is to visit the official USA Web site
(www.usajobs.gov). You can even search by salary.
As you pursue a federal job, keep in mind that federal
resumes tend to be longer and require information not
typically found on private-sector resumes. In addition, 
federal language is more bureaucratic than that of private-
sector documents. Read the federal vacancy announce-
ments (recruitment advertisements) carefully to get it
right, and pay special attention to the qualifications and
KSA (knowledge-skills-abilities) requirements.

Prepare for a Career Change
A
s companies trim their workforces and more and
more jobs are farmed out to contractors or sent off-
shore, even once stable and reliable positions are no
longer so stable or reliable. If you’ve built your career in a
field that’s vanishing and now find yourself in the market
for a job, the answer may be to change careers. Making a
career change isn’t the easiest thing to do, but it may be
the smartest. To make the change, follow this advice:
 Connect with others in your intended field. When
your change is voluntary, at least six months in
advance of your leap, join a professional association
of members in the career field or industry where
you want to go. When your change is involuntary
and you’re suddenly left high and dry, scramble to
assemble a skeleton personal network of people
who can guide you into your intended field — and
beef up that network as fast as you can. Make
friends. Find out who’s who and what’s happening
with professionals who can connect you with
employment. Ask what you should read and which
workshops you should attend. Ask whether you can
visit a professional’s workplace as an observer.
 Educate yourself. Seek out short-term certificate
programs and workshops offered during industry
conferences, as well as those available locally. If you
study online, get the scoop on pluses and pitfalls

about distance learning. One starting spot:
www.geteducated.com.
 Bone up on the industry. Even if you’re a nonacade-
mic type who always sneaked light rubbish reads or
sports sections into your study halls, you really can’t
afford to skip hard-core research on your proposed
destination at this time in your life. Those greener
pastures sometimes bleach out when something
about the work isn’t what you expect or can do well.
 Talk the talk. Learn the lingo of prospective new
colleagues. You’ll seem like one of them already.
 Make the experience connection. The bridge you
use to join the old with the new must be rational and
reasonable. Your qualifications have to come from
somewhere — skills you already possess, volunteer
work, part-time jobs, training, hobbies, and so forth.
Strive to present a believable relationship between
your qualifications and the career you’re targeting.
 Accentuate the positive. Don’t say you hope to
change careers because there are no more jobs in
your field. As in any job search, you’re moving
toward a preferred future, not running away from a
bad spot or a toxic boss.
 Tell true stories. Expect to be asked the same kinds
of questions that new graduates often face, such as
some version of “Why shouldn’t we hire someone
more experienced in this line of work?” When you
work out your answers, remember to use story-
telling — that is, to back up your claims of superior
qualities with true examples of achievement.
 Take inventory of your core skills and knowledge.
Sort through to see which skills will cross over to a
different industry or career field. Push them to the
front of your memory where you can find and trans-
late them as needed.

Figure Out What You Really
Want to Do
A
s in finding a mate, choosing a career should
involve both your head and your heart. You may
have a list of potential careers crowding your brain, but
which of those makes sense? If you’re like most career
searchers, you’re not sure. Answering these questions
can help you figure it out:
 What is your worklife mission statement? In one sen-
tence, describe what you most want to accomplish.
If that suggests a career or a career must, write it
down.
 Is there anything you absolutely must have in your
next career? Think of these as the (almost) nonnego-
tiable items, things like a minimum salary, a presti-
gious job title, the opportunity for self-expression, a
specific location, short training time, and so on.
 To be successful and satisfied at work, how do you
want to spend the bulk of your workday? Do you
want to spend it speaking one-on-one or to groups?
How about reading, writing, or working with data,
numbers, or computers? Do you want to work by
yourself? Spend your time convincing people of
something? Work with your hands?

 Describe your dream workday. Does that suggest a
career must or even a career? Think what this day
would look like from the moment you get up until
the moment you go to sleep.
 What do you want your life to look like ten years
from now? Does that suggest the sort of career you
should pursue?
 Do you have specific expertise that you know you
want to use in your career?
 What are your peak accomplishments?
 Write about the last two or three times you felt a
surge of energy at work. Does that suggest a career?
 What do you find easy that many other people find
hard? Many people aren’t sure what their best skills
are. The government-sponsored Skills Profiler may
help (it’s free at www.careerinfonet.org/
acinet/skills/default.aspx).
 What have people complimented you on that may
have career implications? For example, have they
said, “How can you stay so calm in that situation?”
or “You wrote all that in an hour?”
 What are you passionate about?
 What is/was your favorite subject in school?
 If you wrote a book, what would it be about? What do
you most enjoy talking about? The answers to these
questions may suggest a possible career for you.
 Can you think of a type of organization that you’d
love to work for?
 Is there a certain type of person you definitely want
to work with?
Figure Out What You Really Want to Do 63

 What career do your parents, partner, or close
friends think you should pursue?
 If you didn’t care what your family and friends
thought, what career would you pursue?
 What career appeals to you that represents a dra-
matic change from what you’re currently doing?
Sometimes, what you need more than anything is a
change.

Persuade Your Organization to
Let You Telecommute
T
elecommuting can mean big savings. Consider the
expenses associated with a typical workday that
would either vanish or be greatly reduced if you worked
from home: commuting costs (including gas, tolls, and so
on), dining expenses (breakfast from a drive-thru, coffee
during your break, lunch, trips to the snack machine),
childcare expenses, and other expenses like dry-cleaning
for your work clothes. This is, admittedly, a most unsci-
entific guesstimate. But if you’re currently working out-
side your home, track just one week’s worth of your own
in-office expenses and add them up on Saturday. The total
may surprise you.
The big hitch, of course, is getting permission to stay
home. You may have the perfect job for telecommuting.
You may have the perfect home-office setup. The benefits
to your company may be impossible to deny. And you
may still wind up with a nonnegotiable no for an answer.
You can, however, stack the deck in your favor.
Telecommuting, without a doubt, is a win-win arrange-
ment, in which both employer and employee benefit. Use
the following information to help your boss see why.

A corporation has human characteristics. Before it makes
a major change, it wants to know, “What’s in it for me?”
Don’t expect to get anywhere if your only answer is “a
happier employee.” Fortunately, that doesn’t have to be
your only answer. One recent survey, sponsored by AT&T
and conducted by the International Telework Association
& Council (ITAC), found that each telecommuting
employee saved his or her respective employer an aver-
age of more than $10,000 a year by reducing absenteeism
rates, saving the business money on recruitment and
replacement, lowering facilities costs, and increasing 
productivity.
Although this general information is a big help when you
set out to sell your boss on the benefits of telecommut-
ing, you ultimately need to show how telecommuting can
benefit your particular company, your particular depart-
ment, and your particular job:
 Examine how your telecommuting can help your
organization reach its specific goals. For example,
if part of your company’s mission is to provide
excellence in serving its customers (a popular goal
these days), working at home may enable you to
deal with customer queries and complaints at
unusual hours. This ability can be especially useful
if your firm has overseas clients whose workday dif-
fers from yours.
 Do a cost/benefit analysis to compare what your
organization will spend with what it’ll save by
allowing you to telecommute. The idea is to quan-
tify some of those soft numbers and to demonstrate
to your boss (and possibly upper management)
exactly why telecommuting is good for business.
Part II: Bumping Up Your Bring-Home 
66

 Demonstrate that telecommuting will work for
your job. When you can demonstrate that telecom-
muting will benefit your organization, your next task
is to prove that it can be done by someone in your
job — in other words, you. Begin by researching
your own company’s history with telecommuting.
Your company may already have a telecommuting
policy in place, in which case you simply have to
demonstrate that you fit within its parameters. Then
look outside your company to your main competi-
tors and other companies in your field to see
whether they allow telecommuting among their
employees. Finally, find out whether others in your
particular profession are telecommuting.

Also check out government jobs (see Tip # 16, “Look into

telecommuting work arrangements, and many state and
local governments are following the trend. Governments
have a vested interest in combating air pollution, traffic
congestion, and urban overcrowding. Telecommuting
addresses all three problems.

can do successfully as a telecommuter? Don’t turn your
back on a good job prospect just because your prospec-
tive boss assumes you’ll be working onsite. You don’t
know that telecommuting is out of the question for this
job until you actually ask.
Turn contract work into a
telecommuting job
Many telecommuters start out doing contract or free-
lance work for the organizations that eventually hire
them to fill staff positions. This transition is often easier
to make than the one from onsite employee to telecom-
muter. This solution isn’t right for everyone: Being a con-
tract worker can be difficult, and not all jobs lend
themselves to working this way. But it can be an excellent
way to get your foot in the door on your way to a
telecommuting position.

Consider Self-Employment
You live in an era in which highly paid, secure
employee jobs are increasingly reserved for super-
stars. For everyone else, self-employment may be a more
likely route. Do any of these self-employment categories
excite you?
 Distributing the work of creative people: Examples
include being an agent for performers or artists,
being a film distributor, or owning an online art
gallery.
 Replicating a successful business in a different geo-
graphic area: For example, opening a New York–style
pizza place in the South or selling previously best-
selling computer equipment in developing countries.
 Being self-employed in a high-profit-margin, niche
field that has little competition: For example, selling
used parts for 18-wheel trucks.
 Paying $10,000 to $100,000-plus to be shown how to
run a particular business, step by step (buying an
existing business or franchise)
 Turning people’s complaints into a business that
you can start

 Converting a hobby or personal interest into a 
business
 Finding a product or service that you want to sell
 Creating a template for a difficult-to-stage event and
replicating it for different customers: An example 
is staging fundraising auctions for nonprofit 
organizations.
 Starting a grungy business, which means you have
few competitors: Examples include commercial
bathroom maintenance, hazardous waste disposal,
and high-voltage electrical work. (Those aren’t
exactly cool careers, but sometimes making big
money in a mundane career feels cooler than
making chickenfeed in a cool career.)
But not everyone has what it takes. What about you?
These questions can help you decide:
 Do you like being in charge?
 Are you flexible?
 Can you get things done?
 Are you good at solving real-world problems
quickly?
 Are you persistent?
 Do you communicate well?
 Are you willing and able to market and sell?
If you didn’t honestly answer yes to the preceding ques-
tions but are still eager to consider self-employment, you
may want to work as an assistant to a successfully self-
employed person. You’ll either acquire the skills and
mindset you need or realize that you’re wiser to be
employed by someone else.

Get Acquainted with 
Home-Based Businesses
I
f employment options look bleak outside your home,
maybe the answer is inside your home: Consider a
home-based business. Owning your own home-based busi-
ness may be the most rewarding experience of your entire
life. And not just in a financial sense (although many home-
based businesspeople find the financial rewards to be sig-
nificant) but also rewarding in the sense of doing the work
you love and having control over your own life.
Starting and running your own home-based business
offers these advantages:
 You’re the boss. For many owners of home-based
businesses, this reason is enough to justify making
the move out of the 9-to-5.
 You get all the benefits of your hard work. When
you make a profit, it’s all yours. No one else is going
to try to take it away from you (except, perhaps, the
tax man).
 You have the flexibility to work when and where
you want. Perhaps your most productive times
don’t coincide with the standard 9-to-5 work sched-
ule that most regular businesses require their
employees to adhere to.

 You don’t have to deal with as many distractions.
You may find that — because interruptions from co-
workers are no longer an issue and the days of end-
less meetings are left far behind — you’re much
more productive working in your workshop than in
a regular office.
 You get to choose your clients and customers.
When you own your own business, you can fire the
clients you don’t want to work with. Sounds like fun,
doesn’t it?
 You can put as much or as little time into your
business as you like. You can decide whether you
work for only a few hours a day or week or on a full-
time schedule.
These reasons to be on your own are just the tip of the
iceberg. When you add it all up, you’re left with one fun-
damental reason for owning your own home-based busi-
ness: freedom.
Admittedly, starting a home-based business isn’t for
everyone. In fact, for some individuals, it can be a big mis-
take. If, however, you have an entrepreneurial spirit and
you thrive on being independent and in charge of your
life, a home-based business may be just the thing for you.
As you review potential business opportunities, be aware
of your own talents, mission, or passion, and keep them
foremost in your mind, because your success will be
directly proportional to the motivation that you bring to
your work. If you’re a grand hand in the kitchen, for
example, you can become an sales associate for a busi-
ness (like the Pampered Chef) that sells its wares through

Get New-Business 
Cash Flowing
E
very new business starts at the beginning. No matter
how much experience you have in your current job
or how many other businesses you may have started in
the past, when you create a new home-based business,
you’re starting from scratch. The faster you get cash
coming into your business, the better. If you’re still
employed when you start your home-based business, the
sooner you’re able to leave your 9-to-5 job behind. And if
your 9-to-5 job left you, the sooner you’ll be able to
breathe a bit easier.
Start Part-Time
Few businesses — home-based or otherwise — bring in
all the money necessary to get them off the ground and
keep them going for a prolonged period of time within the
first six months of operation. You need a lot of cash —
from a current job, your spouse’s or partner’s job, sav-
ings, loans from friends or family or a bank — to keep
both your business and your personal life going until the
business generates enough revenue to take over.

Although you have to decide for yourself exactly what
schedule to follow while transitioning into a home-based
business, unless you’re unemployed or retired, start your
business on a part-time basis while you’re still holding
down your regular full-time job.
Finance Your Business with
Startup Funds
It takes money to start a business. By lining up sources of
startup funds, you’re able to ease the financial entry into
owning your own home-based business. There are proba-
bly more potential sources of startup funds than you can
ever imagine. But where does this money come from? The
following list gives several suggestions:
 Personal savings
 Credit (these options include a home equity line of
credit, loans from friends and family, loans from
banks or credit unions, credit cards, and microloan
plans)
 If you use a credit card for your business, get one
dedicated solely to business expenses. You’ll have
an easier time figuring your taxes for the year.
 Selling personal assets (such as a boat, extra vehi-
cle, camper, and so on)
 Bartering (Craig’s List, www.craigslist.org, is a
great place to give bartering a try.)
 Disability grants
 Life insurance policies

 Local seed-money funds (such as one sponsored by
the Amarillo Economic Development Center)
 Reduced tax withholdings
Turn Your Employer into Your
First Client
If you’re really good at what you do, what better way to
get your business off the ground than to do work for your
current employer on a contract basis? Not only will your
employer have the benefit of your expertise while con-
tracting with a known entity, but you can also develop
your business while working with people you already
know, using systems and procedures you’re already famil-
iar with.
Clearly separate yourself from your former employer as
an independent contractor instead of continuing to work
in the role of employee. If you don’t make this distinction
clear, the IRS may disallow any tax deductions you take
for your home-based business.

Steps to Take before 
Leaving Your Job
A
s soon as you’re consistently earning enough
income from a part-time business to cover your
bare-minimum living and business expenses, you’re ready
to make a full-time commitment to your business. Before
you turn in your resignation, however, take the five fol-
lowing steps:
 Check when any company benefit plans you have
will vest or increase in value. If you have a 401(k)
or other retirement plan to which your employer
has been contributing, it may not be fully available
to you until you’ve completed a particular number
of years of service. Checking this information may
help you determine the best time to resign. It’d truly
be a shame, for example, if you quit two weeks
before the value of your retirement benefits was set
to jump from 80 to 100 percent.
 Find out when you can expect to receive any
bonus money or profit sharing. You may, for exam-
ple, be slated to receive an annual performance
bonus or profit sharing a month after the end of the
company fiscal year. This information can help with
the financial planning for your business.

 Get all annual health exams and routine proce-
dures done, and fill all prescriptions, while you
and your family are still covered by your med-
ical/dental/vision insurance. Check to see whether
your group coverage can be converted to an individ-
ual policy at favorable rates (some can be, although
be very careful about changes in coverage, co-pays,
and deductibles that may actually end up costing
you much more money in the long run) or what
other health coverage options are open to you.
Don’t forget that if you work in the United States,
you’re likely covered by COBRA (the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985), which
requires your employer to allow you to continue
your current group health coverage for a period of
18 months or more at the same rate (probably subsi-
dized by the company) as all other employees of
comparable coverage.
 If you own a house, take out a home equity line of
credit before leaving your current job. Having a
line of credit to draw upon is invaluable during the
first two years of your new business, and your
chances of getting approved for it are much greater
while you’re employed in a regular job. That’s 
right — after you leave your job, you probably won’t
qualify for a line of credit or other loans for your
business until your business has been successful for
two or more years.
 Pay off or pay down the balance on your credit
cards while you still have a steady job. This helps
your credit rating (always a good thing) and pro-
vides you with another source of potential funds to
help you finance various startup costs (and depend-
ing on the nature of your business, you may have
plenty of those!).
Part II: Bumping Up Your Bring-Home 
80

Don’t make your announcement or submit your resigna-
tion until you’re really, actually, for sure ready to go.
Some companies are (sometimes justifiably) paranoid
about soon-to-be former employees’ stealing ideas, pro-
prietary data, or clients. This can make for a very hasty
exit, with a personal escort, when you do resign.

Take Tax Deductions on
Home-Based Businesses
H
ome-based businesses pay self-employment tax
(the government’s way of collecting payments for
Social Security and Medicare from the self-employed),
state and federal income taxes, excise and property
taxes, and miscellaneous local taxes or assessments.
With all these taxes, you can easily be turning over 30 to
50 percent or more of your business’s revenues to the
government. Fortunately, you can take a number of
deductions — some significant — for your home-based
business.
Home-Office Deduction
For many, the home-office deduction is a major financial
incentive to start businesses at home, and it can have a
significant and positive effect on a home-based business’s
financial position (as well as the personal financial situa-
tion of the owner). For many home-based business
owners, the ability to take the home-office deduction lit-
erally means the difference between success and failure.

The beauty of the home-office deduction is that it allows
you to deduct the costs of operating and maintaining the
part of your home that you use for business. And it doesn’t
matter what kind of home you live in. Whether you live in
a single-family home, a condominium, a commercial
building, or even a houseboat, if you meet the IRS’s crite-
ria for the home-office deduction, you’re eligible to take
it.
With a home-office deduction, you’re allowed to deduct
not only your normal business expenses (paper, pencils,
phone calls, and so on), but also a portion of the indirect
expenses related to your entire home! Examples of
common indirect expenses are rent or mortgage, security
system, housekeeping, and utilities.
To determine the total amount of indirect expenses you
can deduct, calculate the percentage of your home
devoted to your home office. If your home office takes up
20 percent of your homes space, you can deduct 20 per-
cent of your home’s indirect expenses.
Consult with an accountant, tax planner, or other tax pro-
fessional before you take the home-office deduction. The
rules are complicated, and the penalties for doing the
wrong thing can be significant. For more information on
deductions for your home-based business, check out IRS
Publication 587: Business Use of Your Home (to locate this
publication, enter “IRS Publication 587” in your search
engine or go to www.irs.gov/formspubs).
Other Important Tax Deductions
Aside from the home-office tax deduction, home-based
businesses are allowed to deduct a variety of other 
Take Tax Deductions on Home-Based Businesses 83

business expenses. As you may imagine, a home-based
business owner can legally deduct lots of different things
from his or her taxes. Examples of legal deductions
include postage, auto expenses, Internet access, business
meals and entertainment, retirement plans, interest pay-
ments on business credit cards, health insurance, and
office supplies and furniture.
To be deductible, the Internal Revenue Code specifies
that expenses must be ordinary and necessary for the
operation of your business. So although the purchase of a
vintage 1959 sunburst Gibson Les Paul electric guitar for
$150,000 may be ordinary and necessary (and thus an
allowable deduction) for a professional musician, it likely
wouldn’t fly for a home-based software designer — in
fact, it’d surely sink like a lead balloon.

Ensure the Survival of Your
Home-Based Business in
Tough Times
D
ue to your business’s inherent smallness, you may
not have enough clients to manage the financial
roller coaster that can result when a customer goes bank-
rupt, puts you on a slow-pay plan, or switches vendors.
Good planning can help you see far enough out on the hori-
zon to anticipate the most serious financial shortfalls —
and then take steps to avoid them — but anticipating all
the bumps in the road and missing them when they
arrive is impossible to do. Use the tips here to help you
weather the storm and emerge stronger than ever:
 Save for a rainy day.
 Manage your cash flow.
 Keep in touch with your customers.

 Push your clients to pay their bills. You can figure
which accounts are running behind by monitoring
receivables — the money owed to your company by
your clients and customers. QuickBooks and other
business accounting programs have built-in receiv-
ables aging reports that make the task easy. And
when you discover that one of your client’s pay-
ments is overdue, act immediately — especially
when the amount owed is substantial.
 Minimize expenses.
Be careful about exactly which expenses you cut. Do
not cut expenses that’ll bring more money into your
business; instead, you may need to increase them.
 Offer a special promotion.
 Subcontract for others.

Choose between Itemized and
Standard Deductions
T
oo many people overpay on taxes because they take
the standard deductions when itemizing would be
better, or they itemize their deductions when the stan-
dard deductions would’ve been more advantageous. How
do you choose which route to take? The answer is easy:
Itemize your deductions if your total deductions are more
than the standard deduction. For each dollar that
exceeds the standard deduction, you’ll reduce your tax-
able income by that amount. Otherwise, take the stan-
dard deduction.
Note: If you’re 65 or older and/or blind, your standard
deduction will be even higher than what you see here:
Filing Status
Standard Deduction
Individual taxpayer
$5,450
Married filing jointly
$10,900
Head of household
$8,000

Itemized deductions are limited or phased out if your
adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds a certain amount.
For this reason, the value of your itemized deductions
may not be as great as they appear if you fall into this 
category.
To determine whether the sum of your itemized deduc-
tions will exceed the standard deduction that you’re enti-
tled to take, add up all your anticipated itemized
deductions and subtract this number from the standard
deduction. If the net result is a positive number, itemize
your deductions; if the net result is negative, take the
standard deduction.
Part II: Bumping Up Your Bring-Home 
88
Figuring out AGI
Your AGI is your adjusted gross income, a number you need to know if
you’re planning on pursuing deductions. The quickest way for you to
determine your AGI is to refer to your last tax return. You can find your
AGI for the previous year on the first page of your 1040 return on line 37.
If your income and deductible expenses aren’t expected to change much
this year as compared to last year, use last year’s AGI for your planning
purposes.

Boost Your Household Income
W
hen you can’t make ends meet with expense cuts
alone, start looking at the other end of the cash
flow equation: income. You, your partner, and any chil-
dren you have may be able to generate enough additional
income to soften the money woes that come with a dicey
economy.
The following sections explain two ways to increase the
household income — taking on another job yourself and
putting other family members to work.
Make the Most of Moonlighting
Assuming your current agreement with your employer
doesn’t rule it out as an option, moonlighting (that is,
holding a second regular job in addition to your main
job) can be an excellent source for the extra cash you
need. If you don’t have a marketable skill, you can still
earn some extra money by taking on a second job at a
local restaurant or store. Do it regularly enough and you
have a steady additional flow of income.

Don’t plan on the extra money unless you always get the
extra work or are very confident that you’ll be able to
hustle up side jobs. Develop a plan that doesn’t take into
account the sporadic moonlighting money, but use that
money to help you reach your goals earlier than the plan
calls for.
If you have young children, you may need to draw up a
work schedule that consists of one partner working days
and the other going to work when the first comes home
in the evening. Depending on your family’s goals, this can
be a temporary arrangement until the family gets back on
its feet.
Put Other Family 
Members to Work
During World War II, when manpower was short in the
United States, women made up a significant segment of
the workforce. When the United States was at war, every-
one pulled together and contributed to keep the country
running and our military overseas well equipped.
When your family is facing a financial crisis, everybody of
working age can pull together and contribute his or her
fair share to get the family back on its feet. If you have
young children whom you’re trying to shield from the
problem, that’s fine, but older teenagers are certainly
capable of earning their own spending money and
enough to cover their cellphone bills. Simply explain
what’s going on, ask them to assist you and be part of the
solution, and share your plan with them. The experience
can be valuable if they ever face a similar situation.

90

If an older child is extremely reluctant or refuses to help,
tough love may be the order of the day. Older kids need
to pay their fair share. Obviously, I’m not talking about
asking your 15-year-old son to get a job bagging groceries
and turn over his whole $87 paycheck each week, but you
may ask your 17-year-old daughter to help offset the addi-
tional cost of auto insurance with a portion of her weekly
check. Adult children should be working and contributing
something toward the house payment, maintenance, and
utilities; otherwise, perhaps they can find more affordable
accommodations elsewhere.

You’ve worked hard to get where you are,
and the fear of losing ground during dicey
economic times can make you feel that not only
is your current situation in jeopardy, but so are
the things you’ve planned for your future: your
retirement, your own or your kids’ college educa-
tion, and so on.
The good news is that you don’t have to give up
your future security or dreams; you just have to
be smart about how you continue to pursue them.
The bad news? There isn’t any. Being proactive is

Avoid Unnecessary Fees
H
aving a check returned for insufficient funds and
being charged the penalties will certainly get your
attention, but even smaller fees can take their toll on
your finances. To avoid getting dinged for unnecessary
fees, follow this advice:
 Keep your checking account in the black to avoid
overdraft charges. When you write a check that
bounces, you generally have to pay your bank’s over-
draft fee and a fee to the business you wrote the
check to. If the overdraft results in a late payment,
you have to pony up for the late payment fee, too.
Things only get worse if the late payment is to a credit
card company that ups the interest rate you pay.
 Don’t use your debit cards when doing so results
in a fee. If you use your debit card at a bank that’s
not your own, you may end up paying a service fee
to access your own money. Some banks and credit
unions add a charge when you use your debit card
as a debit card (the transaction requires that you
enter your PIN) rather than as a credit card or if you
use it more than a certain number of times. These
fees are easy to avoid: Go to your own bank.

 Avoid cash advances with your credit card. Many
credit card companies charge a higher percentage of
interest for cash advances than they do for other
transactions. And because the card company gets to
decide which balance it applies your payment to, it
pays for the lower-interest transactions first, leaving
the higher interest charges on the card longer.

Shop Around for Insurance
W
hen you’re buying any kind of insurance, do your
initial research and comparison shopping online
to become better informed about competitive rates for
various policies. Then contact at least three sources and
allow each company to provide you with quotes on a few
different policies that may be best for your situation. As
you question each company, be sure to consider the 
following:
 How much insurance you need
 How much you can afford to pay in premiums
 Special features or benefits, such as a waiver of pre-
mium, increasing death benefits, long-term care ben-
efits, and so on
The three primary ways to obtain insurance quotes and
products are through the following:
 A captive agent represents only one company, such
as Allstate, State Farm, or American Family. It may
seem that a captive agent isn’t the best way to go;
however, captive agents can be extremely competi-
tive and provide exceptional customer service,
especially for home and auto coverage. Yet these
types of companies often aren’t the most competi-
tive in the areas of life, health, disability, and long-
term care insurance.

 An independent agent represents multiple insurers.
Independent agents can do a lot of comparison
shopping for you and may be able to provide you
with one-stop shopping for all your insurance needs.
You still need to shop around, though. The differ-
ence in offerings can be huge even among independ-
ent agents.
 Buying directly from the insurance company is
another option. Buying insurance directly from the
company, without an agent, can usually result in sav-
ings of 10 to 15 percent. Don’t count on any person-
alized attention, but you may save some money.
However, think long and hard before you buy certain
types of insurance, such as long-term care, disabil-
ity, or medical insurance, without the guidance of an
insurance professional, because these policies are
often complex and require the guidance an insur-
ance professional can provide.

Raise Your Deductible to 
Save on Insurance
G
iven all the insurance coverage you need — health,
homeowner’s, life, auto — insurance costs can take
a large bite out of your bank account. Fortunately, you
can reduce the amount you pay for insurance without
jeopardizing protection. This tip applies to all insurance
plans.
To some people, a lower deductible (the amount you have
to pay before insurance starts paying the bills) means
you “get something” from an insurance plan. Others point
out that plans with higher deductibles are cheaper. In
general, high-deductible plans are much less expensive
than low-deductible plans. If you can raise and set aside
the money you’d need to make your deductible, you can
save on your insurance premiums.
Insurance is intended to cover risks you can’t afford to
bear on your own. The higher the deductible, the lower
the premium. By raising your deductibles to $1,000 from
$250, you may be able to reduce your premium by as
much as 25 to 30 percent. Just make sure you don’t raise
your deductible so high that you can’t pay that amount in
case of an emergency.

#32
Save Money on Life Insurance
B
uying your life insurance in pieces is a lot more
expensive than covering all your needs in one
policy. Plus, buying in pieces leaves you vulnerable to a
gap in your coverage. Examples of piecemeal buying are
having mortgage insurance through your lending institu-
tion, credit card insurance through your credit card com-
pany, credit life insurance with your car loan, supplemental
group life insurance at work, flight insurance at the air-
port, and so on. When buying life insurance, figure out
how much insurance you need to do the whole job and
buy one policy.
In addition, don’t buy policies you don’t need or that
don’t offer adequate protection. Case in point: accidental
death or travel accident insurance. With both accidental
death and travel accident policies, you have no coverage
for death from natural causes. Buying these policies is an
especially bad move if you buy them in lieu of the full life
insurance you really need. When buying life insurance,
buy only coverage that pays for any death — natural or
accidental.
Finally, buy life insurance when you need it, not before.
Many single people have expensive cash value life insur-
ance years before anyone in their life would suffer

financially from their death. You wouldn’t buy car insur-
ance if you didn’t own a car, so don’t buy life insurance
unless someone depends on you financially.
Some people fall into this trap, thinking they’re saving
money because life insurance is cheaper when you’re
young. This myth started because the annual cost of life
insurance is cheaper per year when you’re young because
your chances of dying are lower. But the total cost that
you pay over the life of the policy isn’t cheaper. Suppose
you buy life insurance for $100 a year at age 25 and your
friend waits until age 35 and has to pay $110 a year for
the same coverage. Now you’re both 35 and you pay $10
less per year — but how about the $1,000 that you paid
for the ten years that you didn’t need it? Plus interest?
Don’t buy life insurance until you need it.

Qualify for Homeowner 
Policy Discounts
I
f you want to qualify for a discount on your home-
owner’s policy, here’s a list of things you can do to
reduce risk, to reduce the chances of having a claim at
all, and to reduce the severity of any claim you do have.
You can also save on your insurance premiums by put-
ting some of these tips into effect.
 Install a UL-approved smoke detector on each floor.
Replace the batteries yearly. Also install a carbon
monoxide detector.
 Install a UL-approved dry-chemical fire extinguisher
in the kitchen for grease fires. Check it periodically
to make sure it’s fully charged.
 Have your fireplace, flues, and chimney cleaned reg-
ularly to prevent chimney fires (and all the horrible
interior smoke damage that results).
 Install a central burglar-and-fire alarm (the premium
savings are huge for this one — 10 to 20 percent).
 Install deadbolt locks on all access doors.
 Install a motion detector alarm.

 Install a sump pump system to prevent damage from
groundwater, which is excluded by virtually every
homeowner’s policy. (Be sure to buy optional sump
pump failure coverage.)
 If you have a swimming pool, have an approved
fence. Take out the diving board (where most
injuries occur). Add a locking pool cover to prevent
unauthorized use.
 To avoid all the potential liability for injuries to the
neighbor kids, buy your kids a membership to a
health club offering a supervised trampoline instead
of buying a trampoline yourself.
If you’ve already taken some of the steps that translate to
a discount, make sure they’re reflected on your policy.
And ask your insurance agent whether any other dis-
counts are available to which you may be entitled.

Take Advantage of Coverage
You Already Have
A great way to save on your homeowner’s policy is to
take advantage of the coverage you already have and
avoid unnecessary coverage:
 Trailers: If you own an expensive camping-trailer,
you can insure it best and most economically by
adding the trailer to your car insurance policy.
Because car insurance covers only the trailer, add
Special Perils contents coverage to your home-
owner’s policy to get better coverage for the belong-
ings in your trailer in case of damage from a
collision or overturn.
 Instrument rentals: Parents commonly rent instru-
ments instead of buying them, especially for the
child’s first instrument. The rental agency requires
you to insure the rental and offers you insurance on
the $800 guitar you’re renting — typically $4 to $8 a
month added to your rental fee. That’s $48 to $96 a
year. You can schedule the $800 guitar under your
homeowner’s policy for $4 to $8 a year! That’s the
way to go — always. Be sure to include the rental
agency as Loss Payee on the schedule so its interest
is properly covered.

 Valuables: If you have any kind of property that’s
quite valuable and could be stolen, like jewelry or
fine paintings, install a central burglar-and-fire
alarm. Installation costs are often $200 or less. The
monthly cost to monitor the alarm is about $20. You
reduce the risk of losing an irreplaceable treasure,
and you receive 10 to 20 percent off your home-
owner’s rates.

Look for Discounts and
Premium Credits from Your
Car Insurance
T
he following are key factors that car insurers use to
determine the price of your auto insurance and tips
on what you can do to keep it as low as possible:
 Age: If you’re very young or quite elderly, your risk
of being in an auto accident is statistically much
higher than for middle-aged folks. You can’t do any-
thing about your age. However, some insurers may
penalize you less than others with regard to your
cost of insurance.
 Auto insurance claims history: Safe drivers are
rewarded with lower auto insurance premiums. Your
history of making claims against your auto policy
directly affects the cost of your insurance. The more
you use insurance, the more your insurance costs.
 Commuting distance to work: The farther you
drive, the higher your risk of being in an accident.

 Credit history: Insurance companies have deter-
mined that there’s a direct correlation between your
credit history and your risk as a driver.
 Driving record: If you receive a traffic ticket for
speeding or another form of reckless driving, you
pay for that carelessness in higher insurance 
premiums.
 Marital status: Married people historically are more
stable drivers.
 Place of residence: Your zip code can have a drastic
effect on your cost of insurance. Certain zip codes
have a history of more auto theft, vandalism, and so
on, and the insurance companies are still allowed to
penalize you for living in these zip codes.
 Type of car you drive: A Dodge Dart station wagon
versus a Hummer or a Corvette? The latter two
require substantially higher auto insurance premi-
ums because those cars cause or potentially receive
much more damage in the same accident as the sta-
tion wagon, and they cost a lot more to repair or
replace than the older, less expensive vehicle. Also,
drivers of sports cars statistically drive more care-
lessly than drivers of sedans.
 Grades your child gets: Most insurance companies
give a 10- to 25-percent discount for a B average or
better and another 30- to 40-percent discount if the
student is attending college more than 100 miles
from home and has no car at school. Ask for the
Good Student and Distant Student discounts.
 Other conditions: Other things can reduce your
insurance costs:
• Having your home, auto, and liability insur-
ance policies with the same company
Look for Discounts and Premium Credits from Your Car Insurance 107

• Having safety devices, such as airbags,
antilock brakes, or an alarm system
• Not letting other people drive your vehicle
(multiple drivers create multiple risks)
• Taking a driver safety course; many compa-
nies provide a discount to drivers who have
taken a safe driving course
• Practicing defensive-driving techniques and
wearing your safety belt
• Paying your auto insurance premium annually;
most companies charge a service fee if you
pay your premiums monthly, quarterly, and
sometimes semiannually

Save on Medical Coverage
Offered by Your Car Insurance
C
ar insurance companies generally offer coverage for
your medical bills. This medical coverage depends
on your state’s laws and generally comes in two flavors:
Medical Payments (Med Pay) coverage and Personal
Injury Protection (PIP) coverage.
The two forms of coverage are similar; they both pay
your medical bills resulting from a car accident, regard-
less of fault, up to the limit you purchased. PIP has the
added advantage (at a considerably greater cost) of also
reimbursing you for some of your lost wages or replace-
ment services (if you have to hire help around the home).
Keep in mind three things when buying either coverage:
 State laws on Med Pay or PIP coverage vary dramati-
cally. Check the law in your particular state.
 Buy only as much medical-related coverage as the
law requires. You can save money on your insurance
by buying no more than minimum coverage for either
Med Pay or PIP. Medical and disability costs should
be covered under other policies you have, so having
additional car insurance coverage is unnecessary.

 Avoid buying additional insurance that covers your
medical bills only when they’re the result of car acci-
dents. First, these expenses should be covered by
other policies. Second, if you use this type of policy
in lieu of a medical or disability policy, you’re leav-
ing yourself unprepared for medical expenses that
are the result of other kinds of problems.

Continue Health Coverage
When You Leave Your Job
I
f you leave your job for any reason, you can lose your
group health insurance. But almost all employers are
required by law to allow terminated employees to con-
tinue group insurance coverage through COBRA (the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act). Even
though you must pay 100 percent of the cost of the insur-
ance, this is your best option. If COBRA isn’t an option for
you, or if you’re close to exhausting it (generally after 18
months), don’t go without health insurance. Consider
these options:
 Individual health insurance: If you’re relatively
healthy, consider an individual health insurance
policy. To find a health insurance broker in your
area, visit the National Association of Health
Underwriters (www.nahu.org/consumer/find
agent.cfm).
 HIPAA: The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act requires states to provide mini-
mal coverage after you exhaust COBRA benefits, as
long as you haven’t had an extended break in cover-
age, which varies by state. Be aware that premiums

under HIPAA may be two to three times the standard
rate policy. Each state has its own HIPAA rules; to
find out the rules in your state, contact your state
insurance department.
 Your state’s high-risk health insurance pool: If
you’re medically uninsurable due to significant
health problems, apply for coverage through your
state’s high-risk pool (if it has one). To find out
whether your state has such a pool and how it
works, contact the National Association of State
Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans
(www.naschip.org).
 Medicaid: Medicaid is a federal program that pro-
vides healthcare services to the poor. Medicaid’s 
eligibility requirements and benefits vary by state.
Go to www.nahu.org/consumer/healthcare/
topic.cfm?catID=18 for more info.
 Local assistance programs: If you’re in a financial
crisis, look into assistance programs that provide
medical care at no or nominal cost. A small monthly
fee pays for medical care at designated facilities for
all family members.
 State Children’s Health Insurance Program: SCHIP
provides healthcare coverage to children whose
families make too much money to qualify for
Medicaid. Find out more at www.nahu.org/
consumer/healthcare/topic.cfm?catID=19.
 Federally funded community health centers: These
centers provide healthcare assistance to the needy.

Cap Your Out-of-Pocket 
Health Expenses
M
ost health insurance plans contain some kind of
co-payment on your part. Perhaps you have a co-
pay per visit, such as $15 for each office visit or $40 if you
go to the emergency room. Perhaps you have a
deductible of $500 a year before your coverage kicks in
(meaning that you pay the first $500 of your medical
expenses each year). Or perhaps your policy pays 80 per-
cent of all covered medical bills, with you responsible for
the other 20 percent.
Paying the per-visit co-pays or the deductible usually
isn’t a hardship. But paying 20 percent of all your major
medical bills in one year, without any limit on the possi-
ble amount of your contribution, easily can be.
When buying health insurance that contains a percentage
co-payment, make sure the policy includes an annual
maximum that’s reasonable for your out-of-pocket
expenses. For example, a 20-percent co-pay on the first
$5,000 in expenses you have for the year is a $1,000 cap
— with the insurer paying 100 percent of the bills the rest
of the year.

If you have group coverage from your employer that has
no cap on the 20-percent co-payment, you have a couple
of options. If you work for a large employer, you often
have more than one plan to choose from. See whether
another plan has a cap. Otherwise, buy a personal Excess
Major Medical policy with a large deductible. This policy
typically pays 80 percent of your 20-percent co-payment
responsibility.

Save on Individual Health
Coverage
T
he best way to save money on your health insurance
premium is not to smoke or use tobacco. Unlike
group policies, almost all individual policies differentiate
smokers from nonsmokers because the claims costs for
smokers are much higher. Blue Cross of Minnesota, for
example, cuts 30 to 40 percent off its standard rates if
you haven’t used tobacco for three years.
You can also save on individual coverage by cutting out
unneeded coverage, cutting back doctor choice, or rais-
ing deductibles.
When deciding between two deductibles on a health
policy, choose the lower deductible if you’re in doubt. You
can raise your deductible later, anytime you want to. But
to lower it, the whole family must qualify medically — not
likely if you’ve just incurred some big medical bills.

116

Use Medical Savings
Accounts
I
n 1997, Congress created a pilot program called
Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) and made the
accounts available to self-employed individuals and their
families. An MSA operates like an individual retirement
account (IRA) coordinated with a high-deductible major
medical health insurance plan. Here are its features:
 Like an IRA, contributions are income tax
deductible.
 Earnings on the account are tax sheltered.
 The maximum contribution per year is 65 percent of
your major medical plan deductible for individuals
and 75 percent for families. The insurance plan must
meet MSA standards.
 From the account, you can pay your deductibles and
most other medical expenses not covered by your
health plan. Because the MSA money has never 
been taxed, you’re paying those bills with pretax
dollars — a huge advantage.

 If you’ve stayed reasonably healthy, you can leave
unused funds on deposit and either use them in
future years or save them as supplemental retire-
ment dollars. If you don’t use them for medical bills,
withdrawals are taxed much like traditional IRAs
when you do retire.
If you have interest in an MSA, check first with your agent
or state insurance department. MSAs aren’t approved in
all states. You can set up an MSA wherever you can estab-
lish an IRA — banks, savings and loans, investment
houses, insurance companies, and so on.

Tap into Temporary 
Health Insurance
M
any states allow health insurance companies to
offer the public short-term or temporary health cov-
erage to meet short-term needs, such as covering a
person who’s between jobs or a college student who isn’t
covered by student health insurance during the summer.
Coverage is usually available in increments of 30, 60, 90,
120, and sometimes 180 days. Coverage is usually quite
good in many respects. Typically, temporary policies
have a coverage limit of $1 million or more. They usually
include freedom-of-choice and a maximum amount on
out-of-pocket expenses.
The biggest advantage to a temporary policy is that you
can qualify with almost no medical questions. Coverage
can be immediate, if needed. But temporary coverage has
at least five disadvantages:
 Preexisting conditions aren’t covered. If you’ve ever
been treated for a condition in the past, you won’t
be covered if the condition flares up again.
 The insurance usually isn’t renewable.

 When the coverage period you’ve chosen ends, so
does the coverage — often, even if you’re lying seri-
ously ill in the hospital.
 Claim payments are often delayed.
 Coverage outside the country is often excluded.
Because of major limitations, you generally want to avoid
buying temporary insurance unless you have no other
option. If you’re between jobs, continue your group cov-
erage from your prior employer under COBRA if you can.
And for summer coverage, keep college students continu-
ously insured under your family plan.

Know the Tax Benefits 
of a 401(k) Plan
W
hen you sign up for a 401(k) plan, you agree to let
your employer deposit some of your paycheck
into the plan as a pre-tax contribution instead of paying it
to you. Your employer may even throw in some extra
money known as a matching contribution. You don’t pay
federal income tax on any of this money until you with-
draw it.
How much your 401(k) will be worth when you retire
depends on a number of factors, such as which invest-
ments you choose, the return you get on those invest-
ments, whether your employer makes a contribution, and
whether you withdraw money early.
A 401(k) lets you pay less income tax in the following two
ways:
 It lowers your taxable income. The money you con-
tribute to a 401(k) reduces your gross income, or tax-
able income (your pay before tax and any other
deductions). When you have lower taxable income,
you pay less federal income tax, and in most states,
less in state and local income or wage taxes.

 It enables you to defer taxes. The gains in your
401(k) aren’t taxed annually, as they would be in a
regular taxable bank savings account, a personal
mutual fund account, or a brokerage account (which
you may use to buy and sell stocks and other invest-
ments). With a 401(k), you defer paying taxes on
your investment earnings until you withdraw the
money.

Continue to Invest, Even at a
Reduced Amount
I
f money is tight, you may be tempted to stop con-
tributing to your 401(k) (or any retirement) plan to
bump up your bring-home pay. But you lose not only tax
savings but also the benefits of the compounding.
The following example shows how you can cheat yourself
by waiting just a few years to start saving or by stopping
your contributions. Ken, Rasheed, and Lisa all earn
$25,000 a year. They all decide to contribute 5 percent of
their salary, or $1,250, to their 401(k) plans, but over dif-
ferent periods of time. Assuming that each has an aver-
age annual return (how much the money increases in
value when it’s invested) of 8 percent, look at the surpris-
ing results shown in the following chart.

You can see that it pays to start saving early and to keep
saving. In this example, each person is saving a little
more than $100 per month. If that seems like too much
for you now, consider contributing a smaller amount.
Sometimes that’s the best way to get started or to keep
going.
If you absolutely must scale back your 401(k) contribu-
tions due to financial hardship, factor in whether your
employer matches your contribution. If it does, lower
your contribution only as far as your employer matches;
otherwise, you’re doing yourself a double disservice.

Borrow from Your 401(k)
You can borrow from your 401(k) only if your plan
document allows you to borrow for the specific
reason you have in mind. Some plans permit borrowing
for any reason, but most permit loans only for the rea-
sons included on the hardship withdrawal list. Get details
about account loans from your summary plan descrip-
tion, your benefits office, or 401(k) plan provider.
Figure Out How Much 
You Can Borrow
The government sets the limits on how much you can
borrow. Generally, you’re allowed to borrow no more
than 50 percent of your account value up to $50,000 maxi-
mum. The other half stays in the account as collateral.
However, government rules theoretically permit borrow-
ing 100 percent of an account up to $10,000. So if your
account value is $15,000, you may be able to borrow
$10,000, even though 50 percent of $15,000 is only $7,500.
Most plans don’t allow this; they limit all loans to 50 per-
cent of the account value for the sake of simplicity. Some
plans also impose a minimum loan amount because
administering a loan for only a few bucks isn’t worth the
hassle.

Determine How Much 
Interest You’ll Pay
The interest you pay on your 401(k) loan is determined
by your employer and must be a level that meets IRS
requirements. It’s usually the prime rate (the interest rate
banks charge the most creditworthy companies) plus 1
or 2 percentage points. In most plans, the interest you
pay goes back into your account, so you’re in the inter-
esting position of being both the borrower and the
lender.
Repayment Rules
You normally have to repay the loan within five years, but
you can repay it faster if your plan permits. Your
employer may permit a longer repayment period if you
use the money for a home purchase.
Employers usually require you to repay a loan through
deductions from your paycheck. The loan repayments are
taken out of your paycheck after taxes, not pre-tax like
your original contributions. Then, when you eventually
withdraw this money in retirement, you pay tax on it
again. This point bears repeating: You pay tax twice on
money used to repay a 401(k) loan.
Most employers require you to pay back the loan with
payroll deductions, so if you’re laid off or you quit your
job, continuing to repay the loan becomes impossible.
You can either repay the entire outstanding loan balance
right away or take the amount as a taxable distribution
(payment from the account).
Borrow from Your 401(k) 125

If you don’t have the money to repay the loan, you have
to declare the entire unpaid loan balance as income on
your tax return. Adding insult to injury, if you’re younger
than 55 when you leave your job, you’ll probably have to
pay an early withdrawal penalty of 10 percent or more.
If you take a loan, continue to make pre-tax contributions
to your 401(k) while repaying the loan. If you don’t, your
eventual account balance will be lower than if you hadn’t
taken the loan. Say you’re contributing $1,800 a year pre-
tax to your 401(k) and you receive an employer matching
contribution of $900. If you stop contributing for five
years (the loan repayment period), you lose out on $9,000
of your own contributions ($1,800 × 5) and $4,500 in
employer matching contributions ($900 × 5). If you invest
those amounts in the 401(k) plan over 30 years, with an
average return of 9 percent, they grow to $139,340.

Let Your 401(k) Roll Over to
Avoid Taxes
W
hen you leave your job, one of the many forms
that you’ll likely have to fill out is a 401(k) distribu-
tion election form. (Distribution is employee-benefit-speak
for the payment of your vested 401(k) money to you.)
The most sensible thing to do with your 401(k) from a
tax-management point of view is a direct rollover (also
known as a trustee-to-trustee transfer) of the money. With
this type of rollover, the money goes directly from your
401(k) plan into another tax-deferred account — an indi-
vidual retirement account (IRA) or your new employer’s
plan. By doing a direct rollover, you don’t have to pay 
any tax on the money when it comes out of your old
employer’s 401(k). The money also continues to grow
tax-deferred in the new account.
Roll Over into an IRA
You can roll money from your 401(k) into a traditional
IRA. When rolling over into an IRA, you can do a partial
rollover, rolling over only part of your 401(k) while leav-
ing the rest in your 401(k) account or cashing it out. For
example, you may not want to roll over employer stock if

you receive shares as part of your distribution. Or you
may withdraw some of your 401(k) money right away to
pay for an expense but roll the remainder into an IRA to
keep it working for your retirement.
If you already have a traditional IRA, you can roll your
401(k) money into that account. However, it’s probably a
better idea to open a separate IRA just for your rollover
money. This makes keeping track of the funds easier. This
type of account is often referred to as a conduit IRA
because it can act as a conduit between your old 401(k)
and a new employer’s plan or a rollover IRA.
You can’t roll your 401(k) directly into a Roth IRA. (This is
because a Roth IRA is treated differently for tax pur-
poses.) What you may be able to do, however, if you
really want a Roth, is convert your traditional IRA into a
Roth after doing the rollover. You can do a partial conver-
sion of a traditional IRA into a Roth — leaving some of the
traditional IRA intact. Because you pay income tax on the
converted amount, reducing the amount you convert
lowers the tax you pay for the conversion.
Roll Over into Another 
Employer’s Plan
You may be able to roll the money over into your new
employer’s plan. You may decide to do this for a number
of reasons, including
Part III: Putting Your Personal Finances on Firm Footing 
128

 Your new employer has a terrific plan with great
funds and low expenses.
 You want to consolidate all your retirement savings
in one place for ease of management.
 You think you may want to take a loan someday
(you can’t take a loan from an IRA).
Your new plan may require you to wait until you’re eligi-
ble to participate before accepting a rollover from your
old 401(k). If, for example, your new employer has a wait-
ing period of one year before you can contribute to the
401(k), you have to wait one year to roll the money into
the 401(k). In that case, you can either leave your money
in your former employer’s plan or move it to a conduit
IRA, ready to be transferred into the new 401(k) when the
time comes.

Investigate Tax-Deferred
Ways to Save for College
S
aving money is a good thing, even when financial
times are tough. Uncle Sam is prepared to back up
that philosophy with a variety of savings programs that
contain built-in tax incentives.
Section 529 Plans
Qualified tuition programs covered under Section 529 of
the Internal Revenue Code allow you to save money or
purchase tuition credits for future college expenses for a
specific beneficiary. Your money goes into an account
that’s administered either by the state (yours or any
other — some states allow residents of other states to
participate in their plans) or by a specific college or uni-
versity. You may see them called either Section 529 plans
or qualified tuition programs — they’re one and the same.
These savings plans can be a fantastic way to save for
future educational expenses. To make a plan work,
though, you have to understand its requirements and
follow them.

When you make a contribution to a Section 529 plan,
you’re not allowed any federal income tax deduction for
the amount of your contribution (unlike many sorts of
retirement plans, which defer income tax not only on the
accrued earnings in the account but also on your contri-
butions). Depending on which state you live in (and if you
use its plan), you may get a current state income tax
deduction for part or all of your contribution each year.
After your money is safely tied up in a Section 529 plan,
interest that you earn on it isn’t taxed until distributions
are made to your designated beneficiary. And if you use
these distributions to pay the qualified education
expenses of a student at an eligible educational institu-
tion, accrued earnings generally aren’t taxed at all. In
other words, a Section 529 plan allows you to save for
college, and it exempts or defers income tax on the
accrued earnings until the designated beneficiary begins
taking distributions from the plan.
To get these tax benefits, the expenses must be used for
qualified expenses (tuition, room and board, books, and
so on) at qualified institutions, such as postsecondary
schools eligible to participate in U.S. Department of
Education financial aid programs, many vocational and
technical schools, community colleges, and so on.
Coverdell Accounts
Coverdell education savings accounts (ESAs) also enable
you to save now for future educational expenses —
whether primary, secondary, or postsecondary — of a
designated beneficiary. You can invest money in
Coverdell accounts in a variety of ways: stocks, bonds,
money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and so
Investigate Tax-Deferred Ways to Save for College 131

on, although you may not invest in life insurance policies.
Under the Coverdell rules (and unlike Section 529 rules),
if you designate yourself the one responsible for all deci-
sions on this particular account, you keep control of the
money and make all the investment decisions for your
child’s account. Over the years, the investments will
hopefully earn significant income through interest, divi-
dends, and capital gains, until the time the account is
closed.
You pay no income tax on the income when it’s earned,
and as distributions are made from these accounts to
your designated beneficiary for qualified educational
expenses, the income portion of the distribution isn’t
taxed, either to you or to your student.

Squeeze Out Every Drop of
Available College Money
A
fter you begin to suspect that your savings and
amounts available from current earnings will fall
short of your child’s anticipated educational costs, some
planning may well increase the amount of outright grants
and very low-cost loans your student may qualify for.
Time the Receipt of Taxable and
Tax-Exempt Income
Do your best to schedule large infusions of income and
cash two years or more before your child is due to start
college; the financial aid folks won’t care about what’s on
your income tax return in any years other than your base
years (the calendar years used to determine how much
financial aid you receive). So if you need to sell an invest-
ment, do it sooner rather than later. If you’re going to
receive a year-end bonus, try to defer it to a non-base
year if possible. You want to avoid large amounts of extra
income in your base years.

Pay Down Debt
The folks who process your FAFSA (Free Application for
Federal Student Aid; see www.fafsa.ed.gov) are con-
cerned with how much you have in income and assets,
not how much you owe, which means you don’t even get
any credit for your debts. So to minimize the value of
assets you show on your aid application, get rid of your
debt. Sell some assets, if necessary, to pay off your car
loan, make extra mortgage payments, and bring your
credit card balances to zero. Complete all these transac-
tions before you fill in your aid applications; the FAFSA
folks are concerned only with the value of your assets on
the day that you complete the application — not the day
before and not the day after. Your good intentions will be
worth less than nothing if you raise the cash but fail to
pay off your debt before filing your application.
Get Assets Out of Your 
Child’s Name
The financial aid people include at most 5.6 percent of
parents’ includable assets in their calculation of expected
family contribution (EFC), the amount that the U.S.
Department of Education figures you should be able to
cough up for one child’s educational costs in any given
year. They expect your child to kick in a whopping 35 per-
cent of her assets as part of the same EFC for one year.
If you want to minimize the amount of your EFC, keep
assets in your name alone, joint with your spouse, or in
the name of another relative outside the household. If
your child has accumulated assets since birth — for
Part III: Putting Your Personal Finances on Firm Footing 
134

example, in a Coverdell ESA (see Tip #46, “Investigate
Tax-Deferred Ways to Save for College,” for more on
Coverdell accounts) — spend down these assets first.
Anticipate Your Expenses
Most people have large expenses they tend to postpone,
such as replacing a car or a roof, when facing the first 
college tuition bill. But while a certain amount of self-
deprivation is normal for parents, indulging yourself a
little may actually help your student’s overall financial
aid picture. Replace that old rust bucket that’s been held
together with duct tape for the last three years (but
remember, pay cash — don’t finance it unless you
absolutely must), and repair the roof. Paying for these
items depletes your cash and asset balances, which you
must, of course, report accurately on the FAFSA. Because
the value of the new car and the house repairs isn’t
included on your aid application, you can successfully
convert reportable assets into nonreportable assets and
also take care of some necessary expenses in the
process.
Spread Your Available Assets
across Multiple Students
You may be surprised to find out that although each of
your children has to file his or her own FAFSA applica-
tion, your EFC isn’t the same for each student. The por-
tion of the EFC that’s calculated based on your income is
divided by the number of students you currently have in
college. The student’s portion (based on his income and
assets) is then added on each application, arriving at the
Squeeze Out Every Drop of Available College Money 135

EFC for each student. The more members of your family
who are attending a postsecondary school at any given
time, the greater the potential financial aid award for
each student. Although the total that you’ll be expected
to pay will likely be greater for multiple students than it
would be if you just had one in school, the per-student
cost should be less (unless your income and/or asset
value is very large).

imately 83 billion dollars this year to help students
and their families afford the steep costs of university, col-
lege, and trade school. This whopping amount represents
roughly 60 percent of all student aid disbursed, so it’s an
obvious place to start looking for free money. To access
these monies, you need to fill out the FAFSA (Free
Application for Federal Student Aid).
Federal Pell Grants
Pell grants are designed for undergraduate students who
haven’t yet earned a bachelor’s or professional degree —
and this includes high school students heading into their
first year of college. These grants, which are given to stu-
dents based on need, are especially great because they
don’t have to be repaid. Note: Need is defined as the dif-
ference between what a student (and her parents or
guardians) can pay and the actual cost of her education.
No matter how desperate your financial position, the
most you can expect from the Federal Pell Grant program
is $4,050 per year.

Federal Supplemental
Educational Opportunity Grant
The FSEOG is a program designed for undergraduate stu-
dents with “exceptional financial need.” In plain English,
these students have to have a very low expected family
contribution (EFC), due to obvious poverty or immense
financial drain on their parents (such as supporting lots
of other kids in college or caring for elderly parents). The
first students to get any money from the FSEOG program
are Pell Grant recipients with the lowest EFCs. Like the
Pell Grant, FSEOG monies don’t have to be paid back.
If you qualify, you can get between $100 and $4,000 a year,
depending on when you apply, your financial need, and
the funding offered at the school you’re attending. Only
undergraduate students who haven’t earned a bachelor’s
or a professional degree are eligible for FSEOG awards.
Hope Scholarship and Lifetime
Learning Credits
Two of the best tax incentives aimed at middle class par-
ents of college students are the Hope Scholarship Credit
and the Lifetime Learning Credit. Both of these programs
offer tax credits to partially compensate parents (or
other tuition payers) for paying their dependent stu-
dents’ college tuition. Independent students can also
qualify for these credits. With these credits, you can
deduct a certain amount of your education costs from
your annual income to get a break on your taxes. For
more information on the Hope Scholarship Credit and the
Lifetime Learning Credit, go to www.irs.gov/faqs/

Make Use of Federal Loans
F
our major types of federal loans are available to stu-
dents or their parents: Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans,
Perkins Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Each type of
loan is aimed at a different set of people, each has its own
interest rate and repayment terms, and each has its own
advantages and disadvantages.
Some loans are subsidized, which means you don’t pay
interest on them until you graduate or otherwise leave
school. In other cases, the loans are unsubsidized, mean-
ing you’re charged interest from the day the loan is sent
to you to the day you pay it back. Unsubsidized loans are
less advantageous than their subsidized counterparts
because subsidized loans give you a free ride, without the
need to service the debt (in other words, pay interest)
while you’re in school.
All federal student aid (as well as state and college aid)
begins with the completion of the FAFSA.
Stafford Loans
Stafford Loans come from two different sources: either
the federal government or third-party lending institu-
tions. Each school chooses to use its money from the
Stafford program in one of these two ways:

 The school uses the Direct Loan Program, in which
the U.S. government directly loans you the money
you need for school. Under this program, the federal
government is your lender and you repay the loan to
Uncle Sam.
 The school disburses Stafford Loans in which the
U.S. government indirectly loans you the money
through its Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL)
Program. Under this program, third-party lenders
such as banks, credit unions, and other institutions
are your lenders and you repay them.
Stafford Loans are either subsidized or unsubsidized.
With a subsidized Stafford Loan, you won’t be charged
any interest until after you graduate, drop out, or leave
school for other reasons. These loans are awarded to stu-
dents with low expected family contribution (EFC)
amounts, based on the information they supply in their
FAFSAs. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans charge interest from
the time they’re disbursed until you completely pay them
off. By law, the interest rate on your Stafford Loan can’t
exceed 8.25 percent, and the actual rate is fixed once a
year in late June.
PLUS Loans
PLUS is an acronym for Parent Loans for Undergraduate
Students. You can probably guess that these loans are
aimed at parents of kids who are undergraduate students
at colleges. To qualify for PLUS Loans, parents must have
children who are enrolled at least half-time at an
approved educational institution. By law, interest rates
for PLUS Loans are set once a year but can never exceed
9 percent.
Part III: Putting Your Personal Finances on Firm Footing 
140

Similar to Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans have a maximum
allowable amount that can be borrowed: that maximum is
the difference between the cost of the student’s atten-
dance and any other financial aid the student receives (a
number set by the school’s financial aid office). If the cost
for the student to attend college is $7,000 and he receives
$4,500 in financial aid from other sources, his parents can
borrow up to $2,500.
Unlike Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans feature neither a grace
period during which no payments are due nor any period
during which interest doesn’t accrue. In other words, as
soon as the parents cash the PLUS Loan check (or the
money from a PLUS Loan hits your account at college),
the interest clock starts ticking. If you’re a parent with
one of these loans and you want to maintain your credit
rating, you must start paying off the PLUS Loans immedi-
ately and continue paying on a regular basis until the
debt (and its interest) is completely repaid.
Perkins Loans
Federal Perkins Loans are loans guaranteed by the U.S.
Department of Education and are available for undergrad-
uates and graduate students. Unlike Stafford Loans, how-
ever, Federal Perkins Loans have a fixed rate of interest
and are made by your college or other institution (the
government gives the college the money, and the college
distributes it). Federal Perkins Loans can’t be subsidized
by the U.S. Department of Education.
The Perkins Loan program is determined based on three
factors: when you apply, the level of need as determined
by your college, and the funding level of your school.
Schools generally pay out Perkins Loan payments twice a
year, and they usually disburse the money by check to
Make Use of Federal Loans 141

you or by direct deposit to your student account.
Typically, you have ten years to pay back any funds dis-
bursed under the Federal Perkins Loan program, and you
make your checks out directly to your school. You have a
grace period of nine months after you graduate, leave
school, or fall below part-time status before you must
begin to repay your Perkins loan. Under certain condi-
tions (such as active military duty), you may also defer
payment for a longer period of time.

Defer or Discharge 
Student Loan Debt
U
nder special circumstances, you can receive a
deferment on the repayment of your federal stu-
dent loans. In some circumstances, you may also be able
to have your entire debt forgiven (or to use the technical
term, discharged).
To be eligible for deferment, your loan can’t be in default.
If it is, contact the holder of the loan and get back on a
satisfactory payment program. And you must keep
making payments until you receive approval for defer-
ment. You can’t simply contact the loans office, ask for
the deferment, and then stop paying.
Deferring a Stafford Loan
In some cases, you may receive a deferment of your
Stafford Loan if you’re unable to find full-time employ-
ment after you graduate or if you experience severe eco-
nomic hardship. Many Peace Corps volunteers, for
example, are eligible for Stafford Loan deferment based
on economic hardship.

In some cases, you may be able to cancel your Stafford
Loan debt if you qualify under one of the following spe-
cific circumstances:
 You become a full-time elementary or secondary
teacher for five consecutive years in an area that
serves low-income families.
 Your school closes before you can complete your
program.
 Your school doesn’t pay out your loan amount.
 You file for bankruptcy and the bankruptcy court
decides that your student loan needs to be 
discharged.
 You die or become permanently disabled, making
work impossible.
Putting Off Perkins Payments
You automatically get a nine-month grace period with a
Perkins Loan, but you may be able to postpone repay-
ment even longer:
 If you’re unable to find work on a full-time basis,
deferring your Perkins Loans repayments for up to
three years may be possible.
 If you encounter severe economic hardship, you
may be able to defer your repayments for up to
three years.
 If you become a community service worker in such
professions as law enforcement, corrections, or
teaching in designated low-income areas, you may
be able to defer your Perkins Loans indefinitely.
Part III: Putting Your Personal Finances on Firm Footing 
144

Out and out cancellation of your Perkins Loan debt is
also possible. Examples of situations that may qualify for
up to 100 percent of the loan being discharged include
but are not limited to the following:
 Becoming a full-time special education teacher or a
teacher of children with diagnosed learning disabili-
ties at an elementary school, a secondary school, or
a nonprofit institution
 Performing early intervention services for the eld-
erly on a full-time, professional basis
 Serving as a full-time law enforcement or corrections
officer
 Becoming a full-time staff member in the education
division of a Head Start Program
And up to 70 percent of your Perkins Loan can be for-
given if you enlist in the AmeriCorps VISTA Program or
become a Peace Corps volunteer.

Consolidate Your 
College Loans
A
Consolidation Loan helps students and parents sim-
plify the college loan repayment process. As you
may guess from its name, a Consolidation Loan combines
or consolidates various student loans that are active
under your account.
Consolidation Loans are also useful whenever you want
to extend your repayment duration from a maximum of
10 years allowable under the Standard Repayment Plan
associated with the Stafford Loan to a maximum of 30
years allowable under the Consolidation Loan program.
Besides extending the repayment period, a Consolidation
Loan also offers potentially lower monthly payments,
albeit for a longer overall repayment period. In addition,
a Consolidation Loan can offer a way out when you’ve
defaulted on your loan.
You can secure a Consolidation Loan from two sources:
 Direct Consolidation Loans are available directly
from the U.S. government, specifically from the U.S.
Department of Education.

 FFEL Consolidation Loans are available from a vari-
ety of participating banks, credit unions, and other
lending institutions.
You can get more information about Consolidation Loan
options from the Loan Origination Center’s Consolidation
Department at 800-577-7392 or on the Web at www.loan
consolidation.ed.gov.

Find College-Based
Scholarships
C
olleges have resources to help you reduce the
amount of tuition you pay. Most financial aid officers
will work to help you apply for everything that may be
available, but you must take the first step by asking for
their help. Sometimes, asking for help is as easy as check-
ing a box on the applicable financial aid form. Students
who win more money go the extra mile by asking college
financial aid officers for help and advice.
 College-based scholarships: These awards are
funded by an existing endowment that’s been given
to the college by alumni or other interested parties.
These scholarships may be need-based, merit-
based, or a combination of the two.
 External scholarships or grants administered by
the college: These awards are funded by an endow-
ment held by a third party, typically outside the col-
lege. The college administers the scholarship, but
you may need to apply for it separately from your
general admission application.

149
#53
Access State and Local
Scholarships
L
ocal scholarships tend to offer money to fewer stu-
dents than their state or federal counterparts —
often only one student per year. But because fewer stu-
dents apply for these scholarships, you may have better
chances of winning these awards than the big-money
national scholarships. Talk to the following people and
groups to find out about these scholarships:
 High school guidance counselors and teachers:
The first person to talk to about getting free money
is your high school counselor. Part of his or her job
is to keep up on grants, scholarships, and loans that
may be available for students from your school. Talk
to your teachers about the colleges they attended
and ask them for scholarship help. Even if your
teacher has no specific information, he’ll probably
make a good reference if you decide to apply to his
alma mater.

 The local Parent-Teacher Association: Some PTAs
administer scholarship programs, and most have
information about them. If the person you talk with
at the PTA isn’t helpful, ask to be given access to the
national association of PTAs. The national associa-
tion is busy, but it’s an excellent source of contacts
if you have time and patience.
 Local government officials: Some local scholarship
programs operate virtually by word of mouth, so
talk with your local government representatives.
Drop in on the office, explain that you’re looking for
locally based scholarships, and ask for the appropri-
ate person.
 Chamber of Commerce: Your local Chamber of
Commerce should be able to help you identify top
businesses in town. Sometimes a Chamber of
Commerce offers a scholarship of its own, but this is
rare. Look around to see which companies sponsor
the Little League teams — companies that like to see
their names on the backs of young athletes may also
enjoy the prestige that comes with a scholarship
presentation ceremony.
 Banking community: Scholarships are held in
endowments, and someone has to administer these
endowments. Talk to the manager of your bank and
any other banks in the area to find out about any
grants or scholarships they administer.
 Places of worship: Like service organizations, reli-
gious institutions are parts of regional, national, and
international organizations. Awards may be avail-
able from any level. Ask!

Tap Organizations for
Scholarships
U
ndoubtedly, you have an inkling that some organi-
zations offer scholarships, but you may not know
which organizations to approach. Following is some help:
 Service and social clubs: The Elks Club, Lions Club,
Rotary Club, 4-H Club, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts,
and Greek organizations (college fraternities and
sororities) are just a few examples of service and
social clubs.
 Foundations formed by corporations, groups, or
individuals: These foundations include large organi-
zations with multiple awards, midsized organiza-
tions, and small organizations offering as few as one
scholarship a year.
 Employment or trade groups: Professional organi-
zations, trade unions, and military service organiza-
tions fall under this category.

Accept Work-Study
Opportunities
F
ederal Work-Study is frequently offered in your finan-
cial aid package. You don’t get paid much (at least
minimum wage), but Federal Work-Study jobs have three
distinct advantages:
 These jobs are supposed to be associated with your
field of study, and therefore, they help you gain rele-
vant experience. Of course, a chemistry major may
get a job washing out test tubes — not necessarily
great to put on the ol’ resume!
 Unlike an off-campus job delivering pizzas in which
you’re fully taxed on your wages, income from Work-
Study jobs is eligible for deduction from your modi-
fied adjusted gross income (MAGI). The end result is
that Work-Study jobs let you keep more of your
hard-earned money than a regular off-campus job.
 Work-Study jobs are usually based around your
class time; the same isn’t always true with off-
campus jobs that often interfere with your school-
work or study time.

153
#56
Negotiate Better Financial Aid
A
fter you apply to colleges and they offer you their
packages, you can try to negotiate a better deal. As
you do so, keep in mind that financial aid offices have a
set amount of need-based and merit-based funding they
can disperse, and they want to know they’re getting the
best possible students for the money.
Get More Need-Based Money
Getting more need-based money is generally your best
option. You may qualify for more need-based funding for
all sorts of reasons, including the following:
 Your circumstances have changed.
 The financial effects of certain parts of your infor-
mation may not be properly understood.
 Your assessment may not take into consideration
other factors.
When appealing your financial aid package based on
need, make sure you provide as much documentation as
possible to prove the points you’re making.

Get More Merit-Based Money
Negotiating for more merit-based money is a challenge
because most financial aid officers pledge almost all their
money when they send out admissions offers. Still, con-
vincing a financial aid officer that you truly should’ve
been offered a greater entrance scholarship based on
your vastly improved final marks or SAT/ACT scores is
possible, depending on the school. If the officer has any
discretionary budget left, your position may be
reassessed. If not, the officer can certainly help you apply
for other sources of funding, including departmental
scholarships and external scholarships.

Refinance a Fixed-Rate
Mortgage
I
f you have a fixed-rate mortgage and interest rates
drop, you may want to refinance the same loan to
reduce your monthly payments. The following table
shows monthly payments for 15- and 30-year fixed-rate
mortgages.
Interest Rate
Monthly 
Monthly Payments 
Payments (30 yr)
(15 yr)

$952
$1,137
12%
$1,029
$1,200

As you decide whether to refinance, consider the following:
 Closing costs will add to the principal. Every time
you redo the paper, a whole assortment of people,
from the lender of the title company to the
appraiser, get to charge you some sort of fee. You
have to add these refinancing fees into the loan prin-
cipal. If you refinance $100,000 and have $3,100
added to your debt because of closing costs, you’re
refinancing $103,100, so your new monthly rate,
instead of $665 per month, is actually $687 a month.
 When you plan to move. Your monthly payment
may go down, but whether that saves you money in
the long run depends on how long it takes to make
back the money you spent for the new loan. When
you start the new loan, your first payments go
almost exclusively to interest. If you sell the house
after two years, your loan balance is $100,930
(assuming the $3,100 in closing costs mentioned in
the previous point). You save $2,832 by making
lower payments for two years, but you actually owe
more on the loan than you did in the first place.
(Had you kept your original $100,000 loan amount at
9-percent interest, you’d owe $98,596 on the loan
after these two years.)

Develop Good 
Shopping Habits
S
hopping is a necessity as well as a popular form of
recreation, but it can often feel like a black hole on
your finances. To keep your shopping trips from turning
into a spending frenzy, take time to think about how you
can spend more thoughtfully.
When shopping, always keep the following in mind:
Reduce, reuse, and recycle. For example, don’t buy overly
processed, prepackaged foods. The more packaging and
processing involved, the more it costs you. Reduce pack-
aged and processed items. Prepackaged groceries gener-
ally cost at least twice as much as whole foods. For
example, you can buy ready-to-heat twice-baked potatoes
for approximately $1 per serving, or you can buy the
ingredients to make twice-baked potatoes from scratch
for less than 15¢ per serving.
Try to buy whole foods, in their natural state, whenever
possible: fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, and dairy products.
If you’re limiting your fat intake, buy fresh eggs and dis-
card half, or even all, of the yokes (the fat is in the yoke).
This approach costs you about half as much as the
reduced-fat egg substitute in a carton and is much fresher,
with no additives, preservatives, or food coloring.

Reduce trash by minimizing your use of paper towels, dis-
posable plates and cups, cloth diapers, plastic shopping
bags, and so on. Instead, reuse cloth towels and diapers
(they’re much cheaper and much more environmentally
friendly), and durable plates and cups, and take your
shopping bags with you to the grocery store. Many stores
credit you 5¢ per bag for bringing your own. Not only are
you saving money, but you’re also saving landfills. Over
the course of a year, simply reusing these items can save
you tens of dollars. Just think of how many other items
this concept could apply to.
Reduce the number of items you purchase by sharing
with, or renting from, others. For example, if you like to
garden, a rototiller comes in handy once or twice a year.
Instead of buying a rototiller, consider borrowing one
from a neighbor or renting one.

See through the Gimmicks
Grocery Stores Use
G
rocery stores spend money to learn how to fool
you into spending more in their store. Whether
they’re enticing you into the store in the first place with
sale items or convincing you to buy more expensive
items, be aware of some of these tactics:
 The aisle switcheroo: If you shop at a particular
store regularly, you know where everything you buy
is located in each aisle. Without realizing it, you’ve
developed a form of tunnel vision and don’t really
see anything except what you need. When the store
rearranges the aisles or moves items from one posi-
tion on a shelf to another, you have to look around
and actually focus on each aisle and every shelf. By
losing your tunnel vision for a time, the possibility
of something new catching your eye increases dra-
matically, and consequently your impulse purchases
increase, too.
 The store’s layout: Most grocery stores have the
same general floor plan — they keep produce,
bread, dairy, and meat products along the edges of
the store or up against the walls. By putting com-
monly purchased items against the farthest wall or
way off in a back corner, customers have to walk
past numerous displays and shelves full of goodies.

Shop the edges of the store to save considerably on
your grocery bill. Added benefit: The perimeter carries
the healthiest items in the store. Your waistline —
and your budget — will be healthier.
 The loss leaders: Stores advertise products for
essentially zero profit to entice new customers into
the store for the drastically reduced item. They’re
willing to take a loss on selected items because they
plan to recoup their loss through higher sales in
general due to the increased traffic. The key to
taking advantage of these so-called loss leaders with-
out letting loss leaders take advantage of you is to
not give in to temptation.
Check the expiration date on any loss leader pur-
chases. Often these items are near their expiration
date and the store is trying to clear them off its
shelves.
 Shelf arrangements: If you want to find the best
values on the grocery store shelves, look high on
the top shelves or bend down and look at the
bottom shelf. The brand-name and higher-priced
products (as well as products designed to entice
children) are located at eye level, while the generic,
store brand, and lower-priced items are in the more
awkward places to see.

Use Coupons Wisely
T
he key to effective coupon use is to be organized
about the process. Every coupon you need but can’t
easily locate is cash slipping through your fingers. Try
those little wallet-shaped coupon organizers you can slip
into your purse or pocket to keep your coupons organ-
ized by category. Once a month go through your coupon
organizer to check for expired coupons.
To make the most of your coupon savings, follow these
suggestions:
 Look for double- and triple-coupon deals.
 Look for coupons for items that are already on sale
or that are deeply discounted.
 Don’t assume you get the best deal with the coupon;
store brands can still be cheaper.
 Don’t plan your shopping list around the manufac-
turer’s coupons you’ve collected; instead make your
regular shopping list first, and then go to your
coupon wallet and see whether you have current
coupons for the items you’re buying.
 When shopping online, look for online coupon codes
to save on the purchase price or on shipping and
handling charges; just type the name of the site
you’re shopping at and coupons into your favorite
search engine to see what you find.

Target Seasonal 
Grocery Sales
I
n addition to in-store sales and offers, many food
items go on sale at regular times from year to year. For
example, March is National Frozen Food Month in the
United States, and to celebrate this prestigious event,
most grocery stores offer significant discounts on frozen
foods during the month of March. Throughout the rest of
the year, other food items are seasonally offered at dis-
counts. The lower prices usually reflect what’s currently
growing at local farms.
The following list includes food items you can find on
sale or at the lowest prices each month of the year:
 January: Turkey, apples, grapefruit, oranges, and
pears
 February: Post–Valentine’s Day candy and 
chocolates
 March: Frozen vegetables, meats, breakfast items,
and TV dinners
 April: Eggs, broccoli, and cauliflower
 May: Soda, hot dogs, hamburgers, buns, asparagus,
and pineapple

 June: Dairy products and tomatoes
 July: Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, corn,
cherries, squash, watermelons, cantaloupes, toma-
toes, plums, peaches, and nectarines
 August: Squash, green peppers, salad fixings,
berries, apples, melons, peaches, apricots, and fresh
fish

Plan Your Meals Economically
W
hether you’re feeding yourself or a family, meal-
times present a challenge when you want to save
money without sacrificing your favorites. You want
healthy, tasty menus that everyone will enjoy and that
won’t send your budget into cardiac arrest.
Find a Breakfast You and 
Your Wallet Will Love
With $5 boxes of cereal that are gone in a day, breakfast
bars not much cheaper, and egg prices going up and up,
breakfast can be one of the most expensive meals of the
day. Here are ways to save:
 Make homemade versions of frequently purchased
breakfast items, such as frozen waffles or instant
oatmeal. For example, make instant oatmeal at
home by briefly whirling oats in the blender or food
processor. Then just stir in boiling water as you nor-
mally would for instant oats.

 Keep a list of favorite breakfast ideas. Examples of
quick, healthy, and inexpensive options include
• Breakfast shakes or smoothies: Blend a few
ice cubes with your choice of fresh or generic
canned fruits and juice.
• Fresh or canned fruit: Whole, sliced, or
stewed.
• Omelets: Use up leftover pieces of meat, 
vegetables, and cheese to keep omelets 
inexpensive.
• Bagels: Serve toasted and spread with butter;
or spread with generic cream cheese. Sliced
strawberries, when they’re in season, and
generic cream cheese on bagels is an almost
decadent breakfast treat. Look for sales on
bagels and stock up. They keep for weeks in
the freezer.
• Mule food: Stir together uncooked rolled oats,
raisins, and nuts. Serve cold with milk and
your choice of sweetener (honey, sugar, brown
sugar, maple syrup, vanilla, fruit juice, almond
extract); or just stir the “mule food” into your
favorite flavored yogurt. Make this treat in
bulk and store in an air-tight container for a
great substitute for brand-name boxed 
granola.
• Use leftovers: Cold pizza makes a nice break-
fast. So does a cheese enchilada and vegetar-
ian lasagna.
Brown-Bag It in Style
Bringing homemade lunch items with you to work or
school is a surefire way to save money every day during
Plan Your Meals Economically 167

the week. But who says a packed lunch has to be PB&J
and pudding snacks in a paper bag? Turn a bagged lunch
into something special and still save a boatload of money
every week with these tips:
 Be creative with your menu: Vary your menu from
day to day to keep your palate happy. Even if you
like the routine of a sandwich every day, be creative
with the side dish.
 Spice it up: Add fresh herbs (fresh basil sprinkled
over leftover pasta, for example) or fancier condi-
ments (horseradish for the roast beef sandwich).
 Go for the extraordinary: Instead of run-of-the-mill
cheese cubes, pack a variety of cheeses (cheddar,
parmesan, and brie, for example) with a couple
slices of shaved ham, a few olives, some fruit, and
crackers. Trade up the white bread for crusty rolls
or baguettes. Roll the grapes in sugar, or take along
a small container of chocolate sauce for dipping
your fruit.
 Set your table: You may not be able to re-create the
ambience of a five-star restaurant in your office or
cafeteria, but you can make lunchtime more enjoy-
able by using a linen napkin, a real plate (or reason-
able facsimile), and genuine flatware. Keep these
items in your office if transporting them is a hassle.
 Take your time: Meals are meant to be savored,
even when you have only 15 minutes in which to eat.
So turn off the phone, turn away from the computer,
and enjoy your lunch.

Save on Scrumptious Dinners
Living well involves setting priorities; if yours include
being healthy and omitting needless spending, you know
that dinnertime makes it difficult to stay on track. The fol-
lowing list offers a few ideas to help you save time and
money and still end up with a great dinner:
 Serve breakfast for dinner: Bacon and eggs may be
a fairly expensive breakfast to serve the family, but
it’s a very cheap meal compared to most dinner
menus. For a healthier alternative, use turkey bacon
or sausage, or try a veggie-filled frittata. Making an
occasional breakfast for dinner can be a real treat.
 Focus on the sides: If you’re not a vegetarian, think
of meat as a side dish rather than the main course. A
small serving of chicken with a large tossed salad
and a generous serving of steamed vegetables or
rice is better for you and can save tremendously
compared to having the meat be the largest item on
your dinner plate.
 Serve salad. A chef salad, for example, includes a
little meat and a lot of vegetables, and it’s even
better and less expensive if the vegetables are in
season.

Save on Snacks
Kids thrive on the classic after-school snack, but adults
are often in need of a healthy pick-me-up as well. Give
these healthy, frugal snack options a try:
 Crackers with toppings: Spread peanut butter or
cream cheese on a cracker, or top with sliced meats
and cheeses.
 Assorted cheeses: Serve cubed or sliced cheeses
alone or with apples, crackers, celery, or meats.
 Popcorn: Sprinkle popcorn with flavored salt or
Parmesan cheese for a nice change of pace.
 Fresh fruit in season: Limit this healthy afternoon
snack to one piece of fruit per person or the cost
can quickly become prohibitive.
 Cut-up veggies: Keeping cut-up celery, carrots, cauli-
flower, broccoli, or other veggies on hand and easily
accessible in the fridge makes healthy snacking a
piece of cake or, in this case, a piece of vegetable.
 Cinnamon toast: Toast the bread, spread the butter,
sprinkle on a bit of sugar and cinnamon, and you’re
good to go.
 Mock ice cream sandwich: Put 2 tablespoons of
frozen whipped topping between two chocolate
graham crackers, wrap it in wax paper, and freeze
for a half hour. It tastes just like an ice cream sand-
wich, but it’s healthier (especially if you use lowfat
whipped topping) and less expensive.

Stretch One Meal into 
Two (Or More)
T
ossing a glob of warmed-up old noodles onto a plate
doesn’t entice many appetites. But if you use a little
creativity, leftovers can be fun, tasty, inexpensive meal
starters. By camouflaging the leftovers from meal to
meal, even your pickiest eaters will have trouble recog-
nizing the roasted chicken from dinner two nights ago in
today’s pasta salad luncheon.
Make a Leftover Buffet
Plan one meal each week that uses up the assorted left-
overs accumulating on the refrigerator shelves. It’s like
getting a free meal every week.
After accumulating about half a dozen containers of left-
overs, reheat them in the microwave and portion out a
little bit of everything onto each person’s plate.
Generally, nobody ends up with more than a spoonful or
two of any one item, but the variety of items gives it the
look of a full plate after you’ve gone through a buffet line
at a party: a dab of lasagna, a slice of roasted chicken,
half a black bean enchilada, a forkful of several types of

salad. Toss some crackers, sliced cheese, and fresh cut-
up veggies into the mix, and you have an easy dinner that
the whole family enjoys.
Sandwich Your Leftovers 
into Savings
A favorite use for leftovers is to make sandwiches for
lunch or dinner. Whether it’s leftover roast beef made
into French dips, or sliced meatloaf with mayo and
ketchup, or an open-faced turkey sandwich smothered in
gravy, your family will love the results. Rolling leftover
meats and veggies into a cold, flour tortilla with a bit of
cream cheese and a pickle is also a delicious way to add
some variety to the typical sandwich presentation.
Stretch the Bird
Chicken and turkey are dreams come true if you want to
stretch one meal into several others. For a family of four,
you can usually stretch at least three meals from each
chicken purchase: a roast chicken dinner meal consisting
of the drumsticks, thighs, and wings; a casserole, stir-fry,
or skillet meal prepared with the cut breast meat roasted
the night before; and a hearty, homemade chicken soup
made from any leftover meat and bones. Each time you
buy a chicken, plan ahead for the three chicken meals.
Turkeys, because of their size, can yield even more
meals. Round one can be a turkey dinner with all the
trimmings. Then from the leftovers, create casseroles,
sandwiches, stir-fry, pot pies, you name it. After you pick
the bones clean of meat, make a turkey broth (follow the
same recipe to make a chicken broth):

1. Place the carcass in a 6-quart saucepan.
2. Add 2 carrots and 2 stalks of celery cut into 
1-inch pieces and one onion, peeled and whole.
3. Fill the pot with enough water to cover by 1
inch. Bring to a boil over high heat.
4. Lower heat to a simmer and cook for 11⁄2 hours.
5. When cooled to room temperature, remove and
discard the carcass and vegetables.
6. Pour the liquid though a fine strainer. Season
the broth with salt and black pepper to taste.
Stretch One Meal into Two (Or More) 173
Make your own mixes
For the sake of convenience, you probably buy premade and prepack-
aged products (such as salad dressing, taco seasoning, and cookie and
cake mixes). Going homemade is not only cheaper, but also considerably
healthier. You can choose which ingredients to use, and you also know
that no flavorings, colorings, or preservatives are added.
Find recipes for convenience items by looking at the ingredient lists on
the package and getting a good idea of what to use, browsing through
all-purpose cookbooks and cooking-related books at the library, and log-
ging on to www.recipesource.com/misc/mixes or www.
frugalitynetwork.com/frugalrecipes.mixes.html.

Save on Baby Food
F
rugal hardly seems like a word to use in the same
sentence as “baby food,” which can really take a bite
out of the ol’ budget. But buying the expensive prepack-
aged baby foods isn’t the only way to feed baby. You have
numerous less expensive (and more healthful) options:
 Breastfeed: The least expensive baby food available
is the mother’s milk: it’s free. If you can breastfeed
your little one, you save a bundle compared to
buying formula, and you’re also providing your baby
with the best possible nutrition. Even if you’re work-
ing full time outside the home, breastfeeding is still
an option. For breastfeeding tips, contact a local
breastfeeding organization such as La Leche League
(www.lalecheleague.org), or ask your local hospi-
tal or doctor’s office to recommend a certified lacta-
tion consultant.
 Process your own baby food: Serve your baby tiny
servings — well-processed in the blender or food
processor first — of most anything the family is
already eating: potatoes, carrots, peas, or even
homemade chicken soup. Take care to leave out
spices and any additives in baby’s portion.
Prepare a large batch of baby food at one time so
you don’t need to do it at every meal. For example,
cook and puree a big bunch of carrots, freeze the

puree in ice cube trays, pop out the frozen food
cubes, and place in labeled zip-top freezer bags.
When your baby’s ready to eat, just take out a frozen
carrot cube, thaw it, warm slightly, and dinner is
served.
 If you buy premade baby food, buy the largest jars
available. The little bitty jars may be meal-sized for
baby’s tiny appetite, but they’re expensive too.
When you open a large jar, spoon out a small por-
tion onto a plate or bowl, and then cover the jar and
refrigerate it. The large jar of food lasts for about
two meals this way, rather than just one.
 Dilute regular juice to give to baby: The special
baby juice at the grocery store is really nothing
more than diluted regular juice. Just buy regular 100-
percent juice in frozen concentrate form (with no
additives or sweeteners), but then add twice the
amount of water (or more) recommended when
you’re reconstituting the juice.

Cook Up Money Savings
E
ating out often can zap your budget, but busy sched-
ules make it difficult to find the time to fix healthy,
tasty, and economical home-cooked meals. The sugges-
tions here can help.
Cook in Bulk
The idea of cooking in bulk and freezing the premade
meals puts off many people. They hear terms referring to
monthly cooking or 30-day cooking, and they roll their
eyes. But think of it more as a concept. If you don’t have
the freezer space, the energy, or organizational where-
withal for a full month of cooking in one pop, try twice-a-
month, or even once-a-week. Or just double and triple
recipes as you prepare them.
Here’s how bulk cooking works: When you make chili,
make enough for three meals. Eat one tonight, and then
package the extra in labeled freezer bags. You now have
two meals ready to go in just minutes for those nights
when you’re in a hurry. Just pop the freezer bag in the
microwave or pour the thawed chili into a pan on the
stovetop, toss together a green salad, and dinner is
served.

For additional savings, plan your bulk-cooking sessions
around the supermarket’s sales. Suppose, for example,
that your grocery store has whole fryers on sale. You buy
the maximum number of fryers the store allows (four in
this example) and do a chicken mini-session: You cut up
the fryers, and then prepare and freeze the following
meals:
 Two or three meals’ worth of marinated thighs
and drumsticks in plastic freezer bags. The chicken
marinates while it’s frozen and also while it thaws.
You can use homemade Italian-style salad dressing
for a marinade or generic or store-brand dressing.
To serve, thaw completely, pour off the marinade,
and then cook the chicken pieces on the barbecue
or under the oven broiler.
 Two meals of chicken cacciatore. A tasty freeze-
ahead version consists of sliced chicken breast, a jar
of spaghetti sauce, stewed tomatoes, and some
sautéed onions and green pepper strips. Thaw the
cacciatore and serve it over pasta or rice.
 Several meals’ worth of cooked chicken. Cut the
chicken into medium-sized chunks to use in skillet
meals or casseroles. Having freezer bags with pre-
cooked and frozen chicken pieces makes later meal
preparation a snap.
 A large pot of homemade chicken noodle soup.
Soup is usually good for at least two meals, maybe
more, depending on how hungry the troops are
when they’re ready to eat.
Be sure to vary your menus to keep your family happy.
Even when foods are dressed differently, few people like
the same thing night after night. Just because you’ve pre-
pared all these chicken-based meals doesn’t mean you
have to serve them one day after another.
Cook Up Money Savings 177

To ensure your meals are thawed and ready to heat up at
dinner time, plan your dinners two days in advance. Most
frozen casseroles, for example, take about 48 hours to thaw.
Use a Slow Cooker
A slow cooker is both convenient and a money saver.
When you come home at dinnertime, dinner’s nearly
done, eliminating the temptation to run out for something
quick (and usually less healthy and definitely more
expensive). But slow cookers can save you money in
other ways:
 You can cook larger meals, providing leftovers and
possibly a second meal from one cooking time.
 You can buy tougher (and less expensive) cuts of
meat because the slow cooker acts as a tenderizer.
 Meat shrinks less when cooked in the slow cooker
and doesn’t dry out. Also, flavors have time to
develop while your meal cooks all day.
 A slow cooker doesn’t use as much electricity as an
oven, nor does it heat up the kitchen nearly as much
as the stovetop or oven, so it’s a perfect hot-weather
cooking appliance.
 A slow cooker frees up oven and stovetop space
during a large cooking session for the freezer.
 Tofu, an inexpensive meat substitute, tastes better
cooked in a slow cooker because it has time to soak up
the flavors of the broth, spices, and other ingredients.
A pressure cooker has many benefits similar to the slow
cooker and is also much faster. If you don’t have all day
for your meal to simmer on the counter, the pressure
cooker is a great option.

Can It!
H
ome-canning is a safe and economical way to pre-
serve high-quality food. If you love fresh ingredi-
ents, like working in the kitchen, and want to create
gourmet-quality specialty foods for less than you’d spend
in the gourmet aisle of a supermarket, you can save
money and eat well with a little effort. The money savings
comes from two factors:
 With a well-stocked pantry of canned produce, you
can eliminate or significantly reduce having to buy
expensive alternatives.
 The best produce for canning is fresh, fresh, fresh.
You’re lucky if you grow your own fruit or veggies,
or have a friend who shares hers with you. Or you
can buy in bulk from farmers markets when the pro-
duce is in season. Some growers offer a “pick your
own” option, which is even cheaper yet.
Types of Canning
Although you may hear of many canning methods, only
two are approved by the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA):

 Water-bath canning: This method uses a large kettle
of boiling water. Filled jars are submerged in the
water and heated to an internal temperature of 212
degrees Fahrenheit for a specific period of time. Use
this method for processing high-acid foods, such as
fruit, items made from fruit, pickles, pickled food,
and tomatoes.
 Pressure canning: Pressure canning uses a large
kettle that produces steam in a locked compart-
ment. The filled jars in the kettle reach an internal
temperature of 240 degrees Fahrenheit under a spe-
cific pressure (stated in pounds) that’s measured
with a dial gauge or weighted gauge on the pressure-
canner cover. Use a pressure canner for processing
vegetables and other low-acid foods, such as meat,
poultry, and fish.
In both of these methods, your filled jars of food are
heated to a high temperature that destroys microorgan-
isms and produces a vacuum seal. Produce a safe prod-
uct by using the correct method for the food type,
following the recipe instructions to the letter, and com-
pleting each processing step.
Canning with Success
Follow these tips for achieving success as a home canner:
 Start with the freshest, best products available.
 Know the rules and techniques for your canning or
preserving method.
 Work in short sessions to prevent fatigue and poten-
tial mistakes.
Part IV: Living a Recession-Busting Life 
180

 Stay up-to-date on new or revised guidelines for
your preserving method.
 Use the correct processing method and processing
time to destroy microorganisms.
 Know the elevation you’re working at.
 Put together a plan before you start your preserving
session.
Can It! 181
Grow your own produce
Whether you have a large or small yard (or no yard at all), you can grow
a garden that drastically cuts down your produce bill five months out of
the year. Here’s how:
 Pick a prime location. The garden should get six to eight hours of
sun a day and be in close proximity to both your house and the water
supply. Or try container gardening, which works wonders on small
decks and patios.
 Decide what veggies to grow: Start with about four or five easy-to-
grow varieties of vegetables (such as tomatoes, bush beans, lettuce,
cucumbers, and zucchini) — whatever your family eats regularly
and works well with your soil and climate conditions. For specifics
about regional growing recommendations for your area, consult a
local home and garden center or ask your friendly gardening neigh-
bors what they suggest.
 Weed and enjoy!

Other Ways to Save 
in the Kitchen
E
very tip helps when you’re trying to save money in
the kitchen, so here’s a list of easy ideas to help cut
the cost of family meals.
 Keep lettuce fresh longer by rinsing and drying it
thoroughly. (Use a salad spinner, if available.) Then
cut the lettuce into salad-size pieces (use a lettuce
knife to reduce the risk of bruising), place in a zip-
top bag, try to get all the excess air out of the bag,
and then store the bag of lettuce in the refrigerator.
Each time you use some of the lettuce, press the air
out again. Lettuce keeps for as long as a week this
way if it’s dry before you place it in the bag.
 Don’t rinse produce until you’re going to use it; oth-
erwise, it can mold and get slimy faster.
 Save the bits and pieces of leftover pie crust in a zip-
top bag in the freezer. When you have enough in the
bag, you can make another pie crust or two from the
thawed pieces.
 Use half the amount of meat called for in the recipe
when making a casserole or skillet meal, and then
add inexpensive vegetables or pasta to fill in for the
missing meat.

 Stretch ground beef in hamburgers, meatloaves, and
meatballs by stirring in cut-up bread crusts, oat-
meal, homemade bread crumbs, cracker crumbs, or
plain cereals. This is a great way to use up stale
crackers.
 Use turkey hot dogs instead of beef or pork. Turkey
is often half the price.
 Buy blocks of cheese when they’re on sale, grate,
and place in a large zip-top freezer bag. Use it as
needed. If the cheese clumps together in the freezer,
bang the bag against the kitchen counter to loosen.
 Buy eggs when they’re on sale and freeze for later
use in baking, omelets, and scrambled eggs. Don’t
freeze the eggs whole; crack each egg into a section
of a clean plastic ice cube tray. When frozen, remove
the egg cubes from the tray and package in a large zip-
top freezer bag. Use as needed. The thawed out eggs
should be used quickly — they’re very perishable.
 Fill the oven with baking potatoes when you have to
heat it up to bake a few potatoes for dinner. Eat
tonight’s potatoes, cool the leftover ones, and freeze
in zip-top bags. For a quick and inexpensive meal or
side dish, reheat the frozen potatoes in the
microwave.

Save on Salon Expenses
W
hen you’re trying to be a conscientious consumer,
salon visits pose a dilemma. On the one hand, vis-
iting a stylist once every six weeks is a luxury you can
surely do without. On the other hand, looking and feeling
good is darn near priceless. The key is to find a balance
that lets you have your cake and eat it to. Here are some
ideas:
 Negotiate services with your stylist.
 Extend time between visits.
 Go to a discount salon or a beauty college between
visits with your regular stylist.
 Trim your own bangs to extend the life of your style
between salon visits.
 Cut your kids’ hair yourself rather than taking them
to the salon. They don’t need the extra pampering
just yet.

Expand Your Wardrobe
D
ressing well doesn’t have to equal dressing expen-
sively. A great place to find clothing is at thrift
stores and garage sales. Even if your family’s wardrobe
consists of almost nothing but secondhand clothing, you
can all still look great. The following sections suggest
other ways to expand your child’s wardrobe without deci-
mating your budget.
A wardrobe of basic colors and simple styles makes mix-
and-match dressing practical, easy, and much less expen-
sive than buying outfits made of pieces that can only be
worn with each other.
Make the Most of 
Hand-Me-Downs
Using hand-me-downs is a wonderful way to save money
and recycle still serviceable clothing items. If you have
friends and family with kids slightly older than yours, ask
them to save their children’s outgrown clothing for you.
Most parents are happy to save clothes for a friend, but
may not know who’s interested in their hand-me-downs.

Exchange Clothing
Start a regular group clothing exchange throughout the
year. Here’s how it works: Everyone brings her family’s
outgrown or discarded clothing to someone’s home, dis-
plays it on a table, and then sorts through everyone
else’s castoffs to find clothing for her own family. At the
end of the exchange, the leftovers are boxed up and
donated to a thrift store.
Shop Seasonally and Plan Ahead
At the end of each season, you can find huge savings on
seasonal clothing items. The best selection of clothes is
usually at the beginning of the season, but the best bar-
gains are at the end. Watch for seasonal sales at local
stores, where you can stock up on items you’ll use
throughout the year.
If you’re buying for your kids and you see an excellent
price, stock up on larger sizes. Your kids can grow into
them as time passes.
Save on School Clothes
Wait until the school year begins to buy the bulk of your
kids’ school clothing, so they can see what’s in style and
what’s out of fashion. Waiting until after school starts
allows you to take advantage of clearance sale prices at
department stores, thrift stores, and secondhand shops.

These driving techniques can help you save fuel:
 Arrange your car seat as comfortably as possible.
 Start and accelerate slowly and smoothly.
 Obey the speed limits, especially in city traffic.
 Try to stay in your lane.
 Set a steady pace.
 Build up speed slowly before you get to a hill.
 If you have a manual transmission, shift into higher gears as soon
as possible.

Remove Stains from Clothing
H
ere are some ideas to try for some common stub-
born stains:
 Baby formula: Apply stick stain remover as soon
as possible. Let it sit overnight, and then launder as
usual. If the stain persists, soak overnight in a solu-
tion of non-chlorine bleach mixed with warm water
(use 1⁄4 scoop bleach per gallon of water). Launder
again.
 Blood: Rinse immediately with cool water. Hot
water sets the stain and makes it harder to remove.
Dab hydrogen peroxide on white fabrics. If the stain
persists, soak overnight in a solution of non-chlorine
bleach and warm water.
 Chocolate: Rinse immediately with cold water. If
the stain persists, soak overnight in a solution of
non-chlorine bleach and warm water.
 Grass: Apply a stick stain remover immediately.
Let sit overnight. Wash as usual. Or pretreat
overnight in non-chlorine bleach mixed with water.
 Gravy: Rinse thoroughly in cold water as soon as
possible. If the spot is dry, soak it in cold water for
several hours. If the stain remains, apply liquid dish-
washing detergent directly to the stain. Squeeze the

detergent into the fabric so it gets between the
fibers. Let sit overnight. Rinse thoroughly in cold
water, and then wash as usual.
 Ink: Apply stick stain remover as soon as possible.
Gently work stain remover into the fabric. Let it sit
for several hours before washing. Launder in cold
water.
 Juice: Pretreat with liquid dishwashing detergent
or stick stain remover. Wash as usual in hot water.
Repeat pretreatment and laundering if necessary.
 Ketchup: Rinse the stain in cold water immedi-
ately. Soak the garment in cold water for several
hours. Launder in cold water. If the stain remains,
use stick stain remover, let sit overnight, and laun-
der again.

Reconstruct Your Clothes
R
econstructing clothing is the practice of creating
new clothes from existing garments. Some examples
of this include
 Adding a simple hood to a jacket
 Cutting the sleeves off a T-shirt
 Turning your sheets into a skirt
 Cropping a sweater
 Creating a couture evening gown from an old duvet
cover
When it comes to saving cash, reusing and reconstructing
clothes just can’t be beat.
Types of Reconstruction
People with all levels of sewing skill can reconstruct
clothes. Creative types who don’t like to use patterns
excel at this, and it’s a fun way to make old or out-of-style
clothing new again.

Mind-altering alterations
Sometimes clothing is just fine in its present form, but it
needs a little something. Maybe you want to add a little
pizzazz and individuality to your garment, or maybe you
want to fix a poor fit, hide stains, or spruce up a worn ’n’
torn favorite.
Lots of clothing is well-made and practical. But it can also
be boring and can look exactly like every other piece that
was mass-produced from the same factory! Some less
intense reconstruction techniques serve to elevate your
ho-hum hoodie to a truly unique piece of self-expression:
 Sewing a hem with contrasting color thread
 Taking in a seam with the seam placed externally
 Decorative patching on wear ’n’ tear
 Decorative stitching on patches and hems
 Decorative painting over stains
These techniques are exciting for all levels of skill and
creativity. And they’re perfect for those pieces that you’re
on the fence about banishing from your closet! Plus you
have lots of no-sew options with this method.
Clothing for cloth
What do you do when your heart can’t let go of a piece,
but you can’t bear to see it hang wastefully in the storage
closet? Dismantle the existing garment, creating flat
fabric that you can salvage and incorporate into other
things, like a quilt. You may choose to do this for a vari-
ety of reasons:
Reconstruct Your Clothes 191

 The fabric is gorgeous but the garment is horrible
 The garment shape can’t be maintained because of
style or other pitfalls
 The garment is excessively large
 The fabric is an oh so precious vintage
 The fabric is of high quality, such as silk
 The fabric has extensive beadwork or other embell-
ishments that you want to save
 The garment has sentimental significance, but the
style and fit aren’t for you

Have Fun in Your Own
Backyard and Beyond
T
he family activities highlighted here are not only fun
and cost next to nothing, but they also help build
family relationships because you spend time together
pursuing enjoyable pastimes.
Take a Family Field Trip
A meaningful family field trip can be simple, like taking a
leisurely walk down a local nature trail and watching a pair
of red squirrels do aerial acrobatics. Or extend the field
trip and follow the path of Lewis and Clark across the
United States for a long — but relatively inexpensive —
educational family vacation. Even camping in your own
backyard can be an adventure of sorts. Here are the rules:
 Choose an event the entire family enjoys. The
weekly “What’s Happening?” section of the newspa-
per and monthly issues of regional parenting maga-
zines — often available for free in libraries and
bookstores — provide a never-ending variety of
activities that appeal to the entire family, from
preschoolers to adults. Also, your local library may

offer classes, readings, and live performances for
kids. Check your library’s bulletin board for notices
about family-friendly activities and attractions.
 Do a little pretrip planning. A little advance plan-
ning can make for a more enjoyable — and less
expensive — trip. Before you leave home, pack
some inexpensive snack supplies and drink bottles,
confirm driving directions, check on admission
prices, and check your destination’s Web site for
any “online only” coupons (this would also be a
good time to check for unanticipated park closures
or hour changes).
Discover the Games People Play
Family games can be enjoyed whenever you want some
inexpensive entertainment and time together. Institute a
family game night.
If you don’t have a closet full of board games, you can
acquire them inexpensively at garage sales and thrift
stores. If someone asks what to get you or your family for
a gift at the holidays, suggest a board game.
Board games aren’t the only family-friendly games to play
on a family game night. Do you remember Charades? How
about Spoons? Twenty Questions? Hide the Thimble?
Spotlight Tag? Rummy? Crazy Eights? Delve into the
recesses of your mind and try to remember the games
you played as a kid. The games may be old to you, but
they’re new to your kids!
Have Fun in Your Own Backyard and Beyond 195

Plan a Movie Night
Going out to a movie can be real treat — and, given the
price of tickets nowadays, even matinees can break the
bank. But even if heading to the Cineplex is no longer
within your budget, you don’t have to forego the enjoy-
ment of watching films. Rent a video, pop some corn, and
invite the kids to a movie night.
Check out churches and libraries where you can often
borrow movies for free. If you have cable television, keep
your eye on the movie listings. You can record movies
early in the week to watch on the weekends. Movies
recorded from the television are not only free, but they
also save you a drive to the video store or library.

Save for a Family Vacation
F
inding money in the family’s budget for a trip — large
or small — can be challenging but not impossible. If
you cut back on smaller activities during the year, you
can pocket the money you save and put it into your vaca-
tion fund. Here are some ideas for saving a little here and
a little there to fund a family getaway:
 Watch movies on television.
 Save all your loose change in a jar.
 Have a yard sale.
 Sell some clothing at a consignment store.
 Babysit or work a part-time job during the school
year.
 Tally up the money you save by using coupons at
the grocery store each week and put that amount in
a vacation fund.

Travel on a Few Dollars a Day
A
ll travel seems to have the same basic expenses:
food, accommodations, and fun activities. What you
spend on these things can amount to a lot or a little. The
difference depends on where you go, how you get there,
and what you do when you get there.
Choose Less-Expensive 
Travel Times
If possible, take your vacation during off times. The
months of May and September (in the Northern
Hemisphere) are especially good times to travel because
they’re not as hot as July or August, they’re not prime
tourist season, and the weather is usually nice. Many
resorts offer a schedule of rates, showing their peak and
off-seasons. To maximize your money and enjoyment of
available perks, make your reservation for the week just
before the peak time starts or right after it ends.
Be aware that “off times” in your area may not be “off
times” at your destination. Holidays and regular breaks
from school (winter and spring break, summer vacation
from school) are also usually expensive times for travel.

Book Affordable Accommodations
Accommodations are often one of the most expensive
parts of any vacation. But less-expensive alternatives
exist:
 Camping: If you have a tent or a trailer, you can
often pull into a campground almost anywhere and
find a spot to sleep for about $40 per night for the
whole family.
 Hotels: If you plan to stay at a hotel, be sure to ask
about special prices or seasonal deals when you call
to make a reservation. Depending on when you’re
traveling, ask about Sunday nights, which are often
slow and hotels offer cheaper rates to encourage
customers to stay.
Call during the day when the office staff are on duty.
They’re more likely to know what special discounts
or rates the hotel is offering.
 Home swaps: Working out a house swap with friends
or family who live in different cities or countries can
be a great way to get a vacation for no more than the
cost of airfare and food. For more information on
house swapping, visit www.homelink.org or do a
Web search for house swapping.
 Timeshares: If you travel often, buying the right to
use a condo or home during particular weeks of the
year can be a good money-saving idea in the long
run. (Remember: If you buy a timeshare from the
owner instead of from the resort or developer, you
save substantially.)
Travel on a Few Dollars a Day 199

Traveling in a group can cut accommodation costs. Take
a vacation with some other families or your in-laws. Rent
a big house at the ocean or stay in a mountain lodge and
have everyone split the cost.
Eat Well for Less
Don’t eat all your meals in restaurants. Here are some
ideas for restaurant alternatives:
 If your hotel or motel offers a free breakfast, take full
advantage of it.
 Eat a huge breakfast, and then have a light lunch of
fruit and cheese or an energy bar.
 Visit a local supermarket and pick up the ingredients
for a picnic. Make your own sandwiches, grab a bag
of chips, and buy whatever soda is on sale.
 Stay hydrated. Thirst can be mistaken for hunger,
and getting something to drink is usually a lot
cheaper (think water fountain) than getting some-
thing to eat.
 Carry snacks with you so you’re not tempted to buy
pricey snacks to satisfy your hunger pangs.
You’ll likely want to eat in restaurants at least part of the
time — you’re on vacation, after all. Plan your main meal
around lunchtime. Restaurants’ lunch menus are similar
to dinner menus, but the cost is greatly reduced.

Plan for Fun, Not Flash
One of the best ways to save money on vacation is to
under-plan activities. You don’t have to see everything.
Three major activities per area or per city is a good aver-
age. Or no more than two major activities per day. Spend
the rest of your time just hanging out and wandering
around.
Look into the cheap — or free! — activities your destina-
tion offers: hiking, walking on the beach, making sand
castles, having a campfire, star-gazing, fishing, crabbing,
or swimming.

Save on Phone Bills
K
eeping in touch by phone is an expensive proposi-
tion, so cutting back on the monthly phone bill is a
welcome relief to many pocketbooks:
 Check your phone bill and make sure you’re not
paying for extra services you never use or don’t
need. If you have an answering machine, you proba-
bly don’t need voice mail from the phone company.
If you have voice mail but no answering machine,
consider buying one. Owning your own machine is
less expensive over time than paying monthly fees
for voice mail.
 Check to see whether your phone company offers a
flat rate or a measured service plan that can save
you money based on how often you call or on the
times and days you usually use the phone.
 Use a cellphone for long-distance calls. (Most plans
charge a flat fee a set number of minutes that you
can use for both local and long-distance calls.) If you
use your landline for long-distance calls, make them
in the evenings and on weekends, when rates are
usually lower. If you make a lot of long-distance
calls, find a calling plan that suits the amount of
calls you make.

 Look into Internet phone services that offer free or
reduced plans. For example, if you (and the person
you want to call) have webcams, you can use Skype
(www.skype.com) to make free video calls anywhere
in the world.
 To save money on cellphone bills, look for plans
that offer minutes the entire family can share or that
offer free minutes if you call in-network; instead of
getting a phone for each child, get a single phone
your children can share; examine your monthly bill
to see how you’re using your minutes and, if you
consistently have minutes left over, ask about drop-
ping to a cheaper plan.
 Investigate package deals. Getting phone, Internet,
and TV service from one provider can often save
you money.
 Send an e-mail (it’s free) or rediscover the joys of
letter writing. Sending cards and letters via the U.S.
Postal Service doesn’t have to cost much more than
the price of a first-class stamp if you watch for spe-
cials on stationery while you’re shopping.

Stay Cool on the Cheap
F
ollowing are some ways to stay cool, even when it’s
hot outside:
 To drop your cooling (and heating) bills dramati-
cally, add insulation to your home. First insulate
your attic floor, and then when time and money
allow, add insulation to your basement, exterior
walls, floors, and crawl spaces (in that order).
 Improve attic ventilation: Adequate ventilation
under the eaves allows cooler air to enter and circu-
late throughout the attic. If you don’t have a perma-
nent exhaust fan, you can set a box fan with the air
flow pointed outward to pull the hot air out of the
house.
 Shade your house from the sun: If your house isn’t
shaded by trees, install awnings over any windows
that are exposed to direct sun during the day. Many
awnings are removable and adjustable, so you aren’t
stuck with them when you don’t need them.
 Cover your windows: Windows are a major source
of heat during the summer. Reduce the heat coming
in through your windows by closing the drapes
during the day, adding reflective window tint to
southern windows, and hanging old-fashioned
bamboo shades on the outside of heat-producing
windows.

 If you use an air conditioner to cool your house,
turn the thermostat up a bit higher than the tem-
perature you usually set. If you normally set the
A/C for 72 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer,
switch to 78 degrees. When it’s 95 degrees in the
shade outside, 78 degrees still feels comfortable and
not too warm. Also set the temperature higher for
times when you’re not there.
 Use fans to circulate air. Moving air feels several
degrees cooler than still air. A ceiling fan can cool
the whole room, but even a small box fan or oscillat-
ing fan keeps the air moving.
 Reduce how much heat you create inside your
house: Use your outdoor grill more often to keep
from heating up the kitchen. Cook in the microwave,
slow cooker, electric skillet, or toaster oven, rather
than the stove and oven. Don’t use the heat setting
on your clothes dryer.

Warm Up for Less
S
tay cozy and still save money on your heating bills
by following these hints.
Turn Down the Thermostat
The simplest way to save money on heating is to turn
down your furnace a couple degrees. If you usually keep
your thermostat set at 72 degrees Fahrenheit during the
winter, turn it down to 70. If you’re used to 70-degree tem-
peratures, set the thermostat at 68. Lower the tempera-
ture even further at night when you’re sleeping. Toss on
an extra blanket if you’re still a bit chilled.
Consider these other ways to stay warm without running
up your heating bill:
 Close the vents and doors in rooms that aren’t in
use for long periods of time.
 A ceiling fan set to push air down keeps warm air
circulating to the lower regions of the house.
 Higher humidity keeps the air warmer. Here are a
couple of simple ideas to add warm moisture:
• Let steamy air from the bathroom escape into
the rest of the house after a shower.

• Boil water on the stovetop.
• Keep a kettle or pan full of water on top of
your wood-burning stove or radiator.
Deal with Drafts
A well-insulated house can help you save quite a bit on
your heating bills (and cooling bills, too). New houses are
often built with energy-efficient features such as thermal-
paned windows, well-insulated walls, and energy-efficient
water heaters and furnaces. If you don’t live in a newer
house, consider using some of the following ideas to
increase the benefits of your home’s current heating
system.
 Add a layer of air between your windows and the
great outdoors (the air insulates much better than
the window glass alone). Some ideas:
• If you have storm windows, use them.
• Stretch thick sheets of plastic across the
inside of your window frames.
• Hang heavy curtains that you can pull closed
at night. During the day, open your curtains,
especially those on southern windows, for
passive solar heating.
• After dark, hang blankets or quilts in front of
the windows for added insulation. Install a
decorative curtain rod above your existing
window treatment, and then simply fold a
blanket or quilt over the rod.
Warm Up for Less 207

 Use a draft stopper at the bottom of outside doors.
You can make one, buy an inexpensive one, or roll
up a bathroom towel and place it next to the bottom
of the door.
 Fill areas behind electric switch plates that are on
outside walls with plastic foam or purchase plastic
insulation that’s already cut to size and made for
this purpose.
 Close the flue on your fireplace when you’re not
using it. Leaving a fireplace flue open is like having a
vacuum hose hooked to your house, sucking the
warm air right out the chimney.

Make Your Own Cleaning
Solutions
You don’t need a cabinet full of the latest cleaners
from your local supermarket. Rather, a few simple
household ingredients can provide all you need to keep
your house and appliances sparkling.
Three inexpensive and commonly available household
products — white vinegar, baking soda, and bleach —
can replace a variety of store-bought cleaners.
Many people also use ammonia as a cleaning staple. If
you do as well, remember that ammonia combined with
bleach or some other cleaning agents produces a toxic,
or even deadly, gas. Never never never mix ammonia with
any other cleaning product. For that matter, never mix
any household cleaners, regardless of brand or type.
All cleaners, whether commercial or homemade, work
best when left to sit for varying periods of time.
Generally, the tougher the stain, the longer you let it sit
to work.

White Vinegar
Full-strength white vinegar is an excellent cleaning option
that kills many germs, bacteria, and molds. Keep a spray
bottle of full-strength vinegar around the house, and
spray it on countertops, toilet seats, doorknobs, and
even cutting boards. Vinegar helps deodorize, and you
can use it in your wash and get the same results as store-
bought detergent additives.
Here are a few easy ideas for cleaning around the house
with vinegar:
 Use full- or half-strength vinegar for cleaning win-
dows, mirrors, chrome, and tile. (Wash your win-
dows with newspapers to cut down on the lint left
behind from cloth or paper towels.)
 To easily clean the microwave oven, heat 1⁄2 cup of
white vinegar in a microwave-safe bowl or mug on
high for 3 minutes. Let the vinegar sit undisturbed
for about 15 minutes, and then remove the vinegar
container and wipe down the inside of the
microwave with a sponge and clear water.
 Use full-strength vinegar in the rinse-aid container of
your dishwasher.
 Use about 1 cup of white vinegar and 1⁄4 cup of
baking soda (in addition to your laundry detergent)
in place of store-bought bleaching products to
whiten and brighten your clothes.
 Add 1⁄2 cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle or
pour it into the washing machine’s fabric softener
container to remove any leftover soap residue from
the clothes. The clothes will smell clean and fresh.

Baking Soda
You can find bulk containers of baking soda in the baking
supplies aisle of the supermarket. Baking soda is fairly
inexpensive normally, but when you buy it in bulk, it’s
really a bargain. Baking soda works well for the following
cleaning needs:
 Mix a 50/50 paste of baking soda and water for
scrubbing bathtubs, tile, sinks, chrome, and pots
and pans. Rinse thoroughly with water.
 Add about 1 teaspoon of baking soda to 1 cup of
water, stir, and use in a spray bottle with a fine mist
setting for an easy and inexpensive air freshener to
spray around the room.
 Sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda in the bottom of
the cat’s litter box (before adding the kitty litter) to
help cut the smell. Fluffy will thank you, and this can
also prevent the need to buy more expensive
deodorized kitty litter.
 Add about 1⁄4 cup of baking soda to the washing
machine’s rinse cycle as a fabric softener and odor
remover.
 Use a paste made from a mix of 50/50 baking soda
and water to pretreat spots before putting the
clothes in the wash.
Bleach
When it comes to killing germs and removing household
mildew, you won’t find a less expensive disinfectant and
cleaning agent than common household bleach. Here are
some simple cleaning ideas that use bleach:
Make Your Own Cleaning Solutions 211

 Use a 50/50 mixture of bleach and water to remove
stubborn stains and mildew from tile and grout.
 Pour a 50/50 bleach-and-water mix into tea cups or
coffee mugs with difficult stains. Allow them to soak
overnight. The next day, pour out the bleach and
water and wash the cup as usual.
 Mix 1 cup of bleach with 1 gallon of water for gen-
eral cleaning and disinfecting, but be careful not to
let the bleach mixture touch fabrics or anything that
can have color bleached out of it (such as carpets,
window treatments, clothing, and so on).

Spend less on lighting
After appliances and heating, indoor and outdoor lighting is one of the
biggest electricity users in an average home. Cut down on the number of
light bulbs turned on at any one time to save substantially on your elec-
tric bills. Here are some easy tips for lighting-related savings:
 If you have outdoor lighting for safety reasons, install motion detec-
tors on the lights. They’ll still come on when you need to see your
way or if an intruder needs to be scared away.
 Replace frequently used light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs. They’re
a bit more expensive to buy, but they often last up to ten times longer
than incandescent bulbs.

Replace a Roof Shingle
B
ecause shingles become more flexible when warm,
this task is best saved for a sunny day. Here’s all
you have to do:
1. Fold back the shingle(s) above the one to be
removed.
2. Use a flat pry bar to remove the nails that hold
the damaged shingle in place.
3. Slip a new shingle in position to replace the one
that was removed.
4. Nail the new shingle in place by using a flat pry
bar as a hammer extension.
With this technique you can drive a nail in from
beneath an overlapping shingle: First, press the
nail into the shingle by hand. After the nail is in
place, position the bottom of the flat bar so the
straight end rests atop the nail head. As the
hammer strikes the flat bar, the offset below
drives the nail home.

Find Roof Leaks
The first step in repairing a roof leak is finding its point of
origin. Although finding a leak on a flat roof can be
extremely difficult and should be left to an industry pro-
fessional, do-it-yourselfers can find a leak on a pitched
roof. To water test your roof, you need two people, one
on the roof and one in the attic (or living space below if
you don’t have an attic). You also need the following
tools:
 1 ladder
 1 garden hose
 1 flashlight
Although water testing a pitched roof isn’t a difficult
process, it can be time-consuming and tedious, so be
patient. Follow these steps:
1. Station your partner in the attic and tell him or
her to holler at the first sign of water.
2. Use the garden hose to run a modest amount of
water over the roof at a point below the area
where a leak is suspected.
Work from the lowest point of the roof (near the
eaves or gutters) in an area about 4 to 6 feet
wide. Work your way up the roof a couple of feet
at a time. Stand on dry roofing above the water to
help prevent a slip.

Don’t run the hose full blast. Don’t use a spray
nozzle, and don’t force the water between the
shingles. Doing so may force water into the
home, creating the illusion that you’ve found a
leak when, in fact, you did nothing more than
temporarily create one.
3. The moment your helper sees water, he or she
should let you know.
A wailing screech usually does the trick. Or use
your cellphones to communicate without yelling.
After you find the leak, hire a contractor to repair it.

Add More Insulation
M
ost home-maintenance projects save you money
over time. But only a few of them produce an
immediate and measurable return. Maintaining an energy-
efficient home is one such project, and one of the best
ways to do this is to make sure everything’s properly
insulated.
Attic Insulation
If you have loose fill insulation, look to see whether the
insulation in your attic has shifted. If some areas of your
ceiling are bare, solve the problem by using a plastic lawn
rake to gently move the insulation from high spots onto
the bald areas. (Be sure to use a plastic rake; with electri-
cal wires present in the attic, it wouldn’t be wise to use a
metal rake.) You can also use a piece of batt insulation to
cover a hole. Simply use a razor knife to cut batt insula-
tion to the approximate length required and lay it in
place.
If your insulation appears to be in good shape, but you
still feel a chill, you may need to add more. Check with
your local public utility or a local building inspector for
advice on what to do.

Keep attic insulation clear of light fixtures. If the light
boxes are covered with insulation, they can overheat, and
a fire can result. And above all, don’t plug attic vents. An
attic must be able to breathe; otherwise, trapped hot air
can convert even the best insulated home into a sweat-
box on a hot summer day. In addition, a buildup of
humidity can occur, which over time can result in wood
rot, mildew, mold, and fungus growth.
Wall Insulation
Adding insulation to a wall is a bit more difficult than
adding it to an attic. In an attic, the insulation is usually
exposed. In a wall, the insulation resides between the
interior and exterior wall coverings. To insulate a wall,
you have to either remove the wall covering or create
small penetrations and blow the insulation into the wall
cavity. It’s simply not cost-effective to remove a wall cov-
ering to insulate the wall cavity. Therefore, blown insula-
tion is usually used to insulate the walls of a completed
home.
Because wall studs are spaced every 16 inches or so, pen-
etrations to add insulation must be made at the same
intervals, thus filling one cavity at a time. In some homes,
a horizontal block exists midway between the top and
bottom of a wall cavity. In such cases, two penetrations
must be made into each cavity: one above the horizontal
block and one below it.
Floor Insulation
An insulated floor substantially reduces the loss of heat,
helps to eliminate mildew- and rot-causing condensation,
Add More Insulation 217

and generally helps to keep your toes warm when you go
barefoot through the kitchen.
Periodically crawl beneath your home with a flashlight to
check the condition of the floor insulation in your base-
ment or sub-area. You want to ensure that it’s properly
positioned. Sagging is the biggest problem. Floor insula-
tion is normally held in place (between the floor joist)
with netting or bailing wire attached from one joist-
bottom to another. If the insulation netting sags, reattach
or replace it.
Lightning rods (named for their speedy installation) are a
handy alternative to netting or bailing wire when main-
taining sagging floor insulation. These lightweight, flexi-
ble steel rods hold the insulation in place by spring
tension. You place one end of the rod against the side of a
floor joist and bend it slightly so the other end is forced
into place against the face of the opposite joist. Use one
hand to hold the insulation up and the other hand to
whip the lightning rod into place.

Insulate Pipes
P
utting insulation around all accessible water pipes
saves energy, prevents freezing during most moder-
ate to medium chills, and reduces condensation when
pipes flow through attics and crawlspaces.
Properly maintained pipe insulation can be cheap insur-
ance. A pipe that bursts in the attic can destroy a sub-
stantial portion of your home before the leak is stopped.
Be sure the tape that holds the insulation in place is in
good shape, and make sure the insulation is still in good
condition, as well. If either the insulation or the tape
crumbles to the touch, the material should be replaced.
Pre-formed, tubular, foam pipe insulation is slit length-
wise for easy installation. All you have to do is open the
slit and lay the insulation onto the pipe. Pipe insulation
comes in 6-foot lengths and is easy to cut with scissors or
a razor knife.

220
#85
Insulate Heat Ducts
A
s with other kinds of insulation, the material that
surrounds your heat ducts reduces energy costs
while improving the effectiveness of your central heating
and cooling system. It also helps prevent unwanted con-
densation in attics and crawlspaces, thereby reducing the
chance for mold, mildew, and the foul odors associated
with them.
Wrap insulation around and around the duct in a
corkscrew fashion. Air currents, rodents, house move-
ment, and vibration in the heating system can cause the
insulation to loosen and fall away from the ducting. While
you’re there, add an extra layer if your budget allows. It
can’t hurt.
You can hold insulation together by “stitching” a nail into
it. Simply insert the nail the same way a seamstress uses
a sewing pin to hold two pieces of fabric together.

221
#86
Test and Fix a 
Window Air Leak
A
ir leaks mean excessive energy loss — and cost.
Summer or winter, you don’t want your house to
leak air, especially when you spend your hard-earned dol-
lars warming or cooling it.
Test a window for leaks by holding a lighted candle near
all its joints and connections. If the candle flickers, you
have an air leak. Check
 Where one section of the window meets another
 Where the windows meet the frame
 Where the frame meets the wall
To fix air leaks, try these tactics:
 Caulk around the window: Often air leaks at a
window result from a breakdown in the connection
between the frame of the window and the frame of
the house. To prevent leaks, caulk the window
where its frame meets the exterior siding. If the
window is surrounded by wood trim, seal all gaps
between the trim and the siding (and the trim and
the window frame) with a high-grade polyurethane
caulk.

 Replace the weatherstripping: Leaks occur when
weatherstripping wears out. You may have to
remove the operable portion of the window to find
the weatherstripping. Most home centers sell
replacement weatherstripping in peel-and-stick rolls.
If you aren’t sure about what to do, take the section
you removed to the store with you, or snap a picture
of the area that needs attention and take it with you.
A picture is definitely worth a thousand words!
 Inject foam sealant between the frame of the
window and the frame of the house. This is a major
deterrent to air infiltration and also prevents water
from leaking into the house.
Part IV: Living a Recession-Busting Life 
222

223
#87
Stop Air Leaks around Doors
A
n air leak in a door frame is pretty common. As the
moisture content changes in soil, your home shifts.
Your doors also shift, creating gaps large enough for a
dump truck to pass through.
You can add foam sealant between the frame of the door
and the frame of the house by removing the interior door
casing. The casing is the wood trim that covers the joint
between the door frame and the wall. Use a flat pry bar to
slowly remove the trim so you don’t damage it.
Other air leaks can occur between the door and the door
frame. This is where weatherstripping is handy. It doesn’t
make any difference whether the exterior door is painted
or stained, large or small, solid wood or French style, the
same type of weatherstripping can be used.
An easy-to-find and -install weatherstripping consists of a
rubber bead attached lengthwise to a strip of metal.
Standing outside the door, with the door in the closed
position, gently press the rubber portion of the weather-
stripping against the door and frame at the same time.
Attach the metal section of the weatherstripping to the
door frame with the nails or screws provided. Here,
oblong holes allow the weatherstripping to be adjusted
later as house movement causes the door to shift.

Identify Plumbing Leaks
W
ater leaks can be expensive, not only for the
damage they cause (think rot and mildew), but
also because you’re stuck paying for the leaking water,
even if, as is the case with some leaks, you don’t know
you have one.
If you’re on a public water system, you have a water
meter somewhere on or near your property. Besides
telling you how much water you’re using, it can also help
you detect leaks.
Take a meter reading, and then turn off every plumbing
fixture in your house (including the built-in icemaker or
other water-consuming appliances) for a couple of hours.
After everything is off, take another meter reading. If the
reading changes, you have a leak. You can tell how much
water you’ve used in any given timeframe by subtracting
the first reading from the second reading. A cubic foot
contains 71⁄2 gallons of water.
If you find a leak, you need to identify where it’s coming
from and fix it or call a professional to help out.

225
#89
Improve Water Heater
Efficiency
I
f your water heater is located in a garage or basement,
or you don’t want the heat the water heater emits into
the area, install a heavy insulation blanket — R-11 or
better. Doing so improves the water heater’s energy effi-
ciency and reduces the ambient heat. The R value relates
to the thickness of the blanket; the higher the R value,
the thicker the blanket, and the more insulating 
horsepower.
You can purchase a water heater insulation blanket as a
kit based on the size of the heater — 30, 40, 50 gallons,
and so on. The kit contains a blanket that has white vinyl
on the outside and raw insulation on the inside and
enough adhesive tape to finish the seams.
If you have a gas water heater, wrap the blanket all the
way around and from the top to just below the controller.
Don’t worry if the blanket seems a bit short. Remember,
the bottom of the tank is several inches above the very
bottom of the water heater.
Don’t wrap the top, because the insulation could catch
fire from the heat being exhausted. Also, the blanket

shouldn’t cover the controller, the anode, or the pressure
and temperature relief valve.
If you have an electric water heater, wrap the sides and
the top (an electric water heater doesn’t have an
exhaust). But don’t cover the access panels for elements;
otherwise, these could overheat.
You don’t need a blanket if your water heater is located
where its lost heat can be felt and appreciated. Nor do
you need one if you have a new water heater that’s fac-
tory insulated with R-16 or better. The manufacturer’s
label will tell you how much insulation your water heater
contains (the factory-installed insulation is located
between the metal shell and the tank, so don’t freak if you
can’t see it).

Help Your Furnace Work 
More Efficiently
T
he best way to ensure that your heating system is as
energy efficient as it can be is to do routine mainte-
nance. (If you have an electric system, it requires virtu-
ally no maintenance. In fact, you have to do only two
things: Vacuum the convectors once a month [if you have
them] and pay the electricity bill.)
Routine annual inspection and cleaning by a qualified,
licensed contractor can keep your system running for
many years without trouble. Don’t be pennywise and
pound-foolish. A dirty, inefficient furnace costs you ten
times that much in wasted fuel. Beyond that, you can do
the following:
 For forced-air systems: Replace the furnace filter
regularly (every month during the heating season,
and every month year round if an air-conditioning
system is part of the same system) and check the
ducts, which distribute warmed air to various loca-
tions throughout the house, for leaks. If you see fuzz
or feel warm air coming out through the joints
between duct segments, seal them with metal tape.
Although filters cost only a couple of bucks apiece,
don’t buy filters one at a time — get a whole case.
They’re cheaper by the dozen.

 For hot-water systems: Most hot-water systems
have only a single gauge, which measures three
things: pressure, temperature, and altitude (the
height of the water in the system). It’s important to
monitor the pressure. Most boilers run with only 12
to 15 pounds of pressure. The boiler can become
seriously damaged and even dangerous if the pres-
sure exceeds 30 pounds. If the pressure is abnor-
mally high, you may have a waterlogged expansion
tank that can be drained. You can drain the expan-
sion tank yourself (use the owner’s manual for infor-
mation or a home-maintenance book for guidance)
or call a repairperson.
You also may need to bleed the air out of the radiator.
To do so, just turn the bleed valve about a quarter-
turn counterclockwise and keep the screwdriver or
radiator key in the valve. If you hear a hissing
sound, that’s good — it’s air escaping. As soon as
the hissing stops and you see a dribble of water
come out, close the valve.
Don’t open the valve more than is necessary; hot
water will come rushing out before you can close it.
At the very least, you’ll make a wet mess. At the
very worst, you could be scalded.
 For steam systems: Most adjustments to your steam
boiler should be performed by a pro. But you can do
three important things yourself:
• Check the steam gauge on a regular basis.
Make sure it’s within the normal range. If it
isn’t, shut the system down immediately and
call for service.
Part IV: Living a Recession-Busting Life 
228

• Check the safety valve every month. Located
on the top of the boiler, this valve vents
excess pressure if the boiler goes crazy and
exceeds safe levels. When the system is hot,
push down on the handle to see whether
steam comes out. Make sure to stand away
from the outlet — the steam is boiling hot. If
no steam comes out, call a serviceman to
replace the valve immediately.
• Check the water level once a month. The
water-level gauge has valves on each side.
Open them both and make sure the water level
is in the middle, and then close the valves. If
you don’t see any water, shut off the boiler, let
it cool down, and add water.

Save on Your Fuel Expenses
R
educing your speed is one way to save on fuel.
Getting a car with better gas mileage is another.
While anyone can do the former, you’re probably not
going to seriously consider doing the latter unless you’re
in the market for a new car anyway. Regardless of the car
you have, you can do several things to maximize your
fuel efficiency.
Look under the Hood
You may be surprised at all the “little” things that can
negatively affect your gas mileage:
 A dirty air filter can cause you to lose 1 mile per
gallon at 50 miles per hour.
 A poorly functioning PCV valve, which recycles the
exhaust fumes back into the intake manifold to be
re-burned, makes your engine run less efficiently.
 Spark plugs that misfire can cost you up to 25 per-
cent in gas mileage.
 Accessory belts (those that connect your fan, water
pump, alternator, and a variety of other devices)
that are too loose or too tight can result in a serious
loss of efficiency.

 A poorly adjusted brake may “drag” while the vehicle
is in motion. The result is that your brake linings —
and the gas in your tank — won’t last as long.
Take a look at these parts of your vehicle and make sure
that they’re in good condition and are functioning prop-
erly. A simple tuneup can reduce carbon monoxide and
hydrocarbon exhaust emissions by 30 to 50 percent, save
you fuel, and improve your vehicle’s performance. If you
can cut your fuel consumption by only 10 percent, you
save an average of 77 gallons a year!
Fill ’Er Up
What you do at the pump affects your fuel consumption
and can save you money as well.
In hot weather, fill up in the early morning or evening,
when the air is cooler. Like everything else, gasoline
expands with heat. An increase of 30 degrees can cause
10 gallons of gas to expand by as much as four-fifths of a
quart — that’s as much as a bottle of whiskey!

Change Your Own Car Oil
C
hanging oil is easy. In fact, unless your oil filter
and/or oil drain plug is impossible to reach, you
have good reasons to change your oil and oil filter your-
self. It’s cheaper, you know that the job’s being done
right, and it requires little time or effort.
You’ll need these supplies: oil and an oil filter (make sure
it’s the right one for your car), an adjustable wrench (to
unscrew the oil drain plug), a container to catch the oil
(make sure it’s low enough to fit under your car), a
funnel, and some rags.
Follow these easy steps:
1. Warm up your engine for 2 or 3 minutes so the
gook gets churned up and can flow out of the
engine easily.
You don’t want the engine so hot that you burn
yourself. When it’s slightly warm, shut off the
engine.
2. Look under your car to find the drain plug.
The drain plug is a large nut or plug located
under the oil pan at the bottom of the engine. If
you can’t reach your oil drain plug easily, you’ll

have to either crawl under your car to reach it or
jack up the car.
3. Push the container under the oil drain plug so it
can catch the oil.
4. Protecting your hand with a rag or some paper
towels, unscrew the oil drain plug (be ready to
move your hand out of the way).
The oil now drains out of your engine into the
container. While the oil drains, get out from
under the car and take a look under the hood.
5. Remove the cap from the oil filler hole at the
top of your engine and unscrew the oil filter,
using a wrench if you can’t do it by hand.
The oil filter looks like a tin can screwed to the
side of your engine. To unscrew it, twist it coun-
terclockwise. The filter will have oil in it, so be
careful not to spill it when you remove it. If any
remnants of the filter’s rubber seal remain on
your engine, remove them.
On some vehicles, you can easily reach the oil
filter by leaning under the hood. Other car manu-
facturers place the filter so it must be reached
from under the car. If this describes your vehicle,
you’ll have to get under it.
6. Empty the oil from the filter into the drain pan.
After the filter is empty, wrap it in newspaper and
set it aside to take to a recycling center with your
old oil.
7. While the old oil drains out of the engine, open
a new bottle of oil.
Change Your Own Car Oil 233

8. Dip a finger in the new oil and moisten the
gasket on the top of the new oil filter. Then
screw the new filter into the engine where the
old one was.
Follow directions on the filter, or turn it gently
until it “seats” and then give it another three-
quarter turn.
Unless the filter manufacturer recommends it, or
your hand can’t fit in the space, don’t use an oil
filter wrench to tighten the filter. It should fit
tightly, but you don’t want to crush the gasket, or
the filter will leak.
9. Reach under the car again and use your dirty
rag to wipe around the place where the oil
drain plug goes.
10. Replace the oil drain plug and use an adjustable
wrench to tighten it.
If your vehicle uses an oil drain plug gasket, make
sure the old one has been removed and lay a new
gasket on the pan before you replace the plug.
11. After you install the oil filter and replace the oil
drain plug, use a funnel to pour all but 1 quart
of the fresh oil into the oil filler hole.
12. Replace the oil filler cap and run the engine for
30 to 60 seconds while you check for leaks from
the oil drain plug and around the filter.
The oil pressure light on your dashboard should
go out in 10 or 15 seconds (or if your car has an
oil pressure gauge, the needle should move off
“Low”). Your oil pressure is low to zero while the
light is on, until your oil filter fills up. If the light
doesn’t go out, check under the car and around
the engine for leaks. Running the engine circu-

234

lates oil into the new filter, and because filters
hold a half to a full quart of oil, you want to be
sure that your filter is full to get an accurate read-
ing on the oil dipstick.
13. Shut off the engine and wait 5 to 10 minutes for
the oil to settle into the oil pan and then check
the oil level again.
Remove the oil dipstick, wipe it with a clean, lint-
free rag, and shove it back in. Pull it out again and
check it. Keep adding oil a little at a time and
checking the stick until you reach the “Full” line
on the dipstick.
14. Remove the drain pan from under the vehicle
and give the car a test drive.
Go around the block a couple of times; then let
the oil settle down again and recheck the dipstick
and the dashboard indicator.
15. Fill out the Maintenance Record at the back of
your Owner’s Manual (or wherever you keep
track of your regular auto maintenance).
Dispose of the old oil by taking it to an auto parts store or
other oil recycling center.

Take Care of Your Tires
T
ires don’t require a great deal of maintenance, but the
jobs in this section will pay off handsomely by
increasing your tires’ longevity, handling, and perform-
ance, as well as providing you with a more comfortable
ride and better gas mileage.
Check Tire Pressure
The single most important factor in caring for your tires
is maintaining the correct inflation pressure. You should
check your tires once a month and before every long trip
to see that they’re properly inflated. Underinflated tires
wear out faster, create excessive heat, increase fuel con-
sumption, and make the vehicle harder to handle.
Overinflated tires can blow out more easily, wear out
faster, and make the vehicle unstable and unsafe to
handle.
To check the air pressure, you need to buy a tire pressure
gauge at a hardware store or auto supply store (they’re
not expensive) and determine the proper air pressure for
your tires. Look for the proper inflation pressure on the

tire decal. You can find the tire decal on one of the doors,
door pillars, glove box, console, or trunk.
Then follow these steps:
1. Remove the little cap from the tire valve that
sticks out of your tire near the wheel rim.
2. Place the open, rounded end of the tire gauge
against the valve so that the little pin in the
gauge contacts the pin in the valve.
3. Press the gauge against the valve stem.
You’ll hear a hissing sound as air starts to escape
from the tire. You’ll also see a little stick emerge
from the other end of the tire gauge. It emerges
partway almost as soon as the air starts to hiss
and stops emerging almost immediately.
4. Without pushing the stick back in, remove the
gauge from the tire valve.
5. Without touching the stick, look at the numbers
on it. Pay attention to the last number showing.
This number is the amount of air pressure in your
tire.
6. Add air if necessary.
If the number on the gauge is lower than the rec-
ommended pressure, you need to add air. Follow
the steps in “Add Air to Your Tires.”
7. Repeat these steps for each tire, including the
spare.
Take Care of Your Tires 237

Add Air to Your Tires
If your tires appear to be low, note the amount that
they’re underinflated, drive to a local gas station, and
follow these steps:
1. Park your vehicle so you can reach all four tires
with the air hose.
2. Remove the cap from the tire valve on the first
tire.
3. Use your tire gauge to check the air pressure in
the tire and see how much it’s changed so you
can add the same amount of air that the tire
lacked before you drove it to the station.
The pressure will have increased because driving
causes the tires to heat up and the air inside
them to expand.
4. Use the air hose to add air in short bursts,
checking the pressure each time with your tire
gauge and making adjustments as necessary.
If you add too much air, let some out by pressing
the pin on the tire valve with the back of the air
hose nozzle or with the little knob on the back of
the rounded end of the tire gauge.

Hire a Pro without Getting
Taken for a Ride
S
everal kinds of shops repair and service vehicles:
dealerships, chain stores, specialists, and independ-
ents. Dealerships usually stock a wide variety of original
parts and equipment made specifically for your vehicle,
but they’re often more expensive than other types of
service facilities. Save money by choosing another
option. But how do you decide which is the right shop for
you? Each has its drawbacks as well as its advantages.
 Chain and department stores: These are generally
less expensive than dealerships. They usually stock
a wide variety of parts, and provide guarantees on
parts and labor. Many also accept coupon and dis-
count mailers from competitors. The downside is
that the technicians may get a commission on the
parts they sell, motivating them to sell you a new
part instead of repairing an old one.
 Independents: Many independent shops are less
expensive than dealerships. The best independents
offer honest, reliable, and experienced independent
mechanics who provide personalized service based
on high standards of excellence. An unreliable one
patches things together, uses cheap parts, and
hopes for the best.

 Specialists: There are two types of specialists: A
specialized chain store or independent mechanic
who deals with a specific type of repair, such as
brakes, transmissions, or mufflers, or an independ-
ent shop that works only on specific makes or types
of vehicles, such as imports, motorcycles, or vans.
Check out national chains in consumer publications
such as Consumer Reports to be sure that the one
you choose has a good reputation for durable parts
and quality service.
Several organizations test, rate, and certify good service
facilities or individual technicians. If you’re unsure about
a particular shop, look for a sign or a patch on a techni-
cian’s uniform showing that the shop or the individual
has achieved recognition from one of the following
sources:
 AAA- and CAA-approved repair facilities:
Approved by both the American Automobile
Association (AAA) and the Canadian Automobile
Association (CAA).
 ASE-certified technicians: The National Institute for
Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) certifies tech-
nicians by testing them on a variety of automobile
repair specialties.
 IGO (Independent Garage Owners Association): An
IGO shield or sign indicates that the owner of the
garage is a member of the IGO, which, although it
doesn’t qualify individual technicians, has a code of
ethics that members pledge to live up to if they want
to stay in the organization.
 Better Business Bureau: Check with your local
Better Business Bureau to see whether a shop has
been the subject of numerous consumer complaints.
Part IV: Living a Recession-Busting Life 
240

 Referrals: Probably the best way to find a good
mechanic is the same way you find a doctor, lawyer,
or plumber — through referrals. Ask people who
drive the same make vehicle as you do where they
go for repairs, and then check out the shops. As a
fringe benefit of these conversations, you’ll also
know which shops to avoid.

H
olidays and special events are times to 
celebrate and enjoy. They’re also times
when your budget and bank account can take a 
real hit. Fortunately, you don’t have to do without;
you just have to do a little differently. The key is to
figure out what’s most important and to put your
resources and energy there. If you figure out what’s
nonnegotiable — spending quality time with your
family or giving from the heart rather than the
wallet, for example — you may just discover that
although you spend less, you give more.

Throw a Party on a Budget
P
lanning a party can be just as fun as attending one.
And when your planning lets you save money at the
same time, well, that’s icing on the cake. The simplest
and most important trick is to plan ahead and put
together a party budget.
When you budget for your party, do so before you start
shopping. List the items you need and estimate what you
can afford to spend on each item. Keep a running total of
the expenses so you know when you need to cut corners
on one item because you went over on another.
Check out the following budget-saving ideas:
 Always shop from a detailed list. Impulse buys are
common in party planning. Those corn-shaped corn-
cob holders would be a hit at the barbecue, but are
they necessary?
 Use reuseable tableware. Using real dishes, uten-
sils, and glassware can save big money.
 Prepare the food yourself. Bake your own cake or
serve sliced homemade snack cakes instead of
ordering a personalized cake from the grocery store.
 Make and deliver your own invitations. Save on
postage by hand-delivering invitations to people you
see regularly. E-mail invitations are acceptable for
casual parties.

 Aim for a simple, balanced menu. For a dinner
party, a simple snack or appetizer, salad or soup,
vegetables, and a main course followed by a simple
dessert make a nice, well-rounded meal.
The key to entertaining on a budget without sacrificing
flair is to think presentation. You can make anything look
special: a tray of cold cuts on a bed of curly lettuce, uten-
sils standing in a cup tied in ribbon, napkins folded into
birds. And for those extra special occasions when you
want to splurge a little without breaking the bank? A
standing rib roast is a wower, but so is a crown roast —
and it’s less than half the cost.

Entertain on a Shoestring
D
o you want to socialize with friends and family while
spending as little money as possible? Keep in mind
that the real focus of the party is the guests — good food
is just an added bonus! Here are a few ideas that are
proven winners.
Covered-Dish Dinners
Hosts provide the main course, and guests bring side
dishes and desserts. The benefits of this type of gather-
ing are that no one has too much work or cost to absorb
and everyone gets to try lots of new and varied dishes.
Bring the kids and hire one babysitter or older child to sit
or entertain the children in the basement (or in a sepa-
rate part of the house), and the adults can visit or play
cards upstairs or in the living room.
Wine-Tasting Party
This type of get-together can be an educational and fun
experience (and not to mention thrifty). Here’s how it
works: The host’s responsibilities are to invite friends or
family, lay out the rules, and provide glasses, crackers,
fruit, and cheese for all. Then guests each bring a bottle

of wine. The host predetermines the rules, such as the
following: Bring red wine, $10 per bottle maximum, with
bottles disguised in paper bags. After all the guests have
arrived, randomly number the bags, open the wine bot-
tles, and begin the tasting. Discuss the characteristics
and qualities of each wine and vote on your favorite while
enjoying your cheese, fruit, and crackers and the company
of your friends. At the end, unveil the winning selection.
Game Night
Invite two to four people over after dinner to play Farkel
(a dice game of skill and luck; all you need are six dice
and the instructions, which you can find online) or
another game of your choice.

Spend Less on Holiday
Decorations and Gifts
You can have festive holiday celebrations without
dipping into savings or running up a credit card bal-
ance. Use these ideas to jump-start your creativity and
see where your imagination takes you!
Easter
Ahh, Easter: warm spring weather, newborn bunnies, and
freshly cut tulips. If only those store-bought springtime
goodies, like Easter baskets for the kids and decorations
for the home, weren’t so expensive. But with a little cre-
ativity, you can enjoy the season frugally.
For instance, you can make your own inexpensive Easter
baskets. Use wicker baskets, which last year after year, or
be creative with your choice of container. Paper bags,
Easter bonnets, and colorful plastic sand pails are all
great options. Fill your bags or baskets with treats that
you accumulate throughout the year — crayons, bubbles,
chopsticks, stickers, and little cookies and candies.

Halloween
Halloween costumes don’t have to scare the living day-
lights out of your budget. Even a simple homemade gypsy
or hobo costume can be loads of frightening fun, espe-
cially if the children design it themselves. Make the fol-
lowing inexpensive costumes from things found around
the house or at thrift stores:
 Ghost: Use a permanent marker to draw some
details on a sheet, like spider webs or fake blood-
stains. If you add an old chain or two and tie a large
white handkerchief around the top of the child’s
head and under his jaw, you’ve created Jacob
Marley from Dickens’s A Christmas Carol.
 Tacky Tourist: Just put together a Hawaiian shirt,
sunglasses, a hat, a camera, white sunblock on the
nose (just use white face paint), a large bag or
purse, and maps or tourist brochures peeking out of
a few pockets.
 Ladybug: Dress your child in a pair of black leggings
and a plain long-sleeved black shirt. Remove the
arms from a large red sweatshirt (bought at a thrift
store) and pin, glue, or draw large black dots all
over and a stripe down the middle of the sweatshirt.
Fashion antennae with black pipe cleaners.
Shop off-season to get the best deals. Halloween decora-
tions are cheaper right after Halloween; limit yourself to
one or two new items at the end of the season and store
them with your current decorations.

Hanukkah and Christmas
Holiday giving and frugal living don’t have to be polar
opposites if you follow these easy ideas:
 Create homemade wrapping paper. Make your own
wrapping paper out of brown paper grocery bags,
inexpensive kitchen sponges (the softer, the better),
and craft paint. Cut open the paper bags and spread
them flat, with the plain insides of the bags facing up.
Cut the sponges into simple holiday shapes (snow-
men, trees, stars), dip them into red, green, or white
paint, and then sponge-paint randomly over the open
paper bags. Tied with inexpensive brown twine, this
makes a rustic and beautiful gift-wrapping idea —
plus it’s a fun holiday family activity, too.
Newspaper comics also make bright, fun wrapping
paper.
 Find post-holiday deals. If you like the variety and
sparkle of store-bought paper, shop for it after the
holidays, when it’s half off or more.
 Limit the number of decorations. A few strategi-
cally placed decorations can have a dramatic effect.
A seasonal decoration on the front door, a tree in
the living room, a centerpiece on the dining table,
and a few fragrant candles around the house can set
the mood just as well as animated Santas dancing in
every window.
 Save on gifts. Set a limit on how much to spend on
each person you’re buying for. Shop early. Shop
online. Purchase gifts on clearance throughout the
year. If you buy gifts for extended family members,
agree to a spending limit, buy a single family gift
rather than individual gifts, or trade names.

Get Creative with Gift Giving
G
iving to others is definitely wonderful, but is going
to the store and paying top dollar for household
clutter really the answer? Probably not. Here are some
gift ideas to help you think creatively:
 A personalized calendar: Creating a personalized
calendar can be as simple as buying a store-bought
calendar and writing important family days to
remember throughout the year, such as birthdays,
anniversaries, and so on. Or buy a blank calendar at
the rubber stamp store and decorate the entire calen-
dar yourself. Add the important family dates to the
calendar, and then when the year’s over, the recipient
can cut off the calendar section and keep the scrap-
book pages together as a memory book. Instead of
photos or artwork at the top of each calendar page,
how about using a simple layout design with favorite
family recipes, quotations, and so forth?
 Favorite family recipes: Many families pass down
favorite recipes almost like treasured family heir-
looms. Request that family members send you a
couple of their favorite recipes and maybe even a sen-
tence or two about each recipe, its history or origin,
any traditions surrounding the recipe, or even funny
family stories. Then put together your own cookbook
or have the booklets professionally copied and
bound (which is still relatively inexpensive).

 Coffee mug or tea cup with a tasty treat: Include a
selection of small bags of coffee mix or favorite coffee
beans, spiced cider mix, a selection of gourmet teas,
a pretty silver-plated spoon found at a thrift store, or
other favorite tea time or coffee break treats. Wrap it
all in cellophane and tie with a pretty ribbon.
 A box of loving memories: Save small souvenirs
(theater tickets, seashells, matchbooks with restau-
rant logos, and so on) from previous dates or activi-
ties you shared with your loved one. Put them into a
special gift box on an anniversary or a “just
because” day. For the friend or relative far from
home, this can make an especially meaningful gift.
 Cotton scraps for your favorite seamstress: Small
pieces of colorful fabric can be used in a variety of cre-
ative ways, so if you have a sewing or quilting fanatic
in your circle of friends, keep your eyes open while
you’re at garage sales for cotton shirts, sheets, and
pillowcases in nice patterns or plain colors. Pick
scraps in colors that blend well together. Cut out large
squares of useable material from the backs and fronts
of the shirts, fold the material into neat squares, and
then tie a ribbon around the stack of colorful scraps.
 A dress-up bin: Stock up on inexpensive dress-up
clothes and accessories: prom dresses, hats, shawls,
scarves, cowboy paraphernalia, costumes, surgical
attire, costume jewelry, men’s suit jackets, clip-on
ties, and fancy shoes. (Go through your own closets
or get them at garage sales and thrift stores.) Old
lace tablecloths and curtains make perfect wedding
veils. Plastic bins with lids work well for storage, but
even just a big cardboard box covered with wrap-
ping paper can work for this much-appreciated gift.
 A gift basket for the whole family: A large popcorn
bowl full of microwave popcorn packages, candy,
and movie rental gift cards is a great idea.
Get Creative with Gift Giving 253

 Time, donations, and services: Instead of buying
more items to clutter up family’s and friends’
homes, many people give alternative gifts that are
more in keeping with their personal priorities and
the spirit of each season. Some alternative gift ideas
include making a donation of time, energy, and
resources to a charity in your friend’s name and put-
ting together a homemade coupon book of personal-
ized jobs you’ll do for the recipient: Mow the lawn,
give a back rub, take him shopping, and so on.

Great gift-basket ideas
Gift basket are one-of-a-kind presents that speak louder than words. Be
serious. Be silly. Be inventive. But above all, have fun. Here are gift
basket themes to get your creative juices flowing:
 Guys’ Night: Almonds and a DVD of football’s greatest bloopers
 Midnight Icebox Raid: Snacks stashed in an old cookie jar from a
flea market or garage sale
 Sunday Brunch: Traditional brunch foods, Bloody Mary mix, and the
Sunday paper
 Gay Paree: Pâté, a French-translation dictionary, and an Edith 
Piaff CD
 Right-O: Scones, a teapot, a selection of teas, and a book of 
Keats’s odes
 Home on the Range: Barbecue sauce, a flameproof barbecue mitt,
and a set of steak knives
 Girls’ Night Out: Chocolate truffles, a video of Love Story, and a box
of tissues

Give and Package 
Sweets and Treats
Homemade gifts send the message that you care enough
to take the time to make something with your own two
hands. Anyone would enjoy homemade gifts from the
kitchen any time of year — whether you have a reason
for giving or not. Give them to celebrate holidays, to
mark birthdays and anniversaries, to spread cheer to
someone who’s not well, or for no reason at all.
Put just as much care into the way you package your gift
as you do into making it in the first place. Keep a few con-
tainers, bags, or wraps on hand. They’re convenient for
spontaneous gift giving, so try to get in the habit of look-
ing for these things when you’re shopping. Consider the
following a guided tour of places to look. You never know
what unusual packaging you may be the first to discover.
 Craft stores: Roam the aisles and you’re sure to dis-
cover all sorts of boxes, ribbon, baskets, papers,
pipe cleaners, crepe paper, twine, raffia, twisties,
and doodads.
 Super discount stores: Check out the toy depart-
ment and see what’s available in the way of buckets
and such. The card departments carry cute little
shopping bags. Housewares departments have nap-
kins, mugs, and canisters.

 Gourmet food shops: These shops probably have
the traditional food containers, including the fancier
decorative bottles and French canning jars. These
items are great if they fit within your budget.
 Party goods stores: Seasonal ideas are usually avail-
able in party goods stores. Wrapping paper, ribbon,
tissue paper, and colorful napkins are standard
items.
 Flea markets and related places: Flea markets,
antique stores, garage sales, and tag sales are great
sources for potential containers and wrapping
items. Beautiful old glass, baskets, advertising con-
tainers, linens, bowls, teacups, wine glasses, molds,
and crockery are all there for the creating.
 Your own house: Home is where the heart is, and
it’s also the starting point for finding recyclables.
Reuse unusual glass water bottles (some water com-
panies use colored bottles) by adding a cork and
sealing it with paraffin. Reuse pretty tins left over
from commercial cookies. Cut up old greeting cards
and use them for tags or appliqués.
 Fabric and notions stores: Go here if you want to
wrap your gift in cloth, whether it’s topping a jam jar
with a square of gingham or wrapping the whole
present in a fabric bundle through the Japanese art
of furoshiki.
 Stationery and card stores: They always have the
usual wrapping paper, tissue, and cards, but more
and more stores are expanding their lines to carry
little tote bags and tins.
 Garden centers and florists: Garden shops carry all
sorts of containers in varying shapes nowadays,
including pots and baskets. Many garden stores also
carry patio tableware in all shapes, colors, and
sizes.

 Hardware stores: Look in the paint department for
disposable cardboard paint buckets. Empty reusable
metal paint buckets are another option. In the
plumbing department, buy a short section of PVC
pipe to fill with individually wrapped candies or
cookies and then wrap it in stiff fabric or paper like
a gigantic party popper.
Everything food comes in contact with should be food
safe. If you’re not sure, wrap the gift in food wrap first.

Fun food-as-gift facts
Here are a few random thoughts to keep in mind about giving food as
gifts:
 Keep the recipient’s tastes and preferences in mind, especially if
you’re including a reusable container. For example, even if you don’t
really like contemporary decor, if the recipient does, choose a con-
tainer appropriate for her tastes, not yours.
 The container in which you give the gift isn’t always the best con-
tainer in which to store the food. Don’t forget to mention this fact to
the recipient.
 Date and label food gifts. Tell the recipient how long a gift will last.
If you suspect that anyone has a food allergy or if you want to be on
the safe side, give a list of ingredients. At the very least, identify
whether the gift contains nuts.
 Keep perishable gifts refrigerated until the last minute before giving.
Make sure the recipient knows the gift is perishable.

Save on Fine Dining
D
inner out in a nice restaurant doesn’t have to
become a vaguely remembered activity. By follow-
ing some simple suggestions, families and couples can
enjoy an occasional dinner out for a small price tag.
 Avoid overpriced drinks. A simple cup of coffee can
cost at least $2, and sodas, milk, and juice for the
kids are usually more than that. Drinking water can
often cut $10 or more from the cost of a typical
family’s meal. To make the water special, ask for a
lemon or lime wedge.
If the nicer drinks are essential to your dining expe-
rience, forego the mixed drinks; they’re usually
more expensive than a glass of wine or a beer. Also,
many nicer restaurants allow you to bring wine.
They generally charge an uncorking fee, but that’s
significantly less expensive than buying your wine
from them.
 Fill up on appetizers or share a meal. Appetizers
are generally less expensive, just as yummy, and
nice to linger over, and you can buy two or more for
the price you’d spend on a meal. And given portion
sizes today, one meal can often easily feed two
people, so share. Even if you have to pay a small fee,
it’s still less expensive.

 Be aware of suggestive sales. Keep in mind when
ordering in a restaurant that anything extra or sug-
gested by the waiter is going to add to your bill. If
you really want ice cream on your slice of pie, fine.
But if you’re only saying yes because what the wait-
ress suggested suddenly sounds delicious, you’ve
succumbed to suggestive sales. Keep your radar
alert when someone starts suggesting additional
things to eat or drink.
 Choose your dining time wisely. Many restaurants
have reduced-rate menus on certain days or during
particular hours.
 Keep your eye out for advertisements and
coupons. You can often find these in the weekly
advertising circulars that come in the mail and the
newspaper. Many places offer half-price appetizers.
Or you may find an ad for buy-one-get-one-free
dinner specials. Some restaurants even advertise
free meals for kids during certain hours or on partic-
ular days of the week. Also, always ask for the
restaurant’s special of the day. It’s often $2 to $5
cheaper than the rest of the main menu items.

In this part . . .

n a time when prices keep going up and incomes
seem to keep going down, making ends meet
can be more challenging than ever. Let a crisis

for example — and the situation just gets worse.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed with debt or are
facing the real possibility of losing your home or
having to declare bankruptcy, this part is for you.

Look for Signs of Financial
Trouble
A
lthough money problems often seem to strike with-
out warning, they usually give off some indicators
that you’re headed for trouble. You and your partner (if
you have one) should remain on the lookout for warning
signs and work together to build a strong financial foun-
dation that can protect you from foreclosure. Here are
some red flags:
 An unbalanced budget: You should have at least as
much money coming in as is flowing out each
month. If you have a partner, the two of you should
agree, upfront, on how much to spend and what to
spend it on.
 Unpaid bills: If you’ve missed more than one mort-
gage payment, you’re most likely confronting seri-
ous financial difficulties — and you’re closer to
major calamity than you may realize.
When bills arrive, prioritize them and pay them as
soon as possible so they don’t stack up.

 Unregulated spending: If you end up surprised by
how quickly your money disappears or frequently
think you have a bill covered only to discover that
the money is gone, chances are you’re not keeping
track of what you’re spending money on. The situa-
tion can be exacerbated if you have a partner. If
you’re both off spending money on your own pet
luxuries, problems often arise.
 Spending too much on debt: If more than 20 per-
cent of your monthly take-home income goes toward
paying off debt, not including your mortgage or rent,
you may be ready for some professional help.
 Inability to make minimum payments: If you can
barely afford to make minimum payments, chances
are you can’t afford to save — and that puts you at
risk for ending up deeper in debt from unexpected
illness, car problems, or temporary unemployment.
 Arguing with your partner about finances: Fighting
about money is going to happen at one time or
another, but ongoing and unresolved arguing related
to how bills get paid, who’s responsible for rising
debt, and so on is a sign that finances are a source of
stress in your relationship. Money-related disputes
are the number-one cause of divorce in the U.S.
 Being refused credit: Something must be seriously
wrong if a creditor isn’t willing to extend credit,
even at an extremely high interest rate.
 Writing bad checks: Writing bad checks by mistake
means you’ve lost control of your checking account.
You need to take immediate steps to remedy the 
situation.
Part VI: Staying Afloat If the Boat Starts to Sink
264

 Getting calls from multiple creditors: If you fall
behind on one bill, chances are you can handle it
yourself. As the number of creditors calling you for
late payments grows, the problem becomes expo-
nentially more complex.
 Addictive behavior: Any addiction can be a prob-
lem, including alcohol, drugs, or the Internet.
Anything that takes time, energy, and resources
away from a paying job and your family (if you’re
supporting a family) can cause financial problems.
Identify addictions early and nip them in the bud.

Understand the Cost 
of Bad Credit
T
he extra interest you have to pay is only the tip of the
bad-credit iceberg. The real cost of bad credit is in
reduced opportunities, family stress, and having to asso-
ciate with lenders who see you as a mark. This section
fills you in on some of the unpleasant consequences of
bad credit.
 Fees: Creditors may add fees, such as late fees, over-
limit fees, legal fees, repo fees, penalty fees, defi-
ciency payments, and default rates, to your balance.
As bad as the fees can be on your credit cards, they
can be even worse on your secured loans. If you fall
behind in your house payment three months, you
can be hit with huge fees to the tune of thousands of
dollars.
 Higher interest rates: The lower your credit score,
the higher the interest rate you have to pay; the
higher your score, the lower the interest rate.
Making matters worse, the policy of universal default
says that if you have an issue with one lender, all
your lenders can hike your rates as well, even
though you’re still paying the others on time and as

agreed. Some companies even use a deteriorated
credit score as reason to escalate your rates to the
penalty level.
 Less than favorable loan rates: Shopping around for
the best lender becomes even more important when
your credit score isn’t as attractive as it could be.
Lenders may say yes to a loan but at a higher cost.
In a time of tight credit, you may not qualify for a
loan at all.
 Lost employment opportunities: Increasingly, credit
checks are a standard part of the hiring and even
the promotion process at companies large and small
throughout the United States. Businesses reason
that the way you handle your finances is a reflection
of your behavior in other areas of your life.
 Higher insurance premiums: A strong correlation
exists between bad credit and reported insurance
claims. Insurance companies run a credit check
when determining your premium. What this means
is that bad credit costs you a bundle in insurance-
premium increases and may result in your insurance
being denied.

Get Copies of Your Credit
Report and Scores
T
hree main sources of credit information dominate the
credit industry today: Equifax, Experian, and
TransUnion. These credit bureaus are basically huge
databases of information from lenders, bill collectors,
courts, public utilities, and others who provide goods
and services to you today and get paid down the road.
Credit-reporting bureaus don’t put data in your file; they
simply maintain the files that others put the data into.
A credit score is an additional component used in most
credit reviews. When lenders order your credit report,
they also order your credit score. A credit score summa-
rizes your risk of default in a three-digit score that ranges
from 300 to 850.
Get Your Credit Report
Check each of your credit reports at least annually. The
information changes fairly frequently, and the different
reports contain slightly different information.
Fortunately, every American is entitled to one free credit
report from each of the three bureaus per year. To get
your reports, phone, write, or go to the Web site of each
credit bureau:

 Equifax: P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374; phone
800-685-1111; Web site www.equifax.com
 Experian: P.O. Box 2104, Allen, TX 75013-2104;
phone 888-397-3742; Web site www.experian.com
 TransUnion: 2 Baldwin Place, P.O. Box 1000, 
Chester, PA 19022; phone 800-888-4213; Web site
www.transunion.com
Alternatively, you can go to a central source to get all
three reports:

P.O. Box 105281
Atlanta, GA 30348-5281
Phone 877-322-8228
Web site www.annualcreditreport.com
Get Your Credit Score
You have to request and pay for a copy of your credit
score. Not just any credit score will do. You want your
FICO score, which is the credit score lenders use. You can
get your FICO credit score from only two places:
 myFICO: Phone 800-319-4433; Web site
www.myfico.com
 Equifax: P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374; phone
800-685-1111; Web site www.equifax.com
The other credit-reporting bureaus — Experian and
TransUnion — offer credit scores but not the FICO credit
score. If you want your FICO score in addition to an
Experian or TransUnion credit report, you need to pay for
a report and score package from myFICO.

Check Your Credit Report
W
hen you have your credit report (see Tip #103,
“Get Copies of Your Credit Report and Scores”),
you’re poised to take the necessary steps to clean up the
information that’s there — removing outdated or inaccu-
rate details, adding positive information, and even
increasing your credit score. By doing all this, you can
put yourself in a better position to receive credit and
earn the most attractive interest rates when you do
borrow. Here’s what you should look for in particular:
 Make sure your name is spelled correctly and your
Social Security number is correct. With all the data
moving through the financial reporting system, a Jr.
or a Sr. can easily drop out or confusion over a II or
III designation can occur.
 Check to see which of your accounts show up on
your credit report. Remember that your credit
report may not show all your accounts, because
creditors are only required to supply information to
one of the three major credit bureaus.
 Look to see whether accounts are showing the
activity they ought to. If you see accounts that are
familiar but activity that isn’t — such as a late-
payment notation when you’re certain you’ve never
been late — report that error to the credit bureau.

Also, if you see accounts you don’t recognize, it may
be a simple mix-up or something more serious, like
identity theft. Again, call the bureau and find out.
 Look for accounts from a bank or store with which
you’ve never done business. This info may have
been added to your credit report because of a mis-
spelled name or incorrect Social Security number.
 Identify which accounts are showing negative
activity. Negative activity can include things like
missed or late payments.
 Look for any overdraft protection lines of credit.
These lines of credit often outlive the account
they’re protecting. Closing these lines of credit can
be helpful if you have a lot of credit available.
 Check out all the addresses the reports list for
you. Incorrect addresses can lead to incorrect 
information.

Dispute Inaccurate Info on
Your Credit Report
You can’t legally remove accurate and timely informa-
tion from your credit report — whether it’s good or
bad. But the law does allow you to request an investiga-
tion of any information in your file that you believe is out
of date, inaccurate, or incomplete. You won’t be charged
for this investigation, and you can do it yourself at little
or no cost.
Credit bureaus have made the process for disputing and
correcting inaccurate information as easy as possible.
Your role is to check your reports at least once a year
and, if you see information that looks unfamiliar or
wrong, file a dispute.
Any financial institution that submits negative informa-
tion about you to a national credit-reporting agency has
to tell you so. This gives you a heads-up to jump on
errors earlier than you could under the old laws.
Each of the three credit bureaus has slightly different pro-
cedures for consumers to file disputes, but all three allow
you to dispute by phone, online, or by mail:

 Equifax: Call 800-685-1111, and be sure to have your
10-digit credit-report confirmation number (on your
report) available. You can also dispute by mail at
Equifax Information Services LLC, P.O. Box 740256,
Atlanta, GA 30374 (no confirmation number is
required on written correspondence) or online at
www.equifax.com.
 Experian: You can dispute by phone at 888-397-3742;
online at www.experian.com; or by mail at P.O. Box
2104, Allen, TX 75013-2104.
 TransUnion: You can dispute any information by
phone at 800-916-8800; online at www.transunion.
com; or by mail at TransUnion Consumer Solutions,
P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000 (be sure to
include your TransUnion file number, available on
your TransUnion credit report).
Here’s what happens when you dispute information: After
the bureau receives a dispute, it contacts the source that
provided the data. That source has 30 days in which to
respond. If the source can’t verify the data within the
time allowed, the information must be removed from
your report. If, on the other hand, the information is veri-
fied, it stays on your report. In either case, you’re notified
in writing of any actions that occur as a result of your dis-
pute. If you disagree with the findings, you can ask how
the investigation was conducted and who was contacted,
as well as add a statement to your report saying why you
disagree.
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), both the
credit bureau and the organization that provided the
information to the credit bureau — such as a bank or
credit-card company — have responsibilities for correct-
ing inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit
report.
Dispute Inaccurate Info on Your Credit Report 273

If you’re unhappy with the results of your dispute and
think you’ve been treated unfairly or haven’t been taken
seriously, contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
The FTC works to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and
unfair business practices in the marketplace and to pro-
vide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid
them. To file a complaint or to get free information on
consumer issues, visit www.ftc.gov or call 877-382-4357
(TTY 866-653-4261).

Be assertive
Being assertive means not giving up until you resolve an issue. It means
asking pointed, relevant questions and then asking follow-up questions
until you’re sure you understand what’s going on or the issue has been
resolved. It means that you follow up on everything and you push the
envelope of your comfort level, and the comfort level of the people with
whom you’re dealing. If your lender’s representative tells you that she’ll
get back with you in a couple days and she doesn’t, call her back and
politely say that you haven’t heard anything and wanted to follow up.
Explain to her that you want to get this matter worked out and behind
you, and you don’t want to miss any deadlines or cutoff dates.

275
#106
Add Positive Info to Your
Credit Report
T
he best way to get positive information inserted into
your credit report is to make payments to your credi-
tors on time and in the full amount each month. Do so for
a year or more, and you’ll have made great strides in
improving your credit history and your credit score. You
can also add some information to your credit report.
Consider doing the following:
 Requesting that your good accounts be added to
your report if they aren’t already showing up
 Adding a 100-word statement to explain certain
information, such as late payments
 Opening new types of credit accounts, such as an
installment account if you have only credit cards
Be careful when using this tactic to improve your
credit score. You can do more harm than good. If
you open an account with a large amount of avail-
able credit, it’s likely to push your available credit
over the limit of what’s acceptable by lenders.

276
#107
Bring Credit Card Debt 
Under Control
T
he first thing to do when you need to get your credit
card debt under control is to look over each of your
credit-card statements each month. You may be sur-
prised to find charges on your account that aren’t yours,
or you may not have realized just how much you’re
charging each month. If you see anything you’re unsure
about or that’s incorrect on any part of your credit-card
statement, call the credit-card company immediately and
resolve the issue. The following sections outline other
ways to regain control over your use of credit cards.
Stop Solicitations
By limiting or eliminating credit-card and loan offers,
you’ll be less apt to apply for this “easy” credit. One way
to minimize the number of solicitations you receive from
would-be lenders is to get your name added to no-call or
no-solicitation lists. Eliminating these solicitations also
reduces the number of opportunities identity thieves
have to establish credit in your name — and saves a few
trees.

 Call 888-5OP-TOUT (888-567-8688) to have your
name removed from the marketing lists that are sold
by credit bureaus to potential lenders.
 Write the Direct Marketing Association to be
removed from its direct mail and phone lists. Be
sure to write a letter to each of the following:
• Mail Preference Service, P.O. Box 643, Carmel,
NY 10512
• Telephone Preference Service, P.O. Box 1559,
Carmel, NY 10512
 Contact the Direct Marketing Association online and
request that your information be removed from its
mail, telephone, and e-mail marketing databases:
Mailing lists: www.dmachoice.org/MPS/
proto1.php
Phone lists: www.the-dma.org/cgi/
offtelephonedave
E-mail lists: www.dmachoice.org/EMPS
 Register for the National Do Not Call list at
www.donotcall.gov or by calling 888-382-1222.
Registering your name with no-call or no-solicit lists 
doesn’t in any way affect your ability to borrow money.
Cut the Cards
Identifying the problem is the first step to digging out of
debt. The second step is often difficult for hard-core
credit card junkies: cut up your credit cards. Yep, pull out
the scissors and start snipping.
Bring Credit Card Debt Under Control 277

Some credit providers can’t officially close the account
until you pay in full, but do not, under any circumstances,
use a credit card until you pay your debts in full. If you’re
deeply in debt, paying it off can take several years. But
after you’re out from under the burden of excessive debt,
the relief you experience more than makes up for the
inconvenience of going without credit for a long stretch
of time.
Sometimes you need a credit card of some sort for
making airline reservations, buying online, or renting a
car. If so, get a check card from your bank.

Take Credit Solutions into
Your Own Hands
B
y being proactive and acting quickly, you can solve
some credit problems on your own. Other prob-
lems, because of their magnitude or what you risk losing,
require the help of a competent credit counselor (see Tip
#109, “Seek Help for Credit Problems” for details on the
latter).
The credit situations outlined here are ones that you can
probably resolve without much help. If you go it alone, be
sure that you identify the cause of the problem and
resolve it, know how much money you have to work with,
and act quickly.
Missing a Month’s Payment 
on a Credit Card
If you can’t make this month’s payment or if you’ve
missed a month’s payment already on your credit card,
be proactive. As long as you know what you can afford,
and you don’t mind explaining your situation over
the phone, you can get quick results. Call the toll-free
customer-service number and tell the rep who you are,

what happened, and how you want to handle it. If you
need a break from having to make payments, say so. If
you can make up the missed payments over the next
month or two, make an offer (just make sure your offer
is something you can make good on).
Usually, if you’re proactive and contact credit-card compa-
nies before they contact you, you establish yourself as a
good customer who needs and deserves special considera-
tion — much better than an elusive customer who’s behind
in payments, doesn’t call, and may be a collection risk.
You may be asked to do more than you think you can. Do
not agree to anything you don’t think you can deliver.
Saying that something isn’t possible, and explaining why,
is much better than caving in but not being able to follow
through. Ask to talk to a supervisor — he or she has
more authority to bend the rules.
Missing a Mortgage Payment 
or Paying Late
If you’re within the grace period allowed in your loan doc-
uments, just send the money in if it will make up the
shortfall. If you’re past the grace period, you have vary-
ing amounts of time to make up the deficit, depending on
the state you live in. Suppose you’re behind on your
monthly payment of $1,000. If you can send only $500
extra with the next month’s $1,000 payment, you’ll still be
short $500, right? Wrong. You may be behind the full
$2,000 if the bank doesn’t accept either payment because
you didn’t catch up in full. If you aren’t far behind and
you can catch up in one shot, do it. Otherwise, get help
from a credit-counseling agency.

Deferring Student Loans
Getting a short-term waiver on student loan payments
isn’t difficult if you have a good reason. Unemployment, a
low-paying job, illness, a return to school — each of these
reasons may qualify you for a short-term waiver, but only
if you give the lender a call before you get into a default
situation. The student-loan people are usually very forgiv-
ing as long as they think you’re playing it straight with
them.

Seek Help for These 
Credit Problems
C
ertain situations create more financial stress than
others. Credit counseling can help with the three
main categories of problems that can wreak the most
havoc:
 Multiple bill collectors: Most people can handle 
one or two collectors. But when you get to five, ten,
or even more, you’re pulled in many directions at
once by their conflicting demands. It takes only 
one unreasonable creditor to make your situation
impossible.
 Joint credit problems: Credit problems are exacer-
bated when you share them with someone who
doesn’t see things the way you do. Compromising is
hard enough in good times; in stressful situations,
finding solutions agreeable to everyone can be
much more difficult.
 Debts that are backed by assets: If you take out a
loan to buy a car, your loan is secured by that car. If
you take out a loan to buy a house, your loan is
secured by the house. In other words, security is
what you stand to lose if you don’t or can’t pay back
the money you borrowed. As a general rule, the

more security lenders have, the less willing they are
to work with you to solve what’s clearly “your prob-
lem.” It’s easier than most people think to lose these
assets if you’re not making payments. If you can’t
come up with the entire deficit quickly, get help
before things snowball.

Work with a Credit
Counseling Agency
A
credit-counseling agency serves as an objective
party to help you sort through your problems, see
your situation through the eyes of professional, give you
some credit education, offer personalized budgeting
advice, and design a customized plan to get you out of
debt — all for nothing or next to nothing.
A credit-counseling agency analyzes your sources of
income and your expenses. The agency will
 Detail what you owe.
 Give you an organized picture of your financial 
situation.
 Provide options that match your resources, lifestyle,
and goals.
 Tell you the steps you need to take to reach those
goals.
Whether you first contact a credit-counseling agency by
phone, e-mail, or in person, the counselor asks you why
you’re there, what you want to accomplish at the meet-
ing, and what your short-term and long-term goals are.

Then some fairly detailed data-gathering takes place.
You’re asked about your income sources and tax deduc-
tions, as well as your monthly expenses. Having a good
idea about what your monthly expenses are helps, but it
isn’t a requirement — if you don’t know, the credit coun-
selor can help you estimate them. A quick subtraction of
expenses from income tells you how much you have
available for monthly debt service, if any. The counselor
will suggest ways to adjust your expenses or income, to
get you to a positive cash-flow position (in which more
money is coming into your household than is going out).
Next, you and the counselor go over all the debts you
have to pay. The positive cash flow from the earlier calcu-
lation is applied to the amount you have to pay. If any-
thing is left over, you’re basically done — you leave with
an action plan and a budget you can follow to keep your
expenses in line with your income. If the result is negative
(you have more expenses than you have income), you
and your counselor rework the expenses to free up cash
flow and he or she tells you what your debt service
would be under a debt-management plan.
This process of reducing your expenses and increasing
your income continues until you and the counselor get to
a positive cash flow or it becomes apparent that, no
matter what you do, the numbers just don’t work in your
favor. If you can’t get to a positive cash flow, the coun-
selor refers you to an attorney or other community
resources for additional help.
Alas, there is no magic wand to make all your financial
problems disappear, but a good certified credit counselor
always offers solutions. Expect more than one solution,
and expect some solutions you don’t like. Your counselor
will give you a balanced perspective of what you need to
do, how long it will take, and what resources are available
Work with a Credit Counseling Agency 285

to help you along the way. Your counselor will probably
discuss bankruptcy, as well as other solutions. The key:
The counselor proposes solutions not just in the light of
your current situation, but also in light of your future
needs.
Beware of services that overcharge and underserve the
credit-impaired, offering a product based on technology
rather than public-service, mission-oriented values. If
you’re already up to your eyeballs in debt, avoid these
debt mills like the plague! You need the maximum help
for the minimum cost and you won’t find it with them.

Create a 
Debt-Management Plan
I
f you’re in debt crisis or you’re concerned you may be
getting close to it, a debt-management plan from a
good credit-counseling agency may be just the solution.
For a small monthly fee the agency handles both commu-
nications and payments on your behalf, and it includes
revised payments that:
 Are acceptable to all your creditors
 Leave you enough money to handle your living
expenses
 Generally get you out of debt in two to five years
When creditors realize that you can’t meet the original
terms of your credit cards or other loan agreements, they
also realize that they’re better off working with you
through your credit counselor. Under a debt-management
plan, your creditors are likely to be open to a number of
solutions that are to your advantage. These solutions
include:
 Stretching out your payments so that the combina-
tion of principal (the amount you originally bor-
rowed) and interest will pay off your balance in 60
months or less

 Changing your monthly payments to an amount you
can afford to pay
 Reducing your interest rate and/or any fees associ-
ated with your loan
 Stopping creditors from hounding you day and night
Sounds like a good deal: lower interest rates, smaller pay-
ments, and all. Well, the debt-management plan isn’t a
free lunch. The minuses may include the following:
 A possible negative impact on your credit report
(although just being in a debt-management plan
doesn’t affect your FICO score)
 An increase in interest rates (unless you pay in full
and through the credit-counseling agency you origi-
nally signed up with)
 Restricted access to credit during the term of the
plan
 Difficulty in changing credit-counseling agencies
after you begin a debt-management plan

Talk to Creditors to 
Work Out a Solution
F
or many people, communication isn’t easy. Compound
this apparently widespread communication disability
with emotion, guilt, and maybe even some anger, and you
have a recipe for conflict and communication breakdown.
Yet this is the very situation that thousands of people
find themselves in when they’re trying to put a stop to
their credit crises. People just like you pick up the phone,
call their creditors, and find themselves in a yelling
match with a representative who seems to have the sensi-
tivity of a robot.
Is resolution possible here? Yes — if you do your home-
work, offer a solution, follow through with what you
promise, and follow these steps:
1. Contact your creditor promptly.
2. Explain your situation.
Here are some elements you want to communi-
cate (using a phone conversation as an example):
• Begin the conversation on a positive note.
• Get the person’s name.

• Briefly (in a couple minutes or so) explain
your circumstances.
• Stick to the facts.
3. Offer a solution.
Whatever your proposed plan, be sure to cover
these bases:
• Offer an estimate of how long you realisti-
cally need to rectify the situation.
• Propose a specific payment figure and plan
that you can manage.
4. Cover all the bases.
After you agree to terms, ask the creditor to mail
or e-mail a letter with the new agreement to you;
after all, you want to avoid any misunderstand-
ing. If this letter doesn’t seem to be forthcoming
from your contact, or if you don’t receive written
documentation of the new terms in a few days,
follow up with the creditor in writing.

Negotiate a Payback
Arrangement with Collectors
S
uppose you get a call or a letter claiming you have a
past-due financial obligation. Even if you’re sure you
owe the money, asking for details — which account, what
the bill was for, the age of the debt, when the statement
was mailed to you — never hurts. Why? For two good 
reasons:
 The collector may be wrong.
 You may be the victim of a scam.
When you and the collector are in agreement that all the
particulars of the debt are legitimate, it’s time for you to
make an offer to resolve the obligation — whether the
cause of the delinquency was an unintended error or
unfortunate circumstance.
You want to convey your concern and reassure the col-
lector that you’re sincere in your commitment. But that
doesn’t mean you shouldn’t negotiate for an arrangement
that favors you. As you’re discussing the repayment
terms, think of some concessions you want to have. For
example, you may want the creditor to

 Keep it from the credit bureaus
 Waive late fees
 Give you a lower interest rate
If you’re 90 days or more past due, you’re on thinner ice
because you’re more seriously late and three months of
fees will probably be in the $100 vicinity. You may just ask
for bureau-reporting forgiveness (that costs the creditor
nothing). If, on the other hand, your situation is such that
you can’t pay back the money right now, you may not
have a leg to stand on when it comes to asking for favors.
You may just have to set your sights on a reasonable
repayment plan that you can live with.
If you’re under extreme financial duress, go a step further
and ask whether the creditor has a hardship program.
You may have to meet some qualifications, but if you do,
you could see your interest rate drop dramatically, per-
haps even to zero, and have your payments lowered for
six months to a year.

Avoid Credit-Repair Scams
C
redit-repair companies can’t do anything legitimate
that you can’t do for yourself. Some are shady, some
aren’t, but you have to be on the lookout for scams. Run
for cover whenever a credit-repair company
 Tries to loan you money
 Plans to sell your name to other lenders
 Boasts that it can remove truthful information from
your credit reports
Sometimes advisors suggest that you apply for credit by
using a Social Security number similar to but slightly dif-
ferent from your real number, hoping that instead of
matching this fake number with an existing file, the credit
bureau will create a new one. Taking this step is both ille-
gal and stupid.

Keep Credit Under Control
While Unemployed
Your credit-report experience tends to follow your
personal financial experience, so you can do a few
things to protect your credit while you’re unemployed.
Use Credit during Unemployment
When you find yourself unemployed, if you’ve estab-
lished savings (regardless of the amount) and you have
some available credit lines, you have two tools that will
help you get through this time without damaging your
credit. By using a combination of credit and cash, you
can put together a new plan that includes finding that
new job and implementing a budget that works while you
do so.
Stay away from cash advances! Spending money this way
costs more than using a credit card. Using your credit
card to buy a $10 item may seem silly, but it’s better for
you than using a $10 cash advance. Cash advances come
with an extra fee, often have a higher interest rate, and
often have a maximum lower than your credit limit.

Look at credit differently
When you’re unemployed, use credit for basic living and
job-hunting expenses, preserving your cash for as long as
possible by using credit first. This advice is just about the
opposite of what most people tell you. But when you use
credit for these expenses, you do so for a limited period
of time and for a specific, worthy purpose. Think of it as
borrowing money for a surefire investment: your future.
Keep your overall spending to essentials by closely fol-
lowing a budget (see the next section).
Refigure the family budget
To keep your spending in line with your reduced
resources, discuss the situation and the need to tem-
porarily reduce expenses with your family. Don’t be
embarrassed in front of the kids. This situation is an
important lesson in reality, and you can show them how
adults face difficult issues and win.
If your severance is being paid out over time or if you
haven’t yet received it, ask your employer or human
resources department to raise your deductions to the
maximum allowed: ten. (Don’t ask for more than ten,
because the IRS wants a report of anyone with more than
ten deductions.) This strategy results in more cash now,
when you need it.
Yes, you may owe some taxes on this money in April
(though your job-hunting expenses and reduced earnings
for the year may offset that). You want to maximize
today’s income at the possible expense of tomorrow’s
demands.
Keep Credit Under Control While Unemployed 295

Protect Your Credit Lines
The downside to using credit for basic living expenses (a
sound strategy during unemployment) is that you may do
some damage to your credit. Here are some tips for pro-
tecting your status while leveraging your available credit
to get through this challenging time:
 Keep balances at less than 50 percent of your
available credit. Spread your credit use over sev-
eral accounts to keep your balance on each card at
less than 50 percent. Rather than having, say, a
$2,000 balance on one card and a $0 balance on
three cards, spread the amount over four cards —
with each balance at $500.
 Make all payments on time. Thirty-five percent of
your credit score has to do with whether you make
payments on time.
 Pay your mortgage first. Not all bills are created
equal — and your mortgage is the most unequal of
them all. If you can afford to pay only one bill, pay
this one. Partial payments don’t work, and falling
behind 90 days begins a difficult-to-stop foreclosure
process.

Use Home Equity to
Consolidate Debts
I
f you have credit card debt, a second mortgage, or
other loans in addition to your first mortgage, debt
consolidation can take a chunk out of your monthly
expenses, freeing up money to cover other bills.
Discover Debt-Consolidation
Options
Consider exploring the following options for consolidat-
ing debt:
 Refinance your mortgage.
 Take out a home equity loan.
 Take out a home equity line of credit.
When you’re already having trouble paying your bills,
you may have damaged credit, which makes obtaining
the loan you need to consolidate your debt that much
more difficult. If that’s the case, look at other means of
consolidating, like getting one of these types of loans:

 An unsecured loan allows you to pay off the old debt
and make one monthly payment to the bank.
 A secured loan requires that you put up some form
of collateral so the bank has something it can take
from you and sell to cover the debt.
Which is best — a secured or unsecured loan? That
depends on your situation. Discuss your options with a
qualified loan officer or mortgage broker in your area.
When you borrow money, read and fully understand the
documents before signing them. Know what the provi-
sions are, when payments are due, what happens to sur-
plus funds if collateral is sold for more than is required to
pay off the loan, and so on. Have an attorney review the
document and advise you of any potential issues before
you sign.
Compare the Costs of Loans
Consolidating debt with a loan you pay too much for isn’t
a smart move when your goal is to lower payments and
reduce what you owe. You can select from hundreds of
loan types, but the bottom line is how much the loan
costs in the long run. The best way to compare loans is to
determine the total cost of each loan over the life of the
loan:
1. Add up the fees charged to process the loan,
including the loan origination fee, points, and
closing costs.
2. Multiply the monthly payment by the number
of months it will take you to pay off the loan in
full.
Part VI: Staying Afloat If the Boat Starts to Sink
298

3. Add the amounts from Steps 1 and 2 to deter-
mine the total cost of the loan.
4. Subtract the total amount you expect to pay
toward principal over the life of the loan.
Ask the bank for an amortization worksheet for
each loan to see how much principal you’ll have
paid at the time you expect to sell the house and
pay off the loan.
The result is the total cost of the loan. Simply choose the
loan that costs the least over the life of the loan.

Take Control When
Foreclosure Looms
A
s soon as you begin to sense that your financial situ-
ation has taken a turn for the worse, you and the
rest of your household need to work together to keep the
problem from getting worse. Picture yourself in a boat
that’s taking on water. Before you start bailing out the
water, find the holes and plug them.
Freeze Your Finances
When foreclosure strikes, the first order of business is to
get a handle on your finances. Do whatever possible to
keep more cash flowing in than flowing out — boost
income with overtime or a second job, slash unnecessary
expenses, and sock away as much money as possible. If
you have children, trimming the fat is more stressful,
because you may fall into the trap of thinking you’re
depriving your children or letting them down. Keep in
mind that the one thing your kids want and need most is
you, not the stuff you buy them. These ideas can get you
started:

 Instead of ordering Chinese and renting videos, cook
a meal and have a family game night.
 Put off that trip to the salon for a manicure, pedi-
cure, facial, or hair appointment. Do it yourself.
 Scale back on this year’s vacation; take day trips
and pack a picnic lunch.
 Instead of treating your friends and family to dinner,
invite them over for a pitch-in.
What you do with added income and savings depends on
your strategy. If you’re committed to saving your home,
set aside the extra cash for reinstating the mortgage or
working out a payment plan with the bank. If saving your
home is a lost cause, you may decide to squirrel away as
much money as possible during the redemption period
so that you have a sufficient nest egg to take with you
when you move.
Prioritize Your Bills
Part of the process of stabilizing your current situation is
prioritizing your bills. So when you’re facing foreclosure,
pay your bills in this order:
 Property taxes
 Secured debts
 Homeowner’s insurance
 Utility and grocery bills
 Unsecured debts
Take Control When Foreclosure Looms 301

Know Who to Contact
Your most valuable assets in foreclosure are people who
can assist you, so draw up a list of people you can lean
on. Your list may include the following:
 Friends and relatives
 Bank representative
 Real estate agent (Note: Selling the home is often
the best option in foreclosure cases.)
 Register of deeds
 Sheriff
 Bankruptcy attorney
 Foreclosure attorney
Gather Important Documents
Before you get too far into the foreclosure fight, gather
important documents and other materials you’ll be called
upon to deliver at some point in the process. The most
important of these legal documents:
 Mortgage, deed of trust (if you purchased your
home through a bank), or contract for deed (if the
seller provided financing
 Modifications to the mortgage or promissory note
 Deed
 Correspondence
 Notice of default
Part VI: Staying Afloat If the Boat Starts to Sink
302

 Sheriff’s or trustee’s deed
 Canceled checks
 Bank statements
 Listing agreement
 Current appraisal
 Phone logs
 Other stuff (Keep anything else you think may be
relevant. Having more than you need is better than
needing something later and not having it.)
If you can’t find a copy of your deed or mortgage or any-
thing else that’s part of the public record, schedule a trip
to your local county building; you can usually obtain
copies of most documents by paying a small per-page
copy fee.

Draft a Plan of Attack to
Offset Foreclosure
I
f you’re facing possible foreclosure, you need a plan.
Are you going to try to save your home? Do you want
to sell it to get out from under the burden? Does it make
sense to simply live in the home as long as possible and
then bail out before the sheriff comes to evict you?
Following are some options:
 Filing for bankruptcy: This is a costly option.
Consult with a reputable bankruptcy attorney in
your area before making any final decisions.
 Reinstating your mortgage: If you think you’ll be
unable to pay off the loan in addition to making your
mortgage payments, reinstatement may not be the
ideal solution for you.
 Arranging for a redemption
 Haggling for a forbearance: A forbearance agreement
is similar to reinstating, but you don’t have to pay a
lump sum all at once.
 Negotiating a mortgage modification

 Refinancing your home with another lender: Be
wary of shady loan originators who may try to take
advantage of you by selling you a loan (one with a
very high interest rate or an adjustable-rate mort-
gage [ARM] with a low teaser rate that’s likely to
rise suddenly) that’ll put you in worse shape
months or years down the road.
 Living off your home with a reverse mortgage.
 Selling the house
 Deeding the house to your bank in lieu of foreclo-
sure: When offering a deed in lieu of foreclosure,
make sure the bank provides you with a formal
release of all obligations for repaying the debt.
Otherwise, the bank may be able to file for a defi-
ciency judgment if the house sells for less than what
you owe on it; you’re then responsible for paying
the difference.
 Selling the house to an investor
 Moving out and leaving the keys
When you serve your country in the military, you’re eligi-
ble for a few well-deserved perks, including mortgage
payment relief and foreclosure protection. The
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) of 2003 (formerly
the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act of 1940) provides
this protection for eligible service members. For more
information, go to www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/
nsc/qasscra1.cfm.
In deciding how to proceed, weigh your options rationally:
1. Lay all options on the table, no matter how
unrealistic they may seem right now.
Draft a Plan of Attack to Offset Foreclosure 305

2. Arrange the options in order, from the ones
that sound most attractive to the ones that
sound least attractive.
3. Move to the bottom any options that are likely
to land you back in the same place you are now
(or worse).
4. Get on the same page as your spouse or partner.
The execution of your plan will be most effective
if you present a unified front. You both need to
get with the program, agree not to fight (too
much), and join forces to develop a solid plan
and put it into action.
In a slow market, the lender may be more amenable to
working with you. After all, the bank stands to lose if
nobody in the area can afford its mortgage payments. If
the lender is smart, it’ll try to work out a solution that
enables you to stay in your home and eventually start
making payments again.

Understand Types 
of Bankruptcy
I
f you’re filing for bankruptcy, your basic choice is
between a bankruptcy that doesn’t involve any type of
repayment plan (Chapter 7 bankruptcy) and one that
does (Chapter 13). Base your decision on what’s best for
you and your family, not on what you think will make
your creditors happy.
Chapter 7: Straight Bankruptcy
Chapter 7, or straight bankruptcy, is the belly-up version
that most people envision when they hear the word bank-
ruptcy. If you file under Chapter 7, most of your debts are
eliminated, and some of your property may go to your
creditors. You don’t have any repayment plan; your debts
simply disappear.
Assets that are nonexempt (or ripe for picking by credi-
tors) may be seized and sold by the trustee, with the pro-
ceeds distributed to your creditors. In the real world,
however, most consumer bankruptcies are no-asset cases.
In other words, you have nothing for creditors to take,
except the shirt on your back and other items that are
off-limits. If things work out, you lose only your debt.

To qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you need to jump
these hurdles:
 Can you pass the Means Test? The Means Test
requires a complicated set of calculations that are
supposed to identify those consumers who can pay
a significant portion of their bills and should be
required to do so instead of shedding all their obli-
gations in Chapter 7.
 Are you acting in good faith? Some judges consider
whether you’re acting in good faith. They may ask
whether
• Your bankruptcy was necessitated by sudden
illness, calamity, or unemployment.
• You made unnecessary eve-of-bankruptcy pur-
chases far exceeding your ability to pay.
• Your bankruptcy paperwork is complete and
accurate.
Chapter 13: Debt 
Repayment Plans
In filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you propose a debt
repayment schedule, and, for the next 36 to 60 months,
you pay what you can afford. The two types of payments
that you may have to make are
 To a trustee, who doles out money to creditors.
 So-called payments outside the plan, which are pay-
ments that come due after you file and are paid
directly to the creditor.
Part VI: Staying Afloat If the Boat Starts to Sink
308

Creditors usually receive only a small percentage of what
they’re owed and typically must settle for pennies on the
dollar. After that, you’re home-free. Even if you can’t elim-
inate debts, you can still use Chapter 13 to keep creditors
off your back while you pay them in full over three to five
years.
Only individuals with regular income (no corporations,
no partnerships) can file under Chapter 13. The source of
your income isn’t important, provided it’s regular and
stable. Your income can be wages, self-employment prof-
its, unemployment benefits, or even assistance from
friends and family.

Try to Avoid Bankruptcy
You don’t need to file bankruptcy to solve a trivial
financial problem or when a more targeted remedy
is available. Although you shouldn’t view bankruptcy as a
last-ditch solution, you probably shouldn’t make it your
first consideration either. If you can get out of trouble
without filing, that’s wonderful! In fact, you may want to
consider the following solutions before deciding that
bankruptcy is the way out. If these tips don’t do the trick,
try the tactics in Tip #121, “Negotiate with Creditors to
Avoid Bankruptcy.”
Budget
If you can get your financial house in order through disci-
pline and careful budgeting, go for it. The key to realistic
budgeting is establishing a reasonable time frame for
immediate and long-term goals and adopting a positive
attitude that focuses not on what you’re giving up but
rather on what you’re achieving.

Allow Your Family 
to Bail You Out
If a parent or other family member offers to save your
hide, accepting that generosity is tempting. Allowing your
family to bail you out may be a wise alternative to bank-
ruptcy, but only if your Guardian Angel
 Is ready, willing, and able to help.
 Can pay your debts without suffering financial hard-
ship himself.
 Can truly solve your problem, not just postpone an
inevitable bankruptcy.
Sell Your Assets
If you own assets that you’d lose to a bankruptcy trustee,
you may want to consider selling your stuff to pay your
debts. If that doesn’t raise enough money to pay all your
debts, it at least helps whittle down your debt load.
Consider selling your nonexempt assets — those that a
creditor can get — not exempt assets, those that are off-
limits to creditors.
Every state has laws that make certain essential assets
exempt or off-limits to creditors, regardless of whether
you file bankruptcy. Don’t let anyone bully you into sell-
ing exempt assets, which in most cases are off-limits even
if you don’t file for bankruptcy. Most states allow you to
keep homesteads up to a specified value, pensions, basic
household furnishings, and a modest vehicle.
Try to Avoid Bankruptcy 311

Transfer Credit-Card Balances
Although trading high interest rates for lower rates is
worth checking out, credit-card balance transfers seldom
are effective. A balance transfer actually is a new loan,
with the proceeds going to pay debts that should be
pretty far down on your list of priorities. Furthermore,
whenever you transfer a balance and then end up in
bankruptcy, you may be facing an allegation of fraud, and
your creditors may fight to prevent the debts you owe
them from being wiped out.
Restructure Home Mortgages
You may be able to free up some cash by restructuring
your home mortgage. Basically, you can do this in two
ways: arranging a mortgage workout agreement and refi-
nancing.
Taking a home-equity loan doesn’t reduce the amount of
your mortgage debt. With a home-equity loan, you essen-
tially unbuy your house and then buy it back again. For a
variety of reasons, home-equity loans aren’t a good idea
when you’re in financial straits. The most important argu-
ment against a home-equity loan is that it creates a lien
on your home that survives bankruptcy. Say that after
sucking all the equity out of your home to pay your
credit-card bills, you still end up in bankruptcy. What
you’ve done is needlessly put your house on the line. The
credit-card debts were unsecured and would’ve probably
been eliminated in bankruptcy. But the value of your
house secures the home-equity loan. Bottom line: Your
home may be the most valuable and important asset that
you have, and you’re putting it at risk when you play the
home-equity credit game.

Negotiate with Creditors 
to Avoid Bankruptcy
A
ttempting a nonbankruptcy solution is worth the
effort. If you can find someone who actually has the
authority to negotiate, you may be able to cut a deal that
works to everyone’s satisfaction. You’re more likely to
succeed if your creditor is a small organization, but if
your creditor is a large institution, the task will be more
difficult.
Workout Agreements
Traditionally, a nonbankruptcy workout agreement —
where a debtor reaches a negotiated solution with credi-
tors — falls into one of three categories:
 Composition arrangements, where all creditors
agree to accept less than full settlement of the debts
 Extension agreements, which merely extend the
term for repayment in full
 Combination agreements, where debts are reduced
and paid over an extended time period

The problem with these plans is that all your creditors
must go along with it, and so, the more creditors you
have, the harder it is to get them to agree. In addition,
you’ll probably need a lawyer to negotiate settlement
agreements, and the legal fees may be exorbitant, if not
prohibitive.
Workout agreements are more useful when you have valu-
able nonexempt assets that are worth enough to pay your
debts, but you need some time to sell without having to
juggle creditors. In consumer cases, rarely does a debtor
have enough assets to pay his debts.
Strange as it may seem, whenever a creditor writes off a
debt outside of the bankruptcy context, the amount of
the write-off is taxable income to the borrower unless he
was insolvent (owed debts exceeding the value of his
assets) when the debt was kissed off. If you’re in this situ-
ation, consider filing Form 982 with your tax return. You
can get it on the IRS Web site at www.irs.ustreas.gov/
formspubs/index.html (click forms and publications by
number).
Threatening Bankruptcy
If you’re genuinely considering bankruptcy, unsecured
creditors may agree to settle for a pittance simply
because when you do actually file, they’d receive nothing.
Assume that you borrowed $50,000 to start a business,
which never got off the ground. There’s no way you can
repay this debt, and all you own is a modest home, mort-
gaged to the hilt, an old car, and a pension. If you file
bankruptcy, the lender won’t receive one red cent. If you
offer the creditor the money that you’d otherwise spend
on filing bankruptcy, about $1,000, he should (if he’s
Part VI: Staying Afloat If the Boat Starts to Sink
314

thinking rationally) agree to take the money and write off
the debt. A thousand dollars is still better than nothing.
And you avoid having to file bankruptcy.
The success of this kind of strategy depends on convinc-
ing your creditor that you’re truly prepared to file bank-
ruptcy. The best way to accomplish that is to hire a
well-known bankruptcy specialist to handle the negotia-
tion. That way, the creditor knows that you’re serious.
But don’t ever bluff or threaten bankruptcy unless you’re
truly prepared to turn in that direction.

Choose Which Bills to Pay
When You File for
Bankruptcy
W
hen you can’t pay everyone, you need to invest
your money where it does the most good or
avoids the gravest of problems. Dribbling out money to
the most aggressive collectors without an overall plan is
a mistake. The payments at the top of your priority list
(in order) should be your
 Rent, or mortgage, if you intend to keep your house
 Utilities
 Essential vehicle
 Fines, if nonpayment would land you in jail
 Child support and alimony
 Income taxes
 Possibly student loans

A note about paying child support and alimony: The con-
sequences for neglecting those obligations are serious,
possibly even criminally serious if you’re jailed for con-
tempt of court. And many judges have adopted a zero-
tolerance approach toward deadbeat parents.
It’s no accident that credit cards, loans from finance com-
panies, and medical bills don’t make the cut in this list.
That’s because before creditors in these industries can
ever cause you any real trouble they have some hurdles
to jump over. Before they can take any of your property,
they must sue you and obtain a judgment. Besides, these
kinds of debts can be wiped out if you end up in bank-
ruptcy. In addition, if bankruptcy is in your future, you
shouldn’t repay loans to close friends or family members

Negotiate with the IRS
T
axpayers and courts long have complained, and with
good reason, about the overbearing presence of the
Internal Revenue Service. A few years ago, however,
Congress passed legislation imposing a wide range of
restrictions on the collection efforts of the IRS. So now,
after years of nurturing its reputation as a bulldog, the
IRS is considerably less arrogant and appreciably more
humble than it once was. And with all the new proce-
dures, IRS collection efforts have become so burdensome
that authorities are more willing to settle than ever
before.
Your Due Process
One of the reforms, known as collection due process,
requires the IRS to give you at least 30 days warning
before seizing your property and to notify you of your
right to appeal its determinations.
The appeal provides you with an opportunity to claim
that you’re an innocent spouse (where your wife or hus-
band fudged a joint tax return without telling you) or
determine the appropriateness of an asset seizure and the
correctness of the amount the IRS claims is due. More
important, you can also propose alternative payment plans
such as installment agreements or offers in compromise. If

the appeals office turns you down, you can go to federal
court and have a judge review the situation. All these new
procedural safeguards must take place before any of your
property is actually seized.
Negotiate an Installment
Agreement
When you owe less than $25,000, getting the IRS to accept
a payment proposal is actually pretty easy. An installment
agreement requires that you
 Make all payments on time.
 File all future tax returns and pay the taxes due on
those returns in full.
 Furnish updated financial information whenever
requested.
 Agree that any state or federal refunds be applied to
your unpaid taxes.
If you owe $25,000 or more or your request for an install-
ment agreement has been denied, you’ll want to hire a
lawyer or accountant who’s experienced in dealing with
the IRS. At this juncture, the IRS can and does insist on
detailed information about all your assets and your
family’s income and living expenses.
Gain “Uncollectible” Status
If the IRS determines that collecting the tax creates an
undue hardship, it may suspend collection efforts indefi-
nitely. (In IRS-speak, the account is “53’d,” based on the
Negotiate with the IRS 319

number of the form the revenue officer must complete
when reporting that an account is uncollectible.)
Undue hardship means you’re unable to meet necessary
living expenses if required to make installment payments
or if the IRS seizes your assets. The agency distinguishes
between undue hardship and mere inconvenience — usu-
ally finding in favor of the former when it thinks pursuing
you isn’t worthwhile and finding the latter when going
after your assets may be worthwhile. However, even with
an undue hardship, your tax isn’t abated. Taxes and
penalties continue to accrue, and tax liens aren’t
released. And, of course, the IRS continues to grab your
refunds.
Submit an Offer in Compromise
Unlike a payment agreement, an offer in compromise that
the IRS accepts actually results in a reduction in the
amount you owe. The three grounds for an offer in com-
promise are
 Doubt about whether you actually owe the tax.
 Doubt about whether you have sufficient assets and
income to pay the tax in full.
 Exceptional hardship or unfair or inequitable cir-
cumstances caused by payment in-full requirements.
When determining how much it will accept in settlement,
the IRS looks at your present assets and future earning
ability. It calculates how much it would receive from a
quick sale of all your assets and adds a lump-sum amount
based on what it figures you’d have been able to pay on
taxes during the next 48 months.

Part VII
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
You can view reducing what you spend in two
ways: as an unpleasant chore that can suck
much of the joy out of life, or as an opportunity to
evaluate what’s really important to you so you can
get your spending habits in sync with your values.
Here’s a little secret: You have a lot more success
and fun if you adopt the second perspective.
This part gives you miscellaneous tips on how to
cut back on your spending without reducing your
quality of living. And because everyone faces finan-
cial crises at one time or another, it also delivers
advice on how to survive financial emergencies.

Ten Ways to Trim the 
Money Tree
 Determine which expenses you can eliminate with-
out affecting your quality of life. For example, can
you downgrade your cable and still get the channels
that matter most to you?
 Eat out less often. A family of four can easily spend
$30 at a very inexpensive restaurant. You can make
that same meal, or a much better one, at home for
about one-third of the cost.
 Plant a small vegetable and herb garden. Not only
do you save on grocery bills, but you also benefit
from homegrown fun and flavor.
 Cook a giant feast on weekends and freeze the left-
overs in individual containers. Now you have
homemade, ready-to-heat meals for a fraction of the
cost of quality processed frozen foods.
 Sell items you don’t use or need, and purchase
quality secondhand items. Check out Craigslist
(www.craigslist.org), an online classifieds 
site that offers everything from housemates to
horseshoes.
 Become a do-it-yourselfer. If you currently hire
someone to mow, clean, or provide other domestic
services, explore how much money you could save
by doing these projects yourself.

 Get the kids on board. Involving your children in
money management discussions and decisions
empowers them to carry out a thrifty lifestyle.
 Donate wisely. Make a list of charities you can
donate to and politely decline when you receive a
request from the others. Check out Charity
Navigator (www.charitynavigator.org), a non-
profit organization that rates charities based on
their financial health and provides info on how
much of your donation actually goes to the 
programs.
 Revive the dying activity of window shopping.
Gather a group of friends to simply walk through
stores, browsing to see what’s new and to admire
the displays.
 Shop in your own home. After years of overcon-
suming, many people have extra dishes, furniture,
clothing, and more. When you feel a hankering to
redecorate a room or set a special table for the holi-
days, go shopping through the items you already
have.

Ten Ways to Handle 
Financial Emergencies
 Plan ahead. Build a savings cushion of six months
of living expenses and make sure you have adequate
insurance. Leave room in your monthly budget for
surprises. Focus on the plan, and results will follow.
 Pay yourself first. Put savings away as soon as you
get paid. If you can, have it taken from your check
and directly deposited into your savings account
before you ever see it.
 Reduce tax deductions. If you get more than $600 a
year back in refunds, you’d be better off having that
money on a month-to-month basis, earning the inter-
est yourself.
 Earn more money. Get a second job, work overtime,
or ask for that long overdue raise.
 Sell some assets. Whether you sell your grand piano
on eBay or gather your clutter and hold a garage
sale, you just may be able to offset some or all of
your emergency costs by turning your possessions
into ready cash.

 Borrow against your home. If you own a home,
have built up equity, and can afford an additional
monthly payment, a home-equity line of credit may
be just the ticket. Interest payments are incurred
only if you draw on the line of credit, and they may
be tax deductible.
 Borrow from friends and relatives. Just make sure
you put the terms of the loan in writing, establish a
regular payment schedule, and pay interest as you
would with a traditional loan.
 Defer retirement contributions. If you’re regularly
contributing to a retirement plan, temporarily funnel
the money toward emergency expenses instead.
 Seek professional help. If you see no other way out
of your financial crisis, call in the professionals at a
credit-counseling agency.
 Declare bankruptcy. Filing for bankruptcy is a legiti-
mate way to handle a financial emergency if nothing
else succeeds.
