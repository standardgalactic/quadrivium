problem,
49 PAINTING THE TOWN RED
The YC team take on a bunch of 'ooligans from Emap at
Kilburn's meanest paintball extraganza.
MURDER - The Cover game, and a stonkingly good one to
boot. You get a chance to wander around an Edwardian
Mansion questioning people about their love lives, eating
habits, favourite activities, and movements (ooer!), i ts a bit
like doing a company proﬁle!!!

KENNY DAIGLISH SOCCER MATCH - Could this be the best
football game ever? N o  not a chance. If you want a
good laugh look at the screenshots and you'll be rolling
around on the ﬂoor for ages (a bit like an Italian Footballer)!

Did you notice that something was missing in your lives for just one month?
Was there a big gap? Did you wander around with your gob gaping open in a
dull numbness? Well, I can solve your mystery illness with a few select words,
"we missed a month". I hope that's answered your queries, no more letters to
Arthur C. Clarke. ''But", I hear you cry, "Why?"
Go and look at the masthead, and in particular the address. Go on, I'll wait
here... Turn... Turn_ Ie... Tummmm... Right, notice anything different? Yep,
we've moved, no more Hemel Hempstead for us roving reporters, no siree,
hello Milton Keynes, and hello new publisher. "But
doesn't answer why you missed a month!"
Ah, but it does, you see we had so
much stuff to move that it took
Ashley absolutely ages to pack,
clean, and
unpack
everything.
I almost felt sorry
for him as I sat at my
spanking new desk looking
on. mind you the RSPCA did
phone a few times about cruelty
to animals, but I assured
them that Ash enjoyed the
work. Next time he'll just
have to get a bigger car.
So amongst coffee
chests, and bubble
wrapping we come to you
yet again with a more
Milton Keynes sort of
meg, and if you don't
enjoy it, the same
kneecap-less
violence is
applicable.

T H A N G S  T O  C O M E
A look at tomorrows new releases - yesterday.
It's 1999, it's cold and it's a strike for truth, justice and the non-toxic
American way. SNOW STRIKE is a rather new approach to the
problem of drug abuse. The president of America has authorized an
F14-LCB COSMOS plane to wipe the drug barons from the Earth's
surface. Armed only with your wits, lots of stonky ammo and the
plane, you must attempt to do just that. Odd that a game so
concerned with cold should be released in August but there you are.
Available from US Gold, at 9.99 on cassette and 14,99 on disk,
hopefully as you read this.
Footy games seem to be clearing up on the new release front
currently. Just because Cameroon didn't quite make it to the semis
in real life doesn't mean they couldn't on the 64. Look out for
SUBBUTEO, coming your way soon from Goliath Games. Apparently
the programmer is trying to make the game tougher to beat so if it's
too hard when they release it you know who to blame!
Following on the huge sucess of their ﬁrst project HAMMERRST.
Watford-based design team Vivid Image are working on TIME
MACHINE. The plot revolves around the crazy professor Potts, who
has to go back in time and alter his destiny. Activision are marketing
the product, which will no doubt be at least as big as HAMMERFIST
As usual, 9.99 and 14.99 the prices.
The long-awaited STARGLIDER ll will soon be available from the
Firebird label. This 3-0 vector shoot em up has been around for ages
on 16 bit computers and 64 owners around the land have been
impatient for yonks. You'll only have to yonk for another couple of
weeks. Then you can Starglide to your heart's content. The original
made ELITE's graphics look staid so you can expect the sequel to
knock them into last century.
Shoot em ups come and shoot em ups go. They don't actually,
because the most popular type of game since the year dot is still
being re-done, repackaged or redesigned in the hope of pleasing the
fans of the genre (and getting some more dosh out of them), The
latest reincarnation to appear on the 64 of the horizontal-scrolling,
ooh-what-nice-graphics, bloweem-to-bits, look-out, it's-an-end-of-
level-monster is POWER UP from Impressions. And jolly good it
looks too, if you are to believe everything that the software houses
say about their games (which of course you shouldn't; but it looks
good anyway).
Audiogenic Software have been terribly busy just of late. As well
as our EXCLUSIVE review this issue of EMLYN HUGHES' ARCADE
QUIZ, we can now reveal another great game coming your way, in
the shape of HELTER SKELTER. No, despite the potential for a
fairground simulation, it's got nothing to do with consuming lots of
popcorn then throwing it up on various wild rides. No, this game
involves balls. Where have I heard that before? Well, this particular
ball has nothing better to do then kill lots of monsters. More next
issue_ Also from the Hanovians(?) comes their ﬁrst ever arcade
licence, EXTERMINATOR. You have to rid a suberbian area from an
attack of nasty insects. Both coming soon_
Well. What with POWER UP, shooties are getting almost as
much attention as footies. 'Titus announce ARE & FORGET II (THE
DEATH CONVOY). Guess what? You are the pilot of an all-powerful
combat machine, which basically gives you a licence to kill, maim
and crush as many people as possible in as short a time as possible.
Who said life was deep and meaningful? And why should it be any
less simple? Just ﬁre and forget. It boasts an amazing ﬁfteen - yes
ﬁfteen - musical scores, 3-D graphics and fast animation. So what's
new? Coming soon.
Electrocoin announce a licence with the old arcade king
Universal to produce home computer versions of the classic MR DO!
As this game was my personal all time favourite, I hope for their sake
that they do a good job! The hero Mr. Do! has to run around mazes,
eating chenies, amassing points, pushing apples onto monsters'
heads or if that doesn't work, shooting them with his crystal balls!!!
Good clean fun on the run. I for one can't wait to see it, About time
too! Nice one Electrocoin.

WELCOME
TO THE
NEW LOOK VC
As you may have
noticed, YC has
undergone major
surgery, and the
team think that it is
a darn sight more
'user-friendly'. We
are the only C64
dedicated games
mag, and we're
jolly well proud of
it too. This is a new
era for the
magazine with
bigger whatsits
than any other, so
with a new
publisher, the
concrete splendor
of Milton Keynes,
and a few NEW
members of the YC
team forget the
(yawn!) other rags
and you'll get more
than you could
possibly have
wanted from us!!!
CRUISE INTO
THE SCENE
Watch out girlies,
Tom's here, although
there's absolutely no
need to stick your
ﬁngers down your
throats as there is a
game coming based
on his exploits in his
latest ﬁlm 'Days of
Thunder'.
Days features the
exploits of oor Tom as
he strives to win the
ultimate Stock Car
race at Daytona, and
the Comrny 64
version will be written
by Tiertex Ltd.,
famous for the
excellent Italy 1990. It
should be available
around October, a
short while after the
ﬁlm's release.
THE CROWD GO
BANANAS
Krisalis, the company
that put Yoo into
Manchester Yoonited,
is to hit us with
another footy game in
the shape of John
Barnes (well, probably
in a box-sort-of shape
really, but you get the
grasp of it!)
The England man,
who has one more
season left on his
Liverpool contract,
with be roaring into
your shops around
the start of the footy
season.

ARTS' SPARKS
(AND BODY
PARTS)
Rainbow Arts, the
company behind the
two excellent hits X-
Out and Turrican, is at
it again, but grab for
the bucket as its
latest is a new step in
the sickeningly cute
wave.
Apprentice is a
platform game with a
touch of adventuring
to be done, all in the
mould of the
Japanese style
arcade games. The
hero this time is a
small wizard who
must progress from
level to level solving
doofers, and
unlocking
oojamaﬂips. It is all
done in the nicest
possible way and we
at YC are waiting in
eager anticipation to
see if it's any bit as
good as Rainbow
Islands and Flimbo's
Quest (the
cornerstones of the
genre).
LEISURE SUIT
LARRY HITS THE
BIG TIME
Erstwhile industry
personality, and hairy
dude, Larry Sparks
has been promoted to
European marketing
manager of Activision
(UK) Ltd. This comes
as no surprise
although YC wonders
if he'll still be doing
his tea round in the
Reading based
ofﬁces. 1 1 7 4 '

MOORE OF THE
SAME
To continue the
tradition of game
releases featuring
Britain's best loved
(and more
promiscuous) spy,
Domark has The Spy
Who Loved Me 0
coming out in
September. There is
some nostalgia
attached to this one
as it was the ﬁrst
Bond movie that Rik
saw in the cinema,
and even then,
apparently, the
projector broke down
and he got his money
back after only seeing
the ﬁrst half. The
game though, should
not be as tragic
considering the track
record of recent Bond
games, although
those who remember
A View to a Kill may
tread a little lightly.
TWO DOWN (BUT
WITH INJURY
TIME BEING
PLAYED)
The major shock of
the computer world
(for the minute,
anyway) was the
recent demise of both
Tynesoft, and
Grandslam. Both
companies have had
their ups and downs
in the way of releases
and both have felt the
bite of a particularly
savage Spring.
This means that
neither company will
release any
impending titles,
although Thalion (the
German based
company, whose
sales and marketing
were being performed
by Grandslam) is to
continue to release
product in this
country through US
Gold. And Horrorsoft
is currently seeking
another company to
take over the sales
and marketing for its
Elvira game.
Our immediate
concern though is,
who's going to run the
charity footy match
this year, eh?

CHEATS ALWAYS
PROSPER
Hot Shot
Entertainments has
launched a new way
for you to spend
uncanny amounts of
dosh, in the way of
one of those 0898
numbers. This one
though could be the
lifeline of many a
stuck gamester.
The Megatip
Gamesline promises
to deliver the hot
secrets of the latest
games, although it
will cost you 25p per
minute at cheap rate
and 38p per minute
at any other time.
We'd recommend
that you use our
Scum of the Earth
pages to ﬁnd out the
solutions to your
probs, it's a lot
cheaper, but if you're
adamant (Not if your
Adam Ant!) try ringing
0898 299388. There'll
be a report in a later
issue about lines like
this...
THROUGH THE
KEYHOLE...
The ﬁrst YC reader to
guess correctly the
games company
whose ofﬁce that

Just who the hell writes the reviews? Who do they think they are
telling you what games are good, and what's not? Why do they all
have outrageous hairstyles?
We don't know the answer to the last one, but here's a guide to
the reviewers,-
Rik "Poirot" Henderson - Editor
Rik's favourite kind of game-like thang is undoubtedly footy
management games. He does like the ocassional footy non•
management game too, and he has been seen spending a lot of time

There isn't a game on this planet that Ash would admit to being bad
at, and cutesy games seem to be his personal fave. He used to own
an Amstrad, but claims that he's a lot better since Rik sent him on the
'riaff computer rehabilitation course'. Now he spends a lot of his time
sitting in the corner going "Um".

Each game is given different ratings in the form of a wonderful froody

no mysteries to solve, and we can't

In fact there is nothing quite like a
good bit of sleuthing and Murder
emphasises this. It is a game that
takes the idea of Clued° and
expands upon it zillions of times, so
much so that the game contains
nearly 3,000,000 different murders
and solutions (lots of endless nights
methinks). This is due to the options

name of the house, the type of house

an effect on the murder itself. You
can also choose the features of your
male sleuth, in photokit fashion, but
the only effect this has is to come up
with a name for you.

You can also question all the
guests and staff in the house by
pointing your spy glass at them and
selecting the Question icon (makes
sense really). This brings up a new
screen with more icons on it, and
using a small amount of swapping

tell you all that they know about
everybody, everything, and
everywhere. Each answer that they
give, if you deem it interesting, you
can store in your notebook, which
once called up will have every piece
of information ﬁled in different
categories. For example if Mr. Bertie
Blenkinsop said that Mrs. Hilda
Snogbucket was blackmailing the
victim, then that information would
do not get lost, there is a map
available to you (when you choose
the map icon).
When you feel you know what
object was used in the murder you
can pick it up and confront the
murderer with it, this will result in the
newspaper showing up again with
either congratulations for the super
sleuth, or a story announcing your
suspect's innocence. If you fail
though, you can always choose that
same murder again as they are not
random.
Murder is immaculate in
presentation, and the black-and-
white graphics for the movement
screen create just the right
atmosphere. This is not everyones
cup of tea, due to the complexity of
each separate murder, and even the
simplest one will take a fair while to

of them_ For those though with more
intelligence than a piece of popcorn,
and are willing to use it when they
play games, this is THE game to play.
Murder could well be the top game

You may be
wondering why
a Liverpool supporter like
RIK is reviewing a game
with Man Yoo as it's title. So
is he...
I
footy team, I remember seeing
their 3-1 win over us on New
Years day 1989 and since then I've
despised the way they play. There
are also many others like me, and
this makes the move to have a game
solely for the one club, and to be
honest any club, bafﬂing as it
alienates so many game players.
That said, most Liverpool, Man
City, Arsenal, etc. fans should not
judge a book by it's cover as this
game is deﬁnitely the most playable
football game to hit the stands. It is a
duel game, and a rather unique one
at that, in the fact that it combines
the action aspect of most footy
games, and the managerial side in an
even more complex way than the
great Football Manager (I'm talking
about the game, and certainly not
Alex Ferguson), and when both are
combined it's pretty hot stuff.
The management section is the
ﬁrst to load and contains more
features than a lot of games that
offer this sole aspect. It is all icon
driven, and all controlled via the
joystick, thus making life a lot easier
for the real Man Utd supporters (YC
would like to apologise to all
Manchester United supporters, if
you'd like to reply to Rik's unending
abuse write to Post Apocalypse!).
There are icons for training, ﬁtness,
transfer market, team list, newspaper
headlines, and other Options that
help make this half of the game fully
complete. And once everything has
been chosen (including making the
team abilities for the opposition a
mite lower than your own) it is off to
the other side of the tape and the
match itself.
Once this has loaded, and it
doesn't take long, you have the
chance to either watch your team's
performance under the far better
control of the computer, or you can
participate yourself. The gameplay is

ON THE TAPE
And so the seventh tape did
come to pass, and the readers
did rejoice, for there were not
two mega ston kingly good
games (like other 'free'
cassettes on other C64 mags)
but three, and all of them
never seen on cassette before.
Yippee! Hoorah!...
Running Order:
Side A: Phobos, Limbo.
Side B: Frogs in Space.
PHOBOS
Here you are, a harmless wimp of a
guy that controls a walking/ﬂying
machine. So what's wrong with that?
Well, unfortunately you're locked
away in jail 'X'.
Now for some people this might
just be ﬁne, but not for you. No siree,
your only ambition now is to break
out and regain your freedom. In order
to achieve this task you will have to
negotiate four levels of aliens, which
get more and more devious the
further you go.
The screen in split into two
different views, the top one being
from overhead and the bottom being
seen from the side, In order to destroy
an alien you must align both top and
bottom views of your craft to the
approaching little sucker.
On level one you must destroy 20
aliens, 30 on level two, 40 on level
three, and (er...) 50 on level four. When
you've managed this awsome task,
you have succeeded in breaking out.
Whenever you start a fresh level,
remember where you were teleported
into it (both top and bottom). This is
where your exit will be.
There are no 'lives' in the normal
sense, but every time you hit an alien
or a bomb, your score will reset to
zero and you will start again (on the
same level). To stop playing, simply
press the 'RESTORE' key and the title
page will appear. When you restart
you will start from the level that you
quit from, but with a score of zero.
Controls
Joystick control changes slightly
depending on whether you are ﬂying
or walking. If you are walking, joystick
left moves your top screen man up
(ie. to the right). Joystick up moves
your bottom screen man up to ﬂying
position.
If your bottom screen man is
already ﬂying then joystick up and
down change slightly. Joystick up
moves your bottom screen man
higher and faster, and joystick down
makes your bottom screen man lose
height and slow down or land. (If, like
Ash, you are a games-playing mega-
god then you will ﬁnd no probs with
the above controls. Those of us ﬁrmly
rooted to mother Earth will need to
perservere a tad).
•
E. I 1%/1 13 4:
This is NOT a dance simulator but a steamingly good
arcade/strategy number, so plug your joystick into port
two (that's the second port for footy hooligans!) and
wibble it around a bit. It won't get you anywhere so
you'll probably have to think a little too.
The idea of the game (are you sitting comfortably) is
to clear all of the cells off each screen by moving your
droid over them. You can also take your chance by
activating question mark blocks, some of which are
good, but some are pretty much pooey.
The game is dead simple to play as all you have to
do is clear each zone of cells whilst avoiding the guards
and 'dangerous' blocks. On some screens there is a lift
that will carry you to other parts of the zone. To board it
simply press ﬁre when you are touching it and release

- FROGS
I N  SPACE
Alright, we admit it! This is not the most original game
in the galaxy but then again neither is Knock Down Ginger
-
(or 'knocking grannies out of bed', as they call it oop North), but
we've all played it some time, and to be honest it was quite funny too.
Now Frogger has donned a space suit and he is back to his old ways in the
vast, busy space lanes. And this time there is no girly waiting at the other end.
To get the little amphibious star traveller back to his batchelor pad you
must ﬁrstly avoid all the interstellar trafﬁc, and then catch a lift in order to guide
him into each of the cosy cubby holes at the top of the screen.
Apart from dodging all the space trafﬁc, and timing jumps to hitch lifts to
perfection, there are other hazards! These include combinations of four
variations of spacecraft formations, a Pac-man in the central reservation
(happily fed on a diet of raw froggy), and the usual increase in trafﬁc speed and
the amount of time to reach home.
Your score will increase by 10 points when you hop forward, it will also
increase for every unit of time remaining when a frog reaches home. There is
also a chance to gain extra frogs by collecting the letters to spell the word
BONUS on certain levels.
There are 32 levels to complete. You may start on any of the ﬁrst 16, level 0
being the ﬁrst, level 31 the last.
There is also a hidden access code to enable you to stay on ANY level, and
the ﬁrst correct one to
reach us will win a few
top games.

computers a while back and I
didn't think that it would ever

because it used their capabilities to

Unfortunately Impressions had to do

Soccer Match is, to be completely
frank, a complete pile of steamy
poop.
And these words do not come
lightly from my ﬁnger tips. I'm a
Liverpool supporter and have been
for around twenty years. When I was
at school (aye, them were the days
lad!) Kenny was my undoubted hero,
and I even had a number seven
stitched to the back of my rather
tatty 'pool shirt, in a sort of worship.
But his name has been added to the
worst soccer game ever, and it
makes me sad to think that other
Dalglish fans might indulge in this
game, thinking it to be as great as
the man himself.
Alas this is not so, and your fears
will be realised even as soon as the
game has loaded, because a speccy-
like pic of a ghnning Kenny
(obviously before HE saw the game)
greets you and offers you the options
of play. Or option I should say,
because the speed and difﬁculty
levels seem to have little effect on
the playability, and I have no doubt
that anybody on this planet would be
stupid enough to play this game at
45 minutes each half. There isn't
even any fancy extras that allow you
to play a full league in order to

emulate the champions. No siree, the
most it offers is a four player
tournament, although I have no idea
why three of your friends would want
to partake in your personal agony.
But once everything is chosen it
is here that Kenny's takes the biscuit.
Men appear on a non-descript tuft of
grass, looking as if they'd fallen into
a car compactor and been spat Out
as misshapen lumps. Also instead of
an arrow at the head of the player in
control, like most footy games,
Impressions has plumped for an
upside down cross. I think
somebody should mention to them
that this signiﬁes satanism, and is
the mark of the devil, I even thought
of playing the tape backwards to see
if there was some form of hidden
message.
And then the match begins and
the players (your players anyway)
plod around trying to control the ball,

This game is a load of poo... er, that's about it really!
and failing most of the time, although
it really doesn't matter as the
opposition seem unable to decide
which way to run, let alone challenge
for the ball. The easiest way to score
a goal, and just about the only way
as it is almost impossible to kick the
ball in the direction you want, is to
leg it forward with the ball ahead and
run it into the goal. This will result in
a picture of Kenny celebrating, and a
hiss that sounds as if someone has
stubbed out a cigarette on him. If
you have misjudged it and the ball
goes off for a goal kick, then a pic of
a bald ref with a skin disorder will
appear with a sound much like a
heavy breather blowing through a
reed. And that's about it.
One other thing about the
gameplay though. As I was the reds
(and therefore the mighty Liverpool) I
let my Brucie have a crack at the
action, and why not, the opposition
weren't going to stop him. This was
when I discovered that you can only
have one goalkeeper on screen at
one time, so when he ﬁnally arrived
at the goal (yawn!) the blues' keeper
had mysteriously vanished leaving an
empty net.
And oh how I laughed when my
reds had won 12-2 and Kenny's
quick message came up on screen. I
don't know if it's just me but when he
said "A magniﬁcent game" I had to
quickly rush to the toilet.

The game consists of two series

scenery - these look like standard
lamps. Reﬁll above maximum though
and you'll blow the character's circuits
and reduce it to zero.
The further you get into the game
the worse the mutilation of the
landscape becomes. Our heroes
encounter mutant salads that lob

creatures mutate from radioactive
pools of steamy water. And the ever
present robots become meaner and
more devious by the minute. With
every screen it becomes more difﬁcult
to break free from the security system
and escape to the next challenge. Your
skills with gun, ﬁst and foot will be
tested to the
maximum as the
screens become
tortuously difﬁcult.
There are screens with
lifts that go down
when Hammy steps
on but up when Metal
is standing on it.
Some doors need the
pistonﬁst to open
them as well as the
deactivation of the
security system. On some screens it
may be necassary to visit others to
make completing them easier.
32 screens may not sound like an
amazing number but each is brightly
coloured and extremely busy and well
drawn. The design and programming
team Vivid Image has done its
utmost to make all of the versions
identical and the 64 version is
superbly done. The characters are
neatly drawn and beautifully
animated. Whilst the graphics and
game design have had almost two
years spent on them the game is so
very playable. Often the danger of
producing a technically brilliant
game is that it becomes unplayable;
but not Hammerﬁst.
The style smacks of the classic
Impossible Mission but that doesn't
mean that the game is unoriginal. Far
from it, Hammerrist is a terriﬁc
acheivement. It is a triumph of game
design over another version of a
popular idea and just goes to show
that there are still some creative
programming teams out there.

There are many nice features
about the game. It is a right to left
scrolling game. The board is made
up of squares. These squares may
be blank, carry a fruit or cash or a
question mark. Landing on a
question mark gives a trivia question
of the relevant subject, according to
what colour the square that you
landed on was. The questions have
three answers displayed, and the
right one will need to be chosen.
Should you get the question wrong
then another is asked and so on.
Other squares are pyramids that
trap your pointer, invisible squares,
pushers that propel you in a random
direction (these are extremely nasty),
zappers and bonus round entrance
points. All of these affect your
progress one way or another and

The
Perils of
Programming
Programming your game?
As someone once said
"The best way to earn a
small fortune writing
computer games, start
with a large fortune". Kati
Hamza nods her head and
dispels many beliefs
S
programmer? You want to be
rich, you want to be famous
and you want to sell mountains of
games. In a couple of years you
could be cruising round the country
in your GTI, your latest software
trophy bouncing around on the back
seat. Alternatively you could be
slogging your guts out in the spare
room, slaving over a hot monitor for
24 hours a day and still be absolutely
skint. Programming can be a perilous
profession, especially when you're
new to it. The route to success is an
obstacle race, unless you know
where you're going, you could end
up ﬂat on your face.
Under starter's orders
There are two ways to get into the
business of programming games.
Most straightforward and less risky,
though that doesn't mean there
won't be any problems, is to join an
existing software house, or
programming team. You'll get a
regular salary and a structured
workload but you won't be working
as an independent agent and you
won't be working for yourself. The
alternative is to set yourself up as an
independent freelancer and that's
how a large proportion of
programmers in the business
actually work.
Hurdle Number 1: Getting
the show on the road I M P
You've written another Xenon II, and
you're determined to be even bigger
than the Bitmap Brothers. And who's
the fairy godmother who'd make
your dreams come true? A software
house, right? Wrong. Even if you
have produced a masterpiece, it's a
one in a million chance that the
software house will be convinced
you're a genius straight away. No
company is going to wave a magic
wand and make you a star overnight.
Laurie Bennett, editor of the monthly
newsletter for the Society of
Software Authors, an organisation
set up to give advice and information
to freelancers, is still surprised at
how naive young programmers can
be.
"They walk on to a stand at the
PC Show with a two-page game
design and expect to come away
with a big, fat cheque, the industry's
not like that any more."
Computer software is big
business and it's a business Rin by
professionals. If you want them to
take any notice of you, you've got to
approach them in a professional way.
OK, so you may be working from
your bedroom but that doesn't mean
you should present your design like a
piece of scruffy homework. First off,
pick an appropriate software house.
It's no good sending an RPG, say to
a company like Ocean that
specialises in arcade conversions;
they won't be interested. Take stock
of what a company's produced
before and imagine your game ﬁtting
into their product list. Just make sure

$
you haven't produced a clone of
something they released last month;
they're unlikely to be tempted.
Just writing a letter usually isn't good
enough. Take the bull by the horns
and make an appointment by phone.
If they agree to see you, now's the
chance to sell yourself. Make sure
you provide as much detail as
possible at the presentation. A two-
page game design isn't going to
capture anybody's imagination. The
SSA advises that you should include
as much information as possible plus
screenshots and demos wherever
you can. Even if the screens aren't
animated, or the game isn't in a fully
playable state, they give a much
better idea of what the ﬁnal product
might look like than any drawing or
diagram could.
Hurdle Number 2: The
Contract
They've taken the bait, they want the
game. Don't sign the contract
straight away. It's a binding, legal
document and you could end up
being taken to court over its
contents so it's common sense to
work out exactly what it says.
, Consult a solicitor or someone with
the appropriate legal knowledge to
decipher the stilted language and
make sense of the small print. If you
don't you can't be sure it says
exactly what you think it does. Too
40., often, programmers run into trouble
because they sign up in a hurry
before really considering the
ﬁnancial viability of a deal or
because they don't realise what
they're committed to. If there's a
royalty statement are you entitled to
overseas royalties as well, do you
have ﬁrst refusal on conversions, will
you keep the copyright, what
conditions are there on payment and
so on?
Hurdle Number 3: The
Deadline
Dave Baxter, erstwhile ex-Software
Development Manager of US Gold:
"There may be two weeks left until
the end of the schedule, the Amstrad
and Spectrum versions haven't been
started and the guy still seems to
think he'll be ﬁnished on time."
Programmers are notorious for
being late and some of the industry's
worst horror stories are about
programmers practically killing
themselves to get a job ﬁnished on
time. And usually the delays aren't
due to circumstances beyond
everyone's control or Unrealistically
curtailed deadlines, bad time
management and perfection are
major factors when it comes to
burning the candle at both ends.
It's a problem faced by anyone
who makes their living working for
themselves; you've got to discipline
yourself. That means working out a
schedule for completing particular
aspects of a game and making every
effort possible to stick to it. It's easy
to lose track of time or kid yourself
into leaving those long winded bits of
routine coding to another day.
Martin Walker, author of the
excellent games Hunter's Moon and
Citadel, identiﬁes another
This programmer took it too far and look what happened to him!

programming pitfall; perfections "If
you've got a game that's 97%
ﬁnished, the remaining 3% can take
you as long again to complete. You
spend ages getting everything just
right and then when the game ﬁnally
goes on sale, hardly anybody notices
the difference."
Obviously you want your game to
look as good as possible but you've
got to balance the aesthetics against
the efﬁcient use of time. In any
business time is money, and the
more time it takes the less money
you're earning per hour.
A product that's way behind
schedule can cause a programmer
serious problems. Depending on the
contract, the software house may be
perfectly entitled to delay a pay
installment. Inevitably professional
relations sour and future contracts
may be jeopardised. That's before
you take into consideration the late
nights, the Pro Plus and the physical
consequences of stress.
Hurdle Number 4: The
Dosh
There are lots of ways to earn your
million but becoming a programmer
usually isn't one of them. All
programmers work hard to earn their
living but only a few hit the big time
and strike it rich. The big names that
everybody's heard of are the
exception, not the rule. O n e  of the
biggest gripes in the average
freelancer's life is money. You may
think that whatever's speciﬁed in the
contract - lump sum or royalty,
advance payment or regular monthly
cheques - is a guarantee of payment,
but it's not. Most freelance
programmers are paid late and same
never get paid at all. Money certainly
doesn't come in as regularly as it
would if you were doing a 'proper'
job in a supermarket or bank.
Even a contractual promise of
regular monthly payments isn't
failsafe. Tom (the names have been
changed to protect the innocent)
found that every one of his monthly
cheques came at least one month
late. One of the companies Richard
worked for had a policy of not paying
up for a minimum of 90 days; another
only paid the top ten on its freelance
list. Its not unknown for cheques to
bounce or for companies to pay less
than the contract states. Your last
resort could mean going to court.
If you're unlucky (and not
everyone is) this can lead to a spiral
of ﬁnancial problems. Harry realised
he was in trouble when the bills
Some software houses treat their programmers like leatherbound slaves!
started ﬂooding in more regularly
than his pay cheque. By the end of
the project, he was totally skint and
ready to accept any job he could
take. In desperation, he signed the
ﬁrst contract that came along - under
equally disadvantageous ﬁnancial
terms.
The Finishing Line
You've made it. Your games out on
the shelves, the reviews are fantastic
(of course) and you're sitting back
counting the cash. If you've been
paid in a lump sum, how well the
game sells won't affect you at all. If
you're dependent on royalties you
could be in for one ﬁnal shock.
However good the reviews they don't
guarantee how well a game will sell.
Even if you're hailed as the greatest
genius since Einstein it won't do you
any ﬁnancial good unless there's
money behind all that mouth.
And after all that, lets take a look
at your bank balance. How much
you've got depends on market
forces, the quality of your product
and how proﬁtable a deal you made.
You could come out rich (but not that
rich) and you could come out broke.
Most likely, you'll end up somewhere
inbetween.

treating our readers with a

ALL RED TAPE
I have been buying your magazine
for 3 years now, and despite my
initial shock at the recent changes,
I enjoy very much the new look VC,
especially the free tape.
For the past three months, I
have had no problems with loading
the cassette, but this month's (April
90) tape will not load on side A,
despite cleaning my tape recorder
and changing its alignment.
Normally I would, of course,
just ask the retailer to change the
tape/magazine for one with a tape
that works. However, the only shop
which sells your magazine in my
area is in the nearest city, which I
can only manage to visit once a
month to buy your magazine. It is
because of this that from next
month I am asking my local
newsagent to stock it for me.
I am also asking you to give me
a replacement tape as the tape is

my favourite part of your magazine
and this will allow me to buy your
mag in conﬁdence of getting a
good value buy every month. I
thank you in anticipation for my
replacement and for the continuing
increasing standard of your

bestest of his adventures
to date. And I've
completed The ﬁrst level..
Here's how to do it.
At the start, run to the
bomb or else The bat will
cut you off. Bomb the bat
and the two skeletons. Go
right, under the invincible
bat and drop a little onto
the waste pipe. Jump
over the gap, Walk a little
right (avoiding the bat)
and let the stalactite drop.
Drop off of the platform
and drift to the can of
worms. Bomb the miner
and grab the coin.
Work your way to the
two bats guarding the
laser gun - you can grab it
without being hit if you
time it right. Shoot the
next miner and go under
the crusher. Don't go
down the ladder as this
makes the rest of the level
much harder.
Drop down the shaft,
get the can of worms and
shoot the skeleton, wait
for the frog to go back
then go up the ladder.
Get the items then
drop down again. Go right
to the platform, beat up
the skeleton and the
miner and go tight. Jump
onto the moving platform
from the sinking platform,
avoid the bat and go up
the ladder. Kill the
skeleton, grab the eggs,
and go down.
Land near the pipe. To
kill the rat, jump up and
down on the spot and
kick then go under the
pipe and follow the truck
right (kill the purple bat on
the way) and jump over
the truck. Grab the
treasure, avoid the bat
and go down to the coin.
Avoid the bat, kick the rat
and go right. Get the
other rat then go right.
Go up the big pipe
then drift right to the
platform. Avoid the bat
and get the gem, then
kick the homing bat.
Climb the pipe, sneak
across on the horizontal
one by going half through
it, then drop to the right
onto the platform. Kick
the rat, go right onto the
sludge and kill the
skeleton. Go to the bomb
then come back and go
through the pipe to the
shaft. A s  you drop,
hold down right to get the
can of worms. Get the
bomb at the bottom.
Avoid the bat and go to
the top of the rope then
come down to miss the
stalactite. Go back up and
bomb the miner, run right,
get to the top of the
ladder then wait for the

The new ﬁve pence coins are absolutely disgusting.
When I was ﬁrst given one I thought that I'd been
diddled with a foreign coin.
But no matter how weird and small and disgusting
they are, they can't possibly be as downright nasty as
the new ﬁve pound notes. Surely the Queen doesn't
look THAT old, and who designed the colour scheme,
Andy Warhol?
I was nicely surprised though (by
the presentation at ﬁrst) because the
amount of options and the ways to
play it are very rewarding for the
passive gambler. For a start, it allows
up to four players to participate, and
the computer will make up the other
bettors (up to the total of twenty) and
you can have three difﬁculty levels to
play at, and the win conditions can
be set by you (ie. the ﬁrst person, or
computer player, to reach the target.

want to.
And there are even countless
options when you have placed your

race. You can watch from overhead,
in which mode you see the horses in

the side of the track, only switching
to overhead when the horsies are

you can even have a photo-ﬁnish

DOMARK -
£9.99 Tape,

No, KLAX isn't
some kind of
wierd Tropical
disease. It's more a way of
life.
I  9  ve  got the Klax. Before you
retreat to a quarantine zone,
let me tell you that Klax is the
latest arcade conversion that
Domark have brought to the small
screen of your 64. And to say that it's
stonkingly good would be doing it an
injustice. In fact it is very stonky
indeed.
On the face of it it doesn't sound
all that special. A load of tiles are
winding their busy way down an
intergalactic conveyor belt. Your task
is to stop them from falling into the
void by catching them on your
paddle and ﬂipping them into a pit.
You might think that that sounds
easy. Well, it would be of course, if
you could just throw them in any old
how. But in order to avoid overﬁlling
the pit, you'll need to be devious.
Extract from Intergalactic Klax
Training Manual Volume 3; "The very
nature of the drifting space tiles is in
doubt. They are made of some
strange compound that has no
reaction with other colours, but when
exposed to at least two more of its
own colour, it will glow brightly, and
mysteriously disappear...It matters
It you call me a blockhead again I'll cry, honest I will!
Ploppp! I
not in what order the tiles are placed,
whether vertical, horizontal or
diagonally, but the crowd seem most
pleased by the more exotic
.11
approaches".
As the tiles roll towards you, your
paddle can move to cover their path.
There are ﬁve bands, one for each
place in the pit. The paddle can carry
up to ﬁve tiles before being
overloaded, and each of the pit's ﬁve
bands can take up to ﬁve tiles each.
At the start of each screen the task
for that level is set. This might be to
score a certain amount of points,
survive for a set number of tiles, or
just to create a number of Klaxes. A
kiax is three tiles of the same colour
in a row. Get four in a row and it
counts double; ﬁve in a row counts
as a triple.

Walk Like an Egyptian
Domark is a software company, not something that a
baker washes off of his rolling pin.
Tiles were ﬁrst invented by the Ancient Egyptians, but
theirs weren't delivered to them on large conveyor
belts. Their football team was reputedly the best in
the world in 1990 BC. Unfortunately, the World Cup
didn't appear until nearly four thousand years later.
It's a bit like lego, only it's not really!

As well as a straight line, there
are other more exotic Klaxes. You
can make a Big X, which uses nine
tiles of the same colour in a huge
cross; you can set up multiple Klaxes
which award bonus points. But
should a tile fall over the edge, it
gives a little scream and one of the
lights on the dropmeter lights up.
Light all three and it's game over. The
game also ends if you ﬁll all of the
space in the pit. Lesser mortals will
welcome the credits option that lets
you continue on if you die, just like
the arcade.
Very nice graphically, although
quite simple as you'd expect, and
the sound is very crisp and adds to
feel of the game_ If you like action
puzzling games then try it out, you
won't be disappointed.

that Accolade have decided to be

games for a song. Sorry, that's how
Kylie Minogue pays for things. You

not all that much. The four games
are Hardball, Test Drive. Mini Putt
and Apollo 18. Hall! Bet you thought
that they had done a compilation of
sports games. Nope. Apollo 18 put
the brakes on that theory.
Test Drive is a classic driving
game. It's you against the clock, the
law and the other driver as you push
your high-performance car to the
limits of its endurance and speed.
The view is from behind the wheel.
You'll need to keep an eye on the
petrol gauge, the rear view mirror
and the rev counter as well as the
road ahead if you're going to suceed.
Things can get pretty hot behind the
wheel of a Porsche or Ferarri so
you'll have to learn tact too. At
various places along the way there
are garages to refuel your tanks.
Miss one out and it's game over
time, but pull in and you'll get a
progress report.
Hardball is quite an old game
now. It is a simulation of the

"Drive" can also mean "annoy", as in "You drive me

there, from the windmill to the loop
the loop. The game plays like a golf
game, lining up each shot and
gauging the power you need to use.
Obviously, wind is less of a factor in
crazy golf and there is absolutely no
need to shout "FORE", unless you
want to scare the hell out of your
friend as he lines up to take his shot.
Good fun.
Finally, Apollo 18 is a space
mission. You have to ﬂy to the moon
and retrieve a probe which landed
there in 1967, and repair in space
three satelites that are badly in need
of their 10,000,000 mile service. Of
course you'll have to catch them
ﬁrst. Each mission has about eight
components, from take off to re-
entry and eventual splashdown.
Along the way you'll probably have
to try your hand at moonwalking too.
I've always found space simulations
to be a bit on the bland side, and my
opinion hasn't really been changed
by Apollo 18.
Certainly not a bad buy. There's
better games around, but four for the
price of one is good value. Worth
looking at.

COMICS
Revolver #1
, 01
'fp ' ,It m4.14
2000AD
offsprings
are coming
at us thick
and fast,
and
there's
none more
thick or fast than
Revolver. Aimed at the
'mature reader' (like most of today's
'rad' comics) it supplies what it
promises. It is reminiscent of the
other comics of the ilk (Deadline,
Al, and perhaps even Strip) but
with one major difference, it is full
colour from cover to cover,
something that perhaps suggests
that it is aimed at a younger
readership than originally
expressed.
The strips themselves are all
suitably different from each other,
with the intention that they contrast
each other favourably. To me
though, it looks as if one or two of
them were last minute inclusions
that stick out like a sore thumb.
The high point is undoubtedly
Dare, an up-to-date new age
version of Dan Dare in a sort-of
Dark Knight Returns stance,
although the bio-like tale Purple
Days, based around the exploits of
Jimi Hendrix, is pretty poor in
comparison.
Revolver is almost the comic of
today, but has a way to catch up
with the ever-improving Deadline.

Aliens Vs. Predator #1
Park Horse
$2.50
The two seperate titles, Aliens and
Predator, are selling incredibly well,
and have been major successes
since their launch. Sense would
therefore indicate that a team up
between them would be one hot
move.
And it is for this fact that this
comic comes as no surprise to
anyone. What does come as a
surprise is that humans are also
involved in a plot that even Twentieth
Century Fox would be proud of.
There are these
humans see,
and they
are
incredibly
unlucky,
because
not only
have the
Predators
decided to pay
them a visit, but
the Aliens want a
slice of the action
too. And in this tale of complete
carnage where everybody is an
enemy the only thing you are
guaranteed will be action.
Artwork is reasonable, and the
writing is very good, and it comes
at a time when both Predator 2 and
Alien 3 have both been announced.
I wonder what is next though, 'Jaws
meets the Aliens and the Predators,
but falls foul of the Thing, who's
cousin is the Blob'?

against other such managers. At the time of writing,
there are two divisions of 12 teams each, and more are
to come. Rex Enterprises also states that more leagues
will follow once each one is ﬁlled.
Turn around (the time in which you will receive each
result sheet) is around 3-4 weeks, so patience is a
virtue, but unlike football management games on the
commy, the thrill of beating a real person is a thrill unto
itself.
A third division is currently being prepared, so if you
write to Rex Enterprises mentioning 'YC', you'll receive
a free rulebook.

Well the sequel in the

that ran on wind and jerked around
violently, and cost a hefty pound coin
in London's Oxford Street! Now
Activision, bless its cotton sockets,
has decided that the corn my 64
should sample the delights (?) of the
original, and the only things that
seems to have transferred
successfully is the need to have a
bucket present after playing, so that
you can say hello again to the
contents of your stomach.
This is not because the action is
frantic, nor is it because you can get
a friend to spin you around and
shake your chair while you are
playing. The reality of it is that the
colours on the screen, and the
graphics are so blocky and jerky, that
the whole thing is like watching one

of those kaleidoscope thingies ﬂash
past your eyes every nano-second.
To make matters worse there is a
plot that would give George Lucas a
coronary, and his lawyers a new task,
as there is a galaxy that has been
taken over by a dark and evil force,
called the Forth Empire (da, da, da,
dummm!), and they threaten the
future of distant civilisations (ahem!).
There are ﬁve planets in the centre of
the galaxy that have been taken over
by the Forth Empire (da, da, da,
dummm!) and you, as a member of
the elite Galaxy Force (brandishing a
light sabre, no doubt) must destroy
their bases by ﬂying over the planets
whilst blowing the smeg out of
everyone and everything (who said
liberation was easy, or painless),

wibble it fast enough, you'll
most probably save the

If you've ever played Afterburner
you'll get my drift, it's very similar,
and the gameplay is nigh on
identical. The graphics though are
actually worse (if that's possible) and
the only saving grace that the game

US GOLD -
E9.99 Tape,
E14.99 Disk
Every four
years the World
Cup comes and
goes, and so do the related
footy games. RIK looks at
one of the more accurate
ones.
O
us this summer Italy 1990
must boast the best
presentation. You get a lovely big
box, a chance to win a trip to Italy
(erm,. well expired by now), 50p off a
World Cup Joystick, a splendid (if
rather small) poster, a very glossy
world cup book (entitled ﬁle-of-facts)
that tells you everything you ever
wanted to know about the world cup
past and present, and oh yes there's
the game as well.
After all this bumf you might be a
little wary of what the game is like. I
mean, we ALL remember World Cup
Carnival, don't we? But gosh, shock,
horror the game is a bit good if you
know what I mean!
There are two loads involved on
the cassette version, the ﬁrst is the
cool, neat, and dudey selection
screen where you get to choose the
game options and team you wish to
play. Each team has different ability
ratings for skill, speed, aggression,
and strength, all out of ﬁve.
Therefore, on your ﬁrst attempt at
winning the World Cup you might
want to try Brazil or West Germany,
but when you feel like an expert at it,
Cameroon or Costa Rica would be a
stiffer challenge. The team selection
is cool presentation wise too, as all
the home and away strips, plus the
T
ﬂags of the nations, are all displayed.
Once this is done the second
load takes place and then you are
faced with more options in the way
of team and formation selection. You
have a squad of twenty players
(unlike the 22 in the real World Cup)
to choose the best eleven to ﬁt your
chosen formation out of players who
all have individual skill, speed,
aggression and strength ratings (the
game does not require subs). Once
this is done they all trot onto the
pitch with a roar from the fans, but
no naff band sounding the national
anthems as if they are playing
through a kazoo (like in real life). All
the players look as if they have been
Fax
on steroids for far too long, but at
least there are eleven of them, unlike
some other games. and they wear
the colours that you'd normally ﬁnd
them in.
The player nearest the ball
ﬂashes from the colour worn to white
and back again almost as if he has
lodged his metal studs in a plug
socket, but this is a far better
method of player recognition than
the ﬂoating arrow that follows
players in other games. And it is in
this gameplay section that Italy 1990
performs best. If comparisons were
to be made between this and THAT
football game (Kick Off, of course)
then this would be my choice as the
World in Motion
The lyrics to New Order's World in Motion were
written by Keith Allen, who is an alternative comedian
and a member of the Comic Strip. He is best known
for his portrayal of The Yob. He was also assisted by
Craig Johnston, the ex-Liverpool winger who is now
sunning it in his native Australia.

better of the two, that is until THAT
game's sequel is released pretty
soon.
You can do most things that most
games allow you to. You can head,
kick, hoof, slide, dribble, slobber, and
even run with the ball if you want.
This is because unlike THAT game
your boots all seem to be dipped in
Golden Syrup as you twist and turn
and the ball sticks miraculously to
your foot. There is a province for
fouls and even yellow and red cards,
distributed by a referee in the stands
as he is nowhere to be seen on the
pitch, and every time there is a ref's
decision the scoreboard promptly
tells you so. Fouls though come few
and far between, and this makes any
games against Uruguay look very
unrealistic indeed. But it is so damn
playable that these little
inadequacies are belittled. Another
nice touch is the extra time and
b

990
Anu W e  b a l l s  in  t oe air, it  t hink s  it's  aii
penalties option if that tough game
ends in a draw.
There is little this game doesn't
have, although the offside rule is
missing yet again, which all adds up
for an enjoyable little number, if a tad
limited. I must admit I got through to
the semi-ﬁnals with Brazil in my very
ﬁrst play of the game (I didn't even
play a practice match), so the simple
gameolay might be a touch too
simple but this is not a problem as
games of this ilk never have too
much of a shelf life. It's nearly as
good as the real thing although the
Italians in this version do not
practice their amateur dramatics on
the pitch.

PAINTING

The Ye team take on an
Emap team at Terminator
indoor paintball. Jeff Davy
reports from a small hole,.
ﬁnk it's time for Hot Leaden
Suppositories snarled
Flamehead in May's YC
before blowing away a load of
footballers. Let's face it, he's a
violent psychopath, so he might ﬁnd
terminator right up his street. And if
his street is in Kilburn, North-West
London, he'll be even better off. For
it is there that urban warriors can
engage in a pastime that would thrill
any Dulux employee - indoor
paintballing.
Terminator is based in a burnt out
cinema. The advert says that the
venue has been "renovated for
speciﬁc games use" but it looked
more like the new owners arrived
one day, painted the whole place
black, added some lights and a
sound system (eerie music, for the
playing of) and turned the place over
to paintgun-toting punters. And as
long as you're over 18, you can hand
over your £15 and join the ranks of
amateur killers.
For your cash you can get kilted
out in a boiler suit (in several sizes,
short & baggy, medium & baggy and
large & baggy - no problem for the
Manchester style conscious), plastic
goggles (as worn by school science
pupils) and a face mask.
As soon as you sign away your
right to claim in the event of
death/injury/future inability to have
children (the paintballs hit hard), you
get a gun, three tubes of ammo
Go on do it. Just one quick squeeze and he'll be washing paint out of his ears
forever!
What are they doing? That better be a
McDonalds' straw or they're in big trub.
(small balls of red paint, which look
more like bubble gum than high-
speed projectiles) and two Carbon
Dioxide cannisters (which provide
the propulsion for the ammo). You
are also responsible for damage to
the weapon.
All togged up, you're ready to
play. A squad of people dressed up
is ready to do battle with anyone, or
anything. A normal urge at this point
is to check the gun. they (BOFF -
SPLAT - Aaargh) pack some punch.
The paint balls ﬂy as close to the
legal maximum speed of 280 feet per
second as to make little difference.
What has not been revealed until
now is that not only did a YC team
head down to Kilburn, but so did an

Boys and guns, pah!
(with 'Predator' showing on a screen
in the corner and several arcade
machines & a sofa littered around)
we were told that our objective was
the capture of the opposing team's
ﬂag. We  had to ﬁnd where it had
been hidden, run with it (in full view)
back to our HQ and look after it until
the end of the game. Er... Right.
The two teams were led off to
their respective hideyholes. Our ﬂag
was stashed in a small room at the
top of the cinema, at the end of a
long corridor, and the team divided
into defenders and offenders (that
sounds right, most of the YO
Editorial staff ought to be locked up).
The game began and the latter lot
disappeared.
Being in defence during a
paintball game is like defence in
school football. You get no action for
most of the game, although you can
hear it, or even see if, in the
distance. I could hear the sound of
guns ﬁring and hitting either walls or
people and the occasional shout of
"Marshal - don't shoot" (the neutral

strained shouts of "I said don't
shoot, MARSHAL!"
Sod this, I thought after many
tense minutes. As the eerie
soundtrack got more persistent and
Emap stayed as distant as ever, I
was on the move, darting into a
doorway before sliding down the
rows of wooden steps where the
seats used to be. As the game-time
neared its end I was onto the stage -
where was the opposition?
I scampered nervously over the
smoke-shrouded open area, before
descending into the cinema's
depths. Around me were the sounds
of popping guns and shouting
ﬁghters. I had a choice of direction,
either over a seven foot wall, through
what looked like a brick ﬁreplace or
through the water room. The hole in
the brick looked mighty small so I
opted for the water room. I could see

The EMAP mob, boo!
the door on the other side... The
murky liquid covered my inquisitive
trainer and I felt it soaking my sock
and foot. Cold as well. Yuck.
I opted for the wall. As I tried to
pounce onto It I heard the cracking
sound of a gun going off. A paintball
smacked Into the wall. Someone was
sniping at me. I ducked and looked
around. Another crack and
something bounced off my head,
unexploded. A lucky escape.
9. Huw, looking much like Fozzie
Bear, and lurking for some reason.
Had It blown open I would have been
"dead" for ten minutes and off to the
waiting area to enjoy a vid before
returning to the fray.
The game then ended. I trudged
to the 'lounge', watching others
emerging from their hiding places.
No-one could tell who had won,
although Emap hadn't even made on
effort to capture the YC ﬂag. Such
confusion reigned that we just had to
declare it a glorious YC victory.
The second game was a lot more
topical - Hunt Salman Rushdie.
Divided into pairs, it was a knockout
tournament. 'Salman' himself (a.k.a.
Alex, Terminator's owner) was dead
annoyed when successfully hunted -
and fancy disqualifying the foursome
that got him (no-one mentioned rules
against foursomes.) bad loser, I say.
The only real disappointment was
ﬁnishing after the pubs had closed.
The YC team were victorious to the
end as they left Kilburn - if still sober.

Fantasy role
playing on the
Commodore
wi ne v e r  be the same
again.
M
less a standard in the
tradition of computer
roleplaying games. That is, it is a
sprawling adventure set in a
mysterious land. This land is plagued
by many evils (or goods if you're that
way inclined) that desperately need
slaughtering mercilessly, and as a
band of hapless adventuring types
you've got the job.
Most roleplaying games have the
attraction of building up the power of
a group of people, whilst making
Did you hear the one about the Goblin with
them as rich as possible. Generally
speaking, the more advanced into a
game you get, the higher your
character's "level" becomes. This
means that the characters become
more adept at handing out large
amounts of damage to lots of nasty
monsters, scooping up wads of
treasure and just romping around the
land spreading their inﬂuence.
Might and Magic II is typical in
that respect. However, it is
completely atypical (there's a word
for the day) in as much as it is
completely superb in every respect,
and is possibly the best role playing
game on the 64. I know that I've said
that before, but this game is
different_
The action takes place in the
Mythical land of Cron. Cron is more
or less the average Mythical land,
with lots of mythical towns and
villages, mythical roads and ﬁelds,
and mythical people and monsters.
There are literally hundreds of
monsters to meet and interact with.
Usually this interaction involves a lot
of gratuitous violence but you can
bribe monsters or merely run away.

Fax
Smelly Wars
Might is another word for strength, whilst magic
means supernatural.
Thus, Might and Magic means supernatural strength.
As far as we know, Lynx deoderant have no plans to
launch either Might or Magic as new additions to their
range.
Your party will need to be created
before any violence can occur (after
all, you're only doing it for the scrap,
so why pretend?). There are pre-
created characters of various levels
but it's always more fun to take
characters from level one to the top.
Just what we need, ﬁve cans of ﬁzzy pop!
Go on then, I'll have a go!
They mean much more that way. The
characters are "Rolled up" in the
time honoured tradition, by the
computer generating random
numbers for your statistics and you
deciding what to do with them.
Different types of character use
different stats: for example, Fighters
need lots of strength whilst Clerics
need Personality.
Once you've assembled your
force, you have to take them off into
the land. You start at an inn, where
you apparently met up and decided
to adventure together. The rules for
putting a party together are very
slack, so you can mix alignments
(good, neutral and evil) if you feel so
inclined. However, genuine
roleplayers will want to keep their
party "pure'', either having all good
or all evil with the odd neutral.
Another nice touch that experienced
roleplayers will appreciate is that all
spellcasters, whether good or evil,
can use the same spells.
The screen display is nice and
clear, though it looks a tad cluttered
at times. There are windows for
virtually everything, including a view
of the location that you are in, a list
of hit points for the characters and
any vital information. Conversation
(which is somewhat limited,
admittedly) takes place in another
window. The party will often meet
people who offer quests to the party,
and you can decide to take them on
or not.
Graphically the game is great.
The monsters are well-drawn and
imaginative; they give a good ﬁght,
and you'll have to be careful about
what you challenge at ﬁrst. Assuming
that you kill a monster, you'll
probably ﬁnd some treasure. This
doesn't come easy either, as it is
kept in some sort of box which may
well be trapped. The traps will need
to be disarmed if you want a share of
the spoils but fail in the attempt and
it's an early grave for you.
As you progress, the game
carefully adjusts itself to cater for
your higher level of power. Thus the
monsters get more dangerous and
cunning, the puzzles get harder to
solve and the treasures get more and
more rewarding. If you've ever
played a roleplaying game then you'll
be hooked by this one. It's really
down to earth stuff, very playable
and addictive. Go out and get it.

Alternative - E2.99
Coo, I remember coming out of the
cinema at around midnight after
watching Aliens. No granny, dog, or
even lampost escaped the hot
leaden death that my ﬁngers
expelled in an effort to emulate the
big screen actions. And when
Activision released the UK version,
expectations were not only high, but
fulﬁlled.
The US version was not as
accurate in the suspense and sheer
horror as its UK counterpart, but
nonetheless, it was, and still is, a
great game.
Being multi-load, you will be
forgiven for casting several doubts,
but each of the sections are very
playable indeed, and there are
passwords for each level that allows
you to enter that level at the
beginning.
The graphics are typical of
American Activision games
(Ghostbusters, Pitfall)
and although rather
basic, they serve their
purpose rather well. The
gameplay too is of a high
standard. Although the
game has none of the
dark mood of its big
Summit - E2.99
Paul Hardcastle is long gone, and
not many will remember his number
one smash hit N-n-nineteen.
Cascade though, who released this
game at full-price in the Past,
certainly did, and had a trilogy of
games based upon the hit single
lined up. Only one game appeared
though, and here it is.
It's not half bad, for a completely
macho affair, and it comprises of
four 'training' sections. Each will
allow you to display your pigeon
screen counterpart, now that it's hit
a budget price, care of Alternative,
it's worth a go as a piece of
nostalgia.

sized muscles and Adrian Pumphrey
like reﬂexes (erm... erm... erm... I've
got... erm... good... erm... reﬂexes).
The ﬁrst is based on a assault
course and is probably the hardest
of 'em all. Second is the best, as it
is a riﬂe range that is seen through
the sight of your weapon (no ooers
from me!). The third is a jeep driving
section much in the mould of Buggy
Boy. And the fourth and ﬁnal section
is hand-to-hand combat with your
drill instructor. If the sequel(s) were
also available, the game would be a
little more worthwhile, but it's a
good value buy at E.2.99 for almost
four complete games!

Yet another rerelease, yet
another big name
license, and yet another
crappy game hits the
streets.
Andy Capp, as I'm
sure you already know, is
based on the very popular long-
running comic short in the Daily
Mirror, and is about as funny, and
inventive as its counterpart.
You are the beer swilling, wife-
cheating, police-skipping lout who
must raise cash in order to give Flo
her housekeeping. I have never
encountered a game that is quite
so slow and boring even though it
has pretty girls and plenty of lager.
Its a sort of arcade adventure,
and the characters are fairly well
animated as they plod around the
streets of wherever, the
backgrounds though are absolutely
abysmal and the gameplay is so
tenuous it's better than a Mogodon
for putting you to sleep. Mirrorsoft
were the culprits the ﬁrst time
round, now the company famed for
Pro Mountain Bike Simulator has
succeeded to ﬁnd a worthy
successor to the steamy pile of
poo crown. Not so much Andy
Capp, more Andy... You can guess
the rest.

Alternative was the ﬁrst budget
company to release original, big
licenses at a budget price, and it
has had much success at doing so
(with Postman Pat and Thomas the
Tank Engine being just two), and
now Count Duckula (the cartoon
spin-off from Dangermouse) gets
the home computer treatment.
Programmed by Enigma Variarions
(now a company in its own right,
with several cartoon licences of its
own coming up), Count Duckula
manages to capture the Cosgrove
Hall production wonderfully.
Instead of thinking up a new
idea and hoping that it would work
at a budget price you can be
forgiven for reworking an old theme
as long as it is done well. And CD
is.
The game owes much to the
adventure/platform games of the
past, and as the fowl vampire you
must ﬁnd a magical saxophone in
order to transport you back to your
beloved home in the darkest,
Summit - £2.99
You're probably becoming rather
fed up of football games at this
very moment so TOUGH!!! We've
got another one!
This is yet another rerelease,
and my faint memory allows me to
visualise a time when I ran home
clutching this game after paying
the necessary wonga. It promised

dampest Transylvania. This is not
as easy as it sounds though, as it
is hidden in this enormous
pyramid that is inhabited with
bats and mummies (but not so
many daddies).
The graphics are nothing
short of superb and are very
similar to their animated
counterpart (i.e. they move
smoothly, and comically). The
everything that no other footy
management game could deliver
at that time, and the promises
were not unfounded, but there
was one tinsy winsy prob. THE
GAME WAS SO SLOW!!
It took about half a minute for
each result to go through the
vidiprinter, and there were results
for each game in the three
divisions. Even the gates for all
THE a
the matches were displayed, and
when it came to the cup matches,
well, you had to sit through around
half an hour of slow moving graphics
just to get to the outcome of your
match (or if you've been knocked out
already, somebody else's).
This is a real shame cause the
basic management structure is
superb, with scouts not reporting the
music is bearable for about two
minutes and then the volume control
becomes a necessity. A winner though
(at a budget price anyway) is normally
made up of terriﬁc gameplay and
average everything else, Count
Duckula has far more going for it.

And now it's a big welcome to the
Sooty & Sweep computer show -
starring Sooty and his ever-amazing
magic wand, that rascal Sweep
armed with a scary water pistol, and
good old Soo, who's always around
when trouble looms.
Yep kids, your fave terrible ﬂuffy
twosome will be in big trouble cos
Matthew is out and that scamp
Sweep has not only left his dirty old
bones all over the house but he has
also left the door to the garden wide
open and let all the creepy crawlies
creep and crawl all around the
house.
So it's "Izzy Wizzy let's get
Bizzy!" as you attempt to save the
day by collecting up the bones,

After a hard week's work, full steam ahead, poor Thomas
rolled into the station. "I said you could rely on me, I've
been such a useful engine." Beamed Thomas to the Fat
Controller. "I took the children to the seaside, the
medicine to the hospital, the tractor to the broken bridge
and delivered the mail, the coal and the oil to the reﬁnery
- all before the sun went down each day, just as you told
me."
which have been left in the most
awkward places, whilst avoiding the
bugs. And that's about it really.
Slapstick fun can be had in a two-
player game snatching bones off
each other or throwing gooey
custard pies (something I've always
wanted to do to Rik!).
Basically the only magic trick I'd
want to do would be to wave my
magic wand and make the game
disappear off screen! Even in
grown-up mode the gameplay is
annoying and incredibly boring.

"Well done Thomas!" Chuckled the Fat Controller, and
he strolled down to the village pub to sup his daily 15
pints of soda pop, down a full bag of Tandoori doughnuts
from the village takeaway and puke over Lenny the
Lampost!
Alternative is certainly on the right track in this
endearing little game for 'kiddies' of all ages as you
complete all the tasks whilst avoiding other trains, fallen
objects and dodgy corners. With bright and chunky
graphics and a bouncy tune, it's all a kid could hope for in
a game which not only provides tracks of excitement, and
steaming
good fun, but
also an
educational
excuse to play
a game. A
right riveting
