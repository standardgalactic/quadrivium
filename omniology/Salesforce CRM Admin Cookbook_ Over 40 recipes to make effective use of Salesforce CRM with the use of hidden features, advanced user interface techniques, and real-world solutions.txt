Acknowledgement
Writing this book has been fun and I have enjoyed the time I have spent working on the 
chapters. My family has been very supportive, as well as being a useful springboard for some 
of the ideas; it is only with their support and patience that I have been able to complete my 
part of this endeavor.
Many other people have helped in the creation of the book and I am grateful to them all. 
Here's my attempt to provide acknowledgment where it is rightly due.
First I'd like to thank the heroes at salesforce.com for providing such an amazing product. 
Salesforce CRM is one of the very few business applications that is so easy and fun to work 
with. The application just goes from strength to strength with each new release and the 
amount of innovation, new feature development, and added business value that it brings is 
simply outstanding.
Next I would very much like to thank the team at Packt Publishing who have successfully 
orchestrated the completed work. From the time when I was irst approached, to the time of 
editing and coordinating the inal reviews, the team has been extremely supportive and highly 
professional throughout the writing process.
I would like to thank all the many people who have contributed with ideas and code recipes. 
Instead of trying to name them all and risk not mentioning others, I would like to thank in 
general all the salesforce.com employees, professionals, and keen enthusiasts who help 
make the salesforce.com community such a productive and collaborative environment.
If you haven't participated in the salesforce.com online user communities such as: success.
salesforce.com (where you can post questions or ideas); developer.force.com; LinkedIn 
salesforce.com user groups; and Twitter (look out for #salesforce and #askforce), I would 
strongly recommend them as they are a truly valuable place to exchange information.
Finally, I would like to thank YOU for purchasing the book. I sincerely hope you ind it as 
enjoyable and useful to read as it has been to write!

Introduction
The Home tab in Salesforce CRM is generally set as the opening page for users when they irst 
log in to the application and provides a great way for users to view Chatter posts, access their 
calendar, tasks, items to approve, and so on. 

Working with Home Page Components and Custom Links

The following screenshot shows the Salesforce CRM Home screen:
The Home tab allows various standard home page components to be shown, such as 
Calendar, My Tasks, or Items to Approve, (as shown in the preceding screenshot), that you are 
able to administer and choose whether to display for the various users in your organization.
Home page components can be presented to users by customizing the home page layouts 
where you can assign different home page layouts to different users based on their proile.
You can also create your own custom home page components that will display alongside the 
standard components and you can choose to make custom sidebar components display on all 
pages within the application or only on the Home tab.
The following recipes are designed to improve the layout of the home page. The recipes 
also provide additional features and functionality that are not provided natively within the 
Salesforce CRM application.

Creating a Personal Setup link using the 
standard Custom Links on the sidebar
All users need to change their personal settings, from time to time, in the Salesforce CRM 
application. They may, for example, wish to edit their user information, change their password, 
or you may need them to grant login access to administrators, plus many other reasons.
Accessing the Personal Setup area is done by users clicking on their name, looking for the 
Setup link in the drop-down list, clicking on the Setup link, and then inally clicking on the 
Personal Setup link in the sidebar.
All this takes time and can often be a challenge for less-experienced users of the application. 
By providing a direct shortcut link in the sidebar, all users will be able to access their Personal 
Setup area with a single click, and save their time and efforts.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create a Personal Setup link in the sidebar:
1. Navigate to the home page components' setup page by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Customize | Home | Home Page Components.
Locate the Custom Links row within the Standard Components 
section.
2. Click on Edit.
Within the Custom Links page you can enter a maximum of 15 
links.
3. Enter Personal Setup in the 1. Bookmark ield.

4. Enter /ui/setup/Setup?setupid=PersonalSetup in the corresponding URL 
ield, as shown in the following screenshot:
5. Click on Save.
We now need to add the standard Custom Links component 
to a home page layout (if it has not been already added).
6. Navigate to the home page components setup page by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Customize | Home | Home Page Layouts.
7. 
Determine which home page layout to place the component on and click on Edit. 
Here we are editing the home page layout named DE Default, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
We will be presented with the Step 1. Select the components to show page.

8. Check the Custom Links checkbox in the Select Narrow Components to Show 
section, as shown in the following screenshot:
9. Click on Next.
10. Move Custom Links to the top position in the Narrow (Left) Column using  
the Arrange the component on your home page section, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
11. Click on Save.
How it works...
The link appears in the sidebar within the standard Custom Links section, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
When the link is clicked, the user is immediately presented with their Personal Setup page.

There's more...
Clicking on the link displays the Personal Setup page in the same window and is useful 
when there is no requirement for the link to open up in a new browser window. The following 
screenshot shows the result of clicking on the Personal Setup Custom Link:

Using Custom Links to open Training in a 
new window from the sidebar
In the Salesforce CRM application, there are various options for help and training.
Accessing the training area is done by the users by clicking on the Help link at the top of the 
page (which then opens in a new browser window). Users then need to look for the Training 
tab within the new page and then click on the tab.
All this takes a little time and can often be a challenge for less-experienced users of the 
application. By providing a direct shortcut link in the sidebar, all users will be able to open 
Training automatically in a new window with a single click, thus saving time and effort.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create a link in the sidebar to open Training in a new window:
1. Navigate to the Custom Links home page by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Customize | Home | Custom Links.
2. Click on New.
3. Enter the label of the Custom Link in the Label ield. Here, type the text Training.
4. Accept the default name of the Custom Link in the Name ield, Training.
5. Leave the Protected Component checkbox unchecked.
The Protected Component option is used by developers to mark 
the Custom Link as protected in managed packages. This then 
allows the developer to delete the link in any future releases of 
the managed package without worrying about causing package 
installations to fail.
6. Enter the following description in the Description ield: This a link to 
Salesforce Training.
7. 
Choose the Display in new window option from the Behavior picklist. Choose the 
URL option from the Content Source picklist.

8. Enter /help/doc/user_ed.jsp?loc=training into the source section as shown 
in the following screenshot:
9. Ensure the selection Unicode (UTF-8) is set in the Link Encoding picklist.
10. Click on Save.
We now need to create a custom home page component to house this custom link. 
The alert displayed in the following screenshot reminds us of that:
11. Click on OK.

12. Now navigate to the home page components setup page by going to Your Name |

13. Click on New.
14. Click on Next (on the Understanding Custom Components splash screen, if shown).
The Next button is found on the Understanding Custom Components splash  
screen (this page is only shown if the Don't show this page again checkbox  
has not previously been checked) as in the following screenshot:
Here, we will be presented with the Step 1. New Custom Components page.
15. Enter the name of the Custom Component in the Name ield. Enter the text Custom 
Links (in New Window).
16. Select the Links option from the Type options list as shown in the following 
screenshot:
17. Click on Next.

18. Now add the Training link to the list of Custom Links to show as shown in the 
following screenshot:
19. Click on Save
We have created our Training link's custom home page 
component but we are not finished yet. We now need to add 
the custom home page component to a home page layout.
20. Navigate to the home page components setup page by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Customize | Home | Home Page Layouts.
21. Determine which home page layout to place the component on and click on Edit.  
Here we are editing the home page layout named DE Default, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
We will be presented with the Step 1. Select the components to show page.

22. Check the Custom Links (in New Window) checkbox in the Select Narrow 
Components to Show section as shown in the following screenshot:
23. Click on Next.
24. Move Custom Links (in New Window) to the top position in Narrow (Left) Column 
using the Arrange the component on your home page. section, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
25. Click on Save.
How it works...
Clicking on the Training link opens a new smaller browser window with the Salesforce 
Training page directly accessed and loaded alongside the main Salesforce CRM application 
windows. Users can switch back to the main application when they want and simply close the 
Training window when they are inished viewing it.
You can see what this looks like in the following screenshot:

Creating a news-ticker message on the 
home page
Animated text messages and custom HTML styling can be very effective in gaining  
users' attention.
Not only do they allow a reasonably large number of characters to be presented on a single 
line of text but they also provide a visually dynamic "headline news" style of message delivery 
for what can otherwise be overlooked static text.
You can draw attention to your news message on the Salesforce home page using this custom 
home page component recipe with the steps listed in the following section.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create a news-ticker message on the home page:
1. Navigate to the home page components setup page, by clicking the following:  
Your Name | Setup | Customize | Home | Home Page Components.
2. Click on New.
The New button is found by scrolling down the page to the 
Custom Components section.
3. Click on Next (on the Understanding Custom Components splash screen if shown). 
The Next button is found on the Understanding Custom Components splash  
screen (this page is only shown if the Don't show this page again checkbox  
has not previously been checked) as in the following screenshot:

Here, we are presented with the Step 1. New Custom Components page.
4. Enter the name of the custom component in the Name ield. Enter the text

5. Select the HTML Area option from the Type options list.
6. Click on Next.
7. 
Ensure that the Wide (Right) Column option is selected within the Component 
Position option list.
You are unable to change this setting after the component 
is created.
8. Check the Show HTML checkbox.
The above step is important! Locate and check the Show 
HTML checkbox, as shown in the following screenshot:
9. Paste the following code (as shown in the following screenshot):

The marquee tag is a non-standard HTML element which causes 
text to scroll up, down, left or right automatically. From http://

The marquee element was irst invented for Microsoft's Internet Explorer 
and is still supported by it. Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari web 
browsers support it for compatibility with legacy pages.
Automatically collapsing Chatter feeds on 
the home page
The Chatter feed on the home page appears at the top of the home page layout (as shown 
in the screenshot in the Introduction section) and is a great place for presenting the feed of 
Chatter posts.
However, since the Chatter feed is always shown at the top of the home page, users  
ind themselves having to scroll down the home page to get to their calendar, items to 
approve, or anything else that has been conigured on their home page, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 1

The Hide Chatter button allows users to manually hide the feed but this has to be done every 
time the user lands on the home page either when they irst log in or when they click on the 
Home tab.
To save users' time by automatically hiding chatter feeds on the Home Page every time the 
user accesses the Home tab create this custom Home Page Component using the steps  
listed in the following section.

Removing Chatter feeds on the home page
The Chatter feed on the home page appears at the top of the home page layout (as shown 
in the screenshot in the Introduction section) and is a great place for presenting the feed of 
Chatter posts.
However, often there are users who are not concerned with seeing these feeds on their home 
page and would like to completely remove the section. This is not possible using standard 
salesforce.com coniguration.
 
In this scenario it is a requirement to fully remove the Chatter section and to remove the Hide

Adding a Send An Email button on the  
home page
Within the Salesforce CRM application you can natively add custom links to the home page, 
which can be conigured to call web URLs. These URLs can be either external to Salesforce 
or internal, such as a link to the Salesforce CRM Training pages (covered in an earlier recipe 
within this chapter).
Salesforce does not, however, natively provide a way of adding custom buttons onto the home 
page in order to call web URLs.
Often it is preferable to provide a button to invoke certain behavior (rather than a URL link).

How it works...
By adding the description for the sales stages, the Visualforce and Apex reads the data directly 
from within Salesforce and so, regardless of whether the sales stage descriptions change or 
even the sales stages themselves change in the future, the content is always up-to-date.
Users can then see the description, that you would have set, for each of the opportunity 
stages in the organization on the Visualforce page without having to create dummy 
opportunities and look at the available stage names.
Salesforce does not natively support the embedding of Visualforce pages into the home  
page, hence the need to create this HTML custom component. Within this component we 
are using the <iframe> HTML tag we are able to insert the rendered output of a speciied 
Visualforce page.

Introduction
There is a saying that a picture paints a thousand words. Whether this is true, there is no 
doubt that pictures and images, often, far better describe information than words and 
numbers alone.
Text and numerical data can often be better represented as graphical charts and images often 
provide a quick way to compare data values. Images can also provide a more visually powerful 
style of message delivery for what can otherwise be overlooked static text or numbers.
In this chapter, the recipes are designed to enhance the user interface and provide features and 
functionality for visually displaying information that is not provided natively within Salesforce.

Displaying Case Priority lags using a 
formula ield and salesforce.com images
The use of certain colors to represent certain states has become commonplace throughout 
the world. Red generally conveys a warning and on the ubiquitous trafic signal means stop.
Continuing with the look at trafic signals, and the use of red for stop, green for go, and yellow 
for proceed with caution, these colors are ranked in the order—red, yellow, and green—and 
using lags of these colors allows us to rank statuses and to highlight certain priorities.
Salesforce CRM contains accessible images of red, yellow, 
and green lags.
In this recipe, we will display an image according to a certain priority setting on the Case 
record detail page where the priority setting is selected using the standard picklist ield  
called Priority.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create a formula ield to display salesforce.com images:
1. Navigate to the Case customization setup page by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Customize | Cases | Fields.
Scroll down to the Case Custom Fields & Relationships 
section.

Building an Account Revenue indicator using 
a formula ield and custom images
Increasingly on the Web, we ind websites that use images of gold or silver stars to provide 
reviews and to rank the quality or usefulness of various products and services.
It has become universally accepted that one or no star equates to something very poor and  a 
rating of ive stars is seen to be excellent. By building an incremental number of images, we 
can create an associated image list of, say 1 to 5, that conveys a rating and ranking factor.
For this recipe, we are using a dollar image that will be repeated depending on the value of 
the Account Revenue amount.

Chapter 2
47
The dollar image we are using is a custom image and is not provided 
by the Salesforce CRM application.
Using the value entered in the standard Account Revenue ield we will create a custom 
formula ield to build a set of images, from one to ive, whenever the Account Revenue 
amount meets a certain threshold criteria.
The thresholds that will formulate are:
 
f
Greater than (or equal to) $100,000 = one dollar image
 
f
Greater than (or equal to) $500,000 = two dollar images
 
f
Greater than (or equal to) $1 million = three dollar images
 
f
Greater than (or equal to) $2 million = four dollar images
 
f
Greater than (or equal to) $5 million = ive dollar images
Amounts less than $100,000 will have no images displayed.
Getting ready
We can use custom images that we have either created ourselves or obtained from an 
external source and store them in the Salesforce CRM application.
External images can be uploaded into Salesforce CRM by carrying out the following steps:
1. Create or source a suitable image to represent a dollar symbol.
The image we have used here is a 16-by-16 pixel icon called  
money_dollar.png available from famfamfam.com, shown  
as follows:
FamFamFam have provided various images from their "Silk Icons 
library" available under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License 
at http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/.
2. Navigate to the Static Resources setup page by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Develop | Static Resources.
3. Click on New.

4. Enter the name of the Static Resource in the Name ield. For this recipe type the text 
money_dollar.
5. In the File uploader control, click on the Browse... button to select the image to 
upload from your computer. In this recipe choose the image identiied in step 1.
Ignore the Cache Control picklist selection and leave it as 
default Private (Cache Control is only relevant to static 
resources used in Force.com sites).
The Static Resources setup screen appears, shown as follows:
6. Click on Save.
Static resources allow us to upload images that we can reference 
within Salesforce CRM, such as from formula ields, Visualforce 
pages, and so on. This reference is a Web URL and is formed 
as /resource/[UNIQUE ID]/money_dollar where the 
[UNIQUE ID] is a unique ID which is generated for every static 
resource and is unique throughout every Salesforce CRM system.

Now, to ind the ID for the static resource uploaded above, carry out the following steps:
1. Click on View File, as shown in the following screenshot:
2. Note the Web URL that is displayed in the browser address bar; this is the ID for the 
static resource, as shown in the following screenshot:
The URL that is generated is /resource/1360798680000/
money_dollar.
You will now need to make a note of the URL that is shown in your 
Salesforce organization. This URL is speciied for the reference 
to the image in a custom formula ield that is used in this recipe 
using the steps in the following section.

Creating a clutter-free Account tab using 
Visualforce
When users click on the Account tab in Salesforce CRM they are presented with a screen that 
shows by default a Recent Accounts section within which is a list of their recently  
viewed accounts.
Below the Recent Accounts section are Reports and Tools sections, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
This screen can be very useful when users are aware of its capabilities, however  
less-experienced users are often confused when they click on the Account tab and  
are presented with a list of recently viewed accounts.
Users are sometimes concerned that they have "lost" their accounts as they expect to see 
them all when clicking on the Accounts tab and can be a little frustrated to have to click on 
the button marked Go! every time they want a list of all their accounts.

Chapter 2
55
In this recipe you will see how you can override the standard Account tab's page and directly 
show a simple complete list of accounts owned by users (as part of an appropriate list view).
Not only does this recipe save users' time but it also de-clutters the screen by removing all the 
reports and tools links from the Salesforce Account tab's page.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create a Visualforce page:
1. Navigate to the Visualforce Pages setup screen by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Develop | Pages.
2. Click on New.
3. Enter AccountTabOverride in the Label ield.
4. Accept the default AccountTabOverride in the Name ield.
5. Paste the following code (as shown in the screenshot further down):
<apex:page sidebar="true" tabStyle="Account" >
    <apex:enhancedList type="Account" height="500" 
rowsPerPage="50" id="AccountList"/>
</apex:page>

How it works...
When users click on the Account tab, there is a clutter-free page as shown in the  
following screenshot:
Showing a tabbed Account Detail page using 
Visualforce
Salesforce CRM provides related lists on the standard pages which are added vertically to the 
lower section of the page below the detail section.
www.allitebooks.com

Advanced User Interface
58
As more and more related lists are added for an object, the sections of related list data can 
make the page stretch vertically and make it a challenge for users to scroll down to the page 
to locate the required information as shown in the following screenshot:
To counter this, Salesforce provides hover links at the top of the page that allow the users 
to navigate via hyperlinks directly to the required related list selection further down the 
page. This is very useful when users are aware and dexterous enough to use its capabilities; 
however, some users experience navigating pages that have many related lists.
In this recipe, we will look at how you can show a Visualforce page to override the standard 
Account view and present the related list as separate tabs instead of having them rendered 
at the bottom of the page.

Introduction
In this curiously-titled chapter, we cover recipes that are intended to deal with some aspects 
of Salesforce that can only be applied or implemented by using non-supported methods.
Anything that is applied to Salesforce but which is not supported should be considered  
a risk and should only be used with caution for they constitute a "hack", which is described  
at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_%28computer_science%29#In_
computer_science as:
In modern computing terminology, a kludge (or often a "hack") is a solution to a 
problem, doing a task, or ixing a system that [...] (more or less) works.
Remember these hidden features or hacks are not 
supported by Salesforce.

Extending the year range to 2025  
on calendar pop ups for all date  
ields in Salesforce
Salesforce.com provides many useful ield types from formulae and roll-up summaries to the 
simple URL ield. One ield that can be a little frustrating for users, due to the way it allows 
only a limited selection of year values to be chosen from the pick list, is the date ield.
When clicking on a date ield, the user is automatically presented with a pop up calendar  
and when selecting the year pick list, they can only select from a range of seven years.  
The seven-year range is based on the current year.
The minimum year selectable is the year prior to the current year and the maximum value  
of year that can be selected is the current year plus ive years.
This is not useful for trying to enter dates further than ive years 
into the future.
For example, when accessing the calendar in 2012, the year range is from 2011 to 2017  
as shown in the following screenshot:
There are many business requirements to choose dates further than ive years into the future 
and so this feature poses user experience issues.
Here we are going to improve the user experience and enable future years to be selected.

How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to extend the year range on calendar pop ups for all date  
ields in Salesforce:
1. Navigate to the home page components setup page, by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Customize | Home | Home Page Components.
2. Click on New.
The New button is found by scrolling down the page to the 
Custom Components section.
3. Click on Next (on the Understanding Custom Components splash screen if shown).
The Next button is found on the Understanding Custom Components splash screen 
(this page is only shown if the checkbox Don't show this page again has not been 
previously checked) as shown in the following screenshot:
Here, we are presented with the Step 1. New Custom 
Components page.
4. Enter the name of the Custom Component in the Name ield. For this recipe,  
type the text Calendar Year Extender.
5. Select the HTML Area option from the Type options list.
6. Click on Next.
7. 
Ensure the Narrow (Left) Column option is selected within the Component  
Position option list.

8. Check the Show HTML checkbox.
The previous step is important! Locate and check the Show 
HTML checkbox as shown in the following screenshot:
9. Paste the following code in the custom component textbox:
<br>
<script type="text/javascript">
function insert(pobjSelect, psText, psValue){
 var lobjOption = document.createElement("Option");
 
lobjOption.text = psText; 
 lobjOption.value = psValue;
 pobjSelect.options.add(lobjOption); 
}
var winLoaded = window.onload;
window.onload = function(){
 
if(winLoaded){
  winLoaded();
 }

  insert(e, i, i);  
 }
 }
}
</script>
This is shown in the following screenshot:

If you wish to shorten or extend the year range, you can modify the highlighted section of  
the code and replace it with a suitable value of your choice:
…
  var startYear = d.getFullYear() + 6;
  for(var i=startYear; i < 2026; i++){ 
  insert(e, i, i);  
…
When entering HTML and JavaScript code into the HTML editor section (in step 2 of the  
New Custom Component wizard), you must ensure that the code is valid.
Please ensure that the HTML code entered is valid and well formed. 
Poorly written HTML in this component may cause the entire Home 
tab to appear incorrectly.
There is a maximum of 20 custom components that can be added to a home page layout.
This solution will extend the year range for all pages where you are able to display a sidebar, 
hence it will not work for pages where there is no sidebar such as the Reports tab.

Presenting an integrated view of cases on 
the home page
Users often want a simple integrated set of data on their home pages and in particular  
a way of quickly seeing new cases that have been assigned to them or their team.
For a very quick and easy way of displaying new cases for users on the home page, it 
is possible to embed the Case tab within a home page component using the standard 
Salesforce Case page, but without header or sidebar information.
Note this approach is not supported by Salesforce and you should 
consider this use with care as it cannot be relied upon for future use.
To save users' time and showcase information directly on the home page every time  
they access the Home tab, create this custom home page component with this recipe.

Introduction
A CRM system must be as productive as possible to justify its investment, hence, if  
there are any aspects that can be conigured and set up to be used more eficiently,  
they are usually worth exploring.
The Salesforce CRM application aims to be as eficient as possible out of the box,  
however, typically there are company-speciic business rules and process lows that  
need to be implemented.
This is where the power of the Salesforce CRM application and the Force.com platform 
becomes truly apparent.
Within the Salesforce CRM application and the Force.com platform, you can easily create 
worklow to trigger your company's unique business rules and logic.
Salesforce CRM also enables you to create complex formulae to generate data records  
as well as extend the user interface to create custom buttons that prepopulate data ields.

Creating an opportunity close date e-mail 
alert using worklow
As best practice in CRM systems, when creating sales opportunities there should always be  
a close date with which we can forecast, report, and monitor the progress of the sale.
In Salesforce CRM, the close date can be referred to in order to automatically trigger an 
e-mail that alerts the opportunity owner that the sales opportunity is nearing the scheduled 
close date.
To create this automatic sending of close date e-mail alerts, the following recipe makes use of 
a Salesforce worklow rule and e-mail alert.

the e-mail alert will be sent immediately.
Setting a default opportunity name using a 
ield update worklow
Often organizations use a naming convention when entering data in the CRM system.
Sales managers often instruct their sales team to enter the name of opportunities as a 
combination of the account name and the deal name, to help manage the processing and 
improve the readability of the opportunity record. For example, Acme Opportunity X.
This business requirement, to have an agreed format for the naming of opportunities, is a 
good example of where automation can be utilized in Salesforce CRM.

Generating a default opportunity close date 
using a ield update worklow
As best practice in CRM systems, when creating opportunities there should always be a close 
date by which to monitor the progress of the sale.
In Salesforce, the close date is a required ield but unless there is some company-speciic 
procedure, the date could be set to anything upon creation.
Often organizations instruct their sales team to set the close date to a nominal value with 
respect to the creation date of the opportunity, say the date the record was created plus  
21 days.
In order to set this default close date for opportunities in Salesforce, a worklow rule, a ield 
update, and a custom new opportunity button that calls a Visualforce page, can be created 
using this recipe.

Stopping non-system administrators from changing account names with a  
validation rule

Creating a mandatory Reason Lost ield for lost opportunities using a validation rule
Introduction
The CRM industry experts typically list poor data quality as one of the top reasons for CRM 
applications to fail to deliver. Poor data often leads to misleading, incomplete, and confusing 
information and can lead to user dissatisfaction and lack of user adoption. It is important 
that users understand that the data quality in a Salesforce CRM is not just the responsibility 
of their system administrator, but that they must also contribute to the accurate recording of 
information and understand how data quality directly affects their work.
It is also true that people make mistakes when entering data. This is where the power of the 
Salesforce CRM application and the Force.com platform becomes truly apparent. We can 
limit this source of error by building automatic validation and automatic worklow into the 
application to prevent users from making errors and cleaning up data where necessary.

Improving Data Quality in Salesforce CRM

Stopping non-system administrators  
from changing account names with a 
validation rule
Often there is a need to restrict the updating of data from users within Salesforce CRM. A 
typical example is where account records are created according to an agreed process or naming 
convention, which requires veriication by other users or systems within the organization.
In this recipe, we will construct a validation rule that prevents the changing of account name 
by users who are not logged in as system administrators.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create a validation rule:
1. Navigate to the account customization setup page, by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Customize | Accounts | Validation Rules.
2. Click on New.
Here, we are presented with the Account Validation Rule 
Edit page.
3. Type Admins Only to Update Name in the Field Label textbox (upon clicking out 
of the textbox, the name changes to Admins_Only_to_Update_Name).
4. Leave the Active checkbox ticked.
5. Optionally, set the Description ield to This validation rule is for 
stopping non-System Administrators from changing Account Names.
Navigate to the Error Condition Formula section (as 
shown in the upcoming screenshot).
6. Paste the following code:
AND( 
  ISCHANGED( Name ), 
 
  $Profile.Name <> "System Administrator"
)

In the Error Message section, enter the text Only System Administrators are 
allowed to change the Account Name.
8. In the Error Location option, select Field.
Here, we are presented with the Field selection pick list 
(as shown in the following screenshot).
9. Select the ield Account Name (as shown):
10. Finally, click on Save.

Improving Data Quality in Salesforce CRM
140
How it works...
Having logged in as a user that does not have a system administrator proile and changing the 
name of an account record, the validation rule is activated and the record is prevented from 
being saved. Upon the attempt to save, an error message is displayed below the Account Name 
ield stating Error: Only System Administrators are allowed to change the Account Name.
You can see what this looks like in the following screenshot:
Enforcing the use of two-letter account 
country codes using a validation rule
Accurate information and reports are vital in an effective Salesforce CRM system and without 
it, users and sales management cannot make informed decisions. One way to achieve 
accurate information for reporting is by ensuring that data is stored in a consistent manner.
In this recipe, we will create a validation rule to ensure that account country codes are 
entered using two letters, according to an international standard (ISO 3166), from the 
International Organization for Standardization.
How to do it...
Carry out the following step to create a validation rule:
1. Navigate to the account customization setup page, by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Customize | Accounts | Validation Rules.

Introduction
An approval process in Salesforce CRM is an automated mechanism that you can set up to 
automate and control the approval of records within your organization.
Approval processes contain a structured set of steps that are used to facilitate the review and 
action of records that match a speciied criterion where approval is required. The approval 
process also allows for the specifying of which users are to approve the record at each step.
Each step of an approval process can apply to either all records within the process or speciied 
records that have certain ield values.

Implementing Approval Processes
154
The building of approval processes involves the setting of what actions are to be taken  
after the record is either irst submitted, approved, rejected, or recalled from the approval 
process. The setup of an approval process also allows for the selective locking of the record 
during the process.
Approval processes provide you and your organization with a powerful mechanism to control 
internal processes that must be completed as part of an organization business process 
requirement. For example, setting up line manager approval for leave of absence, ensuring 
that inancial managers agree with budgets and planned expenditure, sanctioning marketing 
campaigns, or authorizing that large sales deals are acceptable to proceed.
Creating an e-mail template for use with 
approval assignments
When building approval processes for records in Salesforce CRM, it is necessary to specify the 
users that are to approve the record at each step of the approval process.
To notify these users that an approval request has been assigned to them, an e-mail is  
sent by the system. Here, you can specify a custom e-mail template to be used when  
notifying an approver.
In this recipe, we will create an e-mail template that will be used to notify users that an 
opportunity is at or above a certain amount and at a speciied stage and that the record 
requires their approval to continue through the sales process.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create an e-mail template for use with approval assignments:
1. Navigate to the new e-mail template creation page, by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Email | My Templates.
2. Select the folder My Personal Email Templates.

{!Opportunity.Account.Name} has an amount > 100k.
The opportunity is pending your review and approval as it is now 
at stage {!Opportunity.StageName}.
12. Click on Save.
Setting up a user to be associated with an 
approval process
When building approval processes for records in Salesforce CRM, it is necessary to specify the 
users who have to approve the record at each step of the approval process. We can also restrict 
the approval process for speciic users by setting an appropriate value on their user record.

Chapter 6
157
To notify these users that an approval request has been assigned to them, an e-mail is sent by 
the system. Here, you can specify that a record owner's manager is to be set as the approver 
for the record. To restrict the approval process for speciic users, you can specify that, say, only 
the sales team is to submit opportunity reviews.
In this recipe, we will edit a user record to set the value of the Manager ield to a user record 
to which approval notiications will be sent. We will also set the value of the Department ield 
to Sales which is used as one of the criterion for the triggering of the approval process.
The sales user setting is entered in the standard Department ield and the manager is set 
using the standard Manager lookup ield and these are set using this recipe.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to set up a user that is to be associated with approval processes:
1. Navigate to the user's record page, by going to Your Name | Setup | Manage Users 
| Users.
2. Edit the user's record. In this recipe, we are setting the Department ield for the user 
SVP Sales to Sales as shown in the following screenshot:

the currently assigned approver can edit records during the approval process as 
shown in the following screenshot.

Implementing Approval Processes
162
By setting Record Editability Properties as shown, you are allowing 
the approving user to make changes to the record while the record is 
flowing through the approval process. This is useful as the record will 
remain locked to every user (with the exception of the administrators 
and approvers) and will prevent the need for edits to be made 
only by system administrators as this creates additional effort for 
administrators and risks delays during the sales process.

Introduction
In this chapter, we will look at some useful ways in which to increase productivity for 
administrators and advanced users (or superusers) within Salesforce CRM. There are aspects 
of routine Salesforce functionality and maintenance that often require manual effort such as 
linking Salesforce records to external systems, presenting help pages, and deleting multiple 
records, recipes for which will be covered.
Productivity tools for administration include the mechanism to export records from Salesforce 
and be able to link those records using tools such as Microsoft Excel. Here, we look at a 
mechanism to ensure that the IDs in Salesforce can be handled correctly within these types of 
external system.

Productivity Tools for Superusers and Advanced Administration
174
We will also look at a way to build help pages within Salesforce to display context-speciic help 
information that increases users' productivity and frees administrators to concentrate on their 
tasks in hand.
Finally, we will build a routine that extends the Salesforce platform by providing a way to  
delete multiple opportunity records by selecting the appropriate records from the related 
accounts page.
Allowing users to delete multiple records may not be suitable for all 
organizations. However, this advanced recipe allows administrators to 
delete unwanted records and may also be suitable for organizations 
that allow superusers to delete records.
Converting a 15-digit Salesforce opportunity 
ID to 18 digits using a formula ield
Internal record IDs in salesforce.com, as found in all custom and standard objects such as the 
opportunity, account, contact, and so on contain 15 character text-based values.
The text values can be described as a base-62 number as each of the individual 15 characters 
can be either a numeric digit (in the range 0-9), a lowercase letter (in the range a-z), or an 
uppercase letter (in the range A-Z).
These 15 character salesforce.com values are therefore case-sensitive, since there can be 
two unique IDs which owe their uniqueness to the fact that they have a character(s) that 
differs only in case. For example, 100000000000ABC is different to 100000000000abc.
However, there are applications such as Microsoft Excel, which are not case-sensitive, 
that do not recognize the difference between the ID 100000000000ABC and the ID 
100000000000abc. This results in features such as the Excel function VLOOKUP, failing  
to match correct records from an exported salesforce.com report.
Salesforce.com realized the potential problem where the case of the source lookup value is 
not processed correctly within external applications that are not case-aware.
To provide better compatibility between salesforce.com and tools such as MS Excel, MS 
Access, and SQL Server salesforce.com has established an 18-character case-insensitive  
ID that is formed by adding a sufix to the 15 character ID, a method that respects the  
case-insensitive nature of these tools.
In this recipe, we will convert a 15-character case-sensitive ID to an 18-character  
case-insensitive ID.

Chapter 7
175
How to do it...

Generating help pages for custom objects 
using Visualforce and a PDF document
In this recipe, we will step through the process of adding a custom PDF document for the 
purpose of showing help information. This help information will then be accessible from 
appropriate custom object records to provide for context-speciic help information.
Getting ready
Create or retrieve a PDF document that contains the required help information. Here we have 
an example ile that is called HelpText.pdf.
Upload the PDF document into Salesforce as a static resource by carrying out the  
following steps:
1. Create or source a suitable PDF to be used to show help information.
2. Navigate to the Static Resources setup page, by clicking along the following path: 
Your Name | Setup | Develop | Static Resources.
3. Click on New.

var oppIdsToDelete = {!GETRECORDIDS( $ObjectType.Opportunity)};
var deleteConfirmText = 'Selected ' + oppIdsToDelete.length + ' 
Opportunities to Delete: \nAre you sure?';
// Confirm the deletion of the selected Opportunities
if ( oppIdsToDelete.length && ( window.confirm( deleteConfirmText 
) ) ) {
   // Delete the records, a function is passed to allow the  
   //current page to be refreshed
   // asynchronously after the deletion has finished.
   sforce.connection.deleteIds( oppIdsToDelete, 
     function() {
       top.location.replace( '/{!Account.Id}' );
      } 
    );
 } else if (oppIdsToDelete.length == 0) {
   alert('Please select Opportunities to Delete.');
}

19. Select the Mass Delete Opportunities button from the left-hand side, available 
buttons section and move it to the right-hand side, selected button section as shown 
in the preceding screenshot.
20. Click on OK.
Here, we are directed back to the Account Layout page that 
was selected for edit previously.
21. Click on Save.
How it works...
Whenever appropriate users navigate to an account record, they are able to access a Mass 
Delete Opportunities button on the opportunity-related lists.
By selectively choosing the opportunity records that are to be deleted, using the associated 
checkbox, and then clicking the Mass Delete Opportunities button, all of the selected records 
are removed with one click.
The solution uses a custom button that is set to handle multiple records and executes JavaScript.
The custom button works by irst invoking the Salesforce AJAX Toolkit which is a JavaScript 
wrapper around the Salesforce API. This is invoked with the code {!REQUIRESCRIPT("/
soap/ajax/26.0/connection.js")}.
The AJAX Toolkit is available for any organization that 
has API access.
The JavaScript code works by retrieving the multiple opportunity records that the user has 
selected for deletion. This is performed with the code {!GETRECORDIDS( $ObjectType.
Opportunity)};.
GETRECORDIDS is a Salesforce function that returns an array of strings 
in the form of record IDs for the selected records in a list, such as a list 
view or related list. The syntax is {!GETRECORDIDS(object_type)} 
where object_type is the reference to the custom or standard object 
for the records you want to retrieve.
The JavaScript code then checks whether there are records to be deleted and if so 
prompts for conirmation from the user to proceed. This is executed with the code if ( 
oppIdsToDelete.length && ( window.confirm( deleteConfirmText ) ) ).

Productivity Tools for Superusers and Advanced Administration
186
The window.confirm() method is a standard JavaScript method. 
The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a speciied 
message, along with an OK button and a Cancel button. This method 
returns true if the visitor clicked on OK, and false otherwise.
When the user clicks on OK, the JavaScript code invokes the Salesforce AJAX Toolkit function 
that deletes the records that have been selected. This is performed with the code sforce.
connection.deleteIds( oppIdsToDelete, .
The AJAX Toolkit allows you to issue synchronous or asynchronous 
calls. Asynchronous calls allow the client-side process to continue, 
waiting for a call back from the server. To issue an asynchronous call, 
you must include an additional parameter with the API call, referred to 
as a callback function. Once the result is ready, the server invokes the 
callback method with the result.
In our code, we are issuing an asynchronous call and using a callback function that causes 
the account detail page to be refreshed. This clears the opportunity-related list of the records 
that were deleted and is executed with the following code:
function() {
       top.location.replace( '/{!Account.Id}' );
      } 
There's more...
Carry out the following steps in order to mass delete opportunities:
1. Select an example account record that has more than one opportunity  
record associated.
2. Hover over (or navigate) to the opportunity-related list section.
Here, we now have the custom Mass Delete Opportunities button 
and an Action select all checkbox along with checkboxes to the left 
of each of the opportunities.
3. Set the checkbox for all of the opportunity records that you wish to delete.

The records will then be deleted and the account detail page is 
refreshed to conirm that the selected records are no longer present.

E-mail applications often allow a wealth of valuable information about users' business 
contacts and the communications with those contacts to be stored and managed by 
Salesforce CRM users.
Having visibility of this information within Salesforce is highly desirable by the users of 
Salesforce CRM. Additionally, users often want to continue using their e-mail applications 
alongside Salesforce and to feel conident that the two systems are automatically kept in sync.

Enabling the Email to Salesforce feature in 
Salesforce CRM
Email to Salesforce is a feature within Salesforce CRM that lets you assign e-mails to 
Salesforce records when sending messages from your external e-mail account, such 
as Outlook, Google Mail, and so on. Here, you can assign the e-mail to leads, contacts, 
opportunities, and other records in Salesforce.
When creating, forwarding, or replying to an e-mail, you simply enter your Email to Salesforce 
address in the BCC ield or any recipient ield.
The Salesforce system then receives a copy of the e-mail and, depending on your 
coniguration, adds it to either the Activity History related list of the matched record  
or to the My Unresolved Items page, where you can then manually assign it.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to enable the Email to Salesforce feature in Salesforce CRM:
1. Navigate to the Email to Salesforce setup page by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Email Administration | Email to Salesforce.
2. Click on Edit.
3. Select the Active checkbox as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 8
191
4. Optionally, select the Advanced Email Security Settings checkbox to conigure  
Email to Salesforce to verify the legitimacy of the sending server before processing  
a message.
Before enabling this option, make sure that your users' e-mail domains 
support at least one of the following protocols: SPF, Sender ID, or 
DomainKeys.
When this option is enabled, the Salesforce system uses these protocols 
to verify the legitimacy of the e-mail sender's server. If the server passes at 
least one protocol and does not fail any, the system processes the e-mail. If 
the server fails a protocol or does not support any of the protocols, then the 
Salesforce system does not process the e-mail.
5. Click on Save.
There's more...
After enabling Email to Salesforce, Salesforce creates a unique Email to Salesforce address 
for each user.
Users can view their unique Email to Salesforce address and customize their settings by 
carrying out the following steps:
1. Navigate to the Email to Salesforce setup page by going to Your Name | Setup | 
Email | My Email to Salesforce.
2. In My Acceptable Email Addresses, enter any e-mail addresses that you use to send 
e-mail (you can add multiple e-mail addresses separated by commas).
Your Email to Salesforce address only accepts e-mail from addresses 
listed here. If you do not list any e-mail addresses, the e-mail sent to 
your Email to Salesforce address will not be associated to any records.
3. Choose whether you want e-mails to be sent to My Unresolved Items so that you  
can manually assign them or whether you want the Salesforce CRM system to try  
to automatically assign them.
4. Select whether to add e-mails to opportunities, leads, and/or contacts.

5. If leads or contacts are selected, choose how Email to Salesforce is to handle lead or 
contact e-mails that match duplicate records. Email to Salesforce can add the e-mail 
activity to either: all matching records; to the oldest duplicate record or; to the record 
that has greatest number of activities.
6. If leads or contacts are selected, you can select the option If no matching records 
are found, create a task and send it to My Unresolved Items to route the e-mail to 
My Unresolved Items if no matching records are found.
If this checkbox is not selected and Salesforce cannot identify 
the To or From e-mail addresses, the e-mail will not be saved 
in Salesforce.
7. 
Select Always save email attachments to save attachments on e-mails sent  
to Salesforce.
The maximum size for an attachment is 5 MB when attached 
directly to the related list, and the size limit for all files 
attached to an e-mail is 10 MB.
8. Select Email me conirmation of association to receive a conirmation e-mail when 
e-mails are successfully associated.
9. In Excluded Domains, enter any e-mail domain you want to exclude from automatic 
association. You can add multiple e-mail addresses separated by commas.

Obtaining system requirements information 
for Salesforce for Outlook
Many users of Salesforce also have Microsoft Outlook as their e-mail application and in order 
to link Outlook data with Salesforce, salesforce.com has developed Salesforce for Outlook.
Salesforce for Outlook is an external application that installs onto the same computer as 
the Outlook application and it can be used to keep contact, event, and task records synced 
between Salesforce and Outlook.
There are a number of steps required in the setup and coniguration of Salesforce for Outlook 
which we cover in this chapter. Before attempting to set up and install Salesforce for Outlook, 
you should check that the hardware and software speciications of the users' machines—that 
you are planning for the installation—meet the following system requirements:
 
f
Microsoft Outlook 2010 (64 bit and 32 bit) or 2007 on Microsoft Exchange
 
f
Microsoft Windows 7 (64 bit and 32 bit), Windows Vista (32 bit only), or Windows XP 
(32 bit only) on Microsoft Exchange
 
f
Latest versions of hotixes for Outlook and Windows

Setting up Salesforce for Outlook 
conigurations within Salesforce CRM
Many users of Salesforce also have Microsoft Outlook as their e-mail application and in order 
to link Outlook data with Salesforce, salesforce.com has developed Salesforce for Outlook.
Salesforce for Outlook is an external application that installs onto the same computer as 
the Outlook application and it can be used to keep contact, event, and task records synced 
between Salesforce and Outlook.
A Salesforce for Outlook coniguration comprises the settings and parameters that determine 
which data users can sync between Outlook and Salesforce CRM.
Salesforce for Outlook coniguration also allows you to set up conigurations that allow users 
to edit some of their own settings.
Within the Salesforce for Outlook coniguration, you can deine which items are allowed to 
sync, which direction the data lows between Outlook and Salesforce, and what happens when 
data conlicts arise.
Salesforce for Outlook is available for the following editions: Group, 
Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, and Contact Manager 
Editions, plus Trial organizations.
You can create multiple conigurations to cater for the needs of various types of users. For 
example, a sales team might want to sync contacts, tasks, and events, while a senior manager 
might only be concerned with syncing events.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to set up Salesforce for Outlook conigurations within  
Salesforce CRM:
1. Navigate to the new Outlook Coniguration page by going to Your Name | Setup 
| Desktop Administration | Outlook Conigurations. This page is shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 8
197
2. Click on New Outlook Coniguration.
Here, we are presented with the New Outlook Configuration page. 
Complete the following details in the Basic Information section as 
shown in the upcoming screenshot.
3. Enter the name of the Outlook coniguration in the Name ield. For this recipe, type 
the text Outlook 2010 Configuration.
4. Check the Active checkbox.
5. Optionally, enter a description in the Description textbox.
6. Leave the checkbox Notify of product updates checked. When an updated version 
of Salesforce for Outlook is available, users will see a system tray notiication, which 
they can then click on to download the latest version. Users are alerted every 14 days 
until they either download the new version or hide system tray alerts.
After you define basic information for a Salesforce for Outlook 
configuration, you select the Salesforce for Outlook users that 
the configuration's settings will apply to. Complete the following 
details in the Assign Users and Profiles section as shown in the 
upcoming screenshot.
If you assign a user who is already assigned to a different 
configuration, that user is removed from the other configuration 
and assigned to this one. If an assigned user is also part of a 
profile assigned to another active configuration, the configuration 
that lists the user directly is used.

Select the users or proiles for this coniguration:
Data settings control the sync behavior and e-mail functionality 
of Salesforce for Outlook. You can define the following settings 
using the fields in the Data Settings section in a Salesforce for 
Outlook configuration. Complete the following details in the Data 
Settings section as shown in the upcoming screenshot.
8. Check the Overwrite coniguration changes made by users checkbox.
9. Check the Side Panel (Beta) checkbox to display the Salesforce side panel in 
Microsoft Outlook.

Chapter 8
199
10. Check the Add Email checkbox. This adds the Add Emails and Send and Add buttons 
to Outlook, and lets your users add up to 10 e-mails simultaneously to Salesforce.
Before activating the Add Email setting, you must first have 
enabled the Email to Salesforce feature. Email to Salesforce 
allows you to assign e-mails to leads, contacts, opportunities, and 
other records in Salesforce when e-mailing from Outlook. This is 
done by entering your Email to Salesforce address in the BCC field 
or any recipient field.
Salesforce then receives a copy of the e-mail and, depending on 
your configuration, adds it either to the Activity History related 
list of the matching records or to the My Unresolved Items page, 
where you can manually assign it.
11. Optionally, set the Create Case checkbox depending on your setup and requirements 
as shown in the following screenshot:
We now have the options to set up the syncing of contacts, 
events, and task records between Salesforce CRM and Microsoft 
Outlook. Here we can further configure settings such as sync 
direction, conflict behavior, field mappings, matching criteria, and 
modification permissions.
12. In the Contacts subsection, set the Sync Direction option as Salesforce.com  
to Outlook.
13. Here, the Conlict Behavior option defaults to Salesforce.com always wins.

14. In the Contacts subsection, leave Edit Field Mappings unchanged.
The Edit Field Mappings link allows you select fields mapping between 
Salesforce contacts and Outlook contacts. Clicking on the link presents 
the mapped fields which automatically has all standard fields mapped 
between Salesforce and Outlook. If you have any custom fields to sync, 
you can add them here.
15. In the Contacts subsection, set the If an Outlook contact matches multiple 
salesforce.com contacts, sync it with the salesforce.com contact that: pick list 
option to Has the most recent activity.
16. In the Contacts subsection, check only the Whether object is synced checkbox 
present in the Allow users to modify: section.
Salesforce.com should be set up as the system of record when 
syncing contacts with Outlook due to the issue of record ownership 
in the Salesforce CRM application. Here we may have one user who 
owns a particular contact record and another user who may also have 
this contact record in their Outlook. By setting the sync direction as 
Salesforce.com to Outlook, we can avoid duplicate contact records 
being added to Salesforce.
17. In the Events subsection, set the Sync Direction option as Sync both ways.
18. In the Events subsection, set Conlict Behavior to Outlook always wins.
19. In the Events subsection, leave Edit Field Mappings unchanged.
The Edit Field Mappings link allows you to select fields mapping 
between Salesforce events and the Outlook calendar. Clicking on the 
link presents the mapped fields which automatically has all standard 
fields mapped between Salesforce and Outlook. If you have any 
custom fields to sync, you can add them here.
20. In the Events subsection, check only the Whether object is synced checkbox present 
in the Allow users to modify: section.
21. In the Tasks subsection, set the Sync Direction option as Sync both ways.
22. In the Tasks subsection, set Conlict Behavior to Outlook always wins.
23. In the Tasks subsection, leave Edit Field Mappings unchanged.

Installing the Salesforce for Outlook 
software on a local machine
Now that we have created an Outlook Coniguration, we can download and install the 
Salesforce for Outlook software to our local machine.
Getting ready
Before proceeding with the setup and installation, you should decide which Outlook contacts 
folder you want to use for the link between Salesforce and Outlook.
If this, and the setup, is not considered appropriately, the sync 
between the two systems can result in duplicate records in either 
Outlook or Salesforce.
For this recipe, we are creating a contacts folder in Outlook speciically for the sync with 
Salesforce. We are naming the folder Salesforce and it is created in Outlook using the 
following steps:
1. Click on the Contacts icon in the left-hand side pane as shown in the  
following screenshot:
2. Click on one of the existing contact folders and then right-click on that folder to 
display the following options:

Chapter 8
205
3. Click on New Folder.
Here, we are presented with the Create New Folder dialog 
box as shown in the upcoming screenshot.
4. In the Name: text entry ield, type Salesforce.

Coniguring and Installing Salesforce for Outlook E-mail Integration
206
5. Ensure that the Folder contains: selection is set to Contact Items as shown in the 
following screenshot:
6. Click on OK.
Some further factors to consider for the setup and coniguration of the Salesforce for Outlook 
software are as follows:
 
f
The syncing method between Salesforce and Outlook
Salesforce for Outlook uses the Outlook folder to limit which records sync with 
Salesforce. If you sync only from Outlook to Salesforce, whenever users move a 
record out of the synced Outlook folder, that record is then deleted from Salesforce.
If you set up the sync to be both ways or set the sync from Salesforce to Outlook 
whenever users delete a record in Salesforce, then that record is then deleted  
in Outlook.

Chapter 8
207
If records are undeleted in Salesforce or they become available because of a change 
in sharing permissions, these records will appear in Outlook within 24 hours or when 
users manually sync using the icon shown in the system tray (described in detail 
further on).
One recommendation is to only allow syncing of contact 
information from Salesforce to Outlook. This prevents population 
of users' personal contact information in Salesforce and prevents 
accidental deletion of key Salesforce contact records.
 
f
Setting of a common time zone for users in Salesforce and Outlook
Ensure that for every user that is going to sync using Salesforce for Outlook, Windows 
has a matching time zone set on their local computer to the time zone that is set for 
their user account in Salesforce.
If the Windows time zone does not match the time zone in the 
Salesforce CRM user proile, the syncing of events will fail.
 
f
Automatic insertion of e-mails into Salesforce when your users e-mail their 
contacts in Outlook
You can set up the integration so that users' e-mails sent from Outlook are 
automatically inserted into Salesforce. The option presents an Add to Salesforce 
button from within Outlook and when activated the Salesforce for Outlook facility will 
attempt to associate e-mails to Salesforce contacts, leads, and/or opportunity records 
by checking the e-mail address that has been set using both the To and Cc ields within 
the e-mail. This is implemented using the Salesforce Email to Salesforce feature.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to install the Salesforce for Outlook software on a local machine:
1. Close Outlook.

How it works...
The lines of code that display the location of an organization using a Google Map and a 
Visualforce page can be seen in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
241
The following section describes how this set of code works.
<apex:page standardController="Account">
This is the opening tag for our Visualforce page which uses a standard Controller for the 
Account Object. This allows the page to be embedded into the Account Details page and 
access the values from the record. For example, {!Account.BillingCity}.
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/
js?sensor=false"></script>
This calls the JavaScript library that allows the Google Map functionality to appear on our  
web page:
<script type="text/javascript">
function initialize() {

Integrating Salesforce CRM with External Online Tools
242
This is the opening tag for the JavaScript function that our Visualforce page requires to call the 
Google Map code:
  var map;
  var mapOptions = {
    zoom: 13,
    mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP,
    mapTypeControl: false
  }
The preceding code sets the options for the Google Map code where:
 
f
zoom: This is used to specify the initial zoom level of the map. This value has to be an 
integer between 0 and 19 where 0 is fully zoomed out and 19 is fully zoomed in.
 
f
mapTypeId: This is used to specify the type Google Maps. This value deines what 
the initial map type would be where the options are ROADMAP (which is a normal 
map); SATELLITE (which is a  satellite image); HYBRID (which displays satellite 
images with roads and labels overlayed on it); TERRAIN (which displays a map with 
physical features such as terrain and vegetation).
 
f
mapTypeControl: This is used to specify whether the mapTypeControl will be 
displayed or not. The mapTypeControl is the control positioned in the upper-right 
corner of the map from which you can choose what map type to show. Set it to true 
to display it and to false to hide it. Note that the default value is true.
  var mapMarker;
  var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
This invokes the Google Map Geocoder object. To specify a location, Google Maps 
requires a latitude and longitude. So, our main code step will be to convert the 
physical Account Billing address into the necessary mapping format. This process  
has its own scientiic term which is geocoding.
  var address = "{!SUBSTITUTE(JSENCODE(Account.BillingStreet),'\
r\n',' ')}, " + "{!Account.BillingCity}, " + "{!Account.
BillingPostalCode}, " + "{!Account.BillingCountry}";
This formats the Salesforce Account Billing address into a format suitable for passing to the 
Google Map JavaScript library. It uses the merge ields such as {!Account.BillingCity} 
to obtain the address data elements.
This irst part which formats the Account Billing Street using the following 
{!SUBSTITUTE(JSENCODE(Account.BillingStreet),'\r\n',' ')} uses  
Salesforce functions to strip the multiline address of non JavaScript friendly characters and 
then replaces the newline characters with spaces. JSENCODE encodes text and merge ield 
values for use in JavaScript by inserting escape characters, such as a backslash (\), before 
unsafe JavaScript characters, such as the apostrophe ('). SUBSTITUTE substitutes new text 
for old text in a text string.
  geocoder.geocode( {address: address}, function(results, status) {

Chapter 9
243
This is where the actual call for the geocoding starts. The geocode method uses an object 
address as well as a callback function to give the results of the mapping attempt. The 
parameter, { address : address }, simply passes the address which we formulated 
above passed to the address object.
    if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK && results.length) {
      if (status != google.maps.GeocoderStatus.ZERO_RESULTS) {
This line handles the results of the geocoding call. After the geocoding inishes, the callback 
function is invoked with a results array and status that is used to determine success or failure.
        map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map"), 
mapOptions);
Having reached this step of the code would signify a successful geocode. Using the 
mapOptions that we speciied earlier, this line is where the map is constructed. The 
constructed map is passed to an HTML div tag which is covered further.
        map.setCenter(results[0].geometry.location);
        mapMarker = new google.maps.Marker({
            position: results[0].geometry.location,
            map: map,
            title: "{!Account.Name} " + address
        });
      }
    } else     
The line of code above sets the marker for the map and uses the Salesforce Account Name 
merge ield to set the title for the marker on the map.
        document.getElementById("map").innerHTML = "Unable to find or 
display a map for {!Account.Name}'s billing address : " + address;
This line only appears where the geocoding call failed to return a successful response and set 
the error message in the HTML div tag which is covered further below.
  });
}
</script>
<div id="map" style="width:100%;height:300px"></div>
This is the HTML div tag called map which is where either the constructed Google Map code 
or our constructed error message is rendered. Here we have set the width to be the maximum 
width of the Salesforce detail page and a height of 300px.
<script>
    initialize();

Integrating Salesforce CRM with External Online Tools
244
This is the where our Visualforce page immediately invokes the calls to the Google Map 
JavaScript libraries and the function calls as speciied above.
</script>
</apex:page>
This is the closing tag for our Visualforce page which uses a standard Controller for the 
Account Object.
The Account Google Map now appears on an Account Detail page (showing the address that is 
set in the Billing Address) for each Account record as shown in the following screenshot:
