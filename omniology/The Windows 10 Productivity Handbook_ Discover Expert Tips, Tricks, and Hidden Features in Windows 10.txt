CHAPTER 1
Getting Up to Speed with  
Windows 10
Do you dream? Do you watch people around you going about their daily tasks, and wonder how they’re able 
to achieve things you can’t, be more effective than you can be, or have more time for enjoyment? You’re not 
alone: at some point, everybody will have watched another person achieve what they would consider to be 
almost impossible.
This happens on a macro level when we see explorers heading into the vast unknowns of the Arctic 
or the Himalayas. It happens when we watch extreme sports or when someone’s latest app has just made 
them their first million at age 21. It also happens on the micro level when you visit a friend and see just how 
beautiful and colorful their garden is, or just how they’re able to prepare and cook such an amazingly tasty 
meal from exotic ingredients you’ve never heard of.
This feeling isn’t just restricted to our private lives either. In the workplace, we have all watched a 
colleague do something, manually or with their PC, that seems to elevate their own work above the people 
around them, or that saves them huge amounts of time, enabling them to do more, or to a higher standard 
than you yourself know how.
We all want to be more productive and effective at what we do. Our employers want it, our clients want 
it, and we want it for ourselves. It makes our work engaging and more understandable, while making us 
more employable and giving us greater self-esteem.
While I’m afraid I can’t help you with either cooking or gardening (much as I wish I could), I can help 
you with your use of Windows 10 at home, at college, and in the workplace.
This book is your cheat sheet, your masterclass, and your easy-to-follow guide on how to achieve those 
things on your PC that you’ve seen others do, but that you don’t have a clue how to do yourself.
■
■Note   Microsoft regularly updates and refines Windows 10, just as apps are regularly updated. This means 
that some features or functionality might look different from that described here, or may change slightly after 
a period of time. It also means that new features or functionality might be added. Fundamentally, however, 
Microsoft will not change the overall function or discoverability of the operating system or your apps.
Getting Familiar with Windows 10
Windows 10 seems like the logical place to begin this journey. It’s the workspace in which everything 
happens, the container for your apps and files, and the thing you’ll spend the vast amount of your time 
interacting with.

Chapter 1 ■ Getting Up to Speed with Windows 10 
2
Let’s begin by looking at the lock screen because it’s the first thing you see when you start your PC.  
In the center of the lock screen is your user photo or avatar, below which is a box asking you for your PIN or 
password if you have one set up on the PC (see Figure 1-1).
You can switch between different sign-in methods (PIN, password, and Windows Hello) by clicking the 
sign-in options. This can be useful because sometimes you might find Windows 10 switches to asking you for 
a password, when you’d rather sign in with a PIN.
If there is more than one user account configured on the PC, you will see a list of available users listed in 
the bottom-left corner of the lock screen. You can click a user icon to sign in to the PC as that user instead of 
the one currently shown in the center of the screen.
In the bottom-right corner of the screen are icons for your network connection (should you need to 
connect to Wi-Fi), Ease of Access (if you need to make Windows 10 easier to use when you sign in), and Power 
(so you can shut down and restart the PC directly from the lock screen).
The Windows 10 Desktop
When you sign in to Windows, you are presented with the Windows 10 desktop—what it offers and how to 
become accustomed to it. If you look at your own desktop, what do you see? You’ll very likely see the Start 
menu and the taskbar that runs across the bottom of the screen (see Figure 1-2).
Figure 1-1.  The lock screen contains useful options

Chapter 1 ■ Getting Up to Speed with Windows 10 
3
Do you see the other features that can save you time and make you more productive? Because as there 
are actually more than you might think. Pressing either the Windows icon in the bottom-right corner of the 
screen or the Windows key on your keyboard opens the Start menu. In the bottom-left corner of the Start 
menu are icons to sign out of your user account, open Settings (which I’ll cover later in this chapter), and 
restart and shut down the PC.
Figure 1-2.  The Windows 10 desktop and Start menu
Figure 1-3.  You can sign out, restart, and shut down the PC from the Start menu, see Figure 1-4

Chapter 1 ■ Getting Up to Speed with Windows 10 
4
Clicking your user or the Power icon displays a pop-up menu containing additional options from 
which you can choose. If you’re ever unsure what it what, clicking the “hamburger menu,” which is the three 
horizontal lines in the top-left corner of the Start menu displays text descriptions of what each button does.
App Tiles in the Start Menu
Most of us are used to using apps on our smartphones and tablets. Windows 10 isn’t any stranger to apps, 
having an extensive library available in the Microsoft Store. You’ll see these apps listed in the alphabetical 
app list to the left of the Start menu, but also pinned to the Start menu itself.
There are different things you can do with these apps, and several ways in which they can help you.  
At their most basic, they can act as a quick glance way to get access to information. Most apps display 
content from within the app itself, such as the details of recently received emails, calendar appointments, 
news or sports headlines, or financial information, directly on the tile itself.
The advantage of this is that you can, just through pressing the Windows key on your keyboard, check at 
a glance if there’s anything new, and if it should be opened and dealt with straightaway, or if it can wait for a 
while.
These live tiles can also help you prevent having to open and use the app itself. If you’re waiting to see 
that the shares in the company you just bought are doing when the market opens, a live tile can give you this 
information. All at the same time and in the same space on your screen as you can see the latest weather 
forecast, social media updates, private message, and more besides.
For some people, this might be considered a distraction. After all, you might have a Facebook app, or 
a sports app installed, but you don’t want to be distracted by what’s going on. By right-clicking a tile, you 
can turn the live functionality on or off (see Figure 1-4). Additionally, you can change the tile through four 
different sizes, small, medium, wide, and large, so they take up more (or less) space as you see fit, drag 
them around the Start menu to rearrange them, or even remove them from the Start menu (unpin them) 
or uninstall them altogether. All of this is achieved on the same right-click (or a touch-and-hold on your 
touchscreen device).
Figure 1-4.  You can turn live tile functionality on or off

Chapter 1 ■ Getting Up to Speed with Windows 10 
5
The Start menu itself can be customized. If you drag its top or right edges, you can make it larger of 
smaller. If you right-click the taskbar along the bottom of your screen, a taskbar settings option will appear 
(see Figure 1-5). This opens the Settings panel, in which you see customization options for the taskbar, and 
to the left of the panel, a link to customization options for the Start menu.
You can customize many different aspects of the Start menu, including your most used apps, most 
recently used apps, and suggestions for new apps—by which Microsoft mean advertisements. You can easily 
turn off these suggestions.
A Visit to the Taskbar
Beneath the desktop and Start menu sits the taskbar. You’ll probably know this as the place where the icons 
for your open apps sit, but it’s capable of being much more than that. For example, you can right-click (touch 
and hold) any icon to rampantly pin (or unpin) it from the taskbar. This can make it easier and faster to open 
the apps you want to use.
Additionally, right-clicking an icon can reveal a pop-up Jump List. This provides additional context-
sensitive functionality (see Figure 1-6). The File Explorer Jump List provides quick links to various folders on 
your PC, the Outlook Jump List contains quick links to new emails, appointments, and contacts, and an app 
Jump List can provide quick links to your most recently used files.
Figure 1-5.  You can customize the Start menu and taskbar

Chapter 1 ■ Getting Up to Speed with Windows 10 
6
Files can also be pinned to Jump Lists so that they’re always available. As you move your mouse up and 
down the list of recently opened files, you’ll see a “pin” icon appear to the right of each one. You can click 
this to pin (or unpin) any file, just as you can with apps on the Start menu. This means that crucial project or 
regularly used files are available to you with a quick click, no matter what else you’ve been doing.
To the right of the taskbar sits the system tray. You’ll recognize that this includes the clock and the 
current date. There’s more here than meets the eye, however.
You’ll see an icon that looks like a speech balloon on the very far-right side of the taskbar. This is the Action 
Center (see Figure 1-7). It contains additional quick links and all of your received and app notifications.
Figure 1-7.  On the right side of the taskbar sits the system tray
Figure 1-6.  Jump Lists provide useful additional functionality

Chapter 1 ■ Getting Up to Speed with Windows 10 
7
Each notification is grouped, so you can see all the notifications from one app together, such as received 
emails or security notifications. You can dismiss a notification by clicking the X to its top right, or by swiping 
it off your screen with your finger or mouse.
At the bottom of the Action Center are the quick actions buttons. These include some incredibly useful 
gems such as Quiet Hours, which automatically silences all audio and pop-up notifications, enabling you to 
concentrate on work or your important presentation without distraction.
The Note icon takes you directly to Microsoft OneNote so you can organize your thoughts (more on 
OneNote later in this book). A project icon can help you quickly connect to and find the right presentation 
mode for a projector.
Night Light changes the color temperature of your screen, making it less of a strain on your eyes if you’re 
working in the evening. Airplane mode enables you to quickly make your mobile device safe when you’re on 
a red-eye flight to Seattle, and Tablet mode allows you to quickly switch between keyboard and mouse, and 
touch interfaces for the desktop and your running apps.
The system tray also contains additional icons, some part of Windows, and some for your running apps. 
There are icons to display an on-screen keyboard, check the status of your network connection, and control 
the volume of your PC. Additionally, you see a small up arrow (^), which, when clicked, contains a bucket of 
hidden icons. You might find your antivirus software in here, so you can check its status, or a useful app you 
have running in the background for which you want to change the settings.
These system tray icons can be rearranged, hidden, and unhidden by simply dragging them to where 
you want them to be. You can also control them on a more granular level by opening the taskbar settings, 
as demonstrated in Figure 1-5, and navigating to the Notification area section on the taskbar settings page. 
Here you find controls to Select which icons appear on the taskbar and Turn system icons on or off.
Work Longer in Windows 10
What?! I hear you cry. You’re supposed to be helping make me become more productive and give me more 
time playing with the kids and walking the dog, and in the first chapter you’re already telling me how I can 
work for longer?!
Panic ye not, as there’s a hidden little trick with Windows apps that extends the battery life on your PC, 
enabling you to get through an entire working day without having to tether yourself to the mains, or to allow 
you the extra power you need to watch that new Netflix episode when you’re done.
Everything on a PC uses electricity, and that means on a mobile device such as a laptop or tablet, 
everything uses battery power. If you install what you might call a “traditional application” on your PC, 
which is anything and everything that doesn’t come from the Microsoft Store, it makes the processor and 
memory in the PC do stuff, which uses power.
If you minimize that application, or put it to the background so you can do something else, it’s still 
running, still doing stuff, and still using power.
However, anything that is installed from the Microsoft Store behaves differently in that when it is 
minimized or put in the background it is suspended. In this suspended state, it uses little or no power, thus 
extending the battery life of your PC.
If you use a lot of apps in windows scattered around your desktop, the PC uses more power still, as the 
graphics engine has to draw, and keep up to date, every individual window. Maximizing your apps, and only 
having your apps running full screen (i.e., filling the entire desktop) actually uses less power, as there’s less 
for the graphics processor to draw, it not having to fill in all the fiddly bits with your desktop wallpaper etc.
Overall the power savings for your PC might seem small, but used correctly they can add up to 
significant savings over the course of a day, just as can quickly pressing the Power button on your tablet, or 
closing the lid of your laptop when you pop to the coffee machine, putting the PC to sleep.
“But!” you might say, “I use Microsoft Office all the time, that’s a traditional desktop app, and not a store 
app.” Well, Microsoft Office is available in the Microsoft Store and is downloadable from the Internet. Both 
versions are identical, with identical functionality. It just so happens that the Store version enables your PC 
to be more power-efficient.

Chapter 1 ■ Getting Up to Speed with Windows 10 
8
■
■Tip   Did you know that apps installed from the Microsoft Store are more secure than traditional desktop 
applications? This is because all store apps operate within their own “sandboxed” environment, and are 
protected from interacting with the operating system in the way traditional apps can. This means that if you only 
use Store apps, or use Windows 10 S, which can only install apps from the Store, your PC will be much more 
resistant to malware infection.
Finding and Understanding Settings
Throughout this book, I’ll show you how to use different settings in Windows 10 to help you achieve more, 
and to make Windows 10 easier and more pleasant to use. It’s probably good then to start with how you 
access and use those settings. You open the Settings app (or panel) by clicking the small gear icon in the Start 
menu, just above the Power button (see Figure 1-8).
Figure 1-8.  Settings are accessed through the gear icon in the Start menu

Figure 1-9.  The Settings app separates different settings into categories
This opens the Settings app, which is organized into different categories, such as System, Devices, 
Network & Internet, and so on (see Figure 1-9). Above these category icons is a search box. You can type 
natural language search into this box to find what you’re looking for and Windows 10 is extremely good at 
helping to find you the setting you need.

Chapter 1 ■ Getting Up to Speed with Windows 10

Within the different settings, you have the following options:
• 
A switch is a small rectangular button with rounded ends that is in either an On or an 
Off state.
• 
A drop-down menu is a rectangular box that you can click to choose from a list of 
options
• 
An icon button is highlighted in color and displays a shaded background or border 
when you hover your mouse or finger over it, indicating that you can click it to obtain 
further information or settings.
• 
Links are text displayed in a highlighted color to indicate you can click them for 
further information or more settings.
Figure 1-10.  Each Settings category is laid out similarly
When you open a Settings category, you see that they are all laid out similarly with the subcategories 
of setting available to you in a list on the left side of the window, and the action settings for the currently 
selected subcategory on the right (see Figure 1-10).

Summary
Microsoft has done a very good job of making Windows 10 easy to use and generally discoverable. If you’ve 
used any other version of Windows from XP onward, you’ll find that what you want is generally where you 
expect to find it, and operates in the way that you would generally expect it to work.
Making Windows 10 work and operate as you want it to is a different matter. It’s not just a matter of what 
you can do to harness its full power and potential, and how you can use its functions and features to become 
more productive. The first thing to do is to make it an environment in which you will enjoy working, which is 
something we’ll look at in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 2
Making Your PC More  
Pleasurable to Use
You have no doubt changed the desktop wallpaper on your PC, probably many times. This means you know 
you can right-click in any blank space on the desktop to access the Personalization options. Did you know 
that’s there’s much more that you can do to make your desktop a more pleasurable space in which to work?
Personalizing the Lock Screen
Let’s start with those Personalization options. They open the Settings app (or panel), which you can 
also open by clicking the “gear” icon on the bottom left of the Start menu. On the left, you see the main 
Settings categories. Clicking the Personalization icon displays the subcategory options for the Windows 10: 
Background, Colors, Lock screen, Themes, Start [menu] and taskbar (see Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-1.  You can personalize many aspects of the Windows desktop

Chapter 2 ■ Making Your PC More Pleasurable to Use 
14
The lock screen that you see before you sign in to your account on your PC is capable of displaying 
useful information. This includes counters for up to seven apps, such as your email and messenger, of how 
many (if any) notifications are waiting for you. In addition to this, you can have one app—perhaps your 
calendar—display more detailed information.
Making Windows 10 Easier on the Eye
Microsoft Windows has always been a very easy to customize operating system, and Windows 10 no 
exception. There are a variety of ways in which you can personalize the desktop experience, and make it a 
more fun place to be.
Changing the Desktop Wallpaper
The obvious place to begin with this—as it’s the one thing most people seem to like to do—is to change the 
background wallpaper (sometimes called a screensaver, although a screensaver is a very different thing and 
no longer required in Windows 10).
In the Personalization ➤ Background Settings are easy and simple-to-use options for selecting a 
personalized desktop wallpaper. You can choose from one of the preselected wallpapers, or browse for a 
graphic or photograph on your PC.
If you find the wallpaper or photo doesn’t fit properly on your screen, and you have black or colored 
bans to the left and right, or top and bottom of the image, click the Choose a fit drop-down menu. Here you 
can play safely with the various options (Fill, Fit, Stretch, Tile, Center, Span) until you get the wallpaper 
looking the way you want it to.

Chapter 2 ■ Making Your PC More Pleasurable to Use 
15
Figure 2-2.  You can choose how color affects your desktop and apps
Changing Colors
If you prefer adding a little more color to your desktop, there are a couple of ways you can do it. In 
Personalization ➤ Colors you can choose from a variety of accent colors for your desktop, Start menu, 
taskbar, and apps. It’s worth scrolling down to the bottom of the Colors settings. Here you find additional 
options, such as turning on transparency effects, which mostly affect the Start menu and Action Center, but 
that can also make some apps much more pleasurable to use, and you can choose to show or hide the accent 
color on the Start menu, taskbar, Action Center, and the title bars of open apps (see Figure 2-2).

Chapter 2 ■ Making Your PC More Pleasurable to Use 
16
Right-clicking in a blank space on the desktop, and then clicking the Display settings link on the context 
menu that appears, enables you to activate the Night Light feature I mentioned earlier, where each evening 
you can have the color temperature of the PC change, causing less strain on your eyes and ultimately making 
it easier for you to sleep afterward.
Figure 2-3.  You can customize Windows 10 with themes
Furthermore, if that’s not enough for you, you can customize Windows 10 with Themes, and you’ll find 
the link to these in the Personalization settings panel. You can customize different aspects of the desktop 
environment, such as sounds, colors, and your mouse cursor, or you can download themes from the 
Microsoft Store (see Figure 2-3). There are hundreds, probably thousands by the time you read this, of these 
themes, all of which can help you customize your desktop to look and feel the way you would like it to.

Chapter 2 ■ Making Your PC More Pleasurable to Use 
17
Additional categories on the left side of the panel, allow you to easily configure Notifications, the Action 
Center, when the PC goes to sleep, the way that Tablet mode operates, and more.
People tend to think the purpose of the Accessibility features in Windows is to help people who have 
cognitive, physical, visual, or auditory needs. What would you say if I told you that there are features in the 
Windows’ Ease of Access settings that can make PCs easier to use for many people—perhaps even you. If you 
want to know more about making Windows 10 easier to use, my book, Windows 10 Accessibility Handbook 
(Apress, 2015), is available to buy at http://pcs.tv/2xwy2oo and from all good booksellers.
Figure 2-4.  You can change the scaling and size of text
Making Text and On-Screen Items Easier to Read and Use
If you find text small and difficult to read on your screen, adjusting the Text Scaling option can make it much 
easier to see and read (see Figure 2-4). Also, if you work with multiple monitors (many people do), this is 
where you’ll find all the controls that you need. You can determine things such as which icons appear on 
what taskbar, and on which screens the taskbar appears.

Chapter 2 ■ Making Your PC More Pleasurable to Use 
18
The feature that can sound a tone when you press the Caps Lock, Number Lock, or Scroll Lock keys 
can be more useful still. Imagine how helpful it would have been to hear a beep every time you accidentally 
pressed Caps Lock when you didn’t intend to.
You can also use the Filter Keys option to ignore, or slow down the repeated keystrokes that can occur if 
you hold a key down for just a little too long.
Figure 2-5.  Many Ease of Access options can be used by general PC users
Alongside the Narrator, Magnifier, and High Contrast options are some that are more generally 
useful. The Keyboard options for example (see Figure 2-5), contain the ability to make two and three key 
combinations, such as Ctrl+C (Copy), Ctrl+V (Paste) and Ctrl+Alt+Del easier to use by allowing you to only 
press one key at a time.

Chapter 2 ■ Making Your PC More Pleasurable to Use 
19
A Notification option also allows you to change the default time popup notifications appear from 5 
seconds to 5 minutes, perhaps making them easier to read, especially if you have to pop away from the PC a 
lot, or if find them distracting, for which there is also the Quiet Hours feature.
If you, like many people, sometimes find the mouse cursor in your documents difficult to find, you can 
make it larger. You can also choose a visual notification, such as flashing the current window when an alert 
or notification is received, useful if you work in a noisy environment, such as a factory or call center.
Features that can make your PC easier to use aren’t just limited to the Ease of Access panel. The Night 
Light feature that I mentioned earlier, which changes the color temperature of the screen, making it more 
yellow in appearance, can sometimes help people with dyslexia to read what’s on the screen more easily.
What’s more, enabling Tablet mode all the time spaces out icons, and makes some icons larger, so they 
are easier to find and click. This happens in both the desktop environment and in many apps as well.
Figure 2-6.  Additional Ease of Access options can help almost anybody
In the Other options controls (see Figure 2-6), you can choose to disable desktop and window 
animations, which some people can find distracting, or to hide the desktop wallpaper altogether.

Chapter 2 ■ Making Your PC More Pleasurable to Use 
20
You might find that the Dark theme makes the PC easier to use, or you may just prefer it. Note here that 
apps have their own settings for a Dark theme (if they support it). Look for the Settings icon (the cog) within 
the app itself.
Lastly, and again in the Color settings, there is the option to use or disable the Transparency effects in 
Windows 10. Some people find these effects a distraction, but they can quickly be switched off if you wish.
Changing Region Settings for the PC
PCs are used all across the world, and people work right around the world. You might be an American 
working in the Middle East, or a South Korean in the heart of Europe. Either way, unless you’re using the 
laptop or the tablet that you brought with you, you’ll find yourself faced with local language, date, and 
number settings for the country you find yourself in.
Figure 2-7.  You can switch between light and dark windows themes
If you want something different for your desktop, and for apps and Windows features, you can enable 
Dark mode in the Colors settings of the Personalization options (see Figure 2-7).

Chapter 2 ■ Making Your PC More Pleasurable to Use 
21
It’s also in the Date & time settings that you can change your current location and time zone, and add or 
remove additional language packs on the PC.
■
■Tip   In the modern Internet age, we all value what little privacy we still have. Companies and scammers are 
always trying to obtain data about us, and this does include Microsoft. The Privacy settings let you take overall 
control of this, however. You can switch off almost everything, Microsoft still need some very basic metrics so 
that Windows Update can work, but this does include switching off information that is collected by, or passed to 
advertisers, through apps.
The Location settings can also help protect your privacy if you do not use apps on your PC, such as mapping, 
that need to know where you are. Lastly, the Camera and Microphone settings prevent apps from recording 
unless you specifically want them to.
Figure 2-8.  You can adjust regional settings for your PC
The Date & time settings can be used to adjust these features in the operating system to better suit your 
own needs (see Figure 2-8).

Chapter 2 ■ Making Your PC More Pleasurable to Use 
22
Syncing your settings like this can be an enormous time saver, especially when it comes to saving an 
Internet bookmark on one PC, and then wanting access to it on another.
It’s worth noting that a company or organization may sync your settings and preferences automatically 
on their server, thus not requiring you to have a Microsoft account to sign in to the PC, or they may block this 
functionality for security reasons.
Summary
In this chapter, I’ve only just scratched the surface of what you can do to customize your desktop and 
app experience, to make working on your PC more pleasurable. I encourage you to play around with the 
customization options you find either when you right-click the desktop, taskbar, or in the Start menu, or that 
can be found in the Settings panel (by clicking the cog icon in the bottom-left corner of the Start menu).
In the next chapter, we’ll look at some of the productivity-focused features of Windows 10, such as the 
Cortana digital assistant, how you can work with and manage multiple windows and apps on your desktop 
simultaneously, and how you can use pen and ink support to its best effect.
Figure 2-9.  You can sync settings across your Windows 10 PCs and devices
That Syncing Feeling
So you’ve set up and personalized your PC the way you want it. But now you have to go and do it all over 
again on your other Windows 10 PCs and devices, right? Actually, no, but only if you signed in to the PC 
using a Microsoft account. Opening Accounts in the Settings panel, and then clicking Sync your settings 
allows you to synchronize your settings, themes, passwords, browser favorites, language settings, and 
wallpaper across to all the other PCs on which you also sign in using the same Microsoft account  
(see Figure 2-9).

CHAPTER 3
Achieving More with Windows 10
It’s clear that there’s much that you can configure in Windows 10. There are many features that you can 
utilize that can make your working environment more pleasant. And we all know that a pleasant working 
environment is one in which most people do their best work.
It doesn’t end there, though. What I detailed in Chapters 1 and 2 can be considered the “low-end” 
features and enhancements. There’s much more that Windows 10 can do to make your working life easier, 
simpler, and more productive.
Cortana: Much More Than a Personal Assistant
People can tend to think of digital personal assistants, such as Siri and Cortana, as that thing you’re 
embarrassed to talk to on your smartphone while you sit in a café. While this is largely true, and I don’t like 
to be seen talking to my phone in public any more than the next person, Cortana is actually much more 
than this.
If you click the Cortana icon on your taskbar, you are shown that you can ask Cortana to perform acts, 
such as changing the time of your afternoon appointment, finding the value of a stock price or showing you 
what films are playing nearby. All of these are useful, but are geared around speaking to Cortana. Clicking 
the Notebook icon on the left of the Cortana window details a full range of ways in which Cortana can be 
customized, and information about things she can do (see Figure 3-1).

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
24
Cortana can be programmed with your home and work locations in the About me settings (you can 
also set these locations in the Windows 10 Maps app). Doing so can allow Cortana to provide you with 
information about traffic and transport issues, and allow her (I hate calling Cortana an “it”) to offer help and 
support based on where you are, thus doing so more intelligently.
Intelligent Reminders
Allowing Cortana access to your email, calendar, and messaging history (primarily through Skype or 
Microsoft Teams) can allow her to offer support and reminders based on what’s going on, and who 
contacts you.
Figure 3-1.  Cortana is highly configurable

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
25
If, for example, someone contacts you to suggest a meeting at 3pm on Friday, and you have an 
appointment at the dentist at that time, Cortana can give you a gentle nudge, allowing you to suggest an 
alternative time or day.
As another example, if you emailed the boss (assuming you’re not already the boss) saying that you’d 
have the quarterly sales report for them by Wednesday afternoon, Cortana offers to set a reminder for the 
event, so you don’t forget.
Reminders can also be location-based, meaning you can set a reminder to buy flowers for your partner 
when you’re next in the city center, put the trash out when you get home, or call Tricia when you arrive in 
Vancouver.
For other people who use Cortana, you can set reminders based on their own proximity, such as 
reminding you to tell Phil about the special offer on the hotel he wanted to book when you’re next with him. 
Cortana knows when you’re both in the same place, and pops up a nudge.
Cortana can even integrate with the Windows 10 desktop Sticky Notes, offering to help when you type 
something, such as a web address, date, or phone number.
What’s perhaps more useful, and less intrusive in the eyes of some people, is that Cortana can scan your 
email for information, such as deliveries and flights. It can then automatically create calendar events and 
optional reminders for them, and assist you with parcel and flight tracking.
Connected to Everything
Cortana isn’t just about what’s happening on your PC, and your email. It can be connected to other devices 
and services. For example, if you set a reminder or alert on your PC, but you’re not at that PC when the time 
comes, the alert will be triggered on the device you’re using. This could be your laptop, tablet, or smartphone 
(Cortana is supported on both iOS and Android, so look for the Cortana app in the store).
You can connect Cortana to your Office 365 account, Dynamics CRM system, LinkedIn, and more 
through the Connected Accounts settings. Additionally, Windows Store apps can plug themselves into 
Cortana, enabling you to more easily control them. There are many apps that support this functionality, 
including Uber, Netflix, and Fitbit.
Then There’s Everything Else
Naturally, Cortana can tell you about the weather, offer recipe advice, and tell you about nearby restaurants, 
just as you can with other personal digital assistants. She can also allow you dictate, and easily send and 
respond to different types of message including SMS, email, and instant messages (where they’re supported 
by the message service’s app). Cortana can also connect to your Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as 
lighting, security system, and so forth.
Microsoft is expanding the features and functionality of Cortana all the time, so it’s worth checking her 
out occasionally to see if any new options have appeared. In the meantime, and in your quiet moments of 
downtime, try asking her to tell you a joke, sing you a song, or even speak Klingon.
Windows Ink
Two-in-One hybrid devices, such as the Microsoft Surface Pro, are becoming more and more popular, 
especially in the boardroom, as they allow you to have a device with a pen on which you can scribble notes, 
and work in a way that can (for some people at least) be more natural than using a keyboard and trackpad or 
mouse.
Naturally, for a company that makes professional-grade touchscreen PCs, the Windows Ink system is 
well-thought-out and integrated into many aspects of the operating system and its apps.

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
26
In the system tray to the right of the desktop taskbar, there is an icon on touchscreen devices for the 
Windows Ink Workspace. This pop-out panel includes quick links to some of the things that you can do with 
your pen or stylus (see Figure 3-2). Note that if you don’t see the Windows Ink Workspace icon, right-click 
the taskbar, and click the Show Windows Ink Workspace option.
In addition to writing in Sticky Notes, or using the Sketchboard or Whiteboard apps, or annotating notes 
in OneNote, you can draw on and annotate your PC’s screen and send a screenshot to a friend or colleague.
The Microsoft Edge web browser, which comes with Windows 10, has a pen annotation icon to the 
right of the address bar. This allows you to annotate, highlight, snip, and share web pages easily  
(see Figure 3-3).
Figure 3-2.  The Windows Ink workspace can be triggered from the system tray

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
27
There’s plenty more you can do in the Edge browser as well, including highlighting some text and then 
right-clicking it (a touch and hold works as well), or right clicking an image and asking Cortana to give you 
more information about it.
■
■Tip   If you need to access international characters on your PC, but you don’t want to open the Character 
Map utility, or try to remember the keyboard shortcuts for them, open the on-screen keyboard from the system 
tray. Then, when you touch and hold any letter, all the international characters and symbols related to that letter 
appear in a pop-up window from which you can select them.
Snap!
How many windows do you have open on your desktop at any one time? One? Two? Four? Eight? More? 
In the past, managing our desktop workspace was solved by using a multi-monitor setup of two or three 
screens; and more recently, by purchasing a monitor with a higher resolution, such as 4K or even 5K. I use 
a 21:9 aspect ratio curved ultrawide monitor (primarily for playing Elite: Dangerous) and I can thoroughly 
recommend them if for no other reason than spreadsheets look amazing (Easy now, Ed.). In Windows 10, 
however, none of this is actually necessary, as you can manage your windows and apps on any type and size 
of screen.
Snap is a feature that works with any windows on your desktop, even ones you have minimized. You 
can drag any window to the left, the right, or any of the four corners of the screen, and a glass-effect outline 
shows you that the windows are snapped there when you release it. This means you can snap two or even 
four different windows simultaneously, making them easier to see and access.
Figure 3-3.  You can annotate web pages in the Edge browser

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
28
Additionally, when you snap a window, if you have other apps open on your desktop (including 
minimized apps), you are presented with a thumbnail view of those apps (see Figure 3-4). Clicking or 
tapping one causes it to automatically expand to fill the remaining space on your screen.
When you have the windows snapped on your screen, they can be dynamically resized, with windows 
taking all of the strain out of the process. If you move your mouse to the join between two apps, a black bar 
appears. You can drag this bar to resize one app, with the other snapped app automatically expanding or 
contracting to fill the remainder of the space (see Figure 3-5). This can be very useful if you are working on a 
document while referring to reference material, as an example.
Figure 3-4.  Snap is an effective way to manage your apps

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
29
It’s worth pointing out, as you might be wondering, that when you unsnap any app, by dragging it away 
from the edge of the screen, it always returns to the same size and shape it was before you snapped it.
■
■Tip   You can control snap through some quick keyboard shortcuts. Use the Windows key + the Left arrow 
or the Right arrow to snap the currently selected window to the left or right of the screen. To move the snapped 
window to the top or bottom corner, use the Windows key + the Up or Down arrow keys.
Additionally, you can use the Windows key + the Up or Down arrow keys to maximize, minimize, or restore the 
currently selected window.
Working with Virtual Desktops
The Task View virtual desktop feature in Windows 10 is something that I’m fond of calling “boss mode,” 
because, let’s be honest, it’s a good way to play Candy Crush or shop on eBay, and be able to instantly switch 
back to a desktop with only your customer relations manager or accounting software when your boss comes 
into the room.
Think of it as the feature that Simon Pegg’s character, Benji Dunn, uses when he’s playing Halo on 
his office PC in Mission: Impossible 5; he’s instantly able to switch back to his CIA analytics software when 
someone approaches. This is something that I’m certain happens every day in the real world.
Now I’m not encouraging you to sneak an Xbox controller into the office, or to spend the day looking 
at garden furniture, but I’m sure you take my point about how the Task View feature can be used to create 
separate and distinct working environments on your PC.
Figure 3-5.  You can dynamically resize snapped windows

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
30
Task View is activated from the icon on the taskbar that looks like three small rectangles, and it allows 
you to create, close, and manage “virtual” desktops (see Figure 3-6).
When you create a new desktop, you can use the Task View button to switch between it and any other 
desktops that you have created; the icon to create a new desktop sits near the bottom right of your screen, 
and the desktops appear as live thumbnails in the bottom center.
This means that you can organize your open apps so that they’re not all running in the same space. You 
might want, for example, an Excel spreadsheet full screen on one desktop, while keeping Microsoft Teams 
and Outlook separate on another desktop.
You can control Task View directly from keyboard shortcuts as well. Windows key + Ctrl + D will create 
a new virtual desktop and switch to it, and the Windows key + Ctrl + F4 will close the current virtual desktop. 
You can also use the Windows key + Ctrl + the left and right arrow keys to switch (left and right) between 
virtual desktops.
While there is no keyboard shortcut to move an app from one virtual desktop to another, you can 
achieve this by opening the Task View… view, and right-clicking the app that you want to move. A context 
menu then appears, in which you see a Move to option (see Figure 3-7).
Figure 3-6.  Task View can be used to configure multiple desktops

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
31
You will notice in this context menu are options to Show this window on all desktops and to Show 
windows from this app on all desktops. These options might prove useful to you.
Additionally, in the Task View… view, if you mouse over one of the virtual desktop thumbnails a close 
icon will appear. If you close a virtual desktop that has open apps on it, those apps won’t be closed. Instead, 
they’ll be moved to an adjacent desktop.
Pick Up Where You Left Off with Timeline
There are many advantages to using Windows Store apps in Windows 10 over the more traditional win32 
desktop apps. For starters, they’re easier to install and update. They don’t use as much battery power on 
your laptop, tablet, or 2-in-1 device because there’s no system tray updater to run in the background, and 
because the app is suspended when it’s not the one in use in the foreground on your desktop. Additionally, 
they include functionality that win32 apps simply can’t provide.
A feature that isn’t in Windows 10 at the time of writing, but it is well worth mentioning because it could 
be in the operating system by the time you read this (it is definitely coming), is the ability to begin work in 
an app on one device and continue it later on a different device from exactly the point where you left it. This 
feature uses the cloud, your company network, or a Bluetooth connection to enable your different Windows 
10 apps to “talk” to each other, transferring details of your currently open file(s) and their status when you 
stop working on one device, and move to another, where Cortana asks you if you want to pick up where you 
left off.
Timeline works on Windows 10, Cortana-enabled iOS, and Android devices to help you work seamlessly 
across all the devices you use. Imagine, closing your laptop lid when you’re half way through a creating 
a presentation, then picking up that work on your desktop back in the office the moment you get there. 
Or having some browser tabs open on your smartphone, with your web browser on your desktop PC 
automatically opening those same tabs for you when you use it.
Figure 3-7.  You can move apps between virtual desktops

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
32
Timeline is strictly an opt-in feature, and it needs to be actively built-into Windows Store apps to work. 
When it is released, it will be included with the Windows Store versions of Microsoft Office and may well be 
built into the next version of Office 365, coming in mid- to late 2018. Options will be available in the app’s 
settings if the app supports this feature. You will be able to find out more about, and control Timeline by 
searching for it in the Settings app or in Cortana.
Managing Printers in Windows 10
I was still at school when technologists first began talking about the “paperless office.” The idea being that 
we’d be able to do everything digitally on our computers, and there would be no need for printing in offices, 
homes, and workplaces any more.
Sadly, the truth is very different as we’re still printing every bit as much as we used to. Sometimes, this is 
because we simply don’t trust that we’ll be able to present or read a digital copy of a document; sometimes, 
it’s because we know we’ll have to scrawl all over it; sometimes, we need to read it on the train on the way 
home or on the way to a meeting; and sometimes, it’s because the businesses or organizations we work with 
just haven’t moved their systems to digitized structures yet.
There’s still a lot that we do almost entirely electronically, as your local post office will testify with a 
grumble, but you won’t find a home or business anywhere that doesn’t still have at least one printer in 
regular use.
Managing those printers can be a pain, especially as the majority of PCs these days are mobile devices, 
such as laptops, 2-in-1 hybrids, or tablets. It’s just annoying sending something to a printer to discover it’s 
the wrong printer you sent it to, and nothing has appeared in the paper tray.
In the settings app, under Devices ➤ Printers & scanners, is the list of printers that are installed on the 
PC. You can click the Manage button to view its print queue, remove its driver, or set it as the default printer. 
Below the list of printers is a check box that you might find useful.
Let Windows manage my default printer (see Figure 3-8) allows Windows 10 to change the default 
printer based on the location you find yourself in. Note that you’ll need to have Location services enabled 
in the privacy options for this work, but it can help make sure you get more accurate default printers so that 
when you’re at home, or in the office, anything you send to be printed will automatically go to the correct 
printer.

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
33
This feature works by tying the default printer to the network you’re connected to at the time. Whenever 
you switch to using another of your known networks, Windows automatically detects that you used a 
different printer last time you were connected, and make the default printer change for you.

One of the biggest issues facing mobile workers is a lack of available storage space for your files and 
documents. My own laptop comes with a 512GB solid state disk (SSD), of which Windows 10 and my apps 
occupies about 20% of it, but my entire stored library of documents, photos, music, and video that’s backed 
up in the cloud is almost 1TB, double the capacity of the laptop when the SSD is empty.
When you connect to OneDrive or OneDrive for Business, you can choose what files from the cloud are 
also stored on your PC. Each file that’s backed up to OneDrive has an icon overlaid on its thumbnail image 
in File Explorer. These icons (see Figure 3-9), signify if the file is located in the cloud only, in the cloud and 
on your PC, or if it’s just in the cloud but currently being downloaded and synced.
Figure 3-8.  You can set default printers for different locations

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
34
The upshot of Files On-Demand is that you are always able to see thumbnail images of all the files 
and documents that you have stored on OneDrive or OneDrive for Business on your PC; they are only 
downloaded and stored locally if you specify this in the OneDrive Settings (right-click the cloud icon in the 
system tray) or when you open a downloaded file, it is thereafter stored locally on the PC.
Using OneDrive File Versioning
Another useful feature that’s coming to Windows 10 in the near future, but that’s not available as I write this, 
is File Versioning using OneDrive. Sometimes you’ll be working on a file and make changes that you didn’t 
intend to make, or you’ll delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete. It happens, especially if like me, you’re 
fond of pressing Ctrl+S (Save) regularly, or using Shift+Del to bypass the recycle bin when deleting files.
OneDrive’s file versioning tool allows you to recover previous versions of files on your PC in two ways. 
The first is by right-clicking a file, which presents the Restore Previous Versions option. Clicking this option 
presents a list of all the backed up versions of the file that exist in the cloud (you don’t need to have them 
backed up locally) from which you can choose one to restore.
Figure 3-9.  OneDrive in Windows 10 allows you to only store files locally as you need them

Chapter 3 ■ Achieving More with Windows 10
35
It’s not yet known how File Versioning will work, or exactly what the feature will end up being called, but 
it’s worth looking out for when major updates to Windows 10 are delivered to your PCs.
Summary
There are so many cool and great ways to achieve more with Windows 10; some of which are so cool that 
they’re worth mentioning here, even though they’ve been officially announced, they won’t appear in 
Windows 10 until sometime late in 2018. Cortana on her own is an incredibly powerful, flexible, and useful 
assistant. It’s well worth playing around with Cortana to see what she can do, and check in with her when 
there’s a major update to Windows 10 to see what’s been added.
While there’s much you can do with Windows 10 to boost your productivity that’s not the end of it by 
any stretch. There are a whole host of tips and tricks you can use to get even more productivity benefit from 
your PCs and Windows 10 devices, and in the next chapter that’s what I’ll show you.

CHAPTER 4
Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks
I don’t think there’s any doubt so far that there are a huge number of features included in Windows 10 that 
you can use to help boost your productivity and the enjoyment of using your PCs and devices. It doesn’t end 
there because there are a wide variety of smaller tools and features that can also help make your workday 
more pleasurable.
Shake It All About!
How many windows do you have open on your desktop at any one time? It’s very common for people to 
having as many as ten or more windows open. When you need to concentrate on one specific app or task, 
though, this clutter can make it difficult to concentrate.
A quick workaround is to grab the top of the window that you need to concentrate on, and give it a good 
shake. This causes all the other windows on your desktop to minimize. Don’t worry, when you want those 
windows back, shake the app again and they’ll all reappear just as they were before.
■
■Tip   Sometimes shaking the mouse can be annoying, especially if you have motor or reflex problems, or 
if you just find it difficult using a mouse. The ability to disable shake has not been built into the Settings panel 
at the time of writing (although it may be worth searching for it in the future in the Ease of Access ➤ Mouse 
options).
Search in the Start menu for the Control Panel. From there open the Ease of Access Center, and then click Make 
the mouse easier to use. You see a check box that enables you to Prevent windows from being automatically 
arranged when moved to the edge of the screen. This disables shake, but bear in mind that it also disables the 
snap feature.
Taking a Quick Peek
While we’re on the subject of having many apps and windows open at once, you may also have many 
running apps minimized to the taskbar. If you want to check an app, hover your mouse over its taskbar 
icon— a thumbnail image of the app will pop up (see Figure 4-1). If you then move your mouse over the 
thumbnail image, the full app will appear on your desktop, and all the other windows are temporarily 
hidden.

Chapter 4 ■ Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks
38
■
■Tip   In previous versions of Windows, you might remember that you could click the far right edge of the 
taskbar to make all of your windows become transparent, so you could see any widgets of sticky notes that you 
have placed on the desktop. This feature still exists in Windows 10, although it is disabled in some versions.
To activate it, right-click the taskbar and from the menu that appears, open the settings. Here you can disable or 
enable the options to Use peek to preview the desktop when you move your mouse to the Show desktop button 
at the end of the taskbar.
Keeping Things Quiet
Nothing is more annoying than pop-up alerts and messages bugging you when you’re trying to concentrate; 
although as I’m writing this (as it often happens when I write), there’s some quiet Jean-Michel Jarre playing 
in the background.
Figure 4-1.  You can peek at previews of minimized apps

Chapter 4 ■ Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks
39
Figure 4-2.  You can enable quiet hours in Windows 10
Windows 10 offers a feature called Quiet hours, which is activated from the quick actions buttons in the 
Action Center (see Figure 4-2). Clicking the Quiet hours button automatically silences all notifications and 
pop-up alerts.

Chapter 4 ■ Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks
40
It’s well worth spending a little time configuring what apps are, and are not allowed to pester you with 
alerts. As an example, you’re probably going to check your social media and messaging feeds several times 
a day, so do you really need them to alert you immediately upon receipt of a message or other notification, 
or can these wait for a short while so you can press on with something else? It’s all a matter of personal 
preferences and priorities, and it’s worth considering when configuring notifications and alerts.
Figure 4-3.  You can manage what apps display alerts and pop-up menus
Additionally, you can configure what apps are allowed to display pop-up alerts and notifications, 
and disable those you don’t want to see. You can do this in the Settings panel, by clicking System ➤ 
Notifications & actions, where you see a list of apps that can display notifications; each has an on/off 
switch (see Figure 4-3).

Chapter 4 ■ Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks
41
One thing to bear in mind when configuring your quick actions buttons is that if you are using a laptop 
or tablet, and you travel frequently, it might be worth putting Airplane mode (Flight mode in some countries) 
near the top of the list. Conversely, on a desktop, you can deprecate this and perhaps other buttons, such as 
Tablet mode and Mobile hotspot, if you see them in the list.
Figure 4-4.  You can customize your quick actions buttons
Manage Your Quick Actions Buttons
While we’re on the subject, you can customize your quick actions buttons by opening the Settings panel and 
clicking System ➤ Notifications & actions, where you will see an option to Add or remove quick actions. The 
panel allows you to drag-and-drop quick actions icons onto its 4×4 grid, so you can have the buttons that you 
use and need the most where you want them to be (see Figure 4-4).

Chapter 4 ■ Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks

Figure 4-5.  Cortana provides filters for searching files and documents on your PC
Smart Search
We all need to search our PCs for files and documents, and search online for—well, just about everything. 
I’ll cover search in much more depth in Chapter 3, but to summarize here, Cortana has some clever search 
functionality built-in that can help you define the parameters of your search effectively. When you begin 
typing in Cortana, you see some icons and a Filters option appear at the top of the search results window 
(see Figure 4-5).

Chapter 4 ■ Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks
43
You can choose from the options available, such as date modified or kind, or you can type a search 
command directly into the search box. This is called Advanced Query Syntax and I have included a full list of 
all the search commands available in Windows 10 in Appendix D at the end of this book.
The Icons allow you to specify your search is for installed apps on the PC, documents, or if you want 
to search online. Additionally the filters allow you to specify what type of document to search for, such as 
videos or music. Below these options in the Filters section is a button to Change where Windows searches. 
You can use this option to add (or remove) search locations, which can be especially useful if you are storing 
documents on a disk that is not automatically indexed by Windows.
File Explorer also includes a search box (near its upper-right corner). If you click here, a search tab 
opens on the ribbon, where you have some advanced searching options (see Figure 4-6).
Figure 4-6.  File Explorer contains advanced search options

Chapter 4 ■ Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks
44
■
■Tip   If you regularly search for the same thing in File Explorer, you can click the Save search button to save 
that search so you can use it again (see Figure 4-8). This saves the search to your [Username] ➤ Searches 
folder, although you can choose to save it to another location if you wish, such as your desktop. Every time you 
run the search, it automatically and dynamically updates to include and reflect any new and changed files and 
documents that are relevant.
Figure 4-7.  You can use Advanced Query Syntax to search your PC
At first, this might seem complex, but Windows 10 helps you with your search; for example, if you type 
Kind: in the search box to search for a specific type of file, you get a drop-down menu with valid options from 
which you can choose. This context menu changes according to the search term that you type (see Figure 4-7). 
Search in Windows 10 is covered in more depth in Chapter 3.

Chapter 4 ■ Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks
45
Managing Battery Life and Background Apps
In Chapter 1, I detailed some of my top tips for maximizing the battery life on your laptop or tablet, but there 
are also finer and more granular controls available. Open the Settings panel and click System ➤ Power & 
sleep. You’ll be faced with the options to change when the screen turns off and when the PC goes to sleep.
The Additional power settings link opens more options. Here you can choose the action of the Power 
button, such as enable and disable features like Sleep and Hibernate (see Figure 4-9).
Figure 4-9.  You can change additional power settings
Figure 4-8.  You can save searches in Windows 10

Chapter 4 ■ Productivity Boost Tips and Tricks
46
■
■Note   What is the difference between Sleep and Hibernate? Sleep keeps the memory of the PC intact, so 
you can start working again extremely quickly when you return to your PC. This does use power, however, so 
the Hibernate option writes the contents of the PC’s memory to the hard disk, enabling it to stop using power. 
Once a PC has been in sleep mode for the few hours it automatically hibernates to save the battery.
Additionally you can create power plans for the PC, so you can more easily control the power usage of 
the PC. Doing so also allows you to Change advanced power settings in which there are options to control 
when devices such as your hard disk or USB devices are powered down.
Using the Mobility Center
On a laptop or tablet, the Mobility Center, which is most easily accessed from the pop-up menu that appears 
when you press the Windows key + X, is a great place from which to control your display brightness, volume, 
battery options, and screen rotation. It’s also where you activate Presentation mode (see Figure 4-10).
Presentation mode silences pop-up alerts and notifications (as the Quiet hours feature does), but it 
also prevents the screen from turning off or the PC going to sleep or into hibernation when you are using it 
during presentations.
Summary
Clearly, there are a multitude of features and utilities in Windows 10 that you can use to enhance your 
productivity and to make the desktop a more pleasant environment in which to work.
We’re still not done, though, because in the next chapter, we’ll look at how you can maximize your 
Windows experience. In Chapter 6, we’ll examine how you can search for files, documents, folders, 
messages, and people online. I’ll bring together what we’ve covered so far, and look at how we can organize 
our desktops and PCs to create an optimal working environment.

CHAPTER 5
Maximize Your Windows 
Experience
So far in this book, I’ve shown you a whole raft of features and utilities that you can use to help you become 
more productive when using your PC, and to help you enjoy the experience more. Individually they can 
perhaps seem quite complex and daunting, so I want to spend some time looking at how all of this fits 
together, so you can create a cohesive working experience, and how you can use some of the more useful 
features in more depth.
Getting Your Day Started
Your day starts at the lock screen (see Figure 5-1). Bleary-eyed you’ll stare at it for a few seconds before 
dismissing it, and signing in to start another dreary day. Well, this might be exaggerating the point somewhat 
but I’m sure you know what I mean. The lock screen is just an artificial barrier between you and your 
working environment.

Chapter 5 ■ Maximize Your Windows Experience
48
But wait! Stop just for a moment and consider how useful the lock screen can be to you if correctly 
configured. Remember that it’s the first thing you look at but the time in which you’re doing so can set you 
up for the next tasks you’ll perform.
In the Settings panel, which you access by clicking the gear icon above the Power button in the bottom-
left corner of the Start menu, under Personalization ➤ Lock screen, you can configure apps to display useful 
information (see Figure 5-2).
Figure 5-1.  The Windows 10 lock screen

Chapter 5 ■ Maximize Your Windows Experience
49
This includes one app that can show detailed information, and another seven to display a counter. In the 
example here, the Calendar is set to display full information. This means that at a glance I can immediately 
see if I have anything coming that day. Below that, I only have three apps displaying information.
This might have been the way I wanted it set up, but properly configured, you can see at a glance the 
number of emails, instant messages, alerts, text messages, and notifications from financial or other business 
apps that you have waiting for you. All of this information helps you determine, at a glance, what you want to 
prioritize and what might end up being a time-sink if you dive into it too early.
Organizing Your Workspace
Okay, so you’ve dismissed the lock screen, are safely ignoring the huge mass of email that can only mean 
some crisis or another has arisen, that everybody will be looking to you to sort, and you’re now staring at a 
blank desktop. Now what?
Well, you open apps, right? You open Outlook and other Office apps, such as Excel or PowerPoint. When 
you open your customer relationship manager, or finance or reporting app, you almost definitely open a web 
browser, such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, or an app such as Microsoft Teams.
Within a couple of minutes, your workspace can become a complete jumbled mess of apps, meaning 
that you can find it confusing about what’s what, what’s where, and what just went bing!
In Chapter 3, I showed you how to use two really helpful features within Windows 10 to organize your 
desktop. The first was Snap!. This allows you to pin up to four windows (per monitor) to your desktop and 
dynamically resize them to make sure that all four are visible at any time.
After that came virtual desktops, which creates separate working environments (or hides eBay and 
Angry Birds from the boss, obviously). You could use these separate virtual desktops to have one desktop for 
communications and email, another for a specific project you’re working on, and a third for general additive 
clutter.
Figure 5-2.  You can configure the lock screen to display useful information

Chapter 5 ■ Maximize Your Windows Experience
50
Figure 5-3 shows my working desktops at the moment I’m writing this chapter. There are three virtual 
desktops. The first desktop contains the Word document that I’m using for this chapter and a File Explorer 
window in which I can easily access the other chapters I’ve written, images, and related files.
The second desktop contains Outlook and my web browser. The third desktop (which you can’t see 
very well here) contains the Groove Music app, which is currently playing the excellent chill out/electronica 
album Suzuki by Tosca (useful work music, and a change from my usual Jean-Michel Jarre).
This setup means that each environment is separated in a meaningful way so as to minimize distraction, 
and to help me concentrate on the most important tasks, such as bringing in enough money to keep my dogs in 
the fashion to which they have become accustomed. And believe me, they’re extremely pampered pooches.
This setup also helps prevent me from casually flicking open my web browser and clicking through 
gaming forums or tech and political news sites. And if you think these are a time-sink, don’t even think about 
opening a Facebook tab.
Managing Virtual Desktops
So now you’re organized, but you could still be working more efficiently and effectively. For this, you can use 
keyboard shortcuts to very quickly and easily switch between all these running apps and desktops. Here’s how…
• 
Snap an app left or right. Press the Windows key + Left and Right cursor keys to snap 
an app to the left or right of your screen
• 
Snap an app up or down. Press the Windows key + the Up or Down cursor keys to 
move a snapped app to the top or bottom left or right corner of the screen
• 
Resize snapped apps. Grab the edges of a snapped app to resize it; but for left and right 
snapped apps, it resizes the other app to ensure that the screen is full at all times.
• 
Create a new virtual desktop. Press the Windows key + Ctrl + D.
• 
Switch between virtual desktops. Press the Windows key + Ctrl + the Left or Right 
cursor keys.
Figure 5-3.  Virtual desktops can help you organize apps

Chapter 5 ■ Maximize Your Windows Experience
51
• 
Close the current app. Press the Windows key + F4.
• 
Minimize all the windows on your desktop at once. Swipe downward on your laptop’s 
trackpad with three fingers. Swipe upward with three fingers to restore the windows.
There is a full list of all keyboard shortcuts for Windows 10 in Appendix A. A list of Windows 10 touch 
and trackpad gestures is in Appendix B.
Where the Heck Did I Put that Report?
Okay, so your desktop is organized. Big whoop! This is great, but it’s pretty useless if you can’t find that damn 
report you were just working on, and that has to be on the client’s desk this afternoon.
You can open the File tab in Word, Excel or another Office 365 app to display a list of recently accessed 
documents. This can be a good way to access the file, but anything that requires more than two clicks to 
open a file is, let’s face it, inefficient and time-consuming.
I’ve loved the Jump List feature ever since it was first introduced in Windows 7. I use it all the time, 
every single day. This feature is invoked by right-clicking, or touching and holding, an icon on the taskbar to 
display a menu (see Figure 5-4).
Figure 5-4.  Jump Lists are a great way to get quick access to files

Chapter 5 ■ Maximize Your Windows Experience
52
The items that appear in a Jump List vary according to the app, but they can include recently opened 
files, create a new file, send a message or an email, create a new calendar appointment, and much more.
What I personally find most useful is the ability to pin files and documents to the Jump List. When you 
move your cursor over the file list, you see a pin icon appear to the right of each item. Clicking this pin icon 
pins or unpins a file to the Jump List. Pinning files and documents is a great way to make sure that they are 
always available to open with just two clicks, a real time-saver.
Hey, Cortana… Where the Heck Did I Put that Report?
Alas, speaking this into Cortana in Windows 10 will merely open a web search for “Where the heck did I put 
that report?” which isn’t massively helpful, but that’s because Cortana isn’t intelligent enough to know what 
you mean by “that report”… at least not yet! Microsoft’s artificial intelligence researchers are working on it, 
though.
What you can do is ask Cortana for specific searches; typing these into Cortana also works. A search for 
“Show me all documents about Claridge’s” (my dog likes it there) uses intelligent search to search not only 
file names, but also the text within documents, emails, contacts, and more to provide results (see Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-5.  Cortana uses intelligent file search

Chapter 5 ■ Maximize Your Windows Experience
53
As I mentioned in Chapter 2, you can use the Filters feature in the top-right corner of the search results 
window to further refine your search. This means you can filter the search to videos, web search, or just 
folders on the PC.
Cortana is capable of performing some highly intelligent, natural language search. In Figure 5-6, you 
see a search for “Show me documents I’m currently working on.” Cortana interprets this query correctly, and 
displays a list of all the documents that have been created or opened in the last few days, with the document 
I have worked on most recently, this chapter, highlighted at the top of the list.
It’s worth experimenting with Cortana to see what she’s capable of, as new functionality is added a 
couple of times a year with updates to Windows 10.
Figure 5-6.  Cortana can perform very intelligent, natural language search

Chapter 5 ■ Maximize Your Windows Experience
54
Summary
Being organized is one thing, and Cortana and the basic search functionality is great, but many of us build 
up huge volumes of files and documents, and just working on a project at work can end up producing many 
more documents itself. Navigating your way through all of this can be daunting, so in the next chapter, we’re 
going to delve into the advanced search and retrieval facilities available in Windows 10.

CHAPTER 6
Using Search to Keep Yourself 
Organized
If you really want to search in Windows 10, then File Explorer is the place to be. File Explorer contains a 
search box near its top-right corner.
When you click in the search box, a Search tab appears on the ribbon at the top of the window. This tab 
contains useful search parameters that you can use, such as searching by file type, size, or the last date the 
file was opened and modified. A Recent Searches drop-down menu is also available.
You can perform basic searches here, by just typing a word of name, or you can use Advanced Query 
Syntax (AQS) to perform more detailed and complex searches.
These AQS searches might appear sometimes to be overly complex and difficult, but it doesn’t have to 
be as if you can remember some of the basic search commands, File Explorer helps you with the rest, as it 
pops out helpful options and menus to assist (see Figure 6-1).
Figure 6-1.  Advanced search functionality can be found in File Explorer

Chapter 6 ■ Using Search to Keep Yourself Organized
56
I’ve included a complete list of File Explorer’s AQS syntax in Appendix C, but as a basic primer, here are 
some of the more common and more useful commands.
• 
Type: allows you to search for a specific file or document type. The options are 
Calendar, Communication, Contact, Document, Email, [RSS] Feed, Folder, Game, 
Instant Message, Journal, Link, Movie, Music, Note, Picture, Playlist, Program, 
Recorded TV, Saved Search, Task, Video, Web History, and Unknown.
• 
Date:/DateModified:/Modified: permits different date searches. You can use Date in 
Date:<27/03/2017 format to search for items saved before a date, or Date:> to search 
for items saved after a date. Additionally, you can use Date: with Today, Yesterday, 
This week, Last week, Next month, and Last month options.
• 
Size: can be used to filter documents by their size. Options are Empty (0KB),  
Tiny (0 > 10KB), Small (10KB > 100KB), Medium (100KB > 1MB),  
Large (1MB > 16MB), Huge (16MB > 128MB), Gigantic (> 128MB).
• 
Boolean operators, such as NOT and OR, can be used to narrow your search and you 
can put something in quotes (“ ”) to search for it as a complete string.
■
■Tip   Appendix C includes a full list of all the Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) for search in Windows 10.
Using Saved Searches in Windows 10
By far one of my all-time favorite tips in Windows is that you can save your searches and use them over, 
and over again. This can be especially useful. Clicking Save search (see Figure 6-2) saves the search as a file 
on your PC; you can save it anywhere. When you double-click the saved search later to open it, the search 
dynamically updates so that it’s not just a snapshot of the search as it was at the time you saved it, but 
accurately reflects all the changes, deletions, and additions made to files and documents on the PC.
Configuring Search in Windows 10
Searching for files and documents in Windows 10 can either be lightning fast or slow as hell. This is because 
the operating system maintains an “index” that contains information on every file, and the keywords within 
or associated with them.
Sometimes you might find that a location you want to search, such as a second hard disk in the PC, isn’t 
included in the index. As such, it takes an age to search, as the search has to be performed from scratch, with 
no help.
Figure 6-2.  You can save searches in File Explorer

Chapter 6 ■ Using Search to Keep Yourself Organized
57
You can manage the index on your PC and control which folders, files, and disks are included. To do 
this, search in the Start Menu for search and open Change how Windows searches from the results. This 
opens the Indexing Options panel (see Figure 6-3).
The Indexing Options panel lists the disks and folders that are indexed on the PC, which includes your 
user folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc.) and other standard locations, such as your email.
If you click the Modify button, a more complete list of disks and folders on the PC appears, where you 
can check (or uncheck) the ones you want included in, or excluded from the index. If your disk location isn’t 
appearing in the list, click the Show all locations button to display any that may be hidden.
■
■Note   You cannot add network drives and storage to the Windows Index unless you create a symbolic link 
between your PC and the network storage. You can do this in a Command Prompt window with the mklink 
command. It’s a bit complex, but if you search online for mklink, you can find additional help. Use the format 
mklink /d <Link> <Target>, where the /d switch creates a directory symbolic link, by default, only a file 
symbolic link is created. <Link> and <Target> are the names of the Symbolic link folders that appear on your 
PC, and the actual directory on the remote storage; for example, as this is a bit complex, mklink /d \MyDocs 
\\Users\User1\Documents. You can read more about Symbolic Links at http://pcs.tv/2tQeSqN.

Organizing Your Files Using Libraries
Shh! We’re going to talk about Libraries. Actually, there’s no need to be quiet, you can shout about Libraries 
from the rooftops if you like, as they can be a brilliant way to organize and find your files and documents.
Libraries is a feature of File Explorer that’s hidden when you install Windows 10, although it’s very 
easy to switch it on. You activate the Libraries feature in File Explorer by clicking the View tab, and then the 
Navigation pane button, which displays a Show libraries option (see Figure 6-4).
Windows 10 creates some Libraries for you automatically, such as Documents, Pictures, and Videos. 
Each contains the contents of that particular user folder. However, it’s the way that you can arrange and 
organize files and documents in Libraries that gives them such power and flexibility.
When you right-click in any blank space in a Library, the pop-up context menu that appears on screen 
gives you an Arrange by option. This is not something available in a normal File Explorer view, which only 
allows you to sort or group files.
Figure 6-4.  You can activate Libraries easily

Chapter 6 ■ Using Search to Keep Yourself Organized
59
Figure 6-5.  You can arrange files in different ways in Libraries
The Arrange by options that are available to you depend on the types of files that you are looking at in 
the Library. For example, when looking at Documents, you can arrange your files by Author, Date Modified, 
Tag, Type, or Name (see Figure 6-5).

Chapter 6 ■ Using Search to Keep Yourself Organized
60
In this example, I’m arranging the files and documents by tags. Think of a tag as a search term that 
allows you to quickly drill down into your files and documents to find what it is you’re looking for. As an 
example, you might use tags, such as Contoso to refer to files that reference a specific client account, or 
Accounts for financial documents.
You can set tags in several ways. First, you can use the Details pane in File Explorer to set them, and I’ll 
show you how to do this shortly, or you can add tags when you save a document. When you save a document 
in Microsoft Office, for example, beneath the boxes where you specify the file name and file type is the More 
options link.
If you click this then a dialog appears that includes the option to set tags, a title, and a subject to the 
document (see Figure 6-7). The tags, title, and subject then become searchable on the PC, which makes 
documents easier to find.
Figure 6-6.  Libraries allow you to organize your documents in different ways
Figure 6-7.  You can add tags when you save an Office document
When you choose an Arrange by option, the view changes to either display the contents of the Library in 
an organized list format, or as a series of stacked icons (see Figure 6-6).

Chapter 6 ■ Using Search to Keep Yourself Organized
61
Managing File and Document Tags and Details
I mentioned there was a way to edit the tags associated with a document or file by using the Details pane. 
This is available through the View tab on the ribbon in File Explorer, where you see a Details pane button 
near the left side. Clicking this opens the panel on the right side of the main File Explorer window, where 
clicking a file or document reveals details about it (see Figure 6-8).
Making sure that the information associated with a file or document is correct can greatly speed up the 
time it takes to search for, and find it. The details you are able to change for each file or document varies 
depending on the document or file type, but in the prior example, we can change the tags, category, content 
type, subject, comments, title, author, and more.
■
■Tip   Just above the Details pane button is a Preview pane button. Clicking this opens a panel on the right 
side of File Explorer in which is displayed a preview of any supported document or file that’s clicked on and 
highlighted. Note that not all document types are supported, you may for example use a custom file type in your 
place of business, but many document types, such as pictures, Microsoft Office documents, and PDF files are 
supported.

Chapter 6 ■ Using Search to Keep Yourself Organized
62
Sharing Files and Documents
It’s one thing to be able to quickly find and effectively work with files and documents on your PC, but 
collaboration is really the aim of the game. Later in this book, I’ll show you how to use the collaboration 
tools built into Microsoft Office. File Explorer contains its own collaboration tools, however, that are perhaps 
unsurprisingly, under the Share tab.
Most of the options here are self-explanatory, such as Email, Zip, Burn to disc (do people really still do 
that?), and Fax (see Figure 6-9). The Share button displays a list of Windows Store apps (which may include 
Microsoft Office on your PCs) that you can share the file or document with. The apps that are supported 
vary, but you may see common business apps, such as OneNote or Skype in the list.
If there is more than one user on the PC, perhaps because you hot-desk with someone else, their name 
appears in the Share with section of the tab. You can click their name, and that person is then able to access 
and open the file in their own account.
Additionally you can share a whole folder with users on your PC, or across your network (your PC needs 
to be switched on for them to have access) by right-clicking it and selecting Share with ➤ Specific People 
from the context menu that appears.
This displays a dialog in which you can select specific users on the PC, across your network, or whole 
groups of users who can have access to the folder (see Figure 6-10).
Figure 6-9.  You can share documents from File Explorer

Chapter 6 ■ Using Search to Keep Yourself Organized
63
The drop-down menu displays users and user groups that have been configured on your PC and 
network. If you don’t find a user or group here that you want to share with, you should check with your IT 
provisioning department to see if they’ve been set up to be visible to you.
When you share a folder with a user or user group this way you can change their Permission level, which 
by default is Read/Write to just Read, if you want people to be able to access a file, such as meeting notes, but 
not edit or delete them. It is also in this dialog that you can remove user permissions access from a folder.
Managing the Quick Access View
One thing I’ve not mentioned yet is the Quick access view in File Explorer. This is the default view and 
displays a list of all the files, documents, and folders that you’ve recently accessed.
This can be a great way to easily access your most recently used documents; however, you may not 
always want specific documents appearing here, especially if you people looking over your shoulder a lot. 
You can configure and even completely disable the Quick access panel under the View tab by clicking the 
Options button, or by opening the File tab and clicking Change folder and search options (both things take 
you to the same place). This opens a dialog containing various options for File Explorer.
Figure 6-10.  You can share folders with users, or groups of users

Chapter 6 ■ Using Search to Keep Yourself Organized
64
Figure 6-11.  You can configure Quick access in File Explorer
At the bottom of the General tab, you see Privacy options, which include two for quick access check boxes: 
Show recently used files in Quick access and Show frequently used folders in Quick access (see Figure 6-11). 
Additionally, the Clear button allows you to quickly wipe the Quick access history.

Chapter 6 ■ Using Search to Keep Yourself Organized
65
Next to each pinned folder, you’ll see a pin icon. You can click this icon at any time to unpin the folder, 
when you’re finished with it and don’t need quick access to it any more.
Summary
There are a great many ways you can use and configure Windows 10 to make your working life simpler and 
easier to manage. Libraries have always been a keen favorite of mine. I use them almost every day.
You’ll have noticed that in these first few chapters, I’ve referred quite a bit to Settings changes you can 
make within Windows 10, but there are many more that you might find useful. In the next chapter, we’ll 
look at the Settings that are available to you and how to navigate them, what you might want to change and 
configure, and how they can help you become more productive.
Pinning Folders to Quick Access
You can pin folders to the Quick access panel in File Explorer to you can get easy access to them. To do this, 
right-click any folder, and from the context menu that appears, select Pin to Quick access. A quick link to that 
folder appears in the quick access panel to the left of File Explorer (see Figure 6-12).
Figure 6-12.  You can pin folders to the Quick access toolbar

CHAPTER 7
Managing Windows Settings and 
Configuration
Throughout this book, I’ve shown you settings in Windows 10 that you can change, that can make using your 
PC simpler, and help make you more productive. Microsoft Windows is the most highly configurable and 
customizable operating system there’s ever been. Literally everything from the way the desktop looks, to how 
long your battery lasts can be configured in some way.
It’s not difficult to change Windows settings to be how you want them either, as Microsoft has make it 
simpler in Windows 10 than in any version of the operating system before it. In this chapter, we’ll look at the 
settings you can change, examine why you’d want to, and step through how to connect your PCs to company 
and organization networks and file shares, no matter where you are in the world.
The Settings Panel
You’ll probably be familiar with the Windows Control Panel, even if just in name. It’s been the place where 
you’ve gone to change settings and configuration options ever since the first version of Windows was 
released in 1985.
The Control Panel is complex and difficult to use unless you’re a techie and know what you’re both 
looking for and doing. Indeed, there are many things in the Control Panel that, if you changed them, you 
could even render some Windows functions or apps, unusable.
With Windows 8, Microsoft set about rectifying the situation and now Windows 10 contains a  
much friendlier and safer place in which you can personalize the operating system—the Settings app  
(see Figure 7-1).

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
68
You access Settings in Windows 10 by clicking the settings (cog) icon just above the Power button in the 
Start menu, and you’ll see that settings is sensibly laid out into various categories.
• 
System is where all the settings that control your PC are located, such as the 
resolution of your screen, the power settings, and touch controls.
• 
Devices is where you’ll find settings for any plug-in or wireless devices that your PC 
connects to, such as printers, your keyboard and mouse, and Bluetooth devices.
• 
Network & Internet is where you’ll go to set up and manage all types of connection, 
from Wi-Fi to secure company connections.
• 
Personalization is something we’ve already looked at quite a bit. This is where you 
can change the look and feel of Windows 10 itself.
• 
Apps is the place where you’ll control the software installed on your PC, from 
choosing which files open on what app, to uninstalling unwanted apps.
• 
Accounts is the location where all the user accounts that are set up on the PC are 
managed. It is also where you’ll find parental controls and company sign-in settings.
Figure 7-1.  The Settings panel in Windows 10

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
69
• 
Time & language is where you’ll need to go if you’re travelling around the world with 
your laptop or tablet. It’s also where you can change culturally significant settings 
such as currencies and numerical delimiters.
• 
Gaming is not strictly used in the workplace (wink!), but it’s where you can go to set 
game recording, and streaming settings.
• 
Ease of Access contains all the settings that can make Windows 10 easier to use for 
people with cognitive, physical, visual, or auditory impairments.
■
■Tip   Many more people than those with disabilities and difficulty using computers can benefit from the 
Ease of Access features. My book, The Windows 10 Accessibility Handbook (Apress, 2015) describes how they 
can be used to help everybody from young children, and the elderly, to people working in noisy environments, 
people who are color-blind, and people who have repetitive strain and other common injuries.
• 
Privacy allows you to control how the information about you and your PC account is 
shared with apps and with Microsoft.
• 
Update & security contains the settings for Windows Update, backup, recovery, and 
the Windows Defender antivirus service.
I won’t show you around all the settings in Windows 10 because you’ll never need many of them. 
Although I’ve not yet discussed them in this book, there are some settings that you can use to make your PC 
an easier and more pleasant place to work.
■
■Tip   If you find the auto-correct spell checker in Windows to be inaccurate or annoying; for example, if you 
work in an environment such as legal, engineering, or science that uses a very specialized language, you can 
disable the Windows 10 spell checker in Devices ➤ Typing.
System Settings
The System settings are the first listed in the Settings panel, and so this seems like the logical place to begin. 
System is where you’ll find all the settings associated with your PC’s hardware, such as your power and 
battery, keyboard, mouse, and screen.
Making Your Display Easier to Use
It’s very common these days for people to have laptops, tablets, and desktops with ultra-high resolution 4K 
or 5K screens, and for us to use those screens late at night.
Sometimes you need to change how your display works so that you avoid eyestrain, getting tired, or 
getting headaches, and also to help you get to sleep afterward. Fortunately, Windows 10 includes features for 
all of this.
The System ➤ Display options begin with a handy feature called Night light (see Figure 7-2).

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
70
Night light adjusts the blue light from your screen as the evening and night progress. This gives 
the screen a yellower and softer look, which puts less strain on your eyes and allows you to relax more, 
ultimately helping you sleep.
Below the Night light option, you can change the text scaling on your screen. This can be helpful if you 
sometimes, or often, find text and other things difficult to read. The scaling options vary from 100% all the 
way on PCs with high-resolution displays up to 225%.
Just one more thing of note, is that if you use projectors regularly with your PC, for meetings or other 
events, or if you use more than one monitor with your PC, the multiple monitor and wireless projector 
display options are also to be found here.
Managing Notifications
In Chapter 2, I showed you how to use the Notifications settings to keep your PC quiet during times when 
you’d rather not be disturbed. There’s more you can do to configure notifications accessed through the 
System settings.
Everything wants to tell you something these days. From your email, to instant messaging, your 
calendar, Cortana, your web browser, social media, and smartphone, through to individual apps, app 
updaters, file sharing, cloud backup and on it goes. The cacophony can be quite overwhelming sometimes, 
and truly annoying at others.
Figure 7-2.  There are multiple Display settings available

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
71
The Notifications & actions panel in the System settings allows you control and tame all notifications, 
and notifications from individual apps and programs on the PC (see Figure 7-3).
The first option, Get notifications from apps and other senders, allows you to turn all app and program 
notifications on or off globally.
If you never want to be bothered by Notifications, this is the switch to change. Scroll down the list and 
you’ll see on/off switches for every app and program installed on the PC that can create alerts. If Adobe 
Creative Cloud or Spotify is annoying you, completely turn off their notifications. Have you been wondering 
why the financial alerts you set up haven’t been appearing, turn them back on, and so on, and so forth.
■
■Tip   Conversely, you might think that the default notification display period of 5 seconds isn’t long enough 
for you to read what they say. You can change this setting in Ease of Access, Other Options where a drop-down 
menu has display periods ranging from 5 seconds to 5 minutes.
Figure 7-3.  You can manage notifications in Settings

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
72
Power to the People!
If you get annoyed that your PC goes to sleep, or the display keeps turning off when you’ve only been away 
from the machine for a couple of minutes, the Power & sleep settings in the System settings section is here to 
save the day. I’ll discuss these in greater depth in Chapter 9, but it’s worth going over the basics here.
Why is this important? Well, realistically speaking, it’s little gripes and annoyances—such as the PC 
going to sleep, restarting, or turning off when you don’t want it to—that can build up frustration in a person, 
eventually meaning that some get to a position where they’ll end up resenting their working environment 
and the PC. This isn’t good for either productivity or your state of mind.
At its simplest, the power settings just let you choose when the screen switches off, and when the PC 
goes to sleep. These settings are different for mobile devices (laptops, and tablets) and desktop PCs, which 
don’t have a battery, and they’re quite simple and straightforward to use and set (see Figure 7-4).
For mobile devices, you also see a Battery settings section (see Figure 7-5). Some of the settings here 
can be especially useful. There is a slider to control the Battery saver mode. This allows the PC to effectively 
go into low power, but still working state when the battery level drops below a certain level, 20% by default. 
What this means is that the screen dims (this is an optional setting) and all background tasks, such as the 
updating of live tiles, and apps updating themselves from the Internet will stop.
Figure 7-4.  You can change when the computer sleeps or the display switches off

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
73
■
■Tip   If you notice your battery is draining faster that you expect it should, click the Battery usage by app 
link. This displays a list of all the installed desktop and store apps on your PC in a bar chart that shows which 
ones are the most power-hungry. You can use this to determine what you want to uninstall, replace with an 
alternative app, or close when it’s not needed.
Back in the Power & sleep settings, you’ll see an Additional power settings link. Now if you click this, 
you’ll be presented with the older-style Power options in the Control Panel. But hang on a second because 
there’s some cool stuff in here that might benefit you.
Clicking the Choose what the power buttons do link in the top-left corner of the window allows you 
choose what Power and Sleep do (assuming that your laptop features them) (see Figure 7-6).
Figure 7-5.  The Battery settings allow additional power control

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
74
The first thing you’ll notice is that you’ll need to click the Change settings that are currently unavailable 
link, as all the most useful options are grayed out.
The main attraction is the ability to reprogram the power and sleep buttons on the PC. Why might you 
want to do this? Well back in the days of PCs of old, they were very bad at sleeping (I know the feeling, Ed.) 
but advances in modern hardware have improved things considerably. This means that even the biggest 
desktop PC might benefit from sleep or hibernation, rather than being shut down. But what is the difference 
between Sleep and Hibernate anyway?
• 
Sleep puts the PC into a low-power state, but keeps your programs and apps alive in 
the computer’s memory. Sleep does use power; once you disconnect it, the contents 
of the memory will be lost (a volatile storage medium).
• 
Hibernate saves the memory file on the PC to your hard disk (which is a non-volatile 
storage medium) and then turns off the power to the PC. This is slower to resume 
than sleep, as memory is significantly faster than even the fastest hard disk, but 
doesn’t consume any power when in its off state.
• 
Fast Start-up is a sort of hybrid system. It’s not supported on all PC hardware, so 
it may not be available on your PC. It works by signing off all the users on the PC, 
and then saving the rest of the memory state to the hard disk. Think of it as halfway 
between Hibernation and Off completely.
Figure 7-6.  You can choose an action for the Power button

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
75
By default, Fast Start-up is how Windows 10 always turns off, if your hardware allows it. However, you 
might not always want this feature enabled. For example, if you find that some Windows Updates aren’t 
being installed, this is because Fast Start-up doesn’t perform a “proper” shutdown, which Windows Update 
requires on some PCs.
Additionally, some third-party file and disk encryption technologies complain mightily, or just fail to 
work correctly with Fast Start-up. If you have a dual-boot system installed on your PC, such as two versions of 
Windows that you can boot between, or Windows and Linux, then Fast Start-up might also interfere with that.
Back in the main Control Panel, there are the Power Options. Clicking either Choose when to turn off the 
display or Change when the computer sleeps displays the Change [the] advanced power settings link.
This displays a dialog with many more options, some of which you might find useful (see Figure 7-7). 
For example, you might find that telling your hard disk to turn off earlier than the default 20 minutes saves 
some battery power.
Additionally, you could find that after the PC has been left unattended for a while, one of your USB 
devices fails to operate. Changing the power settings for the USB sleep system can rectify this.
There are other options here that you might to explore; a potentially useful one is to throttle back the 
Maximum processor state, which is set at 100% by default. If you have a particularly powerful processor in 
your computer, or a particularly undemanding workload, you can throttle the processor back to a smaller 
percentage of its overall potential; let’s say down to 80%. This can sometimes have a significant effect on 
improving the battery life of your PC.
Figure 7-7.  There are many advanced power settings

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
76
Keep Taking the Tablets!
Are you using a hybrid tablet device for work, such as a Microsoft Surface Pro or a Lenovo Yoga? If so, then 
you’ll likely be familiar with what happens when you detach your keyboard, or flip the screen all the way 
around to hide the keyboard. Windows 10 automatically flips to Tablet mode.
This is a special mode of the operating system where the focus is put on pen and touch input, instead of 
mouse and keyboard. You’ll notice icons get further apart (the ribbon icons in Office become more spaced 
out as well, which you might find generally more useful), and the Start menu expands to fill your whole 
screen.
What can be more annoying is all the icons that you have pinned to the taskbar can disappear! The 
Tablet mode settings allow you to customize this and other actions, so switching to Tablet mode doesn’t 
mean your taskbar icons have to disappear (see Figure 7-8). Additionally, you can disable Tablet mode 
completely if you don’t want it, or enable it all the time if you find features such as the extra spacing between 
icons useful.
How to Win at Snap!
Back in Chapter 3, I talked about how you can use the snap and virtual desktop features of Windows 10 to 
improve your workflow. You’ll find the configuration options for these two features in Multitasking in the 
System settings (see Figure 7-9).
Figure 7-8.  You can configure Tablet mode in Settings

Chapter 7 ■ Managing Windows Settings and Configuration
77
Why might you want to do this? If you’re a little shaky with the mouse, or if you use multiple monitors 
with your PC, or if snap doesn’t work properly for you, you may want to disable it.
The arrangement of taskbar icons can also be annoying when using multiple desktops, as the default 
setting is to only show taskbar icons for apps that are running on the desktop you are using, instead of 
all virtual desktops. Changing this setting can make it much easier to switch between different apps and 
desktops.
Summary
The number of settings and options available in Windows 10 are vast, which can be daunting, so I’ve 
highlighted all the ones that are of most use. This doesn’t mean that when you have some free time, you 
can’t look around to see what else is available to make using Windows 10 more pleasurable and make you 
more productive.
Some settings can appear pretty complex but still utterly essential, such as those to manage your 
hardware devices, and networks. In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to tame and take control of these and 
more.

CHAPTER 8
Managing Network Connections 
and Devices
Nobody can use a PC effectively without the ability to print, use USB and other hardware devices, or access 
networks and the Internet. Here we begin to deal with the more complex subjects that can appear daunting.
This doesn’t need to be the case, because it’s far simpler than you might think to take control of the 
devices and networks you need to use.
Managing Hardware Devices
The Devices settings in the main panel of the Settings app are—you’ll be unsurprised to hear—where you 
can manage all the external hardware devices that you attach to your PC, such as printers and Bluetooth 
headsets.
Managing Your Default Printers
If you use your laptop or tablet in more than one place, which is fairly likely, then you’ll probably have come 
up against the problem of documents failing to print because you’ve sent the job to a printer that’s actually 
located in another building, somewhere else in the country.

Chapter 8 ■ Managing Network Connections and Devices
80
This works quite simply by setting the default printer for each of the different wired of Wi-Fi networks 
you connect to, based on what you have tended to use on that network in the past. This means that for the 
first one or two times that you use a printer at a new location, you’ll need to choose the printer manually. 
After that, Windows intelligently associates printers with the local network, and then changes the default 
printer accordingly when you move from place to place.
■
■Tip   If you find the autocorrect spell checker in Windows to be inaccurate or annoying (for example, you 
work in an environment such as legal, engineering, or science, which uses very specialized language), you can 
disable the Windows 10 spell checker in Devices ➤ Typing.
Managing USB Device AutoPlay
I’m sure I’m not the only person in the world who finds it annoying when you plug a USB device into the 
PC, and Windows pops up an alert asking what you’d like to do with it. This reminds me of all those horrible 
times when Clippy would pop up his head in Microsoft Word to ask if you’re writing a letter, though I’m sure 
you’ll be delighted to hear that Clippy and I have since made up and become great friends (see Figure 8-2).
Figure 8-1.  Windows can manage your default printers for you
Windows 10 is clever in the way it manages multiple printers, and in the Devices ➤ Printers & scanners, 
settings you’ll find a check box option to Let Windows manage my default printer (see Figure 8-1).

Chapter 8 ■ Managing Network Connections and Devices
81
Figure 8-2.  Clippy and I have worked together now on several occasions

Chapter 8 ■ Managing Network Connections and Devices
82
The settings to allow you to choose what happens when you plug USB devices into your PC can be 
found in Devices ➤ AutoPlay. They’re separated into different sections, for Removable drives, Memory 
cards, and other devices such as your phone, and you might find you want to either open a specific app, or to 
disable actions completely (see Figure 8-3).
Network and Internet
The Network & Internet settings are where you can do really boring, or unwanted things, such as connect to 
the company or organization network, or configure the company’s security settings for their Virtual Private 
Network. Yeah, tell me about it, nothing fun here.
Managing Wi-Fi Networks
Connecting to Wi-Fi networks is simple… right? Well, not always as sometimes something might go wrong, 
such as the settings for a Wi-Fi network becoming corrupt, or perhaps because you’ve accidentally hit the 
button that allows all the other devices connected to the network to see your PC, when you should have said, 
keep my PC private and hidden.
The Network & Internet ➤ WiFi settings enable you to effectively manage your Wi-Fi networks. Clicking 
the Manage known networks link enables you to tell Windows 10 to Forget a network for which the settings 
are incorrect or corrupt (see Figure 8-4).
Figure 8-3.  You can choose what happens when you plug USB devices into your PC

Chapter 8 ■ Managing Network Connections and Devices
83
The Wi-Fi settings also allow you to choose what happens when you’re near public Wi-Fi services, such 
as in bars and coffee shops. It may be that, for security reasons, you really don’t want your PC connecting to 
these networks. Fortunately, Windows 10 makes it very easy to turn this functionality off completely.
Managing VPN Connections
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are special secure connections that create a “private” company or 
organization network over a “public” or otherwise insecure network, such as home broadband. It achieves 
this by encrypting all the data sent and received, and diverting all traffic through a specialized, encrypted, 
Internet server somewhere in the world.
It is this encryption and routing that hides all information about the connection from the Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) you are connecting through, and that has made VPNs popular with world travelers 
who want to maintain access to the video-on-demand services they pay for at home (though you should 
always be aware that some VPN use can violate the terms of service for some streaming providers). It is why 
VPNs have come to the attention of countries like the United Arab Emirates, China, and Russia, who have 
banned them.
If you need to set up a VPN connection on your PC, laptop, or tablet, then you were already provided 
with all the connection information you need from your business or organization. However, I want to make a 
special note here about security and law enforcement.
■
■Caution   If you are travelling abroad with your laptop or tablet and need to use a VPN, check before 
you travel if this is legal at your destination. Some countries, such as China, the United Arab Emirates, and 
Russia have banned their use, and using a VPN could land you with a heavy fine, or even a short period of 
imprisonment.
Figure 8-4.  You can tell Windows 10 to Forget Wi-Fi networks

Chapter 8 ■ Managing Network Connections and Devices
84
Additional Network Settings
The rest of the network settings don’t each require their own section here, as they’re all small, but still 
significant. Below the VPN settings, you’ll find an option for Flight mode. Yup, you guessed it: this is the 
essential setting you must enable before you fly.
It’s actually really important to remember to flick Airplane mode on your laptop or tablet, especially if 
you put your PC to sleep rather than shut it down. This is because in Sleep in Windows 10 occasionally wakes 
the PC in order to perform actions such as checking your email and updating live tiles in the Start menu. 
This, naturally, activates the Wi-Fi connection and… well, hopefully there’s not a big crash.
Mobile hotspot is best used on PCs that include a cellular connection that can be shared with up to ten 
other PCs and mobile device. They don’t have to be running Windows 10 either, as anything that connects to 
Wi-Fi is able to connect to the hotspot that you create.
On the subject of sharing your cellular connection, the Data usage option can be incredibly useful to 
see just how much data you’re using on your PC, and what apps might be hogging bandwidth. You can see 
this in the Data usage settings, where you’ll be given an overview of how much data you’ve used on each 
different network type in the last 30 days (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, cellular). Below this is a View usage details link. 
Clicking this displays detailed information on each app on your PC that has been using data and how much 
(see Figure 8-5).
Figure 8-5.  You can see which apps are hogging bandwidth

Chapter 8 ■ Managing Network Connections and Devices
85
Apps and Features
Ending the last section by talking about apps leads very nicely into the next Settings section, where there are 
options that you might find useful.
Making Your PC More Secure
Security is the most important thing with your PCs, files, and data these days, right!? If you’re using a PC that 
runs Windows 10 S, then you’ll only be able to download and install apps from the Windows Store.
This might seem like a massive limitation, but it’s not anywhere near as bad as you think. Microsoft has 
released tools that allow many older desktop (called Win32) apps to be included in the store. Initially this 
began with iTunes, Spotify, and the Office 365 suite of programs, and it’s expanding all the time.
The advantage of only allowing and installing apps from the Store is that the PC is fundamentally more 
secure as a result. All Store apps are “sandboxed” in that they’re completely separated and isolated from the 
operating system, other apps, and your files. They can’t do any harm to the PC as a result, especially given 
that all apps submitted to the Store are tested for malware infections.
Malware almost always comes in the form of Win32 code, so if you don’t allow that type of code to run 
and install, it’s significantly harder to get any malicious code on the PC.
You can set this manually in Windows 10 Pro in the Apps ➤ Apps & features settings, from the Installing 
apps drop-down menu. By default, you can Allow apps from anywhere, but if you can live with just the store, 
choosing Allow apps from the Store only definitely beefs up the security on your PC (see Figure 8-6).

Default Apps
Hands up everybody who’s ever tried to open a file or document and it’s either not opened at all or it 
has opened in the wrong program. Yup, there’s a lot us. And I count myself in this because it happens to 
everybody at some point.
If you look in Apps ➤ Default apps, you’ll see a list of different common file types (Email, Maps, Music, 
Photos, Videos, Web, etc.) and below each one is either an icon representing the app they’re set to open with, 
or a Choose a default button. You can click the icon or button to select what app you want to use for what 
thing.
This is a good start, but it doesn’t help with Office files, PDFs, and especially not with the custom file 
format you use with the specialist software you need at work. Below this list sits three links, two of which are 
useful.
Choose default applications by file type will display a list of all the different types of file known to your 
PC. These are all in the format .xyz, the three or four letters after the end of the file that signify it’s type, such 
as .doc, .docx (Word), .xls, .xlsx (Excel), .pdf (Adobe Portable Document Format) and so on (see Figure 8-7).
To set a default app for a file type, look down the list until you find the file type you need to change, and 
then click the icon next to it to choose the correct program.
Figure 8-7.  You can set which app should open which file type

Chapter 8 ■ Managing Network Connections and Devices
87
Sometimes you won’t know which file type it is that you need to change, since Windows hides the .xyz 
file suffix from you anyway. In this case, click the Set defaults by app link, which opens a panel that shows a 
list of all of your installed programs. You can click one to see how many of its file defaults have been set.
In the example in Figure 8-8, OneNote’s desktop app has just one out of its three defaults set. Below 
this are options to Set this program as default by setting all of its defaults, or to Choose [the] defaults for this 
program, which gives you more granular control.
Accounts
A little while ago, I described how you can connect to some company network types, such as VPNs, but what 
was missing were other account types, such as Azure AD (Active Directory). You can find this and more 
settings in the Accounts panel. There are several sections to this that you might find useful.
• 
Email & app accounts is where you can add different accounts that are used on your 
PC, such as work and home accounts, or different email accounts that are used by 
different apps.
• 
Sign-in options contains all the settings you need to change your password, set a pin 
or a picture password, or set up the Windows Hello biometric sign-in feature.
• 
Access work or school is where you’ll find the Azure AD sign in option. You need to set 
this up with the settings provided by your system administrator.
Figure 8-8.  You can choose all the defaults for a specific program

■Tip   In the Sign-in options, you’ll find a setting called Dynamic lock. If you carry a Bluetooth device with 
you, such as a phone, smartwatch, or even a fitness band, and pair this device with your Windows 10 PC, you 
can use its proximity to automatically lock and unlock your PC. This won’t work with all Bluetooth devices, but 
it’s worth trying with devices you own and use regularly.
Summary
So far throughout this book, I’ve explained useful settings and options that you might want to configure that 
can help make Windows 10 easier to use, or to help you work more effectively. This includes the Regional 
Settings I covered in Chapter 1, and the various Ease of Access features that I’ve covered throughout the first 
few chapters.
There are a great many additional Settings available in Windows 10, although I’ve focused on the 
ones that can help you be more productive on your PC, and offer a more pleasurable and less frustrating 
experience.
Now that we’ve tamed network connections, in the next chapter we’ll take a more holistic view of your 
life online by looking at how you can keep yourself, your data, and the people around you safe from malware 
and hackers.

CHAPTER 9
Keeping Yourself and Your Data 
Safe and Secure
How many times have you heard a story on the news about a data breach, and that a company has lost the 
personal data of thousands or even millions of customers? You can probably name at least one, or remember 
hearing of one, straightaway.
These could have occurred through a malware infection or through a hack, because somebody in the 
company was tricked by a scammer or criminal into giving up a crucial password, or through another means 
such the theft of the data internally by an employee.
Either way the amount of data breaches you read about in the news is miniscule when compared to the 
number of data breaches you never get to hear about. Companies cover up these breaches, hacks, and thefts 
as much as they can because of the reputational damage it can do and to avoid fines that can be levied, or 
perhaps because they don’t think the amount of data lost or stolen is “important enough” to make a fuss 
about.
It’s important to consider when discussing computer security, that anything you do at work to keep 
your company and customer data safe and secure, is the same as you would do at home to keep your own 
personal data safe, and the same as you’d expect everybody else in any company that stores your own 
personal data to also do. Computer security is as much a holistic process as it is a necessary one.
Surely, I Just Install Antivirus… Right?!
Windows 10 is the most secure operating system Microsoft has ever released. The list of security features in 
Windows 10 is long and includes antivirus protection. So you would think that when you use your computer 
you’d always be safe… Sorry, but no.
Antivirus software is just a small part of a larger picture that includes work on your own part too.  
It’s a truism in IT Support circles that nothing ever goes wrong with a computer that’s left in the box and 
never used.
This is because nothing can ever go wrong with a computer unless a human being uses it. Thus, 
every problem is the ultimate result of human beings. Although some problems are traceable to a person 
somewhere, problems occur on their own anyway, including power spikes, component failures, or your 
laptop being damaged from great height by a bird.
When it comes to malware infection and hacking, however, there is plenty that you can do—and plenty 
that you shouldn’t do. It’s what you do that causes problems. To examine what I mean, it’s necessary to look 
at how malware infections and hacking attacks work.

Chapter 9 ■ Keeping Yourself and Your Data Safe and Secure

How Do Malware Infections Happen?
Malware doesn’t just appear on PCs and infect them. It simply can’t do it. This is because there are multiple 
security systems on a PC that prevent this from happening. When you install a piece of software on your PC, 
or make some configuration changes, you’re presented with what’s called User Account Control (UAC)  
(see Figure 9-1).
UAC is a dialog box that appears in the center of a dinned screen, telling you that you’re about to do 
something important, and asking either for confirmation that you really want to do it, or an administrator 
password to confirm that you have the authority to make the change.
Windows SmartScreen might pop up an alert when you download a file from the Internet, saying that it 
believes opening the file, or running an installer is potentially unsafe, and asking if you really, really want to 
open it (see Figure 9-2).
Figure 9-1.  UAC Prompts alert you when an important change is being made on the PC

Chapter 9 ■ Keeping Yourself and Your Data Safe and Secure
91
You have built-in Windows Defender Antivirus software. If it discovers malware on your PC, it alerts 
you with a pop-up alert in the system tray (the far right of the taskbar next to the clock) and in the Security 
Center (see Figure 9-3).
So with all of this in place, and additional security features, such as the Edge web browser alerting you 
to and blocking known unsafe websites, you’re surely perfectly safe? Well, no, unfortunately not.
There are two problems. The first of which is that antivirus software, and other security features can 
only scan for and identify malware that’s already known to them. All antivirus packages contain heuristic 
scanning engines, that scan for “virus type” activity, but even that’s no guarantee of safety and protection.
The reason for this is that zero-day malware–that is, malware that’s only just been released into the wild, 
and hasn’t been analyzed or intercepted by security researchers—can frequently cause massive infections 
worldwide, such as the WannaCry Ransomware in 2017, which infected computers in over 150 countries, 
and brought some companies and organizations, like the British National Health Service, to a standstill.
Figure 9-2.  Windows SmartScreen protects against unsafe downloads
Figure 9-3.  Windows Defender alerts you if it finds malware

Chapter 9 ■ Keeping Yourself and Your Data Safe and Secure
92
Then there’s the psychology used in malware infections. You know that your PC has lots of security 
features designed to keep you safe, but so do the malware writers. As such, they’ll try to trick you into 
installing the malware, by disguising it as something you want, like a game, a codec required to play a funny 
cat video or a file or download from a colleague. Even the hugely popular CCleaner app for Windows was 
compromised in 2017 by hackers when they successfully embedded malware into the installer, which was 
then downloaded by tens of thousands of people for several weeks before it was spotted.
It’s actually common for malware to lay relatively dormant on a PC, quietly trying to infect other 
computers via email payloads, network attacks, and by being copied to removable devices like USB flash 
drives, for several weeks before making itself known to the world.
How Does Hacking Happen?
You might be aware of the term hacking. It’s not what happens when you have a particularly bad case of 
catarrh. It’s someone just outside your building or elsewhere in the world gaining access to your PC or 
company network. There are several ways that it can happen.
In the 2016 action movie Jason Bourne, a CIA operative gets access to a laptop that our protagonist is using. 
The CIA operative deletes secret files from the laptop by hacking into and getting control of a mobile phone 
that’s in the same room. Like all the Bourne movies, it’s brilliant to watch; but in this case, the implementation 
of hacking and computer security is completely nonsensical because for this scenario to work, the phone would 
have no on-board security and be connected to the laptop by Bluetooth or Wi-Fi that also had no security.
Given that the laptop is owned by an Edward Snowden–type character who is on the run from 
authorities for leaking top-secret files online, he’d have been caught long ago for being so incompetent. 
Having a secure laptop that’s connected to Wi-Fi and the Internet at all is an automatic hacker fail!
Hacking actually works differently. It is usually done in one of two ways. The first is what’s called a 
brute-force attack, in which the hacker uses software on one or many PCs to either try a massive amount 
of password and username combinations until they get the right one. The other, called a Denial of Service 
attack, floods the endpoint computer with so much traffic that it, or its software, physically fails or crashes.
If a brute force attack is allowed, then the security on the server isn’t configured correctly (it should only 
allow a few attempts before locking). With a denial of Service attack, crashing the endpoint computer will 
likely block access to the hacker anyway.
What’s more common is that the hacker(s) will try to gain an advantage from inside the organization. 
This could be system administrators using extremely weak passwords, or someone on the inside giving the 
hackers access.
Very occasionally, the hacker is a disgruntled employee who uses it as an act of revenge before leaving. 
More commonly, the hacker calls or emails a person who is already a user on the network and attempts to 
trick them into giving up their username and password.
Crikey! What Else Should I Look Out For?
Phishing attacks are very commonplace these days. These are scams whereby criminals try to convince 
you to give up personal information, such as your credit card number, Social Security number, passwords, 
and usernames. They then use this information to gain access to accounts you might have on websites like 
Amazon, eBay, and Apple, so they can spend all of your hard-earned money on themselves before they’re 
spotted by your credit card company.
In the context of business, Phishing attacks might be used to gain access to a company network by 
pretending to be a company email requiring you to confirm your security details, or set up a new service 
that you need as an employee. If you work for a secure government department, or a branch of the military 
you may have already been briefed about this type of attack, as it’s commonly used by security agencies and 
governments as a means of infiltration and intelligence gathering. It can also be used against research and 
investment firms and for industrial espionage.

Okay, Now My Head Hurts! How Do I Stay Safe?
Staying safe on your PC is actually very simple and straightforward. It just involves being vigilant about what 
you do on your network and online. There’s so much on the Internet that’s trying to take advantage of you—
approaching anything that happens these days with a healthy dose of skepticism doesn’t hurt either.
Keep Everything Up-to-Date
The first rule is to make sure that your PC, your antivirus software, and the apps you use are always kept 
up-to-date. Windows 10 takes care of itself via Windows Update, but you can manually check the status of 
both Windows Update, and Windows Defender on your PC by opening Settings and then clicking Update & 
Security (see Figure 9-4).
If you use a third-party anti-malware package, make sure it is set to automatically update itself. Where 
you can check for updates in the package varies from one product to another, but it is always straightforward 
to find, such as with ESET Smart Security (see Figure 9-5).
Figure 9-4.  You can check and run Windows Update manually

Chapter 9 ■ Keeping Yourself and Your Data Safe and Secure
94
You also need to make sure that any apps and software you use on your PC is kept to up-to-date. Older 
and out of date apps can contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware and hackers. You can 
update apps in one of several ways.
• 
Many software packages contain a button or an option that allows you to check to 
see if there is a newer version available (see Figure 9-6).
Figure 9-5.  It’s always easy to update anti-malware software

Chapter 9 ■ Keeping Yourself and Your Data Safe and Secure
95
• 
Other apps alert you when a newer version of the software is available, and then 
prompt you to download it.
• 
Some apps, such as Apple iTunes and Adobe Creative Cloud, run updater apps that 
sit in your system tray and update the app automatically in the background.
• 
Apps from the Microsoft Store are automatically updated by Windows 10 whenever a 
new version of an app becomes available.
• 
If all else fails, check the website of the company that made the software to see 
if updates are available. If it’s discontinued software that is no longer supported, 
consider an alternative. A newer app will do the same thing for you.
Figure 9-6.  Many apps allow you to check for updates

Chapter 9 ■ Keeping Yourself and Your Data Safe and Secure
96
Use Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication
You should always use secure passwords on your PC, and online. I have a video online showing you how to 
create strong passwords, which you can find at http://pcs.tv/2wRi3wY, but the rules are quite simple and 
straightforward to follow and understand.
• 
DO NOT use dictionary words, names, or obvious passwords. Some of the most 
common passwords are admin, password, 12345, monkey, and password 123. All of 
these are easily guessable by a criminal and instantly guessable by a computer.
• 
DO use longer passwords, such as phase, line from a poem of lyric from a song.  
The longer the password the harder it is to guess or crack.
• 
DO mix numbers, and characters into your password. There are many good ways you 
can do this, such as substituting the number 5 for the letter S, using & instead of a,  
/ instead of 7, ( instead of C, () instead of o, 3 instead of E, 1 instead of i, and so on.
• 
NEVER USE THE SAME PASSWORD TWICE You should use unique passwords 
for each website, or web service you use. These are easily manageable because you 
can create a strong core password, and then personalize it by adding additional 
characters at the beginning or end of it that are unique to the website or service 
you’re using. For example, you can use aMa (Amazon), eBa (eBay), or sPo (Spotify) at 
the end of your password where you know the added characters always form an easy 
to remember pattern. Or you could use a more secure format like -AmAz()n, which 
strengthens your password further by making it longer.
• 
USE BIOMETRICS if available, such as Windows Hello’s facial recognition or 
fingerprint-reader hardware to sign in to your PC. There is a caveat with this that I 
will deal with shortly.
• 
USE TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION if it is available, which it is on many 
websites and services from Microsoft to Google. This feature uses a second device, 
such as your smartphone to issue a single-use security code that’s required when 
signing into the service from an unrecognized PC.
• 
DO NOT use a simple PIN to sign in to your PC. There’s no point in having a super-
secure password and Windows Hello to sign in to your PC if you also have an insecure 
four-digit PIN set up on the device. PINs can be useful in that they’re never stored 
in the cloud, but are local to the PC, but a four-digit PIN only has 9,999 possible 
combinations. Windows Hello requires you set up a PIN, but Windows 10 allows you 
to have a PIN of any length, and one that also includes letters and other characters.
Don’t Just Click Anything Online!
It’s easy to be complacent when using our PCs online. It’s the same feeling you can have in your car, in 
that you’re separated from the outside world, safe and secure. The trouble is that you’re really not. You’re 
connecting to websites and servers right across the planet every time you visit a website.
Regardless of what web browser you use, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, or Google Chrome (Internet Explorer 
can no longer be considered safe and secure for general use) they all work in the same way to keep you safe 
online.
When you visit a website on which you are required to enter personal information, set up or use an 
account, or make a purchase, you are always shown a green padlock if the website is known to be safe and 
issued a security certificate. You can click this padlock icon to check that it matches the information about 
the site you’re on (see Figure 9-7).

Chapter 9 ■ Keeping Yourself and Your Data Safe and Secure
97
If the padlock of the address bar is Red, then you are on a website that is known to be unsafe, and you 
should close the browser tab immediately. Additionally, if you are making a purchase online and there is 
no padlock icon, stop immediately! That website is not secure. Your information will not be encrypted when 
transmitted across the Internet. The purchase you are making or the account you are setting up is probably 
part of a scam.
Don’t Click Anything in Your Email Either!
You’re fully aware of the nuisance that is spam email and how it tries to sell you everything from sex aids to 
instant girlfriends. You wouldn’t click a link in a spam email, but did you know that you should be just as 
wary of the emails sent by friends and colleagues?
■
■Note   Spam email is named after a type of canned, cooked meat made from processed pork that was often 
eaten during and after World War II. It was widely disliked by those who had to eat it, largely because it was 
fatty, full of gelatin, and generally tasted disgusting. The name was later used by Monty Python in a comedy 
sketch in which every food available in a café had Spam in it. If you’re brave enough, you can still find and buy 
Spam today.
Malware typically propagates itself by sending emails to everybody in any address book that it finds. 
These emails may contain a link that you are encouraged to click, or an attachment that you are enticed to 
open. If you suspect an email that you receive is fraudulent, check with the person that sent it to see if they 
really intended to do so.
Figure 9-7.  Always look for the green padlock on websites

Chapter 9 ■ Keeping Yourself and Your Data Safe and Secure
98
Safety and Security Are Common Sense
Keeping your data safe is a matter of common sense. Keep Windows and your apps up-to-date, use up-to-
date anti-malware software, don’t disable or otherwise tamper with the security features in Windows or your 
anti-malware software, and don’t click something just because an app, email, or website wants you to.
Part of keeping yourself safe is involves encouraging those around you to also stay safe. If you have 
children, you’re probably aware that they look at all sorts of random rubbish online, some of which is no 
doubt harmful. By educating the people around you, helping and encouraging them to use best practices, 
you’re also looking after yourself, as there will be fewer threats arriving by email and across your network.
Stopping and thinking before you click something is also essential. If you open a download or an email 
attachment, which then flags a UAC prompt, you could be tempted to just click OK before you stop to think 
about what’s going on. At this point, it’s already too late: if it’s malware, then you’ve given it full administrator 
rights on your PC.
If you share a PC with other people, then it is very wise not to check the Remember my username and 
password option on websites, as this can additionally expose you to fraud and theft, especially if the PC is 
used in public places, or educational establishments such as at college.
Finally, when you connect to a Wi-Fi network and you are asked if you want other PCs on that network 
to be able to see your PC, only click Yes if you’re on a safe home or office network. Never click Yes if you are 
in a public place, such as coffee shop or a library; doing so will mean that your PC and any files, folders, and 
disks on which you have sharing configured will be viewable and available to anyone in the vicinity.
Summary
It’s important to remember that PC security is holistic and not confined to a specific device. A weak 
password on your Internet router makes your PC just as vulnerable as if it has a weak password itself. If 
you’re tired when browsing online increase the risk that you’ll click something you shouldn’t, and sharing a 
PC with others means you don’t necessarily know what they were doing on it before you were.
This isn’t the end of the story, though. In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to maintain a stable, 
reliable, and robust system on your PC that enables you to work more productively and with as little 
downtime as possible.

CHAPTER 10
Maintaining a Stable and Reliable 
Working Environment
It’s very difficult to get any work done or be at all productive if your PC isn’t working, or isn’t working 
reliably, or is busy installing updates. One of the issues with Windows, especially in a business environment, 
is the installation of Windows Updates at the most inappropriate time, which means you’re sitting and 
twiddling your thumbs for… well, you have to guess.
There’s always the lingering concern about reliability and stability with PCs. You install something—a 
Windows Update, a driver, a new app, or a software update. Will everything still work, and work reliably?
The good news is that Windows 10 is the most stable and reliable version of the operating system that 
Microsoft has ever produced. This is ironic given that it contains more support and recovery tools than any 
other version of Windows before it. It does mean that problems should be few and far between.
There’s still things you can do to help ensure that stability and reliability, and help make sure that when 
Windows Updates are installed, they don’t interfere with your own workflow.
If It Ain’t Broke, Don’t Fix It
There is a common saying: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It’s a good methodology to follow too, although there 
are some notable exceptions. Generally speaking, it’s a good rule to follow because if something is working, 
what’s the incentive to update it and potentially cause a problem?
Where this presents a potential issue relates back to the security holes that can be present in software or 
hardware drivers, and how these can open your PC to malware infection or hacking.
So how do you deal with this dilemma? The easy solution is to let your software, apps and drivers 
update themselves. This happens through Windows Update, through the Microsoft Store app, through a 
standalone updater in the system tray, or through a notification when you open an app on your desktop that 
an update is available.
If you approach the updating of apps and drivers in this manner, then you’ll know that you have a better 
than average chance that whatever is downloaded and installed will be stable and reliable. I’m not saying 
this is guaranteed as buggy software is occasionally still released, and given the almost infinite combinations 
of hardware and software our PCs run these days, it’s a very difficult job sometimes to write code in a way 
you can guarantee is stable.
Taming Windows Update
Clearly one of the biggest barriers to productivity in the workplace is the message, “Windows is installing 
updates, don’t turn off your PC.” When the update installs are small and relatively minor, they won’t disrupt 
your workflow for more than a couple of minutes.

Chapter 10 ■ Maintaining a Stable and Reliable Working Environment
100
At times, however, there’s a major update or a lot of smaller updates (especially if your PC was off while 
you were on vacation), which can prevent you from using your PC for 20 minutes or more.
There are two things that you can do to help prevent this and so that every time you return to your PC, 
it’s updated and ready to work. You need to tame Windows Update and you need to correctly configure your 
power settings.
We’ll deal with the former first. If you open Windows Update from the Settings app, you see the 
Change active hours link. Here you can tell Windows Update the hours that you work (see Figure 10-1), 
so that if an update restart is required, Windows 10 won’t automatically restart … without checking that 
you’re using the PC.
In fairness, this is a bit of a fudge, as it doesn’t in guarantee that you won’t be nagged to restart the PC 
when you’re really busy.
This is where the Restart options link can be useful. This allows you to configure how and when 
Windows 10 restarts to install an update (see Figure 10-2).
Figure 10-1.  You can tell Windows Update what hours you work

Chapter 10 ■ Maintaining a Stable and Reliable Working Environment
101
If you have a restart pending, you can use this feature to delay it until a time when you’re not using the 
PC. You might for example set it to install automatically when you go to lunch or a meeting, or you might 
want to install overnight when you’re guaranteed to be out of the office.
Sleeping at Work
So you want to set your PC to only install Windows Updates that require a restart overnight, when you’re not 
at work. But whenever you leave the office, you switch off your PC because if you don’t, it’s using power all 
night.
Modern PCs are very adept at managing power effectively when you put them to sleep. This might be 
something you only associate with a laptop or especially a tablet, where quickly pressing the power button 
wakes the device up into the exact state it was when you were last using it. Desktop PCs can also take 
advantage of Sleep, however, which can save you valuable time when you return to work each morning.
In the Settings app, click System and then Power & sleep. Here you are presented with two single drop-
down menus for when the screen turns off, and when the PC goes to sleep. On a laptop or convertible tablet, 
these are already configured, but on a desktop PC, you might find that the sleep option is set to Never. 
If you change this to, say 1 hour (see Figure 10-3), then you just leave your PC when the day ends and it 
automatically goes to sleep after that time, when you can wake it by hitting a key on the keyboard, tapping 
the screen if it’s touch sensitive, or moving the mouse.
Figure 10-2.  You can configure restarts in Windows Update

Chapter 10 ■ Maintaining a Stable and Reliable Working Environment
102
You don’t need to worry about power consumption either as even the most powerful PC only sips small 
amounts of power while in Sleep. It wakes occasionally to refresh live tiles in the Start menu (if you have them) 
and to check for updates, and so forth; but crucially, it uses this middle-of-the-night time to install any new 
Windows updates, and then restarts the PC, putting it back to sleep when it’s done.
■
■Tip   One of the advantages of putting a PC to sleep instead of switching it off at the end of the day, is that 
Windows Updates can be downloaded at night, when the network and your Internet bandwidth isn’t used for 
anything else. If you have many PCs downloading updates simultaneously, this can really slow your Internet 
traffic and cause a chain reaction on the productivity of everybody in the workplace.
Occasionally, you’ll find that a PC (often an older one) won’t happily go to sleep, or won’t happily wake 
afterward. There things you can do about this. In the Power & sleep settings, click the Additional power 
settings link. This opens a new window, where you see the Choose what the power buttons do link in its  
top-right corner. Click it.
The next thing to do is to click the Change settings that are currently unavailable link near the top center 
of the window. You are presented with a series of power options that you can change (see Figure 10-4).
Figure 10-3.  You can set any Windows 10 PC to sleep overnight

Chapter 10 ■ Maintaining a Stable and Reliable Working Environment

• 
The first two options might be worth configuring. It’s not very common these days 
for a PC to come with a dedicated Sleep button. Only laptops tend to have them, and 
then only on a Fn + other key combination on the keyboard. But the Sleep feature 
can make your life simpler by automatically putting your PC to sleep so that you 
don’t need to switch it off. You can still turn off your PC from the Start menu’s power 
options when you want to, but you have a very quick-and-easy-to-use Sleep button.
• 
Fast Start-up isn’t supported by all PC hardware. It is a function that saves parts of 
memory to the hard disk on shutdown to facilitate a slightly faster “boot from cold” 
speed. It is not a Sleep option, so you can safely ignore it.
• 
Sleep might be disabled on some PCs, normally older desktops. If it is disabled, there 
could a very good reason for it. My advice is to activate it, put the PC to sleep, and 
watch what happens. If it won’t sleep, or won’t wake when you press a key or move 
the mouse, then the methods I’ve described here won’t work on that machine.
• 
Hibernate saves the contents of memory to the hard disk before shutting the PC 
down. It enables a faster startup, but isn’t Sleep, so won’t wake the PC in the night to 
install updates. It’s been superseded by Fast start-up, and is deactivated on PCs that 
support that newer feature.

Pausing and Deferring Updates
Microsoft has two “channels” that allow you to defer Windows Updates. They enable system administrators 
to make sure that any delivered updates are stable and compatible with the software and hardware used in 
the workplace before installation; however, there is an added use.
Occasionally, an update from Windows Update causes a PC to become unstable, crash, or even fail to 
start. These instances are very rare but can occur, which is why IT administrators are always so cautious 
about updates. Deferring the installation of faulty updates gives Microsoft and third parties time to identify 
any problems, withdraw the faulty update, and issue a replacement.
If you are using Windows 10 Pro, Pro for Workstation, Enterprise, or Windows 10 S, you can choose to 
opt into the business channel. You do this by clicking the Advanced options link in the Windows Update 
settings (see Figure 10-5).
Figure 10-5.  You can defer some updates in Windows 10 Pro

Chapter 10 ■ Maintaining a Stable and Reliable Working Environment
105
Opting into the business channel allows you to defer some updates for up to a year, but there are 
caveats, of which you need to be aware.
• 
Security updates can only be deferred for a maximum of 30 days, as clearly they’re 
very important.
• 
New Windows 10 features and user interface enhancements can be deferred for 
one day to one year. Bear in mind that many new features can greatly enhance 
productivity, so it’s often worth letting these install after 30 days.
■
■Caution   Enterprise environments can enroll PCs on the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). This defers 
security and stability updates for up to 30 days, but can defer feature updates for up to ten years. LTSC isn’t 
intended for standard desktop use, however. It is intended for use on mission-critical systems, such as medical 
scanners, automatic teller machines, and workplace machinery. As such, Microsoft Office, the Microsoft Store, 
and Store apps won’t install or run on PCs enrolled in LTSC.
Below the option to defer updates in the Advanced Windows Update options is the Pause Updates 
button. If you’re busy, working on a tight deadline (you’re over yours, Ed.), or you otherwise cannot be 
disturbed by PC restarts and update installations, flicking this switch automatically pauses all new updates 
on the PC for a week.
Using the Automated Troubleshooters
Let’s say you do encounter a problem on your PC that’s making the system unstable or unreliable.  
There are a few things you can do that might rectify the problem. The first is to run one of the automated 
troubleshooters. You’ll find these in the Settings app under Update & security ➤ Troubleshoot  
(see Figure 10-6).

Chapter 10 ■ Maintaining a Stable and Reliable Working Environment
106
The automated troubleshooters work by resetting Windows components to their standard (default) 
state, so they won’t fix anything more complicated than a configuration snarl-up. There are quite a few of 
them, however, and they can prove useful.
System Restore
System Restore has been around since the days of Windows ME, when it was a favorite place for malware 
to hide; but in Windows 10, it’s a very useful way to roll back changes that have made the PC unstable or 
unreliable.
If you find that a Windows update, driver, app, or other software update or configuration change is 
causing problems, search in the Start menu for Restore, and click the Create a restore point option when it 
appears.
This in itself is worth remembering because it’s here that you can turn on/off System Restore for 
different hard disks on the PC. You don’t need it for drives that only contain files, for example. Manually 
creating a restore point can be useful if you are about to make a change to the PC, but you aren’t certain that 
doing so won’t cause you any problems.
Figure 10-6.  The automated troubleshooters can fix some problems

Chapter 10 ■ Maintaining a Stable and Reliable Working Environment
107
Click Configure to change the drives protected by System Restore (useful if you discover your Windows 
installation drive isn’t protected), or click Create to manually create a restore point. If you want to roll back 
changes that have been made to Windows, your divers, updates, and apps, click the System Restore button 
(see Figure 10-7).
A wizard opens to show you a list of available and recently created restore points. Each one has the date, 
time, and a brief description of what triggered the automatic (or manual) creation.
Windows 10 shows you the most recent available restore points, but there may be more from which you 
can choose. For example, if you have experienced trouble since an update was installed a week ago, you can 
select the Show more restore points check box to see if any others are available.
Once you have chosen a restore point, you can click the Scan for affected programs button, which 
displays a list all programs and drivers that will be rolled back to a previous version, or perhaps even deleted 
when you start the Restore. You might find that choosing a particular restore point has an undesirable effect. 
You may want to see if a more appropriate restore point is available instead.
Creating a Windows 10 Recovery Drive
Sometimes you might find that something goes so wrong with the PC that it won’t start, or is regularly 
suffering from a Blue Screen of Death. If you need to run System Restore but can’t reliably get access to 
the Windows desktop, you can instead do this from a USB recovery drive. To create one, you need a spare 
USB flash drive that you’re not using for anything else of at least 4GB in size. In the Start menu, search for 
recovery and open the Recovery (Control Panel) option when you see it.
Figure 10-7.  System Restore rolls back unwanted changes

Chapter 10 ■ Maintaining a Stable and Reliable Working Environment
108
This wizard guides you through the process of creating a USB recovery drive. That drive can then be 
used to start the PC into the Windows Recovery Environment if it won’t start, or won’t start reliably. Note 
that you need to have your PC set to allow “booting from USB” and you should check the manual that came 
with the PC for how to do this.
There is an additional option that may or may not be available on your PC. This is the Back up system 
files to the recovery drive check box. If you check this option, it copies a full backup image of your Windows 
installation so that if something goes horribly wrong, you can still restore your copy of Windows. Note that 
this Reset option, which is also available in the Update & security ➤ Recovery section of the Settings app, 
requires you to reinstall all of your software and apps.
To use this option, you need a much larger USB flash drive—at least 8GB (possibly up to 32GB)—to 
accommodate the space required for the backup copy of Windows 10.
Either way, a recovery drive is an incredibly useful thing to have, and I always recommend that one 
be created for each PC. The reason to have one for each machine is because not all recovery drives can be 
used to rescue all versions of Windows, as Windows editions tend to vary, and require different things from 
a recovery drive. Also, because of hardware driver support, a reset image from one PC cannot be used to 
rescue Windows 10 on another PC.
■
■Tip   The Reset option in Windows 10 reinstalls the operating system without affecting your files, accounts, 
or settings, although you have to reinstall all your software and apps. However, it also comes with an option to 
wipe the PC completely. This is not a secure wipe, so an experienced IT engineer could still recover files and 
data, but it’s a useful tool if you’re passing a PC on to another person such as a family member.
Figure 10-8.  You can create a USB recovery drive
A window will appear, in which the first option is to Create a recovery drive. Click this and a wizard will 
appear on the screen (see Figure 10-8).

Summary
There’s no point in making yourself as productive as you can be if your PC is unreliable and unresponsive. 
This chapter has guided through the tools it’s easiest for you to use yourself, but others are also available. If 
you feel a bit more ambitious and technically minded, you can find all the information you need to diagnose, 
troubleshoot, and repair problems in Windows 10 in my book Windows 10 Troubleshooting (Apress, 2016), 
which you can find online at http://pcs.tv/2wWbdWP and at good booksellers.
Armed with the information in this book, you can be more productive, happier, and most importantly, 
more confident that you can do all the great things that you’ve seen friends and colleagues do—and a 
lot more besides. I encourage you to keep learning and perhaps to also read my Office 365 Productivity 
Handbook (Apress, 2018) next!
